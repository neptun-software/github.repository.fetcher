For usage questions, please use the following resources:\n\n- read the [docs](https://socket.io/docs/v4/)\n- check the [troubleshooting guide](https://socket.io/docs/v4/troubleshooting-connection-issues/)\n- look for/ask questions on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/socket.io)\n- create a new [discussion](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/discussions/new?category=q-a)\n\n## Guidelines for reporting a bug\n\nIf you think that you have found a security vulnerability in our project, please do not create an issue in this GitHub repository, but rather refer to our [security policy](./SECURITY.md).\n\nPlease make sure that the bug hasn't already been reported in our [issues list](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/issues?q=label%3Abug+), as it may already have been fixed in a recent version. However, if the bug was reported in an old, closed issue but persists, you should open a new issue instead of commenting on the old issue.\n\nAfter these checks, please [create a new bug report](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/issues/new/choose) with all the necessary details:\n\n- package versions\n- platform (device, browser, operating system)\n- a minimal reproduction (you can fork [this repository](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-fiddle))\n\nWithout a clear way to reproduce the bug, we unfortunately won't be able to help you.\n\n## Guidelines for requesting a feature\n\nPlease make sure that the feature hasn't already been requested in our [issues list](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/labels/enhancement).\n\nAfter these checks, please [create a new feature request](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/issues/new/choose) with all the necessary details:\n\n- what the problem is\n- what you want to happen\n- any alternative solutions or features you have considered\n\n## Guidelines for creating a pull request\n\n### Bug fix\n\n- if you fix a bug which is described in our [issues list](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/issues), please add a reference to it in the description of your pull request. Otherwise, please provide all necessary details to reproduce the bug, as described [above](#guidelines-for-reporting-a-bug).\n- add one or more test cases, in order to avoid any regression in the future\n- make sure existing tests still pass\n\n### New feature\n\n- we strongly suggest that you first open a [feature request](#guidelines-for-requesting-a-feature) and have it approved before working on it. In that case, please add a reference to it in the description of your pull request.\n- add one or more test cases, in order to avoid any regression in the future\n- make sure existing tests still pass\n\n## Project structure\n\nThis repository is a [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) which contains the source of the following packages:\n\n| Package                        | Description                                                                                                                           |\n|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `engine.io`                    | The server-side implementation of the low-level communication layer.                                                                  |\n| `engine.io-client`             | The client-side implementation of the low-level communication layer.                                                                  |\n| `engine.io-parser`             | The parser responsible for encoding and decoding Engine.IO packets, used by both the `engine.io` and `engine.io-client` packages.     |\n| `socket.io`                    | The server-side implementation of the bidirectional channel, built on top on the `engine.io` package.                                 |\n| `socket.io-adapter`            | An extensible component responsible for broadcasting a packet to all connected clients, used by the `socket.io` package.              |\n| `socket.io-client`             | The client-side implementation of the bidirectional channel, built on top on the `engine.io-client` package.                          |\n| `@socket.io/cluster-engine`    | A cluster-friendly engine to share load between multiple Node.js processes (without sticky sessions)                                  |\n| `@socket.io/component-emitter` | An `EventEmitter` implementation, similar to the one provided by [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html) but for all platforms. |\n| `socket.io-parser`             | The parser responsible for encoding and decoding Socket.IO packets, used by both the `socket.io` and `socket.io-client` packages.     |\n\n## Development setup\n\nYou will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) **version 18+**, and [`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm) **version 7+**, as we make use of npm's [workspaces feature](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/using-npm/workspaces).\n\nAfter cloning the repository, please run:\n\n```bash\nnpm ci\n```\n\nto install all dependencies.\n\nHere is the list of tools that we use:\n\n- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as the development language\n- [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) for production bundling\n- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting\n- [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) for testing\n- [WebdriverIO](https://webdriver.io/) for browser and mobile testing\n\n## Commands\n\nEach npm workspace corresponds to a package. You can run the command:\n\n- on all workspaces with the `--workspace` command-line argument (abbreviated `-ws`)\n- on a specific workspace with the `--workspace=<some-workspace>` command-line argument\n\n### Compile with TypeScript\n\nFor all workspaces:\n\n```bash\nnpm run compile -ws --if-present\n```\n\nFor a specific workspace:\n\n```bash\nnpm run compile --workspace=socket.io\n```\n\n### Apply formatting\n\nFor all workspaces:\n\n```bash\nnpm run format:fix -ws\n```\n\nFor a specific workspace:\n\n```bash\nnpm run format:fix --workspace=socket.io\n```\n\n### Run the tests\n\nFor all workspaces:\n\n```bash\nnpm test -ws\n```\n\nFor a specific workspace:\n\n```bash\nnpm test --workspace=socket.io\n```\n\n### Generate the changelog\n\nInstall the [`conventional-changelog-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/conventional-changelog-cli) package:\n\n```bash\nnpm i -g conventional-changelog-cli\n```\n\nThen run:\n\n```bash\ncd packages/engine.io-client\nconventional-changelog -p angular --tag-prefix \"engine.io-client@\" --commit-path .\n```\n"

It's built using Webpack.\n\n# Getting started\n\nFirst of all, clone this repository.\n\n# Install Dependencies\n- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) **version 15 or newer*\n- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)\n\nFirst, from within the `tabby` directory install the dependencies via yarn:\n\n```\n# macOS & Windows:\nyarn\n```\n\n```\n# Linux (Debian/Ubuntu here as an example)\nsudo apt install libfontconfig-dev libsecret-1-dev libarchive-tools libnss3 libatk1.0-0 libatk-bridge2.0-0 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0 libgtk-3-0 libgbm1 cmake\nyarn\n```\n\n_⚠️Note: If you forked this repository, you may need to pull down the tags from this repository before installing node modules. `git pull --tags upstream master`_\n\nBuild Tabby:\n\n```\nyarn run build\n```\n\nStart Tabby\n\n```\nyarn start\n```\n\n# Building an installer\n\nTo build an installer, first complete a \"normal\" build as described above and then run:\n\n```\nnode scripts/prepackage-plugins.mjs\n\nnode scripts/build-windows.mjs\n# or\nnode scripts/build-linux.mjs\n# or\nnode scripts/build-macos.mjs\n```\n\nThe artifacts will be produced in the `dist` folder.\n\n# Project layout\n```\ntabby\n├─ app                                  # Electron app, just the bare essentials\n|  ├─ src                               # Electron renderer code\n|  └─ main.js                           # Electron main entry point\n├─ build\n├─ clink                                # Clink distributive, for Windows\n├─ scripts                              # Maintenance scripts\n├─ tabby-community-color-schemes     # Plugin that provides color schemes\n├─ tabby-core                        # Plugin that provides base UI and tab management\n├─ tabby-electron                    # Plugin that provides Electron-specific functions\n├─ tabby-local                       # Plugin that provides local shells and profiles\n├─ tabby-plugin-manager              # Plugin that installs other plugins\n├─ tabby-settings                    # Plugin that provides the settings tab\n├─ tabby-terminal                    # Plugin that provides terminal tabs\n└─ tabby-web                         # Plugin that provides web-specific functions\n```\n\n# Plugin layout\n```\ntabby-pluginname\n├─ src                                  # Typescript code\n|  ├─ components                        # Angular components\n|  |  ├─ foo.component.ts               # Code\n|  |  ├─ foo.component.scss             # Styles\n|  |  └─ foo.component.pug              # Template\n|  ├─ services                          # Angular services\n|  |  └─ foo.service.ts\n|  ├─ api.ts                            # Publicly exported API\n|  └─ index.ts                          # Module entry point\n├─ package.json\n├─ tsconfig.json\n└─ webpack.config.js\n```\n\n# Plugins\n\nThe app will load all plugins from the source checkout in the dev mode, from the user's plugins directory at all times (click `Open Plugins Directory` under `Settings` > `Plugins`) and from the directory specified by the `TABBY_PLUGINS` environment var.\n\nOnly modules whose `package.json` file contains a `tabby-plugin` keyword will be loaded.\n\nIf you're currently in your plugin's directory, start Tabby as `TABBY_PLUGINS=$(pwd) tabby --debug`\n\nA plugin should only provide a default export, which should be a `NgModule` class (or a `NgModuleWithDependencies` where applicable). This module will be injected as a dependency to the app's root module.\n\n```javascript\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core'\n\n@NgModule()\nexport default class MyModule {\n  constructor () {\n    console.log('Angular engaged, cap\\'n.')\n  }\n}\n```\n\nPlugins provide functionality by exporting singular or multi providers:\n\n\n```javascript\nimport { NgModule, Injectable } from '@angular/core'\nimport { ToolbarButtonProvider, ToolbarButton } from 'tabby-core'\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class MyButtonProvider extends ToolbarButtonProvider {\n    provide (): ToolbarButton[] {\n        return [{\n            icon: 'star',\n            title: 'Foobar',\n            weight: 10,\n            click: () => {\n                alert('Woohoo!')\n            }\n        }]\n    }\n}\n\n@NgModule({\n    providers: [\n        { provide: ToolbarButtonProvider, useClass: MyButtonProvider, multi: true },\n    ],\n})\nexport default class MyModule { }\n```\n\n\nSee `tabby-core/src/api.ts`, `tabby-settings/src/api.ts`, `tabby-local/src/api.ts` and `tabby-terminal/src/api.ts` for the available extension points.\n\nAlso check out [the example plugin](https://github.com/Eugeny/tabby-clippy).\n\nPublish your plugin on NPM with a `tabby-plugin` keyword to make it appear in the Plugin Manager.\n"

Purpose\n\nA primary goal of Awesome C/C++ is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).\n\nThis code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.\n\nWe invite all those who participate in Awesome C/C++ to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.\n\n## 2. Open Source Citizenship\n\nA supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open source citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.\n\nCommunities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.\n\nIf you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.\n\n## 3. Expected Behavior\n\nThe following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:\n\n*   Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.\n*   Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.\n*   Attempt collaboration before conflict.\n*   Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.\n*   Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.\n*   Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.\n\n## 4. Unacceptable Behavior\n\nThe following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:\n\n*   Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.\n*   Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.\n*   Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.\n*   Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information (\"doxing\").\n*   Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.\n*   Inappropriate photography or recording.\n*   Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone’s consent before touching them.\n*   Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.\n*   Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).\n*   Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.\n*   Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.\n\n## 5. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior\n\nUnacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.\n\nAnyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.\n\nIf a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).\n\n## 6. Reporting Guidelines\n\nIf you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible. fffaraz@gmail.com.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.\n\n## 7. Addressing Grievances\n\nIf you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify fffaraz with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies.\n\n\n\n## 8. Scope\n\nWe expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues–online and in-person–as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.\n\nThis code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.\n\n## 9.

          "content": "# Welcome, AI Chef\n\nThe OpenAI Cookbook is a community-driven resource aimed at sharing knowledge in a way that is accessible, engaging, and enriching for all AI builders.\n\nBefore contributing, read through the existing issues and pull requests to see if someone else is already working on something similar. That way you can avoid duplicating efforts.\n\n## What makes a good contribution?\n\nGenerally, we have found that the best contributions to the Cookbook are **useful**, **novel** or **creative**, or a combination of these.\n\n- **Useful:** Involves concepts or techniques that can be applied broadly and often, and can translate to practical use-cases and solving real-world problems. If you're doing something often, chances are others are too, and having reusable examples to reference can be very helpful.\n- **Novel:** Showcases new developments or techniques. Look out for new research on how to best use LLMs, or new models and capabilities in the API.\n- **Creative:** Uses LLMs in creative and innovative ways, or combines multiple APIs and tools in novel ways.\n\nAdditionally, we strive to maintain a **neutral** tone, and aim for **high quality** writing.\n\n- **Neutral:** Maintains a neutral stance on tools and products. While it's natural to have preferences for particular tools, a good guide avoids over-evangelizing or marketing specific products, ensuring integrity and inclusivity.\n- **High quality:** Well structured, clear and complete. Writing good content ensures others can fully benefit from it. See the rubric below for more details on how we assess the quality of submissions to the Cookbook.\n\n## Rubric\n\nTo ensure the quality of submissions, we have established a rubric that assesses each contribution on various areas. The purpose of this rating system is to maintain a high standard of quality, relevance, and uniqueness. Each area is rated on a scale from 1 to 4. Contributions that score lower than a 3 in any of the areas will generally be rejected.\n\nWe encourage contributors to familiarize themselves with this rubric before writing content. Understanding the criteria not only increases the chances of your contribution being accepted, but also helps in creating a resource that is comprehensive, clear, and beneficial for all users.\n\nFor additional advice on writing good documentation, refer to [What Makes Documentation Good](https://cookbook.openai.com/what_makes_documentation_good).\n\n| Criteria     | Description                                                                                         | Score |\n| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |\n| Relevance    | Is the content related to building with OpenAI technologies? Is it useful to others?                |       |\n| Uniqueness   | Does the content offer new insights or unique information compared to existing documentation?       |       |\n| Clarity      | Is the language easy to understand? Are things well-explained? Is the title clear?                  |       |\n| Correctness  | Are the facts, code snippets, and examples correct and reliable?

To run these examples, you'll need an OpenAI account and associated API key ([create a free account here](https://beta.openai.com/signup)). Set an environment variable called `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your API key. Alternatively, in most IDEs such as Visual Studio Code, you can create an `.env` file at the root of your repo containing `OPENAI_API_KEY=<your API key>`, which will be picked up by the notebooks.\n\nMost code examples are written in Python, though the concepts can be applied in any language.\n\nFor other useful tools, guides and courses, check out these [related resources from around the web](https://cookbook.openai.com/related_resources).\n\n## Contributing\n\nThe OpenAI Cookbook is a community-driven resource. Whether you're submitting an idea, fixing a typo, adding a new guide, or improving an existing one, your contributions are greatly appreciated!\n\nBefore contributing, read through the existing issues and pull requests to see if someone else is already working on something similar. That way you can avoid duplicating efforts.\n\nIf there are examples or guides you'd like to see, feel free to suggest them on the [issues page](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/issues).\n\nIf you'd like to contribute new content, make sure to read through our [contribution guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md). We welcome high-quality submissions of new examples and guides, as long as they meet our criteria and fit within the scope of the cookbook.\n\nThe contents of this repo are automatically rendered into [cookbook.openai.com](https://cookbook.openai.com) based on [registry.yaml](/registry.yaml).\n\n[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=468576060&machine=basicLinux32gb&location=EastUs)\n"

          "content": "# Contributing\n\nWe are open to, and grateful for, any contributions made by the community. By contributing to Redux, you agree to abide by the [code of conduct](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n## Reporting Issues and Asking Questions\n\nBefore opening an issue, please search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/issues) to make sure your issue hasn't already been reported.\n\n### Bugs and Improvements\n\nWe use the issue tracker to keep track of bugs and improvements to Redux itself, its examples, and the documentation. We encourage you to open issues to discuss improvements, architecture, theory, internal implementation, etc. If a topic has been discussed before, we will ask you to join the previous discussion.\n\nAs Redux is stable software, changes to its behavior are very carefully considered. Any pull requests that involve breaking changes should be made against the `next` branch.\n\n### Getting Help\n\n**For support or usage questions like “how do I do X with Redux” and “my code doesn't work”, please search and ask on [StackOverflow with a Redux tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/redux?sort=votes&pageSize=50) first.**\n\nWe ask you to do this because StackOverflow has a much better job at keeping popular questions visible. Unfortunately good answers get lost and outdated on GitHub.\n\nSome questions take a long time to get an answer. **If your question gets closed or you don't get a reply on StackOverflow for longer than a few days,** we encourage you to post an issue linking to your question. We will close your issue but this will give people watching the repo an opportunity to see your question and reply to it on StackOverflow if they know the answer.\n\nPlease be considerate when doing this as this is not the primary purpose of the issue tracker.\n\n### Help Us Help You\n\nOn both websites, it is a good idea to structure your code and question in a way that is easy to read to entice people to answer it. For example, we encourage you to use syntax highlighting, indentation, and split text in paragraphs.\n\nPlease keep in mind that people spend their free time trying to help you. You can make it easier for them if you provide versions of the relevant libraries and a runnable small project reproducing your issue. You can put your code on [JSBin](https://jsbin.com) or, for bigger projects, on GitHub. Make sure all the necessary dependencies are declared in `package.json` so anyone can run `npm install && npm start` and reproduce your issue.\n\n## Development\n\nVisit the [issue tracker](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/issues) to find a list of open issues that need attention.\n\nFork, then clone the repo:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/your-username/redux.git\n```\n\n### Building\n\nThis repo uses Yarn 3 for all package management. Please ensure that Yarn 1.x is installed globally on your system, so that Yarn 3 will run properly inside this repo.\n\n#### Building Redux\n\nRunning the `build` task will build the artifacts into the `./dist` folder\n\n```sh\nyarn build\n```\n\n### Testing and Linting\n\nTo only run linting:\n\n```sh\nyarn lint\n```\n\nTo only run tests:\n\n```sh\nyarn test\n```\n\nTo continuously watch and run tests, run the following:\n\n```sh\nyarn test:watch\n```\n\n### Docs\n\nImprovements to the documentation are always welcome. You can find them in the [`docs`](/docs) path. We use [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) to build our documentation website. The website is published automatically whenever the `master` branch is updated.\n\n### Examples\n\nRedux comes with [official examples](https://redux.js.org/introduction/examples) to demonstrate various concepts and best practices.\n\nWhen adding a new example, please adhere to the style and format of the existing examples, and try to reuse as much code as possible. For example, `index.html`, `server.js`, and `webpack.config.js` can typically be reused.\n\n#### Testing the Examples\n\nTo test the official Redux examples, run the following:\n\n```sh\nyarn examples:test\n```\n\nNot all examples have tests. If you see an example project without tests, you are very welcome to add them in a way consistent with the examples that have tests.\n\nPlease visit the [Examples page](https://redux.js.org/introduction/examples) for information on running individual examples.\n\n### Sending a Pull Request\n\nFor non-trivial changes, please open an issue with a proposal for a new feature or refactoring before starting on the work. We don't want you to waste your efforts on a pull request that we won't want to accept.\n\nOn the other hand, sometimes the best way to start a conversation _is_ to send a pull request. Use your best judgement!\n\nIn general, the contribution workflow looks like this:\n\n- Open a new issue in the [Issue tracker](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/issues).\n- Fork the repo.\n- Create a new feature branch based off the `master` branch.\n- Make sure all tests pass and there are no linting errors.\n- Submit a pull request, referencing any issues it addresses.\n\nPlease try to keep your pull request focused in scope and avoid including unrelated commits.\n\nAfter you have submitted your pull request, we'll try to get back to you as soon as possible. We may suggest some changes or improvements.\n\nThank you for contributing!\n"

On top of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as [live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools).\n\nYou can use Redux together with [React](https://react.dev), or with any other view library. The Redux core is tiny (2kB, including dependencies), and has a rich ecosystem of addons.\n\n[**Redux Toolkit**](https://redux-toolkit.js.org) is our official recommended approach for writing Redux logic. It wraps around the Redux core, and contains packages and functions that we think are essential for building a Redux app. Redux Toolkit builds in our suggested best practices, simplifies most Redux tasks, prevents common mistakes, and makes it easier to write Redux applications.\n\n![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/reduxjs/redux/test.yaml?branch=master&event=push&style=flat-square)\n[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/redux.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux)\n[![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/redux.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux)\n[![redux channel on discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/discord-%23redux%20%40%20reactiflux-61dafb.svg?style=flat-square)](https://discord.gg/0ZcbPKXt5bZ6au5t)\n\n## Installation\n\n### Create a React Redux App\n\nThe recommended way to start new apps with React and Redux Toolkit is by using [our official Redux Toolkit + TS template for Vite](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-templates), or by creating a new Next.js project using [Next's `with-redux` template](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-redux).\n\nBoth of these already have Redux Toolkit and React-Redux configured appropriately for that build tool, and come with a small example app that demonstrates how to use several of Redux Toolkit's features.\n\n```bash\n# Vite with our Redux+TS template\n# (using the `degit` tool to clone and extract the template)\nnpx degit reduxjs/redux-templates/packages/vite-template-redux my-app\n\n# Next.js using the `with-redux` template\nnpx create-next-app --example with-redux my-app\n```\n\nWe do not currently have official React Native templates, but recommend these templates for standard React Native and for Expo:\n\n- https://github.com/rahsheen/react-native-template-redux-typescript\n- https://github.com/rahsheen/expo-template-redux-typescript\n\n```\nnpm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux\n```\n\nFor the Redux core library by itself:\n\n```\nnpm install redux\n```\n\nFor more details, see [the Installation docs page](https://redux.js.org/introduction/installation).\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe Redux core docs are located at **https://redux.js.org**, and include the full Redux tutorials, as well usage guides on general Redux patterns:\n\n- [Introduction](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started)\n- [Tutorials](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/index)\n- [Usage Guides](https://redux.js.org/usage/index)\n- [FAQ](https://redux.js.org/faq)\n- [API Reference](https://redux.js.org/api/api-reference)\n\nThe Redux Toolkit docs are available at **https://redux-toolkit.js.org**, including API references and usage guides for all of the APIs included in Redux Toolkit.\n\n## Learn Redux\n\n### Redux Essentials Tutorial\n\nThe [**Redux Essentials tutorial**](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts) is a \"top-down\" tutorial that teaches \"how to use Redux the right way\", using our latest recommended APIs and best practices. We recommend starting there.\n\n### Redux Fundamentals Tutorial\n\nThe [**Redux Fundamentals tutorial**](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-1-overview) is a \"bottom-up\" tutorial that teaches \"how Redux works\" from first principles and without any abstractions, and why standard Redux usage patterns exist.\n\n### Help and Discussion\n\nThe **[#redux channel](https://discord.gg/0ZcbPKXt5bZ6au5t)** of the **[Reactiflux Discord community](https://www.reactiflux.com)** is our official resource for all questions related to learning and using Redux. Reactiflux is a great place to hang out, ask questions, and learn - please come and join us there!\n\n## Before Proceeding Further\n\nRedux is a valuable tool for organizing your state, but you should also consider whether it's appropriate for your situation. Please don't use Redux just because someone said you should - instead, please take some time to understand the potential benefits and tradeoffs of using it.\n\nHere are some suggestions on when it makes sense to use Redux:\n\n- You have reasonable amounts of data changing over time\n- You need a single source of truth for your state\n- You find that keeping all your state in a top-level component is no longer sufficient\n\nYes, these guidelines are subjective and vague, but this is for a good reason. The point at which you should integrate Redux into your application is different for every user and different for every application.\n\n> **For more thoughts on how Redux is meant to be used, please see:**<br>\n>\n> - **[When (and when not) to reach for Redux](https://changelog.com/posts/when-and-when-not-to-reach-for-redux)**\n> - **[You Might Not Need Redux](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/you-might-not-need-redux-be46360cf367)**<br>\n> - **[The Tao of Redux, Part 1 - Implementation and Intent](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/05/idiomatic-redux-tao-of-redux-part-1/)**<br>\n> - **[The Tao of Redux, Part 2 - Practice and Philosophy](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/05/idiomatic-redux-tao-of-redux-part-2/)**\n> - **[Redux FAQ](https://redux.js.org/faq)**\n\n## Basic Example\n\nThe whole global state of your app is stored in an object tree inside a single _store_.\nThe only way to change the state tree is to create an _action_, an object describing what happened, and _dispatch_ it to the store.\nTo specify how state gets updated in response to an action, you write pure _reducer_ functions that calculate a new state based on the old state and the action.\n\nRedux Toolkit simplifies the process of writing Redux logic and setting up the store. With Redux Toolkit, the basic app logic looks like:\n\n```js\nimport { createSlice, configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'\n\nconst counterSlice = createSlice({\n  name: 'counter',\n  initialState: {\n    value: 0\n  },\n  reducers: {\n    incremented: state => {\n      // Redux Toolkit allows us to write \"mutating\" logic in reducers. It\n      // doesn't actually mutate the state because it uses the Immer library,\n      // which detects changes to a \"draft state\" and produces a brand new\n      // immutable state based off those changes\n      state.value += 1\n    },\n    decremented: state => {\n      state.value -= 1\n    }\n  }\n})\n\nexport const { incremented, decremented } = counterSlice.actions\n\nconst store = configureStore({\n  reducer: counterSlice.reducer\n})\n\n// Can still subscribe to the store\nstore.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()))\n\n// Still pass action objects to `dispatch`, but they're created for us\nstore.dispatch(incremented())\n// {value: 1}\nstore.dispatch(incremented())\n// {value: 2}\nstore.dispatch(decremented())\n// {value: 1}\n```\n\nRedux Toolkit allows us to write shorter logic that's easier to read, while still following the original core Redux behavior and data flow.\n\n## Logo\n\nYou can find the official logo [on GitHub](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/logo).\n\n## Change Log\n\nThis project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).\nEvery release, along with the migration instructions, is documented on the GitHub [Releases](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/releases) page.\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](LICENSE.md)\n"

Improving the\ndocumentation is no less important than improving the library itself. If you\nfind a typo in the documentation, or have made improvements, do not hesitate to\nsend an email to the mailing list or preferably submit a GitHub pull request.\nDocumentation can be found under the\n[doc/](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/tree/main/doc) directory.\n\nBut there are many other ways to help. In particular answering queries on the\n[issue tracker](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues),\ninvestigating bugs, and [reviewing other developers' pull\nrequests](https://scikit-learn.org/dev/developers/contributing.html#code-review-guidelines)\nare very valuable contributions that decrease the burden on the project\nmaintainers.\n\nAnother way to contribute is to report issues you're facing, and give a \"thumbs\nup\" on issues that others reported and that are relevant to you. It also helps\nus if you spread the word: reference the project from your blog and articles,\nlink to it from your website, or simply star it in GitHub to say \"I use it\".\n\nQuick links\n-----------\n\n* [Submitting a bug report or feature request](https://scikit-learn.org/dev/developers/contributing.html#submitting-a-bug-report-or-a-feature-request)\n* [Contributing code](https://scikit-learn.org/dev/developers/contributing.html#contributing-code)\n* [Coding guidelines](https://scikit-learn.org/dev/developers/develop.html#coding-guidelines)\n* [Tips to read current code](https://scikit-learn.org/dev/developers/contributing.html#reading-the-existing-code-base)\n\nCode of Conduct\n---------------\n\nWe abide by the principles of openness, respect, and consideration of others\nof the Python Software Foundation: https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/.\n"

비교하며, 순서가 잘못된 경우 그접한 아이템들을 스왑하는 알고리즘이다. 더 이상 스왑할 것이 없을 때까지 반복하며, 반복이 끝남음 리스트가 정렬되었음을 의미한다.\n\n**속성**\n\n- 최악의 성능 O(n^2)\n- 최고의 성능 O(n)\n- 평균 성능 O(n^2)\n\n###### View the algorithm in

또는 머지 소트보다 훨씬 안좋은 효율을 가진다. 그림에서 각 막대는 정렬해야 하는 배열의 요소를 나타낸다. 상단과 두 번째 상단 막대의 첫 번째 교차점에서 발생하는 것은 두 번째 요소가 첫 번째 요소보다 더 높은 우선 순위를 가지기 때문에 막대로 표시되는 이러한 요소를 교환한 것이다. 이 방법을 반복하면 삽입 정렬이 완료된다.\n\n**속성**\n\n-

효율적인, 범용적인, 비교 기반 정렬 알고리즘이다. 대부분의 구현은 안정적인 분류를 이루는데, 이것은 구현이 정렬된 출력에 동일한 요소의 입력 순서를 유지한다는 것을 의미한다. 합병 정렬은 1945년에 John von Neumann이 발명한 분할 정복 알고리즘이다.\n\n**속성**\n\n- 최악의 성능 O(n log n) (일반적)\n- 최고의 성능

아이템들은 나머지 항목을 차지하는 리스트이다. 처음에는 정렬된 리스트는 공백이고 나머지가 전부이다. 오르차순(또는 내림차순) 알고리즘은 가장 작은 요소를 정렬되지 않은 리스트에서 찾고 정렬이 안된 가장 왼쪽(정렬된 리스트) 리스트와 바꾼다. 이렇게 오른쪽으로 나아간다.\n\n**속성**\n\n- 최악의 성능 O(n^2)\n- 최고의 성능 O(n^2)\n-

모든 n번째 요소가 정렬된 목록을 제공한다는 것을 고려하여 어느 곳에서든지 시작하도록 요소의 목록을 배열하는 것이다. 이러한 목록은 h-sorted로 알려져 있다. 마찬가지로, 각각 개별적으로 정렬된 h 인터리브 목록으로 간주할 수 있다.\n\n**속성**\n\n- 최악의 성능 O(nlog2 2n)\n- 최고의 성능 O(n log n)\n- Average

최악의 경우 공간 복잡성 O(1) iterative\n\n### Binary (이진 탐색)\n\n![alt text][binary-image]\n\nFrom [Wikipedia][binary-wiki]: 이진 탐색, (also known as half-interval search or logarithmic search), 은 정렬된 배열 내에서 목표값의 위치를 찾는 검색 알고리즘이다. 목표값을 배열의 중간 요소와 비교한다; 만약 목표값이 동일하지 않으면, 목표물의 절반이 제거되고 검색이 성공할 때까지 나머지 절반에서 속된다.\n\n**속성**\n\n- 최악의 성능 O(log n)\n- 최고의 성능 O(1)\n- 평균 O(log n)\n- 최악의 경우 공간 복잡성 O(1)\n\n[bubble-toptal]:

[Features](https://caddyserver.com/features)\n\n- **Easy configuration** with the [Caddyfile](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile)\n- **Powerful configuration** with its [native JSON config](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/)\n- **Dynamic configuration** with the [JSON API](https://caddyserver.com/docs/api)\n- [**Config adapters**](https://caddyserver.com/docs/config-adapters) if you don't like JSON\n- **Automatic HTTPS** by default\n\t- [ZeroSSL](https://zerossl.com) and [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) for public names\n\t- Fully-managed local CA for internal names & IPs\n\t- Can coordinate with other Caddy instances in a cluster\n\t- Multi-issuer fallback\n- **Stays up when other servers go down** due to TLS/OCSP/certificate-related issues\n- **Production-ready** after serving trillions of requests and managing millions of TLS certificates\n- **Scales to hundreds of thousands of sites** as proven in production\n- **HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3** all supported by default\n- **Highly extensible** [modular architecture](https://caddyserver.com/docs/architecture) lets Caddy do anything without bloat\n- **Runs anywhere** with **no external dependencies** (not even libc)\n- Written in Go, a language with higher **memory safety guarantees** than other servers\n- Actually **fun to use**\n- So much more to [discover](https://caddyserver.com/features)\n\n## Install\n\nThe simplest, cross-platform way to get started is to download Caddy from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/releases) and place the executable file in your PATH.\n\nSee [our online documentation](https://caddyserver.com/docs/install) for other install instructions.\n\n## Build from source\n\nRequirements:\n\n- [Go 1.22.3 or newer](https://golang.org/dl/)\n\n### For development\n\n_**Note:** These steps [will not embed proper version information](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/29228). For that, please follow the instructions in the next section._\n\n```bash\n$ git clone \"https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy.git\"\n$ cd caddy/cmd/caddy/\n$ go build\n```\n\nWhen you run Caddy, it may try to bind to low ports unless otherwise specified in your config. If your OS requires elevated privileges for this, you will need to give your new binary permission to do so. On Linux, this can be done easily with: `sudo setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep ./caddy`\n\nIf you prefer to use `go run` which only creates temporary binaries, you can still do this with the included `setcap.sh` like so:\n\n```bash\n$ go run -exec ./setcap.sh main.go\n```\n\nIf you don't want to type your password for `setcap`, use `sudo visudo` to edit your sudoers file and allow your user account to run that command without a password, for example:\n\n```\nusername ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/setcap\n```\n\nreplacing `username` with your actual username. Please be careful and only do this if you know what you are doing! We are only qualified to document how to use Caddy, not Go tooling or your computer, and we are providing these instructions for convenience only; please learn how to use your own computer at your own risk and make any needful adjustments.\n\n### With version information and/or plugins\n\nUsing [our builder tool, `xcaddy`](https://github.com/caddyserver/xcaddy)...\n\n```\n$ xcaddy build\n```\n\n...the following steps are automated:\n\n1. Create a new folder: `mkdir caddy`\n2. Change into it: `cd caddy`\n3. Copy [Caddy's main.go](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/blob/master/cmd/caddy/main.go) into the empty folder. Add imports for any custom plugins you want to add.\n4. Initialize a Go module: `go mod init caddy`\n5. (Optional) Pin Caddy version: `go get github.com/caddyserver/caddy/v2@version` replacing `version` with a git tag, commit, or branch name.\n6. (Optional) Add plugins by adding their import: `_ \"import/path/here\"`\n7. Compile: `go build -tags=nobadger,nomysql,nopgx`\n\n\n\n\n## Quick start\n\nThe [Caddy website](https://caddyserver.com/docs/) has documentation that includes tutorials, quick-start guides, reference, and more.\n\n**We recommend that all users -- regardless of experience level -- do our [Getting Started](https://caddyserver.com/docs/getting-started) guide to become familiar with using Caddy.**\n\nIf you've only got a minute, [the website has several quick-start tutorials](https://caddyserver.com/docs/quick-starts) to choose from! However, after finishing a quick-start tutorial, please read more documentation to understand how the software works. 🙂\n\n\n\n\n## Overview\n\nCaddy is most often used as an HTTPS server, but it is suitable for any long-running Go program. First and foremost, it is a platform to run Go applications. Caddy \"apps\" are just Go programs that are implemented as Caddy modules. Two apps -- `tls` and `http` -- ship standard with Caddy.\n\nCaddy apps instantly benefit from [automated documentation](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/), graceful on-line [config changes via API](https://caddyserver.com/docs/api), and unification with other Caddy apps.\n\nAlthough [JSON](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/) is Caddy's native config language, Caddy can accept input from [config adapters](https://caddyserver.com/docs/config-adapters) which can essentially convert any config format of your choice into JSON: Caddyfile, JSON 5, YAML, TOML, NGINX config, and more.\n\nThe primary way to configure Caddy is through [its API](https://caddyserver.com/docs/api), but if you prefer config files, the [command-line interface](https://caddyserver.com/docs/command-line) supports those too.\n\nCaddy exposes an unprecedented level of control compared to any web server in existence. In Caddy, you are usually setting the actual values of the initialized types in memory that power everything from your HTTP handlers and TLS handshakes to your storage medium. Caddy is also ridiculously extensible, with a powerful plugin system that makes vast improvements over other web servers.\n\nTo wield the power of this design, you need to know how the config document is structured. Please see [our documentation site](https://caddyserver.com/docs/) for details about [Caddy's config structure](https://caddyserver.com/docs/json/).\n\nNearly all of Caddy's configuration is contained in a single config document, rather than being scattered across CLI flags and env variables and a configuration file as with other web servers. This makes managing your server config more straightforward and reduces hidden variables/factors.\n\n\n## Full documentation\n\nOur website has complete documentation:\n\n**https://caddyserver.com/docs/**\n\nThe docs are also open source. You can contribute to them here: https://github.com/caddyserver/website\n\n\n\n## Getting help\n\n- We advise companies using Caddy to secure a support contract through [Ardan Labs](https://www.ardanlabs.com/my/contact-us?dd=caddy) before help is needed.\n\n- A [sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/mholt) goes a long way! We can offer private help to sponsors. If Caddy is benefitting your company, please consider a sponsorship. This not only helps fund full-time work to ensure the longevity of the project, it provides your company the resources, support, and discounts you need; along with being a great look for your company to your customers and potential customers!\n\n- Individuals can exchange help for free on our community forum at https://caddy.community. Remember that people give help out of their spare time and good will. The best way to get help is to give it first!\n\nPlease use our [issue tracker](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/issues) only for bug reports and feature requests, i.e. actionable development items (support questions will usually be referred to the forums).\n\n\n\n## About\n\nMatthew Holt began developing Caddy in 2014 while studying computer science at Brigham Young University. (The name \"Caddy\" was chosen because this software helps with the tedious, mundane tasks of serving the Web, and is also a single place for multiple things to be organized together.) It soon became the first web server to use HTTPS automatically and by default, and now has hundreds of contributors and has served trillions of HTTPS requests.\n\n**The name \"Caddy\" is trademarked.** The name of the software is \"Caddy\", not \"Caddy Server\" or \"CaddyServer\". Please call it \"Caddy\" or, if you wish to clarify, \"the Caddy web server\". Caddy is a registered trademark of Stack Holdings GmbH.\n\n- _Project on Twitter: [@caddyserver](https://twitter.com/caddyserver)_\n- _Author on Twitter: [@mholt6](https://twitter.com/mholt6)_\n\nCaddy is a project of [ZeroSSL](https://zerossl.com), a Stack Holdings company.\n\nDebian package repository hosting is graciously provided by [Cloudsmith](https://cloudsmith.com). Cloudsmith is the only fully hosted, cloud-native, universal package management solution, that enables your organization to create, store and share packages in any format, to any place, with total confidence.\n"

By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [atom@github.com](mailto:atom@github.com).\n\n## I don't want to read this whole thing I just have a question!!!\n\n> **Note:** [Please don't file an issue to ask a question.](https://blog.atom.io/2016/04/19/managing-the-deluge-of-atom-issues.html) You'll get faster results by using the resources below.\n\nWe have an official message board with a detailed FAQ and where the community chimes in with helpful advice if you have questions.\n\n* [Github Discussions, the official Atom message board](https://github.com/atom/atom/discussions)\n* [Atom FAQ](https://flight-manual.atom.io/faq/)\n\n## What should I know before I get started?\n\n### Atom and Packages\n\nAtom is a large open source project &mdash; it's made up of over [200 repositories](https://github.com/atom). When you initially consider contributing to Atom, you might be unsure about which of those 200 repositories implements the functionality you want to change or report a bug for. This section should help you with that.\n\nAtom is intentionally very modular. Nearly every non-editor UI element you interact with comes from a package, even fundamental things like tabs and the status-bar. These packages are packages in the same way that packages in the [Atom package repository](https://atom.io/packages) are packages, with one difference: they are bundled into the [default distribution](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/10b8de6fc499a7def9b072739486e68530d67ab4/package.json#L58).\n\n<a id=\"atom-packages-image\"/>\n\n![atom-packages](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/69169/10472281/84fc9792-71d3-11e5-9fd1-19da717df079.png)\n\nTo get a sense for the packages that are bundled with Atom, you can go to `Settings` > `Packages` within Atom and take a look at the Core Packages section.\n\nHere's a list of the big ones:\n\n* [atom/atom](https://github.com/atom/atom) - Atom Core! The core editor component is responsible for basic text editing (e.g. cursors, selections, scrolling), text indentation, wrapping, and folding, text rendering, editor rendering, file system operations (e.g. saving), and installation and auto-updating. You should also use this repository for feedback related to the [Atom API](https://atom.io/docs/api/latest) and for large, overarching design proposals.\n* [tree-view](https://github.com/atom/tree-view) - file and directory listing on the left of the UI.\n* [fuzzy-finder](https://github.com/atom/fuzzy-finder) - the quick file opener.\n* [find-and-replace](https://github.com/atom/find-and-replace) - all search and replace functionality.\n* [tabs](https://github.com/atom/tabs) - the tabs for open editors at the top of the UI.\n* [status-bar](https://github.com/atom/status-bar) - the status bar at the bottom of the UI.\n* [markdown-preview](https://github.com/atom/markdown-preview) - the rendered markdown pane item.\n* [settings-view](https://github.com/atom/settings-view) - the settings UI pane item.\n* [autocomplete-plus](https://github.com/atom/autocomplete-plus) - autocompletions shown while typing. Some languages have additional packages for autocompletion functionality, such as [autocomplete-html](https://github.com/atom/autocomplete-html).\n* [git-diff](https://github.com/atom/git-diff) - Git change indicators shown in the editor's gutter.\n* [language-javascript](https://github.com/atom/language-javascript) - all bundled languages are packages too, and each one has a separate package `language-[name]`. Use these for feedback on syntax highlighting issues that only appear for a specific language.\n* [one-dark-ui](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-ui) - the default UI styling for anything but the text editor. UI theme packages (i.e. packages with a `-ui` suffix) provide only styling and it's possible that a bundled package is responsible for a UI issue. There are other bundled UI themes, such as [one-light-ui](https://github.com/atom/one-light-ui).\n* [one-dark-syntax](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-syntax) - the default syntax highlighting styles applied for all languages. There are other bundled syntax themes, such as [solarized-dark-syntax](https://github.com/atom/solarized-dark-syntax). You should use these packages for reporting issues that appear in many languages, but disappear if you change to another syntax theme.\n* [apm](https://github.com/atom/apm) - the `apm` command line tool (Atom Package Manager). You should use this repository for any contributions related to the `apm` tool and for publishing packages.\n* [atom.io](https://github.com/atom/atom.io) - the repository for feedback on the [Atom.io website](https://atom.io) and the [Atom.io package API](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/docs/apm-rest-api.md) used by [apm](https://github.com/atom/apm).\n\nThere are many more, but this list should be a good starting point. For more information on how to work with Atom's official packages, see [Contributing to Atom Packages][contributing-to-official-atom-packages].\n\nAlso, because Atom is so extensible, it's possible that a feature you've become accustomed to in Atom or an issue you're encountering isn't coming from a bundled package at all, but rather a [community package](https://atom.io/packages) you've installed. Each community package has its own repository too.\n\n#### Package Conventions\n\nThere are a few conventions that have developed over time around packages:\n\n* Packages that add one or more syntax highlighting grammars are named `language-[language-name]`\n    * Language packages can add other things besides just a grammar. Many offer commonly-used snippets. Try not to add too much though.\n* Theme packages are split into two categories: UI and Syntax themes\n    * UI themes are named `[theme-name]-ui`\n    * Syntax themes are named `[theme-name]-syntax`\n    * Often themes that are designed to work together are given the same root name, for example: `one-dark-ui` and `one-dark-syntax`\n    * UI themes style everything outside of the editor pane &mdash; all of the green areas in the [packages image above](#atom-packages-image)\n    * Syntax themes style just the items inside the editor pane, mostly syntax highlighting\n* Packages that add [autocomplete providers](https://github.com/atom/autocomplete-plus/wiki/Autocomplete-Providers) are named `autocomplete-[what-they-autocomplete]` &mdash; ex: [autocomplete-css](https://github.com/atom/autocomplete-css)\n\n### Design Decisions\n\nWhen we make a significant decision in how we maintain the project and what we can or cannot support, we will document it in the [atom/design-decisions repository](https://github.com/atom/design-decisions). If you have a question around how we do things, check to see if it is documented there. If it is *not* documented there, please open a new topic on [Github Discussions, the official Atom message board](https://github.com/atom/atom/discussions) and ask your question.\n\n## How Can I Contribute?\n\n### Reporting Bugs\n\nThis section guides you through submitting a bug report for Atom. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer: :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.\n\nBefore creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). Fill out [the required template](https://github.com/atom/.github/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md), the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.\n\n> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.\n\n#### Before Submitting A Bug Report\n\n* **Check the [debugging guide](https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/).** You might be able to find the cause of the problem and fix things yourself. Most importantly, check if you can reproduce the problem [in the latest version of Atom](https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version), if the problem happens when you run Atom in [safe mode](https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#check-if-the-problem-shows-up-in-safe-mode), and if you can get the desired behavior by changing [Atom's or packages' config settings](https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#check-atom-and-package-settings).\n* **Check the [faq](https://flight-manual.atom.io/faq/) and the [discussions](https://github.com/atom/atom/discussions)** for a list of common questions and problems.\n* **Determine [which repository the problem should be reported in](#atom-and-packages)**.\n* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/search?q=+is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.\n\n#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?\n\nBugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined [which repository](#atom-and-packages) your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information by filling in [the template](https://github.com/atom/.github/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md).\n\nExplain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:\n\n* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.\n* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started Atom, e.g. which command exactly you used in the terminal, or how you started Atom otherwise. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used the mouse, or a keyboard shortcut or an Atom command, and if so which one?\n* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).\n* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.\n* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**\n* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. If you use the keyboard while following the steps, **record the GIF with the [Keybinding Resolver](https://github.com/atom/keybinding-resolver) shown**. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.\n* **If you're reporting that Atom crashed**, include a crash report with a stack trace from the operating system. On macOS, the crash report will be available in `Console.app` under \"Diagnostic and usage information\" > \"User diagnostic reports\". Include the crash report in the issue in a [code block](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines), a [file attachment](https://help.github.com/articles/file-attachments-on-issues-and-pull-requests/), or put it in a [gist](https://gist.github.com/) and provide link to that gist.\n* **If the problem is related to performance or memory**, include a [CPU profile capture](https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#diagnose-runtime-performance) with your report.\n* **If Chrome's developer tools pane is shown without you triggering it**, that normally means that you have a syntax error in one of your themes or in your `styles.less`. Try running in [Safe Mode](https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#using-safe-mode) and using a different theme or comment out the contents of your `styles.less` to see if that fixes the problem.\n* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.\n\nProvide more context by answering these questions:\n\n* **Can you reproduce the problem in [safe mode](https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#diagnose-runtime-performance-problems-with-the-dev-tools-cpu-profiler)?**\n* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version of Atom) or was this always a problem?\n* If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem in an older version of Atom?** What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen? You can download older versions of Atom from [the releases page](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases).\n* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.\n* If the problem is related to working with files (e.g. opening and editing files), **does the problem happen for all files and projects or only some?** Does the problem happen only when working with local or remote files (e.g. on network drives), with files of a specific type (e.g. only JavaScript or Python files), with large files or files with very long lines, or with files in a specific encoding? Is there anything else special about the files you are using?\n\nInclude details about your configuration and environment:\n\n* **Which version of Atom are you using?** You can get the exact version by running `atom -v` in your terminal, or by starting Atom and running the `Application: About` command from the [Command Palette](https://github.com/atom/command-palette).\n* **What's the name and version of the OS you're using**?\n* **Are you running Atom in a virtual machine?** If so, which VM software are you using and which operating systems and versions are used for the host and the guest?\n* **Which [packages](#atom-and-packages) do you have installed?** You can get that list by running `apm list --installed`.\n* **Are you using [local configuration files](https://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/basic-customization/)** `config.cson`, `keymap.cson`, `snippets.cson`, `styles.less` and `init.coffee` to customize Atom? If so, provide the contents of those files, preferably in a [code block](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines) or with a link to a [gist](https://gist.github.com/).\n* **Are you using Atom with multiple monitors?** If so, can you reproduce the problem when you use a single monitor?\n* **Which keyboard layout are you using?** Are you using a US layout or some other layout?\n\n### Suggesting Enhancements\n\nThis section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Atom, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion :pencil: and find related suggestions :mag_right:.\n\nBefore creating enhancement suggestions, please check [this list](#before-submitting-an-enhancement-suggestion) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion). Fill in [the template](https://github.com/atom/.github/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md), including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.\n\n#### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion\n\n* **Check the [debugging guide](https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/)** for tips — you might discover that the enhancement is already available. Most importantly, check if you're using [the latest version of Atom](https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version) and if you can get the desired behavior by changing [Atom's or packages' config settings](https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#check-atom-and-package-settings).\n* **Check if there's already [a package](https://atom.io/packages) which provides that enhancement.**\n* **Determine [which repository the enhancement should be suggested in](#atom-and-packages).**\n* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/search?q=+is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom)** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.\n\n#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?\n\nEnhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined [which repository](#atom-and-packages) your enhancement suggestion is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information:\n\n* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.\n* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.\n* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).\n* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.\n* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part of Atom which the suggestion is related to. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.\n* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most Atom users and isn't something that can or should be implemented as a [community package](#atom-and-packages).\n* **List some other text editors or applications where this enhancement exists.**\n* **Specify which version of Atom you're using.** You can get the exact version by running `atom -v` in your terminal, or by starting Atom and running the `Application: About` command from the [Command Palette](https://github.com/atom/command-palette).\n* **Specify the name and version of the OS you're using.**\n\n### Your First Code Contribution\n\nUnsure where to begin contributing to Atom? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:\n\n* [Beginner issues][beginner] - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.\n* [Help wanted issues][help-wanted] - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.\n\nBoth issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.\n\nIf you want to read about using Atom or developing packages in Atom, the [Atom Flight Manual](https://flight-manual.atom.io) is free and available online. You can find the source to the manual in [atom/flight-manual.atom.io](https://github.com/atom/flight-manual.atom.io).\n\n#### Local development\n\nAtom Core and all packages can be developed locally. For instructions on how to do this, see the following sections in the [Atom Flight Manual](https://flight-manual.atom.io):\n\n* [Hacking on Atom Core][hacking-on-atom-core]\n* [Contributing to Official Atom Packages][contributing-to-official-atom-packages]\n\n### Pull Requests\n\nThe process described here has several goals:\n\n- Maintain Atom's quality\n- Fix problems that are important to users\n- Engage the community in working toward the best possible Atom\n- Enable a sustainable system for Atom's maintainers to review contributions\n\nPlease follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:\n\n1. Follow all instructions in [the template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)\n2. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides)\n3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing <details><summary>What if the status checks are failing?</summary>If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-run the status check for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we will open an issue to track that problem with our status check suite.</details>\n\nWhile the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.\n\n## Styleguides\n\n### Git Commit Messages\n\n* Use the present tense (\"Add feature\" not \"Added feature\")\n* Use the imperative mood (\"Move cursor to...\" not \"Moves cursor to...\")\n* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less\n* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line\n* When only changing documentation, include `[ci skip]` in the commit title\n* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:\n    * :art: `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code\n    * :racehorse: `:racehorse:` when improving performance\n    * :non-potable_water: `:non-potable_water:` when plugging memory leaks\n    * :memo: `:memo:` when writing docs\n    * :penguin: `:penguin:` when fixing something on Linux\n    * :apple: `:apple:` when fixing something on macOS\n    * :checkered_flag: `:checkered_flag:` when fixing something on Windows\n    * :bug: `:bug:` when fixing a bug\n    * :fire: `:fire:` when removing code or files\n    * :green_heart: `:green_heart:` when fixing the CI build\n    * :white_check_mark: `:white_check_mark:` when adding tests\n    * :lock: `:lock:` when dealing with security\n    * :arrow_up: `:arrow_up:` when upgrading dependencies\n    * :arrow_down: `:arrow_down:` when downgrading dependencies\n    * :shirt: `:shirt:` when removing linter warnings\n\n### JavaScript Styleguide\n\nAll JavaScript code is linted with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).\n\n* Prefer the object spread operator (`{...anotherObj}`) to `Object.assign()`\n* Inline `export`s with expressions whenever possible\n  ```js\n  // Use this:\n  export default class ClassName {\n\n  }\n\n  // Instead of:\n  class ClassName {\n\n  }\n  export default ClassName\n  ```\n* Place requires in the following order:\n    * Built in Node Modules (such as `path`)\n    * Built in Atom and Electron Modules (such as `atom`, `remote`)\n    * Local Modules (using relative paths)\n* Place class properties in the following order:\n    * Class methods and properties (methods starting with `static`)\n    * Instance methods and properties\n* [Avoid platform-dependent code](https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/cross-platform-compatibility/)\n\n### CoffeeScript Styleguide\n\n* Set parameter defaults without spaces around the equal sign\n    * `clear = (count=1) ->` instead of `clear = (count = 1) ->`\n* Use spaces around operators\n    * `count + 1` instead of `count+1`\n* Use spaces after commas (unless separated by newlines)\n* Use parentheses if it improves code clarity.\n* Prefer alphabetic keywords to symbolic keywords:\n    * `a is b` instead of `a == b`\n* Avoid spaces inside the curly-braces of hash literals:\n    * `{a: 1, b: 2}` instead of `{ a: 1, b: 2 }`\n* Include a single line of whitespace between methods.\n* Capitalize initialisms and acronyms in names, except for the first word, which\n  should be lower-case:\n  * `getURI` instead of `getUri`\n  * `uriToOpen` instead of `URIToOpen`\n* Use `slice()` to copy an array\n* Add an explicit `return` when your function ends with a `for`/`while` loop and\n  you don't want it to return a collected array.\n* Use `this` instead of a standalone `@`\n  * `return this` instead of `return @`\n* Place requires in the following order:\n    * Built in Node Modules (such as `path`)\n    * Built in Atom and Electron Modules (such as `atom`, `remote`)\n    * Local Modules (using relative paths)\n* Place class properties in the following order:\n    * Class methods and properties (methods starting with a `@`)\n    * Instance methods and properties\n* [Avoid platform-dependent code](https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/cross-platform-compatibility/)\n\n### Specs Styleguide\n\n- Include thoughtfully-worded, well-structured [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) specs in the `./spec` folder.\n- Treat `describe` as a noun or situation.\n- Treat `it` as a statement about state or how an operation changes state.\n\n#### Example\n\n```coffee\ndescribe 'a dog', ->\n it 'barks', ->\n # spec here\n describe 'when the dog is happy', ->\n  it 'wags its tail', ->\n  # spec here\n```\n\n### Documentation Styleguide\n\n* Use [AtomDoc](https://github.com/atom/atomdoc).\n* Use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown).\n* Reference methods and classes in markdown with the custom `{}` notation:\n    * Reference classes with `{ClassName}`\n    * Reference instance methods with `{ClassName::methodName}`\n    * Reference class methods with `{ClassName.methodName}`\n\n#### Example\n\n```coffee\n# Public: Disable the package with the given name.\n#\n# * `name`    The {String} name of the package to disable.\n# * `options` (optional) The {Object} with disable options (default: {}):\n#   * `trackTime`     A {Boolean}, `true` to track the amount of time taken.\n#   * `ignoreErrors`  A {Boolean}, `true` to catch and ignore errors thrown.\n# * `callback` The {Function} to call after the package has been disabled.\n#\n# Returns `undefined`.\ndisablePackage: (name, options, callback) ->\n```\n\n## Additional Notes\n\n### Issue and Pull Request Labels\n\nThis section lists the labels we use to help us track and manage issues and pull requests. Most labels are used across all Atom repositories, but some are specific to `atom/atom`.\n\n[GitHub search](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/) makes it easy to use labels for finding groups of issues or pull requests you're interested in. For example, you might be interested in [open issues across `atom/atom` and all Atom-owned packages which are labeled as bugs, but still need to be reliably reproduced](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom+label%3Abug+label%3Aneeds-reproduction) or perhaps [open pull requests in `atom/atom` which haven't been reviewed yet](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+repo%3Aatom%2Fatom+comments%3A0). To help you find issues and pull requests, each label is listed with search links for finding open items with that label in `atom/atom` only and also across all Atom repositories. We  encourage you to read about [other search filters](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/) which will help you write more focused queries.\n\nThe labels are loosely grouped by their purpose, but it's not required that every issue has a label from every group or that an issue can't have more than one label from the same group.\n\nPlease open an issue on `atom/atom` if you have suggestions for new labels, and if you notice some labels are missing on some repositories, then please open an issue on that repository.\n\n#### Type of Issue and Issue State\n\n| Label name |

Learn more in our [official announcement](https://github.blog/2022-06-08-sunsetting-atom/)\n\nAtom is a hackable text editor for the 21st century, built on [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron), and based on everything we love about our favorite editors. We designed it to be deeply customizable, but still approachable using the default configuration.\n\n![Atom](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/378023/49132477-f4b77680-f31f-11e8-8357-ac6491761c6c.png)\n\n![Atom Screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/378023/49132478-f4b77680-f31f-11e8-9e10-e8454d8d9b7e.png)\n\nVisit [atom.io](https://atom.io) to learn more or visit the [Atom forum](https://github.com/atom/atom/discussions).\n\nFollow [@AtomEditor](https://twitter.com/atomeditor) on Twitter for important\nannouncements.\n\nThis project adheres to the Contributor Covenant [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\nBy participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to atom@github.com.\n\n## Documentation\n\nIf you want to read about using Atom or developing packages in Atom, the [Atom Flight Manual](https://flight-manual.atom.io) is free and available online. You can find the source to the manual in [atom/flight-manual.atom.io](https://github.com/atom/flight-manual.atom.io).\n\nThe [API reference](https://atom.io/docs/api) for developing packages is also documented on Atom.io.\n\n## Installing\n\n### Prerequisites\n- [Git](https://git-scm.com)\n\n### macOS\n\nDownload the latest [Atom release](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/latest).\n\nAtom will automatically update when a new release is available.\n\n### Windows\n\nDownload the latest [Atom installer](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/latest). `AtomSetup.exe` is 32-bit. For 64-bit systems, download `AtomSetup-x64.exe`.\n\nAtom will automatically update when a new release is available.\n\nYou can also download `atom-windows.zip` (32-bit) or `atom-x64-windows.zip` (64-bit) from the [releases page](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/latest).\nThe `.zip` version will not automatically update.\n\nUsing [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org)? Run `cinst Atom` to install the latest version of Atom.\n\n### Linux\n\nAtom is only available for 64-bit Linux systems.\n\nConfigure your distribution's package manager to install and update Atom by following the [Linux installation instructions](https://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/installing-atom/#platform-linux) in the Flight Manual.  You will also find instructions on how to install Atom's official Linux packages without using a package repository, though you will not get automatic updates after installing Atom this way.\n\n#### Archive extraction\n\nAn archive is available for people who don't want to install `atom` as root.\n\nThis version enables you to install multiple Atom versions in parallel. It has been built on Ubuntu 64-bit,\nbut should be compatible with other Linux distributions.\n\n1. Install dependencies (on Ubuntu):\n```sh\nsudo apt install git libasound2 libcurl4 libgbm1 libgcrypt20 libgtk-3-0 libnotify4 libnss3 libglib2.0-bin xdg-utils libx11-xcb1 libxcb-dri3-0 libxss1 libxtst6 libxkbfile1\n```\n2. Download `atom-amd64.tar.gz` from the [Atom releases page](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/latest).\n3. Run `tar xf atom-amd64.tar.gz` in the directory where you want to extract the Atom folder.\n4. Launch Atom using the installed `atom` command from the newly extracted directory.\n\nThe Linux version does not currently automatically update so you will need to\nrepeat these steps to upgrade to future releases.\n\n## Building\n\n* [Linux](https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/hacking-on-atom-core/#platform-linux)\n* [macOS](https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/hacking-on-atom-core/#platform-mac)\n* [Windows](https://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/hacking-on-atom-core/#platform-windows)\n\n## Discussion\n\n* Discuss Atom on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/atom/atom/discussions)\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/LICENSE.md)\n\nWhen using the Atom or other GitHub logos, be sure to follow the [GitHub logo guidelines](https://github.com/logos).\n"
