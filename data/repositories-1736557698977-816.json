          "content": "# How to contribute\n\nBug-fixes and features often come from users of the DGCharts framework, and improving it greatly. We want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute changes that improve the experience for users all around the world. There are a few guidelines that we\nneed contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on\ntop of things.\n\n## Simple issues and bug reports\n\nIf you are reporting a bug which can be observed visually, please add to your issue either:\n\n- Screenshots, if the bug is easily explainable\n- A working sample project that we can compile, run, and immediately observe the issue\n\n## Getting Started with Contributions\n\n- Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)\n- Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist.\n  - Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.\n  - Make sure you fill in the earliest version (or commit number) that you know has the issue.\n- Fork the repository on GitHub\n\n## Making Changes\n\n- Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work. This is usually the master branch.\n- Make commits of logical units.\n- Make sure your code conforms to the code style around it. It's easy, just look around!\n- If you have made changes back and forth, or have made merges, your commit history might look messy and hard to understand. A single issue or change should still be in one commit. So please squash those commits together and rebase them however you need to - to make our lives easier when reading it later.\n- Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.\n- Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format.\n\n```\n    First line must be up to 50 chars (Fixes #1234)\n\n    The first line should be a short statement as to what have changed, and should also include an issue number, prefixed with a hash.\n    The body of the message comes after an empty new line, and describes the changes\n    more thoroughly, especially if there was a special case handled there,\n    or maybe some trickery that only code wizards can understand.\n```\n\n- Make sure you have tested your changes well.\n- If your changes could theoretically affect some other component or case, which you do not necessarily use, you still have to test it.\n- Create a Pull Request from your topic branch to the relevant branch in the main repo. If you go to the main repo of the framework, you'll see a big green button which pretty much prepares the PR for you. You just have to hit it.\n\n## Making Trivial Changes\n\nFor changes of a trivial nature to comments and documentation, it is not\nalways necessary to create a new ticket. In this case, it is\nappropriate to start the first line of a commit with '(doc)' instead of\na ticket number. Even the default commit message the GitHub generates is fine with us.\n"

Charts has now been renamed DGCharts to prevent conflicts with Apple's new Swift Charts. Please read [the release/migration notes](https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts/releases/tag/5.0.0).\n\n### One more heads up: As Swift evolves, if you are not using the latest Swift compiler, you shouldn't check out the master branch. Instead, you should go to the release page and pick up whatever suits you.\n\n- Xcode 14 / Swift 5.7 (master branch)\n- iOS >= 12.0 (Use as an **Embedded** Framework)\n- tvOS >= 12.0\n- macOS >= 10.13\n\nOkay so there's this beautiful library called [MPAndroidChart](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart) by [Philipp Jahoda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philippjahoda) which has become very popular amongst Android developers, but there was no decent solution to create charts for iOS.\n\nI've chosen to write it in `Swift` as it can be highly optimized by the compiler, and can be used in both `Swift` and `ObjC` project. The demo project is written in `ObjC` to demonstrate how it works.\n\n**An amazing feature** of this library now, for Android, iOS, tvOS and macOS, is the time it saves you when developing for both platforms, as the learning curve is singleton- it happens only once, and the code stays very similar so developers don't have to go around and re-invent the app to produce the same output with a different library. (And that's not even considering the fact that there's not really another good choice out there currently...)\n\n## Having trouble running the demo?\n\n- `ChartsDemo/ChartsDemo.xcodeproj` is the demo project for iOS/tvOS\n- `ChartsDemo-OSX/ChartsDemo-OSX.xcodeproj` is the demo project for macOS\n- Make sure you are running a supported version of Xcode.\n  - Usually it is specified here a few lines above.\n  - In most cases it will be the latest Xcode version.\n- Make sure that your project supports Swift 5.0\n- Optional: Run `carthage checkout` in the project folder, to fetch dependencies (i.e testing dependencies).\n  - If you don't have Carthage - you can get it [here](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/releases).\n\n## Usage\n\nIn order to correctly compile:\n\n1. Drag the `DGCharts.xcodeproj` to your project\n2. Go to your target's settings, hit the \"+\" under the \"Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content\" section, and select the DGCharts.framework\n3. `@import DGCharts`\n4. When using Swift in an ObjC project:\n\n- You need to import your Bridging Header. Usually it is \"_YourProject-Swift.h_\", so in ChartsDemo it's \"_ChartsDemo-Swift.h_\". Do not try to actually include \"_ChartsDemo-Swift.h_\" in your project :-)\n- (Xcode 8.1 and earlier) Under \"Build Options\", mark \"Embedded Content Contains Swift Code\"\n- (Xcode 8.2+) Under \"Build Options\", mark \"Always Embed Swift Standard Libraries\"\n\n5. When using [Realm.io](https://realm.io/):\n   - Note that the Realm framework is not linked with Charts - it is only there for _optional_ bindings. Which means that you need to have the framework in your project, and in a compatible version to whatever is compiled with DGCharts. We will do our best to always compile against the latest version.\n   - You'll need to add `ChartsRealm` as a dependency too.\n\n## 3rd party tutorials\n\n#### Video tutorials\n\n- [Chart in Swift - Setting Up a Basic Line Chart Using iOS Charts(Alex Nagy)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWhwe_tLNE8&list=PL_csAAO9PQ8bjzg-wxEff1Fr0Y5W1hrum&index=5)\n- [Charts Framework in SwiftUI - Bar Chart (Stewart Lynch)](https://youtu.be/csd7pyfEXgw)\n\n#### Blog posts\n\n- [Using Realm and Charts with Swift 3 in iOS 10 (Sami Korpela)](https://medium.com/@skoli/using-realm-and-charts-with-swift-3-in-ios-10-40c42e3838c0#.2gyymwfh8)\n- [Creating a Line Chart in Swift 3 and iOS 10 (Osian Smith)](https://medium.com/@OsianSmith/creating-a-line-chart-in-swift-3-and-ios-10-2f647c95392e)\n- [Beginning Set-up and Example Using Charts with Swift 3](https://github.com/annalizhaz/ChartsForSwiftBasic)\n- [Creating a Radar Chart in Swift (David Piper)](https://medium.com/@HeyDaveTheDev/creating-a-radar-chart-in-swift-5791afcf92f0)\n- [Plotting in IOS using Charts framework with SwiftUI (Evgeny Basisty)](https://medium.com/@zzzzbh/plotting-in-ios-using-charts-framework-with-swiftui-222034a2bea6)\n- [Set Up a Basic Bar Chart Using iOS-Charts (Penny Huang)](https://medium.com/@penny-huang/swift-setting-up-a-basic-bar-chart-using-ios-charts-afd6aad96ac)\n- [iOS-Charts Tutorial: Highlight Selected Value With a Custom Marker (Penny Huang)](https://medium.com/@penny-huang/swift-ios-charts-tutorial-highlight-selected-value-with-a-custom-marker-30ccbf92aa1b)\n- [Drawing Charts in iOS Before SwiftUI (Gennady Stepanov)](https://medium.com/better-programming/drawing-charts-in-ios-before-swiftui-9f95b8612607)\n\nWant your tutorial to show here?
