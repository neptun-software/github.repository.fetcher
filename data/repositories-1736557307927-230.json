For releases prior to v6, please refer to the [Github Releases Page](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/releases).\n\nWe manage release notes in this file instead of the paginated Github Releases Page for 2 reasons:\n\n- Pagination in the Github UI means that you cannot easily search release notes for a large span of releases at once\n- The paginated Github interface also cuts off longer releases notes without indication in list view, and you need to click into the detail view to see the full set of release notes\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Table of Contents</summary>\n\n- [React Router Releases](#react-router-releases)\n  -

Fix for a crash when optional args are passed to the CLI ([#12609](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/12609))\n\n**Full Changelog**: [`v7.1.0...v7.1.1`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/react-router@7.1.0...react-router@7.1.1)\n\n## v7.1.0\n\nDate: 2024-12-20\n\n### Minor Changes\n\n- Add support for Vite v6 ([#12469](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/12469))\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- `react-router` - Throw unwrapped Single Fetch `redirect` to align with pre-Single Fetch behavior ([#12506](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/12506))\n- `react-router` - Ignore redirects when inferring loader data types ([#12527](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/12527))\n- `react-router` - Remove `<Link prefetch>` warning which suffers from false positives in a lazy route discovery world ([#12485](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/12485))\n- `create-react-router` - Fix missing `fs-extra` dependency ([#12556](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/12556))\n- `@react-router/dev`/`@react-router/serve` - Properly initialize `NODE_ENV` if not already set for compatibility with React 19 ([#12578](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/12578))\n- `@react-router/dev` - Remove the leftover/unused `abortDelay` prop from `ServerRouter` and update the default `entry.server.tsx` to use the new `streamTimeout` value for Single Fetch ([#12478](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/12478))\n  - The `abortDelay` functionality was removed in v7 as it was coupled to the `defer` implementation from Remix v2, but this removal of this prop was missed\n  - If you were still using this prop in your `entry.server` file, it's likely your app is not aborting streams as you would expect and you will need to adopt the new [`streamTimeout`](https://reactrouter.com/explanation/special-files#streamtimeout) value introduced with Single Fetch\n- `@react-router/fs-routes` - Throw error in `flatRoutes` if routes directory is missing ([#12407](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/12407))\n\n### Changes by Package\n\n- [`create-react-router`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/react-router%407.1.0/packages/create-react-router/CHANGELOG.md#710)\n- [`react-router`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/react-router%407.1.0/packages/react-router/CHANGELOG.md#710)\n- [`@react-router/architect`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/react-router%407.1.0/packages/react-router-architect/CHANGELOG.md#710)\n- [`@react-router/cloudflare`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/react-router%407.1.0/packages/react-router-cloudflare/CHANGELOG.md#710)\n- [`@react-router/dev`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/react-router%407.1.0/packages/react-router-dev/CHANGELOG.md#710)\n- [`@react-router/express`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/react-router%407.1.0/packages/react-router-express/CHANGELOG.md#710)\n- [`@react-router/fs-routes`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/react-router%407.1.0/packages/react-router-fs-routes/CHANGELOG.md#710)\n- [`@react-router/node`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/react-router%407.1.0/packages/react-router-node/CHANGELOG.md#710)\n- [`@react-router/remix-config-routes-adapter`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/react-router%407.1.0/packages/react-router-remix-config-routes-adapter/CHANGELOG.md#710)\n- [`@react-router/serve`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/react-router%407.1.0/packages/react-router-serve/CHANGELOG.md#710)\n\n**Full Changelog**: [`v7.0.2...v7.1.0`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/react-router@7.0.2...react-router@7.1.0)\n\n## v7.0.2\n\nDate: 2024-12-02\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- `react-router` - Temporarily only use one build in export map so packages can have a peer dependency on react router ([#12437](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/12437))\n- `@react-router/dev` - Support `moduleResolution` `Node16` and `NodeNext` ([#12440](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/12440))\n- `@react-router/dev` - Generate wide `matches` and `params` types for child routes ([#12397](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/12397))\n  - At runtime, `matches` includes child route matches and `params` include child route path parameters\n  - But previously, we only generated types for parent routes and the current route in `matches` and `params`\n  - To align our generated types more closely to the runtime behavior, we now generate more permissive, wider types when accessing child route information\n\n**Full Changelog**: [`v7.0.1...v7.0.2`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/react-router@7.0.1...react-router@7.0.2)\n\n## v7.0.1\n\nDate: 2024-11-22\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- `@react-router/dev` - Ensure typegen file watcher is cleaned up when Vite dev server restarts ([#12331](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/12331))\n- `@react-router/dev` - Pass route `error` to `ErrorBoundary` as a prop ([#12338](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/12338))\n\n**Full Changelog**: [`v7.0.0...v7.0.1`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/react-router@7.0.0...react-router@7.0.1)\n\n## v7.0.0\n\nDate: 2024-11-21\n\n### Breaking Changes\n\n#### Package Restructuring\n\n- The `react-router-dom`, `@remix-run/react`, `@remix-run/server-runtime`, and `@remix-run/router` have been collapsed into the `react-router` package\n  - To ease migration, `react-router-dom` is still published in v7 as a re-export of everything from `react-router`\n- The `@remix-run/cloudflare-pages` and `@remix-run/cloudflare-workers` have been collapsed into `@react-router/cloudflare` package`\n- The `react-router-dom-v5-compat` and `react-router-native` packages are removed starting with v7\n\n#### Removed Adapter Re-exports\n\nRemix v2 used to re-export all common `@remix-run/server-runtime` APIs through the various runtime packages (`node`, `cloudflare`, `deno`) so that you wouldn't need an additional `@remix-run/server-runtime` dependency in your `package.json`. With the collapsing of packages into `react-router`, these common APIs are now no longer re-exported through the runtime adapters. You should import all common APIs from `react-router`, and only import runtime-specific APIs from the runtime packages:\n\n```jsx\n// Runtime-specific APIs\nimport { createFileSessionStorage } from \"@react-router/node\";\n// Runtime-agnostic APIs\nimport { redirect, useLoaderData } from \"react-router\";\n```\n\n#### Removed APIs\n\nThe following APIs have been removed in React Router v7:\n\n- `json`\n- `defer`\n- `unstable_composeUploadHandlers`\n- `unstable_createMemoryUploadHandler`\n- `unstable_parseMultipartFormData`\n\n#### Minimum Versions\n\nReact Router v7 requires the following minimum versions:\n\n- `node@20`\n  - React Router no longer provides an `installGlobals` method to [polyfill](https://reactrouter.com/dev/guides/deploying/custom-node#polyfilling-fetch) the `fetch` API\n- `react@18`, `react-dom@18`\n\n#### Adopted Future Flag Behaviors\n\nRemix and React Router follow an [API Development Strategy](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/guides/api-development-strategy) leveraging \"Future Flags\" to avoid introducing a slew of breaking changes in a major release. Instead, breaking changes are introduced in minor releases behind a flag, allowing users to opt-in at their convenience. In the next major release, all future flag behaviors become the default behavior.\n\nThe following previously flagged behaviors are now the default in React Router v7:\n\n- [React Router v6 flags](https://reactrouter.com/en/v6/upgrading/future)\n  - `future.v7_relativeSplatPath`\n  - `future.v7_startTransition`\n  - `future.v7_fetcherPersist`\n  - `future.v7_normalizeFormMethod`\n  - `future.v7_partialHydration`\n  - `future.v7_skipActionStatusRevalidation`\n- [Remix v2 flags](https://remix.run/docs/en/v2/start/future-flags)\n  - `future.v3_fetcherPersist`\n  - `future.v3_relativeSplatPath`\n  - `future.v3_throwAbortReason`\n  - `future.v3_singleFetch`\n  - `future.v3_lazyRouteDiscovery`\n  - `future.v3_optimizeDeps`\n\n#### Vite Compiler\n\nThe [Remix Vite plugin](https://remix.run/docs/en/2.12.1/start/future-flags#vite-plugin) is the proper way to build full-stack SSR apps using React Router v7. The former `esbuild`-based compiler is no longer available.\n\n**Renamed `vitePlugin` and `cloudflareDevProxyVitePlugin`**\n\nFor Remix consumers migrating to React Router, the `vitePlugin` and `cloudflareDevProxyVitePlugin` exports have been renamed and moved ([#11904](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11904))\n\n```diff\n-import {\n-  vitePlugin as remix,\n-  cloudflareDevProxyVitePlugin,\n-} from \"@remix/dev\";\n\n+import { reactRouter } from \"@react-router/dev/vite\";\n+import { cloudflareDevProxy } from \"@react-router/dev/vite/cloudflare\";\n```\n\n**Removed `manifest` option**\n\nFor Remix consumers migrating to React Router, the Vite plugin's `manifest` option has been removed. The `manifest` option been superseded by the more powerful `buildEnd` hook since it's passed the `buildManifest` argument. You can still write the build manifest to disk if needed, but you'll most likely find it more convenient to write any logic depending on the build manifest within the `buildEnd` hook itself. ([#11573](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11573))\n\nIf you were using the `manifest` option, you can replace it with a `buildEnd` hook that writes the manifest to disk like this:\n\n```js\n// react-router.config.ts\nimport { type Config } from \"@react-router/dev/config\";\nimport { writeFile } from \"node:fs/promises\";\n\nexport default {\n  async buildEnd({ buildManifest }) {\n    await writeFile(\n      \"build/manifest.json\",\n      JSON.stringify(buildManifest, null, 2),\n      \"utf-8\"\n    );\n  },\n} satisfies Config;\n```\n\n#### Exposed Router Promises\n\nBecause React 19 will have first-class support for handling promises in the render pass (via `React.use` and `useAction`), we are now comfortable exposing the promises for the APIs that previously returned `undefined`:\n\n- `useNavigate()`\n- `useSubmit()`\n- `useFetcher().load`\n- `useFetcher().submit`\n- `useRevalidator().revalidate()`\n\n### Other Notable Changes\n\n#### `routes.ts`\n\nWhen using the React Router Vite plugin, routes are defined in `app/routes.ts`. Route config is exported via the `routes` export, conforming to the `RouteConfig` type. Route helper functions `route`, `index`, and `layout` are provided to make declarative type-safe route definitions easier.\n\n```ts\n// app/routes.ts\nimport {\n  type RouteConfig,\n  route,\n  index,\n  layout,\n} from \"@react-router/dev/routes\";\n\nexport const routes: RouteConfig = [\n  index(\"./home.tsx\"),\n  route(\"about\", \"./about.tsx\"),\n\n  layout(\"./auth/layout.tsx\", [\n    route(\"login\", \"./auth/login.tsx\"),\n    route(\"register\", \"./auth/register.tsx\"),\n  ]),\n\n  route(\"concerts\", [\n    index(\"./concerts/home.tsx\"),\n    route(\":city\", \"./concerts/city.tsx\"),\n    route(\"trending\", \"./concerts/trending.tsx\"),\n  ]),\n];\n```\n\nFor Remix consumers migrating to React Router, you can still configure file system routing within `routes.ts` using the `@react-router/fs-routes` package. A minimal route config that reproduces the default Remix setup looks like this:\n\n```ts\n// app/routes.ts\nimport { type RouteConfig } from \"@react-router/dev/routes\";\nimport { flatRoutes } from \"@react-router/fs-routes\";\n\nexport const routes: RouteConfig = flatRoutes();\n```\n\nIf you want to migrate from file system routing to config-based routes, you can mix and match approaches by spreading the results of the async `flatRoutes` function into the array of config-based routes.\n\n```ts\n// app/routes.ts\nimport { type RouteConfig, route } from \"@react-router/dev/routes\";\nimport { flatRoutes } from \"@react-router/fs-routes\";\n\nexport const routes: RouteConfig = [\n  // Example config-based route:\n  route(\"/hello\", \"./routes/hello.tsx\"),\n\n  // File system routes scoped to a different directory:\n  ...(await flatRoutes({\n    rootDirectory: \"fs-routes\",\n  })),\n];\n```\n\nIf you were using Remix's `routes` option to use alternative file system routing conventions, you can adapt these to the new `RouteConfig` format using `@react-router/remix-config-routes-adapter`.\n\nFor example, if you were using [Remix v1 route conventions](https://remix.run/docs/en/1.19.3/file-conventions/routes-files) in Remix v2, you can combine `@react-router/remix-config-routes-adapter` with `@remix-run/v1-route-convention` to adapt this to React Router:\n\n```ts\n// app/routes.ts\nimport { type RouteConfig } from \"@react-router/dev/routes\";\nimport { remixConfigRoutes } from \"@react-router/remix-config-routes-adapter\";\nimport { createRoutesFromFolders } from \"@remix-run/v1-route-convention\";\n\nexport const routes: RouteConfig = remixConfigRoutes(async (defineRoutes) => {\n  return createRoutesFromFolders(defineRoutes, {\n    ignoredFilePatterns: [\"**/.*\", \"**/*.css\"],\n  });\n});\n```\n\nAlso note that, if you were using Remix's `routes` option to define config-based routes, you can also adapt these to the new `RouteConfig` format using `@react-router/remix-config-routes-adapter` with minimal code changes. While this makes for a fast migration path, we recommend migrating any config-based routes from Remix to the new `RouteConfig` format since it's a fairly straightforward migration.\n\n```diff\n// app/routes.ts\n-import { type RouteConfig } from \"@react-router/dev/routes\";\n+import { type RouteConfig, route } from \"@react-router/dev/routes\";\n-import { remixConfigRoutes } from \"@react-router/remix-config-routes-adapter\";\n\n-export const routes: RouteConfig = remixConfigRoutes(async (defineRoutes) => {\n-  defineRoutes((route) => {\n-    route(\"/parent\", \"./routes/parent.tsx\", () => [\n-      route(\"/child\", \"./routes/child.tsx\"),\n-    ]);\n-  });\n-});\n+export const routes: RouteConfig = [\n+  route(\"/parent\", \"./routes/parent.tsx\", [\n+    route(\"/child\", \"./routes/child.tsx\"),\n+  ]),\n+];\n```\n\n#### Typesafety improvements\n\nReact Router now generates types for each of your route modules and passes typed props to route module component exports ([#11961](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11961), [#12019](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/12019)). You can access those types by importing them from `./+types/<route filename without extension>`.\n\nSee [_How To > Route Module Type Safety_](https://reactrouter.com/dev/how-to/route-module-type-safety) and [_Explanations > Type Safety_](https://reactrouter.com/dev/explanation/type-safety) for more details.\n\n#### Prerendering\n\nReact Router v7 includes a new `prerender` config in the vite plugin to support SSG use-cases. This will pre-render your `.html` and `.data` files at build time and so you can serve them statically at runtime from a running server or a CDN ([#11539](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11539))\n\n```ts\nexport default defineConfig({\n  plugins: [\n    reactRouter({\n      async prerender({ getStaticPaths }) {\n        let slugs = await fakeGetSlugsFromCms();\n        return [\n          ...getStaticPaths(),\n          ...slugs.map((slug) => `/product/${slug}`),\n        ];\n      },\n    }),\n    tsconfigPaths(),\n  ],\n});\n\nasync function fakeGetSlugsFromCms() {\n  await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 1000));\n  return [\"shirt\", \"hat\"];\n}\n```\n\n### Major Changes (`react-router`)\n\n- Remove the original `defer` implementation in favor of using raw promises via single fetch and `turbo-stream` ([#11744](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11744))\n  - This removes these exports from React Router:\n    - `defer`\n    - `AbortedDeferredError`\n    - `type TypedDeferredData`\n    - `UNSAFE_DeferredData`\n    - `UNSAFE_DEFERRED_SYMBOL`\n- Collapse packages into `react-router`([#11505](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11505))\n  - `@remix-run/router`\n  - `react-router-dom`\n  - `@remix-run/server-runtime`\n  - `@remix-run/testing`\n  - As a note, the `react-router-dom` package is maintained to ease adoption but it simply re-exports all APIs from `react-router`\n- Drop support for Node 16, React Router SSR now requires Node 18 or higher ([#11391](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11391), [#11690](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11690))\n- Remove `future.v7_startTransition` flag ([#11696](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11696))\n- Expose the underlying router promises from the following APIs for composition in React 19 APIs: ([#11521](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11521))\n- Remove `future.v7_normalizeFormMethod` future flag ([#11697](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11697))\n- Imports/Exports cleanup ([#11840](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11840))\n  - Removed the following exports that were previously public API from `@remix-run/router`\n    - types\n      - `AgnosticDataIndexRouteObject`\n      - `AgnosticDataNonIndexRouteObject`\n      - `AgnosticDataRouteMatch`\n      - `AgnosticDataRouteObject`\n      - `AgnosticIndexRouteObject`\n      - `AgnosticNonIndexRouteObject`\n      - `AgnosticRouteMatch`\n      - `AgnosticRouteObject`\n      - `TrackedPromise`\n      - `unstable_AgnosticPatchRoutesOnMissFunction`\n      - `Action` -> exported as `NavigationType` via `react-router`\n      - `Router` exported as `RemixRouter` to differentiate from RR's `<Router>`\n    - API\n      - `getToPathname` (`@private`)\n      - `joinPaths` (`@private`)\n      - `normalizePathname` (`@private`)\n      - `resolveTo` (`@private`)\n      - `stripBasename` (`@private`)\n      - `createBrowserHistory` -> in favor of `createBrowserRouter`\n      - `createHashHistory` -> in favor of `createHashRouter`\n      - `createMemoryHistory` -> in favor of `createMemoryRouter`\n      - `createRouter`\n      - `createStaticHandler` -> in favor of wrapper `createStaticHandler` in RR Dom\n      - `getStaticContextFromError`\n  - Removed the following exports that were previously public API from `react-router`\n    - `Hash`\n    - `Pathname`\n    - `Search`\n- Remove `future.v7_prependBasename` from the internalized `@remix-run/router` package ([#11726](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11726))\n- Remove `future.v7_throwAbortReason` from internalized `@remix-run/router` package ([#11728](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11728))\n- Add `exports` field to all packages ([#11675](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11675))\n- Renamed `RemixContext` to `FrameworkContext` ([#11705](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11705))\n- Update the minimum React version to 18 ([#11689](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11689))\n- `PrefetchPageDescriptor` replaced by `PageLinkDescriptor` ([#11960](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11960))\n- Remove the `future.v7_partialHydration` flag ([#11725](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11725))\n  - This also removes the `<RouterProvider fallbackElement>` prop\n    - To migrate, move the `fallbackElement` to a `hydrateFallbackElement`/`HydrateFallback` on your root route\n  - Also worth nothing there is a related breaking changer with this future flag:\n    - Without `future.v7_partialHydration` (when using `fallbackElement`), `state.navigation` was populated during the initial load\n    - With `future.v7_partialHydration`, `state.navigation` remains in an `\"idle\"` state during the initial load\n- Remove `future.v7_relativeSplatPath` future flag ([#11695](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11695))\n- Remove remaining future flags ([#11820](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11820))\n  - React Router `v7_skipActionErrorRevalidation`\n  - Remix `v3_fetcherPersist`, `v3_relativeSplatPath`, `v3_throwAbortReason`\n- Rename `createRemixStub` to `createRoutesStub` ([#11692](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11692))\n- Remove `@remix-run/router` deprecated `detectErrorBoundary` option in favor of `mapRouteProperties` ([#11751](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11751))\n- Add `react-router/dom` subpath export to properly enable `react-dom` as an optional `peerDependency` ([#11851](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11851))\n  - This ensures that we don't blindly `import ReactDOM from \"react-dom\"` in `<RouterProvider>` in order to access `ReactDOM.flushSync()`, since that would break `createMemoryRouter` use cases in non-DOM environments\n  - DOM environments should import from `react-router/dom` to get the proper component that makes `ReactDOM.flushSync()` available:\n    - If you are using the Vite plugin, use this in your `entry.client.tsx`:\n      - `import { HydratedRouter } from 'react-router/dom'`\n    - If you are not using the Vite plugin and are manually calling `createBrowserRouter`/`createHashRouter`:\n      - `import { RouterProvider } from \"react-router/dom\"`\n- Remove `future.v7_fetcherPersist` flag ([#11731](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11731))\n- Allow returning `undefined` from loaders and actions ([#11680](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11680), [#12057]([https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/1205))\n- Use `createRemixRouter`/`RouterProvider` in `entry.client` instead of `RemixBrowser` ([#11469](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11469))\n- Remove the deprecated `json` utility ([#12146](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/12146))\n  - You can use [`Response.json`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/json_static) if you still need to construct JSON responses in your app\n\n### Major Changes (`@react-router/*`)\n\n- Remove `future.v3_singleFetch` flag ([#11522](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11522))\n- Drop support for Node 16 and 18, update minimum Node version to 20 ([#11690](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11690), [#12171](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/12171))\n  - Remove `installGlobals()` as this should no longer be necessary\n- Add `exports` field to all packages ([#11675](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11675))\n- No longer re-export APIs from `react-router` through different runtime/adapter packages ([#11702](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11702))\n- For Remix consumers migrating to React Router, the `crypto` global from the [Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API) is now required when using cookie and session APIs\n  - This means that the following APIs are provided from `react-router` rather than platform-specific packages: ([#11837](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11837))\n    - `createCookie`\n    - `createCookieSessionStorage`\n    - `createMemorySessionStorage`\n    - `createSessionStorage`\n  - For consumers running older versions of Node, the `installGlobals` function from `@remix-run/node` has been updated to define `globalThis.crypto`, using [Node's `require('node:crypto').webcrypto` implementation](https://nodejs.org/api/webcrypto.html)\n  - Since platform-specific packages no longer need to implement this API, the following low-level APIs have been removed:\n    - `createCookieFactory`\n    - `createSessionStorageFactory`\n    - `createCookieSessionStorageFactory`\n    - `createMemorySessionStorageFactory`\n- Consolidate types previously duplicated across `@remix-run/router`, `@remix-run/server-runtime`, and `@remix-run/react` now that they all live in `react-router` ([#12177](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/12177))\n  - Examples: `LoaderFunction`, `LoaderFunctionArgs`, `ActionFunction`, `ActionFunctionArgs`, `DataFunctionArgs`, `RouteManifest`, `LinksFunction`, `Route`, `EntryRoute`\n  - The `RouteManifest` type used by the \"remix\" code is now slightly stricter because it is using the former `@remix-run/router` `RouteManifest`\n    - `Record<string, Route> -> Record<string, Route | undefined>`\n  - Removed `AppData` type in favor of inlining `unknown` in the few locations it was used\n  - Removed `ServerRuntimeMeta*` types in favor of the `Meta*` types they were duplicated from\n- Migrate Remix v2 type generics to React Router ([#12180](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/12180))\n  - These generics are provided for Remix v2 migration purposes\n  - These generics and the APIs they exist on should be considered informally deprecated in favor of the new `Route.*` types\n  - Anyone migrating from React Router v6 should probably not leverage these new generics and should migrate straight to the `Route.*` types\n  - For React Router v6 users, these generics are new and should not impact your app, with one exception\n    - `useFetcher` previously had an optional generic (used primarily by Remix v2) that expected the data type\n    - This has been updated in v7 to expect the type of the function that generates the data (i.e., `typeof loader`/`typeof action`)\n    - Therefore, you should update your usages:\n      - ❌ `useFetcher<LoaderData>()`\n      - ✅ `useFetcher<typeof loader>()`\n- Update `cookie` dependency to `^1.0.1` - please see the [release notes](https://github.com/jshttp/cookie/releases) for any breaking changes ([#12172](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/12172))\n- `@react-router/cloudflare` - For Remix consumers migrating to React Router, all exports from `@remix-run/cloudflare-pages` are now provided for React Router consumers in the `@react-router/cloudflare` package. There is no longer a separate package for Cloudflare Pages. ([#11801](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11801))\n- `@react-router/cloudflare` - The `@remix-run/cloudflare-workers` package has been deprecated. Remix consumers migrating to React Router should use the `@react-router/cloudflare` package directly. For guidance on how to use `@react-router/cloudflare` within a Cloudflare Workers context, refer to the Cloudflare Workers template. ([#11801](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11801))\n- `@react-router/dev` - For Remix consumers migrating to React Router, the `vitePlugin` and `cloudflareDevProxyVitePlugin` exports have been renamed and moved. ([#11904](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11904))\n- `@react-router/dev` - For Remix consumers migrating to React Router who used the Vite plugin's `buildEnd` hook, the resolved `reactRouterConfig` object no longer contains a `publicPath` property since this belongs to Vite, not React Router ([#11575](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11575))\n- `@react-router/dev` - For Remix consumers migrating to React Router, the Vite plugin's `manifest` option has been removed ([#11573](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11573))\n- `@react-router/dev` - Update default `isbot` version to v5 and drop support for `isbot@3` ([#11770](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11770))\n  - If you have `isbot@4` or `isbot@5` in your `package.json`:\n    - You do not need to make any changes\n  - If you have `isbot@3` in your `package.json` and you have your own `entry.server.tsx` file in your repo\n    - You do not need to make any changes\n    - You can upgrade to `isbot@5` independent of the React Router v7 upgrade\n  - If you have `isbot@3` in your `package.json` and you do not have your own `entry.server.tsx` file in your repo\n    - You are using the internal default entry provided by React Router v7 and you will need to upgrade to `isbot@5` in your `package.json`\n- `@react-router/dev` - For Remix consumers migrating to React Router, Vite manifests (i.e. `.vite/manifest.json`) are now written within each build subdirectory, e.g. `build/client/.vite/manifest.json` and `build/server/.vite/manifest.json` instead of `build/.vite/client-manifest.json` and `build/.vite/server-manifest.json`. This means that the build output is now much closer to what you'd expect from a typical Vite project. ([#11573](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11573))\n  - Originally the Remix Vite plugin moved all Vite manifests to a root-level `build/.vite` directory to avoid accidentally serving them in production, particularly from the client build. This was later improved with additional logic that deleted these Vite manifest files at the end of the build process unless Vite's `build.manifest` had been enabled within the app's Vite config. This greatly reduced the risk of accidentally serving the Vite manifests in production since they're only present when explicitly asked for. As a result, we can now assume that consumers will know that they need to manage these additional files themselves, and React Router can safely generate a more standard Vite build output.\n\n### Minor Changes\n\n- `react-router` - Params, loader data, and action data as props for route component exports ([#11961](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11961))\n- `react-router` - Add route module type generation ([#12019](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/12019))\n- `react-router` - Remove duplicate `RouterProvider` implementations ([#11679](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11679))\n- `react-router` - Stabilize `unstable_dataStrategy` ([#11969](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11969))\n- `react-router` - Stabilize `unstable_patchRoutesOnNavigation` ([#11970](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11970))\n- `react-router` - Add prefetching support to `Link`/`NavLink` when using Remix SSR ([#11402](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11402))\n- `react-router` - Enhance `ScrollRestoration` so it can restore properly on an SSR'd document load ([#11401](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11401))\n- `@react-router/dev` - Add support for the `prerender` config in the React Router vite plugin, to support existing SSG use-cases ([#11539](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11539))\n- `@react-router/dev` - Remove internal `entry.server.spa.tsx` implementation which was not compatible with the Single Fetch async hydration approach ([#11681](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11681))\n- `@react-router/serve`: Update `express.static` configurations to support new `prerender` API ([#11547](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11547))\n  - Assets in the `build/client/assets` folder are served as before, with a 1-year immutable `Cache-Control` header\n  - Static files outside of assets, such as pre-rendered `.html` and `.data` files are not served with a specific `Cache-Control` header\n  - `.data` files are served with `Content-Type: text/x-turbo`\n    - For some reason, when adding this via `express.static`, it seems to also add a `Cache-Control: public, max-age=0` to `.data` files\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- Replace `substr` with `substring` ([#12080](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/12080))\n- `react-router` - Fix redirects returned from loaders/actions using `data()` ([#12021](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/12021))\n- `@react-router/dev` - Enable prerendering for resource routes ([#12200](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/12200))\n- `@react-router/dev` - resolve config directory relative to flat output file structure ([#12187](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/12187))\n\n### Changes by Package\n\n- [`react-router`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/react-router%407.0.0/packages/react-router/CHANGELOG.md#700)\n- [`@react-router/architect`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/react-router%407.0.0/packages/react-router-architect/CHANGELOG.md#700)\n- [`@react-router/cloudflare`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/react-router%407.0.0/packages/react-router-cloudflare/CHANGELOG.md#700)\n- [`@react-router/dev`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/react-router%407.0.0/packages/react-router-dev/CHANGELOG.md#700)\n- [`@react-router/express`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/react-router%407.0.0/packages/react-router-express/CHANGELOG.md#700)\n- [`@react-router/fs-routes`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/react-router%407.0.0/packages/react-router-fs-routes/CHANGELOG.md#700)\n- [`@react-router/node`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/react-router%407.0.0/packages/react-router-node/CHANGELOG.md#700)\n- [`@react-router/remix-config-routes-adapter`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/react-router%407.0.0/packages/react-router-remix-config-routes-adapter/CHANGELOG.md#700)\n- [`@react-router/serve`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/react-router%407.0.0/packages/react-router-serve/CHANGELOG.md#700)\n\n**Full Changelog**: [`v6.28.0...v7.0.0`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/react-router@6.28.0...react-router@7.0.0)\n\n## v6.28.1\n\nDate: 2024-12-20\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- Allow users to opt out of v7 deprecation warnings by setting flags to `false` ([#12441](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/12441))\n\n**Full Changelog**: [`v6.28.0...v6.28.1`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/react-router@6.28.0...react-router@6.28.1)\n\n## v6.28.0\n\nDate: 2024-11-06\n\n### What's Changed\n\n- In preparation for v7 we've added deprecation warnings for any future flags that you have not yet opted into.

Add new `PatchRoutesOnNavigationFunctionArgs` type for convenience ([#11967](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11967))\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- Fix bug when submitting to the current contextual route (parent route with an index child) when an `?index` param already exists from a prior submission ([#12003](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/12003))\n- Fix `useFormAction` bug - when removing `?index` param it would not keep other non-Remix `index` params ([#12003](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/12003))\n- Fix bug with fetchers not persisting `preventScrollReset` through redirects during concurrent fetches ([#11999](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11999))\n- Avoid unnecessary `console.error` on fetcher abort due to back-to-back revalidation calls ([#12050](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/12050))\n- Fix bugs with `partialHydration` when hydrating with errors ([#12070](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/12070))\n- Remove internal cache to fix issues with interrupted `patchRoutesOnNavigation` calls ([#12055](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/12055))\n  - ⚠️ This may be a breaking change if you were relying on this behavior in the `unstable_` API\n  - We used to cache in-progress calls to `patchRoutesOnNavigation` internally so that multiple navigations with the same start/end would only execute the function once and use the same promise\n  - However, this approach was at odds with `patch` short circuiting if a navigation was interrupted (and the `request.signal` aborted) since the first invocation's `patch` would no-op\n  - This cache also made some assumptions as to what a valid cache key might be - and is oblivious to any other application-state changes that may have occurred\n  - So, the cache has been removed because in _most_ cases, repeated calls to something like `import()` for async routes will already be cached automatically - and if not it's easy enough for users to implement this cache in userland\n- Remove internal `discoveredRoutes` FIFO queue from `unstable_patchRoutesOnNavigation` ([#11977](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11977))\n  - ⚠️ This may be a breaking change if you were relying on this behavior in the `unstable_` API\n  - This was originally implemented as an optimization but it proved to be a bit too limiting\n  - If you need this optimization you can implement your own cache inside `patchRoutesOnNavigation`\n- Fix types for `RouteObject` within `PatchRoutesOnNavigationFunction`'s `patch` method so it doesn't expect agnostic route objects passed to `patch` ([#11967](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11967))\n- Expose errors thrown from `patchRoutesOnNavigation` directly to `useRouteError` instead of wrapping them in a 400 `ErrorResponse` instance ([#12111](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/12111))\n\n**Full Changelog**: [`v6.26.2...v6.27.0`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/react-router@6.26.2...react-router@6.27.0)\n\n## v6.26.2\n\nDate: 2024-09-09\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- Update the `unstable_dataStrategy` API to allow for more advanced implementations ([#11943](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11943))\n  - ⚠️ If you have already adopted `unstable_dataStrategy`, please review carefully as this includes breaking changes to this API\n  - Rename `unstable_HandlerResult` to `unstable_DataStrategyResult`\n  - Change the return signature of `unstable_dataStrategy` from a parallel array of `unstable_DataStrategyResult[]` (parallel to `matches`) to a key/value object of `routeId => unstable_DataStrategyResult`\n    - This allows more advanced control over revalidation behavior because you can opt-into or out-of revalidating data that may not have been revalidated by default (via `match.shouldLoad`)\n  - You should now return/throw a result from your `handlerOverride` instead of returning a `DataStrategyResult`\n    - The return value (or thrown error) from your `handlerOverride` will be wrapped up into a `DataStrategyResult` and returned fromm `match.resolve`\n    - Therefore, if you are aggregating the results of `match.resolve()` into a final results object you should not need to think about the `DataStrategyResult` type\n    - If you are manually filling your results object from within your `handlerOverride`, then you will need to assign a `DataStrategyResult` as the value so React Router knows if it's a successful execution or an error (see examples in the documentation for details)\n  - Added a new `fetcherKey` parameter to `unstable_dataStrategy` to allow differentiation from navigational and fetcher calls\n- Preserve opted-in view transitions through redirects ([#11925](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11925))\n- Preserve pending view transitions through a router revalidation call ([#11917](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11917))\n- Fix blocker usage when `blocker.proceed` is called quickly/synchronously ([#11930](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11930))\n\n**Full Changelog**: [`v6.26.1...v6.26.2`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/react-router@6.26.1...react-router@6.26.2)\n\n## v6.26.1\n\nDate: 2024-08-15\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- Rename `unstable_patchRoutesOnMiss` to `unstable_patchRoutesOnNavigation` to match new behavior ([#11888](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11888))\n- Update `unstable_patchRoutesOnNavigation` logic so that we call the method when we match routes with dynamic param or splat segments in case there exists a higher-scoring static route that we've not yet discovered ([#11883](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11883))\n  - We also now leverage an internal FIFO queue of previous paths we've already called `unstable_patchRoutesOnNavigation` against so that we don't re-call on subsequent navigations to the same path\n\n**Full Changelog**: [`v6.26.0...v6.26.1`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/react-router@6.26.0...react-router@6.26.1)\n\n## v6.26.0\n\nDate: 2024-08-01\n\n### Minor Changes\n\n- Add a new `replace(url, init?)` alternative to `redirect(url, init?)` that performs a `history.replaceState` instead of a `history.pushState` on client-side navigation redirects ([#11811](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11811))\n- Add a new `unstable_data()` API for usage with Remix Single Fetch ([#11836](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11836))\n  - This API is not intended for direct usage in React Router SPA applications\n  - It is primarily intended for usage with `createStaticHandler.query()` to allow loaders/actions to return arbitrary data along with custom `status`/`headers` without forcing the serialization of data into a `Response` instance\n  - This allows for more advanced serialization tactics via `unstable_dataStrategy` such as serializing via `turbo-stream` in Remix Single Fetch\n  - ⚠️ This removes the `status` field from `HandlerResult`\n    - If you need to return a specific `status` from `unstable_dataStrategy` you should instead do so via `unstable_data()`\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- Fix internal cleanup of interrupted fetchers to avoid invalid revalidations on navigations ([#11839](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11839))\n- Fix initial hydration behavior when using `future.v7_partialHydration` along with `unstable_patchRoutesOnMiss` ([#11838](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11838))\n  - During initial hydration, `router.state.matches` will now include any partial matches so that we can render ancestor `HydrateFallback` components\n\n**Full Changelog**: [`v6.25.1...v6.26.0`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/react-router@6.25.1...react-router@6.26.0)\n\n## v6.25.1\n\nDate: 2024-07-17\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- Memoize some `RouterProvider` internals to reduce unnecessary re-renders ([#11803](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11803))\n\n**Full Changelog**: [`v6.25.0...v6.25.1`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/react-router@6.25.0...react-router@6.25.1)\n\n## v6.25.0\n\nDate: 2024-07-16\n\n### What's Changed\n\n#### Stabilized `v7_skipActionErrorRevalidation`\n\nThis release stabilizes the `future.unstable_skipActionErrorRevalidation` flag into [`future.v7_skipActionErrorRevalidation`](https://reactrouter.com/v6/upgrading/future#v7_skipactionstatusrevalidation) in preparation for the upcoming React Router v7 release.\n\n- When this flag is enabled, actions that return/throw a `4xx/5xx` `Response` will not trigger a revalidation by default\n- This also stabilizes `shouldRevalidate`'s `unstable_actionStatus` parameter to `actionStatus`\n\n### Minor Changes\n\n- Stabilize `future.unstable_skipActionErrorRevalidation` as `future.v7_skipActionErrorRevalidation` ([#11769](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11769))\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- Fix regression and properly decode paths inside `useMatch` so matches/params reflect decoded params ([#11789](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11789))\n- Fix bubbling of errors thrown from `unstable_patchRoutesOnMiss` ([#11786](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11786))\n- Fix hydration in SSR apps using `unstable_patchRoutesOnMiss` that matched a splat route on the server ([#11790](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11790))\n\n**Full Changelog**: [`v6.24.1...v6.25.0`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/react-router@6.24.1...react-router@6.25.0)\n\n## v6.24.1\n\nDate: 2024-07-03\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- Remove `polyfill.io` reference from warning message because the domain was sold and has since been determined to serve malware ([#11741](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11741))\n  - See https://sansec.io/research/polyfill-supply-chain-attack\n- Export `NavLinkRenderProps` type for easier typing of custom `NavLink` callback ([#11553](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11553))\n- When using `future.v7_relativeSplatPath`, properly resolve relative paths in splat routes that are children of pathless routes ([#11633](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11633))\n- Fog of War (unstable): Trigger a new `router.routes` identity/reflow during route patching ([#11740](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11740))\n- Fog of War (unstable): Fix initial matching when a splat route matches ([#11759](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11759))\n\n**Full Changelog**: [`v6.24.0...v6.24.1`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/react-router@6.24.0...react-router@6.24.1)\n\n## v6.24.0\n\nDate: 2024-06-24\n\n### What's Changed\n\n#### Lazy Route Discovery (a.k.a. \"Fog of War\")\n\nWe're really excited to release our new API for \"Lazy Route Discovery\" in `v6.24.0`! For some background information, please check out the original [RFC](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/discussions/11113). The **tl;dr;** is that ever since we introduced the Data APIs in v6.4 via `<RouterProvider>`, we've been a little bummed that one of the tradeoffs was the lack of a compelling code-splitting story mirroring what we had in the `<BrowserRouter>`/`<Routes>` apps. We took a baby-step towards improving that story with `route.lazy` in `v6.9.0`, but with `v6.24.0` we've gone the rest of the way.\n\nWith \"Fog of War\", you can now load portions of the route tree lazily via the new `unstable_patchRoutesOnMiss` option passed to `createBrowserRouter` (and it's memory/hash counterparts). This gives you a way to hook into spots where React Router is unable to match a given path and patch new routes into the route tree during the navigation (or fetcher call).\n\nHere's a very small example, but please refer to the [documentation](https://reactrouter.com/v6/routers/create-browser-router#optsunstable_patchroutesonmiss) for more information and use cases:\n\n```js\nconst router = createBrowserRouter(\n  [\n    {\n      id: \"root\",\n      path: \"/\",\n      Component: RootComponent,\n    },\n  ],\n  {\n    async unstable_patchRoutesOnMiss({ path, patch }) {\n      if (path === \"/a\") {\n        // Load the `a` route (`{ path: 'a', Component: A }`)\n        let route = await getARoute();\n        // Patch the `a` route in as a new child of the `root` route\n        patch(\"root\", [route]);\n      }\n    },\n  }\n);\n```\n\n### Minor Changes\n\n- Add support for Lazy Route Discovery (a.k.a. \"Fog of War\") ([#11626](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11626))\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- Fix `fetcher.submit` types - remove incorrect `navigate`/`fetcherKey`/`unstable_viewTransition` options because they are only relevant for `useSubmit` ([#11631](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11631))\n- Allow falsy `location.state` values passed to `<StaticRouter>` ([#11495](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11495))\n\n**Full Changelog**: [`v6.23.1...v6.24.0`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/react-router@6.23.1...react-router@6.24.0)\n\n## v6.23.1\n\nDate: 2024-05-10\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- Allow `undefined` to be resolved through `<Await>` ([#11513](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11513))\n- Add defensive `document` check when checking for `document.startViewTransition` availability ([#11544](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11544))\n- Change the `react-router-dom/server` import back to `react-router-dom` instead of `index.ts` ([#11514](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11514))\n- `@remix-run/router` - Support `unstable_dataStrategy` on `staticHandler.queryRoute` ([#11515](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11515))\n\n**Full Changelog**: [`v6.23.0...v6.23.1`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/react-router@6.23.0...react-router@6.23.1)\n\n## v6.23.0\n\nDate: 2024-04-23\n\n### What's Changed\n\n#### Data Strategy (unstable)\n\nThe new `unstable_dataStrategy` API is a low-level API designed for advanced use-cases where you need to take control over the data strategy for your `loader`/`action` functions. The default implementation is today's behavior, to fetch all loaders in parallel, but this option allows users to implement more advanced data flows including Remix [\"Single Fetch\"](https://remix.run/docs/guides/single-fetch), user-land middleware/context APIs, automatic loader caching, and more. Please see the [docs](https://reactrouter.com/v6/routers/create-browser-router#unstable_datastrategy) for more information.\n\n**Note:** This is a low-level API intended for advanced use-cases. This overrides React Router's internal handling of `loader`/`action` execution, and if done incorrectly will break your app code. Please use with caution and perform the appropriate testing.\n\n#### Skip Action Error Revalidation (unstable)\n\nCurrently, all active `loader`'s revalidate after any `action` submission, regardless of the `action` result. However, in the majority of cases a `4xx`/`5xx` response from an `action` means that no data was actually changed and the revalidation is unnecessary. We've introduced a new `future.unstable_skipActionErrorRevalidation` flag that changes the behavior here, and we plan to make this the default in future version of React Router.\n\nWith this flag enabled, `action`'s that return/throw a `4xx`/`5xx` response status will no longer automatically revalidate. If you need to revalidate after a `4xx`/`5xx` result with this flag enabled, you can still do that via returning `true` from `shouldRevalidate` - which now also receives a new `unstable_actionStatus` argument alongside `actionResult` so you can make decision based on the status of the `action` response without having to encode it into the action data.\n\n### Minor Changes\n\n- Add a new `unstable_dataStrategy` configuration option ([#11098](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11098), [#11377](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11377))\n- `@remix-run/router` - Add a new `future.unstable_skipActionRevalidation` future flag ([#11098](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11098))\n- `@remix-run/router` - SSR: Added a new `skipLoaderErrorBubbling` options to the `staticHandler.query` method to disable error bubbling by the static handler for use in Remix's Single Fetch implementation ([#11098](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11098), ([#11377](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11377)))\n\n**Full Changelog**: [`v6.22.3...v6.23.0`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/react-router@6.22.3...react-router@6.23.0)\n\n## v6.22.3\n\nDate: 2024-03-07\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- Fix a `future.v7_partialHydration` bug that would re-run loaders below the boundary on hydration if SSR loader errors bubbled to a parent boundary ([#11324](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11324))\n- Fix a `future.v7_partialHydration` bug that would consider the router uninitialized if a route did not have a loader ([#11325](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11325))\n\n**Full Changelog**: [`v6.22.2...v6.22.3`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/react-router@6.22.2...react-router@6.22.3)\n\n## v6.22.2\n\nDate: 2024-02-28\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- Preserve hydrated errors during partial hydration runs ([#11305](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11305))\n\n**Full Changelog**: [`v6.22.1...v6.22.2`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/react-router@6.22.1...react-router@6.22.2)\n\n## v6.22.1\n\nDate: 2024-02-16\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- Fix encoding/decoding issues with pre-encoded dynamic parameter values ([#11199](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11199))\n\n**Full Changelog**: [`v6.22.0...v6.22.1`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/react-router@6.22.0...react-router@6.22.1)\n\n## v6.22.0\n\nDate: 2024-02-01\n\n### What's Changed\n\n#### Core Web Vitals Technology Report Flag\n\nIn 2021, the HTTP Archive launched the [Core Web Vitals Technology Report dashboard](https://discuss.httparchive.org/t/new-dashboard-the-core-web-vitals-technology-report/2178):\n\n> By combining the powers of real-user experiences in the Chrome UX Report 26 (CrUX) dataset with web technology detections in HTTP Archive 30, we can get a glimpse into how architectural decisions like choices of CMS platform or JavaScript framework play a role in sites’ CWV performance.\n\nThey use a tool called [`wappalyzer`](https://github.com/HTTPArchive/wappalyzer) to identify what technologies a given website is using by looking for certain scripts, global JS variables, or other identifying characteristics. For example, for Remix applications, they [look for the global `__remixContext`](https://github.com/HTTPArchive/wappalyzer/blob/c2a24ee7c2d07bf9c521f02584ae2dcf603ac0b7/src/technologies/r.json#L1328) variable to identify that a website is using Remix.\n\nIt was brought to our attention that React Router was unable to be reliably identified because there are no identifying global aspects. They are currently [looking for external scripts with `react-router`](https://github.com/HTTPArchive/wappalyzer/blob/c2a24ee7c2d07bf9c521f02584ae2dcf603ac0b7/src/technologies/r.json#L637) in the name. This will identify sites using React Router from a CDN such as `unpkg` - but it will miss the **vast** majority of sites that are installing React Router from the npm registry and bundling it into their JS files. This results in [drastically under-reporting](https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/pixHkNmGbN4) the usage of React Router on the web.\n\nStarting with version `6.22.0`, sites using `react-router-dom` will begin adding a `window.__reactRouterVersion` variable that will be set to a string value of the SemVer major version number (i.e., `window.__reactRouterVersion = \"6\";`) so that they can be properly identified.\n\n### Minor Changes\n\n- Include a `window.__reactRouterVersion` for CWV Report detection ([#11222](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11222))\n- Add a `createStaticHandler` `future.v7_throwAbortReason` flag to throw `request.signal.reason` (defaults to a `DOMException`) when a request is aborted instead of an `Error` such as `new Error(\"query() call aborted: GET /path\")` ([#11104](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11104))\n  - Please note that `DOMException` was added in Node v17 so you will not get a `DOMException` on Node 16 and below.\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- Respect the `ErrorResponse` status code if passed to `getStaticContextFormError` ([#11213](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11213))\n\n**Full Changelog**: [`v6.21.3...v6.22.0`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/react-router@6.21.3...react-router@6.22.0)\n\n## v6.21.3\n\nDate: 2024-01-18\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- Fix `NavLink` `isPending` when a `basename` is used ([#11195](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11195))\n- Remove leftover `unstable_` prefix from `Blocker`/`BlockerFunction` types ([#11187](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11187))\n\n**Full Changelog**: [`v6.21.2...v6.21.3`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/react-router@6.21.2...react-router@6.21.3)\n\n## v6.21.2\n\nDate: 2024-01-11\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- Leverage `useId` for internal fetcher keys when available ([#11166](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11166))\n- Fix bug where dashes were not picked up in dynamic parameter names ([#11160](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11160))\n- Do not attempt to deserialize empty JSON responses ([#11164](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11164))\n\n**Full Changelog**: [`v6.21.1...v6.21.2`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/react-router@6.21.1...react-router@6.21.2)\n\n## v6.21.1\n\nDate: 2023-12-21\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- Fix bug with `route.lazy` not working correctly on initial SPA load when `v7_partialHydration` is specified ([#11121](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11121))\n- Fix bug preventing revalidation from occurring for persisted fetchers unmounted during the `submitting` phase ([#11102](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11102))\n- De-dup relative path logic in `resolveTo` ([#11097](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11097))\n\n**Full Changelog**: [`v6.21.0...v6.21.1`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/react-router@6.21.0...react-router@6.21.1)\n\n## v6.21.0\n\nDate: 2023-12-13\n\n### What's Changed\n\n#### `future.v7_relativeSplatPath`\n\nWe fixed a splat route path-resolution bug in `6.19.0`, but later determined a large number of applications were relying on the buggy behavior, so we reverted the fix in `6.20.1` (see [#10983](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/10983), [#11052](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/11052), [#11078](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/11078)).\n\nThe buggy behavior is that the default behavior when resolving relative paths inside a splat route would _ignore_ any splat (`*`) portion of the current route path. When the future flag is enabled, splat portions are included in relative path logic within splat routes.\n\nFor more information, please refer to the [`useResolvedPath` docs](https://reactrouter.com/v6/hooks/use-resolved-path#splat-paths) and/or the [detailed changelog entry](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/main/packages/react-router-dom/CHANGELOG.md#6210).\n\n#### Partial Hydration\n\nWe added a new `future.v7_partialHydration` future flag for the `@remix-run/router` that enables partial hydration of a data router when Server-Side Rendering. This allows you to provide `hydrationData.loaderData` that has values for _some_ initially matched route loaders, but not all. When this flag is enabled, the router will call `loader` functions for routes that do not have hydration loader data during `router.initialize()`, and it will render down to the deepest provided `HydrateFallback` (up to the first route without hydration data) while it executes the unhydrated routes. ([#11033](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11033))\n\n### Minor Changes\n\n- Add a new `future.v7_relativeSplatPath` flag to implement a breaking bug fix to relative routing when inside a splat route. ([#11087](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11087))\n- Add a new `future.v7_partialHydration` future flag that enables partial hydration of a data router when Server-Side Rendering ([#11033](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11033))\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- Properly handle falsy error values in `ErrorBoundary`'s ([#11071](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11071))\n- Catch and bubble errors thrown when trying to unwrap responses from `loader`/`action` functions ([#11061](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11061))\n- Fix `relative=\"path\"` issue when rendering `Link`/`NavLink` outside of matched routes ([#11062](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11062))\n\n**Full Changelog**: [`v6.20.1...v6.21.0`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/react-router@6.20.1...react-router@6.21.0)\n\n## v6.20.1\n\nDate: 2023-12-01\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- Revert the `useResolvedPath` fix for splat routes due to a large number of applications that were relying on the buggy behavior (see [#11052](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/11052#issuecomment-1836589329)) ([#11078](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11078))\n  - We plan to re-introduce this fix behind a future flag in the next minor version (see [this comment](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/11052#issuecomment-1836589329))\n  - This fix was included in versions `6.19.0` and `6.20.0`.

([#10983](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10983))\n  - ⚠️ This fixes a quite long-standing bug specifically for `\".\"` paths inside a splat route which incorrectly dropped the splat portion of the URL. If you are relative routing via `\".\"` inside a splat route in your application you should double check that your logic is not relying on this buggy behavior and update accordingly.\n- Fix issue where a changing fetcher `key` in a `useFetcher` that remains mounted wasn't getting picked up ([#11009](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11009))\n- Fix `useFormAction` which was incorrectly inheriting the `?index` query param from child route `action` submissions ([#11025](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11025))\n- Fix `NavLink` `active` logic when `to` location has a trailing slash ([#10734](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10734))\n- Fix types so `unstable_usePrompt` can accept a `BlockerFunction` in addition to a `boolean` ([#10991](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10991))\n- Fix `relative=\"path\"` bug where relative path calculations started from the full location pathname, instead of from the current contextual route pathname.

Instead of being immediately cleaned up on unmount, fetchers will persist until they return to an `idle` state. This makes pending/optimistic UI _much_ easier in scenarios where the originating fetcher needs to unmount.\n\n- This is sort of a long-standing bug fix as the `useFetchers()` API was always supposed to only reflect **in-flight** fetcher information for pending/optimistic UI -- it was not intended to reflect fetcher data or hang onto fetchers after they returned to an `idle` state\n- Keep an eye out for the following specific behavioral changes when opting into this flag and check your app for compatibility:\n  - Fetchers that complete _while still mounted_ will no longer appear in `useFetchers()` after completion - they served no purpose in there since you can access the data via `useFetcher().data`\n  - Fetchers that previously unmounted _while in-flight_ will not be immediately aborted and will instead be cleaned up once they return to an `idle` state\n    - They will remain exposed via `useFetchers` while in-flight so you can still access pending/optimistic data after unmount\n    - If a fetcher is no longer mounted when it completes, then it's result will not be post processed - e.g., redirects will not be followed and errors will not bubble up in the UI\n    - However, if a fetcher was re-mounted elsewhere in the tree using the same `key`, then it's result will be processed, even if the originating fetcher was unmounted\n\n### Minor Changes\n\n- Add fetcher `key` APIs and `navigate=false` options ([#10960](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10960))\n- Add `future.v7_fetcherPersist` flag ([#10962](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10962))\n- Add support for optional path segments in `matchPath` ([#10768](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10768))\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- Fix the `future` prop on `BrowserRouter`, `HashRouter` and `MemoryRouter` so that it accepts a `Partial<FutureConfig>` instead of requiring all flags to be included ([#10962](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10962))\n- Fix `router.getFetcher`/`router.deleteFetcher` type definitions which incorrectly specified `key` as an optional parameter ([#10960](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10960))\n\n**Full Changelog**: [`6.17.0...6.18.0`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/react-router@6.17.0...react-router@6.18.0)\n\n## v6.17.0\n\nDate: 2023-10-16\n\n### What's Changed\n\n#### View Transitions 🚀\n\nWe're excited to release experimental support for the [View Transitions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ViewTransition) in React Router! You can now trigger navigational DOM updates to be wrapped in `document.startViewTransition` to enable CSS animated transitions on SPA navigations in your application.\n\nThe simplest approach to enabling a View Transition in your React Router app is via the new [`<Link unstable_viewTransition>`](https://reactrouter.com/v6/components/link#unstable_viewtransition) prop. This will cause the navigation DOM update to be wrapped in `document.startViewTransition` which will enable transitions for the DOM update. Without any additional CSS styles, you'll get a basic cross-fade animation for your page.\n\nIf you need to apply more fine-grained styles for your animations, you can leverage the [`unstable_useViewTransitionState`](https://reactrouter.com/v6/hooks/use-view-transition-state) hook which will tell you when a transition is in progress and you can use that to apply classes or styles:\n\n```jsx\nfunction ImageLink(to, src, alt) {\n  const isTransitioning = unstable_useViewTransitionState(to);\n  return (\n    <Link to={to} unstable_viewTransition>\n      <img\n        src={src}\n        alt={alt}\n        style={{\n          viewTransitionName: isTransitioning ? \"image-expand\" : \"\",\n        }}\n      />\n    </Link>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nYou can also use the [`<NavLink unstable_viewTransition>`](https://reactrouter.com/v6/components/nav-link#unstable_viewtransition) shorthand which will manage the hook usage for you and automatically add a `transitioning` class to the `<a>` during the transition:\n\n```css\na.transitioning img {\n  view-transition-name: \"image-expand\";\n}\n```\n\n```jsx\n<NavLink to={to} unstable_viewTransition>\n  <img src={src} alt={alt} />\n</NavLink>\n```\n\nFor an example usage of View Transitions, check out [our fork](https://github.com/brophdawg11/react-router-records) of the awesome [Astro Records](https://github.com/Charca/astro-records) demo.\n\nFor more information on using the View Transitions API, please refer to the [Smooth and simple transitions with the View Transitions API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/view-transitions/) guide from the Google Chrome team.\n\n### Minor Changes\n\n- Add support for view transitions ([#10916](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10916))\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- Log a warning and fail gracefully in `ScrollRestoration` when `sessionStorage` is unavailable ([#10848](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10848))\n- Fix `RouterProvider` `future` prop type to be a `Partial<FutureConfig>` so that not all flags must be specified ([#10900](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10900))\n- Allow 404 detection to leverage root route error boundary if path contains a URL segment ([#10852](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10852))\n- Fix `ErrorResponse` type to avoid leaking internal field ([#10876](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10876))\n\n**Full Changelog**: [`6.16.0...6.17.0`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/react-router@6.16.0...react-router@6.17.0)\n\n## v6.16.0\n\nDate: 2023-09-13\n\n### Minor Changes\n\n- In order to move towards stricter TypeScript support in the future, we're aiming to replace current usages of `any` with `unknown` on exposed typings for user-provided data. To do this in Remix v2 without introducing breaking changes in React Router v6, we have added generics to a number of shared types. These continue to default to `any` in React Router and are overridden with `unknown` in Remix. In React Router v7 we plan to move these to `unknown` as a breaking change. ([#10843](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10843))\n  - `Location` now accepts a generic for the `location.state` value\n  - `ActionFunctionArgs`/`ActionFunction`/`LoaderFunctionArgs`/`LoaderFunction` now accept a generic for the `context` parameter (only used in SSR usages via `createStaticHandler`)\n  - The return type of `useMatches` (now exported as `UIMatch`) accepts generics for `match.data` and `match.handle` - both of which were already set to `unknown`\n- Move the `@private` class export `ErrorResponse` to an `UNSAFE_ErrorResponseImpl` export since it is an implementation detail and there should be no construction of `ErrorResponse` instances in userland. This frees us up to export a `type ErrorResponse` which correlates to an instance of the class via `InstanceType`. Userland code should only ever be using `ErrorResponse` as a type and should be type-narrowing via `isRouteErrorResponse`.

To opt-into these encodings you just need to specify the proper `formEncType`:\n\n**Opt-into `application/json` encoding:**\n\n```js\nfunction Component() {\n  let navigation = useNavigation();\n  let submit = useSubmit();\n  submit({ key: \"value\" }, { method: \"post\", encType: \"application/json\" });\n  // navigation.formEncType => \"application/json\"\n  // navigation.json        => { key: \"value\" }\n}\n\nasync function action({ request }) {\n  // request.headers.get(\"Content-Type\") => \"application/json\"\n  // await request.json()                => { key: \"value\" }\n}\n```\n\n**Opt-into `text/plain` encoding:**\n\n```js\nfunction Component() {\n  let navigation = useNavigation();\n  let submit = useSubmit();\n  submit(\"Text submission\", { method: \"post\", encType: \"text/plain\" });\n  // navigation.formEncType => \"text/plain\"\n  // navigation.text        => \"Text submission\"\n}\n\nasync function action({ request }) {\n  // request.headers.get(\"Content-Type\") => \"text/plain\"\n  // await request.text()                => \"Text submission\"\n}\n```\n\n**⚠️ Default Behavior Will Change in v7**\n\nPlease note that to avoid a breaking change, the default behavior will still encode a simple key/value JSON object into a `FormData` instance:\n\n```jsx\nfunction Component() {\n  let navigation = useNavigation();\n  let submit = useSubmit();\n  submit({ key: \"value\" }, { method: \"post\" });\n  // navigation.formEncType => \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\"\n  // navigation.formData    => FormData instance\n}\n\nasync function action({ request }) {\n  // request.headers.get(\"Content-Type\") => \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\"\n  // await request.formData()            => FormData instance\n}\n```\n\nThis behavior will likely change in v7 so it's best to make any JSON object submissions explicit with `formEncType: \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\"` or `formEncType: \"application/json\"` to ease your eventual v7 migration path.\n\n### Minor Changes\n\n- Add support for `application/json` and `text/plain` encodings for `useSubmit`/`fetcher.submit`. To reflect these additional types, `useNavigation`/`useFetcher` now also contain `navigation.json`/`navigation.text` and `fetcher.json`/`fetcher.text` which include the json/text submission if applicable. ([#10413](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10413))\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- When submitting a form from a `submitter` element, prefer the built-in `new FormData(form, submitter)` instead of the previous manual approach in modern browsers (those that support the new `submitter` parameter) ([#9865](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9865))\n  - For browsers that don't support it, we continue to just append the submit button's entry to the end, and we also add rudimentary support for `type=\"image\"` buttons\n  - If developers want full spec-compliant support for legacy browsers, they can use the `formdata-submitter-polyfill`\n- Call `window.history.pushState/replaceState` _before_ updating React Router state (instead of after) so that `window.location` matches `useLocation` during synchronous React 17 rendering ([#10448](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10448))\n  - ⚠️ Note: generally apps should not be relying on `window.location` and should always reference `useLocation` when possible, as `window.location` will not be in sync 100% of the time (due to `popstate` events, concurrent mode, etc.)\n- Avoid calling `shouldRevalidate` for fetchers that have not yet completed a data load ([#10623](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10623))\n- Strip `basename` from the `location` provided to `<ScrollRestoration getKey>` to match the `useLocation` behavior ([#10550](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10550))\n- Strip `basename` from locations provided to `unstable_useBlocker` functions to match the `useLocation` behavior ([#10573](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10573))\n- Fix `unstable_useBlocker` key issues in `StrictMode` ([#10573](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10573))\n- Fix `generatePath` when passed a numeric `0` value parameter ([#10612](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10612))\n- Fix `tsc --skipLibCheck:false` issues on React 17 ([#10622](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10622))\n- Upgrade `typescript` to 5.1 ([#10581](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10581))\n\n**Full Changelog**: [`v6.13.0...v6.14.0`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/react-router@6.13.0...react-router@6.14.0)\n\n## v6.13.0\n\nDate: 2023-06-14\n\n### What's Changed\n\n`6.13.0` is really a patch release in spirit but comes with a SemVer minor bump since we added a new future flag.\n\n#### `future.v7_startTransition`\n\nThe **tl;dr;** is that `6.13.0` is the same as [`6.12.0`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/releases/tag/react-router%406.12.0) bue we've moved the usage of `React.startTransition` behind an opt-in `future.v7_startTransition` [future flag](https://reactrouter.com/v6/guides/api-development-strategy) because we found that there are applications in the wild that are currently using `Suspense` in ways that are incompatible with `React.startTransition`.\n\nTherefore, in `6.13.0` the default behavior will no longer leverage `React.startTransition`:\n\n```jsx\n<BrowserRouter>\n  <Routes>{/*...*/}</Routes>\n</BrowserRouter>\n\n<RouterProvider router={router} />\n```\n\nIf you wish to enable `React.startTransition`, pass the future flag to your router component:\n\n```jsx\n<BrowserRouter future={{ v7_startTransition: true }}>\n  <Routes>{/*...*/}</Routes>\n</BrowserRouter>\n\n<RouterProvider router={router} future={{ v7_startTransition: true }}/>\n```\n\nWe recommend folks adopt this flag sooner rather than later to be better compatible with React concurrent mode, but if you run into issues you can continue without the use of `React.startTransition` until v7. Issues usually boil down to creating net-new promises during the render cycle, so if you run into issues when opting into `React.startTransition`, you should either lift your promise creation out of the render cycle or put it behind a `useMemo`.\n\n### Minor Changes\n\n- Move `React.startTransition` usage behinds a future flag ([#10596](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10596))\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- Work around webpack/terser `React.startTransition` minification bug in production mode ([#10588](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10588))\n\n**Full Changelog**: [`v6.12.1...v6.13.0`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/react-router@6.12.1...react-router@6.13.0)\n\n## v6.12.1\n\nDate: 2023-06-08\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Please use version `6.13.0` or later instead of `6.12.0`/`6.12.1`.

This means that, for example, if one of your components in a destination route suspends and you have not provided a [`Suspense`](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense) boundary to show a fallback, React will delay the rendering of the new UI and show the old UI until that asynchronous operation resolves. This could be useful for waiting for things such as waiting for images or CSS files to load (and technically, yes, you could use it for data loading but we'd still recommend using loaders for that 😀). For a quick overview of this usage, check out [Ryan's demo on Twitter](https://twitter.com/remix_run/status/1658976420767604736).\n\n### Minor Changes\n\n- Wrap internal router state updates with `React.startTransition` ([#10438](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10438))\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- Allow fetcher revalidations to complete if submitting fetcher is deleted ([#10535](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10535))\n- Re-throw `DOMException` (`DataCloneError`) when attempting to perform a `PUSH` navigation with non-serializable state.

We found some [subtle bugs](https://codesandbox.io/s/use-sync-external-store-loop-9g7b81) where router state updates got propagated _before_ other normal `useState` updates, which could lead to foot guns in `useEffect` calls. ([#10377](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10377), [#10409](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10409))\n- Log loader/action errors caught by the default error boundary to the console in dev for easier stack trace evaluation ([#10286](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10286))\n- Fix bug preventing rendering of descendant `<Routes>` when `RouterProvider` errors existed ([#10374](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10374))\n- Fix detection of `useNavigate` in the render cycle by setting the `activeRef` in a layout effect, allowing the `navigate` function to be passed to child components and called in a `useEffect` there ([#10394](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10394))\n- Allow `useRevalidator()` to resolve a loader-driven error boundary scenario ([#10369](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10369))\n- Enhance `LoaderFunction`/`ActionFunction` return type to prevent `undefined` from being a valid return value ([#10267](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10267))\n- Ensure proper 404 error on `fetcher.load` call to a route without a `loader` ([#10345](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10345))\n- Decouple `AbortController` usage between revalidating fetchers and the thing that triggered them such that the unmount/deletion of a revalidating fetcher doesn't impact the ongoing triggering navigation/revalidation ([#10271](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10271))\n\n**Full Changelog**: [`v6.10.0...v6.11.0`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/react-router@6.10.0...react-router@6.11.0)\n\n## v6.10.0\n\nDate: 2023-03-29\n\n### What's Changed\n\nWe recently published a post over on the Remix Blog titled [\"Future Proofing Your Remix App\"](https://remix.run/blog/future-flags) that goes through our strategy to ensure smooth upgrades for your Remix and React Router apps going forward. React Router `6.10.0` adds support for these flags (for data routers) which you can specify when you create your router:\n\n```js\nconst router = createBrowserRouter(routes, {\n  future: {\n    // specify future flags here\n  },\n});\n```\n\nYou can also check out the docs [here](https://reactrouter.com/en/dev/guides/api-development-strategy) and [here](https://reactrouter.com/en/dev/routers/create-browser-router#future).\n\n### Minor Changes\n\n#### `future.v7_normalizeFormMethod`\n\nThe first future flag being introduced is `future.v7_normalizeFormMethod` which will normalize the exposed `useNavigation()/useFetcher()` `formMethod` fields as uppercase HTTP methods to align with the `fetch()` (and some Remix) behavior. ([#10207](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10207))\n\n- When `future.v7_normalizeFormMethod` is unspecified or set to `false` (default v6 behavior),\n  - `useNavigation().formMethod` is lowercase\n  - `useFetcher().formMethod` is lowercase\n- When `future.v7_normalizeFormMethod === true`:\n  - `useNavigation().formMethod` is UPPERCASE\n  - `useFetcher().formMethod` is UPPERCASE\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- Fix `createStaticHandler` to also check for `ErrorBoundary` on routes in addition to `errorElement` ([#10190](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10190))\n- Fix route ID generation when using Fragments in `createRoutesFromElements` ([#10193](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10193))\n- Provide fetcher submission to `shouldRevalidate` if the fetcher action redirects ([#10208](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10208))\n- Properly handle `lazy()` errors during router initialization ([#10201](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10201))\n- Remove `instanceof` check for `DeferredData` to be resilient to ESM/CJS boundaries in SSR bundling scenarios ([#10247](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10247))\n- Update to latest `@remix-run/web-fetch@4.3.3` ([#10216](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10216))\n\n**Full Changelog**: [`v6.9.0...v6.10.0`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/react-router@6.9.0...react-router@6.10.0)\n\n## v6.9.0\n\nDate: 2023-03-10\n\n### What's Changed\n\n#### `Component`/`ErrorBoundary` route properties\n\nReact Router now supports an alternative way to define your route `element` and `errorElement` fields as React Components instead of React Elements. You can instead pass a React Component to the new `Component` and `ErrorBoundary` fields if you choose. There is no functional difference between the two, so use whichever approach you prefer 😀. You shouldn't be defining both, but if you do `Component`/`ErrorBoundary` will \"win\"\n\n**Example JSON Syntax**\n\n```jsx\n// Both of these work the same:\nconst elementRoutes = [{\n  path: '/',\n  element: <Home />,\n  errorElement: <HomeError />,\n}]\n\nconst componentRoutes = [{\n  path: '/',\n  Component: Home,\n  ErrorBoundary: HomeError,\n}]\n\nfunction Home() { ... }\nfunction HomeError() { ... }\n```\n\n**Example JSX Syntax**\n\n```jsx\n// Both of these work the same:\nconst elementRoutes = createRoutesFromElements(\n  <Route path='/' element={<Home />} errorElement={<HomeError /> } />\n);\n\nconst componentRoutes = createRoutesFromElements(\n  <Route path='/' Component={Home} ErrorBoundary={HomeError} />\n);\n\nfunction Home() { ... }\nfunction HomeError() { ... }\n```\n\n#### Introducing Lazy Route Modules\n\nIn order to keep your application bundles small and support code-splitting of your routes, we've introduced a new `lazy()` route property. This is an async function that resolves the non-route-matching portions of your route definition (`loader`, `action`, `element`/`Component`, `errorElement`/`ErrorBoundary`, `shouldRevalidate`, `handle`).\n\nLazy routes are resolved on initial load and during the `loading` or `submitting` phase of a navigation or fetcher call. You cannot lazily define route-matching properties (`path`, `index`, `children`) since we only execute your lazy route functions after we've matched known routes.\n\nYour `lazy` functions will typically return the result of a dynamic import.\n\n```jsx\n// In this example, we assume most folks land on the homepage so we include that\n// in our critical-path bundle, but then we lazily load modules for /a and /b so\n// they don't load until the user navigates to those routes\nlet routes = createRoutesFromElements(\n  <Route path=\"/\" element={<Layout />}>\n    <Route index element={<Home />} />\n    <Route path=\"a\" lazy={() => import(\"./a\")} />\n    <Route path=\"b\" lazy={() => import(\"./b\")} />\n  </Route>\n);\n```\n\nThen in your lazy route modules, export the properties you want defined for the route:\n\n```jsx\nexport async function loader({ request }) {\n  let data = await fetchData(request);\n  return json(data);\n}\n\n// Export a `Component` directly instead of needing to create a React Element from it\nexport function Component() {\n  let data = useLoaderData();\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>You made it!</h1>\n      <p>{data}</p>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n// Export an `ErrorBoundary` directly instead of needing to create a React Element from it\nexport function ErrorBoundary() {\n  let error = useRouteError();\n  return isRouteErrorResponse(error) ? (\n    <h1>\n      {error.status} {error.statusText}\n    </h1>\n  ) : (\n    <h1>{error.message || error}</h1>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nAn example of this in action can be found in the [`examples/lazy-loading-router-provider`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/tree/main/examples/lazy-loading-router-provider) directory of the repository. For more info, check out the [`lazy` docs](https://reactrouter.com/v6/route/lazy).\n\n🙌 Huge thanks to @rossipedia for the [Initial Proposal](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/discussions/9826) and [POC Implementation](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9830).\n\n### Minor Changes\n\n- Add support for `route.Component`/`route.ErrorBoundary` properties ([#10045](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10045))\n- Add support for `route.lazy` ([#10045](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10045))\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- Improve memoization for context providers to avoid unnecessary re-renders ([#9983](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9983))\n- Fix `generatePath` incorrectly applying parameters in some cases ([#10078](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10078))\n- `[react-router-dom-v5-compat]` Add missed data router API re-exports ([#10171](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10171))\n\n**Full Changelog**: [`v6.8.2...v6.9.0`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/react-router@6.8.2...react-router@6.9.0)\n\n## v6.8.2\n\nDate: 2023-02-27\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- Treat same-origin absolute URLs in `<Link to>` as external if they are outside of the router `basename` ([#10135](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10135))\n- Correctly perform a hard redirect for same-origin absolute URLs outside of the router `basename` ([#10076](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10076))\n- Fix SSR of absolute `<Link to>` urls ([#10112](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10112))\n- Properly escape HTML characters in `StaticRouterProvider` serialized hydration data ([#10068](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10068))\n- Fix `useBlocker` to return `IDLE_BLOCKER` during SSR ([#10046](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10046))\n- Ensure status code and headers are maintained for `defer` loader responses in `createStaticHandler`'s `query()` method ([#10077](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10077))\n- Change `invariant` to an `UNSAFE_invariant` export since it's only intended for internal use ([#10066](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10066))\n\n**Full Changelog**: [`v6.8.1...v6.8.2`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/react-router@6.8.1...react-router@6.8.2)\n\n## v6.8.1\n\nDate: 2023-02-06\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- Remove inaccurate console warning for POP navigations and update active blocker logic ([#10030](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10030))\n- Only check for differing origin on absolute URL redirects ([#10033](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10033))\n- Improved absolute url detection in `Link` component (now also supports `mailto:` urls) ([#9994](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9994))\n- Fix partial object (search or hash only) pathnames losing current path value ([#10029](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10029))\n\n**Full Changelog**: [`v6.8.0...v6.8.1`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/react-router@6.8.0...react-router@6.8.1)\n\n## v6.8.0\n\nDate: 2023-01-26\n\n### Minor Changes\n\nSupport absolute URLs in `<Link to>`. If the URL is for the current origin, it will still do a client-side navigation. If the URL is for a different origin then it will do a fresh document request for the new origin. ([#9900](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9900))\n\n```tsx\n<Link to=\"https://neworigin.com/some/path\">    {/* Document request */}\n<Link to=\"//neworigin.com/some/path\">          {/* Document request */}\n<Link to=\"https://www.currentorigin.com/path\"> {/* Client-side navigation */}\n```\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- Fixes 2 separate issues for revalidating fetcher `shouldRevalidate` calls ([#9948](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9948))\n  - The `shouldRevalidate` function was only being called for _explicit_ revalidation scenarios (after a mutation, manual `useRevalidator` call, or an `X-Remix-Revalidate` header used for cookie setting in Remix). It was not properly being called on _implicit_ revalidation scenarios that also apply to navigation `loader` revalidation, such as a change in search params or clicking a link for the page we're already on. It's now correctly called in those additional scenarios.\n  - The parameters being passed were incorrect and inconsistent with one another since the `current*`/`next*` parameters reflected the static `fetcher.load` URL (and thus were identical). Instead, they should have reflected the navigation that triggered the revalidation (as the `form*` parameters did). These parameters now correctly reflect the triggering navigation.\n- Fix bug with search params removal via `useSearchParams` ([#9969](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9969))\n- Respect `preventScrollReset` on `<fetcher.Form>` ([#9963](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9963))\n- Fix navigation for hash routers on manual URL changes ([#9980](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9980))\n- Use `pagehide` instead of `beforeunload` for `<ScrollRestoration>`. This has better cross-browser support, specifically on Mobile Safari. ([#9945](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9945))\n- Do not short circuit on hash change only mutation submissions ([#9944](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9944))\n- Remove `instanceof` check from `isRouteErrorResponse` to avoid bundling issues on the server ([#9930](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9930))\n- Detect when a `defer` call only contains critical data and remove the `AbortController` ([#9965](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9965))\n- Send the name as the value when url-encoding `File` `FormData` entries ([#9867](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9867))\n- `react-router-dom-v5-compat` -

Now, adding a `?` to the end of any path segment will make that entire segment optional. This works for both static segments and dynamic parameters.\n\n**Optional Params Examples**\n\n- `<Route path=\":lang?/about>` will match:\n  - `/:lang/about`\n  - `/about`\n- `<Route path=\"/multistep/:widget1?/widget2?/widget3?\">` will match:\n  - `/multistep`\n  - `/multistep/:widget1`\n  - `/multistep/:widget1/:widget2`\n  - `/multistep/:widget1/:widget2/:widget3`\n\n**Optional Static Segment Example**\n\n- `<Route path=\"/home?\">` will match:\n  - `/`\n  - `/home`\n- `<Route path=\"/fr?/about\">` will match:\n  - `/about`\n  - `/fr/about`\n\n### Minor Changes\n\n- Allows optional routes and optional static segments ([#9650](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9650))\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- Stop incorrectly matching on partial named parameters, i.e. `<Route path=\"prefix-:param\">`, to align with how splat parameters work. If you were previously relying on this behavior then it's recommended to extract the static portion of the path at the `useParams` call site: ([#9506](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9506))\n\n```jsx\n// Old behavior at URL /prefix-123\n<Route path=\"prefix-:id\" element={<Comp /> }>\n\nfunction Comp() {\n  let params = useParams(); // { id: '123' }\n  let id = params.id; // \"123\"\n  ...\n}\n\n// New behavior at URL /prefix-123\n<Route path=\":id\" element={<Comp /> }>\n\nfunction Comp() {\n  let params = useParams(); // { id: 'prefix-123' }\n  let id = params.id.replace(/^prefix-/, ''); // \"123\"\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n- Persist `headers` on `loader` `request`'s after SSR document `action` request ([#9721](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9721))\n- Fix requests sent to revalidating loaders so they reflect a GET request ([#9660](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9660))\n- Fix issue with deeply nested optional segments ([#9727](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9727))\n- GET forms now expose a submission on the loading navigation ([#9695](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9695))\n- Fix error boundary tracking for multiple errors bubbling to the same boundary ([#9702](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9702))\n\n**Full Changelog**: [`v6.4.5...v6.5.0`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/react-router@6.4.5...react-router@6.5.0)\n\n## v6.4.5\n\nDate: 2022-12-07\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- Fix requests sent to revalidating loaders so they reflect a `GET` request ([#9680](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9680))\n- Remove `instanceof Response` checks in favor of `isResponse` ([#9690](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9690))\n- Fix `URL` creation in Cloudflare Pages or other non-browser-environments ([#9682](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9682), [#9689](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9689))\n- Add `requestContext` support to static handler `query`/`queryRoute` ([#9696](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9696))\n  - Note that the unstable API of `queryRoute(path, routeId)` has been changed to `queryRoute(path, { routeId, requestContext })`\n\n**Full Changelog**: [`v6.4.4...v6.4.5`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/react-router@6.4.4...react-router@6.4.5)\n\n## v6.4.4\n\nDate: 2022-11-30\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- Throw an error if an `action`/`loader` function returns `undefined` as revalidations need to know whether the loader has previously been executed. `undefined` also causes issues during SSR stringification for hydration. You should always ensure your `loader`/`action` returns a value, and you may return `null` if you don't wish to return anything.

Here's a quick high level overview, but it's recommended you go check out the [docs](https://reactrouter.com/), especially the [feature overview](https://reactrouter.com/en/6.4.0/start/overview) and the [tutorial](https://reactrouter.com/en/6.4.0/start/tutorial).\n\n**New `react-router` APIs**\n\n- Create your router with `createMemoryRouter`\n- Render your router with `<RouterProvider>`\n- Load data with a Route `loader` and mutate with a Route `action`\n- Handle errors with Route `errorElement`\n- Defer non-critical data with `defer` and `Await`\n\n**New `react-router-dom` APIs**\n\n- Create your router with `createBrowserRouter`/`createHashRouter`\n- Submit data with the new `<Form>` component\n- Perform in-page data loads and mutations with `useFetcher()`\n- Defer non-critical data with `defer` and `Await`\n- Manage scroll position with `<ScrollRestoration>`\n- Perform path-relative navigations with `<Link relative=\"path\">` ([#9160](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9160))\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- Path resolution is now trailing slash agnostic ([#8861](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/8861))\n- `useLocation` returns the scoped location inside a `<Routes location>` component ([#9094](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9094))\n- Respect the `<Link replace>` prop if it is defined ([#8779](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/8779))\n\n**Full Changelog**: [`v6.3.0...v6.4.0`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/v6.3.0...react-router%406.4.0)\n\n## v6.3.0\n\nDate: 2022-03-31\n\n### Minor Changes\n\n- Added the v5 to v6 backwards compatibility package 💜 ([#8752](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/8752)). The official guide can be found [in this discussion](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/discussions/8753)\n\n**Full Changelog**: [`v6.2.2...v6.3.0`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/v6.2.2...v6.3.0)\n\n## v6.2.2\n\nDate: 2022-02-28\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- Fixed nested splat routes that begin with special URL-safe characters ([#8563](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/8563))\n- Fixed a bug where index routes were missing route context in some cases ([#8497](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/8497))\n\n**Full Changelog**: [`v6.2.1...v6.2.2`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/v6.2.1...v6.2.2)\n\n## v6.2.1\n\nDate: 2021-12-17\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- This release updates the internal `history` dependency to `5.2.0`.\n\n**Full Changelog**: [`v6.2.0...v6.2.1`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/v6.2.0...v6.2.1)\n\n## v6.2.0\n\nDate: 2021-12-17\n\n### Minor Changes\n\n- We now use statically analyzable CJS exports. This enables named imports in Node ESM scripts ([See the commit](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/commit/29c7fc8b5f853b0b06ecd0f5682a9bbe6eca0715)).\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- Fixed the `RouteProps` `element` type, which should be a `ReactNode` ([#8473](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/8473))\n- Fixed a bug with `useOutlet` for top-level routes ([#8483](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/8483))\n\n**Full Changelog**: [`v6.1.1...v6.2.0`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/v6.1.1...v6.2.0)\n\n## v6.1.1\n\nDate: 2021-12-11\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- In v6.1.0 we inadvertently shipped a new, undocumented API that will likely introduce bugs ([#7586](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/7586)). We have flagged `HistoryRouter` as `unstable_HistoryRouter`, as this API will likely need to change before a new major release.\n\n**Full Changelog**: [`v6.1.0...v6.1.1`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/v6.1.0...v6.1.1)\n\n## v6.1.0\n\nDate: 2021-12-10\n\n### Minor Changes\n\n- `<Outlet>` can now receive a `context` prop. This value is passed to child routes and is accessible via the new `useOutletContext` hook. See [the API docs](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/api#useoutletcontext) for details. ([#8461](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/8461))\n- `<NavLink>` can now receive a child function for access to its props. ([#8164](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/8164))\n- Improved TypeScript signature for `useMatch` and `matchPath`. For example, when you call `useMatch(\"foo/:bar/:baz\")`, the path is parsed and the return type will be `PathMatch<\"bar\" | \"baz\">`. ([#8030](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/8030))\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- Fixed a bug that broke support for base64 encoded IDs on nested routes ([#8291](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/8291))\n- A few error message improvements ([#8202](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/8202))\n\n**Full Changelog**: [`v6.0.2...v6.1.0`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/v6.0.2...v6.1.0)\n\n## v6.0.2\n\nDate: 2021-11-09\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- Added the `reloadDocument` prop to `<Link>`. This allows `<Link>` to function like a normal anchor tag by reloading the document after navigation while maintaining the relative `to` resolution ([#8283](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/8283))\n\n**Full Changelog**: [`v6.0.1...v6.0.2`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/v6.0.1...v6.0.2)\n\n## v6.0.1\n\nDate: 2021-11-05\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- Add a default `<StaticRouter location>` value ([#8243](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/8243))\n- Add invariant for using `<Route>` inside `<Routes>` to help people make the change ([#8238](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/8238))\n\n**Full Changelog**: [`v6.0.0...v6.0.1`](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/compare/v6.0.0...v6.0.1)\n\n## v6.0.0\n\nDate: 2021-11-03\n\nReact Router v6 is here!\n\nPlease go read [our blog post for more information on all the great stuff in v6](https://remix.run/blog/react-router-v6) including [notes about how to upgrade from React Router v5](https://remix.run/blog/react-router-v6#upgrading-to-react-router-v6) and Reach Router.\n"

          "content": "# React Router Development\n\n## Releases\n\nNew 7.x releases should be created from release branches originating from the `dev` branch. If you are doing a 6.x release, please see the [v6 section](#v6-releases) below.\n\nWhen you are ready to begin the release process:\n\n- Make sure you've pulled all the changes from GitHub for both `dev` and `main` branches\n  - `git checkout main && git pull origin main`\n  - `git checkout dev && git pull origin dev`\n- Check out the `dev` branch\n  - `git checkout dev`\n- Create a new `release-next` branch\n  - `git checkout -b release-next`\n  - Technically, any `release-*` branch name will work as this is what triggers our GitHub CI workflow that will ultimately publish the release - but we just always use `release-next`\n  - We are using `release-v6` for [ongoing v6 releases](#v6-releases)\n- Merge `main` into the `release-next` branch\n  - `git merge --no-ff main`\n\nChangesets will do most of the heavy lifting for our releases. When changes are made to the codebase, an accompanying changeset file should be included to document the change. Those files will dictate how Changesets will version our packages and what shows up in the changelogs.\n\n### Starting a new pre-release\n\n- Ensure you are on the new `release-next` branch\n  - `git checkout release-next`\n- Enter Changesets pre-release mode using the `pre` tag:\n  - `pnpm changeset pre enter pre`\n- Commit the change and push the `release-next` branch to GitHub\n  - `git commit -a -m \"Enter prerelease mode\"`\n  - `git push --set-upstream origin release-next`\n- Wait for the changesets CI workflow to finish which will open a PR pointed to `release-next` that will increment all versions and generate the changelogs\n- If you need/want to make any changes to the `CHANGELOG.md` files, you can do so and commit directly to the PR branch\n  - This is usually not required for prereleases\n- Once the changesets files are in good shape, merge the PR to `release-next`\n- Once the PR is merged, the release workflow will publish the updated `X.Y.Z-pre.*` packages to npm\n\n### Prepare the draft release notes\n\n- At this point, you can begin crafting the release notes for the eventual stable release in the root `CHANGELOG.md` file in the repo\n  - Copy the commented out template for a new release and update the version numbers and links accordingly\n  - Copy the relevant changelog entries from all packages into the release notes and adjust accordingly\n    - `find packages -name 'CHANGELOG.md' -mindepth 2 -maxdepth 2 -exec code {} \\;`\n  - Commit these changes directly to the `release-next` branch - they will not trigger a new prerelease since they do not include a changeset\n\n### Iterating a pre-release\n\nYou may need to make changes to a pre-release prior to publishing a final stable release. To do so:\n\n- Branch off of `release-next` and make whatever changes you need\n- Create a new changeset: `pnpm changeset`\n  - **IMPORTANT:** This is required even if you ultimately don't want to include these changes in the logs. Remember, changelogs can be edited prior to publishing, but the Changeset version script needs to see new changesets in order to create a new version\n- Push your branch to GitHub and PR it to `release-next`\n- Once reviewed/approved, merge the PR to the `release-next` branch\n- Wait for the release workflow to finish and the Changesets action to open its PR that will increment all versions\n  - Note: If more changes are needed you can just merge them to `release-next` and this PR will automatically update in place\n- Review the PR, make any adjustments necessary, and merge it into the `release-next` branch\n- Once the PR is merged, the release workflow will publish the updated `X.Y.Z-pre.*` packages to npm\n- Make sure you copy over the new changeset contents into stable release notes in the root `CHANGELOG.md` file in the repo\n\n### Publishing the stable release\n\n- Exit Changesets pre-release mode in the `release-next` branch:\n  - `pnpm changeset pre exit`\n- Commit the edited pre-release file along with any unpublished changesets, and push the `release-next` branch to GitHub\n- Wait for the release workflow to finish - the Changesets action in the workflow will open a PR that will increment all versions and generate the changelogs for the stable release\n- Review the updated `CHANGELOG` files in the PR and make any adjustments necessary\n  - `find packages -name 'CHANGELOG.md' -mindepth 2 -maxdepth 2 -exec code {} \\;`\n  - Our automated release process should have removed prerelease entries\n- Finalize the release notes\n  - This should already be in pretty good shape in the root `CHANGELOG.md` file in the repo because changes have been added with each prerelease\n  - Do a quick double check that all iterated prerelease changesets got copied over\n- Merge the PR into the `release-next` branch\n- Once the PR is merged, the release workflow will publish the updated packages to npm\n- Once the release is published:\n  - Pull the latest `release-next` branch containing the PR you just merged\n  - Merge the `release-next` branch into `main` **using a non-fast-forward merge** and push it up to GitHub\n    - `git checkout main`\n    - `git merge --no-ff release-next`\n    - `git push origin main`\n    - _Note:_ For the `v7.0.0` stable release, there will probably be a bunch of conflicts on `docs/**/*.md` files here because we have made changes to v6 docs but in `dev` we removed a lot of those files in favor of auto-generated API docs. To resolve those conflicts, we should accept the deletion from the `release-next` branch.\n  - Merge the `release-next` branch into `dev` **using a non-fast-forward merge** and push it up to GitHub\n    - `git checkout dev`\n    - `git merge --no-ff release-next`\n    - `git push origin dev`\n  - Convert the `react-router@6.x.y` tag to a Release on GitHub with the name `v6.x.y` and add a deep-link to the release heading in `CHANGELOG.md`\n  - Delete the `release-next` branch locally and on GitHub\n\n### Hotfix releases\n\nHotfix releases follow the same process as standard releases above, but the `release-next` branch should be branched off latest `main` instead of `dev`. Once the stable hotfix is published, the `release-next` branch should be merged back into both `main` and `dev` just like a normal release.\n\n### v6 releases\n\n6.x releases are managed in a similar process to the above but from the `v6` branch, and they do not automatically merge changes back to `dev`/`main`.\n\n- Changes for 6.x should be PR'd to the `v6` branch with a changeset\n- If these changes should also be applied to v7, cherry-pick or re-do those changes against the `dev` branch (including the changeset). These changes will make it to `main` with the next v7 release.\n- Starting the release process for 6.x is the same as outlined above, with a few exceptioins:\n  - Branch from `v6` instead of `dev`\n  - Use `release-v6` instead of `release-next`\n  - Do **not** merge `main` into `release-v6`\n- Steps:\n  - `git checkout v6 && git pull origin v6`\n  - `git checkout -b release-v6`\n  - `pnpm changeset pre enter pre`\n  - The process of the PRs and iterating on prereleases remains the same\n- Once the stable release is out:\n  - Merge `release-v6` back to `v6` with a **Normal Merge**\n  - **Do not** merge `release-v6` to `main`\n  - Manually copy the new root `CHANGELOG.md` entry to `main` and `dev`\n    - We don't worry about backporting individual `packages/*/CHANGELOG.md` updates to `main` for subsequent v6 releases\n  - The _code_ changes should already be in the `dev` branch\n    - This should have happened at the time the v6 change was made (except for changes such as deprecation warnings)\n    - Confirm that the commits in this release are all included in `dev` already, and if not you can manually bring them over by cherry-picking the commit or re-doing the work\n\n### Experimental releases\n\nExperimental releases and hot-fixes do not need to be branched off of `dev`. Experimental releases can be branched from anywhere as they are not intended for general use.\n\n- Create a new branch for the release: `git checkout -b release-experimental`\n- Make whatever changes you need and commit them: `git add . && git commit \"experimental changes!\"`\n- Update version numbers and create a release tag: `pnpm run version:experimental`\n- Push to GitHub: `git push origin --follow-tags`\n- The CI workflow should automatically trigger from the experimental tag to publish the release to npm\n"
