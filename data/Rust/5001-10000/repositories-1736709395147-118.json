          "content": "These are instructions on how to build the app on desktop platforms. See the\n[readme](./README.md#building-the-app) for help building on other platforms.\n\n# Install toolchains and dependencies\n\nThese instructions are probably not complete. If you find something more that needs installing\non your platform please submit an issue or a pull request.\n\n## All platforms\n\n- Get the latest **stable** Rust toolchain via [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).\n\n- You need Node.js and npm. You can find the exact versions in the `volta` section of\n  `desktop/package.json`. The toolchain is managed by volta.\n\n  - Linux & macOS\n\n    ```bash\n    cargo install --git https://github.com/volta-cli/volta && volta setup\n    ````\n\n  - Windows\n\n    Install the `msi` hosted here: https://github.com/volta-cli/volta\n\n- (Not Windows) Install Go (ideally version `1.21`) by following the [official\n  instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install).  Newer versions may work\n  too.\n\n- Install a protobuf compiler (version 3.15 and up), it can be installed on most major Linux distros\n  via the package name `protobuf-compiler`, `protobuf` on macOS via Homebrew, and on Windows\n  binaries are available on their GitHub [page](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases)\n  and they have to be put in `%PATH`. An additional package might also be required depending on\n  Linux distro:\n  - `protobuf-devel` on Fedora.\n  - `libprotobuf-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu.\n\n## Linux\n\n### Debian/Ubuntu\n\n```bash\n# For building the daemon\nsudo apt install gcc libdbus-1-dev\n# For building the installer\nsudo apt install rpm\n```\n\n### Fedora/RHEL\n\n```bash\n# For building the daemon\nsudo dnf install dbus-devel\n# For building the installer\nsudo dnf install rpm-build\n```\n\n### Cross-compiling for ARM64\n\nBy default, the app will build for the host platform. It is also possible to cross-compile the app\nfor ARM64 on x64.\n\n#### Debian\n\n```bash\n# As root\ndpkg --add-architecture arm64 && \\\n    apt update && \\\n    apt install libdbus-1-dev:arm64 gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu\n```\n\n```bash\nrustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu\n```\n\nTo make sure the right linker and libraries are used, add the following to `~/.cargo/config.toml`:\n\n```\n[target.aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu]\nlinker = \"aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc\"\n\n[target.aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu.dbus]\nrustc-link-search = [\"/usr/aarch64-linux-gnu/lib\"]\nrustc-link-lib = [\"dbus-1\"]\n```\n\n## Windows\n\nThe host has to have the following installed:\n\n- Microsoft's _Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022_ (a regular installation of Visual Studio 2022\n  Community or Pro edition works as well).\n\n- Windows 10 (or Windows 11) SDK.\n\n- `bash` installed as well as a few base unix utilities, including `sed` and `tail`.\n  You are recommended to use [Git for Windows].\n\n- `msbuild.exe` available in `%PATH%`. If you installed Visual Studio Community edition, the\n  binary can be found under:\n\n  ```\n  C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2022\\Community\\MSBuild\\Current\\Bin\\<arch>\n  ```\n\n  Where `<arch>` refers to the host architecture, either `amd64` or `arm64`.\n\n  The environment can also be set up in bash by sourcing `vcvars.sh`: `. ./scripts/vcvars.sh`. Note\n  that that script assumes that you're running VS 2022 Community.\n\n- The `x86` target is required for building some NSIS plugins:\n\n  ```bash\n  rustup target add i686-pc-windows-msvc\n  ```\n\n[Git for Windows]: https://git-scm.com/download/win\n\n### Cross-compiling for ARM64\n\nBy default, the app will build for the host platform. It is also possible to cross-compile the app\nfor ARM64 on x64. This requires:\n\n- The ARM64 MSVC tools added to Visual Studio.\n\n- `clang` (either directly from llvm.org or as part of Visual Studio) on the `PATH`.\n\n- The `AArch64` target added to Rust:\n\n```bash\nrustup target add aarch64-pc-windows-msvc\n```\n\n### Compiling *on* Windows Arm\n\nIn addition to the above requirements:\n\n- `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` is required to build `talpid-openvpn-plugin`:\n\n  ```bash\n  rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\n  ```\n\n- `clang` is required (can be found in the Visual Studio installer) in `PATH`.\n\n  `INCLUDE` also needs to include the correct headers for clang. This can be found by running\n  `vcvarsall.bat arm64` and typing `set INCLUDE`.\n\n  The environment can also be set up in bash by sourcing `vcvars.sh`: `. ./scripts/vcvars.sh`. Note\n  that that script assumes that you're running VS 2022 Community.\n\n- `grpc-tools` currently doesn't include ARM builds. The x64 binaries must be installed to build\n  the Electron app:\n\n  ```\n  pushd gui\n  npm install --target_arch=x64 grpc-tools\n  popd\n  ```\n\n## macOS\n\nThe host has to have the following installed:\n\n- A recent version of `bash`. The default version in macOS (3.2.57) isn't supported.\n\n- `clang` is required for CGo.\n\n# Building and packaging the app\n\nThe simplest way to build the entire app and generate an installer is to just run the build script.\n`--optimize` can be added to enable compiler optimizations. This will take longer to build but will\nproduce a smaller installer and installed binaries:\n```bash\n./build.sh [--optimize]\n```\nThis should produce an installer exe, pkg or rpm+deb file in the `dist/` directory.\n\nBuilding this requires at least 1GB of memory.\n\n## Notes on targeting ARM64\n\n### macOS\n\nBy default, `build.sh` produces a pkg for your current architecture only. To build a universal\napp that works on both Intel and Apple Silicon macs, build with `--universal`.\n\n### Linux\n\nTo cross-compile for ARM64 rather than the current architecture, set the `TARGETS` environment\nvariable to `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`:\n\n```bash\nTARGETS=\"aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu\" ./build.sh\n```\n\n### Windows\n\nTo cross-compile for ARM64 from another host architecture, set the `TARGETS` environment\nvariable to `aarch64-pc-windows-msvc`:\n\n```bash\nTARGETS=\"aarch64-pc-windows-msvc\" ./build.sh\n```\n\n## Notes on building on ARM64 Linux hosts\n\nDue to inability to build the management interface proto files on ARM64 (see\n[this](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-node/issues/1497) issue), building on ARM64 must be done in\n2 stages:\n\n1. Build management interface proto files on another platform than arm64 Linux\n2. Use the built proto files during the main build by setting the\n   `MANAGEMENT_INTERFACE_PROTO_BUILD_DIR` environment variable to the path the proto files\n\nTo build the management interface proto files there is a script (execute it on another platform than\nARM64 Linux):\n\n```bash\ncd desktop\nnpm ci -w mullvad-vpn\nnpm run -w mullvad-vpn build-proto\n```\n\nAfter that copy the files from the following directories into a single directory:\n```\ndesktop/packages/mullvad-vpn/src/main/management_interface/\ndesktop/packages/mullvad-vpn/build/src/main/management_interface/\n```\nSet the value of `MANAGEMENT_INTERFACE_PROTO_BUILD_DIR` to that directory while running the main\nbuild.\n\nWhen all is done, run the main build. Assuming that you copied the proto files into\n`/tmp/management_interface_proto` directory, the build command will look as follows:\n\n```bash\nMANAGEMENT_INTERFACE_PROTO_BUILD_DIR=/tmp/management_interface_proto ./build.sh --dev-build\n```\n\nOn Linux, you may also have to specify `USE_SYSTEM_FPM=true` to generate the deb/rpm packages.\n\n# Building and running mullvad-daemon\n\nThis section is for building the system service individually.\n\n1. Source `env.sh` to set the default environment variables:\n    ```bash\n    source env.sh\n    ```\n\n1. On Windows, build the C++ libraries:\n    ```bash\n    ./build-windows-modules.sh\n    ```\n\n1. Build the system daemon plus the other Rust tools and programs:\n    ```bash\n    cargo build\n    ```\n\n1. Copy the OpenVPN binaries, and our plugin for it, to the directory we will\n    use as a resource directory. If you want to use any other directory, you would need to copy\n    even more files.\n    ```bash\n    cp dist-assets/binaries/<platform>/openvpn[.exe] dist-assets/\n    cp target/debug/*talpid_openvpn_plugin* dist-assets/\n    cp dist-assets/binaries/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/wintun.dll target/debug/\n    ```\n\n1. On Windows, the daemon must be run as the SYSTEM user. You can use\n    [PsExec](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec) to launch\n    an elevated bash instance before starting the daemon in it:\n    ```\n    psexec64 -i -s bash.exe\n    ```\n\n1. Run the daemon with verbose logging (from the root directory of the project):\n    ```bash\n    sudo MULLVAD_RESOURCE_DIR=\"./dist-assets\" ./target/debug/mullvad-daemon -vv\n    ```\n    Leave out `sudo` on Windows. The daemon must run as root since it modifies the firewall and sets\n    up virtual network interfaces etc.\n\n# Building and running the desktop app\n\nThis section is for building the desktop app individually.\n\n1. Go to the `desktop` directory\n   ```bash\n   cd desktop\n   ```\n\n1. Install all the JavaScript dependencies by running:\n    ```bash\n    npm install -w mullvad-vpn\n    ```\n\n1. Start the Electron app in development mode by running:\n    ```bash\n    npm run -w mullvad-vpn develop\n    ```\n\nIf you change any javascript file while the development mode is running it will automatically\ntranspile and reload the file so that the changes are visible almost immediately.\n\nPlease note that the Electron app needs a running daemon to connect to in order to work. See\n[Building and running mullvad-daemon](#building-and-running-mullvad-daemon) for instructions\non how to do that before starting the Electron app.\n"

The main difference is that many different machines are\n  provided by relays instead of a bundled list. The bundled `maybenot_machines` file was removed.\n- Update Electron from 30.0.4 to 33.2.1.\n- Move changelog from a dialog to a separate view.\n- Reduce the setup time of PQ tunnels by pre-computing McEliece keys.\n\n\n## [2025.2] - 2025-01-08\n### Fixed\n- Fix crash when Wireguard tunnel setup timed out.\n\n\n## [2025.1] - 2025-01-02\n### Fixed\n#### macOS\n- Fix GUI getting stuck when opening the split tunneling view.\n\n\n## [2024.9-beta1] - 2024-12-05\n### Added\n- Add a new access method: Encrypted DNS Proxy. Encrypted DNS proxy is a way to reach the API via\n  proxies. The access method is enabled by default.\n\n#### macOS\n- Detect whether full disk access is enabled in the split tunneling view.\n- Add button to restart system service in split tunneling view. This can help mitigate edge-case\n  issues when enabling full disk access.\n\n### Changed\n- Replace the draft key encapsulation mechanism Kyber (round 3) with the standardized\n  ML-KEM (FIPS 203) dito in the handshake for Quantum-resistant tunnels.\n- Make Smart Routing override multihop if both are enabled. To manually set the entry relay,\n  explicitly enable the \"Direct only\" option in the DAITA settings.\n- Update maybenot from 1.1.3 to 2.0.1.\n\n#### Windows\n- Enable quantum-resistant tunnels by default (when set to `auto`).\n\n### Fixed\n- Handle network switching better when using WG over Shadowsocks.\n- Fix multihop entry location list sometimes being shown when multihop is disabled.\n\n#### macOS\n- Fix packets being duplicated on LAN when split tunneling is enabled.\n- Fix DNS issues caused by forcibly using a local DNS resolver in all states.\n  Note that this fix is not present on macOS versions between 14.6 and 15.1.\n\n### Security\n#### Windows\n- Block WSL/Hyper-V traffic in secured states (except the connected state). The normal firewall\n  (WFP) filters normally do not apply for VMs. This mitigates the issue by ensuring that it does not\n  leak (as easily) when the VPN tunnel is up. Previously, WSL would leak while in the blocked or\n  connecting state, or while lockdown mode was active.\n\n\n## [2024.8] - 2024-12-04\n### Security\n- Remove invalidly set up alternative stack for fault signal handlers on unix based systems.\n  This prevents potential stack overflow and heap memory corruption.\n  Fixes audit issue [`MLLVD-CR-24-01`].\n- Remove/disable not signal safe code from fault signal handler on unix based systems.\n  Fixes audit issue [`MLLVD-CR-24-02`].\n\n#### Windows\n- Fix issue where the installer would allow any executable named `taskkill.exe` in the working\n  directory to run as admin. This fixes audit issue [`MLLVD-CR-24-06`].\n\n#### Linux\n- Prevent attackers able to send ARP requests to the device running Mullvad from figuring out\n  the in-tunnel IP. Fixes 2024 audit issue [`MLLVD-CR-24-03`].\n\n[`MLLVD-CR-24-01`]: audits/2024-12-10-X41-D-Sec.md#MLLVD-CR-24-01\n[`MLLVD-CR-24-02`]: audits/2024-12-10-X41-D-Sec.md#MLLVD-CR-24-02\n[`MLLVD-CR-24-03`]: audits/2024-12-10-X41-D-Sec.md#MLLVD-CR-24-03\n[`MLLVD-CR-24-06`]: audits/2024-12-10-X41-D-Sec.md#MLLVD-CR-24-06\n\n## [2024.7] - 2024-10-30\nThis release is identical to 2024.7-beta1.\n\n\n## [2024.7-beta1] - 2024-10-25\n### Fixed\n#### macOS\n- Fix DNS not working due to broken PF redirect.\n\n\n## [2024.6] - 2024-10-23\n### Fixed\n#### macOS\n- Disable DNS redirect when custom DNS is set to localhost.\n\n\n## [2024.6-beta2] - 2024-10-09\n### Changed\n- Move DAITA and multihop to the root settings view along with moving multihop into a dedicated\n  view with more information.\n\n#### macOS\n- Enable IPv6 by default. This fixes DNS and routing being broken on some systems.\n- Proxy DNS queries through a local resolver.\n\n### Fixed\n#### macOS\n- Fix Apple services not working by forcing stray connections out through the VPN tunnel. This fix\n  only applies to Wireguard, OpenVPN is still affected. The \"bypass\" toggle has been removed.\n\n\n## [2024.6-beta1] - 2024-09-26\n### Added\n- Add WireGuard over Shadowsocks obfuscation. It can be enabled in \"WireGuard settings\". This will\n  also be used automatically when connecting fails with other methods.\n- Add feature indicators to the main view along with redesigning the connection details.\n- Add \"Smart Routing\" feature which simplifies connecting to DAITA-enabled relays.\n\n#### macOS\n- Add \"Apple services bypass\" toggle that let's users unblock certain Apple-owned networks.\n  This is a temporary fix to the MacOS 15 issues where some Apple services are being blocked.\n\n### Changed\n- Never use OpenVPN as a fallback protocol when any of the following features is enabled:\n  multihop, quantum-resistant tunnels, or DAITA.\n- Improved output format of `mullvad status` command, which now also prints feature indicators.\n\n#### macOS\n- Disable split tunnel interface when disconnected. This prevents traffic from being sent through\n  the daemon when the VPN is disconnected.\n\n### Fixed\n#### Linux\n- Set tunnel name to `wg0-mullvad` for userspace WireGuard.\n\n#### macOS\n- Exclude programs when executed using a relative path from a shell.\n- Reduce packet loss when using split tunneling.\n- Don't block fragmented packets in the PF firewall. Fixes various issues relating to connecting\n  (and general instability) when IP fragmentation is present.\n\n#### Windows\n- Add potential fix for a rare error when creating the Mullvad Wintun-adapter for OpenVPN\n\n\n## [2024.5] - 2024-09-03\n### Fixed\n- macOS and Linux: Fix potential crash when disconnecting with DAITA enabled.\n\n\n## [2024.5-beta1] - 2024-08-20\n### Added\n- Add DAITA (Defence against AI-guided Traffic Analysis) setting for Linux and macOS.\n- Add `--json` flag to `mullvad status` CLI.\n\n### Changed\n- Ignore obfuscation protocol constraints when the obfuscation mode is set to auto.\n\n#### macOS\n- Enable quantum-resistant tunnels by default (when set to `auto`).\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix mullvad cli bug causing `mullvad status listen` command to miss events if they occurred\n  too quickly.\n- Fix bug causing app to enter blocked state when toggling DAITA on and off.\n\n#### macOS\n- Fix intermittent failures to connect with PQ enabled.\n\n\n## [2024.4] - 2024-07-23\nThis release is identical to 2024.4-beta1.\n\n\n## [2024.4-beta1] - 2024-06-24\n### Added\n- Add custom bridge settings in GUI.\n- Bundle https://github.com/mullvad/apisocks5 as a standalone binary.\n\n#### macOS\n- Add support for split tunneling (beta).\n\n### Changed\n- Update Electron from 28.1.3 to 30.0.4.\n\n### Fixed\n#### Windows\n- Fix race condition that could result in crashes when DAITA was enabled during disconnects.\n\n\n## [2024.3] - 2024-05-15\nThis release is identical to 2024.3-beta1.\n\n\n## [2024.3-beta1] - 2024-05-07\n### Added\n#### Windows\n- Add DAITA (Defence against AI-guided Traffic Analysis) setting. On supported servers, this makes\n  website fingerprinting more difficult by sending random padding packets along with padding all\n  packets to the same size.\n\n### Changed\n- Don't fail to start daemon when the offline monitor fails to be initialized.\n\n### Fixed\n#### Linux\n- Fix GUI not working on Ubuntu 24.04 by adding an AppArmor profile.\n- Service failed to start when IPv6 was disabled in the kernel.\n\n\n## [2024.2] - 2024-04-29\n### Fixed\n- Fix bug where the app would fail to select an existing relay in some scenarios, causing the\n  user to wrongly end up in a blocked state.\n\n#### macOS\n- DNS was not properly restored in some cases when using custom DNS.\n\n### Security\n#### macOS\n- Flush states on tunnel state changes. Previously, pre-existing connections could leak when\n  internet sharing was enabled on a device.\n\n#### Windows\n- Update electron-builder to 24.13.3 to fix CVE-2024-27303, which enabled privilege escelation when\n  running the installer.\n\n\n## [2024.2-beta1] - 2024-04-15\n### Added\n- Add automatic MTU detection for desktop platforms. This currently only uses information about\n  dropped packets and does not take fragmentation into account.\n- Add ability to import server IP overrides in GUI.\n\n### Changed\n- Change default obfuscation setting to `auto`.\n- Migrate obfuscation settings for existing users from `off` to `auto`.\n- Change [default retry connection attempts][`relay selector defaults`].\n\n[`relay selector defaults`]: docs/relay-selector.md#default-constraints-for-tunnel-endpoints\n\n### Fixed\n- Continual excessive attempts to update the API IP were made after testing access methods.\n- Fix pointless API access method rotations for concurrent requests.\n- Fix daemon rotating logs on startup even if another daemon is already running.\n- Fix missing redirect to out of time-view when running out of time.\n- Fix incorrectly showing \"App lost contact with system service\" notification on suspend.\n\n\n## [2024.1] - 2024-03-21\n### Fixed\n- Fix map scaling issues when changing display scale settings and when running under Wayland on\n  Linux.\n\n#### macOS\n- Fix bug that caused high CPU usage.\n- Fix bugs that caused the log to be filled with socket errors, by handling closed sockets\n  gracefully.\n\n\n## [2024.1-beta2] - 2024-02-19\n### Added\n- Add account UUID to verbose 'mullvad account get -v' output.\n- Respect OS prefer-reduced-motion setting.\n- Add CLI command for exporting settings patches: `mullvad export-settings`. Currently, it generates\n  a patch containing all patchable settings, which only includes relay IP overrides.\n- Make `mullvad status` prints if lockdown mode is enabled when disconnected.\n- Add option to configure custom API access methods. Custom API access methods allows the user to\n  circumvent censorship by proxying API traffic.\n- Add confirmation dialog when deleting a custom list.\n- Add support for custom SOCKS5 OpenVPN bridges running locally.\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix connectivity issues that would occur when using quantum-resistant tunnels with an incorrectly\n  configured MTU.\n- Fix custom list name validation by not allowing empty names.\n\n#### Linux\n- Fix Bash shell completions for subcommands in the CLI.\n- Fix out IP missing forever when am.i.mullvad.net returns error.\n\n#### macOS\n- Fix default route not being restored when disconnecting when the gateway was a link-local IPv6\n  address.\n- Fix app sometimes getting stuck in error state when the connection is unstable. This occurred\n  when the default route was removed while connecting.\n- Improve multihop performance by preventing fragmentation in the tunnel. This is done by setting\n  an MTU on the default route.\n\n### Changed\n- Remove `--location` flag from `mullvad status` CLI. Location and IP will now always\n  be printed (if available). `mullvad status listen` no longer prints location info.\n- Change CLI interface for custom SOCKS5 bridges as part of supporting bridges running locally.\n- Upgrade the background map to a new WebGL 3D map. This should both look better and be more\n  performant.\n- Update Electron from 26.3.0 to 28.1.3.\n- Improve the \"Connecting to system service\"-view with information about the situation and\n  troubleshooting tips.\n- Update support email address to new email address, support@mullvadvpn.net.\n\n#### Linux\n- Enable quantum-resistant tunnels by default (when set to `auto`). On other platforms, `auto` still\n  always means the same thing as `off`.\n\n#### Windows\n- Add information to error notification about an error that is often caused by an incompatibility\n  with VMWare.\n\n\n## [2024.1-beta1] - 2023-12-14\n### Added\n- Add CLI support for applying patches to the settings with `mullvad import-settings`.\n\n### Changed\n- CLI command `mullvad relay set tunnel wireguard entry-location` changed to\n  `mullvad relay set tunnel wireguard entry location`, as the `location` subcommand can now be\n  swapped for `custom-list` to select entry relays using a custom list.\n\n#### Linux\n- Rename interface name from `wg-mullvad` to `wg0-mullvad`.\n\n### Fixed\n- Validate that hostname matches correct server type for CLI commands `mullvad relay set location`,\n  `mullvad bridge set location`, and `mullvad relay set tunnel wireguard entry location`.\n\n#### Linux\n- Prevent fragmentation when multihop is enabled by setting a default route MTU.\n- Fix stable releases being considered a downgrade from a beta version by `dnf`.\n\n\n## [2023.6] - 2023-12-06\n### Changed\n- Update OpenVPN to 2.6.8 from 2.6.0.\n\n### Security\n- Update OpenVPN to 2.6.8 to fix CVE-2023-46850, which could cause freed memory to be sent to the\n  peer.\n\n\n## [2023.6-beta1] - 2023-11-23\n### Added\n- Add customizable relay lists to the CLI on desktop. Custom lists can be managed through\n  `mullvad custom-lists` and can be selected through `mullvad relay set` and `mullvad bridge set`.\n- Add custom lists to location selector in desktop app.\n- Add custom API access methods to the CLI on desktop. Custom API access methods allow the user to\n  proxy API traffic through a peer before connecting to a tunnel. They are managed through\n  `mullvad api-access`, and the initially supported network protocols are `Shadowsocks` and\n  `SOCKS5`.\n- Add social media content blocker.\n- Add ability to override server IPs to the CLI.\n\n### Changed\n- Update Electron from 25.2.0 to 26.3.0.\n\n#### Linux\n- Don't block forwarding of traffic when the split tunnel mark (ct mark) is set.\n\n### Removed\n#### Windows\n- Remove wireguard-go (userspace WireGuard) support.\n\n### Fixed\n- Show correct endpoint in CLI for custom relays.\n- Lower risk of being rate limited.\n- Fix error dialog when failing to write to console by handling the thrown error.\n- Fix error dialog displayed when the daemon was killed.\n- Fix desktop app freezing when navigations occur in very quick succession.\n\n#### Windows\n- Correctly detect whether OS is Windows Server (primarily for logging in daemon.log).\n\n### Security\n#### Windows\n- Fix possible privilege escalation by setting stricter permissions on mullvad directories such as\n  the directory in ProgramData (CVE-2023-50446).\n\n\n## [2023.5] - 2023-10-10\n### Added\n#### Linux\n- Start signing the deb and rpm files (GPG)\n\n### Fixed\n#### macOS\n- Fix connectivity issues when switching between networks or disconnecting.\n\n\n## [2023.5-beta2] - 2023-09-20\n### Fixed\n#### macOS\n- Ensure that the default tunnel route is added back after waking from hibernation. Previously, the\n  tunnel became unusable despite the app appearing to be connected.\n- Work around issue where the default route was lost after disconnecting after switching between\n  networks.\n- Fix slow offline detection.\n- Fix inability to switch from a network to a higher-priority network without the tunnel timing out.\n\n\n## [2023.5-beta1] - 2023-07-13\n### Added\n- Add `--help` and `--version` options to the desktop GUI application.\n- Add creation date below device name in the device list screen.\n- Add account view button in main view in the desktop app.\n- Add time left and device name in the header bar in the desktop app.\n\n### Changed\n- In the CLI, update the `tunnel` subcommand to resemble `relay` more. For example, by adding a\n  unified `mullvad tunnel get` command and removing individual `get` subcommands like\n  `mullvad tunnel ipv6 get`.\n- Update the CLI multihop settings to make it possible to set the entry location without toggling\n  multihop on or off.\n- In the CLI, the `mullvad account get` command will now print the account number (if there is one)\n  after the device has been revoked.\n- Update the CLI relay, multihop & bridge selection interface to accept a hostname as sole argument,\n  inheriting the behavior of `mullvad relay set hostname`. This is in addition to accepting a\n  geographical location as basis for filtering relays.\n- Silence OpenVPN \"replay attack\" warnings.\n- Update Electron from 23.2.0 to 25.2.0.\n\n#### Windows\n- In the CLI, add a unified `mullvad split-tunnel get` command to replace the old commands\n  `mullvad split-tunnel pid list` and `mullvad split-tunnel get`.\n\n### Fixed\n- Update relay list after logging in. Previously, if the user wasn't logged in when the daemon\n  started, the relay list would only be updated after attempting to connect to the VPN.\n\n#### macOS\n- Fix inability to sync iCloud and Safari bookmarks while connected to the VPN.\n\n### Removed\n- Remove the CLI subcommand `mullvad relay set hostname`.\n\n\n## [2023.4] - 2023-06-27\n### Fixed\n- Fix misaligned read in `shadowsocks` leading to a panic on some platforms.\n\n\n## [2023.4-beta1] - 2023-05-02\n### Added\n- Log select settings on each connection attempt.\n\n### Changed\n- Update Electron from 21.1.1 to 23.2.0.\n\n#### macOS\n- Change macOS app signing key and certificates. Replace those issued to Amagicom AB (the parent\n  company of Mullvad VPN AB) with new certificates issued directly to Mullvad VPN AB.\n\n### Deprecated\n#### Linux\n- Deprecated support for Debian 10. This also means dropping support for glibc older\n  than 2.31 and Linux kernels older than 5.10.\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix location search in desktop app only searching for English location names.\n- Fix automatic WireGuard key rotation not being initialized correctly when not running the GUI.\n- Fix duplicated notifications in some situations.\n- Fix notification setting being inverted. When non-important notifications were disabled it instead\n  disabled important ones and showed non-important ones.\n- Work around issues with PQ and multihop caused by fragmentation in the tunnel. The workaround\n  doesn't fix fragmentation issues in general but prevents the PSK exchange packets from being\n  fragmented by setting an explicit maximum segment size.\n\n#### macOS\n- Fix tray window behaviour when opening mission control and switching between full-screen\n  workspaces.\n- Fix issue where app stopped responding on ARM Macs.\n\n#### Linux\n- Fix RPM package containing unecessary files causing conflicts with other electron-builder based\n  packages.\n\n\n## [2023.3] - 2023-04-05\n### Changed\n- Change WireGuard key rotation interval to 14 days. It was 7 days on desktop and 4 days on\n  Android.\n\n\n## [2023.3-beta1] - 2023-03-23\n### Added\n- Add Kyber1024 KEM algorithm into the Post-Quantum secure key exchange algorithm. This means the\n  Quantum-resistant-tunnels feature now mixes both Classic McEliece and Kyber for added protection.\n- Add notification dot to tray icon and system notification throttling.\n- Add troubleshooting information to some in-app notifications.\n- Add setting for quantum-resistant tunnels to the desktop GUI.\n- Enable `TCP_NODELAY` for the socket used by WireGuard over TCP. Improves latency and performance.\n\n### Changed\n- Update the Post-Quantum secure key exchange gRPC client to use the stabilized\n  `PskExchangeV1` endpoint\n- Add \"auto\" setting for the quantum-resistant tunnel feature, and make it the default. If it was\n  previously set to off, it will now be set to auto instead. That currently means the same thing as\n  \"off\", but this might change in the future.\n- Update OpenVPN to 2.6.0 from 2.5.3.\n- Update OpenSSL to 1.1.1t from 1.1.1j.\n- Post-Quantum secure tunnels and multihop can now be used at the same time.\n\n#### Windows\n- Remove automatic fallback to wireguard-go. This is done as a first step before fully\n  deprecating it on Windows.\n\n### Removed\n- Remove port 443 as valid port for WireGuard over TCP. Keep only port 80 and 5001. The reason is\n  to free up port 443 for other TCP based obfuscation later.\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix close to expiry notification not showing unless app is opened once within the last three days\n  in the desktop app.\n- Retry if PQ PSK negotiation fails for any reason.\n- Fix accumulated tunnel state notifications sometimes displayed after suspend.\n\n\n## [2023.2] - 2023-03-06\n### Fixed\n#### Windows\n- Fix desktop app not quitting properly after switching from unpinned to pinned window.\n- Fix service not starting when LSA protection is enabled (which is the default on Windows 11 22H2).\n- Fix some issues with setting system DNS by using SetInterfaceDnsSettings when it's available (on\n  Windows 10, version 1809 and above).\n\n\n## [2023.1] - 2023-02-20\n### Fixed\n#### Windows\n- Don't fail to show the mullvad-daemon help text if some of the default paths cannot be obtained.\n\n\n## [2023.1-beta2] - 2023-02-06\n### Fixed\n- Fix sorting of devices in the \"too many devices\"-view to properly sort on device creation time.\n\n#### macOS\n- Improved reliability of the connectivity check workaround by adding an extra captive portal check\n  domain.\n- Show \"Mullvad VPN\" in the Login Items UI instead of \"Amagicom AB\".\n- Detect whether users need to approve the launch daemon in the Login Items UI.\n\n\n## [2023.1-beta1] - 2023-01-26\n### Added\n- Add quit button to tray context menu on Linux and Window.\n- Add search bar to location list in desktop app.\n\n#### Windows\n- Remove all settings when the app is uninstalled silently.\n\n### Changed\n- Update Electron from 19.0.13 to 21.1.1.\n\n### Fixed\n- When a country is selected, and the constraints only match relays that are not included on the\n  country level, select those relays anyway.\n- Fix regression where WireGuard relays were connected to over OpenVPN after a couple of failed\n  attempts, when the tunnel type was set to `any`.\n- Fix missing connect timeout when connecting to a WireGuard relay over TCP.\n- Fix failure to apply firewall rules that could occur when connecting timed out.\n\n#### macOS\n- Fix fish shell completions when installed via Homebrew on Apple Silicon Macs.\n\n#### Linux\n- Remove last filesystem dependency of early boot blocking unit.\n- Ensure RPM package removes all application directories when uninstalled.\n- Fix architecture field for ARM RPM builds so the app installs on Fedora based distros.\n\n#### Windows\n- Ignore adapters that have no valid GUID when removing obsolete Wintun interfaces during install.\n  Previously, the installer would abort.\n- Revert to using netsh for DNS config, as some Windows builds did not deal with changes correctly.\n  `TALPID_DNS_MODULE` can be used to override this.\n- Fix deadlock that could occur when the default route changed while initializing split tunneling.\n\n### Removed\n#### macOS\n- Remove ⌘Q shortcut.\n\n### Security\n#### Windows\n- DNS loopback traffic is no longer blocked. Note that local resolvers are still unable to forward\n  queries to servers that would normally be blocked.\n\n\n## [2022.5] - 2022-10-14\n### Fixed\n#### Linux\n- Don't prevent early boot service from running if logging to a file fails.\n\n\n## [2022.5-beta2] - 2022-10-05\n### Added\n- Add custom option to WireGuard port selector.\n\n#### Linux\n- Add ARM64 (aarch64) builds. This is the first release with Linux ARM support.\n\n### Changed\n- Experimental: Upgrade the support for quantum-resistant WireGuard tunnels to a newer protocol.\n\n### Fixed\n- Reset known location when connecting to a custom relay.\n\n#### Linux\n- Fix app crashing immediately when using some icon themes.\n\n\n## [2022.5-beta1] - 2022-09-26\n### Added\n- Add obfuscation settings under \"WireGuard settings\".\n\n#### Windows\n- The default VPN protocol is slowly being changed from OpenVPN to WireGuard.\n  The app fetches the ratio between the protocols from the API.\n\n#### Linux\n- GUI: Add electron flags to run Wayland native if in a compositor/desktop known to work well\n- Add support for Linux ARM64. No installers are produced yet. But the source code can now\n  be built for ARM64.\n\n### Changed\n- Reject invalid WireGuard ports in the CLI.\n- Reorganize settings into more logical categories.\n- Upgrade wireguard-go to 20220703234212 (Windows: v0.5.3).\n- Prune bridges far away from the selected relay.\n- Stay connected when desktop app is killed or crashes. The only situation where the app now\n  disconnects on quit is when the user presses the quit button.\n- Update Electron from 18.0.3 to 19.0.13.\n- Expand allowed range of multicast destinations to include all of `239.0.0.0/8` (administratively\n  scoped addresses), when local network sharing is enabled.\n- Default to selecting Sweden as the entry location when using WireGuard multihop. Previously,\n  a random location was used.\n\n#### Windows\n- Remove dependency on `ipconfig.exe`. Call `DnsFlushResolverCache` to flush the DNS cache.\n- Upgrade Wintun to 0.14.1.\n\n#### Linux\n- The daemon binary and systemd unit file will now be placed in `/usr/bin/` and\n  `/usr/lib/systemd/system` respectively, to aid with starting the system service on systems where\n  `/opt` isn't mounted during early boot.\n\n### Fixed\n- Connect to TCP endpoints over IPv6 if IPv6 is enabled for WireGuard.\n- Fix udp2tcp not working when quantum-resistant tunnels are enabled.\n- Quit app gracefully if renderer process is killed or crashes.\n- Enable reconnect in blocked state in desktop app.\n- Fix error handling during device removal in the desktop app.\n- Enable interface settings when app is logged out\n- Fix 'mullvad status -v' to include the port of the endpoint when connecting over TCP.\n- Check whether the device is valid when reconnecting from the error state.\n- Stop reconnecting when the account has run out of time.\n- Show out of time view after failing to connect due to being out of time.\n\n#### Windows\n- Only use the most recent list of apps to split when resuming from hibernation/sleep if applying\n  it was successful.\n- Don't fail install if the device tree contains nameless callout driver devices.\n\n### Security\n- When the system service is being shut down and the target state is _secured_, maintain the\n  blocking firewall rules. Unless it's possible to deduce that the system isn't shutting down and\n  the system service is being stopped by the user intentionally. This is to prevent leaks that might\n  occur during system shutdown. Fixes 2022 Mullvad app audit issue item `MUL22-02`.\n\n#### Windows\n- Upgrade win-split-tunnel driver to version 1.2.2.0. Fixes incomplete validation of input buffers\n  that could result in out-of-bounds reads. Fixes 2022 Mullvad app audit issue item `MUL22-01`.\n\n#### Linux\n- Added traffic blocking during early boot, before the daemon starts, to prevent leaks in the case\n  that the system service starts after a networking daemon has already configured a network\n  interface.\n\n\n## [2022.4] - 2022-08-19\n### Added\n#### Windows\n- Windows daemon now looks up the MTU on the default interface and uses this MTU instead of the\n  default 1500. The 1500 is still the fallback if this for some reason fails. This may stop\n  fragmentation.\n\n### Fixed\n#### Linux\n- Fix issue where MTU could not be manually set in the app.\n- Lower the max MTU from the automatic MTU detection down to 1380,\n  which was the hardcoded default before the automatic detection was implemented.\n  This solves issues where the physical interface MTU was set higher than it could\n  actually transport.\n\n\n## [2022.3] - 2022-08-10\nThis release is for desktop only.\n\nThis release is identical to 2022.3-beta3.\n\n\n## [2022.3-beta3] - 2022-07-28\n### Fixed\n- Fix showing incompatible relay filtering options in desktop app. The filtering options are now\n  dependent on the other filters.\n\n#### Windows\n- Fix app occasionally getting stuck in the offline state after being suspended.\n\n#### Linux\n- Fixed incompatibility with newer kernel versions (5.19 and up).\n\n### Security\n#### Windows\n- Fix potential leak window when stopping the service and auto-connect is enabled and always\n  require VPN is disabled. When stopped, usually due to a reboot, the daemon would disconnect\n  before entering a blocking state.\n\n\n## [2022.3-beta2] - 2022-06-29\n### Fixed\n#### Windows\n- Fix DNS issue on non-English Windows installations. Don't parse the output of ipconfig.exe\n  to determine if the tool succeeded.\n\n\n## [2022.3-beta1] - 2022-06-27\n### Added\n- Add option to filter relays by ownership in the desktop apps.\n- Experimental: Add support for quantum-resistant PSK exchange to the CLI.\n\n#### Linux\n- Automatically attempt to detect and set the correct MTU for Wireguard tunnels.\n\n#### Windows\n- Add CLI command for listing excluded processes.\n\n### Removed\n#### Linux\n- Remove upstart init configuration files\n\n### Fixed\n- Display consistent colors regardless of monitor color profile on desktop.\n- Fix time added view displayed due to incorrect local clock.\n\n#### Windows\n- Be more scrupulous about removing temporary files used by the installer and uninstaller.\n- Fix issue where local name resolution fails. This requires users to ensure that non-tunnel\n  interfaces are configured correctly to use local custom DNS.\n- Configure DNS correctly when the DNS client service is disabled or not responding.\n\n\n## [2022.2] - 2022-06-13\nThis release is for desktop only.\n\nThis release is identical to 2022.2-beta2.\n\n\n## [2022.2-beta2] - 2022-06-10\n### Added\n- Include creation timestamp for devices in the CLI.\n\n### Changed\n- List devices on an account sorted by creation date, oldest to newest, instead of alphabetically.\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix logout failing if the API cannot be reached in the GUI.\n\n\n## [2022.2-beta1] - 2022-05-16\n### Added\n- Extend DNS blocking with the following new categories: \"Adult content\" and \"gambling\".\n- Obfuscate traffic to the Mullvad API using bridges if it cannot be reached directly.\n- Add device management to desktop app. This simplifies knowing which device is which and adds the\n  option to log out other devices when there are already 5 connected when logging in.\n- Add tray icon tooltip with connection info in desktop app.\n- Add relay and bridge constraints for restricting relay selection to rented or Mullvad-owned\n  relays. Allows filtering servers by ownership in the CLI.\n\n#### Windows\n- Detect mounting and dismounting of volumes, such as VeraCrypt volumes or USB drives,\n  and exclude paths from the tunnel correctly when these occur. This sometimes only works\n  when the GUI frontend is running.\n- Add toggle for split tunneling state.\n\n### Changed\n- Update settings format to `v6`.\n- Move WireGuard TCP obfuscation settings into `mullvad obfuscation` command in CLI.\n- Decrease the size of fonts, some icons and other design elements in the desktop app. This makes it\n  possible to fit more into the same area and makes text easier to read.\n- Don't block the tunnel state machine while starting the tunnel monitor. This also means that\n  the machine will not transition directly from the `disconnected` to the `disconnecting` state\n  if an error occurs.\n- Change behavior of escape key in the desktop app. It now navigates backwards one step instead of\n  to the main view. To navigate back to the main view Shift+Escape can be used.\n- Update Electron from 16.0.4 to 18.0.3.\n- Randomize bridge selection with a bias in favor of close bridges.\n- Make login field keep previous value when submitting an incorrect account number in desktop app.\n- Decrease the time it takes to connect to WireGuard relays by sending an ICMP packet immediately.\n- Pause API interactions when the daemon has not been used for 3 days.\n- Simplified output of `mullvad status` command.\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix the sometimes incorrect time added text after adding time to the account.\n- Fix scrollbar no longer responsive and usable when covered by other elements.\n- Improve tunnel bypass for the API sometimes not working in the connecting state.\n- Fix resource leak caused by location check.\n- Fix issue where sockets didn't close after disconnecting from WireGuard servers over TCP\n  by updating `udp-over-tcp` to 0.2.\n- Parse old account history formats correctly when they are empty.\n- Use suspend-aware timers for relay list updates and version checks on all platforms.\n- Don't attempt to use bridges when using OpenVPN over UDP and bridge mode is set to auto.\n- Use the entry endpoint when the relay selector fails to find a relay using the preferred\n  constraints and the tunnel protocol is \"any\". Previously, the entry endpoint was ignored in this\n  case.\n\n#### Windows\n- Fix \"Open Mullvad VPN\" tray context menu item not working after toggling unpinned window setting.\n- Fix apps not always visible in split tunneling view after browsing for an app and then removing it\n  from the excluded applications.\n- Fix navigation resetting to main view when toggling the unpinned window setting.\n- Log splitting event reason correctly.\n\n#### macOS\n- Fix thrashing due to DNS config monitoring.\n\n### Security\n#### Windows\n- Update split tunnel driver to 1.2.1.0. This fixes potential DNS leaks seen when excluding at least\n  one application.\n\n\n## [2022.1] - 2022-03-01\nThis release is for desktop only.\n\nThis release is identical to 2022.1-beta2 except that it has translations for new texts in the UI.\n\n\n## [2022.1-beta2] - 2022-02-22\n### Added\n- Show warning message when blocking internet while logged out, and make it possible to unblock the\n  connection from the login view.\n\n### Fixed\n- Prevent settings file being truncated before being read. This caused the daemon to read an empty\n  settings file, restore to default settings and log out.\n- Improve performance for automatically scrolling text in desktop app.\n- Increase availability of the API by allowing to issue requests to the API when connecting to the\n  relay even if account data might be invalid.\n\n### Security\n- Enable \"Always require VPN\" by default if the settings cannot be parsed. This reduces the number\n  of errors that lead to the daemon unexpectedly starting into non-blocking mode.\n\n\n## [2022.1-beta1] - 2022-02-14\n### Added\n- Add information about the always on kill switch in the desktop app.\n- Add WireGuard multihop setting and entry location selection to desktop app.\n- Add malware blocking to the desktop app. Implemented via DNS on the relays.\n- Add changes dialog which will include the most notable changes in each new version.\n\n### Changed\n- Keep unspecified constraints unchanged in the CLI when providing specific tunnel constraints\n  instead of setting them to default values.\n- Obscure account number in account view and add button for copying instead of copying when text is\n  pressed.\n- Disable logging of translation errors in production. This will among other things prevent error\n  messages from translating the country in the disconnected state.\n- Update Electron from 15.0.0 to 16.0.4.\n- Stop preferring OpenVPN when bridge mode is enabled.\n- CLI command for setting a specific server by hostname is no longer case sensitive.\n  Example: `mullvad relay set hostname SE9-WIREGUARD` should now work.\n- Update the default Shadowsocks password to `mullvad` and cipher to `aes-256-gcm` in the CLI\n  when using it to configure a *custom Shadowsocks bridge*. The Mullvad bridges recently changed\n  these parameters on port 443 (which is the default port).\n\n#### Windows\n- Update wireguard-nt to 0.10.1.\n- Make wireguard-nt the default driver for WireGuard. This is used instead of wireguard-go and\n  Wintun.\n- Increase firewall transaction timeout from 2 to 5 seconds to lower the chance of errors when\n  setting the firewall policy.\n- Update split tunnel driver to 1.2.0.0. Notably, this driver release allows firewall filters\n  added by other software to block excluded apps.\n\n### Removed\n#### Windows\n- Drop support for pre-Windows 10 systems.\n\n### Fixed\n- Always kill `sslocal` if the tunnel monitor fails to start when using bridges.\n- Show relay location constraint correctly in the CLI when it is set to `any`.\n- Prevent gRPC from trying to run the app-daemon IPC communication through a HTTP proxy when the\n  environment variable `http_proxy` is set. This caused the app to fail to connect to the daemon.\n- Disable built-in DNS resolver in Electron. Prevents Electron from establishing connections to\n  DNS servers set in system network preferences.\n- Fix tray context menu showing or executing wrong actions, using wrong language or in other\n  ways not update properly.\n\n#### macOS\n- Resolve issues with the app blocking internet connectivity after sleep or when connecting to new\n  wireless networks.\n- Fix issue where the app would get stuck in offline state after a reboot or a reinstall by using\n  `route monitor` instead of relying on `SCNetworkReachability` API to infer whether the host is\n  offline.\n\n#### Windows\n- Fix app size after changing display scale.\n- Fix daemon not starting if all excluded app paths reside on non-existent/unmounted volumes.\n- Remove tray icon of current running app version when upgrading.\n- Allow Mullvad wireguard-nt tunnels to work simultaneously with other wg-nt tunnels.\n- Fix notifications on Windows not showing if window is unpinned and hidden.\n- Wait for IP interfaces to arrive before trying to configure them when using wireguard-nt.\n- Fix panic that occurs in the split tunnel monitor when a path consisting only of a prefix,\n  such as \"C:\", is excluded using the CLI.\n\n#### Linux\n- Remove auto-launch file, GUI settings and other files created by the app in user directories, when\n  uninstalling/purging.\n\n### Security\n- Restrict which applications are allowed to communicate with the API while in a blocking state.\n  This prevents malicious scripts on websites from trying to do so. On Windows, only\n  `mullvad-problem-report.exe` and `mullvad-daemon.exe` executables are allowed to reach the API,\n  whereas on Linux and macOS only root processes are able to reach the API.\n\n\n## [2021.6] - 2021-11-17\n### Fixed\n- Fix the font for Russian. Issue introduced in 2021.6-beta1.\n  Bundle a version of Source Sans Pro containing Cyrillic.\n\n\n## [2021.6-beta1] - 2021-11-03\n### Added\n#### Windows\n- Add black monochromatic tray icon for Windows when using light color for tray.\n\n### Changed\n- Update Electron from 11.4.9 to 15.0.0.\n- Revamp main view with blurred background behind semi-transparent buttons and switch to\n  correct font for logo. Also a slightly less bold font in other parts of the app.\n\n### Removed\n- Remove the old Let's encrypt root certificate from the API REST client. Only bundle and\n  use the latest certificate.\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix desktop app showing a future date for when WireGuard key was generated.\n- Fix desktop app split tunneling view to not overflow on very long application names.\n- Prevent API requests from being made prior to the tunnel state machine being set up.\n  Rarely, failed requests could result in a deadlock.\n- Fix segmentation fault when closing app (the GUI).\n\n#### Windows\n- Fix detection of Windows 11. Problem reports will now correctly report Windows 11 instead\n  of Windows 10.\n- Fix race condition in split tunneling initialization. Listen to route changes before reading\n  out the default route.\n- Fix bug in split tunneling code that could make the kernel driver and mullvad-daemon out of\n  sync around which programs should be excluded when the driver took longer to respond.\n- Use route-based offline monitoring. Fixes issues where the daemon falsely entered the offline\n  state, for example when using virtual switches in Hyper-V.\n- Improve repositioning of app window after connecting/disconnecting external monitor.\n\n#### macOS\n- Prevent app from showing when dragging tray icon on macOS.\n- Move window after dragging tray icon to new position.\n\n#### Linux\n- Greatly simplify behavior around custom DNS when using systemd-resolved, by not setting DNS config\n  on interfaces other than our tunnel interface.\n\n\n## [2021.5] - 2021-10-25\nThis release is for desktop only.\n\nThis release is identical to 2021.5-beta2 except that it has translations for new texts in the UI.\n\n\n## [2021.5-beta2] - 2021-10-19\n### Fixed\n#### macOS\n- Fix issue with getting PF status due to an ABI change on macOS 12 Beta 9.\n\n\n## [2021.5-beta1] - 2021-10-12\n### Added\n- Added possibility to filter locations by provider in the desktop app.\n- Add ability to use WireGuard over TCP towards all relays via the desktop CLI. However,\n  this service is not yet available on all relays. At the time of writing, this only\n  works towards `se6-wireguard`, `se9-wireguard` and `se17-wireguard`.\n- Add GUI environment variable `MULLVAD_DISABLE_UPDATE_NOTIFICATION`. If set to `1`, GUI\n  notification will be disabled when an update is available. This is not intended to be set by\n  normal users.\n- Add setting for changing between IPv4 and IPv6 for the connection to WireGuard servers on\n  desktop.\n\n#### Windows\n- Resolve symbolic links and junctions for excluded apps.\n- Add opt-in support for NT kernel WireGuard driver. It can be enabled in the CLI.\n  Should give better performance. Especially over Wi-Fi.\n\n### Changed\n- Only use the account history file to store the last used account.\n- Update the out of time-view and new account-view to make it more user friendly.\n- Change the app update notification when the suggested version is a beta, to include that it's a\n  beta.\n- Upgrade OpenVPN from 2.5.1 to 2.5.3.\n- Update Electron from 11.2.3 to 11.4.9.\n- Move OpenVPN and WireGuard settings in the advanced settings view into separate settings views.\n- Return to main view in desktop app after being hidden/closed for two minutes.\n- Settings format updated from `v3` to `v5`.\n\n#### Linux\n- Always send DNS requests inside the tunnel for excluded processes when using public custom DNS.\n\n#### Windows\n- Upgrade Wintun from 0.10.4 to 0.13.\n- Reduce tunnel setup time for OpenVPN by disabling DAD.\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix link to download page not always using the beta URL when it should.\n- Fix deadlock that may occur when the API cannot be reached while entering the connecting state.\n- Fix bug causing desktop app to log in if account number field was filled when removing account\n  history.\n- Fix lack of account expiry updates when using the app in unpinned mode and improve updating of\n  account expiry overall.\n- Fix incorrect WireGuard relay filtering when exit and entry locations overlap.\n- Fix wrong translations when switching to/from unpinned window after changing language in the\n  desktop app.\n- Fix in-app notification button not working for some notifications.\n- Fix incorrectly positioned navigation bar title when navigating back to a scrolled down view.\n- Fix connectivity check for WireGuard multihop when the exit hop is down.\n- Fix incorrect location and connection status while disconnecting and incorrect location in the\n  beginning while connecting in the desktop app.\n- Improve responsiveness of the controls and status text in the main view in the desktop app.\n- Read macOS scrollbar visibility settings to decide whether or not the scrollbars should hide when\n  not scrolling.\n- Fix IPv6 connections to WireGuard servers by not dropping select neighbor advertisements and\n  solicitations.\n\n#### Linux\n- Make offline monitor aware of routing table changes.\n- Assign local DNS servers to more appropriate interfaces when using systemd-resolved.\n- Disable DNS over TLS for tunnel's DNS config when using systemd-resolved.\n- Fix DNS when combining a static resolv.conf with ad blocking DNS.\n- Check connectivity correctly on IPv6-only networks.\n\n#### Windows\n- Fix failure to restart the daemon when resuming from \"fast startup\" hibernation.\n- Fix OpenVPN not responding to shutdown signals when they are sent early on, causing it to close\n  after 30 seconds.\n- Disable notification actions for persistent notifications since they were called when pressing\n  close.\n- Remove deleted network devices from consideration in the offline monitor. Previously, the offline\n  monitor may have falsely reported the machine to be online due to a race condition.\n- Recover firewall state correctly when restarting the service after a crash. This would fail when\n  paths were excluded.\n- Fix daemon not starting when a path is excluded on a drive that has since been removed.\n- Prefer WireGuard if the constraints preclude OpenVPN and the tunnel protocol is \"auto\", instead\n  of failing due to \"no matching relays\".\n- Retry tunnel device creation multiple times to work around issues early after boot or hibernation.\n\n\n## [2021.4] - 2021-06-30\nThis release is for desktop only.\n\nThis release is identical to 2021.4-beta1 except that it has translations for new texts in the UI.\n\n\n## [2021.4-beta1] - 2021-06-09\nThis release is for desktop only.\n\n### Added\n- When `MULLVAD_MANAGEMENT_SOCKET_GROUP` is set, only allow the specified group to access the\n  management interface UDS socket. This means that only users in that group can use the CLI and GUI.\n- Support WireGuard over TCP for custom VPN relays in the CLI. (Our relays don't support this yet).\n- Make app native on Apple Silicon.\n- Support WireGuard multihop using an entry endpoint constraint in the CLI.\n- Add Ad and tracker blocking to the desktop app. Implemented via DNS on the relays.\n\n#### Windows\n- Add split tunneling as a beta feature. Allows excluding some applications from the VPN tunnel.\n\n### Changed\n- Upgrade OpenVPN from 2.5.0 to 2.5.1.\n- Replace CLI command `mullvad custom-dns` with the new command `mullvad dns`.\n- Upgrade wireguard-go to `20210521230051` (Windows: v0.3.14)\n\n#### Linux\n- Only allow packets with the mark set to `0x6d6f6c65` to communicate with the relay server.\n  Previously, bridges were expected to run as root instead.\n- Use an ICMP socket instead of relying on a `ping` binary in `$PATH` to establish if a tunnel is\n  working.\n\n#### macOS\n- Update shape of macOS icon to be in line with Apple's guidelines.\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix relay selection failing to pick a WireGuard relay when no tunnel protocol is specified.\n- Fix time left not always being translated in desktop app settings.\n- Fix API address cache to use the supplied ports instead of always using port 443.\n- Do not try to parse an empty account history.\n\n#### Windows\n- Prevent tray icons from being extracted to `%TEMP%` directory.\n- Fix failure to create Wintun adapter due to a residual network interface by upgrading Wintun to\n  0.10.4.\n- Wait indefinitely for IP interfaces to attach to the tunnel device to prevent early timeouts,\n  and errors setting interface metrics.\n- Prevent Microsoft Store from dropping packets in WireGuard tunnels.\n\n#### Linux\n- Fix find `mullvad-vpn.desktop` in `XDG_DATA_DIRS` instead of using hardcoded path.\n\n#### MacOS\n- Set correct permissions for daemon's launch file in installer.\n- Fix downgrades on macOS silently keeping previous version.\n- Fix other menubar context menus not always closing when opening app on macOS 11.\n\n### Security\n#### Linux\n- Drop packets being *forwarded* unless they are approved by the same rules as incoming or outgoing\n  traffic.\n\n\n## [2021.3] - 2021-04-28\nThis release is for desktop only.\n\nThis release is identical to 2021.3-beta2\n\n\n## [2021.3-beta2] - 2021-04-22\nThis release is for Windows only.\nThis release has no functional changes compared to 2021.3-beta1. The only\ndifference is that the installer and the binaries are signed with our\nnew code signing certificate. The old one is expiring.\n\nThe new certificate is brand new and Windows does not really trust it yet.\nSo there might be warnings when installing this for a while.\n\n\n## [2021.3-beta1] - 2021-04-13\nThis release is for desktop only.\n\n### Added\n- Enable isolation of the Electron renderer process to protect against potentially malicious third\n  party dependencies.\n- Preserve log of old daemon instance when upgrading on Desktop.\n- Add 51820 to list of WireGuard ports in app settings.\n- Add option to connect to WireGuard relays over IPv6.\n- Add Burmese translations.\n\n#### Linux\n- Always enable `src_valid_mark` config option when connecting to allow policty based routing.\n\n### Changed\n- Update Electron from 11.0.2 to 11.2.1 which includes a newer Chromium version and\n  security patches.\n- Allow provider constraint to specify multiple hosting providers.\n- Only download a new relay list if it has been modified.\n- Connect to the API only via TLS 1.3\n- Shrink account history capactity from 3 account entries to 1.\n- Allow whitespace in account token in CLI.\n- Read account token from standard input unless given as an argument in CLI.\n- Make WireGuard automatic key rotation interval mandatory and between 1 and 7 days.\n- Show default, minimum, and maximum key rotation intervals in CLI.\n- Attempt to send problem reports using other endpoints if using the primary one fails.\n- Upgrade wireguard-go to version 20210225140808 (Windows: v0.3.8)\n- Settings format updated to `v3`.\n\n#### Windows\n- Upgrade Wintun from 0.9.2 to 0.10.1.\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix delay in showing/hiding update notification when toggling beta program.\n- Improve responsiveness when reconnecting after some failed connection attempts.\n- Fix GUI not showing correct view if disconnected from the daemon during app startup.\n- Fix incorrectly displayed \"inconsistent version\" text in settings if disconnected from daemon on\n  startup.\n\n#### Windows\n- Fix \"cannot find the file\" error while creating a Wintun adapter by upgrading Wintun.\n- Retry when creating a WireGuard tunnel fails due to no default routes being found.\n\n#### Linux\n- Stop using NM for managing DNS if it's newer than 1.26.\n- Fix DNS issues where NM would overwrite Mullvad tunnel's DNS config in systemd-resolved.\n- Fix issues with hosts where the firewall is doing reverse path filtering.\n- Further improve offline monitor to properly receive `ENETUNREACH`.\n\n### Security\n- Always reconnect appropriately after an upgrade. Previously, installing the app twice in\n  succession, with auto-connect disabled, would cause it to re-launch in the disconnected state.\n\n\n## [2021.2] - 2021-02-18\nThis release is for desktop only.\n\nThis release is identical to 2021.2-beta1\n\n## [2021.2-beta1] - 2021-02-17\nThis release is for desktop only.\n\n### Fixed\n#### Linux\n- Fix crash when trying to apply IPv6 routes for OpenVPN when IPv6 is disabled.\n- Ignore failure to add IPv6 split-tunneling routing rules when they fail due to IPv6 being\n  unavailable.\n\n#### Windows\n- Fix failure when Wintun adapter name conflicts with that of a non-Wintun adapter.\n- Fix detection of SetupAPI patch when not installed by KB2921916.\n\n\n## [2021.1] - 2021-02-10\nThis release is for desktop only.\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix crash on desktop when entering problem report view when using an outdated app version.\n\n\n## [2021.1-beta2] - 2021-02-03\nThis release is for desktop only.\n\n### Fixed\n- Make it impossible to apply an empty list of custom DNS server IPs.\n  Stops the daemon from getting stuck in the offline state on macOS.\n\n#### Windows\n- Only load and unload the Wintun driver once instead of on every connection.\n  Will hopefully fix an issue where it gave an error\n\n\n## [2021.1-beta1] - 2021-01-25\nThis release is for desktop only.\n\n### Added\n- Add header containing OS version to version-check API call to enable OS specific compatibility and\n  vulnerability checks.\n- Add `TALPID_DISABLE_OFFLINE_MONITOR` environment variable to allow users to disable offline\n  detection.\n\n#### Android\n- Allow to configure the tunnel to use custom DNS servers.\n- Show only applications that has INTERNET permission on split tunnel screen.\n\n#### Linux\n- Improved compatiblitiy with newer versions of systemd-resolved.\n- Add version data to problem reports for the following software: the kernel, NetworkManager,\n  WireGuard kernel module, SystemD.\n\n### Changed\n- Allow the API to be accessed while in a blocking state.\n- Prefer the last used API endpoint when the service starts back up, as well as in other tools such\n  as the problem report tool.\n- Migrate cache to a directory readable by all users, consistent with Android and Linux.\n- Change the default value of the GUI auto-connect setting to \"off\" and respect the setting when\n  logging in.\n\n#### Linux\n- Improve offline check to query the routing table to allow users to use a bridged adapter as their\n  primary interface.\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix Turkish translations for on/off in the bridge settings. They were inverted, so it was\n  confusing to change the setting.\n- Stop returning bogus version information when there is no version cache.\n\n#### Linux\n- Fix missing app window icon in Xfce.\n\n#### Windows\n- Resolve single-label hostnames correctly.\n\n### Security\n- Default to connecting when the daemon starts if the target state cache cannot be read or parsed.\n\n#### Linux\n- Prevent the private tunnel IPv6 address from being detectable on a local network when using\n  OpenVPN by correctly applying the fix for\n  [CVE-2019-14899](https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2019/q4/122).\n\n#### Windows\n- Deny network access to the OpenVPN plugin pipe, which allowed for anonymous write access when\n  passwordless file sharing was enabled.\n\n\n## [2020.8-beta2] - 2020-12-11\nThis release is for desktop only.\n\n### Added\n#### Android\n- Add a screen to view the logs included in a problem report.\n\n### Changed\n- Upgrade wireguard-go to v0.0.20201118.\n- Reduce logging about time outs when conneting to a WireGuard tunnel.\n\n### Fixed\n#### Android\n- Fix login appearing to be cancelled after leaving the login screen while logging in.\n- Fix login input area missing some times when opening the login screen.\n\n\n## [2020.8-beta1] - 2020-11-30\nThis release is for Android only.\n\n### Added\n- Improve accessibility in the desktop app. UI elements now have the correct role\n  and are labeled to allow usage of a screen reader.\n- Add `--wait` flag to `connect`, `disconnect` and `reconnect` CLI subcommands to make the CLI wait\n  for the target state to be reached before exiting.\n- Navigate back to the main view when escape is pressed.\n- Add support for custom DNS resolvers on Windows, macOS and Linux. For now only resolvers in the\n  local network will work properly.\n\n#### Windows\n- Add setting that unpins the window from the tray icon to let the user move it around freely.\n\n### Changed\n- Never use DNS to get the IP to contact the Mullvad API over. Instead a list of IPs is bundled\n  with the app, and updates are fetched from the API itself. This list is then shuffled and used\n  to pick a way to reach the API. This avoids censored/fake DNS responses and increases the\n  likelihood to be able to talk to the API.\n- Remove WireGuard keys during uninstallation after the firewall is unlocked.\n- Rename CLI subcommand `mullvad relay set relay` to `mullvad relay set hostname`.\n- Upgrade OpenVPN from 2.4.9 to 2.5.0.\n- Upgrade Electron from 8.5.2 to Electron 11.0.2.\n\n#### Android\n- Remove the Quit button.\n- Add button to remove account and WireGuard key from history in the login screen.\n- Improve navigation in the app using a keyboard, so that touchless devices (like TVs) can be used\n  more smoothly.\n- Run app in landscape mode on TVs.\n- Try to connect even if VPN permission is denied, so that the app shows an error message saying\n  that the VPN permission was denied.\n\n#### Windows\n- Fully uninstall the old app when performing a downgrade. This solves the problem of downgrades\n  not being able to migrate from something newer. For example it fully removes any blocking\n  firewall rules a newer app might have put in place.\n- Use Wintun instead of the OpenVPN TAP driver for OpenVPN.\n\n#### Linux\n- Increase NetworkManager device readiness timeout to 15 seconds.\n- Set up routes for OpenVPN using our route manager instead of relying on OpenVPN to do it.\n- Use rule-based routing and static routes. Avoids monitoring and duplicating the main routing\n  table into a separate table.\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix missing map animation after selecting a new location in the desktop app.\n- Fix crash on older kernels which report a default route through the loopback interface.\n\n#### Android\n- Fix connect action button sometimes showing itself as \"Cancel\" instead of \"Secure my connection\"\n  for a few seconds.\n- Fix the notification sometimes leaving the foreground and becoming dismissable even if the UI was\n  still visible.\n- Fix crash if connection to service is lost while opening the Split Tunneling settings screen.\n- Fix rare crash that could occur when the tunnel state changes when showing or hiding the quick\n  settings tile.\n- Fix app starting by itself sometimes.\n- Fix apps not being excluded from the tunnel sometimes if auto-connect was enabled.\n- Fix crash that happened sometimes when closing the app or when requesting from the notification\n  or the quick-settings tile for the app to connect or disconnect.\n- Fix app showing that it was blocking connections when it wasn't when VPN permission was denied.\n- Fix internet not working for a minute or two after changing Allow LAN setting.\n\n#### Windows\n- Fix log output encoding for Windows modules.\n- Fix app not appearing on top in some situations when pressing the tray icon.\n- Fix memory leak in Windows firewall code.\n\n#### Linux\n- Stop reconnecting when using WireGuard and NetworkManager.\n- Reset DNS config correctly when the tunnel monitor unexpectedly goes down.\n- Set search domains in NetworkManager's DNS configuration, resolving issues where NetworkManager\n  is used to manage DNS via systemd-resolved.\n- Fix incorrect version string in .deb installer causing downgrade warnings when upgrading from beta\n  to stable.\n- Fix memory leak in firewall code via updating `nftnl` dependency.\n- Handle IPv6 traffic correctly using `mullvad-exclude` when there is no default route to any\n  non-tunnel interface.\n- Fix issues managing DNS when dnsmasq is used with NetworkManager.\n- Fix issues with managing kernel WireGuard device via NetworkManager.\n- Disable NetworkManager's connectivity check before applying firewall rules to avoid triggering\n  NetworkManager's\n  [bug](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/NetworkManager/NetworkManager/-/issues/312#note_453724)\n\n### Security\n- Restore the last target state if the daemon crashes. Previously, if auto-connect and\n  \"Always require VPN\" were disabled, the service would reset the firewall upon starting back up,\n  even if the tunnel was up when the crash occurred.\n- Add firewall rules for `mullvad-exclude`, i.e. split tunneling, that disallow all traffic in the\n  tunnel other than non-custom DNS traffic. This prevents leaks into the tunnel.\n- Force OpenVPN to use TLS 1.3 or newer.\n\n#### Windows\n- Block all traffic received or sent before the BFE service and daemon service have started during\n  boot, if \"Always require VPN\" or auto-connect is enabled.\n\n\n## [2020.7] - 2020-11-18\nThis release is identical to 2020.7-beta2.\nThis release has no differences for Windows and macOS compared to 2020.6\n\n\n## [2020.7-beta2] - 2020-11-16\nThis release is for desktop only. It only has changes for Linux\n\n### Fixed\n#### Linux\n- Parse routes more permissively and log parsing errors less verbosely.\n\n\n## [2020.7-beta1] - 2020-11-10\nThis release is for desktop only. It only has changes for Linux\n\n### Fixed\n#### Linux\n- Order routes by prefix size in ascending order when applying them.\n  Fixes an issue where seemingly manually added routes would be returned\n  from the kernel in an order which can't be applied.\n- If possible, use NetworkManager to create a WireGuard interface so that DNS can be managed\n  via NetworkManager as well. This fixes the issue where the daemon will reconnect\n  spuriously when using NetworkManager and WireGuard.\n- Fix route parsing bug in route monitor by ignoring loopback routes.\n- Apply DNS config quicker when managing DNS via NetworkManager.\n- When NetworkManager is managing /etc/resolv.conf but ultimately using systemd-resolved, use\n  systemd-resolved directly to manage DNS.\n- Only use WireGuard kernel implementation if DNS isn't managed via NetworkManager.\n\n\n## [2020.6] - 2020-10-20\nThis release is for desktop only.\n\nThis release is identical to 2020.6-beta3 except updated GUI translations\n\n\n## [2020.6-beta3] - 2020-10-06\nThis release is for desktop only.\n\n### Added\n#### Linux\n- Add support for WireGuard's kernel module if it's loaded.\n- Add tray context menu with actions.\n\n### Changed\n#### Linux\n- Open and focus app when opened from context menu instead of toggling the window.\n\n### Fixed\n- Start key rotation when WireGuard key is first created.\n- Remove firewall filters (unblock internet access) when \"Always require VPN\" is enabled and the app\n  is uninstalled.\n\n#### Android\n- Fix rare crash that could happen when starting the background service.\n- Fix rare crash that happened with large text sizes and long location names on the main screen.\n- Fix UI not updating in split screen mode when the window is unfocused.\n- Fix split tunneling not being correctly configured after restarting the app.\n- Fix app reopening after pressing the Quit button because app was running multiple tasks.\n- Fix inconsistent behavior of the quick-settings tile when logged out. It would sometimes enter the\n  blocking state and sometimes open the UI for the user to login. Now it always opens the UI.\n- Mark the VPN connection as not metered, so that Android properly reports if the connection is or\n  isn't metered based solely on the underlying network, and not on the VPN connection.\n\n#### Linux\n- Fix split tunneling rules preventing `systemd-resolved` from performing DNS lookups for excluded\n  processes.\n- Honor routes other than the default route with `mullvad-exclude`. This is mainly to improve\n  routing within LANs.\n\n### Security\n- Stop resetting the firewall after an upgrade to not leak after an upgrade.\n\n\n## [2020.6-beta2] - 2020-08-27\nThis release is for Android only.\n\n### Added\n- Add CLI command to set the location constraint via `mullvad relay set relay HOSTNAME`.\n- Add a provider relay constraint, which restricts relay selection to a given hosting provider.\n- Include hosting providers in the CLI for `mullvad relay list` and `mullvad bridge list`.\n\n### Changed\n- Use gRPC for communication between frontends and the backend instead of JSON-RPC.\n- Show a warning in the CLI if the provided location constraints don't match any known relay.\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix high CPU usage in 2020.6-beta1. This was due to an incorrectly initialized stream in the\n  relay list updater.\n- Fix the relay list not being updated in 2020.6-beta1 after the daemon has started.\n\n#### Android\n- Fix possible crash when starting the app, caused by trying to use JNI functions before the library\n  is loaded.\n- Fix crash when selecting the whole text entered for the voucher code and then deleting it in the\n  Redeem Voucher dialog.\n- Show \"Exclude applications\" header if needed when entering the \"Split tunneling\" screen.\n- Fix check for update versions and check for support for current version.\n- Fix crash that could happen when leaving the Select Location screen.\n- Don't show out-of-time notification for newly created accounts.\n\n\n## [2020.6-beta1] - 2020-08-20\nThis release is for Android only.\n\n### Added\n- Show system notification when account has expired.\n- Add fish shell completions for the mullvad CLI.\n- Reconnect with a new key when WireGuard key is rotated automatically, previously the tunnel would\n  time out before reconnecting.\n\n#### Linux\n- Add split tunneling menu under advanced settings in Linux app.\n\n#### Android\n- Add split-tunnelling, allowing apps to be configured to be excluded from the tunnel.\n- Add localized app messages.\n\n### Changed\n- Upgrade from Electron 7 to Electron 8.\n- Change version string parsing to never suggest the user to upgrade to an older version.\n- Make connectivity checker more resilient to suspension.\n- Make uninstaller on desktop platforms attempt to remove WireGuard keys from accounts.\n- Make important notifications not timeout on macOS and remain in the notification list on Linux.\n- Add exponential backoff to relay list downloader.\n- Display the original block reason in the non-blocking error state, and why applying the blocking\n  policy failed.\n- Don't show account time expired notification for newly created accounts.\n\n#### Android\n- Show a system notification when the account time will soon run out.\n- Changed how the Select Location screen scrolls so that more items can be viewed at the same time.\n\n#### Windows\n- Upgrade Wintun from 0.7 to 0.8.1.\n- Display causes of firewall errors in the GUI.\n\n#### Linux\n- Allow users to specify `net_cls` controller mountpoint via `TALPID_NET_CLS_MOUNT_DIR`. The\n  specified mountpoint will only be used if the controller isn't mounted already.\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix connectivity monitor for WireGuard not disconnecting from a relay when connectivity is lost.\n- Forward firewall errors to the GUI in the connecting state, instead of showing a generic message\n  about failing to start the tunnel.\n\n#### Windows\n- Fix window flickering by disabling window animations.\n- Fix WireGuard not connecting if IPv6 is disabled in the adapter or OS. `libwg` would time out\n  waiting for an IPv6 interface to become available.\n\n#### Android\n- Fix Connect screen sometimes becoming unusually tall. This ended up causing the screen to be\n  scrolled up and made the UI elements unable to be seen until the user scrolled down.\n- Fix connect action from quick-settings tile or notification sometimes opening the UI instead of\n  connecting.\n- Fix notification sometimes not being dismissible.\n- Fix toggle switch sometimes getting stuck.\n\n#### Linux\n- Fix `systemd-resolved` DNS management by not parsing `/etc/resolv.conf`.\n- Fix issue where DNS configuration would not be reset when NetworkManager was used and the daemon\n  was stopped ungracefully. This persisted after reboots.\n\n\n## [2020.5] - 2020-06-25\n### Added\n- Add Korean, Polish and Thai languages to the desktop app.\n\n\n## [2020.5-beta2] - 2020-06-16\n### Added\n#### Android\n- Add buttons to buy credit and redeem voucher in Account screen.\n- Show a notification banner warning when the account time will soon run out.\n\n### Changed\n- Send an ICMP reject message or TCP reset packet when blocking outgoing packets to prevent\n  timeouts.\n\n#### macOS\n- Use `SCNetworkReachability` to help determine connectivity of host. Helps bring the app online\n  faster when the computer wakes up from sleep.\n\n#### Android\n- Show the remaining account time in the Settings screen in days if it's less than 3 months.\n- Prevent commands to connect or disconnect to be sent when the device is locked.\n- Make all screens scrollable to better handle small screens and split-screen mode.\n\n### Fixed\n- Show both WireGuard and OpenVPN servers in location list when protocol is set to automatic on\n  Linux and macOS.\n- Fix missing in app notification about unsupported version.\n- Prevent auto-connect on login if the account is out of time.\n- Fix race that caused WireGuard key upload to fail which could cause the \"too many keys\" error and\n  the tunnel to invalidly fall back to OpenVPN.\n\n#### Android\n- Fix crash when that happened sometimes when the app tried to start the daemon service on recent\n  Android versions.\n- Fix quitting the app sometimes failing.\n- Fix WireGuard key status events being lost by the UI, causing stale information to be shown.\n- Fix time left in account not showing in settings screen.\n- Fix attempt to connect when the app doesn't have the VPN permission.\n- Fix crash that happened sometimes when the WireGuard key was loaded too quickly.\n- Fix crash when entering split-screen mode whilst on the Report a Problem screen.\n- Fix invalid back stack history when connection to service is lost and the app returns to the\n  launch screen.\n- Fix app leaving settings screen when entering split-screen mode.\n- Fix app sometimes leaving Welcome screen prematurely after creating an account.\n\n#### Windows\n- Fix race in network adapter monitor that could result in data corruption and crashes.\n- Upgrade `miow` dependency to stop daemon from crashing when the management interface named pipes\n  were accessed with `accesschk.exe` and some web browsers.\n- Fix race that may rarely occur during install when obtaining the GUID of a newly created TAP\n  adapter.\n\n### Security\n- Tighten the firewall rules that were allowing traffic to the relay server over the physical\n  network interface. On Linux and macOS now only processes running under root are allowed to send\n  traffic to this port and IP. On Windows only the Mullvad VPN binaries are allowed to send.\n  This fixes audit ticket [`MUL-02-002`].\n\n#### Windows\n- Tighten the firewall rule allowing traffic on port 53 to the relay server IP on the physical\n  interfaces if the VPN tunnel is established on port 53 to only allow UDP. This fixes\n  audit ticket [`MUL-02-004`].\n- Deny access to the management interface named pipe for the `NT AUTHORITY\\NETWORK` group.\n  This makes the named pipe no longer accessible under the `IPC$` network share.\n  This fixes audit ticket [`MUL-02-007`].\n\n#### Android\n- Ignore touch events when another view is shown on top of the app in order to prevent tapjacking\n  attacks. Fixes audit ticket [`MUL-02-003`].\n- Prevent screens showing potentially sensitive data from being recorded. Fixes audit\n  ticket [`MUL-02-003`].\n\n[`MUL-02-002`]: audits/2020-06-12-cure53.md#identified-vulnerabilities\n[`MUL-02-003`]: audits/2020-06-12-cure53.md#miscellaneous-issues\n[`MUL-02-004`]: audits/2020-06-12-cure53.md#miscellaneous-issues\n[`MUL-02-007`]: audits/2020-06-12-cure53.md#identified-vulnerabilities\n\n## [2020.5-beta1] - 2020-05-18\n### Added\n- Add a new Let's Encrypt root certificate.\n\n#### Android\n- Add possibility to create account from the login screen.\n- Add welcome screen for newly created accounts.\n- Allow submitting voucher codes to add time to the account.\n- Add Out Of Time screen for user to add more time to account once it expires.\n\n### Changed\n- Move location of the account data (including the WireGuard keys), so that it isn't lost when the\n  system cache is cleaned.\n- Rename \"Block when disconnected\" setting to \"Always require VPN\" and add additional explanation\n  of the setting.\n- Embed TLS certificates used for HTTPS into the binary rather than loading them from disk at\n  runtime.\n- Ignore case when setting the relay or bridge location in the CLI.\n- Upgrade OpenVPN from 2.4.8 to 2.4.9 and the OpenSSL version it uses from 1.1.1d to 1.1.1g.\n- Upgrade shadowsocks-rust to version 1.8.10.\n- Always enable the beta program when running a beta version.\n- Increase relay list download failure retry interval from 5 to 15 minutes. And from 5 seconds\n  to 15 minutes for the WireGuard key rotation retry interval.\n\n#### Android\n- Adjust the minimum supported Android version to correctly reflect the supported versions decided\n  in 2020.4-beta2. The app will now only install on Android 7 and later (API level 24).\n\n### Fixed\n#### Android\n- Fix crash when leaving WireGuard Key screen while key is still verifying.\n- Fix crash that sometimes happens right after some other unrelated crash.\n- Fix app not connecting when pressing the notification or quick-settings tile when the service\n  isn't running. It would previously just open the app UI and stay in the disconnected state.\n- Fix crash when requesting to connect from notification or quick-settings tile.\n- Fix version update notifications not appearing.\n- Fix UI losing any settings updates that happen after leaving the app and then coming back.\n- Fix account expiration date disappearing in some circumstances.\n- Fix notification reappearing after quitting the application.\n- Retry when fetching account expiration fails.\n\n\n## [2020.4] - 2020-05-12\nThis release is identical to 2020.4-beta4\n\n\n## [2020.4-beta4] - 2020-05-06\n### Fixed\n- Fix bogus or absent update notifications on the desktop app due to incorrect deserialization of a\n  struct sent from the daemon.\n\n#### Android\n- App will now use packaged relay list if it's newer than the cached one.\n- Fix relay list sort order.\n\n#### Windows\n- Remove all log files on uninstall. Clear install.log on upgrades.\n\n\n## [2020.4-beta3] - 2020-04-29\n### Added\n- Add shell completions for the mullvad CLI. Installed for bash and zsh on Linux and zsh on macOS.\n\n### Changed\n- Downgrade to Electron 7 due to issues with tray icon in Electron 8.\n- Use rustls instead of OpenSSL for TLS encryption to the API and GeoIP location service.\n\n#### Windows\n- When required, attempt to enable IPv6 for network adapters instead of failing.\n\n#### Android\n- Update the WireGuard Key screen so that it looks the same as on the desktop app. It is now reached\n  through the Advanced settings screen.\n\n### Fixed\n- Enable IPv6 in WireGuard regardless of the specified MTU value, previously IPv6 was disabled if\n  the MTU was below 1380.\n\n#### Windows\n- Improve offline detection logic.\n- Enable missing IPv6 interface on the WireGuard TUN adapter when it has been disabled.\n\n#### Android\n- Change button colors on problem report no email confirmation dialog to match the desktop version.\n- Fix crash when attempting to run app from the non-default location, such as the SD card or from a\n  different user profile.\n\n### Security\n#### macOS\n- Ship native Node modules unpacked to prevent malware checks by macOS on each run. The malware\n  checks delayed app startup when \"block when disconnected\" was enabled and performed system network\n  requests to Apple.\n\n#### Android\n- Fix failure to create tunnel when app is started with auto-connect enabled. This would sometimes\n  lead to a traffic leak.\n\n\n## [2020.4-beta2] - 2020-04-08\n### Added\n- Add possibility to create account in the desktop app.\n- Add possibility to pay with voucher in the desktop app.\n\n#### Android\n- Add WireGuard MTU setting.\n\n### Changed\n- Allow `fc00::/7` instead of `fd00::/8` in the firewall when local network sharing is enabled.\n  Should unblock all unique local addresses.\n- Upgrade from Electron 7 to Electron 8.\n- Formalize what operating system versions we support in the [readme](README.md). In practice\n  this means dropped support for Android 5 and 6 and Fedora 28 and 29 right away, Ubuntu 16.04\n  support will end as soon as Ubuntu 20.04 comes out.\n\n#### Windows\n- Windows 7 only: Address packet loss issues with OpenVPN on some systems by reverting the TAP\n  adapter driver to an older NDIS 5 driver.\n\n\n## [2020.4-beta1] - 2020-03-30\n### Added\n- Add signal handlers on Linux, macOS and Android to better log critical faults with the daemon.\n- Add WireGuard MTU setting to desktop app.\n- Add option to receive notifications about new beta releases.\n\n#### Android\n- Add option to enable auto-connecting behavior\n- Include an initial relay list in the APK so that the app can connect to the VPN even if it fails\n  to connect to the API after it is installed.\n- Add a reconnect button to disconnect and connect again without closing the tunnel device to avoid\n  leaking any data during the reconnection.\n- Add quick settings tile to control the tunnel state.\n- Enable IPv6 traffic through the tunnel.\n\n### Changed\n- Prefer WireGuard when tunnel protocol is set to _auto_ on Linux and MacOS.\n- Wait for tunnel state machine to properly shut down, cleaning up the firewall properly on Windows\n  during the daemon shutdown.\n- Switch to new logo.\n- Show better message when the app failed to block all connections after an error.\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix bug that could lead to Javascript error dialog to appear upon the desktop app termination.\n- Fix rendering glitch in the map and improve the map's resource usage.\n\n#### macOS\n- Fix firewall rules to properly handle DNS requests over TCP when \"Local network sharing\" is\n  disabled. Previously DNS requests over TCP would timeout.\n\n#### Android\n- Fix notification action button not working when requesting to connect the tunnel after being\n  disconnected for a long time.\n- Make the settings screen scrollable, so that the quit button is reachable on small screens.\n- Fix connectivity listener leak causing possible battery usage increase.\n- Fix crash that could sometimes happen when restarting the background service.\n- Fix incorrect location information sometimes shown in main screen.\n\n#### Windows\n- Fix bug where failing to initialize the route manager could cause the daemon to get stuck in a\n  blocked state. This only affected WireGuard.\n\n### Security\n- When upgrading or reinstalling while connected, exit the daemon in a blocking state to prevent\n  unintended leaks. This only affects upgrades from this release.\n\n#### Windows\n- Fix issue in daemon where the `block_when_disconnected` setting was sometimes not honored when\n  stopping the daemon. I.e. traffic could flow freely after the daemon was stopped.\n\n#### Android\n- Fix issue where IPv6 traffic could leak outside of the tunnel.\n\n\n## [2020.3] - 2020-02-20\nThis release is identical to 2020.3-beta1\n\n\n## [2020.3-beta1] - 2020-02-20\n### Security\n- Fix stack overflow caused by WireGuard key rotation timers. When the daemon crashed it was\n  restarted automatically. But it did not connect (depending on settings), leaving a leak.\n\n\n## [2020.2] - 2020-02-13\nThis release is identical to 2020.2-beta1\n\n\n## [2020.2-beta1] - 2020-02-13\n### Added\n- Add reconnect button to the desktop app.\n- Add monochrome option for the tray icon on Windows and Linux.\n- Show OS notification when account is close to expiry on desktop platforms.\n- Warn users running old app versions when creating problem report.\n\n#### Android\n- Add option to enable or disable local network sharing.\n- Show account history in login fragment\n\n### Changed\n- Change project copyright and company name from Amagicom AB to Mullvad VPN AB\n- Only reconnect when settings change if a relevant tunnel protocol is used.\n- Adjust padding of tray icon on Windows and Linux to better match other icons.\n- Change the zoomlevel of the map in the desktop app to make it less zoomed in.\n- Bundle new API IP with the app (Old: 193.138.218.73, new: 193.138.218.78)\n\n### Removed\n- Remove city/country labels on map in the desktop app.\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix app sometimes getting stuck in connecting state when using WireGuard.\n\n#### Android\n- Fix crash when removing the service from foreground on Android versions below API level 24.\n- Fix crash that happened in certain situations when retrieving the relay list.\n- Fix crash caused by initialization race condition.\n\n#### Windows\n- Fix \"exhausted namespace\" installation error on some non-English systems.\n\n### Security\n- Stop DNS leak that could happen on all desktop platforms if \"Local network sharing\" was enabled\n  and the device had a default DNS resolver on the local private network. The leak could happen\n  during these states: While connecting, when blocked due to an error happening and when\n  disconnected if the \"block when disconnected\" setting was enabled.\n  This issue has been present on all previous versions of the app.\n\n#### Windows\n- Prevent DNS leak that could happen while connected if \"Local network sharing\" was enabled\n  and the device had a default DNS resolver on the local private network. This issue was\n  only present in the 2020.1 release.\n\n\n## [2020.1] - 2020-02-10\nThis release is identical to 2020.1-beta1\n\n\n## [2020.1-beta1] - 2020-02-05\n### Added\n- Add translations for Finnish and Danish.\n- Copy WireGuard key when clicking on it.\n\n#### Windows\n- Sign all binaries in the app instead of just the installer.\n\n### Changed\n- Increase OpenVPN ping timeout from 20 to 25 seconds. Might make working tunnels disconnect\n  a bit less frequently.\n- Use traffic data from WireGuard to infer connectivity, instead of continuously pinging.\n  Should improve stability of the connection and reduce power use.\n- Update `wireguard-go` to `v0.0.20200121`\n- Remove WireGuard keys from accounts when they are removed from the local account history.\n- Upgrade from Electron 6 to Electron 7.\n- Disable WireGuard protocol option if there's no WireGuard key.\n\n#### Android\n- Wait for traffic to be routed through the tunnel device before advertising blocked state.\n- Connect automatically if `MullvadVpnService` is started with an intent which\n  has the `android.net.VpnService` action. Effectively, this should enable\n  _Always On_ behavior on Android versions where it's supported.\n- Allow notification to be dismissed when the UI is not shown and the tunnel is disconnected.\n\n#### Windows\n- Use a branded TAP driver for OpenVPN to prevent conflicts with other software and solve issues\n  related to driver upgrades. Also use the NDIS 6 driver on Windows 7.\n- Be more aggressive when installing routes, in effect taking ownership of existing duplicate route\n  entries. This allows the daemon to initialize properly even if a previous instance did not have a\n  clean shutdown.\n\n### Fixed\n- Don't try to replace WireGuard key if account has too many keys already.\n- Fix bogus update notification caused by an outdated cache.\n- Fix layout issues when showing messages in WireGuard key view.\n- Fix translation of \"System default\" after selecting \"System default\" in language settings.\n\n#### Windows\n- Fix regression due to which a TAP adapter issue was not given as the specific block reason when\n  the tunnel could not be started.\n- Fix occasional failure to shut down the old daemon process during installation by killing it if\n  necessary.\n- Make WireGuard work with IPv6 enabled even if there is no functioning TAP adapter for OpenVPN.\n- Restart daemon when coming back from system hibernation with terminated user session, since\n  it's perceived as a cold boot from the user's perspective, so the app should act accordingly.\n- Change the optimization level for releases from the default value to `s`, as a temporary fix for\n  the system service crashing on Windows for newer CPU models.\n\n#### Android\n- Fix notification message to not show `null` version when version check cache is stale right\n  after an update.\n- Fix `null` pointer exception when connectivity event intent has no network info.\n- Fix fast loop trying to fetch location and preventing the device from sleeping. This should\n  improve battery life in some cases.\n- Fix crash when starting the app right after quitting it.\n- Restart background service if it stops responding.\n- Fix crash when VPN permission is revoked, either manually or by starting another VPN app.\n- Fix crash caused by local JNI reference table overflow after running for a long time.\n- Dismiss notification after service has stopped.\n- Don't show missing connectivity error message in WireGuard key management screen if a\n  reconnection is expected to happen.\n- Fix showing new key as invalid immediately after regeneration.\n\n#### Linux\n- DNS management with static `/etc/resolv.conf` will now work even when no\n  `/etc/resolv.conf` exists.\n\n### Security\n- Add automatic key rotation for WireGuard (every 7 days by default). This limits the potential\n  for an attacker to correlate traffic with a public key and identity, and reduces the harm of\n  software that might leak the private tunnel IP (since it is no longer fixed).\n\n#### Windows\n- Stop OpenVPN from loading `C:\\etc\\ssl\\openssl.cnf` on start. This file was being loaded when an\n  OpenVPN tunnel was being created. Any user could create the file, and the process loading it runs\n  as the SYSTEM user. Since the config file allows loading arbitrary code, it was an attack vector\n  allowing local unprivileged users to run code as SYSTEM.\n\n#### macOS\n- Limit macOS firewall rules to only allow UDP packets in the rules meant to enable being a DHCPv4\n  *server* when local network sharing is enabled.\n\n\n## [2019.10] - 2019-12-12\n### Fixed\n- Fix improved WireGuard port selection.\n\n#### Windows\n- Register 'NSI' service as a dependency of the daemon service.\n- Set daemon service SID type as 'unrestricted'.\n- Properly tear down routes after disconnecting from WireGuard relays.\n- Fix bug that prohibited WireGuard from working over port 53.\n\n### Security\n#### Linux\n- Stop [CVE-2019-14899](https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2019/q4/122) by dropping all packets destined\n  for the tunnel IP coming in on some other interface than the tunnel.\n\n\n## [2019.10-beta2] - 2019-12-05\n### Added\n- Add `mullvad relay set tunnel-protocol` subcommand to the CLI to specify what tunnel protocol\n  to use.\n- Add `mullvad reconnect` subcommand to the CLI to make the app pick a new server and reconnect.\n\n#### Windows\n- Full WireGuard support, GUI and CLI.\n- Install Wintun driver that provides the WireGuard TUN adapter.\n- Remove Mullvad TAP adapter on uninstall. Also remove the TAP driver if there are no other TAP\n  adapters in the system.\n\n#### Android\n- Add connectivity status check. Stopping the app from sitting in a reconnect loop while the\n  device is offline.\n\n### Changed\n- Notifications shown when connecting to a server include its location.\n- Upgrade OpenVPN from 2.4.7 to 2.4.8.\n- Upgrade OpenSSL from 1.1.1c to 1.1.1d.\n- When using WireGuard without specifying a specific relay port, port 53 will be used after 2\n  failed connection attempts for 2 out of 4 each successive connection attempts\n\n#### Windows\n- Use a larger icon in notifications on Windows 10.\n- Only update DNS settings if updating would change the effective settings. This is a work-around\n  to avoid invoking `netsh` unnecessarily and getting stuck in associated hangs.\n- Don't restart the service immediately if it aborts several times in a row. Leave a window of ten\n  minutes to allow for addressing the issue.\n- Upgrade libsodium from 1.0.17 to 1.0.18.\n- Upgrade NDIS 6 TAP driver from 9.21.2 to 9.24.2.\n\n### Fixed\n#### Linux\n- Improve stability on Linux by using the routing netlink socket in its own thread.\n- When trying to use `resolvconf` for managing DNS, the daemon will check if\n  `dnsmasq` is running and misconfigured.\n- Improve stability on Linux by simplifying route management code.\n\n#### Windows\n- Detect removal of the OpenVPN TAP adapter on reconnection attempts.\n- Improve robustness in path environment variable logic in Windows installer. Handle the case\n  where the registry value type is incorrectly set to be a regular string rather than an expandable\n  string.\n- Fix suspend and resume issues with OpenVPN by upgrading the TAP driver.\n- Minor adjustment in online/offline detection logic. This change addresses misbehaving drivers\n  that report the adapter flags incorrectly.\n\n#### Android\n- Don't try to fetch location when the app knows that it has no connectivity. This should reduce\n  wake-ups (improving battery life) and also fix very large log files consuming storage space.\n- Fix crash when a new version event is received while the app is in the main screen.\n\n### Security\n- Force OpenVPN to use TLS 1.2 or newer, and limit the TLS 1.3 ciphers to only the strongest ones.\n  The Mullvad servers have never allowed any insecure ciphers, so this was not really a problem.\n  Just one extra safety precaution.\n\n\n## [2019.10-beta1] - 2019-11-06\nThis release is for Android only.\n\n### Added\n#### Android\n- Use authenticated URLs to go to wireguard key page on website.\n- WireGuard key fragment has been made more similar to its desktop counterpart.\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix bad file descriptor errors caused by sending a file descriptor between the daemon and the\n  `wireguard-go` library.\n- Recreate tun device after a fixed number of connection attempts on the same tun device. Breaks\n  infinite reconnection loops on broken tun devices.\n\n\n## [2019.9] - 2019-10-11\n### Added\n- Add ability to submit vouchers from the CLI.\n\n#### Linux\n- Add a symlink for `mullvad-problem-report` directly in `/usr/bin`. So the tool is available.\n\n#### Windows\n- Install the OpenVPN certificate to avoid the TAP adapter driver installation warning on\n  Windows 8 and newer.\n\n### Changed\n#### Windows\n- Rename the `problem-report` tool to `mullvad-problem-report`.\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix Norwegian (Bokmal) language detection.\n- Fix missing localizations when formatting date and time in Norwegian (Bokmal).\n- Use authenticated URL to go to account page from expired account view.\n\n#### macOS\n- Remove `mullvad` and `mullvad-problem-report` symlinks from `/usr/local/bin` on uninstall.\n\n\n## [2019.9-beta1] - 2019-10-08\n### Added\n- Add ability to change the desktop GUI language from within Settings.\n- Add ability to create new accounts from the CLI.\n\n#### Windows\n- Add CLI tools (the resource/ directory) to the system PATH.\n\n#### macOS\n- Notarize release builds with Apple. Making them run without warning on 10.15 Catalina.\n\n#### Android\n- Add settings button in launch and login screens. Making it possible to reach the problem report.\n- Add support for Android 5.x Lollipop.\n- Allow logging in without connectivity.\n\n### Changed\n- Account and WireGuard keys links in the App will now log the user in automatically.\n- Update FAQ URL to `https://mullvad.net/help/tag/mullvad-app/`.\n\n### Removed\n- Remove support for `MULLVAD_LOCALE` environment variable.\n\n#### Android\n- Remove connect action button in notification when logged out.\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix `mullvad relay update` to trigger a relay list download even if the existing cache is new.\n- Don't include problem-report arguments in error logging. Stops user email from ending up in the\n  log file on error.\n- Fix handling of tunnel file descriptor for WireGuard. Duplicating and closing it correctly.\n\n#### Android\n- Show WireGuard key age in local timezone instead of UTC.\n- Android 6 and older: Fix notification button icons.\n- Fix collapsing tunnel information causing tunnel out IP address information to be lost.\n- Various stability fixes.\n\n#### Windows\n- More adjustments in online/offline detection logic. Should prevent more users from being stuck\n  in the offline state. Should also make the app notice network disconnects faster.\n\n\n## [2019.8] - 2019-09-23\nThis release is identical to 2019.8-beta1\n\n\n## [2019.8-beta1] - 2019-09-19\n### Added\n- Add ability to replace the WireGuard key with a new one. Allows manual key rotation.\n- Show age of currently set WireGuard key.\n- Add bridge selection under \"Select location\" view, when the bridge mode is set to \"On\".\n\n#### Android\n- Initial support for the Android platform.\n\n### Changed\n- Decreased default MTU for WireGuard to 1380 to improve performance over 4G\n- WireGuard key page now shows a label explaining why buttons are disabled when in a blocked state\n- WireGuard key generation will try to replace old key if one exists.\n- Show banner about new app versions only if current platform has changes in latest release.\n- Don't make a GeoIP lookup by default in CLI status command. Add --location flag for enabling it.\n- Sort relay locations and hostnames with natural sorting. Meaning `se10` will show up after `se2`.\n- Show inactive relays as disabled instead of hiding them completely from location selection list.\n- Upgrade Electron from version 4 to version 6.\n\n#### Windows\n- Change uninstaller registry key name from `Mullvad VPN` to a generated GUID.\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix old settings deserialization to allow migrating settings from versions older than 2019.6.\n- Fix various small issues in GUI<->daemon communication.\n- Make GUI WireGuard key verification resilient to failure.\n- Fix issue where daemon would try and connect with UDP when the tunnel protocol is set to OpenVPN\n  and the bridge mode is set to \"On\".\n- Don't start ping monitor loop if first ping fails when checking WireGuard connection.\n- Respect localization when sorting the relay locations list.\n\n#### macOS\n- Unregister the app properly from the OS when running the bundled `uninstall.sh` script.\n\n#### Linux\n- Fix bug in netlink parsing in offline detection code.\n\n### Removed\n#### Windows\n- Removed logic that implemented monitoring and enforcement of DNS settings.\n\n\n## [2019.7] - 2019-08-12\n### Added\n- Add more details to the block reason shown in GUI when the daemon fails to generate tunnel\n  parameters.\n\n### Fixed\n- Check and adjust relay and bridge constraints when they are updated, so no incompatible\n  combinations are used.\n- Fix panic when running CLI \"mullvad relay set custom\" without any more arguments.\n\n\n## [2019.7-beta1] - 2019-08-08\n### Added\n- Add new settings page for generating and verifying wireguard keys.\n- Automatically generate and upload WireGuard keys on Linux and macOS.\n- Allow activating and using WireGuard from the GUI under advanced settings on Linux and macOS.\n- Add `factory-reset` CLI command for removing settings, logs and clearing the cache.\n\n### Changed\n- Upgrade OpenVPN from 2.4.6 to 2.4.7.\n- Upgrade OpenSSL from 1.1.0h to 1.1.1c.\n- Upgrade wireguard-go library to v0.0.20190805.\n- Settings format updated to `v2`.\n\n### Fixed\n- Mark CLI `bridge set state` argument as required to avoid a crash.\n- The VPN service on Windows will now be restarted when it crashes.\n- Retry to connect when WireGuard tunnel fails due to a bad file descriptor.\n\n#### Linux\n- Improve resolv.conf based DNS management to detect changes to file.\n\n\n## [2019.6] - 2019-07-15\n### Added\n- Add simplified Chinese translations.\n\n\n## [2019.6-beta1] - 2019-07-08\n### Added\n- Add a switch to turn off system notifications under Preferences in the GUI.\n\n#### Windows\n- Add migration logic to restore lost settings after major Windows update.\n\n#### macOS\n- Add the Mullvad CLI frontend and problem report CLI tool to the PATH, so it can be\n  run directly from a terminal.\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix the mix of traditional and simplified Chinese. Separating them to two locales and fall back\n  to English where translations are missing.\n\n#### Windows\n- Adjust network interface checks in offline detection logic. Prevents the app from being stuck\n  in the offline state when the computer is in fact online.\n\n#### Linux\n- Fix some netlink packet parsing error in DNS handling.\n- Improve offline check so if it fails, it always fails as online.\n\n\n## [2019.5] - 2019-06-17\n### Added\n- Add Norwegian translations.\n\n\n## [2019.5-beta1] - 2019-06-13\n### Added\n- Add support for roaming between connections when using wireguard.\n- Allow mDNS/discover to 239.255.255.251 when local network sharing is enabled.

Only send connect once (if auto-connect is enabled.)\n- Prevent possible reconnect loop where the GUI would indefinitely reconnect to the daemon.\n- Fix the bug which enabled users to return to the login view if they went to settings while\n  logging in.\n- Handle in the GUI, if something external changes the account token in the daemon. I.e. triggered\n  by CLI unsetting or resetting it.\n\n#### Linux\n- Fix Debian package not upgrading properly due to a bug in the post-remove script.\n- Wait for NetworkManager and systemd-resolved services to start before daemon starts on platforms\n  with systemd and those two services. Prevents the daemon from using the wrong DNS API.\n\n#### Windows\n- Gracefully block when TAP adapter is missing or disabled, instead of retrying to connect.\n\n### Security\n#### Linux\n- Poll netfilter to verify firewall rules were added correctly. On Ubuntu 14.04 netfilter did not\n  return any error, but it also ignored the rules the daemon tried to add.\n\n\n## [2018.6] - 2018-12-12\nThis release is identical to 2018.6-beta1\n\n\n## [2018.6-beta1] - 2018-12-05\n### Added\n- CLI command `relay update` that triggers an update of the relay list in the daemon.\n- Add extra level of kill-switch called \"block when disconnected\". Blocks all network traffic even\n  in the disconnected state. Not activated by default and can be changed via the CLI subcommand\n  `block-when-disconnected`.\n\n#### macOS\n- Detect if the computer is offline. If so, don't sit in a reconnect loop, instead block and show\n  an error message.\n- Add ability to debug firewall rules with the `TALPID_FIREWALL_DEBUG` variable.\n\n#### Windows\n- Install tray icon in visible part of the notification area.\n\n### Changed\n- Split DNS management from Firewall management to allow restoring DNS earlier and showing more\n  detailed errors to users.\n\n### Fixed\n- Cancel pending system notifications when the app becomes visible.\n- Transition to connected state after all routes are configured. Avoids problems with reaching the\n  internet directly after the app says it's connected.\n- Disable keep alive on API RPC requests. Should stop reuse of invalid sockets after tunnel state\n  changes.\n\n#### macOS\n- Fix permissions on log dir so problem-report tool has permission to read daemon logs.\n\n#### Windows\n- Use proper app id in the registry. This avoids false-positives with certain anti-virus software.\n- Handle sleep/resume events to quickly restore the tunnel when the machine wakes up.\n- Add default route to fix NLA issues (Microsoft Store/Office/etc say the machine is offline).\n- Update installer to not rely on WMI when enumerating network adapters.\n- Increase timeout waiting for OpenVPN to shut down cleanly.\n- Sign the bundled openvpn.exe binary.

Or nothing if not connected anywhere.\n- Passing `--connect-timeout 30` to OpenVPN to decrease the time the daemon\n  will wait until it tries to reconnect again in the case of a broken TCP connection.\n- Increase timeout parameter to OpenVPN from 15 to 20 seconds. Should make active VPN tunnels drop\n  less frequent when on unstable networks.\n- Reduce the transparency of \"blocking internet\" banner to increase the text readability.\n- Make the quit button visible without needing to scroll down in the settings view.\n\n#### Linux\n- Move CLI binary to `/usr/bin/` as to have the CLI binary in the user's `PATH` by default.\n\n### Removed\n- Remove `--comp-lzo` argument to OpenVPN. Disables any possibility of establishing a VPN tunnel\n  with compression.\n\n### Fixed\n#### Windows\n- Use different method for identifying network interfaces during installation. Should solve some\n  installation errors.\n- Properly restore DNS settings on network interfaces. Fixes issue #352.\n\n\n## [2018.4-beta1] - 2018-10-01\n### Added\n- Allow packets to the fe80::/10 and fe02::/16 IPv6 networks when local network sharing is enabled.\n  Should allow IPv6 over the LAN, and mDNS host discovery which in turn should allow Apple AirDrop\n  and Handover among other IPv6 based LAN discovery services.\n\n#### Linux\n- Add support for DNS configuration using resolvconf.\n\n### Changed\n- Logging in no longer requires a connection with the Mullvad API server.\n- Replace repeated `Disconnecting` followed by `Connecting` notifications with a single\n  `Reconnecting` notification.\n\n### Fixed\n- Don't temporarily show the unsecured state in the GUI when the app is reconnecting or blocking.\n- Periodically update list of relays in the GUI.\n- Redact IPv6 address that start or end with double colons in problem reports.\n- Improve tray icon response time by disabling the double click handling.\n\n### Security\n- Prevent Electron from executing/navigating to files being drag-and-dropped onto the app GUI. This\n  fixes [MUL-01-001](./audits/2018-09-24-assured-cure53.md#miscellaneous-issues)\n\n\n## [2018.3] - 2018-09-17\n### Changed\n#### macOS\n- Move the CLI binary (`mullvad`) back into the `Resources/` directory. A bug caused the app to not\n  be signed if it was placed in the app root directory.\n\n### Security\n#### Windows\n- Lock the installation directory to `C:\\Program Files\\Mullvad VPN`. This prevents potential local\n  privilege escalation by ensuring all binaries executed by the `SYSTEM` user, as part of the\n  Mullvad system service, are stored where unprivileged users can't modify them. This fixes\n  [MUL-01-004](./audits/2018-09-24-assured-cure53.md#identified-vulnerabilities).\n\n\n## [2018.3-beta1] - 2018-09-13\n### Added\n- Add option to enable or disable IPv6 on the tunnel interface. It's disabled by default.\n- Log panics in the daemon to the log file.\n- Warn in the Settings screen if a new version is available.\n- Add a \"blocked\" state in the app that blocks the entire network and shows a message about what\n  went wrong. Then it waits for user action.\n- Add support for Ubuntu 14.04 and other distributions that use the Upstart init system.\n- Make scrollbar thumb draggable.\n- Ability to expand cities with multiple servers and configure the app to use a specific server.\n- Add firewall rules allowing traffic to the SSDP/WS-discover multicast IP, 239.255.255.250, if\n  local area network sharing is activated. This allows discovery of devices using these protocols.\n\n#### macOS\n- Add uninstall script that can uninstall and remove all the files installed by the app.\n\n#### Windows\n- Extend uninstaller to also remove logs, cache and optionally settings.\n- Add installation log (%PROGRAMDATA%\\Mullvad VPN\\install.log).\n\n### Changed\n- The \"Buy more credit\" button is changed to open a dedicated account login page instead of one\n  having a create account form first.\n- The CLI command to list relays is now shorter, `mullvad relay list` instead of\n  `mullvad relay list locations`.\n- Replace WebSockets with Unix domain sockets/Named pipes for IPC. The location\n  of the socket can be controlled with `MULLVAD_RPC_SOCKET_PATH`.\n- Update the relay list if it's out of date when the daemon starts.\n- Move the CLI binary (`mullvad`) on macOS and Linux up one level, so it's installed directly into\n  the app installation directory instead of the `resource` directory.\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix incorrect window position when using external display.\n- Don't auto-connect the daemon on start if no account token is set. This prevents the daemon from\n  blocking all internet if logging out from the app.\n\n#### Linux\n- The app window is now shown in its previous location, instead of at the center of the screen.\n- Remove daemon log, cache and configuration directories during full uninstallation of the app.\n- Restart the daemon automatically on upgrade.\n- Fix systemd unit file to support older versions of systemd (e.g., in Debian 8).\n\n#### macOS\n- Fix edge cases when window's arrow appeared misaligned and pointed to the wrong menubar item.\n- Make the pkg installer kill any running GUI process after installation is done. Prevents\n  accidentally running an old GUI with a newer daemon.\n\n#### Windows\n- Failing to restore DNS settings on daemon start does not make the daemon exit with an error, just\n  log the error and continue.\n\n\n## [2018.2] - 2018-08-13\nThis release is identical to 2018.2-beta3\n\n\n## [2018.2-beta3] - 2018-08-09\n### Added\n- Create a new UI log file for every UI execution session, and preserve the log from the previous\n  session.\n- Account token can be copied to the clipboard by clicking on it in the account settings screen.\n- Automatically scroll to selected country/city in locations view.\n- Show system notifications when connection state changes and the window is not visible.\n- Add launch view displayed when connecting to system service.\n\n### Changed\n- Format the expiry date and time using the system locale.\n- Account tokens are now required to have at least ten digits.\n\n#### macOS\n- Rename directories for settings, logs and cache from `mullvad-daemon` to `mullvad-vpn`.\n\n#### Windows\n- Use local user directory to store system service settings and GUI electron cache, instead of the\n  roaming user directory.\n- Where the system service would use `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Mullvad\\Mullvad VPN\\` it now just uses\n  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Mullvad VPN\\`\n\n### Fixed\n- Ignore empty strings as redaction requests in the problem report tool, to avoid adding redacted\n  markers between every character of the log message.\n- Previously logged in users won't be going through login view when restarting the app, instead\n  will be taken straight to main view.\n\n\n## [2018.2-beta2] - 2018-07-18\n### Added\n- Bundle the root CA signing the API and only trust that single one, limiting\n  trust to a single root CA\n- Add a unique UUID to problem reports.

Please send\nall other problems or questions (those not directly related to the app's development) to\n[support@mullvadvpn.net](mailto:support@mullvadvpn.net). This includes connection issues, questions\nregarding your account, and problems with the Mullvad VPN infrastructure or servers.\n\n\n## Submitting changes\n\nIf you would like to contribute to the development of the Mullvad VPN app, please carefully read the\nfollowing sections first and then feel free to submit a pull request on GitHub.\n\nWhile we appreciate your interest in helping us to improve Mullvad VPN, please understand that\nchoosing which submitted changes to merge is fully at our discretion, based upon our development\nplans for the app.\n\n### Localization / translations\n\nThe app is translated and proofread via a third party company. We can't take in user improvements\nto the translations directly, since we can't verify their correctness. All translations have to\ngo via the translation company. As a result, if you want to improve an existing\ntranslation, please don't edit the PO files and submit to us. Instead fill in your suggested\nimprovement in [this form], and the translation company will pick it up and process the\nsuggestion after a while.\n\n[this form]: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeEFRe0ojdl6QdHPp7Z9qIvdGTc1uSgbswQT6d-VRQ98GBO2w/viewform\n\n### Copyright and ownership of contributed code and changes\n\nAny code, binaries, tools, documentation, graphics, or any other material that you submit to this\nproject will be licensed under GPL 3.0.

And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\nFor the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the\nmanufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the\naim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The\nsystematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for\nindividuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.\nTherefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the\npractice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in\nother domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those\ndomains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the\nfreedom of users.\n\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish\nto avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program\ncould make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL\nassures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n### TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n#### 0. Definitions.\n\n\"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n\"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds\nof works, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n\"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\nTo \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of\nan exact copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of\nthe earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\nA \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\nTo \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\nTo \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user\nthrough a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not\nconveying.\n\nAn interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\" to\nthe extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n#### 1. Source Code.\n\nThe \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it. \"Object code\" means any non-source form of\na work.\n\nA \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\nThe \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form. A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\nThe \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities. However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can\nregenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same\nwork.\n\n#### 2. Basic Permissions.\n\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,\nwithout conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.\nYou may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having\nthem make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with\nfacilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the\nterms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not\ncontrol copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for\nyou must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and\ncontrol, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your\ncopyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the\nconditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes\nit unnecessary.\n\n#### 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such\ncircumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with\nrespect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit\noperation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against\nthe work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures.\n\n#### 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n#### 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these\nconditions:\n\n-   a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n-   b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under\n    section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4\n    to \"keep intact all notices\".\n-   c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n-   d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n#### 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of\nsections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable\nCorresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these\nways:\n\n-   a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n-   b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding\n    Source from a network server at no charge.\n-   c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n-   d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n-   e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,\n    provided you inform other peers where the object code and\n    Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general\n    public at no charge under subsection 6d.\n\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\nA \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal,\nfamily, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for\nincorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a\nconsumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of\ncoverage. For a particular product received by a particular user,\n\"normally used\" refers to a typical or common use of that class of\nproduct, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way\nin which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected\nto use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of\nwhether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or\nnon-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant\nmode of use of the product.\n\n\"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to\ninstall and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User\nProduct from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The\ninformation must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of\nthe modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with\nsolely because modification has been made.\n\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or\nupdates for a work that has been modified or installed by the\nrecipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or\ninstalled. Access to a network may be denied when the modification\nitself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network\nor violates the rules and protocols for communication across the\nnetwork.\n\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n#### 7. Additional Terms.\n\n\"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders\nof that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n-   a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n-   b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n-   c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,\n    or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n-   d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors\n    or authors of the material; or\n-   e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n-   f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions\n    of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient,\n    for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly\n    impose on those licensors and authors.\n\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the\nabove requirements apply either way.\n\n#### 8. Termination.\n\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license\nfrom a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,\nunless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally\nterminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder\nfails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to\n60 days after the cessation.\n\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n#### 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run\na copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n#### 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\nAn \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n#### 11. Patents.\n\nA \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\nA contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims owned\nor controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version. For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\nIn the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement). To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients. \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\nA patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within the\nscope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on\nthe non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically\ngranted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you\nare a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the\nbusiness of distributing software, under which you make payment to the\nthird party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the\nwork, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties\nwho would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent\nlicense (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by\nyou (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in\nconnection with specific products or compilations that contain the\ncovered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent\nlicense was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n#### 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under\nthis License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a\nconsequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to\nterms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying\nfrom those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could\nsatisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely\nfrom conveying the Program.\n\n#### 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n#### 14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions\nwill be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in\ndetail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program\nspecifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public\nLicense \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of\nfollowing the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or\nof any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the\nProgram does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public\nLicense, you may choose any version ever published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.\n\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions\nof the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public\nstatement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to\nchoose that version for the Program.\n\nLater license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n#### 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT\nWARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT\nLIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\nA PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND\nPERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE\nDEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR\nCORRECTION.\n\n#### 16. Limitation of Liability.\n\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR\nCONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES\nARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT\nNOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR\nLOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM\nTO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER\nPARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n#### 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n### How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these\nterms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to\nattach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state\nthe exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n        <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n        Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n        This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n        the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n        (at your option) any later version.\n\n        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n        but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n        GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n        along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper\nmail.\n\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n        <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n        This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n        This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n        under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands \\`show w' and \\`show c' should show the\nappropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your\nprogram's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would\nuse an \"about box\".\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow\nthe GNU GPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your\nprogram into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine\nlibrary, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary\napplications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the\nGNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first,\nplease read <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>."

          "content": "# Mullvad VPN desktop and mobile app\n\nWelcome to the Mullvad VPN client app source code repository.\nThis is the VPN client software for the Mullvad VPN service.\nFor more information about the service, please visit our website,\n[mullvad.net](https://mullvad.net) (Also accessible via Tor on our\n[onion service](http://o54hon2e2vj6c7m3aqqu6uyece65by3vgoxxhlqlsvkmacw6a7m7kiad.onion/)).\n\nThis repository contains all the source code for the\ndesktop and mobile versions of the app. For desktop this includes the system service/daemon\n([`mullvad-daemon`](mullvad-daemon/)), a graphical user interface ([GUI](desktop/)) and a command\nline interface ([CLI](mullvad-cli/)). The Android app uses the same backing system service for the\ntunnel and security but has a dedicated frontend in [android/](android/). iOS consists of a\ncompletely standalone implementation that resides in [ios/](ios/).\n\n## Releases\n\nThere are built and signed releases for macOS, Windows, Linux and Android available on\n[our website](https://mullvad.net/download/) and on\n[Github](https://github.com/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app/releases/). The Android app is also available\non [Google Play] and [F-Droid] and the iOS version on [App Store].\n\n[Google Play]: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.mullvad.mullvadvpn\n[F-Droid]: https://f-droid.org/packages/net.mullvad.mullvadvpn/\n[App Store]: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mullvad-vpn/id1488466513\n\nYou can find our code signing keys as well as instructions for how to cryptographically verify\nyour download on [Mullvad's Open Source page].\n\n### Platform/OS support\n\nThese are the operating systems and their versions that the app officially supports. It might\nwork on many more versions, but we don't test for those and can't guarantee the quality or\nsecurity.\n\n| OS/Platform | Supported versions |\n|-------------|--------------------|\n| Windows     | 10 and 11          |\n| macOS       | The three latest major releases |\n| Linux (Ubuntu)| The two latest LTS releases and the latest non-LTS releases |\n| Linux (Fedora) | The versions that are not yet [EOL](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/End_of_life) |\n| Linux (Debian) | 12 and newer    |\n| Android     | 8 and newer        |\n| iOS         | 15.0 and newer     |\n\nOn Linux we test using the Gnome desktop environment. The app should, and probably does work\nin other DEs, but we don't regularly test those.\n\n## Features\n\nHere is a table containing the features of the app across platforms. This is intended to reflect\nthe current state of the latest code in git, not necessarily any existing release.\n\n|                               | Windows | Linux | macOS | Android | iOS |\n|-------------------------------|:-------:|:-----:|:-----:|:-------:|:---:|\n| OpenVPN                       |    ✓    |   ✓   |   ✓   |         |     |\n| WireGuard                     |    ✓    |   ✓   |   ✓   |    ✓    |  ✓  |\n| Quantum-resistant tunnels     |    ✓    |   ✓   |   ✓   |    ✓    |  ✓  |\n| [DAITA]                       |    ✓    |   ✓   |   ✓   |    ✓    |  ✓  |\n| WireGuard multihop            |    ✓    |   ✓   |   ✓   |         |  ✓  |\n| WireGuard over TCP            |    ✓    |   ✓   |   ✓   |    ✓    |  ✓  |\n| WireGuard over Shadowsocks    |    ✓    |   ✓   |   ✓   |    ✓    |  ✓  |\n| OpenVPN over Shadowsocks      |    ✓    |   ✓   |   ✓   |         |     |\n| Split tunneling               |    ✓    |   ✓   |   ✓   |    ✓    |     |\n| Custom DNS server             |    ✓    |   ✓   |   ✓   |    ✓    |  ✓  |\n| Content blockers (Ads etc)    |    ✓    |   ✓   |   ✓   |    ✓    |  ✓  |\n| Optional local network access |    ✓    |   ✓   |   ✓   |    ✓    |  ✓\\* |\n| [Externally audited](./audits)|    ✓    |   ✓   |   ✓   |    ✓    |  ✓ |\n\n\\* The local network is always accessible on iOS with the current implementation\n\n[DAITA]: https://mullvad.net/en/blog/introducing-defense-against-ai-guided-traffic-analysis-daita\n\n## Security and anonymity\n\nThis app is a privacy preserving VPN client. As such it goes to great lengths to stop traffic\nleaks. And basically all settings default to the more secure/private option. The user has to\nexplicitly allow more loose rules if desired. See the [dedicated security document] for details\non what the app blocks and allows, as well as how it does it.\n\n[dedicated security document]: docs/security.md\n\n## Checking out the code\n\nThis repository contains submodules needed for building the app. However, some of those submodules\nalso have further submodules that are quite large and not needed to build the app. So unless\nyou want the source code for OpenSSL, OpenVPN and a few other projects you should avoid a recursive\nclone of the repository. Instead clone the repository normally and then get one level of submodules:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app.git\ncd mullvadvpn-app\ngit submodule update --init\n```\n\nOn Android, Linux and macOS you also want to checkout the wireguard-go submodule recursively:\n```bash\ngit submodule update --init --recursive --depth=1 wireguard-go-rs\n```\nFurther details on why this is necessary can be found in the [wireguard-go-rs crate](./wireguard-go-rs/README.md).\n\nWe sign every commit on the `main` branch as well as our release tags. If you would like to verify\nyour checkout, you can find our developer keys on [Mullvad's Open Source page].\n\n### Binaries submodule\n\nThis repository has a git submodule at `dist-assets/binaries`. This submodule contains binaries and\nbuild scripts for third party code we need to bundle with the app. Such as OpenVPN, Wintun\netc.\n\nThis submodule conforms to the same integrity/security standards as this repository. Every merge\ncommit should be signed. And this main repository should only ever point to a signed merge commit\nof the binaries submodule.\n\nSee the [binaries submodule's](https://github.com/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app-binaries) README for more\ndetails about that repository.\n\n## Building the app\n\nSee the [build instructions](BuildInstructions.md) for help building the app on desktop platforms.\n\nFor building the Android app, see the [instructions](./android/BuildInstructions.md) for Android.\n\nFor building the iOS app, see the [instructions](./ios/BuildInstructions.md) for iOS.\n\n## Releasing the app\n\nSee [this](Release.md) for instructions on how to make a new release.\n\n## Environment variables used by the service\n\n* `TALPID_FIREWALL_DEBUG` - Helps debugging the firewall. Does different things depending on\n  platform:\n  * Linux: Set to `\"1\"` to add packet counters to all firewall rules.\n  * macOS: Makes rules log the packets they match to the `pflog0` interface.\n    * Set to `\"all\"` to add logging to all rules.\n    * Set to `\"pass\"` to add logging to rules allowing packets.\n    * Set to `\"drop\"` to add logging to rules blocking packets.\n\n* `TALPID_FIREWALL_DONT_SET_SRC_VALID_MARK` - Set this variable to `1` to stop the daemon from\n    setting the `net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark` kernel parameter to `1` on Linux when a tunnel\n    is established.\n    The kernel config parameter is set by default, because otherwise strict reverse path filtering\n    may prevent relay traffic from reaching the daemon. If `rp_filter` is set to `1` on the interface\n    that will be receiving relay traffic, and `src_valid_mark` is not set to `1`, the daemon will\n    not be able to receive relay traffic.\n\n* `TALPID_FIREWALL_DONT_SET_ARP_IGNORE` - Set this variable to `1` to stop the daemon from\n    setting the `net.ipv4.conf.all.arp_ignore` kernel parameter to `2` on Linux when a tunnel\n    is established.\n    The kernel config parameter is set by default, because otherwise an attacker who can send ARP\n    requests to the device running Mullvad can figure out the in-tunnel IP.\n\n* `TALPID_DNS_MODULE` - Allows changing the method that will be used for DNS configuration.\n  By default this is automatically detected, but you can set it to one of the options below to\n  choose a specific method.\n\n  * Linux\n    * `\"static-file\"`: change the `/etc/resolv.conf` file directly\n    * `\"resolvconf\"`: use the `resolvconf` program\n    * `\"systemd\"`: use systemd's `resolved` service through DBus\n    * `\"network-manager\"`: use `NetworkManager` service through DBus\n\n  * Windows\n    * `iphlpapi`: use the IP helper API\n    * `netsh`: use the `netsh` program\n    * `tcpip`: set TCP/IP parameters in the registry\n\n* `TALPID_FORCE_USERSPACE_WIREGUARD` - Forces the daemon to use the userspace implementation of\n   WireGuard on Linux.\n\n* `TALPID_DISABLE_OFFLINE_MONITOR` - Forces the daemon to always assume the host is online.\n\n* `TALPID_NET_CLS_MOUNT_DIR` - On Linux, forces the daemon to mount the `net_cls` controller in the\n  specified directory if it isn't mounted already.\n\n* `MULLVAD_MANAGEMENT_SOCKET_GROUP` - On Linux and macOS, this restricts access to the management\n  interface UDS socket to users in the specified group. This means that only users in that group can\n  use the CLI and GUI. By default, everyone has access to the socket.\n\n* `MULLVAD_BACKTRACE_ON_FAULT` - When enabled, if the daemon encounters a fault (e.g. `SIGSEGV`),\n  it will log a backtrace to stdout, and to `daemon.log`. By default, this is disabled in\n  release-builds and enabled in debug-builds. Set variable to `1` or `0` to explicitly enable or\n  disable this feature. Logging the backtrace cause heap allocation. Allocation is not signal safe,\n  but here it runs in the signal handler. This in technically undefined behavior and therefore\n  disabled by default. This usually works, but enable at your own risk.\n\n### Development builds only\n\n* `MULLVAD_API_HOST` - Set the hostname to use in API requests. E.g. `api.mullvad.net`.\n\n* `MULLVAD_API_ADDR` - Set the IP address and port to use in API requests. E.g. `10.10.1.2:443`.\n\n* `MULLVAD_API_DISABLE_TLS` - Use plain HTTP for API requests.\n\n* `MULLVAD_CONNCHECK_HOST` - Set the hostname to use in connection check requests. E.g. `am.i.mullvad.net`.\n\n### Setting environment variables\n\n#### Windows\n\nUse `setx` from an elevated shell:\n\n```bat\nsetx TALPID_DISABLE_OFFLINE 1 /m\n```\n\nFor the change to take effect, restart the daemon:\n\n```bat\nsc.exe stop mullvadvpn\nsc.exe start mullvadvpn\n```\n\n#### Linux\n\nEdit the systemd unit file via `systemctl edit mullvad-daemon.service`:\n\n```ini\n[Service]\nEnvironment=\"TALPID_DISABLE_OFFLINE_MONITOR=1\"\n```\n\nFor the change to take effect, restart the daemon:\n\n```bash\nsudo systemctl restart mullvad-daemon\n```\n\n#### macOS\n\nUse `plutil`:\n\n```bash\nsudo plutil -replace EnvironmentVariables -json '{\"TALPID_DISABLE_OFFLINE_MONITOR\": \"1\"}' /Library/LaunchDaemons/net.mullvad.daemon.plist\n```\n\nFor the change to take effect, restart the daemon:\n\n```bash\nlaunchctl unload -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/net.mullvad.daemon.plist\nlaunchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/net.mullvad.daemon.plist\n```\n\n## Environment variables used by the desktop frontend\n\n* `MULLVAD_PATH` - Allows changing the path to the folder with the `mullvad-problem-report` tool\n   when running in development mode. Defaults to: `<repo>/target/debug/`.\n* `MULLVAD_DISABLE_UPDATE_NOTIFICATION` - If set to `1`, notification will be disabled when\n   an update is available.\n\n\n## Command line tools for Electron app development\n\n- `$ npm run develop` - develop app with live-reload enabled\n- `$ npm run lint` - lint code\n- `$ npm run pack:<OS>` - prepare app for distribution for your platform. Where `<OS>` can be\n  `linux`, `mac` or `win`\n- `$ npm test` - run tests\n\n\n## Tray icon on Linux\n\nThe requirements for displaying a tray icon varies between different desktop environments. If the\ntray icon doesn't appear, try installing one of these packages:\n- `libappindicator3-1`\n- `libappindicator1`\n- `libappindicator`\n\nIf you're using GNOME, try installing one of these GNOME Shell extensions:\n- `TopIconsFix`\n- `TopIcons Plus`\n\n\n## Repository structure\n\n### Electron app and electron-builder packaging assets\n- **desktop/packages/mullvad-vpn/**\n  - **assets/** - Graphical assets and stylesheets\n  - **src/**\n    - **main/**\n      - **index.ts** - Entry file for the main process\n    - **renderer/**\n      - **app.tsx** - Entry file for the renderer process\n      - **routes.tsx** - Routes configurator\n      - **transitions.ts** - Transition rules between views\n    - **config.json** - App color definitions and URLs to external resources\n  - **tasks/** - Gulp tasks used to build app and watch for changes during development\n    - **distribution.js** - Configuration for `electron-builder`\n  - **test/** - Electron GUI tests\n- **dist-assets/** - Icons, binaries and other files used when creating the distributables\n  - **binaries/** - Git submodule containing binaries bundled with the app. For example the\n    statically linked OpenVPN binary. See the README in the submodule for details\n  - **linux/** - Scripts and configuration files for the deb and rpm artifacts\n  - **pkg-scripts/** - Scripts bundled with and executed by the macOS pkg installer\n  - **windows/** - Windows NSIS installer configuration and assets\n  - **ca.crt** - The Mullvad relay server root CA. Bundled with the app and only OpenVPN relays\n    signed by this CA are trusted\n\n\n### Building, testing and misc\n- **build-windows-modules.sh** - Compiles the C++ libraries needed on Windows\n- **build.sh** - Sanity checks the working directory state and then builds installers for the app\n\n### Mullvad Daemon\n\nThe daemon is implemented in Rust and is implemented in several crates. The main, or top level,\ncrate that builds the final daemon binary is `mullvad-daemon` which then depend on the others.\n\nIn general one can look at the daemon as split into two parts, the crates starting with `talpid`\nand the crates starting with `mullvad`. The `talpid` crates are supposed to be completely unrelated\nto Mullvad specific things. A `talpid` crate is not allowed to know anything about the API through\nwhich the daemon fetch Mullvad account details or download VPN server lists for example. The\n`talpid` components should be viewed as a generic VPN client with extra privacy and anonymity\npreserving features. The crates having `mullvad` in their name on the other hand make use of the\n`talpid` components to build a secure and Mullvad specific VPN client.\n\n\n- **Cargo.toml** - Main Rust workspace definition. See this file for which folders here are daemon\n  Rust crates.\n- **mullvad-daemon/** - Main Rust crate building the daemon binary.\n- **talpid-core/** - Main crate of the VPN client implementation itself. Completely Mullvad agnostic\n  privacy preserving VPN client library.\n\n\n## Vocabulary\n\nExplanations for some common words used in the documentation and code in this repository.\n\n- **App** - This entire product (everything in this repository) is the \"Mullvad VPN App\", or App for\n  short.\n  - **Daemon** - Refers to the `mullvad-daemon` Rust program. This headless program exposes a\n    management interface that can be used to control the daemon\n  - **Frontend** - Term used for any program or component that connects to the daemon management\n    interface and allows a user to control the daemon.\n    - **GUI** - The Electron + React program that is a graphical frontend for the Mullvad VPN App.\n    - **CLI** - The Rust program named `mullvad` that is a terminal based frontend for the Mullvad\n      VPN app.\n\n\n## File paths used by Mullvad VPN app\n\nA list of file paths written to and read from by the various components of the Mullvad VPN app\n\n### Daemon\n\nOn Windows, when a process runs as a system service the variable `%LOCALAPPDATA%` expands to\n`C:\\Windows\\system32\\config\\systemprofile\\AppData\\Local`.\n\nAll directory paths are defined in, and fetched from, the `mullvad-paths` crate.\n\n#### Settings\n\nThe settings directory can be changed by setting the `MULLVAD_SETTINGS_DIR` environment variable.\n\n| Platform | Path |\n|----------|------|\n| Linux | `/etc/mullvad-vpn/` |\n| macOS | `/etc/mullvad-vpn/` |\n| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Mullvad VPN\\` |\n| Android | [`getFilesDir()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context#getFilesDir()) |\n\n#### Logs\n\nThe log directory can be changed by setting the `MULLVAD_LOG_DIR` environment variable.\n\n| Platform | Path |\n|----------|------|\n| Linux | `/var/log/mullvad-vpn/` + systemd |\n| macOS | `/var/log/mullvad-vpn/` |\n| Windows | `C:\\ProgramData\\Mullvad VPN\\` |\n| Android | [`getFilesDir()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context#getFilesDir()) |\n\n#### Cache\n\nThe cache directory can be changed by setting the `MULLVAD_CACHE_DIR` environment variable.\n\n| Platform | Path |\n|----------|------|\n| Linux | `/var/cache/mullvad-vpn/` |\n| macOS | `/Library/Caches/mullvad-vpn/` |\n| Windows | `C:\\ProgramData\\Mullvad VPN\\cache` |\n| Android | [`getCacheDir()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context#getCacheDir())  |\n\n#### RPC address file\n\nThe full path to the RPC address file can be changed by setting the `MULLVAD_RPC_SOCKET_PATH`\nenvironment variable.\n\n| Platform | Path |\n|----------|------|\n| Linux | `/var/run/mullvad-vpn` |\n| macOS | `/var/run/mullvad-vpn` |\n| Windows | `//./pipe/Mullvad VPN` |\n| Android | [`getNoBackupFilesDir()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ContextWrapper#getNoBackupFilesDir()) |\n\n### Desktop Electron app\n\nThe desktop Electron app has a specific settings file that is configured for each user.

          "content": "# Making a release\n\nWhen making a real release there are a couple of steps to follow. `<VERSION>` here will denote\nthe version of the app you are going to release. For example `2018.3-beta1` or `2018.4`.\n\n1. Follow the [Install toolchains and dependencies](BuildInstructions.md#install-toolchains-and-dependencies) steps\n   if you have not already completed them.\n\n1. Make sure the `CHANGELOG.md` is up to date and has all the changes present in this release.\n   Also change the `[Unreleased]` header into `[<VERSION>] - <DATE>` and add a new `[Unreleased]`\n   header at the top. Push this, get it reviewed and merged.\n\n1. Run `./prepare-release.sh [--desktop] [--android] <VERSION>`. This will do the following for you:\n    1. Check if your repository is in a sane state and the given version has the correct format\n    1. Update `package.json` with the new version and commit that\n    1. Add a signed tag to the current commit with the release version in it\n\n    Please verify that the script did the right thing before you push the commit and tag it created.\n\n1. When building for Windows or macOS, the following environment variables must be set:\n   * `CSC_LINK` - The path to the certificate used for code signing.\n      * Windows: A `.pfx` certificate.\n      * macOS: A `.p12` certificate file with the Apple application signing keys.\n        This file must contain both the \"Developer ID Application\" and the \"Developer ID Installer\"\n        certificates + private keys.\n   * `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` - The password to the file given in `CSC_LINK`. If this is not set then\n      `build.sh` will prompt you for it. If you set it yourself, make sure to define it in such a\n      way that it's not stored in your bash history:\n      ```bash\n      export HISTCONTROL=ignorespace\n      export CSC_KEY_PASSWORD='my secret'\n      ```\n\n   * *macOS only*:\n      * `NOTARIZE_KEYCHAIN` - The keychain in which the profile is stored\n      * `NOTARIZE_KEYCHAIN_PROFILE` - The name of the notarytool profile containing the credentials.\n         The credentials include Apple-ID, app specific password and team ID. Don't use the real\n         AppleId password! Instead create an app specific password and add that to your keyring. See\n         this documentation:\n         https://github.com/electron/electron-notarize#safety-when-using-appleidpassword\n\n         Create the notarytool profile:\n         1. Generate app specific password on Apple's AppleId management portal\n         2. Run `xcrun notarytool store-credentials <profile name> --keychain <keychain path>`.\n            Leave the first prompt empty and than fill in the rest with the credentials mentioned\n            above\n         3. Set `NOTARIZE_KEYCHAIN` and `NOTARIZE_KEYCHAIN_PROFILE` to the values specified in 2\n\n1. Run `./build.sh` on each computer/platform where you want to create a release artifact. This will\n    do the following for you:\n    1. Update `relays.json` with the latest relays\n    1. Compile and package the app into a distributable artifact for your platform.\n\n    Please pay attention to the output at the end of the script and make sure the version it says\n    it built matches what you want to release.\n"

Try to upgrade the dependency to a version that does not have the vulnerability.\n#    If possible and does not come with too many other downsides, this is always recommended.\n# 2. If upgrading is not feasible and the vulnerability does not affect the security of our app,\n#    it can be ignored with an `IgnoredVulns` entry. See below for rules.\n# 3. If one package has very many vulnerabilities or a constant stream of new vulnerabilities\n#    found, and they are never a threat to our app's security, the entire package can be ignored\n#    with a `PackageOverrides` entry. See below for rules. This should be avoided if feasible.\n#\n# Every ignored vulnerability/package entry must have an end date. It is not allowed to ignore\n# vulnerabilies indefinitely. This means specifying an `ignoreUntil` for `IgnoredVulns` entries\n# and `effectiveUntil` for `PackageOverrides` entries.\n# * The default should be to ignore a vulnerability for three months.\n# * A vulnerability can be ignored for up to a year at most (Use extremely sparsely).\n# * If anything above three months is used, write a short comment about why this ignore is longer.\n#\n# Every entry must have a `reason` field that explains why this vulnerability does not affect us,\n# and why we can't/decided not to change to an unaffected version.\n#\n# Try to use the \"original\" identifier as `id` in `IgnoredVulns`. This means the identifier used\n# by the original vulnerability database it originates from.\n# These are usually listed as \"Aliases\" on osv.dev.\n# Feel free to add more identifiers as comments after the `id`.\n#\n# Write a comment above each entry specifying what dependency it is about and what type of\n# vulnerability it is. The other fields do not convey this.\n#\n# Remove the ignore as soon as we upgrade or otherwise get rid of the vulnerable dependency from\n# our product.\n#\n# When an `ignoreUntil`/`effectiveUntil` expire and start yielding errors on a previously ignored\n# issue, follow these steps:\n# 1. Try to upgrade away from the vulnerable versions and get rid of the ignore.\n# 2. Update any outdated info in this ignore.\n# 3. Bump the `ignoreUntil` following the same rules as when initially adding an ignore entry.\n#\n# Example `IgnoredVulns` entry:\n#\n# ```\n# # libbaz remote code execution in get_date() function\n# [[IgnoredVulns]]\n# id = \"CVE-2020-12345\" # GHSA-abcd-efgh-1234\n# ignoreUntil = 2024-12-05 # Ignored for six months at a time. Unlikely to be fixed, but also unlikely to be an issue for us.\n# reason = \"\"\"\n# The vulnerable code path is currently not triggered by us or our dependencies.\n# `renderer-helper` currently depend on this version of libbaz, preventing us from upgrading to a fixed version.\n# \"\"\"\n# ```\n#\n# Example `PackageOverrides` entry:\n#\n# ```\n# # Entire package ignored since there is a constant stream of newly found regular expression attacks.\n# # All of these attacks rely on the input being malicious. We only use this package in our trusted\n# # build environment with trusted inputs.\n# [[PackageOverrides]]\n# name = \"rexml\"\n# ignore = true\n# effectiveUntil = 2024-11-02\n# reason = \"The XML payload is generated by Apple tooling which we trust\"\n# ```\n"
