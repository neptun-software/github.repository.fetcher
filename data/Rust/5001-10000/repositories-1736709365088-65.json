The following related subprojects target end users:\n\n- [DataFusion Python](https://github.com/apache/datafusion-python/) offers a Python interface for SQL and DataFrame\n  queries.\n- [DataFusion Ray](https://github.com/apache/datafusion-ray/) provides a distributed version of DataFusion that scales\n  out on Ray clusters.\n- [DataFusion Comet](https://github.com/apache/datafusion-comet/) is an accelerator for Apache Spark based on\n  DataFusion.\n\n\"Out of the box,\"\nDataFusion offers [SQL] and [`Dataframe`] APIs, excellent [performance],\nbuilt-in support for CSV, Parquet, JSON, and Avro, extensive customization, and\na great community.\n\nDataFusion features a full query planner, a columnar, streaming, multi-threaded,\nvectorized execution engine, and partitioned data sources. You can\ncustomize DataFusion at almost all points including additional data sources,\nquery languages, functions, custom operators and more.\nSee the [Architecture] section for more details.\n\n[rust]: http://rustlang.org\n[apache arrow]: https://arrow.apache.org\n[use cases]: https://datafusion.apache.org/user-guide/introduction.html#use-cases\n[python bindings]: https://github.com/apache/datafusion-python\n[performance]: https://benchmark.clickhouse.com/\n[architecture]: https://datafusion.apache.org/contributor-guide/architecture.html\n\nHere are links to some important information\n\n- [Project Site](https://datafusion.apache.org/)\n- [Installation](https://datafusion.apache.org/user-guide/cli/installation.html)\n- [Rust Getting Started](https://datafusion.apache.org/user-guide/example-usage.html)\n- [Rust DataFrame API](https://datafusion.apache.org/user-guide/dataframe.html)\n- [Rust API docs](https://docs.rs/datafusion/latest/datafusion)\n- [Rust Examples](https://github.com/apache/datafusion/tree/main/datafusion-examples)\n- [Python DataFrame API](https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion-python/)\n- [Architecture](https://docs.rs/datafusion/latest/datafusion/index.html#architecture)\n\n## What can you do with this crate?\n\nDataFusion is great for building projects such as domain specific query engines, new database platforms and data pipelines, query languages and more.\nIt lets you start quickly from a fully working engine, and then customize those features specific to your use. [Click Here](https://datafusion.apache.org/user-guide/introduction.html#known-users) to see a list known users.\n\n## Contributing to DataFusion\n\nPlease see the [contributor guide] and [communication] pages for more information.\n\n[contributor guide]: https://datafusion.apache.org/contributor-guide\n[communication]: https://datafusion.apache.org/contributor-guide/communication.html\n\n## Crate features\n\nThis crate has several [features] which can be specified in your `Cargo.toml`.\n\n[features]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html\n\nDefault features:\n\n- `nested_expressions`: functions for working with nested type function such as `array_to_string`\n- `compression`: reading files compressed with `xz2`, `bzip2`, `flate2`, and `zstd`\n- `crypto_expressions`: cryptographic functions such as `md5` and `sha256`\n- `datetime_expressions`: date and time functions such as `to_timestamp`\n- `encoding_expressions`: `encode` and `decode` functions\n- `parquet`: support for reading the [Apache Parquet] format\n- `regex_expressions`: regular expression functions, such as `regexp_match`\n- `unicode_expressions`: Include unicode aware functions such as `character_length`\n- `unparser`: enables support to reverse LogicalPlans back into SQL\n- `recursive_protection`: uses [recursive](https://docs.rs/recursive/latest/recursive/) for stack overflow protection.\n\nOptional features:\n\n- `avro`: support for reading the [Apache Avro] format\n- `backtrace`: include backtrace information in error messages\n- `pyarrow`: conversions between PyArrow and DataFusion types\n- `serde`: enable arrow-schema's `serde` feature\n\n[apache avro]: https://avro.apache.org/\n[apache parquet]: https://parquet.apache.org/\n\n## Rust Version Compatibility Policy\n\nThe Rust toolchain releases are tracked at [Rust Versions](https://releases.rs) and follow\n[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). A Rust toolchain release can be identified\nby a version string like `1.80.0`, or more generally `major.minor.patch`.\n\nDataFusion's supports the last 4 stable Rust minor versions released and any such versions released within the last 4 months.\n\nFor example, given the releases `1.78.0`, `1.79.0`, `1.80.0`, `1.80.1` and `1.81.0` DataFusion will support 1.78.0, which is 3 minor versions prior to the most minor recent `1.81`.\n\nNote: If a Rust hotfix is released for the current MSRV, the MSRV will be updated to the specific minor version that includes all applicable hotfixes preceding other policies.\n\nDataFusion enforces MSRV policy using a [MSRV CI Check](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aapache%2Fdatafusion+rust-version+language%3ATOML+path%3A%2F%5ECargo.toml%2F&type=code)\n\n## DataFusion API Evolution and Deprecation Guidelines\n\nPublic methods in Apache DataFusion evolve over time: while we try to maintain a\nstable API, we also improve the API over time. As a result, we typically\ndeprecate methods before removing them, according to the [deprecation guidelines].\n\n[deprecation guidelines]: https://datafusion.apache.org/library-user-guide/api-health.html\n"
