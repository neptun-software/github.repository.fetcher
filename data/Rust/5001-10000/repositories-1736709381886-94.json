For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed\n     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,\n     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is\n     synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n\n  b.

Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n          its terms and conditions.\n\n       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n          6(a).\n\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n       5. Downstream recipients.\n\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\n            b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.\n               Every recipient of Adapted Material from You\n               automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to\n               exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material\n               under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.\n\n            c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n               Material.\n\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b. Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n  b. ShareAlike.\n\n     In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share\n     Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.\n\n       1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons\n          license with the same License Elements, this version or\n          later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.\n\n       2.

          "content": "# Embassy\n\nEmbassy is the next-generation framework for embedded applications. Write safe, correct and energy-efficient embedded code faster, using the Rust programming language, its async facilities, and the Embassy libraries.\n\n## <a href=\"https://embassy.dev/book/index.html\">Documentation</a> - <a href=\"https://docs.embassy.dev/\">API reference</a> - <a href=\"https://embassy.dev/\">Website</a> - <a href=\"https://matrix.to/#/#embassy-rs:matrix.org\">Chat</a>\n## Rust + async ❤️ embedded\n\nThe Rust programming language is blazingly fast and memory-efficient, with no runtime, garbage collector or OS. It catches a wide variety of bugs at compile time, thanks to its full memory- and thread-safety, and expressive type system. \n\nRust's <a href=\"https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/\">async/await</a> allows for unprecedentedly easy and efficient multitasking in embedded systems. Tasks get transformed at compile time into state machines that get run cooperatively. It requires no dynamic memory allocation, and runs on a single stack,  so no per-task stack size tuning is required. It obsoletes the need for a traditional RTOS with kernel context switching, and is <a href=\"https://tweedegolf.nl/en/blog/65/async-rust-vs-rtos-showdown\">faster and smaller than one!</a>\n\n## Batteries included\n\n- **Hardware Abstraction Layers** - HALs implement safe, idiomatic Rust APIs to use the hardware capabilities, so raw register manipulation is not needed. The Embassy project maintains HALs for select hardware, but you can still use HALs from other projects with Embassy.\n  - <a href=\"https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-stm32/\">embassy-stm32</a>, for all STM32 microcontroller families.\n  - <a href=\"https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-nrf/\">embassy-nrf</a>, for the Nordic Semiconductor nRF52, nRF53, nRF91 series.\n  - <a href=\"https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-rp/\">embassy-rp</a>, for the Raspberry Pi RP2040 microcontroller.\n  - <a href=\"https://github.com/esp-rs\">esp-rs</a>, for the Espressif Systems ESP32 series of chips.\n    - Embassy HAL support for Espressif chips is being developed in the [esp-rs/esp-hal](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-hal) repository.\n    - Async WiFi, Bluetooth and ESP-NOW is being developed in the [esp-rs/esp-wifi](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-wifi) repository.\n  - <a href=\"https://github.com/ch32-rs/ch32-hal\">ch32-hal</a>, for the WCH 32-bit RISC-V(CH32V) series of chips.\n\n- **Time that Just Works** - \nNo more messing with hardware timers. <a href=\"https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-time\">embassy_time</a> provides Instant, Duration and Timer types that are globally available and never overflow.\n\n- **Real-time ready** - \nTasks on the same async executor run cooperatively, but you can create multiple executors with different priorities, so that higher priority tasks preempt lower priority ones. See the <a href=\"https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/blob/master/examples/nrf52840/src/bin/multiprio.rs\">example</a>.\n\n- **Low-power ready** - \nEasily build devices with years of battery life. The async executor automatically puts the core to sleep when there's no work to do. Tasks are woken by interrupts, there is no busy-loop polling while waiting.\n \n- **Networking** - \nThe <a href=\"https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-net/\">embassy-net</a> network stack implements extensive networking functionality, including Ethernet, IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP and DHCP. Async drastically simplifies managing timeouts and serving multiple connections concurrently.\n\n- **Bluetooth** - \nThe <a href=\"https://github.com/embassy-rs/nrf-softdevice\">nrf-softdevice</a> crate provides Bluetooth Low Energy 4.x and 5.x support for nRF52 microcontrollers.\nThe <a href=\"https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/tree/main/embassy-stm32-wpan\">embassy-stm32-wpan</a> crate provides Bluetooth Low Energy 5.x support for stm32wb microcontrollers.\n\n- **LoRa** - The <a href=\"https://github.com/lora-rs/lora-rs\">lora-rs</a> project provides an async LoRa and LoRaWAN stack that works well on Embassy.\n\n- **USB** - \n<a href=\"https://docs.embassy.dev/embassy-usb/\">embassy-usb</a> implements a device-side USB stack. Implementations for common classes such as USB serial (CDC ACM) and USB HID are available, and a rich builder API allows building your own.\n\n- **Bootloader and DFU** - \n<a href=\"https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/tree/master/embassy-boot\">embassy-boot</a> is a lightweight bootloader supporting firmware application upgrades in a power-fail-safe way, with trial boots and rollbacks.\n\n\n## Sneak peek\n\n```rust,ignore\nuse defmt::info;\nuse embassy_executor::Spawner;\nuse embassy_time::{Duration, Timer};\nuse embassy_nrf::gpio::{AnyPin, Input, Level, Output, OutputDrive, Pin, Pull};\nuse embassy_nrf::Peripherals;\n\n// Declare async tasks\n#[embassy_executor::task]\nasync fn blink(pin: AnyPin) {\n    let mut led = Output::new(pin, Level::Low, OutputDrive::Standard);\n\n    loop {\n        // Timekeeping is globally available, no need to mess with hardware timers.\n        led.set_high();\n        Timer::after_millis(150).await;\n        led.set_low();\n        Timer::after_millis(150).await;\n    }\n}\n\n// Main is itself an async task as well.\n#[embassy_executor::main]\nasync fn main(spawner: Spawner) {\n    let p = embassy_nrf::init(Default::default());\n\n    // Spawned tasks run in the background, concurrently.\n    spawner.spawn(blink(p.P0_13.degrade())).unwrap();\n\n    let mut button = Input::new(p.P0_11, Pull::Up);\n    loop {\n        // Asynchronously wait for GPIO events, allowing other tasks\n        // to run, or the core to sleep.\n        button.wait_for_low().await;\n        info!(\"Button pressed!\");\n        button.wait_for_high().await;\n        info!(\"Button released!\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Examples\n\nExamples are found in the `examples/` folder separated by the chip manufacturer they are designed to run on. For example:\n\n*   `examples/nrf52840` run on the `nrf52840-dk` board (PCA10056) but should be easily adaptable to other nRF52 chips and boards.\n*   `examples/nrf5340` run on the `nrf5340-dk` board (PCA10095).\n*   `examples/stm32xx` for the various STM32 families.\n*   `examples/rp` are for the RP2040 chip.\n*   `examples/std` are designed to run locally on your PC.\n\n### Running examples\n\n- Install `probe-rs` following the instructions at <https://probe.rs>.\n- Change directory to the sample's base directory. For example:\n\n```bash\ncd examples/nrf52840\n```\n\n- Ensure `Cargo.toml` sets the right feature for the name of the chip you are programming.\n  If this name is incorrect, the example may fail to run or immediately crash\n  after being programmed.\n\n- Ensure `.cargo/config.toml` contains the name of the chip you are programming.\n\n- Run the example\n\nFor example:\n\n```bash\ncargo run --release --bin blinky\n```\n\nFor more help getting started, see [Getting Started][1] and [Running the Examples][2].\n\n## Developing Embassy with Rust Analyzer based editors\n\nThe [Rust Analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/) is used by [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)\nand others. Given the multiple targets that Embassy serves, there is no Cargo workspace file. Instead, the Rust Analyzer\nmust be told of the target project to work with. In the case of Visual Studio Code,\nplease refer to the `.vscode/settings.json` file's `rust-analyzer.linkedProjects`setting.\n\n## Minimum supported Rust version (MSRV)\n\nEmbassy is guaranteed to compile on stable Rust 1.75 and up. It *might*\ncompile with older versions but that may change in any new patch release.\n\n## Why the name?\n\nEMBedded ASYnc! :)\n\n## License\n\nEmbassy is licensed under either of\n\n- Apache License, Version 2.0 ([LICENSE-APACHE](LICENSE-APACHE) or\n  <http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0>)\n- MIT license ([LICENSE-MIT](LICENSE-MIT) or <http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT>)\n\nat your option.\n\n## Contribution\n\nUnless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted\nfor inclusion in the work by you, as defined in the Apache-2.0 license, shall be\ndual licensed as above, without any additional terms or conditions.\n\n[1]: https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/wiki/Getting-Started\n[2]: https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/wiki/Running-the-Examples\n"
