It comes with a robust set of features that make building\nasync web applications and APIs easier and more fun.\n\n## Getting started\n\nIn order to build a web app in Rust you need an HTTP server, and an async\nruntime. After running `cargo init` add the following lines to your\n`Cargo.toml` file:\n\n```toml\n# Example, use the version numbers you need\ntide = \"0.17.0\"\nasync-std = { version = \"1.8.0\", features = [\"attributes\"] }\nserde = { version = \"1.0\", features = [\"derive\"] }\n```\n\n## Examples\n\nCreate an HTTP server that receives a JSON body, validates it, and responds\nwith a confirmation message.\n\n```rust\nuse tide::Request;\nuse tide::prelude::*;\n\n#[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]\nstruct Animal {\n    name: String,\n    legs: u16,\n}\n\n#[async_std::main]\nasync fn main() -> tide::Result<()> {\n    let mut app = tide::new();\n    app.at(\"/orders/shoes\").post(order_shoes);\n    app.listen(\"127.0.0.1:8080\").await?;\n    Ok(())\n}\n\nasync fn order_shoes(mut req: Request<()>) -> tide::Result {\n    let Animal { name, legs } = req.body_json().await?;\n    Ok(format!(\"Hello, {}! I've put in an order for {} shoes\", name, legs).into())\n}\n```\n\n```sh\n$ curl localhost:8080/orders/shoes -d '{ \"name\": \"Chashu\", \"legs\": 4 }'\n```\n```text\nHello, Chashu! I've put in an order for 4 shoes\n```\n\n```sh\n$ curl localhost:8080/orders/shoes -d '{ \"name\": \"Mary Millipede\", \"legs\": 750 }'\n```\n```text\nHello, Mary Millipede! I've put in an order for 750 shoes\n```\n\nSee more examples in the [examples](https://github.com/http-rs/tide/tree/main/examples) directory.\n\n## Tide's design:\n- [Rising Tide: building a modular web framework in the open](https://rustasync.github.io/team/2018/09/11/tide.html)\n- [Routing and extraction in Tide: a first sketch](https://rustasync.github.io/team/2018/10/16/tide-routing.html)\n- [Middleware in Tide](https://rustasync.github.io/team/2018/11/07/tide-middleware.html)\n- [Tide's evolving middleware approach](https://rustasync.github.io/team/2018/11/27/tide-middleware-evolution.html)\n- [Tide, the present and future of](https://blog.yoshuawuyts.com/tide/)\n- [Tide channels](https://blog.yoshuawuyts.com/tide-channels/)\n\n## Community Resources\n<sub>To add a link to this list, [edit the markdown\nfile](https://github.com/http-rs/tide/edit/main/README.md) and\nsubmit a pull request (github login required)</sub><br/><sup>Listing here\ndoes not constitute an endorsement or recommendation from the tide\nteam.
