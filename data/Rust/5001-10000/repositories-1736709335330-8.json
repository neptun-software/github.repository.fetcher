([#pr-number] by [@username])`.\n- The number can be guessed or added after creating the pull request.\n- Links to all pull requests are recorded at the bottom of the unreleased section.\n- If you are a new contributor, please add your name to the others at the bottom of the CHANGELOG.md.\n\nIf your name does not already appear in the [AUTHORS] file, please feel free to\nadd it as part of your patch.\n\n## Code reviews\n\nAll submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We\nuse GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult [GitHub Help] for more\ninformation on using pull requests.\n\n\n## Before opening a PR\n\nTesting a patch on github can take 15+ minutes, and you can save a lot of time by\ntesting locally. We recommend using the following [git `pre-push` hook], by\ncopying it to `druid/.git/hooks/pre-push`:\n\n```sh\n#!/bin/sh\n\nset -e\n\necho \"cargo fmt\"\ncargo fmt --all -- --check\necho \"cargo clippy druid-shell\"\ncargo clippy --manifest-path=druid-shell/Cargo.toml --all-targets --features=raw-win-handle -- -D warnings\necho \"cargo clippy druid\"\ncargo clippy --manifest-path=druid/Cargo.toml --all-targets --features=svg,image,im,raw-win-handle -- -D warnings\necho \"cargo clippy druid (wasm)\"\ncargo clippy --manifest-path=druid/Cargo.toml --all-targets --features=image,im --target wasm32-unknown-unknown -- -D warnings\necho \"cargo clippy druid-derive\"\ncargo clippy --manifest-path=druid-derive/Cargo.toml --all-targets -- -D warnings\necho \"cargo clippy book examples\"\ncargo clippy --manifest-path=docs/book_examples/Cargo.toml --all-targets -- -D warnings\necho \"cargo test druid-shell\"\ncargo test --manifest-path=druid-shell/Cargo.toml\necho \"cargo test druid\"\ncargo test --manifest-path=druid/Cargo.toml --features=svg,image,im\necho \"cargo test druid-derive\"\ncargo test --manifest-path=druid-derive/Cargo.toml\necho \"cargo test book examples\"\ncargo test --manifest-path=docs/book_examples/Cargo.toml\n```\n\n# How to maintain\n\n## Preparing for a new release\n\nIf you're already contributing to this project and want to do more,\nthen there might be a chance to help out with the preparation of new releases.\nWhether you're new or have prepared Druid releases many times already,\nit helps to follow a checklist of what needs to be done. This is that list.\n\n### Increasing the versions\n\nThe `druid`, `druid-shell`, and `druid-derive` `Cargo.toml` files need to be updated.\nThe `version` field needs to be increased to the next [semver] version that makes sense.\nThese packages all also import each other and those cross-dependency versions need updating too.\n\nYou should also search for the previous version number across the whole workspace\nto find any other references that might need updating. There are for example plenty of links\nto specific version documentation that will need updating.\n\n### Changelog\n\n- Add a new *Unreleased* section by copying the current one.\n  Keep the sections, but delete the entries.\n- Rename the old *Unreleased* section to the target release version and add the release date.\n- Add the correct link for the target release revision to the bottom of the file.\n- Update the changelog introduction message to reflect this new release.\n- Delete any empty sections.\n- Tidy up the entries, possibly reordering some for more logical grouping.\n\n### Dependencies\n\n**We only test and specify the newest versions of dependencies.** Read on for more details.\n\nRust dependencies like Druid specify their own sub-dependencies in `Cargo.toml`.\nThese specifications are usually version ranges according to [semver],\nstating that the dependency requires a sub-dependency of the specified version\nor any newer version that is still compatible. It is up to the final application\nto choose which actual versions get used via the `Cargo.lock` file of that application.\n\nBecause the final application chooses the sub-dependency versions and they are most likely\ngoing to be higher than the minimum that is specified in our `Cargo.toml` file,\nwe need to make sure that Druid works properly with these newer versions.\nYes according to [semver] rules they should work, but library authors make mistakes\nand it won't be a good experience or a sign of Druid's quality if a new developer\nadds Druid as a dependency and it won't even compile.\nFor that reason our CI testing always uses the highest version that is still compatible.\nThis mimics what a new developer would experience when they start using Druid.\n\nWhat about the minimum supported version or all the versions between the minimum and maximum?\nIt is not practical for us to test all the combinations of possible sub-dependency versions.\nWithout testing there can easily be mistakes. Let's say our `Cargo.toml` specifies that\nwe depend on the package `foo` version `^1.1.1` and the latest `foo` version is `1.1.3`.\nThe CI tests with `1.1.3` and contributors have `1.1.3` in their local `Cargo.lock`.\n`Cargo.toml` specifies `1.1.1` as the minimum because that was the latest version\nwhen the dependency was added and `1.1.1` did work just fine originally.\nHowever it turns out that this specific version had a bug which doesn't interact well\nwith some other package `bar`. Our CI testing or manual testing would never find this out,\nbecause we're already using `1.1.3` and deleting and regenerating `Cargo.lock` wouldn't change that.\nJust because `1.1.1` used to work back in the day doesn't mean that it will always keep working.\n\nOne partial solution to this problem is to be more precise in what we are actually promising.\nSo whenever we release a new version we also update all our dependencies in `Cargo.toml`\nto match the versions that we are actually testing with. This will be much more accurate\nto the spirit of the version specification - Druid will work with the specified version\nand any newer one if it's [semver] compatible. We're not testing the extremely big matrix of\nold versions of our sub-dependencies and so we shouldn't claim that the old versions will work.\n\n#### Prerequisites for updating the dependency specifications\n\nAn easy way to do this is to use the `cargo upgrade` tool available via [`cargo-edit`].\n\n```sh\ncargo install cargo-edit\n```\n\n*Note that the following instructions were written for `cargo-edit` v0.11. If you have a newer\nmajor version there may have been changes to the way `cargo-edit` works.*\n\n#### Performing the update\n\nWe want to update our `Cargo.toml` files to specify the newest versions which are still\n[semver] compatible with what we have previously specified in our `Cargo.toml` files.\n\nIf you just want to see what would happen you can add the `--dry-run` option.\n\n```sh\ncargo upgrade\n```\n\nRunning this command will update all the `Cargo.toml` files in the workspace and also `Cargo.lock`.\n\n#### Semver incompatible updates\n\nIncompatible version updates should be done manually after carefully reviewing the changes.\nHowever you can still use the `cargo upgrade` tool to find out which dependencies could be updated.\n\n```sh\ncargo upgrade -i --dry-run\n```\n\nThen based on the reported potential updates you should manually go and check out what has changed,\nplus how and if it makes sense to update to the newer version.\n\n### Screenshots\n\nWe need to update the screenshots. This involves:\n\n- Taking new screenshots.\n- Adding them to the repository in the `screenshots` branch on Github.\n- Updating the links in the README to point to the new screenshots.\n\n### Publishing\n\nOnce all the docs, cargo files and screenshots have been updated, we need to\npublish the crate to crates.io.\n\n#### Ensure your git setup supports symbolic links\n\nDruid makes use of symbolic links but not every git configuration has symlink support enabled,\n[most commonly on Windows](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/wiki/Symbolic-Links).\nMake sure your configuration has it enabled. The following command must not return `false`.\n\n```sh\ngit config core.symlinks\n```\n\nIf the above command returns `false` then you need to enable this setting and reset your clone.\n\n##### Enabling git supprot for symbolic links on Windows\n\nFirst you need to make sure your user account has the `SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege` privilege.\nEasiest test for this is to open `cmd.exe` and run the following:\n\n```sh\necho \"Hello\" > original.txt\nmklink link.txt original.txt\ntype link.txt\n```\n\nIf the `mklink` command didn't complain about privileges and the final `type` command prints out\n*Hello* then you have the privilege. If there is a failure, then you need to enable the privilege.\n\nThere are [many ways to enable this privilege](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/wiki/Symbolic-Links#allowing-non-administrators-to-create-symbolic-links),\nbut we'll cover two here. First option is to just enable *developer mode* from the settings app.\nThis is a bit heavyweight and changes a lot of settings but it will work. Another more precise\noption is to run `gpedit.msc` as Administrator, navigate to *Computer Configuration >\nWindows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > User Rights Assignment* and add your\naccount name to the *Create symbolic links* policy. Then you will need to log out and back in.\n\nOnce you have the system privilege you must change your git system configuration, which you can\ndo by executing the following command as Administrator:\n\n```sh\ngit config --system core.symlinks true\n```\n\nThen you must also change the configuration of your local clone of the Druid repository,\nby executing the following commands in the repo directory:\n\n```sh\ngit config --local core.symlinks true\ngit reset --hard\n```\n\nNow you should be all set.\n\n#### Publishing the crates\n\nWe need to publish the crates in a specific order, because the `druid` crate depends on the two\nother crates. We use `--no-verify` for `druid-derive` to deal with a cyclic dependency on the\n`druid` version which we haven't published yet.\n\n```sh\ncargo publish --manifest-path=\"druid-derive/Cargo.toml\" --no-verify\ncargo publish --manifest-path=\"druid-shell/Cargo.toml\"\ncargo publish --manifest-path=\"druid/Cargo.toml\"\n```\n\n#### Tagging the release\n\nOnce we've published our crate, we create a new git tag:\n\n```sh\ngit tag $MY_NEW_VERSION_NUMBER HEAD\n```\n\nFinally, we [create a new Github release](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository#creating-a-release).\n\n[GitHub Help]: https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/\n[AUTHORS]: AUTHORS\n[changelog]: CHANGELOG.md\n[`cargo-edit`]: https://crates.io/crates/cargo-edit\n[semver]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html\n[git `pre-push` hook]: https://githooks.com\n[Xilem]: https://github.com/linebender/xilem\n"

Its main goal was to offer a\npolished user experience. There were many factors to this goal, including\nperformance, a rich palette of interactions (hence a widget library to support\nthem), and playing well with the native platform.\nSee the [goals section](#Goals) for more details.\n\nWe did periodic releases of Druid on crates.io. All changes were documented\nin [the changelog](https://github.com/linebender/druid/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).\n\nFor an overview of some key concepts, see the incomplete [Druid book].\n\n## Project status\n\n**UNMAINTAINED**\n\n**The Druid project has been discontinued.**\n\nNew development effort moved on to [Xilem], which has a lot of fundamental changes to allow for\na wider variety of applications with better performance, but it also heavily inherits from Druid.\nWe see [Xilem] as the future of Druid.\n\nDruid is reasonably usable for [some subset of applications](https://github.com/linebender/druid/issues/1360)\nand has a significant testing history, which ensures some stability and correctness.\nHowever, there will not be any new features or bug fixes coming to Druid. As such we don't recommend\nusing Druid for brand new applications. If you insist, then at least make sure your application\ndoesn't require a feature that Druid doesn't have, e.g. accessibility or 3D support.\n\n## Contributions\n\nAs the Druid project has been discontinued, **we will not be accepting any more contributions**.\n\nPlease take a look at some of our other projects instead, especially the Druid successor [Xilem].\n\n## Example\n\nHere's a simple counter example app:\n\n```rust\nuse druid::widget::{Button, Flex, Label};\nuse druid::{AppLauncher, LocalizedString, PlatformError, Widget, WidgetExt, WindowDesc};\n\nfn main() -> Result<(), PlatformError> {\n    let main_window = WindowDesc::new(ui_builder());\n    let data = 0_u32;\n    AppLauncher::with_window(main_window)\n        .log_to_console()\n        .launch(data)\n}\n\nfn ui_builder() -> impl Widget<u32> {\n    // The label text will be computed dynamically based on the current locale and count\n    let text =\n        LocalizedString::new(\"hello-counter\").with_arg(\"count\", |data: &u32, _env| (*data).into());\n    let label = Label::new(text).padding(5.0).center();\n    let button = Button::new(\"increment\")\n        .on_click(|_ctx, data, _env| *data += 1)\n        .padding(5.0);\n\n    Flex::column().with_child(label).with_child(button)\n}\n```\n\nCheck out the [the examples folder] for a more comprehensive demonstration of\nDruid's existing functionality and widgets.

In order to achieve this we strived for a variety of things:\n\n- Make it easy to build and package on all supported platforms.\n- Implement abstractions to avoid platform specific quirks.\n- Respect platform conventions and expectations.\n- Handle display resolution and scaling reliably with little effort.\n- Enable easy, yet powerful internationalization.\n- Offer robust accessibility support.\n- Produce small and fast binaries with low memory usage.\n- Have a small dependency tree, a high quality code base and good organization.\n- Focus on powerful, desktop-grade applications.\n- Provide a flexible set of layouts and common widgets.\n- Ease creation of custom components and application logic as needed.\n\n### Non-Goals\n\nIn order to fulfill those goals, we couldn't support every use case. Luckily\nthe Rust community is working on a variety of different libraries with\ndifferent goals, so here are some of Druid's non-goals and possible\nalternatives that can offer those capabilities:\n\n- Use the platform-native widgets or mimic them. ([Relm], [Slint])\n- Embed easily into custom render pipelines. ([Conrod])\n- Adhere to a specific architectural style such as Elm. ([Iced], [Relm])\n- Support rendering to HTML when targeting the web. ([Iced], [Moxie])\n\nDruid was just one of many ongoing [Rust-native GUI experiments].\n\n## Concepts\n\n### druid-shell\n\nThe Druid toolkit uses `druid-shell` for a platform-abstracting application shell.\n`druid-shell` is responsible for starting a native platform runloop, listening to\nevents, converting them into a platform-agnostic representation, and calling a\nuser-provided handler with them.\n\nWhile `druid-shell` was being developed with the Druid toolkit in mind, it was\nintended to be general enough that it could be reused by other projects\ninterested in experimenting with Rust GUI. The `druid-shell` crate includes a\ncouple of [non-`druid` examples].\n\n### piet\n\nDruid relies on the [Piet library] for drawing and text layout. Piet is a 2D graphics\nabstraction with multiple backends: `piet-direct2d`, `piet-coregraphics`, `piet-cairo`,\n`piet-web`, and `piet-svg` are currently available.\nIn terms of Druid platform support via Piet, macOS uses `piet-coregraphics`,\nLinux/OpenBSD/FreeBSD use `piet-cairo`, Windows uses `piet-direct2d`, and web uses `piet-web`.\n\n```rust\nuse druid::kurbo::{BezPath, Point, Rect};\nuse druid::piet::Color;\n\n// Create an arbitrary bezier path\n// (ctx.size() returns the size of the layout rect we're painting in)\nlet mut path = BezPath::new();\npath.move_to(Point::ORIGIN);\npath.quad_to(\n    (80.0, 90.0),\n    (ctx.size().width, ctx.size().height),\n);\n// Create a color\nlet stroke_color = Color::rgb8(0x00, 0x80, 0x00);\n// Stroke the path with thickness 1.0\nctx.stroke(path, &stroke_color, 1.0);\n\n// Rectangles: the path for practical people\nlet rect = Rect::from_origin_size((10., 10.), (100., 100.));\n// Note the Color:rgba8 which includes an alpha channel (7F in this case)\nlet fill_color = Color::rgba8(0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x7F);\nctx.fill(rect, &fill_color);\n```\n\n### widgets\n\nWidgets in Druid (text boxes, buttons, layout components, etc.) are objects\nwhich implement the [Widget trait]. The trait is parametrized by a type (`T`)\nfor associated data. All trait methods (`event`, `lifecycle`, `update`, `paint`,\nand `layout`) are provided with access to this data, and in the case of\n`event` the reference is mutable, so that events can directly update the data.\n\nWhenever the application data changes, the framework traverses the widget\nhierarchy with an `update` method.\n\nAll the widget trait methods are provided with a corresponding context\n([EventCtx], [LifeCycleCtx], [UpdateCtx], [LayoutCtx], [PaintCtx]). The widget can request\nthings and cause actions by calling methods on that context.\n\nIn addition, all trait methods are provided with an environment `Env`, which\nincludes the current theme parameters (colors, dimensions, etc.).\n\n```rust\nimpl<T: Data> Widget<T> for Button<T> {\n    fn event(&mut self, ctx: &mut EventCtx, event: &Event, data: &mut T, env: &Env) {\n      ...\n    }\n\n    fn lifecycle(&mut self, ctx: &mut LifeCycleCtx, event: &LifeCycle, data: &T, env: &Env) {\n      ...\n    }\n\n    fn update(&mut self, ctx: &mut UpdateCtx, old_data: &T, data: &T, env: &Env) {\n      ...\n    }\n\n    fn layout(&mut self, ctx: &mut LayoutCtx, bc: &BoxConstraints, data: &T, env: &Env) -> Size {\n      ...\n    }\n\n    fn paint(&mut self, ctx: &mut PaintCtx, data: &T, env: &Env) {\n      ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\nDruid provides a number of [basic utility and layout widgets] and it's easy to\nimplement your own. You can also compose widgets into new widgets:\n\n```rust\nfn build_widget() -> impl Widget<u32> {\n    let mut col = Flex::column();\n    for i in 0..30 {\n        let button = Button::new(format!(\"Button {}\", i).padding(5.0);\n        col.add_child(button);\n    }\n    Scroll::new(col)\n}\n```\n\n### layout\n\nDruid's layout protocol was strongly inspired by [Flutter's box layout model].\nIn Druid, widgets are passed a `BoxConstraint` that provides them a minimum and\nmaximum size for layout. Widgets are also responsible for computing appropriate\nconstraints for their children if applicable.\n\n### data\n\nDruid uses a [Data trait] to represent [value types]. These should be cheap to\ncompare and cheap to clone.\n\nIn general, you can use `derive` to generate a `Data` impl for your types.\n\n```rust\n#[derive(Clone, Data)]\nstruct AppState {\n    which: bool,\n    value: f64,\n}\n```\n\n### lens\n\nThe [Lens datatype] gives access to a part of a larger data structure. Like\n`Data`, this can be derived. Derived lenses are accessed as associated constants\nwith the same name as the field.\n\n```rust\n#[derive(Clone, Data, Lens)]\nstruct AppState {\n    which: bool,\n    value: f64,\n}\n```\n\nTo use the lens, wrap your widget with `LensWrap` (note the conversion of\nCamelCase to snake_case):\n\n```rust\nLensWrap::new(WidgetThatExpectsf64::new(), AppState::value);\n```\n\nAlternatively, lenses for structs, tuples, and indexable containers can be\nconstructed on-demand with the `lens` macro:\n\n```rust\nLensWrap::new(WidgetThatExpectsf64::new(), lens!(AppState, value));\n```\n\nThis is particularly useful when working with types defined in another crate.\n\n## Authors\n\nThe main authors are Raph Levien and Colin Rofls, with much support from an\nactive and friendly community.
