          "content": "# Architecture\n\n** WORK IN PROGRESS **\n\nThis document describes high-level architecture and basic concepts of Fyrox. It should help you to understand\nbasics of the engine's architecture and find a right place for your modifications.\n\n## Overview\n\nFyrox is a monolithic game engine with very few replaceable parts. This means that Fyrox itself has relatively\nstrong coupling between modules. However, some of its parts can be used as standalone crates - core, UI and \nsound are independent of the engine. Internal coupling is one-way in most of the places, this means that, for\ninstance, a renderer **is** dependent on a scene, but scene does **not** know anything about the renderer.\nThis fact makes changes in the engine very easy even for beginners.\n\nFyrox consists of the four crates - fyrox-core, fyrox-sound, fyrox-ui, and Fyrox itself. fyrox-core, fyrox-sound and\nfyrox-ui are **standalone** crates and can be used separately, the only place where these three are meet is the\nFyrox. Previously each crate had a separate repository, but then I decided to put everything in single repository\nbecause it was too much of a pain to build any project that uses the engine.\n\nAnother important fact is that Fyrox **does not** use ECS, instead it uses generational arenas (pools in Fyrox's\nterminology) for efficient memory management (fast allocation/deallocation, CPU cache efficiency). This means\nthat you are working with good old structures which are placed in contiguous memory block (pool). Once an\nobject was placed in a pool, you get a handle to the object which can be used to access (borrow) the object\nwhen you need. Such approach allows you to make any relations between the objects - handle is just a pair of \nnumbers, it won't cause issues with borrow checker. For more info check \n[pool.rs](https://github.com/FyroxEngine/Fyrox/blob/master/fyrox-core/src/pool.rs).\n\n### Core\n\nCore contains some of very common algorithms and data structures that are used across other parts of the engine.\nIt contains linear algebra, accelerating structures, color-space functions, etc. In other words it contains \n\"building blocks\" that are very widely used across other parts of the engine. \n\n### Renderer\n\nFyrox uses a combination of deferred + forward renderers. The deferred renderer is used to render opaque objects,\nwhen the forward renderer is used to render transparent objects. The renderer provides lots of very common \ngraphical effects. The renderer is suitable for most of the needs, however it is not flexible enough yet and \nthere is no way of using custom shaders yet.\n\n### User Interface\n\nFyrox uses custom user interface library. It is node-based, has very powerful layout system, uses messages\nto communicate between widgets, supports styling. The library has 30+ widgets (including docking manager,\nwindows, file browsers, etc). Please keep in mind that the library does not render anything, instead it\njust prepares a set of drawing commands which can be used with any kind of renderer - a software (GDI for\ninstance) or a hardware (OpenGL, DirectX, Vulkan, Metal, etc.).\n\n### Sound\n\nFyrox uses software sound engine [fyrox-sound](https://github.com/FyroxEngine/Fyrox/tree/master/fyrox-sound).\nThe sound engine provides support for binaural sound rendering using HRTF, which gives excellent sound \nspatialization. \n\n## Code Map\n\nCode map should help you find a right place for your modifications. This is the most boring part of the \ndocument, here is the table of contents for your comfort:\n\n- [fyrox-core](#fyrox-core)\n    - [math](#mathmodrs)\n- [fyrox-ui](#fyrox-ui)\n    - [widgets](#borderrs)\n- [fyrox-sound](#fyrox-sound)\n    - [buffer](#buffermodrs)\n    - [decoder](#decodermodrs)\n    - [device](#devicemodrs)\n- [Fyrox](#fyrox)\n\n### fyrox-core\n\nAs it was already said up above, fyrox-core is just a set of useful algorithms. If you want to add a thing\nthat will be used in dependent crates then you're in the right place. Here is the very brief description\nof each module.\n\n#### math/mod.rs\n\nThe module contains some intersection check algorithms, vector projection methods (tri-planar mapping for \nexample), generic rectangle struct, and other stuff that cannot be easily classified.\n\n#### math/aabb.rs\n\nThe module contains Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) structure. It is used as a bounding volume to accelerate\nspatial checks (like ray casting, coarse intersection checks, etc).\n\n#### math/frustum.rs\n\nThe module contains Frustum structure. Its purpose (in the project) is to perform visibility checks - for\nexample camera is using frustum culling to determine which objects must be rendered on screen. \n\n#### math/plane.rs\n\nThe module contains Plane structure that basically represents just plane equation. Planes are used for \nintersection tests.\n\n#### math/ray.rs\n\nThe module contains Ray structure which is used for intersection tests. For example the engine uses rays\nin lightmapper to do ray tracing to calculate shadows.\n\n#### math/triangulator.rs\n\nThe module contains a set of triangulation algorithms for polygon triangulation. There are two algorithms:\nsimple one is for quadrilaterals, and generic one is the ear-clipping algorithm. The stuff from the module is\nused to triangulate polygons in 3d models to make them suitable to render on GPU.\n\n#### color.rs\n\nThe module contains structure and methods to work with colors in HSV and RGB color spaces, and to convert \ncolors HSV <-> RGB.\n\n#### color_gradient.rs\n\nThe module contains simple linear color gradient with multiple points. It is widely used in particle systems\nto change color of particles over time. For example a spark starts from white color and becomes more red over\ntime and finally becomes black.\n\n#### lib.rs\n\nThe module contains BiDirHashMap and very few other algorithms.\n\n#### numeric_range.rs\n\nThe module contains fool-proof numeric range - there is no way to create a range with incorrect bounds - bounds\nwill be determined at the sampling moment.\n\n#### octree.rs\n\nThe module contains Octree acceleration structure which is used to accelerate ray casting, point-probing, \nbox intersection tests and so on.\n\n#### pool.rs\n\nThe module contains the heart of the engine: pool is one of the most commonly used structure in the engine.\nIts purpose is to provide a storage for objects of a type in a contiguous block of memory. Any object\ncan be accessed later by a handle. Handles are some sort of indices, but with additional information that \nis used to check if handle is valid.\n\n#### profiles.rs\n\nThe module contains a simple intrusive profiler. It uses special macro (scope_profile!()) to time a scope.\n\n#### rectpack.rs\n\nThe module contains rectangle packing algorithm (most commonly known as \"bin-packing problem\"). It is used\nto create texture atlases.\n\n#### visitor.rs\n\nThe module contains node-based serializer/deserializer (visitor). Everything in the engine serialized by \nthis serializer. It supports serialization of basic types, many std types (including\nRc/Arc) and user-defined types.\n\n### fyrox-ui\n\nfyrox-ui is a standalone, graphics API-agnostic, node-based, general-purpose user interface library.\n\n#### lib.rs\n\nThe module contains UserInterface structure and Control trait. \n\n#### border.rs\n\nThe module contains Border widget which is basically just a rectangle with variable width of borders, and\nan ability to be a container for child widgets.\n\n#### brush.rs\n\nThe module contains Brush structure which describes a way of drawing graphics primitives. \n\n#### button.rs\n\nThe module contains Button widget and its builder.\n\n#### canvas.rs\n\nThe module contains Canvas widget and its builder. Canvas is a simple container for child widgets,\nit allows setting position of children widgets directly. \n\n#### check_box.rs\n\nThe module contains CheckBox widget and its builder. CheckBox is a three-state (checked, unchecked,\nundefined) switch.\n\n#### color.rs\n\nThe module contains widgets to work with colors and their builders. There are separate widgets to change\nhue, saturation, brightness and compound color selector widget.\n\n#### decorator.rs\n\nThe module contains Decorator widget and its builder. Decorator is a simple container for child widgets,\nit has built-in behaviour for most common actions: it changes appearance when mouse enters or leaves bounds,\nwhen user clicks on it, etc. \n\n#### dock.rs\n\nThe module contains DockingManager and Tile widgets and their builders. Docking manager is able to combine\nmultiple Window widgets in its tiles, each tile can be resized, docked or undocked. This is the must-have\nwidget for any kind of editor.\n\n#### draw.rs\n\nThe module is responsible for \"drawing\". It is in quotes, because it does not actually draw anything, it just \nemits drawing commands in a queue for later interpretation. \n\n#### dropdown_list.rs\n\nThe module contains DropdownList widget and its builder. DropdownList is a small field that shows selected\nitem and a \"popup\" that contains list of items.\n\n#### expander.rs\n\nThe module contains Expander widget and its builder. Expander is a collapsable container for child widgets\nwith a field that describes a content. \n\n#### file_browser.rs\n\nThe module contains a set of widgets that displays file system. FileBrowser widget is a simple file system\ntree, FileSelector is a window with FileBrowser and few buttons. \n\n#### formatted_text.rs\n\nThe module is responsible for text formatting and \"rendering\". The latter is in quotes, because the library \njust uses glyph info from a font to layout each glyph in a line of text with word wrapping and other \nuseful features (like text size calculation, etc).\n\n#### grid.rs\n\nThe module contains Grid widget and its builder. Grid is a powerful layout widget, it allows arranging child\nwidgets in a series of rows and columns.\n\n#### image.rs\n\nThe module contains Image widget and its builder. Image is a simple rectangle with a texture.\n\n#### list_view.rs\n\nThe module contains ListView widget and its builder. ListView is a container for items which arranged \nas a stack. ListView supports item selection.\n\n#### menu.rs\n\nThe module contains menu widgets. Menu here means a classic menu which is a strip with root items and a \nset of child sub-menus.\n\n#### message.rs\n\nThe module contains all supported messages for every widget in the library. \n\n#### messagebox.rs\n\n#### node.rs\n\n#### numeric.rs\n\n#### popup.rs\n\n#### progress_bar.rs\n\n#### scroll_bar.rs\n\n#### scroll_panel.rs\n\n#### scroll_viewer.rs\n\n#### stack_panel.rs\n\n#### tab_control.rs\n\n#### text.rs\n\n#### tree.rs\n\n#### ttf.rs\n\n#### utils.rs\n\n#### vec.rs\n\n#### vector_image.rs\n\n#### widget.rs\n\n#### window.rs\n\n#### wrap_panel.rs\n\n### fyrox-sound\n\nfyrox-sound is a standalone sound engine with multiple renderers and high-quality sound.

You have to use respective scene nodes (`Sound`, `Listener`) and `Effect` from \n`fyrox::scene::sound` module (and children modules). \n\n### Nodes\n\nSince `Node` enumeration was removed, there is a new way of managing nodes:\n\n- `Node` now is just `Box<dyn NodeTrait>` wrapped in a new-type-struct.\n- Pattern matching was replaced with `cast` and `cast_mut` methods.\n- In addition to `cast/cast_mut` there are two more complex methods for polymorphism: `query_component_ref` and\n`query_component_mut` which are able to extract references to internal parts of the nodes. This now has only one\nusage - `Light` enumeration was removed and `PointLight`, `SpotLight`, `DirectionalLight` provides unified access\nto `BaseLight` component via `query_component_ref/query_component_mut`. `query_component` could be a bit slower,\nsince it might involve additional branching while attempting to query component. \n- `Base` node was replaced with `Pivot` node (and respective `PivotBuilder`), it happend due to problems with \n`Deref<Target = Base>/DerefMut` implementation, if `Base` is implementing `NodeTrait` then it must implement `Deref`\nbut implementing `Deref` for `Base` causes infinite deref coercion loop.\n- To be able to create custom scene nodes and having the ability to serialize/deserialize scene graph with such\nnodes, `NodeConstructorContainer` was added. It contains a simple map `UUID -> NodeConstructor` which allows to\npick the right node constructor based on type uuid at deserialization stage.\n\n#### Replacing `BaseBuilder` with `PivotBuilder`\n\nIt is very simply, just wrap `BaseBuilder` with a `PivotBuilder` and call `build` on `PivotBuilder` instance:\n\n```rust\n// Before\nfn create_pivot_node(graph: &mut Graph) -> Handle<Node> {\n    BaseBuilder::new().build(graph)    \n}\n\n// After\nfn create_pivot_node(graph: &mut Graph) -> Handle<Node> {\n    PivotBuilder::new(BaseBuilder::new()).build(graph)\n}\n```\n\n#### Pattern matching replacement\n\nPattern matching was replaced with 4 new methods `cast/cast_mut/query_component_ref/query_component_mut`:\n\n```rust\nfn set_sprite_color(node: &mut Node, color: Color) {\n    // Use `cast_mut` when you are sure about the real node type.\n    if let Some(sprite) = node.cast_mut::<Sprite>() {\n        sprite.set_color(color);\n    }\n}\n\nfn set_light_color(node: &mut Node, color: Color) {\n    // Use query_component_mut if you unsure what is the exact type of the node.\n    // In this example the `node` could be either PointLight, SpotLight, DirectionalLight,\n    // since they're all provide access to `BaseLight` via `query_component_x` the function\n    // will work with any of those types.\n    if let Some(base_light) = node.query_component_mut::<BaseLight>() {\n        base_light.set_color(color);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Listener\n\nNow there is no need to manually sync position and orientation of the sound listener, all you need to do\ninstead is to create `Listener` node and attach it to your primary camera (or other scene node). Keep\nin mind that the engine supports only one listener, which means that only one listener can be active \nat a time. The engine will not stop you from having multiple listeners active, however only first (the \norder is undefined) will be used to output sound.\n\n### Sound sources\n\nThere is no more 2D/3D separation between sounds, all sounds in 3D by default. Every sound source now is\na scene node and can be created like so:\n\n```rust\nlet sound = SoundBuilder::new(\n    BaseBuilder::new().with_local_transform(\n        TransformBuilder::new()\n            .with_local_position(position)\n            .build(),\n    ),\n)\n.with_buffer(buffer.into())\n.with_status(Status::Playing)\n.with_play_once(true)\n.with_gain(gain)\n.with_radius(radius)\n.with_rolloff_factor(rolloff_factor)\n.build(graph);\n```\n\nIts API mimics `fyrox_sound` API so there should be now troubles in migration.\n\n### Effects\n\nEffects got a thin wrapper around `fyrox_sound` to make them compatible with `Sound` scene nodes, a reverb\neffect instance can be created like so:\n\n```rust\nlet reverb = ReverbEffectBuilder::new(BaseEffectBuilder::new().with_gain(0.7))\n    .with_wet(0.5)\n    .with_dry(0.5)\n    .with_decay_time(3.0)\n    .build(&mut scene.graph.sound_context);\n```\n\nA sound source can be attached to an effect like so:\n\n```rust\ngraph\n    .sound_context\n    .effect_mut(self.reverb)\n    .inputs_mut()\n    .push(EffectInput {\n        sound,\n        filter: None,\n    });\n```\n\n### Filters\n\nEffect input filters API remain unchanged.\n\n### Engine initialization\n\n`Engine::new` signature has changed to accept `EngineInitParams`, all previous argument were moved to the \nstructure. However, there are some new engine initialization parameters, like `serialization_context` and\n`resource_manager`. Previously `resource_manager` was created implicitly, currently it has to be created\noutside and passed to `EngineInitParams`. This is because of new `SerializationContext` which contains\na set of constructors for various types that may be used in the engine and be added by external plugins.\nTypical engine initialization could look something like this:\n\n```rust\nuse fyrox::engine::{Engine, EngineInitParams};\nuse fyrox::window::WindowBuilder;\nuse fyrox::engine::resource_manager::ResourceManager;\nuse fyrox::event_loop::EventLoop;\nuse std::sync::Arc;\nuse fyrox::engine::SerializationContext;\n\nfn init_engine() {\n    let evt = EventLoop::new();\n    let window_builder = WindowBuilder::new()\n        .with_title(\"Test\")\n        .with_fullscreen(None);\n    let serialization_context = Arc::new(SerializationContext::new());\n    let mut engine = Engine::new(EngineInitParams {\n        window_builder,\n        resource_manager: ResourceManager::new(serialization_context.clone()),\n        serialization_context,\n        events_loop: &evt,\n        vsync: false,\n    })\n    .unwrap();\n}\n```\n\n## Serialization\n\nEngine and ResourceManager both are non-serializable anymore. It changes approach of creating save files in games.\nPreviously you used something like this (following code snippets are modified versions of `save_load` example):\n\n```rust\nconst SAVE_FILE: &str = \"save.bin\";\n\nfn save(game: &mut Game) {\n    let mut visitor = Visitor::new();\n\n    game.engine.visit(\"Engine\", visitor)?; // This no longer works\n    game.game_scene.visit(\"GameScene\", visitor)?;\n    \n    visitor.save_binary(Path::new(SAVE_FILE)).unwrap();\n}\n\nfn load(game: &mut Game) {\n    if Path::new(SAVE_FILE).exists() {\n        if let Some(game_scene) = game.game_scene.take() {\n            game.engine.scenes.remove(game_scene.scene);\n        }\n\n        let mut visitor = block_on(Visitor::load_binary(SAVE_FILE)).unwrap();\n\n        game.engine.visit(\"Engine\", visitor)?; // This no longer works\n        game.game_scene.visit(\"GameScene\", visitor)?;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nHowever, on practice this approach could lead to some undesirable side effects. The main problem with the old \napproach is that when you serialize the engine, it serializes all scenes you have. This fact is more or less\nok if you have only one scene, but if you have two and more scenes (for example one for menu and one for \ngame level) it writes/reads redundant data. The second problem is that you cannot load saved games asynchronously\nusing the old approach, because it takes mutable access of the engine and prevents you from off-threading work.\n\nThe new approach is much more flexible and do not have such issues, instead of saving the entire state of the\nengine, you just save and load only what you actually need:\n\n```rust\nconst SAVE_FILE: &str = \"save.bin\";\n\nfn save(game: &mut Game) {\n    if let Some(game_scene) = game.game_scene.as_mut() {\n        let mut visitor = Visitor::new();\n\n        // Serialize game scene first.\n        game.engine.scenes[game_scene.scene]\n            .save(\"Scene\", &mut visitor)\n            .unwrap();\n        // Then serialize the game scene.\n        game_scene.visit(\"GameScene\", &mut visitor).unwrap();\n\n        // And call save method to write everything to disk.\n        visitor.save_binary(Path::new(SAVE_FILE)).unwrap();\n    }\n}\n\n// Notice that load is now async.\nasync fn load(game: &mut Game) {\n    // Try to load saved game.\n    if Path::new(SAVE_FILE).exists() {\n        // Remove current scene first.\n        if let Some(game_scene) = game.game_scene.take() {\n            game.engine.scenes.remove(game_scene.scene);\n        }\n\n        let mut visitor = Visitor::load_binary(SAVE_FILE).await.unwrap();\n\n        let scene = SceneLoader::load(\"Scene\", &mut visitor)\n            .unwrap()\n            .finish(game.engine.resource_manager.clone())\n            .await;\n\n        let mut game_scene = GameScene::default();\n        game_scene.visit(\"GameScene\", &mut visitor).unwrap();\n\n        game_scene.scene = game.engine.scenes.add(scene);\n        game.game_scene = Some(game_scene);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see in the new approach you save your scene and some level data, and on load - you load the scene, add\nit to the engine as usual and load level's data. The new approach is a bit more verbose, but it is much more \nflexible.\n\n# 0.24\n\n## Engine\n\n- 2D games support (with 2D physics as well)\n- Three new scene nodes was added: RigidBody, Collider, Joint. Since rigid body, collider and joint are graph nodes\nnow, it is possible to have complex hierarchies built with them.  \n- It is possible to attach rigid body to any node in scene graph, its position now will be correct in this case (\npreviously it was possible to have rigid bodies attached only on root scene nodes).\n- New `Inspector` widget + tons of built-in property editors (with the ability to add custom editors)\n- `Inspect` trait + proc macro for lightweight reflection\n- UI now using dynamic dispatch allowing you to add custom nodes and messages easily\n- fyrox-sound optimizations (30% faster)\n- Linear interpolation for sound samples when sampling rate != 1.0 (much better quality than before)\n- Color fields in material editor now editable\n- Window client area is now correctly filled by the renderer on every OS, not just Windows.\n- NumericRange removal (replaced with standard Range + extension trait)\n- Sort files and directories in FileBrowser/FileSelector widgets\n- RawStreaming data source for sound\n- Renderer performance improvements (2.5x times faster)\n- UI layout performance improvements\n- Prevent renderer from eating gigabytes of RAM\n- Use `#[inline]` attribute to enable cross-crate inlining\n- `ImmutableString` for faster hashing of static strings\n- `SparseBuffer` as a lightweight analog for `Pool` (non-generational version)\n- Support diffuse color in FBX materials\n- Frustum culling fixes for terrain\n- Shaders don't print empty lines when compiles successfully.\n- `Pool` improvements\n- Impl `IntoIterator` for references to `Pool`\n- Cascaded shadow maps for directional light sources\n- `spawn_at` + `spawn_at_handle` for `Pool`\n- Preview for drag'n'drop\n- `Grid` widget layout performance optimizations (**1000x** performance improvement - this is not a typo)\n- `query_component` for UI widgets\n- Curve resource\n- Remove all associated widgets of a widget when deleting the widget (do not leave dangling objects)\n- World bounding box calculation fix\n- Heavy usage of invalidation in UI routines (prevents checking tons of widgets every frame)\n- Migrate to `parking-lot` synchronization primitives\n- Migrate to `FxHash` (faster hashing)\n- `Log::verify` to log errors of `Result<(), Error`\n- Custom scene node properties support\n- `Alt+Click` prevents selection in `Tree` widget\n- Ability to change camera projection (Perspective or Orthographic) \n- Smart position selection for popups (prevents them from appearing outside screen bounds)\n- High-quality mip-map generation using Lanczos filter.\n\n## Editor\n\n- `Inspector` widget integration, which allowed to remove tons of boilerplate code\n- Middle mouse button camera dragging\n- Q/E + Space to move camera up/down\n- Working directory message is much less confusing now\n- Ability to edit sound sources in the editor\n- Checkerboard colorization fix in the world viewer\n- Search in the world viewer\n- Floating brush panel for terrain editor\n- Editor camera has manual exposure (not affected by auto-exposure)\n- Curve editor\n- Automatically select an newly created instance of a scene node\n- Grid snapping fix\n- Angle snapping\n- Edit properties of multiple selected objects at once.\n- Context menu for scene items in world viewer\n- `Create child` for scene item context menu\n- Import options editor for asset browser\n- Hot reload for textures.\n\n## Breaking changes and migration guide\n\nThere are lots of breaking changes in this version, however all of them mostly related to the code and scenes made in\nprevious version _should_ still be loadable.\n\n### Convert old scenes to new format\n\nAt first, install the rusty-editor from crates.io and run it:\n\n```shell\ncargo install rusty-editor\nrusty-editor\n```\n\nAnd then just re-save your scenes one-by-one. After this all your scenes will be converted to the newest version.\nKeep in mind that the editor from GitHub repo (0.25+) is not longer have backward compatibility/conversion code!\n\n### 2D scenes\n\n2D scene were completely removed and almost every 2D node were removed, there is only one \"2D\" node left - Rectangle.\n2D now implemented in 3D scenes, you have to use orthographic camera for that. There is no migration guide for 2D scenes\nbecause 2D had rudimentary support, and I highly doubt that there is any project that uses 2D of the engine.\n\n## Resource management\n\nResource manager has changed its API and gained some useful features that should save you some time. \n\n`request_texture` now accepts only one argument - path to texture, second argument was used to pass \n`TextureImportOptions`. Import options now should be located in a separate options file. For example, you have a \n`foo.jpg` texture and you want to change its import options (compression, wrapping modes, mip maps, etc.). To do this\nyou should create `foo.jpg.options` file in the same directory near your file with following content (each field is\noptional):\n\n```text\n(\n    minification_filter: LinearMipMapLinear,\n    magnification_filter: Linear,\n    s_wrap_mode: Repeat,\n    t_wrap_mode: Repeat,\n    anisotropy: 16,\n    compression: NoCompression,\n)\n```\n\nThe engine will read this file when you'll call `request_texture` and it will apply the options on the first load.\nThis file is not mandatory, you can always set global import defaults in resource manage by calling \n`set_texture_import_options`.\n\n`request_model` have the same changes, there is only one argument and import options were moved to options file:\n\n```text\n(\n    material_search_options: RecursiveUp\n)\n```\n\nAgain, all fields aren't mandatory and the entire file can be omitted, global import defaults can be set by calling\n`set_model_import_options`.\n\n### Physics\n\nOld physics was replaced with new scene nodes: RigidBody, Collider, Joint. Old scenes will be automatically converted\non load, you should convert your scenes as soon as possible using the editor (open your scene and save it, that will\ndo the conversion).\n\nNow there are two ways of adding a rigid body to a scene node:\n\n- If you want your object to have a rigid body (for example a crate with box rigid body), your object must be \n**child** object of a rigid body. Graphically it can be represented like this:\n\n```text\n- Rigid Body\n  - Crate3DModel\n  - Cuboid Collider     \n```\n\n- If you want your object to have a rigid body that should move together with your object (to simulate hit boxes for \nexample), then rigid body must be child object of your object. Additionally it should be marked as `Kinematic`, \notherwise it will be affected by simulation (simply speaking it will fall on ground). Graphically it can be \nrepresented like this:\n\n```text\n- Limb\n  - Rigid Body\n     - Capsule Collider\n```\n\n#### Migration\n\nThis section will help you to migrate to new physics.\n\n##### Rigid bodies\n\nRigid body and colliders now can be created like so:\n\n```rust\nuse fyrox_impl::{\n    core::{algebra::Vector3, pool::Handle},\n    scene::{\n        base::BaseBuilder,\n        collider::{ColliderBuilder, ColliderShape},\n        node::Node,\n        rigidbody::RigidBodyBuilder,\n        transform::TransformBuilder,\n        Scene,\n    },\n};\n\nfn create_capsule_rigid_body(scene: &mut Scene) -> Handle<Node> {\n    RigidBodyBuilder::new(\n        BaseBuilder::new()\n            .with_local_transform(\n                // To position, rotate rigid body you should use engine's transform.\n                TransformBuilder::new()\n                    .with_local_position(Vector3::new(1.0, 2.0, 3.0))\n                    .build(),\n            )\n            .with_children(&[\n                // It is very important to add at least one child collider node, otherwise rigid\n                // body will not do collision response.\n                ColliderBuilder::new(\n                    BaseBuilder::new().with_local_transform(\n                        // Colliders can have relative position to their parent rigid bodies.\n                        TransformBuilder::new()\n                            .with_local_position(Vector3::new(0.0, 0.5, 0.0))\n                            .build(),\n                    ),\n                )\n                // Rest of properties can be set almost as before.\n                .with_friction(0.2)\n                .with_restitution(0.1)\n                .with_shape(ColliderShape::capsule_y(0.5, 0.2))\n                .build(&mut scene.graph),\n            ]),\n    )\n    // Rest of properties can be set almost as before.\n    .with_mass(2.0)\n    .with_ang_damping(0.1)\n    .with_lin_vel(Vector3::new(2.0, 1.0, 3.0))\n    .with_ang_vel(Vector3::new(0.1, 0.1, 0.1))\n    .build(&mut scene.graph)\n}\n```\n\n##### Joints\n\nJoints can be created in a similar way:\n\n```rust\nfn create_ball_joint(scene: &mut Scene) -> Handle<Node> {\n    JointBuilder::new(BaseBuilder::new())\n        .with_params(JointParams::BallJoint(BallJoint {\n            local_anchor1: Vector3::new(1.0, 0.0, 0.0),\n            local_anchor2: Vector3::new(-1.0, 0.0, 0.0),\n            limits_local_axis1: Vector3::new(1.0, 0.0, 0.0),\n            limits_local_axis2: Vector3::new(1.0, 0.0, 0.0),\n            limits_enabled: true,\n            limits_angle: 45.0,\n        }))\n        .with_body1(create_capsule_rigid_body(scene))\n        .with_body2(create_capsule_rigid_body(scene))\n        .build(&mut scene.graph)\n}\n```\n\n##### Raycasting\n\nRaycasting located in `scene.graph.physics`, there were almost no changes to it, except now it returns handles to\nscene nodes instead of raw collider handles.\n\n##### Contact info\n\nContact info can now be queried from the collider node itself, via `contacts()` method.\n\n```rust\nfn query_contacts(collider: Handle<Node>, graph: &Graph) -> impl Iterator<Item = ContactPair> {\n    graph[collider].as_collider().contacts(&graph.physics)\n}\n```"

          "content": "# Contributors guidelines\n\nThis document explains how to contribute to the engine. Keep in mind, that this not a \"must-obey\" list; use common sense\nwhen contributing something to the engine.\n\n## How to contribute\n\n- **Code** - writing code is the most obvious way of contribution. You can add missing features, fix bugs, improve\n  existing tools, etc. See the [code section](#contributing-code) for more info.\n- **Documentation** - documentation is the next place where you can contribute, this engine is already quite big and\n  there's a bunch of undocumented code. If you're familiar with some undocumented API, don't hesitate - write\n  documentation for it. You will save a lot of time for the next people who will be using this API and they will be\n  grateful that the docs exists.\n  See the [documentation section](#contributing-documentation) for more info.\n- **Make games** - the best way to understand what's missing or needs to be improved is by making games using the\n  engine. When you find something missing or can be improved, don't hesitate - create an issue in this repository and\n  may be somebody will spot this issue and fix it. Filing issues is always good, it clearly shows that there's something\n  wrong and people can track the progress.\n- **Report bugs** - if something does not work as it should, file an issue about it so the problem will be clear. Any\n  software has edge cases, that could be hidden for a long time, until you need to do something non-trivial.\n- **Donation** - if you don't have any time to write the code or docs, and you want to see the project alive, you should\n  consider donating any amount of money to the developers of the engine.\n- **Promote the engine** - write posts, make videos, share news about the engine on social media and so on.\n\n## Contributing code\n\nCommon rules for code contributions:\n\n- **Keep code clean** - name your variables and functions meaningfully. Try to not create god-like functions, that\n  handles everything at once. Always compile your code before making a pull request.\n- **Write documentation** - document your code. It should explain what the code does at high level. Do not include low\n  level details in your documentation (unless you need to explain something, that is very important).\n- **Format your code** - use `rustfmt` to format the code you're writing.\n- **Write unit tests** - if you're adding new functionality to the engine, make sure to write unit tests for it. It is\n  not always possible to write meaningful unit tests, for example, graphics can hardly be tested this way. In this case\n  make sure to thoroughly test your code manually.\n- **Describe your code** - it is important to explain why you wrote the code and what it does. Do not create pull\n  requests with description like: \"fixed bug\", \"added stuff\", etc. It does not help anyone, instead write a proper\n  description.\n- **License** - include the content of `LICENSE.md` file at the top of any new source code file. Every line must be\n  start from `\\\\ ` (two slashes with a space after them). You can add your own copyright line with dates, but you must\n  keep the license unchanged (MIT).\n\nWhen you're writing something for the editor, you can run its standalone version using `fyroxed` package like so\n`cargo run --packaged fyroxed`. This way the editor will run without any plugins, and you can test your changes quickly\nwithout a need to create a project and test there.\n\n## Contributing documentation\n\nCommon rules for documentation contributions:\n\n- **Write everything in English** - official API documentation and [the book](https://fyrox-book.github.io/) written in\n  English. If you want to create a translation for the book, you should create your own repository.\n- **Add code examples** - code snippets helps other developers to quickly understand how to use a function/method.\n- **Use spell checker** - keep the docs clean and readable.\n- **Expertise** - make sure that you understand the thing you're writing the docs for. Shallow docs are usually\n  misleading, and sometimes they're even worse, than no documentation at all. "
