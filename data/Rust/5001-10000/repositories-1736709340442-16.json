Takes\n   less than 20 seconds to tokenize a GB of text on a server's CPU.\n - Easy to use, but also extremely versatile.\n - Designed for research and production.\n - Normalization comes with alignments tracking. It's always possible to get the part of the\n   original sentence that corresponds to a given token.\n - Does all the pre-processing: Truncate, Pad, add the special tokens your model needs.\n\n## Performances\nPerformances can vary depending on hardware, but running the [~/bindings/python/benches/test_tiktoken.py](bindings/python/benches/test_tiktoken.py) should give the following on a g6 aws instance:\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b913d4b-e488-4cbc-b542-f90a6c40643d)\n\n\n## Bindings\n\nWe provide bindings to the following languages (more to come!):\n  - [Rust](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers/tree/main/tokenizers) (Original implementation)\n  - [Python](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers/tree/main/bindings/python)\n  - [Node.js](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers/tree/main/bindings/node)\n  - [Ruby](https://github.com/ankane/tokenizers-ruby) (Contributed by @ankane, external repo)\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can install from source using:\n```bash\npip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers.git#subdirectory=bindings/python\n```\n\nour install the released versions with\n\n```bash\npip install tokenizers\n```\n \n## Quick example using Python:\n\nChoose your model between Byte-Pair Encoding, WordPiece or Unigram and instantiate a tokenizer:\n\n```python\nfrom tokenizers import Tokenizer\nfrom tokenizers.models import BPE\n\ntokenizer = Tokenizer(BPE())\n```\n\nYou can customize how pre-tokenization (e.g., splitting into words) is done:\n\n```python\nfrom tokenizers.pre_tokenizers import Whitespace\n\ntokenizer.pre_tokenizer = Whitespace()\n```\n\nThen training your tokenizer on a set of files just takes two lines of codes:\n\n```python\nfrom tokenizers.trainers import BpeTrainer\n\ntrainer = BpeTrainer(special_tokens=[\"[UNK]\", \"[CLS]\", \"[SEP]\", \"[PAD]\", \"[MASK]\"])\ntokenizer.train(files=[\"wiki.train.raw\", \"wiki.valid.raw\", \"wiki.test.raw\"], trainer=trainer)\n```\n\nOnce your tokenizer is trained, encode any text with just one line:\n```python\noutput = tokenizer.encode(\"Hello, y'all! How are you 😁 ?\")\nprint(output.tokens)\n# [\"Hello\", \",\", \"y\", \"'\", \"all\", \"!\", \"How\", \"are\", \"you\", \"[UNK]\", \"?\"]\n```\n\nCheck the [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/tokenizers/index)\nor the [quicktour](https://huggingface.co/docs/tokenizers/quicktour) to learn more!\n"

          "content": "## How to release\n\n# Before the release\n\nSimple checklist on how to make releases for `tokenizers`.\n\n- Freeze `master` branch.\n- Run all tests (Check CI has properly run)\n- If any significant work, check benchmarks:\n  - `cd tokenizers && cargo bench` (needs to be run on latest release tag to measure difference if it's your first time)\n- Run all `transformers` tests. (`transformers` is a big user of `tokenizers` we need\n  to make sure we don't break it, testing is one way to make sure nothing unforeseen\n  has been done.)\n  - Run all fast tests at the VERY least (not just the tokenization tests). (`RUN_PIPELINE_TESTS=1 CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=-1 pytest -sv tests/`)\n  - When all *fast*  tests work, then we can also (it's recommended) run the whole `transformers`\n  test suite. \n    - Rebase this [PR](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/16708).\n        This will create new docker images ready to run the tests suites with `tokenizers` from the main branch.\n    - Wait for actions to finish\n    - Rebase this [PR](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/16712)\n        This will run the actual full test suite.\n    - Check the results.\n- **If any breaking change has been done**, make sure the version can safely be increased for transformers users (`tokenizers` version need to make sure users don't upgrade before `transformers` has). [link](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/setup.py#L154)\n  For instance `tokenizers>=0.10,<0.11` so we can safely upgrade to `0.11` without impacting\n  current users\n- Then start a new PR containing all desired code changes from the following steps.\n- You will `Create release` after the code modifications are on `master`.\n\n# Rust\n\n- `tokenizers` (rust, python & node) versions don't have to be in sync but it's\n  very common to release for all versions at once for new features.\n- Edit `Cargo.toml` to reflect new version\n- Edit `CHANGELOG.md`:\n    - Add relevant PRs that were added (python PRs do not belong for instance).\n    - Add links at the end of the files.\n- Go to [Releases](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers/releases)\n- Create new Release:\n    - Mark it as pre-release\n    - Use new version name with a new tag (create on publish) `vX.X.X`.\n    - Copy paste the new part of the `CHANGELOG.md`\n- ⚠️  Click on `Publish release`. This will start the whole process of building a uploading\n  the new version on `crates.io`, there's no going back after this\n- Go to the [Actions](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers/actions) tab and check everything works smoothly.\n- If anything fails, you need to fix the CI/CD to make it work again. Since your package was not uploaded to the repository properly, you can try again.\n\n\n# Python\n\n- Edit `bindings/python/setup.py` to reflect new version.\n- Edit `bindings/python/py_src/tokenizers/__init__.py` to reflect new version.\n- Edit `CHANGELOG.md`:\n    - Add relevant PRs that were added (node PRs do not belong for instance).\n    - Add links at the end of the files.\n- Go to [Releases](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers/releases)\n- Create new Release:\n    - Mark it as pre-release\n    - Use new version name with a new tag (create on publish) `python-vX.X.X`.\n    - Copy paste the new part of the `CHANGELOG.md`\n- ⚠️  Click on `Publish release`. This will start the whole process of building a uploading\n  the new version on `pypi`, there's no going back after this\n- Go to the [Actions](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers/actions) tab and check everything works smoothly.\n- If anything fails, you need to fix the CI/CD to make it work again. Since your package was not uploaded to the repository properly, you can try again.\n- This CI/CD has 3 distinct builds, `Pypi`(normal), `conda` and `extra`. `Extra` is REALLY slow (~4h), this is normal since it has to rebuild many things, but enables the wheel to be available for old Linuxes\n\n# Node\n\n- Edit `bindings/node/package.json` to reflect new version.\n- Edit `CHANGELOG.md`:\n    - Add relevant PRs that were added (python PRs do not belong for instance).\n    - Add links at the end of the files.\n- Go to [Releases](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers/releases)\n- Create new Release:\n    - Mark it as pre-release\n    - Use new version name with a new tag (create on publish) `node-vX.X.X`.\n    - Copy paste the new part of the `CHANGELOG.md`\n- ⚠️  Click on `Publish release`. This will start the whole process of building a uploading\n  the new version on `npm`, there's no going back after this\n- Go to the [Actions](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers/actions) tab and check everything works smoothly.\n- If anything fails, you need to fix the CI/CD to make it work again. Since your package was not uploaded to the repository properly, you can try again.\n\n\n# Testing the CI/CD for release\n\n\nIf you want to make modifications to the CI/CD of the release GH actions, you need\nto : \n- **Comment the part that uploads the artifacts** to `crates.io`, `PyPi` or `npm`.\n- Change the trigger mechanism so it can trigger every time you push to your branch.\n- Keep pushing your changes until the artifacts are properly created.\n"
