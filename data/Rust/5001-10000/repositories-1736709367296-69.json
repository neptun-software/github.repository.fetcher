This replaces the `dbus` module with `dbus_native` module. However, As this is not in public interface for the crate, the users of this crate should not need any code changes. As this removes the dependency on the `libdbus` system library, you can uninstall it if desired.\n\n## v0.1.0 -> v0.2.0\n\n### libcontainer\n\n- The `Rootless` struct has been re-named as `UserNamespaceConfig` , `RootlessIDMapper` has been re-named to `UserNamespaceIDMapper` , and correspondingly the `RootlessError` has been re-named to `UserNamespaceError` . This is due to the fact that the structure was to be used for containers when a new user namespace is to be created, and that is not strictly only for rootless uses. Accordingly, the fields of various structs has been updated to reflect this change :\n  - rootless (module name) -> user_ns\n  - Rootless.rootless_id_mapper -> UserNamespaceConfig.id_mapper\n  - LibcontainerError::Rootless -> LibcontainerError::UserNamespace\n  - ContainerBuilderImpl.rootless -> ContainerBuilderImpl.user_ns_config\n  - ContainerArgs.rootless -> ContainerArgs.user_ns_config\n\n- Executor now contains 2 methods for implementation. We introduce a `validate` step in addition to execute. The `validate` should validate the input OCI spec. The step runs after all the namespaces are entered and rootfs is pivoted.\n\n- Executor is now composible instead of an array of executor. To implement multiple executor, create a new executor that runs all the executor. The users are now in control of how multiple executor are run.\n"

In Japanese language, youki also means 'cheerful', 'merry', or 'hilarious'.\n\n# üöÄ Quick Start\n\n> [!TIP]\n> You can immediately set up your environment with youki on GitHub Codespaces and try it out.  \n>\n> [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/containers/youki?quickstart=1)\n> ```console\n> $ just build\n> $ docker run --runtime youki hello-world\n> $ sudo podman run --cgroup-manager=cgroupfs --runtime /workspaces/youki/youki hello-world\n> ```\n\n[User Documentation](https://youki-dev.github.io/youki/user/basic_setup.html#quick-install)\n\n# üéØ Motivation\n\nHere is why we are writing a new container runtime in Rust.\n\n- Rust is one of the best languages to implement the oci-runtime spec. Many very nice container tools are currently written in Go. However, the container runtime requires the use of system calls, which requires a bit of special handling when implemented in Go. This tricky (e.g. _namespaces(7)_, _fork(2)_); with Rust too, but it's not that tricky. And, unlike in C, Rust provides the benefit of memory safety. While Rust is not yet a major player in the container field, it has the potential to contribute a lot: something this project attempts to exemplify.\n- youki has the potential to be faster and use less memory than runc, and therefore work in environments with tight memory usage requirements. Here is a simple benchmark of a container from creation to deletion.\n  |  Runtime | Time (mean ¬± œÉ) | \tRange (min ‚Ä¶ max) | vs youki(mean) | Version | \n  | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |\n  | youki     | 111.5 ms ¬± 11.6 ms  | 84.0 ms ¬± 142.5 ms   | 100% | 0.3.3 |\n  | runc     | 224.6 ms ¬± 12.0 ms  | 190.5 ms ¬± 255.4 ms   | 200% | 1.1.7 |\n  | crun     | 47.3 ms ¬± 2.8 ms  | 42.4 ms ¬± 56.2 ms   | 42% | 1.15 |\n    <details>\n  <summary>Details about the benchmark</summary>\n\n  - A command used for the benchmark\n\n    ```bash\n    hyperfine --prepare 'sudo sync; echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches' --warmup 10 --min-runs 100 'sudo ./youki create -b tutorial a && sudo ./youki start a && sudo ./youki delete -f a'\n    ```\n\n  - Environment\n\n    ```console\n    $ ./youki info\n    Version           0.3.3\n    Commit            4f3c8307\n    Kernel-Release    6.5.0-35-generic\n    Kernel-Version    #35~22.04.1-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Tue May  7 09:00:52 UTC 2\n    Architecture      x86_64\n    Operating System  Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS\n    Cores             16\n    Total Memory      63870\n    Cgroup setup      unified\n    Cgroup mounts\n    Namespaces        enabled\n      mount           enabled\n      uts             enabled\n      ipc             enabled\n      user            enabled\n      pid             enabled\n      network         enabled\n      cgroup          enabled\n    Capabilities\n    CAP_BPF           available\n    CAP_PERFMON       available\n    CAP_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE available\n    ```\n\n  </details>\n\n- I have fun implementing this. In fact, this may be the most important.\n\n# üìç Status of youki\n\n**youki** has aced real-world use cases, including containerd's e2e test, and is now adopted by several production environments.\nWe have [our roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/containers/projects/15).\n\n![youki demo](docs/demo.gif)\n\n# üîó Related project\n\n- [containers/oci-spec-rs](https://github.com/containers/oci-spec-rs) - OCI Runtime and Image Spec in Rust\n\n# üé® Design and implementation of youki\n\nThe User and Developer Documentation for youki is hosted at [https://youki-dev.github.io/youki/](https://youki-dev.github.io/youki/)\n\n![Architecture](docs/.drawio.svg)\n\n# üé¨ Getting Started\n\nLocal build is only supported on Linux.\nFor other platforms, please use the [Vagrantfile](#setting-up-vagrant) that we have prepared. You can also spin up a fully preconfigured development environment in the cloud with [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/getting-started/quickstart).\n\n## Requires\n\n- Rust(See [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)), edition 2021\n- linux kernel ‚â• 5.3\n\n## Dependencies\n\nTo install `just`, follow the instruction [here](https://github.com/casey/just#installation).\n\n### Debian, Ubuntu and related distributions\n\n```console\n$ sudo apt-get install    \\\n      pkg-config          \\\n      libsystemd-dev      \\\n      build-essential     \\\n      libelf-dev          \\\n      libseccomp-dev      \\\n      libclang-dev        \\\n      libssl-dev\n```\n\n### Fedora, CentOS, RHEL and related distributions\n\n```console\n$ sudo dnf install          \\\n      pkg-config            \\\n      systemd-devel         \\\n      elfutils-libelf-devel \\\n      libseccomp-devel      \\\n      clang-devel           \\\n      openssl-devel\n```\n\n## Build\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:containers/youki.git\ncd youki\njust youki-dev # or youki-release\n./youki -h # you can get information about youki command\n```\n\n## Tutorial\n\n### Requires\n\n- Docker(See [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install))\n\n### Create and run a container\n\nLet's try to run a container that executes `sleep 30` with youki. This tutorial may need root permission.\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:containers/youki.git\ncd youki\njust youki-dev # or youki-release\n\nmkdir -p tutorial/rootfs\ncd tutorial\n# use docker to export busybox into the rootfs directory\ndocker export $(docker create busybox) | tar -C rootfs -xvf -\n```\n\nThen, we need to prepare a configuration file. This file contains metadata and specs for a container, such as the process to run, environment variables to inject, sandboxing features to use, etc.\n\n```bash\n../youki spec  # will generate a spec file named config.json\n```\n\nWe can edit the `config.json` to add customized behaviors for container. Here, we modify the `process` field to run `sleep 30`.\n\n```json\n  \"process\": {\n    ...\n    \"args\": [\n      \"sleep\", \"30\"\n    ],\n\n  ...\n  }\n```\n\nThen we can explore the lifecycle of a container:\n\n```bash\ncd ..                                                # go back to the repository root\nsudo ./youki create -b tutorial tutorial_container   # create a container with name `tutorial_container`\nsudo ./youki state tutorial_container                # you can see the state the container is `created`\nsudo ./youki start tutorial_container                # start the container\nsudo ./youki list                                    # will show the list of containers, the container is `running`\nsudo ./youki delete tutorial_container               # delete the container\n```\n\nChange the command to be executed in `config.json` and try something other than `sleep 30`.\n\n### Rootless container\n\n`youki` provides the ability to run containers as non-root user([rootless mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/)). To run a container in rootless mode, we need to add some extra options in `config.json`, other steps are same with above:\n\n```bash\n$ mkdir -p tutorial/rootfs\n$ cd tutorial\n# use docker to export busybox into the rootfs directory\n$ docker export $(docker create busybox) | tar -C rootfs -xvf -\n\n$ ../youki spec --rootless          # will generate a spec file named config.json with rootless mode\n## Modify the `args` field as you like\n\n$ ../youki run rootless-container   # will create and run a container with rootless mode\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nStart the docker daemon.\n\n```bash\ndockerd --experimental --add-runtime=\"youki=$(pwd)/youki\"\n```\n\nIf you get an error like the below, that means your normal Docker daemon is running, and it needs to be stopped. Do that with your init system (i.e., with systemd, run `systemctl stop docker`, as root if necessary).\n\n```console\nfailed to start daemon: pid file found, ensure docker is not running or delete /var/run/docker.pid\n```\n\nNow repeat the command, which should start the docker daemon.\n\nYou can use youki in a different terminal to start the container.\n\n```bash\ndocker run -it --rm --runtime youki busybox\n```\n\nAfterwards, you can close the docker daemon process in other the other terminal. To restart normal docker daemon (if you had stopped it before), run:\n\n```bash\nsystemctl start docker # might need root permission\n```\n\n### Integration Tests\n\nGo and node-tap are required to run integration tests. See the [opencontainers/runtime-tools](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-tools) README for details.\n\n```bash\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\njust test-oci\n```\n\n### Setting up Vagrant\n\nYou can try youki on platforms other than Linux by using the Vagrantfile we have prepared. We have prepared two environments for vagrant, namely rootless mode and rootful mode\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:containers/youki.git\ncd youki\n\n# If you want to develop in rootless mode, and this is the default mode\nvagrant up\nvagrant ssh\n\n# or if you want to develop in rootful mode\nVAGRANT_VAGRANTFILE=Vagrantfile.root vagrant up\nVAGRANT_VAGRANTFILE=Vagrantfile.root vagrant ssh\n\n# in virtual machine\ncd youki\njust youki-dev # or youki-release\n```\n\n# üë• Community and Contributing\n\nPlease refer to [our community page](https://youki-dev.github.io/youki/community/introduction.html).\n\nThanks to all the people who already contributed!\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/containers/youki/graphs/contributors\">\n  <img src=\"https://contributors-img.web.app/image?repo=containers/youki\" />\n</a>\n"
