          "content": "# Massa Community Charter\n\nCode for open collaboration & truly decentralized blockchain\n\nThis is the “social” contract that all members of the Massa community are committed to read and to follow (hereinafter the “Charter”). By member we mean anyone who owns Massa tokens, who hosts a node, or who creates blocks on the Massa blockchain (hereinafter a “Member”).\n\nThis Charter aims to reflect the values of openness, transparency, and decentralization. By signing this Charter, any individual, institution, or social group of any kind commits to fulfill the principles established below. \n\n## Decentralization\n\nIn order to preserve the fully decentralized character of the blockchain, the members undertake to make direct use of their Massa and more specifically not to delegate or transmit the management of their Massa to other members for staking; or to take on such delegation or management to stake on their behalf (as described in the section Prohibition on delegation by any means). Such a prohibition is effective when the amount of tokens transmitted or delegated to a given member is greater than or equal to 1,000,000 MAS tokens in total.\n\n\nThus, any Member commits themselves not to act within the Massa community as professional delegates (person or entity whose economic activity, whether principal or accessory, is to receive coins from other members to stake them on their behalf). For the avoidance of doubt, listing Massa on an exchange platform is allowed and other exchange platform activities (receive, manage and trade cryptocurrencies between blockchain networks) are allowed except staking of Massa tokens.\n\n## Prohibition of delegation by any means \n\nAs mentioned above (see Decentralization section above), the Massa ecosystem community recognizes that, for reasons of decentralization, delegating or transferring the management of tokens held by a given Member to another one constitutes an assumption of delegation contrary to the terms of this Charter. This includes, but is not limited to:\nDelegating or transferring tokens to a third party, whether professional or not, to stake or validate blocks on behalf of a given token holder;\nParticipating in a delegation pool.\nAny violation of the prohibition of delegation is subject to sanctions, such as:\nSuspension or exclusion of the given Member from the Massa community;\nLegal action against the failing Member.\nIn any and all instances, any Member who feels aggrieved under the terms of the present provisions may request Massa Foundation's support, in particular for the purpose of taking legal action in the event that the defaulting Member's behavior is manifestly disproportionate and contrary to the present provisions. \nIn addition, any Member may also bring legal action with the support of any private entity they choose, such as a law firm. The provisions of this charter have full contractual value, allowing such an action to be brought in the event of a violation, whether the action is brought directly by the Foundation, by a community member with the support of the Foundation, or by a community member with the support of a private law firm.\n\n## Accountability\n\nThe community recognizes everyone's right to be anonymous, however members' activities must be carried out in accordance with the charter to ensure that they do not undermine other members or even the decentralization of the Massa blockchain.\n\nMassa members agree about what constitutes fair use of the platform, and are committed to not engaging in its misuse, whether explicitly or covertly. On a regular basis, and in case of doubt, the community may implement a number of measures to ensure compliance with these commitments. The community can also engage in all necessary actions in order to establish evidence of non-compliance in order to incur the liability of non-compliant persons. \n\n## Transparency and integrity\n\nThe Massa network, and its current or future configuration, development, deployment and use must ensure and prioritize transparency [1], traceability [2] and integrity [3] within the community at all times.\n\n* [1] Transparency is a necessary condition for monitoring participatory processes and mechanisms, but will never, in any case, be applied to the processing of personal data or in violation of the privacy of Massa participants. \n\n* [2] Traceability refers to the ability to fully account for what happens in any participatory or decision-making process related to the Massa community in the past and, to guarantee similar conditions for present and future ones. Each member acts on his or her own behalf or undertakes to make his or her position clear when acting on behalf of another Massa user or member. \n\n* [3] Integrity is understood as the authenticity of a specific operation, vote, or decision process, in order to avoid manipulation of the blockchain or results of participatory processes or mechanisms.\n\n## Continuous improvement and governance\n\nThe Charter will be accessible within the blockchain source code available at https://github.com/massalabs/massa. The community will be responsible for updating the present Charter in light of its collective needs. Mechanisms for periodic review and evaluation of this Charter will be provided in order to facilitate its continuous improvement.\n\nEvery Member of the Massa community is responsible for the application of this Charter.\n\n## Massa protocol license\n\nIn addition to the rights set forth in the Open Source license(s) included in the distribution for this software, data, and/or documentation (collectively the \"Software,\" and such licenses collectively with this additional terms the \"Software License\"), the copyright holders wish to facilitate interoperability and regulate such data exchange with other software (including constants, function signatures, data structures and other invocation methods used to run or interact with each of them).\n\nThe implementation of the Massa protocol is conditional to the acceptance of and compliance with the Massa Charter available (the \"Charter\"). The mere use of any software implementing the Massa protocol makes you a Member of the Massa community and requires the reading and acceptance of the Charter. You must therefore accept the terms of the Charter and undertake to ensure that other members of the community respect them as well. \n\nFailure to comply with these terms may result in legal action, as specified in the present provisions.\n"

A short\nintroduction video is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUUFhvd7ulY).\n\nMassa's purpose is to make it easy to deploy fully decentralized applications. We've developed two key technologies that\nare exclusive to Massa to help make this possible:\n[autonomous smart contracts](https://docs.massa.net/docs/learn/asc/intro) and native\n[front-end hosting](https://docs.massa.net/docs/learn/decentralized-web).\n\nHere is a list of tools to easily build applications on the Massa blockchain:\n\n- [JS Client library](https://github.com/massalabs/massa-web3) to connect to the Massa blockchain from your applications.\n- [AssemblyScript](https://github.com/massalabs/massa-as-sdk) SDKs to write smart contracts.\n- [Examples of applications](https://github.com/massalabs/massa-sc-examples) built on Massa.\n- [Explorer](https://explorer.massa.net/mainnet).\n- [Interactive API specification](https://playground.open-rpc.org/?schemaUrl=https://test.massa.net/api/v2&uiSchema\\[appBar\\]\\[ui:input\\]=false&uiSchema\\[appBar\\]\\[ui:inputPlaceholder\\]=Enter+Massa+JSON-RPC+server+URL&uiSchema\\[appBar\\]\\[ui:logoUrl\\]=https://massa.net/favicons/favicon.ico&uiSchema\\[appBar\\]\\[ui:splitView\\]=false&uiSchema\\[appBar\\]\\[ui:darkMode\\]=false&uiSchema\\[appBar\\]\\[ui:title\\]=Massa&uiSchema\\[appBar\\]\\[ui:examplesDropdown\\]=false&uiSchema\\[methods\\]\\[ui:defaultExpanded\\]=false&uiSchema\\[methods\\]\\[ui:methodPlugins\\]=true&uiSchema\\[params\\]\\[ui:defaultExpanded\\]=false).\n- [Lots of documentation](https://docs.massa.net), from [web3 development](https://docs.massa.net/docs/build/home)\n  to [Massa's architecture](https://docs.massa.net/docs/learn/home).\n\n## Become a node runner\n\nWith decentralization as a core value, we've gone to great lengths to lower the barrier of entry for community\nparticipation in our mainnet, and we [invite you to join in](https://docs.massa.net/docs/node/home) by\nbecoming a node runner!\n\n## Community\n\nWe have active community discussions on several platforms, and we invite you to join the conversations. If you wish to\ngo into some depth about technical aspects, speak with people working in the ecosystem full-time, or just have a chat\nwith other like-minded people, these can be good places to start:\n\n- [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/massa)\n- [Telegram](https://t.me/massanetwork)\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MassaLabs)\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions from the community at large, from anywhere between seasoned OSS contributors, to those hoping\nto try it for the first time.\n\nIf you would like some help to get started, reach out to us on our community [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/massa)\nserver. If you're comfortable enough to get started on you're own, check out our\n[good first issue](https://github.com/massalabs/massa/labels/good%20first%20issue) label.\n\n### Contributors\n\nA list of all the contributors can be found [here](CONTRIBUTORS.md)\n\n## Community Charter\n\nThe Massa Community Charter is designed to protect decentralization.\nYou can find it here: [COMMUNITY_CHARTER.md](COMMUNITY_CHARTER.md)\n\n## Initial distribution files\n\nThe following initial distribution files:\n* `massa-node/base_config/initial_ledger.json`\n* `massa-node/base_config/deferred_credits.json`\n* `massa-node/base_config/initial_rolls.json`\n\nAre copied from `https://github.com/Massa-Foundation/genesis-ledger/tree/main/node_initial_setup` at commit hash `9bb16c286d2bdc830490bd0af70571207d34921c`.\n"
