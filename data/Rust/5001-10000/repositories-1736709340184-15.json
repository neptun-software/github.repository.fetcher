Previously, this would *hide* the character panel, but now `-C` *shows* the character panel, in case it has been previously (e.g. in an `alias`) disabled with `--no-characters`, see #187 (@sharkdp)\n\n## `hexyl` as a library\n\n- New `endianness` method for `PrinterBuilder`\n\n\n# v0.12.0\n\n## Features\n\n- Only show one panel by default if the terminal width is not wide enough for two panels, see #182 (@sharkdp)\n- Respect the `NO_COLOR` environment variable, see #179 (@sharifhsn)\n\n## Bugfixes\n\n- Do not fail with an error if `--panels=auto` is used and the output is piped, see #184 (@sharkdp)\n\n## Changes\n\n- Breaking: For `xxd`-compatibility reasons, `--group_bytes` has been renamed to `--group-size` (with an `--groupsize` alias), see #121 (@sharkdp)\n\n## `hexyl` as a library\n\n- Breaking: `num_group_bytes` has been renamed to `group_size`.\n\n\n# v0.11.0\n\n## Features\n\n- Significantly improved performance, see #173 and #176 (@sharifhsn)\n- Added variable panels through the `--panels` and `--terminal-width` flags, see [#13](https://github.com/sharkdp/hexyl/issues/13) and [#164](https://github.com/sharkdp/hexyl/pull/164) (@sharifhsn)\n- Added new `--group-bytes`/`-g` option, see #104 and #170 (@RinHizakura)\n- Added new `--base B` option (where `B` can be `binary`, `octal`, `decimal` or `hexadecimal`), see #147 and #178 (@sharifhsn)\n- Show actual zero bytes as `⋄` in the character panel (previously: `0`), in order not to confuse them with ASCII\n  `0` bytes if colors are deactivated. Closes #166 (@sharkdp)\n\n## `hexyl` as a library\n\n- Breaking change: `Printer::new` is deprecated as a part of the public API. Alternatively, you can now construct a `Printer` using the `PrinterBuilder` builder API, see [#168](https://github.com/sharkdp/hexyl/pull/168). (@sharifhsn)\n\n## Other\n\n- More tests for the squeezing feature, see #177 (@mkatychev)\n\n## Thank you\n\nSpecial thanks go to @sharifhsn, not just for the new features,\nbugfixes and performance improvements. But also for many internal\nimprovements of the code base and other maintenance tasks.\n\n\n# v0.10.0\n\n## Features\n\n- Added new `--plain`, `--no-characters`, and `--no-position` flags, see #154 (@mkatychev)\n- Allow hex numbers and units for `--block-size` argument, see #111 and #144 (@merkrafter)\n\n## Other\n\n- Added a man page, see #151 (@sorairolake)\n- Mention ability to specify length in hex, see #143 (@merkrafter)\n- `--length` and `--bytes` are now marked as conflicting command-line options, see #152 (@sorairolake)\n\n\n# v0.9.0\n\n## Changes\n\n- Breaking change (binary): setting the `-o/--display-offset` flag no longer overrides the value set by `--skip` [#115](https://github.com/sharkdp/hexyl/issues/115). The first displayed address is now the sum of the two values - this matches the behaviour of `xxd`.\n\n## Features\n\n- Allow relative and negative byte offsets (e.g. `hexyl --skip=-1block`), see #99 (@ErichDonGubler)\n- Added `-l` as another alias for '-n/--length' (`xxd` compatibility), see #121 and #135 (@TheDoctor314)\n\n## Bugfixes\n\n- Argument `--length` silently takes precedence over `--bytes`, see #105\n- Print warning on empty content, see #107 and #108\n- Disallow block sizes of zero, see #110\n- Fix newline appearing in `--version` output, see #131 and #133 (@scimas)\n\n## Other\n\n- Better diagnostic messages, see #98 (@ErichDonGubler)\n\n## Packaging\n\n- `hexyl` is now available on snapstore, see #116 (@purveshpatel511)\n\n\n# v0.8.0\n\n## Features\n\n- A new `--skip <N>` / `-s <N>` option can be used to skip the first `N` bytes of the input, see #16, #88 (@Tarnadas, @MaxJohansen, @ErichDonGubler)\n- The `--length`/`--bytes`/`--skip`/`--display-offset` options can now take units for their value argument, for example:\n  ``` bash\n  hexyl /dev/random --length=1KiB\n  hexyl $(which hexyl) --skip=1MiB --length=10KiB\n  ```\n  Both decimal SI prefixes (kB, MB, …) as well as binary IEC prefixes (KiB, MiB, …) are supported.\n  In addition, there is a new `--block-size <SIZE>` option that can be used to control the size of the `block`\n  unit:\n  ``` bash\n  hexyl /dev/random --block-size=4kB --length=2block\n  ```\n  See: #44 (@ErichDonGubler and @aswild)\n\n## Other\n\n- Various improvements throughout the code base by @ErichDonGubler\n\n## Packaging\n\n- `hexyl` is now available on Void Linux, see #91 (@notramo)\n\n\n# v0.7.0\n\n## Bugfixes\n\n- hexyl can now be closed with `Ctrl-C` when reading input from STDIN, see #84\n\n## Changes\n\n- Breaking change (library): [`Printer::print_all`](https://docs.rs/hexyl/latest/hexyl/struct.Printer.html#method.print_all) does not take a second argument anymore.\n- Added an example on how to use `hexyl` as a library: https://github.com/sharkdp/hexyl/blob/v0.7.0/examples/simple.rs\n\n\n# v0.6.0\n\n## Features\n\n- `hexyl` can now be used as a library, see #67 (@tommilligan)\n\n- Added a new `-o`/`--display-offset` option to add a certain offset to the\n  reported file positions, see #57 (@tommilligan)\n\n## Bugfixes\n\n- Remove additional space on short input, see #69 (@nalshihabi)\n\n## Other\n\n- Performance improvements, see #73 and #66\n\n\n# v0.5.1\n\n## Bugfixes\n\n- A bug in the squeezing logic caused a wrong hexdump, see #62 (@awidegreen)\n- Some colors are printed even if they're disabled, see #64 (@awidegreen)\n- Fixed build failure on OpenBSD 6.5, see #61\n\n\n# v0.5.0\n\n## Features\n\n- Added support for squeezing where reoccurring lines are squashed together and visualized with an asterisk. A new `-v`/`--no-squeezing` option can be used to disable the feature. For details, see #59 (@awidegreen)\n- Added a new `--border` option with support for various styles (Unicode, ASCII, None), see #54 (@dmke)\n- The `--length`/`-n` argument can be passed as a hexadecimal number (`hexyl -n 0xff /dev/urandom`), see #45 (@Qyriad)\n- Added `--bytes`/`-c` as an alias for `--length`/`-n`, see #48 (@selfup)\n\n## Changes\n\n- Print header immediately before the first line, see #51 (@mziter)\n\n\n# v0.4.0\n\n## Features\n\n- Added a new `--color=always/auto/never` option which can be used\n  to control `hexyl`s color output, see #30 (@bennetthardwick)\n- Use 16 colors instead of 256, see #38\n\n## Changes\n\n- Various speed improvements, see #33 (@kballard)\n\n## Bugfixes\n\n- Proper Ctrl-C handling, see #35\n- Proper handling of broken pipes (`hexyl … | head`)\n\n\n# v0.3.1\n\n- Various (huge) performance improvements, see #23 and #24 (@kballard)\n- Replaced 24-bit truecolor ANSI codes by 8-bit codes to support\n  more terminal emulators, fixes #9\n\n\n# v0.3.0\n\nWindows support\n\n\n# v0.2.0\n\nInitial release\n"
