          "content": "# Building Sudo for Windows\n\nSudo for Windows is a Rust project. If you're new to Rust, you can get started with the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). You can quickly get started with rust by installing and running `rustup`:\n\n```cmd\nwinget install --id Rustlang.rustup --source winget\nrustup update\n```\n\n## Building\n\nRust is nice and straightforward. You can build sudo for the default architecture with a simple\n\n```\ncargo build\n```\n\nYou may want to specify a specific architecture. To do that, you'll want instead:\n\n```\ncargo build --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\n```\n\n(You can also use `i686-pc-windows-msvc` as the target).\n\n### Running tests\n\nAssuming that you passed a target architecture above:\n\n```\ncargo test --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\n```\n\nWe have additional manual tests that you can use to validate sudo in the\n`tools\\tests.ipynb` notebook.\n\n### Formatting and clippy\n\n```\ncargo fmt\ncargo clippy\n```\n\nIf your code passes a `cargo build && cargo test && cargo fmt && cargo clippy`, you're ready to send a PR.\n\n### Notes on building with the Microsoft internal toolchain\n\nWhen we're building this project internally, we need to use an internally-maintained fork of the rust toolchain. This toolchain needs to be used for all production work at Microsoft so we can stay compliant with Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL) requirements.\n\n**If you're external to Microsoft, this next section doesn't apply to you**. You\ncan use the standard Rust toolchain.\n\nFirst, install the internal `msrustup` toolchain to install the right version of\nall our Rust tools. You can get it from the https://aka.ms/msrustup-win. After\nthat installs, then you'll probably also need to run the following:\n\n```\nrustup default ms-stable\n```\n\nThat'll select the ms toolchain as the default. If you ever want to switch back, you can always just run\n\n```\nrustup default stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\n```\n\nAdditionally, we've got a separate fork of our `.cargo/config.toml` we need to use for internal builds. Notably, this includes `-Cehcont_guard` to enable EH Continuation Metadata. It also redirects cargo to use our own package feed for dependencies.\n\nYou can manually build with that config with:\n\n```\ncargo build --config .cargo\\ms-toolchain-config.toml\n```\n\nNote, if you run that on the public toolchain, you'll most definitely run into ``error: unknown codegen option: `ehcont_guard` `` when building.\n"

          "content": "# Sudo for Windows Contributor's Guide\r\n\r\nBelow is our guidance for how to report issues, propose new features, and submit\r\ncontributions via Pull Requests (PRs). Our philosophy is heavily based around\r\nunderstanding the problem and scenarios first, this is why we follow this\r\npattern before work has started.\r\n\r\n1. There is an issue\r\n2. There has been a conversation\r\n3. There is agreement on the problem, the fit for Sudo for Windows, and the\r\n   solution to the problem (implementation)\r\n\r\n## Filing an issue\r\n\r\nPlease follow this simple rule to help us eliminate any unnecessary wasted\r\neffort & frustration, and ensure an efficient and effective use of everyone's\r\ntime - yours, ours, and other community members':\r\n\r\n> 👉 If you have a question, think you've discovered an issue, would like to\r\n> propose a new feature, etc., then find/file an issue **BEFORE** starting work\r\n> to fix/implement it.\r\n\r\nWhen requesting new features / enhancements, understanding problem and scenario\r\naround it is extremely important. Having additional evidence, data, tweets, blog\r\nposts, research, ... anything is extremely helpful.  This information provides\r\ncontext to the scenario that may otherwise be lost.\r\n\r\n* Don't know whether you're reporting an issue or requesting a feature? **File an issue**\r\n* Have a question that you don't see answered in docs, videos, etc.? **File an issue**\r\n* Want to know if we're planning on building a particular feature? **File an issue**\r\n* Got a great idea for a new feature? **File an issue**\r\n* Don't understand how to do something? **File an issue**\r\n* Found an existing issue that describes yours? **Great!** upvote and add\r\n  additional commentary / info / repro-steps / etc.\r\n\r\nA quick search before filing an issue also could be helpful. It is likely\r\nsomeone else has found the problem you're seeing, and someone may be working on\r\nor have already contributed a fix!\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\n**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**\r\nInstead, please report them to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC).\r\nSee [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) for more information.\r\n\r\n### How to tell the Sudo team \"this is an interesting thing to focus on\"\r\n\r\nUpvote the original issue by clicking its [+😊] button and hitting 👍 (+1) icon\r\nor a different one. This way allows us to measure how impactful different issues\r\nare compared to others. The issue with comments like \"+1\", \"me too\", or similar\r\nis they actually make it harder to have a conversation and harder to quickly\r\ndetermine trending important requests.\r\n\r\n### Localization issues\r\n\r\nPlease file localization issues, so our internal localization team can identify\r\nand fix them. However we currently don't accept community Pull Requests fixing\r\nlocalization issues. Localization is handled by the internal Microsoft team\r\nonly.\r\n\r\n## Contributing code\r\n\r\nAs you might imagine, shipping something inside of Windows is a complicated\r\nprocess--doubly so for a security component. There is a lot of validation and\r\npaperwork that we don't really want to subject the community to. We want you to\r\nbe able to contribute easily and freely, and to let us deal with the paperwork.\r\nWe'll do our best to make sure this process is as seamless as possible.\r\n\r\nTo support the community in building new feature areas for Sudo for Windows,\r\nwe're going to make extensive use of feature flags, to conditionally add new\r\nfeatures to Sudo for Windows.\r\n\r\nWhen contributing to Sudo for Windows, we will treat \"bugfixes\" and \"features\"\r\nseparately. Bug fixes can be merged into the codebase freely, so long as they\r\ndon't majorly change existing behaviors. New features will need to have their\r\ncode guarded by feature flag checks before we can accept them as contributions.\r\n\r\nAs always, filing issues on the repo is the best way to have the team evaluate\r\nif the change you're proposing would be considered a \"bug fix\" or \"feature\"\r\nwork. We will indicate which is which using the `Issue-Bug` and\r\n`Issue-Feature`/`Issue-Task` labels. These labels are intended to be informative,\r\nand may change throughout the lifecycle of a discussion.\r\n\r\nWe'll be grouping sets of feature flags into different \"branding\"s throughout\r\nthe project. These brandings are as follows:\r\n* **\"Inbox\"**: These are features that are included in the version of sudo that\r\n  ships with Windows itself.\r\n* **\"Stable\"**: Features that ship in stable versions of sudo released here on\r\n  GitHub and on WinGet.\r\n* **\"Dev\"**: The least stable features, which are only built in local development\r\n  builds. These are for work-in-progress features, that aren't quite ready for\r\n  public consumption\r\n\r\nAll new features should be added under the \"Dev\" branding first. The core team\r\nwill then be responsible for moving those features into the appropriate branding\r\nas we get internal signoffs. This will allow features to be worked on\r\ncontinually in the open, while we slowly roll them into the OS product. We\r\nunfortunately cannot provide timelines for when features will be able to move\r\nfrom Stable into Inbox. Historical data showing that a feature has a track\r\nrecord of being stable and secure is a great way for us to justify any\r\nparticular feature's inclusion into the product.\r\n\r\nIf you're ready to jump in, head on over to [Building.md](./Building.md) to get\r\nstarted.\r\n\r\n## Repo Bot\r\n\r\nThe team triages new issues several times a week. During triage, the team uses\r\nlabels to categorize, manage, and drive the project workflow.\r\n\r\nWe employ a bot engine to help us automate common processes within our workflow.\r\n\r\nWe drive the bot by tagging issues with specific labels which cause the bot\r\nengine to close issues, merge branches, etc. This bot engine helps us keep the\r\nrepo clean by automating the process of notifying appropriate parties if/when\r\ninformation/follow-up is needed, and closing stale issues/PRs after reminders\r\nhave remained unanswered for several days.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if you do file issues, or create PRs, please keep an eye on your\r\nGitHub notifications. If you do not respond to requests for information, your\r\nissues/PRs may be closed automatically.\r\n\r\n## Thank you\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your contribution!\r\n\r\n[`sudo.ps1`]: ./scripts/sudo.ps1\r\n"

Sudo\r\nfor Windows allows users to run elevated commands directly from unelevated\r\nterminal windows.\r\n\r\nThe \"Inbox\" version of sudo is available for Windows 11 builds 26045 and later. If you're on an Insiders\r\nbuild with sudo, you can enable it in the Windows Settings app, on the\r\n\"Developer Features\" page.\r\n\r\nHere you can report issues and file feature requests.\r\n\r\n## Relationship to `sudo` on Unix/Linux\r\n\r\nEverything about permissions and the command line experience is\r\ndifferent between Windows and Linux. This project is not a fork of the Unix/Linux\r\n`sudo` project, nor is it a port of that `sudo` project. Instead, Sudo for\r\nWindows is a Windows-specific implementation of the `sudo` concept.\r\n\r\nAs the two are entirely different applications, you'll find that certain\r\nelements of the traditional `sudo` experience are not present in Sudo for Windows, and\r\nvice versa. Scripts and documentation that are written for `sudo` may not\r\nbe able to be used directly with Sudo for Windows without some modification.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nAll project documentation is located at\r\n[aka.ms/sudo-docs][sudo-docs]. If you would like to contribute to\r\nthe documentation, please submit a pull request on the [Sudo for Windows\r\nDocumentation repo][documentation-repo].\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nCheck out [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/microsoft/sudo/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to contribute to this project.\r\n\r\n### `sudo.ps1`\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, you can contribute to the [`sudo.ps1`] script. This script is\r\nmeant to be a helper wrapper around `sudo.exe` that provides a more\r\nuser-friendly experience for using sudo from PowerShell. This script is located\r\nin the `scripts/` directory.\r\n\r\n## Communicating with the Team\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to communicate with the team is via GitHub issues.\r\n\r\nPlease file new issues, feature requests and suggestions, but **DO search for\r\nsimilar open/closed preexisting issues before creating a new issue.**\r\n\r\nIf you would like to ask a question that you feel doesn't warrant an issue\r\n(yet), try a [discussion thread][discussions]. Those are especially helpful for question &\r\nanswer threads. Otherwise, you can reach out to us via your social media\r\nplatform of choice:\r\n\r\n* Mike Griese, Senior Developer: [@zadjii@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@zadjii)\r\n* Jordi Adoumie, Product Manager: [@joadoumie](https://twitter.com/joadoumie)\r\n* Dustin Howett, Engineering Lead: [@dhowett@mas.to](https://mas.to/@DHowett)\r\n* Clint Rutkas, Lead Product Manager: [@crutkas](https://twitter.com/clintrutkas)\r\n\r\n## Code of Conduct\r\n\r\nThis project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of\r\nConduct][conduct-code].
