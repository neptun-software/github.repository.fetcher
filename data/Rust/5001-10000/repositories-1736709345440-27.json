They will be listed here, along with the updates needed for your projects.\n\nIf you need a stable Foundry version, we recommend using the latest pinned nightly of May 2nd, locally and on your CI.\n\nTo use the latest pinned nightly locally, use the following command:\n\n```\nfoundryup --version nightly-e15e33a07c0920189fc336391f538c3dad53da73\n````\n\nTo use the latest pinned nightly on your CI, modify your Foundry installation step to use an specific version:\n\n```\n- name: Install Foundry\n  uses: foundry-rs/foundry-toolchain@v1\n  with:\n    version: nightly-e15e33a07c0920189fc336391f538c3dad53da73\n```\n\n### Breaking changes\n\n- [expectEmit](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/4920) will now only work for the next call.\n- expectCall will now only work if the call(s) are made exactly after the cheatcode is invoked.\n- [expectRevert will now work if the next call does revert](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/4945), instead of expecting a revert during the whole test.\n  - This will very likely break your tests. Please make sure that all the calls you expect to revert are external, and if not, abstract them into a separate contract so that they can be called externally and the cheatcode can be used.\n- `-m`, the deprecated alias for `--mt` or `--match-test`, has now been removed.\n- [startPrank will now override the existing prank instead of erroring](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/4826).\n- [precompiles will not be compatible with all cheatcodes](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/4905).\n- The difficulty and prevrandao cheatcodes now [fail if not used with the correct EVM version](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/4904).\n- The default EVM version will be Shanghai. If you're using an EVM chain which is not compatible with [EIP-3855](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3855) you need to change your EVM version. See [Matt Solomon's thread](https://twitter.com/msolomon44/status/1656411871635972096) for more information.\n- Non-existent JSON keys are now processed correctly, and `parseJson` returns non-decodable empty bytes if they do not exist. https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/5511\n"

          "content": "## Contributing to Foundry\n\nThanks for your interest in improving Foundry!\n\nThere are multiple opportunities to contribute at any level. It doesn't matter if you are just getting started with Rust or are the most weathered expert, we can use your help.\n\nThis document will help you get started. **Do not let the document intimidate you**.\nIt should be considered as a guide to help you navigate the process.\n\nThe [dev Telegram][dev-tg] is available for any concerns you may have that are not covered in this guide.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\nThe Foundry project adheres to the [Rust Code of Conduct][rust-coc]. This code of conduct describes the _minimum_ behavior expected from all contributors.\n\nInstances of violations of the Code of Conduct can be reported by contacting the team at [me@gakonst.com](mailto:me@gakonst.com).\n\n### Ways to contribute\n\nThere are fundamentally four ways an individual can contribute:\n\n1. **By opening an issue:** For example, if you believe that you have uncovered a bug\n   in Foundry, creating a new issue in the issue tracker is the way to report it.\n2. **By adding context:** Providing additional context to existing issues,\n   such as screenshots and code snippets, which help resolve issues.\n3. **By resolving issues:** Typically this is done in the form of either\n   demonstrating that the issue reported is not a problem after all, or more often,\n   by opening a pull request that fixes the underlying problem, in a concrete and\n   reviewable manner.\n\n**Anybody can participate in any stage of contribution**. We urge you to participate in the discussion\naround bugs and participate in reviewing PRs.\n\n### Contributions Related to Spelling and Grammar\n\nAt this time, we will not be accepting contributions that only fix spelling or grammatical errors in documentation, code or\nelsewhere.\n\n### Asking for help\n\nIf you have reviewed existing documentation and still have questions, or you are having problems, you can get help in the following ways:\n\n-   **Asking in the support Telegram:** The [Foundry Support Telegram][support-tg] is a fast and easy way to ask questions.\n-   **Opening a discussion:** This repository comes with a discussions board where you can also ask for help. Click the \"Discussions\" tab at the top.\n\nAs Foundry is still in heavy development, the documentation can be a bit scattered.\nThe [Foundry Book][foundry-book] is our current best-effort attempt at keeping up-to-date information.\n\n### Submitting a bug report\n\nWhen filing a new bug report in the issue tracker, you will be presented with a basic form to fill out.\n\nIf you believe that you have uncovered a bug, please fill out the form to the best of your ability. Do not worry if you cannot answer every detail; just fill in what you can. Contributors will ask follow-up questions if something is unclear.\n\nThe most important pieces of information we need in a bug report are:\n\n-   The Foundry version you are on (and that it is up to date)\n-   The platform you are on (Windows, macOS, an M1 Mac or Linux)\n-   Code snippets if this is happening in relation to testing or building code\n-   Concrete steps to reproduce the bug\n\nIn order to rule out the possibility of the bug being in your project, the code snippets should be as minimal\nas possible. It is better if you can reproduce the bug with a small snippet as opposed to an entire project!\n\nSee [this guide][mcve] on how to create a minimal, complete, and verifiable example.\n\n### Submitting a feature request\n\nWhen adding a feature request in the issue tracker, you will be presented with a basic form to fill out.\n\nPlease include as detailed of an explanation as possible of the feature you would like, adding additional context if necessary.\n\nIf you have examples of other tools that have the feature you are requesting, please include them as well.\n\n### Resolving an issue\n\nPull requests are the way concrete changes are made to the code, documentation, and dependencies of Foundry.\n\nEven minor pull requests, such as those fixing wording, are greatly appreciated. Before making a large change, it is usually\na good idea to first open an issue describing the change to solicit feedback and guidance. This will increase\nthe likelihood of the PR getting merged.\n\nPlease also make sure that the following commands pass if you have changed the code:\n\n```sh\ncargo check --all\ncargo test --all --all-features\ncargo +nightly fmt -- --check\ncargo +nightly clippy --all --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings\n```\n\nIf you are working in VSCode, we recommend you install the [rust-analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/) extension, and use the following VSCode user settings:\n\n```json\n\"editor.formatOnSave\": true,\n\"rust-analyzer.rustfmt.extraArgs\": [\"+nightly\"],\n\"[rust]\": {\n  \"editor.defaultFormatter\": \"rust-lang.rust-analyzer\"\n}\n```\n\nIf you are working on a larger feature, we encourage you to open up a draft pull request, to make sure that other contributors are not duplicating work.\n\nIf you would like to test the binaries built from your change, see [foundryup](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/foundryup).\n\nIf you would like to use a debugger with breakpoints to debug a patch you might be working on, keep in mind we currently strip debug info for faster builds, which is *not* the default. Therefore, to use a debugger, you need to enable it on the workspace [`Cargo.toml`'s `dev` profile](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/Cargo.toml#L15-L18).\n\n#### Adding tests\n\nIf the change being proposed alters code, it is either adding new functionality to Foundry, or fixing existing, broken functionality.\nIn both of these cases, the pull request should include one or more tests to ensure that Foundry does not regress\nin the future.\n\nTypes of tests include:\n\n-   **Unit tests**: Functions which have very specific tasks should be unit tested.\n-   **Integration tests**: For general purpose, far reaching functionality, integration tests should be added.\n    The best way to add a new integration test is to look at existing ones and follow the style.\n\nTests that use forking must contain \"fork\" in their name.\n\n#### Commits\n\nIt is a recommended best practice to keep your changes as logically grouped as possible within individual commits. There is no limit to the number of commits any single pull request may have, and many contributors find it easier to review changes that are split across multiple commits.\n\nThat said, if you have a number of commits that are \"checkpoints\" and don't represent a single logical change, please squash those together.\n\n#### Opening the pull request\n\nFrom within GitHub, opening a new pull request will present you with a template that should be filled out. Please try your best at filling out the details, but feel free to skip parts if you're not sure what to put.\n\n#### Discuss and update\n\nYou will probably get feedback or requests for changes to your pull request.\nThis is a big part of the submission process, so don't be discouraged! Some contributors may sign off on the pull request right away, others may have more detailed comments or feedback.\nThis is a necessary part of the process in order to evaluate whether the changes are correct and necessary.\n\n**Any community member can review a PR, so you might get conflicting feedback**.\nKeep an eye out for comments from code owners to provide guidance on conflicting feedback.\n\n#### Reviewing pull requests\n\n**Any Foundry community member is welcome to review any pull request**.\n\nAll contributors who choose to review and provide feedback on pull requests have a responsibility to both the project and individual making the contribution. Reviews and feedback must be helpful, insightful, and geared towards improving the contribution as opposed to simply blocking it. If there are reasons why you feel the PR should not be merged, explain what those are. Do not expect to be able to block a PR from advancing simply because you say \"no\" without giving an explanation. Be open to having your mind changed. Be open to working _with_ the contributor to make the pull request better.\n\nReviews that are dismissive or disrespectful of the contributor or any other reviewers are strictly counter to the Code of Conduct.\n\nWhen reviewing a pull request, the primary goals are for the codebase to improve and for the person submitting the request to succeed. **Even if a pull request is not merged, the submitter should come away from the experience feeling like their effort was not unappreciated**. Every PR from a new contributor is an opportunity to grow the community.\n\n##### Review a bit at a time\n\nDo not overwhelm new contributors.\n\nIt is tempting to micro-optimize and make everything about relative performance, perfect grammar, or exact style matches. Do not succumb to that temptation..\n\nFocus first on the most significant aspects of the change:\n\n1. Does this change make sense for Foundry?\n2. Does this change make Foundry better, even if only incrementally?\n3. Are there clear bugs or larger scale issues that need attending?\n4. Are the commit messages readable and correct? If it contains a breaking change, is it clear enough?\n\nNote that only **incremental** improvement is needed to land a PR. This means that the PR does not need to be perfect, only better than the status quo. Follow-up PRs may be opened to continue iterating.\n\nWhen changes are necessary, _request_ them, do not _demand_ them, and **do not assume that the submitter already knows how to add a test or run a benchmark**.\n\nSpecific performance optimization techniques, coding styles and conventions change over time. The first impression you give to a new contributor never does.\n\nNits (requests for small changes that are not essential) are fine, but try to avoid stalling the pull request. Most nits can typically be fixed by the Foundry maintainers merging the pull request, but they can also be an opportunity for the contributor to learn a bit more about the project.\n\nIt is always good to clearly indicate nits when you comment, e.g.: `Nit: change foo() to bar(). But this is not blocking`.\n\nIf your comments were addressed but were not folded after new commits, or if they proved to be mistaken, please, [hide them][hiding-a-comment] with the appropriate reason to keep the conversation flow concise and relevant.\n\n##### Be aware of the person behind the code\n\nBe aware that _how_ you communicate requests and reviews in your feedback can have a significant impact on the success of the pull request. Yes, we may merge a particular change that makes Foundry better, but the individual might just not want to have anything to do with Foundry ever again. The goal is not just having good code.\n\n##### Abandoned or stale pull requests\n\nIf a pull request appears to be abandoned or stalled, it is polite to first check with the contributor to see if they intend to continue the work before checking if they would mind if you took it over (especially if it just has nits left). When doing so, it is courteous to give the original contributor credit for the work they started, either by preserving their name and e-mail address in the commit log, or by using the `Author: ` or `Co-authored-by: ` metadata tag in the commits.\n\n_Adapted from the [ethers-rs contributing guide](https://github.com/gakonst/ethers-rs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)_.\n\n### Releasing\n\nReleases are automatically done by the release workflow when a tag is pushed, however, these steps still need to be taken:\n\n1. Ensure that the versions in the relevant `Cargo.toml` files are up-to-date.\n2. Update documentation links\n3. Perform a final audit for breaking changes.\n\n[rust-coc]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\n[dev-tg]: https://t.me/foundry_rs\n[foundry-book]: https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry-book\n[support-tg]: https://t.me/foundry_support\n[mcve]: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\n[hiding-a-comment]: https://help.github.com/articles/managing-disruptive-comments/#hiding-a-comment\n"

Read the [📖 Foundry Book][foundry-book] (WIP)!**\n\n![Demo](.github/demo.gif)\n\n## Installation\n\nSee the [installation guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) in the book.\n\nIf you're experiencing any issues while installing, check out [Getting Help](#getting-help) and the [FAQ](https://book.getfoundry.sh/faq).\n\n## Forge\n\n### Features\n\n-   **Fast & flexible compilation pipeline**\n    -   Automatic Solidity compiler version detection & installation\n    -   **Incremental compilation & caching**: Only changed files are re-compiled\n    -   Parallel compilation\n    -   Non-standard directory structures support (e.g. [Hardhat repos](https://twitter.com/gakonst/status/1461289225337421829))\n-   **Tests are written in Solidity** (like in DappTools)\n-   **Fast fuzz testing** with shrinking of inputs & printing of counter-examples\n-   **Fast remote RPC forking mode**, leveraging Rust's async infrastructure like tokio\n-   **Flexible debug logging**\n    -   DappTools-style, using `DsTest`'s emitted logs\n    -   Hardhat-style, using the popular `console.sol` contract\n-   **Portable (5-10MB) & easy to install** without requiring Nix or any other package manager\n-   **Fast CI** with the [Foundry GitHub action][foundry-gha].\n\n### How Fast?\n\nForge is quite fast at both compiling (leveraging [foundry-compilers]) and testing.\n\nSee the benchmarks below. More benchmarks can be found in the [v0.2.0 announcement post][benchmark-post] and in the [Convex Shutdown Simulation][convex] repository.\n\n**Testing Benchmarks**\n\n| Project                            | Forge | DappTools | Speedup |\n| ---------------------------------- | ----- | --------- | ------- |\n| [transmissions11/solmate][solmate] | 2.8s  | 6m34s     | 140x    |\n| [reflexer-labs/geb][geb]           | 0.4s  | 23s       | 57.5x   |\n| [Rari-Capital/vaults][vaults]      | 0.28s | 6.5s      | 23x     |\n\n_Note: In the above benchmarks, compilation was always skipped_\n\n**Compilation Benchmarks**\n\n<img alt=\"Compilation benchmarks\" src=\".github/compilation-benchmark.png\" width=\"693px\" />\n\n**Takeaway: Forge compilation is consistently faster by a factor of 1.7-11.3x, depending on the amount of caching involved.**\n\n## Cast\n\nCast is a swiss army knife for interacting with Ethereum applications from the command line.\n\nMore documentation can be found in the [cast package](./crates/cast).\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Using `foundry.toml`\n\nFoundry is designed to be very configurable. You can configure Foundry using a file called [`foundry.toml`](./crates/config) in the root of your project, or any other parent directory. See [config package](./crates/config/README.md#all-options) for all available options.\n\nConfiguration can be arbitrarily namespaced by profiles. The default profile is named `default` (see [\"Default Profile\"](./crates/config/README.md#default-profile)).\n\nYou can select another profile using the `FOUNDRY_PROFILE` environment variable. You can also override parts of your configuration using `FOUNDRY_` or `DAPP_` prefixed environment variables, like `FOUNDRY_SRC`.\n\n`forge init` creates a basic, extendable `foundry.toml` file.\n\nTo see your current configuration, run `forge config`. To see only basic options (as set with `forge init`), run `forge config --basic`. This can be used to create a new `foundry.toml` file with `forge config --basic > foundry.toml`.\n\nBy default `forge config` shows the currently selected foundry profile and its values. It also accepts the same arguments as `forge build`.\n\n### DappTools Compatibility\n\nYou can reuse your `.dapprc` environment variables by running `source .dapprc` before using a Foundry tool.\n\n### Additional Configuration\n\nYou can find additional setup and configurations guides in the [Foundry Book][foundry-book]:\n\n-   [Setting up VSCode][vscode-setup]\n-   [Shell autocompletions][shell-setup]\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee our [contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Getting Help\n\nFirst, see if the answer to your question can be found in [book][foundry-book], or in the relevant crate.\n\nIf the answer is not there:\n\n-   Join the [support Telegram][tg-support-url] to get help, or\n-   Open a [discussion](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/discussions/new) with your question, or\n-   Open an issue with [the bug](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/issues/new)\n\nIf you want to contribute, or follow along with contributor discussion, you can use our [main telegram](https://t.me/foundry_rs) to chat with us about the development of Foundry!\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n-   Foundry is a clean-room rewrite of the testing framework [DappTools](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools). None of this would have been possible without the DappHub team's work over the years.\n-   [Matthias Seitz](https://twitter.com/mattsse_): Created [ethers-solc] (now [foundry-compilers]) which is the backbone of our compilation pipeline, as well as countless contributions to ethers, in particular the `abigen` macros.\n-   [Rohit Narurkar](https://twitter.com/rohitnarurkar): Created the Rust Solidity version manager [svm-rs](https://github.com/roynalnaruto/svm-rs) which we use to auto-detect and manage multiple Solidity versions.\n-   [Brock Elmore](https://twitter.com/brockjelmore): For extending the VM's cheatcodes and implementing [structured call tracing](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/pull/192), a critical feature for debugging smart contract calls.\n-   All the other [contributors](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/graphs/contributors) to the [ethers-rs](https://github.com/gakonst/ethers-rs) & [foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) repositories and chatrooms.\n\n[foundry-book]: https://book.getfoundry.sh\n[foundry-gha]: https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry-toolchain\n[ethers-solc]: https://github.com/gakonst/ethers-rs/tree/master/ethers-solc/\n[foundry-compilers]: https://github.com/foundry-rs/compilers\n[solmate]: https://github.com/transmissions11/solmate/\n[geb]: https://github.com/reflexer-labs/geb\n[vaults]: https://github.com/rari-capital/vaults\n[benchmark-post]: https://www.paradigm.xyz/2022/03/foundry-02#blazing-fast-compilation--testing\n[convex]: https://github.com/mds1/convex-shutdown-simulation\n[vscode-setup]: https://book.getfoundry.sh/config/vscode.html\n[shell-setup]: https://book.getfoundry.sh/config/shell-autocompletion.html\n"
