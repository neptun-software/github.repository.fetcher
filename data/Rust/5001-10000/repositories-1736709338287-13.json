This document gives some guidance if you\nare thinking of helping us.\n\n## Submitting bug reports and feature requests\n\nSerde development is spread across lots of repositories, but this serde-rs/serde\nrepository is always a safe choice for opening any issues related to Serde.\n\nWhen reporting a bug or asking for help, please include enough details so that\nthe people helping you can reproduce the behavior you are seeing. For some tips\non how to approach this, read about how to produce a [Minimal, Complete, and\nVerifiable example].\n\n[Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example]: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\n\nWhen making a feature request, please make it clear what problem you intend to\nsolve with the feature, any ideas for how Serde could support solving that\nproblem, any possible alternatives, and any disadvantages.\n\n## Running the test suite\n\nWe encourage you to check that the test suite passes locally before submitting a\npull request with your changes. If anything does not pass, typically it will be\neasier to iterate and fix it locally than waiting for the CI servers to run\ntests for you.\n\n##### In the [`serde`] directory\n\n```sh\n# Test all the example code in Serde documentation\ncargo test --features derive\n```\n\n##### In the [`test_suite`] directory\n\n```sh\n# Run the full test suite, including tests of unstable functionality\ncargo +nightly test --features unstable\n```\n\nNote that this test suite currently only supports running on a nightly compiler.\n\n[`serde`]: https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/tree/master/serde\n[`test_suite`]: https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/tree/master/test_suite\n\n## Conduct\n\nIn all Serde-related forums, we follow the [Rust Code of Conduct]. For\nescalation or moderation issues please contact Erick (erick.tryzelaar@gmail.com)\ninstead of the Rust moderation team.\n\n[Rust Code of Conduct]: https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct\n"
