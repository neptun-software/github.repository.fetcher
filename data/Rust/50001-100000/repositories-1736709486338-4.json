In comparison with `/fuel/req/0.0.1`, which returns an empty response when a request cannot be fulfilled, this version returns more meaningful error codes. Nodes still support the version `0.0.1` of the protocol to guarantee backward compatibility with fuel-core nodes. Empty responses received from nodes using the old protocol `/fuel/req/0.0.1` are automatically converted into an error `ProtocolV1EmptyResponse` with error code 0, which is also the only error code implemented. More specific error codes will be added in the future.\n- [2386](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2386): Add a flag to define the maximum number of file descriptors that RocksDB can use. By default it's half of the OS limit.\n- [2376](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2376): Add a way to fetch transactions in P2P without specifying a peer.\n- [2361](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2361): Add caches to the sync service to not reask for data it already fetched from the network.\n- [2327](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2327): Add more services tests and more checks of the pool. Also add an high level documentation for users of the pool and contributors.\n- [2416](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/2416): Define the `GasPriceServiceV1` task.\n- [2447](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2447): Use new `expiration` policy in the transaction pool. Add a mechanism to prune the transactions when they expired.\n- [1922](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1922): Added support for posting blocks to the shared sequencer.\n- [2033](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2033): Remove `Option<BlockHeight>` in favor of `BlockHeightQuery` where applicable.\n- [2439](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2439): Add gas costs for the two new zk opcodes `ecop` and `eadd` and the benches that allow to calibrate them.\n- [2472](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2472): Added the `amountU128` field to the `Balance` GraphQL schema, providing the total balance as a `U128`. The existing `amount` field clamps any balance exceeding `U64` to `u64::MAX`.\n- [2526](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2526): Add possibility to not have any cache set for RocksDB. Add an option to either load the RocksDB columns families on creation of the database or when the column is used.\n- [2532](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2532): Getters for inner rocksdb database handles.\n\n### Fixed\n- [2365](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2365): Fixed the error during dry run in the case of race condition.\n- [2366](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2366): The `importer_gas_price_for_block` metric is properly collected.\n- [2369](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2369): The `transaction_insertion_time_in_thread_pool_milliseconds` metric is properly collected.\n- [2413](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/2413): block production immediately errors if unable to lock the mutex.\n- [2389](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2389): Fix construction of reverse iterator in RocksDB.\n- [2479](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2479): Fix an error on the last iteration of the read and write sequential opcodes on contract storage.\n- [2478](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2478): Fix proof created by `message_receipts_proof` function by ignoring the receipts from failed transactions to match `message_outbox_root`.\n- [2485](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2485): Hardcode the timestamp of the genesis block and version of `tai64` to avoid breaking changes for us.\n- [2511](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2511): Fix backward compatibility of V0Metadata in gas price db.\n\n### Changed\n- [2501](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2501): Use gas price from block for estimating future gas prices\n- [2468](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2468): Abstract unrecorded blocks concept for V1 algorithm, create new storage impl.

The errors supported are `ProtocolV1EmptyResponse` (status code `0`) for converting empty responses sent via protocol `/fuel/req_res/0.0.1`, `RequestedRangeTooLarge`(status code `1`) if the client requests a range of objects such as sealed block headers or transactions too large, `Timeout` (status code `2`) if the remote peer takes too long to fulfill a request, or `SyncProcessorOutOfCapacity` if the remote peer is fulfilling too many requests concurrently.\n- [2233](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2233): Introduce a new column `modification_history_v2` for storing the modification history in the historical rocksDB. Keys in this column are stored in big endian order. Changed the behaviour of the historical rocksDB to write changes for new block heights to the new column, and to perform lookup of values from the `modification_history_v2` table first, and then from the `modification_history` table, performing a migration upon access if necessary.\n\n#### Breaking\n- [2438](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2438): The `fuel-core-client` can only work with new version of the `fuel-core`. The `0.40` and all older versions are not supported.\n- [2438](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2438): Updated `fuel-vm` to `0.59.1` release. Check [release notes](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/releases/tag/v0.59.0) for more details.\n- [2389](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2258): Updated the `messageProof` GraphQL schema to return a non-nullable `MessageProof`.\n- [2154](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2154): Transaction graphql endpoints use `TransactionType` instead of `fuel_tx::Transaction`.\n- [2446](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2446): Use graphiql instead of graphql-playground due to known vulnerability and stale development.\n- [2379](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/2379): Change `kv_store::Value` to be `Arc<[u8]>` instead of `Arc<Vec<u8>>`.\n- [2526](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2526): By default the cache of RocksDB is now disabled instead of being `1024 * 1024 * 1024`.\n\n## [Version 0.40.2]\n\n### Fixed\n\n- [2476](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2476): Hardcode the timestamp of the genesis block.\n\n## [Version 0.40.1]\n\n### Added\n\n- [2450](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2450): Added support for posting blocks to the shared sequencer.\n\n## [Version 0.40.0]\n\n### Added\n- [2347](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2347): Add GraphQL complexity histogram to metrics.\n- [2350](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2350): Added a new CLI flag `graphql-number-of-threads` to limit the number of threads used by the GraphQL service.

More information in the [release](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/releases/tag/v0.58.0).\n- [2276](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2276): Changed how complexity for blocks is calculated. The default complexity now is 80_000. All queries that somehow touch the block header now are more expensive.\n- [2290](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2290): Added a new GraphQL limit on number of `directives`.

It removes block serialization and deserialization and should improve performance.\n  - Added a V1 execution result type that uses `JSONError` instead of postcard serialized error. It adds flexibility of how variants of the error can be managed. More information about it in https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/issues/797. The change also moves `TooManyOutputs` error to the top. It shows that `JSONError` works as expected.\n- [2145](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2145): feat: Introduce time port in PoA service.\n- [2155](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2155): Added trait declaration for block committer data\n- [2142](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2142): Added benchmarks for varied forms of db lookups to assist in optimizations.\n- [2158](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2158): Log the public address of the signing key, if it is specified\n- [2188](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2188): Upgraded the `fuel-vm` to `0.57.0`. More information in the [release](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/releases/tag/v0.57.0).\n\n## [Version 0.35.0]\n\n### Added\n- [2122](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2122): Changed the relayer URI address to be a vector and use a quorum provider. The `relayer` argument now supports multiple URLs to fetch information from different sources.\n- [2119](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2119): GraphQL query fields for retrieving information about upgrades.\n\n### Changed\n- [2113](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2113): Modify the way the gas price service and shared algo is initialized to have some default value based on best guess instead of `None`, and initialize service before graphql.\n- [2112](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2112): Alter the way the sealed blocks are fetched with a given height.\n- [2120](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2120): Added `submitAndAwaitStatus` subscription endpoint which returns the `SubmittedStatus` after the transaction is submitted as well as the `TransactionStatus` subscription.\n- [2115](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2115): Add test for `SignMode` `is_available` method.\n- [2124](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2124): Generalize the way p2p req/res protocol handles requests.\n\n#### Breaking\n\n- [2040](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2040): Added full `no_std` support state transition related crates. The crates now require the \"alloc\" feature to be enabled. Following crates are affected:\n  - `fuel-core-types`\n  - `fuel-core-storage`\n  - `fuel-core-executor`\n- [2116](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2116): Replace `H160` in config and cli options of relayer by `Bytes20` of `fuel-types`\n\n### Fixed\n- [2134](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2134): Perform RecoveryID normalization for AWS KMS -generated signatures.\n\n## [Version 0.34.0]\n\n### Added\n- [2051](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2051): Add support for AWS KMS signing for the PoA consensus module. The new key can be specified with `--consensus-aws-kms AWS_KEY_ARN`.\n- [2092](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2092): Allow iterating by keys in rocksdb, and other storages.\n- [2096](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2096): GraphQL query field to fetch blob byte code by its blob ID.\n\n### Changed\n- [2106](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2106): Remove deadline clock in POA and replace with tokio time functions.\n\n- [2035](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/2035): Small code optimizations.\n    - The optimized code specifies the capacity when initializing the HashSet, avoiding potential multiple reallocations of memory during element insertion.\n    - The optimized code uses the return value of HashSet::insert to check if the insertion was successful.

It guarantees the state transition's availability for the network's first blocks.\n    The change has many minor improvements in different areas related to the state transition bytecode:\n    - The state transition bytecode lies in its own file(`state_transition_bytecode.wasm`) along with the chain config file. The `ChainConfig` loads it automatically when `ChainConfig::load` is called and pushes it back when `ChainConfig::write` is called.\n    - The `fuel-core` release bundle also contains the `fuel-core-wasm-executor.wasm` file of the corresponding executor version.\n    - The regenesis process now considers the last block produced by the previous network. When we create a (re)genesis block of a new network, it has the `height = last_block_of_old_network + 1`. It continues the old network and doesn't overlap blocks(before, we had `old_block.height == new_genesis_block.height`).\n    - Along with the new block height, the regenesis process also increases the state transition bytecode and consensus parameters versions. It guarantees that a new network doesn't use values from the previous network and allows us not to migrate `StateTransitionBytecodeVersions` and `ConsensusParametersVersions` tables.\n    - Added a new CLI argument, `native-executor-version,` that allows overriding of the default version of the native executor. It can be useful for side rollups that have their own history of executor upgrades.\n    - Replaced:\n      \n      ```rust\n               let file = std::fs::File::open(path)?;\n               let mut snapshot: Self = serde_json::from_reader(&file)?;\n      ```\n      \n      with a:\n      \n      ```rust\n               let mut json = String::new();\n               std::fs::File::open(&path)\n                   .with_context(|| format!(\"Could not open snapshot file: {path:?}\"))?\n                   .read_to_string(&mut json)?;\n               let mut snapshot: Self = serde_json::from_str(json.as_str())?;\n      ```\n      because it is 100 times faster for big JSON files.\n    - Updated all tests to use `Config::local_node_*` instead of working with the `SnapshotReader` directly. It is the preparation of the tests for the futures bumps of the `Executor::VERSION`. When we increase the version, all tests continue to use `GenesisBlock.state_transition_bytecode = 0` while the version is different, which forces the usage of the WASM executor, while for tests, we still prefer to test native execution. The `Config::local_node_*` handles it and forces the executor to use the native version.\n    - Reworked the `build.rs` file of the upgradable executor. The script now caches WASM bytecode to avoid recompilation. Also, fixed the issue with outdated WASM bytecode. The script reacts on any modifications of the `fuel-core-wasm-executor` and forces recompilation (it is why we need the cache), so WASM bytecode always is actual now.\n- [#1822](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1822): Removed support of `Create` transaction from debugger since it doesn't have any script to execute.\n- [#1822](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1822): Use `fuel-vm 0.49.0` with new transactions types - `Upgrade` and `Upload`. Also added `max_bytecode_subsections` field to the `ConsensusParameters` to limit the number of bytecode subsections in the state transition bytecode. \n- [#1816](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1816): Updated the upgradable executor to fetch the state transition bytecode from the database when the version doesn't match a native one. This change enables the WASM executor in the \"production\" build and requires a `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target.\n\n## [Version 0.24.2]\n\n### Changed\n\n#### Breaking\n- [#1798](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1798): Add nonce to relayed transactions and also hash full messages in the inbox root.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- [#1802](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1802): Fixed a runtime panic that occurred when restarting a node.

Because of some breaking changes, we also adapted our codebase to follow them: \n  - Implementation of `Default` for configs was moved under the `test-helpers` feature. The `fuel-core` binary uses testnet configuration instead of `Default::default`(for cases when `ChainConfig` was not provided by the user).\n  - All parameter types are enums now and require corresponding modifications across the codebase(we need to use getters and setters). The GraphQL API remains the same for simplicity, but each parameter now has one more field - `version`, that can be used to decide how to deserialize. \n  - The `UtxoId` type now is 34 bytes instead of 33. It affects hex representation and requires adding `00`.\n  - The `block_gas_limit` was moved to `ConsensusParameters` from `ChainConfig`. It means the block producer doesn't specify the block gas limit anymore, and we don't need to propagate this information.\n  - The `bytecodeLength` field is removed from the `Create` transaction.\n  - Removed `ConsensusParameters` from executor config because `ConsensusParameters::default` is not available anymore. Instead, executors fetch `ConsensusParameters` from the database.\n\n- [#1769](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1769): Include new field on header for the merkle root of imported events.

The corresponding [issue](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/1589) described the reason behind it.\n\n    ## Technical details of implementation\n\n    - The change splits the `KeyValueStore` into `KeyValueInspect` and `KeyValueMutate`, as well the `Blueprint` into `BlueprintInspect` and `BlueprintMutate`. It allows requiring less restricted constraints for any read-related operations.\n\n    - One of the main ideas of the change is to allow for the actual storage only to implement `KeyValueInspect` and `Modifiable` without the `KeyValueMutate`. It simplifies work with the databases and provides a safe way of interacting with them (Modification into the database can only go through the `Modifiable::commit_changes`). This feature is used to [track the height](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1694/files#diff-c95a3d57a39feac7c8c2f3b193a24eec39e794413adc741df36450f9a4539898) of each database during commits and even limit how commits are done, providing additional safety. This part of the change was done as a [separate commit](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1694/commits/7b1141ac838568e3590f09dd420cb24a6946bd32).\n    \n    - The `StorageTransaction` is a `StructuredStorage` that uses `InMemoryTransaction` inside to accumulate modifications. Only `InMemoryTransaction` has a real implementation of the `KeyValueMutate`(Other types only implement it in tests).\n    \n    - The implementation of the `Modifiable` for the `Database` contains a business logic that provides additional safety but limits the usage of the database. The `Database` now tracks its height and is responsible for its updates. In the `commit_changes` function, it analyzes the changes that were done and tries to find a new height(For example, in the case of the `OnChain` database, we are looking for a new `Block` in the `FuelBlocks` table).\n    \n    - As was planned in the issue, now the executor has full control over how commits to the storage are done.\n    \n    - All mutation methods now require `&mut self` - exclusive ownership over the object to be able to write into it. It almost negates the chance of concurrent modification of the storage, but it is still possible since the `Database` implements the `Clone` trait. To be sure that we don't corrupt the state of the database, the `commit_changes` function implements additional safety checks to be sure that we commit updates per each height only once time.\n\n    - Side changes:\n      - The `drop` function was moved from `Database` to `RocksDB` as a preparation for the state rewind since the read view should also keep the drop function until it is destroyed.\n      - The `StatisticTable` table lives in the off-chain worker.\n      - Removed duplication of the `Database` from the `dap::ConcreteStorage` since it is already available from the VM.\n      - The executor return only produced `Changes` instead of the storage transaction, which simplifies the interaction between modules and port definition.\n      - The logic related to the iteration over the storage is moved to the `fuel-core-storage` crate and is now reusable. It provides an `iterator` method that duplicates the logic from `MemoryStore` on iterating over the `BTreeMap` and methods like `iter_all`, `iter_all_by_prefix`, etc. It was done in a separate revivable [commit](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1694/commits/5b9bd78320e6f36d0650ec05698f12f7d1b3c7c9).\n      - The `MemoryTransactionView` is fully replaced by the `StorageTransactionInner`.\n      - Removed `flush` method from the `Database` since it is not needed after https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1664.\n\n- [#1693](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1693): The change separates the initial chain state from the chain config and stores them in separate files when generating a snapshot. The state snapshot can be generated in a new format where parquet is used for compression and indexing while postcard is used for encoding. This enables importing in a stream like fashion which reduces memory requirements. Json encoding is still supported to enable easy manual setup. However, parquet is preferred for large state files.\n\n  ### Snapshot command\n\n  The CLI was expanded to allow customizing the used encoding. Snapshots are now generated along with a metadata file describing the encoding used. The metadata file contains encoding details as well as the location of additional files inside the snapshot directory containing the actual data. The chain config is always generated in the JSON format.\n\n  The snapshot command now has the '--output-directory' for specifying where to save the snapshot.\n\n  ### Run command\n\n  The run command now includes the 'db_prune' flag which when provided will prune the existing db and start genesis from the provided snapshot metadata file or the local testnet configuration.\n\n  The snapshot metadata file contains paths to the chain config file and files containing chain state items (coins, messages, contracts, contract states, and balances), which are loaded via streaming.\n\n  Each item group in the genesis process is handled by a separate worker, allowing for parallel loading. Workers stream file contents in batches.\n\n  A database transaction is committed every time an item group is successfully loaded. Resumability is achieved by recording the last loaded group index within the same db tx. If loading is aborted, the remaining workers are shutdown. Upon restart, workers resume from the last processed group.\n\n  ### Contract States and Balances\n\n  Using uniform-sized batches may result in batches containing items from multiple contracts. Optimal performance can presumably be achieved by selecting a batch size that typically encompasses an entire contract's state or balance, allowing for immediate initialization of relevant Merkle trees.\n\n### Removed\n\n- [#1757](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1757): Removed `protobuf` from everywhere since `libp2p` uses `quick-protobuf`.\n\n## [Version 0.23.0]\n\n### Added\n\n- [#1713](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1713): Added automatic `impl` of traits `StorageWrite` and `StorageRead` for `StructuredStorage`.

It creates two new concepts - Off-chain and On-chain databases where the GraphQL worker has exclusive ownership of the database and may modify it without intersecting with the On-chain database.\n- [#1577](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1577): Moved insertion of sealed blocks into the `BlockImporter` instead of the executor.\n- [#1574](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1574): Penalizes peers for sending invalid responses or for not replying at all.\n- [#1601](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1601): Fix formatting in docs and check that `cargo doc` passes in the CI.\n- [#1636](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1636): Add more docs to GraphQL DAP API.\n\n#### Breaking\n\n- [#1725](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1725): All API endpoints now are prefixed with `/v1` version. New usage looks like: `/v1/playground`, `/v1/graphql`, `/v1/graphql-sub`, `/v1/metrics`, `/v1/health`.\n- [#1722](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1722): Bugfix: Zero `predicate_gas_used` field during validation of the produced block.\n- [#1714](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1714): The change bumps the `fuel-vm` to `0.47.1`. It breaks several breaking changes into the protocol:\n  - All malleable fields are zero during the execution and unavailable through the GTF getters. Accessing them via the memory directly is still possible, but they are zero.\n  - The `Transaction` doesn't define the gas price anymore. The gas price is defined by the block producer and recorded in the `Mint` transaction at the end of the block. A price of future blocks can be fetched through a [new API nedopoint](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/1641) and the price of the last block can be fetch or via the block or another [API endpoint](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues/1647).\n  - The `GasPrice` policy is replaced with the `Tip` policy. The user may specify in the native tokens how much he wants to pay the block producer to include his transaction in the block. It is the prioritization mechanism to incentivize the block producer to include users transactions earlier.\n  - The `MaxFee` policy is mandatory to set. Without it, the transaction pool will reject the transaction. Since the block producer defines the gas price, the only way to control how much user agreed to pay can be done only through this policy.\n  - The `maturity` field is removed from the `Input::Coin`. The same affect can be achieve with the `Maturity` policy on the transaction and predicate. This changes breaks how input coin is created and removes the passing of this argument.\n  - The metadata of the `Checked<Tx>` doesn't contain `max_fee` and `min_fee` anymore. Only `max_gas` and `min_gas`. The `max_fee` is controlled by the user via the `MaxFee` policy.\n  - Added automatic `impl` of traits `StorageWrite` and `StorageRead` for `StructuredStorage`. Tables that use a `Blueprint` can be read and written using these interfaces provided by structured storage types.\n\n- [#1712](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1712): Make `ContractUtxoInfo` type a version-able enum for use in the `ContractsLatestUtxo`table.\n- [#1657](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1657): Changed `CROO` gas price type from `Word` to `DependentGasPrice`. The dependent gas price values are dummy values while awaiting updated benchmarks.\n- [#1671](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1671): The GraphQL API uses block height instead of the block id where it is possible. The transaction status contains `block_height` instead of the `block_id`.\n- [#1675](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1675): Simplify GQL schema by disabling contract resolvers in most cases, and just return a ContractId scalar instead.\n- [#1658](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1658): Receipts are part of the transaction status. \n    Removed `reason` from the `TransactionExecutionResult::Failed`. It can be calculated based on the program state and receipts.\n    Also, it is not possible to fetch `receipts` from the `Transaction` directly anymore. Instead, you need to fetch `status` and its receipts.\n- [#1646](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1646): Remove redundant receipts from queries.\n- [#1639](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1639): Make Merkle metadata, i.e. `SparseMerkleMetadata` and `DenseMerkleMetadata` type version-able enums\n- [#1632](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1632): Make `Message` type a version-able enum\n- [#1631](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1631): Modify api endpoint to dry run multiple transactions.\n- [#1629](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1629): Use a separate database for each data domain. Each database has its own folder where data is stored.\n- [#1628](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1628): Make `CompressedCoin` type a version-able enum\n- [#1616](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1616): Make `BlockHeader` type a version-able enum\n- [#1614](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1614): Use the default consensus key regardless of trigger mode. The change is breaking because it removes the `--dev-keys` argument. If the `debug` flag is set, the default consensus key will be used, regardless of the trigger mode.\n- [#1596](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1596): Make `Consensus` type a version-able enum\n- [#1593](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1593): Make `Block` type a version-able enum\n- [#1576](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1576): The change moves the implementation of the storage traits for required tables from `fuel-core` to `fuel-core-storage` crate. The change also adds a more flexible configuration of the encoding/decoding per the table and allows the implementation of specific behaviors for the table in a much easier way. It unifies the encoding between database, SMTs, and iteration, preventing mismatching bytes representation on the Rust type system level. Plus, it increases the re-usage of the code by applying the same blueprint to other tables.\n    \n    It is a breaking PR because it changes database encoding/decoding for some tables.\n    \n    ### StructuredStorage\n    \n    The change adds a new type `StructuredStorage`. It is a wrapper around the key-value storage that implements the storage traits(`StorageInspect`, `StorageMutate`, `StorageRead`, etc) for the tables with blueprint. This blueprint works in tandem with the `TableWithBlueprint` trait. The table may implement `TableWithBlueprint` specifying the blueprint, as an example:\n    \n    ```rust\n    impl TableWithBlueprint for ContractsRawCode {\n        type Blueprint = Plain<Raw, Raw>;\n    \n        fn column() -> Column {\n            Column::ContractsRawCode\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n    \n    It is a definition of the blueprint for the `ContractsRawCode` table. It has a plain blueprint meaning it simply encodes/decodes bytes and stores/loads them into/from the storage. As a key codec and value codec, it uses a `Raw` encoding/decoding that simplifies writing bytes and loads them back into the memory without applying any serialization or deserialization algorithm.\n    \n    If the table implements `TableWithBlueprint` and the selected codec satisfies all blueprint requirements, the corresponding storage traits for that table are implemented on the `StructuredStorage` type.\n    \n    ### Codecs\n    \n    Each blueprint allows customizing the key and value codecs. It allows the use of different codecs for different tables, taking into account the complexity and weight of the data and providing a way of more optimal implementation.\n    \n    That property may be very useful to perform migration in a more easier way. Plus, it also can be a `no_std` migration potentially allowing its fraud proving.\n    \n    An example of migration:\n    \n    ```rust\n    /// Define the table for V1 value encoding/decoding.\n    impl TableWithBlueprint for ContractsRawCodeV1 {\n        type Blueprint = Plain<Raw, Raw>;\n    \n        fn column() -> Column {\n            Column::ContractsRawCode\n        }\n    }\n    \n    /// Define the table for V2 value encoding/decoding.\n    /// It uses `Postcard` codec for the value instead of `Raw` codec.\n    ///\n    /// # Dev-note: The columns is the same.\n    impl TableWithBlueprint for ContractsRawCodeV2 {\n        type Blueprint = Plain<Raw, Postcard>;\n    \n        fn column() -> Column {\n            Column::ContractsRawCode\n        }\n    }\n    \n    fn migration(storage: &mut Database) {\n        let mut iter = storage.iter_all::<ContractsRawCodeV1>(None);\n        while let Ok((key, value)) = iter.next() {\n            // Insert into the same table but with another codec.\n            storage.storage::<ContractsRawCodeV2>().insert(key, value);\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n    \n    ### Structures\n    \n    The blueprint of the table defines its behavior. As an example, a `Plain` blueprint simply encodes/decodes bytes and stores/loads them into/from the storage. The `SMT` blueprint builds a sparse merkle tree on top of the key-value pairs.\n    \n    Implementing a blueprint one time, we can apply it to any table satisfying the requirements of this blueprint. It increases the re-usage of the code and minimizes duplication.\n    \n    It can be useful if we decide to create global roots for all required tables that are used in fraud proving.\n    \n    ```rust\n    impl TableWithBlueprint for SpentMessages {\n        type Blueprint = Plain<Raw, Postcard>;\n    \n        fn column() -> Column {\n            Column::SpentMessages\n        }\n    }\n                     |\n                     |\n                    \\|/\n    \n    impl TableWithBlueprint for SpentMessages {\n        type Blueprint =\n            Sparse<Raw, Postcard, SpentMessagesMerkleMetadata, SpentMessagesMerkleNodes>;\n    \n        fn column() -> Column {\n            Column::SpentMessages\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n    \n    ### Side changes\n    \n    #### `iter_all`\n    The `iter_all` functionality now accepts the table instead of `K` and `V` generics. It is done to use the correct codec during deserialization. Also, the table definition provides the column.\n    \n    #### Duplicated unit tests\n    \n    The `fuel-core-storage` crate provides macros that generate unit tests. Almost all tables had the same test like `get`, `insert`, `remove`, `exist`. All duplicated tests were moved to macros. The unique one still stays at the same place where it was before.\n    \n    #### `StorageBatchMutate`\n    \n    Added a new `StorageBatchMutate` trait that we can move to `fuel-storage` crate later. It allows batch operations on the storage. It may be more performant in some cases.\n\n- [#1573](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1573): Remove nested p2p request/response encoding. Only breaks p2p networking compatibility with older fuel-core versions, but is otherwise fully internal.\n\n\n## [Version 0.22.4]\n\n### Added\n\n- [#1743](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1743): Added blacklisting of the transactions on the `TxPool` level.\n  ```shell\n        --tx-blacklist-addresses <TX_BLACKLIST_ADDRESSES>\n            The list of banned addresses ignored by the `TxPool`\n            \n            [env: TX_BLACKLIST_ADDRESSES=]\n  \n        --tx-blacklist-coins <TX_BLACKLIST_COINS>\n            The list of banned coins ignored by the `TxPool`\n            \n            [env: TX_BLACKLIST_COINS=]\n  \n        --tx-blacklist-messages <TX_BLACKLIST_MESSAGES>\n            The list of banned messages ignored by the `TxPool`\n            \n            [env: TX_BLACKLIST_MESSAGES=]\n  \n        --tx-blacklist-contracts <TX_BLACKLIST_CONTRACTS>\n            The list of banned contracts ignored by the `TxPool`\n            \n            [env: TX_BLACKLIST_CONTRACTS=]\n  ```\n\n## [Version 0.22.3]\n\n### Added\n\n- [#1732](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1732): Added `Clone` bounds to most datatypes of `fuel-core-client`.\n\n## [Version 0.22.2]\n\n### Added\n\n- [#1729](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1729): Exposed the `schema.sdl` file from `fuel-core-client`. The user can create his own queries by using this file.\n\n## [Version 0.22.1]\n\n### Fixed\n- [#1664](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1664): Fixed long database initialization after restart of the node by setting limit to the WAL file.\n\n\n## [Version 0.22.0]\n\n### Added\n\n- [#1515](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1515): Added support of `--version` command for `fuel-core-keygen` binary.\n- [#1504](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1504): A `Success` or `Failure` variant of `TransactionStatus` returned by a query now contains the associated receipts generated by transaction execution.\n\n#### Breaking\n- [#1531](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1531): Make `fuel-core-executor` `no_std` compatible. It affects the `fuel-core` crate because it uses the `fuel-core-executor` crate. The change is breaking because of moved types.\n- [#1524](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1524): Adds information about connected peers to the GQL API.\n\n### Changed\n\n- [#1517](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1517): Changed default gossip heartbeat interval to 500ms. \n- [#1520](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1520): Extract `executor` into `fuel-core-executor` crate.\n\n### Fixed\n\n#### Breaking\n- [#1536](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1536): The change fixes the contracts tables to not touch SMT nodes of foreign contracts. Before, it was possible to invalidate the SMT from another contract. It is a breaking change and requires re-calculating the whole state from the beginning with new SMT roots. \n- [#1542](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1542): Migrates information about peers to NodeInfo instead of ChainInfo. It also elides information about peers in the default node_info query.\n\n## [Version 0.21.0]\n\nThis release focuses on preparing `fuel-core` for the mainnet environment:\n- Most of the changes improved the security and stability of the node.\n- The gas model was reworked to cover all aspects of execution.\n- The benchmarking system was significantly enhanced, covering worst scenarios.\n- A new set of benchmarks was added to track the accuracy of gas prices.\n- Optimized heavy operations and removed/replaced exploitable functionality.\n\nBesides that, there are more concrete changes:\n- Unified naming conventions for all CLI arguments. Added dependencies between related fields to avoid misconfiguration in case of missing arguments. Added `--debug` flag that enables additional functionality like a debugger.\n- Improved telemetry to cover the internal work of services and added support for the Pyroscope, allowing it to generate real-time flamegraphs to track performance.\n- Improved stability of the P2P layer and adjusted the updating of reputation. The speed of block synchronization was significantly increased.\n- The node is more stable and resilient. Improved DoS resistance and resource management. Fixed critical bugs during state transition.\n- Reworked the `Mint` transaction to accumulate the fee from block production inside the contract defined by the block producer.\n\nFuelVM received a lot of safety and stability improvements:\n- The audit helped identify some bugs and errors that have been successfully fixed.\n- Updated the gas price model to charge for resources used during the transaction lifecycle.\n- Added `no_std` and 32 bit system support. This opens doors for fraud proving in the future.\n- Removed the `ChainId` from the `PredicateId` calculation, allowing the use of predicates cross-chain.\n- Improvements in the performance of some storage-related opcodes.\n- Support the `ECAL` instruction that allows adding custom functionality to the VM. It can be used to create unique rollups or advanced indexers in the future.\n- Support of [transaction policies](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#version-0420) provides additional safety for the user. \n    It also allows the implementation of a multi-dimensional price model in the future, making the transaction execution cheaper and allowing more transactions that don't affect storage.\n- Refactored errors, returning more detailed errors to the user, simplifying debugging.\n\n### Added\n\n- [#1503](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1503): Add `gtf` opcode sanity check.\n- [#1502](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1502): Added price benchmark for `vm_initialization`.\n- [#1501](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1501): Add a CLI command for generating a fee collection contract.\n- [#1492](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1492): Support backward iteration in the RocksDB.

Before, it was possible to submit a transaction that didn't match the coin's values in the database, allowing printing/using unavailable assets.\n- [#1491](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1491): Removed unused request and response variants from the Gossipsub implementation, as well as related definitions and tests. Specifically, this removes gossiping of `ConsensusVote` and `NewBlock` events.\n- [#1472](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1472): Upgraded `fuel-vm` to `v0.42.0`. It introduces transaction policies that changes layout of the transaction. FOr more information check the [v0.42.0](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/pull/635) release.\n- [#1470](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1470): Divide `DependentCost` into \"light\" and \"heavy\" operations.\n- [#1464](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1464): Avoid possible truncation of higher bits. It may invalidate the code that truncated higher bits causing different behavior on 32-bit vs. 64-bit systems. The change affects some endpoints that now require lesser integers.\n- [#1432](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1432): All subscriptions and requests have a TTL now. So each subscription lifecycle is limited in time. If the subscription is closed because of TTL, it means that you subscribed after your transaction had been dropped by the network.\n- [#1407](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1407): The recipient is a `ContractId` instead of `Address`. The block producer should deploy its contract to receive the transaction fee. The collected fee is zero until the recipient contract is set.\n- [#1407](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1407): The `Mint` transaction is reworked with new fields to support the account-base model. It affects serialization and deserialization of the transaction and also affects GraphQL schema.\n- [#1407](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1407): The `Mint` transaction is the last transaction in the block instead of the first.\n- [#1374](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1374): Renamed `base_chain_height` to `da_height` and return current relayer height instead of latest Fuel block height.\n- [#1367](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1367): Update to the latest version of fuel-vm.\n- [#1363](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1363): Change message_proof api to take `nonce` instead of `message_id`\n- [#1355](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1355): Removed the `metrics` feature flag from the fuel-core crate, and metrics are now included by default.\n- [#1339](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1339): Added a new required field called `base_asset_id` to the `FeeParameters` definition in `ConsensusParameters`, as well as default values for `base_asset_id` in the `beta` and `dev` chain specifications.\n- [#1322](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1322):\n  The `debug` flag is added to the CLI. The flag should be used for local development only. Enabling debug mode:\n      - Allows GraphQL Endpoints to arbitrarily advance blocks.\n      - Enables debugger GraphQL Endpoints.\n      - Allows setting `utxo_validation` to `false`.\n- [#1318](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1318): Removed the `--sync-max-header-batch-requests` CLI argument, and renamed `--sync-max-get-txns` to `--sync-block-stream-buffer-size` to better represent the current behavior in the import.\n- [#1290](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1290): Standardize CLI args to use `-` instead of `_`.\n- [#1279](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1279): Added a new CLI flag to enable the Relayer service `--enable-relayer`, and disabled the Relayer service by default. When supplying the `--enable-relayer` flag, the `--relayer` argument becomes mandatory, and omitting it is an error. Similarly, providing a `--relayer` argument without the `--enable-relayer` flag is an error. Lastly, providing the `--keypair` or `--network` arguments will also produce an error if the `--enable-p2p` flag is not set.\n- [#1262](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1262): The `ConsensusParameters` aggregates all configuration data related to the consensus. It contains many fields that are segregated by the usage. The API of some functions was affected to use lesser types instead the whole `ConsensusParameters`. It is a huge breaking change requiring repetitively monotonically updating all places that use the `ConsensusParameters`. But during updating, consider that maybe you can use lesser types. Usage of them may simplify signatures of methods and make them more user-friendly and transparent.\n\n### Removed\n\n#### Breaking\n- [#1484](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1484): Removed `--network` CLI argument. Now the name of the network is fetched form chain configuration.\n- [#1399](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1399): Removed `relayer-da-finalization` parameter from the relayer CLI.\n- [#1338](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1338): Updated GraphQL client to use `DependentCost` for `k256`, `mcpi`, `s256`, `scwq`, `swwq` opcodes.\n- [#1322](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/pull/1322): The `manual_blocks_enabled` flag is removed from the CLI. The analog is a `debug` flag.\n"

          "content": "# Contributing to Fuel Core\n\nThanks for your interest in contributing to Fuel Core! This document outlines some the conventions on building, running, and testing Fuel Core.\n\nFuel Core has many dependent repositories. If you need any help or mentoring getting started, understanding the codebase, or anything else, please ask on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/xfpK4Pe).\n\n## Code Standards\n\nWe use an RFC process to maintain our code standards. They currently live in the RFC repo: <https://github.com/FuelLabs/rfcs/tree/master/text/code-standards>\n\n## Building and setting up a development workspace\n\nFuel Core is mostly written in Rust, but includes components written in C++ (RocksDB).\nWe are currently using the latest Rust stable toolchain to build the project.\nBut for `rustfmt`, we use Rust nightly toolchain because it provides more code style features(you can check [`rustfmt.toml`](.rustfmt.toml)).\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nTo build Fuel Core you'll need to at least have the following installed:\n\n-   `git` - version control\n-   [`rustup`](https://rustup.rs/) - Rust installer and toolchain manager\n-   [`clang`](http://releases.llvm.org/download.html) - Used to build system libraries (required for rocksdb).\n\nSee the [README.md](README.md#system-requirements) for platform specific setup steps.\n\n### Getting the repository\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core\n```\n\n### Configuring your Rust toolchain\n\n`rustup` is the official toolchain manager for Rust.\n\nWe use some additional components such as `clippy` and `rustfmt`(nightly), to install those:\n\n```sh\nrustup component add clippy\nrustup toolchain install nightly\nrustup component add rustfmt --toolchain nightly\n```\n\n### Building and testing\n\nInstead of a makefile, Fuel Core uses the `xtask` pattern to manage custom build processes.\n\nYou can build Fuel Core:\n\n```sh\ncargo xtask build\n```\n\nThis command will run `cargo build` and also dump the latest schema into `crates/client/assets/schema.sdl` folder.\n\nLinting is done using rustfmt and clippy, which are each separate commands:\n\n```sh\ncargo +nightly fmt --all\n```\n\n```sh\ncargo clippy --all-targets\n```\n\nThe test suite follows the Rust cargo standards. The GraphQL service will be instantiated by\nTower and will emulate a server/client structure.\n\nTesting is simply done using Cargo:\n\n```sh\ncargo test --all-targets\n```\n\n#### Build Options\n\nFor optimal performance, we recommend using native builds. The generated binary will be optimized for your CPU and may contain specific instructions supported only in your hardware.\n\nTo build, run:\n`$ RUSTFLAGS=\"-C target-cpu=native\" cargo build --release --bin fuel-core-bin`\n\nThe generated binary will be located in `./target/release/fuel-core`\n\n### Build issues\n\nDue to dependencies on external components such as RocksDb, build times can be large without caching.\nUsing an in-memory (hashmap) based database is supported for testing purposes, so build times can be improved by disabling\ndefault features.\n\n```sh\ncargo build -p fuel-core-bin --no-default-features\n```\n\n## Contribution flow\n\nThis is a rough outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:\n\n-   Make sure what you want to contribute is already traced as an issue.\n    -   We may discuss the problem and solution in the issue.\n-   Create a Git branch from where you want to base your work.

Checkout our [Help Wanted issues](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) for a list.\n\nIf you are planning something big, for example, relates to multiple components or changes current behaviors, make sure to open an issue to discuss with us before going on.\n\nThe Client team actively develops and maintains several dependencies used in Fuel Core, which you may be also interested in:\n\n-   [fuel-types](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/tree/master/fuel-types)\n-   [fuel-merkle](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/tree/master/fuel-merkle)\n-   [fuel-tx](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/tree/master/fuel-tx)\n-   [fuel-asm](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/tree/master/fuel-asm)\n-   [fuel-vm](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/tree/master/fuel-vm)\n\n### Linking issues\n\nPull Requests should be linked to at least one issue in the same repo.\n\nIf the pull request resolves the relevant issues, and you want GitHub to close these issues automatically after it merged into the default branch, you can use the syntax (`KEYWORD #ISSUE-NUMBER`) like this:\n\n```md\nclose #123\n```\n\nIf the pull request links an issue but does not close it, you can use the keyword `ref` like this:\n\n```md\nref #456\n```\n\nMultiple issues should use full syntax for each issue and separate by a comma, like:\n\n```md\nclose #123, ref #456\n```\n\n### Long tests issues\n\nIf your test if taking more than 5 minutes on the CI, you need to edit the `.config/nextest.toml` file to allow your test to have a bigger timeout. See [nextest documentation](https://nexte.st/docs/configuration/?h=config) for format\n\n### Releasing\n\nEach release should have its own new version of the `fuel_core_upgradable_executor::Executor` regardless of minor or major release. The version of the executor should grow without gaps.\nIf publishing the release fails or the release is invalid and\nwe don't plan to upgrade the network to use this release, \nwe still need to increase the version. \nThe network can easily skip releases by upgrading to the old state transition function.\n\nThe `fuel_core_upgradable_executor` crate also contains the mapping of the crate \nversion to the executor's version(`CRATE_VERSIONS`). For each release, \nwe need to add a new entry there. The version of the crate uses `-` instead \nof the `.` to avoid overriding old entries accidentally. \nIf you forgot to upgrade the version or add a new entry, the `version_check` test will fail.\n\n```rust\n/// This constant is used along with the `version_check` test.\n/// To avoid automatic bumping during release, the constant uses `-` instead of `.`.\n/// Each release should have its own new version of the executor.\n/// The version of the executor should grow without gaps.\n/// If publishing the release fails or the release is invalid, and\n/// we don't plan to upgrade the network to use this release,\n/// we still need to increase the version. The network can\n/// easily skip releases by upgrading to the old state transition function.\npub const CRATE_VERSIONS: &'static [(\n    &'static str,\n    StateTransitionBytecodeVersion,\n)] = &[\n    (\"0-26-0\", StateTransitionBytecodeVersion::MIN),\n    (\"0-27-0\", 1),\n    ...\n];\n```"

For more information run:\n\n```shell\ncat ci_checks.sh\n```\n\n## Running\n\nThe service can be launched by executing `fuel-core run`. The list of options for running can be accessed via the `help` option:\n\n```console\n$ ./target/debug/fuel-core run --help\n\nUSAGE:\n    fuel-core run [OPTIONS]\n\nOPTIONS:\n        --snapshot <SNAPSHOT>\n          Snapshot from which to do (re)genesis. Defaults to local testnet configuration\n\n          [env: SNAPSHOT=]\n        ...\n```\n\nFor many development purposes it is useful to have a state that won't persist and the `db-type` option can be set to `in-memory` as in the following example.\n\n### Example\n\n```console\n$ ./target/debug/fuel-core run --db-type in-memory\n2023-06-13T12:45:22.860536Z  INFO fuel_core::cli::run: 230: Block production mode: Instant\n2023-06-13T12:38:47.059783Z  INFO fuel_core::cli::run: 310: Fuel Core version v0.18.1\n2023-06-13T12:38:47.078969Z  INFO new{name=fuel-core}:_commit_result{block_id=b1807ca9f2eec7e459b866ecf69b68679fc6b205a9a85c16bd4943d1bfc6fb2a height=0 tx_status=[]}: fuel_core_importer::importer: 231: Committed block\n2023-06-13T12:38:47.097777Z  INFO new{name=fuel-core}: fuel_core::graphql_api::service: 208: Binding GraphQL provider to 127.0.0.1:4000\n```\n\nTo disable block production on your local node, set `--poa-instant=false`\n\n### Example\n\n```console\n$ ./target/debug/fuel-core run --poa-instant=false\n2023-06-13T12:44:12.857763Z  INFO fuel_core::cli::run: 232: Block production disabled\n```\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n#### Publishing\n\nWe use [`publish-crates`](https://github.com/katyo/publish-crates) action for automatic publishing of all crates.\n\nIf you have problems with publishing, you can troubleshoot it locally with [`act`](https://github.com/nektos/act).\n\n```shell\nact release -s GITHUB_TOKEN=<YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN> -j publish-crates-check --container-architecture linux/amd64 --reuse\n```\n\nIt requires GitHubToken to do request to the GitHub. You can create it \nwith [this](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.4/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) instruction.\n\n#### Outdated database\n\nIf you encounter an error such as\n\n```console\nthread 'main' panicked at 'unable to open database: DatabaseError(Error { message: \"Invalid argument: Column families not opened: column-11, column-10, column-9, column-8, column-7, column-6, column-5, column-4, column-3, column-2, column-1, column-0\" })', fuel-core/src/main.rs:23:66\n```\n\nClear your local database using: `rm -rf ~/.fuel/db`\n\n#### File descriptor limits\n\nOn some macOS versions the default file descriptor limit is quite low, which can lead to IO errors with messages like `Too many open files` or even `fatal runtime error: Rust cannot catch foreign exceptions` when RocksDB encounters these issues. Use the following command to increase the open file limit. Note that this only affects the current shell session, so consider adding it to `~/.zshrc`.\n\n```bash\nulimit -n 10240\n```\n\n#### Log level\n\nThe service relies on the environment variable `RUST_LOG`. For more information, check the [EnvFilter examples](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html#examples) crate.\n\nHuman logging can be disabled with the environment variable `HUMAN_LOGGING=false`\n\n## Debugging\n\nSee the guide on [debugging](docs/developers/debugging.md) for an overview on running a debug build of a local node.\n\n## Docker & Kubernetes\n\n```sh\n# Create Docker Image\ndocker build -t fuel-core . -f deployment/Dockerfile\n\n# Delete Docker Image\ndocker image rm fuel-core\n\n# Create Kubernetes Volume, Deployment & Service\nkubectl create -f deployment/fuel-core.yml\n\n# Delete Kubernetes Volume, Deployment & Service\nkubectl delete -f deployment/fuel-core.yml\n```\n\n## GraphQL service\n\nThe client functionality is available through a service endpoint that expect GraphQL queries.\n\n### Transaction executor\n\nThe transaction executor currently performs instant block production. Changes are persisted to RocksDB by default.\n\n-   Service endpoint: `/v1/graphql`\n-   Schema (available after building): `crates/client/assets/schema.sdl`\n\nThe service expects a mutation defined as `submit` that receives a [Transaction](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/tree/master/fuel-tx) in hex encoded binary format, as [specified here](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-specs/blob/master/src/tx-format/transaction.md).\n\n### cURL example\n\nThis example will execute a script that represents the following sequence of [ASM](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/tree/master/fuel-asm):\n\n```rs\nADDI(0x10, RegId::ZERO, 0xca),\nADDI(0x11, RegId::ZERO, 0xba),\nLOG(0x10, 0x11, RegId::ZERO, RegId::ZERO),\nRET(RegId::ONE),\n```\n\n```console\n$ cargo run --bin fuel-core-client -- transaction submit \\\n\"{\\\"Script\\\":{\n    \\\"body\\\":{\n      \\\"script_gas_limit\\\":1000000,\n      \\\"receipts_root\\\":\\\"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\\\",\n      \\\"script\\\":[80,64,0,202,80,68,0,186,51,65,16,0,36,4,0,0],\n      \\\"script_data\\\":[]\n    },\n  \\\"policies\\\":{\n      \\\"bits\\\":\\\"Maturity | MaxFee\\\",\n      \\\"values\\\":[0,0,0,0]},\n  \\\"inputs\\\":[{\n    \\\"CoinSigned\\\":{\n      \\\"utxo_id\\\":{\n        \\\"tx_id\\\":\\\"c49d65de61cf04588a764b557d25cc6c6b4bc0d7429227e2a21e61c213b3a3e2\\\",\n        \\\"output_index\\\":33298\n      },\n      \\\"owner\\\":\\\"f1e92c42b90934aa6372e30bc568a326f6e66a1a0288595e6e3fbd392a4f3e6e\\\",\n      \\\"amount\\\":4294967295,\n      \\\"asset_id\\\":\\\"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\\\",\n      \\\"tx_pointer\\\":{\n        \\\"block_height\\\":0,\n        \\\"tx_index\\\":0\n        },\n      \\\"witness_index\\\":0,\n      \\\"predicate_gas_used\\\":null,\n      \\\"predicate\\\":null,\n      \\\"predicate_data\\\":null}}],\n  \\\"outputs\\\":[],\n  \\\"witnesses\\\":[{\n    \\\"data\\\":[167,184,58,243,113,131,73,255,233,187,213,245,147,97,92,200,55,162,35,88,241,0,222,151,44,66,30,244,186,138,146,161,73,250,79,15,67,105,225,4,79,142,222,72,74,1,221,173,88,143,201,96,229,4,170,19,75,126,67,159,133,151,149,51]}\n  ]}}\"\n```\n\nYou may meet the error `Transaction is not inserted. UTXO does not exist` due to the UTXO validation. The UTXO validation can be turned off by adding the `--debug` flag.\n\n```console\n$ ./target/debug/fuel-core run --db-type in-memory --debug\n```"
