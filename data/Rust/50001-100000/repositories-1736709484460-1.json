          "content": "# The Tauri Architecture\n\n<https://tauri.app>\n\n<https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri>\n\n## Introduction\n\nTauri is a polyglot and generic toolkit that is very composable and allows engineers to make a wide variety of applications. It is used for building applications for Desktop Computers using a combination of Rust tools and HTML rendered in a Webview. Apps built with Tauri can ship with any number of pieces of an optional JS API / Rust API so that webviews can control the system via message passing. In fact, developers can extend the default API with their own functionality and bridge the Webview and Rust-based backend easily.\n\nTauri apps can have custom menus and have tray-type interfaces. They can be updated, and are managed by the user's operating system as expected. They are very small, because they use the OS's webview. They do not ship a runtime, since the final binary is compiled from Rust. This makes the reversing of Tauri apps not a trivial task.\n\n## What Tauri is NOT\n\n- Tauri is not a lightweight kernel wrapper...instead it directly uses [WRY](#wry) and [TAO](#tao) to do the heavy-lifting in making system calls to the OS.\n- Tauri is not a VM or virtualized environment...instead it is an application toolkit that allows making Webview OS applications.\n\n## Major Components\n\nThe following section briefly describes the roles of the various parts of Tauri.\n\n### Tauri Core [STABLE RUST]\n\n#### [tauri](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/tree/dev/crates/tauri)\n\nThis is the major crate that holds everything together. It brings the runtimes, macros, utilities and API into one final product. It reads the `tauri.conf.json` file at compile time in order to bring in features and undertake actual configuration of the app (and even the `Cargo.toml` file in the project's folder). It handles script injection (for polyfills / prototype revision) at runtime, hosts the API for systems interaction, and even manages updating.\n\n#### [tauri-build](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/tree/dev/crates/tauri-build)\n\nApply the macros at build-time in order to rig some special features needed by `cargo`.\n\n#### [tauri-codegen](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/tree/dev/crates/tauri-codegen)\n\n- Embed, hash, and compress assets, including icons for the app as well as the system-tray.\n- Parse `tauri.conf.json` at compile time and generate the Config struct.\n\n#### [tauri-macros](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/tree/dev/crates/tauri-macros)\n\nCreate macros for the context, handler, and commands by leveraging the `tauri-codegen` crate.\n\n#### [tauri-runtime](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/tree/dev/crates/tauri-runtime)\n\nThis is the glue layer between tauri itself and lower level webview libraries.\n\n#### [tauri-runtime-wry](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/tree/dev/crates/tauri-runtime-wry)\n\nThis crate opens up direct systems-level interactions specifically for WRY, such as printing, monitor detection, and other windowing related tasks. `tauri-runtime` implementation for WRY.\n\n#### [tauri-utils](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/tree/dev/crates/tauri-utils)\n\nThis is common code that is reused in many places and offers useful utilities like parsing configuration files, detecting platform triples, injecting the CSP, and managing assets.\n\n### Tauri Tooling\n\n#### [@tauri-apps/api](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/tree/dev/packages/api) [TS -> JS]\n\nA TypeScript library that creates `cjs` and `esm` JavaScript endpoints for you to import into your Frontend framework so that the Webview can call and listen to backend activity. We also ship the pure TypeScript, because for some frameworks this is more optimal. It uses the message passing of webviews to their hosts.\n\n#### [bundler](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/tree/dev/crates/tauri-bundler) [RUST / SHELL]\n\nThe bundler is a library that builds a Tauri App for the platform triple it detects / is told. At the moment it currently supports macOS, Windows and Linux - but in the near future will support mobile platforms as well. May be used outside of Tauri projects.\n\n#### [@tauri-apps/cli](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/tree/dev/packages/cli) [JS]\n\nIt is a wrapper around [tauri-cli](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/dev/crates/tauri-cli) using [napi-rs](https://github.com/napi-rs/napi-rs) to produce NPM packages for each platform.\n\n#### [tauri-cli](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/tree/dev/crates/tauri-cli) [RUST]\n\nThis rust executable provides the full interface to all of the required activities for which the CLI is required. It will run on macOS, Windows, and Linux.\n\n#### [create-tauri-app](https://github.com/tauri-apps/create-tauri-app) [JS]\n\nThis is a toolkit that will enable engineering teams to rapidly scaffold out a new tauri-apps project using the frontend framework of their choice (as long as it has been configured).\n\n# External Crates\n\nThe Tauri-Apps organisation maintains two \"upstream\" crates from Tauri, namely TAO for creating and managing application windows, and WRY for interfacing with the Webview that lives within the window.\n\n## [TAO](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tao)\n\nCross-platform application window creation library in Rust that supports all major platforms like Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS and Android. Written in Rust, it is a fork of [winit](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit) that we have extended for our own needs like menu bar and system tray.\n\n## [WRY](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry)\n\nWRY is a cross-platform WebView rendering library in Rust that supports all major desktop platforms like Windows, macOS, and Linux.\nTauri uses WRY as the abstract layer responsible to determine which webview is used (and how interactions are made).\n\n# Additional tooling\n\n## [tauri-action](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-action)\n\nThis is a github workflow that builds tauri binaries for all platforms. It is not the fastest out there, but it gets the job done and is highly configurable. Even allowing you to create a (very basic) tauri app even if tauri is not setup.\n\n## [create-pull-request](https://github.com/tauri-apps/create-pull-request)\n\nBecause this is a very risky (potentially destructive) github action, we forked it in order to have strong guarantees that the code we think is running is actually the code that is running.\n\n## [vue-cli-plugin-tauri](https://github.com/tauri-apps/vue-cli-plugin-tauri)\n\nThis plugin allows you to very quickly install tauri in a vue-cli project.\n\n## [tauri-vscode](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-vscode)\n\nThis project enhances the VS Code interface with several nice-to-have features.\n\n# Tauri Plugins [documentation](https://v2.tauri.app/develop/plugins/)\n\nGenerally speaking, plugins are authored by third parties (even though there may be official, supported plugins). A plugin generally does 3 things:\n\n1. It provides rust code to do \"something\".\n2. It provides interface glue to make it easy to integrate into an app.\n3. It provides a JS API for interfacing with the rust code.\n\nHere are several examples of Tauri Plugins:\n\n- <https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-plugin-sql>\n- <https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-plugin-stronghold>\n- <https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-plugin-authenticator>\n\n# Workflows\n\n## What does the Development flow look like?\n\nA developer must first install the prerequisite toolchains for creating a Tauri app. At the very least this will entail installing rust & cargo, and most likely also a modern version of node.js and potentially another package manager. Some platforms may also require other tooling and libraries, but this has been documented carefully in the respective platform docs.\n\nBecause of the many ways to build front-ends, we will stick with a common node.js based approach for development. (Note: Tauri does not by default ship a node.js runtime.)\n\nThe easiest way to do this is to run the following:\n\n```\nnpm create tauri-app\n```\n\nWhich will ask you a bunch of questions about the framework you want to install and then create everything you need in a single folder - some via the placement of template files and some through normal installation procedures of your framework.\n\n> If you don't use this process, you will have to manually install the tauri cli, initialise tauri and manually configure the `tauri.conf.json` file.\n\nOnce everything is installed, you can run:\n\n```\npnpm tauri dev\n-or-\nyarn tauri dev\n-or-\nnpm run tauri dev\n```\n\nThis will do several things:\n\n1. start the JS Framework devserver\n2. begin the long process of downloading and compiling the rust libraries\n3. open an application window with devtools enabled\n4. keep a long-lived console alive\n\nIf you change your HTML/CSS/TS/JS, your framework devserver should give you its best shot at instant hot module reloading and you will see the changes instantly.\n\nIf you modify your rust code or anything in the Cargo.toml, the window will close while rust recompiles. When finished it will reload.\n\nIf you need to get deeper insight into your current project, or triage requires investigation of installed components, just run:\n\n```\npnpm tauri info\n```\n\n## What does the Release flow look like?\n\nThe release flow begins with proper configuration in the `tauri.conf.json` file. In this file, the developer can configure not only the basic behaviour of the application (like window size and decoration), they can also provide settings for signing and updating.\n\nDepending upon the operating system that the developer (or CI) is building the application on, there will be an app built for them for that system. (Cross compilation is not currently available, however there is an official [GitHub Action](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-action) that can be used to build for all platforms.)\n\nTo kick off this process, just:\n\n```\npnpm tauri build\n```\n\nAfter some time, the process will end and you can see the results in the `./src-tauri/target/release` folder.\n\n## What does the End-User flow look like?\n\nEnd users will be provided with binaries in ways that are appropriate for their systems. Whether macOS, Linux, or Windows, direct download or store installations - they will be able to follow procedures for installing and removing that they are used to.\n\n## What does the Updating flow look like?\n\nWhen a new version is ready, the developer publishes the new signed artifacts to a server (that they have configured within `tauri.conf.json`).\n\nThe application can poll this server to see if there is a new release. When there is a new release, the user is prompted to update. The application update is downloaded, verified (checksum & signature), updated, closed, and restarted.\n\n## License\n\nTauri itself is licensed under MIT or Apache-2.0. If you repackage it and modify any source code, it is your responsibility to verify that you are complying with all upstream licenses. Tauri is provided AS-IS with no explicit claim for suitability for any purpose.\n\nHere you may peruse our [Software Bill of Materials](https://app.fossa.com/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Ftauri-apps%2Ftauri).\n"

Developers can integrate any front-end framework that compiles to HTML, JS and CSS for building their user interface. The backend of the application is a rust-sourced binary with an API that the front-end can interact with.\n\nThe user interface in Tauri apps currently leverages [`tao`](https://docs.rs/tao) as a window handling library on macOS, Windows, Linux, Android and iOS. To render your application, Tauri uses [WRY](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry), a library which provides a unified interface to the system webview, leveraging WKWebView on macOS & iOS, WebView2 on Windows, WebKitGTK on Linux and Android System WebView on Android.\n\nTo learn more about the details of how all of these pieces fit together, please consult this [ARCHITECTURE.md](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/blob/dev/ARCHITECTURE.md) document.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nIf you are interested in making a tauri app, please visit the [documentation website](https://tauri.app).\n\nThe quickest way to get started is to install the [prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for your system and create a new project with [`create-tauri-app`](https://github.com/tauri-apps/create-tauri-app/#usage). For example with `npm`:\n\n```sh\nnpm create tauri-app@latest\n```\n\n## Features\n\nThe list of Tauri's features includes, but is not limited to:\n\n- Built-in app bundler to create app bundles in formats like `.app`, `.dmg`, `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.AppImage` and Windows installers like `.exe` (via NSIS) and `.msi` (via WiX).\n- Built-in self updater (desktop only)\n- System tray icons\n- Native notifications\n- [Localhost free (🔥)](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/10510)\n- GitHub action for streamlined CI\n- VS Code extension\n\n### Platforms\n\nTauri currently supports development and distribution on the following platforms:\n\n| Platform          | Versions                                                                                                        |\n| :---------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Windows           | 7 and above                                                                                                     |\n| macOS             | 10.15 and above                                                                                                 |\n| Linux             | webkit2gtk 4.0 for Tauri v1 (for example Ubuntu 18.04). webkit2gtk 4.1 for Tauri v2 (for example Ubuntu 22.04). |\n| iOS/iPadOS (beta) | 9 and above                                                                                                     |\n| Android (beta)    | 7 and above                                                                                                     |\n\n## Contributing\n\nBefore you start working on something, it's best to check if there is an existing issue first. It's also a good idea to stop by the Discord server and confirm with the team if it makes sense or if someone else is already working on it.\n\nPlease make sure to read the [Contributing Guide](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making a pull request.\n\nThank you to everyone contributing to Tauri!\n\n### Documentation\n\nDocumentation in a polyglot system is a tricky proposition. To this end, we prefer to use inline documentation in the Rust & JS source code as much as possible. Check out the hosting repository for the documentation site for further information: <https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-docs>\n\n## Partners\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\">\n        <a href=\"https://crabnebula.dev\" target=\"_blank\">\n          <img src=\".github/sponsors/crabnebula.svg\" alt=\"CrabNebula\" width=\"283\">\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\nFor the complete list of sponsors please visit our [website](https://tauri.app#sponsors) and [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/tauri).\n\n## Organization\n\nTauri aims to be a sustainable collective based on principles that guide [sustainable free and open software communities](https://sfosc.org). To this end it has become a Programme within the [Commons Conservancy](https://commonsconservancy.org/), and you can contribute financially via [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/tauri).\n\n## Licenses\n\nCode: (c) 2015 - Present - The Tauri Programme within The Commons Conservancy.\n\nMIT or MIT/Apache 2.0 where applicable.\n\nLogo: CC-BY-NC-ND\n\n- Original Tauri Logo Designs by [Alve Larsson](https://alve.io/), [Daniel Thompson-Yvetot](https://github.com/nothingismagick) and [Guillaume Chau](https://github.com/akryum)\n\n[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.com/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Ftauri-apps%2Ftauri.svg?type=large)](https://app.fossa.com/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Ftauri-apps%2Ftauri?ref=badge_large)\n"
