See this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyon) for more information.\n\nThe name Dyon fits because, just like the particle, there are things that are yet to be discovered about language design.\nHowever, this language was not born out of a grand new vision,\nbut is the result of exploring and testing new ideas.\n\n### Motivation and goals\n\n[Sven Nilsen](https://github.com/bvssvni/) started this project in early 2016.\nThe idea was to make a simple, but convenient scripting language that integrated well with Rust.\n\n- During the first week of coding, a way to do lifetime checking on function arguments was discovered\n- A different approach to code organization was explored by adding the ability to dynamically load modules\n- For nice error handling, added option, result and `?` operator\n- To test the design of the language, created a demo for interactive coding\n- Mutability check to improve readability\n- Short For loop to improve readability and performance\n- Mathematical loops and Unicode symbols to improve readability\n- Go-like coroutines to add multi-thread support\n- 4D vectors with unpack and swizzle to make 2D and 3D programming easier\n- Html hex colors to make copying colors from image editors possible\n- Optional type system to help scaling a project\n- Ad-hoc types for extra type safety\n- Current objects to improve prototyping and tailored environments\n- Macros for easier embedding with Rust\n- Secrets to automatically derive meaning from mathematical loops\n- Closures that can be printed out, use current objects and grab from closure environment\n- Type safety for secrets, easy load/save of Dyon data\n- Link loop for easier and faster code generation and templates\n- In-types for easy cross thread communication\n- Lazy invariants, simple refinement types and binary operator overloading\n\nMain goals:\n\n- Integrate well with Rust\n- Flexible way of organizing code\n\nPerformance will be optimized for the cycle:\n\n```\ncoding -> parsing -> running -> debugging -> coding\n```\n\nSub goals:\n\n- Safety\n\nNon-goals:\n\n- Rust equivalent performance\n- Replace Rust to build libraries\n- Interfacing with other languages than Rust\n\n## License\n\nLicensed under either of\n * Apache License, Version 2.0 ([LICENSE-APACHE](LICENSE-APACHE) or http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\n * MIT license ([LICENSE-MIT](LICENSE-MIT) or http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\nat your option.\n\n### Contribution\n\nUnless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted\nfor inclusion in the work by you shall be dual licensed as above, without any\nadditional terms or conditions.\n"
