You can auto-create a pipeline layout (and modify the auto-generated parameters if needed) using the new `PipelineDescriptorSetLayoutCreateInfo` type.\n- `GraphicsPipelineCreateInfo::vertex_input_state` requires a `VertexInputState` struct directly, instead of a `VertexDefinition`. The `VertexDefinition` trait can be used to create the struct.\n- `GraphicsPipelineCreateInfo` now requires you to provide `input_assembly_state`, `rasterization_state`, `multisample_state` and `color_blend_state` instead of them having default values. You can still call `default()` to generate default values for each of them.\n- Instead of an entry point and specialization constants, pipeline construction now takes a `PipelineShaderStageCreateInfo` structure. `GraphicsPipelineCreateInfo` has a `stages` member that takes all shader stages at once, instead of separate members for each shader type. `EntryPoint` now owns instead of borrows a reference to the `ShaderModule`, so this is easier.\n- Specialization constants are now provided by calling `ShaderModule::specialize` with a `HashMap` containing `SpecializationConstant` enum values. This produces a `SpecializedShaderModule` value, which you can then create an `EntryPoint` from.\n- The `SpecializationConstants` trait is removed, and `vulkano_shaders` no longer generates structs for specialization constants.\n- `ViewportState` is now a standard struct with two fields, `viewports` and `scissors`.\n- The `origin` and `dimensions` fields of `Viewport` and `Scissors` are renamed to `offset` and `extent` to match Vulkan.\n- `Viewport::depth_range` is now an inclusive range.\n- All fields of `AttachmentBlend` are renamed to match Vulkan.\n- Added a `_ne` field to all pipeline state create info structs, as they should have had all along.\n- Dynamic state is now specified with the `GraphicsPipelineCreateInfo::dynamic_state` field.\n\nChanges to images:\n- There is now only the single type `Image` to represent images. `ImageAccess`, `ImageInner`, `AttachmentImage`, `ImmutableImage`, `StorageImage` and `SwapchainImage` were removed.\n- `ImageView` no longer has a type parameter, `ImageViewAbstract` was removed.\n- Removed `ImageAccessFromUndefinedLayout`, `ImmutableImageCreationError`, `ImmutableImageInitialization` and `MipmapsCount`.\n- `Image` was moved to the `image` module.\n- `ImageDimensions` is removed. `ImageCreateInfo` now instead has `image_type`, `extent` and `array_layers` to match Vulkan. Some of the methods of `ImageDimensions` have been turned into bare functions in the `image` module.\n- `ImageCreateFlags::ARRAY_2D_COMPATIBLE` is renamed to `DIM2D_ARRAY_COMPATIBLE` to better match the Vulkan name (but within the limitation that identifiers can't start with a digit).\n- `ImageCreateInfo::stencil_usage` is now an `Option<ImageUsage>`.\n\nChanges to buffers:\n- The `Subbuffer::{try_cast, try_cast_slice, try_from_bytes}` functions were replaced by `Subbuffer::reinterpret[_ref]`.\n- The `buffer_with_range(_array)` constructor of `WriteDescriptorSet` now takes `DescriptorBufferInfo` structs.\n- Index buffers are now specified using the `IndexBuffer` enum instead of the `Index` trait.\n- `ExternalBufferInfo::sparse` was replaced by a `flags` field.\n- `Subbuffer::mapped_ptr` was replaced by `Subbuffer::mapped_slice`.\n\nChanges to errors:\n- Added new types `ValidationError` and `Validated` (enum of `ValidationError` + something else) to return errors from any function. Some existing functions have been converted to use these types, others will follow later.\n- `AllocationCreationError` is renamed to `MemoryAllocatorError`.\n- `SuballocationCreationError` is renamed to `SuballocatorError`.\n\nChanges to command buffers:\n- `SyncCommandBuffer(Builder)` is merged into `*AutoCommandBuffer(Builder)`. The commands that formerly belonged to `SyncCommandBufferBuilder` are now available as `_unchecked` versions on `AutoCommandBufferBuilder`.\n- Command buffers are now created with a wrapping `Arc` like other object types.\n- The type parameter of `PrimaryCommandBuffer` and `SecondaryCommandBuffer` is now the allocator itself (like for the builder) rather than its allocation type.\n- `UnsafeCommandBuffer(Builder)` now takes ownership of the command buffer allocation, and has a type parameter for the allocator.\n- `CommandPoolResetError` is renamed to `ResetCommandPoolError`.\n- Command pool creation and resetting now take `CommandPoolCreateFlags` and `CommandPoolResetFlags` respectively.\n- All validated binding and dynamic state commands now return `Result` instead of panicking, just like the other commands.\n- The `begin_render_pass`, `next_subpass` and `end_render_pass` commands now take `SubpassBeginInfo` and/or `SubpassEndInfo` parameters. Nothing has changed functionally, but this allows for future-compatibility.\n- `UnsafeCommandBufferBuilder` now performs some validation, when it does not rely on tracking any state. The old, completely unvalidated commands have been renamed with `_unchecked` added to the end.\n\nChanges to descriptor sets and descriptor set layouts:\n- `PersistentDescriptorSet::new` now takes an additional parameter, specifying descriptor set copy operations.\n- `DescriptorSetLayoutCreateInfo::push_descriptor` has been replaced with a more generic `flags` field.\n- `DescriptorSetLayoutBinding::variable_descriptor_count` has been replaced with a more generic `binding_flags` field.\n- `DescriptorPool::allocate_descriptor_sets` is now validated, and returns `DescriptorPoolAlloc` objects.\n- `DescriptorSetAllocator::allocate` returns `Validated<VulkanError>` as its error type.\n- `UnsafeDescriptorSet::update` is now partially validated, and takes slices instead of iterators.\n- `UnsafeDescriptorSet` now owns its allocation.\n\nChanges to render pass objects:\n- `AttachmentDescription::stencil_load_op` and `stencil_store_op` are now wrapped in an `Option`. If it is `None`, the value is taken from `load_op` and `store_op` instead.\n- `SubpassDescription::resolve_attachments` is renamed to `color_resolve_attachments`.\n- Renamed `LoadOp` and `StoreOp` to `AttachmentLoadOp` and `AttachmentStoreOp` to match the Vulkan names.\n- In the `single_pass_renderpass` and `ordered_passes_renderpass` macros, the `load` and `store` fields for attachments are renamed to `load_op` and `store_op`, and ordered below the `format` and `samples` fields, to match the fields of the `AttachmentDescription` structure.\n\nChanges to instances:\n- `InstanceCreateInfo::enumerate_portability` has been replaced with a more generic `flags` field.\n- `DebugUtilsMessengerCreateInfo::user_callback` is now a custom type `DebugUtilsMessengerCallback`, and is unsafe to create.\n- The debug messenger callback now takes three parameters instead of one, corresponding to the first three parameters of the Vulkan callback (the fourth, user data, is represented by the closure itself).\n- `InstanceCreateInfo` now has a `debug_utils_messengers` field. The `Instance::with_debug_utils_messengers` constructor is removed, as the unsafety has been moved to the user callback construction itself.\n\nChanges to `DescriptorPool`:\n- `DescriptorPool::new` now returns validation errors instead of panicking.\n- `DescriptorPoolCreateInfo::can_free_descriptor_sets` has been replaced with a more generic `flags` field.\n\nChanges to pipeline caches:\n- They are now constructed with the standard combination of a `new` constructor and a `PipelineCacheCreateInfo`.\n\nChanges to `Swapchain`:\n- Swapchain creation no longer returns an error when the swapchain extent doesn't match the current surface extent. This requirement is ill-defined in the spec, as detailed here: [TOCTOU race condition on minImageExtent/maxImageExtent?](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Docs/issues/1144).\n- Renamed `acquire_full_screen_exclusive` and `release_full_screen_exclusive` to `acquire_full_screen_exclusive_mode` and `release_full_screen_exclusive_mode` to match the Vulkan names.\n- `acquire_next_image` and `wait_for_present` now return `Validated<VulkanError>` as their error type.\n\nChanges to samplers:\n- The `sampler` module is now a submodule of `image`.\n\nChanges to `Format`:\n- The following objects now use `Format` instead of `Option<Format>`: `BufferView`, `Image`, `ImageView`, `SamplerYcbcrConversion`.\n- The `block_size` method no longer returns an `Option`.\n- The `type_color`, `type_depth` and `type_stencil` methods are renamed to `numeric_format_color`, `numeric_format_depth` and `numeric_format_stencil`, and the returned type is renamed to `NumericFormat`.\n- `ShaderScalarType` is renamed to `NumericType`.\n\nChanges to memory allocation:\n- The memory (sub)allocation API has been completely reworked.\n  - `Buffer` and `SubbufferAllocator` now take an `Arc<dyn MemoryAllocator>` on construction.\n  - `Suballocator` and `MemoryAllocator` now have explicit `deallocate` methods in order to fix all the flexibility issues.\n  - `Suballocator` is completely generic now in regards to the type of suballocation.\n  - `SuballocationCreateInfo` was removed.\n  - `MemoryAllocatePreference` and `AllocationType` are no longer marked `#[non_exhaustive]`.\n  - `MemoryAlloc` was replaced by `ResourceMemory`, `MemoryAlloc` now only represents specifically allocations made by `MemoryAllocator`.\n  - `PoolAllocator` was removed.\n  - `GenericMemoryAllocatorCreateInfo::allocation_type` was removed.\n- `AllocationCreateInfo::usage` and `SubbufferAllocatorCreateInfo::memory_usage` were replaced by a `memory_type_filter` field, to allow for a more flexible selection of the memory type. Additionally, `SubbufferAllocatorCreateInfo::memory_type_filter` defaults to `MemoryTypeFilter::PREFER_DEVICE` for consistency with `AllocationCreateInfo`, unlike the previous default of `MemoryUsage::Upload`.\n- `SubbufferAllocatorCreateInfo::buffer_usage` is now empty by default for consistency with `BufferCreateInfo`.\n- `MemoryAlloc::new` no longer returns a `Result`, and doesn't map the `DeviceMemory` automatically anymore.\n- `MemoryAlloc::mapped_ptr` and `MemoryAlloc::mapped_slice[_mut]` were replaced by `MemoryAlloc::mapped_slice`, which returns a pointer.\n- `MemoryAlloc::{invalidate, flush}_range` now take a `MappedMemoryRange` as argument.\n- Merged `MemoryAllocator::allocate_from_type_unchecked` into `MemoryAllocator::allocate_from_type` and `MemoryAllocator::allocate_unchecked` into `MemoryAllocator::allocate`.\n- Replaced `MemoryAllocator::allocate_dedicated_unchecked` with `MemoryAllocator::allocate_dedicated`.\n- `FreeListAllocator`, `BuddyAllocator` and `BumpAllocator` are no longer `Sync`.\n- `GenericMemoryAllocatorCreateInfo::block_sizes` now represents a block size per memory type, instead of per memory heap, to allow for a more fine-grained configuration.\n- Merged `GenericMemoryAllocator::new_unchecked` into `GenericMemoryAllocator::new`.\n\nChanges to descriptor set allocation:\n- `StandardDescriptorSetAllocator` now takes a `StandardDescriptorSetAllocatorCreateInfo` parameter.\n\nChanges to command buffer allocation:\n- `StandardCommandBufferAllocatorCreateInfo::secondary_buffer_count` now defaults to 0.\n\nChanges to synchronization primitives:\n- `Event::signaled` is renamed to `is_signaled`, to match the method on `Fence`.\n- The `set_raw` and `reset_raw` methods of `Event` are removed.\n- `Event::reset` is now `unsafe`, as it has preconditions that cannot be validated.\n- `FenceCreateInfo::signaled` is replaced with a `flags` field.\n\nChanges to queries:\n- `Query` and `QueriesRange` are removed. The `get_results` method is moved to `QueryPool` directly.\n\nChanges to futures:\n- `FlushError` is replaced with `Validated<VulkanError>`.\n\nChanges to the `khr_display` extension:\n- The API is completely refactored.\n- Getting displays and display planes is now done from the physical device.\n- All features are now available.\n\nChanges to the physical device:\n- The `PhysicalDevice::surface_present_modes` method now takes an additional `SurfaceInfo` parameter.\n\n### Additions\n\n- Vulkano-shaders: Added a `root_path_env` property to allow loading shaders generated by a build script.\n- Support for the `khr_deferred_host_operations` extension.\n- Added `image_view_with_layout(_array)` and `image_view_with_layout_sampler(_array)` constructors to `WriteDescriptorSet`, which let you control the image layouts used for image views bound to a descriptor.\n- Added `Surface::from_window[_ref]` and `Surface::required_extensions`.

A `contains_enum` method that takes a value of the enum, and returns whether the bitflags contain the flag corresponding to that enum.\n  - A `From` implementation to convert the enum to the bitflags type, with a single flag set.\n  - A `FromIterator` implementation that collects an iterator of enums into a single bitflag value.\n  - An `IntoIterator` implementation that does the reverse.\n\nChanges to two swapchain bitflag types:\n  - `SupportedSurfaceTransforms` is renamed to `SurfaceTransforms`.\n  - `SupportedCompositeAlpha` is renamed to `CompositeAlphas`.\n\nChanges to buffers:\n- Merged `CpuAccessibleBuffer`, `DeviceLocalBuffer`, `BufferSlice`, `CpuBufferPoolChunk`, `CpuBufferPoolSubbuffer` into `Subbuffer`.\n- Removed `BufferAccess`, `TypedBufferAccess`, `BufferAccessObject`, `BufferInner` and `BufferViewAbstract`.\n- Replaced `CpuBufferPool` with `SubbufferAllocator`, which is now marked `!Sync` and no longer has a `T` type parameter. The type parameter was moved to the methods, to allow one allocator to allocate as many types of buffers as needed.\n- All methonds on `BufferContents` have been replaced.\n\nChanges to `DescriptorRequirements`:\n- The struct has been split into two levels: the per-binding `DescriptorBindingRequirements`, and the per-descriptor-index `DescriptorRequirements`.\n- The `descriptor_requirements` method of various types has been renamed to `descriptor_binding_requirements` to match.\n- `DescriptorBindingRequirements` has a single `descriptors` member instead of multiple `HashSet` members. This member is a `HashMap` with `Option<u32>` as the key type. The key `None` holds requirements for non-constant indices, while requirements for constant indices are stored as `Some`.\n- Validation checks against the requirements, and pipeline barriers, now always include the requirements of the `None` key as well. This may result in false positives, but prevents false negatives.\n- `DescriptorRequirements` now has `memory_read` and `memory_write` members, which hold a `ShaderStages` value for the stages which read or write the resource. This is used for more fine-grained pipeline barriers.\n\nChanges to the `sync` module and types:\n- Split the module into several submodules: `event`, `fence`, `future`, `semaphore`.\n- Added the `DependencyFlags` type, which is now used by `DependencyInfo` and `SubpassDependency`.\n- Renamed `QueueFamilyTransfer` to `QueueFamilyOwnershipTransfer` and made it into an enum to prevent invalid usage.\n\nChanges to `GpuFuture`:\n- The `check_buffer_access` and `check_image_access` methods now return nothing on success.\n\nChanges to pipelines:\n- The `descriptor_binding_requirements` method is moved to the `Pipeline` trait, and returns a reference to the hashmap directly.\n\nChanges to `impl_vertex`, `VertexMember` and `VertexMemberInfo`:\n- `VertexMember::format` now directly returns a `Format`\n- `VertexMemberInfo` now holds format and `VertexMemberTy` was removed.\n- `impl_vertex` was updated to correctly use the new `VertexMember::format` signature.\n\nChanges to memory and allocation:\n- `MemoryRequirements::{size, alignment}` fields have been replaced with a single `layout` field.\n- `Suballocator::allocate_unchecked` has been removed.\n- Device properties that represent alignments are now generated with the type `DeviceAlignment` instead of `DeviceSize`.\n- Removed `FastMemoryAllocator`, because it was giving people the wrong impression that this is a type of allocator that is employed often and for general tasks, which couldn't be further from the truth.\n- Renamed `MemoryUsage::GpuOnly` to `MemoryUsage::DeviceOnly`.\n- Marked `MemoryUsage`, `MemoryAllocatePreference` and `AllocationType` as non-exhaustive.\n- `AllocationCreateInfo::{requirements, allocation_type, dedicated_allocation}` fields were removed.\n- Added the parameters `requirements`, `allocation_type`, `dedicated_allocation` to `MemoryAllocator::allocate[_unchecked]`.\n\nChanges to vulkano-shaders:\n- Struct fields are now padded using `Padded`, instead of generating additional fields.\n- The `types_meta` option has been removed in favor of `custom_derives`. Additionally, a derive for `BufferContents` is automatically added to the generated structs, so there is no need to specify anything in order to use the structs in buffers.\n- The `ty` module is no longer generated. All types are generated in the same module where the macro call resides.\n\n### Additions\n\n- Added `SubbufferAllocatorCreateInfo`.\n- Allow waiting on `SwapchainAcquireFuture`.\n- Implement `IntoIterator` for `Features`, `DeviceExtensions` and `InstanceExtensions`.\n- A `buffer_with_range` constructor for `WriteDescriptorSet`, which can be used to select the range within the buffer that should be bound. This must be used when using dynamic buffers.\n- Added a derive macro for the `Vertex` trait. The `impl_vertex` macro and `VertexMember` trait are deprecated.\n- `BufferDefinition` matching logic was updated to work with the new `VertexMemberInfo` and now matches based on scalar type, number of components and number of elements allowing the use of formats such as `*_UNORM`.\n- `GraphicsPipelineBuilder` validation was extended to make sure locations are not bound multiple times when a single attribute spans multiple locations (e.g. using double precision float formats).\n- Added documentation of the cargo features to the main documentation page of each crate.\n- Added documentation of `_unchecked` functions to the main documentation page.\n- Added `DeviceLayout` and `DeviceAlignment`.\n- Added the type alias `NonZeroDeviceSize`.\n- Added `VertexBufferDescription` and three new methods to the `Vertex` trait that return it: `per_vertex`, `per_instance` and `per_instance_with_divisor`. This deprecates and replaces `BuffersDefinition`.\n- Implemented `From<SampleCount>` for `u32`.\n- Added documentation to the `shader` module to explain the layout of buffers, push constants and other data accessed by shaders.\n- The macros `single_pass_renderpass!` and `ordered_passes_renderpass!` now allow trailing commas in various places.\n- Added a `BufferContents` derive macro. You no longer need to use `bytemuck` to read/write your structs form/to buffers.\n- Added `BufferContentsLayout`.\n- Added support for allocating buffers with any kind of unsized contents, not just slices. These can also be read/written from the host.\n- Added `Padded`, which can be used to pad struct fields as well as array elements/matrix columns.\n- Added support for the `VK_EXT_external_memory_dma_buf` extension, which allows importing an image from a Linux dma_buf.\n- Vulkano-shaders: All error messages are now appropriately spanned compile-errors, instead of being panics.\n- Vulkano-shaders: Added support for arrays (and by extension matrices) whose stride exceeds the size of the element type in Rust (e.g. `vec3[]`).\n- Vulkano-shaders: Added a `linalg_type` option to the macro, for generating types from external linear algebra crates.\n- Vulkano-win: Added `create_surface_from_handle_ref`.\n- Vulkano-win: The features `winit` and `raw-window-handle` can now be used directly, `winit_` and `raw-window-handle_` have been deprecated.\n\n### Bugs fixed\n\n- [#2094](https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/2094): Fixed debug assertion when the first command in a command buffer that uses an image expects it to be in the `Undefined` layout.\n- Fixed wrong aspects being used in pipeline barriers when an image view selects one aspect of a combined depth+stencil image.\n- Fixed panic when building a finished command buffer, if the command buffer contains commands that use only some subresources of an image.\n- Fixed possible arithmetic overflows when allocating memory with a size that's too large.\n- Added missing check for the allocation type when binding memory.\n- [#2130](https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/2130): Fixed getting memory requirements on swapchain images, which don\n- Vulkano-shaders: Fixed an \"expected expression, found `,`\" compile error for precompiled shaders with more than one entrypoint.\n- [#2149](https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/2149): Image data being discarded when transitioning from UNDEFINED in StorageImage\n- Vulkano-shaders: `mat3xN` is now generated correctly, taking its matrix stride into account.\n- Vulkano-shaders: Row-major matrices are now generated correctly.\n- Fixed potential panics during panics.\n\n# Version 0.32.3 (2022-12-07)\n\n### Bugs fixed\n- Fixed issue with `MemoryAlloc::mapped_ptr` not being adjusted for offset.\n\n# Version 0.32.2 (2022-12-06)\n\n### Bugs fixed\n- Fixed another issue with `CpuBufferPool<T>`, where the alignment of `T` was not being considered when allocating.\n\n# Version 0.32.1 (2022-11-09)\n\n### Bugs fixed\n- [#2074](https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues/2074): Fixed error on multiple draw calls using a texture that had a layout transition.\n- Fixed an issue with `CpuBufferPool<T>`, where the alignment of `T` was not being considered when allocating.\n- Fixed an issue with `CpuBufferPool`, where the allocated subbuffers did not respect the non-coherent atom size for non-host-coherent memory types.\n\n# Version 0.32.0 (2022-10-31)\n\n### Breaking changes\n\nChanges to queue operations:\n- To do operations on a queue, you must now call `with` to gain access. This takes a closure that is passed a \n- The `wait` method of devices and queues is renamed to `wait_idle` to match Vulkan.\n- `Queue` now implements `VulkanObject` instead of `SynchronizedVulkanObject`, which is removed.\n- `Queue` now takes ownership of resources belonging to operations that you execute on it, to keep them from being destroyed while in use.\n- If `Queue` is dropped, it will call `wait_idle` to block the current thread until all operations on it have completed.\n- The `command_buffer::submit` module has been removed. The `SubmitAnyBuilder` enum is moved to the `sync` module, and no longer has a lifetime parameter.\n\nChanges to `Surface`, `Swapchain` and swapchain operations:\n- `Surface`, `Swapchain`, `SwapchainImage` and `SwapchainAcquireFuture` and related functions no longer have a `W` type parameter.\n- All constructors of `Surface` now take `Option<Arc<dyn Any + Send + Sync>>` instead of a generic `W`. The `window` function has been renamed to `object` and likewise returns `Option<&Arc<dyn Any + Send + Sync>>`.\n- Vulkano-win: `create_surface_from_handle` takes an `Arc<impl Any + Send + Sync + HasRawWindowHandle + HasRawDisplayHandle>`, `create_surface_from_winit` takes an `Arc<Window>`.\n- `PresentInfo` has been renamed to `SwapchainPresentInfo` and has differently named members and constructor.\n- `acquire_next_image` returns an `u32` index to match Vulkan.\n\nChanges to `GpuFuture`:\n- Added required method `check_swapchain_image_acquired`.\n- `AccessError::SwapchainImageAcquireOnly` has been renamed to `SwapchainImageNotAcquired`.\n\nChanges to command buffers and command pools:\n- Renamed `CommandPool` to `CommandBufferAllocator`, `StandardCommandPool` to `StandardCommandBufferAllocator`, and `UnsafeCommandPool` to `CommandPool` to better reflect their action.\n- Removed `Device::with_standard_command_pool`.\n- `AutoCommandBufferBuilder::{primary, secondary}` now take an implementation of `CommandBufferAllocator` instead of the `Device`.\n- The `PrimaryCommandBuffer` and `SecondaryCommandBuffer` traits are renamed to `PrimaryCommandBufferAbstract` and `SecondaryCommandBufferAbstract`.\n\nChanges to descriptor sets and descriptor pools:\n- Renamed `DescriptorPool` to `DescriptorSetAllocator`, `StandardDescriptorPool` to `StandardDescriptorSetAllocator`, and `UnsafeDescriptorPool` to `DescriptorPool` to better reflect their action.\n- `DescriptorPool` methods now take `&self` and the type itself is `!Sync`.\n- Removed `SingleLayoutDescPool` and `SingleLayoutVariableDescPool`.\n- Removed `Device::with_standard_descriptor_pool`.\n- Descriptor set allocators must now be managed manually.\n  - `PersistentDescriptorSet::{new, new_variable}` now take an implementation of `DescriptorSetAllocator`, `PersistentDescriptorSet::new_with_pool` has been removed.\n\nChanges to buffers and images:\n- `DeviceLocalBuffer::{from_buffer, from_data, from_iter}` and `ImmutableImage::{from_iter, from_buffer}` now take a mutable reference to an `AutoCommandBufferBuilder` instead of a queue, and no longer return a future. The upload command will be recorded into the provided command buffer, which should be executed later.\n- When binding memory to a buffer with the `shader_device_address` usage, and the `ext_buffer_device_address` extension isn't enabled, the memory must now have been allocated with the `MemoryAllocateFlags::device_address` flag set.\n- `UnsafeBuffer` and `UnsafeImage` are renamed to `RawBuffer` and `RawImage`.\n- `UnsafeBufferCreateInfo` and `UnsafeImageCreateInfo` are renamed to `BufferCreateInfo` and `ImageCreateInfo`.\n- `ImageCreateInfo` now takes a `flags` instead of separate booleans.\n- Replaced the various unsafe `*_linear_layout` methods of `UnsafeImage` with a safe `subresource_layout` method. The `LinearLayout` struct is renamed to `SubresourceLayout` to match.\n- Added `bind_memory` methods to these two types. These take `self` by value, and return `Buffer` and `Image` on success.\n- Added `Buffer` and `Image` types, which represent buffers and images that have had memory bound to them. This memory can be retrieved using the `memory()` method.\n- Most previous uses of `UnsafeBuffer` and `UnsafeImage` now use `Buffer` and `Image` instead.\n\nChanges to the `VulkanObject` trait:\n- The method `internal_object` is renamed to `handle`, and the associated type `Object` is renamed to `Handle`.\n\nChanges to `PipelineStages`:\n- The `transfer` flag has been renamed to `all_transfer`.\n\nChanges to `SubpassDependency`, `MemoryBarrier`, `BufferMemoryBarrier`, `ImageMemoryBarrier`:\n- Fields that start with `source_` have been renamed to `src_`.\n- Fields that start with `destination_` have been renamed to `dst_`.\n\nChanges to the `set_event` command:\n- This command now takes a `DependencyInfo` instead of `PipelineStages`, to enable use of the `vkCmdSetEvent2` version.\n\nChanges to memory allocation:\n- `MemoryPool` has been replaced with `MemoryAllocator` and `StandardMemoryPool` has been replaced with `StandardMemoryAllocator`.\n- Removed `AllocFromRequirementsFilter`, `MemoryPoolAlloc`, `MappingRequirement`, `AllocLayout`, `PotentialDedicatedAllocation`, `StandardNonHostVisibleMemoryTypePool`, `StandardNonHostVisibleMemoryTypePoolAlloc`, `StandardHostVisibleMemoryTypePool`, `StandardHostVisibleMemoryTypePoolAlloc` and `StandardMemoryPoolAlloc`.\n- Memory allocators must now be managed manually.\n  - Buffer and image constructors now take an implementation of the `MemoryAllocator` trait.\n\n### Additions\n- Added `bind_sparse_unchecked`, `present_unchecked` and `submit_unchecked` methods to `QueueGuard`.\n- Added the `device_coherent`, `device_uncached` and `rdma_capable` flags to `MemoryPropertyFlags`, and improved the documentation of all flags with additional usage advice.\n- Some methods of `PhysicalDevice` now cache their results, so that another call with the same arguments will retrieve them faster.\n- Fence methods are now validated and synchronized, so they take `&self`.\n- When calling `Fence::is_signaled` or `Fence::wait`, if the fence is associated with a queue, any resources of the associated queue operation will be released.\n- `VulkanLibrary::extension_properties`, to mirror the equivalent function on `PhysicalDevice`.\n- `VulkanLibrary` methods `layer_extension_properties`, `supported_layer_extensions` and `supported_extensions_with_layers`, to query the extensions supported by layers.\n- Added the remaining missing variants of the `ColorSpace` enum.\n- Added a `supports_protected` member to `SurfaceCapabilities` for the `khr_surface_protected_capabilities` extension.\n- Support for the `ext_validation_features` extension.\n- Support for the `khr_external_fence_fd` and `khr_external_fence_win32` extensions.\n- Added `MemoryAllocateFlags`.\n- Added `Device::allocation_count`.\n- Support for the `khr_external_semaphore_fd`, `khr_external_semaphore_win32` and `fuchsia_external_semaphore` extensions.\n- `Semaphore::export_fd` is no longer unsafe.\n- Added support for all remaining `PipelineStages` and `AccessFlags`, including those from the `synchronization2` feature.\n- Added support for `synchronization2` to the `set_event`, `reset_event` and `write_timestamp` commands, and to `SubpassDependency` when creating a render pass.\n- Added the `wait_events` command to `SyncCommandBufferBuilder` and `UnsafeCommandBufferBuilder`.\n- Added the `Suballocator` trait and 4 of its implementors: `FreeListAllocator`, `BuddyAllocator`, `PoolAllocator` and `BumpAllocator`.\n- Added `GenericMemoryAllocator` and its configuration `GenericMemoryAllocatorCreateInfo`.\n- Added `MemoryAlloc`, `AllocationCreateInfo`, `AllocationCreationError`, `MemoryUsage`, `MemoryAllocatePreference`, `MemoryTypeFilter`, `SuballocationCreateInfo` and `SuballocationCreationError`.\n- Added a `flags` field to `BufferCreateInfo`.

The descriptor type is inferred from the descriptor set layout.\n- **Breaking** Added an `Arc` to many parameters and return types:\n  - Objects implementing `BufferAccess`, `BufferViewAbstract`, `ImageAccess`, `ImageViewAbstract` or `DescriptorSet` are now always constructed in an `Arc`, and parameters that take one of these types require the `Arc` wrapper.\n  - The type parameters of `BufferView`, `ImageView` and `BufferSlice` do not contain this implicit `Arc`.\n  - The types `DescriptorSetLayout`, `PipelineLayout`, `ComputePipeline`, `GraphicsPipeline`, `QueryPool`, `RenderPass` and `Framebuffer` are also always constructed in an `Arc`.\n- **Breaking** `Framebuffer` no longer has a type parameter.\n  - This made the `FramebufferAbstract` trait redundant, and it has been removed.\n  - `CommandBufferLevel` and its nested types no longer have a type parameter either.\n  - `AttachmentsList` is no longer needed and has been removed.\n- **Breaking** The `dimensions` method has been removed as an inherent method from types that already implement `ImageAccess`, to avoid confusion between the inherent method and the method of the trait when they have different semantics.\n- **Breaking** Replaced `DescriptorDescTy` with `DescriptorType` and made further changes to the members of `DescriptorDesc`.\n- **Breaking** Added a `Pipeline` trait to hold methods that are common to all pipeline types.\n- **Breaking** Changes to allow allocating variable descriptor counts:\n  - The `alloc` method of the `DescriptorPool` trait now has a second parameter to specify the number of descriptors to allocate for the variable count binding. If there is no variable count binding in the layout, this should be 0.\n  - The `alloc` method of `UnsafeDescriptorPool` now takes an iterator of `DescriptorSetAllocateInfo`.\n- For `PersistentDescriptorSet` when using a layout with a variable count binding, allocate only the number of descriptors needed instead of always the maximum.\n- Descriptor resources are now checked against the shader requirements at the time of a draw/dispatch call, rather than at the time the descriptor set is created. Only the resources that are actually needed in the shader are checked, the other resources in a descriptor set are ignored and don't need to be valid.\n- Added a new `DescriptorRequirements` type, which contains requirements imposed by a shader onto a descriptor and the resources bound to it.\n  - `DescriptorDesc` can be created from `DescriptorRequirements` with the `From` trait.\n  - `DescriptorSetDesc`s can be created from the requirements with the `from_requirement` constructor.\n  - The descriptor requirements of a pipeline can be queried using a new `descriptor_requirements` method.\n- Added basic support for the `khr_push_descriptor` extension, with an example of how it's used. The implementation is somewhat limited and some of the details may change in a future update.\n- Added support for lots more dynamic state, most of which requires features or extensions to use.\n- Added support for discard rectangles, in the `pipeline::discard_rectangle` module.\n- Added support for line rasterization state, in the `pipeline::rasterization` module.\n- Added support for color write enable state, in the `pipeline::color_blend` module.\n- `GraphicsPipeline` now has methods to return each state object it was created with.\n- `ash` has been updated to 0.33.3, which provides new features and extensions.\n- Added `CommandBufferState::push_constants` to retrieve the set of all push constant bytes that have been set.\n- Added check to `AutoCommandBufferBuilder` to ensure that the push constants that are needed by the pipeline have been set.\n- Added android platform to external memory cfgs.\n- Fixed two bugs related to the requirements for enabled extensions:\n- For required extensions that have been promoted, the promoted version now also fulfills the requirement.\n- For features that must be enabled in tandem with extensions (e.g. `descriptor_indexing`), the requirement only applies to Vulkan 1.2 and above, since these features do not exist on earlier versions and thus cannot be enabled.\n- Fix device memory builder not including p_next structures.\n- Fix exportable image not created with VkExternalMemoryImageCreateInfo.\n- Fix mutable bit not set on exportable image.\n- `ShaderModule` can how handle multiple entry points with the same name but differing execution models. `ShaderModule::entry_point` will now return `None` if the entry point with the specified name does not exist or is ambiguous. To disambiguate, use `ShaderModule::entry_point_with_execution`.\n- Added a `shaderc-debug` cargo feature to Vulkano-shaders, to emit debug information in the generated SPIR-V code.\n- Added a `type_for_format` macro, which returns a Rust type that is suitable for representing a given `Format`.\n- Fixed a bug when using vulkano-shaders macro with multiple shaders in release mode.\n- Fixed bug where the wrong image layout was used for images used as a storage image.\n- Fix typo in `clear_depth_stencil`.\n\n# Version 0.26.0 (2021-10-2)\n\n- **Breaking** The `draw` and `draw_indexed` commands on `AutoCommandBufferBuilder` now take parameters to explicitly specify the range of vertices and instances to draw.\n- **Breaking** `BufferlessDefinition` is removed.\n- **Breaking** The `VertexSource` trait is removed, and has been replaced with the new `VertexBuffersCollection` trait, which works analogously to `DescriptorSetsCollection`. Vertex buffers can now be passed in as a tuple, just like descriptor sets.\n- **Breaking** Removed the vertex definition type parameter from `GraphicsPipeline`, which is no longer needed with the change above.\n- **Breaking** The `ComputePipelineAbstract` and `GraphicsPipelineAbstract` traits are no longer needed and have been removed, with their methods made available on the base `ComputePipeline` and `GraphicsPipeline` types.\n- **Breaking** Changes to `DescriptorDesc` and related changes:\n  - The variants of `DescriptorDescTy` now match those of `DescriptorType` and Vulkan.\n  - The `array_count` and `readonly` members are renamed to `descriptor_count` (to match Vulkan) and `mutable` (with the opposite sense, to match familiar Rust usage).\n  - `DescriptorImageDesc` is renamed to `DescriptorDescImage`. The `dimensions` and `arrayed` members have been combined into a single `ImageViewType` value.\n  - Removed the `arrayed` member of the `InputAttachment` variant as well, as the standard now explicitly disallows arrayed input attachments.\n  - The `ensure_superset_of` method has been split into two, one for shader compatibility and one for binding descriptor sets. The error return types of these methods have been revised.\n- **Breaking** The `Cubemap` and `CubemapArray` variants of `ImageViewType` are renamed to `Cube` and `CubeArray` to match Vulkan.\n- **Breaking** Setting state in `AutoCommandBufferBuilder` is now done via separate commands (e.g. `bind_descriptor_sets`, `bind_vertex_buffers`) instead of being provided with dispatch/draw commands. This matches how these commands work in Vulkan.\n  - Validity of the state is checked by the dispatch/draw commands.\n  - `DynamicState` is removed; each individual state now has its own command to set it. This includes some states that were not previously included in `DynamicState`.\n- **Breaking** `StateCacher` is removed; its task is now partially handled by `SyncCommandBufferBuilder`.\n- **Breaking** Many traits now require `Send + Sync`: `BufferAccess`, `ImageAccess`, `ImageViewAbstract`, `FramebufferAbstract`, `AttachmentsList`, `MemoryPoolAlloc`, `DescriptorSet`, `DescriptorPoolAlloc`, `PrimaryCommandBuffer`, `SecondaryCommandBuffer`, `CommandPoolAlloc`. This further means that any type parameters of types implementing these traits also require `Send + Sync`.\n- **BREAKING** `DescriptorSetLayout::new()` now returns `Result<Self, DescriptorSetLayoutError>` instead of Result<Self, OomError>`\n- **BREAKING** `DescriptorCompatibilityError` additional variant `VariableCount`.\n- **BREAKING** `GraphicsPipelineCreationError` additional variant `PipelineLayoutCreationError`.\n- **BREAKING** `PipelineLayoutCreationError` additional variant `SetLayoutError`.\n- **BREAKING** `FixedSizeDescriptorSetsPool` has been replaced by `SingleLayoutDescSetPool`.\n- **BREAKING** Set builders now return `&mut Self` instead of `Self` & methods take values wrapped in an `Arc`.\n- **Breaking** Changes to `Format`:\n  - `Format` variants are now all uppercase with underscores. This avoids interpretation problems where the underscore is significant for the meaning.\n  - The `ty` method and the `FormatTy` enum are removed. They are replaced with the `NumericType` enum, which concerns itself only with the numeric representation and not with other properties. There are now three `type_*` methods to retrieve it, for colour, depth and stencil respectively.\n  - The `planes` method now returns a slice containing the equivalent single-plane formats of each plane.\n- **Breaking** The `ImageAccess` trait no longer has the `has_color`, `has_depth` and `has_stencil` methods. This information can be queried using the `aspects` or `type_*` methods of `Format`.\n- **Breaking** Changes made to `DescriptorDescTy` to support immutable samplers.\n- **Breaking** `DescriptorWrite::combined_image_sampler` now takes the sampler in an `Option`. Use `None` when the descriptor has immutable samplers.\n- **Breaking** Changes to pipeline layout tweaks:\n  - `DescriptorSetDesc::tweak` is renamed to `set_buffer_dynamic`, and now takes only a single binding index.\n  - `DescriptorSetDesc::tweak_multiple` is removed.\n  - The dynamic buffers parameter of `GraphicsPipelineBuilder::with_auto_layout` has been replaced with a closure that can be used to make tweaks to the descriptor set layouts as needed.\n  - `ComputePipeline::new` has an additional closure parameter identical to the one described above.\n- **Breaking** `AttachmentImage::dimensions()` now returns `[u32; 3]` which includes the layer count.\n- **Breaking** Buffers and Images that have `with_exportable_fd` use dedicated allocation, thus requiring khr_get_memory_requirements2 and khr_dedicated_allocation on top of \nalready needed khr_external_memory and khr_external_memory_fd.\n- **Breaking** `Compare` is renamed to `CompareOp` to match Vulkan.\n- **Breaking** Vulkano-shaders no longer generates a `Shader` struct, but instead provides `load` as a standalone function that returns `Arc<ShaderModule>` directly.\n- **Breaking** Vulkano-shaders no longer generates a function for each entry point. Entry points are now retrieved using the `entry_point` method of `ShaderModule`.\n- **Breaking** The `shader` module is moved to the crate root, and `spirv` is now a submodule of it.\n- **Breaking** `ShaderModule::new` is renamed to `from_bytes` to match the existing `from_words`.\n- **Breaking** `ShaderModule` now parses and analyses the shader provided to it on construction, checks whether the shader is compatible with the device, and gathers data such as descriptor sets and input/output interfaces directly from its code. To provide this data yourself as before, and avoid parsing, you can use the `_with_data` constructors.\n- **Breaking** `ComputeEntryPoint` and `GraphicsEntryPoint` are removed, as are the functions on `ShaderModule` that generate them. Instead, you can look up an entry point using the `entry_point` method.\n- Added support for additional shader types in `ShaderStage`, `ShaderStages` and `PipelineStages`.\n- Added `export_fd` and `with_exportable_fd` to `AttachmentImage` and `StorageImage` as well as `mem_size` which is needed when using those images with Cuda.\n- Vulkano-shaders: added extension/feature checks for more SPIR-V capabilities.\n- Added support for surface creation from a CAMetalLayer using VK_EXT_metal_surface.\n- Bug fixed. Image layout passed to SubImage is now being respected\n- The full Rust code is now generated from vk.xml by autogen directly, instead of using intermediate macros.\n- Added `storage_buffer()` method to `BufferUsage`.\n- Fixed mismatched types on Android.\n- Fixed bug in descriptor set validity checking that allowed drawing/dispatching with descriptor sets that didn't match the pipeline.\n- Fixed bug where the wrong functions were used for retrieving physical device info.\n- Fixed minor bug in retrieving features from the physical device.\n- Add BSD platforms to external memory (dma-buf fd) cfgs\n- Added support for `u8` index buffers with the `ext_index_buffer_uint8` extension.\n- Descriptor sets now support variable count descriptors.\n    - e.g. `layout(set = 0, binding = 0) uniform sampler2D textures[];`\n- Non-breaking `Format` additions:\n  - Formats and their metadata are now auto-generated from vk.xml. This significantly expands the support for YCbCr formats in particular.\n  - The `compatibility` method returns an object that can be used to check the compatibility of two formats, explained [here](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/chap43.html#formats-compatibility-classes).\n  - The `components` method returns the number of bits in each colour component.\n  - The `compression` method returns the compression scheme as a new enum, `CompressionType`.\n  - The `requires_sampler_ycbcr_conversion` method returns whether the \"sampler YCbCr conversion\" must be enabled on an image view and sampler in order to use this format.\n  - `GraphicsPipelineBuilder` now uses `Vec` instead of `SmallVec` internally to reduced stack usage.\n- Added support for descriptors with immutable samplers.\n  - They are included as separate members on the appropriate variants of `DescriptorDescTy`.\n  - Added a `set_immutable_samplers` method to `DescriptorSetDesc`, which lets you set the immutable samplers for a descriptor. This can be used together with the closure provided to pipeline constructors.\n  - `add_image` can be used when building a descriptor set, to provide an image to a combined image sampler descriptor that has immutable samplers.\n- Updated dependencies:\n  - png 0.16 > 0.17\n  - time 0.2 > 0.3\n- `AttachmentImage::current_layer_levels_access()` now returns the correct range which solves pipeline barriers only affecting the first layers of of a multi-layer `AttachmentImage`.\n- A new Vulkano-shaders macro option `shaders` to compile several shaders in a single macro invocation producing generated Rust structs common for all specified shaders without duplications. This feature improves type-safe interoperability between shaders.\n- Fixed CommandBufferExecFuture adding the command buffer to queue submission after being flushed.\n- Added a `spirv` module to the main crate, which contains an auto-generated parser for SPIR-V files, and various other utilities that can be used to analyze shaders at runtime.\n- `DescriptorSetLayout` now has `variable_descriptor_count` which returns the descriptor count in a variable count descriptor if present.\n- Additional copy buffer to image checks.\n- Add `clear_depth_stencil_image` to `AutoCommandBufferBuilder` to clear depth / stencil images.\n- `AutoCommandBufferBuilder` and `SyncCommandBufferBuilder` now have a `state` method, which can be used to query the state set by previous \"bind\" and \"set\" commands.\n- Changed parameters requiring an iterator so that they now take `IntoIterator`, for more flexibility.\n- Removed various custom iterator types in favour of returning `impl Iterator`.\n- Replaced the various dynamic state querying methods of `GraphicsPipeline` with two: `dynamic_state` to query a single dynamic state, and `dynamic_states` to iterate over all of them.\n\n\n# Version 0.25.0 (2021-08-10)\n\n- **Breaking** Refactoring of `PhysicalDevice` and related types.\n  - The module `instance::physical_device` is moved to `device::physical`. Items are exported directly from there.\n  - Functions on `PhysicalDevice` that previously returned a custom iterator type now return `impl ExactSizeIterator`.\n  - `PhysicalDevice` now has new methods `supported_extensions` and `required_extensions`. The equivalent constructors on `DeviceExtensions` are deprecated, but still present.\n- **Breaking** Renamed `Device::loaded_extensions` to `enabled_extensions`, to match the terminology used for `enabled_features` as well as the Vulkan standard.\n- **Breaking** Renamed `Instance::loaded_extensions` and `loaded_layers` to `enabled_extensions` and `enabled_layers` respectively.\n- **Breaking** Major reorganisation of the `descriptor` module. Most importantly, its `descriptor_set` child is moved to the crate root and everything is placed under there. Full list of module changes:\n  - `descriptor::descriptor_set::*` > `descriptor_set`.\n  - `descriptor::descriptor::*` > `descriptor_set::layout`.\n    - But `ShaderStages*` are moved to `pipeline::shader`.\n  - `descriptor_set::UnsafeDescriptorSetLayout` > `descriptor_set::layout::DescriptorSetLayout` (renamed).\n  - `descriptor_set::DescriptorSetDesc` > `descriptor_set::layout`.\n  - `descriptor_set::{FixedSize*}` > `descriptor_set::fixed_size_pool`.\n    - Re-exported `descriptor_set::FixedSizeDescriptorSetsPool`.\n  - `descriptor_set::{Persistent*}` > `descriptor_set::persistent`.\n    - Re-exported `descriptor_set::PersistentDescriptorSet`, `descriptor_set::PersistentDescriptorSetBuildError`, `descriptor_set::PersistentDescriptorSetError`.\n  - `descriptor_set::{DescriptorPool*, DescriptorsCount, UnsafeDescriptorSetPool*}` > `descriptor_set::pool`.\n  - `descriptor_set::{StdDescriptorPool*}` > `descriptor_set::pool::standard`.\n    - Re-exported `descriptor_set::pool::StdDescriptorPool`.\n  - `descriptor_set::{DescriptorWrite, UnsafeDescriptorSet}` > `descriptor_set::sys`.\n  - `descriptor_set::collection` is now private.\n- **Breaking** `Features::superset_of` is renamed to `is_superset_of`.\n- **Breaking** The `VertexDefinition` trait no longer has `AttribsIter` and `BuffersIter` as associated types. It instead returns a `VertexInput`.\n- **Breaking** The various types for vertex definitions (except `BufferlessDefinition`) have been replaced with the new `BuffersDefinition` type, which can handle any number of vertex and instance buffers. Examples of how it's used can be seen in the \"instancing\" and \"teapot\" examples.\n- **Breaking** `InputRate` has been renamed to `VertexInputRate` to match the Vulkan name. The `Instance` variant now has a `divisor` member.\n- **Breaking** `DescriptorSetDesc` is converted from a trait to a struct. `DescriptorSetLayout` can take this struct in its constructor, as alternative to the iterator which was already possible previously.\n- **Breaking** `PipelineLayout` is now built from a list of descriptor set layouts and push constant ranges, like in plain Vulkan. It no longer constructs its own descriptor set layouts internally.\n- **Breaking** `PipelineLayoutDescPcRange` is renamed to `PipelineLayoutPcRange`.\n- **Breaking** `PipelineLayoutDesc` is no longer needed and is removed. Its functionality has been moved to `DescriptorSetDesc` and `PipelineLayoutPcRange`. This also applies to `ComputeEntryPoint`, `GraphicsEntryPoint` and `EntryPointAbstract`.\n- **Breaking** `PipelineLayout` now has a `descriptor_set_layouts` method which returns a slice of all the layouts, replacing the previous `descriptor_set_layout` which only returned one at a time.\n- **Breaking** Vulkano is now relaying on features from **Rustc >= 1.53.0**.\n- **Breaking** The boolean `graphics` parameter on the `bind_descriptor_sets` method of `SyncCommandBufferBuilder`, `UnsafeCommandBufferBuilder` and `StateCacher` has been replaced with a new enum `PipelineBindPoint`.\n- **Breaking** Known physical device properties (VkPhysicalDeviceProperties, VkPhysicalDeviceLimits, VkPhysicalDeviceSparseProperties) are now no longer `Option<T>`.\n  - These properties are available with every `vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties2` call.\n  - Add some `Default` instances to make the auto trait happy.\n- **Breaking** Values that represent a size, offset or index on the device are now represented as `DeviceSize` (a type alias of `u64`).\n- **Breaking** Fix in push constant ranges with intersecting stage flags.\n- Added support for the `ext_vertex_attribute_divisor` extension, via the new `BuffersDefinition` type and the additions to `VertexInputRate`.\n- Added `is_superset_of` method to `DeviceExtensions` and `InstanceExtensions`.\n- Examples now enable only the features they need instead of all of them.\n- Examples have much smarter device selection logic. In the triangle example this is supplied with comments.\n- Errors checking(by unwrapping) in `MappedDeviceMemory::read_write`.\n- Add creation of Semaphores with exportable Linux file descriptor on.\n- Add method to export file descriptor corresponding to Semaphore.\n- `SemaphoreBuilder` introduced. \n- Add DisplayNative enum variant to ColorSpaceEnum (AMD-specific feature).\n- Vulkano-shaders now provides the image format for descriptors, if the shader requires a specific format.\n- Vulkano-shaders now uses the `spirv_headers` crate for some of its types.\n- Large allocations now use dedicated allocations which improves memory efficiency.\n- Add `Clone` interface for `LayerProperties`.\n- Fixed detection of storage buffers in SPIR-V so that it works for all SPIR-V versions.\n- Added `VertexInput` type, which contains the binding and attribute descriptions.\n- Added a `vertex_input` method to `GraphicsPipelineAbstract`, which returns a reference to the vertex input.\n- Add support for 8bit uniform storage.\n- Added limits check for vertex buffer binding numbers.\n- Fixed synchronization bug where pipeline barriers were placed based on the binding of resources instead of the draw/dispatch calls that use them.\n- `SyncCommandBufferBuilder` and `UnsafeCommandBufferBuilder` accept any `IntoIterator` where they previously only accepted `Iterator`.\n- Updated ash to 0.33.0, vk.xml to 1.2.185, and ran `cargo update` to update other dependencies' patch versions.\n- Add support for EXTENDED_SRGB_NONLINEAR_EXT color space.\n- Better error message for wrong color space value\n- Added `impl BitOr` for `debug::MessageType` and `debug::MessageSeverity` and some bit field generators, also turning them into `const fn`.\n\n# Version 0.24.0 (2021-06-20)\n\n- **Breaking** Vulkano-shaders now checks if the device supports the shader's SPIR-V version, when loading the shader.\n- **Breaking** (but unlikely) Vulkano-shaders now compiles to SPIR-V 1.0 by default. If your shader needs features only available in a higher version, you can specify the target version on the `shader!` macro with the new `vulkan_version: \"major.minor\"` and `spirv_version: \"major.minor\"` arguments.\n- **Breaking** Changes to how image sample counts are represented.\n  - Instead of an integer, functions with a parameter for number of image samples now take a value of `SampleCount`, an enum with variants named `SampleN`, where `N` is a power-of-two integer. It can be converted to a Vulkan `SampleCountFlags`, and from an integer with `try_from`.\n  - `sample_counts` field is originally represented as u32 type, which is now represented by `SampleCounts` struct-type which is a boolean collection of supported `sample_counts`. It can be converted to and from a Vulkan `SampleCountFlags`.\n- **Breaking** Changes to shader interfaces and pipeline layouts.\n  - The module `descriptor::pipeline_layout` has been renamed to `pipeline::layout`.\n  - The trait `ShaderInterfaceDef` has been replaced by a simple struct `ShaderInterface`, and its `elements` method returns a slice instead of an iterator. This means you no longer need to define a new type for a shader interface. The accompanying type `ShaderInterfaceDefEntry` has been renamed to `ShaderInterfaceEntry` to match. The `ShaderInterfaceDefMatch` trait and `EmptyShaderInterfaceDef` struct have been removed.\n  - The trait `PipelineLayoutDesc` has also been converted into a struct, with methods `descriptor_sets` and `push_constants` which return slices. It is functionally equivalent to the old `RuntimePipelineDesc` type, which is now merged into it. The traits `PipelineLayoutSuperset`, `PipelineLayoutSetsCompatible` and `PipelineLayoutPushConstantsCompatible` have been integrated into this struct as well. The `EmptyPipelineDesc` trait has been replaced with an `::empty()` constructor.\n  - Consequently, functions that took a value of these traits now take a plain `ShaderInterface` or `PipelineLayoutDesc`. Types that had a type parameter for it no longer have it, e.g. `VertexDefinition`, `GraphicsEntryPoint`, `GraphicsEntryPointAbstract`, `PipelineLayout`.\n  - Now that `PipelineLayout` has no more type parameter, the trait `PipelineLayoutAbstract` is removed. The layout type parameter is also removed from `ComputePipeline` and `GraphicsPipeline`.\n  - `ComputeEntryPoint` and `GraphicsEntryPoint` now take a value specifying the push constants descriptor, instead of having a type parameter. The corresponding associated type on `EntryPointAbstract` has been removed.\n  - The `GraphicsEntryPointAbstract` trait has been removed. `GraphicsPipelineBuilder` now takes a `GraphicsEntryPoint` object directly, and has lifetime parameters for the 5 shader types instead. `EntryPointDummy` is no longer needed and has been removed.\n- **Breaking** The constructors of `Instance` now take an additional argument to specify the maximum API version.\n- **Breaking** Vulkano is now built on top of [Ash](https://github.com/MaikKlein/ash) instead of vk-sys.\n  - The `EntryPoints`, `InstancePointers` and `DevicePointers` types from vk-sys have been replaced with a new module `fns` containing `EntryFunctions`, `InstanceFunctions` and `DeviceFunctions`. Rather than containing the functions directly, there is a member for each Vulkan version and extension, which is loaded from Ash.\n  - The functions to retrieve the function pointers have been renamed to `fns`.\n  - The `TYPE` associated constant has been removed from the `VulkanObject` trait. This is now provided by the Ash `Handle` trait, which the object returned by `internal_object` must implement.\n- **Breaking** `RawInstanceExtensions` and `RawDeviceExtensions` have been removed. The `Instance` and `Device` constructors now take `&InstanceExtensions` and `&DeviceExtensions` respectively. The `loaded_extensions` function returns these reference types as well.\n- **Breaking** The restrictions of each enabled extension and feature are checked when creating an instance or device.\n- **Breaking** Physical device properties are now retrieved through a new `properties` method, returning a `&Properties` reference.\n  - To allow for the possibility that not every property is known by the physical device, fields in `Properties` are wrapped by an `Option`.\n  - The previous methods for retrieving properties, `name`, `ty`, `limits`, `driver_version`, `pci_device_id`, `pci_vendor_id`, `uuid` and `extended_properties`, have been removed.\n  - The `api_version` method remains, but there is now a semantic difference between it and the version reported by `properties`: The raw property gives the maximum supported version that the driver itself reports, while the method on `PhysicalDevice` returns the version a logical device would support if it were created from this physical device (that is, restricted by the instance's `max_api_version`).\n- **Breaking** `ImageAccess` trait method `try_gpu_lock()` now has an additional argument to allow locking the image in an uninitialized state.`\n- **Breaking** The `conflicts_buffer` and `conflicts_image` methods on the `BufferAccess` and `ImageAccess` traits are removed.\n- **Breaking** Draw and dispatch calls on `AutoCommandBufferBuilder` no longer have a parameter for dynamic offsets. Instead, they are provided as part of the descriptor sets parameter. They are added to each descriptor set individually using the new `offsets` method on the `DescriptorSet` trait. `SyncCommandBufferBuilder` and `StateCacher` likewise take dynamic offsets as part of the descriptor set.\n- **Breaking** `StencilFaceFlags` is renamed to `StencilFaces`, and its variants are also shortened.\n- **Breaking** `DynamicStencilValue` now contains a `front` and a `back` value.\n- **Breaking** The stencil state commands of `SyncCommandBufferBuilder` now take a `StencilFaces` value and a `u32` instead of `DynamicStencilValue`.\n- Improve `ImageLayout` checks to prevent `AccessError::ImageNotInitialized` from occurring where the image is safe to use uninitialized.\n- Added `DeviceExtensions::khr_spirv_1_4`, which allows SPIR-V 1.4 shaders in Vulkan 1.1.\n- Added `FunctionPointers::api_version` to query the highest supported instance version.\n- Added `Instance::api_version` and `Device::api_version` to return the actual supported Vulkan version. These may differ between instance and device, and be lower than what `FunctionPointers::api_version` and `PhysicalDevice::api_version` return.\n- Added `Instance::max_api_version`, which returns the maximum version that was specified when creating the instance.\n- Fixed the issue when creating a buffer with exportable fd on Linux(see to #1545).\n- The `draw_indirect` and `draw_indexed_indirect` commands on `AutoCommandBufferBuilder` now check the draw count against the `max_draw_indirect_count` limit.\n- Fixed a few documentation errors.\n- It is now possible to construct a graphics pipeline without a fragment shader.\n- Added support for all core Vulkan 1.1 and 1.2 device features.\n- Updated winit to 0.25.\n- Fixed the teapot example on ArchLinux (GTX 1650).\n- Added support for the SPIR-V draw parameters capability.\n- Added support for the VK_KHR_multiview extension. \n- Vulkano-shaders: Added support for MultiView SPIR-V capability.\n- Multiview example added showing how to utilize the VK_KHR_multiview extension to render to multiple layers of a framebuffer at once.\n- All Vulkan extensions supported by Ash are now provided in `InstanceExtensions` and `DeviceExtensions`. This includes all but the very newest extensions; new extensions should be added whenever Ash is updated to a new version.\n- Every extension is now documented with a link to its Vulkan page and information about requirements, conflicts, promotion and deprecation.\n- `InstanceExtensions` and `DeviceExtensions` now have a `From` implementation that takes an iterator of `&CStr`. There is also a `From` implementation for `Vec<CString>` that performs the reverse conversion.\n- All Vulkan features supported by Ash are now provided.\n- Implement fmt::Display for DisplayMode.\n- Clarify return value is in millihertz for DisplayMode.refresh_rate()\n- Reworked some of the internals of `SyncCommandBufferBuilder`, so that a mutex is no longer needed and resource conflict detection is simplified.\n- `Features::all` and `Features::none` are now `const fn`.\n\n# Version 0.23.0 (2021-04-10)\n\n- **Breaking** Changes to command buffers:\n  - `AutoCommandBuffer` and the `CommandBuffer` trait have been split in two, one for primary and the other for secondary command buffers. `AutoCommandBufferBuilder` remains one type, but has a type parameter for the level of command buffer it will be creating, and some of its methods are only implemented for builders that create `PrimaryAutoCommandBuffer`.\n  - The `Flags` enum is renamed to `CommandBufferUsage`, and is exported from the main `command_buffer` module. The `None` variant is renamed to `MultipleSubmit`.\n  - Simplified the number of constructors on `AutoCommandBufferBuilder` by adding a `CommandBufferUsage` parameter.\n  - `Kind` has been renamed to `CommandBufferLevel`, and for secondary command buffers it now contains a single `CommandBufferInheritance` value.\n  - `CommandBufferInheritance::occlusion_query` and `UnsafeCommandBufferBuilder::begin_query` now take `QueryControlFlags` instead of a boolean.\n- **Breaking** The non-default constructors of `ImageView` have been replaced with a builder, created with `ImageView::start(image)`.\n- **Breaking** Added support for component mapping/swizzling on image views.\n  - `image::Swizzle` is moved and renamed to `image::view::ComponentMapping`. It now has an `is_identity` method.\n  - A non-default component mapping can now be specified for image views, via the new builder. A `ComponentMapping` parameter has been added to `UnsafeImageView` as well.\n  - The `identity_swizzle` method on the `ImageViewAbstract` trait has been replaced with `component_mapping`, which returns a `ComponentMapping` directly.\n  - Storage image and input attachment descriptors now check for identity swizzling when being built.\n- **Breaking** Major rearranging of framebuffer and render pass-related types:\n  - The `framebuffer` module is renamed to `render_pass`.\n  - `RenderPassDesc` is now a struct, not a trait. The methods have been simplified, returning a slice reference to the `attachments`, `subpasses` and `dependencies`.\n    - Renamed: `AttachmentDescription` > `AttachmentDesc`, `PassDescription` > `SubpassDesc`, `PassDependencyDescription` > `SubpassDependencyDesc`.\n    - `EmptySinglePassRenderPassDesc` is replaced with the `RenderPassDesc::empty` constructor, or its `Default` implementation.\n    - The `RenderPassCompatible`, `RenderPassDescClearValues` and `RenderPassSubpassInterface` traits are removed, their functionality is moved to `RenderPassDesc`.\n  - `RenderPass` takes a concrete `RenderPassDesc` value for construction, and no longer has a type parameter.\n    - The `RenderPassAbstract` trait is removed.\n    - `GraphicsPipeline` and `Framebuffer` no longer have a render pass type parameter.\n    - `GraphicsPipelineAbstract` and `FramebufferAbstract` have trait methods to retrieve the render pass instead.\n  - The `ordered_passes_renderpass!` and `single_pass_renderpass!` macros are unchanged externally.\n- Support for queries:\n  - **Breaking** `UnsafeQueryPool`, `UnsafeQuery` and `UnsafeQueriesRange` have `Unsafe` removed from their names.\n  - **Breaking** `QueriesRange` is now represented with a standard Rust `Range` in its API.\n  - **Breaking** The secondary command buffer constructors that have parameters for queries will check if the corresponding features are enabled, and return a different error type.\n  - Removed `OcclusionQueriesPool`, which was incomplete and never did anything useful.\n  - `get_results` has been added to `QueriesRange`, to copy query results to the CPU.\n  - The following functions have been added to both `SyncCommandBufferBuilder` and `AutoCommandBufferBuilder`: `begin_query` (still unsafe), `end_query` (safe), `write_timestamp` (still unsafe), `copy_query_pool_results` (safe), `reset_command_pool` (still unsafe).\n  - Better documentation of everything in the `query` module.\n  - An example demonstrating occlusion queries.\n- **Breaking** Improved the handling of image aspects a little, with the enum `ImageAspect` and the struct `ImageAspects`. `UnsafeCommandBufferBuilderImageAspect` has been removed.\n- **Breaking** Removed the separate structs for each image format. Now, only the `Format` enum exists.\n  - Traits that no longer make sense in this context have been removed: `FormatDesc`, the `Possible*FormatDesc` traits, `StrongStorage`.\n  - In types that had a type parameter for the format type, it has been removed.\n  - `AcceptsPixels` has been converted to `Pixel`, which is implemented on the pixel type rather than on the format type.\n- **Breaking** `shader!` will generate descriptor information for all variables declared in the shader module, even if they are not used. *This reverts the default behavior from the last release.*\n  - **Breaking** Added the `exact_entrypoint_interface` option to `shader!` to force vulkano to only generate descriptor information for variables that are used. (the default behavior from the last release)\n- **Breaking** `AccessFlagBits` is renamed to `AccessFlags`.\n- **Breaking** Minor refactor of `UnsafeBuffer`:\n  - Replaced the various usage functions with a single `usage` function, mirroring the change made earlier to `UnsafeImage`.\n  - The `SparseLevel::sparse` member is removed, and `UnsafeBuffer::new` takes `Option<SparseLevel>` instead.\n- **Breaking** `Swapchain` is now constructed using a builder. `Swapchain::start` will start building a new blank swapchain. Calling `recreate` on an existing swapchain will create a builder filled with all the properties of the old swapchain.\n- Added two methods to `Format`: `planes` to query the number of planes in the format, and `aspects` to query what aspects an image of this type has.\n- The deprecated `cause` trait function on Vulkano error types is replaced with `source`.\n- Fixed bug in descriptor array layers check when the image is a cubemap.\n- Vulkano-shaders: Fixed and refined the generation of the `readonly` descriptor attribute. It should now correctly mark uniforms and sampled images as read-only, but storage buffers and images only if explicitly marked as `readonly` in the shader.\n- Vulkano-shaders: Added support for StoragePushConstant8 SPIR-V capability.\n- Fixed a bug which caused a segfault when extending memory allocation info in DeviceMemoryBuilder\n- `BufferlessDefinition` and `BufferlessVertices` now derive `Copy` and `Clone`. This allows `GraphicsPipelineBuilder`s that have not yet defined a vertex buffer type to be cloned.\n- Various functions for converting to/from Vulkan flags have been consolidated into implementations of the standard `From` trait.\n- Export root-level `entry_point` method on `loader::FunctionPointers` type.\n- Add few more `InstanceExtensions` from KHR and EXT.\n\n# Version 0.22.0 (2021-03-31)\n\n- **Breaking** Updated all code to Rust 2018 edition.\n- **Breaking** DeviceMemoryBuilder::new() takes in `memory_index` rather than `MemoryType`.\n- Fixed `shader!` generated descriptor set layouts for shader modules with multiple entrypoints.\n  - **Breaking** Prefixed `shader!` generated descriptor set `Layout` structs with the name of the entrypoint the layout belongs to. For shaders generated from GLSL source, this means `Layout` has been renamed to `MainLayout`.\n  - **Breaking** `shader!` will no longer generate descriptor information for variables that are declared but not used in a shader.\n- **Breaking** `shader!` now accepts structs in shader interfaces decorated with `BufferBlock` rather than `Block`.\n- Fixed missing barriers in dispatch calls\n  - **Breaking** `shader!` no longer marks descriptor sets as readonly as a fallback when it doesn't know\n    - **Breaking** The keyword `readonly` might need to be added in front of the `buffer` keyword in GLSL files to get them working again\n- **Breaking** Changes to image types:\n  - Image types no longer implement `ImageViewAccess`.\n  - `Dimensions` is removed. Image constructors now take `ImageDimensions`.\n  - `ImageDimensions` no longer has the `cubemap_compatible` member. Instead, several image constructors take `ImageCreateFlags` which specifies this aspect.\n  - Replaced the various functions of `UnsafeImage` to query format features and usage with two that simply return `Formatfeatures` and `ImageUsage`.\n- **Breaking** Changes to image view handling:\n  - Created a new `image::view` module for all image view related things.\n  - Introduced a new `ImageView` type, a safe wrapper around `UnsafeImageView`.\n  - The `ImageViewAccess` trait is renamed to `ImageViewAbstract`, some methods added, removed or renamed. `ImageView` implements this trait.\n  - `UnsafeImageView` no longer holds image usage information, nor does it check for valid usage.\n- **Breaking** `UnsafeCommandBuffer` and `SyncCommandBuffer` and their corresponding builders and other related types no longer have a type parameter for the command pool allocation, and no longer keep the command pool alive. Their constructors now take an `&UnsafeCommandPoolAlloc`. Users must now ensure that the pool allocation outlives the command buffers and their builders (`AutoCommandBuffer` does this itself).\n- **Breaking** The `CommandBuffer` trait no longer has the `PoolAlloc` associated type, and has four new methods: `num_buffers`, `buffer`, `num_images` and `image`.\n- **Breaking** structures passed to `ImmutableBuffer::from_data` and `CpuAccessibleBuffer::from_data` must implement [`Copy`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Copy.html) to ensure soundness of these functions\n- Replaced deprecated `compare_and_swap` with `compare_exchange`.\n- `UnsafeCommandPoolAlloc` now implements `DeviceOwned`.\n- Allow `const` usage of features and `BufferUsage`.\n- Opaque fd and dma-buf import support on `Linux`.\n- `DeviceMemoryMapping` to separate device memory and mappings.\n- Added external memory support for `DeviceLocalBuffer` for Linux.\n- Implemented synchronization for `SyncCommandBufferBuilder::execute_commands`.\n- `AutoCommandBufferBuilder::execute_commands` is now fully safe to use.\n- `SyncCommandBufferBuilder` now becomes poisoned when it returns an error, to prevent using the builder in an inconsistent state.\n- Added a `dispatch_indirect` command to `AutoCommandBufferBuilder`.\n\n# Version 0.21.0 (2021-03-05)\n\n- **Breaking** `Message::layer_prefix` turned to Option to prevent segfaults when Vulkan message didn't provide `pMessageIdName` value\n- **Breaking** On `AutoCommandBufferBuilder`, methods that bind a descriptor set now take a `dynamic_offsets` parameter\n- **Breaking** On `AutoCommandBufferBuilder` and `SyncCommandBufferBuilder`, the `update_buffer` method now takes `data` by reference\n- **Breaking** Made `PipelineLayoutDescTweaks` public, for use with compute pipelines\n- Added support for `ImageAspect` and YV12/NV12 formats,  for use with the UnsafeImage API.\n- Added basic VK_KHR_external_memory, VK_KHR_external_memory_fd, and VK_EXT_external_memory_dma_buf support.\n- Fixed potential segmentation fault in `ComputePipeline` when referencing `PipelineCache` objects.\n- Fixed race condition in `StandardCommandPool` when allocating buffers.\n- Fixed potential stack overflow error in loading large shaders by storing the bytecode as static.\n- Fixed descriptor set layouts with arrays containing more than one element triggering unreachable code.\n- Fixed panic on some machines when calling `Surface::capabilities`\n- Added basic support and safety checks for dynamic uniform/storage buffers\n- Updated dependencies:\n  -

If the buffer encountered an error while locking the necessary resources, it would unlock all previously locked resources. Images were unlocked incorrectly and an assert in the image unlock function would panic.\n- Added support for including precompiled shaders in vulkano-shaders using the `bytes` option.\n- Added an option for Vulkano-Shaders macro to automatically generate standard\n  traits(Default, PartialEq, etc) implementations for Rust types generated from\n  the Shader types, and to derive these structs with external traits.\n- Fixed clear `Cubemap` and `CubemapArray` framebuffer attachment dimensions; previously only 1/6th of the layers in each of these image layouts were actually considered by the framebuffer (for clearing and rendering). This seems to have been a result of the difference between `Dimensions` and `ImageDimensions`.\n\n# Version 0.19.0 (2020-06-01)\n\n- **Breaking** AutoCommandBufferBuilder methods now take a mutable reference to `self` instead of taking ownership\n- Update `smallvec` 1.2 -> 1.4\n- Added additional `ImageUsage` constructor functions, `color_attachment`, `depth_stencil_attachment`, `transient_color_attachment` & `transient_depth_stencil_attachment`.\n- Update dependency `half` 1.5 -> 1.6\n- Update MacOS dependency `metal` 0.17 -> 0.18\n- Added additional checks around image/device compatibility.\n- Fixed all warnings as of Rust 1.43.1\n- Provides new API to fetch additional information of the Physical Device from the `PhysicalDeviceProperties2KHR` structure whenever it possible. In the current implementation only `subgroupSize` property is fetching. This interface can be extended in the future to obtain more metadata depending on community needs.\n- `dynamic-local-size` compute shader example added showing how to utilize `subgroupSize` to compute and set shader's local size in run time.\n- Fixed Vulkano Shaders bug when compute shader local group layout values bound to specialization constants. Now it is possible to define the layout in form of `layout(local_size_x_id = 12, local_size_y_id = 13, local_size_z = 1) in;` and then set the values as `SpecializationConstants {constant_12: 8, constant_13: 4, ...}`.\n- Allow applications to access the instance and device pointers\n- Add a helper function '.boxed()' on the `GpuFuture` that is short for `Box::new(yourFuture) as Box<dyn GpuFuture>`\n\n# Version 0.18.0 (2020-03-11)\n\n- **Breaking** Update dependency `winit` 0.21 -> 0.22\n- Update dependency `half` 1.4 -> 1.5\n- Update dependency `smallvec` 0.6 -> 1.2\n\n# Version 0.17.0 (2020-02-09)\n\n- **Breaking** Swapchain::recreate_with_dimension() is now Swapchain::recreate_with_dimensions()\n- **Breaking** Sync::SharingMode::Exclusive(queue_family: u32) is now Sync::SharingMode::Exclusive.\n- **Breaking** Added Swapchain::with_old_swapchain() - same as previous Swapchain::new(), if an oldswapchain needs to be used\n- **Breaking** Swapchain::new() now doesnt need to have the old_swapchain parameter anymore but requires the ColorSpace\n- **Breaking** Decouple descriptor sets from pipeline\n- **Breaking** Update Winit to 0.21.0\n- **Breaking** Add `host_cached` field to all `CpuAccessibleBuffer` initializers to allow the user to prefer host cached memory.\n- **Breaking** Added `fullscreen_exclusive` field to `Swapchain` initializers to allow the user to specify how fullscreen exclusivity should be handled.\n    + Swapchain methods added: `Swapchain::acquire_fullscreen_exclusive()`, `Swapchain::release_fullscreen_exclusive()`, and `Swapchain::is_fullscreen_exclusive()`\n- Add function `execute_commands_from_vec` to handle submission of multiple secondary command buffers.\n- Allow `DebugCallback` to be sent between threads\n- Pipeline barriers are now correctly inserted when a resource is used more than two times.\n- Update MacOS dependency cocoa to 0.20\n- Fixed code generated by `shader!` macro so that SSBO's are supported again (broken in 0.16.0).\n- Added Swapchain::surface() - which returns the saved surface\n- Propagate new lines correctly in shader compile errors.\n- `Queue` and `QueueFamily` now implement `PartialEq` and `Eq`\n- `Swapchain::acquire_next_image()`` now returns ``(image_id, suboptimal, acquire_future)``\n    + *suboptimal indicates that the swapchain is usable, but should be recreated*\n- Fixed Join Future implementation to not submit joined command buffers twice.\n- The traits `GraphicsPipelineAbstract` and `DescriptorSet` now require `DeviceOwned`.\n- Added `PartialEq`, `Eq` and `Hash` implementations to all types involved in a draw call, including:\n  - `Instance`, `Device`, `GraphicsPipeline` and `dyn GraphicsPipelineAbstract`\n  - `UnsafeBuffer` and all types implementing `BufferAccess`\n  - `UnsafeImage`, `UnsafeImageView` and all types implementing `ImageAccess` or `ImageViewAccess`\n  - All types implementing `DescriptorSet`\n\n# Version 0.16.0 (2019-11-01)\n\n- Fixed bug in examples causing OutOfHostMemory errors\n- Replaced `VK_EXT_debug_report` `VK_EXT_debug_marker` with `VK_EXT_debug_utils`.\n- Update MacOS dependencies metal to 0.17 and cocoa to 0.19\n- Added dynamic stencil elements to `DynamicState`\n- Fixed `ImageDimensions::mipmap_dimensions` and `max_mipmaps` in cases where the original size is not a power of two.\n- Shader includes now work on Windows.\n- **Breaking Change** Shader include directories passed to the `shader!` macro are now relative to the crates `Cargo.toml`\n- Add support for `VK_KHR_16bit_storage` and `VK_KHR_storage_buffer_storage_class` device extensions.\n- Update dependencies: lazy_static, half, syn, quote & proc-macro2\n- Swapchain can now be recreated with dimensions of corresponding surface using `recreate()`.\n- Added `raw_loaded_extensions()` to `Instance` to allow querying of all extensions, not just known ones.\n- **Breaking Change** `loaded_extensions()` on `Instance` no longer returns a reference.\n- Add support for GLSL macro defines to the `shader!` macro.\n- Switch to Vulkan 1.1 and inherently SpirV 1.3 (shaderc default version for vulkan 1.1)\n\n# Version 0.15.0 (2019-10-18)\n\n*Yanked*\n\n# Version 0.14.0 (2019-08-17)\n\n- Update shaderc to 0.6.

          "content": "This document contains the global design decisions made by the vulkano library. It can also be a\ngood start if you want to contribute to some internal parts of vulkano and don't know how it works.\n\nThis document assumes that you're already familiar with Vulkan and does not introduce the various\nconcepts. However it can still be a good read if you are not so familiar.\n\nIf you notice any mistake, feel free to open a PR. If you want to suggest something, feel free to\nopen a PR as well.\n\n# The three kinds of objects\n\nVulkano provides wrappers around all objects of the Vulkan API. However these objects are split in\nthree categories, depending on their access pattern:\n\n- Objects that are not created often and in very small numbers.\n- Objects that are typically created at initialization and which are often accessed without mutation\n  by performance-critical code.\n- Objects that are created, destroyed or modified during performance-critical code, and that\n  usually require a synchronization strategy to avoid race conditions.\n\nThe first category are objects that are not created often and created in very small numbers:\nInstances, Devices, Surfaces, Swapchains. In a typical application each of these objects is only\ncreated once and destroyed when the application exits. Vulkano's API provides a struct that\ncorresponds to each of these objects, and this struct is typically wrapped in an `Arc`.\nTheir `new` method in fact returns an `Arc<T>` instead of just a `T` in order to encourage users to\nuse `Arc`s. You use these objects by cloning them around like you would use objects in a\ngarbage-collected language such as Java.\n\nThe second category are objects like the GraphicsPipeline, ComputePipeline, PipelineLayout,\nRenderPass and Framebuffer. They are usually created at initialization and don't perform any\noperations themselves, but they describe to the Vulkan implementation operations that we are going\nto perform and are thus frequently accessed in order to determine whether the operation that the\nvulkano user requested is compliant to what was described. Just like the first category, each of\nthese objects has a struct that corresponds to them, but in order to make these checks as fast as\npossible these structs have a template parameter that describes in a strongly-typed fashion the\noperation on the CPU side. This makes it possible to move many checks to compile-time instead of\nruntime. More information in another section of this document.\n\nThe third category are objects like CommandBuffers, CommandPools, DescriptorSets, DescriptorPools,\nBuffers, Images, and memory pools (although not technically a Vulkan object). The way they are\nimplemented has a huge impact on the performance of the application. Contrary to the first two\ncategories, each of these objects is represented in vulkano by an unsafe trait (and not by a\nstruct) that can be freely implemented by the user if they wish. Vulkano provides unsafe structs\nsuch as `UnsafeBuffer`, `UnsafeImage`, etc. which have zero overhead and do not perform any safety\nchecks, and are the tools used by the safe implementations of the traits. Vulkano also provides\nsome safe implementations for convenience such as `CpuAccessibleBuffer` or `AttachmentImage`.\n\n# Runtime vs compile-time checks\n\nThe second category of objects described above are objects that describe to the Vulkan\nimplementation an operation that we are going to perform later. For example a `ComputePipeline`\nobject describes to the Vulkan implementation a compute operation and contains the shader's code\nand the list of resources that we are going to bind and that are going to be accessed by the shader.\n\nSince vulkano is a safe library, it needs to check whether the operation the user requests (eg.\nexecuting a compute operation) matches the corresponding `ComputePipeline` (for example, check\nthat the list of resources passed by the user matches what the compute pipeline expects).\nThese checks can be expensive. For example when it comes to buffers, vulkano needs to check whether\nthe layout of the buffers passed by the user is the same as what is expected, by looping through all\nthe members and following several indirections. If you multiply this by several dozens or hundreds\nof operations, it can become very expensive.\n\nIn order to reduce the stress caused by these checks, structs such as `ComputePipeline` have a\ntemplate parameter which describes the operation. Whenever vulkano performs a check, it queries\nthe templated object through a trait, and each safety check has its own trait. This means\nthat we can build strongly-typed objects at compile-time that describe a very precise operation and\nwhose method implementations are trivial. For example, we can create a `MyComputeOpDesc` type which\nimplements the `ResourcesListMatch<MyResourcesList>` trait (which was made up for the sake of the\nexample), and the user will only be able to pass a `MyResourcesList` object for the list of\nresources. This moves the check to compile-time and totally eliminates any runtime check. The\ncompute pipeline is then expressed as `ComputePipeline<MyComputeOpDesc>`.\n\nHowever this design has a drawback, which is that is can be difficult to explicitly express such a\ntype. A compute pipeline in the example above could be expressed as\n`ComputePipeline<MyComputeOpDesc>`, but in practice these types (like `MyComputeOpDesc`) would be\nbuilt by builders and can become extremely long and annoying to put in a struct (just like for\nexample the type of `(10..).filter(|n| n*2).skip(3).take(5)` can be very long and annoying to put\nin a struct). This is especially problematic as it concerns objects that are usually created at\ninitialization and stay alive for a long time, in other words the kind of objects that you would\nput in a struct.\n\nIn order to solve this naming problem, all the traits that are used to describe operations must be\nboxable so that we can turn `ComputePipeline<Very<Long<And<Complicated, Type>>>>` into\n`ComputePipeline<Box<ComputePipelineDesc>>`. This means that we can't use associated types and\ntemplates for any of the trait methods. Ideologically it is a bit annoying to have to restrict\nourselves in what we can do just because the user needs to be able to write out the precise type,\nbut it's the only pragmatic solution for now.\n\n# Submissions\n\nAny object that can be submitted to a GPU queue (for example a command buffer) implements\nthe `Submit` trait.\n\nThe `Submit` trait provides a function named `build` which returns a `Submission<Self>` object\n(where `Self` is the type that implements the `Submit` trait). The `Submission` object must be kept\nalive by the user for as long as the GPU hasn't finished executing the submission. Trying to\ndestroy a `Submission` will block until it is the case. Since the `Submission` holds the object\nthat was submitted, this object is also kept alive for as long as the GPU hasn't finished executing\nit.\n\nFor the moment submitting an object always creates a fence, which is how the `Submission` knows\nwhether the GPU has finished executing it. Eventually this will need to be modified for the sake of\nperformance.\n\nIn order to make the `Submit` trait safer to implement, the method that actually needs to be\nimplemented is not `build` but `append_submission`. This method uses a API/lifetime trick to\nguarantee that the GPU only executes command buffers that outlive the struct that implements\n`Submit`.\n\nSAFETY ISSUE HERE HOWEVER: the user can use mem::forget on the Submission and then drop the\nobjects referenced by it. There are two solutions to this: either store a bunch of Arc<Fence> in\nevery single object referenced by submissions (eg. pipeline objects), or force the user to use\neither Arcs or give ownership of the object. The latter is preferred but not yet implemented.\n\n# Pools\n\nThere are three kinds of pools in vulkano: memory pools, descriptor pools, and command pools. Only\nthe last two are technically Vulkan concepts, but using a memory pool is also a very common\npattern that you are strongly encouraged to embrace when you write a Vulkan application.\n\nThese three kinds of pools are each represented in vulkano by a trait. When you use the Vulkan API,\nyou are expected to create multiple command pools and multiple descriptor pools for maximum\nperformance. In vulkano however, it is the implementation of the pool trait that is responsible\nfor managing multiple actual pool objects. In other words a pool in vulkano is just a trait that\nprovides a method to allocate or free some resource, and the advanced functionality of Vulkan\npools (like resetting a command buffer, resetting a pool, or managing the descriptor pool's\ncapacity) is handled internally by the implementation of the trait. For example freeing a\ncommand buffer can be implemented by resetting it and reusing it, instead of actually freeing it.\n\nOne of the goals of vulkano is to be easy to use by default. Therefore vulkano provides a default\nimplementation for each of these pools, and the `new` constructors of types that need a pool (ie.\nbuffers, images, descriptor sets, and command buffers) will use the default implementation. It is\npossible for the user to use an alternative implementation of a pool by using an alternative\nconstructor, but the default implementations should be good for most usages. This is similar to\nmemory allocators in languages such as C++ and Rust, in the sense that some users want to be able\nto use a custom allocator but most of the time it's not worth bothering with that.\n\n# Command buffers\n\nCommand buffer objects belong to the last category of objects that were described above. They are\nrepresented by an unsafe trait and can be implemented manually by the user if they wish.\n\nHowever this poses a practical problem, which is that creating a command buffer in a safe way\nis really complicated. There are tons of commands to implement, and each command has a ton of\nsafety requirements. If a user wants to create a custom command buffer type, it is just not an\noption to ask them to reimplement these safety checks themselves.\n\nThe reason why users may want to create their own command buffer types is to implement\nsynchronization themselves. Vulkano's default implementation (which is `AutobarriersCommandBuffer`)\nwill automatically place pipeline barriers in order to handle cache flushes and image layout\ntransitions and avoid data races, but this automatic computation can be seen as expensive.\n\nIn order to make it possible to customize the synchronization story of command buffers, vulkano has\nsplit the command buffer building process in two steps. First the user builds a list of commands\nthrough an iterator-like API (and vulkano will check their validity), and then they are turned into\na command buffer through a trait. This means that the user can customize the synchronization\nstrategy (by customizing the second step) while still using the same command-building process\n(the first step). Commands are not opinionated towards one strategy or another. The\ncommand-building code is totally isolated from the synchronization strategy and only checks\nwhether the commands themselves are valid.\n\nThe fact that all the commands are added at once can be a little surprising for a user coming from\nVulkan. Vulkano's API looks very similar to Vulkan's API, but there is a major difference: in\nVulkan the cost of creating a command buffer is distributed between each function call, but in\nvulkano it is done all at once. For example creating a command buffer with 6 commands with Vulkan\nrequires 8 function calls that take say 5µs each, while creating the same command buffer with\nvulkano requires 8 function calls, but the first 7 are almost free and the last one takes 40µs.\nAfter some thinking, it was considered to not be a problem.\n\nCreating a list of commands with an iterator-like API has the problem that the type of the list of\ncommands changes every time you add a new command to the list\n(just like for example `let iterator = iterator.skip(1)` changes the type of `iterator`). This is\na problem in situations where we don't know at compile-time the number of commands that we are\ngoing to add. In order to solve this, it is required that the `CommandsList` trait be boxable,\nso that the user can use a `Box<CommandsList>`. This is unfortunately not optimal as you will need\na memory allocation for each command that is added to the list. The situation here could still be\nimproved.\n\n# The auto-barriers builder\n\nAs explained above, the default implementation of a command buffer provided by vulkano\nautomatically places pipeline barriers to avoid issues such as caches not being flushed, commands\nbeing executed simultaneously when they shouldn't, or images having the wrong layout.\n\nThis is not an easy job, because Vulkan allows lots of weird access patterns that we want to make\navailable in vulkano. You can for example create a buffer object split into multiple sub-buffer\nobjects, or make some images and buffers share the same memory.\n\nIn order to make it possible to handle everything properly, the `Buffer` and `Image` traits need to\nhelp us with the `conflicts` methods. Each buffer and image can be queried to know whether it\npotentially uses the same memory as any other buffer or image. When two resources conflict, this\nmeans that you can't write to one and read from the other one simultaneously or write to both\nsimultaneously.\n\nBut we don't want to check every single combination of buffer and image every time to check whether\nthey conflict. So in order to improve performance, buffers and images also need to provide a key\nthat identifies them. Two resources that can potentially conflict must always return the same key.\nThe regular `conflict` functions are still necessary to handle the situation where buffers or\nimages accidentally return the same key but don't actually conflict.\n\nThis conflict system is also used to make sure that the attachments of a framebuffer don't conflict\nwith each other or that the resources in a descriptor set don't conflict with each other (both\nsituations are forbidden).\n\n# Image layouts\n\nTracking image layouts can be tedious. Vulkano uses a simple solution, which is that images must\nalways be in a specific layout at the beginning and the end of a command buffer. If a transition\nis performed during a command buffer, the image must be transitioned back before the end of the\ncommand buffer. The layout in question is queried with a method on the `Image` trait.\n\nFor example an `AttachmentImage` must always be in the `ColorAttachmentOptimal` layout for color\nattachment, and the `DepthStencilAttachmentOptimal` layout for depth-stencil attachments. If any\ncommand switches the image to another layout, then it will need to be switched back before the end\nof the command buffer.\n\nThis system works very nicely in practice, and unnecessary layout transitions almost never happen.\nThe only situation where unnecessary transitions tend to happen in practice is for swapchain images\nthat are transitioned from `PresentSrc` to `ColorAttachmentOptimal` before the start of the\nrender pass, because the initial layout of the render pass attachment is `ColorAttachmentOptimal`\nby default for color attachments. Vulkano should make it clear in the documentation of render\npasses that the user is encouraged to specify when an attachment is expected to be in the\n`PresentSrc` layout.\n\nThe only problematic area concerns the first usage of an image, where it must be transitioned from\nthe `Undefined` or `Preinitialized` layout. This is done by making the user pass a command buffer\nbuilder in the constructor of images, and the constructor adds a transition command to it. The\nimage implementation is responsible for making sure that the transition command has been submitted\nbefore any further command that uses the image.\n\n# Inter-queue synchronization\n\nWhen users submit two command buffers to two different queues, they expect the two command buffers\nto execute in parallel. However this is forbidden if doing so could result in a data race,\nlike for example if one command buffer writes to an image and the other one reads from that same\nimage.\nIn this situation, the only possible technical solution is to make the execution of the second\ncommand buffer block until the first command buffer has finished executing.\nThis case is similar to spawning two threads that each access the same resource protected by\na `RwLock` or a `Mutex`. One of the two threads will need to block until the first one is finished.\n\nThis raises the question: should vulkano implicitly block command buffers to avoid data races,\nor should it force the user to explicitly add wait operations? By comparing a CPU-side\nmultithreaded program and a GPU-side multithreaded program, then the answer is to make it implicit,\nas a CPU will also implicitly block when calling a function that happens to lock a `Mutex` or\na `RwLock`. In CPU code, these locking problems are always \"fixed\" by properly documenting the\nbehavior of the functions you call. Similarly, vulkano should precisely document its behavior.\n\nMore generally users are encouraged to avoid sharing resources between multiple queues unless these\nresources are read-only, and in practice in a video game it is indeed rarely needed to share\nresources between multiple queues. Just like for CPU-side multithreading, users are encouraged to\nhave a graph of the ways queues interact with each other.\n\nHowever another problem arises. In order to make a command buffer wait for another, you need to\nmake the queue of the first command buffer submit a semaphore after execution, and the queue of\nthe second command buffer wait on that same semaphore before execution. Semaphores can only be used\nonce. This means that when you submit a command buffer to a queue, you must already know if any\nother command buffers are going to wait on the one you are submitting, and if so how many. This is not\nsomething that vulkano can automatically determine. The fact that there is therefore no optimal\nalgorithm for implicit synchronization would be a good point in favor of explicit synchronization.\n\nThe decision was taken to encourage users to explicitly handle synchronization between multiple\nqueues, but if they forget to do so then vulkano will automatically fall back to a dumb\nworst-case-scenario but safe behavior. Whenever this dumb behavior is triggered, a debug message\nis outputted by vulkano with the `vkDebugReportMessageEXT` function. This message can easily be\ncaught by the user by registering a callback, or with a debugger.\n\nIt is yet to be determined what exactly the user needs to handle. The user will at least need to\nspecify an optional list of semaphores to signal at each submission, but maybe not the list of\nsemaphores to wait upon if these can be determined automatically. This has yet to be seen.\n"

In the case of Vulkan, this means that non-unsafe code\nshould always conform to valid API usage.\n\nWhat does vulkano do?\n\n- Provides a low-levelish API around Vulkan. It doesn't hide what it does but provides some\n  comfort types.\n- Plans to prevent all invalid API usages, even the most obscure ones. The purpose of Vulkano\n  is not to simply let you draw a teapot, but to cover all possible usages of Vulkan and detect all\n  the possible problems in order to write robust programs. Invalid API usage is prevented thanks to\n  both compile-time checks and runtime checks.\n- Can handle synchronization on the GPU side for you (unless you choose to do that yourself), as this\n  aspect of Vulkan is both annoying to handle and error-prone. Dependencies between submissions are\n  automatically detected, and semaphores are managed automatically. The behavior of the library can\n  be customized thanks to unsafe trait implementations.\n- Tries to be convenient to use. Nobody is going to use a library that requires you to browse\n  the documentation for hours for every single operation.\n\n### Comparison\n\nComparison to other well-known Graphics APIs in Rust ecosystem.\n\n| Name | Open-sourced Since | API Level | Notable Features |\n| ---- | ------------------ | --------- | ------------- |\n| Vulkano | March, 2016 | High-level Rust API wrapping Vulkan APIs. | Type-safe compile-time shaders.

As such we can recommend using any of them in the 3rd party code.\nThe choice depends on the end project's goals and requirements, and we recommend examining\ntheir actual set of features and API capabilities beforehand.\n\n### Projects using Vulkano\n\nWe started collecting this list just recently and it would be appreciated if you help us by\ncontributing(opening a PR) into [README.md](https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/blob/master/README.md).\n\n| Project Name | Description |\n| ------------ | ----------- |\n| [Basalt](https://github.com/AustinJ235/basalt) | GUI framework for Desktop applications |\n| [Egui Winit Vulkano](https://github.com/hakolao/egui_winit_vulkano) | Vulkano integration with Egui |\n| [Ferret](https://github.com/Rua/ferret) | Doom-compatible game engine |\n| [Korangar](https://github.com/vE5li/korangar) | A Vulkan based Ragnarok Online client |\n| [Krnl](https://github.com/charles-r-earp/krnl) | Safe, portable, high performance compute (GPGPU) kernels. |\n| [Sandbox](https://github.com/hakolao/sandbox) | 2D Pixel Physics Simulator |\n| [Steel](https://github.com/SSSxCCC/steel) | The Steel Game Engine. |\n| [Vera](https://github.com/Coddeus/vera) | Animation engine scripted in Rust. |\n| [VideowindoW](https://www.videowindow.eu/) | Uses Vulkano under the hood to enable asynchronous video stream compositing |\n\nWe would love to help you keep your project in sync with the most recent changes in Vulkano\nif you give us feedback by adding your project to this list.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n## Documentation and Resources\n\nTo get started you are encouraged to use the following resources:\n\n- The [examples](https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/tree/master/examples) folder in this repository.\n - [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/vulkano) - Full Vulkano API documentation\n - The guide on [vulkano.rs](https://vulkano.rs/01-introduction/01-introduction.html) - Starts with trivial compute\n   examples (~50 lines of code) and then works up to rendering triangles and mandelbrots.\n   The guide is currently outdated a little. We are planning to update it in the future, but it's\n   a good place to start understanding the base building blocks of Vulkano API.\n - GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues) - Raise a topic, ask a question\n   or report a bug. The new topics there are watched regularly by maintainers and other\n   community users.\n - Gitter [Chat](https://gitter.im/vulkano-rs/Lobby) - Another place to raise a question. However,\n   the chat is not maintained regularly at this moment. Better use GitHub Issues for this purpose.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are very welcome! Feel free to submit pull requests, to open questions and topics\nin the [Issues](https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano/issues) section.\n\nThe project was initially developed by Pierre Krieger(Tomaka), who established Vulkano's base\ndesign goals, and the code structure. In the meantime, development is driven by Vulkano\ncommunity members.\n\n**New Pull Requests are usually scheduled for review by the end of each week.**\nThe older PRs that are already in review have priority over the new ones. We are trying to push\ndevelopment forward as quick as possible, but the review process sometimes takes time,\nplease be patient as the maintainers need time to check everything properly.\n\nIf something needs to get promoted urgently, please ping current Vulkano\nmaintainer([@Eliah-Lakhin](https://github.com/Eliah-Lakhin/)) in the PR's\nor Issue's comments.\n\nIf your change adds, removes or modifies a trait or a function, please\nspecify changelog entries **in the Pull Request description**(not in the changelog file directly).\nThey will be transferred to the changelog right after the PR merge.\n\nEvery PR must pass tests in order to be merged to `master`.\n\nMinor releases are usually happening between 1 to 3 months averagely depending on grow\nof unreleased and breaking changes in `master`\n\n### Repository Structure\n\nThis repository contains four libraries:\n\n- `vulkano` is the main one.\n- `vulkano-shaders` provides the `shader!` macro for compiling glsl shaders.\n- `vulkano-util` provides a variety of utility functions to streamline certain common operations such as device and swapchain creation.\n- `vulkano-win` provides a safe link between vulkano and the `winit` library which can create\n  a window to render to.\n\nIn order to run tests, run `cargo test --all` at the root of the repository. Make sure your Vulkan\ndriver is up to date before doing so.\n\n### Hall of Fame\n\nWe would love to mention some members, who put significant contributions to this project:\n- Pierre Krieger. The initial developer. [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/tomaka).\n- Lucas Kent. Maintainer. [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/rukai).\n- Austin Johnson. Maintainer. [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/austinj235).\n- Rua. An active developer, who put a lot of effort to improve Vulkano and constantly keeping it up to date.\n- **You!** Thanks to your help, contributions, improvements, bug reports and user experience\n  to make this project one of the major Rust graphics API library in Rust!\n\n## Setup and Troubleshooting\n\nVulkano uses [shaderc-rs](https://github.com/google/shaderc-rs) for shader compilation.  Refer to shaderc-rs documentation to provide a pre-built libshaderc for faster build times.\n\nNote that in general vulkano does **not** require you to install the official Vulkan SDK. This is\nnot something specific to vulkano (you don't need the SDK to write programs that use Vulkan, even\nwithout vulkano), but many people are unaware of that and install the SDK thinking that it is\nrequired. However, macOS, iOS and tvOS platforms do require a little more Vulkan setup since it is not\nnatively supported. See below for more details.\n\nUnless you provide libshaderc, in order to build libshaderc with the shaderc-sys crate, the following tools must be installed and available on `PATH`:\n- [CMake](https://cmake.org/)\n- [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) Is optional except when building with MSVC.  It may speed up build time for libshaderc.\n- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (works with both Python 2.x and 3.x, on windows the executable must be named `python.exe`)\n\nThese requirements can be either installed with your favourite package manager or with installers\nfrom the projects' websites. Below are some examples of ways to set up.\n\n### windows-msvc Specific Setup\n\n1. `rustup default stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`\n2. Install [Build Tools for Visual Studio 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2017). If you have already been using this toolchain then its probably already installed.\n3.  Install [msys2](https://www.msys2.org/), following ALL of the instructions.\n4.  Then in the msys2 terminal run: `pacman --noconfirm -Syu mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-x86_64-python2 mingw-w64-x86_64-ninja`\n5.  Add the msys2 mingw64 binary path to the PATH environment variable.\n\n### Windows-gnu Specific Setup\n\nwindows-gnu toolchain is not supported but you can instead cross-compile to windows-gnu from windows-msvc\n\nSteps 1 and 2 are to workaround https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/49078 by using the same mingw that rust uses.\n\n1.  Download and extract https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/rust-lang-ci2/rust-ci-mirror/x86_64-6.3.0-release-posix-seh-rt_v5-rev2.7z\n2.  Add the absolute path to mingw64\\bin to your PATH environment variable. (This path needs to be before the msys2 path)\n3.  Run the command: `rustup default stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`\n4.  Run the command: `rustup target install x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`\n5.  Install [Build Tools for Visual Studio 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2017). If you have already been using this toolchain then it's probably already installed.\n6.  Install [msys2](https://www.msys2.org/), following ALL of the instructions.\n7.  Then in the msys2 terminal run: `pacman --noconfirm -Syu mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-pkg-config mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-x86_64-make mingw-w64-x86_64-python2 mingw-w64-x86_64-ninja`\n8.  Add the msys2 mingw64 binary path to the PATH environment variable.\n9.  Any cargo command that builds the project needs to include `--target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` e.g. to run: `cargo run --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`\n\n### Linux Specific Setup\n\nUse your package manager to install the required dev-tools and Vulkan drivers\n\nFor example on ubuntu:\n```\nsudo apt-get install build-essential git python cmake libvulkan-dev vulkan-tools\n```\nOn arch based system\n```\nsudo pacman -Sy base-devel git python cmake vulkan-devel --noconfirm\n```\n\n### macOS, iOS and tvOS Specific Setup\n\nVulkan is not natively supported by macOS, iOS and tvOS. However, there exists [MoltenVK](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK)\nan open-source Vulkan implementation on top of Apple's Metal API. This allows vulkano to build and run on macOS, iOS and tvOS platforms.\n\nThe easiest way to get vulkano up and running with MoltenVK is to install the\n[Vulkan SDK for macOS](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home). There are [installation instructions](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/sdk/latest/mac/getting_started.html) on the LunarG website.\n\nOn iOS and tvOS, vulkano links directly to the MoltenVK framework. There is nothing else to do besides\ninstalling it. Note that the Vulkan SDK for macOS also comes with the framework for iOS and tvOS.\n\n## License\n\nLicensed under either of\n\n- Apache License, Version 2.0 ([LICENSE-APACHE](LICENSE-APACHE) or\n  https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\n- MIT license ([LICENSE-MIT](LICENSE-MIT) or https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n\nat your option.\n\n### Contribution\n\nUnless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted\nfor inclusion in the work by you shall be dual licensed as above, without any\nadditional terms or conditions.\n"

          "content": "# Troubles encountered with Rust during the making of this library\n\n- No way to store an object and its borrowing in the same struct. This is the reason why the whole API uses `Arc`s.\n\n- Lack of plugins means that you have to use a build script to compile your shaders instead of inlining them directly where they are used.\n  In addition to this, lots of existing macros would be much simpler to implement with plugins. The code generated by macros is currently\n  inefficient because using the efficient way would make the code very difficult to read.\n\n- Having a trait that defines which types can be put inside buffers is very annoying, as users have to implement it for every single struct\n  they create. The best solution would be to use `impl BufferContent for ... {}`, but this syntax is still unstable. Vulkano currently doesn't\n  enforce any trait for buffers contents, but that's unsafe.\n\n- When `T` is unsized, there's no way to create a `*mut T` pointer from a `*mut c_void` and a size. This had to be implemented in a hacky\n  (and very dangerous) way with a custom trait.\n\n- Vulkano users are encouraged to manipulate objects through `Arc`s. However there is no way to add a method `pub fn foo(self: Arc<Self>)`\n  to an object that would capture the `Arc` that holds it. This has to be done through a trait, forcing the user to import the trait and making\n  the API a bit more difficult to use.\n\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29701 The fact that is legal to implement `Deref` and make `deref()` return a different object every\n  time means that it is dangerous to interface with a `Foo` through a `P where P: Deref<Foo>`. That `P` could return several different\n  `Foo`s every time you deref it, and the implementation can't rely on the fact that the object will be the same every time.\n\n- This library was designed with specialization in mind. There are several `is_compatible` trait methods that perform deep comparisons between\n  layouts. With specialization available, these methods could be specialized as `true` for layouts that are known to always be compatible.\n\n- Placement new syntax would make it easier and less error-prone to create buffers, as you wouldn't have to create uninitialized buffers first.\n  https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27779\n\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29328\n\n- \"Source trait is private\" errors when traits are declared in private modules but reexported publicly from a parent module. Not sure if that's\n  a bug or a feature from the privacy system, but in both cases it's annoying.\n\n- Some trait implementations have an associated type that looks like `type T = (Arc<Foo>, Arc<Bar>);`. HKTs would allow this parameter to take\n  references to the Arcs instead, and avoid having to clone them. This problem could by bypassed by making the code more ugly, but it's not worth\n  it just to avoid cloning some Arcs.\n\n- Visibility rules mean that you can't write `struct Error; pub mod foo { pub struct Foo; impl From<Error> for Foo { ... } }`. Rustc complains\n  that `Error` is private and exported in `Foo`'s signature, even though that's in the author's opinion a totally legitimate usage.\n\n- This repository contains the `vulkano-shaders` library, which generates Rust code that uses the `vulkano` library. If the API of `vulkano` gets\n  a breaking change, there is no way to enforce or to check the fact that the user uses a correct combination of versions for `vulkano-shaders`\n  and `vulkano`. Procedural macros declared in `vulkano` itself would solve this (https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1566).\n\n- No way to set the alignment of a struct member, or to force the size of a struct to be a multiple of a certain size. Some parts of the Vulkan\n  API enforce some limitations regarding the alignment, and either the user or the `vulkano-shaders` code generator currently has to manually\n  add dummy padding fields.\n\n- [No way to create dynamic-sized arrays on the stack](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/618). A lot of Vulkan functions require\n  passing an array of small elements (small structs or integers). Building such an array with a `Vec` can be expensive, especially\n  when most of the time the array only contains a single element. This is currently solved with the `SmallVec` type, but doing so wastes\n  memory.\n"
