          "content": "# Changelog\n\nAll notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.\n\nThe format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),\nand this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).\n\n## [0.11.3] - 2023-01-30\n\nThis is a backwards-compatible release; thus no removals or breaking changes.\n\n### Added\n\n- RPC modes are now supported for properties: `#[property(rpc = \"mode\")]`. (#1006)\n\n### Changed\n\n- Specialized pool array aliases such as `PoolByteArray` are now deprecated and will be removed in the next version. Use `PoolArray<u8>` instead. (#1007)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Types with one-way conversions can now be exposed through the `#[property]` attribute. (#1013)\n- `FromVariant` for marker types should no longer fail in the fringe case where null object variants are explicitly used. (#1012)\n\n## [0.11.2] - 2023-01-09\n\nThis is a hot-fix release for a high priority issue.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- API methods that may return null object pointers should no longer panic. ([#1002](https://github.com/godot-rust/gdnative/pull/1002))\n\n## [0.11.1] - 2023-01-06\n\nThis is a backwards-compatible release; thus no removals or breaking changes.\n\n### Added\n\n- `NativeClass` can now be derived for generic types. Additionally, `#[monomorphize]` can be used to name concrete monomorphizations.

([#975](https://github.com/godot-rust/gdnative/pull/975))\n- Mix-in impl blocks can now be created through `#[methods(mixin = \"Name\")]`. These blocks have a many-to-many relationship with `NativeClass`es, and can be generic, or trait implementations. ([#999](https://github.com/godot-rust/gdnative/pull/999))\n- Added a Third-Person-Shooter example. ([#977](https://github.com/godot-rust/gdnative/pull/977))\n- Variant derive macros now support stringly and numeric representations for fieldless enums.

2020-09-20\n\n### Added\n\n- All public functions now have the `#[inline]` attribute, improving cross-crate inlining in builds without LTO.\n\n- A curated `prelude` module is added in `gdnative` crate, containing common types and traits.\n\n- Added the `SubClass` trait, which allows for static up-casts and static validation of downcasts.\n\n- Added the `OwnedToVariant` trait and derive macro which enabled `Variant` conversion for more types.\n\n- The `NativeScript` and `#[methods]` proc-macros now report errors more accurately.\n\n- Added the `godot_init` convenience macro that declares all three endpoints for common use cases.\n\n- Added more extension methods for `Vector2`, `Vector3` and `Color`.\n\n- Added wrappers for `GodotString::get_basename` and `get_extensions`.\n\n- Added a high-level interface to the Godot script profiler in the `gdnative::nativescript::profiling` module, and in the `#[gdnative::profiled]` attribute.\n\n- Added before/after hooks for the `#[property]` attribute.\n\n- API methods now have generated documentation according to Godot documentation XMLs. The Godot docs contain custom markup which isn't currently parsed. We expect to improve the generated docs in the following releases.\n\n- Added custom resource example.\n\n### Changed\n\n- **The default API version is now Godot 3.2.3-stable.**\n\n- The object reference system is revamped using the typestate pattern, with semantics that model Godot behavior more accurately, allowing for clearer boundaries between safe and unsafe code.\n\n- API methods are now generic over types that can be converted to `Variant`, `GodotString`, or generated API types, removing the need for boilerplate code like `&thing.into()`.\n\n- Enums in the API are now represented more accurately as newtypes around `i64`. They are available in the same modules where their associated objects are defined.\n\n- `Dictionary` and `VariantArray` now use the typestate pattern as well.\n\n- The typed arrays are unified into a generic `TypedArray` type. The old names remain as type aliases.\n\n- Moved generated bindings into the `gdnative::api` module, making the top-level namespace easier to navigate.\n\n- It's now possible to crate custom binding crates without forking the repository using the generator, since `gdnative_bindings_generator::Api::new` now takes JSON input as an argument.\n\n- Separated core wrappers and NativeScript support into the `core_types` and `nativescript` modules.\n\n- Cleaned up the public interface with regards to intended usage. The public API no longer uses `gdnative-sys` types.\n\n- The `new_ref` method is now in a `NewRef` trait.\n\n- High-level wrappers are added for `godot_gdnative_init` and `godot_gdnative_terminate` callback arguments.\n\n- Improved source links on docs.rs.\n\n- `bindgen` is updated to 0.55.1.\n\n- `euclid` is updated to 0.22.1.\n\n- Improved build time performance.\n\n### Removed\n\n- Removed deprecated items from the public interface in 0.8.1.\n\n- Removed `gdnative-sys` types from the public interface. `gdnative-sys` is considered an internal dependency starting from 0.9.\n\n- Removed the `Object` and `Reference` wrappers from `gdnative-core`. The same types are available in `gdnative-bindings`.\n\n- Removed generated bindings for virtual methods, since they cannot actually be called.\n\n- Removed `From` implementations for `Variant` since `ToVariant` is much more comprehensive.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed typos in variant names of `VariantOperator` and `GodotError`.\n\n- `StringName::from_str` now returns `Self` correctly.\n\n- Fixed a case of undefined behavior that may manifest as crashes when some specific methods that return `VariantArray` are called.\n\n- Fixed an issue with platform headers when building on Windows with the `gnu` toolchain that prevented compilation.\n\n- Macros can now be used with qualified imports, removing the need for `#[macro_use]`.\n\n- Fixed an issue where `Rid` arguments passed to API methods are incorrect due to use-after-free.\n\n## [0.8.1] - 2020-05-31\n\n### Added\n\n- Exported methods can now have optional arguments. Arguments with the `#[opt]` attribute are optional in the scripting API. Default values are obtained using `Default` if not provided by the caller.\n\n- Added a `claim` method on the `GodotObject` trait, which clones the reference if the underlying type is reference-counted (extends from `Reference`), or aliases it if it isn't. This replaces the `Class::from_sys(object.to_sys())` \"idiom\" that relied on hidden public items (`from_sys` and `to_sys`) that are not actually intended to be part of the public API.\n\n- Fields can now be skipped with the `#[variant(skip)]` attribute when deriving `FromVariant` and `ToVariant`.\n\n- Implemented various methods on `Basis`.\n\n- Implemented `Display` for `GodotString`.\n\n- Implemented `Debug` for core typed arrays.\n\n- Added `Aether<T>`, a special `UserData` wrapper for ZSTs. This type does not perform any allocation or synchronization at runtime, but produces a value using `Default` each time it's mapped.\n\n- Include paths for the Android SDK can now be inferred from environment variables.\n\n- A dodge-the-creeps example has been added to the repo.\n\n### Changed\n\n- Initialization errors are now reported using GDNative APIs, instead of panics. This includes situations where API struct versions mismatch, or if some API functions are unavailable.\n\n- Paths to SDKs for Apple platforms are now obtained using `xcrun`.\n\n- The public fields of `ExportInfo` are now deprecated. They will become private in 0.9. Use one of the constructors or `Export::export_info` instead.\n\n- Several public types that are unused in the current API have been deprecated.\n\n- Free-on-drop wrappers are now deprecated. Use of free-on-drop wrappers is no longer recommended due to upcoming changes in ownership semantics in 0.9. Users are suggested to call `free` or `queue_free` manually instead. They will be removed in 0.9.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed a problem where the build script for `gdnative-sys` will try to include macOS headers when building for mobile targets from a Mac, causing the build to fail.\n\n- Fixed SDK include paths for the iOS Simulator, whose SDK was separate from the one for real iOS devices. This allows building for the iOS Simulator platform.\n\n- Fixed a case of undefined behavior (UB) when Rust scripts are attached to incompatible base classes in the Godot Editor (e.g. attaching a `NativeClass` with `Base = Node2D` to a `Spatial` node).\n\n## [0.8.0] - 2020-03-09\n\n### Added\n\n- Field attribute `property` on derived `NativeClass` types, which can be used to quickly export simple properties.\n\n- The behavior of derived `FromVariant` and `ToVariant` implementations can be customized with the `variant` field attribute.\n\n- New example projects.\n\n- A `godot_dbg!` macro for quick and dirty debugging that works like the standard `dbg!`, but prints to the Godot debug console.\n\n### Changed\n\n- **The default API version is now Godot 3.2-stable.**\n\n- The `FromVariant` trait now reports detailed information on failure.\n\n- The API for property registration is reworked to provide better ergonomics and static type checking for editor hints.\n\n- `LocalCellData` is now the default user-data wrapper type. This wrapper allows non-`Send` types to be used as `NativeClass`es, and produces a runtime error whenever a value is accessed from a different thread than where it was created.\n\n### Removed\n\n- Removed the old-style `godot_class!` macro.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed an `unused_parens` warning when using the `NativeClass` derive macro.\n\n- Fixed handling of unknown enums with duplicate values, which prevented code generation for Godot version `3.2`.\n\n- Fixed a memory leak where a `Drop` implementation wasn't generated for non-instanciable reference-counted types.\n\n- Fixed a memory leak where reference-counted types get an extra reference count when returned from the engine.\n\n- Fixed bindings generation when building for iOS using `cargo-lipo`.\n\n## [0.7.0] - 2019-12-22\n\n### Added\n\n- Procedural-macro `methods` which can be applied to `impl` blocks and allows\n  a more natural Rust syntax for creating script types and exporting functions\n  using attributes.\n\n- The `ToVariant` and `FromVariant` traits, including derive macros.\n  These traits can be used to define how custom types can be constructed from\n  `Variant`s or be extracted from existing `Variant`s.\n  Any type implementing `FromVariant` can be used as a parameter to an exported\n  function. Any type implementing `ToVariant` can be returned from exported\n  functions.\n\n- Derive-macro for `NativeClass` trait.\n\n- Every type implementing `NativeClass` provides a \"user data\" storage type\n  which is used to control how the script data is stored internally. A default\n  value is provided via the procedural macro.\n\n- Iterators for Godot collection types.\n\n- `Instance<T>` type which contains the Godot owner object and the script data\n  (implements `ToVariant` and `FromVariant`, so it can be used as a parameter\n  or return type).\n\n- Generated class wrappers now include associated constants for constants\n  provided by Godot.\n\n- New example projects.\n\n### Changed\n\n- The code now uses the Rust 2018 edition.\n\n- The API description of Godot classes was updated to the stable Godot version\n  `3.1.1`.\n\n- The GDNative API description was updated to the stable Godot version `3.1.1`\n  and now includes added GDNative extensions.\n\n- The `NativeClass` trait has changed a lot and was split into two traits to\n  allow the `methods` procedural macro to generate a description of exported\n  methods.\n\n- The generated class bindings are stored in a single crate again and use the\n  `Deref` trait to implement inheritance.\n\n### Removed\n\n- The \"domain-grouped\" crates for generated bindings are merged into a single\n  crate, so the individual crates are no longer in use.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed a memory safety issue where the strings used to register signals are\n  dropped before the API call.\n\n- Fixed a correctness issue where the layout of method arguments is\n  incorrectly assumed to be continuous, causing invalid memory access when\n  calling methods with multiple arguments.\n"

          "content": "# Contributing to the godot-rust library\n\nThe godot-rust bindings developers welcome contribution from everyone. Here are the guidelines if you are thinking of helping us:\n\n\n## Submitting a PR\n\nContributions should be made in the form of GitHub pull requests (PRs). Each pull request will be reviewed by the godot-rust team or other contributors.\n\n\n### Picking a task\n\nHave a look at the [issue tracker] to find good tasks to start with. Should you wish to work on an issue, please claim it first by commenting in it. This is to prevent duplicated efforts from contributors on the same issue.\n\nWe especially appreciate input on the issues labeled [`help wanted`]. The label [`good first issue`] encompasses issues which do not require a deep prior knowledge of the godot-rust intricacies and could be picked up by a newcomer.\n\nYou can also open a pull request directly without an associated issue. Note however that discussing the issue with other developers beforehand increases the chances of a PR being accepted, and may save time on both your and the reviewer's end. Such discussions can also happen in our Discord server.\n\n\n### Git workflow\n\n* Branch from the `master` branch and, if needed, rebase to the current `master` branch before submitting your pull request. If it doesn't merge cleanly, you may be asked to rebase your changes.\n\n* Use one commit per logical change. Often, PRs only consist of a single commit. If you change unrelated parts of the code, split it into separate commits.\n\n* If your patch is not getting reviewed or you need a specific person to review it, you can @-reply a reviewer asking for a review in the pull request or a comment.\n\n\n### Writing tests\n\nWhenever applicable, add tests relevant to the fixed bug or new feature.\n\nSome types and functions can only be used if the engine is running. In order to test them, use the `godot_test!` macro, and explicitly invoke the test functions in [test/src/lib.rs](test/src/lib.rs). Don't hesitate to see how existing code does this.\n\n  \n### Local and CI checks\n\nThe repository root contains a script `check.sh`. If you invoke it without arguments, it will run a list of basic checks locally. This tool also allows you to quickly build RustDoc documentation of changed APIs. Please run `./check.sh --help` for more information about its usage.\n\nIf you use Windows, you might consider using a Unix shell interpreter (e.g. one shipped with Git-for-Windows, or WSL2, or similar).\n\nAdditionally, when opening a PR, our continuous integration (CI) pipeline will automatically perform a few checks (formatting, lints, unit tests). Please make sure all of them pass, adjusting your code where necessary.\n\n\n## Communication\n\nPrimary communication between developers of the project happens on the `godot-rust` Discord server. [Invite link here][godot-rust-discord].\n\nFor questions about Godot, check out the options on the [Godot community page][godot-community]. For example, their Discord server hosts a `#gdnative-dev` channel for questions regarding GDNative interface. The contributor chat is helpful in case of discussions about Godot's own design and implementation.\n\nIf you are only interested in occasional announcements and showcases, follow [@GodotRust on Twitter][godot-rust-twitter]. For questions and design discussions, please use Discord.\n\n## License\n\nAny contribution submitted for inclusion in the work by you shall be licensed under the [MIT license](LICENSE.md), without any additional terms or conditions.\n\n[issue tracker]: https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust/issues\n[`help wanted`]: https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22\n[`good first issue`]: https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22\n[godot-community]: https://godotengine.org/community\n[godot-rust-discord]: https://discord.gg/FNudpBD\n[godot-rust-twitter]: https://twitter.com/GodotRust\n"

This allows you to develop games or other applications in Godot, while benefiting from Rust's strengths, such as its type system, scalability and performance.\n\n> **Note**: if you are looking for a Rust binding for GDExtension (Godot 4), checkout [`gdext`](https://github.com/godot-rust/gdext).\n\n## Maintenance Policy\n\n> [!Important]  \n> At the moment, `gdnative` is no longer actively maintained. Almost all development resources from the godot-rust project are invested in\n> [`gdext`](https://github.com/godot-rust/gdext), which still requires a ton of work. If you are interested in assisting with `gdnative`\n> maintenance, please contact us via e-mail or on Discord.\n\n`gdnative` is considered mostly feature complete, and lies a focus on API stability. We try to avoid unnecessary breaking changes, and try to limit their end-user impact to a minimum whenever we have to make them. No large-scale features are planned anymore.\n\nWe adhere to [Cargo's semantic versioning](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/semver.html) as the means to convey changes in the public API between versions. Future releases are planned publicly on GitHub, with the [milestone](https://github.com/godot-rust/gdnative/milestones) feature. Note that we use the `breaking-change` label to indicate the existence of *any* technical breakage, regardless of the expected impact on end user programs.\n\nIf you are looking to contribute, but are not sure if what you want to do falls in the scope of the project and is permitted by our maintenance policy, feel free to [get in touch](CONTRIBUTING.md#communication) with the project maintainers before you start.\n\n## Toolchain compatibility\n\n`gdnative` currently has a minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) of **1.70**. We use the Rust 2021 Edition.\n\n> **Warning**: **Linux users: Be aware of the source of your Godot binary!** Binary distributions of Godot using a container-based format may ship versions of dependencies that may not be compatible with GDNative libraries built directly from your base system. Examples of such formats include **Flatpak**, **Snap**, and **AppImage**.\n>\n> As of 2023, some package managers might silently install one of these instead of a normal package when Godot is requested, which can then cause bizarre compatibility issues with your GDNative libraries. We recommend using the official binaries from [godotengine.org](https://godotengine.org/download/3.x/linux) for both the editor and the export templates.\n\nDue to GDNative API not strictly following SemVer and some concepts not mapping 1:1 to Rust (default parameters),\nit is difficult for a godot-rust version to remain compatible with multiple Godot versions simultaneously.\n\nHowever, we support the latest stable Godot 3 minor release out-of-the-box, and allow to easily use custom engine\nversions using the `custom-godot` feature flag (see [below](#custom-builds)).\n\nCompatibility list:\n\n* Godot 3.5.1 (works with gdnative 0.11)\n* Godot 3.4 (works with gdnative 0.10, custom build for 0.11)\n* Godot 3.3 (custom build)\n* Godot 3.2 (custom build)\n\nThe bindings do _**not**_ support Godot 4. If you are looking for a Rust binding for GDExtension (Godot 4), checkout [`gdextension`](https://github.com/godot-rust/gdextension).\n\n## Getting started\n\nDetailed setup is explained in [the _Getting Started_ section of the book](https://godot-rust.github.io/book/getting-started.html). In case of problems, consider also reading the [FAQ](https://godot-rust.github.io/book/faq/configuration.html).\n\n### Latest released version\n\nThis is the recommended way of using godot-rust. After `bindgen` dependencies and a current Godot version are installed, add the `gdnative` crate as a dependency, and set the crate type to `cdylib`:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\ngdnative = \"0.11\"\n\n[lib]\ncrate-type = [\"cdylib\"]\n```\n\n### Latest GitHub version\n\nIf you would like to benefit from cutting-edge features and bugfixes, you can use the GitHub version. We have a relatively sophisticated CI and test suite for basic stability, but the GitHub version is typically more experimental and less battle-tested than a `crates.io` release. We also do not guarantee any SemVer compatibility here.\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\ngdnative = { git = \"https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust.git\" }\n\n[lib]\ncrate-type = [\"cdylib\"]\n```\n\n### Custom builds\n\nTo use the bindings with a different Godot version or a custom build of the engine, see\n[Custom Godot builds](https://godot-rust.github.io/book/advanced-guides/custom-godot.html) in the user guide.\n\n### Async/yield support\n\nAsync support is a work-in-progress, with a low-level API available in `gdnative::tasks`, if the `async` feature is enabled on `gdnative`. See [this page](https://godot-rust.github.io/book/recipes/async-tokio.html) in the book for an introduction to use the async feature with Tokio.\n\n\n## Example\n\nA typical use case is to expose your own _Native Class_, a Rust API that can be invoked from the Godot engine. The resulting native script can be attached to the scene tree, just like GDScript (`.gd` files). \n\nThis happens via dynamic libraries and the _GDNative interface_, which will be loaded from Godot. The necessary wiring is done behind the scenes by godot-rust. A simple \"Hello world\" application could look like this:\n\n```rust\nuse gdnative::prelude::*;\n\n#[derive(NativeClass)]\n#[inherit(Node)]\npub struct HelloWorld;\n\n#[methods]\nimpl HelloWorld {\n    fn new(_base: &Node) -> Self {\n        HelloWorld\n    }\n\n    #[method]\n    fn _ready(&self, #[base] _base: &Node) {\n        godot_print!(\"Hello, world.\");\n    }\n}\n\nfn init(handle: InitHandle) {\n    handle.add_class::<HelloWorld>();\n}\n\ngodot_init!(init);\n```\n\n### Further examples\n\n> **Important note:**\n>\n> To run or edit an example, you need to build the native library for it first. Otherwise, the project will be broken. You can do so manually with `cargo build`, or use the `example.sh` shell script for convenience: `./example.sh run hello-world` or `./example.sh edit hello-world` for the editor.\n\nThe [/examples](https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust/tree/master/examples) directory contains several ready to use examples, complete with Godot projects and setup for easy compilation from Cargo:\n\n- [**hello-world**](https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust/tree/master/examples/hello-world) - Your first project, writes to the console.\n- [**spinning-cube**](https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust/tree/master/examples/spinning-cube) - Spin our own node in place, exposing editor properties.\n- [**scene-create**](https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust/tree/master/examples/scene-create) - Load, instance and place scenes using Rust code.\n- [**builder-export**](https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust/tree/master/examples/builder-export) - Export using the builder API.\n- [**property-export**](https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust/tree/master/examples/property-export) - Export complex properties such as collections.\n- [**dodge-the-creeps**](https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust/tree/master/examples/dodge-the-creeps) - A Rust port of the [little Godot game](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/your_first_game.html).\n- [**signals**](https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust/tree/master/examples/signals) - Connect and emit signals.\n- [**resource**](https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust/tree/master/examples/resource) - Create and use custom resources.\n- [**rpc**](https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust/tree/master/examples/rpc) - Simple peer-to-peer networking.\n- [**native-plugin**](https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust/tree/master/examples/native-plugin) - Create custom node plugins.\n\nAt startup, the Godot editor tries to load all resources used by the project, including the native library. If the latter isn't present, the editor will skip properties or signals associated with the missing native scripts in the scene. This causes the scene tree to be non-functional for any sample that relies on properties or signals configured in the editor.\n### Third-party projects\n\nTo see a list of games and integrations developed on top of godot-rust, have a look at our list of [third-party projects](https://godot-rust.github.io/book/projects.html) in the book.\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n\n## License\n\nAny contribution submitted for inclusion in the work by you shall be licensed under the [MIT license](LICENSE.md), without any additional terms or conditions.\n"
