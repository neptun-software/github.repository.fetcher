          "content": "## Contributing to Reth\n\nThanks for your interest in improving Reth!\n\nThere are multiple opportunities to contribute at any level. It doesn't matter if you are just getting started with Rust\nor are the most weathered expert, we can use your help.\n\n**No contribution is too small and all contributions are valued.**\n\nThis document will help you get started. **Do not let the document intimidate you**.\nIt should be considered as a guide to help you navigate the process.\n\nThe [dev Telegram][dev-tg] is available for any concerns you may have that are not covered in this guide.\n\nIf you contribute to this project, your contributions will be made to the project under both Apache 2.0 and the MIT\nlicense.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\nThe Reth project adheres to the [Rust Code of Conduct][rust-coc]. This code of conduct describes the _minimum_ behavior\nexpected from all contributors.\n\nInstances of violations of the Code of Conduct can be reported by contacting the team\nat [georgios@paradigm.xyz](mailto:georgios@paradigm.xyz).\n\n### Ways to contribute\n\nThere are fundamentally three ways an individual can contribute:\n\n1. **By opening an issue:** For example, if you believe that you have uncovered a bug\n   in Reth, creating a new issue in the issue tracker is the way to report it.\n2. **By adding context:** Providing additional context to existing issues,\n   such as screenshots and code snippets to help resolve issues.\n3. **By resolving issues:** Typically this is done in the form of either\n   demonstrating that the issue reported is not a problem after all, or more often,\n   by opening a pull request that fixes the underlying problem, in a concrete and\n   reviewable manner.\n\n**Anybody can participate in any stage of contribution**. We urge you to participate in the discussion around bugs and\nparticipate in reviewing PRs.\n\n### Contributions Related to Spelling and Grammar\n\nAt this time, we will not be accepting contributions that only fix spelling or grammatical errors in documentation, code or\nelsewhere.\n\n### Asking for help\n\n<!-- If you have reviewed existing documentation and still have questions, or you are having problems, you can get help in the following ways: -->\n\n<!-- -   **Asking in the support Telegram:** The [Foundry Support Telegram][support-tg] is a fast and easy way to ask questions. -->\n<!-- -   **Opening a discussion:** This repository comes with a discussions board where you can also ask for help. Click the \"Discussions\" tab at the top. -->\n\nIf you have reviewed existing documentation and still have questions, or you are having problems, you can get help by *\n*opening a discussion**. This repository comes with a discussions board where you can also ask for help. Click the \"\nDiscussions\" tab at the top.\n\nAs Reth is still in heavy development, the documentation can be a bit scattered. The [Reth Book][reth-book] is our\ncurrent best-effort attempt at keeping up-to-date information.\n\n### Submitting a bug report\n\nWhen filing a new bug report in the issue tracker, you will be presented with a basic form to fill out.\n\nIf you believe that you have uncovered a bug, please fill out the form to the best of your ability. Do not worry if you\ncannot answer every detail, just fill in what you can. Contributors will ask follow-up questions if something is\nunclear.\n\nThe most important pieces of information we need in a bug report are:\n\n- The Reth version you are on (and that it is up to date)\n- The platform you are on (Windows, macOS, an M1 Mac or Linux)\n- Code snippets if this is happening in relation to testing or building code\n- Concrete steps to reproduce the bug\n\nIn order to rule out the possibility of the bug being in your project, the code snippets should be as minimal as\npossible. It is better if you can reproduce the bug with a small snippet as opposed to an entire project!\n\nSee [this guide][mcve] on how to create a minimal, complete, and verifiable example.\n\n### Submitting a feature request\n\nWhen adding a feature request in the issue tracker, you will be presented with a basic form to fill out.\n\nPlease include as detailed of an explanation as possible of the feature you would like, adding additional context if\nnecessary.\n\nIf you have examples of other tools that have the feature you are requesting, please include them as well.\n\n### Resolving an issue\n\nPull requests are the way concrete changes are made to the code, documentation, and dependencies of Reth.\n\nEven tiny pull requests, like fixing wording, are greatly appreciated. Before making a large change, it is usually a\ngood idea to first open an issue describing the change to solicit feedback and guidance. This will increase the\nlikelihood of the PR getting merged.\n\nPlease also make sure that the following commands pass if you have changed the code:\n\n```sh\nmake pr\n```\n\nIf you are working in VSCode, we recommend you install the [rust-analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/) extension,\nand use the following VSCode user settings:\n\n```json\n\"editor.formatOnSave\": true,\n\"rust-analyzer.rustfmt.extraArgs\": [\"+nightly\"],\n\"[rust]\": {\n\"editor.defaultFormatter\": \"rust-lang.rust-analyzer\"\n}\n```\n\nIf you are working on a larger feature, we encourage you to open up a draft pull request, to make sure that other\ncontributors are not duplicating work.\n\n#### Adding tests\n\nIf the change being proposed alters code, it is either adding new functionality to Reth, or fixing existing, broken\nfunctionality.\nIn both of these cases, the pull request should include one or more tests to ensure that Reth does not regress in the\nfuture.\n\nTypes of tests include:\n\n- **Unit tests**: Functions which have very specific tasks should be unit tested.\n- **Integration tests**: For general purpose, far reaching functionality,\n  integration tests should be added. The best way to add a new integration test is to look at existing ones and follow\n  the style.\n\n#### Running Individual tests\n\nBy default, `cargo test` does not select any packages, in order to run individual tests by name (\ne.g. `cargo test mytest`) navigate to the directory of that file (e.g. `reth/crates/rpc/rpc/`) or use\nthe `-p <package-name>` option to run specific tests of a crate from anywhere in the\nworkspace (`cargo test -p reth-rpc mytest`).\n\nSee also [cargo-test](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-test.html) for more information on running tests.\n\n#### Commits\n\nIt is a recommended best practice to keep your changes as logically grouped as possible within individual commits. There\nis no limit to the number of commits any single pull request may have, and many contributors find it easier to review\nchanges that are split across multiple commits.\n\nThat said, if you have a number of commits that are \"checkpoints\" and don't represent a single logical change, please\nsquash those together.\n\n#### Opening the pull request\n\nFrom within GitHub, opening a new pull request will present you with a template that should be filled out. Please try\nyour best at filling out the details, but feel free to skip parts if you're not sure what to put.\n\n#### Discuss and update\n\nYou will probably get feedback or requests for changes to your pull request.\nThis is a big part of the submission process, so don't be discouraged! Some contributors may sign off on the pull\nrequest right away, others may have more detailed comments or feedback. This is a necessary part of the process in order\nto evaluate whether the changes are correct and necessary.\n\n**Any community member can review a PR, so you might get conflicting feedback**. Keep an eye out for comments from code\nowners to provide guidance on conflicting feedback.\n\n#### Reviewing pull requests\n\n**Any Reth community member is welcome to review any pull request**.\n\nAll contributors who choose to review and provide feedback on pull requests have a responsibility to both the project\nand individual making the contribution. Reviews and feedback must be helpful, insightful, and geared towards improving\nthe contribution as opposed to simply blocking it. If there are reasons why you feel the PR should not be merged,\nexplain what those are. Do not expect to be able to block a PR from advancing simply because you say \"no\" without giving\nan explanation. Be open to having your mind changed. Be open to working _with_ the contributor to make the pull request\nbetter.\n\nReviews that are dismissive or disrespectful of the contributor or any other reviewers are strictly counter to\nthe [Code of Conduct][coc-header].\n\nWhen reviewing a pull request, the primary goals are for the codebase to improve and for the person submitting the\nrequest to succeed. **Even if a pull request is not merged, the submitter should come away from the experience feeling\nlike their effort was not unappreciated**. Every PR from a new contributor is an opportunity to grow the community.\n\n##### Review a bit at a time\n\nDo not overwhelm new contributors.\n\nIt is tempting to micro-optimize and make everything about relative performance, perfect grammar, or exact style\nmatches. Do not succumb to that temptation.\n\nFocus first on the most significant aspects of the change:\n\n1. Does this change make sense for Reth?\n2. Does this change make Reth better, even if only incrementally?\n3. Are there clear bugs or larger scale issues that need attending?\n4. Are the commit messages readable and correct? If it contains a breaking change, is it clear enough?\n\nNote that only **incremental** improvement is needed to land a PR. This means that the PR does not need to be perfect,\nonly better than the status quo. Follow-up PRs may be opened to continue iterating.\n\nWhen changes are necessary, _request_ them, do not _demand_ them, and **do not assume that the submitter already knows\nhow to add a test or run a benchmark**.\n\nSpecific performance optimization techniques, coding styles and conventions change over time. The first impression you\ngive to a new contributor never does.\n\nNits (requests for small changes that are not essential) are fine, but try to avoid stalling the pull request. Most nits\ncan typically be fixed by the Reth maintainers merging the pull request, but they can also be an opportunity for the\ncontributor to learn a bit more about the project.\n\nIt is always good to clearly indicate nits when you comment,\ne.g.: `Nit: change foo() to bar(). But this is not blocking`.\n\nIf your comments were addressed but were not folded after new commits, or if they proved to be mistaken,\nplease, [hide them][hiding-a-comment] with the appropriate reason to keep the conversation flow concise and relevant.\n\n##### Be aware of the person behind the code\n\nBe aware that _how_ you communicate requests and reviews in your feedback can have a significant impact on the success\nof the pull request. Yes, we may merge a particular change that makes Reth better, but the individual might just not\nwant to have anything to do with Reth ever again. The goal is not just having good code.\n\n##### Abandoned or stale pull requests\n\nIf a pull request appears to be abandoned or stalled, it is polite to first check with the contributor to see if they\nintend to continue the work before checking if they would mind if you took it over (especially if it just has nits\nleft). When doing so, it is courteous to give the original contributor credit for the work they started, either by\npreserving their name and e-mail address in the commit log, or by using the `Author: ` or `Co-authored-by: ` metadata\ntag in the commits.\n\n_Adapted from the [Foundry contributing guide][foundry-contributing]_.\n\n[rust-coc]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\n\n[coc-header]: #code-of-conduct\n\n[dev-tg]: https://t.me/paradigm_reth\n\n[reth-book]: https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/tree/main/book\n\n[mcve]: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\n\n[hiding-a-comment]: https://help.github.com/articles/managing-disruptive-comments/#hiding-a-comment\n\n[foundry-contributing]: https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n"

This types contains all additional parameters that are required to convert an `ExecutionPayload` to an EL block.\n\n## Reth changes\n\n### Updates to the engine API\n\n- Add new endpoints to the `EngineApi` trait and implement endpoints.\n- Update the `ExecutionPayload` + `ExecutionPayloadSidecar` to `Block` conversion if there are any additional parameters.\n- Update version specific validation checks in the `EngineValidator` trait.\n"

Reth is an Execution Layer (EL) and is compatible with all Ethereum Consensus Layer (CL) implementations that support the [Engine API](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/tree/a0d03086564ab1838b462befbc083f873dcf0c0f/src/engine). It is originally built and driven forward by [Paradigm](https://paradigm.xyz/), and is licensed under the Apache and MIT licenses.\n\n## Goals\n\nAs a full Ethereum node, Reth allows users to connect to the Ethereum network and interact with the Ethereum blockchain. This includes sending and receiving transactions/logs/traces, as well as accessing and interacting with smart contracts. Building a successful Ethereum node requires creating a high-quality implementation that is both secure and efficient, as well as being easy to use on consumer hardware. It also requires building a strong community of contributors who can help support and improve the software.\n\nMore concretely, our goals are:\n\n1. **Modularity**: Every component of Reth is built to be used as a library: well-tested, heavily documented and benchmarked. We envision that developers will import the node's crates, mix and match, and innovate on top of them. Examples of such usage include but are not limited to spinning up standalone P2P networks, talking directly to a node's database, or \"unbundling\" the node into the components you need. To achieve that, we are licensing Reth under the Apache/MIT permissive license. You can learn more about the project's components [here](./docs/repo/layout.md).\n2. **Performance**: Reth aims to be fast, so we used Rust and the [Erigon staged-sync](https://erigon.substack.com/p/erigon-stage-sync-and-control-flows) node architecture. We also use our Ethereum libraries (including [Alloy](https://github.com/alloy-rs/alloy/) and [revm](https://github.com/bluealloy/revm/)) which we’ve battle-tested and optimized via [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/).\n3. **Free for anyone to use any way they want**: Reth is free open source software, built for the community, by the community. By licensing the software under the Apache/MIT license, we want developers to use it without being bound by business licenses, or having to think about the implications of GPL-like licenses.\n4. **Client Diversity**: The Ethereum protocol becomes more antifragile when no node implementation dominates. This ensures that if there's a software bug, the network does not finalize a bad block. By building a new client, we hope to contribute to Ethereum's antifragility.\n5. **Support as many EVM chains as possible**: We aspire that Reth can full-sync not only Ethereum, but also other chains like Optimism, Polygon, BNB Smart Chain, and more. If you're working on any of these projects, please reach out.\n6. **Configurability**: We want to solve for node operators that care about fast historical queries, but also for hobbyists who cannot operate on large hardware. We also want to support teams and individuals who want both sync from genesis and via \"fast sync\". We envision that Reth will be configurable enough and provide configurable \"profiles\" for the tradeoffs that each team faces.\n\n## Status\n\nReth is production ready, and suitable for usage in mission-critical environments such as staking or high-uptime services. We also actively recommend professional node operators to switch to Reth in production for performance and cost reasons in use cases where high performance with great margins is required such as RPC, MEV, Indexing, Simulations, and P2P activities.\n\nMore historical context below:\n* We released 1.0 \"production-ready\" stable Reth in June 2024.\n    * Reth completed an audit with [Sigma Prime](https://sigmaprime.io/), the developers of [Lighthouse](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse), the Rust Consensus Layer implementation. Find it [here](./audit/sigma_prime_audit_v2.pdf).\n    * Revm (the EVM used in Reth) underwent an audit with [Guido Vranken](https://twitter.com/guidovranken) (#1 [Ethereum Bug Bounty](https://ethereum.org/en/bug-bounty)). We will publish the results soon.\n* We released multiple iterative beta versions, up to [beta.9](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.2.0-beta.9) on Monday June 3rd 2024 the last beta release.\n* We released [beta](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.2.0-beta.1) on Monday March 4th 2024, our first breaking change to the database model, providing faster query speed, smaller database footprint, and allowing \"history\" to be mounted on separate drives.\n* We shipped iterative improvements until the last alpha release on February 28th 2024, [0.1.0-alpha.21](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha.21).\n* We [initially announced](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2023/06/reth-alpha) [0.1.0-alpha.1](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha.1) in June 20th 2023.\n\n### Database compatibility\n\nWe do not have any breaking database changes since beta.1, and do not plan any in the near future.\n\nReth [v0.2.0-beta.1](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v0.2.0-beta.1) includes\na [set of breaking database changes](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/5191) that makes it impossible to use database files produced by earlier versions.\n\nIf you had a database produced by alpha versions of Reth, you need to drop it with `reth db drop`\n(using the same arguments such as `--config` or `--datadir` that you passed to `reth node`), and resync using the same `reth node` command you've used before.\n\n## For Users\n\nSee the [Reth Book](https://paradigmxyz.github.io/reth) for instructions on how to install and run Reth.\n\n## For Developers\n\n### Using reth as a library\n\nYou can use individual crates of reth in your project.\n\nThe crate docs can be found [here](https://paradigmxyz.github.io/reth/docs).\n\nFor a general overview of the crates, see [Project Layout](./docs/repo/layout.md).\n\n### Contributing\n\nIf you want to contribute, or follow along with contributor discussion, you can use our [main telegram](https://t.me/paradigm_reth) to chat with us about the development of Reth!\n\n- Our contributor guidelines can be found in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md).\n- See our [contributor docs](./docs) for more information on the project. A good starting point is [Project Layout](./docs/repo/layout.md).\n\n### Building and testing\n\n<!--\nWhen updating this, also update:\n- clippy.toml\n- Cargo.toml\n- .github/workflows/lint.yml\n-->\n\nThe Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) of this project is [1.82.0](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2024/10/17/Rust-1.82.0.html).\n\nSee the book for detailed instructions on how to [build from source](https://paradigmxyz.github.io/reth/installation/source.html).\n\nTo fully test Reth, you will need to have [Geth installed](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/getting-started/installing-geth), but it is possible to run a subset of tests without Geth.\n\nFirst, clone the repository:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth\ncd reth\n```\n\nNext, run the tests:\n\n```sh\n# Without Geth\ncargo test --workspace\n\n# With Geth\ncargo test --workspace --features geth-tests\n\n# With Ethereum Foundation tests\n#\n# Note: Requires cloning https://github.com/ethereum/tests\n#\n#   cd testing/ef-tests && git clone https://github.com/ethereum/tests ethereum-tests\ncargo test -p ef-tests --features ef-tests\n```\n\nWe recommend using [`cargo nextest`](https://nexte.st/) to speed up testing. With nextest installed, simply substitute `cargo test` with `cargo nextest run`.\n\n> **Note**\n>\n> Some tests use random number generators to generate test data. If you want to use a deterministic seed, you can set the `SEED` environment variable.\n\n## Getting Help\n\nIf you have any questions, first see if the answer to your question can be found in the [book][book].\n\nIf the answer is not there:\n\n- Join the [Telegram][tg-url] to get help, or\n- Open a [discussion](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/discussions/new) with your question, or\n- Open an issue with [the bug](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/issues/new?assignees=&labels=C-bug%2CS-needs-triage&projects=&template=bug.yml)\n\n## Security\n\nSee [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md).\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nReth is a new implementation of the Ethereum protocol. In the process of developing the node we investigated the design decisions other nodes have made to understand what is done well, what is not, and where we can improve the status quo.\n\nNone of this would have been possible without them, so big shoutout to the teams below:\n\n- [Geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/): We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to the go-ethereum team for their outstanding contributions to Ethereum over the years. Their tireless efforts and dedication have helped to shape the Ethereum ecosystem and make it the vibrant and innovative community it is today. Thank you for your hard work and commitment to the project.\n- [Erigon](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon) (fka Turbo-Geth): Erigon pioneered the [\"Staged Sync\" architecture](https://erigon.substack.com/p/erigon-stage-sync-and-control-flows) that Reth is using, as well as [introduced MDBX](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon/wiki/Choice-of-storage-engine) as the database of choice. We thank Erigon for pushing the state of the art research on the performance limits of Ethereum nodes.\n- [Akula](https://github.com/akula-bft/akula/): Reth uses forks of the Apache versions of Akula's [MDBX Bindings](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/132), [FastRLP](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/63) and [ECIES](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/80) . Given that these packages were already released under the Apache License, and they implement standardized solutions, we decided not to reimplement them to iterate faster. We thank the Akula team for their contributions to the Rust Ethereum ecosystem and for publishing these packages.\n\n## Warning\n\nThe `NippyJar` and `Compact` encoding formats and their implementations are designed for storing and retrieving data internally.
