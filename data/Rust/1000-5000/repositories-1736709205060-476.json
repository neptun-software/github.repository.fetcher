          "content": "lazy-static.rs\n==============\n\nA macro for declaring lazily evaluated statics in Rust.\n\nUsing this macro, it is possible to have `static`s that require code to be\nexecuted at runtime in order to be initialized.\nThis includes anything requiring heap allocations, like vectors or hash maps,\nas well as anything that requires non-const function calls to be computed.\n\n[![Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/lazy-static.rs/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/lazy-static.rs/actions/workflows/rust.yml)\n[![Latest version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/lazy_static.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/lazy_static)\n[![Documentation](https://docs.rs/lazy_static/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/lazy_static)\n[![License](https://img.shields.io/crates/l/lazy_static.svg)](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/lazy-static.rs#license)\n\n## Minimum supported `rustc`\n\n`1.40.0+`\n\nThis version is explicitly tested in CI and may only be bumped in new minor versions. Any changes to the supported minimum version will be called out in the release notes.\n\n\n# Getting Started\n\n[lazy-static.rs is available on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/lazy_static).\nIt is recommended to look there for the newest released version, as well as links to the newest builds of the docs.\n\nAt the point of the last update of this README, the latest published version could be used like this:\n\nAdd the following dependency to your Cargo manifest...\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nlazy_static = \"1.5.0\"\n```\n\n...and see the [docs](https://docs.rs/lazy_static) for how to use it.\n\n# Example\n\n```rust\nuse lazy_static::lazy_static;\nuse std::collections::HashMap;\n\nlazy_static! {\n    static ref HASHMAP: HashMap<u32, &'static str> = {\n        let mut m = HashMap::new();\n        m.insert(0, \"foo\");\n        m.insert(1, \"bar\");\n        m.insert(2, \"baz\");\n        m\n    };\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    // First access to `HASHMAP` initializes it\n    println!(\"The entry for `0` is \\\"{}\\\".\", HASHMAP.get(&0).unwrap());\n\n    // Any further access to `HASHMAP` just returns the computed value\n    println!(\"The entry for `1` is \\\"{}\\\".\", HASHMAP.get(&1).unwrap());\n}\n```\n\n# Standard library\n\nIt is now possible to easily replicate this crate's functionality in Rust's standard library with [`std::sync::LazyLock`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.LazyLock.html). The example above could also be written as:\n\n```rust\nuse std::collections::HashMap;\nuse std::sync::LazyLock;\n\nstatic HASHMAP: LazyLock<HashMap<u32, &str>> = LazyLock::new(|| {\n    let mut m = HashMap::new();\n    m.insert(0, \"foo\");\n    m.insert(1, \"bar\");\n    m.insert(2, \"baz\");\n    m\n});\n\nfn main() {\n    // First access to `HASHMAP` initializes it\n    println!(\"The entry for `0` is \\\"{}\\\".\", HASHMAP.get(&0).unwrap());\n\n    // Any further access to `HASHMAP` just returns the computed value\n    println!(\"The entry for `1` is \\\"{}\\\".\", HASHMAP.get(&1).unwrap());\n}\n```\n\n## License\n\nLicensed under either of\n\n * Apache License, Version 2.0, ([LICENSE-APACHE](LICENSE-APACHE) or https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\n * MIT license ([LICENSE-MIT](LICENSE-MIT) or https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n\nat your option.\n\n### Contribution\n\nUnless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted\nfor inclusion in the work by you, as defined in the Apache-2.0 license, shall be dual licensed as above, without any\nadditional terms or conditions.\n"
