The API will change quite frequently. Things might crash, or not work as intended. The user experience will not be great.\n\nI am releasing `unreal-rust` on github to develop it in the open.\n\n## 🎯 Features\n\n- **Simple opinionated bindings**: Easy access to core APIs like playing sounds, spawning actors, pathfinding, physics etc.\n- **Developer friendly**: Fast iteration times with hot reloading in the editor and during live play. Panics are caught and do not crash the editor\n- **Editor integration**: Add Rust components to actors in the editor, or access Rust components from Blueprint to drive animations.\n- **Entity Component System**: unreal-rust is built on top of an ECS.\n- **Built on top of `AActor`**: Most gameplay features like `GameMode`, `Characters`, `GameState`, `GAS` are not directly accessible in unreal-rust. Instead unreal-rust will provide optional alternatives. But you can still interact with most parts of the engine as Rust components can be accessed in Blueprint.\n- **No engine modifications**: unreal-rust is only a `Plugin`, just drop it in your project. See [Supported versions](#supported-versions) for more information.\n- **Samples**: The development of unreal-rust is heavily driven by samples.\n- **Free**: Dual licensed under MIT/APACHE\n\n## 🖥️ Supported Platforms\n\n* 🐧 Linux\n* 🪟 Windows\n\nPotential future platforms: iOS, macOS, Android, html5/browser(possibly)\n\nConsoles are unsupported. I simply can not offer console support as it is a closed off ecosystem. Nor do I have access to any developer kits myself.\n\n## 💌 Blog posts / media\n\n* [Announcing Unreal Rust](https://maikklein.github.io/unreal-rust-1/)\n* [unreal-rust devlog](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLps1NSMUeqzicmTej83z-n1J383u1UVq1)\n\n\n## 🚩 Known problems\n\n- This is just a hobby project of mine that I work on outside of my normal work hours. I might be slow to respond to issues, questions, feature requests, or PR reviews.\n\n## 🦮 Getting started\n\n### Running the example\n\n_I am aware that these are a lot of steps. I am sorry, I will try to simplify this in the future_\n\n* Prerequisites:\n* * [Unreal Engine 5](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/unreal-engine-5). For Linux users you can get it [here](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/linux)\n* * Get [git lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/), and run `git lfs install`\n* * [ue4cli](https://docs.adamrehn.com/ue4cli/overview/introduction-to-ue4cli), You can get it with `pip3 install ue4cli`. This step is optional but I will use `ue4cli` in this guide.\n* * [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)\n\nWe start by cloning this repository \n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/MaikKlein/unreal-rust\n```\n\nNext we clone the submodule. This will download the actual example with all the assets.\n\n```\ncd unreal-rust\ngit submodule update --init\n```\n\nNext we need to setup the example\n\n- - Linux `sh setup.sh`\n- - Windows `setup.bat`\n\nThis will symlink the `RustPlugin` into the unreal `example/RustExample/Plugin` folder.\n\nNow we need to build the actual Rust code:\n\nSimply run\n\n```\ncargo build --release\n```\n\nThis will build the whole project. This also produces our dll that we are going to load into Unreal.\n\nCopy the dll/so file into the project \n\n* Linux: `cp target/release/libunreal_rust_example.so example/RustExample/Binaries/rustplugin.so`\n* Windows: `copy .\\target\\release\\unreal_rust_example.dll .\\example\\RustExample\\Binaries\\rustplugin.dll`\n\nNow we need to build the unreal example\n\n```\ncd example/RustExample\nue4 build Development Editor\n```\n\nNow you can run the example with `ue4 run`\n\n## 🚀 Supported versions\n\n- `5.0`\n\nThis project will always try to support the latest version.\n\n- Latest version of Unreal\n- Latest version of Rust\n- Latest version of all dependencies\n\n## 🤝 Alternatives\n\n* [Unreal Angelscript](https://angelscript.hazelight.se/)\n* [UnrealCLR](https://github.com/nxrighthere/UnrealCLR)\n\n## 🥰 Thank you\n\n* [kenney](https://kenney.nl/), [quaternius](https://www.patreon.com/quaternius)\n* [bevy](https://bevyengine.org/)\n"
