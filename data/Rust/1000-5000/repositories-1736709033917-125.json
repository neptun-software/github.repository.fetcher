          "content": "# Contributing\n\nFirst, thank you for contributing to OpenDAL! The goal of this document is to provide everything you need to start contributing to OpenDAL. The following TOC is sorted progressively, starting with the basics and expanding into more specifics.\n\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\n  - [Your First Contribution](#your-first-contribution)\n  - [Workflow](#workflow)\n    - [Git Branches](#git-branches)\n    - [GitHub Pull Requests](#github-pull-requests)\n      - [Title](#title)\n      - [Reviews \\& Approvals](#reviews--approvals)\n      - [Merge Style](#merge-style)\n    - [CI](#ci)\n  - [Setup](#setup)\n    - [Using a dev container environment](#using-a-dev-container-environment)\n    - [Bring your own toolbox](#bring-your-own-toolbox)\n  - [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct)\n\n## Your First Contribution\n\n1. Ensure your change has an issue! Find an [existing issue](https://github.com/apache/opendal/issues) or [open a new issue](https://github.com/apache/opendal/issues/new).\n1. [Fork the OpenDAL repository](https://github.com/apache/opendal/fork) in your own GitHub account.\n1. [Create a new Git branch](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository).\n1. Make your changes.\n1. [Submit the branch as a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) to the main OpenDAL repo. An OpenDAL team member should comment and/or review your pull request within a few days. Although, depending on the circumstances, it may take longer.\n\n## Workflow\n\n### Git Branches\n\n*All* changes must be made in a branch and submitted as [pull requests](#github-pull-requests). OpenDAL does not adopt any type of branch naming style, but please use something descriptive of your changes.\n\n### GitHub Pull Requests\n\nOnce your changes are ready you must submit your branch as a [pull request](https://github.com/apache/opendal/pulls).\n\n#### Title\n\nThe pull request title must follow the format outlined in the [conventional commits spec](https://www.conventionalcommits.org). [Conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) is a standardized format for commit messages. OpenDAL only requires this format for commits on the `main` branch. And because OpenDAL squashes commits before merging branches, this means that only the pull request title must conform to this format.\n\nThe following are all good examples of pull request titles:\n\n```text\nfeat(services/gcs): Add start-after support for list\ndocs: add hdfs classpath related troubleshoot\nci: Mark job as skipped if owner is not apache\nfix(services/s3): Ignore prefix if it's empty\nrefactor: Polish the implementation of webhdfs\n```\n\n#### Reviews & Approvals\n\nAll pull requests should be reviewed by at least one OpenDAL committer.\n\n#### Merge Style\n\nAll pull requests are squash merged.\nWe generally discourage large pull requests that are over 300–500 lines of diff.\nIf you would like to propose a change that is larger, we suggest\ncoming onto our [Discussions](https://github.com/apache/opendal/discussions) and discussing it with us.\nThis way we can talk through the solution and discuss if a change that large is even needed!\nThis will produce a quicker response to the change and likely produce code that aligns better with our process.\n\n### CI\n\nCurrently, OpenDAL uses GitHub Actions to run tests. The workflows are defined in `.github/workflows`.\n\n## Setup\n\nFor small or first-time contributions, we recommend the dev container method. Prefer to do it yourself? That's fine too!\n\n### Using a dev container environment\n\nOpenDAL provides a pre-configured [dev container](https://containers.dev/)\nthat could be used in [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces),\n[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/remote-development/gateway/),\n[JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).\nPlease pick up your favourite runtime environment.\n\nThe fastest way is:\n\n[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/apache/opendal?quickstart=1&machine=standardLinux32gb)\n\n### Bring your own toolbox\n\nOpenDAL is primarily a Rust project. To build OpenDAL, you will need to set up Rust development first. We highly recommend using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) for the setup process.\n\nFor Linux or macOS, use the following command:\n\n```shell\ncurl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh\n```\n\nFor Windows, download `rustup-init.exe` from [here](https://win.rustup.rs/x86_64) instead.\n\nRustup will read OpenDAL's `rust-toolchain.toml` and set up everything else automatically. To ensure that everything works correctly, run `cargo version` under OpenDAL's root directory:\n\n```shell\n$ cargo version\ncargo 1.69.0 (6e9a83356 2023-04-12)\n```\n\nSome components may require specific setup steps. Please refer to their respective `CONTRIBUTING` documentation for more details.\n\n- [Core](core/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- [Node.js Binding](bindings/nodejs/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- [Python Binding](bindings/python/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nWe expect all community members to follow our [Code of Conduct](https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct.html).\n"

Built as an extension.\n- [Pants](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants): A fast, scalable, user-friendly build system for codebases of all sizes.\n- [QuestDB](https://github.com/questdb/questdb): An open-source time-series database for high throughput ingestion and fast SQL queries with operational simplicity.\n- [RisingWave](https://github.com/risingwavelabs/risingwave): A Distributed SQL Database for Stream Processing\n- [Vector](https://github.com/vectordotdev/vector): A high-performance observability data pipeline.\n\n### C Binding\n\n- [Milvus](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus): A cloud-native vector database, storage for next generation AI applications\n\n### Java Binding\n\n- [QuestDB](https://github.com/questdb/questdb): An open-source time-series database for high throughput ingestion and fast SQL queries with operational simplicity.\n\n## Branding\n\nThe first and most prominent mentions must use the full form: **Apache OpenDAL™** of the name for any individual usage (webpage, handout, slides, etc.) Depending on the context and writing style, you should use the full form of the name sufficiently often to ensure that readers clearly understand the association of both the OpenDAL project and the OpenDAL software product to the ASF as the parent organization.\n\nFor more details, see the [Apache Product Name Usage Guide](https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/guide).\n\n## License and Trademarks\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0: <http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0>\n\nApache OpenDAL, OpenDAL, and Apache are either registered trademarks or trademarks of the Apache Software Foundation.\n"
