By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    {one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.}\n    Copyright (C) {year}  {name of author}\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    {project}  Copyright (C) {year}  {fullname}\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.en.html>.\n\n### Parity Trie\n\n                                 Apache License\n                           Version 2.0, January 2004\n                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/\n\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\n\n   1.

[#12192](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/12192)\n* Relaxing Congestion Control to allow accepting and buffering more transactions. [#12241](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/12241) [#12430](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/12430)\n* Exclude contract code out of state witness and distribute it separately. [#11099](https://github.com/near/nearcore/issues/11099)\n\n### Non-protocol Changes\n* **Epoch Sync V4**: A capability to bootstrap a node from another active node. [#73](https://github.com/near/near-one-project-tracking/issues/73)\n* **Decentralized state sync**: Before, nodes that needed to download state\n(either because they're several epochs behind the chain or because they're going to start producing chunks for a shard they don't currently track)\nwould download them from a centralized GCS bucket. Now, nodes will attempt to download pieces of the state from peers in the network,\nand only fallback to downloading from GCS if that fails. Please note that in order to participate in providing state parts to peers,\nyour node may generate snapshots of the state. These snapshots should not take too much space,\nsince they're hard links to database files that get cleaned up on every epoch. [#12004](https://github.com/near/nearcore/issues/12004)\n\n## 2.3.0\n\n### Protocol Changes\n* Sets `chunk_validator_only_kickout_threshold` to 70. Uses this kickout threshold as a cutoff threshold for contribution of endorsement ratio in rewards calculation: if endorsement ratio is above 70%, the contribution of endorsement ratio in average uptime calculation is 100%, otherwise it is 0%. Endorsements received are now included in `BlockHeader` to improve kickout and reward calculation for chunk validators. \n\n### Non-protocol Changes\n* Added [documentation](./docs/misc/archival_data_recovery.md) and a [reference](./scripts/recover_missing_archival_data.sh) script to recover the data lost in archival nodes at the beginning of 2024.\n* **Archival nodes only:** Stop saving partial chunks to `PartialChunks` column in the Cold DB. Instead, archival nodes will reconstruct partial chunks from the `Chunks` column.\n* Enabled state snapshots on every epoch to allow the nodes to take part in decentralized state sync in future releases.\n\n## 2.2.1\n\nThis release patches a bug found in the 2.2.0 release\n\n# Non-protocol changes\nThere was a bug in the integration between ethereum implicit accounts and the compiled contract cache which sometimes caused the nodes to get stuck. This would most often happen during state sync, but could also happen by itself. Please update your nodes to avoid getting stuck.\n\nA node that hits this bug will print an error about an `InvalidStateRoot` in the logs and then it'll be unable to sync.\nIt's possible to recover a stalled node by clearing the compiled contract cache and rolling back one block:\n1. Stop the neard process\n2. Download the new version of neard\n3. Clear the compiled contract cache: rm -rf ~/.near/data/contracts\n4. Undo the last block: ./neard undo-block\n5. Start neard\n\nAfter that the node should be able to recover and sync with the rest of the network.\n\n## 2.2.0\n\n### Protocol Changes\n* The minimum validator stake has been set to a lower value. The small-stake validators that were kicked out during the shift to stateless validation will be able to rejoin the network.\n* Better algorithm for validator kickouts\n* (Testnet only) update the eth-implicit accounts contract on testnet to match the one on mainnet.\n\n### Non-protocol Changes\n* Fix spammy messages about calculating gas for PromiseYield receipts.\n* Don't crash when the CPU doesn't have SHA-NI instructions. It's still a hardware requirement, there is no guarantee that nodes without this instruction will be able to keep up with the network, but `neard` will now be able to run (slowly) on CPUs without this instruction.\n\n## 2.1.0\n\n### Protocol Changes\n* Eth-Implicit Accounts [NEP-0518](https://github.com/near/NEPs/pull/518)\n* Host Functions for BLS12-381 Curve Operations [NEP-0488](https://github.com/near/NEPs/pull/488)\n\n### Non-protocol Changes\n\n* Enforce rate limits to received network messages [#11617](https://github.com/near/nearcore/issues/11617). Rate limits are configured by default, but they can be overridden through the experimental configuration option `received_messages_rate_limits`.\n\n* Increase sync blocks requested and make it configurable through a parameter in the client config [#11820](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/11820). Increase default max sync block requests to 10 from 5.\n\n## 2.0.0\n\n### Protocol Changes\n* Congestion Control [NEP-0539](https://github.com/near/NEPs/pull/539)\n* Stateless Validation [NEP-0509](https://github.com/near/NEPs/pull/509)\n\n### Non-protocol Changes\n**No Changes**\n\n## 1.40.0\n\n### Protocol Changes\n\n**No Changes**\n\n### Non-protocol Changes\n\n## 1.39.0\n\n### Protocol Changes\n\n* Use more precise gas costs for function calls [#10943](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/10943) that should lead to more efficient chunk utilization. \n\n### Non-protocol Changes\n\n* Limit overcharging by decoupling minimum_new_receipt_gas from the function call and setting it to a constant value. [#10941](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/10941)\n* These PRs introduce a change in the default behaviour of `broadcast_tx_commit`,`send_tx`, `tx, EXPERIMENTAL_tx_status` RPC methods. The default behaviour no longer waits for refund receipts.\n  If you do need to wait for refund receipts, you need ask about it explicitly by using TxExecutionStatus::Final option (\"wait_until\": \"FINAL\" in the json request). More information in the\n  [#10792](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/10792) [#10948](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/10948)\n* Adds improvements to the `sweat` contract prefetcher logic. Add new prefetcher logic for `kaiching` contract. [#10899](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/10899)\n* Improves prefetcher logic to speedup chunk finalization by prefetching keys related to refund receipts and actions such as: Delegate, AddKey, DeleteKey. [#10936](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/10936)\n* Add more metrics for receipt processing. [#10944](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/10944)\n\n## 1.37.0\n\n### Protocol Changes\n\n* Resharding v2 - new implementation for resharding and a new shard layout for production networks. [#10303](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/10303), [NEP-0508](https://github.com/near/NEPs/pull/508)\n* Restrict the creation of non-implicit top-level account that are longer than 32 bytes. Only the registrar account can create them. [#9589](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/9589)\n* Adjust the number of block producers and chunk producers on testnet to facilitate testing of chunk-only producers [#9563](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/9563)\n\n\n### Non-protocol Changes\n\n* Add prometheus metrics for the internal state of the doomslug. [#9458](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/9458)\n* Fix `EXPERIMENTAL_protocol_config` to apply overrides from `EpochConfig`. [#9692](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/9692)\n* Add config option `tx_routing_height_horizon` to configure how many chunk producers are notified about the tx. [#10251](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/10251)\n\n## 1.36.0\n\n### Protocol Changes\n\n* The support for fixed shards in shard layout was removed. [#9219](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/9219)\n\n### Non-protocol Changes\n\n* New option `transaction_pool_size_limit` in `config.json` allows to limit the size of the node's transaction pool.\n  By default the limit is set to 100 MB. [#3284](https://github.com/near/nearcore/issues/3284)\n* Database snapshots at the end of an epoch. This lets a node obtain state parts using flat storage. [#9090](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/9090)\n* Number of transactions included in a chunk will be lowered if there is a congestion of more than 20000 delayed receipts in a shard. [#9222](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/9222)\n* Our more efficient and scalable V2 routing protocol is implemented. It shadows the V1 protocol for now while we verify its performance. [#9187](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/9187)\n* The default config now enables TIER1 outbound connections by default. [#9349](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/9349)\n* State Sync from GCS is available for experimental use. [#9398](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/9398)\n\n## 1.35.0\n\n### Protocol Changes\n\n* Upgrade the contract preparation code to use [finite-wasm](https://github.com/near/finite-wasm), which guarantees deterministic limits on execution time and space of compiled contracts\n\n### Non-protocol Changes\n\n* Dump state by multiple nodes, each node will refer to s3 for which parts need to be dumped. [#9049](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/9049)\n* Small values in the flat storage trie are inlined for faster accesses [#9029](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/9029)\n* A current protocol version metric is added to the prometheus metrics under near_current_protocol_version [#9030](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/9030)\n* The transaction pool size is tracked, and if the `transaction_pool_size_limit` config option is set, we now avoid storing more than the specified size of transactions in each shard's transaction pool [#8970](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/8970) and [#9036](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/9036)\n\n## 1.34.0\n\n### Protocol Changes\n\n* Flat Storage for reads, reducing number of DB accesses for state read from `2 * key.len()` in the worst case to 2. [#8761](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/8761), [NEP-399](https://github.com/near/NEPs/pull/399)\n* Contract preparation and gas charging for wasm execution also switched to using our own code, as per the finite-wasm specification. Contract execution gas costs will change slightly for expected use cases. This opens up opportunities for further changing the execution gas costs (eg. with different costs per opcode) to lower contract execution cost long-term. [#8912](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/8912)\n* Compute Costs are implemented and stabilized. Compute usage of the chunk is now limited according to the compute costs. [#8915](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/8915), [NEP-455](https://github.com/near/NEPs/blob/master/neps/nep-0455.md).\n* Write related storage compute costs are increased which means they fill a chunk sooner but gas costs are unaffected. [#8924](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/8924)\n\n### Non-protocol Changes\n\n* undo-block tool to reset the chain head from current head to its prev block. Use the tool by running: `./target/release/neard undo-block`. [#8681](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/8681)\n* Add prometheus metrics for expected number of blocks/chunks at the end of the epoch. [#8759](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/8759)\n* Node can sync State from S3. [#8789](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/8789)\n* Node can sync State from local filesystem. [#8913](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/8913)\n* Add per shard granularity for chunks in validator info metric. [#8934](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/8934)\n\n## 1.33.0\n\n### Protocol Changes\n\n### Non-protocol Changes\n* State-viewer tool to dump and apply state changes from/to a range of blocks. [#8628](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/8628)\n* Experimental option to dump state of every epoch to external storage. [#8661](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/8661)\n* Add prometheus metrics for tracked shards, block height within epoch, if is block/chunk producer. [#8728](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/8728)\n* State sync is disabled by default [#8730](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/8730)\n* Node can restart if State Sync gets interrupted. [#8732](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/8732)\n* Merged two `neard view-state` commands: `apply-state-parts` and `dump-state-parts` into a single `state-parts` command. [#8739](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/8739)\n* Add config.network.experimental.network_config_overrides to the JSON config. [#8871](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/8871)\n\n## 1.32.2\n\n### Fixes\n* Fix: rosetta zero balance accounts [#8833](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/8833)\n\n## 1.32.1\n\n### Fixes\n* Fix vulnerabilities in block outcome root validation and total supply validation [#8790](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/8790)\n\n## 1.32.0\n\n### Protocol Changes\n* Stabilize `ed25519_verify` feature: introducing a host function to verify\ned25519 signatures efficiently.\n[#8098](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/8098)\n[NEP-364](https://github.com/near/NEPs/pull/364)\n* Added STUN-based self-discovery to make configuration of TIER1 network easier in the simplest validator setups.\n  [#8472](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/8472)\n* Stabilize zero balance account feature: allows account to not hold balance under certain conditions\nand enables a more smooth onboarding experience where users don't have to first acquire NEAR tokens\nto pay for the storage of their accounts.\n[#8378](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/8378)\n[NEP-448](https://github.com/near/NEPs/pull/448)\n* Stabilize meta transactions on the protocol level.\n[NEP-366](https://github.com/near/NEPs/blob/master/neps/nep-0366.md),\n[Tracking issue #8075](https://github.com/near/nearcore/issues/8075),\n[Stabilization #8601](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/8601)\n\n### Non-protocol Changes\n* Config validation can be done by following command:\n  `./target/debug/neard --home {path_to_config_files} validate-config`.\n  This will show error if there are file issues or semantic issues in `config.json`, `genesis.json`, `records.json`, `node_key.json` and `validator_key.json`.\n  [#8485](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/8485)\n* Comments are allowed in configs. This includes\n  `config.json`, `genesis.json`, `node_key.json` and `validator_key.json`. You can use `//`, `#` and `/*...*/` for comments.\n  [#8423](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/8423)\n* `/debug` page now has client_config linked.\n  You can also check your client_config directly at /debug/client_config\n  [#8400](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/8400)\n* Added cold store loop - a background thread that copies data from hot to cold storage and a new json rpc endpoing - split_storage_info - that\n  exposes debug info about the split storage.\n  [#8432](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/8432)\n* `ClientConfig` can be updated while the node is running.\n  `dyn_config.json` is no longer needed as its contents were merged into `config.json`.\n  [#8240](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/8240)\n* TIER2 network stabilization. Long-lasting active connections are persisted to DB and are re-established automatically if either node restarts. A new neard flag `--connect-to-reliable-peers-on-startup` is provided to toggle this behavior; it defaults to true. The PeerStore is no longer persisted to DB and is now kept in-memory. [#8579](https://github.com/near/nearcore/issues/8579), [#8580](https://github.com/near/nearcore/issues/8580).\n\n## 1.31.0\n\n### Non-protocol Changes\n\n* Enable TIER1 network. Participants of the BFT consensus (block & chunk producers) now can establish direct TIER1 connections\n  between each other, which will optimize the communication latency and minimize the number of dropped chunks.\n  To configure this feature, see [advanced\\_configuration/networking](./docs/advanced_configuration/networking.md).\n  [#8141](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/8141)\n  [#8085](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/8085)\n  [#7759](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/7759)\n* [Network] Started creating connections with larger nonces, that are periodically\n  refreshed Start creating connections (edges) with large nonces\n  [#7966](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/7966)\n* `/status` response has now two more fields: `node_public_key` and\n  `validator_public_key`.  The `node_key` field is now deprecated and should not\n  be used since it confusingly holds validator key.\n  [#7828](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/7828)\n* Added `near_node_protocol_upgrade_voting_start` Prometheus metric whose value\n  is timestamp when voting for the next protocol version starts.\n  [#7877](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/7877)\n* neard cmd can now verify proofs from JSON files.\n  [#7840](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/7840)\n* In storage configuration, the value `trie_cache_capacities` now is no longer\n  a hard limit but instead sets a memory consumption limit. For large trie nodes,\n  the limits are close to equivalent. For small values, there can now fit more\n  in the cache than previously.\n  [#7749](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/7749)\n* New options `store.trie_cache` and `store.view_trie_cache` in `config.json`\n  to set limits on the trie cache. Deprecates the never announced\n  `store.trie_cache_capacities` option which was mentioned in previous change.\n  [#7578](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/7578)\n* New option `store.background_migration_threads` in `config.json`. Defines\n  number of threads to execute background migrations of storage. Currently used\n  for flat storage migration. Set to 8 by default, can be reduced if it slows down\n  block processing too much or increased if you want to speed up migration.\n  [#8088](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/8088),\n* Tracing of work across actix workers within a process:\n  [#7866](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/7866),\n  [#7819](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/7819),\n  [#7773](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/7773).\n* Scope of collected tracing information can be configured at run-time:\n  [#7701](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/7701).\n* Attach node's `chain_id`, `node_id`, and `account_id` values to tracing\n  information: [#7711](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/7711).\n* Change exporter of tracing information from `opentelemetry-jaeger` to\n  `opentelemetry-otlp`: [#7563](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/7563).\n* Tracing of requests across processes:\n  [#8004](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/8004).\n* Gas profiles as displayed in the `EXPERIMENTAL_tx_status` are now more\n  detailed and give the gas cost per parameter.\n\n## 1.30.0\n\n### Protocol Changes\n\n* Stabilize `account_id_in_function_call_permission` feature: enforcing validity\n  of account ids in function call permission.\n  [#7569](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/7569)\n\n### Non-protocol Changes\n\n* `use_db_migration_snapshot` and `db_migration_snapshot_path` options are now\n  deprecated.  If they are set in `config.json` the node will fail if migration\n  needs to be performed.  Use `store.migration_snapshot` instead to configure\n  the behaviour [#7486](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/7486)\n* Added `near_peer_message_sent_by_type_bytes` and\n  `near_peer_message_sent_by_type_total` Prometheus metrics measuring\n  size and number of messages sent to peers.\n  [#7523](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/7523)\n* `near_peer_message_received_total` Prometheus metric is now deprecated.\n  Instead of it aggregate `near_peer_message_received_by_type_total` metric.\n  For example, to get total rate of received messages use\n  `sum(rate(near_peer_message_received_by_type_total{...}[5m]))`.\n  [#7548](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/7548)\n* Few changes to `view_state` JSON RPC query:\n  - The request has now an optional `include_proof` argument.  When set to\n    `true`, response’s `proof` will be populated.\n  - The `proof` within each value in `values` list of a `view_state` response is\n    now deprecated and will be removed in the future.  Client code should ignore\n    the field.\n  - The `proof` field directly within `view_state` response is currently always\n    sent even if proof has not been requested.  In the future the field will be\n    skipped in those cases.  Clients should accept responses with this field\n    missing (unless they set `include_proof`).\n    [#7603](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/7603)\n* Backtraces on panics are enabled by default, so you no longer need to set\n  `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environmental variable. To disable backtraces, set\n  `RUST_BACKTRACE=0`. [#7562](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/7562)\n* Enable receipt prefetching by default. This feature makes receipt processing\n  faster by parallelizing IO requests, which has been introduced in\n  [#7590](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/7590) and enabled by default\n  with [#7661](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/7661).\n  Configurable in `config.json` using `store.enable_receipt_prefetching`.\n\n## 1.29.0 [2022-08-15]\n\n### Protocol Changes\n\n* Stabilized `protocol_feature_chunk_only_producers`. Validators will\n  now be assigned to blocks and chunks separately.\n* The validator uptime kickout threshold has been reduced to 80%\n* Edge nonces between peers can now optionally indicate an expiration\n  time\n\n### Non-protocol Changes\n\n* The logic around forwarding chunks to validators is improved\n* Approvals and partial encoded chunks are now sent multiple times,\n  which should reduce stalls due to lost approvals when the network is\n  under high load\n* We now keep a list of \"TIER1\" accounts (validators) for whom\n  latency/reliability of messages routed through the network is\n  critical\n* /debug HTTP page has been improved\n* Messages aren't routed through peers that are too far behind\n* Log lines printed every 10 seconds are now less expensive to compute\n* message broadcasts have been improved/optimized\n* `network.external_address` field in config.json file is deprecated. In\n  fact it has never been used and only served to confuse everyone\n  [#7300](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/7300)\n* Due to increasing state size, improved shard cache for Trie nodes to\n  put more nodes in memory. Requires 3 GB more RAM\n  [#7429](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/7429)\n\n## 1.28.0 [2022-07-27]\n\n### Protocol Changes\n\n* Stabilized `alt_bn128_g1_multiexp`, `alt_bn128_g1_sum`, `alt_bn128_pairing_check` host functions [#6813](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/6813).\n\n### Non-protocol Changes\n\n* Added `path` option to `StoreConfig` which makes location to the\n  RocksDB configurable via `config.json` file (at `store.path` path)\n  rather than being hard-coded to `data` directory in neard home\n  directory [#6938](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/6938)\n* Removed `testnet` alias for `localnet` command; it’s been deprecated\n  since 1.24 [#7033](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/7033)\n* Removed undocumented `unsafe_reset_all` and `unsafe_reset_data`\n  commands; they were deprecated since 1.25\n* Key files can use `private_key` field instead of `secret_key` now;\n  this improves interoperability with near cli which uses the former\n  name [#7030](https://github.com/near/nearcore/issues/7030)\n* Latency of network messages is now measured\n  [#7050](https://github.com/near/nearcore/issues/7050)\n\n\n## 1.27.0 [2022-06-22]\n\n### Protocol Changes\n\n* Introduced protobuf encoding as the new network protocol. Borsh support will be removed in two releases as per normal protocol upgrade policies [#6672](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/6672)\n\n### Non-protocol Changes\n\n* Added `near_peer_message_received_by_type_bytes` [#6661](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/6661) and `near_dropped_message_by_type_and_reason_count` [#6678](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/6678) metrics.\n* Removed `near_<msg-type>_{total,bytes}` [#6661](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/6661), `near_<msg-type>_dropped`, `near_drop_message_unknown_account` and `near_dropped_messages_count` [#6678](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/6678) metrics.\n* Added `near_action_called_count` metric [#6679]((https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/6679)\n* Removed `near_action_<action-type>_total` metrics [#6679]((https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/6679)\n* Added `near_build_info` metric which exports neard’s build information [#6680](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/6680)\n* Make it possible to update logging at runtime: [#6665](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/6665)\n* Use correct cost in gas profile for adding function call key [#6749](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/6749)\n\n## 1.26.0 [2022-05-18]\n\n### Protocol Changes\n\n* Enable access key nonce range for implicit accounts to prevent tx hash collisions [#5482](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/5482)\n* Include `promise_batch_action_function_call_weight` host function on the runtime [#6285](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/6285) [#6536](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/6536)\n* Increase deployment cost [#6397](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/6397)\n* Limit the number of locals per contract to 1_000_000\n* Ensure caching all nodes in the chunk for which touching trie node cost was charged, reduce cost of future reads in a chunk [#6628](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/6628)\n* Lower storage key limit to 2 KiB\n\n### Non-protocol Changes\n\n* Switch to LZ4+ZSTD compression from Snappy in RocksDB [#6365](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/6365)\n* Moved Client Actor to separate thread - should improve performance [#6333](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/6333)\n* Safe DB migrations using RocksDB checkpoints [#6282](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/6282)\n* [NEP205](https://github.com/near/NEPs/issues/205): Configurable start of protocol upgrade voting [#6309](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/6309)\n* Make max_open_files and col_state_cache_size parameters configurable [#6584](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/6584)\n* Make RocksDB block_size configurable [#6631](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/6631)\n* Increase default max_open_files RocksDB parameter from 512 to 10k [#6607](https://github.com/near/nearcore/pull/6607)\n* Use kebab-case names for neard subcommands to make them consistent with flag names.  snake_case names are still valid for existing subcommands but kebab-case will be used for new commands.\n\n## 1.25.0 [2022-03-16]\n\n### Protocol Changes\n* `max_gas_burnt` has been increased to 300.\n\n### Non-protocol Changes\n* More Prometheus metrics related to epoch, sync state, node version, chunk fullness and missing chunks have been added.\n* Progress bar is now displayed when downloading `config.json` and `genesis.json`.\n* Status line printed in logs by `neard` is now more descriptive.\n- `view_state` is now a command of `neard`; `state-viewer` is no longer a separate binary.\n- `RUST_LOG` environment variable is now correctly respected.\n- `NetworkConfig::verify` will now fail if configuration is invalid rather than printing error and continuing.\n- Fixed a minor bug which resulted in DB Not Found errors when requesting chunks.\n- Updated to wasmer-near 2.2.0 which fixes a potential crash and improves cost estimator working.\n- `neard init` will no longer override node or validator private keys.\n- Rosetta RPC now populates `related_transactions` field.\n- Rosetta RPC support is now compiled in by default.

          "content": "Thank you for your interest in contributing to the NEAR reference client!  We\nwelcome contributions from everyone.  Below are various bits of information to\nhelp you get started.  If you require additional help, please reach out to us on\nour [zulip channel](https://near.zulipchat.com/).\n\n## Quick Start\n\nnearcore is a fairly standard Rust project, so building is as easy as\n\n```console\n$ cargo build\n```\n\nBuilding nearcore requires a fairly recent Rust compiler (get it\n[here](https://rustup.rs)), as well as `clang` and `cmake` to build RocksDB\n(`sudo apt install cmake clang`).\n\nSadly at the moment nearcore is only compatible with Linux and MacOS, Windows is\nnot supported yet.\n\nTo run a local NEAR network with one node, use\n\n```console\n$ cargo run -p neard -- init # generates various configs in ~/.near\n$ cargo run -p neard -- run\n```\n\nYou can now use your own node's HTTP RPC API (e.g.\n[httpie](https://httpie.io/docs/cli/installation))\n\n```console\n$ http get http://localhost:3030/status\n$ http post http://localhost:3030/ method=query jsonrpc=2.0 id=1 \\\n     params:='{\"request_type\": \"view_account\", \"finality\": \"final\", \"account_id\": \"test.near\"}'\n```\n\nThe RPC is documented [here](https://docs.near.org/api/rpc/introduction), and\ncan be conveniently accessed from the command line [NEAR\nCLI](https://docs.near.org/tools/near-cli) utility.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nTo learn more about how nearcore works, skim through our guide to nearcore\ndevelopment:\n\nhttps://near.github.io/nearcore/\n\nIf you are looking for relatively simple tasks to familiarise yourself with\n`nearcore`, please check out issues labeled with the `C-good-first-issue` label\n[here](https://github.com/near/nearcore/labels/C-good-first-issue).  If you see\none that looks interesting and is unassigned or has not been actively worked on\nin some time, please ask to have the issue assigned to you and someone from\nthe team should help you get started.  We do not always keep the issue tracker\nup-to-date, so if you do not find an interesting task to work on, please ask for\nhelp on our zulip channel.\n\nIf you have an idea for an enhancement to the protocol itself, please make a\nproposal by following the [NEAR Enhancement\nProposal](https://github.com/near/NEPs/blob/master/neps/nep-0001.md) process.\n\n## Pull Requests\n\nAll the contributions to `nearcore` happen via Pull Requests.  Please follow the\nfollowing steps when creating a PR:\n\n1. Fork the `nearcore` repository and create a new branch there to do your work.\n2. The branch can contain any number of commits.  When merged, all commits will\n   be squashed into a single commit.\n3. The changes should be thoroughly tested.  Please refer to [this\n   document](https://github.com/near/nearcore/blob/master/docs/practices/testing/README.md)\n   for our testing guidelines and an overview of the testing infrastructure.\n4. When ready, send a pull request against the `master` branch of the `nearcore`\n   repository.\n5. Feel free to submit draft PRs to get early feedback and to make sure you are\n   on the right track.\n6. The PR name should follow the template: `<type>: <name>`.  Where `type` is:\n   - `fix` for bug fixes;\n   - `feat` for new features;\n   - `refactor` for changes that reorganize code without adding new content;\n   - `doc` for changes that change documentation or comments;\n   - `test` for changes that introduce new tests;\n   - `chore` for grunt tasks like updating dependencies.\n7. The PR should also contain a description when appropriate to provide\n   additional information to help the reviewer inspect the proposed change.\n8. If your PR introduces a user-observable change (e.g. a new protocol feature,\n   new configuration option, new Prometheus metric etc.) please document it in\n   [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) in the `[unreleased]` section.\n9. It is important to select the ` Allow edits and access to secrets by\n   maintainers` checkbox on the PR.  Without this option, the merge bot will not\n   have sufficient rights to be able to merge the PR when it is approved.  It\n   also allows the maintainers to make trivial changes to the PR as necessary.\n   Please see\n   [these](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)\n   [links](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63341296/github-pull-request-allow-edits-by-maintainers)\n   for the implications of selecting the checkbox.\n\n## After the PR is submitted\n\n1. We have a CI process configured to run various tests on each PR.  All tests\nneed to pass before a PR can be merged.\n2. When all the comments from the reviewer(s) have been addressed, they should\napprove the PR allowing a PR to be merged.\n3. Before merging a PR, the code should be reviewed properly. In particular, the\nperson who clicks \"Merge when ready\" has specific duties, exposed in the last\nparagraph of the \"Code review process\" section below.\n4. An approved PR can be merged by clicking the \"Merge when ready\" button.  The\nbutton can be clicked by the author if they have the appropriate access, or by a\nreviewer otherwise.  PR authors can also click the button immediately after filing\na PR; removing an additional round-trip after the PR gets approved. The PR author\nwill be notified by email by github if the PR fails to land, once it has entered\nthe merge queue (ie. after it has passed PR CI and gotten an approving review).\n\n## Code review process\n\nWe have two groups of code reviewers:  Super owners and normal owners.  When a\nPR is created:\n\n- a super owner will be automatically assigned to review.\n- they may choose to review the PR themselves or they may delegate to someone else\nwho belongs either to the super owners or the normal owners group.\n- the delegate will perform the review and as needed engage other reviewers as\nwell.  They will review your tests, and make sure that they can convince\nthemselves the test coverage is adequate before they even look into the\nchange, so make sure you tested all the corner cases.\n- it is normal to sometimes require multiple rounds of reviews to get a PR\n  merged.  If your PR received some feedback from a reviewer, use the [github\n  UI](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40893008/how-to-resume-review-process-after-updating-pull-request-at-github)\n  to re-request a review.\n\nThe author is also free to directly request reviews from specific persons\n[through the github\nui](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review).\nIn this case, the automatically selected super owner will ensure that the\nselected reviewer is sufficient or additional reviewers are needed.\n\nThe process for becoming a code reviewer is relatively straightforward.\nThe candidate should have a good understanding of the codebase and then\nthe existing super owners will discuss and approve the addition.  These\ndiscussions take place on zulip so if you are interested in becoming a\ncode reviewer, please reach out to us there.\n\nThe person who clicks the \"Merge when ready\" button is the one who\nguarantees that no unreviewed code was added between the approving review\nand the commit that is being landed. They must be especially careful of\ncommits that might have happened before the review, but not have been\nreviewed (eg. because the review was already in progress), as they will\nshow above the review line on the GitHub UI. In addition, not refreshing\nthe page might lead to these commits just not displaying, so the reviewer\nshould refresh the page both before and after clicking \"Merge when ready,\"\nand confirm that the commits are as expected.\n\n## Release Schedule\n\nOnce your change ends up in master, it will be released with the rest of the\nchanges by other contributors on the regular release schedules.\n\nOn [betanet](https://docs.near.org/docs/concepts/networks#betanet) we run\nnightly build from master with all the nightly protocol features enabled. Every\nfive weeks, we stabilize some protocol features and make a release candidate for\ntestnet.  The process for feature stabilization can be found in [this\ndocument](docs/practices/protocol_upgrade.md).  After the release candidate has been\nrunning on testnet for four weeks and no issues are observed, we stabilize and\npublish the release for mainnet.\n"

          "content": "# Security Policy\n\nReference client for NEAR is held to the highest security standard.\nThis document defines the policy on how to report vulnerabilities and receive updates when security patches are released.\n\nIf you have any suggestions or comments about the security policy, please email the [NEAR Security Team](mailto:security@near.org) at security@near.org\n\n## Reporting a vulnerability\n\nAll security issues should be submitted on [hackenproof](https://hackenproof.com/near/near-protocol). The team will review the submissions and decide whether they are eligible for bounty payouts. For more details, please check out the program description on the hackenproof website.\n\n## Handling & disclosure process\n\n1. Security report is received and assigned to an owner. This person will coordinate the process of evaluating, fixing, releasing and disclosing the issue.\n2. After initial report is received, the evaluation process is performed. It's identified if the issue exists, its severity and which version / components of the code is affected. Additional review to identify similar issues also happens. \n3. Fixes are implemented for all supported releases. These fixes are not publicly communicated but held in a private repo of the Security Team or locally.\n4. A suggested announcement date for this vulnerability is chosen. The notification is drafted and includes patches to all supported versions and affected components.\n5. On the announcement date, the [NEAR Security Update newsletter](https://groups.google.com/a/near.org/g/security-updates) is sent an announcement. The changes are fast tracked and merged into the public repository. At least 6 hours after the mailing list is notified, a copy of the advisory will be published across social channels. \n\nThis process may take time, especially when coordinating with network participants and maintainers of other components in the ecosystem.\nThe goal will be to address issues in as short of a period as possible, but it's important that the process described above to ensure that disclosures are handled in a consistent manner.  \n\n*Note:* If the Security Team identifies that an issue is mission-critical and requires a subset of network participants to update prior to newsletter announcement - this will be done in a manual way by communicating via direct channels. \n\n## Reward\n\nThe discovery of the security vulnerabilities that include but are not limited to the following categories will be rewarded proportionally to their severity:\n* Algorithmic, implementation, and economic issues that violate safety of the blockchain;\n* Algorithmic, implementation, and economic issues that stall the blockchain or significantly throttle liveness;\n* Algorithmic, implementation, and economic issues in the standard contracts developed by NEAR;\n* Issues that expose the private data of the users, the developers, or the validators;\n\nThe following are the necessary conditions for the reward:\n* The vulnerability is disclosed to NEAR before it is disclosed publicly and NEAR is given sufficient time to fix it;\n* The vulnerability is not disclosed to anyone else except the finder and NEAR before it is fixed;\n* The vulnerability is not exploited until it is fixed.\n\n### Rewards platform\n\nWe are using https://gitcoin.co/ to reward tokens. Meaning that every security vulnerability that you submit to us will be processed like a general work-item by an external contributor. To receive the reward, you would need to register on https://gitcoin.co/ and be able to receive the reward through it. Example of a reward for a security vulnerability finding: https://gitcoin.co/issue/near/community/5/4359\n\n\n## Receive Security Updates\n\nIf you want to be informed about security vulnerabilities, please subscribe to the [NEAR Security Update newsletter](https://groups.google.com/a/near.org/g/security-updates).\nThe newsletter is very low traffic and only sent out where public disclosure of a vulnerability happens.\n"
