**New configuration method with `wrangler login` - [jspspike], [pull/1471]**\n\n    `wrangler login` allows you to authenticate Wrangler to use your Cloudflare user credentials without hunting down an API token in the Cloudflare dashboard. It's straightforward! Just run `wrangler login`, enter your credentials, and you're off to the races.\n\n    [jspspike]: https://github.com/jspspike\n    [pull/1471]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/1471\n\n  - **`wrangler dev` now runs on the same machines as your production code - [EverlastingBugstopper] [avidal] [jwheels], [pull/1085]**\n\n    When running `wrangler dev` as an authenticated user, your requests will now run on the same servers that Cloudflare Workers run on in production. This means that what you see is what you get. `wrangler dev` should behave exactly like production, though we still recommend deploying to a staging website before going to production in order to ensure your changes are safe. This change means you get access to things like `request.cf`, the Cache API, and any Cloudflare settings you've applied in the dashboard while developing your Workers.\n\n    [everlastingbugstopper]: https://github.com/EverlastingBugstopper\n    [avidal]: https://github.com/avidal\n    [jwheels]: https://github.com/jwheels\n    [pull/1085]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/1085\n\n  - **`wrangler dev` now supports redirects` - [jspspike], [issue/1508] [pull/1512]**\n\n    When an HTTP response status code is between 300 and 399, the server lets the client know that the data they're looking for isn't here anymore, and the client should issue another separate request to the endpoint denoted in the `Location` header of the response. Before, if you were developing with `wrangler dev` on `example.com`, and your Worker issued a redirect from `https://example.com/oldurl` to `https://example.com/newurl`, that's what would be in the `Location` header. This meant that whatever client you were using would then issue their second request to the public Internet rather than the `wrangler dev` server running on your local machine. With this release, the `Location` header would now be rewritten to `http://127.0.0.1:8787/newurl`, preventing your client from redirecting you away from the Worker you're trying to develop.\n\n    [jspspike]: https://github.com/jspspike\n    [pull/1512]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/1512\n    [issue/1508]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/issues/1508\n\n  - **Add `--config` flag to all commmands to override the default `wrangler.toml` configuration file path - [luanraithz], [issue/1064] [pull/1350]**\n\n    All commands that read from a configuration file can now use a different configuration file path if the `--config` flag is specified. The commands affected are: `kv:namespace`, `kv:key`, `kv:bulk`, `route`, `secret`, `build`, `preview`, `dev`, `publish`, `subdomain`, and `tail`.\n\n    [luanraithz]: https://github.com/luanraithz\n    [pull/1350]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/1350\n    [issue/1064]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/issues/1064\n\n  - **`wrangler dev` configuration options for HTTP protocol - [jspspike], [issue/1204] [pull/1485]**\n\n    `wrangler dev` now takes two additional configuration flags: `--upstream-protocol` and `--local-protocol`. Both of these take a value of either `http` or `https`. `--upstream-protocol` determines what protocol the request going to your preview worker is (previously this was only controlled with the `--host` flag) - this flag defaults to `https`. `--local-protocol` determines what protocol `wrangler dev` listens for and defaults to `http`. If `https` is chosen, a self-signed certificate will be auto-generated for the dev server.\n\n    [jspspike]: https://github.com/jspspike\n    [pull/1485]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/1485\n    [issue/1204]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/issues/1204\n\n  - **`wrangler dev` can be configured in `wrangler.toml` - [jspspike], [issue/1282] [pull/1477]**\n\n    Any flag taken by `wrangler dev` (except `--host`) can now be configured in the `[dev]` section of your `wrangler.toml`.

When running `wrangler dev`, if you're using Workers KV, you'll need to specify a specific KV Namespace to use when previewing the Worker.\n\n    Specifically, this change:\n\n    - Adds a `preview_id` field to items in `kv_namespaces` in `wrangler.toml` that _must_ be provided in order to preview a worker that has kv namespaces.\n    - also adds `--preview` to kv commands in order to interact with them instead of production namespaces.\n\n    If you define a KV Namespace in your `wrangler.toml` but don't specify a `preview_id`, and then try to run `wrangler dev`, you'll see the following:\n\n    ```console\n    $ wrangler preview\n    💁  JavaScript project found.

It does this so that your Worker does not serve stale files from Cloudflare's edge cache to end users. Unfortunately, generating these hashes took a really really long time since we were using a cryptographically strong hash. Since we're just using this hash for cache invalidation, we decided it's not necessary to use such a complicated algorithm. We switched to using [xxhash](https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash) and have seen noticeable speed improvements.\n\n    [everlastingbugstopper]: https://github.com/EverlastingBugstopper\n    [pull/1221]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/1221\n\n  - **Add --url to wrangler preview - [larkin-nz], [issue/351] [pull/1001]**\n\n    `wrangler preview` now has the ability to open any URL!

Actions allow you to specify a step that \"uses\" a template, and one of the most used templates is the template that checks out relevant code. GitHub just released v2 of that template, and our CI now uses it!\n\n    [imbsky]: https://github.com/imbsky\n    [pull/1170]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/1170\n\n## 🍟 1.8.3\n\n- ### Features\n\n  - **Improvements to the Workers Sites asset manifest - [EverlastingBugstopper], [issue/897] [pull/1145]**\n\n    Workers Sites uses the concept of an asset manifest to invalidate Cloudflare's cache when new files are published. Every time you publish your Workers Site, Wrangler will re-create a mapping of file names with a hash to the contents of the file. This release includes a few steps that improve this experience:\n\n    - Manifest sizes are smaller by a magnitude of ~6.4. This should help some folks who were previously running into size issues when uploading a Workers Site.\n\n    - Any time an asset manifest is created, you will see the files that are being hashed in real time with a fancy loading spinner - no more waiting without any information!\n\n    - Asset manifest creation is now faster due to a refactor.\n\n    [everlastingbugstopper]: https://github.com/EverlastingBugstopper\n    [pull/1145]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/1145\n    [issue/897]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/issues/897\n\n  - **Clarify mutual exclusivity of zoneless v. zoned deploys - [EverlastingBugstopper], [issue/1152] [pull/1154]**\n\n    When publishing a Worker, you must specify either `workers_dev = true` or both a `zone_id` and `route/routes`. Previously, if your `wrangler.toml` violated this requirement, it would error with the following message:\n\n    ```console\n    $ wrangler publish\n    Error: you must set workers_dev = true OR provide a zone_id and route/routes.\n    ```\n\n    It's technically correct, but we can make it even more clear what the issue is. The new error message looks like:\n\n    ```console\n    $ wrangler publish\n    Error: you must set EITHER workers_dev = true OR provide a zone_id and route/routes.\n    ```\n\n    [everlastingbugstopper]: https://github.com/EverlastingBugstopper\n    [pull/1154]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/1154\n    [issue/1152]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/issues/1152\n\n- ### Fixes\n\n  - **Fixes `wrangler config` information message - [EverlastingBugstopper], [pull/1164]**\n\n    In Wrangler 1.8.2, we updated the formatting of some of Wrangler's informational messages. Unfortunately when this was introduced, it came with a bug in `wrangler config` that made the message read out in the wrong order. This is fixed in this release!\n\n    [everlastingbugstopper]: https://github.com/EverlastingBugstopper\n    [pull/1164]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/1164\n\n- ### Maintenance\n\n  - **Remove unused badges from README - [EverlastingBugstopper], [pull/1166]**\n\n    We no longer use Azure Pipelines as our CI provider, nor do we run non-test builds in CI so we removed those badges from the README.\n\n    [everlastingbugstopper]: https://github.com/EverlastingBugstopper\n    [pull/1166]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/1166\n\n## 🐈 1.8.2\n\n- ### Features\n\n  - **Configurable binary host URL - [noherczeg], [pull/1018]**\n\n    Previously, binaries installed by Wrangler were all assumed to come from npm. If you work in a controlled environment and can only install binaries from a specific endpoint (instead of npm), you can now specify that endpoint using the WRANGLER_BINARY_HOST environment variable.\n\n    [pull/1018]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/1018\n    [noherczeg]: https://github.com/noherczeg\n\n- ### Fixes\n\n  - **Eliminate downtime when redeploying Workers Sites - [ashleymichal], [issue/783], [pull/1115]**\n\n    When Workers Sites were first introduced, redeploying a site could lead to a few seconds of downtime if the Worker upload fails. Specifically, if a new Workers Sites upload failed, it was possible that the old, now-unused files in Workers KV would be deleted anyways, meaning that the preexisting Workers Site would suddenly have missing resources. This fix waits to delete now-unused files until after a new Workers Sites script is published.\n\n    [issue/783]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/issues/783\n    [pull/1115]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/1115\n    [ashleymichal]: https://github.com/ashleymichal\n\n- ### Maintenance\n\n  - **Add npm badge to README - [tomByrer], [pull/1121]**\n\n    Add badge to README that points to npm page for Wrangler.\n\n    [pull/1115]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/1121\n    [tombyrer]: https://github.com/tomByrer\n\n  - **Unify attention-grabbing messages - [EverlastingBugstopper], [pull/1128]**\n\n    Use more actionable, easy-to-read information printouts throughout Wrangler.\n\n    [pull/1115]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/1128\n    [tombyrer]: https://github.com/EverlastingBugstopper\n\n## 😈 1.8.1\n\n- ### Features\n\n  - **Error messaging for internet required to talk to Cloudflare API - [EverlastingBugstopper], [issue/1093] [pull/1114]**\n\n    With the release of `wrangler dev` in 1.8.0, it was not clear to users that internet is required since the feature communicates with Cloudflare's API. With this error message, users without internet connection are shown actionable next steps - check internet connection and lastly check if Cloudflare's API is down.\n\n    [issue/1093]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/issues/1093\n    [pull/1114]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/1114\n    [everlastingbugstopper]: https://github.com/EverlastingBugstopper\n\n- ### Fixes\n\n  - **Fix live reload for `wrangler dev` - [EverlastingBugstopper], [issue/1082] [pull/1117]**\n\n    `wrangler dev` re-builds and re-uploads your script to the Cloudflare API when it detects a file change. The Cloudflare API returns a new token which allows `wrangler dev` to route subsequent requests to the new script. Previously, `wrangler dev` would re-build, re-upload, and receive the new token, but it wouldn't use it for a couple of minutes due to some faulty threading logic. (darn mutexes!) After this change, `wrangler dev` will block incoming requests when it is switching the token, thus fixing the issue.\n\n    [issue/1082]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/issues/1082\n    [pull/1117]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/1117\n    [everlastingbugstopper]: https://github.com/EverlastingBugstopper\n\n  - **Remove unneeded carriage return in `wrangler secret put` - [gabbifish], [issue/1109] [pull/1112]**\n\n    Previously, interactive input from `wrangler secret put` added a carriage return to the secret key/value pairs on Windows. This no longer happens and input is parsed properly before uploading.\n\n    [issue/1109]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/issues/1109\n    [pull/1112]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/1112\n    [gabbifish]: https://github.com/gabbifish\n\n## 🙊 1.8.0\n\n- ### Features\n\n  - **`wrangler dev` - [EverlastingBugstopper], [issue/845] [pull/883]**\n\n    `wrangler dev` is a local proxy server to Cloudflare's preview service, allowing you to automatically re-build and preview your application on `localhost`. This feature is in alpha and we're looking for feedback and bug reports: check out [this issue](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/issues/1047)!\n\n    `wrangler dev` works very similarly to `wrangler preview`, but instead of opening your browser to preview your Worker, it will start a server on `localhost` that will execute your Worker on incoming HTTP requests:\n\n    ```\n    $ wrangler dev\n    ```\n\n    You should be able to send HTTP requests to `localhost:8787`, along with any headers or other request data, and your Worker should execute as expected. Additionally, you'll see `console.log` messages and exceptions appearing in your terminal (!!!).\n\n    For more information on `wrangler dev`'s options, such as passing a custom `host`, `ip`, or `port`, run `wrangler dev` in your terminal for the available flags and options.\n\n    [issue/845]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/issues/845\n    [pull/883]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/883\n\n  - **Multi-route support - [ashleymichal], [issue/866] [pull/916]**\n\n    Wrangler now allows developers to publish their Workers projects to multiple routes on a Cloudflare zone.\n\n    To deploy your Workers project to multiple routes, you can migrate from the `route` key to `routes`:\n\n    ```toml\n    name = \"worker\"\n    type = \"javascript\"\n    account_id = \"youraccountid\"\n    # change this line\n    # route = \"example.com/foo/*\"\n    # to this line\n    routes = [\"example.com/foo/*\", \"example.com/bar/*\"]\n    zone_id = \"yourzoneid\"\n    ```\n\n    [issue/866]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/issues/866\n    [pull/916]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/916\n\n  - **`wrangler secret` commands - [ashleymichal], [bradyjoslin], [issue/907] [issue/909] [issue/912] [pull/1045]**\n\n    Wrangler now allows developers to use **secrets** in their Workers codebase. Secrets are secure values that can be accessed as constants, similar to text variables, inside of your Workers code.\n\n    To set a secret, you can use `wrangler secret put MY_SECRET_NAME`. The interactive prompt will ask for the secret text you'd like to add to your project:\n\n    ```bash\n    $ wrangler secret put MY_SECRET_NAME\n    Enter the secret text you'd like assigned to the variable MY_SECRET_NAME on the script named my-project\n    ```\n\n    Importantly, secrets are constrained to an environment, and do not carry over between different deployed Workers (e.g. `my-worker` and `my-worker-production`). This allows you to use different API keys, URLs, and other common \"environment variable\"-style values in your different environments. Specifying an environment can be done using the `--env` (or `-e`, for short):\n\n    ```bash\n    $ wrangler secret put MY_SECRET_NAME --env production\n    Enter the secret text you'd like assigned to the variable MY_SECRET_NAME on the script named my-project-production\n    ```\n\n    The `wrangler secret` subcommand also allows developers to `list` and `delete` secrets for your Workers projects:\n\n    ```bash\n    $ wrangler secret delete MY_SECRET_NAME\n    Are you sure you want to permanently delete the variable MY_SECRET_NAME on the script named my-project [y/n] y\n    🌀  Deleting the secret MY_SECRET_NAME on script my-project.\n    ✨  You've deleted the secret MY_SECRET_NAME.\n\n    $ wrangler secret list\n    [{\"name\":\"API_KEY\",\"type\":\"secret_text\"},{\"name\":\"MY_OTHER_SECRET\",\"type\":\"secret_text\"}]\n    ```\n\n    [issue/907]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/issues/907\n    [issue/909]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/issues/909\n    [issue/912]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/issues/912\n    [pull/1045]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/1045\n    [issue/1100]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/issues/1100\n    [pull/1101]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/1101\n\n  - **Plain text binding support - [EverlastingBugstopper] - [issue/993] [pull/1014]**\n\n    In addition to secrets, Wrangler now also supports setting \"plain text\" bindings – values that will be available as constants in your Workers code, but aren't encrypted.

In this case, if a user adds a kv-namespaces entry to the bottom of a toml with [site] configuration already declared, it is parsed as a part of the [site] table, rather than as a top-level key. The error output from this is not super helpful, as it just says \"unknown field `kv-namespaces`\" which isn't precisely correct.\n\n    This PR detects when this error occurs and provides a help suggestion to put kv-namespaces ABOVE the [site] table entry to fix the problem.\n\n    [gabbifish]: https://github.com/gabbifish\n    [pull/937]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/937\n    [issue/798]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/issues/798\n\n- ### Fixes\n\n  - **Don't install `wasm-pack` for `webpack` type projects - [EverlastingBugstopper], [issue/745] [pull/849]**\n\n    You may have noticed that Wrangler installs `wasm-pack` for your `webpack` projects, which may seem strange since it's the tool we use to build Rust projects. The reason for this is because you can _also_ build Rust using `wasm-pack` and `webpack` in tandem if you use the [`wasm-pack-plugin`](https://github.com/wasm-tool/wasm-pack-plugin). This plugin recently added support for handling the installation of `wasm-pack` which means Wrangler no longer needs to handle those installs.\n\n    [everlastingbugstopper]: https://github.com/EverlastingBugstopper\n    [pull/849]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/849\n    [issue/745]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/issues/745\n\n- ### Maintenance\n\n  - **Make Azure use latest `rustc` - [EverlastingBugstopper], [issue/887] [pull/893]**\n\n    Updates our CI to update the rust toolchain to the latest stable version after installation.\n\n    [everlastingbugstopper]: https://github.com/EverlastingBugstopper\n    [pull/893]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/893\n    [issue/887]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/issues/887\n\n  - **Fix nightly builds - [EverlastingBugstopper], [pull/895], [pull/898]**\n\n    Now we confirm Wrangler builds against nightly Rust releases!\n\n    [everlastingbugstopper]: https://github.com/EverlastingBugstopper\n    [pull/895]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/895\n    [pull/898]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/898\n\n  - **Fix compiler warnings on windows - [uma0317], [issue/800] [pull/919]**\n\n    We build Wrangler for Mac OSX, Linux, and Windows, and each of these environments has slightly different needs at compile time.

It was a breaking change for users who were still using our first pass at configuration for this in their toml, so we added a friendly error message telling them how to update their `wrangler.toml`. At this point, all of our users have safely transitioned onto the new syntax, and so we removed the warning; any lingering use of the old syntax will be met with a parse error instead.\n\n    [ashleymichal]: https://github.com/ashleymichal\n    [pull/929]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/929\n\n  - **Use binary-install for npm - [EverlastingBugstopper], [pull/862]**\n\n    This extracts a lot of the logic in Wrangler's installer to an external package, [binary-install], which we will also use for installing wasm-pack on webpack project builds.

This is related to the introduction of [environments](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/blob/master/docs/content/environments.md) made in [1.3.1](#-131) and is intended to reduce confusion surrounding deploy targets. Previously, `wrangler publish --release` would deploy to a route on your own domain, and `wrangler publish` would deploy to your workers.dev subdomain. This was a confusing API, and we now require individual environments to have either `workers_dev = true` **or** both a `route` and `zone_id` in each section of `wrangler.toml`. This makes it very clear where your Workers code is being deployed. If you're not using `wrangler publish --release` but you added `workers_dev = false` to the top level of your `wrangler.toml` because Wrangler warned you to - you can now safely remove it! If you **are** using `wrangler publish --release`, know that it is functionally the same as `wrangler publish`. If you want to deploy to workers.dev and also a route on your own domain, you will need to set up multiple environments.\n\n    [issue/538]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/issues/538\n    [pull/751]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/751\n\n  - **Deprecate `private` field in `wrangler.toml` - [stevenfranks], [issue/782] [pull/782]**\n\n    In a related note, the `private` field no longer functions in `wrangler.toml`. The original intent behind this field was to allow \"publishing\" without \"activating\". Unfortunately this led to a lot of undefined behavior if the value was switched from `true` to `false` in between a `wrangler publish` command and a `wrangler publish --release` command and vice versa. With the removal of `wrangler publish --release`, we are also removing the `private` field. If your `wrangler.toml` files contain a value for private, you can remove it!\n\n    [stevenfranks]: https://github.com/stevenfranks\n    [pull/782]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/782\n    [issue/782]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/issues/782\n\n  - **Include/exclude static assets in a Workers Sites project - [gabbifish], [issue/716] [pull/760]**\n\n    Your `wrangler.toml` has two new optional fields: `include` and `exclude`.

This behavior mirrors Cargo's [include/exclude](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-exclude-and-include-fields-optional) functionality.

As a codebase expands, it goes through some growing pains. This release includes some improvements to the internal organization of Wrangler's codebase, and is intended to make our lives and our contributors' lives easier moving forward.\n\n    - Moved all \"fixture\" helper functions to \"utils\" module to share between build/preview tests\n\n    - Removed \"metadata_wasm.json\" from `simple_rust` fixture\n\n    - Extracted all module declarations in `main.rs` to `lib.rs` to allow tests to import with `use wrangler::foo`\n\n    - Split `target/mod.rs` into one file per struct\n\n    - Cleaned up KV Namespace mod system\n\n    - Use `log::info!` instead of `info!` in `main.rs`\n\n    [pull/787]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/787\n\n  - **Refactor GlobalUser to be passed as a reference consistently - [gabbifish], [pull/749]**\n\n    [pull/749]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/749\n\n  - **Remove internal link from CONTRIBUTING.md - [adaptive], [pull/784]**\n\n    [adaptive]: https://github.com/adaptive\n    [pull/784]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/784\n\n  - **Fix some [Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) warnings - [EverlastingBugstopper], [pull/793]**\n\n    [pull/793]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/793\n\n  - **Clean up leftover directories created by tests - [ashleymichal], [pull/785]**\n\n    [pull/785]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/785\n\n  - **Refactor subdomain module - [EverlastingBugstopper], [issue/758] [pull/764]**\n\n    [issue/758]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/issues/758\n    [pull/764]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/764\n\n  - **Fix README markdown misrender - [dottorblaster], [pull/763]**\n\n    [dottorblaster]: https://github.com/dottorblaster\n    [pull/763]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/763\n\n  - **Remove duplicate Environments subheader from README - [bradyjoslin], [pull/766]**\n\n    [bradyjoslin]: https://github.com/bradyjoslin\n    [pull/766]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/766\n\n  - **Change Crate author to the Workers Developer Experience team - [ashleygwilliams], [pull/752]**\n\n    [pull/752]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/752\n\n## 🎂 1.4.0\n\n- ### Features\n\n  - **Workers Sites - [pull/509]**\n\n    Wrangler 1.4.0 includes supports for **Workers Sites**, enabling developers to deploy static applications directly to Workers. Workers Sites is perfect for frontend frameworks like [React](https://reactjs.org) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), as well as static site generators like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Gatsby](https://gohugo.io/).\n\n    Workers Sites is a feature exclusive to Wrangler, and combines a great developer experience with excellent performance. The `--site` flag has been added to `wrangler init` and `wrangler generate` to use Workers Sites with new and existing projects:\n\n    ```sh\n    # Add Workers Sites to an existing project\n    $ wrangler init --site\n\n    # Start a new Workers Sites project\n    $ wrangler generate --site\n    ```\n\n    If you're ready to get started using Workers Sites, we've written guides for the various routes you might take with your project:\n\n    - [Create a new project from scratch](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/sites/start-from-scratch)\n    - [Deploy a pre-existing static site project](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/sites/start-from-existing)\n    - [Add static assets to a pre-existing Workers project](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/sites/start-from-worker)\n\n    For more details on how Workers Sites works with Wrangler, check out [the documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/sites/reference). We also have a brand new [tutorial](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/tutorials/deploy-a-react-app) to help you learn the Workers Sites workflow, by deploying a React application!\n\n    Workers Sites has been a heroic effort by the entire Workers Developer Experience team, comprising of Wrangler updates, new [project templates](https://github.com/cloudflare/worker-sites-template), and [open-source packages](https://github.com/cloudflare/kv-asset-handler). We're super excited about the future that Workers Sites represents, where static sites and serverless functions can work together to build powerful, cutting-edge applications.\n\n    Make sure to try out Workers Sites to build your next app! 🎉🎉🎉\n\n    [pull/509]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/509\n\n  - **Download release from our proxy rather than GitHub - [zackbloom], [pull/692]**\n\n    [zackbloom]: https://github.com/zackbloom\n    [pull/692]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/692\n\n  - **Add validation for workers names in wrangler init and wrangler generate - [gabbifish], [issue/470][pull/686]**\n\n    There are a number of requirements around _what_ your Workers script is named – previously, Wrangler would opaquely fail and not indicate that your script name was invalid: this PR updates the `init` and `generate` commands to validate the potential name before continuing to create a new project.\n\n    [gabbifish]: https://github.com/gabbifish\n    [issue/470]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/issues/470\n    [pull/686]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/686\n\n  - **Ensure KV subcommands check for presence of required fields in wrangler.toml - [gabbifish], [issue/607] [pull/665]**\n\n    There's a number of commands in `wrangler` that require a properly configured `wrangler.toml` file: instead of failing, this PR ensures that these commands now check your configuration file before attempting any action.

We use a library called [`binary-install`](https://github.com/rustwasm/binary-install) to fetch and cache binaries we download. However, to avoid downloading unnecessarily, we first check if the user has a copy locally on their machine that they had `cargo install`'d. We had a bug where in this logic branch, we _didn't_ check that the local version was the most up-to-date version. This meant that users who had an older installed version may run into errors when wrangler expected to use features of a newer version of that tool. This PR adds the logic to check for the version and will install and cache a newer version for wrangler to use (leaving your local version as is!).\n\n  [everlastingbugstopper]: https://github.com/EverlastingBugstopper\n  [issue/666]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrnagler/issues/666\n  [pull/726]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/726\n\n  - **Remove link to 000000000000000000.cloudflareworkers.com - [EverlastingBugstopper], [pull]**\n\n    Have you ever run `wrangler preview` in your project and wondered why the URL to preview your application is `000000000000000000.cloudflareworkers.com`?

For instance, an application can be deployed to a production URL _and_ a staging URL, without having to juggle multiple configuration files.\n\n    To use environments, you can now pass in `[env.$env_name]` properties in your `wrangler.toml`. Here's an example:\n\n    ```toml\n    type = \"webpack\"\n    name = \"my-worker-dev\"\n    account_id = \"12345678901234567890\"\n    zone_id = \"09876543210987654321\"\n    workers_dev = false\n\n    [env.staging]\n    name = \"my-worker-staging\"\n    route = \"staging.example.com/*\"\n\n    [env.production]\n    name = \"my-worker\"\n    route = \"example.com/*\"\n    ```\n\n    With multiple environments defined, `wrangler build`, `wrangler preview`, and `wrangler publish` now accept a `--env` flag to indicate what environment you'd like to use, for instance, `wrangler publish --env production`.\n\n    To support developers transitioning to environments, we've written documentation for the feature, including further information about deprecations and advanced usage. [Check out the documentation here!](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/blob/master/docs/content/environments.md)\n\n    [everlastingbugstopper]: https://github.com/EverlastingBugstopper\n    [issue/385]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/issues/385\n    [pull/386]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/386\n\n  - **KV commands - [ashleymichal], [gabbifish], [issue/339][pull/405]**\n\n    Wrangler 1.3.1 includes commands for managing and updating [Workers KV](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/workers-kv/) namespaces, keys, and values directly from the CLI.\n\n    - `wrangler kv:namespace`\n\n      `wrangler kv:namespace` allows developers to `create`, `list`, and `delete` KV namespaces, from the CLI. This allows Wrangler users to configure new namespaces without having to navigate into the Cloudflare Web UI to manage namespaces. Once a namespace has been created, Wrangler will even give you the exact configuration to copy into your `wrangler.toml` to begin using your new namespace in your project. Neat!\n\n      ```console\n      $ wrangler kv:namespace create \"MY_KV\"\n      🌀  Creating namespace with title \"worker-MY_KV\"\n      ✨  Success: WorkersKvNamespace {\n        id: \"e29b263ab50e42ce9b637fa8370175e8\",\n        title: \"worker-MY_KV\",\n      }\n      ✨  Add the following to your wrangler.toml:\n      kv-namespaces = [\n        { binding = \"MY_KV\", id = \"e29b263ab50e42ce9b637fa8370175e8\" }\n      ]\n      ```\n\n    - `wrangler kv:key`\n\n      `wrangler kv:key` gives CLI users access to reading, listing, and updating KV keys inside of a namespace. For instance, given a namespace with the binding `KV`, you can directly set keys and values from the CLI, including passing expiration data, such as below:\n\n      ```console\n      $ wrangler kv:key put --binding=KV \"key\" \"value\" --ttl=10000\n      ✨  Success\n      ```\n\n    - `wrangler kv:bulk`\n\n      `wrangler kv:bulk` can be used to quickly upload or remove a large number of values from Workers KV, by accepting a JSON file containing KV data. Let's define a JSON file, `data.json`:\n\n      ```json\n      [\n        {\n          \"key\": \"test_key\",\n          \"value\": \"test_value\",\n          \"expiration_ttl\": 3600\n        },\n        {\n          \"key\": \"test_key2\",\n          \"value\": \"test_value2\",\n          \"expiration_ttl\": 3600\n        }\n      ]\n      ```\n\n      By calling `wrangler kv:bulk put --binding=KV data.json`, I can quickly create two new keys in Workers KV - `test_key` and `test_key2`, with the corresponding values `test_value` and `test_value2`:\n\n      ```console\n      $ wrangler kv:bulk put --binding=KV data.json\n      ✨  Success\n      ```\n\n    The KV subcommands in Wrangler 1.3.1 make it super easy to comfortably query and manage your Workers KV data without ever having to leave the command-line. For more information on the available commands and their usage, see [the documentation](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/blob/master/docs/content/kv_commands.md). 🤯\n\n    [ashleymichal]: https://github.com/ashleymichal\n    [gabbifish]: https://github.com/gabbifish\n    [issue/339]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/issues/339\n    [pull/405]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/405\n\n  - **Reduce output from publish command - [EverlastingBugstopper], [issue/523][pull/584]**\n\n    This PR improves the messaging of `wrangler publish`.\n\n    **Before:**\n\n    ```console\n    ✨  Built successfully, built project size is 517 bytes.\n    ✨  Successfully published your script.\n    ✨  Success!

As you develop your project, you can start up a link between your local codebase and the preview service by running `wrangler preview --watch`. Any updates to your project will be passed to the preview service, allowing you to instantly see any changes to your project. This is a _massive_ improvement to the development process for building applications with Workers, and we're super excited to ship it!\n\n    A huge shout-out to @xortive, who almost single-handedly built this feature during his summer internship at Cloudflare, over the last few months.

The new version of `wrangler config` will prompt you for your `email` and `api_key` via `stdin`.\n\n    In addition, this PR also adds support for a `WRANGLER_HOME` environment variable, which will be the location for Wrangler's \"home\" directory, if you need to customize where Wrangler saves its configuration information.\n\n    [xtuc]: https://github.com/xtuc\n    [pull/329]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/239\n\n* ### Features\n\n  - **Support KV Namespace Configuration - [ashleymichal], [pull/334], add check + error message for pre 1.1.0 kv namespace format - [xortive], [pull/369]**\n\n    Wrangler now supports using [Workers KV][kv] namespaces in your project! To start using KV with your projects, create a namespace in the Cloudflare Dashboard, and the namespace information to your `wrangler.toml` configuration file. The `kv-namespaces` key requires setting a `binding` (the representation of your namespace in your code) and `id`, the namespace ID:\n\n    ```toml\n    # wrangler.toml\n\n    [[kv-namespaces]]\n    binding = \"TODOS\"\n    id = \"0f2ac74b498b48028cb68387c421e279\"\n    ```\n\n    **If you were previously using the undocumented `kv-namespaces` support in your project config, you'll need to make a few changes to your project to use Wrangler 1.1.0!** KV namespaces now need to be created manually, in the Cloudflare Dashboard, to be able to use them in your Wrangler configuration - previous versions of Wrangler created the namespace for you, but the process is now manual, to allow developers to be more explicit about how their KV namespaces are created.\n\n    For users of the previously undocumented `kv-namespaces` functionality in Wrangler, we've provided a warning and upgrade path, to help you upgrade your KV configuration in your project to the correct format:\n\n    ```\n    ⚠️  As of 1.1.0 the kv-namespaces format has been stabilized ⚠️\n    💁‍  Please add a section like this in your `wrangler.toml` for each KV Namespace you wish to bind: 💁‍\n\n    [[kv-namespaces]]\n    binding = \"BINDING_NAME\"\n    id = \"0f2ac74b498b48028cb68387c421e279\"\n\n    # binding is the variable name you wish to bind the namespace to in your script.\n    # id is the namespace_id assigned to your kv namespace upon creation. e.g. (per namespace)\n\n    Error: ⚠️  Your project config has an error ⚠️\n    ```\n\n    [xortive]: https://github.com/xortive\n    [pull/369]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/369\n\n    This is the initial part of a lot of incredible work being done on supporting Workers KV in Wrangler.

The first major version of Wrangler makes the tool the preferred development and deployment tool for JavaScript and Rust projects to the Cloudflare Workers platform.\n\nThis release includes many changes to the developer experience for Wrangler, including:\n\n- Support for installing wrangler via npm: `npm install @cloudflare/wrangler -g`.\n- Support for various project types, including `javascript` and `webpack`.\n  - The default project type for Wrangler is now `webpack`.\n- Support for creating and binding [Workers KV](https://workers.cloudflare.com/docs/reference/storage/overview/) namespaces via your project's configuration file.\n- Enhancements to error messages and validation of your project before building and deploying.\n- Fixes for Windows usage of Wrangler.\n- Fixes for cross-platform console output.\n\n## 💥 0.1.1\n\n- ### 🤕 Fixes\n\n  - **Fix `publish` and `preview` bug for projects with a `-` - [jaysonsantos], [issue/36][pull/38]**\n\n    Rust is a sometimes surprisingly opinionated language! When your `Cargo.toml` specifies a project\n    name with a hyphen(`-`) in the name, the Rust compiler will implicitly understand this as a `_` for\n    all imports and when it creates compiled artifacts it will name them with a `_`.\n\n    The original implementation of `wrangler` skipped over this, and as a result would go looking for a\n    wasm file with a `-` when it should have been looking for a `_`. This resulted in a bit of a gross\n    error message that stated that a file was not found.\n\n    We've fixed this now- so go ahead and name your packages with `-`s!\n\n    [jaysonsantos]: https://github.com/jaysonsantos\n    [issue/36]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/issues/36\n    [pull/38]: https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/pull/38\n\n- ### 📖 Documentation\n\n  - **Install instructions with OpenSSL troubleshooting notes - [AustinCorridor], [issue/35][pull/43]**\n\n    Because of `wrangler`'s use of `cargo-generate` we use OpenSSL.

          "content": "# Contributing\n\nWrangler is an open source project because we believe that folks should have access, insight,\nand the opportunity to contribute to their developer tools. Wrangler is also a product\ndelivered by Cloudflare, so it's important to clarify how we think about issue triage and\ncontributions.\n\nIf you want to learn about how to get started developing Wrangler, [click here](#Developing-Wrangler)\n\n## People\n\nWrangler is owned by the [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com) Team and maintained by community members like you! The core maintainers are @EverlastingBugstopper and @ashleymichal, and everything that gets merged must be approved by at least one team member.\n\n## Developing Wrangler\n\n### Get started\n\nTo get started with developing Wrangler, we recommend that you first get [up to speed with Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/quickstart). Then, get up to speed with the [basics of Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started). (You'll need to install `rustup` where we're going).\n\n### Build Wrangler from source\n\nTo build Wrangler from source, fork the repo, clone it, and `cd wrangler`. To run the test suite, run `cargo test`. To quickly test a command, for example  `wrangler init`, run `cargo run -- init`. This will compile a \"debug\" binary, then run it, passing in all arguments after `--`.\n\nIt is important to note that many Wrangler commands depend on a `wrangler.toml` in the current working directory. It is advised to keep a test project somewhere with an active `wrangler.toml` to exercise your code.\n\n### Run Wrangler during development\n\nThere are many ways to build and execute a development version of Wrangler, in addition to using `cargo run`:\n\n`cargo build` will produce a local binary at `./target/debug/wrangler` that you can execute just by calling it by path.\n`cargo install --debug --path .` will replace any globally installed wrangler with the one you've just built from source.\n\nYou can read more about cargo [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/), just find something that works for you.\n\n### Module System\n\nEach of the commands supported by Wrangler have entrypoints in [./src/commands](./src/commands). It's useful to understand the [module system](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/mod.html) if you will be adding new commands or need to refactor/organize imports.\n\n### Notable external libraries\n\n#### Command-line argument parsing (clap)\n\nThe primary framework we use for developing Wrangler is called [clap](https://clap.rs), which provides fast and structured argument parsing. This is how different features are exposed to users, and most of that logic lives in [main.rs](./src/main.rs).\n\n#### API calls (cloudflare-rs)\n\nWhen developing a new feature for Wrangler, it's quite common to need to make API calls. The way we do this is by submitting a PR to [cloudflare-rs](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-rs) and releasing a new version of that library to depend on. There are some legacy endpoints that we use our own client for, but the goal is to eventually move everything to cloudflare-rs. All endpoint calls should be made with the clients in [./src/http](./src/http).\n\n### Figure out where to start\n\nIf you're working on a specific issue, make sure there is buy-in from the Wrangler team before starting, and feel free to ask where you should start. We're more than happy to help!\n\n### Requirements for merging a PR\n\n### Passing tests\n\nWhen adding features or fixing bugs, we'd love if you would add a test! There are two types of tests in Wrangler, integration and unit tests. To execute tests, you can run `cargo test`. You can read more about testing [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/testing.html). All tests must pass when submitting a new PR, this is enforced by our GitHub Actions runners, which run each test on Windows, MacOS, and Linux.\n\n### Proper formatting\n\nYou must run `cargo fmt` on your code before CI will allow you to merge your PR.\n\n## Primary Issue Triage\n\nWithin 3 days, any incoming issue should be triaged. Triage involves:\n\n- reading the issue and requesting any further information\n- always thank the user for submitting\n- assigning appropriate labels\n\n### Labelling\n\n- each issue should have a `status` label and a `category` label, and they should be kept up to date\n  - once design has been settled for an issue, please label with `status - PR welcome`\n- each issue from non-team members should be labelled `user report` (issue templates assign this automatically)\n- subject labels and other call to actions are nice to have\n- if an issue seems easy to tackle, please label with `good first issue` so new contributors can use it to ramp up\n\n### Assignment\n\n- if the issue will require a large amount of back and forth between the reporter and the team\n    assign a single team member to manage the conversation\n\n## Product Issue Triage\n\nOnce a week, the team holds the Wrangler Contributors meeting. This is where we assign work and update\nour plans for the milestones and releases.\n\n### Assignment and Milestones\n\n- assign all issues for the next two releases a milestone\n- assign all issues for the current milestone a person to take point\n\n## Pull Request Triage\n\nWithin 3 days, all incoming Community PRs should be triaged. If a team member opens a PR it\nshould be triaged immediately upon open by the PR author.\n\n### Labelling\n\n- All work-in-progress PRs should be labelled `work in progress` and the title should be\n    annotated [WIP] for easy scanning. No WIP PRs will be reviewed until the annotations\n    are removed.\n- All PRs that need to be reviewed should be labelled `needs review` until they have\n    received all required reviews.\n- All PRs should be labelled with a changelog label: `BREAKING`, `feature`, `fix`, `maintenance`, `docs`, `N/A`\n- All PRs that are ready for review should be tagged with the appropriate release milestone\n\n### Merging\n\n- All PRs should be merged with a Merge Commit. We recommend that folks rebase into a small\n    number of task driven commits. This is enforced more heavily for team members than\n    community members. Be reasonable.\n- All PRs should be labelled with the current milestone before merging. If a PR for an issue\n    labelled with a different milestone is to be merged, update the issue milestone as well.\n"

This repository is now archived.\n\nNew versions of Wrangler are maintained in the [Workers SDK repository](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk).\n\n---\n\n<details>\n<summary>Legacy Documentation</summary>\n\n![Banner](/banner.png)\n\n[![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/wrangler.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/wrangler) &nbsp;\n[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@cloudflare/wrangler.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cloudflare/wrangler) &nbsp;\n[![GitHub Actions - Test Status](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/actions) &nbsp;\n[![GitHub Actions - Linter Status](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/workflows/Linters/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/actions) &nbsp;\n\n`wrangler` is a CLI tool designed for folks who are interested in using [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/).\n\n![Wrangler Demo](/wrangler-demo.gif)\n\n## Installation\n\nYou have many options to install wrangler! \n\nFor the latest version, see https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk\n\n### Install with `npm`\n\nWe strongly recommend you install `npm` with a Node version manager like [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating), which puts the global `node_modules` in your home directory to eliminate permissions issues with `npm install -g`. Distribution-packaged `npm` installs often use `/usr/lib/node_modules` (which is root) for globally installed `npm` packages, and running `npm install -g` as `root` prevents `wrangler` from installing properly.\n\nOnce you've installed `nvm` and configured your system to use the `nvm` managed node install, run:\n\n```bash\nnpm i @cloudflare/wrangler -g\n```\n\nIf you are running an ARM based system (eg Raspberry Pi, Pinebook) you'll need to use the `cargo` installation method listed below to build wrangler from source.\n\n#### Specify binary location\n\nIn case you need `wrangler`'s npm installer to place the binary in a non-default location (such as when using `wrangler` in CI), you can use the following configuration options to specify an install location:\n\n- Environment variable: `WRANGLER_INSTALL_PATH`\n- NPM configuration: `wrangler_install_path`\n\n#### Specify binary site URL\n\nIn case you need to store/mirror binaries on premise you will need to specify where wrangler should search for them by providing any of the following:\n\n- Environment variable: `WRANGLER_BINARY_HOST`\n- NPM configuration: `wrangler_binary_host`\n\n### Install with `cargo`\n\n```bash\ncargo install wrangler\n```\n\nIf you don't have `cargo` or `npm` installed, you will need to follow these [additional instructions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cli-wrangler/install-update/#manual-install).\n\n### Install on Windows\n\n[perl is an external dependency of crate openssl-sys](https://github.com/sfackler/rust-openssl/blob/b027f1603189919d5f63c6aff483243aaa188568/openssl/src/lib.rs#L11-L15). If installing wrangler with cargo, you will need to have perl installed. We've tested with [Strawberry Perl](https://www.perl.org/get.html). If you instead install perl via scoop, you may need to also run `scoop install openssl` in order to get the necessary openssl dlls. Installing wrangler with `npm` instead of cargo is another option if you don't want to install perl.\n\n## Updating\n\nFor information regarding updating Wrangler, click [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cli-wrangler/install-update#update).\n\n## Getting Started\n\nOnce you have installed Wrangler, spinning up and deploying your first Worker is easy!\n\n```console\n$ wrangler generate my-worker\n$ cd my-worker\n# update your wrangler.toml with your Cloudflare Account ID\n$ wrangler config\n$ wrangler publish\n```\n\n## 🎙️ Top Level Commands\n\n### 👯 `generate`\n\nScaffold a project, including boilerplate code for a Rust library and a Cloudflare Worker.\n\n```bash\nwrangler generate <name> <template> --type=[\"webpack\", \"javascript\", \"rust\"]\n```\n\nAll of the arguments and flags to this command are optional:\n\n- `name`: defaults to `worker`\n- `template`: defaults to the [`https://github.com/cloudflare/worker-template`](https://github.com/cloudflare/worker-template)\n- `type`: defaults to `javascript` based on the [\"worker-template\"](https://github.com/cloudflare/worker-template/blob/master/wrangler.toml)\n\n### 📥 `init`\n\nCreates a skeleton `wrangler.toml` in an existing directory. This can be used as an alternative to `generate` if you prefer to clone a repository yourself.\n\n```bash\nwrangler init <name> --type=[\"webpack\", \"javascript\", \"rust\"]\n```\n\nAll of the arguments and flags to this command are optional:\n\n- `name`: defaults to the name of your working directory\n- `type`: defaults to [\"webpack\"](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/tooling/wrangler/webpack).\n\n### 🦀⚙️ `build`\n\nBuild your project. This command looks at your `wrangler.toml` file and runs the build steps associated\nwith the `\"type\"` declared there.\n\nAdditionally, you can configure different [environments](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/tooling/wrangler/configuration/environments).\n\n### 🔓 `login`\n\nAuthorize Wrangler with your Cloudflare login. This will prompt you with a Cloudflare account login page and a permissions consent page.\nThis command is the alternative to `wrangler config` and it uses OAuth tokens.\n\n```bash\nwrangler login --scopes-list --scopes <scopes>\n```\n\nAll of the arguments and flags to this command are optional:\n\n- `scopes-list`: list all the available OAuth scopes with descriptions.\n- `scopes`: allows to choose your set of OAuth scopes.\n\nRead more about this command in [Wrangler Login Documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cli-wrangler/commands#login).\n\n### 🔧 `config`\n\nAuthenticate Wrangler with a Cloudflare API Token. This is an interactive command that will prompt you for your API token:\n\n```bash\nwrangler config\nEnter API token:\nsuperlongapitoken\n```\n\nYou can also provide your email and global API key (this is not recommended for security reasons):\n\n```bash\nwrangler config --api-key\nEnter email:\ntestuser@example.com\nEnter global API key:\nsuperlongapikey\n```\n\nYou can also [use environment variables](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/tooling/wrangler/configuration/) to configure these values.\n\n### ☁️ 🆙 `publish`\n\nPublish your Worker to Cloudflare. Several keys in your `wrangler.toml` determine whether you are publishing to a workers.dev subdomain or your own registered domain, proxied through Cloudflare.\n\nAdditionally, you can configure different [environments](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/tooling/wrangler/configuration/environments).\n\nYou can also use environment variables to handle authentication when you publish a Worker.\n\n```bash\n# e.g.\nCF_API_TOKEN=superlongtoken wrangler publish\n# where\n# $CF_API_TOKEN -> your Cloudflare API token\n\nCF_API_KEY=superlongapikey CF_EMAIL=testuser@example.com wrangler publish\n# where\n# $CF_API_KEY -> your Cloudflare API key\n# $CF_EMAIL -> your Cloudflare account email\n```\n\n### 🗂 `kv`\n\nInteract with your Workers KV store. This is actually a whole suite of subcommands. Read more about in [Wrangler KV Documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cli-wrangler/commands#kv).\n\n### 👂 `dev`\n\n`wrangler dev` works very similarly to `wrangler preview` except that instead of opening your browser to preview your worker, it will start a server on localhost that will execute your worker on incoming HTTP requests. From there you can use cURL, Postman, your browser, or any other HTTP client to test the behavior of your worker before publishing it.\n\nYou should run wrangler dev from your worker directory, and if your worker makes any requests to a backend, you should specify the host with `--host example.com`.\n\nFrom here you should be able to send HTTP requests to `localhost:8787` along with any headers and paths, and your worker should execute as expected. Additionally, you should see console.log messages and exceptions appearing in your terminal.\n\n```bash\n👂 Listening on http://localhost:8787\n[2020-02-18 19:37:08] GET example.com/ HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n```\n\nAll of the arguments and flags to this command are optional:\n\n- `env`: environment to build\n- `host`: domain to test behind your worker. defaults to example.com\n- `ip`: ip to listen on. defaults to localhost\n- `port`: port to listen on. defaults to 8787\n\n## Additional Documentation\n\nAll information regarding wrangler or Cloudflare Workers is located in the [Cloudflare Workers Developer Docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/). This includes:\n\n- Using wrangler [commands](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/)\n- Wrangler [configuration](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration)\n- General documentation surrounding Workers development\n- All wrangler features such as Workers Sites and KV\n\n## ✨Workers Sites\n\nTo learn about deploying static assets using `wrangler`, see the [Workers Sites Quickstart](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/sites/).\n\n</details>"

          "content": "# Release Checklist\n\nThis is a list of the things that need to happen during a release.\n\n## Build a Release\n\n### Prepare the Changelog (Full release only)\n\n1. Open the associated milestone, if it exists. All issues and PRs should be closed. If\n   they are not you should reassign all open issues and PRs to future\n   milestones.\n1. Run the changelog generator in `./changelog-generator`.\n   1. Get the date after the most recent release,\n   1. run `cd ./changelog-generator && npm install && node index.js cloudflare wrangler YYYY-MM-DD`\n   1. the generated changelog is in `./changelog-generator/output.md`. Open it, and add the version at the top, and move the entries to their proper category.\n1. Choose an emoji for the release. Try to make it semi-related to something that's been included in the release (point releases can be a little weirder).\n1. Add the contents of `output.md` to the top of `CHANGELOG.md`, matching the structure of previous\n   entries. If it is a release candidate, no official changelog is needed, but testing instructions will be added later in the process.\n\n### Update cargo manifest\n\n1. Update the version in `Cargo.toml`.\n1. Run `cargo update`.\n1. Run `cargo test`.\n1. Run `cargo build`.\n\n### Update npm manifest and assets\n\n1. Copy `README.md` to `npm/README.md`\n1. Bump the version number in `npm/package.json`\n1. `cd npm && npm install` _Note: This step will appear to fail due to the new version not existing yet, however its utility is re-building npm-shrinkwrap.json_\n\n### Start a release PR\n\n1. Create a new branch \"#.#.#\" where \"#.#.#\" is this release's version (release) or \"#.#.#-rc.#\" (release candidate)\n1. Push up a commit with the `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, `npm/README.md`, `npm/package.json`, `npm/npm-shrinkwrap.json`,\n   and `CHANGELOG.md` changes. The commit message can just be \"#.#.#\" (release) or \"#.#.#-rc.#\" (release candidate)\n1. Request review from the @cloudflare/workers-devexp team.\n\n### Review\n\nMost of your comments will be about the changelog. Once the PR is finalized and approved...\n\n1. If you made changes, squash or fixup all changes into a single commit.\n1. Run `git push` and wait for CI to pass.\n## Merge\n\n1. Hit the big green Merge button on the release PR.\n1. `git checkout master` and `git pull --rebase origin master`\n\n### Tag and build release\n\nThis part of the release process is handled by GitHub Actions, and our binaries are distributed as GitHub Releases. When you push a version tag, it kicks off an action that creates a new GitHub release for that tag, builds release binaries and attaches them to the release.\n\n1. After pulling `master` in the step above, tag the commit by running either `git tag -a v#.#.# -m #.#.#` (release), or `git tag -a v#.#.#-rc.# -m #.#.#` (release candidate)\n1. Run `git push --tags`.\n1. Wait for CI to pass.\n1. If CI fails, delete the tag locally and remotely\n1. Fix whatever caused the CI failure\n1. Re-tag the healthy commit, and wait for CI to pass again.\n\n### Edit the release\n\nAfter CI builds the release binaries and they appear on the [releases page](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/releases), click `Edit` and update release notes.\n\n#### For Full Releases\n\n1. Paste the current release notes from `CHANGELOG.md` into the release body.\n1. Update the *title* of the release (not the tag itself) to include the emoji for the current release\n1. Be sure to add any missing link definitions to the release.\n\n#### For Release Candidates\n\n1. Mark the release as a `pre-release`. This is handled with a checkbox on the Edit page.\n1. If this is a new rc (rc.0), paste testing instructions into the release notes.\n1. If this is a rc.1 or later, the old release candidate testing instructions should be moved to the latest release candidate testing instructions, and replaced with the following message:\n\n   ```markdown\n   This beta release is now out of date. If you previously installed this release, you should reinstall with `npm i -g @cloudflare/wrangler@beta` and see what's changed in the latest [release](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-legacy/releases).\n   ```\n\n   The new release candidate should then include updated testing instructions with a small changelog at the top to get folks who installed the old release candidate up to speed.\n\n### Publish to crates.io (full release only)\n\n**IMPORTANT: This step is the hardest to fix if you mess it up. Do not run this step for Release Candidates**.\n\nWe don't publish release candidates to crates.io because they don't (as of this writing) have a concept of a \"beta\" version.\n\n1. Run `cargo test`\n1. (Release only) `cargo publish`\n\n### Publish to npm\n\nFull releases are tagged `latest`. Release candidates are tagged `beta`. If for some reason you mix up the commands below, follow the troubleshooting guide.\n\n1. If this is a full release, `cd npm && npm publish`. If it is a release candidate, `cd npm && npm publish --tag beta`\n1. Tweet.\n\n# Troubleshooting a release\n\nMistakes happen. Most of these release steps are recoverable if you mess up. The goal is not to, but if you find yourself cursing a fat fingered command, here are some troubleshooting tips. Please feel free to add to this guide.\n\n## I pushed the wrong tag\n\nTags and releases can be removed in GitHub. First, [remove the remote tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5480258/how-to-delete-a-remote-tag):\n\n``` console\n$ git push --delete origin tagname\n```\n\nThis will turn the release into a `draft` and you can delete it from the edit page.\n\nMake sure you also delete the local tag:\n\n``` console\n$ git tag --delete vX.X.X\n```\n\n## I forgot to add the `beta` tag to my RC when I ran `npm publish`\n\nNever fear! We can fix this by updating npm tags. First, add a beta tag for the version you just published:\n\n``` console\n$ npm dist-tag add @cloudflare/wrangler@x.x.x-rc.x beta\n```\n\nonce you add the beta tag, pause...\n\n...and then list your tags:\n\n``` console\n$ npm dist-tag ls @cloudflare/wrangler\n```\n\nYou should now see two tags pointing to the version you just pushed; for example if you had tried to push v1.9.0-rc.0:\n\n``` console\n$ npm dist-tag ls @cloudflare/wrangler\nbeta: 1.9.0-rc.0\nlatest: 1.9.0-rc.0\n```\n\nGo back to the Changelog or GitHub releases, find the _actual_ latest version, and re-tag it as latest:\n\n``` console\n$ npm dist-tag add @cloudflare/wrangler@x.x.x latest\n```\n\nList tags again and you should see the latest restored, and your new release candidate as beta (e.g. 1.9.0-rc.0 is beta and 1.8.4 was last stable version)\n\n``` console\n$ npm dist-tag ls @cloudflare/wrangler\nbeta: 1.9.0-rc.0\nlatest: 1.8.4\n```\n"
