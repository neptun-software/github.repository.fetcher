Now, when the `--log-file dua.log`\n   is specified, the panic will be emitted into the log file instead and thus won't\n   be lost anymore.\n   \n   This may help with debugging in future.\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n - <csr-id-49f98f537bf0ac41a7b1992094103f6d36f135f8/> `--ignore-dirs` now work as expected.\n   Previously they would need to be specified as relative to the traversal root, which\n   was unintuitive and would lead to ignores not working for many.\n   \n   Even though this was done for performance to avoid canonicalization, we do now\n   perform a more performance version of canonicalization so the overall performance\n   should be acceptable nonetheless.\n   \n   Also note that ignored directories are now logged when using a `--log-file`.\n - <csr-id-20e85c1ebe7ce3a5254fe2675a52cb5d321f1e34/> consistent language across the application and improved style of the Help pane.\n   Generally, what was called `entry` is now called `item`, consistently.\n\n### Other\n\n - <csr-id-729e7e92410b138f2778ef70f0f59a439028ac29/> clarify that (and why) `termion` isn't supported anymore in README.md\n   This was triggered by `crossterm` essentially breaking event handling\n   on Windows, which is when I decided to just use the seemingly more\n   powerful crossterm events natively.\n   \n   Overall, this made event handling more complex, but also allows users of\n   `crosstermion` (the crate that actually dropped `termion` support) to\n   write even more interactive applications without worrying about\n   the always out-of-date intermediate layer.\n   \n   Interestingly, the `crosstermion` crate adds some useful features around event handling,\n   but also optimizes build times thanks to `termion`, which is something that\n   on my current machine I don't notice anymore, so the value of it diminished greatly.\n\n### Commit Statistics\n\n<csr-read-only-do-not-edit/>\n\n - 14 commits contributed to the release over the course of 7 calendar days.\n - 7 days passed between releases.\n - 5 commits were understood as [conventional](https://www.conventionalcommits.org).\n - 2 unique issues were worked on: [#196](https://github.com/Byron/dua-cli/issues/196), [#208](https://github.com/Byron/dua-cli/issues/208)\n\n### Commit Details\n\n<csr-read-only-do-not-edit/>\n\n<details><summary>view details</summary>\n\n * **[#196](https://github.com/Byron/dua-cli/issues/196)**\n    - `--ignore-dirs` now work as expected.

The\npractical difference appears relatively minor.\n\nSince this should resolve #99, the aggregate-scan-progress feature is\nremoved.\n\nSpecial thanks to [@Freaky](https://github.com/Freaky) for the contribution!\n\n### BREAKING change for package maintainers\n\nThe `aggregate-scan-progress` feature was removed as it shouldn't be required anymore.\n\n### Commit Statistics\n\n<csr-read-only-do-not-edit/>\n\n - 9 commits contributed to the release over the course of 55 calendar days.\n - 57 days passed between releases.\n - 0 commits were understood as [conventional](https://www.conventionalcommits.org).\n - 0 issues like '(#ID)' were seen in commit messages\n\n### Commit Details\n\n<csr-read-only-do-not-edit/>\n\n<details><summary>view details</summary>\n\n * **Uncategorized**\n    - Release dua-cli v2.17.1 ([`48c4462`](https://github.com/Byron/dua-cli/commit/48c446294e8ac6b620a2b7fc7c15a4cf9f839452))\n    - Prepare changelog ([`fc1e10a`](https://github.com/Byron/dua-cli/commit/fc1e10a77da45d41c8243ddb07d7332ca8e23012))\n    - Improve aggregate progress reporting ([`7d83f96`](https://github.com/Byron/dua-cli/commit/7d83f965d620ccebeda9a7451cdbb2e40ed88c24))\n    - Update dependencies ([`9a1da6b`](https://github.com/Byron/dua-cli/commit/9a1da6bc4e964912a521b2f0de0bdf6124749ccd))\n    - Upgrade sysinfo ([`0b6b52f`](https://github.com/Byron/dua-cli/commit/0b6b52f02b72641a4954838fd9e2ea4fd0447e2d))\n    - Adjust to changes in clap ([`f9df024`](https://github.com/Byron/dua-cli/commit/f9df02420d7bd4e492c4a9130833fdf31e739909))\n    - Dependency update ([`0d9fbd3`](https://github.com/Byron/dua-cli/commit/0d9fbd386c51be1995aaee70d1a87a1217d9c550))\n    - Update clap to official release ([`b029dc5`](https://github.com/Byron/dua-cli/commit/b029dc5d190b23bf3e3fc95a3947f28f868e674e))\n    - Upgrade to TUI 0.17 ([`9ce96ac`](https://github.com/Byron/dua-cli/commit/9ce96ac7b89a1ee39cd85a7c18871309d5fe07af))\n</details>\n\n## 2.17.0 (2022-01-21)\n\n### New Features\n\n - <csr-id-e2686952b4daf4c35303689c36bebc3dfe3faf29/> interactive mode learns 'toggle [a]ll' and 'remove [a]ll'.\n   In the mark pane, the 'a' key will now toggle all entries.\n   This is particularly interesting for selecting entries to\n   exclude by hande and then invert the selection by toggling [a]ll.\n   \n   In the mark pane, toggling all with the 'a' key means removing\n   all entries and closing the pane.\n\n### Commit Statistics\n\n<csr-read-only-do-not-edit/>\n\n - 4 commits contributed to the release.\n - 12 days passed between releases.\n - 1 commit was understood as [conventional](https://www.conventionalcommits.org).\n - 0 issues like '(#ID)' were seen in commit messages\n\n### Commit Details\n\n<csr-read-only-do-not-edit/>\n\n<details><summary>view details</summary>\n\n * **Uncategorized**\n    - Release dua-cli v2.17.0 ([`4025174`](https://github.com/Byron/dua-cli/commit/4025174e081c7820f8808262e67b96741bd44781))\n    - Interactive mode learns 'toggle [a]ll' and 'remove [a]ll'.

Get help on keyboard\nshortcuts with `?`.\nUse this mode to explore, and/or to delete files and directories to release disk space.\n\nPlease note that great care has been taken to prevent accidential deletions due to a multi-stage\nprocess, which makes this mode viable for exploration.\n\n```bash\ndua i\ndua interactive\n```\n\n### Development\n\nPlease note that all the following assumes a unix system. On Windows, the linux subsystem should do the job.\n\n#### Run tests\n\n```bash\nmake tests\n```\n\n#### Learn about other targets\n\n```\nmake\n```\n\n#### But why is…\n\n#### …there only one available backend? `termion` was available previously.\n\nMaintaining both backends seemed more cumbersome than it's worth and add complexity I didn't like anymore. `termion` had its benefits,\nbut I never liked that it seems to have dropped out of support.\nThus `crossterm` is the only remaining backend and it's very actively developed.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThanks to [jwalk][jwalk], all there was left to do is to write a command-line interface. As `jwalk` matures, **dua** should benefit instantly.\n\n### Limitations\n\n* Does not show symbolic links at all if no path is provided when invoking `dua`\n  * in an effort to skip symbolic links, for now there are pruned and are not used as a root. Symbolic links will be shown if they\n    are not a traversal root, but will not be followed.\n* Interactive mode only looks good in dark terminals (see [this issue](https://github.com/Byron/dua-cli/issues/13))\n* _easy fix_: file names in main window are not truncated if too large. They are cut off on the right.\n* There are plenty of examples in `tests/fixtures` which don't render correctly in interactive mode.\n  This can be due to graphemes not interpreted correctly. With Chinese characters for instance,\n  column sizes are not correctly computed, leading to certain columns not being shown.\n  In other cases, the terminal gets things wrong - I use alacritty, and with certain characaters it\n  performs worse than, say iTerm3.\n  See https://github.com/minimaxir/big-list-of-naughty-strings/blob/master/blns.txt for the source.\n* In interactive mode, you will need about 60MB of memory for 1 million entries in the graph.\n* In interactive mode, the maximum amount of files is limited to 2^32 - 1 (`u32::max_value() - 1`) entries.\n  * One node is used as to 'virtual' root\n  * The actual amount of nodes stored might be lower, as there might be more edges than nodes, which are also limited by a `u32` (I guess)\n  * The limitation is imposed by the underlying [`petgraph`][petgraph] crate, which declares it as `unsafe` to use u64 for instance.\n  * It's possibly *UB* when that limit is reached, however, it was never observed either.\n\n### Similar Programs \n\n* **CLI:**\n  * `du`\n  * [`dust`](https://github.com/bootandy/dust)\n  * [`dutree`](https://github.com/nachoparker/dutree)\n  * [`pdu`](https://github.com/KSXGitHub/parallel-disk-usage)\n* **TUI:**\n  * [`ncdu`](https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu)\n  * [`gdu`](https://github.com/dundee/gdu)\n  * [`godu`](https://github.com/viktomas/godu)\n* **GUI:**\n  * [GNOME's Disk Usage Analyzer, a.k.a. `baobab`](https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Apps/DiskUsageAnalyzer)\n  * [Filelight](https://apps.kde.org/filelight/)\n  \n[petgraph]: https://crates.io/crates/petgraph\n[rustup]: https://rustup.rs/\n[jwalk]: https://crates.io/crates/jwalk\n[tui]: https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs\n"
