The meeting is subject to change depending on contributors'\navailability. Check the [OpenTelemetry community\ncalendar](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community?tab=readme-ov-file#calendar)\nfor specific dates and for Zoom meeting links. \"OTel Rust SIG\" is the name of\nmeeting for this group.\n\nMeeting notes are available as a public [Google\ndoc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tGKuCsSnyT2McDncVJrMgg74_z8V06riWZa0Sr79I_4/edit).\nIf you have trouble accessing the doc, please get in touch on\n[Slack](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C03GDP0H023).\n\nThe meeting is open for all to join. We invite everyone to join our meeting,\nregardless of your experience level. Whether you're a seasoned OpenTelemetry\ndeveloper, just starting your journey, or simply curious about the work we do,\nyou're more than welcome to participate!\n\nEven though, anybody can contribute, there are benefits of being a member of our\ncommunity. See to the [community membership\ndocument](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/main/guides/contributor/membership.md)\non how to become a\n[**Member**](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/main/guides/contributor/membership.md#member),\n[**Approver**](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/main/guides/contributor/membership.md#approver)\nand\n[**Maintainer**](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/main/guides/contributor/membership.md#maintainer).\n\n## Pull Requests\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nCrate `opentelemetry-otlp` uses gRPC + Protocol Buffers.\nYou can provide the protocol compiler protoc path programmatically (only works with tonic) or build it from source\n\n```sh\nexport PROTOC=$(which protoc)\n```\n\nIt is recommended to use \"3.15\" or newer of protoc, as some of the proto\ndefinitions include \"optional\" fields, that are not supported in older versions,\nresulting in errors as shown\n[here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/issues/451).\n\nPrerequisites to build the protocol compiler protoc from source\n\n- [protoc](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf)\n- [cmake](https://cmake.org)\n- [llvm](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html) (and `LIBCLANG_PATH` environment variable pointing to the `bin` directory of LLVM install)\n\n### How to Send Pull Requests\n\nEveryone is welcome to contribute code to `opentelemetry-rust` via\nGitHub pull requests (PRs).\n\n```sh\ngit clone --recurse-submodule https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-rust\n```\n\nEnter the newly created directory and add your fork as a new remote:\n\n```sh\ngit remote add <YOUR_FORK> git@github.com:<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/opentelemetry-rust\n```\n\nCheck out a new branch, make modifications, run linters and tests, and\npush the branch to your fork:\n\n```sh\n$ git checkout -b <YOUR_BRANCH_NAME>\n# edit files\n$ git add -p\n$ git commit\n$ git push <YOUR_FORK> <YOUR_BRANCH_NAME>\n```\n\nOpen a pull request against the main\n[opentelemetry-rust](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-rust)\nrepo.\n\n> **Note**\n> It is recommended to run [pre-commit script](scripts/precommit.sh) from the root of\nthe repo to catch any issues locally.\n\n### How to Receive Comments\n\n- If the PR is not ready for review, please put `[WIP]` in the title or mark it\n  as [`draft`](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/).\n- Make sure CLA is signed and all required CI checks are clear.\n- Submit small, focused PRs addressing a single concern/issue.\n- Make sure the PR title reflects the contribution.\n- Write a summary that helps understand the change.\n- Include usage examples in the summary, where applicable.\n- Include benchmarks (before/after) in the summary, for contributions that are\n  performance enhancements.\n\n### How to Get PRs Merged\n\nA PR is considered to be **ready to merge** when:\n\n- It has received approval from\n  [Approvers](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/main/guides/contributor/membership.md#approver).\n  /\n  [Maintainers](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/blob/main/guides/contributor/membership.md#maintainer).\n- Major feedbacks are resolved.\n\nAny Maintainer can merge the PR once it is **ready to merge**. Note, that some\nPRs may not be merged immediately if the repo is in the process of a release and\nthe maintainers decided to defer the PR to the next release train. Also,\nmaintainers may decide to wait for more than one approval for certain PRs,\nparticularly ones that are affecting multiple areas, or topics that may warrant\nmore discussion.\n\n## Design Choices\n\nAs with other OpenTelemetry clients, opentelemetry-rust follows the\n[opentelemetry-specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification).\n\nIt's especially valuable to read through the [library\nguidelines](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/master/specification/library-guidelines.md).\n\n### Focus on Capabilities, Not Structure Compliance\n\nOpenTelemetry is an evolving specification, one where the desires and\nuse cases are clear, but the method to satisfy those uses cases are\nnot.\n\nAs such, Contributions should provide functionality and behavior that\nconforms to the specification, but the interface and structure is\nflexible.\n\nIt is preferable to have contributions follow the idioms of the\nlanguage rather than conform to specific API names or argument\npatterns in the spec.\n\nFor a deeper discussion, see:\n<https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/issues/165>\n\n### Error Handling\n\nCurrently, the Opentelemetry Rust SDK has two ways to handle errors. In the situation where errors are not allowed to return. One should call global error handler to process the errors. Otherwise, one should return the errors.\n\nThe Opentelemetry Rust SDK comes with an error type `opentelemetry::Error`. For different function, one error has been defined. All error returned by trace module MUST be wrapped in `opentelemetry::trace::TraceError`. All errors returned by metrics module MUST be wrapped in `opentelemetry::metrics::MetricError`. All errors returned by logs module MUST be wrapped in `opentelemetry::logs::LogsError`.\n\nFor users that want to implement their own exporters. It's RECOMMENDED to wrap all errors from the exporter into a crate-level error type, and implement `ExporterError` trait.\n\n### Priority of configurations\n\nOpenTelemetry supports multiple ways to configure the API, SDK and other components. The priority of configurations is as follows:\n\n- Environment variables\n- Compiling time configurations provided in the source code\n\n### Experimental/Unstable features\n\nUse `otel_unstable` feature flag for implementation of specification with [experimental](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/v1.27.0/specification/document-status.md) status. This approach ensures clear demarcation and safe integration of new or evolving features. Utilize the following structure:\n\n```rust\n#[cfg(feature = \"otel_unstable\")]\n{\n    // Your feature implementation\n}\n```\n\nIt's important to regularly review and remove the `otel_unstable` flag from the code once the feature becomes stable. This cleanup process is crucial to maintain the overall code quality and to ensure that stable features are accurately reflected in the main build.\n\n### Optional features\n\nThe potential features include:\n\n- Stable and non-experimental features that compliant to specification, and have a feature flag to minimize compilation size. Example: feature flags for signals (like `logs`, `traces`, `metrics`) and runtimes (`rt-tokio`, `rt-tokio-current-thread`, `rt-async-std`).\n- Stable and non-experimental features, although not part of the specification, are crucial for enhancing the tracing/log crate's functionality or boosting performance. These features are also subject to discussion and approval by the OpenTelemetry Rust Maintainers.\n\nAll such features should adhere to naming convention  `<signal>_<feature_name>`\n\n## Style Guide\n\n- Run `cargo clippy --all` - this will catch common mistakes and improve\nyour Rust code\n- Run `cargo fmt` - this will find and fix code formatting\nissues.\n\n## Testing and Benchmarking\n\n- Run `cargo test --all` - this will execute code and doc tests for all\nprojects in this workspace.\n- Run `cargo bench` - this will run benchmarks to show performance\n- Run `cargo bench` - this will run benchmarks to show performance\nregressions\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Where should I put third party propagators/exporters, contrib or standalone crates?\n\nAs of now, the specification classify the propagators into three categories:\nFully opened standards, platform-specific standards, proprietary headers. The\nconclusion is only the fully opened standards should live in SDK packages/repos.\nSo here, only fully opened standards should live as independent crate. For more\ndetail and discussion, see [this\npr](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/pull/1144).\n"

You\ncan export and analyze them using [Prometheus], [Jaeger], and other\nobservability tools.\n\n*[Supported Rust Versions](#supported-rust-versions)*\n\n[Prometheus]: https://prometheus.io\n[Jaeger]: https://www.jaegertracing.io\n\n## Project Status\n\nThe table below summarizes the overall status of each component. Some components\ninclude unstable features, which are documented in their respective crate\ndocumentation.\n\n| Signal/Component      | Overall Status     |\n| --------------------  | ------------------ |\n| Logs-API              | RC*                |\n| Logs-SDK              | Beta               |\n| Logs-OTLP Exporter    | Beta               |\n| Logs-Appender-Tracing | Beta               |\n| Metrics-API           | RC                 |\n| Metrics-SDK           | Beta               |\n| Metrics-OTLP Exporter | Beta               |\n| Traces-API            | Beta               |\n| Traces-SDK            | Beta               |\n| Traces-OTLP Exporter  | Beta               |\n\n*OpenTelemetry Rust is not introducing a new end user callable Logging API.\nInstead, it provides [Logs Bridge\nAPI](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/logs/api.md),\nthat allows one to write log appenders that can bridge existing logging\nlibraries to the OpenTelemetry log data model. The following log appenders are\navailable:\n\n* [opentelemetry-appender-log](opentelemetry-appender-log/README.md)\n* [opentelemetry-appender-tracing](opentelemetry-appender-tracing/README.md)\n\nIf you already use the logging APIs from above, continue to use them, and use\nthe appenders above to bridge the logs to OpenTelemetry. If you are using a\nlibrary not listed here, feel free to contribute a new appender for the same.\n\nIf you are starting fresh, then consider using\n[tracing](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing) as your logging API. It supports\nstructured logging and is actively maintained.\n\nProject versioning information and stability guarantees can be found\n[here](VERSIONING.md).\n\n## Getting Started\n\n```rust\nuse opentelemetry::{\n    global,\n    trace::{Tracer, TracerProvider as _},\n};\nuse opentelemetry_sdk::trace::TracerProvider;\n\nfn main() {\n    // Create a new trace pipeline that prints to stdout\n    let provider = TracerProvider::builder()\n        .with_simple_exporter(opentelemetry_stdout::SpanExporter::default())\n        .build();\n    let tracer = provider.tracer(\"readme_example\");\n\n    tracer.in_span(\"doing_work\", |cx| {\n        // Traced app logic here...\n    });\n\n    // Shutdown trace pipeline\n    provider.shutdown().expect(\"TracerProvider should shutdown successfully\")\n}\n```\n\nThe example above requires the following packages:\n\n```toml\n# Cargo.toml\n[dependencies]\nopentelemetry = \"0.22\"\nopentelemetry_sdk = \"0.22\"\nopentelemetry-stdout = { version = \"0.3\", features = [\"trace\"] }\n```\n\nSee the [examples](./examples) directory for different integration patterns.\n\n## Overview of crates\n\nThe following crates are maintained in this repo:\n\n* [`opentelemetry`] This is the OpenTelemetry API crate, and is the crate\n  required to instrument libraries and applications. It contains Context API,\n  Baggage API, Propagators API, Logging Bridge API, Metrics API, and Tracing\n  API.\n* [`opentelemetry-sdk`] This is the OpenTelemetry SDK crate, and contains the\n  official OpenTelemetry SDK implementation. It contains Logging SDK, Metrics\n  SDK, and Tracing SDK. It also contains propagator implementations.\n* [`opentelemetry-otlp`] - exporter to send telemetry (logs, metrics and traces)\n  in the [OTLP\n  format](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/main/specification/protocol)\n  to an endpoint accepting OTLP. This could be the [OTel\n  Collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector),\n  telemetry backends like [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/),\n  [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/feature_flags/#otlp-receiver)\n  or [vendor specific endpoints](https://opentelemetry.io/ecosystem/vendors/).\n* [`opentelemetry-stdout`] exporter for sending logs, metrics and traces to\n  stdout, for learning/debugging purposes.  \n* [`opentelemetry-http`] This crate contains utility functions to help with\n  exporting telemetry, propagation, over [`http`].\n* [`opentelemetry-appender-log`] This crate provides logging appender to route\n  logs emitted using the [log](https://docs.rs/log/latest/log/) crate to\n  opentelemetry.\n* [`opentelemetry-appender-tracing`] This crate provides logging appender to\n  route logs emitted using the [tracing](https://crates.io/crates/tracing) crate\n  to opentelemetry.  \n* [`opentelemetry-jaeger-propagator`] provides context propagation using [jaeger\n  propagation\n  format](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.18/client-libraries/#propagation-format).\n* [`opentelemetry-prometheus`] provides a pipeline and exporter for sending\n  metrics to [`Prometheus`].\n* [`opentelemetry-semantic-conventions`] provides standard names and semantic\n  otel conventions.\n* [`opentelemetry-zipkin`] provides a pipeline and exporter for sending traces\n  to [`Zipkin`].\n\nIn addition, there are several other useful crates in the [OTel Rust Contrib\nrepo](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-rust-contrib). A lot of\ncrates maintained outside OpenTelemetry owned repos can be found in the\n[OpenTelemetry\nRegistry](https://opentelemetry.io/ecosystem/registry/?language=rust).\n\n[`opentelemetry`]: https://crates.io/crates/opentelemetry\n[`opentelemetry-sdk`]: https://crates.io/crates/opentelemetry-sdk\n[`opentelemetry-appender-log`]: https://crates.io/crates/opentelemetry-appender-log\n[`opentelemetry-appender-tracing`]: https://crates.io/crates/opentelemetry-appender-tracing\n[`opentelemetry-http`]: https://crates.io/crates/opentelemetry-http\n[`opentelemetry-otlp`]: https://crates.io/crates/opentelemetry-otlp\n[`opentelemetry-stdout`]: https://crates.io/crates/opentelemetry-stdout\n[`opentelemetry-jaeger-propagator`]: https://crates.io/crates/opentelemetry-jaeger-propagator\n[`opentelemetry-prometheus`]: https://crates.io/crates/opentelemetry-prometheus\n[`Prometheus`]: https://prometheus.io\n[`opentelemetry-zipkin`]: https://crates.io/crates/opentelemetry-zipkin\n[`Zipkin`]: https://zipkin.io\n[`opentelemetry-semantic-conventions`]: https://crates.io/crates/opentelemetry-semantic-conventions\n[`http`]: https://crates.io/crates/http\n\n## Supported Rust Versions\n\nOpenTelemetry is built against the latest stable release. The minimum supported\nversion is 1.75. The current OpenTelemetry version is not guaranteed to build\non Rust versions earlier than the minimum supported version.\n\nThe current stable Rust compiler and the three most recent minor versions\nbefore it will always be supported. For example, if the current stable compiler\nversion is 1.49, the minimum supported version will not be increased past 1.46,\nthree minor versions prior. Increasing the minimum supported compiler version\nis not considered a semver breaking change as long as doing so complies with\nthis policy.\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee the [contributing file](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nThe Rust special interest group (SIG) meets weekly on Tuesdays at 9 AM Pacific\nTime. The meeting is subject to change depending on contributors' availability.\nCheck the [OpenTelemetry community\ncalendar](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community?tab=readme-ov-file#calendar)\nfor specific dates and for Zoom meeting links. \"OTel Rust SIG\" is the name of\nmeeting for this group.\n\nMeeting notes are available as a public [Google\ndoc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12upOzNk8c3SFTjsL6IRohCWMgzLKoknSCOOdMakbWo4/edit).\nIf you have trouble accessing the doc, please get in touch on\n[Slack](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C03GDP0H023).\n\nThe meeting is open for all to join. We invite everyone to join our meeting,\nregardless of your experience level.

          "content": "# Versioning\n\nThis document describes the versioning policy for this repository. This policy\nis designed so the following goals can be achieved.\n\n## Goals\n\n### API Stability\n\nOnce the API for a given signal (spans, logs, metrics, baggage) has been\nofficially released, that API module will function with any SDK that has the\nsame major version, and equal or greater minor or patch version.\n\nFor example, libraries that are instrumented with `opentelemetry 1.0.1` will\nfunction in applications using `opentelemetry 1.11.33` or `opentelemetry\n1.3.4`.\n\n### SDK Stability\n\nPublic portions of the SDK (constructors, configuration, end-user interfaces)\nmust remain backwards compatible. Internal types are allowed to break.\n\n## Policy\n\n* Releases will follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/).\n* New telemetry signals will be introduced behind experimental \n  [cargo features](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html).\n\n  * New signals will be stabilized via a **minor version bump**, and are not\n    allowed to break existing stable interfaces.\n\n* GitHub releases will be made for all released versions.\n* Crates will be released on crates.io\n\n## Example Versioning Lifecycle\n\nTo better understand the implementation of the above policy, here is an example\nof how the metrics and logging signals **could** stabilize.\n\n- v1.0.0 release:\n   - `opentelemetry 1.0.0`\n     - Contains stable impls of trace, baggage, resource, context modules\n     - experimental metrics impl behind feature flag\n   - `opentelemetry-semantic-conventions 1.0.0`\n     - Contains stable impls of trace, resource conventions\n     - experimental metrics conventions behind feature flag\n   - `opentelemetry-contrib 1.0.0`\n     - Contains stable impls of 3rd party trace exporters and propagators\n     - experimental metrics exporters and propagator impls behind feature flag\n- v1.5.0 release (with metrics)\n   - `opentelemetry 1.5.0`\n     - Contains stable impls of metrics, trace, baggage, resource, context modules\n     - experimental logging impl still only behind feature flag\n   - `opentelemetry-semantic-conventions 1.2.0`\n     - Contains stable impls of metrics, trace, resource conventions\n     - experimental logging conventions still only behind feature flag\n   - `opentelemetry-contrib 1.6.0`\n     - Contains stable impls of 3rd party trace and metrics exporters and propagators\n     - experimental logging exporters and propagator still impls behind feature flag\n- v1.10.0 release (with logging)\n   - `opentelemetry 1.10.0`\n     - Contains stable impls of logging, metrics, trace, baggage, resource, context modules\n   - `opentelemetry-semantic-conventions 1.4.0`\n     - Contains stable impls of logging, metrics, trace, resource conventions\n   - `opentelemetry-contrib 1.12.0`\n     - Contains stable impls of 3rd party trace, metrics, and logging exporters and propagators\n"
