[`core::labels`](https://docs.rs/kube/latest/kube/core/labels/index.html) module for creating typed label selectors for  [`ListParams`](https://docs.rs/kube/latest/kube/core/params/struct.ListParams.html#method.labels_from) or [`WatchParams`](https://docs.rs/kube/latest/kube/core/params/struct.WatchParams.html#method.labels_from). Can be constructed from a native [`LabelSelector`](https://docs.rs/k8s-openapi/latest/k8s_openapi/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1/struct.LabelSelector.html), or directly from a [`Selector`](https://docs.rs/kube/latest/kube/core/struct.Selector.html) of [`Expression`](https://docs.rs/kube/latest/kube/core/enum.Expression.html)s. [PR](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1539).\n2.  [`prelude`](https://docs.rs/kube/latest/kube/prelude/index.html) to simplify imports of extension traits. [PR](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1539).\n\nA big thank you to everyone who contributed to this release!\n\n## What's Changed\n### Added\n* add option to provide headers to send as client by @aviramha in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1523\n* Add prelude for blanket and extension traits across sub-crates by @Danil-Grigorev in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1527\n* Label selector support by @Danil-Grigorev in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1539\n### Changed\n* Update garde requirement from 0.19.0 to 0.20.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1535\n### Removed\n* runtime: remove deprecated default_backoff by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1518\n### Fixed\n* Fix watcher not fully paginating on Init by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1525 (ported to 0.92.1)\n* Prevent empty string object name requests from being sent to the apiserver by @xMAC94x in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1541\n\n[0.92.1](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/releases/tag/0.92.1) / 2024-06-19\n===================\n## Bugfix Release\nThis release fixes [#1524](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/1524); a regression from [0.92.0](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/releases/tag/0.92.0) causing `watcher` to skip pages on initial list. See [#1525](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1525).\n\nIt is recommended to upgrade from 0.92.0.\n\n## What's Changed\n### Fixed\n* Fix watcher not fully paginating on Init by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1525\n\n[0.92.0](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/releases/tag/0.92.0) / 2024-06-12\n===================\n<!-- Release notes generated using configuration in .github/release.yml at 0.92.0 -->\n## Runtime: Decreased Memory Usage from `watcher`\nBuffering of [initial pages](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#retrieving-large-results-sets-in-chunks) / [init streams](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#streaming-lists) is no longer a mandatory process with [`watcher::Event`](https://docs.rs/kube/latest/kube/runtime/watcher/enum.Event.html) gaining new `Init`, `InitApply`, and `InitDone` events. These events are read on the [store side](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/blob/0f6cb6f0ac695444f6789f98fa07073f4980a127/kube-runtime/src/reflector/store.rs#L99-L134) maintaining the atomicity/completeness guarantees for `reflector` and `Store` users.\n\nThis constitutes a significant memory decrease for all `watcher` users, and it has more details in a new [kube.rs/blog post](https://kube.rs/blog/2024/06/11/watcher-memory-improvements/).\n\nThe downside is a **breaking change** to [`watcher::Event`](https://docs.rs/kube/latest/kube/runtime/watcher/enum.Event.html). Plain usage of `watcher` / `reflector` / `Controller` should generally not need to change anything, but custom stores / matches on `watcher::Event` will [need an update](https://kube.rs/blog/2024/06/11/watcher-memory-improvements/#breaking-change). If you are writing custom stores, the new signals should be helpful for improved caching.\n\nThanks to @fabriziosestito via [Kubewarden](https://www.kubewarden.io/) for https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1494 . Follow-ups for this feature: https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1499 and https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1504.\n\n## Client: HTTP Proxy Support\nSupport is now introduced under the `http-proxy` [feature](https://kube.rs/features) pulling in [hyper-http-proxy](https://crates.io/crates/hyper-http-proxy) complementing the already existing `socks5` proxy feature.\n\nThanks to @aviramha via [MetalBear](https://metalbear.co/) for the support in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1496, with follow-ups https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1501 + https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1502\n\n## What's Changed\n### Added\n* Added support for HTTP proxy with hyper-proxy2 by @aviramha in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1496\n* Implement client native object reference fetching by @Danil-Grigorev in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1511\n### Changed\n* Reduce buffering between watcher and Store by @fabriziosestito in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1494\n* Rename new watcher Event names and remove one that cannot happen by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1499\n* Update `tokio-tungstenite` to 0.23 by @Toasterson in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1509\n* Align `watcher::Event` init/page variants by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1504\n* Update json-patch to 2.0.0 by @bobsongplus in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1507\n### Fixed\n* Fix potentially panicing unchecked duration adds in runtime by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1489\n* ObjectList now accepts null metadata like upstream k8s does by @aviramha in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1492\n* rename http_proxy feature to http-proxy and add it to the umbrella crate by @aviramha in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1501\n* move from `hyper-proxy2` to `hyper-http-proxy` by @aviramha in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1502\n\n[0.91.0](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/releases/tag/0.91.0) / 2024-05-06\n===================\n<!-- Release notes generated using configuration in .github/release.yml at 0.91.0 -->\n## Kubernetes `v1_30` support via `k8s-openapi` [0.22](https://github.com/Arnavion/k8s-openapi/releases/tag/v0.22.0)\nPlease [upgrade k8s-openapi along with kube](https://kube.rs/upgrading/) to avoid conflicts.\n\n## Unstable Stream Sharing\nA more complete implementation that allows sharing `watcher` streams between multiple `Controller`s (for https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/1080) has been added under the `unstable-runtime` [feature-flag](https://kube.rs/stability/#unstable-features) in [#1449](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/1449) and [#1483](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/1483) by @mateiidavid. This represents the first usable implementation of shared streams (and replaces the older prototype part in [#1470](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/1470)). While some changes are expected, you can check the [shared_stream_controller example](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/blob/main/examples/shared_stream_controllers.rs) for a high-level overview.\n\n## What's Changed\n### Added\n* Add shared stream interfaces by @mateiidavid in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1449\n* Allow to create non-controller owner reference for resource by @Danil-Grigorev in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1475\n* feat(runtime): support for owned shared streams by @mateiidavid in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1483\n### Changed\n* Upgrade `k8s-openapi` to 0.22 and bump MK8SV to 1.25 by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1485\n### Removed\n* Remove abandoned `StreamSubscribe` implementation by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1470\n### Fixed\n* Include inner error message in Display for SerdeError by @XAMPPRocky in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1481\n* Remove invalid `uniqueItems` property from CRDs when Sets are used  by @sbernauer in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1484\n\n[0.90.0](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/releases/tag/0.90.0) / 2024-04-03\n===================\n<!-- Release notes generated using configuration in .github/release.yml at 0.90.0 -->\n## Highlights\n### [`kube::client::Body`](https://docs.rs/kube/latest/kube/client/struct.Body.html) Improvements\n- Unit testing helpers [#1444](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/1444) + [#1445](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/1445),\n- Accuracy; `size_hint` and `is_end_stream` implemented in [#1452](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/1452) + internal cleanups [#1453](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/1453) and [#1455](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/1455)\n\n### Dependency Cleanups\n- `rustls` to 0.23 in [#1457](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/1457)\n- `once_cell` removed in [#1447](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/1447) (no longer needed)\n- `futures` feature prune in [#1442](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/1442)\n- `chrono` features prune in [#1448](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/1448), and bump its min version pin in [#1458](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/1458)\n\n## What's Changed\n### Added\n* Add proxy `Body::collect_bytes` for easier unit tests by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1445\n### Changed\n* update to `rustls` 0.23 by @tottoto in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1457\n### Fixed\n* disable unused `futures` feature by @tottoto in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1442\n* Expose `Body::empty` for easier tests by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1444\n* replace `once_cell` Lazy with ordinary static by @tottoto in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1447\n* replace `chrono` feature `clock` with `now` by @tottoto in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1448\n* implement `http_body` trait method by @tottoto in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1452\n* Fix examples for custom clients not authenticating by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1450\n* Set a compatible minimum `chrono` version by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1458\n\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/compare/0.89.0...0.90.0\n[0.89.0](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/releases/tag/0.89.0) / 2024-03-26\n===================\n<!-- Release notes generated using configuration in .github/release.yml at 0.89.0 -->\n\n## Upgrading `hyper` and `http` to 1.0 and MSRV to `1.75.0`\nThis release completes the hyper & http ecosystem upgrade [#1351](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/1351) via [#1438](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1438). In particular, this change includes upgrades to `http`, `http-body`, `tower-http`, `hyper`, `hyper-openssl`, `hyper-rustls`, `hyper-socks2`, `hyper-timeout`, `tame-oauth`, `tokio-tungstenite`, `tower-http`, `rustls`, `rustls-pemfile`, as well as adopting the new `hyper_util` and `http_body_util` to make the change.\n\nWhile this change constitutes significant internal churn (and a new [`kube::client::Body`](https://docs.rs/kube/latest/kube/client/struct.Body.html)), our external api remains largely unchanged. Some minor changes are necessary for custom clients, and for integration testing using `tower_mock`. See the [controller-rs upgrade pr](https://github.com/kube-rs/controller-rs/pull/68) or the [examples folder in this

configuration in .github/release.yml at 0.86.0 -->\n\n## Headlines\n### k8s-openapi 0.20 for Kubernetes `v1_28`\n**Please note [upstream api removals](https://github.com/Arnavion/k8s-openapi/issues/149)**.\nAs usual, [upgrade k8s-openapi along with kube](https://kube.rs/upgrading/) to avoid issues.\n\n### Default TLS stack changed to `rustls`\nWith last year's upstream changes from rustls (closing all our existing rustls issues - see https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/1192), this is now the better choice for security, features, and ease of building. The previous default openssl stack can still be used with `default-features = false` plus the `openssl-tls` feature.\n\n### Controller Configuration\nA controller [`Config`](https://docs.rs/kube/latest/kube/runtime/struct.Config.html) has been added to allow tweaking two behaviour parameters (debouncing  in [#1265](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/1265) and concurrency limits in [#1277](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/1277)) of the `Controller`. Huge thanks to @aryan9600 for his work.\n\n### Streaming Lists\nThe `sendInitialEvents` [alpha feature](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#streaming-lists) is now [supported](https://docs.rs/kube/latest/kube/runtime/watcher/struct.Config.html#structfield.initial_list_strategy), and is quickly testable in the [pod_watcher example](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/blob/c8e98285362e1d0739c56baf27aaab703051dcd4/examples/pod_watcher.rs#L15-L21) when using the [feature gate](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/blob/c8e98285362e1d0739c56baf27aaab703051dcd4/justfile#L91). This will help [optimise](https://kube.rs/controllers/optimization/) the memory profile of controllers when the feature becomes generally available. Amazing work by first time contributor @casualjim.\n\n## What's Changed\n### Added\n* add `controller::Config` and debounce period to scheduler by @aryan9600 in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1265\n* adds watch-list implementation without breaking changes by @casualjim in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1255\n* allow configuring controller's concurrency by @aryan9600 in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1277\n### Changed\n* Change default TLS stack to `rustls-tls` by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1261\n* Bump k8s-openapi to 0.20.0 by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1291\n### Fixed\n* `core`: omit invalid resource version parameters when doing paged requests by @goenning in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1281\n\n[0.85.0](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/releases/tag/0.85.0) / 2023-08-06\n===================\n<!-- Release notes generated using configuration in .github/release.yml at 0.85.0 -->\n\n## What's Changed\n### Added\n* Add `WatchStreamExt::reflect` to allow chaining on a reflector  by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1252\n* Implement ephemeral containers subresource by @jmintb in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1153\n### Changed\n* Swap `dirs-next` dependency to cargo-team maintained `home` crate by @utkarshgupta137 in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1207\n* Upgrade `k8s-openapi` to `0.19.0` for `v1_27` support by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1271\n### Fixed\n* `watcher`: return `NoResourceVersion` error if resource version is empty by @aryan9600 in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1259\n* Update the `scheduler` message when preponing by @nightkr in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1260\n\n[0.84.0](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/releases/tag/0.84.0) / 2023-07-14\n===================\n<!-- Release notes generated using configuration in .github/release.yml at 0.84.0 -->\n\n## Highlights\n### Stream Improvements\nOn the `runtime` side, the `Controller` now delays reconciles until the main `Store` is ready (via a [new `Store` helper](https://docs.rs/kube/0.84.0/kube/runtime/reflector/struct.Store.html#method.wait_until_ready) from [#1243](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/1243)). The stream selection for owned resources is more efficient (#1240), and the underlying `watcher` streams now all paginate (#1249). There are also many new  [`WatchStreamExt`](https://docs.rs/kube/0.84.0/kube/runtime/trait.WatchStreamExt.html) helpers ( [#1246](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/1246) + [#1228](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/1228) + [#1232](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/1232)) as a continued work towards the more customisable streams-api (#1080).\n\nOn the client-side; streaming logs are now easier to deal with as an `AsyncBufRead` [#1235](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/1235).\n\n### OIDC Refresh\nOptional OIDC refreshable token support was introduced in [#1229](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/1229) under `kube/oidc` for out-of-cluster `Client` configuration. Previously, refresh support was limited to non-OIDC tokens from the `GcpOuth` provider (`kube/oauth`) or through arbitrary `exec` calls / `TokenFile` loading.\n\n## What's Changed\n### Added\n* Add `Predicate` trait to allow combination + fallbacks by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1228\n* Added refreshing OIDC ID token as an optional feature by @Razz4780 in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1229\n* Add `WatchStreamExt::default_backoff` shorthand by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1232\n* Derive `PartialEq` on `core` params structs by @danrspencer in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1237\n* Track store readiness by @nightkr in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1243\n* Add `WatchStreamExt::modify()` to modify events by @aryan9600 in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1246\n* Add default pagination to `watcher` by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1249\n### Changed\n* Bump MSRV from 1.63 to 1.64 by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1233\n* Change `Api::log_stream` to return `AsyncBufRead` by @aryan9600 in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1235\n### Fixed\n* Make `Controller::owns` use `metadata_watcher` internally by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1240\n\n[0.83.0](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/releases/tag/0.83.0) / 2023-06-05\n===================\n<!-- Release notes generated using configuration in .github/release.yml at 0.83.0 -->\n\n## What's Changed\n### Added\n* Add `Controller::reconcile_on` by @co42 in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1163\n* Add `predicates::resource_version` by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1221\n* add `Duration` to `kube-core` by @hawkw in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1224\n### Changed\n* Introduce `GetParams` support by @mateiidavid in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1214\n### Fixed\n* Swap `validator` for `garde` by @mateiidavid in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1212\n* fix: `#[kube(crates(serde = \"some_crate::serde\"))]` was not working by @chubei in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1215\n\n[0.82.2](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/releases/tag/0.82.2) / 2023-04-19\n===================\n<!-- Release notes generated using configuration in .github/release.yml at 0.82.2 -->\n## Watcher Fixes\nTwo fixes to allow `watcher::Config` to function as intended.\n\n## What's Changed\n### Fixed\n* `runtime::watcher`: only set rv if semantic is any by @goenning in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1204\n* `watcher::Config`: Derive `Clone` + `Debug` + `PartialEq` by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1206\n\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/compare/0.82.1...0.82.2\n[0.82.1](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/releases/tag/0.82.1) / 2023-04-14\n===================\n<!-- Release notes generated using configuration in .github/release.yml at 0.82.1 -->\n## Bugfix Release\n\n[`nullable`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/#defaulting-and-nullable) is re-instated on `Option` types from [`CustomResource`](https://docs.rs/kube/latest/kube/derive.CustomResource.html) generated schemas, due to unintended errors removing it caused on `Api::patch` calls on `None` members that were not setting [`#[serde(skip_serializing_if = \"Option::is_none\")]`](https://serde.rs/attr-skip-serializing.html).

If you were using `api.list` directly, this should not affect you, but `api.watch` calls will need a replace of `ListParams` to `WatchParams`. Apart from the resulting field splitting, the two structs still have a mostly compatible api.\n\nIf you were passing `ListParams` to `watcher`, you can change this for a new `watcher::Config` with a mostly compatible interface:\n\n```diff\n-    let stream = watcher(api, ListParams::default());\n+    let stream = watcher(api, watcher::Config::default());\n```\n\nThe reason for this change has been to add support for specific [version match strategies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#semantics-for-get-and-list) and has new builders on both `ListParams` and `watcher::Config` to control the strategy. Using the new `VersionMatch::NotOlderThan` can reduce strain on the apiserver for individual `api.list` calls. Watchers will benefit the most from this, and **should consider** using the semantic `Any` strategy (= `NotOlderThan` with version \"0\") on all relists by setting `watcher::Config::any_semantic()`.\n\n### rustls\nThis release closes [all our rustls issues](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/labels/rustls) as a consequence of the long standing IP address incompatibility (#153) having been resolved upstream. All `rustls` specific overrides (such as using the deprecated `incluster_dns` strategy for configuration [#1184](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/1184)) have been removed as a result.\n\n### Controller streams\nMultiple new `runtime` features have been added to be able to more precisely control the input streams used by `Controller` a starting step towards stream sharing (#1080) and as a way to reduce excess input events. Because these interfaces are likely to remain in flux for some time, these are only available under [unstable feature flags](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/blob/main/kube-runtime/Cargo.toml#L17-L21).\n\n## What's Changed\n### Added\n* Add `predicates` to allow filtering `watcher` streams by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/911\n* Add `Controller::owns_stream` by @Dav1dde in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1173\n* Add `Controller::for_stream` + `Controller::watches_stream` by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1187\n### Changed\n* Split `ListParams` and `WatchParams` by @nabokihms in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1162\n* Make `VersionMatch` follow upstream + configure list semantics in `watcher::Config` by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1171\n* kube-derive: Disable `option_nullable` for CRD generation by @Dav1dde in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1079\n### Fixed\n* Run `rustls` CI against IP cluster address by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1183\n* Fix:  tower buffer's worker closed unexpectedly by @divinerapier in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1185\n* Avoid special `Config::incluster` behavior for `rustls` by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1184\n\n[0.80.0](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/releases/tag/0.80.0) / 2023-03-02\n===================\n<!-- Release notes generated using configuration in .github/release.yml at 0.80.0 -->\n## Notes\n\nThe `PartialObjectMeta` struct has been changed to allow static dispatch through a new generic parameter.

This is a variant api that **only** returns the `ObjectMeta` and `TypeMeta` to reduce network load, and has a low-level watch analogue available at `Api::watch_metadata`. Most users will generally want an infinite watch stream rather than the low-level method, so `kube::runtime::metadata_watcher` has been added as a direct analogue of `watcher` via [#1145](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/1145). The [dynamic_watcher example](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/blob/0f632eaa88b8eef2a232ca7c7dd1f841d32f6454/examples/dynamic_watcher.rs#L33-L54) shows how to switch between the two to get up and running.\n\nThe `watcher` also [emits warnings](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1134/files#diff-5078d84d257800c4fba86a30c501afa5fd4612473832bce7a02cd95099b1b474) now when HTTP `403`s are encountered from Kubernetes, as this usually indicates a non-transient misconfiguration that must be fixed on the administrator side with RBAC.\n\nFinally, there is work in progress on shared streams via `WatchStreamExt` from [#1131](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/1131) under an unstable feature.\n\n## What's Changed\n### Added\n* Client: expose `default_namespace()` by @jpmcb in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1123\n* Add support for metadata API by @mateiidavid in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1137\n* Runtime: Add `WatchStreamExt::subscribe` by @danrspencer in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1131\n* Introduce support for persistent metadata watches by @mateiidavid in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1145\n### Changed\n* Bump Rust MSRV to 1.63.0 by @mateiidavid in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1146\n### Fixed\n* `Config`: make cluster/users/clusters optional by @goenning in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1120\n* Add better logging for watcher errors by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1134\n* kubeconfig: deserialize null vectors as default by @goenning in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1142\n\n[0.78.0](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/releases/tag/0.78.0) / 2023-01-06\n===================\n<!-- Release notes generated using configuration in .github/release.yml at 0.78.0 -->\n\n## Kubernetes Bump\n\nThis release brings in the new [`k8s-openapi` release](https://github.com/Arnavion/k8s-openapi/releases/tag/v0.17.0) for `1.26` structs, and sets our [MK8SV](https://kube.rs/kubernetes-version/) to `1.21`.\nBe sure to upgrade `k8s-openapi` and `kube` **simultaneously** to avoid multiple version errors:\n\n```sh\ncargo upgrade -p k8s-openapi -p kube -i\n```\n\n## What's Changed\n### Added\n* reflector: add helper function to the `Store` by @eliad-wiz in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1111\n### Changed\n* Bump `k8s-openapi@0.17.0` and MK8SV by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1116\n### Removed\n* Remove deprecated `Config::timeout` by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1113\n### Fixed\n* fix shell exec exiting message loop when terminalSizeReceiver is dropped by @erebe in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1112\n\n[0.77.0](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/releases/tag/0.77.0) / 2022-12-15\n===================\n<!-- Release notes generated using configuration in .github/release.yml at 0.77.0 -->\n## Highlights\n\nThis release saw numerous improvements across various parts of the codebase with lots of help from external contributors. Look for improvements in error handling, client exec behaviour, dynamic object conversion, certificate handling, and last, but not least; lots of enhancements in the `config` module. Huge thanks to everyone who contributed!\n\n### `Config` Enhancements\nKubeconfigs relying on [`ExecConfig`](https://docs.rs/kube/0.77.0/kube/config/struct.ExecConfig.html) for auth should now work with a lot more cases (with improvements to script interactivity, cert passing, env-drop, and windows behaviour). We further aligned our [`Kubeconfig`](https://docs.rs/kube/0.77.0/kube/config/struct.Kubeconfig.html) parsing with client-go's behaviour, and also exposed [`Kubeconfig::merge`](https://docs.rs/kube/0.77.0/kube/config/struct.Kubeconfig.html#method.merge). Finally, we now pass [`Config::tls_server_name`](https://docs.rs/kube/0.77.0/kube/struct.Config.html#structfield.tls_server_name) through to the `Client`, which has let us include [a better **rustls** workaround](https://docs.rs/kube/0.77.0/kube/struct.Config.html#method.incluster) for the long-standing ip issue (enabled by default).\n\n## What's Changed\n### Added\n* Add `DynamicObjects::try_parse` for typed object conversion by @jmintb in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1061\n* Add `ExecConfig::drop_env` to filter host evars for auth providers by @aviramha in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1062\n* Add support for terminal size when executing command inside a container by @armandpicard in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/983\n* add cmd-drop-env to AuthProviderConfig by @aviramha in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1074\n* Check for client cert with exec by @rcanderson23 in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1089\n* Change `Kubeconfig::merge` fn to public. by @goenning in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1100\n* Fix interactivity in auth exec by @armandpicard in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1083\n### Changed\n* [windows] skip window creation on auth exec by @goenning in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1095\n* Add `Config::tls_server_name` and validate when using rustls by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1104\n### Removed\n* Remove deprecated `ResourceExt::name` by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1105\n### Fixed\n* Bump tracing dependency to 0.1.36 by @teozkr in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1070\n* Improve error message on azure auth not being supported by @goenning in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1082\n* exec: ensure certs always end with a new line by @goenning in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1096\n* fix: align kube-rs with client-go config parsing by @goenning in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1077\n* Return error from `watcher` when kinds do not support watch by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1101\n\n[0.76.0](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/releases/tag/0.76.0) / 2022-10-28\n===================\n<!-- Release notes generated using configuration in .github/release.yml at 0.76.0 -->\n\n## Highlights\n\n### [`#[derive(CustomResource)]` now supports schemas with untagged enums](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1028)\n\nExpanding on our existing support for storing Rust's struct enums in CRDs, Kube will now try to convert `#[serde(untagged)]` enums as well. Note that if the same field is present in multiple untagged variants then they must all have the same shape.\n\n### [Removed deprecated `try_flatten_*` functions](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1019)\n\nThese have been deprecated since 0.72, and are replaced by the equivalent `WatchStreamExt` methods.\n\n## What's Changed\n### Added\n* Adds example to `Controller::watches` by @Dav1dde in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1026\n* Discovery: Add `ApiGroup::resources_by_stability` by @imuxin in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1022\n* Add support for untagged enums in CRDs by @sbernauer in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1028\n* Derive PartialEq for DynamicObject by @pbzweihander in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1048\n### Removed\n* Runtime: Remove deprecated util `try_flatten_` helpers by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1019\n* Remove `native-tls` feature by @kazk in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1044\n### Fixed\n* add fieldManager querystring to all operations by @goenning in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1031\n* Add verify_tls1x_signature for NoCertVerification by @rvql in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1034\n* Fix compatibility with schemars' preserve_order feature by @teozkr in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1050\n* Hoist enum values from subschemas by @teozkr in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1051\n\n[0.75.0](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/releases/tag/0.75.0) / 2022-09-21\n===================\n<!-- Release notes generated using configuration in .github/release.yml at 0.75.0 -->\n\n## Highlights\n\n### [Upgrade `k8s-openapi` to 0.16 for Kubernetes 1.25](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1008)\n\nThe update to [k8s-openapi@0.16.0](https://github.com/Arnavion/k8s-openapi/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v0160-2022-09-15) makes this the first release with **tentative** Kubernetes 1.25 support.\nWhile the new structs and apis now exist, we **recommend holding off** on using 1.25 until a [deserialization bug in the apiserver](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/111985) is resolved upstream. See [#997](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/997) / [#1008](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/1008) for details.\n\nTo upgrade, ensure you bump both `kube` and `k8s-openapi`:\n\n```sh\ncargo upgrade kube k8s-openapi\n```\n\n### [New/Old `Config::incluster` default to connect in cluster](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1001)\n\nOur previous default of connecting to the Kubernetes apiserver via `kubernetes.default.svc` has been reverted back to use the old environment variables after [Kubernetes updated](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/112263) their position that the environment variables are not legacy. This does unfortunately regress on `rustls` support, so for those users we have included a [`Config::incluster_dns`](https://docs.rs/kube/latest/kube/struct.Config.html#method.incluster_dns) to work around the old [rustls issue](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/153) while it is open.\n\n### [Controller `error_policy` extension](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/995)\n\nThe `error_policy` fn now has access to the `object` that failed the reconciliation to ease metric creation / failure attribution. The following change is needed on the user side:\n\n```diff\n-fn error_policy(error: &Error, ctx: Arc<Data>) -> Action {\n+fn error_policy(_obj: Arc<YourObject>, error: &Error, ctx: Arc<Data>) -> Action {\n```\n\n### Polish / Subresources / Conversion\nThere are also a slew of ergonomics improvements, closing of [gaps in subresources](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/989), adding [initial support for `ConversionReview`](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/999), making [`Api::namespaced` impossible to use for non-namepaced resources](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/956) (a common pitfall), as well as many great fixes to the edge cases in [portforwarding](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/973) and [finalizers](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/965). Many of these changes came from first time contributors. A huge thank you to everyone involved.\n\n## What's Changed\n### Added\n* Make `Config::auth_info` public by @danrspencer in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/959\n* Make raw `Client::send` method public by @tiagolobocastro in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/972\n* Make `types` on `AdmissionRequest` and `AdmissionResponse` public by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/977\n* Add `#[serde(default)]` to metadata field of `DynamicObject` by @pbzweihander in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/987\n* Add `create_subresource` method to `Api` and `create_token_request` method to `Api<ServiceAccount>` by @pbzweihander in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/989\n* Controller: impl Eq and PartialEq for `Action` by @Sherlock-Holo in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/993\n* Add support for CRD `ConversionReview` types by @MikailBag in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/999\n### Changed\n* Constrain Resource trait and Api::namespaced by Scope by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/956\n* Add connect/read/write timeouts to `Config` by @goenning in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/971\n* Controller: Include the object being reconciled in the `error_policy` by @felipesere in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/995\n* `Config`: New `incluster` and `incluster_dns` constructors by @olix0r in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1001\n* Upgrade `k8s-openapi` to 0.16 by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/1008\n### Fixed\n* Remove `tracing::instrument` from `apply_debug_overrides` by @kazk in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/958\n* fix duplicate finalizers race condition by @alex-hunt-materialize in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/965\n* fix: portforward connection cleanup by @tiagolobocastro in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/973\n\n[0.74.0](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/releases/tag/0.74.0) / 2022-07-09\n===================\n<!-- Release notes generated using configuration in .github/release.yml at 0.74.0 -->\n\n## Highlights\n\n### Polish, bug fixes, guidelines, ci improvements, and new contributors\nThis release features smaller improvements/additions/cleanups/fixes, many of which are from new first-time contributors! Thank you everyone!\nThe listed [deadlock fix](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/925) was backported to 0.73.1.\n\nWe have also been trying to clarify and **prove** a lot more of our external-facing guarantees, and as a result:\n\n - We have codified our [Kubernetes versioning policy](https://kube.rs/kubernetes-version/) \n - The [Rust version policy](https://kube.rs/rust-version/) has extended its support range\n - Our [CI has been extended](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/924)\n\n### [`ResourceExt::name` deprecation](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/945)\n\nA consequence of all the policy writing and the improved clarity we have decided to deprecate the common [`ResourceExt::name`](https://docs.rs/kube/0.74.0/kube/trait.ResourceExt.html#tymethod.name) helper.\n\nThis method could panic and it is unexpected for the users and bad for our consistency. To get the old functionality, you can replace any `.name()` call on a Kubernetes resources with [`.name_unchecked()`](https://docs.rs/kube/0.74.0/kube/trait.ResourceExt.html#tymethod.name_unchecked); but as the name implies, it can panic (in a local setting, or during admission). We recommend you replace it with the new [`ResourceExt::name_any`](https://docs.rs/kube/0.74.0/kube/trait.ResourceExt.html#tymethod.name_any) for a general identifier:\n\n```diff\n-pod.name()\n+pod.name_any()\n```\n\n## What's Changed\n### Added\n* Add support for passing the `fieldValidation` query parameter on patch by @phroggyy in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/929\n* Add `conditions::is_job_completed` by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/935\n### Changed\n* Deprecate `ResourceExt::name` in favour of safe name_* alternatives by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/945\n### Removed\n* Remove `#[kube(apiextensions)]` flag from `kube-derive` by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/920\n### Fixed\n* Document every public derived fn from kube-derive by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/919\n* fix applier hangs which can happen with many watched objects by @moustafab in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/925\n* Applier: Improve reconciler reschedule context to avoid deadlocking on full channel by @teozkr in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/932\n* Fix deserialization issue in AdmissionResponse by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/939\n* Admission controller example fixes by @Alibirb in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/950\n\n[0.73.1](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/releases/tag/0.73.1) / 2022-06-03\n===================\n## Highlights\n\nThis patch release fixes a bug causing `applier` and `Controller` to deadlock when too many Kubernetes object change events were ingested at once. All users of `applier` and `Controller` are encouraged to upgrade as quickly as possible. Older versions are also affected, this bug is believed to have existed since the original release of `kube_runtime`.\n\n<!-- Release notes generated using configuration in .github/release.yml at 0.73.1 -->\n\n## What's Changed\n### Fixed\n* [0.73 backport] fix applier hangs which can happen with many watched objects (#925) by @moustafab (backported by @teozkr) in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/927\n\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/compare/0.73.0...0.73.1\n[0.73.0](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/releases/tag/0.73.0) / 2022-05-23\n===================\n\n## Highlights\n\n### [New `k8s-openapi` version and MSRV](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/916)\n\nSupport added for Kubernetes `v1_24` support via the [new `k8s-openapi` version](https://github.com/Arnavion/k8s-openapi/releases/tag/v0.15.0). Please also run `cargo upgrade --workspace k8s-openapi` when upgrading `kube`.\n\nThis also bumps our [MSRV](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2495-min-rust-version.html) to [`1.60.0`](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2022/04/07/Rust-1.60.0.html).\n\n### [Reconciler change](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/910)\nA small ergonomic change in the `reconcile` signature has removed the need for the `Context` object. This has been replaced by an [`Arc`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html). The following change is needed in your controller:\n\n```diff\n-async fn reconcile(doc: Arc<MyObject>, context: Context<Data>) -> Result<Action, Error>\n+async fn reconcile(doc: Arc<MyObject>, context: Arc<Data>) -> Result<Action, Error>\n```\n\nThis will simplify the usage of the `context` argument. You should no longer need to pass `.get_ref()` on its every use.\nSee the [controller-rs upgrade change for details](https://github.com/kube-rs/controller-rs/commit/2976e046409ec033b86dfe8d60173ebc2b4e5dbf#diff-7143adb2b6aaf4eac74de6b133c6a9cf6d2d34bf6929972361f93100abdfc074).\n\n## What's Changed\n### Added\n* Add Discovery::groups_alphabetical following kubectl sort order by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/887\n### Changed\n* Replace runtime::controller::Context with Arc by @teozkr in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/910\n* runtime: Return the object from `await_condition` by @olix0r in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/877\n* Bump k8s-openapi to 0.15 for kubernetes v1_24 and bump MSRV to 1.60 by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/916\n\n[0.72.0](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/releases/tag/0.72.0) / 2022-05-13\n===================\n\n## Highlights\n### Ergonomics improvements\nA new [`runtime::WatchSteamExt`](https://docs.rs/kube/latest/kube/runtime/trait.WatchStreamExt.html) ([#899](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/899) + [#906](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/906)) allows for simpler setups for streams from [`watcher`](https://docs.rs/kube/latest/kube/runtime/fn.watcher.html) or [`reflector`](https://docs.rs/kube/latest/kube/runtime/fn.reflector.html).\n\n```diff\n- let stream = utils::try_flatten_applied(StreamBackoff::new(watcher(api, lp), b));\n+ let stream = watcher(api, lp).backoff(b).applied_objects();\n```\n\nThe `util::try_flatten_*` helpers have been marked as deprecated since they are not used by the stream impls.\n\nA new [`reflector:store()`](https://docs.rs/kube/latest/kube/runtime/reflector/fn.store.html) fn allows simpler reflector setups [#907](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/907):\n\n```diff\n- let store = reflector::store::Writer::<Node>::default();\n- let reader = store.as_reader();\n+ let (reader, writer) = reflector::store();\n```\n\nAdditional conveniences getters/settes to [`ResourceExt`](https://docs.rs/kube/latest/kube/trait.ResourceExt.html) for manged_fields and creation_timestamp [#888](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/888) + [#898](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/898), plus a [`GroupVersion::with_kind`](https://docs.rs/kube/latest/kube/core/struct.GroupVersion.html#method.with_kind) path to a GVK, and a [`TryFrom<TypeMeta> for GroupVersionKind`](https://docs.rs/kube/latest/kube/core/struct.GroupVersionKind.html#impl-TryFrom%3CTypeMeta%3E) in [#896](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/896).\n\n### CRD Version Selection\nManaging multiple [version in CustomResourceDefinitions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definition-versioning/) can be pretty complicated, but we now have helpers and docs on how to tackle it.\n\nA new function [`kube::core::crd::merge_crds`](https://docs.rs/kube/latest/kube/core/crd/fn.merge_crds.html) have been added (in [#889](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/889)) to help push crd schemas generated by kube-derived crds with different `#[kube(version)]` properties. See the [kube-derive#version](https://docs.rs/kube/latest/kube/derive.CustomResource.html#versioning) documentation for details.\n\nA new example showcases [how one can manage two or more versions of a crd](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/blob/7715cabd4d1976493e6b8949471f283df927a79e/examples/crd_derive_multi.rs#L12-L31) and what the expected truncation outcomes are when moving between versions.\n\n### Examples\nExamples now have moved to `tracing` for its logging, respects `RUST_LOG`, and namespace selection via the kubeconfig context. There is also a [larger kubectl example](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/blob/main/examples/kubectl.rs) showcasing [`kubectl apply -f yaml`](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/blob/7715cabd4d1976493e6b8949471f283df927a79e/examples/kubectl.rs#L149-L170) as well as `kubectl {edit,delete,get,watch}` via [#885](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/885) + [#897](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/897).\n\n## What's Changed\n### Added\n* Allow merging multi-version CRDs into a single schema by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/889\n* Add GroupVersion::with_kind and TypeMeta -> GroupVersionKind converters by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/896\n* Add managed_fields accessors to ResourceExt by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/898\n* Add ResourceExt::creation_timestamp by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/888\n* Support lowercase http_proxy & https_proxy evars by @DevineLiu in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/892\n* Add a WatchStreamExt trait for stream chaining by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/899\n* Add Event::modify + reflector::store helpers by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/907\n### Changed\n* Switch to kubernetes cluster dns for incluster url everywhere by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/876\n* Update tower-http requirement from 0.2.0 to 0.3.2 by @dependabot in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/893\n### Removed\n* Remove deprecated legacy crd v1beta1 by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/890\n\n\n[0.71.0](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/releases/tag/0.71.0) / 2022-04-12\n===================\n\n## Highlights\nSeveral quality of life changes and improvement this release for port-forwarding, a new `ClientBuilder`, better handling of `kube-derive` edge-cases.\n\nWe highlight some **changes** here that you should be especially aware of.\n\n### [events::Recorder publishing to `kube-system` for cluster scoped resources](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/871)\nPublishing events via [Recorder](https://docs.rs/kube/latest/kube/runtime/events/struct.Recorder.html) for cluster scoped resources (supported since `0.70.0`) now publish to `kube-system` rather than `default`, as all but the newest clusters struggle with publishing events in the `default` namespace.\n\n### [Default TLS stack set to OpenSSL](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/863)\nThe previous `native-tls` default  was there because we used to depend on `reqwest`, but because we depended on openssl anyway the feature does not make much sense. Changing to `openssl-tls` also improves the situation on macOS where the Security Framework struggles with PKCS#12 certs from OpenSSL v3.  The `native-tls` feature will still be available in this release in case of issues, but the plan is to decommission it shortly. Of course, we all ideally want to move to rustls, but we are still blocked by [#153](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/153).\n\n## What's Changed\n### Added\n* Add `ClientBuilder` that lets users add custom middleware without full stack replacement by @teozkr in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/855\n* Support top-level enums in CRDs by @sbernauer in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/856\n### Changed\n* portforward: Improve API and support background task cancelation by @olix0r in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/854\n* Make remote commands cancellable and remove panics by @kazk in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/861\n* Change the default TLS to OpenSSL by @kazk in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/863\n* change event recorder cluster namespace to kube-system by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/871\n### Fixed\n* Fix schemas containing both properties and additionalProperties by @jcaesar in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/845\n* Make dependency pins between sibling crates stricter by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/864\n* Fix in-cluster kube_host_port generation for IPv6 by @somnusfish in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/875\n\n[0.70.0](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/releases/tag/0.70.0) / 2022-03-20\n===================\n## Highlights\n\n### [Support for EC keys with rustls](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/804)\n\nThis was one of the big blockers for using `rustls` against clusters like `k3d` or `k3s`\nWhile __not sufficient__ to fix using those clusters out of the box, it is now __possible__ to use them [with a workarodund](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/153)\n\n### [More ergonomic reconciler](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/851)\nThe signature and end the `Ok` action in `reconcile` fns has been simplified slightly, and requires the following user updates:\n\n```diff\n-async fn reconcile(obj: Arc<MyObject>, ctx: Context<Data>) -> Result<ReconcilerAction, Error> {\n-    ...\n-    Ok(ReconcilerAction {\n-        requeue_after: Some(Duration::from_secs(300)),\n-    })\n+async fn reconcile(obj: Arc<MyObject>, ctx: Context<Data>) -> Result<Action, Error> {\n+    ...\n+    Ok(Action::requeue(Duration::from_secs(300)))\n```\n\nThe `Action` import lives in the same place as the old `ReconcilerAction`.\n\n## What's Changed\n### Added\n* Add support for EC private keys by @farcaller in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/804\n* Add helper for creating a controller owner_ref on Resource by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/850\n### Changed\n* Remove `scheduler::Error` by @teozkr in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/827\n* Bump parking_lot to 0.12, but allow dep duplicates by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/836\n* Update tokio-tungstenite requirement from 0.16.1 to 0.17.1 by @dependabot in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/841\n* Let OccupiedEntry::commit take PostParams by @teozkr in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/842\n* Change ReconcileAction to Action and add associated ctors by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/851\n### Fixed\n* Token reloading with RwLock by @kazk in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/835\n* Fix event publishing for cluster scoped crds by @zhrebicek in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/847\n* Fix invalid CRD when Enum variants have descriptions by @sbernauer in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/852\n\n[0.69.1](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/releases/tag/0.69.1) / 2022-02-16\n===================\n## Highlights\n\nThis is an emergency patch release fixing a bug in 0.69.0 where a `kube::Client` would deadlock after running inside a cluster for about a minute (#829).\n\nAll users of 0.69.0 are encouraged to upgrade immediately. 0.68.x and below are not affected.\n\n<!-- Release notes generated using configuration in .github/release.yml at 0.69.1 -->\n\n## What's Changed\n### Fixed\n* [0.69.x] Fix deadlock in token reloading by @clux (backported by @teozkr) in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/831\n\n[0.69.0](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/releases/tag/0.69.0) / 2022-02-14\n===================\n## Highlights\n### Ergonomic Additions to Api\n\nTwo new methods have been added to the client `Api` this release to reduce the amount of boiler-plate needed for common patterns.\n\n- [`Api::entry`](https://docs.rs/kube/latest/kube/struct.Api.html#method.entry) via [811](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/811) - to aid idempotent crud operation flows (following the style of [`Map::Entry`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.BTreeMap.html#method.entry))\n- [`Api::get_opt`](https://docs.rs/kube/latest/kube/struct.Api.html#method.get_opt) via [809](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/809) - to aid dealing with the `NotFound` type error via a returned `Option`\n\n### [In-cluster Token reloading](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/768)\n\nFollowing a requirement for Kubernetes clients against versions `>= 1.22.0`, our bundled [`AuthLayer`](https://docs.rs/kube/0.69.0/kube/client/middleware/struct.AuthLayer.html) will reload tokens every minute when deployed in-cluster.\n\n<!-- Release notes generated using configuration in .github/release.yml at 0.69.0 -->\n\n## What's Changed\n### Added\n* Add conversion for `ObjectRef<K>` to `ObjectReference` by @teozkr in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/815\n* Add `Api::get_opt` for better existence handling by @teozkr in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/809\n* Entry API by @teozkr in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/811\n### Changed\n* Reload token file at least once a minute by @kazk in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/768\n* Prefer kubeconfig over in-cluster config by @teozkr in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/823\n### Fixed\n* Disable CSR utilities on K8s <1.19 by @teozkr in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/817\n\n[0.68.0](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/releases/tag/0.68.0) / 2022-02-01\n===================\n\n### Interface Changes\n\nTo reduce the amount of allocation done inside the `runtime` by reflectors and controllers, the following change via [#786](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/786) is needed on the signature of your `reconcile` functions:\n\n```diff\n-async fn reconcile(myobj: MyK, ctx: Context<Data>) -> Result<ReconcilerAction>\n+async fn reconcile(myobj: Arc<MyK>, ctx: Context<Data>) -> Result<ReconcilerAction>\n```\n\nThis also affects the [finalizer helper](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/792).\n\n### [Port-forwarding](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/446)\n\nAs one of the last steps toward [gold level client requirements](https://github.com/kubernetes/design-proposals-archive/blob/main/api-machinery/csi-new-client-library-procedure.md#client-capabilities), port-forwarding landed in [#446](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/446). There are 3 new [examples](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/tree/main/examples) (`port_forward*.rs`) that showcases how to use this websocket based functionality.\n\n## [What's Changed](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/releases/tag/0.68.0)\n### Added\n* Add a VS Code devcontainer configuration by @olix0r in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/788\n* Add support for user impersonation by @teozkr in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/797\n* Add port forward by @kazk in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/446\n### Changed\n* runtime: Store resources in an `Arc` by @olix0r in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/786\n* Propagate Arc through the finalizer reconciler helper by @teozkr in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/792\n* Disable unused default features of chrono crate by @dreamer in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/801\n### Fixed\n* Use absolute path to Result in derives by @teozkr in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/795\n* core: add missing reason to Display on Error::Validation in Request by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/798\n\n[0.67.0](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/releases/tag/0.67.0) / 2022-01-25\n===================\n### Changed\n\n* runtime: Replace `DashMap` with a locked `AHashMap` by @olix0r in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/785\n* update k8s-openapi for kubernetes 1.23 support by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/789\n\n[0.66.0](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/releases/tag/0.66.0) / 2022-01-15\n===================\n\nTons of ergonomics improvements, and 3 new contributors.\nHighlighted first is the 3 **most discussed** changes:\n\n### [Support for auto-generating schemas for enums in `kube-derive`](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/779)\n\nIt is now possible to **embed complex enums** inside structs that use `#[derive(CustomResource)]`.\n\nThis has been a [highly requested feature](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/648) since the inception of auto-generated schemas. It does [not work for all cases](https://docs.rs/kube/latest/kube/derive.CustomResource.html#enums), and has [certain ergonomics caveats](https://docs.rs/kube/0.66.0/kube/core/schema/struct.StructuralSchemaRewriter.html#method.visit_schema_object), but represents a huge step forwards.\n\nNote that **if** you depend on `kube-derive` directly rather than via `kube` then you **must** now add the `schema` feature to `kube-core`\n\n### [New `StreamBackoff` mechanism in `kube-runtime`](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/703)\n\nTo avoid spamming the apiserver when on certain watch errors cases, it's now possible to [stream wrap](https://docs.rs/kube/0.66.0/kube/runtime/utils/struct.StreamBackoff.html) the `watcher` to set backoffs. The new [`default_backoff`](https://docs.rs/kube/0.66.0/kube/runtime/watcher/fn.default_backoff.html) follows existing `client-go` conventions of being kind to the apiserver.\n\nInitially, this is **default-enabled** in `Controller` watches (configurable via [`Controller::trigger_backoff`](https://docs.rs/kube/latest/kube/runtime/struct.Controller.html#method.trigger_backoff)) and avoids spam errors when crds are not installed.\n\n### [New version priority parser in `kube-core`](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/764)\n\nTo aid users picking the most appropriate version of a `kind` from [api discovery](https://docs.rs/kube/0.66.0/kube/discovery/index.html) or [through a CRD](https://github.com/kube-rs/kopium/), two new sort orders have been exposed on the new [`kube_core::Version`](https://docs.rs/kube/latest/kube/core/enum.Version.html)\n\n- [`Version::priority`](https://docs.rs/kube/0.66.0/kube/core/enum.Version.html#method.priority) implementing [kubernetes version priority](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definition-versioning/#version-priority)\n- [`Version::generation`](https://docs.rs/kube/0.66.0/kube/core/enum.Version.html#method.generation) implementing a more traditional; generational sort (highest version)\n\n## Changes\nMerged PRs from [github release](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/releases/tag/0.66.0).\n### Added\n* Add `DeleteParams` constructors for easily setting `PropagationPolicy` by @kate-goldenring in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/757\n* Add Serialize to ObjecList and add field-selector and jsonpath example by @ChinYing-Li in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/760\n* Implement cordon/uncordon for Node by @ChinYing-Li in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/762\n* Export Version priority parser with Ord impls in kube_core by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/764\n* Add Api fns for arbitrary subresources and approval subresource for CertificateSigningRequest by @ChinYing-Li in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/773\n\n### Changed\n* Add backoff handling for watcher and Controller by @clux in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/703\n* Remove crate private `identity_pem` field from `Config` by @kazk in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/771\n* Use SecretString in AuthInfo to avoid credential leaking by @ChinYing-Li in https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/766\n\n[0.65.0](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/releases/tag/0.65.0) / 2021-12-10\n===================\n\n * BREAKING: Removed `kube::Error::OpenSslError` - [#716](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/716)\n * BREAKING: Removed `kube::Error::SslError` - [#704](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/704) and [#716](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/716)\n * BREAKING: Added `kube::Error::NativeTls(kube::client::NativeTlsError)` for errors from Native TLS - [#716](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/716)\n * BREAKING: Added `kube::Error::RustlsTls(kube::client::RustlsTlsError)` for errors from Rustls TLS - [#704](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/704)\n * Modified `Kubeconfig` parsing - allow empty kubeconfigs as per kubectl - [#721](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/721)\n * Added `Kubeconfig::from_yaml` - [#718](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/718) via [#719](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/719)\n * Updated `rustls` to 0.20.1 - [#704](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/704)\n * BREAKING: Added `ObjectRef` to the object that failed to be reconciled to `kube::runtime::controller::Error::ReconcileFailed` - [#733](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/733)\n * BREAKING: Removed `api_version` and `kind` fields from `kind` structs generated by `kube::CustomResource` - [#739](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/739)\n * Updated `tokio-tungstenite` to 0.16 - [#750](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/750)\n * Updated `tower-http` to 0.2.0 - [#748](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/748)\n * BREAKING: `kube-client`: replace `RefreshTokenLayer` with `AsyncFilterLayer` in `AuthLayer` - [#752](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/752)\n\n[0.64.0](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/releases/tag/0.64.0) / 2021-11-16\n===================\n\n * BREAKING: Replaced feature `kube-derive/schema` with attribute `#[kube(schema)]` - [#690](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/690)\n   - If you currently disable default `kube-derive` default features to avoid automatic schema generation, add `#[kube(schema = \"disabled\")]` to your spec struct instead\n * BREAKING: Moved `CustomResource` derive crate overrides into subattribute `#[kube(crates(...))]` - [#690](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/690)\n   - Replace `#[kube(kube_core = .., k8s_openapi = .., schema = .., serde = .., serde_json = ..)]` with `#[kube(crates(kube_core = .., k8s_openapi = .., schema = .., serde = .., serde_json = ..))]`\n * Added `openssl-tls` feature to use `openssl` for TLS on all platforms. Note that, even though `native-tls` uses a platform specific TLS, `kube` requires `openssl` on all platforms because `native-tls` only allows PKCS12 input to load certificates and private key at the moment, and creating PKCS12 requires `openssl`. - [#700](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/700)\n * BREAKING: Changed to fail loading configurations with PEM-encoded certificates containing invalid sections instead of ignoring them. Updated `pem` to 1.0.1. - [#702](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/702)\n * `oauth`: Updated `tame-oauth` to [0.6.0](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/tame-oauth/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#060---2021-08-07) which supports the same default credentials flow as the Go `oauth2` for Google OAuth. In addition to reading the service account information from JSON file specified with `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable, [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/application-default) from `gcloud`, and obtaining OAuth tokens from local metadata server when running inside GCP are now supported. - [#701](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/701)\n\n### Refining Errors\n\nWe started working on improving error ergonomics. See the tracking issue [#688](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/688) for more details.\n\nThe following is the summary of changes to `kube::Error` included in this release:\n\n* Added `Error::Auth(kube::client::AuthError)` (errors related to client auth, some of them were previously in `Error::Kubeconfig`)\n* Added `Error::BuildRequest(kube::core::request::Error)` (errors building request from `kube::core`)\n* Added `Error::InferConfig(kube::config::InferConfigError)` (for `Client::try_default`)\n* Added `Error::OpensslTls(kube::client::OpensslTlsError)` (new `openssl-tls` feature) - [#700](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/700)\n* Added `Error::UpgradeConnection(kube::client::UpgradeConnectinError)` (`ws` feature, errors from upgrading a connection)\n* Removed `Error::Connection` (was unused)\n* Removed `Error::RequestBuild` (was unused)\n* Removed `Error::RequestSend` (was unused)\n* Removed `Error::RequestParse` (was unused)\n* Removed `Error::InvalidUri` (replaced by variants of errors in `kube::config` errors)\n* Removed `Error::RequestValidation` (replaced by a variant of `Error::BuildRequest`)\n* Removed `Error::Kubeconfig` (replaced by `Error::InferConfig`, and `Error::Auth`)\n* Removed `Error::ProtocolSwitch` (`ws` only, replaced by `Error::UpgradeConnection`)\n* Removed `Error::MissingUpgradeWebSocketHeader` (`ws` only, replaced by `Error::UpgradeConnection`)\n* Removed `Error::MissingConnectionUpgradeHeader` (`ws` only, replaced by `Error::UpgradeConnection`)\n* Removed `Error::SecWebSocketAcceptKeyMismatch` (`ws` only, replaced by `Error::UpgradeConnection`)\n* Removed `Error::SecWebSocketProtocolMismatch` (`ws` only, replaced by `Error::UpgradeConnection`)\n* Removed `impl From<T> for Error`\n\n<details>\n<summary>Expand for more details</summary>\n\nThe following breaking changes were made as a part of an effort to refine errors (the list is large, but most of them are lower level, and shouldn't require much change in most cases):\n\n* Removed `impl From<E> for kube::Error` - [#686](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/686)\n* Removed unused error variants in `kube::Error`: `Connection`, `RequestBuild`, `RequestSend`, `RequestParse` - [#689](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/689)\n* Removed unused error variant `kube::error::ConfigError::LoadConfigFile` - [#689](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/689)\n* Changed `kube::Error::RequestValidation(String)` to `kube::Error::BuildRequest(kube::core::request::Error)`. Includes possible errors from building an HTTP request, and contains some errors from `kube::core` that was previously grouped under `kube::Error::SerdeError` and `kube::Error::HttpError`. `kube::core::request::Error` is described below. - [#686](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/686)\n* Removed `kube::core::Error` and `kube::core::Result`. `kube::core::Error` was replaced by more specific errors. - [#686](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/686)\n  - Replaced `kube::core::Error::InvalidGroupVersion` with `kube::core::gvk::ParseGroupVersionError`\n  - Changed the error returned from `kube::core::admission::AdmissionRequest::with_patch` to `kube::core::admission::SerializePatchError` (was `kube::core::Error::SerdeError`)\n  - Changed the error associated with `TryInto<AdmissionRequest<T>>` to `kube::core::admission::ConvertAdmissionReviewError` (was `kube::core::Error::RequestValidation`)\n  - Changed the error returned from methods of `kube::core::Request` to `kube::core::request::Error` (was `kube::core::Error`). `kube::core::request::Error` represents possible errors when building an HTTP request. The removed `kube::core::Error` had `RequestValidation(String)`, `SerdeError(serde_json::Error)`, and `HttpError(http::Error)` variants. They are now `Validation(String)`, `SerializeBody(serde_json::Error)`, and  `BuildRequest(http::Error)` respectively in `kube::core::request::Error`.\n* Changed variants of error enums in `kube::runtime` to tuples. Replaced `snafu` with `thiserror`. - [#686](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/686)\n* Removed `kube::error::ConfigError` and `kube::Error::Kubeconfig(ConfigError)` - [#696](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/696)\n  - Error variants related to client auth were moved to a new error `kube::client::AuthError` as described below\n  - Remaining variants were split into `kube::config::{InferConfigError, InClusterError, KubeconfigError}` as described below\n* Added `kube::client::AuthError` by extracting error variants related to client auth from `kube::ConfigError` and adding more variants to preserve context - [#696](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/696)\n* Moved `kube::error::OAuthError` to `kube::client::OAuthError` - [#696](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/696)\n* Changed all errors in `kube::client::auth` to `kube::client::AuthError` - [#696](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/696)\n* Added `kube::Error::Auth(kube::client::AuthError)` - [#696](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/696)\n* Added `kube::config::InferConfigError` which is an error from `Config::infer()` and `kube::Error::InferConfig(kube::config::InferConfigError)` - [#696](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/696)\n* Added `kube::config::InClusterError` for errors related to loading in-cluster configuration by splitting `kube::ConfigError` and adding more variants to preserve context. - [#696](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/696)\n* Added `kube::config::KubeconfigError` for errors related to loading kubeconfig by splitting `kube::ConfigError` and adding more variants to preserve context. - [#696](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/696)\n* Changed methods of `kube::Config` to return these erorrs instead of `kube::Error` - [#696](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/696)\n* Removed `kube::Error::InvalidUri` which was replaced by error variants preserving context, such as `KubeconfigError::ParseProxyUrl` - [#696](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/696)\n* Moved all errors from upgrading to a WebSocket connection into `kube::Error::UpgradeConnection(kube::client::UpgradeConnectionError)` - [#696](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/696)\n\n</details>\n\n[0.63.2](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/releases/tag/0.63.2) / 2021-10-28\n===================\n* `kube::runtime::events`: fix build and hide module on kubernetes < 1.19 (events/v1 missing there) -

This includes methods to configure TLS connection when building a custom client [#539](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/539)\n  - `native-tls`: `Config::native_tls_https_connector` and `Config::native_tls_connector`\n  - `rustls-tls`: `Config::rustls_https_connector` and `Config::rustls_client_config`\n- Remove the requirement of having `native-tls` or `rustls-tls` enabled when `client` is enabled. Allow one, both or none.\n  - When both, the default Service will use `native-tls` because of [#153](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/153). `rustls` can be still used with a custom client. Users will have an option to configure TLS at runtime.\n  - When none, HTTP connector is used.\n- Remove TLS features from `kube-runtime`\n  - **BREAKING**: Features must be removed if specified\n- Remove `client` feature from `native-tls` and `rust-tls` features\n  - `config` + `native-tls`/`rustls-tls` can be used independently, e.g., to create a simple HTTP client\n  - **BREAKING**: `client` feature must be added if `default-features = false`\n\n### Layers\n- `ConfigExt::base_uri_layer` (`BaseUriLayer`) to set cluster URL (#539)\n- `ConfigExt::auth_layer` that returns optional layer to manage `Authorization` header (#539)\n- `gzip`: Replaced custom decompression module with [`DecompressionLayer`](https://docs.rs/tower-http/0.1.0/tower_http/decompression/index.html) from `tower-http` (#539)\n- Replaced custom `LogRequest` with [`TraceLayer`](https://docs.rs/tower-http/0.1.0/tower_http/trace/index.html) from `tower-http` (#539)\n  - Request body is no longer shown\n- Basic and Bearer authentication using `AddAuthorizationLayer` (borrowing from https://github.com/tower-rs/tower-http/pull/95 until released)\n- **BREAKING**: Remove `headers` from `Config`. Injecting arbitrary headers is now done with a layer on a custom client.\n\n### Dependency Changes\n\n- Remove `static_assertions` since it's no longer used\n- Replace `tokio_rustls` with `rustls` and `webpki` since we're not using `tokio_rustls` directly\n- Replace uses of `rustls::internal::pemfile` with `rustls-pemfile`\n- Remove `url` and always use `http::Uri`\n  - **BREAKING**: `Config::cluster_url` is now `http::Uri`\n  - **BREAKING**: `Error::InternalUrlError(url::ParseError)` and `Error::MalformedUrl(url::ParseError)` replaced by `Error::InvalidUri(http::uri::InvalidUri)`\n\n\n0.55.0 / 2021-05-21\n===================\n * `kube`: `client` feature added (default-enabled) -

The trait now takes an optional associated type for runtime type info: `DynamicType` [#385](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/385)\n   - `Api::all_with` + `Api::namespaced_with` added for querying with dynamic families\n   - see `dynamic_watcher` + `dynamic_api` for example usage\n * `kube-runtime`: BREAKING: lower level interface changes as a result of `kube::api::Meta` trait:\n  - THESE SHOULD NOT AFFECT YOU UNLESS YOU ARE IMPLEMENTING / CUSTOMISING LOW LEVEL TYPES DIRECTLY\n  -

Most are to low level internal interfaces and should not change much, but some changes you might need to make:\n\n#### kube\n- if using the old, low-level `kube::api::Resource`, please consider the easier `kube::Api`, or look at tests in `request.rs` or `typed.rs` if you need the low level interface\n- search replace `kube::api::Meta` with `kube::Resource` if used - trait was renamed\n- if implementing the trait, add `type DynamicType = ();` to the impl\n- remove calls to `ListParams::allow_bookmarks` (allow default)\n- handle `WatchEvent::Bookmark` or set `ListParams::disable_bookmarks()`\n- look at examples if replacing the long deprecated legacy runtime\n\n#### kube-derive\nThe following constants from `k8s_openapi::Resource` no longer exist. Please `use kube::Resource` and:\n- replace `Foo::KIND` with `Foo::kind(&())`\n- replace `Foo::GROUP` with `Foo::group(&())`\n- replace `Foo::VERSION` with `Foo::version(&())`\n- replace `Foo::API_VERSION` with `Foo::api_version(&())`\n\n0.51.0 / 2021-02-28\n===================\n * `kube` `Config` now allows arbirary extension objects - [#425](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/425)\n * `kube` `Config` now allows multiple yaml documents per kubeconfig - [#440](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/440) via [#441](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/441)\n * `kube-derive` now more robust and is using `darling` - [#435](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/435)\n * docs improvements to patch + runtime\n\n0.50.1 / 2021-02-17\n===================\n * bug: fix oidc auth provider - [#424](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/424) via [#419](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/419)\n\n0.50.0 / 2021-02-10\n===================\n * feat: added support for stacked kubeconfigs - [#132](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/132) via [#411](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/411)\n * refactor: authentication logic moved out of `kube::config` and into into `kube::service` - [#409](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/409)\n  - BREAKING: `Config::get_auth_header` removed\n * refactor: remove `hyper` dependency from `kube::api` - [#410](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/410)\n * refactor: `kube::Service` simpler auth and gzip handling - [#405](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/405) + [#408](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/408)\n\n0.49.0 / 2021-02-08\n===================\n * dependency on `reqwest` + removed in favour of `hyper` + `tower` [#394](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/pull/394)\n   - refactor: `kube::Client` now uses `kube::Service` (a `tower::Service<http::Request<hyper::Body>>`) instead of `reqwest::Client` to handle all requests\n   - refactor: `kube::Client` now uses a `tokio_util::codec` for internal buffering\n   - refactor: `async-tungstenite` ws feature dependency replaced with `tokio-tungstenite`. `WebSocketStream` is now created from a connection upgraded with `hyper`\n   - refactor: `oauth2` module for GCP OAuth replaced with optional `tame-oauth` dependency\n   - BREAKING: GCP OAuth is now opt-in (`oauth` feature).

          "content": "# Contributing Guide\n\nThis document describes the requirements for committing to this repository.\n\n## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)\n\nIn order to contribute to this project, you must sign each of your commits to attest that you have the right to contribute that code.\nThis is done with the `-s`/`--signoff` flag on `git commit`.\nMore information about `DCO` can be found [here](https://developercertificate.org/)\n\n## Pull Request Management\n\nAll code that is contributed to kube-rs must go through the Pull Request (PR) process.\nTo contribute a PR, fork this project, create a new branch, make changes on that branch, and then use GitHub to open a pull request with your changes.\n\nEvery PR must be reviewed by at least one [Maintainer](https://kube.rs/maintainers/) of the project.\nOnce a PR has been marked \"Approved\" by a Maintainer (and no other Maintainer has an open \"Rejected\" vote), the PR may be merged.\nWhile it is fine for non-maintainers to contribute their own code reviews, those reviews do not satisfy the above requirement.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nThis project has adopted the [CNCF Code of\nConduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).\n\n## Rust Guidelines\n\n- **Channel**: Code is built and tested using the **stable** channel of Rust, but documented and formatted with **nightly** <sup>[*](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/707)</sup>\n- **Formatting**: To format the codebase, run `just fmt`\n- **Documentation** To check documentation, run `just doc`\n- **Testing**: To run tests, run `just test` and see below.\n\nFor a list of tooling that we glue together everything see [TOOLS.md](https://kube.rs/tools/).\n\n## Testing\n\nWe have 3 classes of tests.\n\n- Unit tests & Documentation Tests\n- Integration tests (requires Kubernetes)\n- End to End tests (requires Kubernetes)\n\nThe last two will try to access the Kubernetes cluster that is your `current-context`; i.e. via your local `KUBECONFIG` evar or `~/.kube/config` file.\n\nThe easiest way set up a minimal Kubernetes cluster for these is with [`k3d`](https://k3d.io/) (`just k3d`).\n\n### Unit Tests & Documentation Tests\n\nUnit and doc tests are run against a particular crate with `cargo test -p KUBECRATE --lib --doc`, but because of feature-sets, you will need a couple of extra flags and invocations to replicate all our CI conditions.\n\nTo run **all** unit tests, call: `just test`\n\nAll public interfaces must be documented, and most should have minor documentation examples to show usage.\n\n### Integration Tests\n\nSlower set of tests within the crates marked with an **`#[ignore]`** attribute.\n\n:warning: These  **WILL** try to modify resources in your current cluster :warning:\n\nIntegration tests are run against a crate with `cargo test -p KUBECRATE --lib -- --ignored`, but because of feature-sets, you will need a few invocations of these to replicate our CI.\n\nTo run **all** integration tests, call: `just test-integration`\n\n### End to End Tests\n\nWe have a small set of [e2e tests](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/tree/main/e2e) that tests difference between in-cluster and local configuration.\n\nThese tests are the heaviest tests we have because they require a full `docker build`, image import (or push/pull flow), yaml construction, and `kubectl` usage to verify that the outcome was sufficient.\n\nTo run E2E tests, use (or follow) `just e2e` as appropriate.\n\n### Test Guidelines\n\n#### When to add a test\n\nAll public interfaces should have doc tests with examples for [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/kube).\n\nWhen adding new non-trivial pieces of logic that results in a drop in coverage you should add a test.\n\nCross-reference with the coverage build [![coverage build](https://codecov.io/gh/kube-rs/kube/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=9FCqEcyDTZ)](https://app.codecov.io/gh/kube-rs/kube/tree/main) and go to your branch. Coverage can also be run locally with [`cargo tarpaulin`](https://github.com/xd009642/tarpaulin) at project root. This will use our [tarpaulin.toml](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/blob/main/tarpaulin.toml) config, and **will run both unit and integration** tests.\n\n#### What type of test\n\n- Unit tests **MUST NOT** try to contact a Kubernetes cluster\n- Doc tests **MUST** be marked as `no_run` when they need to contact a Kubernetes cluster\n- Integration tests **MUST NOT** be used when a unit test is sufficient\n- Integration tests **MUST NOT** assume existence of non-standard objects in the cluster\n- Integration tests **MUST NOT** cross-depend on other unit tests completing (and installing what you need)\n- E2E tests **MUST NOT** be used where an integration test is sufficient\n\nIn general: **use the least powerful method** of testing available to you:\n\n- use unit tests in `kube-core`\n- use unit tests in `kube-client` (and in rare cases integration tests)\n- use unit tests in `kube-runtime` (and occassionally integration tests)\n- use e2e tests when testing differences between in-cluster and local configuration\n\n## Support\n### Documentation\nThe [high-level architecture document](https://kube.rs/architecture/) is written for contributors.\n\n### Contact\nYou can ask general questions / share ideas / query the community at the [kube-rs discussions forum](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/discussions).\nYou can reach the maintainers of this project at [#kube](https://discord.gg/tokio) channel on the Tokio discord.\n"

Hosted by [CNCF](https://cncf.io/) as a [Sandbox Project](https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects/).\n\nThese crates build upon Kubernetes [apimachinery](https://github.com/kubernetes/apimachinery/blob/master/pkg/apis/meta/v1/types.go) + [api concepts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/) to enable generic abstractions. These abstractions allow Rust reinterpretations of reflectors, controllers, and custom resource interfaces, so that you can write applications easily.\n\n## Installation\n\nSelect a version of `kube` along with the generated [k8s-openapi](https://github.com/Arnavion/k8s-openapi) structs at your chosen [Kubernetes version](https://kube.rs/kubernetes-version/):\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nkube = { version = \"0.98.0\", features = [\"runtime\", \"derive\"] }\nk8s-openapi = { version = \"0.24.0\", features = [\"latest\"] }\n```\n\nSee [features](https://kube.rs/features/) for a quick overview of default-enabled / opt-in functionality.\n\n## Upgrading\n\nSee [kube.rs/upgrading](https://kube.rs/upgrading/).\nNoteworthy changes are highlighted in [releases](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/releases), and archived in the [changelog](https://kube.rs/changelog/).\n\n## Usage\n\nSee the **[examples directory](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/blob/main/examples)** for how to use any of these crates.\n\n- **[kube API Docs](https://docs.rs/kube/)**\n- **[kube.rs](https://kube.rs)**\n\nOfficial examples:\n\n- [version-rs](https://github.com/kube-rs/version-rs): lightweight deployment `reflector` using axum\n- [controller-rs](https://github.com/kube-rs/controller-rs): `Controller` of a crd inside actix\n\nFor real world projects see [ADOPTERS](https://kube.rs/adopters/).\n\n## Api\n\nThe [`Api`](https://docs.rs/kube/latest/kube/struct.Api.html) is what interacts with Kubernetes resources, and is generic over [`Resource`](https://docs.rs/kube/latest/kube/trait.Resource.html):\n\n```rust\nuse k8s_openapi::api::core::v1::Pod;\nlet pods: Api<Pod> = Api::default_namespaced(client);\n\nlet pod = pods.get(\"blog\").await?;\nprintln!(\"Got pod: {pod:?}\");\n\nlet patch = json!({\"spec\": {\n    \"activeDeadlineSeconds\": 5\n}});\nlet pp = PatchParams::apply(\"kube\");\nlet patched = pods.patch(\"blog\", &pp, &Patch::Apply(patch)).await?;\nassert_eq!(patched.spec.active_deadline_seconds, Some(5));\n\npods.delete(\"blog\", &DeleteParams::default()).await?;\n```\n\nSee the examples ending in `_api` examples for more detail.\n\n## Custom Resource Definitions\n\nWorking with custom resources uses automatic code-generation via [proc_macros in kube-derive](https://docs.rs/kube/latest/kube/derive.CustomResource.html).\n\nYou need to add `#[derive(CustomResource, JsonSchema)]` and some `#[kube(attrs..)]` on a __spec__ struct:\n\n```rust\n#[derive(CustomResource, Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, Default, Clone, JsonSchema)]\n#[kube(group = \"kube.rs\", version = \"v1\", kind = \"Document\", namespaced)]\npub struct DocumentSpec {\n    title: String,\n    content: String,\n}\n```\n\nThen you can use the generated wrapper struct `Document` as a [`kube::Resource`](https://docs.rs/kube/*/kube/trait.Resource.html):\n\n```rust\nlet docs: Api<Document> = Api::default_namespaced(client);\nlet d = Document::new(\"guide\", DocumentSpec::default());\nprintln!(\"doc: {:?}\", d);\nprintln!(\"crd: {:?}\", serde_yaml::to_string(&Document::crd()));\n```\n\nThere are a ton of kubebuilder-like instructions that you can annotate with here. See the [documentation](https://docs.rs/kube/latest/kube/derive.CustomResource.html) or the `crd_` prefixed [examples](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/blob/main/examples) for more.\n\n**NB:** `#[derive(CustomResource)]` requires the `derive` feature enabled on `kube`.\n\n## Runtime\n\nThe `runtime` module exports the `kube_runtime` crate and contains higher level abstractions on top of the `Api` and `Resource` types so that you don't have to do all the `watch`/`resourceVersion`/storage book-keeping yourself.\n\n### Watchers\n\nA streaming interface (similar to informers) that presents [`watcher::Event`](https://docs.rs/kube/latest/kube/runtime/watcher/enum.Event.html)s and does automatic relists under the hood.\n\n```rust\nlet api = Api::<Pod>::default_namespaced(client);\nlet stream = watcher(api, Config::default()).default_backoff().applied_objects();\n```\n\nThis now gives a continual stream of events and you do not need to care about the watch having to restart, or connections dropping.\n\n```rust\nwhile let Some(event) = stream.try_next().await? {\n    println!(\"Applied: {}\", event.name_any());\n}\n```\n\n\nNote the base items from a `watcher` stream are an abstraction above the native `WatchEvent` to allow for store buffering. If you are following along to \"see what changed\", you can use utilities from [`WatchStreamExt`](https://docs.rs/kube/latest/kube/runtime/trait.WatchStreamExt.html), such as `applied_objects` to get a more conventional stream.\n\n## Reflectors\n\nA `reflector` is a `watcher` with `Store` on `K`. It acts on all the `Event<K>` exposed by `watcher` to ensure that the state in the `Store` is as accurate as possible.\n\n```rust\nlet nodes: Api<Node> = Api::all(client);\nlet lp = Config::default().labels(\"kubernetes.io/arch=amd64\");\nlet (reader, writer) = reflector::store();\nlet rf = reflector(writer, watcher(nodes, lp));\n```\n\nAt this point you can listen to the `reflector` as if it was a `watcher`, but you can also query the `reader` at any point.\n\n### Controllers\n\nA `Controller` is a `reflector` along with an arbitrary number of watchers that schedule events internally to send events through a reconciler:\n\n```rust\nController::new(root_kind_api, Config::default())\n    .owns(child_kind_api, Config::default())\n    .run(reconcile, error_policy, context)\n    .for_each(|res| async move {\n        match res {\n            Ok(o) => info!(\"reconciled {:?}\", o),\n            Err(e) => warn!(\"reconcile failed: {}\", Report::from(e)),\n        }\n    })\n    .await;\n```\n\nHere `reconcile` and `error_policy` refer to functions you define. The first will be called when the root or child elements change, and the second when the `reconciler` returns an `Err`.\n\nSee the [controller guide](https://kube.rs/controllers/intro/) for how to write these.\n\n## TLS\n\nBy default [rustls](https://github.com/rustls/rustls) is used for TLS, but `openssl` is supported. To switch, turn off `default-features`, and enable the `openssl-tls` feature:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nkube = { version = \"0.98.0\", default-features = false, features = [\"client\", \"openssl-tls\"] }\nk8s-openapi = { version = \"0.24.0\", features = [\"latest\"] }\n```\n\nThis will pull in `openssl` and `hyper-openssl`. If `default-features` is left enabled, you will pull in two TLS stacks, and the default will remain as `rustls`.\n\n## musl-libc\n\nKube will work with [distroless](https://github.com/kube-rs/controller-rs/blob/main/Dockerfile), [scratch](https://github.com/constellation-rs/constellation/blob/27dc89d0d0e34896fd37d638692e7dfe60a904fc/Dockerfile), and `alpine` (it's also possible to use alpine as a builder [with some caveats](https://github.com/kube-rs/kube/issues/331#issuecomment-715962188)).\n\n## License\n\nApache 2.0 licensed.

However, when a vulnerability is found during a code audit, or when several other issues are likely to be spotted and fixed in the near future, the security team may delay the release of a Security Advisory, so that one unique, comprehensive Security Advisory covering several vulnerabilities can be issued.\nCommunication with vendors and other distributions shipping the same code may also cause these delays.\n"
