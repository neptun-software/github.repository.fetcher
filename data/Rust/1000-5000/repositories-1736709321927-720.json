For details, visit https://cla.microsoft.com.\n\nWhen you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repos using our CLA.\n\nThis project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).

Access to a Kubernetes cluster.\n2. Clone this repository. \n\n### Quickstart: Use the prepackaged container with VSCode \n\nIf you have Docker and VS Code installed on your device, you can use the VS Code <b>Remote - Containers</b> extension to develop inside a container that contains all of the build dependencies.  To do this:\n\n- Install the VS Code <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers\">Remote - Containers</a> extension\n- Open the root folder of the repository in VS Code\n- Run the `Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...` command in VS Code (a pop-up should also appear offering to open the folder in a container)\n\nThis will download the Development Environment container from Docker Hub and configure VS Code to run all commands and Terminals inside the container.  To build Rudr, launch a new Bash Termial in VS Code and run `cargo build` from the rudr directory.  \n\n### Manually install the bits on your machine\n\n- [Rust 2018 Edition or newer](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)\n- Install kubectl and Helm 3. Instructions for both are in the [set up doc](./docs/setup/install.md)\n\n## Build from source \n\nTo build:\n\n- Go into the main directory: `cd rudr`\n- Install the CRDs\n```bash\nkubectl apply -f charts/rudr/crds/appconfigs.yaml\nkubectl apply -f charts/rudr/crds/componentinstances.yaml\nkubectl apply -f charts/rudr/crds/componentschematics.yaml\nkubectl apply -f charts/rudr/crds/scopes.yaml\nkubectl apply -f charts/rudr/crds/traits.yaml\n```\n- Run `cargo build`\n- To run the server: `make run`, this will run Rudr controller locally, and use the cluster by your `~/.kube/config`.\n\nAt this point, you will be running a local controller attached to the cluster to which your `$KUBECONFIG` is pointing.\n\nTo get started, define some _components_. Components are not instantiated. They are descriptions of what things can run in your cluster.\n\n```console\n$ kubectl apply -f examples/helloworld-python-component.yaml\ncomponent.core.oam.dev \"helloworld-python-v1\" created\n$ kubectl get components\nNAME                         AGE\nhelloworld-python-v1         14m\n```\n\nNext, create a new application that uses the component. In Open Application Model, which follows the 12-factor model, the application is composed of code (component) and a config. So you need to write a configuration. Examples are provided in the `examples/` directory:\n\n```console\n$ kubectl apply -f examples/first-app-config.yaml\n```\n\nNow you may wish to explore your cluster to see what was created:\n\n```console\n$ kubectl get configuration,pod,svc,ingress\nNAME                                              AGE\napplicationconfiguration.core.oam.dev/first-app   14s\n\nNAME                                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\npod/first-app-helloworld-python-v1-67599b9877-lh9dr   1/1     Running   0          8s\n\nNAME                                     TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE\nservice/first-app-helloworld-python-v1   ClusterIP   10.104.147.6   <none>        9999/TCP   8s\n\nNAME                                                              HOSTS         ADDRESS   PORTS   AGE\ningress.extensions/first-app-helloworld-python-v1-trait-ingress   example.com             80      8s\n```\n\nTo delete this, run `kubectl delete configuration first-app` and it will cascade and delete all of the pieces.\n\n## Contributing via pull requests\n\nLike any good open source project, we use Pull Requests (PRs) to track code changes. Please familiarize yourself with the **Status** labels on the [labels](https://github.com/microsoft/rudr/labels) page. \n\n1. Fork the repo, modify to address the issue.\n2. Link the PR to the issue. \n3. Submit a pull request.\n\n### PR Lifecycle\n\n1. PR creation\n    - We more than welcome PRs that are currently in progress. They are a great way to keep track of\n    important work that is in-flight, but useful for others to see. If a PR is a work in progress,\n    it **should** be prefaced with \"WIP: [title]\" and add `Status: In Progress` will be added as a label. You should add the `Status: Review Needed` **label** once the PR is ready for review and remove \"WIP\" from the title.\n    - It is preferred, but not required, to have a PR tied to a specific issue. There can be\n    circumstances where if it is a quick fix then an issue might be overkill. The details provided\n    in the PR description would suffice in this case.\n2. Triage\n    - The maintainer in charge of triaging will apply the proper labels for the issue. This should\n    include at least a status label and a milestone.\n3. Assigning reviews\n    - All PRs require 1 review approval from a maintainer before being merged. \n4. Reviewing/Discussion\n    - All reviews will be completed using Github review tool.\n    - A \"Comment\" review should be used when there are questions about Rudr. This type of review does not count as approval.\n    - A \"Changes Requested\" review indicates that changes need to be made before they will be\n    merged.\n    - Reviewers should update labels as needed (such as `Status: Needs rebase`).\n    - When a review is approved, the reviewer should add `LGTM` as a comment. \n    - Final approval is required by a designated owner (see `.github/CODEOWNERS` file). Merging is blocked without this final approval. Approvers will factor reviews from all other reviewers into their approval process.\n5. PR owner should try to be responsive to comments by answering questions or changing text. Once all comments have been addressed,\n   the PR is ready to be merged. When it gets merged, the `Status: Completed` will be added signifying that it is in the next release candidate. \n6. Merge or close\n    - A PR should stay open until a Final Approver (see above) has marked the PR approved\n    - PRs can be closed by the author without merging\n    - PRs may be closed by a Final Approver if the decision is made that the PR is not going to be merged \n\n## Contributing via Issues\n\nThere are more ways to contribute to open source projects than pull requests. We implore users to open issues with any suggestions or problems discovered. Issues are used as the primary method for tracking work in the milestones on the project.\n\n### Issue Types\n\nTo learn about issue types, please read the [labels](https://github.com/microsoft/rudr/labels) page. \n\n### Issue Lifecycle\n\nThe issue lifecycle is mainly driven by the core maintainers, but is good information for those\ncontributing to Rudr. All issue types follow the same general lifecycle.\n\n1. Issue creation. \n2. Triage\n    - The maintainer in charge of triaging will apply the proper labels for the issue. This\n    includes labels for type, projects/milestones and metadata.\n    - (If needed) Clean up the title to succinctly and clearly state the issue. Also ensure\n    that proposals are prefaced with \"Proposal\".\n    - We attempt to do this process at least once per work day.\n3. Discussion\n    - Enhancement, bug and document issues should be connected to the PR that resolves it.\n    - Whoever is working on an issue should claim the issue in the comments.\n    - Issues should stay open until a maintainer closes it or the owner of the issue decides to close it. \n4. Issue closure.\n\n## Milestones and Triaging \n\n### Milestones\n\nTo get an overview of the milestones that are being tracked for Rudr please visit the [Milestones](https://github.com/oam-dev/spec/milestones) page. \n\n### Triaging \n\nEach day, someone from a Open Application Model related team should act as the triager. This person will be in charge triaging new PRs and issues throughout the day. Anyone can volunteer as the triager by posting on the Slack channel or volunteering in advance during our community calls. If no one has volunteered by 10:00 AM PST, someone from our team will triage. \n\nBroader discussion of any issues can be raised during the bi-weekly community call. Issues might be brought into milestones, removed from milestones or moved between milestones during the call."

          "content": "# Rudr: A Kubernetes Implementation of the Open Application Model\n\n![](https://github.com/oam-dev/rudr/workflows/Rust/badge.svg)\n\nRudr is an implementation of the [Open Application Model (OAM) 1.0.0-alpha1](https://github.com/oam-dev/spec/releases/tag/v1.0.0-alpha.1) for Kubernetes. \n\n***Note: Rudr is a reference implementation for the initial working draft of the OAM specification. It does not reflect the most recent version of the OAM specification.***\n\n## Why Rudr?\n\nKubernetes API resources focused on container infrastructure rather than the applications per se. Yet, application developers think in terms of application architecture, not of infrastructure.\n\n**Rudr provides application level primitives for Kubernetes that enable:**\n\n- The ability to define application (e.g., WordPress) in Kubernetes. \n- The ability to define operational capability (e.g., auto-scaling policy, rather than HPA) in Kubernetes.\n- A portable and self-descriptive application description which includes every dependency and operational ability the application requires to run.  \n- Building an application centric abstraction atop container infrastructure.\n\n**Rudr can be used by:**\n\n- Developers who want to describe application from developer's view, rather than learning low level primitives.\n- Operators who want to focus on strategies of operating the application, rather than infrastructure details.\n- Kubernetes engineers who want to define \"application\" in Kubernetes, or expose application level API to developers and operators, rather than full Kubernetes API.\n- PaaS engineers who want to build a serverless application platform atop Kubernetes, with minimal effort.\n- Software distributors who want to \"define once, deploy everywhere\", regardless of the differences of Kubernetes providers on multi-cloud.\n\n## Get started\n\nDefine and deploy a [helloworld-python](./docs/how-to/create_component_from_scratch.md) application with Rudr.\n\n## How does Rudr work?\n\n![rudr arch](./docs/media/rudr-how-it-works.png)\n\nRudr defines [OAM primitives](https://github.com/oam-dev/spec/blob/master/2.overview_and_terminology.md) as Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs). Hence, Rudr is able to provide OAM style application level APIs including [Components](./docs/concepts/component-schematic.md) for developers to define applications, and [Traits](./docs/concepts/traits.md) for operators to define operational capabilities. Meanwhile, infra operators still work on Kubernetes itself.\n\nRudr controllers will maintain the mapping between OAM CRDs (e.g., Component) and Kubernetes API resources (e.g., Deployment).\n\n## Try more things out yourself \n\nRead the [documentation list](./docs/README.md) for more options. Some highlights:\n- [Getting started tutorials](https://github.com/oam-dev/rudr/tree/master/docs#get-started)\n- [Learn Open Application Model concepts in Kubernetes](https://github.com/oam-dev/rudr/tree/master/docs#concepts)\n- [Learn advanced How-To topics](https://github.com/oam-dev/rudr/tree/master/docs#how-tos)\n  - For example, use Rudr with Helm and Kustmoize and migrate existing Kubernetes resources to Rudr.\n- [Install and play with more workload types](https://github.com/oam-dev/rudr/tree/master/docs#extended-workloads)\n- [Developing Rudr](https://github.com/oam-dev/rudr/tree/master/docs#extended-workloads)\n- [FAQ](https://github.com/oam-dev/rudr/blob/master/docs/faq.md)\n\n## More samples and demos\n\n- [OAM samples repository](https://github.com/oam-dev/samples)\n\n## Roadmap\n\nCurrently, Rudr relies on pre-installed workload types and traits to accomplish the task. In next release, Rudr will provide a plugin mechanism to integrate any Kubernetes Operator as workload type or operational capability. The goal is to allow users to assemble Operators ecosystem as a serverless application platform by \"one click\".\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis project welcomes contributions and suggestions.
