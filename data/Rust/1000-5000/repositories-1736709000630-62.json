          "content": "# Architecture of Hickory DNS\n\nThe Hickory DNS libraries are built from the ground up to be asynchronous. This project grew from first using non-blocking IO interfaces (before Futures 0.1 or async/await had landed in Rust). There are some artifacts of this history sporadically left around the project. Please feel free to submit PRs that clean up areas that still have hand-written Futures based state-machines. Additionally, much of the project was written by @bluejekyll while he learned the Rust language–this means that there may be patterns or missing common implementations in places where he didn't know better. Feel free to clean that up if you feel open to submitting a PR.\n\n## Layout\n\nMost of the project is in the form of crates. The crates are all individually published to crates.io.\n\nThe project has these high-level crates (to be used as dependencies in other projects):\n\n- **[hickory-resolver](crates/resolver)** - implements a stub-resolver with support for CNAME chasing and other things, abstract over runtimes (Tokio supported by default)\n- **[async-std-resolver](crates/async-std-resolver)** - an abstraction of hickory-resolver using the async-std runtime\n- **[hickory-client](crates/client)** - a bare-bones client crate, most useful for dynamic DNS updates\n- **[hickory-server](crates/server)** - implements support for hosted Authorities of various types\n- **tokio-resolver** - (under consideration, currently Tokio support is directly in hickory-resolver)\n\nLow-level crates supporting the above high-level crates:\n\n- **[hickory-proto](crates/proto)** - the lowest level crate, implements the basics of DNS\n\nBinaries:\n\n- **[hickory-dns](bin/)** - server binary, `hickory-dns`, for hosting authorities, zones, and/or setting up a forwarder\n- **[hickory-util](util/)** - helpful utilities, e.g. `resolve` for a CLI resolver, as well as some DNSSEC utilities\n\nOld and Outdated crates:\n\n- **[trust-dns-*](https://github.com/bluejekyll/trust-dns/tree/v0.23.1/)** - removed in favor of features in hickory-proto, crate in [v0.24.0](https://github.com/hickory-dns/hickory-dns/tree/v0.24.0)\n- **[trust-dns-rustls](https://github.com/bluejekyll/trust-dns/tree/v0.21.0/crates/rustls)** - removed in favor of features in hickory-proto, crate in [v0.21.0](https://github.com/hickory-dns/hickory-dns/tree/v0.21.0)\n- **[trust-dns-openssl](https://github.com/bluejekyll/trust-dns/tree/v0.21.0/crates/openssl)** - removed in favor of features in hickory-proto, crate in [v0.21.0](https://github.com/hickory-dns/trust-dns/tree/v0.21.0)\n- **[trust-dns-native-tls](https://github.com/bluejekyll/trust-dns/tree/v0.21.0/crates/native-tls)** - removed in favor of features in hickory-proto, crate in [v0.21.0](https://github.com/hickory-dns/trust-dns/tree/v0.21.0)\n- **[trust-dns-https](https://github.com/bluejekyll/trust-dns/tree/v0.21.0/crates/https)** - removed in favor of features in hickory-proto, crate in [v0.21.0](https://github.com/hickory-dns/trust-dns/tree/v0.21.0)\n\n## TBD\n\nMore on general patterns used in each library\n"

          "content": "# Contributing to Hickory DNS\n\nBefore contributing, please consider the terms of the licenses (Apache License 2.0 or MIT). We chose these licenses for two reasons:\n\n- To be more compatible with the general Rust ecosystem\n- So that this software can be liberally used with few restrictions\n\nAfter ensuring the license options are compatible with the aims of the contribution, then please submit your PR for review and we will review as soon as possible. My only ask is that you do not do this for free, unless it's something that is a passion or learning project for you. Please, find a way to be paid for your work. You are worth it.\n\n## Understanding the design\n\nPlease read the [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) to understand the general design and layout of the Hickory DNS projects.\n\n## Submitting PRs\n\nBefore submitting a PR it would be good to discuss the change in an issue so as to avoid wasted work, also feel free to reach out on the Discord channel listed on the front page of the GitHub project. Please, consider keep PRs focused on one issue at a time. While issues are not required for a PR to be accepted they are encouraged, especially for anything that would change behavior, change an API, or be a medium to large change.\n\nWhen submitting PRs please keep refactoring commits separate from functional change commits. Breaking up the PR into multiple commits such that a reviewer can follow the change improves the review experience. This is not necessary, but can make it easier for a reviewer to follow the changes and will result in PRs getting merged more quickly.\n\n### Test policy\n\nAll PRs *must* be passing all tests. Ideally any PR submitted should have more than 85% code coverage, but this is not mandated. When tests are failing, especially on previous branches this is often due to checked in testing keys for the DoH and DoT tests. See **Updating Security Related Tests**.\n\n## Releases\n\nHickory DNS tries to follow semver versioning semantics. Major versions will not break APIs in a current major revision. If changes are being made to the current `main` branch, double check the current status of the Major release. Until `1.x.x`, all `0.x.x` minor releases are treated as major releases with breaking changes allowed. Releases are performed on an ad-hoc/on-demand basis.\n\n*Maintainers*: If changes are needed to previous releases, then there should exist a `release/x.x`. If this does not exist, then go to the previous most recent tag (release) and create a new branch at that tag `release/x.x`, for example the branch `release/0.19`:\n\n```shell\n> git fetch origin\n> git checkout v0.19\n> git branch release/0.19\n> git push --set-upstream origin release/0.19\n```\n\nPrevious release can fail due to time-lapse, please see **Updating Security Related Tests**.\n\n## Performing a Release, for Maintainers\n\nReleases are somewhat automated. The github action, `publish`, watches for any tags on the project. It then attempts to perform a release of all the libraries, this does not always work, for various reasons.\n\n1. Create a new branch like `git checkout -b prepare-0.20.1`\n1. Update all Cargo.toml files to the new version, `version = 0.20.1`\n1. Update dependencies, `cargo update`\n1. Update all inter-dependent crates, i.e. hickory-resolver to use `hickory-proto = 0.20.1`\n1. Update [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) to include all PR's (of consequence) since the previous release\n1. Push to Github, create a PR and merge in `main` or the target release branch.\n1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/hickory-dns/hickory-dns/releases) and `Draft a new release`\n1. Give it a `Tag Version` of `vX.x.x`, e.g. `v0.20.1`, *make sure this is tagging the correct branch, e.g. `main` or `release/0.19`*\n1. Give it a  `Release Title` of something key to the release\n1. Copy and paste the part of the CHANGELOG.md for this release into `Describe this release`\n1. `Publish Release`, this will kick off the publish workflow\n\nAfter approximately 45 minutes it should be published. This may fail.\n\n**TBD**: add instructions to skip already published crates\n\n## Updating Security Related Tests\n\n### All TLS tests are failing\n\nTBD: add notes on updating certificates in test directories\n\n## FAQ\n\n- Why are there so few maintainers?\n\nThere have not been that many people familiar with DNS internals, networking, security, and Rust that the list of maintainers has been relatively small.\n\n- Will new maintainers be considered?\n\nYes! There is no formal process, and generally it's a goal to open up to anyone who's been committing regularly to the project. We'd ask that you are committed to the goals of an open DNS implementation that anyone can freely use as they see fit. Please reach out on Discord if you'd like to become a maintainer and discuss with us.\n\n## Configuring rust-analyzer\n\nThis repository contains multiple workspaces, so rust-analyzer will require additional configuration to provide hints in all files. If you are using the VS Code extension, create a `.vscode` directory inside the repository if it doesn't exist already, and edit `.vscode/settings.json` as follows:\n\n```jsonc\n{\n    \"rust-analyzer.linkedProjects\": [\n        \"/path/to/hickory-dns/Cargo.toml\",\n        \"/path/to/hickory-dns/conformance/Cargo.toml\",\n        \"/path/to/hickory-dns/fuzz/Cargo.toml\",\n        \"/path/to/hickory-dns/tests/e2e-tests/Cargo.toml\"\n    ],\n    \"rust-analyzer.cargo.features\": \"all\"\n    // etc.\n}\n```\n\n## Thank you!\n\nSeriously, thank you for contributing to this project. Hickory DNS would not be where it is today without the support of contributors like you.\n"

The Resolver supports many common query patterns, all of which can be configured when creating the Resolver. It is capable of using system configuration on Unix and Windows. On Windows there is a known issue that relates to a large set of interfaces being registered for use, so might require ignoring the system configuration.\n\nThe Resolver will properly follow CNAME chains as well as SRV record lookups.\n\n## Client\n\nThe Hickory DNS Client is intended to be used for operating against a DNS server\ndirectly. It can be used for verifying records or updating records for servers\nthat support SIG0 and dynamic update. The Client is also capable of validating\nDNSSEC. NSEC and NSEC3 validation are supported. Today, the Tokio async runtime\nis required.\n\n### Unique client side implementations\n\nThese are standards supported by the DNS protocol. The client implements them\nas high level interfaces, which is a bit more rare.\n\n| Feature                                                                                                                   | Description                                           |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |\n| [SyncDnssecClient](https://docs.rs/hickory-client/latest/hickory_client/client/struct.SyncDnssecClient.html)              | DNSSEC validation                                     |\n| [create](https://docs.rs/hickory-client/latest/hickory_client/client/trait.Client.html#method.create)                     | atomic create of a record, with authenticated request |\n| [append](https://docs.rs/hickory-client/latest/hickory_client/client/trait.Client.html#method.append)                     | verify existence of a record and append to it         |\n| [compare_and_swap](https://docs.rs/hickory-client/latest/hickory_client/client/trait.Client.html#method.compare_and_swap) | atomic (depends on server) compare and swap           |\n| [delete_by_rdata](https://docs.rs/hickory-client/latest/hickory_client/client/trait.Client.html#method.delete_by_rdata)   | delete a specific record                              |\n| [delete_rrset](https://docs.rs/hickory-client/latest/hickory_client/client/trait.Client.html#method.delete_rrset)         | delete an entire record set                           |\n| [delete_all](https://docs.rs/hickory-client/latest/hickory_client/client/trait.Client.html#method.delete_all)             | delete all records sets with a given name             |\n| [notify](https://docs.rs/hickory-client/latest/hickory_client/client/trait.Client.html#method.notify)                     | notify server that it should reload a zone            |\n\n## Server\n\nThe server code is complete, the daemon supports IPv4 and IPv6, UDP and TCP.\nThere currently is no way to limit TCP and AXFR operations, so it is still not\nrecommended to put into production as TCP can be used to DOS the service.\nZone file parsing is complete and supported. There is currently no forking\noption, and the server is not yet threaded (although it is implemented with\nasync IO, so threading may not be a huge benefit). There is still a lot of work\nto do before a server can be trusted with this externally. Running it behind a\nfirewall on a private network would be safe.\n\nZone signing support is complete, to insert a key store a pem encoded rsa file\nin the same directory as the initial zone file with the `.key` suffix. _Note_:\nthis must be only readable by the current user. If one is not present one will\nbe created and written to the correct location. This also acts as the initial\nkey for dynamic update SIG(0) validation. To get the public key, the `DNSKEY`\nrecord for the zone can be queried. This is needed to provide to other\nupstream servers to create the `DS` key. Dynamic DNS is also complete,\nif enabled, a journal file will be stored next to the zone file with the\n`jrnl` suffix. _Note_: if the key is changed or updated, it is currently the\noperators responsibility to remove the only public key from the zone, this\nallows for the `DNSKEY` to exist for some unspecified period of time during\nkey rotation. Rotating the key while online is not currently supported, so\na restart of the server process is required.\n\n### DNS-over-TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS on the Server\n\nSupport of TLS on the Server is managed through a pkcs12 der file. The documentation is captured in the example test config file, [example.toml](https://github.com/hickory-dns/hickory-dns/blob/main/tests/test-data/test_configs/example.toml). A registered certificate to the server can be pinned to the Client with the `add_ca()` method. Alternatively, as the client uses the rust-native-tls library, it should work with certificate signed by any standard CA.\n\n## DNS-over-TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS\n\nDoT and DoH are supported. This is accomplished through the use of one of `native-tls`, `openssl`, or `rustls` (only `rustls` is currently supported for DoH). The Resolver requires valid DoT or DoH resolvers being registered in order to be used.\n\nTo use DoT or DoH with the `Client`, construct it with `TlsClientStream` or\n`HttpsClientStream`. Client authentication/mTLS is currently not supported,\nthere are some issues still being worked on. TLS is useful for Server\nauthentication and connection privacy.\n\nTo enable DoT, one of the features `dns-over-native-tls`, `dns-over-openssl`, or\n`dns-over-rustls` must be enabled. `dns-over-https-rustls` is used for DoH.\n\n## DNSSEC status\n\nThe current root key is bundled into the system, and used by default. This gives\nvalidation of DNSKEY and DS records back to the root. NSEC and NSEC3 are\nimplemented.\n\nZones will be automatically resigned on any record updates via dynamic DNS. To enable DNSSEC, one of the features `dnssec-openssl` or `dnssec-ring` must be enabled.\n\n## RFCs implemented\n\n- [RFC 8499](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8499): No more master/slave, in honor of [Juneteenth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth)\n\n### Basic operations\n\n- [RFC 1035](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035): Base DNS spec (see the Resolver for caching)\n- [RFC 2308](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2308): Negative Caching of DNS Queries (see the Resolver)\n- [RFC 2782](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2782): Service location\n- [RFC 3596](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3596): IPv6\n- [RFC 6891](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6891): Extension Mechanisms for DNS\n- [RFC 6761](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6761): Special-Use Domain Names (resolver)\n- [RFC 6762](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6762): mDNS Multicast DNS (experimental feature: `mdns`)\n- [RFC 6763](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6763): DNS-SD Service Discovery (experimental feature: `mdns`)\n- [RFC ANAME](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-dnsop-aname-02): Address-specific DNS aliases (`ANAME`)\n\n### Update operations\n\n- [RFC 2136](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2136): Dynamic Update\n- [RFC 7477](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7477): Child-to-Parent Synchronization in DNS\n\n### Secure DNS operations\n\n- [RFC 2931](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2931): SIG(0)\n- [RFC 3007](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3007): Secure Dynamic Update\n- [RFC 4034](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4034): DNSSEC Resource Records\n- [RFC 4035](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4035): Protocol Modifications for DNSSEC\n- [RFC 4509](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4509): SHA-256 in DNSSEC Delegation Signer\n- [RFC 5155](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5155): DNSSEC Hashed Authenticated Denial of Existence\n- [RFC 5702](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5702): SHA-2 Algorithms with RSA in DNSKEY and RRSIG for DNSSEC\n- [RFC 6844](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6844): DNS Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) Resource Record\n- [RFC 6698](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6698): The DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol: TLSA\n- [RFC 6840](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6840): Clarifications and Implementation Notes for DNSSEC\n- [RFC 6844](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6844): DNS Certification Authority Authorization Resource Record\n- [RFC 6944](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6944): DNSKEY Algorithm Implementation Status\n- [RFC 6975](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6975): Signaling Cryptographic Algorithm Understanding\n- [RFC 7858](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7858): DNS over TLS (feature: `dns-over-rustls`, `dns-over-native-tls`, or `dns-over-openssl`)\n- [RFC DoH](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-doh-dns-over-https-14): DNS over HTTPS, DoH (feature: `dns-over-https-rustls`)\n\n## RFCs in progress or not yet implemented\n\n### Basic operations\n\n- [RFC 2317](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2317): Classless IN-ADDR.ARPA delegation\n\n### Update operations\n\n- [RFC 1995](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1995): Incremental Zone Transfer\n- [RFC 1996](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1996): Notify secondaries of update\n- [Update Leases](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-sekar-dns-ul-01): Dynamic DNS Update Leases\n- [Long-Lived Queries](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-sekar-dns-llq-01): Notify with bells\n\n### Secure DNS operations\n\n- [DNSCrypt](https://dnscrypt.org): Trusted DNS queries\n- [S/MIME](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-dane-smime-09): Domain Names For S/MIME\n\n# Usage\n\nThis assumes that you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) stable installed. These\npresume that the hickory-dns repos have already been synced to the local system:\n\n    git clone https://github.com/hickory-dns/hickory-dns.git\n    cd hickory-dns\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n### Minimum Rust Version\n\n- The current minimum rustc version for this project is `1.70`\n- OpenSSL development libraries (optional in client and resolver, min version 1.0.2)\n\n### Mac OS X: using homebrew\n\n```\n  brew install openssl\n  export OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR=`brew --prefix openssl`/include\n  export OPENSSL_LIB_DIR=`brew --prefix openssl`/lib\n```\n\n### Debian-based (includes Ubuntu & Raspbian): using apt-get\n\n```\n  # note for openssl that a minimum version of 1.0.2 is required for TLS,\n  #  if this is an issue, TLS can be disabled (on the client), see below.\n  $ apt-get install openssl\n  $ apt-get install libssl-dev pkg-config\n```\n\n## Testing\n\nHickory DNS uses `just` for build workflow management. While running `cargo test` at the project root will work, this is not exhaustive. Install `just` with `cargo install just`. A few of the `just` recipes require [`cargo-workspaces`](https://github.com/pksunkara/cargo-workspaces) to be installed, a plugin to optimize the workflow around cargo workspaces. Install the plugin with `cargo install cargo-workspaces`.\n\n- Default tests\n\n  These are good for running on local systems. They will create sockets for\n  local tests, but will not attempt to access remote systems. Tests can also\n  be run from the crate directory, i.e. `client` or `server` and `cargo test`\n\n```shell\njust default\n```\n\n- Default feature tests\n\n  Hickory DNS has many features, to quickly test with them or without, there are three targets supported, `default`, `no-default-features`, `all-features`:\n\n```shell\njust all-features\n```\n\n- Individual feature tests\n\n  Hickory DNS has many features, each individual feature can be tested\n  independently. See individual crates for all their features, here is a not\n  necessarily up to date list: `dns-over-rustls`, `dns-over-https-rustls`,\n  `dns-over-native-tls`, `dns-over-openssl`, `dns-dnssec-openssl`,\n  `dns-dnssec-openssl`, `dns-dnssec-ring`, `mdns`. Each feature can be tested\n  with itself as the task target for `just`:\n\n```shell\njust dns-over-https-rustls\n```\n\n- Benchmarks\n\n  Waiting on benchmarks to stabilize in mainline Rust.\n\n## Building\n\n- Production build, from the `hickory-dns` base dir, to get all features, just pass the `--all-features` flag.\n\n```shell\ncargo build --release -p hickory-dns\n```\n\n## Running\n\nWarning: Hickory DNS is still under development, running in production is not\nrecommended. The server is currently only single-threaded, it is non-blocking\nso this should allow it to work with most internal loads.\n\n- Verify the version\n\n```shell\n./target/release/hickory-dns --version\n```\n\n- Get help\n\n```shell\n./target/release/hickory-dns --help\n```\n\n- Launch `hickory-dns` server with test config\n\nNote that if the `-p` parameter is not passed, the server will run on default\nDNS ports. There are separate port options for DoT and DoH servers, see\n`hickory-dns --help`\n\n```shell\n./target/release/hickory-dns -c ./tests/test-data/test_configs/example.toml -z ./tests/test-data/test_configs/ -p 24141\n```\n\n- Query the just launched server with `dig`\n\n```shell\ndig @127.0.0.1 -p 24141 www.example.com\n```\n\n## Using the hickory-resolver CLI\n\nAvailable in `0.20`\n\n```shell\ncargo install --bin resolve hickory-util\n```\n\nOr from source, in the hickory-dns directory\n\n```shell\ncargo install --bin resolve --path util\n```\n\nexample:\n\n```shell\n$ resolve www.example.com.\nQuerying for www.example.com. A from udp:8.8.8.8:53, tcp:8.8.8.8:53, udp:8.8.4.4:53, tcp:8.8.4.4:53, udp:[2001:4860:4860::8888]:53, tcp:[2001:4860:4860::8888]:53, udp:[2001:4860:4860::8844]:53, tcp:[2001:4860:4860::8844]:53\nSuccess for query name: www.example.com. type: A class: IN\n        www.example.com. 21063 IN A 93.184.215.14\n```\n\n## Using as a dependency and custom features\n\nThe Client has a few features which can be disabled for different reasons when embedding in other software.\n\n- `dnssec-openssl`\n  Uses OpenSSL for DNSSEC validation.\n\n- `dnssec-ring`\n  Ring support can be used for RSA and ED25519 DNSSEC validation.\n\n- `dns-over-native-tls`\n  Uses `native-tls` for DNS-over-TLS implementation, only supported in client and resolver, not server.\n\n- `dns-over-openssl`\n  Uses `openssl` for DNS-over-TLS implementation supported in server and client, resolver does not have default CA chains.\n\n- `dns-over-rustls`\n  Uses `rustls` for DNS-over-TLS implementation. This is the best option where a pure Rust toolchain is desired. Supported in client, resolver, and server.\n\n- `dns-over-https-rustls`\n  Uses `rustls` for DNS-over-HTTPS (and DNS-over-TLS will be enabled) implementation, only supported in client, resolver, and server. This is the best option where a pure Rust toolchain is desired.\n\n- `mdns` _EXPERIMENTAL_\n  Enables the experimental mDNS features as well as DNS-SD. This currently has known issues.\n\nUsing custom features in dependencies:\n\n```\n[dependencies]\n  ...\nhickory-client = { version = \"*\", default-features = false, features = [\"dnssec-openssl\"] }\n```\n\nUsing custom features during build:\n\n```console\n$> cargo build --release --features dns-over-rustls\n...\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n- Why are you building another DNS server?\n\n      Because of all the security advisories out there for BIND.\n\n  Using Rust semantics it should be possible to develop a high performance and\n  safe DNS Server that is more resilient to attacks.\n\n- What is the MSRV (minimum stable Rust version) policy?\n\n      Hickory DNS will work to support backward compatibility with three Rust versions.\n\n  For example, if `1.50` is the current release, then the MSRV will be `1.47`. The\n  version is only increased as necessary, so it's possible that the MSRV is older\n  than this policy states. Additionally, the MSRV is only supported for the `no-default-features`\n  build due to it being an intractable issue of trying to enforce this policy on dependencies.\n\n## Community\n\nFor live discussions beyond this repository, please see this [Discord](https://discord.gg/89nxE4n).\n\n## License\n\nLicensed under either of\n\n- Apache License, Version 2.0, ([LICENSE-APACHE](LICENSE-APACHE) or <https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0>)\n- MIT license ([LICENSE-MIT](LICENSE-MIT) or <https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT>)\n\nat your option.\n\n### Contribution\n\nUnless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally\nsubmitted for inclusion in the work by you, as defined in the Apache-2.0\nlicense, shall be dual licensed as above, without any additional terms or\nconditions.\n"
