It provides a more strongly typed interface than the underlying LLVM C API so that certain types of errors can be caught at compile time instead of at LLVM's runtime. This means we are trying to replicate LLVM IR's strong typing as closely as possible. The ultimate goal is to make LLVM safer from the rust end and a bit easier to learn (via documentation) and use.\n\n## Requirements\n\n* Rust 1.56+ (Stable, Beta, or Nightly)\n* One of LLVM 4-18\n\n## Usage\n\nYou'll need to point your Cargo.toml to use a single LLVM version feature flag corresponding to your LLVM version as such:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\ninkwell = { version = \"0.5.0\", features = [\"llvm18-0\"] }\n```\n\nSupported versions:\nLLVM 4-18 mapping to a cargo feature flag `llvmM-0` where `M` corresponds to the LLVM major version.\n\nPlease be aware that we may make breaking changes on master from time to time since we are\npre-v1.0.0, in compliance with semver. Please prefer a crates.io release whenever possible!\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation is automatically [deployed here](https://thedan64.github.io/inkwell/) based on master. These docs are not yet 100% complete and only show the latest supported LLVM version due to a rustdoc issue. See [#2](https://github.com/TheDan64/inkwell/issues/2) for more info.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Tari's [llvm-sys example](https://gitlab.com/taricorp/llvm-sys.rs/blob/6411edb2fed1a805b7ec5029afc9c3ae1cf6c842/examples/jit-function.rs) written in safe code<sup>1</sup> with Inkwell:\n\n```rust\nuse inkwell::builder::Builder;\nuse inkwell::context::Context;\nuse inkwell::execution_engine::{ExecutionEngine, JitFunction};\nuse inkwell::module::Module;\nuse inkwell::OptimizationLevel;\n\nuse std::error::Error;\n\n/// Convenience type alias for the `sum` function.\n///\n/// Calling this is innately `unsafe` because there's no guarantee it doesn't\n/// do `unsafe` operations internally.\ntype SumFunc = unsafe extern \"C\" fn(u64, u64, u64) -> u64;\n\nstruct CodeGen<'ctx> {\n    context: &'ctx Context,\n    module: Module<'ctx>,\n    builder: Builder<'ctx>,\n    execution_engine: ExecutionEngine<'ctx>,\n}\n\nimpl<'ctx> CodeGen<'ctx> {\n    fn jit_compile_sum(&self) -> Option<JitFunction<SumFunc>> {\n        let i64_type = self.context.i64_type();\n        let fn_type = i64_type.fn_type(&[i64_type.into(), i64_type.into(), i64_type.into()], false);\n        let function = self.module.add_function(\"sum\", fn_type, None);\n        let basic_block = self.context.append_basic_block(function, \"entry\");\n\n        self.builder.position_at_end(basic_block);\n\n        let x = function.get_nth_param(0)?.into_int_value();\n        let y = function.get_nth_param(1)?.into_int_value();\n        let z = function.get_nth_param(2)?.into_int_value();\n\n        let sum = self.builder.build_int_add(x, y, \"sum\").unwrap();\n        let sum = self.builder.build_int_add(sum, z, \"sum\").unwrap();\n\n        self.builder.build_return(Some(&sum)).unwrap();\n\n        unsafe { self.execution_engine.get_function(\"sum\").ok() }\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {\n    let context = Context::create();\n    let module = context.create_module(\"sum\");\n    let execution_engine = module.create_jit_execution_engine(OptimizationLevel::None)?;\n    let codegen = CodeGen {\n        context: &context,\n        module,\n        builder: context.create_builder(),\n        execution_engine,\n    };\n\n    let sum = codegen.jit_compile_sum().ok_or(\"Unable to JIT compile `sum`\")?;\n\n    let x = 1u64;\n    let y = 2u64;\n    let z = 3u64;\n\n    unsafe {\n        println!(\"{} + {} + {} = {}\", x, y, z, sum.call(x, y, z));\n        assert_eq!(sum.call(x, y, z), x + y + z);\n    }\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\n<sup>1</sup> There are two uses of `unsafe` in this example because the actual\nact of compiling and executing code on the fly is innately `unsafe`. For one,\nthere is no way of verifying we are calling `get_function()` with the right function\nsignature. It is also `unsafe` to *call* the function we get because there's no\nguarantee the code itself doesn't do `unsafe` things internally (the same reason\nyou need `unsafe` when calling into C).\n\n### LLVM's [Kaleidoscope Tutorial](https://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/index.html)\n\nCan be found in the examples directory.\n\n## Alternative Crate(s)\n\n* [llvm-ir](https://github.com/cdisselkoen/llvm-ir)\n\n## Contributing\n\nCheck out our [Contributing Guide](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n"
