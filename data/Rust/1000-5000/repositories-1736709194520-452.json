Power\n\n**Important Note:**\n\n * Steam Deck Power Input: **45W USB Type-C PD3.0 power supply**.\n\n * The Steam Deck can be charged at a **maximum speed of 45W**. \n\n * There’s a **5,313mAh battery** inside the Steam Deck.\n\n * I would recommend getting a **20,000mAh power bank** for your Steam Deck as it will charge your console multiple times.\n\n### Chargers\n\n[Back to

Before you go offline, connect to the Xbox network to sync your most recent game save to the cloud. While you play offline, your game save progress will continue to be saved locally, and it’ll sync the next time you sign in to Xbox. If you want to continue playing on a different device, you’ll need to go online and connect to the Xbox network to allow your local saved game to sync with the cloud again.\n\n * **Note 2:** PC Game Pass game licenses expire after 30 days when playing offline, and licenses for owned games expire after 14 days. To keep playing your game offline, go back online and launch the game. This renews the game’s license on your device and ensures you can go back to playing offline.  \n\nYou can only have one device as your designated offline device. **To set your device as your designated offline device:**\n\n  * Make sure that you’re online.\n  * Check that your device has the latest Windows updates: **Go to Start -> Settings -> Update & security -> Windows Update and see if any relevant updates are available**.\n  * Open the Microsoft Store. You’ll be prompted to sign in if you haven’t already.\n  * Select your profile icon in the upper right corner.\n  * Select App settings, and then under Offline permissions, make sure that the toggle is set to On.\n\nOnce you set this, any devices previously designated as offline will be toggled to Off, and you’ll no longer be able to play games offline on those devices.\n\n**Prepare your game or games**\n\nOnce your device is set up, you’ll need to launch each game you want to play offline while signed in to the Xbox network. You only need to do this once per game, and you’ll need to do this even if you’ve already launched the game on your device.\n\n  * Make sure that you’re online, and that your device is set as your designated offline device. (See the steps above for details on how to do this.)\n  * Launch the game you want to play offline. When prompted, sign in to Xbox.\n  * Once you’ve started playing the game, you can exit at any time.\n\nRepeat this process for each game you want to play offline. Once completed, you can go offline at any time and launch those games whenever you want to play them, without needing to sign in online each time.\n\n## Setting up OpenGamepadUI\n\n[Back to the Top](#table-of-contents)\n\n[OpenGamepadUI](https://github.com/ShadowBlip/OpenGamepadUI) is a free and open source game launcher and overlay written using the Godot Game Engine 4 designed with a gamepad native experience in mind.
