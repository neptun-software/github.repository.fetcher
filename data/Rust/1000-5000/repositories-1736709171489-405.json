Consider [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/deepu105) if you like the work.\n\n<!-- ### Gold\n\n### Silver\n\n### Bronze\n\n- [Robusta - Kubernetes monitoring](https://home.robusta.dev/)\n\nGold and Silver tiers are open for [Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/deepu105)  -->\n\n## Installation\n\n### Homebrew (Mac & Linux)\n\n```bash\nbrew tap kdash-rs/kdash\nbrew install kdash\n\n# If you need to be more specific, use:\nbrew install kdash-rs/kdash/kdash\n```\n\nTo upgrade\n\n```bash\nbrew upgrade kdash\n```\n\n### Scoop (Windows - Recommended way)\n\n```bash\nscoop bucket add kdash-bucket https://github.com/kdash-rs/scoop-kdash\n\nscoop install kdash\n```\n\n### Chocolatey (Windows)\n\nChocolatey package is located [here](https://chocolatey.org/packages/kdash).\nSince validation of the package takes forever, it may take a long while to become available after a release. I would recommend using Scoop instead for Windows.\n\n```bash\nchoco install kdash\n\n# Version number may be required for newer releases, if available:\nchoco install kdash --version=0.4.3\n```\n\nTo upgrade\n\n```bash\nchoco upgrade kdash --version=0.4.3\n```\n\n### Cargo\n\nIf you have Cargo installed then you install KDash from crates.io\n\n```bash\ncargo install kdash\n\n# if you face issues with k8s-openapi crate try the below\ncargo install --locked kdash\n```\n\nYou can also clone the repo and run `cargo run` or `make` to build and run the app\n\n### Nix (Maintained by third party)\n\nTry out kdash via `nix run nixpkgs#kdash` or add `kdash` to your\n`configuration.nix` for permanent installation.\n\n### Install script\n\nRun the below command to install the latest binary. Run with sudo if you don't have write access to `/usr/local/bin`. Else the script will install to the current directory\n\n```sh\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kdash-rs/kdash/main/deployment/getLatest.sh | bash\n```\n\n### Manual\n\nBinaries for macOS (x86_64, arm64), Linux GNU/MUSL(x86_64, armv6, armv7, aarch64) and Windows (x86_64, aarch64) are available on the [releases](https://github.com/kdash-rs/kdash/releases) page\n\n1. Download the latest [binary](https://github.com/kdash-rs/kdash/releases) for your OS.\n1. For Linux/macOS:\n   1. `cd` to the file you just downloaded and run `tar -C /usr/local/bin -xzf downloaded-file-name`. Use sudo if required.\n   1. Run with `kdash`\n1. For Windows:\n   1. Use 7-Zip or TarTool to unpack the tar file.\n   1. Run the executable file `kdash.exe`\n\n### Docker\n\nRun KDash as a Docker container by mounting your `KUBECONFIG`. For example the below command for the default path\n\n```bash\ndocker run --rm -it -v ~/.kube/config:/root/.kube/config deepu105/kdash\n# If you want localhost access from the container\ndocker run --network host --rm -it -v ~/.kube/config:/root/.kube/config deepu105/kdash\n```\n\nYou can also clone this repo and run `make docker` to build a docker image locally and run it using the above command\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**Note**: This may not work properly if you run Kubernetes locally using Minikube or Kind\n\n> Note: On Debian/Ubuntu you might need to install `libxcb-xfixes0-dev` and `libxcb-shape0-dev`. On Fedora `libxcb` and `libxcb-devel` would be needed.\n\n> Note: On Linux you might need to have package `xorg-dev` (Debian/Ubuntu) or `xorg-x11-server-devel` (Fedora) or equivalent installed for the copy to clipboard features to work\n\n> Note: If you are getting compilation error from openSSL. Make sure perl and perl-core are installed for your OS.\n\n## USAGE:\n\n```bash\nkdash\n```\n\nPress `?` while running the app to see keybindings\n\n## FLAGS:\n\n- `-h, --help`: Prints help information\n- `-V, --version`: Prints version information\n- `-t, --tick-rate <tick-rate>`: Set the tick rate (milliseconds): the lower the number the higher the FPS.\n- `-p, --poll-rate <poll-rate>`: Set the network call polling rate (milliseconds, should be multiples of tick-rate): the lower the number the higher the network calls.\n- `-d, --debug[=<debug>]`: Enables debug mode and writes logs to `kdash-debug-<timestamp>.log` file in the current directory. Default behavior is to write INFO logs. Pass a log level to overwrite the default [possible values: info, debug, trace, warn, error]\n\n## Limitations/Known issues\n\n- **[Linux/Docker]** Copy to clipboard feature is OS/arch dependent and might crash in some Linux distros and is not supported on `aarch64` and `arm` machines.\n- **[macOS]** KDash looks better on iTerm2 since macOS's default Terminal app makes the colors render weird.\n- **[Windows]** KDash looks better on CMD since Powershell's default theme makes the colors look weird.\n- **[Windows]** If using k3d for local clusters, set the server URL to 127.0.0.1 as 0.0.0.0 doesn't work with kube-rs. You can use `k3d cluster create --api-port 127.0.0.1:6550` or change the `cluster.server` value in your `.kube/config` for the k3d cluster to `127.0.0.1:<port>`.\n\n## Features\n\n- CLI info\n- Node metrics\n- Resource watch (configurable polling interval with `-p` flag)\n- Custom resource definitions\n- Describe resources & copy the output\n- Get YAML for resources & copy the output\n- Stream container logs\n- Context\n  - Context info\n  - Context watch\n  - Change namespace\n  - Context switch\n- Resources utilizations for nodes, pods and namespaces based on metrics server. Requires [metrics-server](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/resource-metrics-pipeline/#metrics-server) to be deployed on the cluster.\n- Dark/Light themes\n- Sensible keyboard shortcuts\n- Global glob filtering for resource names\n\n## Screenshots\n\n### Overview screen\n\n![UI](screenshots/overview.png)\n\n### Container logs screen (light theme)\n\n![UI](screenshots/logs.png)\n\n### Pod describe screen (light theme)\n\n![UI](screenshots/describe.png)\n\n### Contexts screen\n\n![UI](screenshots/contexts.png)\n\n### Utilization screen\n\n![UI](screenshots/utilization.png)\n\n## Libraries used\n\n- [ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui)\n- [crossterm](https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm)\n- [clap](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap)\n- [tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio)\n- [duct.rs](https://github.com/oconnor663/duct.rs)\n- [kube-rs](https://github.com/clux/kube-rs)\n- [serde](https://github.com/serde-rs/serde)\n- [kubectl-view-allocations](https://github.com/davidB/kubectl-view-allocations)\n- [copypasta](https://github.com/alacritty/copypasta)\n\n## How does this compare to K9S?\n\n[K9S](https://github.com/derailed/k9s) is a beast compared to this as it offers way more features including CRUD actions.\n\nKDash only offers a view of the resources with a focus on speed and UX. Really, if something is slow or has bad UX then please raise a bug. Hence the UI/UX is designed to be more user-friendly and easier to navigate with contextual help everywhere and a tab system to switch between different resources easily.\n\nAt least for now, there are no plans to add full CRUD for resources but in the future, we might.\n\n## Licence\n\nMIT\n\n## Creator\n\n- [Deepu K Sasidharan](https://deepu.tech/)\n\n## [Contributors](https://github.com/kdash-rs/kdash/graphs/contributors)\n"
