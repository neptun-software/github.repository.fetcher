In general, there are four things you should follow when writing programs that use coroutines:\n* Don't call thread-blocking API (It will hurt the performance);\n* Carefully use Thread Local Storage (access TLS in coroutine might trigger undefined behavior).\n\n> It's considered **unsafe** with the following pattern:\n> ```rust\n> set_tls();\n> // Or another coroutine API that would cause scheduling:\n> coroutine::yield_now(); \n> use_tls();\n> ```\n> but it's **safe** if your code is not sensitive about the previous state of TLS. Or there is no coroutines scheduling between **set** TLS and **use** TLS.\n\n* Don't run CPU bound tasks for long time, but it's ok if you don't care about fairness;\n* Don't exceed the coroutine stack. There is a guard page for each coroutine stack. When stack overflow occurs, it will trigger segment fault error.\n\n**Note:**\n> The first three rules are common when using cooperative asynchronous libraries in Rust. Even using a futures-based system also have these limitations. So what you should really focus on is a coroutine stack size, make sure it's big enough for your applications. \n\n----------\n\n## How to tune a stack size\nIf you want to tune your coroutine stack size, please check out [this document][stack].\n\n----------\n\n## License\nMay is licensed under either of the following, at your option:\n\n * The Apache License v2.0.0 ([LICENSE-APACHE](LICENSE-APACHE) or http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0);\n * The MIT License ([LICENSE-MIT](LICENSE-MIT) or http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\n\n<!-- refs -->\n[generator]:https://github.com/Xudong-Huang/generator-rs\n[sort]:https://github.com/Xudong-Huang/quick_sort\n[prime]:https://github.com/Xudong-Huang/prime\n[echo_server]:examples/echo.rs\n[echo_client]:examples/echo_client.rs\n[http_sever]:examples/http.rs\n[https_sever]:examples/https.rs\n[websocket]:examples/websocket.rs\n[cls]:docs/CLS_instead_of_TLS.md\n[go]:https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/1\n[tokio]:https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/blob/master/examples/echo.rs\n[caveat]:docs/may_caveat.md\n[stack]:docs/tune_stack_size.md\n[may_minihttp]:https://github.com/Xudong-Huang/may_minihttp\n"

In theory, `future` scheduling is not evolving context switch which should be a little bit faster than the coroutine version. But I can't find a proper example for multi-threaded version comparison, so just put it here for you to get some sense about the performance of May. If you have a better implementation of s futures-based echo server, I will update it here. You can refer to https://tfb-status.techempower.com/ to get the latest [may_minihttp][may_minihttp] comparisons with other most popular frameworks.\n\n**The machine's specification:**\n  * **Logical Cores:** 8 (4 cores x 2 threads)\n  * **Memory:** 4gb ECC DDR3 @ 1600mhz\n  * **Processor:** CPU Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3820QM CPU @ 2.70GHz\n  * **Operating System:** Windows WSL2 Ubuntu 18.04\n\n**An echo server and client:**\n\nYou can just compile it under this project:\n```sh\n$ cargo build --example=echo_client --release\n```\n\n**Tokio-based echo server:**\n\nRun the server by default with 8 threads in another terminal:\n```sh\n$ cd tokio\n$ cargo run --example=echo --release\n```\n\n```sh\n$ cargo run --example=echo_client --release -- -c 100 -l 100 -t 8 -a 127.0.0.1:8080\n    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 5.86s\n     Running `target/release/examples/echo_client -c 100 -l 100 -t 8 -a '127.0.0.1:8080'`\n==================Benchmarking: 127.0.0.1:8080==================\n100 clients, running 100 bytes, 10 sec.\n\nSpeed: 153496 request/sec,  153495 response/sec, 14989 kb/sec\nRequests: 1534961\nResponses: 1534958\n```\n\n**May-based echo server:**\n\nRun the server by default with 2 threads in another terminal:\n```sh\n$ cd may\n$ cargo run --example=echo --release -- -t 8 -p 8000\n```\n\n```sh\n$ cargo run --example=echo_client --release -- -c 100 -l 100 -t 8 -a 127.0.0.1:8000\n    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 11.77s\n     Running `target/release/examples/echo_client -c 100 -l 100 -t 8 -a '127.0.0.1:8000'`\n==================Benchmarking: 127.0.0.1:8000==================\n100 clients, running 100 bytes, 10 sec.\n\nSpeed: 256155 request/sec,  256155 response/sec, 25015 kb/sec\nRequests: 2561559\nResponses: 2561554\n```\n\n-----------\n<!-- refs -->\n[tokio]:https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/blob/master/examples/echo.rs\n[may_minihttp]:https://github.com/Xudong-Huang/may_minihttp"
