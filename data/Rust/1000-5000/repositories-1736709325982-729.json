Distribution of Source Form\n\nAll distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\nModifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under\nthe terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\nCode Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\nLicense, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\nattempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\nForm.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3.

          "content": "Making a Just-In-Time compiler is complex, a large source of security\nissues, and is a price which is frequently paid to have better performance\nresults.\n\nHolyJit is made to remove this trade-off! Simplicity and security should no\nlonger be sacrificed for performance reasons.\n\n# HolyJit\n\nHolyJit is a high-level Just-In-Time compiler. It extends the Rust compiler\nto convert the code of an interpreter written in Rust to tune a JIT compiler\nto handle the same interpreted language.\n\nHolyJit aims at being:\n * Easy.\n * Safe.\n * Fast.\n\n### Easy\n\nHolyJit extends the Rust compiler to copy its internal representation of\nfunctions and convert it into a representation which can be consumed by the\nJIT compiler provided by HolyJit library.\n\nAs a user, this implies that to inline a function in JIT compiled code, one\njust need to annotate it with the `jit!` macro:\n\n```rust\njit!{\n    fn eval(script: &Script, args: &[Value]) -> Result<Value, Error>\n    = eval_impl\n    in script.as_ref()\n}\n\nfn eval_impl(script: &Script, args: &[Value]) -> Result<Value, Error> {\n    // ...\n    // ... A few hundred lines of ordinary Rust code later ...\n    // ...\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let script = ...;\n    let args = ...;\n    // Call it as any ordinary function.\n    let res = eval(&script, &args);\n    println!(\"Result: {}\", res);\n}\n```\n\nThus, you basically have to write an interpreter, and annotate it properly\nto teach the JIT compiler what can be optimized by the compiler.\n\nNo assembly knowledge is required to start instrumenting your code to make\nit available to the JIT compiler's set of known functions.\n\n### Safe\n\nSecurity issues from JIT compilers arise from:\n  * Duplication of the runtime into a set of MacroAssembler functions.\n  * Correctness of the compiler optimizations.\n\nAs HolyJit extends the Rust compiler to extract the effective knowledge of\nthe compiler, there is no more risk of having correctness issues caused by\nthe duplication of code.\n\nMoreover, the code which is given to the JIT compiler is as safe as the code\nusers wrote in the Rust language.\n\nAs HolyJit aims at being a JIT library which can easily be embedded into\nother projects, correctness of the compiler optimizations should be caught\nby the community of users and fuzzers, thus leaving less bugs for you to\nfind.\n\n### Fast\n\nFast is a tricky question when dealing with a JIT compiler, as the cost of\nthe compilation is part of the equation.\n\nHolyJit aims at reducing the start-up time, based on annotations made out of\nmacros, to guide the early tiers of the compilers for unrolling loops and\ngenerating inline caches.\n\nFor final compilation tiers, it uses special types/traits to wrap the data\nin order to instrument and monitor the values which are being used, such\nthat guards can later be converted into constraints.\n\n## Using HolyJit\n\nHolyJit is a rustc driver, which means that it has to be used in-place of rustc\nor as a rustc wrapper, i.e. by settings either the `RUSTC` or `RUSTC_WRAPPER`\nenvironment variable.\n\nWhen `holyjit` is used, the binary is instrumented the generated code with\nenough information to resume with the JIT compilation at runtime.\n\nWhen `rustc` is used, a binary is still produced but the JIT is disabled as no\ndata are stored in the binary to be consumed by the JIT compiler at runtime.\n\nTo run tests, you can either run the test of the library with `cargo test`,\nor run the examples of HolyJit with:\n\n```sh\n$ RUSTC_WRAPPER=$(pwd)/rustc.sh cargo run --example brainfuck --verbose\n```\n\nAt the moment, HolyJit is far from being yet ready for production! This is\ncurrently at a prototype stage, and most of the code & dependencies present\ntoday were made only as a proof of concept and not as a definitive\nimplementation design.\n\n## HolyJit Roadmap for 0.0.0\n\nThe current goal is to make a proof of concept which highlights the main\nfeature, i.e. being trivial to integrate into an existing code base and to\nhave a running JIT compiler.\n\nAs of today, HolyJit contains a draft of what the interface might look like,\nand is able to generate code for the example present in the repository.\n\n- [x] Create Rust library\n  - [x] Allocate pages and map them as executable.\n  - [x] Add a way to call either a dynamically compiled function or a\n        statically compiled function.\n  - [x] Add a `jit!` macro, to make calls transparent from the usage point of\n        view.\n  - [x] Create a JitContext class, and use it to request JIT compiled code.\n  - [x] Create a graph representation.\n  - [x] Consume the graph to generate code.\n\n- [x] Create a MIR plugin\n  - [x] Detect locations which have to be patched.\n  - [x] Find functions which have to be converted.\n  - [x] Inject a generated vector in the binary content.\n  - [x] Inject static variables as a tuple.\n  - [x] Collect static variable references.\n  - [x] Convert the MIR (from the Rust compiler) to the library graph\n        representation.\n"
