          "content": "# Welcome to bracket-lib\n\n![](https://github.com/thebracket/bracket-lib/workflows/Rust/badge.svg)\n\n> You can read a tutorial series on writing a Roguelike with this library at: [https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/rustbook/](https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/rustbook/)\n\n> *Bracket-lib* is the primary support library for my book, [Hands-on Rust](https://hands-on-rust.com/). Please consider checking out my book.\n\nEarly work has begun on writing a manual. You can find it in the `manual` folder, or [read it online](https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/bracket-lib/what_is_it.html).\n\n**BREAKING CHANGE ALERT**: The `crossterm` feature is now `cross_term` if you are using `bracket-terminal` directly. It's still `crossterm` for `bracket-lib` and `rltk`.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: If you are running the `webgpu` backend, you need to add `resolver = 2` to your `Cargo.toml` file. WGPU requires it for platform selection.\n\n## What happened to RLTK?\n\nThis *is* RLTK, renamed because it is increasingly finding usage outside of just Roguelikes. It's also been divided into a number of crates, to make it easy to pick-and-choose the features you need.\n\n* `rltk` crate wraps `bracket-lib` and re-exports in the `rltk::` and `rltk::prelude` namespace. This preserves compatibility with all existing RLTK projects.\n* `bracket-algorithm-traits` exposes the traits required for the various algorithm systems in other crates.\n* `bracket-color` is my RGB/HSV color management system.\n* `bracket-geometry` exposes various geometric primitives and helpers. Supports other crates.\n* `bracket-noise` is a port of [Auburn's FastNoise](https://github.com/Auburns/FastNoise) to Rust.\n* `bracket-pathfinding` provides a high-performance A* (A-Star) pathing system, as well as Dijkstra maps.\n* `bracket-random` is a dice-oriented random number generator, including parsing of RPG-style dice strings such as `3d6+12`.\n\n## Using `bracket-lib`\n\nIn your `Cargo.toml` file, include:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nbracket-lib = \"~0.8\"\n```\n\n## Feature Flags\n\nThere are a few feature flags designed to aide integration with other systems:\n\n* `specs` tells various `bracket-lib` sub-systems to export important primitives as having Specs' `Component` type applied.\n* `serde` tells various `bracket-lib` sub-systems to support using `Serde` for serialization/de-serialization.\n\nPerformance:\n\n* `threaded` enables multi-threading on some sub-systems.\n\nTerminal mode:\n\nBy default, `bracket-lib` runs in OpenGL mode (or WebGL if it detects that you are compiling for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`). If you want to use other rendering back-ends, *disable default features* and apply *one* of the following feature flags:\n\n* `webgpu` to use the `wgpu` system as a back-end, supporting Vulkan, Metal and WebGPU.\n* `crossterm` to use the excellent `Crossterm` terminal library.\n* `curses` to use `pancurses` for `ncurses` or `pdcurses` support depending upon your platform.\n\n## Sample Projects\n\n- https://github.com/Micutio/innit\n- https://github.com/amethyst/shotcaller\n- https://github.com/bofh69/rouge\n- https://github.com/carsin/miners\n- https://github.com/baszalmstra/my-little-robots\n- https://github.com/Havegum/Terrain-Generator\n- https://github.com/Bobox214/rs-gliphus\n- https://github.com/Maxgy/blademaster\n- https://github.com/Maxgy/text-rts\n"
