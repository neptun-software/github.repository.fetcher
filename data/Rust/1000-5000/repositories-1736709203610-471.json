And you need to set the `VOLTA_FEATURE_PNPM` environment variable to enable pnpm support.\n\n```bash\nexport VOLTA_FEATURE_PNPM=1\n```\n\n### Development\n\n```bash\n$ cargo build\n$ cargo build --release\n```\n\nBuild js packages (include packages/mako).\n\n```bash\n$ pnpm build\n```\n\nRun mako with examples.\n\n```bash\n$ cargo run --bin mako examples/normal\n# with HMR\n$ cargo run --bin mako examples/normal --watch\n# in production\n$ cargo run --bin mako examples/normal --mode production\n# filter logs\n$ RUST_LOG=mako=debug,info cargo run --bin mako examples/normal\n$ RUST_LOG=mako::parse=debug,info cargo run --bin mako examples/normal\n```\n\n## Advanced Tasks\n\nBefore you push your code, you should run the following commands to make sure everything is ok.\n\n```bash\n$ just ready\n# without e2e\n$ just ready-lite\n```\n\nRun tests.\n\n```bash\n$ pnpm playwright install # only need to run before the first time you run \"jest test\"\n$ just test\n# test specified testcase\n$ cargo nextest run transformers::transform_try_resolve::tests\n# review snapshot\n$ cargo insta review\n```\n\nRun Coverage.\n\n```bash\n$ cargo codecov\n$ cargo codecov --html && open target/llvm-cov/html/index.html\n```\n\nUse `just fmt` to format the code.\nUse `just lint` to check the code style.\n\nUpgrade dependencies if you need.\n\n```bash\n$ cargo upgrade\n$ cargo upgrade --incompatible\n$ cargo upgrade --dry-run\n```\n\nBenchmark with-antd example.\n\n```bash\n$ cargo build --release\n$ time ./target/release/mako examples/with-antd\n# or using hyperfine\n$ hyperfine --runs 10 \"./target/release/mako examples/with-antd\"\n```\n\nBenchmark three10x.\n\n```bash\n$ just setup-bench\n# default: --baseline master --case tmp/three10x --warmup 3 --runs 10\n$ just bench\n$ just bench --multiChunks\n$ just bench --baseline v0.4.4\n$ just bench --baseline v0.4.4 --case examples/with-antd\n$ just bench --no-build\n```\n\nPerformance analysis with puffin.\n\n```bash\n$ cargo build --release --features profile\n$ ./target/release/mako examples/normal --mode=production\n```\n\nPerformance analysis with [Xcode instruments](https://help.apple.com/instruments/mac).\n\n- Install Xcode App from Mac AppStore and switch xcode dev tool with:\n\n```bash\n$ sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer\n```\n\n- Install [cargo-instruments](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-instruments) with:\n\n```bash\n$ cargo install cargo-instruments\n\n# see instruments template:\n$ cargo instruments --list-templates\n```\n\n- capture instruments trace with:\n\n```bash\n$ cargo instruments -t sys --profile release-debug --package mako --bin mako examples/with-antd\n```\n\n- you can open the trace file with instruments again with:\n\n```bash\n$ open target/instruments/mako_System-Trace_xxx.trace\n```\n\nUse mako in umi or bigfish.\n\n```bash\n$ OKAM=/PATH/TO/umijs/marko/packages/bundler-mako/index.js umi build\n$ OKAM=/PATH/TO/umijs/marko/packages/bundler-mako/index.js umi dev\n$ OKAM=/PATH/TO/umijs/marko/packages/bundler-mako/index.js max build\n$ OKAM=/PATH/TO/umijs/marko/packages/bundler-mako/index.js bigfish build\n```\n\nPerformance analysis with [Xcode instruments](https://help.apple.com/instruments/mac) in umi or bigfish.\n\n```bash\n$ XCODE_PROFILE=1 OKAM=/PATH/TO/umijs/marko/packages/bundler-mako/index.js umi build\n$ XCODE_PROFILE=1 OKAM=/PATH/TO/umijs/marko/packages/bundler-mako/index.js umi dev\n$ XCODE_PROFILE=1 OKAM=/PATH/TO/umijs/marko/packages/bundler-mako/index.js max build\n$ XCODE_PROFILE=1 OKAM=/PATH/TO/umijs/marko/packages/bundler-mako/index.js bigfish build\n```\n\n## Release\n\nBefore release, please make sure everything is ok.\n\n```bash\n$ just ready\n```\n\nOpen https://github.com/umijs/mako/actions?query=branch%3Amaster+event%3Apush to checkout the latest master push action with name \"node-bind-build\", and download the artifacts to packages/mako directory. If the artifacts has no commit hash in the name, you should add the commit hash manually.\n\n```bash\n$ git rev-parse HEAD\n```\n\nThen you can release the new version.\n\n```\n# Release @umijs/mako and @umijs/bundler-mako\n$ npm run release\n```\n\nAfter release, you must do 2 things:\n\n- Release the new version on github\n- Update the changelog in CHANGELOG.md and CHANGELOG_zh-CN.md\n"
