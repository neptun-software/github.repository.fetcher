more methods and fields have been deprecated in order to make an easier upgrade path to 0.13.\n\nThese deprecation messages include a migration path, it is recommended to go one by one using `cargo check` and migrate each warning to reduce the burden migrating to 0.13. Following is a list of the deprecation PRs and the justification for these changes.\n\n- ([#2791](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/pull/2791)) The `Channel::is_nsfw` method was wrong, useless, and served better by `GuildChannel::nsfw`\n- ([#2794](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/pull/2794)) These cache methods needed arcane borrow checker dances internally, and obscure the simplicity of the cache.\n- ([#2816](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/pull/2816)) `Member::highest_role_info` is now strictly less powerful than the new `Guild::member_highest_role` and can avoid a cache lookup if used correctly.\n- ([#2825](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/pull/2825))\n- - `Guild::is_large` is less accurate than `Guild::large`\n- - `Message::is_own` is super simple to implement yourself\n- - `Message::is_private` simply checks if `Message::guild_id` is `none`.\n- ([#2838](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/pull/2838)) `Event::PresencesReplace` does not exist, and is a relic from when serenity supported user accounts.\n- ([#2861](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/pull/2861)) `TeamMember::permissions` is always `[\"*\"]`, so is useless.\n\n### Other notable changes\n\n- ([#2790](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/pull/2790])) Added `CreateMessage::enforce_nonce`, to prevent sending duplicate messages.\n- ([#2801](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/pull/2801)) Added `EditProfile::banner`, allowing banners to be set for bots.\n- ([#2810](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/pull/2810)) Added `ChannelId::get_thread_member`.\n- ([#2812](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/pull/2812)) Added `Guild::partial_member_permissions_in`, which can be used to avoid fetching a `Member` in message events just to check permissions.\n- ([#2819](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/pull/2819)) Added `From<User>` for `CreateEmbedAuthor`, setting the author name and icon to the `User`'s info.\n- ([#2813](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/pull/2813)) Added `UserId::direct_message`, so you don't need a full `User` to direct message.\n- ([#2834](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/pull/2834)) Added `Http::default_allowed_mentions` to set the `AllowedMentions` to be used with every request.\n- ([#2830](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/pull/2830)) Added `Guild`(`Id`)`::bulk_ban`, allowing bulk banning without hitting rate limits.\n- ([#2836](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/pull/2836)) Added support for **Message Polls**, including reading and sending them.\n- ([#2807](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/pull/2807)) Added support for **User Apps**, alllowing user-installable application commands.\n- ([#2882](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/pull/2882)) Added support for super reactions.\n- Many documentation fixes and other optimisations to improve memory and CPU usage.\n\n## [0.12.1] - 2024-02-28\n\nThanks to the following for their contributions:\n\n- [@arqunis]\n- [@GnomedDev]\n- [@jamesbt365]\n- [@kangalio]\n- [@logand22]\n- [@mkrasnitski]\n- [@SenseiHiraku]\n- [@vaporoxx]\n- [@vidhanio]\n- [@Xaeroxe]\n- [@yanorei32]\n\n### Notable changes\n\nIn this release, **the standard framework has been deprecated**\n([#2733](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/pull/2733)).\n\nAs Discord continues to endorse and evolve application commands (`/...`\ncommands, user commands, message commands, etc.), the standard framework\nbecomes increasingly outdated. Bots are also steadily losing (and already have\nlost) access to contents of messages, making it difficult to build a\nprefix-only bot. Unless you plan on restricting your bot to only accept\ncommands in DMs, allowing its presence in only fewer than 100 guilds, or\npresenting a reasonable justification to Discord for permission to continue\nusing message contents, you should migrate to application commands. We\nrecommend [poise](https://github.com/serenity-rs/poise), which supports writing\nboth prefix and application commands with a `#[command]` macro like the\nstandard framework.\n\n#### Why not just update the framework?\n\nPoise already exists and is better than the standard framework. Efforts should\nbe directed at improving poise instead. To support application commands would\nrequire an overhaul of the standard framework, as they are special (for\ninstance, Discord parses arguments on behalf of the bot and passes them as\nstructured data, whereas for prefix commands, the bot must parse by itself).\n\n### Smaller, but still notable changes\n\n* ([#2621](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/pull/2621)) Add a temporary cache for messages.\n* ([#2649](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/pull/2649)) Deprecate `RoleId::to_role_cached` - Use `Guild::roles` instead.\n* ([#2726](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/pull/2726)) Pack bitflags - Reduces alignments of `bitflags!` types, resulting in a smaller memory footprint.\n* ([#2696](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/pull/2696)) Support attachments in forum posts.\n* ([#2560](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/pull/2560)) Add support for monetization APIs.\n* ([#2648](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/pull/2648)) Deprecate inefficient Emoji helpers - Use the emoji methods on `GuildId`/`Guild` instead.\n\n## [0.12.0] - 2023-11-27\n\nThis release turned out to be one of serenity's largest ever, with well over 300 PRs in total! It contains quite a few major breaking changes to the API. Therefore, the changelog for this release also serves as a migration guide for users upgrading from the 0.11 series.\n\nThanks to the following for their contributions:\n\n- [@arqunis]\n- [@alakhpc]\n- [@AngelOnFira]\n- [@Bloectasy]\n- [@campbellcole]\n- [@cheesycod]\n- [@crivasr]\n- [@darkyeg]\n- [@fenhl]\n- [@GnomedDev]\n- [@jamesbt365]\n- [@Joshument]\n- [@kangalio]\n- [@Kneemund]\n- [@LaytonGB]\n- [@marcantoinem]\n- [@Miezhiko]\n- [@Milo123459]\n- [@mkrasnitski]\n- [@nickelc]\n- [@oSumAtrIX]\n- [@Ruthenic]\n- [@Sergiovan]\n- [@skreborn]\n- [@StckOverflw]\n- [@tatsuya6502]\n- [@tazz4843]\n- [@vaporoxx]\n- [@Xaeroxe]\n\n### Builders\n\nThe closure-based API for constructing requests using the builder pattern has been ripped out and replaced. In place of closures, users must now pass in builder types directly. For example, in serenity 0.11, code like the following was very common:\n\n```rust\nlet channel = guild\n    .create_channel(&http, |c| c.name(\"my-test-channel\").kind(ChannelType::Text))\n    .await?;\n```\n\nNow, users instead write the following code:\n\n```rust\nlet builder = CreateChannel::new(\"my-test-channel\").kind(ChannelType::Text);\nlet channel = guild.create_channel(&http, builder).await?;\n```\n\nOr, inline like so:\n\n```rust\nlet channel = guild\n    .create_channel(&http, CreateChannel::new(\"my-test-channel\").kind(ChannelType::Text))\n    .await?;\n```\n\nNote that in this particular example, the channel name is now a mandatory field that must be passed in when constructing the builder. Mutating the builder with subsequent calls to `CreateChannel::name` will change the underlying value. Additionally, all methods on builders now take `mut self` and return `Self`, instead of taking and returning `&mut self`/`&mut Self`. This allows for explicit construction as in the second example above. Also, builders no longer wrap a `pub HashMap<&'static str, T>`; the hashmap has been flattened into concrete private fields.\n\nSome benefits to this new approach to builders are:\n\n 1. Because every closure has a type unique to it, each call to a method taking a closure would be monomorphized separately, resulting in binary bloat. This is no longer the case.\n 2. Builders can be constructed once and then cloned and re-used multiple times.\n 3. Enforcement of field requirements (as dictated by the Discord API docs) provides compile-time request validation.\n\n### Attachments\n\n* The `AttachmentType` enum has been replaced with a `CreateAttachment` builder struct. This struct has the `file`, `path`, and `url` constructors that eagerly evaluate the data passed to them - `CreateAttachment` simply stores the resulting raw data. This is in contrast to `AttachmentType` which lazily carried filepaths/urls with it, and had `data` and `filename` methods for resolving them. Additionally, the `CreateAttachment::to_base64` method can be used to manually encode an attachment if needed.\n* A new `EditAttachments` builder struct has been added for use with the `attachments` method on the `EditMessage`, `EditWebhookMessage`, and `EditInteractionResponse` builders. This new builder provides finer control when editing a message's existing attachments or uploading additional ones. Also, the following methods have been renamed to more accurately reflect their behavior:\n\n| serenity v0.11 | serenity v0.12 |\n| --- | --- |\n| `EditMessage::attachment` | `EditMessage::new_attachment` |\n| `EditMessage::add_existing_attachment` | `EditMessage::keep_existing_attachment` |\n| `EditWebhookMessage::clear_existing_attachments` | `EditWebhookMessage::clear_attachments` |\n| `EditInteractionResponse::clear_existing_attachments` | `EditInteractionResponse::clear_attachments` |\n\n### Collectors\n\nCollectors have been redesigned and simplified at no cost to expressibility. There is now a generic `collector::collect` function which takes a closure as argument, letting you filter events as they stream in.\n* The specific collectors (`ComponentInteractionCollector`, `ModalInteractionCollector`, `MessageCollector`, and `ReactionCollector`) are simply convenience structs that wrap this underlying function.\n* `EventCollector` is now deprecated, as its use usually involved anti-patterns around fallibility. However, its functionality can still be replicated using `collector::collect`. See [example 10](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/blob/6ce990c79e893bbaa629d83527200d98330274a2/examples/e10_collectors/src/main.rs) for more details.\n* The `RelatedId` and `RelatedIdsForEventType` types have been removed as they were only used by `EventCollector`. Methods for retrieving them from events have also been removed; if users wish to extract \"related\" ids from an event, they should do so directly from the event's fields. The removed methods are the following:\n    - `Event::user_id`\n    - `Event::guild_id`\n    - `Event::channel_id`\n    - `Event::message_id`\n    - `EventType::related_ids`\n\n### Commands\n\nIn an effort to shorten long names and make import paths less unwieldy, Serenity now uses `command` instead of `application_command` in all places, except for the `Permissions::USE_APPLICATION_COMMANDS` constant. This includes methods on the `Http`, `GuildId`, `Guild`, `PartialGuild`, and `Command` types, as well as a few other miscellaneous places:\n\n| serenity v0.11 | serenity v0.12 |\n| --- | --- |\n| `Http::*_{global,guild}_application_command*` | `Http::*_{global,guild}_command*` |\n| `{GuildId,Guild,PartialGuild}::*_application_command*` | `{GuildId,Guild,PartialGuild}::*_command*` |\n| `Command::*_global_application_command*` | `Command::*_global_command*` |\n| `Interaction::application_command` | `Interaction::command` |\n| `EventHandler::application_command_permissions_update` | `EventHandler::command_permissions_update` |\n| `Route::ApplicationCommand*` | `Route::Command*` |\n| `Permissions::use_application_commands` | `Permissions::use_commands` |\n\nAdditionally, the following command types have been renamed:\n| serenity v0.11 | serenity v0.12 |\n| --- | --- |\n| `CreateApplicationCommand` | `CreateCommand` |\n| `CreateApplicationCommandOption` | `CreateCommandOption` |\n| `CreateApplicationCommandPermissionData` | `CreateCommandPermission` |\n| `CreateApplicationCommandPermissionsData` | `EditCommandPermissions` |\n| `CommandPermission` | `CommandPermissions` |\n| `CommandPermissionData` | `CommandPermission` |\n\nFurthermore, the methods on `CreateCommandPermission`, such as `new`, `kind`, etc. have been replaced with constructors for each type of permission, e.g. `role`, `user`, `channel`, etc., to avoid a possible mismatch between `kind` and the id that gets passed in.\n\nFinally, the `{GuildId,Guild,PartialGuild}::create_command_permission` method has been renamed to `edit_command_permission` to more accurately reflect its behavior.\n\n### Cache\n\n* Cache methods now return a `CacheRef` type that wraps a reference into the cache. Other methods that returned a map, now return a wrapper type around a reference to the map, with a limited API to prevent accidental deadlocks. This all helps reduce the number of clones when querying the cache. Those wishing to replicate the old behavior can simply call `.clone()` on the return type to obtain the wrapped data.\n* `CacheSettings` has new fields `time_to_live`, `cache_guilds`, `cache_channels`, and `cache_users`, allowing cache configuration on systems with memory requirements; whereas previously, memory-constrained systems were forced to disable caching altogether.\n* Caching for `PrivateChannel`s (aka DM channels) has been removed, as they are never sent across the gateway by Discord. Therefore, the `Cache::{private_channel, private_channels}` methods have been removed, and `Cache::guild_channel` has been renamed to just `Cache::channel`. Additionally, some uses of the `Channel` enum in return types have been replaced with either `GuildChannel` or `PrivateChannel` as seen fit.\n\n### IDs\n\nAll `*Id` types have had their internal representations made private. Therefore, the API has changed as follows:\n\n| serenity v0.11 | serenity v0.12 |\n| --- | --- |\n| `ExampleId(12345)` | `ExampleId::new(12345)` |\n| `example_id.as_u64()` | `example_id.get()` |\n\nNote that all `*Id` types now implement `Into<u64>` and `Into<i64>`. Additionally, attempting to instantiate an id with a value of `0` will panic.\n\nAlso, the implementations of `FromStr` for the `UserId`, `RoleId`, and `ChannelId` types now expect an integer rather than a mention string. The following table shows the new expected input strings:\n\n| | serenity v0.11 | serenity v0.12 |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `ChannelId` | `<#81384788765712384>` | `81384788765712384` |\n| `RoleId` | `<@&136107769680887808>` | `136107769680887808` |\n| `UserId` | `<@114941315417899012>` or `<@!114941315417899012>` | `114941315417899012` |\n\nUsers wishing to parse mentions should either parse into a `Mention` object, or use the `utils::{parse_user_mention, parse_role_mention, parse_channel_mention}` methods.\n\n### Interactions\n\nThe various interaction types have been renamed as follows:\n\n| serenity v0.11 | serenity v0.12 |\n| --- | --- |\n| `ApplicationCommandInteraction` | `CommandInteraction` |\n| `MessageComponentInteraction` | `ComponentInteraction` |\n| `ModalSubmitInteraction` | `ModalInteraction` |\n\nMethod names on interaction types have been shortened in the following way:\n\n| serenity v0.11 | serenity v0.12 |\n| --- | --- |\n| `create_interaction_response` | `create_response` |\n| `create_followup_message` | `create_followup` |\n| `delete_original_interaction_response` | `delete_response` |\n| `delete_followup_message` | `delete_followup` |\n| `edit_original_interaction_response` | `edit_response` |\n| `edit_followup_message` | `edit_followup` |\n| `get_interaction_response` | `get_response` |\n| `get_followup_message` | `get_followup` |\n\n* `AutocompleteInteraction` has been merged into `CommandInteraction`, along with its corresponding methods.\n* The `kind` field has been removed from each of the interaction structs.\n* A `quick_modal` method has been added to `CommandInteraction` and `ComponentInteraction`. See the docs for more details.\n\n### Framework\n\nThe standard framework is now configurable at runtime, as the `configure` method now takes `self` by reference. In line with the builder changes, the `Configuration` and `BucketBuilder` builders are no longer closure-based and must be passed in directly. Also, the `Framework` trait has been reworked to accomodate more use cases than just text commands:\n* The `dispatch` method now takes a `FullEvent` as argument instead of just a `Message`. This enum contains all the data that is passed to the `EventHandler`.\n* An optional `init` method has been added, that allows for more complex framework initialization, which can include executing HTTP requests, or accessing cache or shard data.\n\nAs a result, the trait now accomodates alternative frameworks more easily, such as [poise](https://github.com/serenity-rs/poise).\n\n### Gateway\n\n* Renamed `WsStream` to `WsClient`.\n* The `ShardManagerMonitor` and `ShardManagerMessage` types have been removed. Their functionality has been replicated via methods directly on `ShardManager`. Any fields with type `Sender<ShardManagerMessage>`, as well as the `Client::shard_manager` field, have had their types changed to `Arc<ShardManager>`. The new methods on `ShardManager` are the following:\n    - `return_with_value`\n    - `shutdown_finished`\n    - `restart_shard`\n    - `update_shard_latency_and_stage`\n* The `ShardClientMessage` and `InterMessage` enums were deemed redundant wrappers around `ShardRunnerMessage` and removed - users should use `ShardRunnerMessage` directly instead.\n* The `ShardManagerError` type is removed in favor of `GatewayError`.\n* Serenity's handling of gateway heartbeats has been made more accurate and type safe as follows:\n    - Removed `Shard::heartbeat_instants`. Users should instead use the `last_heartbeat_{sent,ack}` methods, which now return `Option<Instant>` instead of `Option<&Instant>`.\n    - Changed `Shard::heartbeat_interval` to return `Option<Duration>` instead of `Option<u64>`.\n    - Rename `Shard::check_heartbeat` to `do_heartbeat`.\n* `ShardMessenger::new` now takes `&ShardRunner` as argument instead of `Sender<ShardRunnerMessage>`.\n* Removed the `ShardRunnerMessage::AddCollector` variant in favor of the `ShardMessenger::add_collector` method. This method adds the collectors immediately, whereas `ShardRunnerMessage` is polled periodically in a loop - this could occasionally cause collectors to drop the first event they received.\n* All remaining types found at `serenity::client::bridge::{gateway,voice}::*` have been moved into `serenity::gateway`. They are now gated behind the `gateway` feature instead of the `client` feature, however most users use these features in conjunction, and so should not see a change in required-enabled features.\n\n### MSRV\nSerenity now uses Rust edition 2021, with an MSRV of Rust 1.74.\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\n#### Added\n\n* [#1923](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/pull/1923), [#2465](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/pull/2465) - Add a `thread_id` parameter to `Http::{get,edit,delete}_webhook_message`, `Http::execute_webhook}`, as well as `Webhook::{get,delete}_message`.\n* [#2104](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/pull/2104), [#2105](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/pull/2105) - Add an `audit_log_reason` parameter to many `Http` methods and builder structs.\n* [#2164](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/pull/2164) - Add `EventHandler::shards_ready` method.\n* [#2186](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/pull/2186), [#2201](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/pull/2201) - Add support for having a bot interactions endpoint URL.\n* [#2215](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/pull/2215) - Implement `Default` for many model types.\n* [#2233](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/pull/2233) - Add `button` and `select_menu` methods to the following builders:\n    - `CreateInteractionResponseMessage`\n    - `CreateInteractionResponseFollowup`\n    - `EditInteractionResponse`\n    - `CreateMessage`\n    - `EditMessage`\n    - `EditWebhookMessage`\n    - `ExecuteWebhook`\n* [#2247](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/pull/2247), [#2357](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/pull/2357), [#2385](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/pull/2385) - Add support for forum channels and creating forum posts using `ChannelId::create_forum_post` and `GuildChannel::create_forum_post`.\n* [#2257](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/pull/2257) - Add support for multiple event handlers by replacing the `event_handler` and `raw_event_handler` fields with pluralized `event_handlers` and `raw_event_handlers` in the following structs:\n    - `ShardManagerOptions`\n    - `ShardQueuer`\n    - `ShardRunner`\n    - `ShardRunnerOptions`\n    - `ClientBuilder`\n* [#2273](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/pull/2273), [#2367](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/pull/2367) - Add events `ReactionRemoveEmoji` and `GuildAuditLogEntryCreate`.\n* [#2276](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/pull/2276) - Add support for automod regex patterns.\n* [#2297](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/pull/2297) - Add the `serenity::all` module, which re-exports most public items in the crate.\n* [#2336](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/pull/2336) - Add a `CreateButton::custom_id` method.\n* [#2369](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/pull/2369) - Add support for editing a guild's MFA level using `{GuildId, Guild, PartialGuild}::edit_mfa_level`.\n* [#2391](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/pull/2391) - Add attachments support to the `EditWebhookMessage` endpoint by adding a `new_attachments` parameter to `Http::edit_webhook_message`, as well as the following methods to the `EditWebhookMessage` builder:\n    - `attachment`\n    - `add_existing_attachment`\n    - `remove_existing_attachment`\n* [#2415](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/pull/2415), [#2461](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/pull/2461) - Add support for Discord's new usernames by adding the `User::global_name` field, and by making discriminators on usernames optional and non-zero.

Serenity now leverages `async` functions, thanks to the `tokio` runtime.\n\nA big thanks goes to [@Lakelezz]. Without the dedication to her efforts, it wouldn't have been possible to make the switch easily.\n\n# Release candidate\n\nAs that is a huge change, among other changes, this is actually a *testing release*. It is encouraged to consumers of this release to provide feedback for any warts you might encounter, be it missing features, or bugs. One important bug is the OOM bug. After a period of time has passed since the bot connected, there might be a big random spike in memory usage, prompting the OOM killer to shutdown the bot's process. It is unknown where the spike comes from, or when exactly does it occur. It doesn't happen to every bot either. If you find your bot suddenly using a lot of memory, or being killed, please let us know by opening an Issue.\n\nThanks to the following for their contributions:\n\n- [@acdenisSK]\n- [@asherkin]\n- [@bdashore3]\n- [@DimiDimit]\n- [@jmgao]\n- [@Lakelezz]\n- [@MaxOhn]\n- [@mendess]\n- [@mjsir911]\n- [@mysteriouspants]\n- [@NieDzejkob]\n- [@NilsIrl]\n- [@vicky5124]\n- [@Th3-M4jor]\n- [@tverghis]\n\n### Added\n\n- [model] Add `nick` field to `PartialMember` ([@asherkin]) [c:28f9f8a]\n- [model] Add teams support ([@vicky5124]) [c:5a6979a]\n- [model] Add `mentions_current_user` helper ([@mysteriouspants]) [c:e049bc1]\n- [model/client] Add the `nonce` field to `GuildMembersChunk` and the event handler ([@mjsir911]) [c:614f99a]\n- [voice] Add `self_stream` field to `VoiceState` ([@DimiDimit]) [c:c60f397]\n- [model] Add a method to retrieve a webhook's URL ([@vicky5124]) [c:5931d1c]\n- [model] Add a method to retrieve a link to a message ([@acdenisSK]) [c:a92ca08]\n- [command_attr] Add the delimiters option to the documentation ([@acdenisSK]) [c:1594a3e]\n- [model] Add pagination for CurrentUser::guilds ([@NilsIrl]) [c:9eadffa]\n- [model] Add methods to disconnect a member from a voice channel ([@mendess]) [c:4e8e40b]\n- [model] Add `GuildId::name()` ([@tverghis]) [c:d99bee9]\n\n### Changed\n\n- [misc] Update rustls dependency to 0.18 ([@acdenisSK]) [c:3dda20d]\n- [all] Serenity.await ([@Lakelezz]) [c:5df4c6d]\n- [misc] Address the renaming of the lavalink project ([@acdenisSK]) [c:802df92]\n- [utils] Replace the in-house typemap implementation with `typemap_rev` ([@bdashore3]) [c:c1c7300]\n- [misc] Apply copyright to all people who have contributed to Serenity ([@acdenisSK]) [c:287245a]\n- [model] Make `Message::reply` take a content implementing `std::fmt::Display` ([@vicky5124]) [c:00683ef]\n- [framework] Expose CustomisedHelpData fields, improve help strikethrough message attributes.

[They disabled the account of a discord.js developer because they were allegedly \"underage\" (below 13 years old)](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/issues/3440). There were credit card transactions to defend their innocence, but Discord argued that they need a photo of their face to properly verify their age, a request the developer declined to comply. Consequently, they chose to no longer be on Discord.\n\nRecently, they did the same thing to [@Lakelezz], a huge contributor to Serenity. However, this time they did not state their exact reason, simply saying \"in violation of the ToS\". Just like the JS developer, she decided to stop affiliating herself with the platform, if this is how it presents its \"gratitude\" towards her.

The `Context` now carries instances to them, and as such, all functions that had used the cache and http before, now accept the context as their first parameter in order to operate. *Passing the fields present on the context is acceptable too.*\n\nThe framework had been swayed off of builders, and proselytised to procedural, macro-based attributes.\nGiving options to your commands might have looked like this:\n\n```rust\ncommand!(foo(ctx, msg, args) {\n    ...\n});\n\nframework.command(\"foo\", |c|\n   c.description(\"I am foobar\")\n       .min_args(1)\n       .max_args(2)\n       .usage(\"#foo bar baz\")\n       .cmd(foo));\n```\n\nBut now, it will be:\n\n```rust\n#[command] // Marks this function as a command.\n#[description = \"I am foobar\"] // These are the \"parameter\" attributes, for providing the options to the attribute macro.\n#[min_args(1)]\n#[max_args(2)]\n#[usage(\"#foo bar baz\")]\nfn foo(ctx: &mut Context, msg: &Message, args: Args) -> CommandResult {\n    ...\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\nThe same happened to creating groups, but with `macro!` style flavour, which have become a compulsory step in registering your commands:\n\n```rust\ngroup!({\n    name: \"fizzbuzz\",\n    options: {\n        prefix: \"fezz\",\n        ...\n    },\n    commands: [foo],\n});\n```\n\nAll `.command`s and `.on`s are thus replaced with simple calls to `.group`:\n\n```rust\nframework.group(&FIZZBUZZ_GROUP); // !\n```\n\n! - procedural macros are functions that accept Rust code, return Rust code. The Rust code that the `#[command]` (and similarly, `group!`) macro generates is the function you supplied it with, and a `static` instance of options that you've configured the command with. The static is assigned a suffixed, all uppercase version of the function’s name (or in the case of `group!`,  of the `name` field). Hence this weird identifier from nowhere.\n\n# Book\n\nTo help new (and existing) users familiarise themselves with the library better, we have decided to write a book similar to one of Rust's official learning material to the language, [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch00-00-introduction.html).\n\nIt's no ready yet, but we hope that on its release that it will clear misunderstandings (if any), explain the why and how of the library and put you in the right direction of Discord bot making!\n\n## Added\n\n- [builder/model] Permit sending files through the `CreateMessage` builder.

2018-01-20\n\nThis release is a rewrite of the client and gateway internals with a minimal\namount of breaking changes for userland code. These changes are mainly to\nprepare for Tokio and to reduce the number of atomic operations per received\nevent, reducing the number of atomic operations by roughly 85%. The framework\nhas also seen a rewrite, and is now centered around a trait-based design.\n\nThanks to the following for their contributions:\n\n- [@acdenisSK]\n- [@Caemor]\n- [@ConcurrentMarxistGC]\n- [@drklee3]\n- [@fenhl]\n- [@Flat]\n- [@ftriquet]\n- [@hsiW]\n- [@indiv0]\n- [@jhelwig]\n- [@jkcclemens]\n- [@Lakelezz]\n- [@MOZGIII]\n- [@nabijaczleweli]\n- [@Roughsketch]\n- [@tahahawa]\n- [@thelearnerofcode]\n- [@timotree3]\n- [@zeyla]\n\n### Upgrade Path\n\nPer [c:91c8ec4], the `Guild::default_channel` and\n`Guild::default_channel_guarenteed` methods now return\n`Option<Arc<Mutex<GuildChannel>>>` instead of `Option<GuildChannel>`. This\navoids a clone. To access the channel, you just have to retrieve a read or write\nlock by doing `guild.default_channel()?.read()` or\n`guild.default_channel()?.write()`.\n\nPer [c:14b9222], there is a new `Member::default_channel()` function that\nreturns the default channel for the user. This no longer returns the channel\nwith the same ID as the guild itself, as this behaviour was changed by Discord.\nA member's \"default channel\" is now the top-most channel that it has permission\nto view. Accordingly, `Guild::default_channel` matches this behaviour.\n\nPer [c:93e0a42], the library now uses the `parking_lot` crate's `Mutex` and\n`RwLock` implementations over the stdlib's. `parking_lot`s implementations are\nmore efficient, do not poison due to lock drops on unwinding, and implement\neventual fairness.\n\nTo account for this, change all `Mutex` lock retrievals and `RwLock` read and\nwrite lock retrievals to not unwrap. `parking_lot`'s `Mutex::lock`,\n`RwLock::read`, and `RwLock::write` don't return Results, unlike the `stdlib`'s.\n\nPer [c:78c6df9], the `Guild::features` structfield is no longer a\n`Vec<Feature>`. Discord adds guild features over time, which can cause guilds\nwith those new features to fail in deserialization. Instead, we're\nfuture-proofing by making this a `Vec<String>`.\n\nPer [c:65e3279], the `CreateEmbed` builder's `field` and `fields` functions no\nlonger take a builder as the argument, and instead take 3 arguments. For\nexample, code like this:\n\n```rust\nchannel.send_message(|m| m\n    .embed(|e| e\n        .title(\"This is an embed\")\n        .field(|f| f\n            .name(\"Test field\")\n            .value(\"Test value\")\n            .inline(true))));\n```\n\nWould now be this:\n\n```rust\nchannel.send_message(|m| m\n    .embed(|e| e\n        .title(\"This is an embed\")\n        .field(\"Test field\", \"Test value\", true)))\n```\n\nPer [c:ad0dcb3], shards can no longer have their `afk` property set, as this was\na leftover from user account support. This removes the `afk` parameter of the\n`Context::set_presence` function, removal of the parameter from the\n`Shard::set_presence` function, and the `Shard::set_afk` function.\n\nPer [c:b328b3e], the `client::EventHandler` no longer prefixes all trait methods\nwith `on_`. An implementation that looks like this:\n\n```rust\nuse serenity::client::{Context, EventHandler};\nuse serenity::model::Message;\n\nstruct Handler;\n\nimpl EventHandler for Handler {\n    fn on_message(&self, _: Context, msg: Message) {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow looks like this:\n\n```rust\nuse serenity::client::{Context, EventHandler};\nuse serenity::model::channel::Message;\n\nstruct Handler;\n\nimpl EventHandler for Handler {\n    fn message(&self, _: Context, msg: Message) {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\n(a note on the `serenity::model::channel::Message` import later.)\n\nPer [c:b19b031], `Client::new` returns a `Result`, as it now creates some\nessential information on instantiation instead of deferring it to when a\nconnection is started. You can probably just unwrap this Result.\n\nPer [c:b8efeaf], [c:d5a9aa8], and [c:65233ad], the client and gateway internals\nhave been rebuilt to significantly reduce the number of atomic operations\n(upwards of ~85%). This means that retrieval of shard information (like the\nshard latency to the Discord gateway or the current connection status) are\nretrieved via the encompassing [`ShardManager`][0.5.0:ShardManager] located on\nthe client. This can be inserted into the client's `data` structfield if you\nneed to access that information in event or framework command handlers. See\n[this example][0.5.0:example-09] for more information. Additionally,\n`Context::quit` to shutdown the shard no longer exists; go through the\n`ShardManager` instead.\n\nPer [c:aad4744], the framework's `Args::list` function has been renamed to\n`Args::multiple` for consistency.\n\nPer [c:f10b9d7], [c:1fd652b], [c:0aa55a2], the framework has been reworked to\nbe trait-based; thus as per [c:f61816c], [c:4e20277], allowed more useful functionality to commands.\n\nPer [c:05f6ed4], the [client's close handle] has been removed, in favour of\ndoing so through the `ShardManager`.\n\nPer [c:8c9baa7], the `Guild::default_message_notifications`, `Guild::mfa_level`,\n`PartialGuild::default_message_notifications`, and `PartialGuild::mfa_level`\nstructfields are now enums to represent a stronger type, instead of `u64`s.\n\nPer [c:bcd16dd], the `model` module has been broken up: instead of a giant root\nmodule full of imports, types have been moved to where they fit. For example,\nthe `Message`, `Reaction`, and `Channel` structs are now in the `model::channel`\nmodule. The `RichInvite`, `Member`, `Role`, and `MfaLevel` types are now in\n`model::guild`. Refer to the commit message or the\n[`model` module docs][0.5.0:model] for more information.\n\nPer [c:be43836], the `http::HttpError` enum's `InvalidRequest` variant no longer\ngives just the HTTP status code of the response.

Instead of using `http::send_file` like so:\n\n```rust\nuse serde_json::Map;\nuse serenity::http;\nuse serenity::model::ChannelId;\nuse std::fs::File;\n\nlet channel_id = ChannelId(253635665344987136);\nlet filename = \"mr-sakamoto.png\";\nlet file = File::open(&format!(\"./img/{}\", filename))?;\nlet map = Map::<String, Value>::new();\n\nhttp::send_file(channel_id, file, filename, map)?;\n```\n\nInstead send an attachment of files, such as:\n\n```rust\nuse serde_json::Map;\nuse serenity::http;\nuse serenity::model::ChannelId;\nuse std::fs::File;\n\nlet channel_id = ChannelId(253635665344987136);\nlet files = vec![\n    (File::open(&format!(\"./img/{}\", filename))?, filename),\n];\nlet map = Map::<String, Value>::new();\n\nhttp::send_files(channel_id, files, map)?;\n```\n\nSimilar logic can be applied to shortcut methods which have been removed,\nnamely:\n\n- `Channel::send_file` (instead use `Channel::send_files`)\n- `ChannelId::send_file` (instead use `ChannelId::send_files`)\n- `Group::send_file` (instead use `Group::send_files`)\n- `GuildChannel::send_file` (instead use `GuildChannel::send_files`)\n- `PrivateChannel::send_file` (instead use `PrivateChannel::send_files`)\n\nInstead of using the now-removed `Channel::delete_messages` and\n`Channel::delete_permission`, use the inner channel's method:\n\n```rust\nuse serenity::model::{Channel, ChannelId};\n\nlet channel = ChannelId(253635665344987136).get()?;\nlet message_ids = vec![\n    MessageId(359845483356749825),\n    MessageId(359854838403694592),\n];\n\nif let Channel::Guild(c) = channel {\n    c.delete_messages(&message_ids)?;\n}\n```\n\nSimilar logic can be applied to `Channel::delete_permission`.\n\n`Member::find_guild` ended up being only a shortcut to the `Member::guild_id`\nstructfield. Instead of calling the `find_guild` method like\n`member.find_guild()`, instead access the structfield directly via\n`member.guild_id`.\n\nThe `model::permissions::{general, text, voice}` methods have been removed, as\nthey ended up being shortcuts to the `model::permissions::PRESET_GENERAL`,\n`model::permissions::PRESET_TEXT`, and `model::permissions::PRESET_VOICE`\nconstants, respectively.\n\nPer commit [c:ea432af], event handling is now done via implementing a trait.\nInstead of passing functions to the client directly like:\n\n```rust\nuse serenity::Client;\nuse std::env;\n\nlet mut client = Client::new(env::var(\"DISCORD_TOKEN\")?);\n\nclient.on_message(|ctx, msg| {\n    // code\n});\n```\n\nInstead implement the new EventHandler trait:\n\n```rust\nuse serenity::client::{Client, Context, EventHandler};\nuse serenity::model::Message;\n\nstruct Handler;\n\nimpl EventHandler for Handler {\n    fn on_message(&self, ctx: Context, msg: Message) {\n        // code\n    }\n}\n\nlet client = Client::new(env::var(\"DISCORD_TOKEN\")?);\n```\n\nPer commit [c:4f2e47f], the deprecated `ext` module (which has recently only\nbeen a series of re-exports for the `cache`, `framework`, and `voice` modules)\nwas removed. Instead of using `serenity::ext::cache` for example, use\n`serenity::cache`.\n\nPer commit [c:878684f], due to the concept of default channels being changed,\n`GuildId::as_channel_id` has been deprecated due to the fact that the ID of the\ndefault channel of a guild will no longer necessarily be the same as the guild's\nID.\n\nIf you require this _same exact functionality_ (the `GuildId` as a `ChannelId`),\nrewrite your code from:\n\n```rust\nuse serenity::model::GuildId;\n\nlet channel_id = GuildId(81384788765712384).as_channel_id();\n```\n\nto:\n\n```rust\nuse serenity::model::{ChannelId, GuildId};\n\nlet guild_id = GuildId(81384788765712384);\nlet channel_id = ChannelId(guild_id.0);\n```\n\nPer commits [c:2b053ea], [c:8cc2300], [c:8e29694], and [c:948b27c], custom\nframeworks can now be implemented, meaning that a built implementation is now\npassed instead of a base framework being provided and mutated. To use the old\nframework, modify code from:\n\n```rust\nuse serenity::Client;\nuse std::env;\n\nlet mut client = Client::new(&env::var(\"DISCORD_TOKEN\")?);\n\nclient.with_framework(|f| f\n    // method calls to mutate framework here\n);\n```\n\nto the new style:\n\n```rust\nuse serenity::client::{Client, EventHandler};\nuse serenity::framework::standard::StandardFramework;\nuse std::env;\n\nstruct Handler;\n\nimpl EventHandler for Handler { }\n\nlet mut client = Client::new(&env::var(\"DISCORD_TOKEN\")?, Handler);\n\nclient.with_framework(StandardFramework::new()\n    // method calls here to mutate framework here\n);\n```\n\nPer commit [c:fc9eba3d], if you were pattern matching on the\n`serenity::framework::DispatchError::CheckFailed` variant, instead either use or\nignore the matched data by rewriting code from:\n\n```rust\nuse serenity::framework::DispatchError;\n\n// Code to begin dispatch error handling here.\n\nmatch dispatch_error {\n    DispatchError::CheckFailed => {\n        // Handle operation here.\n    },\n    // Other variants.\n}\n```\n\nto:\n\n```rust\n// The standard implementation is now in a \"standard\" framework module, but\n// that's unrelated.\nuse serenity::framework::standard::DispatchError;\n\nmatch dispatch_error {\n    DispatchError::CheckFailed(_) => {\n        // Handle operation here.\n    },\n    // Other variants.\n}\n```\n\nPer commits [c:45d72ef], [c:03b6d78], and [c:d35d719], the framework's\n`command!` macro no longer parses arguments' types for you. You are now given an\n`Args` struct that you can retrieve arguments from and parse from to a requested\ntype that implements `FromStr`.\n\nFor example, a simple sum function that looked like:\n\n```rust\n#[macro_use] extern crate serenity;\n\ncommand!(sum(_ctx, msg, _args, x: i64, y: i64) {\n    let _ = msg.reply(&format!(\"Result: {}\", x + y));\n});\n```\n\nNow looks like:\n\n```rust\nuse serenity::client::Context;\nuse serenity::framework::standard::Args;\nuse serenity::model::Message;\n\nfn sum(_: &mut Context, msg: &Message, args: Args) -> Result<(), String> {\n    let x = match args.single::<i64>() {\n        Ok(x) => x,\n        Err(_) => return Ok(()),\n    };\n    let y = match args.single::<i64>() {\n        Ok(y) => y,\n        Err(_) => return Ok(()),\n    };\n\n    let _ = msg.reply(&format!(\"Result: {}\", x + y));\n}\n```\n\nPer commit [c:562ce49], `serenity::model::User`'s `FromStr` implementation can\nnow hit the REST API. No code changes required, but do note the possibility.\n\nPer commit [c:40031d9], the following routes have been removed for being userbot\nroutes, which are leftovers from when serenity supported them and had them\nremoved:\n\n- `http::get_application_info`\n- `http::get_applications`\n- `http::get_emoji`\n- `http::get_emojis`\n- `model::Guild::emoji`\n- `model::Guild::emojis`\n- `model::GuildId::emoji`\n- `model::GuildId::emojis`\n- `model::PartialGuild::emoji`\n- `model::PartialGuild::emojis`\n\nPer commit [c:092f288], bitflags has been upgraded, which introduces a minor\nchange in how to use permissions.\n\nUpdate code from:\n\n```rust\nuse serenity::model::permissions::{ADD_REACTIONS, MANAGE_MESSAGES};\n\nfoo(vec![ADD_REACTIONS, MANAGE_MESSAGES]);\n```\n\nto:\n\n```rust\nuse serenity::model::Permissions;\n\nfoo(vec![Permissions::ADD_REACTIONS, Permissions::MANAGE_MESSAGES]);\n```\n\n### Added\n\n- [framework] Make

[c:6c43fed]\n\n## [0.3.0] - 2017-06-24\n\nThis release contains a number of added methods, fixes, deprecations, and\ndocumentation improvements. It brings a module restructure and an upgrade to\nrust-websocket v0.20, hyper v0.10, and switching to `native-tls`, meaning\nusing an up-to-date rust-openssl v0.9 on Linux, schannel on Windows, and\nSecure Transport on Mac. The long-standing issue [#56][issue:56] was closed.\n\nThanks to the following for their contributions this release:\n\n- [@acdenisSK]\n- [@barzamin]\n- [@eLunate]\n- [@Flat]\n- [@fwrs]\n- [@hsiW]\n- [@Roughsketch]\n\n### Upgrade Path\n\nInvite retrieval functions now accept a `stats` argument. If you don't need\nstats, just pass `false`.\n\n`ChannelId::create_permission` and `GuildChannel::create_permission` now accept\na reference, as they do not need to own the overwrite.\n\nThe deprecated `GuildChannel` methods (`get_invites`, `get_message`,\n`get_messages`, `get_reaction_users`, `get_webhooks`) have been removed. Use\ntheir equivalents without the `get_` prefix.\n\nThe `send_file` functions have been deprecated. Use `send_files` instead by\npassing a Vec.\n\n`CurrentUser::distinct` and `User::distinct` have been deprecated. Instead use\n`CurrentUser::tag` and `User::tag`.\n\n`User::get` has been deprecated. Instead, use `UserId::get`.\n\n`Role::edit_role` has been deprecated, renaming it to `Role::edit`.\n\n`time` has been removed as a direct dependency, moving to `chrono`.\nPublic-facing fields that return `time::Timespec` or were a String in ISO-3339\nformat are now `chrono::DateTime<UTC>`s. Instead use its methods for what was\nbeing done with the `Timespec`s or strings.\n\n`User::direct_message` and `User::dm` now accept a builder to allow for more\ncomplete, yet simple use out of the methods. Instead of passing a `&str`, use\nthe provided builder:\n\n```rust\n// old\nuser.dm(\"hello\")?;\n\n// new\nuser.dm(|m| m.content(\"hello\"))?;\n```\n\n`Client::login` has been deprecated. Instead use `Client::new`:\n\n```rust\nuse serenity::Client;\nuse std::env;\n\n// old\nlet client = Client::login(&env::var(\"DISCORD_TOKEN\")?);\n\n// new\nlet client = Client::new(&env::var(\"DISCORD_TOKEN\")?);\n```\n\n`Member::guild_id` is now no longer an `Option<GuildId>` -- just a `GuildId`.\nSince this is now always present, `Member::find_guild` has been deprecated since\nthe cache now never searches the cache for the guild ID.\n\nThe deprecated `GuildChannel` methods `get_invites`, `get_message`,\n`get_messages`, `get_reaction_users`, and `get_webhooks` have been removed. Use\ntheir alternatives, such as `GuildChannel::invites`, instead.\n\n### Added\n\n- Add support for retrieving invites with counts ([@hsiW]) [c:302d771]\n- Handle message type 7 ([@fwrs]) [c:8f88c6b]\n- Add `GuildChannel::permissions_for` [c:6502ded]\n- Add `Invite::url()`, `RichInvite::url()` [c:3062981]\n- Reasonable derive Debug on all items [c:9dae9e6]\n- Add more examples and improve others [c:8c0aeac]\n- Support adding reactions when creating message ([@acdenisSK]) [c:77b5b48]\n- Add `VerificationLevel::Higher` [c:7dbae6b]\n- Add `CurrentUser::invite_url` ([@Roughsketch], [@Flat]) [c:e033ff3],\n  [c:0b95db9]\n- `impl From<char> for ReactionType` [c:2afab7c]\n- Implement multiple attachments ([@Flat]) [c:46b79dd]\n- Add `_line` + `_line_safe` methods to `MessageBuilder` ([@Roughsketch])\n  [c:543b604]\n- Add docs for `CurrentUser` ([@Roughsketch]) [c:921f7f4]\n- Add cache docs ([@Roughsketch]) [c:d367a70]\n- Add docs and tests for framework ([@Roughsketch]) [c:4267bdb]\n- Add `Content` for `MessageBuilder` ([@eLunate]) [c:060b06e]\n- Include more info on ratelimiting debugs [c:d37461b]\n- Add `User::refresh` [c:8c04d31]\n- Add some model docs ([@Roughsketch]) [c:c00f349]\n- Add `Message::channel()` [c:063a52f]\n- Add `CurrentUser::default_avatar_url` [c:2d09152]\n- Add `CurrentUser::face()`, `User::face()` [c:d033909]\n- Deserialize embed footers [c:e92b667]\n- Add `Member::permissions` [c:39a28d3] ([@acdenisSK])\n- Add `wait` parameter to `http::execute_webhook` [c:dc73d1a]\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Don't skip `@everyone` role when checking channel overwrites ([@Roughsketch])\n  [c:b468cbf]\n- Allow `unreachable_code` lint in `command!` macro ([@Flat]) [c:eb43b9c]\n- Fix incorrect attempted `send_file` deserialization [c:0102706]\n- Fix ratelimits causing 429s in certain situations [c:f695174]\n- Check last heartbeat acknowledged in heartbeater [c:ec9b1c7]\n- Make client join shards and return [c:175d3a3]\n- Make client starts return an error [c:858bbf2]\n- Ws read/write timeout after 90s to avoid infinite blocking [c:1700a4a]\n- Fix negative nonces failing to deserialize [c:d0b64cd]\n- Use HTTPS Connector with remaining HTTP functions [c:0d218e0] ([@Roughsketch])\n\n### Changed\n\n- Restructure modules [c:9969be6]\n- Change `create_permission` to take a reference [c:aea9885]\n- Remove deprecated `GuildChannel` methods [c:ab7f113]\n- `Guild::create_channel` doesn't require mutability [c:494cc50]\n- Deprecate `*User::distinct`, add `*User::tag` [c:6579b1f]\n- Deprecate `User::get` [c:afc571f]\n- Deprecate `Role::edit_role`, add `Role::edit` [c:c00f349]\n- Switch to chrono [c:990e611]\n- Make `User::direct_message`/`User::dm` accept a builder [c:11a02db]\n- Deprecate `Client::login`, add `Client::new` [c:7990381]\n- Make `Member::guild_id` non-optional [c:b4bd771]\n- Remove `Context::channel_id` and `Context::queue` [c:8b504ad]\n- Make the framework's `dynamic_prefix` accept an `&Message` [c:2845681]\n- Deprecate `Channel::delete_messages`, `Channel::delete_permission` [c:7fc49d8]\n- Make `Message::nonce` a `serde_json::Value` [c:c832009]\n\n### Misc.\n\n- Remove deprecated `login_bot` usage from docs ([@hsiW]) [c:ae395f4]\n- Fix call to `VoiceManager::join` in example 06 ([@barzamin]) [c:6853daf]\n- Sort default help by group/command names ([@Roughsketch]) [c:93416cd]\n- Move `CreateGroup` docs to the struct [c:71f3dbb]\n- Don't create group in help if no commands to show ([@Roughsketch]) [c:4f5fbb5]\n- Move user avatar method logic out [c:8360f32]\n- Upgrade rust-websocket and hyper, switch to native-tls [c:8f8a059]\n- Fix broken links in README [c:51c15d0]\n- Remove unused `cookie` dependency [c:92f4ec2]\n- Switch from `#[doc(hidden)]` to `pub(crate)` [c:32e07e4] ([@acdenisSK])\n- Re-export all errors from the prelude [c:db0f025]\n- Rework shard logic and shard handling [c:601704a]\n\n## [0.2.0] - 2017-05-13\n\nThis is a very large release with a number of rewritten components. The cache\nhas been rewritten to make use of memory more efficiently, the models directory\nhas been re-organized, structures are now deserialized via serde and\n`serde_derive` - instead of the custom decoding build script we had - with a\nnumber of bugfixes and other various changes and additions.\n\nThanks to the following for their contributions this release:\n\n- [@acdenisSK]\n- [@Flat]\n- [@fwrs]\n- [@hsiW]\n- [@Roughsketch]\n- [@sschroe]\n\n### Upgrade Path\n\nReplace uses of `ext::cache::ChannelRef` with `model::Channel`.\n\nThe following `ext::cache::Cache` method signatures are now encased in\n`Arc<RwLock>`s and should be handled appropriately:\n\n- `call`\n- `channel`\n- `guild`\n- `guild_channel`\n- `group`\n- `member`\n- `role`\n- `user`\n\nAdditionally, `GuildId::find` and `UserId::find` now return\n`Option<Arc<RwLock>>`s.\n\n`Member::display_name` now returns a `Cow<String>` instead of a `&str`.\n\n`client::Context` has had most of its methods removed. The methods were mostly\na copy of those on `ChannelId`. Upgrade by instead calling methods on\n`ChannelId`:\n\n```rust\ncommand!(foo(ctx) {\n    let _ = ctx.say(\"hello\");\n});\n\n// is now written as:\n\ncommand!(bar(_ctx, msg) {\n    let _ = msg.channel_id.say(\"hello\");\n});\n```\n\n`CreateMessage::nonce` has been removed. Instead, simply do not provide a nonce.\n\n`ChannelId::edit_message` now has an argument signature of:\n\n```rust\n&self, message_id: M, f: F\nwhere F: FnOnce(CreateMessage) -> CreateMessage, M: Into<MessageId>\n```\n\ninstead of\n\n```rust\n&self, message_id: M, text: &str, f: F\nwhere F: FnOnce(CreateEmbed) -> CreateEmbed, M: Into<MessageId>\n```\n\nTo account for this change, modify code like so:\n\n```rust\nchannel_id.edit_message(message_id, \"new content\", |e| e);\n\n// now:\n\nchannel_id.edit_message(message_id, |m| m.content(\"new content\"));\n```\n\n`Message::edit` has also had an argument signature updated to:\n\n```rust\n&mut self, f: F where F: FnOnce(CreateMessage) -> CreateMessage\n```\n\nfrom:\n\n```rust\n&mut self, new_content: &str, embed: F where F: FnOnce(CreateEmbed) -> CreateEmbed\n```\n\nTo account for this change, modify code like so:\n\n```rust\nmessage.edit(\"new content\", |e| e.description(\"test\"));\n\n// now:\n\nmessage.edit(|m| m.content(\"new content\").embed(|e| e.description(\"test\")));\n```\n\n`client::rest::accept_invite`, `Invite::accept`, and `RichInvite::accept` have\nbeen removed. Instead, do not attempt this, as they were userbot functions.\n\nSelfbot support has been completely removed. Review the\n[commit message][c:d9118c0] for the long list of details.\n\nGroup calls and guild sync have [also been removed][c:c74cc15]. Read the commit\nmessage for all the details.\n\nInstead of defining multiple separate error messages for command framework\nmessage dispatches, match the dispatch error in a single method:\n\n```rust\n// old code:\nclient.with_framework(|f| f\n    .configure(|c| c\n        .command_disabled_message(\"The command `%command%` was disabled\")\n        .blocked_guild_message(\"The owner of this guild has been blocked\")\n        .invalid_permission_message(\"You don't have permission to use this command\")));\n\n// new code:\nclient.with_framework(|f| f.on_dispatch_error(|_, msg, err| {\n    match err {\n        DispatchError::CommandDisabled(command_name) => {\n            let _ = msg.channel_id.say(&format!(\"The command `{}` was disabled\", command_name));\n        },\n        DispatchError::BlockedGuild => {\n            // this change also allows for more intelligent error messages:\n            if let Some(guild) = msg.guild() {\n                let owner_id = guild.read().unwrap().owner_id;\n\n                if let Some(user) = CACHE.read().unwrap().user(owner_id) {\n                    let c = format!(\"The owner - {} - has been blocked\", user.name);\n                    let _ = msg.channel_id.say(&c);\n\n                    return;\n                }\n            }\n\n            let _ = msg.channel_id.say(\"The owner of this guild has been blocked\");\n        },\n        DispatchError::LackOfPermissions(_) => {\n            let _ = msg.channel_id.say(\"You don't have permission to use this command\");\n        },\n    }\n}));\n```\n\nAll functions prefixed with `get_` have had the prefix removed. For example,\n`Guild::get_webhooks()` is now `Guild::webhooks()`.\n\nInstead of using `model::permissions::general()`, `model::permissions::text()`,\nand `model::permissions::voice()`, use\n`model::permissions::{PRESET_GENERAL, PRESET_TEXT, PRESET_VOICE}`.\n\n### Added\n\n- Add `say` method to `Group`, `GuildChannel`, `PrivateChannel` [c:a0bb306]\n- Add missing `send_file`/`send_message` impls [c:bad9ac3]\n- Add `Message::guild` [c:9ef5522]\n- Add Shard Id helpers [c:1561f9e]\n- Implement `From<&str> for ReactionType` [c:e7110ad]\n- Check for embed lengths on message sends [c:e1079e9]\n- Add `is_nsfw` check to channels [c:9268f9c]\n- Add missing `Member::kick` helper [c:83b1d96]\n- Derive `Eq`, `Hash`, `PartialEq` on `ReactionType` [c:86a4e00] ([@acdenisSK])\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Handle unsuccessful responses before decoding [c:7e254c5]\n- Uniquely ratelimit message deletions [c:01f6872]\n- Fix Member methods due to variant `joined_at` values [c:cd914f5]\n- Fix deadlock on channel create event for DMs [c:6b0b9b2] ([@sschroe])\n- Default to using `[0, 1]` shards [c:f0d1157]\n- Fix ratelimiting for `Route::None` routes [c:5bf6c2d]\n- Fix guild leaving result [c:ae352ea]\n- Fix permissions when sending to DMs or groups [c:404a089] ([@acdenisSK])\n- Check if message starts with `dynamic_prefix` result [c:9ec05e7] ([@Roughsketch])\n- Trim content before parsing framework args [c:e6712c9] ([@Roughsketch])\n\n### Changed\n\n- Optimize caching [c:0c9ec37]\n- Remove most `Context` methods [c:585af23]\n- Remove sending message nonces [c:9c04a19]\n- Standardize message editing methods [c:3c7c575]\n- Remove invite accepting [c:e4b484f]\n- Remove selfbot support [c:d9118c0] [c:c74cc15]\n- Switch to using serde for deserialization [c:f6b27eb]\n- Update the ways errors are handled in dispatch [c:31aae7d] ([@fwrs])\n- Deprecate methods prefixed with `get_` [c:3f03f9a]\n- Framework help commands now accept a slice of args [c:ff4437a]\n- Make `User.discriminator` a `u16` [c:0f41ffc]\n- Use constants for preset permissions [c:70d4e75]\n\n### Misc.\n\n- Make logo more better [c:6e11a10] ([@Flat])\n- Fix incorrect cache example [c:b96f85c]\n- Rework the models directory [c:9114963]\n- Change permission values to byte literals [c:c8536c1]\n- Fix example in README [c:d4fc8b6]\n\n## [0.1.5] - 2017-02-08\n\nThis is a release to fix broken nightly builds, due to a change in how rustc\nhandles lifetimes, with a few performance optimizations and other fixes.\n\n### Upgrade Path\n\nFor `Group::send_message`, `PrivateChannel::send_message`,\nand `GuildChannel::send_message`, instead of passing in only a `&str` of\ncontent, use a `CreateMessage` builder:\n\n```rust\n// assuming a `channel` is bound\n\n// old signature:\nchannel.send_message(\"hello\");\n\n// new signature:\nchannel.send_message(|m| m.content(\"hello\"));\n```\n\nInstead of calling `message_id.get_reaction_users` and passing in a `ChannelId`,\ncall `channel_id.get_reaction_users` and pass in the `MessageId`. Note that the\nlatter already existed.\n\n```rust\n// assuming `channel_id`, `message_id`, and `reaction_type` are bound\n\n// removed method:\nmessage_id.get_reaction_users(channel_id, reaction_type, Some(10), None);\n\n// alternative method:\nchannel_id.get_reaction_users(message_id, reaction_type, Some(10), None);\n```\n\n### Added\n\n- Register the `status` user setting for user accounts (e.g. online, invisible)\n  [c:0b9bf91]\n- Expose and document ratelimiting structures [c:eb09f2d]\n- Add method to `EditGuild` to transfer ownership [c:f00e165]\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fix potential unreachable pattern warning in `command!` macro [c:97f9bd1]\n- Fix value of 'browser' in shard identify [c:4cf8338]\n- Remove lifetime on Search builder [c:6f33a35]\n\n### Changed\n\n- Standardize methods for creating messages [c:c8c6b83]\n- Remove `MessageId::get_reaction_users` [c:268f356]\n\n### Misc.\n\n- Avoid re-requesting the gateway URL when autosharding (optimization)\n  [c:e891ebe]\n- Avoid cloning on non-framework message create events (opt.) [c:b7cbf75]\n- Avoid cloning the context on event dispatches (opt.) [c:5ee5fef]\n- Optimize presence update for current user in cache (opt.) [c:9392f61]\n- Make `GLOBAL` ratelimit mutex a unit (opt.) [c:55ccaca]\n- Resume when restarting WS sender/receiver [c:04cfaa9]\n\n\n## [0.1.4] - 2017-01-26\n\nThis is a general release for pretty much everything, from new features to\nbugfixes to a switch to a more OOP style. The current minimum supported version\nis rustc 1.13+.\n\nThe next release will be v0.2.0, which will feature serde codegen support along\nwith a rewrite of the framework. It will be a more modularized version of the\nlibrary. v0.2.0 will require rustc 1.15+, due to the stabilization of Macros\n1.1.\n\nThanks to the following for contributions this release:\n\n- [@acdenisSK]\n- [@bippum]\n- [@DeltaEvo]\n- [@emoticon]\n- [@foxbot]\n- [@fwrs]\n- [@hsiW]\n- [@indiv0]\n- [@SunDwarf]\n\nTwo of the major highlights of this release are that the broken pipe issue has\nbeen fixed, and the library is more OOP now and therefore no longer relies on\nthe `Context` to get stuff done. The `methods` feature flag has been removed.\n\n### Upgrade Path\n\nWhen formatting using `Display` for `ChannelId`s, `RoleId`s, and `UserId`,\ninstead of formatting use their `Mentionable` equivilants:\n\n```rust\nuse serenity::model::{ChannelId, RoleId, UserId};\n\n// old\nassert_eq!(format!(\"{}\", ChannelId(1)), \"<#1>\");\nassert_eq!(format!(\"{}\", RoleId(2)), \"<@&2>\");\nassert_eq!(format!(\"{}\", UserId(3)), \"<@3>\");\n\n// new\nassert_eq!(format!(\"{}\", ChannelId(1).mention()), \"<#1>\");\nassert_eq!(format!(\"{}\", RoleId(2)).mention()), \"<@&2>\");\nassert_eq!(format!(\"{}\", UserId(3).mention()), \"<@3>\");\n```\n\nWhen using `EmbedBuilder::{image, thumbnail}`, instead of calling another\nbuilder, provide `url`s directly:\n\n```rust\nuse serenity::model::Embed;\n\n// old\nEmbed::fake(|e| e\n    .image(|i| i.url(\"https://not.zey.moe/me.png\"))\n    .thumbnail(|t| t.url(\"https://not.zey.moe/me2.png\")));\n\n// new\nEmbed::fake(|e| e\n    .image(\"https://not.zey.moe/me.png\")\n    .thumbnail(\"https://not.zey.moe/me2.png\"));\n```\n\nWhen specifying a sharding method, instead of passing a `u8` for sharding info,\npass a `u64`:\n\n```rust\nuse serenity::Client;\n\nlet client = Client::login_bot(&env::var(\"DISCORD_TOKEN\").unwrap());\n\n// old\nclient.start_shard(1u8, 5u8); // or\nclient.start_shards(5u8); // or\nclient.start_shard_range([1u8, 3u8], 8u8);\n\n// new\nclient.start_shard(1u64, 5u64); // or\nclient.start_shards(5u64); // or\nclient.start_shard_range([1u64, 3u64], 8u64);\n```\n\n`Client.shards` is now private. Instead of accessing it, don't.\n\nWhen creating a `Colour` struct yourself, instead of specifying a single `value`\nfield, pass a single tuple value:\n\n```rust\nuse serenity::utils::Colour;\n\n// old\nColour {\n    value: 0,\n}\n\n// new\nColour(0);\n```\n\nInstead of using `Attachment::download_to_directory` to download an attachment\nto a directory, do it yourself:\n\n```rust\nuse std::fs::File;\nuse std::io::Write;\n\n// assuming an `attachment` has already been bound\n\n// old\nattachment.download_to_directory(\"./attachments\");\n\n// new\nlet bytes = attachment.download().unwrap();\nlet filepath: PathBuf = path.as_ref().join(&attachment.filename);\nlet mut f = File::create(&filepath);\nlet _ = f.write(&bytes);\n```\n\nInstead of calling `Message::is_webhook()`:\n\n```rust\n// assuming a `message` has already been bound\n\n// old\nlet _ = message.is_webhook();\n\n// new\nlet _ = message.webhook_id.is_some();\n```\n\nInstead of `PartialGuild::find_role(role_id)`:\n\n```rust\nuse serenity::model::RoleId;\n\n// assuming a `guild` has already been bound\n\n// old\nlet _ = guild.find_role(RoleId(1));\n\n// new\nlet _ = guild.roles.get(RoleId(1));\n```\n\nInstead of `Guild::{get_channel, get_member}`, call:\n\n```rust\nuse serenity::model::{ChannelId, UserId};\n\n// assuming a `guild` has already been bound\n\n// old\nlet _ = guild.get_channel(ChannelId(1));\nlet _ = guild.get_member(UserId(2));\n\n// new\nlet _ = guild.channels.get(ChannelId(1));\nlet _ = guild.members.get(UserId(2));\n```\n\nInstead of using `Context` methods, use their `Id` or other struct equivalents.\n\n### Added\n\n- the `voice` feature no longer requires the `cache` feature to be enabled\n  [c:7b45f16]\n- the `framework` feature no longer requires the `cache` feature to be enabled\n  [c:86cd00f]\n- `Guild`, `InviteGuild`, and `PartialGuild` now have `splash_url` methods\n  [c:d58c544]\n- Expose `Message::webhook_id` for messages

[c:6355288]\n- Framework: fix command cooldown timer (would always say to wait `i64::MAX`\n  seconds) [c:fafa363]\n- Framework: the `before` closure is now properly run when a message is sent by\n  the owner [c:760a47a]\n- `CurrentApplicationInfo` now properly decodes due to `flags` no longer being\n  sent [c:2a743ce]\n- Fix `Message::delete()` permission check [c:4229034]\n- Framework: properly

([@fwrs])\n  [c:fb07751]\n- Id display formatters use the direct u64 instead of mentioning;\n  `format!(\"{}\", UserId(7))` will format into `\"7\"` instead of `\"<@7>\"`\n  [c:933ee89]\n- Default the framework's `use_quotes` for quote parsing to `false` (was `true`)\n  [c:38a484d]\n- The `CreateEmbed` builder now has direct `image` and `thumbnail` methods\n  instead of one-method builders

help\ncommand.\n\nThanks to the following for contributions this release:\n\n- [@fwrs]\n\n### Upgrade Path\n\nNone.\n\n### Added\n\n- Blocking individual users and guilds in commands, add blocking commands, and\n  configuring owners of bots ([@fwrs]) [c:a39647d]\n\n### Fixed\n\n- The plain help command now properly sends a message when requesting\n  information about a command [c:7b4b154]\n\n### Misc.\n\n- Groups are now on their own lines in the plain help command [c:16bd765]\n\n## [0.1.2] - 2016-12-14\n\nThis release focuses on revamping the framework, adding a large amount of\nconfiguration and overall features. v0.1.3 will be focused on performance\noptimizations and code cleanup.\n\nThanks to the following for contributions this release:\n\n- [@acdenisSK]\n- [@fwrs]\n\nv0.1.2 can now be retrieved from the [crates.io listing].\n\n### Upgrade Path\n\nWhen using `EmbedBuilder::{image, thumbnail}`, instead of calling another\nbuilder, provide `url`s directly:\n\n```rust\nuse serenity::model::Embed;\n\n// old\nEmbed::fake(|e| e\n    .image(|i| i.url(\"https://not.zey.moe/me.png\"))\n    .thumbnail(|t| t.url(\"https://not.zey.moe/me2.png\")));\n\n// new\nEmbed::fake(|e| e\n    .image(\"https://not.zey.moe/me.png\")\n    .thumbnail(\"https://not.zey.moe/me2.png\"));\n```\n\n### Added\n\n- Allow

`try!`s have been converted to use `?` syntax ([@acdenisSK])\n  [c:f69512b]\n\n## [0.1.1] - 2016-12-05\n\nv0.1.1 is a \"features that v0.1.0 should have had\" and \"miscellaneous work\"\nrelease. v0.1.2 will be focused on the framework, while v0.1.3 will be focused\non performance optimizations.\n\nThanks to the following for contributions this release:\n\n- [@abalabahaha]\n- [@Flat]\n- [@fwrs]\n- [@GetRektByMe]\n- [@iCrawl]\n- [@indiv0]\n- [@khazhyk]\n- [@SunDwarf]\n\nv0.1.1 can now be retrieved from the [crates.io listing].\n\n[v0.1.1:example 06]: https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/tree/ccb9d16e5dbe965e5a604e1cb402cd3bc7de0df5/examples/06_command_framework\n\n### Upgrade Path\n\nWhen calling `rest::get_guilds`, instead of passing no parameters, pass a\n`GuildPagination` variant and a `limit`:\n\n```rust\nuse serenity::client::rest::{self, GuildPagination};\nuse serenity::model::GuildId;\n\n// before\nrest::get_guilds();\n\n// after\nrest::get_guilds(GuildPagination::After(GuildId(777)), 50);\n```\n\n### Added\n\n- The following colours to the Colour struct:\n  - \"Kerbal\" ([@indiv0]) [c:c032fbe]\n  - \"Blurple\" ([@GetRektByMe]) [c:e9282d3]\n  - \"Blitz Blue\" ([@iCrawl]) [c:f53124e]\n  - \"Fabled Pink\" ([@Flat]) [c:9aa357f]\n  - \"Fooyoo\" ([@SunDwarf]) [c:49a6841]\n  - \"Rosewater\" ([@fwrs]) [c:2eaa415]\n- `Message::guild_id` as a quick method for retrieving the Id of a message's\n  guild [c:bceb049]\n- `CurrentUser::guilds()` to get the current user's guilds. Meant for use with\n  selfbots [c:57c060f]\n- `CurrentUser::edit()` to edit the current user's profile settings [c:16d1b3c]\n- `User::distinct` to format a string with the `username#discriminator`\n  combination ([@fwrs]) [c:31becb1]\n- `Member::colour` to retrieve the member's colour ([@fwrs]) [c:43a5c5d]\n- Roles can now be directly compared (`role1 < role2`) for hierarchy [c:143337a]\n- Documentation:\n  - `EditMember` and `EditProfile` ([@Kiseii]) [c:e2557ac]\n  - Documentation for 19 model definitions ([@fwrs]) [c:2844ae1]\n  - Context + permission requirements [c:d144136]\n- A custom shared state (not the Cache) can now be accessed and mutated across\n  commands/contexts, through the use of `Context.data`'s ShareMap. See\n  [example 06][v0.1.1:example 06] for an example\n\n### Fixed\n\n- `rest::start_integration_sync`/`Context::start_integration_sync` now properly\n  work ([@abalabahaha]) [c:7f04179]\n- Role positions can now be negative; fixes issues where a guild's @everyone\n  role (and other roles) are negative [c:f847638]\n- `Context::move_member`'s signature is now correct [c:4de39da]\n- The `command!` macro now publicly exports functions. This allows commands\n  created via this macro to be separated into different modules or crates\n  [c:62ed564]\n\n### Changed\n\n- `rest::get_guilds` now supports pagination of guilds, as the output is now\n  limited to 100 [c:57c060f]\n\n### Misc.\n\n- `Colour::dark_green` is now sorted alphabetically ([@khazhyk]) [c:4a14b92]\n- Simplify the colour macro [c:bb97211]\n- Capitalize the hex value for `Colour::blitz_blue` ([@Kiseii]) [c:daa24ec]\n\n## [0.1.0] - 2016-11-30\n\nInitial commit.\n\n<!-- COMPARISONS -->\n\n[0.12.4]:

Please\npost an issue prior to dedicating a large amount of time on a PR so it can be\ndetermined if the change is something that the community wants.\n\nThere are going to (usually) be 2 primary branches:\n\n- `current`: Development branch of the _most recent_ major version. For example,\nif the largest version is v0.11.1, then the v0.11.x series will be on this branch.\nBugfixes, internal rewrites, documentation updates, new features, etc. go here\nso long as they do not introduce breaking changes.\n\n- `next`: Development branch of the _next_ major version. Following the same\nexample, this would be for the v0.12.x version series. This is where breaking\nchanges go.\n\nWe have a long-term support policy for the previous release series. If the _second\nmost recent_ major version is v0.10.10, then the v0.10.x branch will be the place\nfor bugfixes. Fixes from `current` may be backported to this branch if needed.\nOccasionally, we might support two past release series for special reasons.\n\n# Testing\n\nMake sure you run tests with the various feature combinations, which you can\nfind in [our CI pipeline][test_ci]. To run tests with all features, use\n`cargo test --features full`. Run and update the examples in the `examples`\ndirectory where applicable. To simplify this procedure, you can use [cargo make][make]\nto build and run examples. You can refer to the list of tasks in the [Makefile](Makefile.toml).\n\n# Issues\n\nFor bug reports, please include the following information where applicable:\n\n```\nSerenity version:\n\nRust version (`rustc -V`):\n\nBacktrace (make sure to run `RUST_BACKTRACE=1`):\n\nMinimal test case if possible:\n```\n\nFor feature requests or other requests, please just be as descriptive as\npossible, potentially with a code sample of what it might look like.\n\n# Code Style\n\nWe leave the responsibility of formatting to the rustfmt tool to mitigate\nfriction from people's opinions about formatting code in a certain way,\nputting more focus into functionality. Formatting is enforced in our CI pipeline,\nand pull requests won't be accepted if this is not adhered. Before\ncommitting your changes, always run `cargo fmt --all`.\n\nWe have an 80 characters per line soft limit. In case readability would suffer\nand to support descriptive naming, 100 characters is our hard limit, enforced\nby rustfmt.\n\nNote that our rustfmt configuration uses unstable features! You will have to\ninstall the nightly toolchain of Rust through [`rustup`] in order to format\nyour code.\n\n## Unsafe\n\nCode that defines or uses `unsafe` functions must be reasoned with comments.\n`unsafe` code can pose a potential for undefined behaviour related bugs and other\nkinds of bugs to sprout if misused, weakening security. If you commit code containing\n`unsafe`, you should confirm that its usage is necessary and correct.\n\n# Comment / Documentation style\n\nComments, including documentation comments, ought to be written in British English.\nThey should contain proper English sentences. The first word must be capitalised\nand the sentences finished with either a full stop, question mark, or exclamation\nmark.\n\nComments should always appear before the section they talk about. For example, if you\nadd a comment for some peculiar code at line 235, the comment should be placed at line 234.\n\nWhen writing categories in documentation comments, prepend the name of the category with `#`.\nThis will allow to reference the category in links to the API. For example:\n\n```rust\n/// # Error\n///\n/// This function will return an error if the user could not be found in the cache.\n```\n\nWhen referencing other parts of Serenity's API (modules, structs, functions, etc.)\nin the documentation, the path must be relative written in the form of a Rust path.\nFor instance: `[say](crate::model::channel::GuildChannel::say)`.\nThese are called [intra-doc links][in-links]. For more information, it is recommended\nto read the linked RFC. Links to external websites are exempt from this guideline.\n\n# Commit style\n\nWhen creating a commit summary, use the imperative mood. The summary\nshould describe the action that is administered by the commit's changes.\n\nExamples of proper commit summaries are:\n\n- \"Add tests for checking permissions\" -- changes add new tests\n- \"Fix double sending bug\" -- changes fix erroneous behaviour\n- \"Increase character limit to 2500\" -- changes alter existing behaviour\n\nImproper commit summaries are:\n\n- \"Removed deprecated items\" -- past tense used\n- \"Changing default data for user objects\" -- progressive tense used\n- \"Misc. changes\" -- missing verb\n\nThe first letter of the summary must be capitalised. The summary should also\npreferably fit into 50 characters, but this is not actively enforced.\n\n# Noisy commits\n\nSet `blame.ignoreRevsFile` to ignore [noise commits][noise-commits] in `git blame`:\n```\ngit config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs\n```\n\n[test_ci]: .github/workflows/ci.yml\n[noise-commits]: https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/commit/9bbb25aac4d651804286f333eb503a72d41e473b\n[make]: https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make\n[`rustup`]: https://rustup.rs\n[in-links]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1946-intra-rustdoc-links.md\n"

To make a bot with slash commands or text\ncommands, see the [poise](https://github.com/serenity-rs/poise) framework built on top of serenity.\nTo send and receive data from voice channels, see the\n[songbird](https://github.com/serenity-rs/songbird) library.\n\nSerenity supports bot login via the use of [`Client::builder`].\n\nYou may also check your tokens prior to login via the use of\n[`validate_token`].\n\nOnce logged in, you may add handlers to your client to dispatch [`Event`]s,\nby implementing the handlers in a trait, such as [`EventHandler::message`].\nThis will cause your handler to be called when a [`Event::MessageCreate`] is\nreceived. Each handler is given a [`Context`], giving information about the\nevent. See the [client's module-level documentation].\n\nThe [`Shard`] is transparently handled by the library, removing\nunnecessary complexity. Sharded connections are automatically handled for\nyou. See the [gateway's documentation][gateway docs] for more information.\n\nA [`Cache`] is also provided for you. This will be updated automatically for\nyou as data is received from the Discord API via events. When calling a\nmethod on a [`Context`], the cache will first be searched for relevant data\nto avoid unnecessary HTTP requests to the Discord API. For more information,\nsee the [cache's module-level documentation][cache docs].\n\nNote that - although this documentation will try to be as up-to-date and\naccurate as possible - Discord hosts [official documentation][discord docs]. If\nyou need to be sure that some information piece is accurate, refer to their\ndocs.\n\n# Example Bot\n\nA basic ping-pong bot looks like:\n\n```rust,ignore\nuse std::env;\n\nuse serenity::async_trait;\nuse serenity::model::channel::Message;\nuse serenity::prelude::*;\n\nstruct Handler;\n\n#[async_trait]\nimpl EventHandler for Handler {\n    async fn message(&self, ctx: Context, msg: Message) {\n        if msg.content == \"!ping\" {\n            if let Err(why) = msg.channel_id.say(&ctx.http, \"Pong!\").await {\n                println!(\"Error sending message: {why:?}\");\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() {\n    // Login with a bot token from the environment\n    let token = env::var(\"DISCORD_TOKEN\").expect(\"Expected a token in the environment\");\n    // Set gateway intents, which decides what events the bot will be notified about\n    let intents = GatewayIntents::GUILD_MESSAGES\n        | GatewayIntents::DIRECT_MESSAGES\n        | GatewayIntents::MESSAGE_CONTENT;\n\n    // Create a new instance of the Client, logging in as a bot.\n    let mut client =\n        Client::builder(&token, intents).event_handler(Handler).await.expect(\"Err creating client\");\n\n    // Start listening for events by starting a single shard\n    if let Err(why) = client.start().await {\n        println!(\"Client error: {why:?}\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Full Examples\n\nFull examples, detailing and explaining usage of the basic functionality of the\nlibrary, can be found in the [`examples`] directory.\n\n# Installation\n\nAdd the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\nserenity = \"0.12\"\ntokio = { version = \"1.21.2\", features = [\"macros\", \"rt-multi-thread\"] }\n```\n\n## MSRV Policy\n\nSerenity's minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) is Rust 1.74.\n\nWe opt to keep MSRV stable on the `current` branch. This means it will remain\nunchanged between minor releases. Occasionally, dependencies may violate SemVer\nand update their own MSRV in a breaking way. As a result, pinning their\nversions will become necessary to successfully build Serenity using an older\nRust release.\n\nThe `next` branch tracks the latest Rust release as its MSRV. This allows for\nswift development as new languages features are stabilized, and reduces\ntechnical debt in the long run. When a new major release is cut, the MSRV on\n`current` will be updated to that of `next`, and we will commit to supporting\nthat MSRV until the following major release.\n\n# Features\n\nFeatures can be enabled or disabled by configuring the library through\nCargo.toml:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies.serenity]\ndefault-features = false\nfeatures = [\"pick\", \"your\", \"feature\", \"names\", \"here\"]\nversion = \"0.12\"\n```\n\nThe default features are: `builder`, `cache`, `chrono`, `client`, `framework`, `gateway`,\n`http`, `model`, `standard_framework`, `utils`, and `rustls_backend`.\n\nThere are these alternative default features, they require to set `default-features = false`:\n\n- **default_native_tls**: Uses `native_tls_backend` instead of the default `rustls_backend`.\n- **default_no_backend**: Excludes the default backend, pick your own backend instead.\n\nIf you are unsure which to pick, use the default features by not setting `default-features = false`.\n\nThe following is a full list of features:\n\n- **builder**: The builders used in conjunction with models' methods.\n- **cache**: The cache will store information about guilds, channels, users, and\nother data, to avoid performing REST requests. If you are low on RAM, do not\nenable this.\n- **collector**: A collector awaits events, such as receiving a message from a user or reactions on a message, and allows for responding to the events in a convenient fashion. Collectors can be configured to enforce certain criteria the events must meet.\n- **client**: A manager for shards and event handlers, abstracting away the\nwork of handling shard events and updating the cache, if enabled.\n- **framework**: Enables the framework, which is a utility to allow simple\ncommand parsing, before/after command execution, prefix setting, and more.\n- **gateway**: A Shard, used as a higher-level interface for communicating with\nthe Discord gateway over a WebSocket client.\n- **http**: Functions providing a wrapper over Discord's REST API at a low\nenough level that optional parameters can be provided at will via a JsonMap.\n- **model**: Method implementations for models, acting as helper methods over\nthe HTTP functions.\n- **standard_framework**: A standard, default implementation of the Framework. **NOTE**: Deprecated as of v0.12.1. Using the [poise](https://github.com/serenity-rs/poise) framework is recommended instead.\n- **utils**: Utility functions for common use cases by users.\n- **voice**: Enables registering a voice plugin to the client, which will handle actual voice connections from Discord.\n[lavalink-rs][project:lavalink-rs] or [Songbird][project:songbird] are recommended voice plugins.\n- **default_native_tls**: Default features but using `native_tls_backend`\ninstead of `rustls_backend`.\n- **tokio_task_builder**: Enables tokio's `tracing` feature and uses `tokio::task::Builder` to spawn tasks with names if `RUSTFLAGS=\"--cfg tokio_unstable\"` is set.\n- **unstable_discord_api**: Enables features of the Discord API that do not have a stable interface. The features might not have official documentation or are subject to change.\n- **simd_json**: Enables SIMD accelerated JSON parsing and rendering for API calls, if supported on the target CPU architecture.\n- **temp_cache**: Enables temporary caching in functions that retrieve data via the HTTP API.\n- **chrono**: Uses the `chrono` crate to represent timestamps. If disabled, the `time` crate is used instead.\n- **interactions_endpoint**: Enables tools related to Discord's Interactions Endpoint URL feature\n\nTo enable all parts of the codebase, use the **\"full\"** feature.\n\nFor possibly more up-to-date information, check the Cargo.toml.\n\nSerenity offers two TLS-backends, `rustls_backend` by default, you need to pick\none if you do not use the default features:\n\n- **rustls_backend**: Uses Rustls for all platforms, a pure Rust\nTLS implementation.\n- **native_tls_backend**: Uses SChannel on Windows, Secure Transport on macOS,\nand OpenSSL on other platforms.\n\nIf you want all of the default features except for `cache` for example, you can\nlist all but that:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies.serenity]\ndefault-features = false\nfeatures = [\n    \"builder\",\n    \"chrono\",\n    \"client\",\n    \"framework\",\n    \"gateway\",\n    \"http\",\n    \"model\",\n    \"standard_framework\",\n    \"utils\",\n    \"rustls_backend\",\n]\nversion = \"0.12\"\n```\n\n# Dependencies\n\nIf you use the `native_tls_backend` and you are not developing on macOS or Windows, you will need:\n\n- openssl\n\n# Hosting\n\nIf you want a quick and easy way to host your bot, you can use [shuttle][project:shuttle],\na Rust-native cloud development platform that allows deploying Serenity bots for free.\n\n# Projects extending Serenity\n\n- [lavalink-rs][project:lavalink-rs]: An interface to [Lavalink][repo:lavalink] and [Andesite][repo:andesite], an audio sending node based on [Lavaplayer][repo:lavaplayer]\n- [Songbird][project:songbird]: An async Rust library for the Discord voice API.\n- [Poise][project:poise]: Experimental command framework, with advanced features like edit tracking, single function slash and prefix commands and flexible argument parsing.\n\n[`Cache`]: https://docs.rs/serenity/*/serenity/cache/struct.Cache.html\n[`Client::builder`]: https://docs.rs/serenity/*/serenity/client/struct.Client.html#method.builder\n[`EventHandler::message`]: https://docs.rs/serenity/*/serenity/client/trait.EventHandler.html#method.message\n[`Context`]: https://docs.rs/serenity/*/serenity/client/struct.Context.html\n[`Event`]: https://docs.rs/serenity/*/serenity/model/event/enum.Event.html\n[`Event::MessageCreate`]: https://docs.rs/serenity/*/serenity/model/event/enum.Event.html#variant.MessageCreate\n[`Shard`]: https://docs.rs/serenity/*/serenity/gateway/struct.Shard.html\n[`examples`]: https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/blob/current/examples\n[`rest`]: https://docs.rs/serenity/*/serenity/client/rest/index.html\n[`validate_token`]: https://docs.rs/serenity/*/serenity/utils/fn.validate_token.html\n[cache docs]: https://docs.rs/serenity/*/serenity/cache/index.html\n[ci]: https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/actions\n[ci-badge]: https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/serenity-rs/serenity/ci.yml?branch=current&style=flat-square\n[client's module-level documentation]: https://docs.rs/serenity/*/serenity/client/index.html\n[crates.io link]: https://crates.io/crates/serenity\n[crates.io version]: https://img.shields.io/crates/v/serenity.svg?style=flat-square\n[discord docs]: https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro\n[docs]: https://docs.rs/serenity\n[docs-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-online-5023dd.svg?style=flat-square\n[examples]: https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity/tree/current/examples\n[gateway docs]: https://docs.rs/serenity/*/serenity/gateway/index.html\n[guild]: https://discord.gg/serenity-rs\n[guild-badge]: https://img.shields.io/discord/381880193251409931.svg?style=flat-square&colorB=7289DA\n[project:lavalink-rs]: https://gitlab.com/vicky5124/lavalink-rs/\n[project:songbird]: https://github.com/serenity-rs/songbird\n[project:poise]: https://github.com/kangalioo/poise\n[project:shuttle]: https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle\n[repo:lavalink]: https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink\n[repo:andesite]: https://github.com/natanbc/andesite\n[repo:lavaplayer]: https://github.com/sedmelluq/lavaplayer\n[logo]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serenity-rs/serenity/current/logo.png\n[rust-version-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/rust-1.74.0+-93450a.svg?style=flat-square\n[rust-version-link]: https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/11/16/Rust-1.74.0.html\n"
