          "content": "# Contributing to Daft\n\n## Reporting Issues\n\nTo report bugs and issues with Daft, please report in detail:\n\n1. Operating system\n2. Daft version\n3. Python version\n4. Runner that your code is using\n\n## Proposing Features\n\nPlease start a GitHub Discussion in our [Ideas channel](https://github.com/Eventual-Inc/Daft/discussions/categories/ideas). Once the feature is clarified, fleshed out and approved, the corresponding issue(s) will be created from the GitHub discussion.\n\nWhen proposing features, please include:\n\n1. Feature Summary (no more than 3 sentences)\n2. Example usage (pseudo-code to show how it is used)\n3. Corner-case behavior (how should this code behave in various corner-case scenarios)\n\n## Contributing Code\n\n### Development Environment\n\nTo set up your development environment:\n\n1. Ensure that your system has a suitable Python version installed (>=3.7, <=3.11)\n2. [Install the Rust compilation toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)\n3. Clone the Daft repo: `git clone git@github.com:Eventual-Inc/Daft.git`\n4. Run `make .venv` from your new cloned Daft repository to create a new virtual environment with all of Daft's development dependencies installed\n5. Run `make hooks` to install pre-commit hooks: these will run tooling on every commit to ensure that your code meets Daft development standards\n\n### Developing\n\n1. `make build`: recompile your code after modifying any Rust code in `src/`\n2. `make test`: run tests\n3. `DAFT_RUNNER=ray make test`: set the runner to the Ray runner and run tests (DAFT_RUNNER defaults to `py`)\n\n### Developing with Ray\n\nRunning a development version of Daft on a local Ray cluster is as simple as including `daft.context.set_runner_ray()` in your Python script and then building and executing it as usual.\n\nTo use a remote Ray cluster, run the following steps on the same operating system version as your Ray nodes, in order to ensure that your binaries are executable on Ray.\n\n1. `mkdir wd`: this is the working directory, it will hold all the files to be submitted to Ray for a job\n2. `ln -s daft wd/daft`: create a symbolic link from the Python module to the working directory\n3. `make build-release`: an optimized build to ensure that the module is small enough to be successfully uploaded to Ray. Run this after modifying any Rust code in `src/`\n4. `ray job submit --working-dir wd --address \"http://<head_node_host>:8265\" -- python script.py`: submit `wd/script.py` to be run on Ray\n\n### Debugging\n\nThe debugging feature uses a special VSCode launch configuration to start the Python debugger with a script at `tools/attach_debugger.py`, which takes the target script's name as input. This script finds the process ID, updates the launch.json file, compiles the target script, and runs it. It then attaches a Rust debugger to the Python debugger, allowing both to work together. Breakpoints in Python code hit the Python debugger, while breakpoints in Rust code hit the Rust debugger.\n\n#### Preparation\n\n- **CodeLLDB Extension for Visual Studio Code**:\nThis extension is useful for debugging Rust code invoked from Python.\n\n- **Setting Up the Virtual Environment Interpreter**\n(Ctrl+Shift+P -> Python: Select Interpreter -> .venv)\n\n- **Debug Settings in launch.json**\nThis file is usually found in the `.vscode` folder of your project root. See the [official VSCode documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_launch-configurations) for more information about the launch.json file.\n    <details><summary><code><b>launch.json</b></code></summary>\n\n    ```json\n    {\n        \"configurations\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"Debug Rust/Python\",\n                \"type\": \"debugpy\",\n                \"request\": \"launch\",\n                \"program\": \"${workspaceFolder}/tools/attach_debugger.py\",\n                \"args\": [\n                    \"${file}\"\n                ],\n                \"console\": \"internalConsole\",\n                \"serverReadyAction\": {\n                    \"pattern\": \"pID = ([0-9]+)\",\n                    \"action\": \"startDebugging\",\n                    \"name\": \"Rust LLDB\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"name\": \"Rust LLDB\",\n                \"pid\": \"0\",\n                \"type\": \"lldb\",\n                \"request\": \"attach\",\n                \"program\": \"${command:python.interpreterPath}\",\n                \"stopOnEntry\": false,\n                \"sourceLanguages\": [\n                    \"rust\"\n                ],\n                \"presentation\": {\n                    \"hidden\": true\n                }\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n    ```\n\n    </details>\n\n#### Running the debugger\n\n1. Create a Python script containing Daft code. Ensure that your virtual environment is set up correctly.\n\n2. Set breakpoints in any `.rs` or `.py` file.\n\n3. In the `Run and Debug` panel on the left, select `Debug Rust/Python` from the drop-down menu on top and click the `Start Debugging` button.\n\nAt this point, your debugger should stop on breakpoints in any .rs file located within the codebase.\n\n> **Note**:\n> On some systems, the LLDB debugger will not attach unless [ptrace protection](https://linux-audit.com/protect-ptrace-processes-kernel-yama-ptrace_scope) is disabled.\nTo disable, run the following command:\n> ```shell\n> echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope\n> ```\n\n### Benchmarking\n\nBenchmark tests are located in `tests/benchmarks`. If you would like to run benchmarks, make sure to first do `make build-release` instead of `make build` in order to compile an optimized build of Daft.\n\n1. `pytest tests/benchmarks/[test_file.py] -m benchmark`: Run all benchmarks in a file\n2. `pytest tests/benchmarks/[test_file.py] -k [test_name] -m benchmark`: Run a specific benchmark in a file\n\nMore information about writing and using benchmarks can be found on the [pytest-benchmark docs](https://pytest-benchmark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n"

Ingestion and basic transformations of multimodal data is extremely easy and performant in Daft.\n2. **Interactive Computing**: Daft is built for the interactive developer experience through notebooks or REPLs - intelligent caching/query optimizations accelerates your experimentation and data exploration.\n3. **Distributed Computing**: Some workloads can quickly outgrow your local laptop's computational resources - Daft integrates natively with `Ray <https://www.ray.io>`_ for running dataframes on large clusters of machines with thousands of CPUs/GPUs.\n\nGetting Started\n---------------\n\nInstallation\n^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nInstall Daft with ``pip install getdaft``.\n\nFor more advanced installations (e.g. installing from source or with extra dependencies such as Ray and AWS utilities), please see our `Installation Guide <https://www.getdaft.io/projects/docs/en/latest/install.html>`_\n\nQuickstart\n^^^^^^^^^^\n\n  Check out our `10-minute quickstart <https://www.getdaft.io/projects/docs/en/latest/learn/10-min.html>`_!\n\nIn this example, we load images from an AWS S3 bucket's URLs and resize each image in the dataframe:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    import daft\n\n    # Load a dataframe from filepaths in an S3 bucket\n    df = daft.from_glob_path(\"s3://daft-public-data/laion-sample-images/*\")\n\n    # 1. Download column of image URLs as a column of bytes\n    # 2. Decode the column of bytes into a column of images\n    df = df.with_column(\"image\", df[\"path\"].url.download().image.decode())\n\n    # Resize each image into 32x32\n    df = df.with_column(\"resized\", df[\"image\"].image.resize(32, 32))\n\n    df.show(3)\n\n\n|Quickstart Image|\n\n\nBenchmarks\n----------\n|Benchmark Image|\n\nTo see the full benchmarks, detailed setup, and logs, check out our `benchmarking page. <https://www.getdaft.io/projects/docs/en/latest/faq/benchmarks.html>`_\n\n\nMore Resources\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n* `10-minute tour of Daft <https://www.getdaft.io/projects/docs/en/latest/learn/10-min.html>`_ - learn more about Daft's full range of capabilities including dataloading from URLs, joins, user-defined functions (UDF), groupby, aggregations and more.\n* `User Guide <https://www.getdaft.io/projects/docs/en/latest/user_guide/index.html>`_ - take a deep-dive into each topic within Daft\n* `API Reference <https://www.getdaft.io/projects/docs/en/latest/api_docs/index.html>`_ - API reference for public classes/functions of Daft\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nTo start contributing to Daft, please read `CONTRIBUTING.md <https://github.com/Eventual-Inc/Daft/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_\n\nHere's a list of `good first issues <https://github.com/Eventual-Inc/Daft/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22>`_ to get yourself warmed up with Daft. Comment in the issue to pick it up, and feel free to ask any questions!\n\nTelemetry\n---------\n\nTo help improve Daft, we collect non-identifiable data.\n\nTo disable this behavior, set the following environment variable: ``DAFT_ANALYTICS_ENABLED=0``\n\nThe data that we collect is:\n\n1. **Non-identifiable:** events are keyed by a session ID which is generated on import of Daft\n2. **Metadata-only:** we do not collect any of our users’ proprietary code or data\n3. **For development only:** we do not buy or sell any user data\n\nPlease see our `documentation <https://www.getdaft.io/projects/docs/en/latest/faq/telemetry.html>`_ for more details.\n\n.. image:: https://static.scarf.sh/a.png?x-pxid=cd444261-469e-473b-b9ba-f66ac3dc73ee\n\nRelated Projects\n----------------\n\n+---------------------------------------------------+-----------------+---------------+-------------+-----------------+-----------------------------+-------------+\n| Dataframe                                         | Query Optimizer | Multimodal    | Distributed | Arrow Backed    | Vectorized Execution Engine | Out-of-core |\n+===================================================+=================+===============+=============+=================+=============================+=============+\n| Daft                                              | Yes             | Yes           | Yes         | Yes             | Yes                         | Yes         |\n+---------------------------------------------------+-----------------+---------------+-------------+-----------------+-----------------------------+-------------+\n| `Pandas <https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas>`_  | No              | Python object | No          | optional >= 2.0 | Some(Numpy)                 | No          |\n+---------------------------------------------------+-----------------+---------------+-------------+-----------------+-----------------------------+-------------+\n| `Polars <https://github.com/pola-rs/polars>`_     | Yes             | Python object | No          | Yes             | Yes                         | Yes         |\n+---------------------------------------------------+-----------------+---------------+-------------+-----------------+-----------------------------+-------------+\n| `Modin <https://github.com/modin-project/modin>`_ | Eagar           | Python object | Yes         | No              | Some(Pandas)                | Yes         |\n+---------------------------------------------------+-----------------+---------------+-------------+-----------------+-----------------------------+-------------+\n| `Pyspark <https://github.com/apache/spark>`_      | Yes             | No            | Yes         | Pandas UDF/IO   | Pandas UDF                  | Yes         |\n+---------------------------------------------------+-----------------+---------------+-------------+-----------------+-----------------------------+-------------+\n| `Dask DF <https://github.com/dask/dask>`_         | No              | Python object | Yes         | No              | Some(Pandas)                | Yes         |\n+---------------------------------------------------+-----------------+---------------+-------------+-----------------+-----------------------------+-------------+\n\nCheck out our `dataframe comparison page <https://www.getdaft.io/projects/docs/en/latest/faq/dataframe_comparison.html>`_ for more details!\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nDaft has an Apache 2.0 license -
