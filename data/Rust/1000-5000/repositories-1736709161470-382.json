          "content": "# Changelog\n\n## 0.7.3\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Make `TaffyTree::detailed_layout_info` take `&self` rather than `&mut self` (#779)\n\n## 0.7.2\n\n### Added\n\n- The ability to access computed track sizes and item positions of a CSS Grid layout (#772).\n  This information can be accessed using the `LayoutGridContainer::set_detailed_grid_info` method\n  in the low-level API or the `TaffyTree::detailed_layout_info` method in the high-level API.\n\n## 0.7.1\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Improve interaction of abspos children of block containers with margin collapsing (#760)\n\n### Added\n\n- Add `TaffyTree::unrounded_layout` getter (#765)\n\n### Removed\n\n- The `num-traits` dependency was removed (#761) (#762)\n\n## 0.7.0\n\n### Changed\n\n- BREAKING: The `cache_mut` method on the `LayoutPartialTree` trait has been replaced with a separate `CacheTree` trait. This allows\n  Taffy to be more easily used without caching or with a custom cache implementation.\n- BREAKING: the `TaffyTree::set_children` method now removes the children from their previous parent (if they have one).\n\n### Added\n\n- Helper methods to retrieve content-box sizes were added to `Layout`\n\n## 0.6.3\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Block: ignore margin collapsing when computing static position of abspos items (#747)\n\n## 0.6.2\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Fix: clamp indefinite available space by min- and max- size as appropriate (#742)\n\n## 0.6.1\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Fix calculation of `auto-fill`/`auto-fit` repetition count when container has a definite percentage size (#722)\n- Fix min-size style not affecting intrinsic sizes (#723)\n- Fix documentation of dirty and mark_dirty functions (#724)\n- Fix intrinsic size of scroll containers that have a small explicit flex-basis (#728)\n\n## 0.6.0\n\n### Highlights\n\n- The `Style` struct has been \"traitified\". This supports Taffy's integration in Servo and generally makes Taffy more flexible. The\n  `Style` struct still exists and implements the new traits so existing uses of Taffy will continue to work as before.\n- The `box-sizing` style is supported\n- Computed margins are output in `Layout`\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Fix `print_tree()` when rounding is disabled (#680)\n- Absolute Insets should be resolved against the container size minus border (#666)\n- Fix flooring hypothetical_main_size by computed min size (#689)\n- Fix flex line cross-size determination (#690)\n- Fix panics in the grid algorithm (#691)\n- Fix resolving flexible lengths (WPT css/flexbox-multiline-min-max test) (#692)\n- Fix wrapping when a max main size style is present (#694)\n- Fix case where Taffy allowed margins to collapse through an element when it shouldn't have (#695)\n\n### Added\n\n- Legacy text align (for laying out `<center>` and `<div align=\"..\">`) is supported\n- Add `is_table` for block items (#701)\n- Impl `Debug` and `Clone` for `Cache` (#688)\n- Implement `Debug` and `PartialEq` for tree types (#697)\n\n## 0.5.2\n\n- Fix block stretch sizing (don't always apply stretch sizing to block containers) (#674)\n- Fix computation of intrinsic main size when it depends on a child's known cross size (#673)\n- Fix panic when GridLine 0 is specified (#671)\n- Docs: Document feature flags and scrape examples (#672)\n- Docs: Update cosmic-text example to cosmic-text 0.12 (#670)\n\n## 0.5.1\n\n- Fix: Clamp block item stretch widths by their min and max width (#664)\n- Fix: Auto margin computation in block layout (#663)\n\n## 0.5.0\n\nThe changes in 0.5 are relatively small but the new measure function parameter is a breaking change so it requires a minor version bump.\n\n- Added: A `style: &Style` parameter has been added to measure functions.\n- Added: The `MaybeMath`, `MaybeResolve`, and `ResolveOrZero` traits have been made public.\n- Fix: use SizingMode::Inherent when sizing absolute children of flexbox nodes.\n\n## 0.4.4\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Content alignment (`align-content`/`justify-content`) behaviour was updated to match the latest spec (and Chrome 123+) (#635)\n- Ensure that root Flexbox nodes are floored by their padding-border (#651, #655)\n- Use grid area size not available space when applying aspect ratio to grid containers (#656)\n\n## 0.4.3\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Fix compilation error in `evenly_sized_tracks` style helper in recent versions of rustc caused by a change/regression in type\n  inference (#643). Note that 3rd-party code that call style helpers that take an `Into<f32>` parameter may still be affected by this issue,\n  but they should be able to fix on their side by clarifying the type passed in\n\n## 0.4.2\n\n- Fixed: single-line flex-container should clamp the line's cross-size (#638)\n- Reduced binary footprint of Taffy from around 300kb to around 150kb (#636)\n\n## 0.4.1\n\n- Fixed: CSS Grid track sizing not respecting growth limits in some circumstances (#624)\n\n## 0.4.0\n\n### Highlights\n\n- Support for CSS Block layout (`display: block`)\n- Support for the `overflow` property (+ `scrollbar_width` for `overflow: scroll`)\n- Improved measure function API\n- Completely refactored low-level API\n- Simplified module hierarchy (+ most types/functions are now exported from the crate root)\n- Expanded set of examples which better document integration with other layout systems (e.g. text layout)\n- Computed values for `padding` and `border` are now output into the `Layout` struct\n\n### Block layout\n\nSupport for [CSS Block layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flow_Layout/Block_and_Inline_Layout_in_Normal_Flow#elements_participating_in_a_block_formatting_context) has been added. This can be used via the new `Display::Block` variant of the `Display` enum. Note that  full flow layout: inline, inline-block and float layout have *not* been implemented. The use case supported is block container nodes which contain block-level children.\n\n### Overflow property\n\nSupport has been added for a new `overflow` style property with `Visible`, `Clip`, `Hidden`, and `Scroll` values (`Auto` is not currently implemented). Additionally a `scrollbar_width` property has been added to control the size of scrollbars for nodes with `Overflow::Scroll` set.\n\n- Overflow is settable indpendently in each axis.\n- `Visible` and `Clip` will produce layouts equivalent to the Taffy 0.3. `Clip` will affect the new `content_size` output by restricting it to the available space.\n- `Hidden` and `Scroll` affect layout by changing the automatic minimum size of Flexbox and Grid children\n- `Scroll` additionally reserves `scrollbar_width` pixels for a scrollbar in the opposite axis to which scrolling is enabled. `Scroll` with `scrollbar_width` set to zero is equivalent to `Hidden`.\n\n### Measure function changes\n\nThe \"measure function\" API for integrating Taffy with other measurement systems (such as text layout) has been changed to be more flexible\nand to interact better with borrow checking (you can now borrow external data in your measure function!).\n\n- There are no longer per-node measure functions.\n- There is now a single \"global\" measure function, and a per-node \"context\" of a user-defined type\n- The `Taffy` tree is now a generic `TaffyTree<T>` where `T` is the \"context\" type.\n- The measure function is now called for all leaf nodes (nodes without children). If you wish to maintain compatibility with the previous\n  behaviour then your measure function should return `Size::ZERO` for leaf nodes whose context is `None`.\n\nIf you are not using measure functions, then the only change you will need to make is from:\n\n```rust\nlet mut tree = Taffy::new();\n```\n\nto\n\n```rust\nlet mut tree : TaffyTree<()> = TaffyTree::new();\n```\n\nAnd generally update any uses of `Taffy` in your codebase to `TaffyTree<()>`.\n\nIf you are using measure functions then you will need to make some bigger (but straightforward) changes. The following Taffy 0.3 code:\n\n```rust\nlet mut tree = Taffy::new();\nlet leaf = tree.new_leaf_with_measure(\n  Style::DEFAULT,\n  |known_dimensions: Size<Option<f32>>, available_space: Size<AvailableSpace>| Size { width: 100.0, height: 200.0 }\n);\ntree.compute_layout(leaf, Size::MAX_CONTENT);\n```\n\nShould become something like the following with Taffy 0.4:\n\n```rust\nlet mut tree : TaffyTree<Size> = TaffyTree::new();\nlet leaf = tree.new_leaf_with_context(Style::DEFAULT, Size { width: 100.0, height: 200.0 });\ntree.compute_layout_with_measure(\n  leaf,\n  Size::MAX_CONTENT,\n  |known_dimensions: Size<Option<f32>>, available_space: Size<AvailableSpace>, node_id: NodeId, node_context: Option<Size>| {\n    node_context.unwrap_or(Size::ZERO)\n  }\n);\n```\n\nNote that:\n\n- You can choose any type instead of `Size` in the above example. This includes your own custom type (which can be an enum or a trait object).\n- If you don't need a context then you can use `()` for the context type\n- As the single \"global\" measure function passed to `compute_layout_with_measure` only needs to exist for the duration of a single layout run,\n  it can (mutably) borrow data from it's environment\n\n### Low-level API (`LayoutTree` trait) refactor\n\nThe low-level API has been completely reworked:\n\n- The `LayoutTree` trait has been split into 5 smaller traits which live in the `taffy::tree:traits` module (along with their associated documentation)\n- The following methods have been removed from split `LayoutTree` traits entirely: `parent`, `is_childless`, `measure_node`, `needs_measure`, and `mark_dirty`.\n- `taffy::node::Node` has been replaced with `taffy::NodeId`. This should make it much easier to implement the low-level traits as the underlying type backing the node id now a `u64` rather than a `slotmap::DefaultKey`.\n- Support for running each layout algorithm individually on a single node via the following top-level functions:\n  - `compute_flexbox_layout`\n  - `compute_grid_layout`\n  - `compute_block_layout`\n  - `compute_leaf_layout`\n  - `compute_root_layout`\n  - `compute_hidden_layout`\n\nIt is believed that nobody was previously using the low-level API so we are not providing a migration guide. However, along with the refactor we have greatly\nimproved both the documentation and have added examples using the new API, both of which are linked to from the [main documentation page](https://docs.rs/taffy).\n\n### Module hierarchy changes\n\nThe specific changes are detailed below. However for most users the most significant change will be that almost all types are now re-exported from the root module. This means that module specific imports like `use taffy::layout::Layout` can now in almost all cases be replaced with the simpler `use taffy::Layout`.\n\nSpecific changes:\n\n- The `math` module has been made private\n- The `axis` module has been merged into the `geometry` module\n- The debug module is no longer public. The `print_tree` function is now accessible under `util`.\n- All types from the `node`, `data`, `layout`, `error` and `cache` modules have been moved to the  the `tree` module.\n- The `layout_flexbox()` function has been removed from the prelude. Use `taffy::compute_flexbox_layout` instead.\n\n### Many APIs have been renamed to replace `points` or `Points` with `length` or `Length`\n\nThis new name better describes one-dimensional measure of space in some unspecified unit\nwhich is often unrelated to the PostScript point or the CSS `pt` unit.\n\nThis also removes a misleading similarity with the 2D `Point`,\nwhose components can have any unit and are not even necessarily absolute lengths.\n\nExample usage change:\n\n```diff\n use taffy::prelude::*;\n\n // …\n\n let header_node = taffy\n     .new_leaf(\n         Style {\n-            size: Size { width: points(800.0), height: points(100.0) },\n+            size: Size { width: length(800.0), height: length(100.0) },\n             ..Default::default()\n         },\n     ).unwrap();\n```\n\n### Other Changes\n\n- The `Taffy` type was renamed to `TaffyTree` and made generic of a context parameter\n- The Flexbox algorithm has now been moved behind the `flexbox` feature. The `flexbox` feature is enabled by default.\n- The `justify_self` property has been moved behind the `grid` feature.\n- Fixed misspelling: `RunMode::PeformLayout` renamed into `RunMode::PerformLayout` (added missing `r`).\n- `serde` dependency has been made compatible with `no_std` environments\n- `slotmap` dependency has been made compatible with `no_std` environments\n- Added `insert_child_at_index()` method to the `TaffyTree`. This can be used to insert a child node at any position instead of just the end.\n- Added `total_node_count()` method to the `TaffyTree` which returns the total number of nodes in the tree.\n- Added `get_disjoint_node_context_mut()` method to the `TaffyTree`. This can be used to safely get multiple mutable borrows at the same time.\n\n## 0.3.19\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Fix compilation error in `evenly_sized_tracks` style helper in recent versions of rustc caused by a change/regression in type\n  inference (#643). Note that 3rd-party code that call style helpers that take an `Into<f32>` parameter may still be affected by this issue,\n  but they should be able to fix on their side by clarifying the type passed in\n\n## 0.3.18\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Fix computation of Flexbox automatic minimum size when grid or flexbox child has an explicit width/height style set (#576)\n\n## 0.3.17\n\n### Added\n\n- Added `total_node_count` method to the `Taffy` struct. Returns the total number of nodes in the tree.\n\n## 0.3.16\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Improve performance of flexbox columns\n\n## 0.3.15\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Fix justify-content and align-content when free space is negative (content overflows container) (#549) (#551)\n\n## 0.3.14\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Flex: Fix issue where constraints were not being propagated, causing nodes with inherent aspect-ratio (typically images) to not apply that aspect-ratio (#545) (Fixes bevyengine/bevy#9841)\n\n## 0.3.13\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Fix rounding accumulation bug (#521) (Fixes #501 and bevyengine/bevy#8911)\n- Flexbox: pass correct cross-axis available space when computing an item's intrinsic main size (#522)(Fixes bevyengine/bevy#9350)\n- Flexbox: Subtract child margin not parent margin when computing stretch-alignment known size\n- Grid: Make CSS Grid algorithm correctly apply max width/height and available space when it is the root node (#491)\n- Grid: Fix CSS Grid \"auto track\" / placement bugs #481\n  - Fix divide by zero when using grid_auto_rows/grid_auto_columns with zero negative implicit tracks\n  - Fix over counting of tracks (leading to incorrect container heights) when auto-placing in grids that contain negative implicit tracks.\n  - Fix axis conflation in auto-placement code when grid_auto_flow is column\n  - Fix assignment of auto track sizes when initializing negative implicit tracks\n- Leaf: Apply margins to leaf nodes when computing available space for measure functions\n- Leaf: Reserve space for padding/borders in nodes with measure functions (#497)\n  \n  **NOTE: This has the potential to break layouts relying on the old behaviour.** However, such layouts would be relying on a style having no effect, so it is judged that such layouts are unlikely to exist in the wild. If this turns out not to be true then this fix will be reverted on the 0.3.x branch.\n\n### Dependencies\n\n- Upgrade `grid` to `0.10`.

This is in addition to the existing Flexbox layout support, and the two modes interoperate. You can set a node to use Grid layout by setting the `display` property to `Display::Grid`.\n\n#### Learning Resources\n\nTaffy implements the CSS Grid specification faithfully, so documentation designed for the web should translate cleanly to Taffy's implementation. If you are interested in learning how to use CSS Grid, we would recommend the following resources:\n\n- [CSS Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/). This is an interactive tutorial/game that allows you to learn the essential parts of CSS Grid in a fun engaging way.\n- [A Complete Guide To CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) by CSS Tricks. This is detailed guide with illustrations and comprehensive written explanation of the different Grid properties and how they work.\n\n#### Supported Features & Properties\n\nIn addition to the usual sizing/spacing properties (size, min_size, padding, margin, etc), the following Grid style properties are supported on Grid Containers:\n\n| Property                  | Explanation                                                                                    |\n| ---                       | ---                                                                                            |\n| [`grid-template-columns`] | The track sizing functions of the grid's explicit columns                                      |\n| [`grid-template-rows`]    | The track sizing functions of the grid's explicit rows                                         |\n| [`grid-auto-rows`]        | Track sizing functions for the grid's implicitly generated rows                                |\n| [`grid-auto-columns`]     | Track sizing functions for the grid's implicitly generated columns                             |\n| [`grid-auto-flow`]        | Whether auto-placed items are placed row-wise or column-wise.

If you want to run this example, the don't forget the enable the CSS Grid cargo feature:\n\n```bash\ncargo run --example grid_holy_grail --features grid\n```\n\n### New Feature: Style Helpers\n\nTen new helper functions have added to the taffy prelude. These helper functions have short, intuitive names, and have generic return types which allow them to magically return the correct type depending on context. They make defining styles much easier, and means you won't typically need to use types like `Dimension` or `TrackSizingFunction` directly.\n\nFor example, instead of:\n\n```rust\nlet size : Size<Dimension> = Size { width: Dimension::Points(100.0), height: Dimension::Percent(50.0) };\n```\n\nyou can now write\n\n```rust\nlet size : Size<Dimension> = Size { width: points(100.0), height: percent(50.0) };\n```\n\nAnd that same helper function will work other types like `LengthPercentage` and `MinTrackSizingFunction` that also have a `Points` variant. There are also generic impl's for `Size<T>`, `Rect<T>` and `Line<T>` which means if your node is the same size in all dimensions you can even write\n\n```rust\nlet size : Size<Dimension> = points(100.0);\n```\n\nAvailable style helpers:\n\n<table>\n  <thead><tr><th>Type(s)</th><th colspan=\"2\">Helpers that work with that type</th></tr></thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td rowspan=\"3\"><code>LengthPercentage</code></td>\n      <td><code>zero()</code></td>\n      <td>Generates a <code>Points</code> variant with the value <code>0.0</code></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><code>points(val:&nbsp;f32)</code></td>\n      <td>Generates a <code>Points</code> variant with the specified value</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><code>percent(val:&nbsp;f32)</code></td>\n      <td>Generates a <code>Percent</code> variant with the specified value.<br />Note that the scale of 0-1 not 0-100.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td rowspan=\"2\"><code>LengthPercentageAuto</code><br /><code>Dimension</code></td>\n      <td colspan=\"2\"><i>All helpers from <code>LengthPercentage</code> and...</i></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><code>auto()</code></td>\n      <td>Generates an <code>Auto</code> variant</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td rowspan=\"3\"><code>MinTrackSizingFunction</code></td>\n      <td colspan=\"2\"><i>All helpers from <code>LengthPercentageAuto</code>/<code>Dimension</code> and...</i></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><code>min_content()</code></td>\n      <td>Generates an <code>MinContent</code> variant</td>\n    </tr>\n      <tr>\n      <td><code>max_content()</code></td>\n      <td>Generates an <code>MinContent</code> variant</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td rowspan=\"3\"><code>MaxTrackSizingFunction</code></td>\n      <td colspan=\"2\"><i>All helpers from <code>MinTrackSizingFunction</code> and...</i></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><code>fit_content(limit:&nbsp;LengthPercentage)</code></td>\n      <td>Generates a <code>FitContent</code> variant with the specified limit.<br />Nest the <code>points</code> or <code>percent</code> helper inside this function to specified the limit.</td>\n    </tr>\n      <tr>\n      <td><code>fr(fraction:&nbsp;f32)</code></td>\n      <td>Generates a <code>Fraction</code> (<code>fr</code>) variant with the specified flex fraction </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td rowspan=\"3\"><code>NonRepeatingTrackSizingFunction</code></td>\n      <td colspan=\"2\"><i>All helpers from <code>MaxTrackSizingFunction</code> and...</i></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><code>minmax(min: MinTrackSizingFunction, max: MaxTrackSizingFunction)</code></td>\n      <td>Equivalent to CSS <code>minmax()</code> function.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><code>flex(fraction:&nbsp;f32)</code></td>\n      <td>Equivalent to CSS <code>minmax(0px, 1fr)</code>.

It is valid value for Grid containers.\n- `AlignItems` and `AlignSelf` have been merged.\n  - The `Auto` variant of `AlignSelf` has been removed. You should now use `Option::None` if you wish to specify `AlignSelf::Auto`.\n  - `AlignSelf` is now an alias of `AlignItems`.\n  - `JustifyItems` and `JustifySelf` aliases have been added. These properties have no affect on Flexbox containers, but apply to Grid containers.\n- `Default` impls have been removed from all alignment types. This is because the correct default varies by property, and the types are now shared between multiple properties. The `Style` struct still has a default for each alignment property, so this is considered unlikely to affect you in practice.\n\n#### Strict style types\n\n- New types `LengthPercentage` and `LengthPercentageAuto` have been added.\n  - `LengthPercentage` is like `Dimension` but only contains the `Points` and `Percent` variants, which allows us to increase type safety for properties that don't support the `Auto` value.\n  - `LengthPercentageAuto` is currently identical to `Dimension` but will allow us to expand dimension in future to support values like `MinContent`, `MaxContent` and `FitContent`.\n- Some style properties have been updated to use either `LengthPercentage` or `LengthPercentageAuto` instead of `Dimension`. You will need to update your code, but it is recommended that you use the new style helpers (see above) rather than using the new types directly (although you certainly can use them directly if you want to).\n\n#### Position properties renamed\n\n- The `position` property is now renamed to `inset` and is now in line with [CSS inset specs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/inset)\n- The `position_type` property is now renamed to `position` and is now in line with [CSS position specs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position). The `PositionType` enum has been similarly renamed to `Position`.\n\n#### Changes to `LayoutTree`\n\n- Added generic associated type to `LayoutTree` for a `ChildIter`, an iterator on the children of a given node.\n- Changed the `children` method of `LayoutTree` to return the `ChildIter` generic associated type to allow for custom tree storage implementations which do not store the children of a node contiguously.\n- Added `child_count`  method to `LayoutTree` for querying the number of children of a node. Required because the `children` method now returns an iterator instead of an array.\n- Added `is_childless` method to `LayoutTree` for querying whether a node has no children.\n\n#### `AvailableSpace` has been moved\n\nThe `AvailableSpace` enum has been moved from the `layout` module to the `style` module. If you are importing it via the prelude then you will unaffected by the change.\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Flexbox nodes sized under a min-content constraint now size correctly (#291)\n- Aspect ratio is now applied correctly in many circumstances\n- Absolutely positioned items now apply margins correctly\n- Min/max size are now applied correctly\n- Inset applied incorrectly to relatively positioned flexbox children when both `top` and `bottom` or `left` and `right` were specified (#348)\n- Fix case where column-gap style could be used in place of row-gap style (when using a percentage gap with an indefinite container size)\n\n### Removed\n\n- Removed `top_from_points`, `bot_from_points`, `top_from_percent`, and `bot_from_percent` methods removed from `Rect<Dimension>`. These functions were incredibly specific for an unusual use case, so we would be surprised if anyone was using them. Please use the new style helpers instead.\n- Removed `min_main_size`, `max_main_size`, `min_cross_size`, `max_cross_size`, and `cross_size` methods from `Style`. Use the more general `cross` and `main` methods directly on the `size`, `min_size`, and `max_size` properties instead.\n- Removed `main_margin_start`, `main_margin_end`, `cross_margin_start`, `cross_margin_end` from `Style`. Use the more general `main_start`, `main_end`, `cross_start`, and `cross_end` on the `margin` property instead.\n\n## 0.2.2\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Border or padding on the horizontal axis could, in some cases, increase the height of nodes.\n\n## 0.2.1\n\n### Fixes\n\n- In case of conflicts, `min_size` now overrides `max_size` which overrides `size` (#261). This is the behaviour specified in the CSS specification, and was also the behaviour in Taffy `v0.1.0`, but a regression was introduced in Taffy `v0.2.0`.\n- `taffy::compute_layout` has been made public allowing Taffy to be used with custom storage (#263)\n\n## 0.2.0\n\n### New features\n\n#### Flexbox \"gap\" and `AlignContent::SpaceEvenly`\n\nThe [gap](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gap) property is now supported on flex containers. This can make it much easier to create even spacing or \"gutters\" between nodes.\n\nAdditionally we have a `SpaceEvenly` variant to the `AlignContent` enum to support evenly spaced justification in the cross axis (equivalent to  `align-content: space-evenly` in CSS)\n\n#### Debug module and cargo feature\n\nTwo debugging features have been added:\n\n- `taffy::debug::print_tree(&Taffy, root)` - This will print a debug representation of the computed layout of an entire node tree (starting at `root`), which can be useful for debugging layouts.\n- A cargo feature `debug`. This enabled debug logging of the layout computation process itself (this is probably mainly useful for those working taffy itself).\n\n### Performance improvements\n\nA number of performance improvements have landed since taffy 0.1:\n\n- Firstly, our custom `taffy::forest` storage implementation was ripped out and replaced with a much simpler implementation using the `slotmap` crate. This led to performance increases of up to 90%.\n- Secondly, the caching implementation was improved by upping the number of cache slots from 2 to 4 and tweaking how computed results are allocated to cache slots to better match the actual usage patterns of the flexbox layout algorithm. This had a particularly dramatic effect on deep hierarchies (which often involve recomputing the same results repeatedly), fixing the exponential blowup that was previously exhibited on these trees and improving performance by over 1000x in some cases!\n\n#### Benchmarks vs. Taffy 0.1\n\n| Benchmark                                 | Taffy 0.1 | Taffy 0.2 | % change (0.1 -> 0.2) |\n| ---                                       | ---       | ---       | ---                   |\n| wide/1_000 nodes (2-level hierarchy)      | 699.18 µs | 445.01 µs | -36.279%              |\n| wide/10_000 nodes (2-level hierarchy)     | 8.8244 ms | 7.1313 ms | -16.352%              |\n| wide/100_000 nodes (2-level hierarchy)    | 204.48 ms | 242.93 ms | +18.803%              |\n| deep/4000 nodes (12-level hierarchy))     | 5.2320 s  | 2.7363 ms | -99.947%              |\n| deep/10_000 nodes (14-level hierarchy)    | 75.207 s  | 6.9415 ms | -99.991%              |\n| deep/100_000 nodes (17-level hierarchy)   | -         | 102.72 ms | -                     |\n| deep/1_000_000 nodes (20-level hierarchy) | -         | 799.35 ms | -                     |\n\n(note that the table above contains multiple different units (milliseconds vs. microseconds vs. nanoseconds))\n\nAs you can see, we have actually regressed slightly in the \"wide\" benchmarks (where all nodes are siblings of a single parent node). Although it should be noted our results in these benchmarks are still very fast, especially on the 10,000 node benchmark which we consider to be the most realistic size where the result is measured in microseconds.\n\nHowever, in the \"deep\" benchmarks we see dramatic improvements. The previous version of Taffy suffered from exponential blowup in the case of deeply nested hierarchies. This has resulted in somewhat silly improvements like the 10,000 node (14-level) hierarchy where Taffy 0.2 is a full 1 million times faster than Taffy 0.1. We've also included results with larger numbers of nodes (although you're unlikely to need that many) to demonstrate that this scalability continues up to even deeper levels of nesting.\n\n#### Benchmarks vs. [Yoga](https://github.com/facebook/yoga)\n\nYoga benchmarks run via it's node.js bindings (the `yoga-layout-prebuilt` npm package), they were run a few times manually and it was verified that variance in the numbers of each run was minimal. It should be noted that this is using an old version of Yoga.\n\n| Benchmark | Yoga | Taffy 0.2 |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| yoga/10 nodes (1-level hierarchy) | 45.1670 µs | 33.297 ns |\n| yoga/100 nodes (2-level hierarchy) | 134.1250 µs | 336.53 ns |\n| yoga/1_000 nodes (3-level hierarchy) | 1.2221 ms | 3.8928 µs |\n| yoga/10_000 nodes (4-level hierarchy) | 13.8672 ms | 36.162 µs |\n| yoga/100_000 nodes (5-level hierarchy) | 141.5307 ms | 1.6404 ms |\n\n(note that the table above contains multiple different units (milliseconds vs. microseconds vs. nanoseconds))\n\nWhile we're trying not to get too excited (there could easily be an issue with our benchmarking methodology which make this an unfair comparison), we are pleased to see that we seem to be anywhere between 100x and 1000x times faster depending on the node count!\n\n### Breaking API changes\n\n#### Node creation changes\n\n- `taffy::Node` is now unique only to the Taffy instance from which it was created.\n- Renamed `Taffy.new_node(..)` -> `Taffy.new_with_children(..)`\n- Renamed `Taffy.new_leaf()` -> `Taffy.new_leaf_with_measure()`\n- Added `taffy::node::Taffy.new_leaf()` which allows the creation of new leaf-nodes without having to supply a measure function\n\n#### Error handling/representation improvements\n\n- Renamed `taffy::Error` -> `taffy::error::TaffyError`\n- Replaced `taffy::error::InvalidChild` with a new `InvalidChild` variant of `taffy::error::TaffyError`\n- Replaced `taffy::error::InvalidNode` with a new `InvalidNode` variant of `taffy::error::TaffyError`\n- The following method new return `Err(TaffyError::ChildIndexOutOfBounds)` instead of panicking:\n  - `taffy::Taffy::remove_child_at_index`\n  - `taffy::Taffy::replace_child_at_index`\n  - `taffy::Taffy::child_at_index`\n- `Taffy::remove` now returns a `Result<usize, Error>`, to indicate if the operation was successful (and if it was, which ID was invalidated).\n\n#### Some uses of `Option<f32>` replaced with a new `AvailableSpace` enum\n\nA new enum `Taffy::layout::AvailableSpace` has been added.\n\nThe definition looks like this:\n\n```rust\n/// The amount of space available to a node in a given axis\npub enum AvailableSpace {\n    /// The amount of space available is the specified number of pixels\n    Definite(f32),\n    /// The amount of space available is indefinite and the node should be laid out under a min-content constraint\n    MinContent,\n    /// The amount of space available is indefinite and the node should be laid out under a max-content constraint\n    MaxContent,\n}\n```\n\nThis enum is now used instead of `Option<f32>` when calling `Taffy.compute_layout` (if you previously passing `Size::NONE` to `compute_layout`, then you will need to change this to `Size::MAX_CONTENT`).\n\nAnd a different instance of it is passed as a new second parameter to `MeasureFunc`. `MeasureFunc`s may choose to use this parameter in their computation or ignore it as they see fit. The canonical example of when it makes sense to use it is when laying out text. If `MinContent` has been passed in the axis in which the text is flowing (i.e. the horizontal axis for left-to-right text), then you should line-break at every possible opportunity (e.g. all word boundaries), whereas if `MaxContent` has been passed then you shouldn't line break at all..\n\n#### Builder methods are now `const` where possible\n\n- Several convenience constants have been defined: notably `Style::DEFAULT`\n- `Size<f32>.zero()` is now `Size::<f32>::ZERO`\n- `Point<f32>.zero()` is now  `Point::<f32>::ZERO`\n- `Size::undefined()` is now `Size::NONE`\n\n#### Removals\n\n- Removed `taffy::forest::Forest`. `taffy::node::Taffy` now handles it's own storage using a slotmap (which comes with a performance boost up to 90%).\n- Removed `taffy::number::Number`. Use `Option<f32>` is used instead\n  - the associated public `MinMax` and `OrElse` traits have also been removed; these should never have been public\n- Removed unused dependencies `hashbrown`, `hash32`, and `typenum`. `slotmap` is now the only required dependency (`num_traits` and `arrayvec` are also required if you wish to use taffy in a `no_std` environment).\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Miscellaneous correctness fixes which align our implementation with Chrome:\n\n  - Nodes can only ever have one parent\n  - Fixed rounding of fractional values to follow latest Chrome - values are now rounded the same regardless of their position\n  - Fixed computing free space when using both `flex-grow` and a minimum size\n  - Padding is now only subtracted when determining the available space if the node size is unspecified, following [section 9.2.2 of the flexbox spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#line-sizing)\n  - `MeasureFunc` (and hence `NodeData` and hence `Forest` and hence the public `Taffy` type) are now `Send` and `Sync`, enabling their use in async and parallel applications\n- Taffy can now be vendored using `cargo-vendor` (README.md is now included in package).\n\n## 0.1.0\n\n### 0.1.0 Changed\n\n- the `order` field of `Layout` is now public, and describes the relative z-ordering of nodes\n- renamed crate from `stretch2` to `taffy`\n- updated to the latest version of all dependencies to reduce upstream pain caused by duplicate dependencies\n- renamed `stretch::node::Stretch` -> `taffy::node::Taffy`\n\n### 0.1.0 Fixed\n\n- fixed feature strategy for `alloc` and `std`: these can now be compiled together, with `std`'s types taking priority\n\n### 0.1.0 Removed\n\n- removed Javascript / Kotlin / Swift bindings\n  - the maintainer team lacks expertise to keep these working\n  - more serious refactors are planned, and this will be challenging to keep working through that process\n  - if you are interested in helping us maintain bindings to other languages, [get in touch](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy/discussions)!\n- the `serde_camel_case` and `serde_kebab_case` features have been removed: they were poorly motivated and were not correctly additive (if both were enabled compilation would fail)\n- removed the `Direction` and `Overflow` structs, and the corresponding `direction` and `overflow` fields from `Style`\n  - these had no effect in the current code base and were actively misleading\n\n## stretch2 0.4.3\n\nThis is the final release of `stretch`: migrate to the crate named `taffy` for future fixes and features!\n\nThese notes describe the differences between this release and `stretch` 0.3.2, the abandoned crate from which this library was forked.\n\n### Changed\n\n- updated [assorted dependencies](https://github.com/vislyhq/stretch/commit/a6491117379cea52dedc9584d892594a143e8cb0)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- fixed an exponential performance blow-up with deep nesting\n- fixed percent height values, which were using parent width\n- recomputing layout no longer moves children of non-zero-positioned parent\n- fixed broken Swift bindings\n"

Respond to feedback from reviewers and make sure CI passes.\r\n\r\nThe PR review process is completely open:  help us by commenting on, testing and approving PRs.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to help on a consistent basis or are interested in project management, create a Discussions post, and we'll be happy to hand out triage rights.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n### Running tests\r\n\r\nFlexbox layouts are tested by validating that layouts written in this crate perform the same as in Chrome.\r\nThis is done by rendering an equivalent layout in HTML and then generating a Rust test case which asserts that the resulting layout is the same when run through our layout engine.\r\n\r\nYou can run these tests without setting up a webdriver environment but if you are looking to add any test case you will need to install [chromedriver](http://chromedriver.chromium.org) and [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/).\r\nIf you are developing on macOS this is easy to do through brew.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nbrew install chromedriver\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are Ubuntu, you will have to install `openssl` first,\r\nand then can follow [these instructions](https://tecadmin.net/setup-selenium-chromedriver-on-ubuntu/).\r\nBe sure that your Chrome version matches the downloaded `chromedriver` version!\r\n\r\nOnce you have chromedriver installed and available in `PATH` you can re-generate all tests by running `cargo gentest`. You should not manually update the tests in `tests/generated`. Instead, fix the script in `scripts/gentest/` and re-generate them. This can happen after a refactor. It can be helpful to commit the updated tests in a dedicated commit so that they can be easier to ignore during review.\r\n\r\nTo add a new test case add another HTML file to `/test_fixtures` following the current tests as a template for new tests.\r\n\r\n**Note: test fixtures (HTML files in the `text_fixtures` directory) that begin with an \"x\" are considered disabled, and the test generation script will not generate a test for them (and as the test generation script overwrites the entire directory when generating tests, this means that prefixing an existing test with an \"x\" and then running the test generation script will delete that test)**\r\n\r\n### Writing tests\r\n\r\n1. All tests should be wrapped in a module called `tests` gated by the standard `test` feature flag, to ensure they are not compiled unless tests are being run.\r\n\r\n    ```rs\r\n    #[cfg(test)]\r\n    mod tests {\r\n        // Place tests here\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n2. For unit-testing this should be placed in the same file as the code they are testing\r\n    1. If files become extremely long (more than a couple thousand lines of code), tests should be split out into its own file under the same module\r\n\r\n    ```rs\r\n    // file: ./src/my_struct.rs\r\n    struct MyStruct;\r\n\r\n    impl MyStruct {\r\n        fn some_method() { .. }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    #[cfg(test)]\r\n    mod tests {\r\n        #[test]\r\n        fn test_of_some_method() { .. }\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n3. For integration tests this should be placed within the `./tests` folder\r\n\r\n    ```rs\r\n    // file: ./tests/my_integration_test.rs\r\n    #[test]\r\n    fn integration_test_one() { .. }\r\n    #[test]\r\n    fn integration_test_two() { .. }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n4. Each test should have a clear intent\r\n    1. It should be evident what is being tested (naming, code, comments)\r\n    2. When this test fails, it should be easy to understand what went wrong\r\n    3. Fixture-based tests (`#[rstest]`) can help improve clarity when many related scenarios need to be checked\r\n\r\n## Benchmarking\r\n\r\nBenchmarks build on the same infrastructure as testing, and actually benchmarks are automatically generated from test fixtures just like tests.\r\nRun `cargo xbench` to run benchmarks locally. To run head-to-head benchmarks with Yoga, run `cargo xbench --features yoga`. You will need `libclang-dev` or the xcode commandline tools installed in order to run the yoga benchmarks.\r\n"

Support for other paradigms is planned. For more information on this and other future development plans see the [roadmap issue](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy/issues/345).\n\nThis crate is a collaborative, cross-team project, and is designed to be used as a dependency for other UI and GUI libraries.\nRight now, it powers:\n\n- [Servo](https://github.com/servo/servo): an alternative web browser\n- [Blitz](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/blitz): a radically modular web engine\n- [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/): an ergonomic, ECS-first Rust game engine\n- The [Lapce](https://lapce.dev/) text editor via the [Floem](https://github.com/lapce/floem) UI framework\n- The [Zed](https://zed.dev/) text editor via the [GPUI](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/tree/main/crates/gpui) UI framework\n\n## Usage\n\n```rust\nuse taffy::prelude::*;\n\n// First create an instance of TaffyTree\nlet mut tree : TaffyTree<()> = TaffyTree::new();\n\n// Create a tree of nodes using `TaffyTree.new_leaf` and `TaffyTree.new_with_children`.\n// These functions both return a node id which can be used to refer to that node\n// The Style struct is used to specify styling information\nlet header_node = tree\n    .new_leaf(\n        Style {\n            size: Size { width: length(800.0), height: length(100.0) },\n            ..Default::default()\n        },\n    ).unwrap();\n\nlet body_node = tree\n    .new_leaf(\n        Style {\n            size: Size { width: length(800.0), height: auto() },\n            flex_grow: 1.0,\n            ..Default::default()\n        },\n    ).unwrap();\n\nlet root_node = tree\n    .new_with_children(\n        Style {\n            flex_direction: FlexDirection::Column,\n            size: Size { width: length(800.0), height: length(600.0) },\n            ..Default::default()\n        },\n        &[header_node, body_node],\n    )\n    .unwrap();\n\n// Call compute_layout on the root of your tree to run the layout algorithm\ntree.compute_layout(root_node, Size::MAX_CONTENT).unwrap();\n\n// Inspect the computed layout using `TaffyTree.layout`\nassert_eq!(tree.layout(root_node).unwrap().size.width, 800.0);\nassert_eq!(tree.layout(root_node).unwrap().size.height, 600.0);\nassert_eq!(tree.layout(header_node).unwrap().size.width, 800.0);\nassert_eq!(tree.layout(header_node).unwrap().size.height, 100.0);\nassert_eq!(tree.layout(body_node).unwrap().size.width, 800.0);\nassert_eq!(tree.layout(body_node).unwrap().size.height, 500.0); // This value was not set explicitly, but was computed by Taffy\n\n```\n\n## Bindings to other languages\n\n- Python via [stretchable](https://github.com/mortencombat/stretchable)\n- [WIP C bindings](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy/pull/404)\n- [WIP WASM bindings](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy/pull/394)\n\n## Learning Resources\n\nTaffy implements the Flexbox and CSS Grid specifications faithfully, so documentation designed for the web should translate cleanly to Taffy's implementation. For reference documentation on individual style properties we recommend the MDN documentation (for example [this page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/width) on the `width` property). Such pages can usually be found by searching for \"MDN property-name\" using a search engine.\n\nIf you are interested in guide-level documentation on CSS layout, then we recommend the following resources:\n\n### Flexbox\n\n- [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/). This is an interactive tutorial/game that allows you to learn the essential parts of Flexbox in a fun engaging way.\n- [A Complete Guide To Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) by CSS Tricks. This is detailed guide with illustrations and comprehensive written explanation of the different Flexbox properties and how they work.\n\n### CSS Grid\n\n- [CSS Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/). This is an interactive tutorial/game that allows you to learn the essential parts of CSS Grid in a fun engaging way.\n- [A Complete Guide To CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) by CSS Tricks. This is detailed guide with illustrations and comprehensive written explanation of the different CSS Grid properties and how they work.\n\n## Benchmarks (vs. [Yoga](https://github.com/facebook/yoga))\n\n- Run on a 2021 MacBook Pro with M1 Pro processor using [criterion](https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs)\n- The benchmarks measure layout computation only. They do not measure tree creation.\n- Yoga benchmarks were run via the [yoga](https://github.com/bschwind/yoga-rs) crate (Rust bindings)\n- Most popular websites seem to have between 3,000 and 10,000 nodes (although they also require text layout, which neither yoga nor taffy implement).\n\nNote that the table below contains multiple different units (milliseconds vs. microseconds)\n\n| Benchmark          | Node Count | Depth | Yoga ([ba27f9d]) | Taffy ([71027a8]) |\n| ---                | ---        | ---   | ---              | ---               |\n| yoga 'huge nested' | 1,000      | 3     | 364.60 µs        | 329.04 µs         |\n| yoga 'huge nested' | 10,000     | 4     | 4.1988 ms        | 4.3486 ms         |\n| yoga 'huge nested' | 100,000    | 5     | 45.804 ms        | 38.559 ms         |\n| big trees (wide)   | 1,000      | 1     | 737.77 µs        | 505.99 µs         |\n| big trees (wide)   | 10,000     | 1     | 7.1007 ms        | 8.3395 ms         |\n| big trees (wide)   | 100,000    | 1     | 135.78 ms        | 247.42 ms         |\n| big trees (deep)   | 4,000      | 12    | 2.2333 ms        | 1.7400 ms         |\n| big trees (deep)   | 10,000     | 14    | 5.9477 ms        | 4.4445 ms         |\n| big trees (deep)   | 100,000    | 17    | 76.755 ms        | 63.778 ms         |\n| super deep         | 1,000      | 1,000 | 555.32 µs        | 472.85 µs         |\n\n[ba27f9d]: https://github.com/facebook/yoga/commit/ba27f9d1ecfa7518019845b84b035d3d4a2a6658\n[71027a8]: https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy/commit/71027a8de03b343e120852b84bb7dca9fb4651c5\n\n## Contributions\n\n[Contributions welcome](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md):\nif you'd like to use, improve or build `taffy`, feel free to join the conversation, open an [issue](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy/issues) or submit a [PR](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy/pulls).\nIf you have questions about how to use `taffy`, open a [discussion](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy/discussions) so we can answer your questions in a way that others can find.\n"
