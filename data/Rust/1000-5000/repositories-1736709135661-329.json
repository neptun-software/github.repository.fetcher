[#130](https://github.com/1Password/typeshare/pull/130)\n\n### Community contributors\n\nThank you to the following community contributors for your work on this release:\n\n- [czocher](https://github.com/czocher)\n- [ipetkov](https://github.com/ipetkov)\n\n# Version 1.7.0\n\nThis release brings support for more rust primitive types (slices and chars), as well as support for manually overriding the output type in the `#[typeshare]` annotations\n\n- Added support for the Rust slice type, which is treated as a sequence. [#131](https://github.com/1Password/typeshare/pull/131)\n- Added support for the Rust char type, which is treated as a string. [#128](https://github.com/1Password/typeshare/pull/128)\n- Better error messages when there's an error reading a file. [#117](https://github.com/1Password/typeshare/pull/117)\n- It is now possible to manually override the output type for specific fields using the `#[typeshare]` annotation. [#119](https://github.com/1Password/typeshare/pull/119), [#118](https://github.com/1Password/typeshare/pull/118)\n- Fixed: in Swift, apply generic constraints to enums, in addition to structs. [#122](https://github.com/1Password/typeshare/pull/122)\n- In an effort to ensure we don't accidentally break compatibility with our Minimum Supported Rust Version, we added a `rust-toolchain.toml` to the rust crates, forcing builds and tests to use that version of rust. [#129](https://github.com/1Password/typeshare/pull/129), [#135](https://github.com/1Password/typeshare/pull/135). This change should have no effect on end users.\n\n### Community contributors\n\nThank you to the following community contributors for your work on this release:\n\n- [czocher](https://github.com/czocher)\n- [xhain](https://github.com/xhain)\n\n# Version 1.6.0\n\nThis release brings support for more architectures for Nix and configurable generic constraints in Swift\n\n- The Nix flake now supports all default Nix platforms, rather than only `x86_64-linux`. [#113](https://github.com/1Password/typeshare/pull/113)\n- `typeshare-core`\n  - It is now possible to add your own set of generic constraints to Swift generics. This is done with a field called `default_generic_constraints` under `[swift]` in `typeshare.toml`. [#95](https://github.com/1Password/typeshare/pull/95/)\n\n# Version 1.5.1\n\nThis release brings support for standalone installations into Nix, as well as corrections for certain unusual edge case behaviors.\n\n- Added a Nix flake, which allows for installing typeshare outside of NixPkgs\n- `typeshare-core`\n  - Now supports types in inline modules. [#109](https://github.com/1Password/typeshare/pull/109)\n  - Now throws an error if `#[serde(flatten)]` is used, instead of silently generating incorrect types [#108](https://github.com/1Password/typeshare/pull/108)\n  - When generating the `CodableVoid` type in swift, we now always include the `Codable` decorator, even if it's omitted from the list of `default_decorators` in `typeshare.toml` [#107](https://github.com/1Password/typeshare/pull/107)\n\n### Community contributors\n\nThank you to the following community contributors for your work on this release:\n\n- [nguarracino](https://github.com/nguarracino)\n\n# Version 1.5.0\n\nThis release brings support for fixed-length arrays and fixes some premature changes made in 1.4.0 involving the\nrepresentation of unit types and enum variants in Typescript.\n\n- `typeshare-core`\n  - Fixed-length arrays in the form of `[T; N]` are now supported.\n  - Reverted changes made to the representation of unit types in Typescript.<sup>1</sup>\n\n<sup>1</sup> We apologize for the premature changes to the representation of unit types. This was done to improve\ncorrectness and compatibility with various JSON libraries, however it ended up causing a regression by invalidating\ncertain usages. For now, we've reverted the changes so your projects can get back on track, and we are working to bring\nthese improvements while mitigating the issues discovered. Thank you for bringing this to our attention.\n\n### Community contributors\n\nThank you to the following community contributors for your work on this release:\n\n- [ccouzens](https://github.com/ccouzens)\n\n# Version 1.4.0\n\nThis release brings topological sorting of types based on dependencies to generated files, as well as fixes several bugs.\n\n- `typeshare-core`\n  - Types are now outputted in order of dependency - types depending on others will be written after those without dependencies.\n  - Unit types are now represented as null in Typescript\n  - Deserialization for optional associated types in enum variants has been fixed.\n\n### Community contributors\n\nThank you to the following community contributors for your work on this release:\n\n- [adriangb](https://github.com/adriangb)\n\n# Version 1.3.0\n\nThis release brings minor changes to snapshot testing by adding an additional option to remove version headers from generated code. This will make our snapshot tests more robust by preventing test breakage that used to occur when updating our version.\n\n- `typeshare-core`\n  - Each language implementation now has an additional public variable that can be set to remove version headers from generated code.\n\n# Version 1.2.0\n\nThis release brings Scala functionality to the CLI, support for Apple Silicon as a pre-built binary, and refactors how\nwe handle language variants internally to be more type-safe.\n\n- `typeshare-cli`\n  - Scala is now a language generation target! Try it out with `typeshare --lang=scala --scala-package=com.your.package.here some/file.rs`\n  - Future releases (including this one) now support aarch64-apple-darwin as an additional architecture.\n- `typeshare-core`\n  - Language variants are now represented as enums instead of strings.\n\n### Community contributors\n\nThank you to the following community contributors for your work on this release:\n\n- [jclmnop](https://github.com/jclmnop)\n- [oeb25](https://github.com/oeb25)\n- [DuhPesky](https://github.com/DuhPesky)\n- [exoego](https://github.com/exoego)\n\n# Version 1.1.0\n\nThis release brings major new additions, the largest of which is support for Scala as a language generation target.\nAdditionally, the code generation API has been expanded/revised, and many bugs have been fixed.\n\n- `typeshare-cli`\n\n  - Kotlin now uses `val` consistently for defining fields.\n  - Some issues with the command line options have been corrected.\n  - Unit structs that don't use bracket syntax are now supported.\n  - Typescript can now handle type aliases of optional types.\n  - Empty structs are now represented as objects in Kotlin.\n  - You can now define read-only Typescript properties with `#[typeshare(typescript(readonly))]`.\n  - Doubly-nested option types (`Option<Option<T>>`) are now supported in Typescript.\n\n- `typeshare-core`\n\n  - The `Language` trait now takes `self` mutably for more flexibility in implementations.\n  - Scala is now a supported language for code generation, though the CLI does not use it yet.\n  - The attribute parser has been reworked to be more robust and flexible for future additions.\n\n- Miscellaneous\n  - We now have a proper release system and prebuilt binaries for anyone to download 🎉\n  - Releases will be weekly on every Thursday.\n\n### Community Contributors\n\nThank you to the following community contributors for your work on this release:\n\n[exoego](https://github.com/exoego), [Czocher](https://github.com/Czocher), [ccouzens](https://github.com/ccouzens),\n[McAJBen](https://github.com/McAJBen), [adriangb](https://github.com/adriangb), [kareid](https://github.com/kareid),\n[nihaals](https://github.com/nihaals), [ChrisMcKenzie](https://github.com/ChrisMcKenzie), [justintime4tea](https://github.com/justintime4tea),\n[prestontw](https://github.com/prestontw), and [julienfouilhe](https://github.com/julienfouilhe)!\n"

Be honest, nobody does. Typeshare is here to take that burden away from you! Leveraging the power of the `serde` library, Typeshare is a tool that converts your\nRust types into their equivalent forms in Swift, Go**, Python**, Kotlin, Scala and Typescript, keeping\nyour cross-language codebase in sync. With automatic implementation for serialization and deserialization on both sides of the FFI, Typeshare does all the heavy lifting for you. It can even handle generics and convert effortlessly between standard libraries in different languages!\n\n**A few caveats. See [here](#a-quick-refresher-on-supported-languages) for more details.\n\n## Installation\n\n\nTo install the CLI (Command Line Interface):\n```\ncargo install typeshare-cli\n```\n\n💡Note that the console command will be `typeshare`, not `typeshare-cli`.\n\nIn your `Cargo.toml`, under `[dependencies]`:\n\n```toml\ntypeshare = \"1.0.0\"\n```\n\n## Using Typeshare\nWe've put together a book that documents (almost) everything you can do.\n\n📚[Read the Typeshare book here!](https://1password.github.io/typeshare)\n\nTo generate FFI definitions for a target language, run the `typeshare` command and specify the directory containing your rust code, the language you would like to generate for, and the file to which your generated definitions will be written:\n```\ntypeshare ./my_rust_project --lang=kotlin --output-file=my_kotlin_definitions.kt\ntypeshare ./my_rust_project --lang=swift --output-file=my_swift_definitions.swift\ntypeshare ./my_rust_project --lang=scala --output-file=my_scala_definitions.scala\ntypeshare ./my_rust_project --lang=typescript --output-file=my_typescript_definitions.ts\n```\n\n### Annotating Types\n\nInclude the `#[typeshare]` attribute with any struct or enum you define to generate definitions for that type in the selected output language.\n\n```rust\n// Rust type definitions\n\n#[typeshare]\nstruct MyStruct {\n    my_name: String,\n    my_age: u32,\n}\n\n#[typeshare]\n#[serde(tag = \"type\", content = \"content\")]\nenum MyEnum {\n    MyVariant(bool),\n    MyOtherVariant,\n    MyNumber(u32),\n}\n```\n```typescript\n// Generated Typescript definitions\n\nexport interface MyStruct {\n    my_name: string;\n    my_age: number;\n}\n\nexport type MyEnum =\n    | { type: \"MyVariant\", content: boolean }\n    | { type: \"MyOtherVariant\", content: undefined }\n    | { type: \"MyNumber\", content: number };\n```\n\n## Getting Help\n\nAre you getting weird deserialization issues? Did our procedural macro throw a confusing error at you? Are you trying to contribute and our existing codebase is confusing? (probably true) Did you have another problem not enumerated in this reductive list? Please open an issue in this repository and the 1Password team would be happy to help! That's what we're here for!\n\n## A Quick Refresher on Supported Languages\n\n- Kotlin\n- Scala\n- Swift\n- Typescript\n- Go**\n- Python** (see list of limitations [here](https://github.com/1Password/typeshare/issues/217))\n\n\nIf there is a language that you want Typeshare to generate definitions for, you can either:\n1. Open an issue in this repository requesting your language of choice.\n2. Implement support for that language and open a PR with your implementation. We would be eternally grateful! 🙏\n\n** Right now, Go and Python support is experimental. Enable the `go` or `python` features, respectively, when installing typeshare-cli if you want to use these.\n\n## Credits\n\nMade with ❤️ and ☕ by the [1Password](https://1password.com/) team.\n\n### Get a free 1Password account for your open source project\n\nDoes your team need a secure way to manage passwords and other credentials for your open source project?
