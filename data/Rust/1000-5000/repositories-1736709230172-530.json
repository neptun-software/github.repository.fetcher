See the\nGNU General Public License for more details.\n\nFull license text follows.\n\n### Preamble\n\nThe GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works.\n\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom\nto share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains\nfree software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use\nthe GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies\nalso to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply\nit to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you\nhave certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the\nsoftware, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom\nof others.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\nFor the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the\nmanufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the\naim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The\nsystematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for\nindividuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.\nTherefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the\npractice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in\nother domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those\ndomains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the\nfreedom of users.\n\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish\nto avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program\ncould make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL\nassures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n### TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n#### 0. Definitions.\n\n\"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n\"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds\nof works, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n\"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\nTo \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of\nan exact copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of\nthe earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\nA \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\nTo \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\nTo \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user\nthrough a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not\nconveying.\n\nAn interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\" to\nthe extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n#### 1. Source Code.\n\nThe \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it. \"Object code\" means any non-source form of\na work.\n\nA \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\nThe \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form. A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\nThe \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities. However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can\nregenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same\nwork.\n\n#### 2. Basic Permissions.\n\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,\nwithout conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.\nYou may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having\nthem make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with\nfacilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the\nterms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not\ncontrol copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for\nyou must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and\ncontrol, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your\ncopyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the\nconditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes\nit unnecessary.\n\n#### 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such\ncircumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with\nrespect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit\noperation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against\nthe work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures.\n\n#### 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n#### 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these\nconditions:\n\n-   a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n-   b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under\n    section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4\n    to \"keep intact all notices\".\n-   c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n-   d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n#### 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of\nsections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable\nCorresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these\nways:\n\n-   a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n-   b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding\n    Source from a network server at no charge.\n-   c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n-   d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n-   e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,\n    provided you inform other peers where the object code and\n    Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general\n    public at no charge under subsection 6d.\n\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\nA \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal,\nfamily, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for\nincorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a\nconsumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of\ncoverage. For a particular product received by a particular user,\n\"normally used\" refers to a typical or common use of that class of\nproduct, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way\nin which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected\nto use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of\nwhether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or\nnon-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant\nmode of use of the product.\n\n\"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to\ninstall and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User\nProduct from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The\ninformation must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of\nthe modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with\nsolely because modification has been made.\n\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or\nupdates for a work that has been modified or installed by the\nrecipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or\ninstalled. Access to a network may be denied when the modification\nitself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network\nor violates the rules and protocols for communication across the\nnetwork.\n\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n#### 7. Additional Terms.\n\n\"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders\nof that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n-   a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n-   b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n-   c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,\n    or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n-   d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors\n    or authors of the material; or\n-   e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n-   f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions\n    of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient,\n    for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly\n    impose on those licensors and authors.\n\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the\nabove requirements apply either way.\n\n#### 8. Termination.\n\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license\nfrom a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,\nunless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally\nterminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder\nfails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to\n60 days after the cessation.\n\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n#### 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run\na copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n#### 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\nAn \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n#### 11. Patents.\n\nA \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\nA contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims owned\nor controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version. For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\nIn the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement). To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients. \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\nA patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within the\nscope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on\nthe non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically\ngranted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you\nare a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the\nbusiness of distributing software, under which you make payment to the\nthird party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the\nwork, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties\nwho would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent\nlicense (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by\nyou (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in\nconnection with specific products or compilations that contain the\ncovered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent\nlicense was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n#### 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under\nthis License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a\nconsequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to\nterms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying\nfrom those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could\nsatisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely\nfrom conveying the Program.\n\n#### 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n#### 14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions\nwill be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in\ndetail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program\nspecifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public\nLicense \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of\nfollowing the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or\nof any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the\nProgram does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public\nLicense, you may choose any version ever published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.\n\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions\nof the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public\nstatement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to\nchoose that version for the Program.\n\nLater license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n#### 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT\nWARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT\nLIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\nA PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND\nPERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE\nDEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR\nCORRECTION.\n\n#### 16. Limitation of Liability.\n\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR\nCONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES\nARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT\nNOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR\nLOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM\nTO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER\nPARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n#### 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n### How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these\nterms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to\nattach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state\nthe exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n        <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n        Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n        This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n        the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n        (at your option) any later version.\n\n        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n        but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n        GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n        along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper\nmail.\n\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n        <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n        This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n        This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n        under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands \\`show w' and \\`show c' should show the\nappropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your\nprogram's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would\nuse an \"about box\".\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow\nthe GNU GPL, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your\nprogram into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine\nlibrary, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary\napplications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the\nGNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first,\nplease read <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>."

It establishes a fully-meshed self-healing VPN network in a peer-to-peer manner with strong end-to-end encryption based on elliptic curve keys and AES-256. VpnCloud creates a virtual network interface on the host and forwards all received data via UDP to the destination. It can work on TUN devices (IP based) and TAP devices (Ethernet based).\n\n```sh\n$> vpncloud -c REMOTE_HOST:PORT -p 'mypassword' --ip 10.0.0.1/24\n```\n\nor as config file:\n\n```yaml\ncrypto:\n  password: mysecret\nip: 10.0.0.1\npeers:\n  - REMOTE_HOST:PORT\n```\n\nFor more information, please see the [Website](https://vpncloud.ddswd.de) or the [Discussions group](https://github.com/dswd/vpncloud/discussions).\n\n\n### Project Status\nThis project is still [under development](CHANGELOG.md) but has reached a\nsomewhat stable state. VpnCloud features the following functionality:\n\n* Automatic peer-to-peer meshing, no central servers\n* Automatic reconnecting when connections are lost\n* Connecting hundreds of nodes with the VPN\n* High throughput and low additional latency (see [performance page](https://vpncloud.ddswd.de/features/performance))\n* Creating virtual network interfaces based on Ethernet (TAP) and IP (TUN)\n* Strong end-to-end encryption using Curve25519 key pairs and AES methods\n* Support for different forwarding/routing behaviors (Hub, Switch, Router)\n* NAT and firewall traversal using hole punching\n* Automatic port forwarding via UPnP\n* Websocket proxy mode for restrictive environments\n* Support for tunneled VLans (TAP devices)\n* Support for publishing [beacons](https://vpncloud.ddswd.de/docs/beacons) to help nodes find each others\n* Support for statsd monitoring\n* Low memory footprint\n* Single binary, no dependencies, no kernel module\n\n### Installing\n\n#### Compiling from source\nPrerequisites: Git, [Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/install.html), asciidoctor\n\nThe checked-out code can be compiled with ``cargo build`` or ``cargo build --release`` (release version). The binary could then be found in `target/release/vpncloud`.\n\nThe tests can be run via ``cargo test``.\n\n\n#### Cross-Compiling & packaging\nPlease see the [builder folder](builder).\n\n\n### Contributions welcome\nThere are several areas in which still some work has to be done and where\ncontributions are very welcome:\n\n* **Linux packages**: VpnCloud is stable enough to be packaged for Linux\n  distributions. Maintainers who want to package VpnCloud are very welcome.\n* **Help with other platforms**: If you are a Rust developer with experience\n  on Windows or MacOS your help on porting VpnCloud to those platforms is very\n  welcome.\n* **Security review**: The security has been implemented with strong security\n  primitives but it would be great if a cryptography expert could verify the\n  system.\n* **Feedback on use cases**: Some feedback on how VpnCloud is being used and\n  maybe some tutorials covering common use cases would be nice.\n\n\n### Semantic Versioning\nThis project uses [semantic versioning](http://semver.org).\n"

Please see the section\n  *CONFIG FILES* for documentation on the file format.\n  If the same option is defined in the config file and as a parameter, the\n  parameter overrides the config file.\n\n*-t <type>*, *--type <type>*::\n  Set the type of network. There are two options: *tap* devices process\n  Ethernet frames *tun* devices process IP packets. [default: *tun*]\n\n*-d <name>*, *--device <name>*::\n  Name of the virtual device. Any *%d* will be filled with a free number.\n  [default: *vpncloud%d*]\n\n*--device-path <path>*::\n  The path of the base device inode, e.g. /dev/net/tun.\n\n*--fix-rp-filter*::\n  If this option is set, VpnCloud will change the rp_filter settings to protect\n  against a potential system vulnerability. See *SECURITY* for more info.\n\n*-m <mode>*, *--mode <mode>*::\n  The mode of the VPN. The VPN can like a router, a switch or a hub. A *hub*\n  will send all data always to all peers. A *switch* will learn addresses\n  from incoming data and only send data to all peers when the address is\n  unknown. A *router* will send data according to known subnets of the\n  peers and ignore them otherwise. The *normal* mode is switch for tap\n  devices and router for tun devices. [default: *normal*]\n\n*-l <addr>*, *--listen <addr>*::\n  The address on which to listen for data. This can be simply a port number\n  or a full address in form IP:PORT. If the IP is specified as \\'\\*' or only\n  a port number is given, then the socket will listen on all IPs (v4 and v6),\n  otherwise the socket will only listen on the given IP.\n  Alternatively, a websocket proxy URL (starting with ws://) can be given \n  here. Please see the section *WEBSOCKET PROXY* for more info.\n  [default: **3210**]\n\n*-c <addr>*, *--peer <addr>*, *--connect <addr>*::\n  Address of a peer to connect to. The address should be in the form\n  *addr:port*. If the node is not started, the connection will be retried\n  periodically. This parameter can be repeated to connect to multiple peers.\n\n*--claim <subnet>*::\n  The local subnets to claim. This parameter should be in the form\n  *address/prefixlen* where address is an IPv4 address, an IPv6 address, or a\n  MAC address. The prefix length is the number of significant front bits that\n  distinguish the subnet from other subnets. Example: *10.1.1.0/24*.\n\n*--no-auto-claim*::\n  Do not automatically claim the IP set on the virtual interface (on TUN \n  devices).\n\n*-p <password>*, *--password <password>*::\n  A password to encrypt the VPN data. This parameter must be set unless a \n  password is given in a config file or a private key is set.\n  See *SECURITY* for more info.\n\n*--key <key>*, *--private-key <key>*::\n  A private key to use for encryption. The key must be given as base62 as \n  generated by *genkey*. See *SECURITY* for more info.\n\n*--public-key <key>*::\n  A public key matching the given private key. The key must be given as base62\n  as generated by *genkey*. This argument is purely optional. See *SECURITY*\n  for more info.\n\n*--trust <key>*, **--trusted-key <key>*::\n  A public key to trust. Any peer must have a key pair that is trusted by this\n  node, otherwise it will be rejected. The key must be given as base62 as \n  generated by *genkey*. This argument can be given multiple times.

It can work in 3 different modes:\n\n*Switch mode*:: In this mode, the VPN will dynamically learn addresses\nas they are used as source addresses by peers and use them to forward data to \nits destination. Addresses that have not been seen for some time\n(option *switch_timeout*) will be forgotten. Data for unknown addresses will be\nbroadcast to all peers. This mode is the default mode for TAP devices that\nprocess Ethernet frames but it can also be used with TUN devices and IP\npackets.\n*Hub mode*:: In this mode, all data will always be broadcast to all peers.\nThis mode uses lots of bandwidth and should only be used in special cases.\n*Router mode*:: In this mode, data will be forwarded based on preconfigured\naddress ranges (\"claims\"). Data for unclaimed addresses will be silently \nignored. This mode is the default mode for TUN devices that work with IP \npackets but it can also be used with TAP devices and Ethernet frames.\n\nAll connected VpnCloud nodes will form a peer-to-peer network and cross-connect\nautomatically until the network is fully connected. The nodes will periodically\nexchange information with the other nodes to signal that they are still active\nand to allow the automatic cross-connect behavior. There are some important\nthings to note:\n\n. The cross-connect behavior can be able to connect nodes that are behind\nfirewalls or NATs as it can function as hole-punching.\n. The management traffic will increase with the peer number quadratically.\nIt should still be reasonably small for high node numbers (below 10 KiB/s\nfor 10.000 nodes). A longer *peer_timeout* can be used to reduce the traffic\nfurther. For high node numbers, router mode should be used as it never\nbroadcasts data.\n\nVpnCloud does not implement any loop-avoidance. Since data received on the UDP\nsocket will only be sent to the local network interface and vice versa, VpnCloud\ncannot produce loops on its own. On a TAP device, however STP data can be\ntransported to avoid loops caused by other network components.\n\nFor TAP devices, IEEE 802.1q frames (VLAN tagged) are detected and forwarded\nbased on separate MAC tables. Any nested tags (Q-in-Q) will be ignored.\n\n\n== EXAMPLES\n\n=== Simple multi-node connectivity\n\nIn the example scenario, a simple layer-3 network tunnel is established. Most\nlikely those commands need to be run as *root* using *sudo*.\n\nFirst, VpnCloud need to be started on both nodes (the address after *-c* is the\naddress of the remote node and the the *X* in the interface address must be\nunique among all nodes, e.g. 0, 1, 2, ...):\n\n----\nvpncloud -c REMOTE_HOST:PORT --ip 10.0.0.X/24 --password PASSWORD\n----\n\nAfterwards, the interface can be used to communicate.\n\n=== Routed TUN example\n\nIn this example, 2 nodes and their subnets should communicate using IP.\nFirst, VpnCloud need to be started on both nodes:\n\n----\nvpncloud -t tun -c REMOTE_HOST:PORT --ip 10.0.X.1 --claim 10.0.X.0/24 --password PASSWORD\n----\n\nIt is important to configure the interface in a way that all addresses on the\nVPN can be reached directly. E.g. if subnets 10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24 and so on\nare used, the interface needs to be configured as 10.0.1.1/16.\nFor TUN devices, this means that the prefix length of the subnets\n(/24 in this example) must be different than the prefix length that the\ninterface is configured with (/16 in this example).\n\n=== Important notes\n\n. VpnCloud can be used to connect two separate networks. TAP networks can be\nbridged using *brctl* and TUN networks must be routed. It is very important\nto be careful when setting up such a scenario in order to avoid network loops,\nsecurity issues, DHCP issues and many more problems.\n. TAP devices will forward DHCP data. If done intentionally, this can be used\nto assign unique addresses to all participants. If this happens accidentally,\nit can conflict with DHCP servers of the local network and can have severe\nside effects.\n\n\n== CONFIG FILES\n\nThe config file is a YAML file that contains configuration values.

Each node has a key pair consisting of a \nprivate and a public key (*--private-key* and *--public-key*). Those key pairs\ncan be generated via *genkey*. \nTo allow connections, nodes need to list the public keys of all other nodes as \ntrusted keys (*--trusted-key*). To simplify the key exchange, key pairs can be\nderived from passwords (*--password*). If no trusted keys are configured, nodes\nwill only trust their own public key. Nodes configured with the same password\nwill therefore trust each others.\n\nIn the initialization phase of the connection, nodes agree on a temporary key \nthat is used to encrypt the next messages using a fast encryption algorithm.\nVpnCloud automatically benchmarks all supported algorithms and negotiates to \nuse the fastest algorithm for each connection. Users can limit the supported\nalgorithms if they wish using *--algorithm*. Although highly discouraged, users\ncan opt out of encryption altogether by enabling the *plain* algorithm. (Note:\nboth nodes in a connection must support this, otherwise encryption will take \nplace.)\n\nThe temporary encryption keys are rotated periodically so they are never used \nfor a longer time.\n\nPlease refer to the security whitepaper for more details.\n\n=== CVE-2019-14899\n\nThe Linux kernel contains a vulnerability that affects all VPNs disregarding of\nthe specific technology being used. Under some circumstances, the kernel accepts\npackets for the address range configured on the vpn interface also on other \ninterfaces. This way, an attacker can test the presence of a VPN and find out \nthe IPs being used. Also the attacker can with some effort inject data and \nmanipulate connections that should be protected by the VPN.\nTo mitigate this, the rp_filter setting should be configured to strict mode, \nwhich unfortunately a lot of distributions do not set as default.\nVpnCloud will detect this misconfiguration and offers to fix it via \n*--fix-rp-filter*.\nNote: This vulnerability affects all VPN technologies as it is not located in\nthe VPN software but in the Linux kernel.\n\n\n== BEACONS\n\nBeacons are short character sequences that contain a timestamp and a list of\naddresses. They can be published and retrieved by other nodes to find peers\nwithout the need for static addresses.\n\nThe beacons are short (less than 100 characters), encrypted and encoded with\nprintable characters to allow publishing them in various places on the\ninternet, e.g.:\n\n* On shared drives or synchronized folders (e.g. on Dropbox)\n* Via a dedicated database\n* Via a general purpose message board of message service (e.g. Twitter)\n\nThe beacons are very robust. They only consist of alphanumeric characters\nand can be interleaved with non-alphanumeric characters (e.g. whitespace).\nAlso the beacons contain a prefix and suffix that depends on the configured\nnetwork magic and secret key (if set) so that all nodes can find beacons in\na long text.\n\nWhen beacons are stored or loaded via a command (using the pipe character *|*),\nthe command is interpreted using the configured shell *sh*. This command has\naccess to the following environment variables:\n\n*$begin*:: The prefix of the beacon.\n*$end*:: The suffix of the beacon.\n*$data* (only on store):: The middle part of the beacon. Do not use this\nwithout prefix and suffix!\n*$beacon* (only on store):: The full beacon consisting of prefix, data and\nsuffix.\nThe commands are called in separate threads, so even longer running commands\nwill not block the node.\n\n\n== STATSD SUPPORT\n\nWhen a statsd server is configured (either via **--statsd-server** or the \nconfig option **statsd_server**), VpnCloud sends out the following statistics\nevery minute.\n\nGauge values:\n*peer_count*:: Current number of peers\n*table_entries*:: Number of routing table / switch table entries\n\nThe following statistics consist of two keys: *.bytes* and *.packets* that hold\nthe values in bytes and packets. All values refer to the traffic during the \nlast minute:\n*traffic.protocol.inbound*:: Complete incoming traffic with all peers\n*traffic.protocol.outbound*:: Complete outgoing traffic with all peers\n*traffic.payload.inbound*:: Incoming payload traffic with all peers\n*traffic.payload.outbound*:: Outgoing payload traffic with all peers\n*invalid_protocol_traffic*:: Invalid incoming protocol traffic\n*dropped_payload*:: Outgoing traffic that could not be routed\n\nAll keys are prefixed by a common prefix. The prefix defaults to *vpncloud* but\ncan be changed via **--statsd-prefix** or the config option **statsd_prefix**.\n\n\n== WEBSOCKET PROXY\n\nThe websocket proxy mode replaces the local UDP port by a websocket proxy to allow\nconnectivity even in very restricted environments.\n\nThis means that instead of listening on a local port for incoming messages and\nsending outgoing messages via this port, all UDP traffic will be forwarded to and\nreceived from a remote proxy via the websocket protocol. This proxy opens a UDP \nport for each VpnCloud instance that connects to it. The instance can use this port\nremotely just like it would use a real local UDP port.\n\nThe proxy is transparent, it does not manipulate or even decrypt the messages it \nforwards. Trust relations are still created between VpnCloud instances, not between\nan instance and the proxy. The proxy only ever sees encrypted messages. Therefore,\nthe connection to it uses plain HTTP.\n\nA websocket proxy can be stared by using the *ws-proxy* subcommand. A custom port \ncan be set using the *--listen* parameter. (Note that this port never conflicts \nwith a VpnCloud port on the same machine since VpnCloud uses UDP and the proxy uses\nTCP.)\n\nA VpnCloud instance can use a websocket proxy instead of opening a local port by \nspecifying the websocket proxy via its *--listen* parameter \n(e.g. *--listen ws://example.com:3210*). Note that the websocket URL must start with\n*ws:\\/\\/*, not *http:\\/\\/*.\n\n\n== HOOK SCRIPTS\n\nVpnCloud supports calling hook scripts on certain events. The scripts can either be\nconfigured on the command line or in the config file. Hook scripts can either be\nconfigured per event type or globally.\n\nWhen an event occurs, the specified hook script is executed using \nthe current permissions of the user that started the instance. Note that this means \nthat if VpnCloud is configured to drop permissions, only the events *device_setup* \nand *device_configured* will be executed using root permissions.\n\nHook scripts are executed using *sh -c*, so either binaries, shell scripts and even \nshell commands can be used. The script will be executed in parallel to the VpnCloud \ninstance. Its output will be printed to the stdout of VpnCloud and the return code \nis ignored.\n\nThe hook script will receive information on the event using environment variables.\nThe variable *EVENT* will contain the name of the event. Other variables depend on \nthe event type.\n\nThe following event types\n\n  *peer_connecting*::\n    A new peer connection is in the process of being established. The variable \n    *PEER* contains the address of the peer but no other information is known at \n    that point in time.\n    Variables: *IFNAME*, *PEER*\n\n  *peer_connected*::\n    A new peer successfully connected to this instance. Besides the peer address,\n    also a list of claims (*CLAIMS*, space separated) and the node id of the new \n    peer (*NODE_ID*) are given to the script.\n    Variables: *IFNAME*, *PEER*, *CLAIMS*, *NODE_ID*\n\n  *peer_disconnected*::\n    A peer connection has been closed. If the peer has been fully connected, the\n    node id is given (*NODE_ID*).\n    Variables: *IFNAME*, *PEER*, (*NODE_ID*)\n\n  *device_setup*::\n    This event is fired when the virtual device has been created but not yet\n    configured.\n    Variables: *IFNAME*\n\n  *device_configured*::\n    This event is fired when the virtual device is fully configured.\n    Variables: *IFNAME*\n\n  *vpn_started*::\n    This event is fired when the VPN is ready to be used.\n    Variables: *IFNAME*\n\n  *vpn_shutdown*::\n    This event is fired when the VPN s shutting down.\n    Variables: *IFNAME*\n\n\n== DEVICE SETUP\n\nThe device is setup using the following steps:\n\n. The device is created with the type and name given as *--type* and *--device*.\n. Depending on the device type and the main network device of the systme, the \n  optimal MTU is determined and configured on the device.\n. If and IP address (and optional prefix length) is given via *--ip*, the \n  interface is configured with the address and the given netmask (default: \n  255.255.255.0). Also the interface is set to be active.\n. If a command is given as *--ifup*, the given command will be executed. The \n  name of the interface is stored in an environment variable as \"IFNAME\". Note \n  that VpnCloud waits for the command to exit before starting its normal \n  operation.\n\nNote that most of the steps will need elevated permissions, so the vpncloud \ncommand needs to be executed as root (e.g. via sudo). Beware that the ifup \ncommand will also be executed using those permissions.\n\nVpnCloud can drop the elevated permissions when *--user* and *--group* is \ngiven.\n\n\n== COPYRIGHT\n\nCopyright (C) 2015-2021  Dennis Schwerdel\nThis software is licensed under GPL-3 or newer (see LICENSE.md)\n"
