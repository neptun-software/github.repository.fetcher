          "content": "# The GeoRust Code of Conduct\n\nThis document is based on, and aims to track the [Rust Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/conduct.html)\n\n## Conduct\n\n**Contact**: [mods@georust.org](mailto:mods@georust.org)\n\n* We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other similar characteristic.\n* On IRC, please avoid using overtly sexual nicknames or other nicknames that might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.\n* Please be kind and courteous. There's no need to be mean or rude.\n* Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a right answer.\n* Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.\n* We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone. That is not welcome behavior. We interpret the term \"harassment\" as including the definition in the <a href=\"http://citizencodeofconduct.org/\">Citizen Code of Conduct</a>; if you have any lack of clarity about what might be included in that concept, please read their definition. In particular, we don't tolerate behavior that excludes people in socially marginalized groups.\n* Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if you feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community member, please contact one of the channel ops or any of the [GeoRust moderation team][mod_team] immediately. Whether you're a regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about making this community a safe place for you, and we've got your back.\n* Likewise, any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome.\n\n## Moderation\n\n\nThese are the policies for upholding our community's standards of conduct. If you feel that a thread needs moderation, please contact the [GeoRust moderation team][mod_team].\n\n1. Remarks that violate the Rust standards of conduct, including hateful, hurtful, oppressive, or exclusionary remarks, are not allowed. (Cursing is allowed, but never targeting another user, and never in a hateful manner.)\n2. Remarks that moderators find inappropriate, whether listed in the code of conduct or not, are also not allowed.\n3. Moderators will first respond to such remarks with a warning.\n4. If the warning is unheeded, the user will be \"kicked,\" i.e., kicked out of the communication channel to cool off.\n5. If the user comes back and continues to make trouble, they will be banned, i.e., indefinitely excluded.\n6. Moderators may choose at their discretion to un-ban the user if it was a first offense, and they offer the offended party a genuine apology.\n7. If a moderator bans someone, and you think it was unjustified, please take it up with that moderator, or with a different moderator, **in private**. Complaints about bans in-channel are not allowed.\n8. Moderators are held to a higher standard than other community members. If a moderator creates an inappropriate situation, they should expect less leeway than others.\n\nIn the GeoRust community we strive to go the extra step to look out for each other. Don't just aim to be technically unimpeachable, try to be your best self. In particular, avoid flirting with offensive or sensitive issues, particularly if they're off-topic; this all too often leads to unnecessary fights, hurt feelings, and damaged trust; worse, it can drive people away from the community entirely.\n\nAnd if someone takes issue with something you said or did, resist the urge to be defensive. Just stop doing what it was they complained about and apologize. Even if you feel you were misinterpreted or unfairly accused, chances are good there was something you could've communicated better — remember that it's your responsibility to make your fellow Rustaceans comfortable. Everyone wants to get along, and we are all here first and foremost because we want to talk about cool technology. You will find that people will be eager to assume good intent and forgive as long as you earn their trust.\n\n*Adapted from the [Node.js Policy on Trolling](http://blog.izs.me/post/30036893703/policy-on-trolling) as well as the [Contributor Covenant v1.3.0](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/3/0/).*\n\n[mod_team]: mailto:mods@georust.org\n"

          "content": "# Contributing to `geo`\n[contributing-to-geo]: #contributing-to-geo\n\nThank you for your interest in contributing to `geo`! There\nare many ways to contribute, and we appreciate all of them.\nThis document is a bit long, so here's links to the major\nsections:\n\n* [Feature Requests](#feature-requests)\n* [Bug Reports](#bug-reports)\n* [Pull Requests](#pull-requests)\n* [Writing Tests and Documentation](#writing-tests-and-documentation)\n\nAs a reminder, all contributors are expected to follow our [Code of Conduct][coc].\n\n[coc]: https://github.com/georust/geo/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\n\n## Feature Requests\n[feature-requests]: #feature-requests\n\n`geo` aims to provide a broad suite of functionality. If\nyou're in any doubt whether a feature can be included,\nsimply open an issue and ask. It's a good idea to check open\nissues and pull requests first, in order to check whether a\nrequested feature is already in progress.\n\n## Bug Reports\n[bug-reports]: #bug-reports\n\nWhile bugs are unfortunate, they're a reality in software.\nWe can't fix what we don't know about, so please report\nliberally. If you're not sure whether something is a bug or\nnot, feel free to file a bug anyway.\n\nIf you have the chance, before reporting a bug, please [search existing\nissues](https://github.com/georust/geo/search?q=&type=Issues&utf8=✓),\nas it's possible that someone else has already reported your error. This doesn't\nalways work, and sometimes it's hard to know what to search for, so consider this\nextra credit. We won't mind if you accidentally file a duplicate report.\n\nSimilarly, to help others who encountered the bug find your\nissue, consider filing an issue with a descriptive\ntitle, which contains information that might be unique to\nit. This can be the language or compiler feature used, the\nconditions that trigger the bug, or part of the error\nmessage if there is any.\n\nOpening an issue is as easy as following [this\nlink](https://github.com/georust/geo/issues/new) and filling out the fields.\nHere's a template that you can use to file a bug, though it's not necessary to\nuse it exactly:\n\n    <short summary of the bug>\n\n    I tried this code:\n\n    <code sample that causes the bug>\n\n    I expected to see this happen: <explanation>\n\n    Instead, this happened: <explanation>\n\n    ## Meta\n\n    `rustc --version --verbose`:\n\n    Backtrace:\n\nAll three components are important: what you did, what you expected, what\nhappened instead. Please include the output of `rustc --version --verbose`,\nwhich includes important information about what platform you're on, what\nversion of Rust you're using, etc.\n\nSometimes, a backtrace is helpful, and so including that is nice. To get\na backtrace, set the `RUST_BACKTRACE` environment variable to a value\nother than `0`. The easiest way\nto do this is to invoke `rustc` like this:\n\n```bash\n$ RUST_BACKTRACE=1 rustc ...\n```\n\n## Pull Requests\n[pull-requests]: #pull-requests\n\nPull requests are the primary mechanism we use to change\nGeo. GitHub itself has some [great\ndocumentation][about-pull-requests] on using the Pull\nRequest feature. We use the \"fork and pull\" model [described\nhere][development-models], where contributors push changes\nto their personal fork and create pull requests to bring\nthose changes into the source repository.\n\n[about-pull-requests]: https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/\n[development-models]: https://help.github.com/articles/about-collaborative-development-models/\n\nPlease make pull requests against the `main` branch.\n\nAll pull requests are reviewed by another person.\n\nAfter someone has reviewed your pull request, they will\nleave an annotation on the pull request with an `r+`. It\nwill look something like this:\n\n    bors: r+\n\nThis tells @bors, our lovable integration bot, that your\npull request has been approved. The PR then enters the merge\nqueue, where @bors will run all the tests on every platform\nwe support. If it all works out, @bors will merge your code\ninto `main` and close the pull request.\n\n## Writing Tests and Documentation\n\nDocumentation improvements are very welcome. Standard API\ndocumentation is generated from the source code itself. If\nyou're adding a new feature, you **must** document its use,\nand write tests, preferably covering 100% of the added\nfunctionality. [Several\ngeometries](geo-test-fixtures) are provided as\ntest fixtures. If you need help with the format or content\nof docs, or help writing some tests, don't hesitate to ask.\n\n## Publishing to crates.io\n\nThe repo contains three crates: `geo-types`, `geo`,\n`geo-postgis`, and the latter two depends on the former. A\ntypical release involves publishing one of these, but major\nreleases may involve all three.  If publishing more than one,\n\n### Publishing a sub-crate\n\n1. Ensure `CHANGES.md` lists the PRs, or features added in\n   the version to be released.\n\n1. Update `Cargo.toml` to reflect the new version. Note\n   that, a breaking change should be released with a change\n   in the major version number.\n\n1. If there is a dependency on the other sub-crates (e.g.\n   `geo` depends on `geo-types`), ensure the major version\n   matches the latest release, and the minor the minimum\n   version needed to compile.\n\n1. Commit the changes and run `cargo publish` in the\n   appropriate directory.\n\nAfter releasing the crates, push the changes, and tag as\n`{crate-name}-{version}`.\n"
