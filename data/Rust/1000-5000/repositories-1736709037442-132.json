I would love to use this already.\"** --\n[Armin Ronacher][mitsuhiko], creator of Jinja\n\nAll feedback welcome. Feel free to file bugs, requests for documentation and\nany other feedback to the [issue tracker][issues] or [tweet me][twitter].\n\nAskama was created by and is maintained by Dirkjan Ochtman. If you are in a\nposition to support ongoing maintenance and further development or use it\nin a for-profit context, please consider supporting my open source work on\n[Patreon][patreon].\n\n### Feature highlights\n\n* Construct templates using a familiar, easy-to-use syntax\n* Benefit from the safety provided by Rust's type system\n* Template code is compiled into your crate for [optimal performance][benchmarks]\n* Optional built-in support for Actix, Axum, Rocket, and warp web frameworks\n* Debugging features to assist you in template development\n* Templates must be valid UTF-8 and produce UTF-8 when rendered\n* IDE support available in [JetBrains products](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/16591-askama-template-support)\n* Works on stable Rust\n\n### Supported in templates\n\n* Template inheritance\n* Loops, if/else statements and include support\n* Macro support\n* Variables (no mutability allowed)\n* Some built-in filters, and the ability to use your own\n* Whitespace suppressing with '-' markers\n* Opt-out HTML escaping\n* Syntax customization\n\n[docs]: https://djc.github.io/askama/\n[fafhrd91]: https://github.com/fafhrd91\n[mitsuhiko]: http://lucumr.pocoo.org/\n[issues]: https://github.com/djc/askama/issues\n[twitter]: https://twitter.com/djco/\n[patreon]: https://www.patreon.com/dochtman\n[benchmarks]: https://github.com/djc/template-benchmarks-rs\n\n\nHow to get started\n------------------\n\nFirst, add the Askama dependency to your crate's `Cargo.toml`:\n\n```sh\ncargo add askama\n```\n\nNow create a directory called `templates` in your crate root.\nIn it, create a file called `hello.html`, containing the following:\n\n```\nHello, {{ name }}!\n```\n\nIn any Rust file inside your crate, add the following:\n\n```rust\nuse askama::Template; // bring trait in scope\n\n#[derive(Template)] // this will generate the code...\n#[template(path = \"hello.html\")] // using the template in this path, relative\n                                 // to the `templates` dir in the crate root\nstruct HelloTemplate<'a> { // the name of the struct can be anything\n    name: &'a str, // the field name should match the variable name\n                   // in your template\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let hello = HelloTemplate { name: \"world\" }; // instantiate your struct\n    println!(\"{}\", hello.render().unwrap()); // then render it.\n}\n```\n\nYou should now be able to compile and run this code.\n\nReview the [test cases] for more examples.\n\n[test cases]: https://github.com/djc/askama/tree/main/testing\n"
