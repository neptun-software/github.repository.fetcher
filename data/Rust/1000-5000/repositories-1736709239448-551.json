The design space is large, and there is a lot of prior art to\nconsider. When coming to consensus on a design, we use a simplified, informal\nversion of [our RFC process][rfcs].\n\nWhen making a proposal, you must create a new pull request on this repo.\nThe pull request's title must start with `[RFC]`.\n\nThe pull request must add a new file into the `rfcs` folder. This file\ncontains all the information for the proposal.\n\nIt is expected that other people will write reviews pointing out various\nflaws, which should be fixed by adding new commits to the pull request.\n\n> Note: when fixing a bug in a semver-compatible way that doesn't add any new\n> API surface (i.e. changes are purely internal) we can skip the design proposal\n> part of this workflow, and jump straight to a pull request.\n\nThe graph below gives an overview of the workflow for proposing, designing,\nimplementing, and merging new crates and APIs into Gloo. Notably, we expect a\nlarge amount of design discussion to happen up front in the issue thread for the\ndesign proposal.\n\n[![Graph showing the workflow of proposing, designing, and merging new crates and\nAPIs into Gloo](./new-design-workflow.png)](./new-design-workflow.png)\n\n[rfcs]: https://github.com/rustwasm/rfcs\n\n### Proposing a Design\n\nBefore writing pull requests, we should have a clear idea of what is required\nfor implementation. This means there should be a skeleton of the API in the form\nof types and function/method signatures. We should have a clear idea of the\nlayers of APIs we are exposing, and how they are built upon one another.\n\nNote that exploratory implementations outside of Gloo are encouraged during this\nperiod to get a sense for the API's usage, but you shouldn't send an implementation\npull request until the design has been accepted.\n\nBefore the design is accepted, at least two team members must have stated that\nthey are in favor of accepting the design in the issue thread.\n\n[Here is an issue template you can use for proposing\ndesigns.](https://github.com/rustwasm/gloo/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=propose_design.md&title=)\n\n#### Design Checklist\n\nHere is a checklist of some general design principles that Gloo crates and APIs\nshould follow:\n\n* [ ] Crate's public interface follows the [Rust API Guidelines][api-guidelines].\n\n* [ ] Callback-taking APIs are generic over `F: Fn(A) -> B` (or `FnMut` or\n  `FnOnce`) instead of taking `wasm_bindgen::Closure`s or\n  `js_sys::Function`s directly.\n\n* [ ] If the API can be implemented as a Future / Stream, then it should first\n  be implemented as a callback, with the callback API put into the `callback`\n  submodule.\n\n  Then the Future / Stream should be implemented using the callback API, and\n  should be put into the `future` or `stream` submodule.\n\n  Make sure that the callback and Future / Stream APIs properly support\n  cancellation (if it is possible to do so).\n\n* [ ] Uses nice Rust-y types and interfaces instead of passing around untyped\n  `JsValue`s.\n\n* [ ] Has `fn as_raw(&self) -> &web_sys::Whatever` functions to get the\n  underlying raw `web_sys`, `js_sys`, or `JsValue` type. This provides an escape\n  hatch for dropping down to raw `web_sys` bindings when an API isn't fully\n  supported by the crate yet.\n\n  Similar for `from_raw` constructors and `into_raw` conversion methods when\n  applicable.\n\n* [ ] There is a loose hierarchy with \"mid-level\" APIs (which are essentially\n  thin wrappers over the low-level APIs), and \"high-level\" APIs (which make more\n  substantial changes).\n\n  As a general rule, the high-level APIs should be built on top of the mid-level\n  APIs, which in turn should be built on top of the low-level APIs\n  (e.g. `web_sys`)\n\n  There are exceptions to this, but they have to be carefully decided on a\n  case-by-case basis.\n\n### Implementation and Feedback Cycle\n\nOnce we've accepted a design, we can move forward with implementation and\ncreating pull requests.\n\nThe implementation should generally be unsurprising, since we should have\nalready worked out most of the kinks during the earlier design discussions. If\nthere are significant new issues or concerns uncovered during implementation,\nthen these should be brought up in the design proposal discussion thread again,\nand the evolved design reaffirmed with two team members signing off once\nagain.\n\nIf there are no new concerns uncovered, then the implementation just needs to be\nchecked over by at least one team member. They provide code review and feedback\non the implementation, then the feedback is addressed and pull request updated.\nOnce the pull request is in a good place and CI is passing, a team member may\napprove the pull request and merge it into Gloo. If any team member raises\nconcerns with the implementation, they must be resolved before the pull request\nis merged.\n\n#### Implementation Checklist\n\nHere is a checklist that all crate and API implementations in Gloo should\nfulfill:\n\n* [ ] The crate should be named `gloo-foobar`, located at `gloo/crates/foobar`,\n  and re-exported from the umbrella Gloo crate like:\n\n  ```rust\n  // gloo/src/lib.rs\n\n  pub use gloo_foobar as foobar;\n  ```\n\n* [ ] The `authors` entry in `gloo/crates/foobar/Cargo.toml` is \"The Rust and\n  WebAssembly Working Group\".\n\n* [ ] Uses [`unwrap_throw` and `expect_throw`][unwrap-throw] instead of normal\n  `unwrap` and `expect`.\n\n* [ ] Headless browser and/or Node.js tests via `wasm-pack test`.\n\n* [ ] Uses `#![deny(missing_docs, missing_debug_implementations)]`.\n\n* [ ] Crate's root module documentation has at least one realistic example.\n\n* [ ] Crate has at least a brief description of how to use it in the Gloo guide\n  (the `mdbook` located at `gloo/guide`).\n\n[unwrap-throw]: https://docs.rs/wasm-bindgen/0.2.37/wasm_bindgen/trait.UnwrapThrowExt.html\n[api-guidelines]: https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/api-guidelines/\n\n## Team Members\n\nTeam members sign off on design proposals and review pull requests to Gloo.\n\n* `@jstarry`\n* `@hamza1311`\n\nIf you make a handful of significant contributions to Gloo and participate in\ndesign proposals, then maybe you should be a team member! Think you or someone\nelse would be a good fit? Reach out to us!\n\n## Publishing Releases and Versioning\n\n### Versioning\n\nWhenever we bump a `gloo_whatever` utility crate's version, make sure to make a\ncorresponding version bump for every crate that transitively depends upon\n`gloo_whatever`. Crates that do not transitively depend on `gloo_whatever`\nshould not have their version bumped.\n\nFor example, if we start with this dependency graph:\n\n```\n- gloo @ 0.1.2\n  - gloo_foo @ 0.1.2\n  - gloo_bar @ 0.1.3\n  - gloo_qux @ 0.1.4\n    - gloo_bar @ 0.1.3\n```\n\nIf we make a bug fix in `gloo_bar` and bump its version from 0.1.3 to 0.1.4,\nthen the cascading version bumps should result in this final dependency graph:\n\n```\n- gloo @ 0.1.3           # `gloo` has deps updated, version bumped\n  - gloo_foo @ 0.1.2     # `gloo_foo` remains at 0.1.2 since no deps changed\n  - gloo_bar @ 0.1.4     # `gloo_bar` had bug fix -> bumped to 0.1.4\n  - gloo_qux @ 0.1.5     # `gloo_qux` has its dep on `gloo_bar` updated, version bumped\n    - gloo_bar @ 0.1.4\n```\n\nHistorically, this versioning scheme was agreed upon in [issue #66][].\n\n[issue #66]: https://github.com/rustwasm/gloo/issues/66\n\n### Publishing Checklist\n\nHere is a checklist for publishing new releases to crates.io:\n\n* [ ] Bump all the relevant crates' versions, as described above.\n\n* [ ] Write a `CHANGELOG.md` entry for the release.\n\n* [ ] Commit the changes and send a pull request for the release.\n\n* [ ] Once a team member has approved the pull request, and continuous\n      integration is green, merge the PR.\n\n* [ ] `cargo publish` each crate that had its version bumped.\n\n* [ ] Create a tag `X.Y.Z` for the umbrella `gloo` crate's version, and push\n      this tag to GitHub.\n"

This is why it is called a \"toolkit\", instead of \"library\"\nor \"framework\".\n\n### Background\n\nIn [the Rust and WebAssembly working group's 2019 roadmap][roadmap], we chose to\ndeliberately cultivate our library ecosystem by building a modular toolkit:\n\n> ## Collaborating on a Modular Toolkit\n>\n> > The idea of building [high-level libraries] in a modular way that will allow\n> > others in the community to put the components together in a different way is\n> > very exciting to me. This hopefully will make the ecosystem as a whole much\n> > stronger.\n> >\n> > In particular I’d love to see a modular effort towards implementing a virtual\n> > DOM library with JSX like syntax.

In 2019, we should build modular, high-level\n> libraries on top of them, and collect the libraries under an umbrella toolkit\n> crate for a holistic experience.

Grab that one targeted library you need out from\n> the toolkit and use it by itself.\n\nGloo is this modular toolkit.\n\n[announcing-web-sys]: https://rustwasm.github.io/2018/09/26/announcing-web-sys.html\n[roadmap]: https://github.com/rustwasm/rfcs/pull/7\n\n## Goals\n\n* **Support both whole Web applications and small, targeted libraries:** Gloo,\n  and the collection of utility crates that make up its toolkit, should help you\n  be productive if you are writing a green-field web application with Rust and\n  Wasm. And it should also help you be productive if you are writing a small,\n  targeted Wasm library that will be integrated into an existing JavaScript\n  application.\n\n* **Cultivate the Rust and Wasm library ecosystem:** We want to use Gloo as a\n  forcing function for creating and sharing the building blocks of Web\n  development. The kinds of libraries that *any* framework or high-level library\n  would need to build. We want to explicitly disentangle these libraries and\n  make them available for sharing across the whole ecosystem.\n\n* **Modular Toolkit, not Framework:** Gloo should be a loose collection of\n  utility crates that can be used individually, or all together. Gloo doesn't\n  assume that it \"owns\" the whole Webpage, that it controls the Wasm `start`\n  function, etc. This lack of assumptions enables reaching more use cases (such\n  as surgically replacing a hot code path from JS) than monolithic frameworks\n  can. Wherever possible, Gloo should prefer interfaces over implementations, so\n  that different implementations with different approaches are swap-able.\n\n* **Fast:** Let's leverage Rust's zero-cost abstractions, and design with\n  performance in mind, to show everyone how fast the Web can be ;)\n\n* **Reliable:** Every crate should be thoroughly tested. Headless browser\n  tests. Quickcheck tests. Using the type system to make whole classes of bugs\n  impossible.\n\n* **Small:** Small code size for faster page loads. No accidentally pulling in\n  all of the panicking and formatting infrastructure. Users shouldn't have to\n  make a trade off between using Gloo libraries and having small Wasm binaries.\n\n* **Idiomatic:** We want to build Rust-y APIs, that feel natural to use. The\n  Web's APIs were not designed for the Rust language, and you can feel the\n  impedance mismatch every now and then. Let's correct that, bridge the gap, and\n  make libraries that are a joy to use.\n\n## Example\n\nThis example uses `gloo::events` for adding event listeners and `gloo::timers`\nfor creating timeouts. It creates a `<button>` element and adds a \"click\" event\nlistener to it. Whenever the button is clicked, it starts a one second timeout,\nwhich sets the button's text content to \"Hello from one second ago!\".\n\n```rust\nuse gloo::{events::EventListener, timers::callback::Timeout};\nuse wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;\n\npub struct DelayedHelloButton {\n    button: web_sys::Element,\n    on_click: events::EventListener,\n}\n\nimpl DelayedHelloButton {\n    pub fn new(document: &web_sys::Document) -> Result<DelayedHelloButton, JsValue> {\n        // Create a `<button>` element.\n        let button = document.create_element(\"button\")?;\n\n        // Listen to \"click\" events on the button.\n        let button2 = button.clone();\n        let on_click = EventListener::new(&button, \"click\", move |_event| {\n            // After a one second timeout, update the button's text content.\n            let button3 = button2.clone();\n            Timeout::new(1_000, move || {\n                button3.set_text_content(Some(\"Hello from one second ago!\"));\n            })\n            .forget();\n        });\n\n        Ok(DelayedHelloButton { button, on_click })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Get Involved!\n\nWant to help us build Gloo?
