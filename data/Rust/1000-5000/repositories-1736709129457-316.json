Apologies for any inconvenience caused.\n* Libs/Go: retracts several versions which were tagged prematurely. Apologies!\n\n## Version 1.45.1\n* CLI: Rename the binary back from `svix-cli` to `svix`\n* Libs/Java: Stop sharing one `ApiClient` between all `Svix` instances. Fixes a bug where multiple\n  independently instantiated `Svix` instances would always use the same base path and auth token.\n\n## Version 1.45.0\n* CLI **(New)**: New Rust-based CLI with support for all recent Svix functionality.\n* Libs/Rust **(Breaking)**: Add `api::MessageAttemptListAttemptedMessagesOptions` and use it for\n  `MessageAttempt::list_attempted_messages`, replacing `MessageAttemptListOptions` which contained\n  some extra parameters never used with this method / endpoint ([#1568])\n* Libs/JavaScript **(Breaking)**: Add more precise type annotations for `options` parameters on\n  `MessageAttempt.list`, `MessageAttempt.listByMsg`, `MessageAttempt.listAttemptedMessages` and\n  `MessageAttempt.listAttemptedDestinations` ([#1571])\n* Libs/JavaScript **(Breaking)**: Rename `EndpointStatsOptions` interface to\n  `EndpointGetStatsOptions` ([#1585])\n* Libs/Kotlin **(Breaking)**: Remove `ListOptions` class. Usage of classes that were inheriting\n  from it should not change though ([#1587])\n* Libs/Rust: Add `api::Authentication::expire_all` ([#1584])\n* Libs/Rust: Rename some `Options` types. The old names remain as deprecated type aliases ([#1584])\n* Server: Fix Dockerfile exposed port to be 8071 ([#1596])\n\n[#1568]: https://github.com/svix/svix-webhooks/pull/1568\n[#1571]: https://github.com/svix/svix-webhooks/pull/1571\n[#1584]: https://github.com/svix/svix-webhooks/pull/1584\n[#1585]: https://github.com/svix/svix-webhooks/pull/1585\n[#1587]: https://github.com/svix/svix-webhooks/pull/1587\n\n## Version 1.44.0\n* Libs/JavaScript: Revert packaging-related change because it broke for some users ([#1556])\n* Libs/Rust **(Breaking)**: Remove unused optional `PostOptions` parameters from non-POST methods ([#1557])\n\n[#1556]: https://github.com/svix/svix-webhooks/pull/1556\n[#1557]: https://github.com/svix/svix-webhooks/pull/1557\n\n## Version 1.43.0\n* Libs/Go: Add convenient construction of messages with pre-serialized payload ([#1538])\n* Libs/Go: Reduce the use of `NullableX` types to where they actually have a use ([#1543])\n* Libs/JavaScript: Add convenient construction of messages with pre-serialized payload ([#1539])\n* Libs/Java: Add convenient construction of messages with pre-serialized payload ([#1544])\n* Libs/C#: Bump .NET target to 8.0 ([#1546])\n* Libs/C#: Add convenient construction of messages with pre-serialized payload ([#1545])\n* Libs/Python: Add convenient construction of messages with pre-serialized payload ([#1540])\n* Libs/Ruby: Add convenient construction of messages with pre-serialized payload ([#1541])\n* Libs/JavaScript: Compile svix package for ESM and CommonJS, reducing bundle sizes ([#1549])\n\n[#1538]: https://github.com/svix/svix-webhooks/pull/1538\n[#1543]: https://github.com/svix/svix-webhooks/pull/1543\n[#1539]: https://github.com/svix/svix-webhooks/pull/1539\n[#1540]: https://github.com/svix/svix-webhooks/pull/1540\n[#1541]: https://github.com/svix/svix-webhooks/pull/1541\n[#1544]: https://github.com/svix/svix-webhooks/pull/1544\n[#1545]: https://github.com/svix/svix-webhooks/pull/1545\n[#1546]: https://github.com/svix/svix-webhooks/pull/1546\n[#1549]: https://github.com/svix/svix-webhooks/pull/1549\n\n## Version 1.42.0\n* Server: Return 413 on large payloads ([#1530])\n* Libs/Python: Fix sync / async mismatch for op-webhook-endpoint API ([#1535])\n* Libs/Rust: Fix types of `iterator` fields ([#1534])\n* Libs/Kotlin: Add convenient construction of messages with pre-serialized payload ([#1531])\n* Libs/Rust: Add convenient construction of messages with pre-serialized payload ([#1533])\n\n[#1530]: https://github.com/svix/svix-webhooks/pull/1530\n[#1531]: https://github.com/svix/svix-webhooks/pull/1531\n[#1533]: https://github.com/svix/svix-webhooks/pull/1533\n[#1534]: https://github.com/svix/svix-webhooks/pull/1534\n[#1535]: https://github.com/svix/svix-webhooks/pull/1535\n\n## Version 1.41.0\n* Libs/JS: Allow `iterator` and date parameters on list endpoints to be `null` (in addition to `undefined`)\n* Libs/JS: Fix serialization of message `status` query parameters\n* Libs/Rust: Revert many pointless type changes from `Option<T>` to `Option<Option<T>>` that came with 1.39.0\n* Server: Improve error messages for configuration loading\n\n## Version 1.40.0\n* Libs(JS): downgrade `@stablelib/base64` avoiding `ERR_REQUIRE_ESM` by @svix-onelson in https://github.com/svix/svix-webhooks/pull/1506\n* Bridge: update ca-certificates by @jaymell in https://github.com/svix/svix-webhooks/pull/1507\n* Server: exit early if endpoints don't exist by @jaymell in https://github.com/svix/svix-webhooks/pull/1515\n\n## Version 1.39.0\n* Libs: Add operational webhook endpoint API\n* Libs/Rust: **[Breaking]** Models for PATCH endpoints now have `Option<Option<T>>` fields to allow explicitly sending nulls to unset those fields.\n* Libs/Go: **[Breaking]** Nullable arrays are once again represented by `[]T` instead of `*[]T`.

This can be used to interface with many services such as DataDog or Sentry.\n\nTo set this up you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Set up an account with any service which supports receiving logs from the [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/). Note some services (such as DataDog) require use of specific forks of the OpenTelemetry Collector which include \"exporters\" for their services. The most popular is the [opentelemetry-collector-contrib](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib).\n2. Install, configure, and (re)start the OpenTelemetry Collector, noting the gRPC address it is configured to bind to. Ensure that your external service has been integrated properly by consulting their documentation for OpenTelemetry Collector exporters.\n3. Configure the Svix server including the `opentelemetry_address` field to point towards the gRPC address configured above.\n4. Optionally configure the `opentelemetry_sample_ratio` in the Svix server configuration. If not set, all traces will be sent to the external service.\n5. Ensure the OpenTelemetry Collector is running, start the Svix server, and watch the tracing information be received.\n"

Docker is probably the most common one, but you can choose the one that works best for you.\n\nThe Svix server is written in Rust 🦀, which means you can compile it into a static library for a variety of targets. Please refer to the building from source section below for more information.\n\nPlease refer to the [server configuration](#server-configuration) section below for more information regarding the available settings.\n\n## Deployment\n\n### Docker\n\nYou can use the official Svix Docker image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/svix/svix-server). You can either use the `latest` tag, or one of [the versioned tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/svix/svix-server/tags) instead.\n\nYou can either use the example [docker-compose.yml](./server/docker-compose.yml) file with `docker compose` (easiest), `docker swarm` (advanced), or run the container standalone.\n\n#### With Docker Compose\n\nThis alternative is the easiest because it will also boot up and configure `redis` and `postgresql`.\n\nThis assumes you have Docker Compose v2 installed.\n\n```\ncd server\ndocker compose up\n```\n\n#### Standalone container\n\nRunning a standalone container is slightly more advanced, as it requires you to set some environment variables and have them pointing to your `redis` and `postgres` instances.\nYou can pass individual environment variables to docker using the `-e` flag, or just create a file like [development.env](./server/svix-server/development.env) and use the `--env-file` flag like in the example below:\n\n```\ndocker run \\\n  --name svix-server \\\n  -p 8071:8071 \\\n  --env-file development.env \\\n  svix/svix-server\n```\n\n### Pre-compiled binaries\n\nPre-compiled binaries are available for released versions in the [releases section](https://github.com/svix/svix-webhooks/releases).\n\n### Building from source\n\nThe Svix server is written in Rust 🦀 and requires a Rust build environment.\n\nIf you already have one, you just need to run `cargo build`, otherwise, please please refer to the [Svix server README](./server/#readme) for more information about building the server from source.\n\n## Runtime dependencies\n\nThe server requires the following runtime dependencies to work correctly:\n\n- A PostgreSQL server - for the storage of events.\n- An *optional* Redis server version 6.2.0 or higher - for the task queue and cache.\n\n## Redis/Valkey Considerations\n### Persistence\nPlease note that it's recommended to enable persistence in Redis so that tasks are persisted across Redis server restarts and upgrades.\n\n### Eviction Policy\nPlease ensure that your Redis instances are configured to not evict keys without explicit `expire` policies set. This means that `maxmemory-policy` should be set to `noeviction` or to any of the available `volatile-` policies. See Redis/Valkey documentation for further information.\n\n## Server configuration\n\nThere are three ways to configure `svix-server`: environment vars, `.env` file, and a configuration file.\n\n### Configuration file\n\nYou can put a file called `config.toml` in the current working directory of `svix-server` and it will automatically pick it up.\nYou can take a look at the example file for more information and a full list of supported settings: [config.toml](./server/svix-server/config.default.toml).\n\nHere's a quick example of the most important configurations:\n\n```toml\n# The JWT secret for authentication - should be secret and securely generated\njwt_secret = \"8KjzRXrKkd9YFcNyqLSIY8JwiaCeRc6WK4UkMnSW\"\n\n# The DSN for the database. Only postgres is currently supported.\ndb_dsn = \"postgresql://postgres:postgres@pgbouncer/postgres\"\n\n# The DSN for redis (can be left empty if not using redis)\nredis_dsn = \"redis://redis:6379\"\n\n# What kind of message queue to use.\nqueue_type = \"redis\"\n```\n\n\n### Environment (variables or `.env`)\n\nAlternatively, you can configure `svix-server` by setting the equivalent environment variables for each of the supported settings. The environment variables can either be passed directly or by setting them in a `.env` file.\n\nThe environment variables have the name name as the config names, but they are all upper case and are prefixed with `SVIX_`.\n\nFor example, the above example configuration would look like this if it was passed in the env:\n\n```\n# The JWT secret for authentication - should be secret and securely generated\nSVIX_JWT_SECRET = \"8KjzRXrKkd9YFcNyqLSIY8JwiaCeRc6WK4UkMnSW\"\n\n# The DSN for the database. Only postgres is currently supported.\nSVIX_DB_DSN = \"postgresql://postgres:postgres@pgbouncer/postgres\"\n\n# The DSN for redis (can be left empty if not using redis)\nSVIX_REDIS_DSN = \"redis://redis:6379\"\n\n# What kind of message queue to use.\nSVIX_QUEUE_TYPE = \"redis\"\n```\n\n### OpenTelemetry\n\nYou may send tracing information to the OpenTelemetry Collector which allows forwarding trace events to a number of external applications/services such as DataDog, Jaeger, NewRelic, Prometheus, Sentry, Signoz, and Zipkin.\n\nYou can see more in [these instructions](./OpenTelemetry.md).\n\n### Connection Pool Size\n\nThe `db_pool_max_size` configuration parameter controls the maximum allowed size of the connection pool for PostgreSQL. This value defaults to a max size of 100, but you can potentially increase application performance significantly by increasing this value. You may need to consider Postgres and PGBouncer configuration parameters as well when tuning these parameters.\n\nThe `redis_pool_max_size` parameter controls the maximum size of each Svix instance's Redis connection pool. Its default is 100. Note that only redis _queuing_ leverages connection pooling -- caching is fully asynchronous and so does not otherwise benefit from pooling. Therefore, you probably won't need to tune this parameter.\n\n### SSRF Attacks and Internal IP Addresses\nTo prevent SSRF attacks, message dispatches to internal IP addresses are blocked by default. However we understand that this doesn't meet the needs of every user say, for example, the service can only be accessed internally. To bypass these restrictions, see the `whitelist_subnets` configuration option, which accepts an array of CIDR-notation subnets to allow messages to be dispatched to.\n\n### Webhook signature scheme (symmetric vs asymmetric)\n\nTo ensure the security and integrity of messages, Svix signs all webhook messages prior to sending.\nSvix supports two types of signature schemes: symmetric (pre-shared key) and asymmetric (public key).\n\nSymmetric signatures are significantly faster (~50x for signing, and ~160x for verifying), and are much simpler (which makes verification easier for your customers), though they require the usage of a pre-shared key per endpoint (endpoint secret) in order to work. Asymmetric signatures on the other hand only require sharing a public key with your customers (not secret).\n\nBecause of the above, using symmetric keys is both recommended and the Svix default. Using them is documented in the [verifying signatures section of the docs](https://docs.svix.com/receiving/verifying-payloads/how-manual).\n\nHowever, in some scenarios it may be beneficial to use asymmetric signatures, which is why they too are supported. For more information please refer to the [asymmetric signatures section](#asymmetric-signatures) below.\n\n## Authentication\n\nUse valid JWTs generated with the correct secret as `Bearer`.\n\nE.g:\n```\nAuthorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN_HERE>\n```\n\nEither generate one using\n```\nsvix-server jwt generate\n```\n\nOr if you are generating your own, make sure to use `org_23rb8YdGqMT0qIzpgGwdXfHirMu` as the `sub` field, and `H256` as the algorithm.\n\n\nExample valid JWT for the secret `x` (so you can see the structure):\n```js\n// JWT: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpYXQiOjE2NTUxNDA2MzksImV4cCI6MTk3MDUwMDYzOSwibmJmIjoxNjU1MTQwNjM5LCJpc3MiOiJzdml4LXNlcnZlciIsInN1YiI6Im9yZ18yM3JiOFlkR3FNVDBxSXpwZ0d3ZFhmSGlyTXUifQ.USMuIPrqsZTSj3kyWupCzJO9eyQioBzh5alGlvRbrbA\n// Structure (when decoded):\n{\n  \"iat\": 1655140639,\n  \"exp\": 1970500639,\n  \"nbf\": 1655140639,\n  \"iss\": \"svix-server\",\n  \"sub\": \"org_23rb8YdGqMT0qIzpgGwdXfHirMu\"\n}\n```\n\n### Using a different signing algorithm\n\nAs mentioned above, the default algorithm for signing JWTs is `HS256`. You can select a different algorithm by setting the `jwt_algorithm` config to one of these supported values: `HS384`, `HS512`, `RS256`, `RS384`, `RS512`, or `EdDSA`.\n\n## Operational (incoming) webhooks\n\nOperational webhooks are webhooks that you can subscribe to in order to get notified of important events occurring on the svix-server. The list of supported events is available in [the webhooks section of the API reference](https://api.svix.com/docs#tag/Webhooks).\n\nThe operational webhooks utilize Svix, and are controlled by a special account service account with the following ID: `org_00000000000SvixManagement00`.\n\nThe first step is to turn it on by setting the `operational_webhook_address` config to point to your Svix server. The most common value for this setting is `http://127.0.0.1:8071`, though it may be different based on your specific setup.\n\nThe above step enables operational webhooks on this instance, and the next step is to enable it for your specific organization. As mentioned above, operational webhooks use a normal Svix account behind the scenes, so we'll first need to get the authentication token for this account. To do this you should run:\n\n```\nsvix-server jwt generate org_00000000000SvixManagement00\n```\n\nThis will give you a special JWT to access the operational webhooks account which is different to the normal JWT you use when interacting with Svix. Let's assume for example that the JWT it returned was `op_webhook_token_123`.\n\nTo enable operational webhooks for a specific account we need to first create an application for it in the service account (remember: operational webhooks just use Svix behind the scenes). We'll use the default Svix account as an example: `org_23rb8YdGqMT0qIzpgGwdXfHirMu`.\n\n```\ncurl -X 'POST' \\\n  'http://localhost:8071/api/v1/app/' \\\n  -H 'Authorization: Bearer op_webhook_token_123' \\\n  -H 'Accept: application/json' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{\n        \"name\": \"Operational webhook for default org\",\n        \"uid\": \"org_23rb8YdGqMT0qIzpgGwdXfHirMu\"\n    }'\n```\n\nThis is it, we now have operational webhooks enabled for the default account. The only thing left is adding an endpoint where the operational webhooks are going to be sent to. For example:\n\n```\ncurl -X 'POST' \\\n  'https://api.eu.svix.com/api/v1/app/org_23rb8YdGqMT0qIzpgGwdXfHirMu/endpoint/' \\\n  -H 'Authorization: Bearer AUTH_TOKEN' \\\n  -H 'Accept: application/json' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{\n        \"url\": \"https://operational-webhook-destination.com/webhook/\",\n        \"filterTypes\": [\n          “endpoint.updated”,\n          “endpoint.deleted”\n        ],\n    }'\n```\n\nNote how we use the org ID of the default account as the `app_id` (or rather `uid` in this case), when creating an endpoint.\n\nThat's it. You should now have working operational webhooks. If you ever want to create a new endpoint, or modify an existing endpoint, you just need to generate a JWT for the service account, and then use the JWT like you would use any other Svix account.\n\n## Asymmetric signatures\n\nAs mentioned above, symmetric signatures are recommended. However, please read the following instructions on setting up asymmetric signatures if you have determined that asymmetric signatures are what you need.\n\n### Configuring the keys\n\nBy default, the Svix server generates symmetric secrets for endpoints, which in turn means messages will be signed with symmetric keys. To change this default, set the `default_signature_type` config to `ed25519` as follows:\n\n```toml\ndefault_signature_type = \"ed25519\"\n```\n\nAdditionally, no matter what the default is set to, you can still override it by explicitly setting a key on an endpoint.\nTo set a symmetric key, set the endpoint secret to a secret prefixed with `whsec_`, such as `whsec_51TKyHBy5KFY1Ab98GQ8V60BkWnejkWy`.\nTo set an asymmetric key, set the endpoint secret to a **valid** ed25519 base64 encoded private key prefixed with `whsk_` such as: `whsk_6Xb/dCcHpPea21PS1N9VY/NZW723CEc77N4rJCubMbfVKIDij2HKpMKkioLlX0dRqSKJp4AJ6p9lMicMFs6Kvg==`.\n\nPlease note, that the expected private key structure is: `whsk_${base64(private_key + public_key)}`.\n\nFor testing purposes, new asymmetric key pairs can be generated using the following command:\n```bash\n$ svix-server asymmetric-key generate\n\nSecret key: whsk_6Xb/dCcHpPea21PS1N9VY/NZW723CEc77N4rJCubMbfVKIDij2HKpMKkioLlX0dRqSKJp4AJ6p9lMicMFs6Kvg==\nPublic key: whpk_1SiA4o9hyqTCpIqC5V9HUakiiaeACeqfZTInDBbOir4=\n```\n\n### Signature scheme\n\nSvix uses `ed25519(m)` for signing the webhook messages, and it constructs `m` the same way as it does for the symmetric signatures.\n\nWhen verifying the message you should also ensure that the timestamp is recent enough in order to limit the potential of replay attacks as noted in [the symmetric verification docs](https://docs.svix.com/receiving/verifying-payloads/why).\n\n## Shutting down the server\n\nTo support graceful shutdown on the server, all running tasks are finished before shutting down on a SIGINT/SIGTERM. This usually takes less than ten seconds.\n\n# Differences to the Svix hosted service\n\nOne of our main goals with open sourcing the Svix dispatcher is ease of use. The hosted Svix service, however, is quite complex due to our scale and the infrastructure it requires. This complexity is not useful for the vast majority of people and would make this project much harder to use and much more limited.\nThis is why this code has been adjusted before being released, and some of the features, optimizations, and behaviors supported by the hosted dispatcher are not yet available in this repo. With that being said, other than some known incompatibilities, the internal Svix test suite passes. This means they are already mostly compatible, and we are working hard on bringing them to full feature parity.\n\n# Re-driving Redis DLQ\nWe have an undocumented endpoint for re-driving failed messages that are DLQ'ed. You can do this by calling `POST /api/v1/admin/redrive-dlq/`.\n\nTo monitor the DLQ depth, you should monitor the `svix.queue.depth_dlq` metric. Any non-zero values indicate that there is data in the DLQ. \n\n# Development\n\nCheckout our project specific development guides to get started hacking on Svix!\n\n- [Svix libs README](./README_LIBS.md)\n- [Svix server README](./server/#readme)\n\n# Contributing\n\nContributions are what makes the open source world go round!

For code examples checkout our [API Documentation]()\n\n## Building the Client Libraries\n\nWe use [openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) to autogenerate bindings in each language. We then use these bindings as the building blocks for our exposed API.  To generate these bindings from the root directory of the project run:\n\n```sh\n# Install deps\nyarn\n\n# Generate bindings for every language\n./regen_openapi.sh\n```\n\nOnce you have completed this step you can checkout the README of the language of your choice (found in the language's subdirectory) for detailed steps on building that particular library. You can find links to these guides in the chart [above](#official-svix-client-libraries).\n"
