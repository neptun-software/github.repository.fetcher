This [technique] was developed by Raph Levien.\n\n[technique]: https://raphlinus.github.io/graphics/curves/2019/12/23/flatten-quadbez.html\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Cheap translations and rotations</summary>\n\nTranslations and rotations can be rendered without having to re-flatten the curves, all the while maintaining full quality.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Parallel pixel grid intersection</summary>\n\nLine segments are transformed into pixel segments by intersecting them with the pixel grid. We developed a simple method that performs this computation in *O(1)* and which is run in parallel.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Efficient sorting</summary>\n\nWe ported [crumsort] to Rust and parallelized it with Rayon, delivering improved performance over its pdqsort implementation for 64-bit random data. Scattering pixel segments with a sort was inspired from Allan MacKinnon's work on [Spinel].\n\n[crumsort]: https://github.com/google/crumsort-rs\n[Spinel]: https://cs.opensource.google/fuchsia/fuchsia/+/main:src/graphics/lib/compute/spinel/\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Update only the tiles that change (currently CPU-only)</summary>\n\nWe implemented a fail-fast per-tile optimizer that tries to skip the painting step entirely. A similar approach could also be tested on the GPU.\n\n</details>\n\n|   Animation as it appears on the screen    |                               Updated tiles only                               |\n|:------------------------------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|\n| ![](assets/images/spaceship.webp?raw=true) | ![juice animation updated tiles](assets/images/spaceship-damage.webp?raw=true) |\n\nYou can run the demo above with:\n\n```sh\ncargo run --release -p demo -- spaceship\n```\n\n## Similar Projects\n\nforma draws heavy inspiration from the following projects:\n\n* [Spinel], with a Vulkan 1.2 back-end\n* [vello], with a wgpu back-end\n\n[vello]: https://github.com/linebender/vello\n\n## Example\n\nYou can use the included `demo` example to render a few examples, one of which is a non-compliant & incomplete SVG renderer:\n\n```sh\ncargo run --release -p demo -- svg assets/svgs/paris-30k.svg\n```\n\nIt renders enormous SVGs at interactive framerates, even on CPU: ([compare to your web browser])\n\n[compare to your web browser]: assets/svgs/paris-30k.svg?raw=true\n\n![window rendering map of Germany](assets/images/paris-30k-rendered.png?raw=true)\n\n## (Currently) Missing Pieces 🧩\n\nSince this project is work-in-progress, breakage in the API, while not drastic, is expected. The performance on the GPU back-end is also expected to improve especially on mobile where performance is known to be poor and where the CPU back-end is currently advised instead.\n\nOther than that:\n\n* Automated layer ordering\n* Strokes\n* More color spaces for blends & gradients\n* Faster GPU sorter\n* Use of `f16` for great mobile GPU performance\n\n## Note\n\nThis is not an officially supported Google product.\n"
