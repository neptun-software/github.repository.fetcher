Here's a little list (in no\nparticular order):\n\n- First of all I'd like to thank Raymond F. Boyce and Donald D. Chamberlin for their work on SQL. While I'm not fortunate enough to have\nany connection to them, a lot of their work have laid out guiding principles for my work.\n- I'd also like to thank several people from the Rust community (listed in no particular order):\n    - Aaron Turon: Aaron's work on concurrency libraries have greatly helped in parts of \"design thinking\"\n    - Carl Lerche (@carllerche): For the immense amount of work Carl done on Tokio and related systems.\n    - Michael Vaner (@vorner): For their work on designing concurrency primitives. I'm a great admirer of Michael's work but\n      unfortunately haven't had the opportunity to directly talk.\n    - Amanieu d'Antras (@Amanieu): Amanieu's work on parking_lot and hashbrown have been eye openers for several things that I've designed\n      and implemented, both in and out of Skytable\n\n-- Sayan N.

          "content": "# Changelog\n\nAll changes in this project will be noted in this file.\n\n## Version 0.8.4\n\n### Additions\n\n- Server:\n  - Added `TRUNCATE MODEL` query (and no, I still have no idea why this wasn't present in the first place. There are some things in the universe that no one knows the answer to. This is one of those things.)\n    > Also note: `TRUNCATE MODEL` is root only right now.\n  - Simple lists can now be defined using simple list syntax\n    - For example, instead of `create model spc.mdl(uid: username, notes: list { type: string })` you will now be able to simply use `create model mymodel(uid: username, notes: [string])` instead.\n    - Similarly, instead of `alter model spc.mdl add notes { type: list { type: string } }` you can use `alter model spc.mdl add notes { type: [string] }`\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Server:\n  - Improved diagnostic messages (and output formatting)\n  - Fixed memory leaks across multiple routines (oarticularly startup routines)\n  - Fixed potential segfaults (note: these are *potential segfaults* as we were not able to actually reproduce it anywhere despite heavy permutation\n  testing, but the fixes were made out of an abundance of caution)\n- CLI:\n  - Upgraded client driver to fix loading of large blob/string fetches from the database\n\n## Version 0.8.3\n\n### Additions\n\n- Server:\n  - Added the `backup` subcommand to create unattended manifest-based backups\n  - Added the `restore` subcommand to enable unattended restore for manifest-based backups\n- Benchmark tool:\n  - Supports *full spectrum latency analysis* and offers advanced insight into executed queries:\n    - Latency distributions\n    - Mean/Min/Max/Stdev statistics\n    - Details about executed workload and its tasks with clear descriptions of what was executed\n  - Switch to using `workload` based benchmarks\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Server:\n  - Fixed error messages\n  - Fixed a bug where an empty GNS won't detect a missing data directory which could cause issues with DDL transactions\n- Benchmark tool:\n  - Running a SIGINT now gracefully terminates the workload\n\n## Version 0.8.2\n\n### Additions\n\n- Server:\n  - Skyhash/2: Restored support for pipelines\n  - Enable online (runtime) recovery of transactional failures due to disk errors\n  - Added BlueQL shorthands:\n    - `INSERT`: `INS`\n    - `SELECT`: `SEL`\n    - `UPDATE`: `UPD`\n    - `DELETE`: `DEL`\n  - Added new `UPSERT` (shorthand: `UPS`) query\n  - Auto-compaction of journal(s) on boot\n  - Allow manual compaction with `skyd compact` subcommand\n- CLI:\n  - Enable setting custom history file location using the `SKYSH_HISTORY_FILE` environment variable\n  - Correctly format rows as CSV when using `--eval`\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Server:\n  - Fixed an issue where an incorrect handshake with multiple errors caused the client connection\n    to be terminated without yielding an error\n  - Fixed SE bug that resulted in unsafe cleanup of journals when multiple failures occur in sequence\n  - Fixed SE memory management bug in delta diff algorithm: In rare cases, a crash might occur on startup (*only during startup* and *not* at runtime)\n  - Fixed DCL command `sysctl alter user` not working properly (preventing change of any data)\n- CLI:\n  - Fixed transient history file location. History is now always saved to $HOME/.sky_history\n  - Fixed an issue where queries were not correctly parameterized when using `--eval`\n\n### Platform notes\n\n- 32-bit Windows (MSVC) has been downgraded to a Tier-2 platform and will likely be deprecated in the future\n- Linux ARM64 is now a Tier-1 platform\n- macOS ARM64 is a now a Tier-1X platform\n\n## Version 0.8.1\n\n### Additions\n\n- Added support for manual repair with the `skyd repair` command\n\n### Fixes\n\n- **Server**:\n  - Fixed migration from v1 SE (released with v0.8.0-beta) to v2 SE (released in v0.8.0)\n  - Fixed health reporting\n  - Fixed a connection crash (not a server-wide crash) at the pre-connection stage when authentication data\n    was sent incorrectly\n- **CLI**:\n  - Fixed `--eval` output. All server errors are now correctly written to `stderr`\n  - Guard against empty passwords\n\n## Version 0.8.0\n\n> This is the first release of Skytable Octave, and it changes the query API entirely making all previous versions incompatible\n> excluding the data files which are automatically upgraded per our backwards compatibility guarantees\n\n### Additions\n\n#### BlueQL query language\n\n- DDL:\n  - `space`s are the equivalent of the `keyspace` from previous versions\n  - `model`s are the equivalent of `table`s from previous version\n  - The following queries were added:\n    - `CREATE SPACE [IF NOT EXISTS] ...`\n    - `CREATE MODEL [IF NOT EXISTS] ...`\n      - Nested lists are now supported\n      - Type definitions are now supported\n      - Multiple fields are now supported\n    - `ALTER SPACE ...`\n    - `ALTER MODEL ...`\n    - `DROP SPACE [IF EXISTS] ...`\n    - `DROP MODEL [IF EXISTS] ...`\n    - `USE <space>`:\n      - works just like SQL\n      - **does not work with DDL queries**: the reason it works in this way is to prevent accidental deletes\n    - `INSPECT ...`:\n      - `INSPECT global`: can be used to inspect the global state, seeing all spaces currently present on the system, users and other information. Some information is limited to the root account only (as JSON)\n      - `INSPECT space <space>`: can be used to inspect a single space, returning a list of models and relevant information (as JSON)\n      - `INSPECT model <model>`: can be used to inspect a single model, returning declaration and relevant information (as JSON)\n- DML:\n  - **All actions removed**: All the prior `SET`, `GET` and other actions have been removed in favor of the new query language\n  - The following queries were added:\n    - `INSERT INTO <space>.<model>(col, col2, col3, ...)`\n      - Insert queries can use several ways of insertion including:\n        - a standard order of declared columns like this:\n\n          ```sql\n          INSERT INTO myspace.mymodel(col1, col2, col3, ...)\n          ```\n\n        - using a map:\n\n          ```sql\n          INSERT INTO myspace.mymodel { col1: val1, col2: val2, col4: val4, col3: val3 }\n          ```\n\n      - Inserts can also make use of function calls during inserts:\n        - It can be called like this: `INSERT INTO myspace.mymodel(@uuidstr, ...)`\n        - The following functions are available:\n          - `@uuidstr`: returns a string with a randomly generated v4 UUID\n          - `@uuidbin`: same as `@uuidstr` but returns it as a blob\n          - `@timesec`: returns a 64-bit integer with the current time in seconds\n    - `SELECT [ALL] field1, field2, ... FROM <space>.<model> WHERE <primary_key_column> = <value> [LIMIT n]`\n    - New data manipulation via `UPDATE` allows arithmetic operations, string manipulation and more! Examples:\n      - `UPDATE <space>.<model> SET col_num += 1 WHERE <primary_key_column> = <value>`\n      - `UPDATE <space>.<model> SET mystring += \" last part of string\" WHERE ...`\n    - `DELETE FROM <space>.<model> WHERE <primary_key_column> = <value>`\n- DCL:\n  - `SYSCTL CREATE USER <name> WITH { password: <password> }`\n  - `SYSCTL ALTER USER <name> WITH { password: <new password> }`\n  - `SYSCTL DROP USER <name>`\n\n#### Fractal engine\n\n- The fractal engine is the start of the development of advanced internal state management in Skytable\n- Effectively balances performance and reliability tasks\n\n#### Skyhash 2 protocol\n\n- The `Skyhash-2` protocol now uses a multi-stage connection sequence for improved security and performance\n- Seamless auth\n- More types\n- Fewer retransmissions\n\n#### Storage engines\n\n- **New `deltax` storage engine for data**:\n  - The `deltax` storage engine monitors the database for changes and only records the changes in an append only file\n  - The interval can be adjusted per requirements of reliability\n  - Faster and hugely more reliable than the previous engine\n- **New DDL ACID transactions with with the `logx` engine**:\n  - DDL queries are now fully transactional which means that if they are executed, you can be sure that they were complete and synced to disk\n  - This largely improves reliability\n\n#### New shell\n\n- The new client shell easily authenticates based on the Skyhash-2 protocol\n- More reliable\n\n#### Benchmark tool\n\n- New benchmark engines to enable more efficient and real-world load testing\n- New benchmark engines use far lesser memory\n- New engines can handle midway benchmark crashes\n\n### Breaking changes\n\n- `skyd`:\n  - **The entire query API has changed as actions have been removed**\n  - **Spaces and models**: replace keyspaces and models respectively\n  - **Configuration**:\n    - The configuration system now uses YAML instead of TOML for better readability\n    - The configuration options have changed across CLI, ENV and the config file\n    - Authentication **must be enabled** irrespective of `dev`/`prod` mode\n- `sky-bench`:\n  - New benchmark engines are completely different from the previous engines (see above)\n  - Configuration options have changed because of how the new Skytable engine works\n- `skysh`:\n  - Configuration options have changed because of how the new Skytable engine works\n- `sky-migrate`: **This tool is deprecated and has been removed**. The Skytable engine will now automatically manage data upgrades. (please see [this issue](https://github.com/skytable/skytable/issues/320) for discussion on the same)\n\n## Version 0.7.6\n\n### Fixes\n\n- `skyd`:\n  - Fixed erroneous removal of `auth` system table during tree cleanup (see #276)\n- `sky-bench`:\n  - Fixed sample space calculation\n\n### Breaking changes\n\n- The `testkey` subcommand was removed. This was done due to the addition of different data types making this command\n  redundant since it only works with simple key/value pairs\n\n## Version 0.7.5\n\n### Additions\n\n- `sys` action for system information and metrics:\n  - `info`: For static properties:\n    - `version`: Server version\n    - `protocol`: Protocol version string (Skyhash-x.y)\n    - `protover`: Protocol version float\n  - `metric`: For dynamic properties:\n    - `health`: System health\n    - `storage`: Bytes used for on-disk storage\n- `INSPECT KEYSPACE` without arguments to inspect the current keyspace\n- `INSPECT TABLE` without arguments to inspect the current table\n- `AUTH WHOAMI` returns the AuthID of the currently logged in user\n\n### Improvements\n\n- Enable multiples values to be pushed into a list at once with `lmod push`\n- (skyd) Improved error reporting infrastructure with more details and context\n\n### Fixes\n\n- skysh:\n  - Added error code output for new error codes which otherwise printed \"Unknown error\"\n  - Fixed handling of EOF keystroke\n- skyd:\n  - Respect logging level for all terminal output\n  - Fixed LF check in protocol impl\n  - Fixed new instance detection (now checks if data directory is empty or not)\n  - Fixed panic resulting from corrupted metadata in `PARTMAP`\n  - Fixed invalid pipeline response when action error is propagated from a single stage\n  - Fixed bug where the preload wasn't flushed if a snapshot already flushed it before the\n    save on termination routine\n  - Fixed bug that prevented tree cleanup from working\n  - Disallow `PRELOAD` and `PARTMAP` as entity names\n  - Fixed edge case where time on host is incorrect, resulting in bad snapshot names which might\n    ultimately lead to loss of snapshot data\n  - Fixed remote snapshots with same names being overwritten\n- (sky-bench) Fixed `testkey` causing RSTs\n\n## Version 0.7.4\n\n### Additions\n\n- Token-based authentication:\n  - `auth claim`\n  - `auth login <username> <token>`\n  - `auth logout`\n  - `auth adduser <username>`\n  - `auth deluser <username>`\n  - `auth restore <username>`\n  - `auth restore <origin key> <username>`\n  - `auth listuser`\n- Shell now supports multiple `--eval` expressions\n- Partial entity syntax: `:table` can be used for referring to the current table. For example\n  you can use `use :default` instead of `use default:default`\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Fixed snapshot option being silently ignored in configuration file\n- Fixed snapshot engine init failure\n\n## Version 0.7.3\n\n### Additions\n\n- Added `dev/prod` mode for making sure that the recommended production settings are used\n- Added support for system native endian storage (backward compatible)\n- Added `range` to `lget` to get subarrays\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Fixed infinite wait (loop) when sample space for key generation is not large enough\n- Fixed infinite save-on-termination loop. Now loop uses a threshold and on 4 subsequent `SIGINT` signals,\n  it will quit forcefully\n- Removed `upgrade` subcommand from `skyd` which was removed in 0.7, but was erroneously accepted in the CLI\n  parameters\n- Restored ability to use `--restore <backupdir>` to restore data from previous snapshots which was silently\n  ignored\n\n## Version 0.7.2\n\n### Additions\n\n- `skyd`:\n  - Pipelined queries are now supported:\n    - Saves bandwidth\n    - Reduces latency\n  - The new non-null typed array type was added\n  - The `whereami` action was added which lets one find out which entity the current connection\n    is connected to\n- `skysh`:\n  - now shows the current entity in the prompt\n  - handles special character strings more reliably\n  - now supports splitting a command across multiple lines\n  - now supports multi-line pastes\n  - now supports comments (beginning with `#`)\n\n## Version 0.7.1\n\n### Additions\n\n- Added the list data type\n- Added actions for lists:\n  - `LSET <list> <values> ...`\n  - `LGET`\n    - `LGET <list>`\n    - `LGET <list> LEN`\n    - `LGET <list> VALUEAT <idx>`\n    - `LGET <list> LIMIT <limit>`\n    - `LGET <list> FIRST`\n    - `LGET <list> LAST`\n  - `LMOD`\n    - `LMOD <list> push <value>`\n    - `LMOD <list> insert <index> <value>`\n    - `LMOD <list> pop <optional index>`\n    - `LMOD <list> remove <index>`\n    - `LMOD <list> clear`\n- Added creation of lists:\n  - `CREATE TABLE <entity> keymap(type,list<type>)`\n- Added compatibility of `DEL`, `EXISTS` and `LSKEYS` with lists\n- Added support for configuration via environment variables\n\n### Improvements\n\n- Reduced memory usage in `sky-bench`\n- Reduced allocations in Skyhash (`skyd`) protocol implementation\n- Misc. fixes in internal structures (`skyd`)\n- Improvements in printing of binary strings in `skysh`\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Fixed unexpected removal of single and double quotes from input strings in `skysh`\n- Fixed incorrect removal of quotes from input strings in `skysh`\n\n## Version 0.7.0\n\n### Additions\n\n- **Multiple keyspaces**:\n  - Keyspaces hold multiple tables and determine the replication strategy\n  - Keyspaces can be created with:\n\n    ```sql\n    CREATE KEYSPACE <name>\n    ```\n\n  - The `system` keyspace is reserved for the system while the `default` keyspace is\n    the one available by default. The `system` or `default` keyspace cannot be removed\n  - Keyspaces can be deleted with:\n\n    ```sql\n    DROP KEYSPACE <name>\n    ```\n\n  - If a keyspace still has tables, it cannot be dropped by using `DROP KEYSPACE <name>`, instead\n    one needs to use `DROP KEYSPACE <name> force` to force drop the keyspace\n- **Multiple tables**:\n  - Tables hold the actual data. When you connect to the server, you are connected to the `default`\n    table in the `default` keyspace. This table is non-removable\n  - Tables can be created with:\n\n    ```sql\n    CREATE TABLE <entity> <model>(modelargs) <properties>\n    ```\n\n  - Tables can be dropped with:\n\n    ```sql\n    DROP TABLE <entity>\n    ```\n\n- **Entity groups**: While using DDL queries and inspection queries, we can use the *Fully Qualified Entity* (FQE) syntax instead of the table name. For example, to `inspect` the `cyan` table in keyspace `supercyan`, one can simply run:\n\n  ```sql\n  INSPECT TABLE supercyan:cyan\n  ```\n\n  The syntax is:\n\n  ```sql\n  keyspace:table\n  ```\n\n  **Note**: Both keyspaces and tables are entities. The names of entities must:\n  - Begin with an underscore (\\_) or an ASCII alphabet\n  - Not begin with a number (0-9)\n  - Must have lesser than 64 characters\n- **Keymap data model**:\n  - To create a keymap table, run:\n\n    ```sql\n    CREATE TABLE <entity> keymap(<type>,<type>)\n    ```\n\n  - The following types were introduced:\n    - `str`: A valid unicode string\n    - `binstr`: A binary string\n- **Volatile table property**:\n\n  - To create a volatile table, irrespective of the data model, run:\n\n    ```sql\n    CREATE TABLE <entity> <model>(modelargs) volatile\n    ```\n\n  - Volatile tables always exist, but the data in them does not persist between restarts. This makes them extremely useful for caches\n\n- **Inspection**:\n  - Keyspaces can be inspected with:\n\n    ```sql\n    INSPECT KEYSPACE <name>\n    ```\n\n    This will list all the tables in the keyspace\n  - Tables can be inspected with:\n\n    ```sql\n    INSPECT TABLE <entity>\n    ```\n\n    This will give information about the data model and other properties of the table\n  - To list all keyspaces, this can be run:\n\n    ```sql\n    INSPECT KEYSPACES\n    ```\n\n- **Cyanstore 1A disk storage format**: Cyanstore (v1A) was a new storage format built for the multi-keyspace-table world. It efficiently stores and retrieves records, tables and keyspaces\n- **Realtime keyspace/table switch**\n  - To switch to a new keyspace in real-time, one needs to run:\n\n    ```sql\n    USE keyspace\n    ```\n\n  - To switch to a new table in real-time, one needs to run:\n\n    ```sql\n    USE keyspace:table\n    ```\n\n- **Entity respecting actions**:\n\n  - **`FLUSHDB`**: To flush all the data in a specific table, run:\n\n    ```sql\n    FLUSHDB <entity>\n    ```\n\n  - **`DBSIZE`**: To see the number of entries in a specific table, run:\n\n    ```sql\n    DBSIZE <entity>\n    ```\n\n  - **`LSKEYS`**:\n    - `LSKEYS` will return keys from the current table\n    - `LSKEYS <count>` will return *count* keys from the current table\n    - `LSKEYS <entity>` will return keys from the given table\n    - `LSKEYS <entity> <count>` will return *count* keys from the given table\n\n- **Snapshot isolation for strong actions**: This makes strong actions\n  extremely reliable when compared to the earlier releases\n- Non-interactive TLS private key passphrase input: Just save your password in some\n  file and then pass `--tlspassin /path/to/passfile.txt`. You can do the same by using the\n  `tlspassin` key under SSL in the configuration file\n- `MPOP` now replaces `POP` to accept multiple keys while `POP` will accept a single key\n  to follow the `MGET`/`GET` naming convention\n- TLS port can now be set to a custom port via CLI arguments\n- `sky-bench` can now run multiple times to get average values through the `--runs` option\n- `HEYA` now does an echo with the second argument\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Zero length argument causing runtime panic in `skysh`\n- `HEYA!` not reporting errors on incorrect number of arguments\n- Panic on incorrect data type in `skyd`\n- `sky-bench` no longer affects your personal data because it creates a random temporary table\n  under the `default` keyspace\n- `sky-bench`'s `testkey` subcommand causing key collisions\n- Fix log output in `sky-bench` even if the `--json` flag was passed\n- Use flocks to enable auto release of pid file, even if process is forcefully terminated\n- Fixes [CVE-2021-37625](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-37625)\n\n### Breaking\n\n- All actions now accept the `AnyArray` type introduced in Skyhash 1.1\n- `POP` now accepts one key while `MPOP` accepts multiple keys\n- Disk storage format has changed\n- The `upgrade` subcommand has been removed\n\n## Version 0.6.4 [2021-08-05]\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Fixes [CVE-2021-37625](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-37625) (backport)\n\n## Version 0.6.3 [2021-06-27]\n\n### Additions\n\n- The maximum number of clients can now be manually configured [see [#182](https://github.com/skytable/skytable/pull/182)]\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Ability to connect to the server over TLS has been restored in `skysh` [see [#181](https://github.com/skytable/skytable/pull/181)]\n\n## Version 0.6.2 [2021-06-24]\n\n### Fixes\n\n- The save operation now automatically attempts to recover on failure during termination [see [#166](https://github.com/skytable/skytable/pull/166)]\n- More than one process can no longer concurrently use the same data directory, preventing any possible data corruption [see [#169](https://github.com/skytable/skytable/pull/169), [#167](https://github.com/skytable/skytable/issues/167)]\n- Fixed longstanding error in `sky-bench` component that caused key collisions\n- Fixed bug in `sky-bench` that allowed passing 0 for the inputs\n- Fixed handling of SIGTERM in `skyd` [see [#178](https://github.com/skytable/skytable/pull/178)]\n- Fixed incorrect termination codes [see [#178](https://github.com/skytable/skytable/pull/178)]\n\n### Additions\n\n- Added the `POP` query [[see #173](https://github.com/skytable/skytable/pull/173)]\n- Added stress testing for testing correctness under load [[see #175](https://github.com/skytable/skytable/pull/175)]\n\n### Workflow\n\n- Use Makefiles for builds [see [#172](https://github.com/skytable/skytable/pull/172), [#174](https://github.com/skytable/skytable/pull/174)]\n- Tier-1 Support for ARM64 [see [#179](https://github.com/skytable/skytable/pull/179)]\n\n## Version 0.6.1 [2021-06-07]\n\n> No breaking changes\n\n- Snapshotting failure will now poison the database (customizable through CLI options or the configuration file)\n  [see [#160](https://github.com/skytable/skytable/pull/160)]\n- Added file-locking on Solaris [see [#162](https://github.com/skytable/skytable/pull/162)]\n- Fixed missing explicit `fsync` or `FlushFileBuffers` after writing data\n- Optimized wait on snapshot busy-loop using `_mm_pause` (on x86/x86_64) or `__yield` (on aarch64/arm)\n\n## Version 0.6.0 [2021-05-27]\n\n> Breaking changes!\n\n- ⚠ Dropped support for Terrapipe 1.0 (reached EOL)\n- ⚠ New disk storage format with much faster reads and/or writes\n- Added support for Skyhash 1.0 (see [#147](https://github.com/skytable/skytable/pull/147))\n- Fixed persistence bugs (see [#151](https://github.com/skytable/skytable/pull/151))\n- Fixed bugs in background services (see [#152](https://github.com/skytable/skytable/pull/152))\n- Make BGSAVE recoverable (see [#153](https://github.com/skytable/skytable/pull/153))\n- Added `lskeys` action (see [#155](https://github.com/skytable/skytable/pull/155))\n- Added `compat` module (see [#158](https://github.com/skytable/skytable/pull/158))\n- Added backward compatibility for storage formats all the way upto 0.3.0. See [this wiki article](https://github.com/skytable/skytable/wiki/Disk-storage-formats) for more information\n\n### Upgrading existing clients\n\nAs Terrapipe 1.0 has reached EOL, all clients have to be upgraded to use the [Skyhash 1.0 Protocol](https://docs.skytable.io/protocol/skyhash).\n\n### Upgrading existing datasets\n\nPlease refer to [this wiki article](https://github.com/skytable/skytable/wiki/Disk-storage-formats).\n\n### Improvements in the new protocol (Skyhash)\n\n- Upto 40% lower bandwidth requirements\n- Upto 30% faster queries\n- Support for recursive arrays\n- More robust and well tested than Terrapipe\n\n### Internal codebase improvements\n\n- BGSAVE is now tested by the test suite\n- `skysh` and `sky-bench` both use the [Rust client driver for Skytable](https://github.com/skytable/client-rust).\n\n## Version 0.5.3 [2021-05-13]\n\n> No breaking changes\n\nFix persistence (see [#150](https://github.com/skytable/skytable/issues/150))\n\n## Version 0.5.2 [2021-05-07]\n\n> No breaking changes\n\n- `sky-bench` is less agressive and runs sanity test before benchmarking\n- `skyd` now locks the data file (the `data.bin` file)\n- The data directory structure has been changed (see #144) (all files are now stored in ./data/\\*)\n- Fixed 'Connection Forcibly Closed' errors on Windows (see #110)\n- Add support for line-editing and keyboard shortcuts on `skysh` (see #142)\n- Fixed problems while parsing snapshots in the snapshot directory (see #144)\n- The old data directory structure has been deprecated (see #144)\n- Official support for 32-bit platforms (see #139)\n- Tier-2 Support for Linux musl (x86_64) (see #136, #135)\n\n## Version 0.5.1 [2021-03-17]\n\n> No breaking changes\n\n- Built-in TLS/SSL support\n- Custom host/port settings in `sky-bench`\n- Mock keys can be created with `sky-bench`\n- Security patch for VE/S/00001 [(CVE-2021-32814)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32814)\n- Escaping for spaces in `skysh`\n- `tdb` is now called `skyd` (short for 'Skytable Daemon')\n\n## Version 0.5.0 [2020-11-19]\n\n> This release introduces breaking changes!\n\n- Command line configuration added to `tdb`\n- ⚠ Positional arguments in `tsh` and `tdb-bench` have been removed\n- `MKSNAP` now has an *enhanced version* which enables snapshots to be created even if they're disabled on the server side\n- If `BGSAVE` fails, no more writes will be accepted on the server side. All commands that try to modify data will return an internal server error\n- `tdb-bench` now provides JSON output with the `--json` flag\n- The `Dockerfile` was fixed to use command line arguments instead of the configuration file which caused problems\n- The `enabled` key under the `snapshots` key in the configuration file has been removed\n\n### Upgrading\n\n- Users who ran `tsh` like `tsh 172.17.0.1 2003` will now need to run:\n\n```shell\ntsh -h 172.17.0.1 -p 2003\n```\n\n- Users who ran `tdb-bench` like `tdb-bench 10 100000 4` will now need to run:\n\n```shell\ntdb-bench -c 10 -q 100000 -s 4\n```\n\n- To enable snapshots, you just have to add the key: there is no need for the `enabled` key. To disable snapshots, you just have to omit the `snapshot` key (block) from your configuration file\n\n## Version 0.4.5 [2020-10-29]\n\n> No breaking changes\n\nThis release adds support for automated snapshots, while also adding the `MKSNAP` action for doing the same remotely.\n\n## Version 0.4.4 [2020-10-03]\n\n> No breaking changes\n\nThis release adds the following actions: `KEYLEN` and `USET`\n\n## Version 0.4.3 [2020-09-25]\n\n> No breaking changes\n\nThis release adds the following actions:\n`SSET` , `SUPDATE` , `SDEL` , `DBSIZE` and `FLUSHDB`\n\n## Version 0.4.2 [2020-09-19]\n\n> No breaking changes\n\nThis release adds `BGSAVE` for automated background saving (see [#11](https://github.com/skytable/skytable/issues/21))\n\n## Version 0.4.1 [2020-09-06]\n\n> No breaking changes\n\nThis release adds support for configuration files\n\n## Version 0.4.0 [2020-08-30]\n\n> This release introduces breaking changes\n\nChanges:\n\n- Actions added: `MSET` , `MGET` , `MUPDATE`\n- Terrapipe 1.0\n- Improved terminal output\n\nFixes:\n\n- Explicit handling for incomplete responses in `tsh`\n\n### Migrating existing clients\n\nThe Terrapipe protocol was revised and promoted to 1.0. This will cause all existing client implementations to break, since the protocol has changed fundamentally. The clients have to implement the [latest spec](https://terrabasedb.github.io/docs/Protocols/terrapipe).\n\n## Version 0.3.2 [2020-08-07]\n\n> No breaking changes\n\nThe `tsh` component printed the wrong version number. This has been fixed.\n\n## Version 0.3.1 [2020-08-05]\n\n> This release introduces breaking changes\n\nThis release fixes #7, #8. It also adds several under-the-hood optimizations greatly improving query performance.\n\n### Migrating existing clients\n\nThe only significant change in the protocol is the new metalayout format: `#a#b#c` instead of the previously proposed `a#b#c#` .\n\n### Disk storage format\n\nThe disk storage format was changed rendering existing binary data files incompatible. However, if you have any existing data - which is important, open an issue - because we'll be able to provide a tool that can help you easily migrate your existing datasets - with a one line command - so - no worries!\n\n## Version 0.3.0 [2020-07-28] (⚠ EOL)\n\n> No breaking changes.\n\nThis version enables persistence for stored data\n\n## Version 0.2.0 [2020-07-27] (⚠ EOL)\n\n> This release introduces breaking changes\n\nThis release implements the latest version of the Terrapipe protocol.\n\n### Migrating existing clients\n\nAll clients have to reimplement the Terrapipe protocol to match the [latest spec](https://terrabasedb.github.io/docs/Protocols/unsupported-tp).\n\n## Version 0.1.0 [2020-07-17] (⚠ EOL)\n\nThis release provides an experimental client and server implementation.\n"

          "content": "# Contribution guidelines\n\nFirstly, thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! This project is powered by the community\nand relies on hackers across the globe to report bugs, send suggestions and contribute code to move this project forward.\n\n## Ways to contribute\n\n- **#1**: Report bugs\n- **#2**: Give us ideas\n- **#3**: Send patches\n\n## Coding guidelines\n\n### Special comments\n\n- `FIXME(@<username>)` : Use this when you have made an implementation that can be improved in the future, such as improved efficiency\n- `HACK(@<username>)` : Use this when the code you are using a temporary workaround\n- `TODO(@<username>)` : Use this when you have kept something incomplete\n- `UNSAFE(@<username>)` : Use this to explain why the `unsafe` block used is safe\n\n### Comment style\n\nWe prefer to use a 'mixed' commenting style: a cross between the C and C++ styles.\nGenerally, if a comment can be explained in one-line, then follow the C++ commenting style.\nIn other cases, use the C style.\n\n### Formatting\n\n- All Rust code should be formatted using `rustfmt`\n- Imports in Rust source files are to be merged into a single `use` block. For example, instead of:\n  ```rust\n  use devtimer::SimpleTimer;\n  use devtimer::ComplexTimer;\n  use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};\n  use crate::something;\n  ```\n\n  this mode of styling is preferred:\n\n  ```rust\n  use {\n      devtimer::{SimpleTimer, ComplexTimer},\n      serde::{Serialize, Deserialize},\n      crate::something,\n  };\n  ```\n\n### Parts of the project\n\nThe main parts (ignorning CI scripts, stress test suite, test harness and custom compiler macros) are:\n\n- `cli`: interactive shell `skysh`\n- `server`: server daemon `skyd`\n- `sky-bench`: benchmark tool\n\nThe `pkg` folder contains scripts used to build packages for different targets. The `examples` folder\ncontains example configuration files.\n\n### Branches\n\nThe `next` branch is the _kind of_ stable branch which contains the latest changes. However, for most purposes, you should always download sources from the tags.\n\nPushes are made directly to next if they don't change things significantly; for example, changes in \ndocumentation comments and general optimizations. If however the changes are huge, then they must be created \non a separate branch, a pull request opened, the CI suite run and finally merged into next.\n\n## Pull request guidelines\n\n### Typo correction or doc updates\n\nThe creation of superflous merge requests is generally discouraged. Such examples include the creation of \nmultiple PRs to correct single typos, update comments or update docs.\n\nIt would be far better if you could fix a considerable subset (if not all) of these issues in one pull request (it's fine to create multiple commits in the same PR).\nThis is because we don't want to utilize compute capacity or multiply our git history for changes\nthat do not have any behavioral impact. It is recommended that you open up a single PR and correct a substantial subset of these inconsistencies (if not all), while also adding `[skip ci]` or `[ci skip]` in your\ncommit messages to avoid triggering the workflows.\n\n## Steps\n\n1. Fork the repository\n2. Make your changes and start a pull request\n3. Sign the CLA (if you haven't signed it already)\n4. One of the maintainers will review your patch and suggest changes if required\n5. Once your patch is approved, it will be merged into the respective branch\n6. Done, you're now a contributor. Thank you.\n\n## Development environment setup\n\nSkytable uses a Makefile for builds and running the test suite along with a number of tools. To set these up:\n\n1. Install the latest Rust toolchain (stable)\n2. Install a C Compiler, Make, Perl and the libssl-dev package on platforms where they are required\n3. On Windows:\n   - You might need to perform additional steps to add `perl` to our `PATH` variable\n   - You may also need to set up powershell if it isn't set up already as it is used by the test script\n\n**Building**\n\n1. For debug (unoptimized) builds:\n   ```\n   make build\n   ```\n2. For release (optimized) builds:\n   ```\n   make release\n   ```\n\n> **TIP**: You can explicitly specify a target triple by setting a `TARGET` environment variable\n\n**Testing**\n\nTesting is simple: just run this:\n\n```\nmake test\n```\n\n> **NOTE**: Make sure port 2003 and 2004 are not used by any applications. Also, make sure your _own instance_ isn't running on any of these ports; if that is the case, you might end up losing data due to conflicting entity names! The test suite creates multiple spaces and some models within it to run all the tests.\n"

By contrast,\nour General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights\nwith two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer\nyou this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\nand/or modify the software.\n\n  A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that\nimprovements made in alternate versions of the program, if they\nreceive widespread use, become available for other developers to\nincorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and\nencouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of\nsoftware used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.\nThe GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and\nletting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its\nsource code to the public.\n\n  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to\nensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available\nto the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to\nprovide the source code of the modified version running there to the\nusers of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on\na publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source\ncode of the modified version.\n\n  An older license, called the Affero General Public License and\npublished by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is\na different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has\nreleased a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under\nthis license.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the\nProgram, your modified version must prominently offer all users\ninteracting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version\nsupports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding\nSource of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source\nfrom a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary\nmeans of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source\nshall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3\nof the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the\nfollowing paragraph.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version\n3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions\nwill be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS"

Skytable's data model is based on a column-oriented structure with support for additional data models<sup>(WIP)</sup>. Querying is done using BlueQL, a SQL-based query language hardened against injection attacks, written specifically for Skytable.\n\nSkytable is best-suited for applications that need to store large-scale data, need high-performance and low latencies.\n\n> **You can read more about Skytable's architecture, including information on the clustering and HA implementation that we're currently working on, and limitations [on this page](https://docs.skytable.io/architecture).**\n\n## Features\n\n- **Spaces, models and more**: For flexible data definition\n- **Powerful querying with BlueQL**: A modern query language based on SQL\n- **Rich data modeling**: Use `model`s to define data with complex types, collections and more\n- **Performant**: Optimized multithreaded network I/O, write batching and several other optimizations\n- **Secure**: Injection deterrence using BlueQL and other memory safety measures\n- **Enforces best practices**: If you're building with Skytable today, the practices you'll get used to here will let you easily take on the job of building performant systems, even outside Skytable\n\n> Learn more about [Skytable's features here](https://docs.skytable.io).\n\n## Getting started\n\n1. **Set up Skytable on your machine**: You'll need to download a bundled release file [from the releases page](https://github.com/skytable/skytable/releases). Unzip the files and you're ready to go.\n2. Start the database server: `./skyd --auth-root-password <password>` with your choice of a password for the `root` account. The `root` account is just like a `root` account on Unix based systems that has control over everything.\n3. Start the interactive client REPL: `./skysh` and then enter your password.\n4. Your setup is now complete.\n\n> **For a more detailed guide on installation and deployment, [follow the guide here.](https://docs.skytable.io/installation)**\n\n## Using Skytable\n\nSkytable has `SPACE`s instead of `DATABASE`s due to signficant operational differences (and because `SPACE`s store a lot more than tabular data).\n\n**With the REPL started, follow this guide**:\n\n1. Create a `space` and switch to it:\n\n   ```sql\n   CREATE SPACE myspace\n   USE myspace\n   ```\n\n2. Create a `model`:\n\n   ```sql\n   CREATE MODEL myspace.mymodel(username: string, password: string, notes: list { type: string })\n   ```\n\n   The rough representation for this in Rust would be:\n\n   ```rust\n   pub struct MyModel {\n    username: String,\n    password: String,\n    notes: Vec<String>,\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. `INSERT` some data:\n\n   ```sql\n   INSERT INTO mymodel('sayan', 'pass123', [])\n   ```\n\n4. `UPDATE` some data:\n\n   ```sql\n   UPDATE mymodel SET notes += \"my first note\" WHERE username = 'sayan'\n   ```\n\n5. `SELECT` some data\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT * FROM mymodel WHERE username = 'sayan'\n   ```\n\n6. Modify and run your own queries to understand how things work. **And then make sure you [read the documentation learn BlueQL](https://docs.skytable.io/blueql/overview).**\n\n> **For a complete guide on Skytable, it's architecture, BlueQL, queries and more we strongly recommend you to [read the documentation here.](https://docs.skytable.io)**\n>\n> While you're seeing strings and other values being used here, this is so because the REPL client smartly parameterizes queries behind the scenes. **BlueQL has mandatory parameterization**. (See below to see how the Rust client handles this)\n\n## Find a client driver\n\nYou need a client driver to use Skytable in your programs. Officially, we maintain a regularly updated [Rust client driver](https://github.com/skytable/client-rust) which is liberally license under the Apache-2.0 license so that you can use it anywhere.\n\nUsing the Rust client driver, it's very straightforward to run queries thanks to Rust's powerful type system and macros:\n\n```rust\nuse skytable::{Config, query};\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut db = Config::new_default(\"username\", \"password\").connect().unwrap();\n    let query = query!(\"select username, password from myspace.mymodel where username = ?\", \"sayan\");\n    let (username, password): (String, Vec<u8>) = db.query_parse(&query).unwrap();\n    // do something with it\n}\n```\n\n> **You can find more information on client drivers on [this page](https://docs.skytable.io/libraries). If you want to help write a client driver for your language of choice, *we're here to support your work*. Please reach out to: <hey@skytable.io> or leave a message on our Discord server.**\n\n## Getting help\n\nWe exclusively use [Discord](https://discord.gg/QptWFdx) for most real-time communications — you can chat with developers, maintainers, and our amazing users. Outside that, we recommend that you use our [GitHub Discussions page](https://github.com/skytable/skytable/discussions) for any questions or open a new issue if you think you've found a bug.\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease read the [contributing guide here](./CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nPlease read the [acknowledgements](./ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.txt) document.\n\n## License\n\nSkytable is distributed under the [AGPL-3.0 License](./LICENSE). **You may not use Skytable's logo for other projects.**\n"

First prepare an [MCVE](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) to exploit the vulnerability\n2. Move your MCVE into a new directory and create a file `EXPLOIT.txt`\n3. Within the `EXPLOIT.txt` file, describe:\n   - What version/tag/commit was exploited\n   - A description of the exploit and its impact\n   - How to run your MCVE (incl. required frameworks/dependencies/tools/et cetera)\n4. Also at the end of the `EXPLOIT.txt` file, write an affirmation:\n   ```\n   I, <NAME> affirm that all information provided here is correct to my knowledge and I will comply and coordinate with the team as required. I also\n   acknowledge that I am making this submission as a voluntary effort.\n   ```\n   replacing `<NAME>` with your real name.\n5. Compress your files into a ZIP archive\n6. Encrypt the ZIP archive using [our PGP public key linked below](#pgp).\n7. Email the archive to: [security@skytable.io](mailto:security@skytable.io). DO NOT include any information in the email body/subject because\ne-mail is insecure. Set the subject line to `[SECURITY EXPLOIT] [DD-MM-YYYY]`.\n\n## Credits\n\nYou will be acknowledged in the report for your discovery of the exploit\nand will also be mentioned in the CVE report filed (if any).\n\n## Timeline\n\n1. You/we discover and report a vulnerability\n2. The team acknowledges it (usually through an e-mail) and creates an internal ticket within 24 hours\n3. The team coordinates with itself/you to prepare a hotfix\n4. The hotfix is released and the time of release is noted\n5. 48 hours after the hotfix has been released, the vulnerability is\n   disclosed\n6. A CVE and/or a [Security Advisory](https://security.skytable.io) is issued and released to the public.\n\n## Conditions\n\n1. You may **not** disclose anything before the team publicly discloses the vulnerability\n2. You agree that this is voluntary work\n\n## Supported versions\n\nThe most recent 'stable channel' release (i.e not a pre-release as per Semver) receives a security hotfix and a patch will be released for older versions\nwho need to deploy a fix.\n\n## PGP\n\nOur PGP public key can be found [here](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/DA60821CD47EDCC9FF4702AF66F326F3B98EAF90).\nTo encrypt your ZIP file:\n```sh\nwget https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/DA60821CD47EDCC9FF4702AF66F326F3B98EAF90 -O skytable.pgp  # download the key\ngpg --import skytable.pgp                                                                                     # import the key\ngpg --output <ZIPFILE>.encrypted.zip --encrypt <ZIPFILE>.zip --recipient nandansayan@outlook.com              # encrypt the archive\n```\nReplace `<ZIPFILE>` with the name of your ZIP file. The output file will be `<ZIPFILE>.encrypted.zip` and this is what you have to send to the provided e-mail\n"
