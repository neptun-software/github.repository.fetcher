Add `IS_BROWSER` constant to `Html`.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/274).\n    For projects that target HTML, it is recommended to use the `Html` trait instead of\n    `GenericNode`. This will ensure that it cannot be used on rendering backends that are not for\n    HTML. To check if code is executing on the browser, access the `Html::IS_BROWSER` constant on\n    the generic rendering backend. This also slightly changes the `GenericNode` interface which is\n    why it is a breaking change but would most likely not influence you.\n  - [Make `GenericNode` generic over the event type.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/297)\n    The event type is now an associated type to allow rendering backends to use another type from\n    `web_sys::Event`.\n  - [Rename `Template` to `View` and `template!` to `view!`.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/298)\n    For most cases, a simple search-and-replace will suffice, replacing all instances of `Template`\n    to `View` and all instances of `template!` to `view!`.\n  - [Rename `StateHandle` to `ReadSignal`.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/300) The\n    old name was somewhat confusing and did not reflect that `StateHandle` was just a read-only\n    signal.\n\n## ✨ **0.6.3** _(2021-10-10)_\n\n- #### 🛠 Fixes\n\n  - [Respect basename when navigating using router.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/275)\n\n## ✨ **0.6.2** _(2021-10-09)_\n\n- #### ⚡️ Features\n\n  - [Add `GenericNode::remove_property` method.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/267)\n  - [Add `node!` macro for creating a single node.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/265)\n\n- #### 🛠 Fixes\n\n  - [Do not strip leading `/` from pathname.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/271) This\n    fixes an issue with the router on Firefox when navigating to the index page.\n\n- #### Internal\n\n  - [Remove `ToTokens` impl for `TagName`.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/273)\n\n## ✨ **0.6.1** _(2021-09-25)_\n\n- #### 🛠 Fixes\n\n  - [Disable `full` feature on `syn` to reduce compile times.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/245)\n  - [Use a global `HashSet` for void elements lookup in SSR.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/246)\n  - [Remove part of formatting machinery from `sycamore` and `sycamore-reactive` to reduce binary size.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/247)\n  - [Fix panic on updating dynamic node inside a template fragment.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/251)\n  - [Implement `Default` for `Signal`.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/257)\n  - [Implement `Default` for `StateHandle`.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/260)\n\n- #### 📃 Documentation\n\n  - [Update docs to use boolean for disabled attribute on button.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/248)\n  - [Add documentation on topological dependency tracking.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/253)\n\n## ✨ **0.6.0** _(2021-09-12)_\n\nRelease post: https://sycamore-rs.netlify.app/news/announcing-v0.6.0\n\n- #### ⚡️ Features\n\n  - [Add integrations for `sycamore-router`.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/183)\n  - [Added `dangerously_set_inner_html` special attribute to html elements.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/190)\n    This allows directly setting an element's inner html without going through a `NodeRef` and\n    manually calling `.set_inner_html()`.\n  - [Implement `Portal`s.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/209) Portals allow adding\n    nodes to elements that are in another tree.\n  - [Allow instantiating components with the `Component` trait.](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/213)\n    You can now also create components that are generic over another component.

This introduces the concept of `GenericNode` which is a\n    trait to access the underlying rendering backend. Currently, Sycamore ships with `DomNode` and\n    `SsrNode` out-of-the-box for rendering the the browser DOM and to a static string respectively.\n    Components should now be generic over `G: GenericNode` to be able to render to multiple backends\n    [[@lights0123], [#67](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/pull/67)]\n  - Require using the `#[component(_)]` attribute macro for defining components. This changes the\n    component syntax to:\n    ```rust\n    #[component(MyComponent<G>)]\n    fn my_component() -> Template<G> {\n        todo!()\n    }\n    ```\n    The `#[component(_)]` macro generates a `struct` under the hood that implements the `Component`\n    trait for improved type safety. This also means that you no longer need\n    `#[allow(non_snake_case)]` in your code!

Everything is built on\n  [reactive primitives](https://sycamore.dev/book/introduction/adding-state) without a cumbersome\n  virtual DOM.\n- **No JavaScript**: Had enough of JavaScript? So have we. Create apps using Sycamore without\n  touching a single line of JS.\n\n## Documentation\n\nSycamore is extensively documented:\n\n- [The Book](https://sycamore.dev/book/introduction): The Sycamore \"Book\" will first help guide you\n  through basic concepts and create a simple app. It then dwelves into some more advanced topics\n  for building more complex apps.\n- [API Documentation](https://docs.rs/sycamore): the rustdocs for the `sycamore` crate.\n\n**Still have questions?** Don't hesitate to stop by our friendly\n[Discord server](https://discord.gg/vDwFUmm6mU).\n\n## Examples\n\nSycamore has many examples for your reference in the\n[`examples/`](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/tree/main/examples) directory. Be sure to\ncheck them out!\n\n### Viewing on `examples.sycamore.dev`\n\nAll the examples are hosted under `examples.sycamore.dev/<example_name>` with\n`<example_name>` being the name of the example you want to view. For instance, the `todomvc` example\nis hosted on\n[`examples.sycamore.dev/todomvc`](https://examples.sycamore.dev/todomvc).\n\n### Building Locally\n\nAll the examples can also be built locally using [Trunk](https://trunkrs.dev). For instance, the\nfollowing command builds and serves the `todomvc` example:\n\n```bash\ncd examples/todomvc\ntrunk serve\n```\n\nNow open up <http://localhost:8080> in your browser to see the example running in action.\n\n## Alternatives?\n\nDon't think Sycamore is for you? Thankfully, there are plenty of alternatives!\n\n- **[SolidJS](https://github.com/solidjs/solid): A declarative, efficient and flexible JavaScript\n  library for building user interfaces** <br /> Solid is a JavaScript library which greatly inspired\n  Sycamore. Many concepts such as fine-grained reactivity and components as factory functions were\n  borrowed from Solid. If you don't mind working with JavaScript (or TypeScript), go check it out!\n- **[Leptos](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos): Build fast web applications with Rust.** <br />\n  Leptos is another Rust library based on the fine-grained reactivity paradigm. Leptos shares many\n  similarities with Sycamore and, as of now, has a larger community.\n- **[Dioxus](https://github.com/dioxuslabs/dioxus): Fullstack app framework for web, desktop, mobile,\n  and more.** <br /> Dioxus uses a VDOM instead of fine-grained reactivity for updating the DOM, although\n  it uses fine-grained reactivity for state management. This allows Dioxus to target a wide variety of\n  platforms including native and mobile.\n\n## Contributing\n\n- Report issues on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/issues).\n- We love Pull Requests! For more information, check out the\n  [section on contributing](https://sycamore.dev/book/contributing) in the docs.\n\nSycamore would not have been possible without the wonderful contributions from the community. Thank\nyou!\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore/graphs/contributors\">\n  <img src=\"https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=sycamore-rs/sycamore\" />\n</a>\n\nSpecial thanks to [@nate-sys](https://github.com/nate-sys) for designing the Sycamore logo!\n"
