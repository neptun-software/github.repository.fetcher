Tickets with issue reports of feature requests\n2. Documentation improvements\n3. Code (PR or PR Review)\n\nIn addition to submitting new PRs, we have a healthy tradition of community\nmembers helping review each other's PRs. Doing so is a great way to help the\ncommunity as well as get more familiar with Rust and the relevant codebases.\n\n## Finding and Creating Issues to Work On\n\nYou can find a curated [good-first-issue] list to help you get started.\n\nArrow-rs is an open contribution project, and thus there is no particular\nproject imposed deadline for completing any issue or any restriction on who can\nwork on an issue, nor how many people can work on an issue at the same time.\n\nContributors drive the project forward based on their own priorities and\ninterests and thus you are free to work on any issue that interests you.\n\nIf someone is already working on an issue that you want or need but hasn't\nbeen able to finish it yet, you should feel free to work on it as well. In\ngeneral it is both polite and will help avoid unnecessary duplication of work if\nyou leave a note on an issue when you start working on it.\n\nIf you want to work on an issue which is not already assigned to someone else\nand there are no comment indicating that someone is already working on that\nissue then you can assign the issue to yourself by submitting a single word\ncomment `take`. This will assign the issue to yourself. However, if you are\nunable to make progress you should unassign the issue by using the `unassign me`\nlink at the top of the issue page (and ask for help if are stuck) so that\nsomeone else can get involved in the work.\n\nIf you plan to work on a new feature that doesn't have an existing ticket, it is\na good idea to open a ticket to discuss the feature. Advanced discussion often\nhelps avoid wasted effort by determining early if the feature is a good fit for\nArrow-rs before too much time is invested. It also often helps to discuss your\nideas with the community to get feedback on implementation.\n\n[good-first-issue]: https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22\n\n## Developer's guide to Arrow Rust\n\n### Setting Up Your Build Environment\n\nInstall the Rust tool chain:\n\nhttps://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install\n\nAlso, make sure your Rust tool chain is up-to-date, because we always use the latest stable version of Rust to test this project.\n\n```bash\nrustup update stable\n```\n\n### How to compile\n\nThis is a standard cargo project with workspaces. To build it, you need to have `rust` and `cargo`:\n\n```bash\ncargo build\n```\n\nYou can also use rust's official docker image:\n\n```bash\ndocker run --rm -v $(pwd):/arrow-rs -it rust /bin/bash -c \"cd /arrow-rs && rustup component add rustfmt && cargo build\"\n```\n\nThe command above assumes that are in the root directory of the project, not in the same\ndirectory as this README.md.\n\nYou can also compile specific workspaces:\n\n```bash\ncd arrow && cargo build\n```\n\n### Git Submodules\n\nBefore running tests and examples, it is necessary to set up the local development environment.\n\nThe tests rely on test data that is contained in git submodules.\n\nTo pull down this data run the following:\n\n```bash\ngit submodule update --init\n```\n\nThis populates data in two git submodules:\n\n- `../parquet-testing/data` (sourced from https://github.com/apache/parquet-testing.git)\n- `../testing` (sourced from https://github.com/apache/arrow-testing)\n\nBy default, `cargo test` will look for these directories at their\nstandard location. The following environment variables can be used to override the location:\n\n```bash\n# Optionally specify a different location for test data\nexport PARQUET_TEST_DATA=$(cd ../parquet-testing/data; pwd)\nexport ARROW_TEST_DATA=$(cd ../testing/data; pwd)\n```\n\nFrom here on, this is a pure Rust project and `cargo` can be used to run tests, benchmarks, docs and examples as usual.\n\n## Running the tests\n\nRun tests using the Rust standard `cargo test` command:\n\n```bash\n# run all unit and integration tests\ncargo test\n\n# run tests for the arrow crate\ncargo test -p arrow\n```\n\nFor some changes, you may want to run additional tests. You can find up-to-date information on the current CI tests in [.github/workflows](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/tree/main/.github/workflows). Here are some examples of additional tests you may want to run:\n\n```bash\n# run tests for the parquet crate\ncargo test -p parquet\n\n# run arrow tests with all features enabled\ncargo test -p arrow --all-features\n\n# run the doc tests\ncargo test --doc\n```\n\n## Code Formatting\n\nOur CI uses `rustfmt` to check code formatting. Before submitting a\nPR be sure to run the following and check for lint issues:\n\n```bash\ncargo +stable fmt --all -- --check\n```\n\nNote that currently the above will not check all source files in the parquet crate. To check all\nparquet files run the following from the top-level `arrow-rs` directory:\n\n```bash\ncargo fmt -p parquet -- --check --config skip_children=true `find ./parquet -name \"*.rs\" \\! -name format.rs`\n```\n\n## Breaking Changes\n\nOur [release schedule] allows breaking API changes only in major releases.\nThis means that if your PR has a breaking API change, it should be marked as\n`api-change` and it will not be merged until development opens for the next\nmajor release. See [this ticket] for details.\n\n[release schedule]: README.md#release-versioning-and-schedule\n[this ticket]: https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/issues/5907\n\n## Clippy Lints\n\nWe use `clippy` for checking lints during development, and CI runs `clippy` checks.\n\nRun the following to check for `clippy` lints:\n\n```bash\n# run clippy with default settings\ncargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings\n\n```\n\nIf you use Visual Studio Code with the `rust-analyzer` plugin, you can enable `clippy` to run each time you save a file. See https://users.rust-lang.org/t/how-to-use-clippy-in-vs-code-with-rust-analyzer/41881.\n\nOne of the concerns with `clippy` is that it often produces a lot of false positives, or that some recommendations may hurt readability. We do not have a policy of which lints are ignored, but if you disagree with a `clippy` lint, you may disable the lint and briefly justify it.\n\nSearch for `allow(clippy::` in the codebase to identify lints that are ignored/allowed. We currently prefer ignoring lints on the lowest unit possible.\n\n- If you are introducing a line that returns a lint warning or error, you may disable the lint on that line.\n- If you have several lints on a function or module, you may disable the lint on the function or module.\n- If a lint is pervasive across multiple modules, you may disable it at the crate level.\n\n## Running Benchmarks\n\nRunning benchmarks are a good way to test the performance of a change. As benchmarks usually take a long time to run, we recommend running targeted tests instead of the full suite.\n\n```bash\n# run all benchmarks\ncargo bench\n\n# run arrow benchmarks\ncargo bench -p arrow\n\n# run benchmark for the parse_time function within the arrow-cast crate\ncargo bench -p arrow-cast --bench parse_time\n```\n\nTo set the baseline for your benchmarks, use the --save-baseline flag:\n\n```bash\ngit checkout main\n\ncargo bench --bench parse_time -- --save-baseline main\n\ngit checkout feature\n\ncargo bench --bench parse_time -- --baseline main\n```\n\n## Git Pre-Commit Hook\n\nWe can use [git pre-commit hook](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) to automate various kinds of git pre-commit checking/formatting.\n\nSuppose you are in the root directory of the project.\n\nFirst check if the file already exists:\n\n```bash\nls -l .git/hooks/pre-commit\n```\n\nIf the file already exists, to avoid mistakenly **overriding**, you MAY have to check\nthe link source or file content. Else if not exist, let's safely soft link [pre-commit.sh](pre-commit.sh) as file `.git/hooks/pre-commit`:\n\n```bash\nln -s  ../../pre-commit.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit\n```\n\nIf sometimes you want to commit without checking, just run `git commit` with `--no-verify`:\n\n```bash\ngit commit --no-verify -m \"... commit message ...\"\n```\n"

We release new major versions (with potentially\nbreaking API changes) at most once a quarter, and release incremental minor\nversions in the intervening months. See [this ticket] for more details.\n\nTo keep our maintenance burden down, we do regularly scheduled releases (major\nand minor) from the `main` branch. How we handle PRs with breaking API changes\nis described in the [contributing] guide.\n\n[contributing]: CONTRIBUTING.md#breaking-changes\n\nPlanned Release Schedule\n\n| Approximate Date | Version  | Notes                                      |\n| ---------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------ |\n| Nov 2024         | `53.3.0` | Minor, NO breaking API changes             |\n| Dec 2024         | `54.0.0` | Major, potentially breaking API changes    |\n| Jan 2025         | `53.4.0` | Minor, NO breaking API changes (`53` line) |\n| Jan 2025         | `54.1.0` | Minor, NO breaking API changes             |\n| Feb 2025         | `54.2.0` | Minor, NO breaking API changes             |\n| Mar 2025         | `55.0.0` | Major, potentially breaking API changes    |\n\n[this ticket]: https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/issues/5368\n[semantic versioning]: https://semver.org/\n\n### `object_store` crate\n\nThe [`object_store`] crate is released independently of the `arrow` and\n`parquet` crates and follows [Semantic Versioning]. We aim to release new\nversions approximately every 2 months.\n\n[`object_store`]: https://crates.io/crates/object_store\n\nPlanned Release Schedule\n\n| Approximate Date | Version  | Notes                                   |\n| ---------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------- |\n| Dec 2024         | `0.11.2` | Minor, NO breaking API changes          |\n| Feb 2025         | `0.12.0` | Major, potentially breaking API changes |\n\n### Deprecation Guidelines\n\nMinor releases may deprecate, but not remove APIs. Deprecating APIs allows\ndownstream Rust programs to still compile, but generate compiler warnings. This\ngives downstream crates time to migrate prior to API removal.\n\nTo deprecate an API:\n\n- Mark the API as deprecated using `#[deprecated]` and specify the exact arrow-rs version in which it was deprecated\n- Concisely describe the preferred API to help the user transition\n\nThe deprecated version is the next version which will be released (please\nconsult the list above). To mark the API as deprecated, use the\n`#[deprecated(since = \"...\", note = \"...\")]` attribute.\n\nFoe example\n\n```rust\n#[deprecated(since = \"51.0.0\", note = \"Use `date_part` instead\")]\n```\n\nIn general, deprecated APIs will remain in the codebase for at least two major releases after\nthey were deprecated (typically between 6 - 9 months later). For example, an API\ndeprecated in `51.3.0` can be removed in `54.0.0` (or later). Deprecated APIs\nmay be removed earlier or later than these guidelines at the discretion of the\nmaintainers.\n\n## Related Projects\n\nThere are several related crates in different repositories\n\n| Crate                    | Description                                 | Documentation                           |\n| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |\n| [`datafusion`]           | In-memory query engine with SQL support     | [(README)][datafusion-readme]           |\n| [`ballista`]             | Distributed query execution                 | [(README)][ballista-readme]             |\n| [`object_store_opendal`] | Use [`opendal`] as [`object_store`] backend | [(README)][object_store_opendal-readme] |\n| [`parquet_opendal`]      | Use [`opendal`] for [`parquet`] Arrow IO    | [(README)][parquet_opendal-readme]      |\n\n[`datafusion`]: https://crates.io/crates/datafusion\n[`ballista`]: https://crates.io/crates/ballista\n[`object_store_opendal`]: https://crates.io/crates/object_store_opendal\n[`opendal`]: https://crates.io/crates/opendal\n[object_store_opendal-readme]: https://github.com/apache/opendal/blob/main/integrations/object_store/README.md\n[`parquet_opendal`]: https://crates.io/crates/parquet_opendal\n[parquet_opendal-readme]: https://github.com/apache/opendal/blob/main/integrations/parquet/README.md\n\nCollectively, these crates support a wider array of functionality for analytic computations in Rust.\n\nFor example, you can write SQL queries or a `DataFrame` (using the\n[`datafusion`] crate) to read a parquet file (using the [`parquet`] crate),\nevaluate it in-memory using Arrow's columnar format (using the [`arrow`] crate),\nand send to another process (using the [`arrow-flight`] crate).\n\nGenerally speaking, the [`arrow`] crate offers functionality for using Arrow\narrays, and [`datafusion`] offers most operations typically found in SQL,\nincluding `join`s and window functions.\n\nYou can find more details about each crate in their respective READMEs.\n\n## Arrow Rust Community\n\nThe `dev@arrow.apache.org` mailing list serves as the core communication channel for the Arrow community. Instructions for signing up and links to the archives can be found on the [Arrow Community](https://arrow.apache.org/community/) page. All major announcements and communications happen there.\n\nThe Rust Arrow community also uses the official [ASF Slack](https://s.apache.org/slack-invite) for informal discussions and coordination. This is\na great place to meet other contributors and get guidance on where to contribute. Join us in the `#arrow-rust` channel and feel free to ask for an invite via:\n\n1. the `dev@arrow.apache.org` mailing list\n2. the [GitHub Discussions][discussions]\n3. the [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/YAb2TdazKQ)\n\nThe Rust implementation uses [GitHub issues][issues] as the system of record for new features and bug fixes and\nthis plays a critical role in the release process.\n\nFor design discussions we generally collaborate on Google documents and file a GitHub issue linking to the document.\n\nThere is more information in the [contributing] guide.\n\n[rust]: https://www.rust-lang.org/\n[arrow-readme]: arrow/README.md\n[contributing]: CONTRIBUTING.md\n[parquet-readme]: parquet/README.md\n[flight-readme]: arrow-flight/README.md\n[datafusion-readme]: https://github.com/apache/datafusion/blob/main/README.md\n[ballista-readme]: https://github.com/apache/datafusion-ballista/blob/main/README.md\n[objectstore-readme]: object_store/README.md\n[parquet-derive-readme]: parquet_derive/README.md\n[issues]: https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/issues\n[discussions]: https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/discussions\n"
