          "content": "# Reporting Bugs and Asking Questions\n\nBug reports and questions are always welcome, though before asking whether a\nfeature exists, please glance through the [Proptest\nbook](https://proptest-rs.github.io/proptest/intro.html) and try the search\nfeature built in to the [API\ndocs](https://docs.rs/proptest/latest/proptest/) to see if\nthey answer your question already.\n\nPlease include your rust version and proptest version in any reports. Also\ninclude your operating system if you think it is relevant.\n\n# Requesting New Features\n\nPlease be specific in feature requests and, as mentioned above, try to see\nwhether feature does not already exist before requesting it.\n\nThere are no hard rules as to what features will or will not be accepted â€”\nultimately, it depends on what the expected benefit is relative to the expected\nmaintenance burden. However, here are some general guidelines.\n\nThe following will usually be accepted as new features:\n\n- New widely-applicable utilities for generating values. The `proptest::sample`\n  module is an example of such an accepted feature.\n\n- Features which enable Proptest to be used in a context where it formerly was\n  not. `no_std` is an example.\n\n- Quality of life improvements, such as adding new forms for the macros or\n  adding convenience functions.\n\nThe following will usually _not_ be accepted as new features (but still might\nbe if there is a sufficiently compelling reason):\n\n- Direct integration with a third-party crate, in the sense of adding\n  strategies or `Abitrary` implementation for that crate's types.\n\n- Features which are too narrowly applicable. (Hypothetical example: a built-in\n  strategy to generate valid streams of x86 instructions.)\n\n- Features which are easier to mis-use than to use correctly, or which could\n  lead to misunderstanding of how proptest is supposed to be used. (Example:\n  adding a method directly on `Strategy` to generate values from it.)\n\nProptest is maintained on a volunteer basis. If your feature is large, consider\nimplementing it yourself as a pull request. (Feel free of course to open an\nissue first for guidance.)\n\n# Pull Requests\n\nPull requests which fix bugs or add features are welcome. Below are some\nguidelines to keep in mind.\n\n## Formatting\n\nCode is formatted with `rustfmt`. If you are using `rustup`, you can install it\nwith `rustup component add rustfmt`.\n\nOther files are wrapped to 80 columns where reasonably possible use Unix line\nendings. An exception is the `run-tests.bat` file which must use DOS line\nendings.\n\n## Copyright Headers\n\nAll source files start with the copyright header whose template is found at\n`proptest/src/file-preamble`.\n\nWhen creating a new source file, insert the template and fill it out with the\ncurrent year and \"The proptest developers\".\n\nWhen making non-trivial changes to an existing file, update the header to _add_\nthe current year (separated from the previous by a comma) if not already there,\nand change the name to \"The proptest developers\" if the current name is not\nthat. Use your best judgement for what \"non-trivial\" is.\n\nYou retain copyright for any code you add to proptest.\n\n## Updating the changelog\n\nIf you make a change which is observable to proptest users (i.e. almost\nanything other than documentation changes or test code), add a note to the\n`CHANGELOG.md` for the crate.\n\nIf there is not already an `## Unreleased` section at the top, create one.\nUnder the Unreleased version, add a bullet point describing the change to one\nof the following subsections (ordered as follows):\n\n- Breaking Changes\n- Deprecations\n- Bug Fixes\n- New Additions\n- Nightly-only Breakage\n- Other Notes\n\n## Development Notes\n\n### Rust Version\n\nIt is generally easiest to work on proptest with the current stable Rust\nversion. Do keep in mind though that proptest retains compatibility with an\nolder version of Rust; you can find this in `.travis.yml`. Your pull request\nwill automatically be checked against that Rust version so you don't need to\nworry about it too much unless that fails.\n\nYou need to use the latest nightly for the following:\n\n- Working on nightly-only proptest features, including `no_std` support.\n\n- Testing `proptest-derive`.\n\n### Coding\n\nWithin the `proptest` crate, you cannot refer to `std` outside of test code or\ncode which is gated around the `std` feature flag. Instead, `std` names must be\npulled from the `std_facade` module in Proptest.\n\n### Running Tests\n\nTo test the `proptest` crate, simply run `cargo test -p proptest`. If you are\nworking on something not in the default proptest feature set, refer to\n`.travis.yml` for examples of how to test those features.\n\nThe test code for `proptest` has not been updated to work on `no_std`. Since\n`no_std` does not add novel code, we currently only test that it compiles.\n\nTesting the `proptest-derive` crate currently requires nightly. Assuming you\nare using `rustup`, you can run its tests with\n`cargo +nightly test -p proptest-derive`. The tests can fail with mysterious\nerrors if the `proptest` crate was previously built with a different\nconfiguration or a different Rust version. If you get build failures that don't\nseem to make sense, try running `cargo clean` and then try again.\n\nTests for test case persistence are not run as part of `cargo test`. To run\nthem on Unix, run `./run-tests.sh` in `proptest/test-persistence-location`. To\nrun them on Windows, run `run-tests.bat` in\n`proptest\\test-persistence-location`.\n\n## Automated Pull Request Checks\n\nYour pull request will automatically be tested against a range of Rust versions\nand configurations, including both on Linux and Windows.\n\nGenerally, please try to address any failures of these tests yourself if you\nare able. There are however a couple classes of problems you do not need to\nconcern yourself with:\n\n- If a nightly-only feature has been broken by a change in the nightly\n  distribution of Rust, do not worry about fixing it in your PR (unless of\n  course that is the specific aim of your PR).\n\n- Certain tests are known to occasionally fail spuriously. This most commonly\n  happens on a time-sensitive test that can fail under the low-performance\n  Appveyor environment. Certain tests have also generated random data and then\n  made assertions about the results; these should all be deterministic now but\n  some may have been missed.\n"
