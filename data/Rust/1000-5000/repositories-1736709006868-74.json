Note that most of the following are checked during CI, so it is\nrecommended to run these checks locally before submitting a pull request.\n\n#### Rust\n\nTrippy is written in [`Rust`](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and requires the Rust toolchain to build and run.\nAs well as default components such as `cargo`, you will need `rustfmt` and `clippy` for code formatting and linting.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Trippy uses the `stable` toolchain.\n\nTo install `rustfmt` and `clippy`:\n\n```shell\nrustup component add rustfmt clippy\n```\n\nTo format the Rust code:\n\n```shell\ncargo fmt --all\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Trippy uses default settings for code formatting.\n\nTo lint the Rust code:\n\n```shell\ncargo clippy --workspace --all-features --tests -- -Dwarnings\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Clippy configuration is defined at the workspace level in the root `Cargo.toml` file.\n\n#### Cargo `deny`\n\nIf you add or update dependencies, you must run Cargo [`deny`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny) to ensure\nthat the licenses of the dependencies are acceptable.\n\n```shell\ncargo deny check --hide-inclusion-graph\n```\n\nThe allowed licenses are defined in the `deny.toml` file.\n\n#### Cargo `insta`\n\nIf you make changes that impact the command line interface arguments, manual pages or shell completions, you must update\nthe testing snapshots using Cargo [`insta`](https://insta.rs).\n\nAfter making your changes, run `cargo test` to generate the new snapshots followed by `cargo insta` to review and update\nthe snapshots.\n\n```shell\ncargo test && cargo insta review\n```\n\n#### Cargo `spelling`\n\nIf you make changes to code documentation, you must run Cargo [`spellcheck`](https://github.com/drahnr/cargo-spellcheck)\nto ensure they are free from misspellings and typos.\n\nTo check the spelling:\n\n```shell\ncargo spellcheck check\n```\n\nThe configuration for `spellcheck` is defined in the `.config/spellcheck.toml` file and the custom dictionary is defined\nin the `.config/trippy.dic` file.\n\n#### Cargo `msrv`\n\nIf you add or update dependencies, you should use the Cargo [msrv](https://github.com/foresterre/cargo-msrv) tool to\ncheck the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) to ensure that the new dependencies are compatible with the current\nMSRV.\n\nTo check the MSRV of the `trippy` crate:\n\n```shell\ncargo msrv verify --manifest-path crates/trippy/Cargo.toml-- cargo check\n```\n\n#### `dprint`\n\nThe [`dprint`](https://dprint.dev/) tool is needed to ensure consistent formatting of the non-Rust portions of the\ncodebase and docs.\n\nTo format the non-Rust code:\n\n```shell\ndprint fmt\n```\n\nThe configuration for `dprint` is defined in the `dprint.json` file.\n\n#### Docker\n\nIf you make changes to the `Dockerfile`, you should build the Docker image locally to ensure it builds correctly.\n\n```shell\ndocker build . -t trippy:dev\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> If you add new files that are required at build time then you must update the `Dockerfile` to include them explicitly.\n\n### Development process\n\nThis section describes the development process for Trippy.\n\n#### Conventional commits\n\nAll commit messages should follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format.\n\nThe commit message should be structured as follows:\n\n```text\n<type>[optional scope]: <description>\n```\n\nWhere `type` is one of the following:\n\n- `feat`: A new feature\n- `fix`: A bug fix\n- `chore`: Build process, dependency and version updates\n- `docs`: Documentation only changes\n- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)\n- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature\n- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests\n- `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies\n- `ci`: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts\n- `revert`: Reverts a previous commit\n\nThe `scope` is optional and, if given, should be the name of the crate being modified, currently one of `core`,\n`packet`, `dns`, `privilege`, `tui` or `trippy`.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Small do-one-things commits are preferred over large do-many-things commits. This makes changes easier to review and\n> revert if necessary. For example, if you are adding a new feature and fixing a bug, it is better to create two\n> separate commits.\n\n## Releases\n\nInstructions for releasing a new `0.xx.0` version of Trippy.\n\nMany distribution packages are managed by external maintainers, however the following are managed by the Trippy\nmaintainers:\n\n- GitHub Releases\n- Crates.io\n- Docker\n- Snapcraft\n- WinGet\n- Ubuntu PPA\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Check the MSRV (Minimum Supported Rust Version) in the `trippy` crate `Cargo.toml` is still correct.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The MSRV should typically be the version from around 1 year before the current date to maximise compatibility.\n\n- Update all dependencies to the latest SemVer compatible versions\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Some distributions may not support the latest versions of all dependencies, so be conservative with updates.\n\n- Record and add an `assets/0.xx.0/demo.gif` for the new version\n- Update the `README.md` with details of the features in the new version\n- Update the `CHANGELOG.md` for the new version\n- Update the `RELEASES.md` for the new version\n- Update the version to `0.xx.0` in `Cargo.toml`, `snap/snapcraft.yaml` & `ubuntu-ppa/release.sh`\n\n### Testing\n\nTrippy is tested extensively in CI on Linux, Windows and macOS for every pull request. However, it is recommended to\ntest the release binaries on all platforms before release.\n\n### GitHub Releases\n\n- Tag the release with the version number `0.xx.0` and push the tag to GitHub:\n\n```shell\ngit tag 0.xx.0\ngit push origin tag 0.xx.0\n```\n\nThis will trigger the GitHub Actions workflow to build the release binaries and publish them to the GitHub release page.\n\n- Edit GitHub release page and copy the relevant sections from `RELEASES.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`. Refer to previous\n  releases for the format.\n\n### Crates.io\n\n- Publish all crates to crates.io (in order):\n\n```shell\ncargo publish trippy-dns\ncargo publish trippy-packet\ncargo publish trippy-privilege\ncargo publish trippy-core\ncargo publish trippy-tui\ncargo publish trippy\n```\n\n### Docker\n\nFrom the repository root directory:\n\n```shell\ndocker build . -t fujiapple/trippy:0.xx.0 -t fujiapple/trippy:latest\ndocker push fujiapple/trippy:0.xx.0\ndocker push fujiapple/trippy:latest\n```\n\n### Snapcraft\n\n- Promote the first `0.xx.0` build to the `latest/stable` channel from the\n  Snapcraft [releases](https://snapcraft.io/trippy/releases) page\n\n### WinGet\n\n- Download the latest release Windows `zip` from\n  the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy/releases/latest)\n- Determine the SHA256 checksum of the release:\n\n```shell\nshasum -a 256 trippy-0.xx.0-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip\n```\n\n- Update the `winget` [fork](https://github.com/fujiapple852/winget-pkgs) to the latest upstream\n- Checkout the fork and create a branch called `fujiapple852-trippy-0.xx.0`\n- Go to the Trippy directory\n\n```shell\ncd winget-pkgs/manifests/f/FujiApple/Trippy\n```\n\n- Copy the previous `0.yy.0` directory to a new directory for the new `0.xx.0` version\n- Update the `PackageVersion`, `ReleaseDate` and update all paths to the new version\n- Update the `InstallerSha256` with the checksum from the previous step\n- Update the release notes from [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)\n- Commit the changes with message:\n\n```text\nupdate fujiapple852/trippy to 0.xx.0\n```\n\n- Push the branch to the fork and create a pull request against the upstream `winget-pkgs` repository\n\n### Ubuntu PPA\n\nSee the Ubuntu PPA [README.md](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy/blob/master/ubuntu-ppa/README.md)\n\n## Help wanted\n\nThere are several the issues tagged\nas [help wanted](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) in the\nGitHub issue tracker for which I would be especially grateful for assistance.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is distributed under the terms of the Apache License (Version 2.0).\n\nUnless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in time by you, as defined\nin the Apache-2.0 license, shall be licensed as above, without any additional terms or conditions.\n"

See also the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).\n\n# 0.12.2\n\n## Highlights\n\nThis maintenance release of Trippy fixes a bug introduced in 0.12.0 which causes a tracer panic if `--first-ttl` is\nset to be greater than one. The release also addresses a longstanding bug which causes `--dns-resolve-method resolv` to\nignore any value provided for `--addr-family` and therefore always use the default value of `ipv4`. Finally the help\ntext for `--addr-family` has been corrected.\n\nSee the main [0.12.0](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy/releases/tag/0.12.0) release note.\n\n# 0.12.1\n\n## Highlights\n\nThis maintenance release of Trippy fixes a bug which prevented translations from working in Docker and also divests all\ninternal use of `yaml` dependencies which were problematic to maintain on some platforms (thanks to @nc7s).\n\nSee the main [0.12.0](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy/releases/tag/0.12.0) release note.\n\n# 0.12.0\n\n## Highlights\n\nThe latest release of Trippy brings both cosmetic and functional improvements to the TUI, new columns, new distribution\npackages, and a number of bug fixes.\n\nThe TUI has been updated to include a new _information bar_ at the bottom of the screen which allows for the header to\nbe shortened and simplified. The sample history chart has been enhanced to highlight missing probes and the presentation\nof source and target addresses has also been simplified.\n\nAs well as these cosmetic changes, the TUI has gained support for internationalization (i18n) and the ability to\nadjust the hop privacy setting dynamically.\n\nThis release introduces three new columns, which provide novel heuristics for measuring _forward loss_ and _backward\nloss_, that are designed to assist users in interpreting the status of the trace.\n\nFinally, this update includes new distribution packages for Debian and Ubuntu and addresses a number of bugs.\n\n### TUI Information Bar\n\nThe TUI now includes an _information bar_ at the bottom of the screen, replacing the previous `Config` line in the\nheader. This change shortens the header by one line, optimizing space usage while keeping the overall vertical space of\nthe TUI unchanged.\n\nThe main TUI screen now appears as shown below (120x40 terminal size):\n\n<img width=\"60%\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fujiapple852/trippy/master/assets/0.12.0/main_screen.png\"/>\n\nThe left-hand side of the information bar displays a selection of static configuration items (in order):\n\n- The address family and tracing protocol, e.g., `IPv4/ICMP`\n- The privilege level, either `privileged` or `unprivileged`\n- The locale, e.g., English (`en`), French (`fr`), etc.\n\nThe right-hand side of the information bar displays a selection of adjustable configuration items (in order):\n\n- A toggle controlling whether `ASN` information is displayed (`□ ASN` for disabled, `■ ASN` for enabled)\n- A toggle controlling whether hop detail mode is enabled (`□ detail` for disabled, `■ detail` for enabled)\n- A toggle controlling whether hostnames, IP addresses, or both are displayed (`host`, `ip`, or `both`)\n- The maximum `ttl` value for hop privacy, shown as `-` (privacy disabled) or a number (0, 1, 2, etc.)\n- The maximum number of hosts displayed per hop, shown as `-` (automatic) or a number (1, 2, etc.)\n\nIn the above screenshot, the information bar indicates the trace is using `IPv4/ICMP`, is running in `privileged` mode,\nthe locale is English (`en`), `ASN` information is displayed, hop detail mode is disabled, hostnames are displayed, the\nhop privacy maximum `ttl` is 2, and the maximum number of hosts per hop is set to automatic.\n\n> **Note**: The information bar displays only a small number of important settings. All other settings can be viewed in\n> the settings dialog, which can be opened by pressing `s` (default key binding).\n\nThe theme colors of the information bar can be customized using the `info-bar-bg-color` and `info-bar-text-color` theme\nitems. Refer to the [Theme Reference](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy#theme-reference) for more details.\n\nThanks to @c-git for their valuable feedback in refining the design of the information bar.\n\nSee [#1349](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy/issues/1349) for details.\n\n### Sample History Missing Probes\n\nTrippy displays a history of samples for each hop as a chart at the bottom of the TUI display. Each vertical line in the\nchart corresponds to one sample, representing the value of the `Last` column.\n\nPreviously, if a probe was lost, the sample for that round would be shown as a blank vertical line. Starting with this\nrelease, Trippy now highlights lost probes using a full vertical line in red (default theme color), making them easier\nto identify.\n\n<img width=\"60%\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fujiapple852/trippy/master/assets/0.12.0/lost_probes.png\"/>\n\nThe theme color for regular samples can be configured using the existing `samples-chart-color` configuration option.\nAdditionally, the theme color for lost probes can now be customized using the new `samples-chart-lost-color`\nconfiguration option. For more details, see\nthe [Theme Reference](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy#theme-reference).\n\nSee [#1247](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy/issues/1247) for further details.\n\n### Source and Target Address Display Improvements\n\nThis release simplifies the display of the source and target addresses in the `Target` line in the header of the TUI.\n\nThe `Target` line has been updated such that, for both the source and destination addresses, the hostname is only shown\nif it differs from the IP address.\n\nFor the destination address:\n\n- If the user supplies a target hostname, it is resolved to an IP address, and both the IP address and the _provided_\n  hostname are shown.\n- If the user supplies an IP address, a reverse DNS hostname lookup is attempted. If successful, both the IP address and\n  the _first resolved_ hostname are shown; otherwise, only the IP address is displayed.\n\nFor the source address:\n\n- A reverse DNS hostname lookup is attempted. If successful, both the IP address and the _first resolved_ hostname are\n  shown; otherwise, only the IP address is displayed.\n\nFor example, when the user supplies an IP address as the tracing target, the `Target` line in the header is now shown as\nfollows:\n\n```\nTarget: 192.168.1.21 -> 93.184.215.14 (example.com)\n```\n\nSee [#1363](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy/issues/1363) for details.\n\n### Adjustable Hop Privacy Mode Settings\n\nTrippy includes a privacy feature designed to hide sensitive information, such as IP addresses and GeoIP data, for all\nhops up to a configurable maximum `ttl` via the `tui-privacy-max-ttl` configuration option.\n\nPreviously, the privacy feature could only be toggled on or off within the TUI using the `toggle-privacy` command and\nonly if `tui-privacy-max-ttl` was configured _before_ Trippy was started.\n\nIn this release, the `toggle-privacy` command has been deprecated and replaced by two new TUI commands,\n`expand-privacy` (bound to the `p` key by default) and `contract-privacy` (bound to the `o` key by default).\n\nThe `expand-privacy` command increases the `tui-privacy-max-ttl` value up to the maximum number of hops in the current\ntrace and the `contract-privacy` command decreases the `tui-privacy-max-ttl` value to the minimum value, which disables\nprivacy mode.\n\nSee [#1347](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy/issues/1347) for more details.\n\nThis release also repurposes the meaning of `tui-privacy-max-ttl` when set to `0`. Previously, a value of `0` indicated\nthat no hops should be hidden. Starting from this release, a value of `0` will indicate that the source of the trace, as\nshown in the `Target` line of the header, should be hidden.\n\nValues of `1` or greater retain their existing behavior but will now also hide the source of the trace in addition to\nthe specified number of hops.\n\nAs a result of this change, the default value for `tui-privacy-max-ttl` has been updated:\n\n- If not explicitly set (via a command-line argument or the configuration file), nothing will be hidden by default.\n- If explicitly set to `0` (the previous default), the source of the trace will be hidden.\n\nSee [#1365](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy/issues/1365) for details.\n\n### Preserve Screen on Exit\n\nTrippy previously supported the `--tui-preserve-screen` command-line flag, which could be used to prevent the terminal\nscreen from being cleared when Trippy exits. This feature is useful for users who wish to review trace results after\nexiting the application. However, the flag had to be set before starting Trippy and could not be toggled during a trace.\n\nThis release introduces the `quit-preserve-screen` TUI command (bound to the `shift+q` key by default). This command\nallows users to quit Trippy without clearing the terminal screen, regardless of whether the `--tui-preserve-screen` flag\nis set.\n\nSee [#1382](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy/issues/1382) for details.\n\n### TUI Internationalization (i18n)\n\nThe Trippy TUI has been translated into multiple languages. This includes all text displayed in the TUI across all\nscreens and dialogs, as well as GeoIP location data shown on the world map.\n\nThe TUI will automatically detect the system locale and use the corresponding translations if available. The locale can\nbe overridden using the `--tui-locale` configuration option.\n\nLocales can be specified for a language or a combination of language and region. For example a general locale can be\ncreated for English (`en`) and specific regional locales can be created, such as United Kingdom English (`en-UK`) and\nUnited States English (`en-US`).\n\nIf the user's chosen full locale (`language-region`) is not available, Trippy will fall back to using the locale for the\nlanguage only, if it exists. For example if the user sets the locale to `en-AU`, which is not currently defined in\nTrippy, it will fall back to the `en` locale, which is defined.\n\nIf the user's chosen locale does not exist at all, Trippy will fall back to English (`en`).\n\nLocales are generally added for the language only unless there is a specific need for region-based translations.\n\nSome caveats to be aware of:\n\n- The configuration file, command-line options, and most error messages are not translated.\n- Many common abbreviated technical terms, such as `IPv4` and `ASN`, are not translated.\n\nThe following example sets the TUI locale to be Chinese (`zh`):\n\n```shell\ntrip example.com --tui-locale zh\n```\n\nThis can be made permanent by setting the `tui-locale` value in the `tui` section of the configuration file:\n\n```toml\n[tui]\ntui-locale = \"zh\"\n```\n\nThe following screenshot shows the TUI with the locale set to Chinese (`zh`):\n\n<img width=\"60%\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fujiapple852/trippy/master/assets/0.12.0/help_screen_zh.png\"/>\n\nThe list of available locales can be printed using the `--print-locales` flag:\n\n```shell\ntrip --print-locales\n```\n\nAs of this release, the following locales are available:\n\n- Chinese (`zh`)\n- English (`en`)\n- French (`fr`)\n- German (`de`)\n- Italian (`it`)\n- Portuguese (`pt`)\n- Russian (`ru`)\n- Spanish (`es`)\n- Swedish (`sv`)\n- Turkish (`tr`)\n\nSee [#1319](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy/issues/1319), [#1357](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy/issues/1357), [#1336](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy/issues/1336)\nand the [Locale Reference](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy#locale-reference) for more details.\n\nCorrections to existing translations or the addition of new translations are always welcome. See\nthe [tracking issue](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy/issues/506) for the status of each translation and details\non how to contribute.\n\nAdding these translations has been a significant effort and I would like to express a huge _thank you_ (谢谢! Merci!\nDanke! Grazie! Obrigado! Спасибо! Gracias! Tack! Teşekkürler!) to @0323pin, @arda-guler, @histrio, @josueBarretogit,\n@one, @orhun, @peshay, @ricott1, @sxyazi, @ulissesf, and @zarkdav for all of their time and effort adding and reviewing\ntranslations for this release.\n\n### Forward and Backward Packet Loss Heuristics\n\nIn line with most classic traceroute tools, Trippy displays the number of probes sent (`Snd`), received (`Recv`), and a\nloss percentage (`Loss%`) for each hop. However, many routers are configured to rate-limit or even drop ICMP traffic.\nThis can lead to false positives for packet loss, particularly for intermediate hops, as the lack of a response from\nsuch hops does not typically indicate genuine packet loss. This is a common source of confusion for users interpreting\ntrace results.\n\nTrippy already provides a color-coded status column (`Sts`), that considers both packet loss percentage and whether the\nhop is the target of the trace, to try and assist users in interpreting the status of each hop. While this feature is\nhelpful, it does not make it clear _why_ a hop has a particular status nor help users interpret the overall status of\nthe trace.\n\nTo further assist users, this release of Trippy introduces a pair of novel heuristics to measure _forward loss_ and\n_backward loss_. Informally, _forward loss_ indicates whether the loss of a probe is the _cause_ of subsequent losses\nand _backward loss_ indicates whether the loss of a probe is the _result_ of a prior loss on the path.\n\nMore precisely:\n\n- _forward loss_ for probe `P` in round `R` occurs when probe `P` is lost in round `R` and _all_ subsequent probes\n  within round `R` are also lost.\n- _backward loss_ for probe `P` in round `R` occurs when probe `P` is lost in round `R` and _any_ prior probe within\n  round `R` has _forward loss_.\n\nThese heuristics are encoded in three new columns:\n\n- `Floss` (`F`): The number of probes with _forward loss_\n- `Bloss` (`B`): The number of probes with _backward loss_\n- `Floss%` (`D`): The percentage of probes with _forward loss_\n\nThese columns are hidden by default but can be enabled as needed. For more details, see\nthe [Column Reference](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy#column-reference).\n\nThe following screenshot shows an example trace with the new columns enabled:\n\n<img width=\"60%\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fujiapple852/trippy/master/assets/0.12.0/floss_bloss.png\"/>\n\nIn the following (contrived) example, after initially discovering the target (`10.0.0.105`) during the first round,\ngenuine packet loss occurs in _all_ subsequent rounds at the third hop. This means that no probes on the common path are\nable to get beyond the third hop.\n\n```\n╭Hops───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮\n│#    Host         Loss%    Snd     Recv    Floss   Bloss   Floss%  │\n│1    10.0.0.101   0.0%     96      96      0       0       0.0%    │\n│2    10.0.0.102   0.0%     96      96      0       0       0.0%    │\n│3    No response  100.0%   96      0       95      0       98.9%   │\n│4    No response  100.0%   96      0       0       95      0.0%    │\n│5    10.0.0.105   99.0%    96      1       0       95      0.0%    │\n```\n\nFrom this we can determine that the loss at the third hop is classified as _forward loss_ because all subsequent\nprobes (4th and 5th) in the same round are also lost. We can also conclude that the 4th and 5th hops have _backward\nloss_ starting from round two, as in those rounds a prior hop (the third hop) has _forward loss_.\n\nNote the difference between the traditional `Loss%` column and the new `Floss%` column. The `Loss%` column indicates\npacket loss at several hops (3rd, 4th, and 5th). In contrast, the `Floss%` column helps us determine that the true\npacket loss most likely occurs at the 3rd hop.\n\nIt is important to stress that this technique is a _heuristic_, and both _false positives_ and _false negatives_ are\npossible. Some specific caveats to be aware of include:\n\n- Every probe sent in every round is an _independent trial_, meaning there is no guarantee that all probes within a\n  given round will follow the same path (or \"flow\"). The concept of \"forward loss\" and \"backward loss\" assumes that all\n  probes followed a single path. This assumption is typically met (but not guaranteed) when using tracing strategies\n  such as ICMP, UDP/Dublin, or UDP/Paris.\n- Any given host on the path may drop packets for only a subset of probes sent within a round, either due to rate\n  limiting or genuine intermittent packet loss. This could result in a false positive for \"forward loss\" at a given hop\n  if all subsequent hops in the round exhibit packet loss that is not genuine. For example, in the scenario above, the\n  hop with `ttl=3` could be incorrectly deemed to have \"forward loss\" if observed loss from hops `ttl=4` and `ttl=5` is\n  not genuine (e.g., caused by rate-limiting).\n- A false positive for \"backward loss\" could occur at a hop experiencing genuine packet loss if a previous hop on the\n  path has \"forward loss\" that is not genuine. In the scenario above, if the hop with `ttl=4` has genuine packet loss,\n  it will still be marked with \"backward loss\" due to the \"forward loss\" at `ttl=3`.\n\nDespite these caveats, the addition of _forward loss_ and _backward loss_ heuristics aims to help users more accurately\ninterpret trace outputs. However, these heuristics should be considered experimental and may be subject to change in\nfuture releases.\n\nSee [#860](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy/issues/860) for details.\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\nThe previous release of Trippy introduced a bug ([#1290](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy/issues/1290)) that\ncaused reverse DNS lookups to be enqueued multiple times when the `dns-ttl` expired, potentially leading to the hostname\nbeing displayed as `Timeout: xxx` for a brief period.\n\nA long-standing bug ([#1398](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy/issues/1398)) which caused the TUI sample history\nand frequency charts to ignore sub-millisecond samples has been fixed.\n\nThis release fixes a bug ([#1287](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy/issues/1287)) that caused the tracer to panic\nwhen parsing certain ICMP extensions with malformed lengths.\n\nIt also resolves an issue ([#1289](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy/issues/1289)) where the ICMP extensions mode\nwas not being displayed in the TUI settings dialog.\n\nA bug ([#1375](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy/issues/1375)) that caused the cursor to not move to the bottom of\nthe screen when exiting while preserving the screen has also been fixed.\n\nFinally, this release fixes a bug ([#1327](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy/issues/1327)) that caused Trippy to\nincorrectly reject the value `ip` for the `tui-address-mode` configuration option (thanks to @c-git).\n\n### New Distribution Packages\n\nTrippy is now available in Debian 13 (`trixie`) and later (with thanks to @nc7s!).\n\n[![Debian 13 package](https://repology.org/badge/version-for-repo/debian_13/trippy.svg)](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/trippy)\n\n```shell\napt install trippy\n```\n\nSee ([#1312](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy/issues/1312)) for details.\n\nThe official Trippy PPA for Ubuntu is now also available for the `noble` distribution.\n\n[![Ubuntu PPA](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ubuntu%20PPA-0.12.0-brightgreen)](https://launchpad.net/~fujiapple/+archive/ubuntu/trippy/+packages)\n\n```shell\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:fujiapple/trippy\nsudo apt update && apt install trippy\n```\n\nSee ([#1308](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy/issues/1308)) for details.\n\nYou can find the full list of [distributions](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy/tree/master#distributions) in the\ndocumentation.\n\n### Thanks\n\nMy thanks to all Trippy contributors, package maintainers, translators and community members.\n\nFeel free to drop by the Trippy Zulip room for a chat:\n\n[![project chat](https://img.shields.io/badge/zulip-join_chat-brightgreen.svg)](https://trippy.zulipchat.com/)\n\nHappy Tracing!\n\n# 0.11.0\n\n## Highlights\n\nThis release of Trippy adds NAT detection for IPv4/UDP/Dublin tracing, a new public API, reverse DNS lookup cache\ntime-to-live, transient error handling for IPv4, a new ROFF manual page generator, several new columns, improved error\nmessages and a revamped help dialog with settings tab hotkeys.\n\nThere are two breaking changes, a new initial sequence number is used which impacts the default behavior of UDP tracing\nand two configuration fields have been renamed and moved.\n\nFinally, there are a handful of bug fixes and two new distribution packages, Chocolatey for Windows and an official PPA\nfor Ubuntu and Debian based distributions.\n\n### NAT Detection for IPv4/UDP/Dublin\n\nWhen tracing with the Dublin tracing strategy for IPv4/UDP, Trippy can now detect the presence of NAT (Network Address\nTranslation) devices on the path.\n\n[RFC 3022 section 4.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3022#section-4.3) requires that \"NAT to be completely\ntransparent to the host\" however in practice some fully compliant NAT devices leave behind a telltale sign that Trippy\ncan use.\n\nTrippy will indicate if a NAT device has been detected by adding `[NAT]` at the end of the hostname. There is also a\nnew (hidden by default) column, `Nat`, which can be enabled to show the NAT status per hop.\n\n<img width=\"60%\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fujiapple852/trippy/master/assets/0.11.0/nat_detection.png\"/>\n\nNAT devices are detected by observing a difference in the _expected_ and _actual_ checksum of the UDP packet that is\nreturned as the part of the Original Datagram in the ICMP Time Exceeded message. If they differ then it indicates that a\nNAT device has modified the packet. This happens because the NAT device must recalculate the UDP checksum after\nmodifying the packet (i.e. translating the source port) and so the checksum in the UDP packet that is nested in the ICMP\nerror may not, depending on the device, match the original checksum.\n\nTo help illustrate the technique, consider sending the following IPv4/UDP packet (note the UDP `Checksum B` here):\n\n```\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ │             \n|Version|  IHL  |Type of Service|          Total Length         | │

allows for the detection of NAT at the first hop. To detect multiple NAT devices along the path, Trippy\nmust also check for _changes_ in the observed checksum between consecutive hops, as changes to the UDP checksum will \"\ncarry forward\" to subsequent hops. This requires taking care to account for hops that do not respond. This is only\npossible when using the Dublin tracing strategy, as it does not modify the UDP header per probe; therefore, the\nchecksums are expected to remain constant, allowing changes in the checksum between hops to be detected.\n\nNote that this method cannot detect all types of NAT devices and so should be used in conjunction with other methods\nwhere possible.\n\nSee the [issue](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy/issues/1104) for more details.\n\n### Public API\n\nTrippy has been designed primarily as a standalone _tool_, however it is built on top of a number of useful libraries,\nsuch as the core tracer, DNS resolver and more. These libraries have always existed but were tightly integrated into the\ntool and were not designed for use by third party crates.\n\nThis release introduces the Trippy public API which can be used to build custom tools on top of the Trippy libraries.\n\nThe full set of libraries exposed is:\n\n| Crate                                                | Description                                          |\n| ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |\n| [trippy](https://docs.rs/trippy)                     | Common entrypoint crate                              |\n| [trippy-core](https://docs.rs/trippy-core)           | The core Trippy tracing functionality                |\n| [trippy-packet](https://docs.rs/trippy-packet)       | Packet wire formats and packet parsing functionality |\n| [trippy-dns](https://docs.rs/trippy-dns)             | Perform forward and reverse lazy DNS resolution      |\n| [trippy-privilege](https://docs.rs/trippy-privilege) | Discover platform privileges                         |\n| [trippy-tui](https://docs.rs/trippy-tui)             | The Trippy terminal user interface                   |\n\nTo use the Trippy public API you should add the common entrypoint `trippy` crate to your `Cargo.toml` file and then\nenable the desired features. Note that the `trippy` crate includes `tui` as a default feature and so you should disable\ndefault features when using it as a library. Alternatively, it is also possible to add the crates individually.\n\nFor example, to use the core Trippy tracing functionality you would add the `trippy` crate, disable default features and\nenable the `core` feature:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\ntrippy = { version = \"0.11.0\", default-features = false, features = [\"core\"] }\n```\n\nThe `hello-world` example below demonstrates how to use the Trippy public API to perform a simple trace and print the\nresults of each round:\n\n```rust\nuse std::str::FromStr;\nuse trippy::core::Builder;\n\nfn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {\n    let addr = std::net::IpAddr::from_str(\"1.1.1.1\")?;\n    Builder::new(addr)\n        .build()?\n        .run_with(|round| println!(\"{:?}\", round))?;\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\nWhilst Trippy adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), the public API is not yet considered stable and may\nchange in future releases.\n\nSee [crates](crates/README.md) and the usage [examples](examples/README.md) for more information.\n\n### New Initial Sequence\n\nFor UDP tracing, by default, Trippy uses a fixed source port and a variable destination port which is set from the\nsequence number, starting from an initial sequence of 33000 and incremented for each probe, eventually wrapping around.\n\nBy [convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers), many devices on the internet allow UDP\nprobes to ports in the range 33434..=33534 and will return a `DestinationUnreachable` ICMP error, which can be used to\nconfirm that the target has been reached. Since Trippy does not use destination ports in this range for UDP probes by\ndefault, the target host will typically not respond with an ICMP error, and so Trippy cannot know that the target was\nreached, and must therefore show the hop as unknown.\n\nAnother issue with this default setup is that the sequence number will eventually enter the range 33434..=33534 at which\npoint the target will _begin_ to respond with the `DestinationUnreachable` ICMP error. However, there is no guarantee\nthat the probe sent for sequence 33434 (i.e., the first one for which the target host will be able to respond) will be\nfor the minimum time-to-live (ttl) required to reach the target. This leads to confusing output, which is hard for users\nto interpret. See [issue](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy/issues/1203) for more details.\n\nThese issues can be avoided today, either by changing the initial sequence number to be in the range 33434..=33534 by\nsetting the `--initial-sequence` flag or by using a fixed destination port (and therefore a variable source port) in the\nsame range by setting the `--target-port` flag.\n\nIn the following example, the initial sequence number is set to 33434:\n\n```shell\ntrip example.com --udp --initial-sequence 33434\n```\n\nThis can be made permanent by setting the `initial-sequence` value in the `strategy` section of the configuration file:\n\n```toml\n[strategy]\ninitial-sequence = 33434\n```\n\nIn the following example, the destination port is set to 33434:\n\n```shell\ntrip example.com --udp --target-port 33434\n```\n\nThis can be made permanent by setting the `target-port` value in the `strategy` section of the configuration file:\n\n```toml\n[strategy]\ntarget-port = 33434\n```\n\nAs the default behavior in Trippy leads to these confusing issues, this release modifies the default sequence number to\nbe 33434. This is a **breaking change** and will impact users who rely on the old default initial sequence number.\n\nThis change introduces a new problem, albeit a lesser one: UDP traces will now begin with a destination port of 33434\nand so `DestinationUnreachable` ICMP errors will typically be returned by the target immediately. However, eventually\nthe sequence number will move _beyond_ the range 33434..=33534 and so the target host will _stop_ responding\nwith `DestinationUnreachable` ICMP errors. This leads to the appearance that the target has started dropping packets.\nWhile this is technically correct, this is not desirable behavior as the target has not really disappeared.\n\nIt is therefore recommended to _always_ fix the `target-port` to be in the range 33434..=33534 for UDP tracing and allow\nthe source port to vary instead. This may become the default behavior for UDP tracing in a future release; that would\nrepresent a significant difference in default behavior compared to most traditional Unix traceroute tools, which vary\nthe destination port by default.\n\n### Reverse DNS Lookup Cache Time-to-live\n\nTrippy performs a reverse DNS lookup for each host encountered during the trace and the resulting hostnames are cached\nindefinitely. This can lead to stale hostnames being displayed in the TUI if they change after the trace has begun.\n\nNote that the DNS cache can be flushed manually by pressing `ctrl+k` (default key binding) in the TUI.\n\nStarting from this release, the reverse DNS cache can be configured to expire after a certain time to live. By default\nthis is set to be 5 minutes (300 seconds) and can be configured using the `--dns-ttl` flag or the `dns-ttl`\nconfiguration option.\n\nThe following example sets the DNS cache time-to-live to 30 seconds:\n\n```shell\ntrip example.com --dns-ttl 30s\n```\n\nThis can be made permanent by setting the `dns-ttl` value in the `dns` section of the configuration file:\n\n```toml\n[dns]\ndns-ttl = \"30s\"\n```\n\n### Transient Error Handling for IPv4\n\nTrippy records the number of probes sent and the number of probes received for each hop and uses this information to\ncalculate packet loss. Any probe that is _successfully_ sent for which no response is received is considered lost.\n\nCurrently, if a probe cannot be sent for any reason, then Trippy will crash and show a BSOD. This is not typically an\nissue, as such failures imply a local issue with the host network configuration rather than an issue with the target or\nany intermediate hops.\n\nHowever, it is possible that a probe may fail to send for a transient reason, such as a temporary local host issue, and\nso it would be useful to be able to handle such errors gracefully. A common example would be running Trippy on a host\nand during the trace disabling the network interface.\n\nStarting from this release, Trippy will continue the trace even if a probe fails to send and will instead show a warning\nto the user in the TUI about the number of probe failures. A new column (hidden by default), `Fail`, has also been added\nto the TUI to show the number of probes that failed to send for each hop.\n\n<img width=\"60%\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fujiapple852/trippy/master/assets/0.11.0/fails.png\"/>\n\nThis has been implemented for macOS, Linux and Windows for IPv4 only. Support for IPv6 and other platforms will be added\nin future releases.\n\nSee the [tracking issue](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy/issues/1238) for more details.\n\n### Generate ROFF Man Page\n\nTrippy can now generate manual pages in ROFF format. This can be useful for users who wish to install Trippy on systems\nwhich do not have a package manager or for users who wish to install Trippy from source. It can also be used by package\nmaintainers to generate manual pages for their distribution.\n\nThe following command generates a ROFF manual page for Trippy:\n\n```shell\ntrip --generate-man > /path/to/man/pages/trip.1\n```\n\n### New Columns\n\nThis release introduced several new columns, all of which are hidden by default. These are:\n\n- `Type`: The ICMP packet type for the last probe for the hop\n- `Code`: The ICMP packet code for the last probe for the hop\n- `Nat`: The NAT detection status for the hop\n- `Fail`: The number of probes which failed to send for the hop\n\nThe following shows the `Type` and `Code` columns:\n\n<img width=\"60%\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fujiapple852/trippy/master/assets/0.11.0/type_code_columns.png\"/>\n\nSee the [Column Reference](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy#column-reference) for a full list of all available\ncolumns.\n\n### Settings Dialog Tab Hotkeys\n\nThe settings dialog can be accessed by pressing `s` (default key binding) and users can navigate between the tabs using\nthe left and right arrow keys (default key bindings). This release introduces hotkeys to allow users to jump directly to\na specific tab by pressing `1`-`7` (default key bindings).\n\nSee the [Key Bindings Reference](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy#key-bindings-reference) for details.\n\n### Help Dialog Revamped\n\nThe existing Trippy help dialog shows a hardcoded list of key bindings which may not reflect the actual key bindings the\nuser has configured. Trippy shows the correct key bindings in the settings dialog which can be accessed by\npressing `s` (default key binding) and navigating to the Bindings tab. Therefore, the key bindings in the help dialog\nare both potentially incorrect and redundant.\n\nThis release revamps the help dialog and includes instructions on how to access the key bindings from the settings\ndialog as well as some other useful information.\n\n<img width=\"60%\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fujiapple852/trippy/master/assets/0.11.0/new_help_dialog.png\"/>\n\n### Improved Error Messages\n\nError reporting has been improved for parameters such as `--min-round-duration` (`-i`). Previously, if an invalid\nduration was provided, the following error would be reported:\n\n```shell\n$ trip example.com -i 0.05\nError: invalid character at 1\n```\n\nStarting from this release, such error will instead be shown as:\n\n```shell\n$ trip example.com -i 0.05\nerror: invalid value '0.05' for '--min-round-duration <MIN_ROUND_DURATION>': expected time unit (i.e. 100ms, 2s, 1000us)\n\nFor more information, try '--help'.\n```\n\nThis covers all \"duration\" parameters, namely:\n\n- `min_round_duration`\n- `max_round_duration`\n- `grace_duration`\n- `read_timeout`\n- `dns_timeout`\n- `tui_refresh_rate`\n\n### Renamed Configuration\n\nThe following configuration fields have been renamed and moved from the `[tui]` to the `[strategy]` section in the\nconfiguration file:\n\n- `tui-max-samples` -> `max-samples`\n- `tui-max-flows` -> `max-flows`\n\nThis is a **breaking change**. Attempting to use the legacy field names will result in an error pointing to the new\nname.\n\nThe following example shows the error reported if the old names are used from the command line:\n\n```shell\nerror: unexpected argument '--tui-max-samples' found\n\n  tip: a similar argument exists: '--max-samples'\n```\n\nThe following examples shows the error reported if the ld names are used from the configuration file:\n\n```shell\nError: tui-max-samples in [tui] section is deprecated, use max-samples in [strategy] section instead\n```\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\nThis release fixes a bug where `DestinationUnreachable` ICMP errors were assumed to have been sent by the target host,\nwhereas they may also be sent by an intermediate hop.\n\nAnother fix addresses an issue where the TUI would calculate the maximum number of hops to display based on the maximum\nobserved across all rounds rather than for the latest round.\n\nFinally, a minor bug was fixed where `AddressInUse` and `AddrNotAvailable` errors were being conflated.\n\n### New Distribution Packages\n\nTrippy has been added to the Chocolatey community repository (with thanks to @Aurocosh!):\n\n[![Chocolatey package](https://repology.org/badge/version-for-repo/chocolatey/trippy.svg)](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/trippy)\n\n```shell\nchoco install trippy\n```\n\nTrippy also has an official PPA for Ubuntu and Debian based distributions (with thanks to @zarkdav!):\n\n[![Ubuntu PPA](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ubuntu%20PPA-0.11.0-brightgreen)](https://launchpad.net/~fujiapple/+archive/ubuntu/trippy/+packages)\n\n```shell\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:fujiapple/trippy\nsudo apt update && apt install trippy\n```\n\nYou can find the full list of [distributions](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy/tree/master#distributions) in the\ndocumentation.\n\n### Thanks\n\nMy thanks to all Trippy contributors, package maintainers and community members.\n\nFeel free to drop by the new Trippy Zulip room for a chat:\n\n[![project chat](https://img.shields.io/badge/zulip-join_chat-brightgreen.svg)](https://trippy.zulipchat.com/)\n\nHappy Tracing!\n\n# 0.10.0\n\n## Highlights\n\nThe first release of 2024 is packed with new features, such as customizable columns, jitter calculations, Dublin tracing\nstrategy for IPv6/UDP, support for IPinfo GeoIp files, enhanced DNS resolution with IPv6/IPv4 fallback and CSS named\ncolors for the TUI as well as a number of bug fixes. Since the last release there has also been a significant\nimprovement in automated testing, notably the introduction of TUN based simulation testing for IPv4.\n\n### Customize Columns\n\n#### Customize Columns in TUI\n\nIt is now possible to customize which columns are shown in the TUI and to adjust the order in which they are displayed.\nThis customization can be made from within the TUI or via configuration.\n\nTo customize the columns from the TUI you must open the settings dialog (`s` key) and navigating to the new `Columns`\ntab (left and right arrow keys). From this tab you can select the desired column (up and down arrow keys) and toggle the\ncolumn visibility on and off (`c` key) or move it left (`,` key) or right (`.` key) in the list of columns.\n\n<img width=\"60%\" alt=\"columns\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fujiapple852/trippy/master/assets/0.10.0/columns_settings.png\">\n\nYou can supply the full list of columns, in the desired order, using the new `--tui-custom-columns` command line\nargument. The following example specifies the standard list of columns in the default order:\n\n```shell\ntrip example.com --tui-custom-columns holsravbwdt\n```\n\nAlternatively, to make the changes permanent you may add the `tui-custom-columns` entry to the `tui` section of the\nTrippy configuration file:\n\n```toml\n[tui]\ntui-custom-columns = \"holsravbwdt\"\n```\n\nNote that the value of `tui-custom-columns` can be seen in the corresponding field of the `Tui` tab of the settings\ndialog and will reflect any changes made to the column order and visibility via the Tui. This can be useful as you may\ncopy this value and use it in the configuration file directly.\n\n<img width=\"60%\" alt=\"tui-custom-columns\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fujiapple852/trippy/master/assets/0.10.0/tui_settings.png\">\n\n#### New Columns\n\nThis release also introduced several new columns, all of which are hidden by default. These are:\n\n- Last source port: The source port for last probe for the hop\n- Last destination port: The destination port for last probe for the hop\n- Last sequence number: The sequence number for the last probe for the hop\n- Jitter columns: see the \"Calculate and Display Jitter\" section below\n\nSee the [Column Reference](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy#column-reference) for a full list of all available\ncolumns.\n\n#### Column Layout Improvement\n\nThe column layout algorithm used in the hop table has been improved to allow the maximum possible space for the `Host`\ncolumn. The width of the `Host` column is now calculated dynamically based on the terminal width and the set of columns\ncurrently configured.\n\n### Calculate and Display Jitter\n\nTrippy can now calculate and display a variety of measurements related to _jitter_ for each hop. Jitter is a measurement\nof the difference in round trip time between consecutive probes. Specifically, the following new calculated values are\navailable in Trippy `0.10.0`:\n\n- Jitter: The round-trip-time (RTT) difference between consecutive rounds for the hop\n- Average Jitter: The average jitter of all probes for the hop\n- Maximum Jitter: The maximum jitter of all probes for the hop\n- Inter-arrival Jitter: The smoothed jitter value of all probes for the hop\n\nThese values are always calculated and are included in the `json` report. These may also be displayed as columns in the\nTUI, however they are not shown by default. To enabled these columns in the TUI, please see\nthe [Column Reference](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy#column-reference).\n\n<img width=\"60%\" alt=\"jitter\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fujiapple852/trippy/master/assets/0.10.0/jitter_columns.png\">\n\n### Dublin Tracing Strategy for IPv6/UDP\n\nThe addition of support for the [dublin](https://github.com/insomniacslk/dublin-traceroute) tracing strategy for\nIPv6/UDP marks the completion of a multi-release journey to provide support for both Dublin\nand [paris](https://github.com/libparistraceroute/libparistraceroute/wiki/Checksum) tracing strategies for both IPv4/UDP\nand IPv6/UDP.\n\nAs a reminder, unlike classic traceroute and MTR, these alternative tracing strategies do not encode the probe sequence\nnumber in either the src or dest port of the UDP packet, but instead use other protocol and address family specific\ntechniques. Specifically, the Dublin tracing strategy for IPv6/UDP varies the length of the UDP payload for this\npurpose.\n\nBy doing so, these strategies are able to keep the src and dest ports fixed which makes it much more likely (though not\nguaranteed) that each round of tracing will follow the same path through the network (note that this is not true for the\nreturn path).\n\nThe following command runs an IPv6/UDP trace using the Dublin tracing strategy with fixed src and dest ports:\n\n```shell\ntrip example.com --udp -6 -R dublin -S 5000 -P 3500\n```\n\nNote that, for both Paris and Dublin tracing strategies, if you fix either the src or dest ports (but _not_ both) then\nTrippy will vary the unfixed port _per round_ rather than _per hop_. This has the effect that all probes _within_ a\nround will likely follow the same network path but probes _between_ round will follow different paths. This can be\nuseful in conjunction with flows (`f` key) to visualize the various paths packet flow through the network. See\nthis [issue](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy/issues/1007) for more details.\n\n<img width=\"60%\" alt=\"ipv6_dublin\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fujiapple852/trippy/master/assets/0.10.0/dublin_ipv6_src_dest_seq_columns.png\">\n\nWith UDP support for the Paris and Dublin tracing strategies now complete, what remains is adding support for these for\nthe TCP protocol. Refer to the [ECMP tracking issue](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy/issues/274) for details.\n\n### IPinfo GeoIp Provider\n\nTrippy currently supports the ability to lookup and display GeoIp information from MMDB files, but prior to `0.10.0`\nonly the [MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com) \"GeoLite2 City\" (and lite) MMDB files were supported. This release\nintroduces support for the \"IP to Country + ASN Database\" and \"IP to Geolocation Extended Database\" MMDB files\nfrom [IPinfo](https://ipinfo.io).\n\nThe \"IP to Country + ASN Database\" MMDB file provided by IPinfo can be used as follows:\n\n```shell\ntrip example.com --geoip-mmdb-file /path/to/country_asn.mmdb --tui-geoip-mode short\n```\n\nThese settings can be made permanent by setting the following values in the `tui` section of the configuration file:\n\n```toml\n[tui]\ngeoip-mmdb-file = \"/path/to/country_asn.mmdb\"\ntui-geoip-mode = \"short\"\n```\n\n### Enhanced DNS Resolution with IPv4/IPv6 Fallback\n\nWhen provided with a DNS name such as `example.com` Trippy tries to resolve it to an IPv4 or an IPv6 address and fails\nif no such IP exists for the configured `addr-family` mode, which must be either IPv4 or IPv6.\n\nStarting from version `0.10.0`, Trippy can be configured to support `ipv4-then-ipv6` and `ipv6-then-ipv4` modes\nfor `addr-family`. In the new `ipv4-then-ipv6` mode Trippy will first attempt to resolve the given hostname to an IPv4\naddress and, if no such address exists, it will attempt to resolve to an IPv6 address and only fail if neither are\navailable (and the opposite for the new `ipv6-then-ipv4` mode). The `addr-family` mode may also be set to be `ipv4`\nor `ipv6` for IPv4 only and IPv6 only respectively.\n\nTo set the `addr-family` to be IPv6 with fallback to IPv4 you can set the `--addr-family` command line parameter:\n\n```shell\ntrip example.com --addr-family ipv6-then-ipv4\n```\n\nTo make the change permanent you can set the `addr-family` value in the `strategy` section of the configuration file:\n\n```toml\n[strategy]\naddr-family = \"ipv6-then-ipv4\"\n```\n\nNote that Trippy supports both the `addr-family` entry in the configuration file and also the `--ipv4` (`-4`)\nand `--ipv6` (`-6`) command line flags, all of which are optional. The command line flags (which are mutually exclusive)\ntake precedence over the config file entry and if neither are provided there it defaults to `ipv4-then-ipv6`.\n\n### Extended Colors in TUI\n\nTrippy allows the theme to be customized and supports the\nnamed [ANSI colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Colors):\n\nBlack, Red, Green, Yellow, Blue, Magenta, Cyan, Gray, DarkGray, LightRed, LightGreen, LightYellow, LightBlue,\nLightMagenta, LightCyan, White\n\nThe `0.10.0` release adds support for CSS [named colors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/named-color) (\ne.g. SkyBlue). Note that these are only supported on some platforms and terminals and may not render correctly\nelsewhere.\n\nSee the [Theme Reference](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy#theme-reference)\n\n### Simulation Testing\n\nManually testing all Trippy features in all modes and on all supported platforms is an increasingly time consuming and\nerror prone activity. Since the last release a significant effort has been made to increase the testing coverage,\nincluding unit and integration testing.\n\nIn particular, the introduction of simulation testing allows for full end-to-end testing of all modes and features on\nLinux, macOS and Windows without the need to mock or stub any behaviour _within_ Trippy.\n\nThis is achieved by creating a [TUN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TUN/TAP) device to simulate the behavior of network\nnodes, responding to various pre-configured scenarios like packet loss and out-of-order arrivals.\n\nWhilst not a change that directly benefits end users, this new testing approach should reduce the effort needed to test\neach release of Trippy and help improve the overall reliability of the tool.\n\nNote that the simulation testing is currently only supported for IPv4. See\nthe [Integration Testing](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy/issues/759) tracking issue for more details.\n\n### Thanks\n\nMy thanks to all Trippy contributors, package maintainers and community members.\n\nFeel free to drop by the Trippy Matrix room for a chat:\n\n[![#trippy-dev:matrix.org](https://img.shields.io/badge/matrix/trippy-dev:matrix.org-blue)](https://matrix.to/#/#trippy-dev:matrix.org)\n\nHappy Tracing!\n\n# 0.9.0\n\n## Highlights\n\nTrippy `0.9.0` introduces many new features, including tracing flows and ICMP extensions, the expansion of support for\nthe Paris tracing strategy to encompass IPv6/UDP, an unprivileged execution mode for macOS, a hop privacy mode and many\nmore. Additionally, this release includes several important bug fixes along with a range of new distribution packages.\n\n### Tracing Flows\n\n#### Flow ID\n\nA tracing flow represents the sequence of hosts traversed from the source to the target. Trippy is now able to identify\nindividual flows within a trace and assign each a unique flow id. Trippy calculate a flow id for each round of tracing,\nbased on the sequence of hosts which responded during that round, taking care to account for rounds in which only a\nsubset of hosts responded. Tracing statistics, such as packet loss % and average RTT are recorded on a per-flow basis as\nwell as being aggregated across all flow.\n\nTracing flows adds to the existing capabilities provided by Trippy to assist\nwith [ECMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-cost_multi-path_routing) (Equal-Cost Multi-Path Routing) when tracing\nwith UDP and TCP protocols. Some of these capabilities, such as\nthe [paris](https://github.com/libparistraceroute/libparistraceroute/wiki/Checksum)\nand [dublin](https://github.com/insomniacslk/dublin-traceroute) tracing strategies, are designed to _restrict_ tracing\nto a single flow, whilst others, such as the hop detail navigation mode (introduce in the last release) and tracing\nflows, are designed to help _visualize_ tracing data in the presence of multiple flows. See\nthe `0.8.0` [release note](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy/releases/tag/0.8.0) for other such capabilities.\n\n#### Tracing Flows in the TUI\n\nThe TUI has been enhanced with a new mode to help visualise flows. This can be toggled on and off with\nthe `toggle-flows` command (bound to the `f` key by default).\n\nWhen toggled on, this mode display flow information as a chart in a new panel above the hops table. Flows can be\nselected by using the left and right arrow keys (default key bindings). Flows are sorted by the number of rounds in\nwhich a given flow id was observed, with the most frequent flow ids shown on the left. When entering this mode flow id 1\nis selected automatically. The selected flow acts as a filter for the other parts of the TUI, including the hops table,\nchart and maps views which only show data relevant to that specific flow.\n\n<img width=\"60%\" alt=\"flows\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fujiapple852/trippy/master/assets/0.9.0/flows.png\">\n\nWhen toggled off, Trippy behaves as it did in previous versions where aggregated statistics (across all flows) are\nshown. Note that per-flow data is always recorded, the toggle only influences how the data is displayed.\n\nThe number of flows visible in the TUI is limited and can be controlled by the `tui-max-flows` configuration items which\ncan be set via the command line or via the configuration file. By default up to 64 flows are shown.\n\nThe flows panel, as with all other parts of the TUI, can also be themed, see\nthe [theme reference](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy#theme-reference) for details.\n\n#### Flow Reports\n\nAs well as visualising flows in the TUI, Trippy `0.9.0` introduces two new reports which make use of the tracing flow\ndata.\n\nThe new `flows` report mode records and print all flows observed during tracing.\n\nThe following command will run a TCP trace for 10 round and report all of the flows observed:\n\n```shell\ntrip example.com --tcp -m flows -C 10\n```\n\nSample output (truncated) showing three unique flows:\n\n```text\nflow 1: 192.168.1.1, 10.193.232.245, 218.102.40.38, 10.195.41.9, 172.217.27.14\nflow 2: 192.168.1.1, 10.193.232.245, 218.102.40.22, 10.195.41.17, 172.217.27.14\nflow 3: 192.168.1.1, 10.193.232.245, 218.102.40.38, 10.195.41.1, 172.217.27.14\n```\n\nAnother new report, `dot`, outputs a [GraphViz](https://graphviz.org/) [`DOT`](https://graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html)\nformat chart of all hosts observed during tracing.\n\nThe following command will run a TCP trace for 10 round and output a graph of flows in `DOT` format:\n\n```shell\ntrip example.com --tcp -m dot -C 10\n```\n\nIf you have a tool such as `dot` (Graphviz) installed you can use this to rendered the output in various formats, such\nas PNG:\n\n```shell\ntrip example.com --tcp -m dot -C 10 | dot -Tpng > path.png\n```\n\nSample output:\n\n<img width=\"60%\" alt=\"dot\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fujiapple852/trippy/master/assets/0.9.0/dot.png\">\n\n### ICMP Extensions\n\n#### Parsing Extensions\n\nTrippy `0.9.0` adds the ability to parse and display ICMP Multi-Part Messages (aka extensions). It supports both\ncompliant and non-compliant ICMP extensions as defined\nin [section 5 of rfc4884](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4884#section-5).\n\nTrippy is able to parse and render any generic Extension Object but is also able to parse some well known Object\nClasses, notably the MPLS class.\n\nSupport\nfor [additional classes](https://www.iana.org/assignments/icmp-parameters/icmp-parameters.xml#icmp-parameters-ext-classes)\nwill be added to future versions of Trippy, see the ICMP\nExtensions [tracking issue](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy/issues/33).\n\nParsing of ICMP extensions can be enabled by setting the `--icmp-extensions` (`-e`) command line flag or by adding\nthe `icmp-extensions` entry in the `strategy` section of the configuration file:\n\n```toml\n[strategy]\nicmp-extensions = true\n```\n\n#### ICMP Extensions in the TUI\n\nThe TUI has been enhanced to display ICMP extensions in both the normal and hop detail navigation modes.\n\nIn normal mode, ICMP extensions are not shown by default but can be enabled by setting the `--tui-icmp-extension-mode`\ncommand line flag or by adding the `tui-icmp-extension-mode` entry in the `tui` section of the configuration file:\n\n```toml\n[tui]\ntui-icmp-extension-mode = \"full\"\n```\n\nThis can be set to `off` (do not show ICMP extension data), `mpls` (shows a list of MPLS label(s) per hop), `full` (\nshows all details of all extensions, such as `ttl`, `exp` and `bos` for MPLS) or `all` (the same as `full` but also\nshows `class`, `subtype` and `bytes` for unknown extension objects).\n\nThe following screenshot shows ICMP extensions in normal mode with `tui-icmp-extension-mode` set to be `mpls`:\n\n<img width=\"60%\" alt=\"extensions\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fujiapple852/trippy/master/assets/0.9.0/extensions.png\">\n\nIn hop detail mode, the full details of all ICMP extension objects are always shown if parsing of ICMP extensions is\nenabled.\n\nThe following screenshot shows ICMP extensions in hop detail mode:\n\n<img width=\"60%\" alt=\"extensions_detail\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fujiapple852/trippy/master/assets/0.9.0/extensions_detail.png\">\n\n#### ICMP Extensions in Reports\n\nICMP extension information is also included the `json` and `stream` report modes.\n\nSample output for a single hop from the `json` report:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ttl\": 14,\n  \"hosts\": [\n    {\n      \"ip\": \"129.250.3.125\",\n      \"hostname\": \"ae-4.r25.sttlwa01.us.bb.gin.ntt.net\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"extensions\": [\n    {\n      \"mpls\": {\n        \"members\": [\n          {\n            \"label\": 91106,\n            \"exp\": 0,\n            \"bos\": 1,\n            \"ttl\": 1\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"loss_pct\": \"0.00\",\n  \"sent\": 1,\n  \"last\": \"178.16\",\n  \"recv\": 1,\n  \"avg\": \"178.16\",\n  \"best\": \"178.16\",\n  \"worst\": \"178.16\",\n  \"stddev\": \"0.00\"\n}\n```\n\n### Paris Tracing Strategy for IPv6/UDP\n\nThe work to support the remaining [paris](https://github.com/libparistraceroute/libparistraceroute/wiki/Checksum)\nand [dublin](https://github.com/insomniacslk/dublin-traceroute) tracing modes continues in this release with the\naddition of support for the Paris tracing strategy for IPv6/UDP.\n\nAs a reminder, unlike classic traceroute and MTR, these alternative tracing strategies do not encode the probe sequence\nnumber in either the src or dest port of the UDP or TCP packet, but instead use other protocol and address family\nspecific techniques. Specifically, the Paris tracing strategy for IPv6/UDP utilizes the UDP checksum for this purposes\nand manipulates the UDP payload to ensure packets remind valid.\n\nBy doing so, these strategies are able to keep the src and dest ports fixed which makes it much more likely (though not\nguaranteed) that each round of tracing will follow the same path through the network (note that this is _not_ true for\nthe return path).\n\nThe following command runs a IPv6/UDP trace using the `paris` tracing strategy with fixed src and dest ports:\n\n```shell\ntrip example.com --udp -6 -R paris -S 5000 -P 3500\n```\n\nRefer to the [tracking issue](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy/issues/274) for details of the work remaining to\nsupport all ECMP strategies for both UDP and TCP for IPv4 and IPv6.\n\n### Unprivileged Mode\n\nTrippy normally requires elevated privileges due to the use of raw sockets. Enabling the required privileges for a given\nplatform can be achieved in several ways as in described\nthe [privileges](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy#privileges) section of the documentation.\n\nThis release of Trippy adds the ability to run _without_ elevated privileged on a subset of platforms, but with some\nlimitations which are described below.\n\nThe unprivileged mode can be enabled by adding the `--unprivileged` (`-u`) command line flag or by adding\nthe `unprivileged` entry in the `trippy` section of the configuration file:\n\n```toml\n[trippy]\nunprivileged = true\n```\n\nThe following command runs a trace in unprivileged mode:\n\n```shell\ntrip example.com -u\n```\n\nUnprivileged mode is currently only supported on macOS. Linux support is possible and may be added in the future.\nUnprivileged mode is not supported on NetBSD, OpenBSD, FreeBSD or Windows as these platforms do not support\nthe `IPPROTO_ICMP` socket type.\n\nUnprivileged mode does not support the `paris` or `dublin` tracing strategies as these require raw sockets in order to\nmanipulate the UDP and IP header respectively.\n\nSee [#101](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy/issues/101) for further information.\n\n### Resolve All DNS\n\nTrippy can be provided with either an IP address or a hostname as the target for tracing. Trippy will resolve hostnames\nto IP addresses via DNS lookup (using the configured DNS resolver, see the existing `--dns-resolve-method` flag) and\npick an arbitrary IP address from those returned.\n\nTrippy also has the ability to trace to several targets simultaneously (for the ICMP protocol only) and can be provided\nwith a list of IP addresses and hostnames.\n\nTrippy `0.9.0` combined these features and introduces a convenience flag `--dns-resolve-all` which resolves a given\nhostname to all IP addresses and will begin to trace to all of them simultaneously.\n\n<img width=\"60%\" alt=\"dns_resolve_all\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fujiapple852/trippy/master/assets/0.9.0/dns_resolve_all.png\">\n\n### Hop Privacy\n\nAt times it is desirable to share tracing information with others to help with diagnostics of a network problem. These\ntraces can contain sensitive information, such as IP addresses, hostnames and GeoIp details of the internet facing hops.\nUsers often wish to avoid exposing this data and are forced to redact the tracing output or screenshots.\n\nTrippy `0.9.0` adds a new privacy feature, which hides all sensitive information for a configurable number of hops in\nthe hops table, chart and GeoIP world map.\n\nThe following screenshot shows the world map view with the sensitive information of some hops hidden:\n\n<img width=\"60%\" alt=\"privacy\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fujiapple852/trippy/master/assets/0.9.0/privacy.png\">\n\nThe following command will hide all sensitive information for the first 3 hops (ttl 1, 2 & 3) in the TUI:\n\n```shell\ntrip example.com --tui-privacy-max-ttl 3\n```\n\nThis can also be made the default behaviour by setting the value in the Trippy configuration file:\n\n```toml\n[tui]\ntui-privacy-max-ttl = 3\n```\n\nFrom within the TUI the privacy mode can be toggled on and off using the `toggle-privacy` TUI command (bound to the `p`\nkey by default).\n\nNote the toggle is only available if `tui-privacy-max-ttl` is configured to be non-zero. Privacy mode is entered\nautomatically on startup to avoid any accidental exposure of sensitive data, such as when sharing a screen.\n\n### Print Config Template\n\nThe `0.8.0` release of Trippy introduced\na [configuration file](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy#configuration-reference) and provided a sample\nconfiguration file you could download. This release adds a command which generates a configuration template appropriate\nfor the specific version of Trippy.\n\nThe following command generates a `trippy.toml` configuration file with all possible configuration options specified and\nset to their default values:\n\n```shell\ntrip --print-config-template > trippy.toml\n```\n\n### Alternative Help Key Binding\n\nCan't decide whether you want to use `h` or `?` to display help information? Well fear not, Trippy now supports\nan `toggle-help-alt` TUI command (bound to the `?` key by default) in additional to the existing `toggle-help` TUI\ncommand (bound to the `h` key by default).\n\n### Improvements to Reports\n\nThis release fixes a bug that prevented reverse DNS lookup from working in all reporting modes.\n\nThe list of IPs associated with a given hop have also been added to the `csv` and all tabular reports. ICMP extension\ndata has also been included in several reports.\n\nNote that these are breaking change as the output of the reports has changed.\n\n### New Binary Asset Downloads\n\nThe list of operating systems, CPU architectures and environments which have pre-build binary assets available for\ndownload has been greatly expanded for the `0.9.0` release.\n\nThis includes assets for Linux, macOS, Windows, NetBSD and FreeBSD. Assets are available for `x86_64`, `aarch64`\nand `arm7` and includes builds for various environments such as `gnu` and `musl` where appropriate. There are also\npre-build `RPM` and `deb` downloads available. See\nthe [Binary Asset Download](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy#binary-asset-download) section for a full list.\n\nNote that Trippy `0.9.0` has only been [tested](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy/issues/836) on a small subset of\nthese platforms.\n\n### New Distribution Packages\n\nSince the last release Trippy has been added as an official WinGet package (kudos to @mdanish-kh and\n@BrandonWanHuanSheng!) and can be installed as follows:\n\n```shell\nwinget install trippy\n```\n\nTrippy has also been added to the scoop `Main` bucket (thanks to @StarsbySea!) and can be installed as follows:\n\n```shell\nscoop install trippy\n```\n\nYou can find the full list of [distributions](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy/tree/master#distributions) in the\ndocumentation.\n\n### Thanks\n\nMy thanks to all Trippy contributors, package maintainers and community members.\n\nFeel free to drop by the Trippy Matrix room for a chat:\n\n[![#trippy-dev:matrix.org](https://img.shields.io/badge/matrix/trippy-dev:matrix.org-blue)](https://matrix.to/#/#trippy-dev:matrix.org)\n\nHappy Tracing!\n\n## New Contributors\n\n- @c-git made their first contribution in https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy/pull/632\n- @trkelly23 made their first contribution in https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy/pull/788\n\n# 0.8.0\n\n## Highlights\n\nThe `0.8.0` release of Trippy brings several new features, UX enhancements, and quality of life improvements, as well as\nvarious small fixes and other minor improvements.\n\n#### Hop Detail Navigation\n\nTrippy offers various mechanisms to visualize [ECMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-cost_multi-path_routing) (\nEqual-Cost Multi-Path Routing) when tracing with UDP and TCP protocols. Features include displaying all hosts for a\ngiven hop in a scrollable table, limiting the number of hosts shown per hop (showing the % of traffic for each host),\nand greying out hops that are not part of a specific tracing round.\n\nDespite these helpful features, visualizing a complete trace can be challenging when there are numerous hosts for some\nhops, which is common in environments where ECMP is heavily utilized.\n\nThis release enhances ECMP visualization support by introducing a hop detail navigation mode, which can be toggled on\nand off by pressing `d` (default key binding). This mode displays multiline information for the selected hop only,\nincluding IP, hostname, AS, and GeoIP details about a single host for the hop. Users can navigate forward and backward\nbetween hosts in a given hop by pressing `,` and `.` (default key bindings), respectively.\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fujiapple852/trippy/master/assets/0.8.0/hop_details.png\" width=\"60%\">\n\nIn addition to visualizing ECMP, Trippy also supports alternative tracing strategies to assist with ECMP routing, which\nare described below.\n\n#### Paris Tracing Strategy\n\nTrippy already supports both classic and [dublin](https://github.com/insomniacslk/dublin-traceroute) tracing strategies,\nand this release adds support for the [paris](https://github.com/libparistraceroute/libparistraceroute/wiki/Checksum)\ntracing strategy for the UDP protocol.\n\nUnlike classic traceroute and MTR, these alternative tracing strategies do not encode the probe sequence number in\neither the src or dest port of the UDP or TCP packet, but instead use other protocol and address family specific\ntechniques.\n\nThis means that every probe in a trace can share common values for the src & dest hosts and ports which, when combined\nwith the protocol, is typically what is used to making traffic route decisions in ECMP routing. This means that these\nalternative tracing strategies significantly increase the likelihood that the same path is followed for each probe in a\ntrace (but not the return path!) in the presence of ECMP routing.\n\nThe following command runs a UDP trace using the new `paris` tracing strategy with fixed src and dest ports (the src and\ndest hosts and the protocol are always fixed) and will therefore likely follow a common path for each probe in the\ntrace:\n\n```shell\ntrip www.example.com --udp -R paris -S 5000 -P 3500\n```\n\nFuture Trippy versions will build upon these strategies and further improve the ability to control and visualize ECMP\nrouting, refer to the [tracking issue](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy/issues/274) for further details.\n\n#### GeoIp Information & Interactive Map\n\nTrippy now supports the ability to look up and display GeoIP information from a user-provided\nMaxMind [GeoLite2 City database](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geolite2-free-geolocation-data). This information is\ndisplayed per host in the hop table (for both normal and new detail navigation modes) and can be shown in various\nformats. For example, short form like \"San Jose, CA, US\" or long form like \"San Jose, California, United States, North\nAmerica,\" or latitude, longitude, and accuracy radius like \"37.3512, -121.8846 (~20km)\".\n\nThe following command enables GeoIP lookup from the provided `GeoLite2-City.mmdb` file and will show long form locations\nin the hop table:\n\n```shell\ntrip example.com --geoip-mmdb-file GeoLite2-City.mmdb --tui-geoip-mode long\n```\n\nAdditionally, Trippy features a new interactive map screen that can be toggled on and off by pressing `m` (default key\nbinding). This screen displays a world map and plots the location of all hosts for all hops in the current trace, as\nwell as highlighting the location of the selected hop.\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fujiapple852/trippy/master/assets/0.8.0/world_map.png\" width=\"60%\">\n\n#### Autonomous System Display Enhancements\n\nTrippy has long offered the ability to look up and display AS information. This release makes this feature more flexible\nby allowing different AS details to be shown in the hops table, including AS number, AS name, prefix CIDR, and registry\ndetails.\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fujiapple852/trippy/master/assets/0.8.0/as_info.png\" width=\"60%\">\n\nThe following command enables AS lookup and will display the prefix CIDR for each host in the TUI:\n\n```shell\ntrip example.com -z true -r resolv --tui-as-mode prefix\n```\n\nThis release also fixes a limitation in earlier versions of Trippy that prevented the lookup of AS information for IP\naddresses without a corresponding `PTR` DNS record.\n\n#### UI Cleanup & Configuration Dialog\n\nThe number of configurable parameters in Trippy has grown significantly, surpassing the number that can be comfortably\ndisplayed in the TUI header section. Previous Trippy versions displayed an arbitrarily chosen subset of these\nparameters, many of which have limited value for users and consume valuable screen space.\n\nThis release introduces a new interactive settings dialog that can be toggled on and off with `s` (default key binding)\nto display all configured parameters. The TUI header has also been cleaned up to show only the most relevant\ninformation, specifically the protocol and address family, the AS info toggle, the hop details toggle, and the max-hosts\nsetting.\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fujiapple852/trippy/master/assets/0.8.0/settings.png\" width=\"60%\">\n\n#### Configuration File\n\nThe previous Trippy release introduced the ability to customize the TUI color theme and key bindings, both of which\ncould be specified by command-line arguments. While functional, this method is inconvenient when configuring a large\nnumber of colors or keys.\n\nThis release adds support for a Trippy configuration file, allowing for persistent storage of color themes, key\nbindings, and all other configuration items supported by Trippy.\n\nFor a sample configuration file showing all possible configurable items that are available, see\nthe [configuration reference](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy#configuration-reference) for details.\n\n#### Shell Completions\n\nThis release enables the generation of shell completions for various shells, including bash, zsh, PowerShell, and fish,\nusing the new `--generate` command-line flag.\n\nThe following command will generate and store shell completions for the fish shell:\n\n```shell\ntrip --generate fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/trip.fish\n```\n\n#### Improved Error Reporting & Debug Logging\n\nThis release adds a number of command-line flags to enable debug logging, enhancing the ability to diagnose failures.\nFor example, the following command can be used to run tracing with no output, except for debug output in a format\nsuitable to be displayed with `chrome://tracing` or similar tools:\n\n```shell\ntrip www.example.com -m silent -v --log-format chrome\n```\n\nSocket errors have also been augmented with contextual information, such as the socket address for a bind failure, to\nhelp with the diagnosis of issues.\n\n#### New Distribution Packages\n\nTrippy is now also available as a Nix package (@figsoda), a FreeBSD port (@ehaupt) and a Windows Scoop package. This\nrelease also re-enables support for a `musl` binary which was disabled in `0.7.0` due to a bug in a critical library\nused by Trippy.\n\nSee [distributions](https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy#distributions) for the full list of available packages.\n\nMy thanks, as ever, to all Trippy contributors!\n\n## New Contributors\n\n- @utkarshgupta137 made their first contribution in https://github.com/fujiapple852/trippy/pull/537\n\n# 0.7.0\n\n## Highlights\n\nThe major highlight of the 0.7.0 release of Trippy is the addition of full support for Windows, for all tracing modes\nand protocols! 🎉. This has been many months in the making and is thanks to the hard work and perseverance of @zarkdav.\n\nThis release also sees the introduction of custom Tui themes and key bindings, `deb` and `rpm` package releases, as well\nas several important bug fixes.\n\nMy thanks to all the contributors!\n\n# 0.6.0\n\n## Highlights\n\nThe first official release of Trippy!\n"
