It's a full reimplementation of `pixi global` where it now uses a manifest file just like `pixi` projects. This way you can declare your environments and save them to a VCS.\n\nIt also brings features like, adding dependencies to a global environment, and exposing multiple binaries from the same environment that are not part of the main installed packages.\n\nTest it out with:\n```shell\n# Normal feature\npixi global install ipython\n\n# New features\npixi global install \\\n    --environment science \\           # Defined the environment name\n    --expose scipython=ipython \\      # Expose binaries under custom names\n    ipython scipy                     # Define multiple dependencies for one environment\n```\n\nThis should result in a manifest in `$HOME/.pixi/manifests/pixi-global.toml`:\n```toml\nversion = 1\n\n[envs.ipython]\nchannels = [\"conda-forge\"]\ndependencies = { ipython = \"*\" }\nexposed = { ipython = \"ipython\", ipython3 = \"ipython3\" }\n\n[envs.science]\nchannels = [\"conda-forge\"]\ndependencies = { ipython = \"*\", scipy = \"*\" }\nexposed = { scipython = \"ipython\" }\n```\n\n#### 📖 Documentation\nCheckout the updated documentation on this new feature:\n- Main documentation on this tag: https://pixi.sh/v0.33.0/\n- Global CLI documentation:

We expect all our contributors to follow it to ensure a welcoming and inclusive environment.\n\n## Getting Started\n**Familiarize yourself with Pixi:** Understand its functionality and codebase.\n**Set up your environment:** Ensure you have the necessary tools and dependencies.\n\n## How to Contribute\n- **Find an Issue:** Look for open issues or create a new issue to discuss your idea.\n- **Fork the Repository:** Make a copy of the repository to your account.\n- **Create a Branch:** Create a branch in your fork to work on your changes.\n- **Develop and Test:** Implement your changes and make sure they are thoroughly tested.\n- **Write Clear Commit Messages:** Make your changes easy to understand.\n- **Create a Pull Request:** Submit your changes for review.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Discuss your change in the issue before developing the solution when the design is not predefined.\n> This will help speedup the actual pull request review.\n\n## Pull Request Process\n- Ensure your code adheres to the project's coding standards, we use automated tooling for that, try `pixi run lint`.\n- Document new code using the Rust docstrings like we do in most places.\n- Update the `README.md` or documentation (`docs/`) with details of changes to the interface, if applicable.\n- Your pull request will be reviewed by maintainers, who may suggest changes.\n\n## Reporting Bugs\n- Use the issue tracker to report bugs.\n- Clearly describe the issue, including steps to reproduce the bug.\n- Include any relevant logs or error messages.\n\n## Feature Requests\n- Use the issue tracker to suggest new features.\n- Explain how the feature would be beneficial to the project.\n\n## Questions and Discussions\nFor general questions, consider using our chat platform: [Discord](https://discord.gg/kKV8ZxyzY4)\n\n## Acknowledgments\nYour contributions are highly appreciated and will be credited accordingly.\n\n## License\nBy contributing to Pixi, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its [LICENSE](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi/blob/main/LICENSE).\n\n# Tips while developing on `pixi`\n\n## Pixi is a pixi project so use a preinstalled `pixi` to run the predefined tasks\n```shell\npixi run build-debug # or `pixi run build-release` to build with optimizations\npixi run lint\npixi run test-all-fast\npixi run install # only works on unix systems as on windows you can't overwrite the binary while it's running\n```\n\n### Installing the target binaries to a custom location\n\nUse the pixi task `install-as` which invokes a python script to build the project and copy the executable to a custom location.\n```shell\n$ pixi run install-as\nusage: install.py [-h] [--dest DEST] name\n\nBuild pixi and copy the executable to ~/.pixi/bin or a custom destination\n\npositional arguments:\n  name                  Name of the executable (e.g. pixid)\n\noptions:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  --dest DEST           Destination directory for the executable, default: $PIXI_HOME/bin (or ~/.pixi/bin if $PIXI_HOME isn't set)\n```\n\n## Get your code ready for a PR\nWe use [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) to run all the formatters and linters that we use.\nIf you have `pre-commit` installed on your system you can run `pre-commit install` to run the tools before you commit or push.\nIf you don't have it on your system either use `pixi global install pre-commit` or use the one in your environment.\n```shell\npixi run lint\n```\n\nWhen you commit your code, please try to come up with a good commit message.\nThe maintainers (try to) use [conventional-commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).\n```shell\ngit add FILES_YOU_CHANGED\n# This is the conventional commit convention:\ngit commit -m \"<type>[optional scope]: <description>\"\n# An example:\ngit commit -m \"feat: add xxx to the pixi.toml\"\n```\n\n## Color decisions in the ui code\nWe use the `console::style` function to colorize the output of the ui.\n```rust\nuse console::style;\nprintln!(\"{} {}\", style(\"Hello\").green(), style(\"world\").red());\n```\n\nTo sync the colors of the different parts of the ui, we use the following rules:\n- `style(\"environment\").magenta()`: The environment name\n- `style(\"feature\").cyan()`: The feature name\n- `style(\"task\").blue()`: The task name\n\nThese styles are put in the `consts` module or are a `.fancy_display()` on the names. If you want to add a new generic color, please add it there.\n\n\n## Comment for Breaking Change\nIf you have a work-around for a potential breaking change, please add a comment in the code where you think the breaking change will happen. And what needs to be done when we **actually** want to break it. Use `BREAK:` in the comment to denote this.\n\nFor example:\n```rust\n// an enum to sort by size or name\n#[derive(clap::ValueEnum, Clone, Debug, Serialize)]\npub enum SortBy {\n    Size,\n    Name,\n    // BREAK: remove the alias\n    #[value(alias = \"type\")]\n    Kind,\n}\n```\n"

It provides developers with an exceptional experience similar to popular package managers like `cargo` or `yarn`, but for any language.\n\nDeveloped with ❤️ at [prefix.dev](https://prefix.dev).\n[![Real-time pixi_demo](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi/assets/12893423/0fc8f8c8-ac13-4c14-891b-dc613f25475b)](https://asciinema.org/a/636482)\n\n## Highlights\n\n- Supports **multiple languages** including Python, C++, and R using Conda packages. You can find available packages on [prefix.dev](https://prefix.dev).\n- Compatible with all major operating systems: Linux, Windows, macOS (including Apple Silicon).\n- Always includes an up-to-date **lock file**.\n- Provides a clean and simple Cargo-like **command-line interface**.\n- Allows you to install tools **per-project** or **system-wide**.\n- Entirely written in **Rust** and built on top of the **[rattler](https://github.com/mamba-org/rattler)** library.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n- ⚡ [Installation](#installation)\n- ⚙️ [Examples](/examples)\n- 📚 [Documentation](https://pixi.sh/)\n- 😍 [Contributing](#contributing)\n- 🔨 [Built using Pixi](#built-using-pixi)\n- 🚀 [GitHub Action](https://github.com/prefix-dev/setup-pixi)\n\n## Status\n\nPixi is ready for production!\nWe are working hard to keep file-format changes compatible with the previous\nversions so that you can rely on pixi with peace of mind.\n\nSome notable features we envision for upcoming releases are:\n\n- **Build and publish** your project as a Conda package.\n- Support for **dependencies from source**.\n- More powerful \"global installation\" of packages towards a deterministic setup of global packages on multiple machines.\n\n## Installation\n\n`pixi` can be installed on macOS, Linux, and Windows. The provided scripts will automatically download the latest version of `pixi`, extract it, and move the `pixi` binary to `~/.pixi/bin`. If this directory does not exist, the script will create it.\n\n### macOS and Linux\n\nTo install Pixi on macOS and Linux, open a terminal and run the following command:\n\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash\n# or with brew\nbrew install pixi\n```\n\nThe script will also update your ~/.bash_profile to include ~/.pixi/bin in your PATH, allowing you to invoke the pixi command from anywhere.\nYou might need to restart your terminal or source your shell for the changes to take effect.\n\nStarting with macOS Catalina [zsh is the default login shell and interactive shell](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102360). Therefore, you might want to use `zsh` instead of `bash` in the install command:\n\n```zsh\ncurl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | zsh\n```\n\nThe script will also update your ~/.zshrc to include ~/.pixi/bin in your PATH, allowing you to invoke the pixi command from anywhere.\n\n### Windows\n\nTo install Pixi on Windows, open a PowerShell terminal (you may need to run it as an administrator) and run the following command:\n\n```powershell\niwr -useb https://pixi.sh/install.ps1 | iex\n```\n\nThe script will inform you once the installation is successful and add the ~/.pixi/bin directory to your PATH, which will allow you to run the pixi command from any location.\nOr with `winget`\n\n```shell\nwinget install prefix-dev.pixi\n```\n\n### Autocompletion\n\nTo get autocompletion follow the instructions for your shell.\nAfterwards, restart the shell or source the shell config file.\n\n#### Bash (default on most Linux systems)\n\nAdd the following to the end of `~/.bashrc`:\n\n```bash\n# ~/.bashrc\n\neval \"$(pixi completion --shell bash)\"\n```\n#### Zsh (default on macOS)\n\nAdd the following to the end of `~/.zshrc`:\n\n\n```zsh\n# ~/.zshrc\n\neval \"$(pixi completion --shell zsh)\"\n```\n\n#### PowerShell (pre-installed on all Windows systems)\n\nAdd the following to the end of `Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`.\nYou can check the location of this file by querying the `$PROFILE` variable in PowerShell.\nTypically the path is `~\\Documents\\PowerShell\\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` or\n`~/.config/powershell/Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` on -Nix.\n\n```pwsh\n(& pixi completion --shell powershell) | Out-String | Invoke-Expression\n```\n\n#### Fish\n\nAdd the following to the end of `~/.config/fish/config.fish`:\n\n```fish\n# ~/.config/fish/config.fish\n\npixi completion --shell fish | source\n```\n\n#### Nushell\n\nAdd the following to your Nushell config file (find it by running `$nu.config-path` in Nushell):\n\n```nushell\nmkdir $\"($nu.data-dir)/vendor/autoload\"\npixi completion --shell nushell | save --force $\"($nu.data-dir)/vendor/autoload/pixi-completions.nu\"\n```\n\n#### Elvish\n\nAdd the following to the end of `~/.elvish/rc.elv`:\n\n```elv\n# ~/.elvish/rc.elv\n\neval (pixi completion --shell elvish | slurp)\n```\n\n### Distro Packages\n\n[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/pixi.svg)](https://repology.org/project/pixi/versions)\n\n#### Arch Linux\n\nYou can install `pixi` from the [extra repository](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/pixi/) using [pacman](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman):\n\n```shell\npacman -S pixi\n```\n\n#### Alpine Linux\n\n`pixi` is available for [Alpine Edge](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=pixi&branch=edge). It can be installed via [apk](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_Package_Keeper) after enabling the [testing repository](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Repositories).\n\n```shell\napk add pixi\n```\n\n## Build/install from source\n\n`pixi` is 100% written in Rust and therefore it can be installed, built and tested with cargo.\nTo start using `pixi` from a source build run:\n\n```shell\ncargo install --locked --git https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi.git pixi\n```\n\nWe don't publish to `crates.io` anymore, so you need to install it from the repository.\nThe reason for this is that we depend on some unpublished crates which disallows us to publish to `crates.io`.\n\nor when you want to make changes use:\n\n```shell\ncargo build\ncargo test\n```\n\nIf you have any issues building because of the dependency on `rattler` checkout\nit's [compile steps](https://github.com/mamba-org/rattler/tree/main#give-it-a-try)\n\n## Uninstall\n\nTo uninstall the pixi binary should be removed.\nDelete `pixi` from the `$PIXI_DIR` which is default to `~/.pixi/bin/pixi`\n\nSo on Linux its:\n\n```shell\nrm ~/.pixi/bin/pixi\n```\n\nand on Windows:\n\n```shell\n$PIXI_BIN = \"$Env:LocalAppData\\pixi\\bin\\pixi\"; Remove-Item -Path $PIXI_BIN\n```\n\nAfter this command you can still use the tools you installed with `pixi`.\nTo remove these as well just remove the whole `~/.pixi` directory and remove the directory from your path.\n\n# Usage\n\nThe cli looks as follows:\n\n```bash\n➜ pixi\nA package management and workflow tool\n\nUsage: pixi [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>\n\nCommands:\n  completion  Generates a completion script for a shell\n  init        Creates a new project\n  add         Adds a dependency to the project\n  run         Runs task in project\n  shell       Start a shell in the pixi environment of the project\n  global      Global is the main entry point for the part of pixi that executes on the global(system) level\n  auth        Login to prefix.dev or anaconda.org servers to access private channels\n  install     Install all dependencies\n  task        Command management in project\n  info        Information about the system and project\n  upload      Upload a package to a prefix.dev channel\n  search      Search a package, output will list the latest version of package\n  project\n  help        Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)\n\nOptions:\n  -v, --verbose...
