We've also made some behind-the-scenes changes which most users won't notice yet - keep an eye out for our next major release!\n\n## PowerShell improvements\n\nWhile we've always updated the user's `Path` variable for them, in the past the user had to reboot their system for the change to be reflected or temporarily add the installation directory to the `Path` themselves. Starting in 0.28.0, we now only require you to restart your shell for the change to take effect, not the entire system. We've also made improvements to our handling of this variable to better support users whose `Path` contained variable expansions.\n\nThanks to open source contributor @DavisVaughan, who did extensive research as well as writing the feature!\n\n- impl @DavisVaughan [Rework Add-Path to avoid expanding and request an environment refresh](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1658)\n\n## Fixes\n\n- @mistydemeo [Properly support installing apt packages from the default cargo-xwin builder](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1681)\n\n# Version 0.27.1 (2025-01-06)\n\n## Fixed a bug where `dist migrate` would delete `dist-workspace.toml`\n\nA bug was introduced in 0.27.0 where, instead of `dist migrate` _never_ deleting `dist-workspace.toml`, it would _always_ delete it. This has been fixed.\n\n- impl @duckinator [fix: avoid 'dist migrate' deleting dist-workspace.toml](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1661)\n\n## Warn if a tool is \"shadowed\" on your PATH\n\nShell installers now check if the tool it installed is shadowed by another tool on your path.\n\n- impl @mistydemeo [feat: check for shadowed binaries in shell installer](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1659)\n\n## Prefer GitHub over Axo Releases\n\nThis release switches the preferred installation location to GitHub. In prior releases, if the user had both GitHub Releases and Axo Releases selected, generated installation scripts and receipts would prefer to fetch from GitHub.\n\n- impl @mistydemeo [feat: prioritize github over axo](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1673)\n\n# Version 0.27.0 (2024-12-19)\n\nWe're back once more with a little holiday gift for you. This release contains a few new features and fixes.\n\n## Support for XDG_CONFIG_HOME\n\nWe've always supported standard OS configuration paths. This release adds support for `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, an [environment variable defined in the XDG Base Directory Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/#variables), in order to allow users to override that default. We support this on all platforms, even Windows. Installers created with dist 0.27.0 or later will respect this environment variable and place install receipts in that path; updaters using axoupdater 0.9.0 or later will respect that variable when searching for the receipt.\n\n- impl @brennanfee, @mistydemeo [feat: support XDG_CONFIG_HOME](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1655)\n\n## Improved handling of missing build dependencies\n\nWhile we've always reported if mandatory tools are missing, we previously would only check for their existence right before we'd use them. This made it hard to judge exactly when required tools might be absent, and meant we'd only report about a single tool at a time. With this release, we now check for these tools up front and we check for every tool your build will need simultaneously. This allows us to tell you about *every* missing tool in one message, and before the builds themselves begin.\n\n- impl @duckinator [Fail early if required tools can't be found.](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1640)\n\n## Improved generic config handling\n\nSince we shipped the new config format, `dist-workspace.toml`, we've been providing some spurious messages for non-Rust builds using just a `dist.toml` file. In this release, we now migrate users with `dist.toml`-alone apps to `dist-workspace.toml`. This conversion is automatic and requires no user input; it will happen when using `dist init` to upgrade to a new release.\n\n- impl @mistydemeo [feat: migrate dist.toml to dist-workspace.toml](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1656)\n\n## Stabilizing the standalone updater we ship\n\nIn the past, we always shipped the latest version of the standalone updater provided via [axoupdater](https://github.com/axodotdev/axoupdater). This meant that, if a new version of axoupdater was released after a given version of dist, your app would receive that latest version. As we've stabilized the updater's feature set, we feel that end users are deriving less benefit from this rolling release schedule and it would be more helpful to provide a fixed, known-good stable release instead.\n\nBeginning with this release, dist will always package the same version of axoupdater when building and shipping your app. If you prefer the old behaviour, and would like to receive whatever's the latest, you can set `always-use-latest-updater = true` in your configuration.\n\n- impl @mistydemeo [feat: update axoupdater, fetch known-good version](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1598)\n\n# Version 0.26.1 (2024-12-12)\n\nThis is a bugfix release which fixes an issue where aarch64 Windows cross-compilation wouldn't work out of the box. We've updated the default configuration to ensure that this target just works without additional configuration.\n\n- impl @mistydemeo [fix: always cross-compile to windows via xwin](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1635)\n\n# Version 0.26.0 (2024-12-12)\n\nIt's been slightly longer than usual since our last release, and now we're back with a slightly larger than usual release! This version brings several major new features and improvements, including the long-requested Rust cross-compilation feature and support for a few different Rust dependency version tracking formats.\n\n## Builtin Rust cross-compilation support\n\nYou've all asked for it, and it's finally here! Previously, we only supported Rust cross-compilation on macOS. With this release, we've extended Rust cross-compilation support to Linux (using [cargo-zigbuild](https://github.com/rust-cross/cargo-zigbuild) and Windows (using [cargo-xwin](https://github.com/rust-cross/cargo-xwin). For more information, see [the docs](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/ci/customizing.html#cross-compilation).\n\nWe're also making use of this feature ourselves: we now build our aarch64 Linux binaries using this new tooling.\n\n(Note: for technical reasons, cargo-zigbuild cross-compiles and cargo-auditable are currently mutually exclusive. Users can only enable one or the other. cargo-xwin builds and cargo-auditable can be used together.)\n\n- impl @fasterthanlime, @mistydemeo [Add cross-compilation support via cargo-zigbuild and cargo-xwin](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1529)\n\n## Checksum verifications in shell installers\n\nWhile we've always generated checksum information for binary tarballs/ZIPs, we only actually validated those checksums in the Homebrew installer. That changes with this release: we now embed checksum information into the shell installer and validate the tarball before unpacking it.\n\n- impl @fasterthanlime [Verify checksums in install.sh](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1497)\n\n## cargo-auditable support\n\nWe've added integrated support for the Rust Secure Code Working Group's [cargo-auditable](https://github.com/rust-secure-code/cargo-auditable), which embeds dependency information in your Rust binaries and makes it possible for users to check your binaries for the full dependency tree they were built from with their precise versions. For more information, see [our docs](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html#cargo-auditable) and the [docs for the cargo-audit tool](https://github.com/rustsec/rustsec/blob/main/cargo-audit/README.md).\n\n(Note: for technical reasons, this feature and cargo-zigbuild cross-compiles are currently mutually exclusive. Users can only enable one or the other. cargo-xwin builds and cargo-auditable can be used together.)\n\n- impl @duckinator [Add cargo-auditable config option](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1528)\n\n## cargo-cyclonedx support\n\nWe've also added support for generating [CyloneDX Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)](https://cyclonedx.org) files for Rust projects. We've implemented this using the [cargo-cyclonedx](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-rust-cargo/blob/main/cargo-cyclonedx/README.md) tool. Unlike the cargo-auditable support above, which embeds dependency information directly into your binaries, this data is stored as a standalone `bom.xml` file which is distributed with your software. Users can then validate that SBOM file using [any compatible CycloneDX tool](https://cyclonedx.org/tool-center/).\n\n- impl @duckinator [Add cargo-cyclonedx config option.](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1531)\n\n## OmniBOR support\n\nRounding out this release's new security features, we've added support for [generating OmniBOR artifact IDs](https://omnibor.io). We implement this using the [omnibor-cli](https://github.com/omnibor/omnibor-rs/tree/main/omnibor-cli) tool. For more information, see [the docs](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html#omnibor).\n\n- impl @duckinator [Add option to generate omnibor artifact IDs.](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1568)\n\n## Strict error catching in template rendering\n\nWe've tightened up error handling for undefined values in templates when we create things such as installer scripts and the GitHub Actions YAML config. Any errors that occur here are dist's fault, not users' fault, and stricter error handling ensures we get the information we need to fix dist bugs and make this code more reliable. This was made possible thanks to a contribution by @fasterthanlime to the minijinja project, ensuring that we get actionable messages for these kinds of errors.\n\n- impl @fasterthanlime [Enable jinja \"strict undefined behavior\", fix templates, improve reporting](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1499)\n\n## Per-target glibc version overrides\n\nAlthough we autodetect the glibc version used by your software in order to check the minimum requirements during install, users who bypass our build mechanism and run a custom build job didn't get the benefit of this feature. To compensate, we've added support for manually specifying the glibc version your software needs. For more information, see [the docs](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html#min-glibc-version).\n\n- impl @duckinator [Allow per-target glibc version overrides.](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1537)\n\n## Tag-parsing and library-only mode improvements\n\nWe've tightened up the tag parsing code, ensuring that a few edge cases are handled more predictably. The `dist plan` output is now clearer in workspaces with multiple versions, with better instruction text on how to resolve unclear situations. We've also made a small change to `dist = false` handling, which means that we now refuse to run if a release tag only matches a crate with `dist = false` instead of going ahead with single library mode.\n\n- impl\n  - @duckinator [Avoid discarding tag information, so \"dist plan --tag={name}-{version}\" works.](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1551)\n  - @mistydemeo [Disable single-library mode for dist=false](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1441)\n  - @alilleybrinker [Permit tag incoherence for dist plan](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1579)\n\n## Improved pc-windows-gnu support\n\nAlthough we've previously supported `pc-windows-gnu` builds for Rust software, we had a few notable gotchas: we wouldn't install `choco` dependencies, and PowerShell installers couldn't install them. We've fixed both of these issues this release, ensuring these targets are a bit closer to `pc-windows-msvc` in support.\n\n* impl @mistydemeo [feat: add pc-windows-gnu to powershell installers](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1586)\n\n## Fixes\n\n* @pnehrer [Explicitly set manifest path when building MSI with WiX](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1566)\n\n# Version 0.25.1 (2024-11-01)\n\nThis release contains a few new features for further customizing the installer experience, both as a packager and the end user.\n\n## Artifact location installer customization\n\nWe now provide two new environment variables making it possible to customize just the base URL for fetching installers. Previously, the only customization for overriding the install URL overrode the full URL, including version-specific paths, which made it difficult to use for users who were proxying or mirroring GitHub paths. These new variables are branded with your app's name. For example:\n\n* `{app_name}_INSTALLER_GITHUB_BASE_URL`\n* `{app_name}_INSTALLER_GHE_BASE_URL`\n\nThese two variables will also be supported by a new version of axoupdater in order to allow overriding the GitHub API URL. Thank you to user @gaborbernat for inspiring this change and writing the axoupdater side!\n\n- impl @mistydemeo [feat: allow installer domain to be overridden](feat: allow installer domain to be overridden)\n\nYou can learn more about this feature in the [artifact location installer usage documentation](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/installers/usage.html#artifact-location).\n\n## Default glibc version override\n\nOrdinarily, dist automatically detects the version of glibc used by your `linux-gnu` builds and uses this in the installers to detect if the end user's system will be compatible. In certain specific build environments, this autodetection isn't possible, so we've introduced a feature allowing the glibc version to be manually specified in the dist configuration. If provided, this replaces the fallback version that would otherwise be used.\n\n- impl @duckinator [Allow overriding minimum supported glibc version.](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1496)\n\n# Version 0.24.1 (2024-10-29)\n\nLoosens the \"cargo is broken\" error reporting condition, letting us be more\nprecise about cases where Cargo is present but Cargo metadata can't be parsed.\n\n- impl @fasterthanlime [Distinguish \"cargo metadata failed\" from \"cargo is not installed\"](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1501)\n\n# Version 0.24.0 (2024-10-28)\n\nIt's been less than two weeks, and we're already back with a big dist release for you. This release has several major features, beginning with the biggest news that:\n\n## dist has a new name\n\nDid the last paragraph give it away? Well, it's true: `cargo-dist` is now just `dist`. This reflects our growing support for packaging software built by tools beyond just Cargo. Our support for Cargo isn't going away of course, or becoming any less of a focus.\n\nAs a part of this, `dist` has moved towards a standalone CLI tool that doesn't have to be run as a `cargo` subcommand. You can now run `dist init`, `dist build` and more without needing to prefix it with `cargo`. We still install the Cargo plugin, though, so you're welcome to keep using `cargo dist` like always. As a part of being able to run without the Cargo plugin, there's one more big change:\n\n## dist runs without Cargo\n\n`dist` no longer requires Cargo if you're not building Rust projects! This is a major change which should make it much more ergonomic for users of other languages. We do still require Cargo if your workspace contains at least one Rust project; this includes commands such as `dist init` and `dist plan`.\n\n- impl @Gankra, @mistydemeo [feat: make cargo optional](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1267)\n\n## Unified checksum file\n\nThis change is completely unrelated to the new name, but it's a very nice one. We've always shipped individual checksum files for each artifact, but in this release we now also ship a unified checksum file which contains all of your hashes in a single place. It's named `$HASH_STYLE.sum`, for example `sha256.sum`, and is designed to be compatible with tools such as `shasum` and `sha256sum`.\n\n- impl @fasterthanlime [Introduce unified manifest file](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1465)\n\n## Fixes\n* impl @mistydemeo [fix: print Windows paths correctly](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1457)\n* impl @pnehrer [Specify path to Cargo.toml when generating wix for package](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1454)\n\n# Version 0.23.0 (2024-10-15)\n\nWe're back from a longer-than-usual break between releases with a feature-filled release!\n\n## The new config format emerges\n\nOver the past few months, we've been working towards a new config format. Up to now, aside from a few references in the documentation, these changes have been internal and haven't been visible to users. This release marks the first user-facing side of the new config format.\n\nThis new config format uses the `dist-workspace.toml` and `dist.toml` files that were originally created for non-Rust projects. It allows us to unify project configuration formats between languages, and allows you to configure cargo-dist without adding content to your root `Cargo.toml`. In this release, newly `cargo init`ted Rust projects will use the new format. Existing projects will be given the option to opt into the new format, but by default will keep their existing format for now.\n\nFor more information, see the [workspace docs][workspace-docs].\n\n- impl\n  - @Gankra [doc: address most config TODOs](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1422)\n  - @mistydemeo [feat: adjust new config opt-in](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1426)\n  - @mistydemeo [fix: handle final config todo](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1430)\n\n## Installer improvements\n\nThis release contains a suite of improvements to our installers.\n\n### \"Unmanaged\" install type\n\nWe now support a new install type, \"unmanaged\" installs. This is intended for users installing in ephemeral install methods such as CI, and disables several features that are unneeded in those environments. Specifically, it:\n\n* Disables updater-related tooling, including install receipt creation\n* Disables modification of the user's `PATH`, including modification of dotfiles\n* Forces a flat installation layout, installing all files into a single directory\n\nFor more information, see the [installer usage docs][installer-usage].\n\n- impl @mistydemeo [feat: unmanaged installs](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1410)\n\n### Improved path modification options\n\nWhile we've always provided options to turn off modifying the user's `PATH` in the installer, this behaviour was inconsistent between the shell and PowerShell installers. In this release, we've unified the behaviour. The current recommended path is to use environment variables; the variable controlling this is `APPNAME_NO_MODIFY_PATH`, where `APPNAME` is the name of your application. For example, `AXOLOTLSAY_NO_MODIFY_PATH` for an app named `axolotlsay`. The commandline flag, which was named inconsistently between platforms, has been deprecated.\n\nWe've also made a change to ensure that the user's preference for the \"don't modify `PATH`\" option is persisted across upgrades. This fixes an issue present in previous versions where it would only be respected on initial installation, not in calls to axoupdater.\n\nFor more information, see the [installer usage docs][installer-usage].\n\n- impl\n  - @mistydemeo [feat: unmanaged installs](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1410)\n  - @mistydemeo [feat: deprecate --no-modify-path](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1415)\n  - @mistydemeo [feat: track NO_MODIFY_PATH for updates](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1421)\n\n## npm packages can now use any archive format\n\nIn previous versions, enabling the npm installer would require your package to be distributed using `.tar.gz` archives on all platforms, including Windows. This release removes that restriction by rewriting a section of the npm installer code.\n\n- impl @mistydemeo [feat: support any format in npm](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1423)\n\n## Axoupdater version checking\n\nUsers who implement an updater by using axoupdater as a library always need to make sure that library is up to date so that they're able to make use of the latest features. This release contains a version checker which detects if your software is using an out-of-date version of axoupdater which may cause problems, and will alert you that an update is needed during builds. For more information, see [the documentation](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/installers/updater.html#minimum-supported-version-checking).\n\n- impl @mistydemeo [feat: add minimum supported axoupdater check (library)](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1432)\n\n## Standalone axoupdater installation fix\n\ncargo-dist versions 0.21.1, 0.22.0 and 0.22.1 contain a bug which caused the standalone installer to fail to install when using the shell installer. End users who installed your software via installers generated with these versions will not have received a standalone installer along with your software. This bug is fixed beginning with this release. For more information, see [the documentation](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/installers/updater.html#releases-with-issues-surrounding-the-standalone-updater).\n\n- impl @mistydemeo\n  - [fix: standalone updater installation](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1444)\n  - [fix: invalid updater for first in array](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1451)\n\n[workspace-docs]: https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/workspaces/structure.html\n[installer-usage]: https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/installers/usage.html\n\n# Version 0.22.1 (2024-09-04)\n\nThis is a small patch release that incidentally includes some initial groundwork for a new feature.\n\n* @gankra [fix: give PATH update instructions for cmd too](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1382)\n* @gankra [fix: make linkage truly infallible](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1390)\n* @mistydemeo [feat: initial impl of Mac .pkg installer](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1312)\n\n\n# Version 0.22.0 (2024-08-28)\n\nThis patch release fixes several bugs and provides some nice quality of life improvements. These fixes are largely related to our installers, shell, powershell, and homebrew as well as managing some papercuts in the `dist init` command and error handling.\n\n## App-branded installer environment variables\n\nWe generate installers for our users- and then our *users' users* use those installers. Those users don't know they are using `dist` and, if we do our job right, should never have to.\n\nWhile we had implemented some environment variables that enable users to control the behavior of installers, previously they were largely designed for internal use, and therefore namespaced with `DIST`. However, we quickly realized that this isn't suitable for having our users communicate with their users- so we've enabled the generation of app-branded installer customization environment variables- so that installer users can leverage environment variables that are branded to the application they are trying to install.\n\nRight now, the only customization we allow for installers is the install directory- so instead of `CARGO_DIST_FORCE_INSTALL_DIR`, you can tell your users to use `AXOLOTLSAY_INSTALL_DIR` (if your app is named `axolotlsay`). If you have a name with hyphens or other characters, we normalize it for you, and you can find this value at the `install_dir_env_var` field in the `dist-manifest.json` that is generated with each of your releases.\n\n* impl @mistydemeo [add app branded env var for custom dir to installers](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1377)\n\n## Homebrew license metadata\n\nCurrently, when publishing to a Homebrew tap, whatever string is in the project's license field (usually a SPDX license expression) gets passed into license in the Homebrew formula. However, rather than using SPDX syntax, Homebrew has its own ruby syntax for specifying licenses. So, when passed an SPDX expression, Homebrew:\n\n- Cannot provide as detailed information about the package's licensing.\n- Throws errors when linting the formula with brew audit/brew test-bot.\n\nThis PR translates the SPDX expression to the Homebrew license DSL.\n\n* impl @cxreiff [translate SPDX expressions to Homebrew license DSL to produce better Homebrew package metadata](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1345)\n\n## Homebrew compliance (`brew style`)\n\nCreating a personal tap with brew tap-new creates a default Github Actions workflow that runs a homebrew-specific style check (brew style <TAPNAME>) on the repo. Cargo-dist's generated homebrew formulas fail this style check. This does not block the core functionality of cargo-dist's homebrew publishing functionality (formula still functions), but does mean that users whorun `brew style` (which is a side effect of creating a tap with `brew tap-new`) would get frustrating errors.\n\nRather than separately chasing formatting issues as they come up, this PR updates the homebrew publish workflow to install and run `brew style --fix` on each formula before committing it.\n\n* impl\n  * @cxreiff [format homebrew formulas with brew style --fix](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1340)\n  * @mistydemeo [enable brew style linters in tests](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1354)\n\n## Fixes\n* @mistydemeo [enable powershell installer to respect NoModifyPath from env](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1379)\n* @gankra [improve powershell installer portability by updating ExecutionPolicy flag and offering better hints](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1373)\n* @mistydemeo [handle `ar` archives when parsing Windows objects, ensure unsupported binary linkage checks are non-fatal, and improve linkage checker errors](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1357)\n* @gankra [improve `init` errors for custom projects, and ensure prompts are more contextual](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1360)\n* @mistydemeo [update reference to renamed config in error message](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1358)\n\n\n# Version 0.21.1 (2024-08-20)\n\nThis patch release fixes several bugs and provides some quality of life improvements.

In particular, we check to ensure that the user's glibc is compatible with the version that your software linked against during its build.\n\nIn previous versions of cargo-dist, we hardcoded the version of glibc we expected your software to be built against based on the version used by our default Linux builders. Since the CI runners are configurable, however, it was possible for the actual glibc your package linked against to be different from the one we were expecting. This release adds new build environment tracking metadata, capturing information such as the system glibc/musl version your software linked against and the macOS version used to build. We use the real glibc information in your installers as of this release, and future versions of cargo-dist will make use of the other data we're now tracking.\n\n* impl\n  * @mistydemeo [Track glibc versions and other runtime requirements](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1210)\n  * @Gankra [chore: rework RuntimeConditions](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1215)\n\n## Fixes\n\n* @Gankra [fix: javascript workspace bugs](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1309)\n* @mistydemeo [deps: update axios in npm installer](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1313)\n\n\n# Version 0.20.0 (2024-08-08)\n\nThis release contains several new features and bugfixes.\n\n## Support for packaging C libraries\n\nHistorically, cargo-dist has been focused on building and distributing binaries. There's so many more kinds of software out there, however, and we've had requests to package more kinds of artifacts. This release introduces support for two new kinds of build artifacts: C dynamic libraries, and C static libraries. While these would always be built in the past, we wouldn't package or install them for you. Starting with this release, we've now added the option to include these in your release tarballs/ZIPs and to install them in your installers.\n\nWe recognize that it may cause issues if existing binary-plus-library crates began unexpectedly installing libraries with this release, so we've introduced this feature as opt-in for the time being. It may be turned on by default in a future release. To enable packaging libraries in your tarballs/ZIPs, use the [package-libraries](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html#package-libraries) configuration option. To enable installing libraries, use the [install-libraries](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html#install-libraries) configuration option.\n\nIn the current release, libraries will be installed to the same locations as binaries in the shell and PowerShell installers, while the Homebrew installer will install them to the Homebrew-standard library paths. In the future, as we introduce new forms of installation layouts, we'll provide ways for the shell and PowerShell installers to install libraries to separate locations.\n\nRust users can produce these with the `cdylib` and `staticlib` crate types. For more information, see the [Rust documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/linkage.html). Generic build users can specify which libraries to include using the `cdylibs` and `cstaticlibs` configuration fields in `dist.toml`.\n\n* impl @mistydemeo\n  * [Support cdylibs from Rust/generic projects](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1182)\n  * [Build and install static libs](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1214)\n\n## Custom pre-build actions in CI\n\nThis release introduces an experimental feature which makes it possible to run arbitrary extra build steps before cargo-dist's own build step during GitHub Actions runs. This can be useful for users who have mandatory pre-build setup they want to perform which can't be satisfied using the system dependencies feature. For example, a build which requires a custom installation of lua could specify that these two extra steps should be performed before the build begins:\n\n```yaml\n- name: Install Lua\n  uses: xpol/setup-lua@v1\n  with:\n    lua-version: \"5.3\"\n- name: Check lua installation\n  run: lua -e \"print('hello world!')\"\n```\n\nFor more information, [consult the documentation](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/ci/github.html#customizing-build-setup).\n\n* impl @FreeMasen [ci: add github build setup configuration](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1217)\n\n## The First Rumblings Of 1.0\n\nThis release introduces the first steps in a major overhaul of cargo-dist that makes it more suitable for building and distributing apps that aren't written in Rust. This is something we've supported for a long time, but now we're making a big push to make it first-class and stabilizing all the parts.\n\nThere is also now experimental support for natively understanding JS projects, to make it easier to use dist for standalone JS executables. [Read the new JS quickstart for details!](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/quickstart/javascript.html)\n\nSeveral other pages of the docs have seen overhauls, and many more are to come.\n\n## Fixes\n\n* @mistydemeo [init: ensure terminal is restored when interrupted](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1253)\n* @mistydemeo [fix: add missing triples to linkage check](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1221)\n* @Colonial-Dev [fix: compatibility issues with Bash on certain distributions (Fedora, EL)](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1189)\n\n\n# Version 0.19.1 (2024-07-12)\n\nThis is a minor release that makes cargo-dist build with versions of rustc older than 1.79.0 (as of this writing, the latest release). The previous cargo-dist release accidentally relied on the rustc's [new temporary lifetime extension features](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2024/06/13/Rust-1.79.0.html#extending-automatic-temporary-lifetime-extension), making us suddenly require bleeding edge rustc for no good reason.\n\n\n# Version 0.19.0 (2024-07-11)\n\nThis release improves support for corporate networks, fixes a regression in the ssldotcom-windows-sign feature, and lands some more groundwork for future improvements.\n\n\n## System Certificates\n\nWhen doing network requests, cargo-dist and axoupdater can be configured to look at both the system certificate stores and [builtin webpki-roots](https://github.com/rustls/webpki-roots). Usually the latter is sufficient, but the former may be necessary to when running these tools in some corporate networks.\n\nAs of cargo-dist 0.19.0 and axoupdater 0.6.8, all prebuilt binaries of these two tools have both sources enabled, ensuring maximum interoperability and portability.\n\nWhen building from source (with e.g. `cargo install`), or using axoupdater as library, we currently default to only using the webpki roots. If you need system certificates to be consulted, they can be enabled in either project with `--features=tls_native_roots`.\n\nIn the future we *may* just enable system certificates by default. We're being a bit cautious because we've heard some concerns about portability and performance but haven't yet seen them in the wild, at least for the systems we've tested on.\n\n* @gankra + @mchernicoff [feat: add experimental tls_native_roots feature](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1160)\n\n\n## Fixes\n\n* @gankra [fix: update axoasset to fix regression in ssldotcom-windows-sign](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1160)\n* @mistydemeo [fix: handle Invoke-Installer errors](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1199)\n* @mistydemeo [fix: writeback default install-path to config to prepare for changing the default](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1195)\n\n\n# Version 0.18.0 (2024-07-03)\n\n\n## Features\n\n\n### disabling the CI build cache when unnecessary\n\nFor a long time now we've had [`swatinem/rust-cache`](https://github.com/Swatinem/rust-cache) as part of cargo-dist's CI build jobs. In fact, improving the configuration for that cache has been one of the most frequent new contributions!\n\nWith all the improvements applied, we've actually discovered that the cache largely wasn't doing anything in practice. This is because `swatinem/rust-cache` quite reasonably invalidates the cache whenever your Cargo.toml or Cargo.lock changes, which includes changing the version of your crate to publish a new version -- the thing you do right before cutting a release with cargo-dist!\n\nWorse yet, the cache can hang each build machine for over 2 minutes to determine this fact, meaning it often *slows down* releases!\n\nSo we've introduced the [cache-builds setting](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html#cache-builds) and defaulted it to off for most users. Users that might benefit from it still will have it defaulted on. See the docs for details!\n\n* [docs](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html#cache-builds)\n* @gankra [feat: add cache-builds setting, and disable by default](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1178)\n\n\n\n\n### allowing custom job permissions to be changed\n\nWhen using custom CI jobs, cargo-dist's CI needs to pass down permissions to each one. For a long time now we've passed special permissions to custom publish jobs to let them publish to [GitHub packages](https://github.com/features/packages), but they've been hardcoded, and all other jobs have had no special permissions.\n\nNow using the [github-custom-job-permissions setting](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html#github-custom-job-permissions) you can give any of your custom jobs whatever permissions they need.\n\n* [docs](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html#github-custom-job-permissions)\n* @gankra [feat: add github-custom-job-permissions setting](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1179)\n\n\n## Fixes\n\n* @zanieb [docs: improve example for bin-aliases option](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1180)\n\n\n\n\n# Version 0.17.0 (2024-06-27)\n\nThis release is mostly several fixes to how we create GitHub Releases, as well as some internal improvements for future feature work.\n\n\n## GitHub Release Ordering\n\nWe now prefer creating your [GitHub Release in the host step](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html#github-release), ensuring published npm and Homebrew packages never refer to URLs that don't yet exist.\n\nConceptually the cargo-dist pipeline is as follow:\n\n1. plan the release\n2. build the artifacts\n3. host the artifacts\n4. publish the packages (these can fetch the hosted artifacts!)\n5. announce the release (this says to install the published packages!)\n\nGitHub Releases has always been a bit problematic as a hosting provider because it's both where we want to host our files, and creating it is also in some sense announcing the release. Ideally you would be able to draft the GitHub Release to host your files, publish everything that references those files, and then undraft it at the end to announce and tag the release. However the URLs of artifacts in a draft release are temporary, and go away when you undraft it, so this doesn't work.\n\nWhen we first created cargo-dist, we didn't support publishing packages, so we put GitHub Release at the end, since it was basically the only \"side-effect\" of running cargo-dist, and you want those at the end. Once we added publishing of things to npm and homebrew, the dual nature of GitHub releases became way more apparent.\n\nIn fact, because the GitHub Release contains instructions to install from npm/homebrew, there was essentially a circular dependency between them, with no way to publish all of them in a non-racey way. At the time we opted for preserving existing behaviour of GitHub Last, resulting in a roughly 30 second period where npm/homebrew packages would be published but would error out on install because the artifacts aren't yet uploaded.\n\nWe were of course frustrated with this and [had a lot of words to say about URLs, resulting in us making axo Releases, which solved the problem properly](https://blog.axo.dev/2024/01/axo-releases-urls).\n\nBut pure GitHub users aren't going away, and this conflict still exists for them. Since then it's become increasingly clear that we made the wrong call here, and in fact the npm/homebrew package integrity is *way* more important than someone maybe getting an email about a GitHub Release referencing packages that don't yet exist. As such we've reversed the original decision and moved GitHub Releases to the host step.\n\nWhen using axo Releases together with GitHub Releases, GitHub remains in the announce step where it belongs, because it's more of a mirror/announcement, and not the canonical file host.\n\nIf for whatever reason you need to get the old behaviour back, you can use the new [`github-release = \"announce\"` config](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html#github-release).\n\nThe only reason you might want to override this setting is if you're using [`dispatch-releases = true`](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html#dispatch-releases) and you really want your git tag to be the last operation in your release process (because creating a GitHub Release necessarily creates the git tag if it doesn't yet exist, and many organizations really don't like when you delete/change git tags). In this case setting `github-release = \"announce\"` will accomplish that, but the above race conditions would then apply.\n\n* [docs](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html#github-release)\n* @mistydemeo [fix: prefer creating github releases in host step](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1171)\n\n\n## GitHub Release Reliability\n\nGitHub Releases should once again be created transactionally, preventing a release from being created without its artifacts being uploaded, if uploading the artifacts fails for any reason. This fixes a regression from the previous release.\n\nWhen using the `dispatch-releases = true` setting, we now more strictly specify the commit that should be tagged, preventing any race conditions from changing it. This race potentially always existed, but only seemed to be observable if you retried a failed release.\n\n* @gankra + @mistydemeo [fix: make github releases more robust](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1164)\n\n\n## Other Fixes\n\n* @gankra [feat: experimental generic workspaces](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1116)\n* @mistydemeo [chore: move axoproject in tree](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1135)\n* @mistydemeo [fix: clamp workspace search to current repo](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1158)\n* @mistydemeo [fix: pass correct path to generic builds](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1157)\n* @mistydemeo [fix: add generic workspace tests](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1150)\n* @mistydemeo [fix: pipe working directory to more commands](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1139)\n* @mistydemeo [feat: cache cargo-dist binary in global tasks](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1165)\n\n\n\n# Version 0.16.0 (2024-06-14)\n\nThis release introduces some new [supplychain security features](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/supplychain-security/index.html), and fixes some bugs.\n\n## GitHub Artifact Attestations\n\nWith the new [`github-attestations = true` setting](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/supplychain-security/attestations/github.html) you can opt into GitHub's experimental artifact attestation system. In the future this may become enabled by default.\n\n* @dunxen [feat: add support for github artifact attestations](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1012)\n\n\n## Reducing Third-Party Actions\n\nWe're working towards replacing some third-party GitHub actions used by cargo-dist with builtin implementations, reducing the surface area for audits. We've begun with replacing [ncipollo/release-action](https://github.com/ncipollo/release-action) with usage of the preinstalled GitHub CLI. To be clear: we have no reason to distrust the contents of action, and it's officially recommended by GitHub. It was just simple to replace with a more first-party solution.\n\n@mistydemeo [feat: use the raw github cli instead of an action for releases](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1089)\n\n\n## Autodetect Buildjet Runners For Rust Cache\n\nWe use [swatinem/rust-cache](https://github.com/Swatinem/rust-cache) to try to speed up the release process. As it turns out, they have special support for buildjet's caching backend, which is faster and presumably more secure to use when running actions on buildjet's infra. Our users often [enable buildjet for arm linux builds](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/ci/customizing.html#custom-runners), so hopefully those should be faster now!\n\n@gankra + @arlyon [feat: autodetect buildjet runners to use their backend for rust cache](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1129)\n\n\n## Path Flexibility For Extra Artifacts\n\nPreviously [the extra-artifacts setting](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html#extra-artifacts) didn't support the outputs being produced anywhere but the root of the repository. Now the input can be a relative path, making the feature easier to use.\n\n@gankra [fix: rework extra_artifacts to properly use paths](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1128)\n\n\n# Version 0.15.1 (2024-06-04)\n\nThis is a small release to improve the compatibility of the npm installers with other JS package managers.\n\nIn 0.15.0 we introduced a regression for installing via pnpm, resulting in infinite loops that produced a cryptic \"argument list too long\" error. This only affected pnpm because of the precise timing of when it creates shim scripts for binaries. This has now been fixed, and we've introduced tests to ensure that pnpm is explicitly supported from here on out.\n\nWe now signal to yarn that we mutate node_modules (to fetch and install binaries), avoiding issues with yarn PnP which assumes node_modules is immutable. Tests have been introduced to ensure that yarn is explicitly supported from here on out.\n\n\n# Version 0.15.0 (2024-05-31)\n\nThis release contains a ton of new features and some fixes.\n\nFor the supplychain folks, we now support windows codesigning and several new hashing algorithms.\n\nFor projects with complex repositories, we now have several new options for configuring the release process.\n\n\n## Windows codesigning\n\ncargo-dist can automatically codesign Windows EXEs and MSIs using SSL.com's eSigner cloud signing service.\n\nAlthough there are many ways to do code signing, this process is specifically concerned with ensuring Windows SmartScreen recognizes the authenticity of the signatures and doesn't prevent your users from running the application. Otherwise, any user who downloads your application with a web browser will get a popup warning them against running it. (Alternative methods of downloading and installing, such as cargo-dist's powershell installers do not trigger SmartScreen.)\n\n* [docs](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/signing-and-attestation.html#windows-artifact-signing-with-sslcom-certificates)\n* impl @Gankra [feat: reimplement ssldotcom-windows-sign](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1036)\n\n\n## Additional hash algorithms\n\nThe SHA-3 and BLAKE2 hash algorithms are now supported.\n\nThanks to @sorairolake for contributing this!\n\n* [docs](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html#checksum)\n* impl @sorairolake [feat: support SHA-3 and BLAKE2](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1067)\n\n\n## Improvements for installing tools within GitHub Actions\n\nPreviously, our installers would update the user's `PATH` for local commandline access but wouldn't set themselves up in the `PATH` within GitHub Actions. We've added a feature to the shell and Windows installers which detects if they're running within Actions and adds the newly-installed tool to `GITHUB_PATH` for future tasks within the job.\n\n* impl @Gankra [feat: add paths to GITHUB_PATH if available](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1047)\n\n\n## Custom installer output\n\nWhen a shell or powershell installer runs successfully it will print out \"everything's installed!\", but if you want a different message that better matches your app's look-and-feel, or provides a more useful call-to-action, you can now do that with [the `install-success-msg` setting](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html#install-success-msg).\n\n* [docs](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html#install-success-msg)\n* impl @ashleygwilliams [feat: custom success msg](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1102)\n\n\n## Forcing prereleases to be the latest\n\ncargo-dist has traditionally parsed the version number of new releases and used this to determine if the new release is a prerelease or a stable release. We apply some special handling to prereleases, such as marking them as prereleases within GitHub Releases. In 0.15.0, we've added the new [`force-latest`](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html#force-latest) configuration flag which makes it possible to instruct cargo-dist to treat every release as the latest release regardless of its version number.\n\nThis mostly exists to support projects who only plan to produce prereleases for the foreseeable future, so that GitHub properly shows them in its UI.\n\n* [docs](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html#force-latest)\n* impl @mistydemeo [feat: allow always marking releases as stable](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1054)\n\n## Configuring the global runner\n\nIn 0.6.0, we added support for configuring custom runners for native builds in GitHub Actions. However, until now, all other jobs still ran using our default runner. We've added a setting to the existing custom runner syntax that lets you specify what runner to use for all other jobs by using [the \"global\" key](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html#github-custom-runners).\n\n* [docs](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html#github-custom-runners)\n* impl @mistydemeo [feat: allow configuring global runner](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1055)\n\n## Specify commit to publish to in external repo\n\nIn 0.14.0, we added the new [`github-releases-repo`](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html#github-releases-repo) configuration which allows publishing releases to an external repository rather than the one in which the CI job is running. The new [`github-releases-submodule-path`](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html#github-releases-submodule-path) configuration option enhances that with an additional feature: it allows specifying a submodule within the current repository to use to determine which commit to tag the new release as.\n\n* [docs](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html#github-releases-submodule-path)\n* impl @mistydemeo [feat: allow specifying external commit from submodule](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1026)\n\n\n## Fixes\n\n* @mistydemeo [fix: improve reliability for fetching standalone updaters](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1052)\n* @mistydemeo [fix: write correct install prefix to receipt](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1037)\n* @mistydemeo [fix: bin_aliases should come from packages](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1031)\n* @Gankra [fix: repair and cleanup npm binary caching](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1050)\n* @sorairolake [fix: zstd file extension](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1066)\n\n\n# Version 0.14.1 (2024-05-08)\n\nThis is a bugfix release which fixes release announcement text for apps whose `repository` field in `Cargo.toml` ends with `.git` ([#1020](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/issues/1020)).

You can even make aliases for commands with the new [bin-aliases setting](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html#bin-aliases).\n\nAlthough for the best user experience, ensuring your package [unambiguously has one true command](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npx#description) is ideal. To help with this, the [npm-package setting](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html#npm-package) was added, allowing you to rename your npm package (which is one of the disambiguators for the primary command of an npm package).\n\nYou can also now automatically [publish your npm packages](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/installers/npm.html#quickstart) by [setting `publish-jobs = [\"npm\"]`](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html#publish-jobs)!\n\n* [docs](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/installers/npm.html)\n* impl\n    * @gankra [rewrite npm installer](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/974)\n    * @gankra [add npm-package config](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/988)\n    * @ashleygwilliams [add builtin npm publish](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/966)\n    * @ashleygwilliams [rewrite npm installer docs](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/985)\n\n\n### install-path cascades\n\nThe [install-path setting](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html#install-paths) that's used by the shell and powershell installers can now be an array of options to try in sequence. This is mostly useful for checking if special environment variables are set before falling back to some hardcoded subdir of $HOME.\n\nFor instance, if you set:\n\n```toml\ninstall-dir = [\"$MY_APP_HOME/bin\", \"~/.my-app/bin\"]\n```\n\nThen your shell and powershell installers will first check if `$MY_APP_HOME` is defined and install to `$MY_APP_HOME/bin` if it is. If it's not defined then it will use the more hardcoded `$HOME/.my-app/bin`.\n\n* [docs](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html#install-paths)\n* @mistydemeo [impl](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/947)\n\n\n### binary aliases\n\nThe shell, powershell, npm, and homebrew installers all now support aliases for binaries with the new [bin-aliases setting](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html#bin-aliases). These are not included in your downloadable archives, and are setup in an installer-specific way:\n\n* shell: symlinks\n* powershell: hardlinks\n* npm: extra \"bin\" entries pointing at the same command\n* homebrew: bin.install_symlink\n\n* [docs](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html#bin-aliases)\n* impl\n    * @mistydemeo [add binary aliases](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/964)\n    * @mistydemeo [adjust feature name](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/986)\n    * @mistydemeo [force symlinks to overwrite](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/997)\n\n\n### publish github releases to other repo\n\nIf you need to publish your GitHub Releases to a different repo than the one you run your release workflow on, you can use the new [github-releases-repo setting](github-releases-repo) to specify this.\n\n* [docs](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html#github-releases-repo)\n* @gankra [impl](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/967)\n\n\n### disable alternative source tarballs\n\nYou can now disable the backup source tarballs uploaded by cargo-dist with the new [source-tarball setting](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html#source-tarball).\n\n* [docs](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html#source-tarball)\n* @mistydemeo [impl](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/959)\n\n\n## Fixes\n\n* @gankra [rewrite homebrew installer docs](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/954)\n* @mistydemeo [use more idiomatic homebrew install expressions](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/1000)\n* @mistydemeo [fix references to selfupdate command](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/957)\n* @gankra [unify installer platform-compatibility code](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/984)\n* @mistydemeo [implement fish support in installer](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/958)\n\n\n# Version 0.13.3 (2024-04-22)\n\nThis minor release adds some more resilience to release.yml by explicitly enabling windows\nlongpath support, in case your repository (or submodules) contain extremely long filenames or paths.\n\nIt also adds some missing dependency constraints for custom local and global build jobs.\n\n## Fixes\n\n* @gankra [improvements to release.yml](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/951)\n\n\n# Version 0.13.2 (2024-04-16)\n\nThis minor release updates several dependencies and contains one improvement to the shell installer.\n\n## Fixes\n\n* @mistydemeo [update to axoasset which should fix remaining issues with recursive ZIP files on Windows](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/939) ([#873])\n* @mistydemeo [install the correct architecture binary on macOS when run from a shell inside Rosetta](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/941)\n\n[#873]: https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/issues/873\n\n\n# Version 0.13.1 (2024-04-12)\n\nThis is a release that adds some improvements to the logic for updating PATH and rcfiles in installers.\n\n## Fixes\n\n* @gankra [don't corrupt rcfiles that are missing a trailing newline](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/917)\n* @mistydemeo [when invoking shell installer from updater, append /bin and use HOME vars more precisely](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/928)\n* @mistydemeo [as above, but for powershell](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/929)\n* @mistydemeo [use target-specific keys to fix swatinem rust cache](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/927/)\n\n\n# Version 0.13.0 (2024-04-09)\n\nThis releases introduces a 'selfupdate' command, using cargo-dist's new updater support.\n\nIt also includes several bugfixes and a technically-breaking-change to the dist-manifest feature.\n\n\n## Features\n\nA new `cargo dist selfupdate` command has been added which updates cargo dist to the latest\nversion and runs `cargo dist init` using that new version. As a result, this should in\nbe a go-to replacement for most uses of `cargo dist init`.\n\nThis is based on the new experimental [axoupdater library](https://github.com/axodotdev/axoupdater/).\nEssentially it just checks GitHub Releases or axo Releases for anything newer, and fetches and\nruns the appropriate shell/powershell installer.\n\nThis library is the same one used for the updater feature of cargo-dist, which has cargo-dist\nprovide a standalone separate updater binary. The benefit of us using the library directly is\nthat we get a more unified design at the cost of needing to actually change the interface of\nour application -- something the separate binary avoids.\n\n* @mistydemeo [initial implementation](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/899)\n* @gankra [finalize implementation](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/906)\n\n\n## Breaking Change\n\n* @gankra [manifest reform](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/848)\n\nThis release makes a several changes to the dist-manifest format which ideally shouldn't\nbe breaking in the strictest sense of the word, but are breaking in spirit. No one is expected\nto be effected, as the metadata in question is so niche that not even axo's own tooling\nwas making a use of it.\n\nThe upshot of this breakage is that we now properly collect and merge unambiguous per-platform and\nper-binary metadata from build machines, which is groundwork for significantly improved installers\nand tooling.\n\nChanges include:\n\n* there is now a top-level `systems` map in the manifest\n    * contains gathered information about each system cargo-dist ran on to build your release\n    * this effectively deprecates the `system_info` value, which was already optional and not terribly useful\n* there is now a top-level `assets` map in the manifest\n    * contains gathered information about each binary cargo-dist built\n    * refers to the `systems{}` that the binary was built on\n    * contains linkage info\n* the top-level `linkage` array has been deprecated in favour of the same entries being nested in `assets`, and is now always empty\n    * in future versions it may be removed, but the schema didn't mark this field as optional so it can't yet be removed\n* `artifacts{}.assets[].id` now can optionally refer to an entry in `assets`\n    * this allows you to precisely get the dependencies (linkage) for each binary in an archive, or for the whole archive (by merging them)\n    * in the future it will also be used to get things like libc version requirements\n* `artifacts{}.checksums{}` has been added\n    * contains the actual checksum value(s)\n    * the existing `artifacts{}.checksum` only refers to a checksum *file*, as previously the manifest could not be updated with \"computed\" info\n    * this being a map allows artifacts to have multiple checksums, which is useful since lots of things hard require sha256\n\n## Fixes\n\n* @mistydemeo [run apt-get update before installing system deps](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/877)\n* @ucodery [make formula files pass brew lint](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/818)\n* @tshepang [fix copyright year](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/883)\n* @mistydemeo [further update copyright year](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/884)\n* @tisokun [properly spell GitHub in CI yml](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/886)\n* @gankra [use mv instead of cp in installer.sh](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/894)\n* @nokazn [fix broken link in docs](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/900)\n\n# Version 0.12.2 (2024-04-04)\n\nThis is a minor release which regenerates the shell installer using the fix from 0.12.1.

It also includes a few other bugfixes and improvements.\n\n## Features\n\n### cargo-dist updater\n\nThe new cargo-dist updater, [axoupdater](https://github.com/axodotdev/axoupdater), provides a way for your users to easily upgrade your software without needing to check your website for new versions. If you enable the new `install-updater = true` option in cargo-dist, users who install your software via the shell or PowerShell installers will receive a standalone updater program alongside your program itself. Running this program will check for updates and, if necessary, install the new version for them. In addition, axoupdater provides a Rust library with all of its functionality exposed so that you can choose to integrate the updater functionality into your own program directly.\n\nFor more information, see the [cargo-dist documentation](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/installers/updater.html) or consult the axoupdater repository and [documentation](http://docs.rs/axoupdater/latest/axoupdater/).\n\n### Homebrew cask dependencies\n\nHomebrew cask dependencies can now be installed.\n\n* impl @mistydemeo [feat: support cask deps for Homebrew](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/855)\n\n### PowerShell installer tests\n\nWe now run PowerShell installers end to end in cargo-dist's own tests.\n\n* impl @Gankra [chore: add ruin_me powershell tests](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/862)\n\n### Invoke `rustup target add` for additional forms of cross-compiling\n\nWe now run `rustup target add` unconditionally when cross-compiling; before, this was limited to macOS or for musl Linux. This is primarily useful for targeting Windows ARM, but may be useful for other cross-compilation targets in the future.\n\n* impl @AustinWise [feat: always rustup target add in cross](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/846)\n\n### Allow overriding install path in shell and PowerShell installers\n\nAlthough some installer configuration allows setting the installation path, there was previously no way to force the installer to install to a location of the user's choosing. We've added a feature to do so via the new `CARGO_DIST_FORCE_INSTALL_DIR` environment variable.\n\nThis is primarily intended for cargo-dist's internal use, and is used by the updater to ensure that new releases are installed in the same location as the previous version; other users may find it useful.\n\n* impl @mistydemeo [feat: allow overriding install path](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/837)\n\n## Fixes\n\n* @mistydemeo [fix install path in install receipts in certain circumstances](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/863)\n* @Gankra [fix: for reals reals utf8 for reals FOR REALS](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/852)\n* @kbattocchi [feat: enable fallback to x64 in Invoke-Installer](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/835)\n\n# Version 0.11.1 (2024-02-23)\n\nThis release is a few minor improvements, and a new config for homebrew installers.\n\n## Features\n\nThe name of your homebrew formula can now be overridden with `formula = \"my-cool-formula\"`.\n\n* [docs](opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html#formula)\n* impl\n    * @ashleygwilliams [initial impl](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/791)\n    * @gankra [add support to brew publish job](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/816)\n\n## Fixes\n\n* @gankra [powershell `iem | iex` exprs are now more robust and can be run from cmd](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/808).

Setting `tag-name = \"owo\"` will change the tag matching expression we put in your github ci, to require the tag to start with \"owo\" for cargo-dist to care about it. This can be useful for situations where you have several things with different tag/release workflows in the same workspace. It also renames `release.yaml` to `owo-release.yml` to make it clear it's just one of many release workflows.\n\n* [docs](opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html#tag-namespace)\n* @gankra [impl](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/779)\n\n\n## Fixes\n\n### Shell Replaces\n\n0.9.0 had a minor error in a new experimental shell installer feature that would cause scary sed errors to appear in the terminal output for apps with multiple binaries. The core functionality of the installer would work perfectly, with the only degradation in functionality being an optional \"install-receipt\" failing to be saved to the end-user's system.\n\nIn addition, the receipt would point to `$CARGO_HOME` instead of `$CARGO_HOME/bin` in the default configuration, which has now been changed.\n\n* @gankra [impl](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/776)\n\n\n\n\n# Version 0.9.0 (2024-02-01)\n\nThis release contains several new features for users of GitHub Actions. In particular, we've updated the runners we use by default and we now use the latest versions of the upload-artifact and download-artifact GitHub actions.\n\n## Features\n\n### Newer macOS runners for GitHub Actions\n\nIn preparation for the retirement of the `macos-11` runners, we've upgraded to the slightly newer `macos-12`. We still prefer running on these older runners, and not the newer `macos-13` or `macos-14` options, for broader compatibility across OS versions.\n\nUsers who wish to take advantage of GitHub's [new Apple Silicon runners](https://github.blog/changelog/2024-01-30-github-actions-introducing-the-new-m1-macos-runner-available-to-open-source/), which entered public beta on January 30, should consider setting up custom runners in their `Cargo.toml`:\n\n```toml\n[workspace.metadata.dist.github-custom-runners]\naarch64-apple-darwin = \"macos-14\"\n```\n\n* @mistydemeo [impl](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/754)\n\n### Updated to the latest upload-artifact/download-artifact GitHub actions\n\nWe now use the latest (v4) versions of the upload-artifact and download-artifact GitHub actions. There's no need to change anything in your app, and most users won't see any changes from this. However, users with custom jobs which read from or write to artifacts will need to update their jobs to account for the new structure.\n\n* @mistydemeo [impl](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/755)\n\n\n# Version 0.8.2 (2024-01-29)\n\nThis release contains a new testing feature: `--artifacts=lies`. This allows generating fake artifacts during builds instead of real artifacts, allowing for dry-run tests to proceed without the need for real cross-compilation.\n\n## Features\n\n### --artifacts=lies\n\nCalling `cargo dist build --artifacts=lies` now produces stubbed out artifacts for native builds and certain installers, such as the MSI installer and the source tarball. This allows a fake build which nonetheless contains a full set of real artifacts to be run on any machine, including a a local machine without cargo cross-compilation support. This is especially useful for staging releases to test axo Releases.\n\n* @mistydemeo + @gankra [impl](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/741)\n\n\n# Version 0.8.1 (2024-01-26)\n\nJust a small release with a pile of bugfixes!\n\n## Fixes\n\n@dsully [Fix Linuxbrew installers](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/697)\n@gankra [Fix zstd archive support (was never properly implemented)](https://github.com/axodotdev/axoasset/pull/77)\n@gankra [Fix dependabot's interaction with axo releases](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/739)\n\n\n# Version 0.8.0 (2024-01-19)\n\nThis release is a mix of quality-of-life changes and fixes.\n\n`dispatch-releases = true` adds a new experimental mode where releases are triggered with workflow-dispatch instead of tag-push.\n\n`build-local-artifacts = false` disables the builtin CI jobs that would build your binaries and archives (and MSI installers).

Currently hosting is also disabled, but future versions may add some forms of hosting in this mode.\n\n* @gankra [impl](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/717)\n* [docs](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html#dispatch-releases)\n\n\n\n### build-local-artifacts\n\n`build-local-artifacts = false` disables the builtin CI jobs that would build your binaries and archives (and MSI installers). This allows a Sufficiently Motivated user to use custom `build-local-jobs` to completely replace cargo-dist's binary building with something like maturin.\n\nThe requirements are simply that you need your custom actions to:\n\n* build archives (tarballs/zips) and checksums that the local CI was expected to produce\n* use the github upload-artifacts action to upload all of those to an artifact named `artifacts`\n\nYou can get a listing of the exact artifact names to use and their expected contents with:\n\n```\ncargo dist manifest --artifacts=local --no-local-paths\n```\n\n(`[checksum]` entries are separate artifacts and not actually stored in the archives.)\n\nAlso note that for legacy reasons a tarball is expected to have all the contents nested under a root dir with the same name as the tarball (sans extension), while zips are expected to have all the files directly in the root (installers pass `--strip-components=1` to tar when extracting).\n\n* @gankra [impl](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/717)\n* [docs](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html#build-local-artifacts)\n\n\n\n## Fixes\n\n* better platform printing\n    * @gankra [more pleasant fallback for unknown platforms](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/728)\n    * @gankra [more known platforms, better display names](https://github.com/axodotdev/axoproject/pull/82)\n    * @gankra [better sort](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/732)\n* @gankra [add proper pr-run-mode guards to custom build jobs](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/717)\n* @gankra [elevate privileges for custom publish jobs](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/722)\n* @mistydemeo [tighten minimum glibc requirements in shell installer](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/727)\n* @gankra [add announcement_tag_is_implicit as a --dry-run signal to dist-manifest](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/725)\n* @mistydemeo [don't print warnings in some tests, making them run more reliable in some setups](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/730)\n\n# Version 0.7.2 (2024-01-15)\n\nThis release contains a fix for certain ARM64 Linux builds.\n\n## Fixes\n\nFixes a regression caused by an overly-strict check for the exit status of `ldd`.

This feature let you customize the CI process with your own jobs at publish-time without having to edit cargo-dist's generated CI scripts, but it was limited to just that one phase. This release expands on that by adding hooks for a number of other steps of the build process. This enables fine-grained customization without having to touch any of the generated scripts. The phases at which custom jobs are available are:\n\n* plan (the beginning of the build process)\n* build-local-artifacts\n* build-global-artifacts\n* host (pre-publish)\n* publish\n* post-announce (after the release is created)\n\n* impl @mistydemeo\n    * [feat(ci): custom steps for other phases](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/632)\n    * [feat(ci): post-announce jobs](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/683)\n\n\n# Version 0.6.4 (2024-01-04)\n\nThis is a minor release which makes internal changes to our packaging process. The actual cargo-dist program is unchanged from 0.6.3.\n\n\n# Version 0.6.3 (2024-01-02)\n\nThis is a minor release to update dependencies and add some cli flags for init.\n\n* @Gankra [add --hosting flag to init to streamline that workflow](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/668)\n* @illicitonion [Fix image reference in docs](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/670)\n* @mistydemeo [attempt to more aggressively flush streams for github CI](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/679)\n\n# 0.6.2 (2023-12-21)\n\nThis is a minor bugfix release.\n\n## Fixes\n\n### Upload final dist-manifest.json to Axo Releases\n\nFixes an issue where the non-merged `dist-manifest.json` was being uploaded to Axo Releases instead of the final, merged manifest. This issue didn't affect users of GitHub releases.\n\n* impl @Gankra [fix: properly upload the \"final\" dist-manifest to axo releases](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/665)\n\n\n# 0.6.1 (2023-12-20)\n\nThis is a minor bugfix release.\n\n## Features\n\n### Improvements to liblzma integration\n\nThis release removes an external dependency on liblzma on certain platforms.\n\nWe integrate compressed artifact support from the [axoasset](https://github.com/axodotdev/axoasset) crate. A quirk in a dependency we use means that cargo-dist builds would dynamically link against an external liblzma, but only if it was found in the build environment. As a result, some of our binaries use liblzma from the system and others use an embedded static build. This release unifies the behaviour so that every target uses a static build.\n\nThis shouldn't affect most users; we've made this change primarily for consistency. It does, however, ensure that the x86_64 macOS binaries are compatible with a wider variety of systems than they were in the past.\n\n* impl @mistydemeo\n    * [feat: use xz2 static feature](https://github.com/axodotdev/axoasset/pull/74)\n    * [chore: update axoasset](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/657)\n\n## Fixes\n\n### Extra artifacts would always be built\n\nA bug in our build configuration meant that we would always build extra artifacts when they're configured, even for local-only builds. They're now built only at the appropriate time.\n\n* impl @mistydemeo [fix(extra artifacts): avoid inappropriate builds](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/661)\n\n# 0.6.0 (2023-12-18)\n\nThe headlining features of this release are:\n\n* Support for specifying arbitrary GitHub Actions Runners\n* The ability to build and upload extra artifacts along side your main build\n\nWe also now distribute aarch64 Linux binaries, which makes it easier to use cargo-dist to build software on aarch64 hosts.\n\n## Features\n\n### Custom Runners in GitHub Actions\n\nThis adds support for specifying which runners to use in GitHub CI. This is useful in order to allow cargo-dist to use paid runners, rather than the free runners it defaults to, and to force Linux builds to use a newer version of Ubuntu. By using paid runners, it's also possible to create builds running on ARM64 hosts.\n\n* impl @milesj [Support custom github runners (and arm64)](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/614)\n\nThanks to @milesj for contributing this!\n\n### Build and Host Extra Artifacts\n\nThis feature makes it possible to build and upload extra artifacts beyond what the primary build produces. For example, cargo-dist uses this to build and upload its `dist-manifest-schema.json` to each release. You can use this feature to help build and upload docs, manage extra assets for your release, and more.\n\n* impl @mistydemeo [feat: extra build artifacts](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/613)\n\n### Generic Builds Now Set CC/CXX Environment Variables\n\nIn generic builds, the `CC` and `CXX` environment variables are now set to platform-appropriate compilers. This is mainly applicable to software written in C and C++.\n\n* impl @mistydemeo [feat: set CC/CXX in generic builds](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/616)\n\n### Installer improvements\n\nThe installer now updates additional shell configuration files, ensuring that users are able to use your software after installing. The installer now also respects the `ZDOTDIR` configuration variable when run in the zsh shell.\n\n* impl @mistydemeo\n    * [feat(installer): add additional shell config](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/555)\n    * [fix(installer): only print source once](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/641)\n    * [fix: handle unset ZDOTDIR better](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/640)\n\n## Improvements\n\n### Generic build output\n\nstdout from generic build tasks is now merged with stderr at the time the job is run instead of printed separately after the build completes.\n\n* impl @mistydemeo [feat(generic): adjust stdout=>stderr redirect](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/649)\n\n## Fixes\n\n### \"Broken pipe\" message in install script\n\nFixes an issue where the installer script could report a spurious \"broken pipe\" message in Linux. Note that this didn't affect the installer's behaviour; it still worked as expected.\n\n* impl @rotu [Fix ldd broken pipe error](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/627)\n\n### Better installation failure handling in CI\n\nIn the rare case that installing cargo-dist failed in CI, the build would formerly continue anyway and fail in a more confusing way. This has been corrected so that the build now fails immediately.\n\n* impl @mistydemeo [fix(ci): fail fast if installer is missing](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/618)\n\n### Source tarball fixes\n\nGenerating source tarballs will now be skipped if the workspace being built isn't a git repository. It will also be skipped if git isn't installed.\n\n* impl @mistydemeo\n    * [fix: check for git presence before calling](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/648)\n    * [fix: check for git presence before calling](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/648)\n\n### Improved error reporting in Powershell installer\n\nThe Windows Powershell installer now provides better error output on the terminal.\n\n* impl @mistydemeo + @gankra [fix(powershell): replace errors with throw](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/651)\n\n\n# Version 0.5.0 (2023-11-27)\n\nThis release was probably going to be several releases, but everything got finished at the same time, so here's a Mega Release!\n\nThe headline features are:\n\n* New Support For Axo Releases, As An Alternative To Github Releases (Launching Soon™)\n* New Support For Generic Build Steps, In Any Language (Experimental)\n* Significantly Improved MSI Installer Support\n\n## Features\n\n### Axo Releases\n\nAxo Releases users can now enable builtin cargo-dist support by setting\n\n`hosting = [\"axodotdev\"]`\n\nin their `[workspace.metadata.dist]`.\n\nTo sign up for the Axo Releases closed beta, go to https://dash.axo.dev/\n\nYou can ask for more details by [joining our discord](https://discord.gg/ECnWuUUXQk) or sending a message to `hello@axo.dev`!\n\nAxo Releases has a more robust pipelined model for creating and hosting a release, which more\nclosely matches the actual design of cargo-dist. But since we'd only ever supported Github Releases,\nsome significant internal reckoning was required.\n\nThis reckoning primarily appears in the existence of the new \"cargo dist host\" subcommand, which\nwas created to make \"side-effectful networking\" explicit, instead of riddling several random commands\nwith various --dry-run flags.\n\n`host` takes several --steps:\n\n* create: ask Axo Releases to create hosting for the Apps we want to publish\n* upload: upload built Artifacts to the hosting that `create` made\n* release: create Releases for the hosted artifacts, making perma-urls like /v1.0.0/ live\n* announce: announce all the Releases, wiring them into \"list all releases\" and \"latest release\" endpoints\n* check: equivalent to `create` but just checks that authentication is properly setup, without side-effects\n\nThe distinction between upload, release, and announce in particular lets us provide a more\nreliable/transactional release process -- we can make the hosting live, publish to package managers,\nand *then* update URLs like /latest/ once everything works, instead of racily doing it all\nat once and having to frantically hack things back to normal when something weird happens.\nIt should also make it possible for us to provide features like Release/PR Previews.\n\n* docs\n    * [hosting config](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html#hosting)\n* impl\n    * @gankra [preparatory refactor](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/546)\n    * @gankra [create gazenot client library](https://github.com/axodotdev/gazenot)\n    * @mistydemeo [break tag parsing into \"axotag\" crate](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/567)\n    * @gankra [properly set announcement body for abyss](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/586)\n    * @mistydemeo [add a comment about Axo Releases beta](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/600)\n    * @gankra [cleanup github releases / ci contents](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/596)\n\n\n### Generic Builds\n\n0.5.0 contains experimental support for building non-cargo-based projects. These can be in any language, and follow any repository layout, so long as they're accompanied by a cargo-dist manifest file that provides information on how to build and install it. For more information, consult the documentation.\n\n* docs\n    * [guide](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/generic-builds.html)\n    * [example npm project](https://github.com/axodotdev/axolotlsay-js)\n    * [example C project](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist-c-example)\n* impl\n    * @mistydemeo [add generic project type](https://github.com/axodotdev/axoproject/pull/45)\n    * @mistydemeo [handle missing PackageId](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/549)\n    * @mistydemeo [implement generic builds](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/553)\n    * @mistydemeo [rebase fixup](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/569)\n    * @mistydemeo [print stdout from generic builds](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/570)\n    * @mistydemeo [fix --artifacts=global with generic builds](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/573)\n\n\n### MSI\n\nWe've contributed several upstream improvements to cargo-wix, the tool we use to build MSIs, and integrated\nthat functionality back into cargo-dist.\n\nWhere previously you needed to use cargo-wix CLI flags to set various images in your installers,\nthey are now exposed in `[package.metadata.wix]` as well as `banner`, `dialog`, and `product-icon`.\n\nThere are now also `eula` and `license` configs on `[package.metadata.wix]` that allow you to specify\nwhere to source the eula/license from, and also allow you to explicitly disable auto-eula/auto-license\nfunctionality with `eula = false` and `license = false`. `cargo dist init` will by default set those\nto false if it sees they aren't defined in `[package.metadata.wix]` yet, making things more well-behaved\nby default. To restore the old auto-eula behaviour, set them to `true`.\n\nIn addition, significant refactoring was done to the eula/license backend of cargo-wix so that cargo-dist\ncan properly understand when those files need to be auto-generated. Previously auto-generated licenses/eulas\nwould just produce broken templates, because cargo-dist wouldn't know about them and get confused.\n\n* docs\n    * [cargo-wix docs](https://volks73.github.io/cargo-wix/cargo_wix/#configuration)\n    * [cargo-dist msi docs](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/installers/msi.html)\n* impl\n    * @gankra [refactor eulas and add new config](https://github.com/volks73/cargo-wix/pull/247)\n    * @gankra [add config for setting installer images](https://github.com/volks73/cargo-wix/pull/250)\n    * @gankra [use new cargo-wix features](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/503)\n\n\n### Source Tarballs\n\ncargo-dist will now generate its own source tarballs, and upload them to your release, named \"source.tar.gz\". The source tarballs that github provides are actually generated on demand with unspecified settings, so to ensure both Axo Releases and Github Releases have access to the same results, we need cargo-dist to generate the source tarball itself. We use the same mechanism as Github (asking git itself to generate them), but we can't bitwise-identically reproduce their (unspecified, technically-not-guaranteed) behaviour.\n\n* @mistydemeo [impl](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/604)\n\n\n## Maintenance/Fixes\n\n* @rukai [Remove rust-toolchain-version from the workspaces setup guide](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/578)\n* @jwodder [Give \"upload-local-artifacts\" jobs friendlier display names](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/557)\n\n\n# Version 0.4.3 (2023-11-08)\n\nThis is a small bugfix release which resolves an issue where we would sometimes generate non-working Homebrew installers.\n\n* @mistydemeo [Homebrew: Fixed an issue where generated class names might not match the name Homebrew looks for](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/554)\n\n# Version 0.4.2 (2023-10-31)\n\nJust a little release to get a couple small fixes in people's hands!\n\n* @mistydemeo [Linkage report: Fixed an issue where Linux libraries not associated with an apt package would be followed by ()](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/525)\n* @gankra [Includes: check for existence of included files/dirs as late as possible to allow build.rs to generate them](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/528)\n\n(This is a rerelease of 0.4.1, because that one wasn't properly rebased to include all the advertised fixes.)\n\n# Version 0.4.1 (2023-10-30)\n\n(See 0.4.2 for the actual release)\n\nJust a little release to get a couple small fixes in people's hands!\n\n* @mistydemeo [Linkage report: Fixed an issue where Linux libraries not associated with an apt package would be followed by ()](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/525)\n* @gankra [Includes: check for existence of included files/dirs as late as possible to allow build.rs to generate them](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/528)\n\n\n# Version 0.4.0 (2023-10-25)\n\nThis release contains several major features related to package dependencies. cargo-dist can now install dependencies for you in CI, ensure your users have those dependencies in their installers, and provide you insights into what external libraries your package links against! It also enables support for statically-built musl binaries on Linux.\n\n## Features\n\n### Install custom dependencies\n\nWay back in our [very first blog post](https://blog.axo.dev/2023/02/cargo-dist), we wrote about how users could customize the GitHub CI scripts we output to install custom dependencies. As of cargo-dist 0.4.0, you won't need to do that anymore! System dependencies &mdash; that is, dependencies installed via the system's package manager instead of `cargo` &mdash; can now be specified in your cargo-dist config in `Cargo.toml` using a syntax very similar to how your `cargo` dependencies are specified. For example:\n\n```toml\n[workspace.metadata.dist.dependencies.homebrew]\ncmake = { targets = [\"x86_64-apple-darwin\"] }\nlibcue = \"2.2.1\"\n\n[workspace.metadata.dist.dependencies.apt]\ncmake = '*'\nlibcue-dev = { version = \"2.2.1-2\" }\n```\n\nFor more information, see the [documentation](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html#dependencies).\n\n* impl\n    * @mistydemeo [initial impl](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/428)\n    * @mistydemeo [improve Homebrew integration](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/504)\n\n\n### Find out what your builds linked against\n\nComplementing the ability to specify system dependencies, we've added a new feature that lets you tell which libraries your Rust programs have dynamically linked against. While most Rust software is statically linked, installing external dependencies may mean that your software links against something on the system; you can visualize which libraries your software uses, and which packages they come from, by viewing the output of the build step in CI.\n\nIn addition, cargo-dist now uses this information to choose which dependencies to specify when building system package manager installers such as a Homebrew formula. If cargo-dist detects that your binary links against a package provided by Homebrew, it will ensure that a user who `brew install`s your package will also get that other package.\n\nThis feature has full support for macOS and Linux. On Windows, we're not able to list which package a system library comes.\n\n* impl\n    * @mistydemeo [initial impl](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/426)\n    * @mistydemeo [infer dependencies via linkage](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/475)\n    * @mistydemeo [fetch full name of Homebrew tap](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/474)\n    * @mistydemeo [improve apt package resolution](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/495)\n\n\n### musl support\n\nThis release adds support for a long-requested feature, creating Linux binaries statically linked against musl instead of glibc. These can be enabled adding the `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` target triple to your list of desired targets.\n\nNote that because these binaries are statically linked, they cannot dynamically link against any other C libraries &mdash; including C libraries installed using the system dependency feature mentioned above. If your software links against system libraries, please ensure that a static library is available to the build.\n\n* impl\n    * @mistydemeo [initial impl](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/483)\n    * @gankra + @mistydemeo [use musl binaries in installers](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/497)\n\n### msvc-crt-static opt-out\n\ncargo-dist has [always forced +crt-static on, as it is considered more correct for targeting Windows with the typical statically linked Rust binary](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1721-crt-static.md). However with the introduction of initial support for chocolatey as a system package manager, it's now very easy for our users to dynamically link other DLLs. Once you do, [it once again becomes more correct to dynamically link the windows crt, and to use systems like Visual C(++) Redistributables](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/issues/496).\n\nAlthough we [would like to teach cargo-dist to handle redistributables for you](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/issues/496), we're starting with a simple escape hatch: if you set `msvc-crt-static = false` in `[workspace.metadata.dist]`, we'll revert to the typical Rust behaviour of dynamically linking the CRT.\n\n* @gankra [impl](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/507)\n* [docs](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html#msvc-crt-static)\n\n\n# Version 0.3.1 (2023-09-28)\n\nThis is a minor bugfix release which fixes an issue certain builds would encounter on Windows.\n\n## Fixes\n\n### Windows builds run under Powershell\n\nStarting in version 0.3.0, we switched Windows builds to run under bash instead of Powershell. This introduced problems for certain builds, so we've switched them back to Powershell.\n\nThe majority of users will not be affected by this and will not need to upgrade; this primarily affects a limited number of users building software with libraries or dependencies which are sensitive to the shell in which they're built. For example, users building OpenSSL on Windows as a part of their cargo-dist build may have been affected.\n\n* @frol + @mistydemeo [impl](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/461)\n\n\n# Version 0.3.0 (2023-09-27)\n\nThis release is a big overhaul of cargo-dist's UX! [Our CI scripts have been completely redesigned](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/introduction.html#distributing) to allow your release process to be tested in pull-requests, so you don't have to worry as much about your release process breaking!\n\nSince we can now test your release process frequently, we've also made most cargo-dist commands default to erroring out if anything is out of sync and needs to be regenerated.\n\nTo make this easier, we've also introduced an experimental new system for [user-defined hooks](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/ci/github.html#custom-jobs), allowing you to write custom publish jobs without having to actually edit release.yml.\n\nThis release also introduces initial support for msi installers with the wonderful help of [cargo-wix](https://github.com/volks73/cargo-wix)!\n\n\n\n## Features\n\n### CI redesign\n\nThis is the big ticket item of the release, the CI has been completely redesigned! We recommend reading the docs below for details, but some high-level details:\n\n* The CI now runs `cargo dist plan` on pull-requests\n* This can be cranked up to `cargo dist build`, with results uploaded to the PR workflow, allowing you to download+test them\n* To do this, we now use GitHub's upload-artifact/download-artifact system, instead of using a draft GitHub release as scratch storage\n* This means we also no longer create a draft Release on startup, and instead transactionally create the full Release at the very end\n* `cargo dist plan` will now check that the CI script is up to date and not hand-edited (can be opted out)\n    * The user-defined publish jobs feature helps you avoid hand-edits\n    * More such features are in the pipeline for the next release!\n\n* impl\n    * @mistydemeo + @gankra [initial impl](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/378)\n    * @gankra [cleanup init logic](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/392)\n    * @mistydemeo [use checkout@v4](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/442)\n    * @mistydemeo [add docs](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/443)\n\n* docs\n    * [high-level summary](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/introduction.html#distributing)\n    * [detailed docs](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/ci/github.html)\n\n### user-defined publish jobs\n\nYou can now define custom hand-written publish jobs that cargo-dist's CI will know how to invoke, without actually having to hand-edit release.yml!\n\n* @mistydemeo [impl](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/417)\n* [docs](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/ci/github.html#custom-jobs)\n\n### default to not publishing prereleases to homebrew\n\nHomebrew doesn't have a notion of package \"versions\", there is Only The Latest Version, so we changed the default to only publishing to your homebrew tap if you're cutting a stable release. You can opt back in to the old behaviour with `publish-prereleases = true`.\n\n* @mistydemeo [impl](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/401)\n* [docs](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html#publish-prereleases)\n\n### generate command\n\nThis feature is a bit of an internal affair that you don't necessarily need to care about, but it's big enough that we figured it's worth mentioning.\n\nThe \"plumbing\" `generate-ci` command which is invoked by `cargo dist init` has been reworked into a more general `generate` command, as the introduction of msi installers means we now have two kinds of checked-in generated output.\n\nMost notably, `generate --check` now exists, which produces an error if `generate` would change the contents (ignoring newline-style). **Most cargo-dist commands now run `generate --check` on startup, making it an error to have your release.yml out of date or hand-edited**. This is a key piece to the puzzle of the new CI design, as it lets you catch issues with your release process in PRs.\n\nThe `allow-dirty = [\"ci\"]` config was introduced to disable these `generate` modifying or checking release.yml, for users that still really need to hand-edit. We're actively working on several features that should make it less necessary to do hand-edits.\n\n* impl\n    * @mistydemeo [initial impl](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/381)\n    * @gankra [generalize for msi](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/391)\n    * @gankra [improved --allow-dirty behaviour](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/397)\n    * @mistydemeo [default to --artifacts=all in generate](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/410)\n    * @gankra [ignore newline style when checking file equality](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/414)\n    * @mistydemeo [hide generate-ci alias command](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/434)\n    * @gankra [cleanup more references to generate-ci](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/444)\n* docs\n    * [generate cli command](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/reference/cli.html#cargo-dist-generate)\n    * [allow-dirty config](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/reference/config.html#allow-dirty)\n\n### msi installer\n\nInitial msi installer support is here, based on the wonderful [cargo-wix](https://volks73.github.io/cargo-wix/cargo_wix/).

Installers have rapidly grown from \"something we're trying out\" to \"the star of the show\", so they're now front-and-center with room for their own guides.\n\nThis was a big undertaking, and not everything has been reworked yet. Further improvements will be done more incrementally.\n\n* @gankra [big docs overhaul](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/451)\n* @mistydemeo [don't suggest --profile in install instructions](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/404)\n* @tshepang [make search more useful](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/386)\n* @tshepang [remove stray char](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/388)\n\n\n# Version 0.2.0 (2023-08-30)\n\nThis release includes a bunch of features that resolve several of our user's needs.\n\n* Support for creating Homebrew packages on macOS and automatically uploading them to a private tap\n* Ability to specify `--features` your application should be built with for production releases\n* Ability to use more tag formats like `0.1.0`, `releases/v0.1.0`, `my-app/1.0.0`, etc.\n* Ability to Bring Your Own Github Release (BYOGR) that cargo-dist uploads to\n\nIn the background of these changes we've also been working on improving some of the architecture\nof cargo-dist to make it easier to add new installers and publishing steps.\n\n## Features\n\n### Homebrew Formula Support\n\nGenerating a Homebrew formula can be enabled by adding `\"homebrew\"` to the list\nof installers in `Cargo.toml`.

For instance if your main package is both a library and an application, and you prefer to keep the library as the default for people depending on it. If all the \"app\" functionality is hidden behind a feature called \"cli\", then `features = [\"cli\"]` in `[package.metadata.dist]` will do what you want.\n\nIf you enable any of these features, we may automatically turn on `precise-builds` to satisfy the requirements.\n\nSee the docs for all the details.\n\n* @gankra + @Yatekii [impl](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/321)\n* docs\n    * [features](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/config.html#features)\n    * [all-features](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/config.html#all-features)\n    * [default-features](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/config.html#default-features)\n    * [precise-builds](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/config.html#precise-builds)\n\n### Tag Formats\n\ncargo-dist's git tag parser has been made much more robust and permissive:\n\n* You can now prefix release tags with anything preceding a '/'\n* The 'v' prefix on a version is now optional\n* You can now use package-name/v1.0.0 instead of package-name-v1.0.0\n\nPutting this all together, all of these formats are now allowed:\n\n* unified (release everything with the given version)\n  * v1.0.0\n  * 1.0.0\n  * blah/blah/v1.0.0\n  * whatever/1.0.0\n* precise (release only this one package)\n  * package-name-v1.0.0\n  * package-name-1.0.0\n  * package-name/v1.0.0\n  * package-name/1.0.0\n  * blah/blah/package-name/v1.0.0\n  * blah/blah/package-name/1.0.0\n  * blah/blah/package-name-v1.0.0\n  * blah/blah/package-name-1.0.0\n\nAnd of course `-prerelease.1`-style suffixes can be added to any of those.\n\nThanks to @Sharparam for all the great work on the implementation and docs for this!\n\n* @Sharparam + @gankra [impl](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/346)\n* [docs](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/workspace-guide.html#announcement-tags)\n\n### Bring Your Own Github Release\n\nA new `create-release` config has been added, which makes cargo-dist interoperate with things like\n[release drafter](https://github.com/release-drafter/release-drafter/) which create a draft body/title\nfor your Github Release.\n\nWhen you set `create-release = false` cargo-dist will assume a draft Github Release for the current git tag already exists with the title/body you want, and just upload artifacts to it. At the end of a successful publish it will undraft the Github Release.\n\n* @gankra [impl](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/367)\n* [docs](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/config.html#create-release)\n\n\n### Enhanced Release Description\n\nThe table of release artifacts has been improved and now resembles the version\nin oranda.\n\n* @mistydemeo [impl](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/357)\n\n## Fixes\n\n* @mistydemeo [Fix a typo in deprecated rustup update lines](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/342)\n* @gankra [Fixes handling of cargo --message-format](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/363)\n* @mistydemeo [Fixes handling repository URLs that end in .git](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/298).\n\n## Maintenance\n\nThanks to everyone who contributed docs and cleanups, the real MVPs!!!\n\n* @Sharparam [remove unreachable code in installer.sh](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/345)\n* @orhun [update instructions for Arch Linux](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/326)\n* @tshepang [various](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/375) [fixes](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/328) [throughout](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/330) [the docs](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/331)\n\n\n\n# Version 0.1.0 (2023-08-11)\n\nThe standout features of this release are custom install paths (\"install my app to `~/.my-app` and add that to PATH\"), archive checksums (releases should now include `my-app.tar.xz.sha256`), and refined builds (builds are more fault-tolerant, lower latency, and you can opt out of building `--workspace`).\n\nTo update your cargo-dist config and release.yml [install cargo dist 0.1.0](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/) and run `cargo dist init` (you should also remove rust-toolchain-version from your config, it's deprecated).\n\nThe codebase also got some major cleanups to make it easier to contribute and iterate on installers. All templates are now migrated to jinja2 (as opposed to adhoc string replace), and we have integration tests that can validate that installers work as intended.\n\n\n\n## Features\n\n### custom install paths\n\nOne of our most frequently requested features is here, custom install paths! (And also installers adding things to PATH!)\n\nWhen using cargo-dist's script installers (`shell` and `powershell`), we need to unpack the binaries to somewhere that will be useful for the user. By default cargo-dist will install to `$CARGO_HOME` (`~/.cargo/bin/`), because for our userbase (and many CI environments) that tends to be a user-local directory that's already on PATH (and yes we now properly check and respect `$CARGO_HOME`!).\n\nWith this feature not only can you customize where binaries get installed to, but the installer scripts now also understand how to check if that directory is on PATH, and if not register it in the appropriate places (and tell the user how to refresh PATH).\n\nThe new install-path config currently takes 3 possible formats (that we will surely expand with a lot more options very quickly):\n\n* \"CARGO_HOME\": explicitly requests the default behaviour\n* \"~/.myapp/some/subdir\": install to the given subdirectory of $HOME\n* \"$MY_ENV_VAR/some/subdir/\" install to the given subdirectory of $MY_ENV_VAR\n\n(Note that `$HOME/some/subdir` is not equivalent to `~/some/subdir` for various reasons, just always use the latter and we'll take care of those details for you.)\n\nSee the docs for finer details, caveats, and future plans.\n\n* docs\n    * [install-path](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/config.html#install-path)\n    * [shell installer](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/installers.html#shell)\n    * [powershell installer](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/installers.html#powershell)\n* impl\n    * @gankra [add install-path](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/284)\n    * @gankra [teach scripts to edit PATH](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/293)\n\n\n### archive checksums\n\nBy default all archives will get a paired checksum file generated and uploaded to the release (default sha256). So for instance if you produce `my-app-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz` then there will also be `my-app-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz.sha256`. This can be configured with the new `checksum` config.\n\n* [docs](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/config.html#checksum)\n* @gankra [impl](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/243)\n\n\n\n### refined builds\n\nSeveral changes were made to the way we build your projects, and more knobs were added to the `[workspace.metadata.dist]` config to allow you to tune the build to suit your needs.\n\nBy default we now:\n\n* Build all target platforms on separate machines/tasks, improving concurrency and fault-tolerance (**GitHub Releases should now be twice as fast!**). Previously we would attempt to merge tasks to reduce the number of machines, infamously making both x64 mac and arm64 mac share a machine, doubling the latency of releases. You can get the old behaviour by setting `merge-tasks = true`.\n\n* Allow all build tasks to continue running, even if one of them fails (the GitHub Release will only be auto-undrafted if *all* builds pass). This allows you to salvage as much of a release as possible if only one of your target platforms has a broken build, potentially manually rerunning the task. You can get the old behaviour be setting `fail-fast = true`.\n\n* Recursively checkout submodules when fetching your project to build (seems harmless if you don't need it, and makes us work with more projects).\n\n* Do not try to set the toolchain in rustup when rust-toolchain-version isn't set (and that config is now deprecated, so you should unset it). Pinning of compiler toolchains is really common in major projects like Firefox with dedicated release engineers, but it's kinda overkill for smaller projects. On balance we think letting your release toolchain silently update over time as your infra updates is a better default for most projects (especially since Rust is really good at stability). Anyone who really wants toolchain pinning would be better served by using rust-toolchain.toml (so that integration tests and local dev also check the toolchain used for releases).\n\nIn addition, you can now set `precise-builds = true` if you don't want us to build your apps with `--workspace`. There's a lot of complicated factors involved here but basically the difference is in how feature selection works in Cargo when you have multiple packages sharing a workspace. `--workspace` gets you a maximal default, precise-builds gets you a minimal default. For most projects there won't be a difference.\n\n* docs\n    * [precise-builds](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/config.html#precise-builds)\n    * [merge-tasks](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/config.html#merge-tasks)\n    * [fail-fast](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/config.html#fail-fast)\n    * [rust-toolchain-version](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/config.html#rust-toolchain-version)\n* impl\n    * @gankra [precise-builds + merge-tasks](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/277)\n    * @gankra [fail-fast](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/276)\n    * @gankra [recursively checkout submodules](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/248)\n    * @gankra [deprecate rust-toolchain-version](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/275)\n\n\n\n### orchestration features\n\nA few new CLI features were added to cargo-dist to enable more programmatic manipulation of it. These are mostly uninteresting to normal users, and exist to enable future axo.dev tools that build on top of cargo-dist.\n\n* `cargo dist init --with-json-config=path/to/config.json`\n    * [docs](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/cli.html#--with-json-config-with_json_config)\n    * @gankra [impl](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/279)\n* The dist-manifest-schema.json is now properly hosted in releases\n    * [docs](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/schema.html)\n    * @gankra [impl](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/280)\n\n\n### changelog \"Unreleased\" section\n\nWhen parsing your changelog, prereleases can now also match the special \"Unreleased\" heading,\nmaking it easier to keep a changelog for the upcoming release without committing to its version.\n\n* [docs](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/simple-guide.html#release-notes)\n* @gankra [impl](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/250)\n\n\n\n## Fixes\n\n### including directories\n\nThe `include` config will now work properly if you provide it a path to a directory\n(the functionality was stubbed out but never implemented).\n\n* [docs](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/config.html#include)\n* @gankra [impl](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/295)\n\n\n### release.yml license\n\nAt the request of end users, we've added a small legal notice at the top of the generated github release.yml file to indicate that the contents of the file are permissibly licensed. This hopefully makes it easier for package distributors and employees at large companies w/legal review to confidently use cargo-dist!\n\n* @gankra [impl](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/310)\n\n## Maintenance\n\n* codebase broken up into more files\n    * @gankra [impl](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/294)\n\n* more code pulled out to axoasset\n    * @gankra [impl](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/295)\n\n* migrated all generated files to jinja2 templates\n    * @gankra [impl](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/297)\n\n* added an integration test \"gallery\" of projects that use cargo-dist\n    * @gankra [initial impl](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/292)\n    * @gankra [improvements](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/296)\n    * @gankra [improvements](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/299)\n    * @gankra [improvements](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/300)\n    * @gankra [improvements](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/302)\n\n* other great cleanups/fixes\n    *  @striezel [fix typos](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/254)\n\n\n\n\n\n# Version 0.0.7 (2023-05-09)\n\nThis is just a quick little release that makes the npm package tarballs we can generate\nlook like \"properly\" packed tarballs that can be directly published to npm without unpacking them.\nThis allows you to `npm publish URL_TO_TARBALL` directly without any issues.\n\n@gankra [impl](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/246)\n\n\n\n\n# Version 0.0.6 (2023-05-03)\n\nThis release is a pretty big improvement to cargo-dist's UX!\n\n* `cargo dist init` is now interactive and useful for updating your config/install. This is especially useful for updating your project to a new version of cargo-dist, or enabling new installers, as the interactive UI will automatically prompt you to do so and help you keep your config coherent. It also reduces the chances of your CI script getting out of sync, as it runs generate-ci at the end for you.

(This is just a synonym for `cargo dist manifest` but with nicer defaults for what you *usually* want.)\n    * [docs](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/way-too-quickstart.html#check-what-ci-will-build)\n    * impl\n        * @gankra [initial impl as \"status\"](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/230)\n        * @gankra [rename \"status\" to \"plan\"](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/232)\n\n* Bare `cargo dist` is no longer a synonym for `build` and now just prints help. This makes it a bit nicer to get your footing with cargo-dist, as we don't suddenly do builds or complain about not being initialized on first run.\n    * @gankra [impl](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/230)\n\n* Artifact names no longer contain redundant version numbers, so `my-app-v1.0.0-installer.sh` is now just `my-app-installer.sh`.

Supported values include \".tar.gz\", \".tar.xz\", \".tar.zstd\", and \".zip\". The defaults (.zip on windows, .tar.xz elsewhere) are unchanged, as we believe those have the best balance of UX and compatibility.\n    * [docs](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/config.html#windows-archive)\n    * @gankra [impl](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/211)\n\n* other great cleanups/fixes\n    * @AlexITC [fix typo at README.md](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/203)\n    * @jwodder [remove trailing spaces from templates](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/213)\n    * @jwodder [fix broken links in book](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/215)\n    * @jwodder [remove useless uses of cat from release.yml](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/223)\n    * @gankra [factor out and use axoproject](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/207)\n    * @gankra [factor out and use axocli](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/209)\n    * @gankra [0.0.6 docs blitz](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/231)\n    * @gankra [fix config subsetting](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/pull/234)\n\n\n\n# Version 0.0.5 (2023-03-15)\n\nThis is a bug-fix release for an issue with cross-platform line endings that affected\nusers who installed cargo-dist with `cargo install`. Prebuilt binaries were unaffected.\nSpecifically folks reported in [#181] that they were seeing the Shell installer (for Mac and Linux)\nbe generated with mixed CRLF and LF line endings, which was causing both functionality\nand development issues (git churn).\n\nFor those unfamiliar- the line endings on Windows machines are different than those\non Mac and Linux ones and it can cause a lot of unfortunate chaos.\n\nThere are 2 styles of control characters to mark a line break in a text file:\n\n- `LF`, (`\\n`), Linux/Mac: `LF` stands for \"Line Feed\"\n- `CRLF`, (`\\r\\n`), Windows: `CR` stands for \"Carriage Return\"\n\nThe presence of CRLF line endings in a shell script will cause issues. Similarly LF\nline endings in a powershell script will cause issues. (Citation needed on the powershell\nthing but sure let's play it safe/idiomatic here.)\n\nThe problem was that the `.crate` uploaded to crates.io had CRLF endings in some templates\nbecause `cargo publish` was run on windows and the git repo was configured to checkout files\nwith platform-specific endings. The prebuilt binaries were checked out and built on linux\n(Github CI), and so only used LF endings.\n\nThe reason we got *mixed* LF and CRLF is because the contents of the installer scripts come from\nmixed sources: the bulk comes from template files on disk, but a few key lines are injected\nprogrammatically by rust code with `writeln` (and `write` with manual `\\n`). Note that Rust's\nprintln/writeln are guaranteed to emit LF on all platforms (because really CRLF should just be\nfazed out and platform-specific writeln would be a mess). This was good and desirable, the\nmain screw up was the line endings in the stored template being forwarded verbatim instead\nof all being rewritten to LF.\n\nTo be EXTRA SURE this doesn't happen in the future we just straight up rewrite all newlines\nbefore writing the final result, making the newlines stored in cargo-dist's git repo irrelevant.\n\n[181]: https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/issues/181\n\n# Version 0.0.4 (2023-03-03)\n\nThis is a smaller release than originally planned to get some platform support that was blocking folks out the door. Features that were originally planned for this one will ideally be part of the next release.\n\n* aarch64-apple-darwin (\"apple silicon\"/\"arm64 macos\") is now properly supported, and can be cross-compiled from x64 macos (and x64 can be crossed from arm64)\n    * if you have rustup installed we will `rustup target add` before attempting the build, as this is the only requirement (thanks for making it easy, Apple!)\n    * add this target to your Cargo.toml before you `cargo dist regenerate-ci` to make sure the CI knows to build it!\n    * currently both mac builds will be multiplexed onto the same runner. this will increase latency of your releases but should reduce the total resource usage of your CI (by avoiding fixed overheads). We might make this configurable in the future, but if you care about Universal MacOS binaries which staple x64 and arm64 together, your build will end up looking like this anyway (not yet implemented).\n\n* added rosetta-style \"you don't have an arm64 build but you do have an x64 one, so we'll use that\" fallback to the powershell installer, as arm64 windows supports automatic emulation (and folks seems to recommend relying on that over bothering with arm64 windows builds at this point?)\n\n\n# Version 0.0.3 (2023-02-27)\n\nA major overhaul has been done to the design to rationalize some improperly defined features/behaviours. When you update to this version **we recommend following these MIGRATION INSTRUCTIONS**:\n\n1. (optional) delete `[profile.dist]` from your Cargo.toml\n2. run `cargo dist init --ci=github`\n3. run `cargo dist generate-ci`\n\nPerforming Step 1 will result in Step 2 getting you our new recommended default profile; linux users were having issues with the debuginfo stuff.\n\nStep 2 will introduce default configuration to your Cargo.toml that's necessary for the new design to work reliably. You can add `--installer=shell` and `--installer=powershell` here if you want those to be setup automatically.\n\nStep 3 will completely blow away your release.yml CI with the new design. The overall approach is the same but everything is more consistent and coherent.\n\nThe new design is described in detail in [the new cargo-dist book](https://axodotdev.github.io/cargo-dist/book/)!\n\n\n## Configuration\n\nYou can now include persistent configuration for cargo-dist in `[workspace.metadata.dist]` and `[package.metadata.dist]`. [See the book for details](https://axodotdev.github.io/cargo-dist/book/config.html#metadatadist).\n\n## Artifact Modes\n\nPreviously cargo-dist had some vague notions of what it was supposed to do when you invoked it, because there were platform-specific artifacts like executable-zips but also more platform-agnostic ones like installer scripts. This result in flags like `--no-builds` with messy semantics and hacks to filter out artifacts we \"don't want right now\" in the CI scripts (`--no-builds` was is removed in this release, it was busted).\n\nNow cargo-dist can produce well-defined subsets of all the possible artifacts with the `--artifacts` flag:\n\n> --artifacts = \"local\" | \"global\" | \"all\" | \"host\"\n>\n> Artifacts can be broken up into two major classes:\n>\n> * local: made for each target system (executable-zips, symbols, MSIs...)\n> * global: made once (curl-sh installers, npm package, metadata...)\n>\n> (\"all\" selects both of these at once)\n>\n> Having this distinction lets us run cargo-dist independently on multiple machines without collisions between the outputs by spinning up machines that run something like:\n>\n> * linux-runner1 (get full manifest): cargo-dist manifest --artifacts=all --output-format=json\n> * linux-runner2 (get global artifacts): cargo-dist --artifacts=global\n> * linux-runner3 (get linux artifacts): cargo-dist --artifacts=local --target=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\n> * windows-runner (get windows artifacts): cargo-dist --artifacts=local --target=x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\n>\n> If left unspecified, we will pick a fuzzier \"host\" mode that builds \"as much as possible\" for the local system. This mode is appropriate for local testing/debugging/demoing. If no --target flags are passed on the CLI then \"host\" mode will try to intelligently guess which targets to build for, which may include building targets that aren't defined in your metadata.dist config (since that config may exclude the current machine!).\n>\n> The specifics of \"host\" mode are intentionally unspecified to enable us to provider better out-of-the-box UX for local usage. In CI environments you should always specify one of the other three options!\n\nNote that the introduction of persistent Cargo.toml configuration is crucial to this semantic redesign, as it allows each invocation to be aware of the \"full\" set of artifacts across all platforms, and then filter down to it.\n\nIf you pass `--installer`, `--ci`, or `--target` this will replace the Cargo.toml value for all packages for that invocation. This is most useful for `--target` in conjunction with `--artifacts=local` as it lets us precisely select which platform-specific artifacts to build on the current machine (all 3 of these flags can be passed repeatedly).\n\n**WARNING!** If you specify --artifacts and --target, the selected targets can only be a *subset* of the ones defined in your Cargo.toml. This ensures `cargo dist --artifacts=global` has behaviour consistent with `cargo dist --artifacts=local --target=...`, as global artifacts need to be aware of all targets at once. \"host\" mode bypasses this restriction so that runs of cargo dist on developer machines can do *something* useful even if the Cargo.toml doesn't know about the host platform.\n\n\n## Announcement/Release Selection\n\nThere is also now a `--tag` flag for specifying the git tag to use for announcing a new release. This tag must have a specific format detailed below. The tag serves two purposes:\n\n* It specifies the subset of the workspace that we want to Announce/Release\n* When using CI, it becomes the unique ID for a Github Release, which is necessary for everything to correctly compute download URLs\n\n`cargo dist build` and `cargo dist manifest` now both require that you either specify a --tag that \"makes sense\", or that your workspace is simple enough for a tag to be computed for you. In CI, each git tag you push will create an independent run of cargo-dist's CI to make a Github Release for that tag, and each invocation of cargo-dist will have that tag passed to it, ensuring they all agree on the above details.\n\nThere are two kinds of tag formats that are accepted:\n\n* Unified Announcement: `v{VERSION}` selects all packages with the given version (v1.0.0, v0.1.0-prerelease, etc.)\n* Singular Announcement: `{PACKAGE-NAME}-v{VERSION}` selects only the given package (error if the version doesn't match)\n\nNote that other criteria may prevent a package from being selected: it has no binaries, it has dist=false, it has publish=false, etc. If you do not specify a --tag, cargo-dist will check if all still-selectable packages share a version, and if they do it will make a Unified Announcement for them (erroring otherwise).\n\nThese two modes support the following workflow:\n\n* Releasing a workspace with only one binary-having package (either mode works but Unified is Cleaner)\n* Releasing a workspace where all binary-having packages are versioned in lockstep (Unified)\n* Releasing an individual package in a workspace with its own independent versioning (Singular)\n* Releasing several packages in a workspace at once, but all independently (Push multiple Singular tags at once)\n\nBasically the one thing we can't deal with is you saying \"I would like a single coherent Announcement (Github Release) for packageA 0.1.0 and packageB 0.2.0\", because nothing really ties them together. If you disagree, please let us know how you think it can/should work!\n\nAlthough you *could* use extremely careful versioning in conjunction with Unified Announcements to release a weird subset of the packages in your workspace, you really *shouldn't* because the Github Releases will be incoherent (v0.1.0 has these random packages, v0.2.0 has these other random packages... huh?), and you're liable to create painful tag collisions.\n\n**WARNING!** cargo-release *largely* already generates tags that express these exact semantics, except for one annoying corner case (that I've found so far): if you have a non-virtual workspace (the root Cargo.toml is an actual package with child packages), it will always try to tag releases of the root package with a Unified Tag, even when using `--workspace`. This will not play well with cargo-dist. Initial testing suggests virtual workspaces behave much better.\n\n## Release Notes\n\nRelease notes are now temporarily simplified for reliability:\n\n* For the purposes of a top level Announcement (Github Release), notes are now no longer associated with the individual apps being published, meaning there's only one set of notes generated.\n\n* If you have a RELEASES* or CHANGELOG* file in the root of your workspace, we will assume these are the release notes for any Unified Announcement (see the previous section) and try to include the relevant section at the top of the Github Release. This is done with the [parse_changelog](https://github.com/taiki-e/parse-changelog) library. If parsing/lookup fails we continue on silently.\n\n* If the above process succeeds, the heading of the section we found will become the new title of the Github Release. For example, if we find `1.2.0` matches `# Version 1.2.0 (2023-01-25)`, the title of the Github Release will become \"Version 1.2.0 (2023-01-25)\".\n\n* If you are publishing `1.2.0-prerelease` and we don't find that in your RELEASES/CHANGELOG file, we will now also look for bare `1.2.0` (stripping the prerelease/build portions), on the assumption that these are the WIP release notes for the version you're prereleasing. This lets you iterate on a version without having to churn headings every time you want to cut a prerelease (we recommend including a parenthetical indicating the version is not yet released).\n\n* If the above explained deferring happens, we will modify the release note's title to include the prerelease suffix. This ensures they are easily identifiable as prereleases on GitHub's releases page.\n\n* We will no longer attempt to include your release notes for Singular Announcements (see the previous section). They will only get auto-generated installers/downloads sections. This is obviously suboptimal, and will be fixed, we just need to do design work on the proper way to handle those cases. (Please tell me in [issue #139](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist/issues/139)!)\n\n\n\n## Fixes\n\n* The generated Github CI script is now Valid YAML. The script ran fine, but it was rightfully angering YAML linters!\n* The generated Github CI now has a single unified \"build artifacts\" task with a shared matrix for global artifacts (shell script installers) and local artifacts (executable zips) (previously the \"global\" artifacts had their own weird task)\n* We now properly detect if `cargo dist init` has been run by checking for the presence of `[profile.dist]` in your root Cargo.toml\n* There are now top level fields in dist-manifest.json for release notes for the \"full announcement\" of all Releases. These fields should be preferred when generating e.g. the body of a Github Release, as they will behave more correctly when there are multiple Releases.\n* **If multiple binaries are defined by one Cargo package, they will now be considered part of the same \"app\" and bundled together in executable-zips.** Previously we would give each binary its own \"app\". The new behaviour matches how 'cargo install' works and is compatible with the expectations of 'cargo binstall'. You kinda have to go out of your way to shove multiple binaries under one package, so we figure if you do, we should respect it!\n* If a package specifies publish=false in its Cargo.toml, we will take this as a hint to not dist it. You can override this behaviour by setting `[package.metadata.dist] dist = true` in that Cargo.toml.\n* Installer artifacts are now properly prefixed with the id of the Release they're part of, preventing conflicts when doing multiple Releases at once (installer.sh => my-app-v1.0.0-installer.sh).\n* Installers now properly handle packages that define multiple binaries (installing all of them, just like cargo-install)\n* Installers now properly know the Github Release they are going to point to (previously they would guess based on the version of the package which was broken in complicated workflows)\n* --installer=github-shell and --installer=github-powershell have had the \"github-\" prefix removed. They now generically use the concept of an \"artifact download url\" which will be configurable in the future (for now it only gets populated if ci=github is set and your workspace has a coherent definition for \"repository\" in its Cargo.tomls).\n* We will error out if you try to run `cargo dist generate-ci` and the `cargo-dist-version` in your config doesn't match the version you're currently running\n* If you're running arm64 macos (\"apple silicon\"), shell installers will now try to fallback to installing x64 macos binaries if no arm ones are available (so Rosetta can deal with it)\n\n\n# Version 0.0.2 (2023-01-31)\n\ncargo-dist:\n\n* Added proper detection of README/LICENSE/RELEASES/CHANGELOG files, which are now copied to the root of executable-zips.\n    * We will defer to Cargo fields like \"readme\" and \"license-file\" if present\n    * Otherwise we will search the root directory of the package and the root directory of the workspace (preferring results from the former)\n* Release note handling:\n    * --ci=github will manually set the title and body of the Github Release\n    * The body is a generated listing of installers/downloads\n    * If your RELEASES/CHANGELOG parses with parse_changelog library we'll append the current release's notes to the body, and use the heading for the title\n    * If we don't parse your RELEASES/CHANGELOG we will default to a title of \"v{VERSION}\"\n\ncargo-dist-schema:\n\n* Changed PathBufs to Strings since the paths may be from a different OS and Rust Paths are generally platform-specific. Seemed like a ticking timebomb for some weird corner case.\n* Added \"changelog\" as a valid AssetKind\n* Added \"changelog_title\" and \"changelog_body\" to Release\n    * These are used to populate a Github Release\n* Added \"description\" to Artifact\n    * Currently just used to describe some installers\n* Made Artifact::name Optional to futureproof\n    * If None this indicates the artifact is purely informative and no file exists (i.e. \"you can install with cargo-binstall\")\n\n# Version 0.0.1 (2023-01-23)\n\nThis is the first alpha release of cargo-dist with some minimal functionality!\n\nThere are also a couple 0.0.1 prereleases that came before this one that exist to define a sort of \"bootstrapping history\" for the first \"real\" release's binary builds because I find it vaguely satisfying and you can't stop me.\n"

Here's some\nguiding principles for working with us:\n\n**1. File an issue first!**\n\nExcept for the absolute tiniest of PRs (e.g. a single typo fix), please file an\nissue before opening a PR. This can help ensure that the problem you are trying\nto solve and the solution you have in mind will be accepted. Where possible, we\ndon't want folks wasting time on directions we don't want to take the project.\n\n**2. Write tests, or at least detailed reproduction steps**\n\nIf you find a bug, the best way to prioritize getting it fixed is to open a PR\nwith a failing test! If you are opening a bug fix PR, please add a test to show\nthat your fix works.\n\n**3. Overcommunicate**\n\nIn all scenarios, please provide as much context as possible- you may not think\nit's important but it may be! \n\n**4. Patience**\n\nAxo is a very small company, it's possible that we may not be able to\nimmediately prioritize your issue. We are excite to develop a community of \ncontributors around this project, but it won't always be on the top of our to-do\nlist, even if we wish it could be.\n\nIf you haven't heard from us in a while and want to check in, feel free to\nat-mention @ashleygwilliams- but please be kind while doing so!\n\n## Running tests\n\nThe test suite can be run with `cargo test`. [insta](https://insta.rs/docs/cli/)\nis used for snapshots; after running the test suite, use `cargo insta review` to\nreview any changed snapshots.\n\nThe test suite cannot be run in parallel. Using an alternative test runner like\n`nextest` will cause unexpected behavior as tests will override each other's\nstate.\n"

Each installer could be (and sometimes is!) an entire standalone tool with its own documentation and ecosystem.\n\n\n## Distributing\n\nAs a distribution tool, dist gets to flex its biggest superpower: **it generates [its own CI scripts][ci-providers]**. For instance, enabling [GitHub CI][ci-providers] with `dist init` will generate release.yml, which implements the full pipeline of plan, build, host, publish, announce:\n\n* Plan\n    * Waits for you to push a git tag for a new version (v1.0.0, my-app-v1.0.0, my-app/1.0.0, ...)\n    * Selects what apps in your workspace to announce new releases for based on that tag\n    * Generates [a machine-readable manifest][manifest] with changelogs and build plans\n* Build\n    * Spins up machines for each platform you support\n    * Builds your [binaries and tarballs][tarballs]\n    * Builds [installers][] for your binaries\n* Publish:\n    * Uploads to package managers\n* Host + Announce:\n    * Creates (or edits) a GitHub Release\n    * Uploads build artifacts to the Release\n    * Adds relevant release notes from your RELEASES/CHANGELOG\n\n[tarballs]: https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/artifacts/archives.html\n[installers]: https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/installers/index.html\n[manifest]: https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/reference/schema.html\n[ci-providers]: https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/ci/index.html\n\n# Read The Book!\n\nWe've got all the docs you need over at the [dist book](https://axodotdev.github.io/cargo-dist/book/)!\n\n* [Introduction](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/introduction.html)\n* [Install](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/install.html)\n* [Way-Too-Quickstart](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/quickstart/index.html)\n* [Workspaces Guide](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/workspaces/index.html)\n* [Reference](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/reference/index.html)\n\n<div class=\"oranda-hide\">\n\n# Contributing\n\n## Updating Snapshots\n\ndist's tests rely on [cargo-insta](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-insta) for snapshot testing various\noutputs. This allows us to both catch regressions and also more easily review UI/output changes. If a snapshot\ntest fails, you will need to use the `cargo insta` CLI tool to update them:\n\n```sh\ncargo install cargo-insta\n```\n\nOnce installed, you can review and accept the changes with:\n\n```sh\ncargo insta review\n```\n\nIf you know you like the changes, just use `cargo insta accept` to auto-apply all changes.\n\n(If you introduced brand-new snapshot tests you will also have to `git add` them!)\n\n> NOTE: when it succeeds, cargo-dist-schema's `emit` test will actually commit the results back to disk to `cargo-dist-schema/cargo-dist-schema.json` as a side-effect. This is a janky hack to make sure we have that stored and up to date at all times (the test also uses an insta snapshot but insta snapshots include an extra gunk header so it's not something we'd want to link end users). The file isn't even used for anything yet, I just want it to Exist because it seems useful and important. In the future we might properly host it and have our outputs link it via a `$schema` field.\n\n## Cutting Releases\n\ndist is self-hosting, so you just need to push a git-tag with the right format to \"do\" a release. Of course there's lots of other tedious tasks that come with updating a release, and we use cargo-release to handle all those mechanical details of updating versions/headings/tags. See [these sections of the docs for the release workflow we use](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/workspaces/cargo-release-guide.html#using-cargo-release-with-pull-requests).\n\nTL;DR:\n\n* Update CHANGELOG.md's \"Unreleased\" section to include all the release notes you want\n* run cargo-release as described in the docs\n* ..you're done!\n\nNote that we've wired up dist and cargo-release to understand the \"Unreleased\" heading so you\nshould never edit that name, the tools will update it as needed.\n\nIf that releases succeeds, we recommend updating the bootstrap version of dist as a follow up:\n\n* install the version of dist you just released on your system\n* run `dist init --yes`\n* commit \"chore: update bootstrap dist to ...\"\n\nNote that as a consequence of the way we self-host, dist's published artifacts will always be built/generated by a previous version of itself. This can be problematic if you make breaking changes to cargo-dist-schema's format... so don't! Many things in the schema are intentionally optional to enable forward and backward compatibility, so this should hopefully work well!\n\n</div>\n"
