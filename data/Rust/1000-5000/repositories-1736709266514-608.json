We invite you to submit\npull requests as described below.\n\n## Pull Requests\nWe actively welcome your pull requests.\n\n1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.\n2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.\n3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.\n4. Ensure the test suite passes.\n5. Make sure your code lints.\n6. If you haven't already, complete the Contributor License Agreement (\"CLA\").\n\n## Contributor License Agreement (\"CLA\")\nIn order to accept your pull request, we need you to submit a CLA. You only need\nto do this once to work on any of Facebook's open source projects.\n\nComplete your CLA here: <https://code.facebook.com/cla>\n\n## Issues\nWe use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Please ensure your description is\nclear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.\n\nFacebook has a [bounty program](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/) for the safe\ndisclosure of security bugs. In those cases, please go through the process\noutlined on that page and do not file a public issue.\n\n## Coding Style\nUse [`rustfmt`](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt/) to format your\ncode. This means:\n\n* 4 spaces for indentation rather than tabs\n* 80 character line length recommended, up to 100 characters if necessary.\n\nThis project uses the `rustfmt` currently based on nightly Rust\n(`rustfmt-nightly` as of June 2017). For instructions on how to install it, see\nthe\n[`rustfmt` README](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustfmt/#installation).\n\n## License\nBy contributing to fastmod, you agree that your contributions will be licensed\nunder the LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.\n"

          "content": "# fastmod\n`fastmod` is a fast partial replacement for\n[codemod](https://github.com/facebook/codemod). Like `codemod`, it is\na tool to assist you with large-scale codebase refactors, and it\nsupports most of `codemod`'s options. `fastmod`'s major philosophical\ndifference from `codemod` is that it is focused on improving the use\ncase \"I want to use interactive mode to make sure my regex is correct,\nand then I want to apply the regex everywhere\". For this use case, it\noffers much better performance than `codemod`. Accordingly, `fastmod`\ndoes not support `codemod`'s `--start`, `--end`, or `--count` options,\nnor does it support anything like `codemod`'s Python API.\n\n## Examples\n\nLet's say you're deprecating your use of the `<font>` tag. From the\ncommand line, you might make progress by running:\n\n```\nfastmod -m -d /home/jrosenstein/www --extensions php,html \\\n    '<font *color=\"?(.*?)\"?>(.*?)</font>' \\\n    '<span style=\"color: ${1};\">${2}</span>'\n```\n\nFor each match of the regex, you'll be shown a colored diff and asked\nif you want to accept the change (the replacement of the `<font>` tag\nwith a `<span>` tag), reject it, or edit the line in question in your\n`$EDITOR` of choice.\n\nNOTE: Whereas `codemod` uses Python regexes, `fastmod` uses the Rust\n[regex](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex) crate, which supports a\nslightly different regex syntax and does not support look around or\nbackreferences. In particular, use `${1}` instead of `\\1` to get the\ncontents of the first capture group, and use `$$` to write a literal\n`$` in the replacement string. See the regex crate's\n[documentation](https://docs.rs/regex/#syntax) for details.\n\nA consequence of this syntax is that the use of single quotes instead\nof double quotes around the replacement text is important, because the\n`bash` shell itself cares about the `$` character in double-quoted\nstrings. If you must double-quote your input text, be careful to\nescape `$` characters properly!\n\n`fastmod` also offers a usability improvement over `codemod`: it\naccepts files or directories to process as extra positional arguments\nafter the regex and substitution. For instance, the example above\ncould have been rewritten as\n\n```\nfastmod -m --extensions php,html \\\n    '<font *color=\"?(.*?)\"?>(.*?)</font>' \\\n    '<span style=\"color: ${1};\">${2}</span>' \\\n    /home/jrosenstein/www\n```\n\nThis makes it possible to use `fastmod` to process a list of files\nfrom somewhere else if needed. Note, however, that `fastmod` does its\nown parallel directory traversal internally, so doing `find ... |\nxargs fastmod ...` may be much slower than using `fastmod` by itself.\n\n## Requirements\n\n`fastmod` is primarily supported on macOS and Linux.\n\n`fastmod` has also been reported to work reasonably well on\nWindows. The major portability concerns are 1) the use of `$EDITOR`\nwith a fallback and 2) the console UI, which is descended from\n`codemod`'s ncurses-based text coloring & screen clearing\ncode. Windows-specific issues and PRs will be considered as long as\nthey aren't too invasive. For example, if something doesn't work on\nWindows because a Linux/Mac-specific API was used instead of\nequivalent POSIX or Rust standard library calls, we would be happy to\nfix that. On the other hand, we would like to avoid taking a direct\n`winapi` dependency or substantially increasing the size of our\ndependency graph for Windows-only enhancements.\n\n## Building `fastmod`\n\n`fastmod` is written in (stable) [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)\nand compiles with Rust's `cargo` build system. To build:\n\n```\n$ git clone https://github.com/facebookincubator/fastmod.git\n$ cd fastmod\n$ cargo build --release\n$ ./target/release/fastmod --help\n...\n```\n\n## Installing fastmod\nThe easiest way to install fastmod is simply `cargo install\nfastmod`. If you have built `fastmod` from source following the\ndirections above, you can install your build with `cargo install`.\n\n## How `fastmod` works\n`fastmod` uses the\n[ignore](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/tree/master/crates/ignore)\ncrate to walk the given directory hierarchy using multiple threads in\nparallel while respecting `.gitignore`. It uses the\n[grep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/tree/master/crates/grep)\ncrate to match each file, reads matching files into memory, applies\nthe given regex substitution one match at a time, and uses the\n[diff](https://github.com/utkarshkukreti/diff.rs) crate to present the\nresulting changes as patches for human review.\n\n## Full documentation\n\nSee `fastmod --help`.\n\n## License\n`fastmod` is Apache-2.0-licensed.\n"
