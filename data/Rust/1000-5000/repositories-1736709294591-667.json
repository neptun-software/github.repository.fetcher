Tickets with issue reports of feature requests\n2. Documentation improvements\n3. Code (PR or PR Review)\n\nIn addition to submitting new PRs, we have a healthy tradition of community members helping review each other's PRs.\nDoing so is a great way to help the community as well as get more familiar with Rust and the relevant codebases.\n\nYou can find a curated\n[good-first-issue](https://github.com/apache/arrow-ballista/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)\nlist to help you get started.\n\n# Developer's Guide\n\nThis section describes how you can get started with Ballista development.\n\n## Bootstrap Environment\n\nBallista contains components implemented in the following programming languages:\n\n- Rust (Scheduler and Executor processes, Client library)\n\n### Rust Environment\n\nWe use the standard Rust development tools.\n\n- `cargo build`\n- `cargo fmt` to format the code\n- `cargo test` to test\n- etc.\n\nTesting setup:\n\n- `rustup update stable` DataFusion uses the latest stable release of rust\n\nFormatting instructions:\n\n- [ci/scripts/rust_fmt.sh](ci/scripts/rust_fmt.sh)\n- [ci/scripts/rust_clippy.sh](ci/scripts/rust_clippy.sh)\n- [ci/scripts/rust_toml_fmt.sh](ci/scripts/rust_toml_fmt.sh)\n\nor run them all at once:\n\n- [dev/rust_lint.sh](dev/rust_lint.sh)\n\n### Rust Process Configuration\n\nThe scheduler and executor processes can be configured using toml files, environment variables and command-line\narguments. The specification for config options can be found here:\n\n- [ballista/scheduler/scheduler_config_spec.toml](ballista/scheduler/scheduler_config_spec.toml)\n- [ballista/executor/executor_config_spec.toml](ballista/executor/executor_config_spec.toml)\n\nThose files fully define Ballista's configuration. If there is a discrepancy between this documentation and the\nfiles, assume those files are correct.\n\nTo get a list of command-line arguments, run the binary with `--help`\n\nThere is an example config file at [ballista/executor/examples/example_executor_config.toml](ballista/executor/examples/example_executor_config.toml)\n\nThe order of precedence for arguments is: default config file < environment variables < specified config file < command line arguments.\n\nThe executor and scheduler will look for the default config file at `/etc/ballista/[executor|scheduler].toml` To\nspecify a config file use the `--config-file` argument.\n\nEnvironment variables are prefixed by `BALLISTA_EXECUTOR` or `BALLISTA_SCHEDULER` for the executor and scheduler\nrespectively. Hyphens in command line arguments become underscores. For example, the `--scheduler-host` argument\nfor the executor becomes `BALLISTA_EXECUTOR_SCHEDULER_HOST`\n\n### Python Environment\n\nRefer to the instructions in the Python Bindings [README](./python/README.md)\n\n## Integration Tests\n\nThe integration tests can be executed by running the following command from the root of the repository.\n\n```bash\n./dev/integration-tests.sh\n```\n\n## How to format `.md` document\n\nWe are using `prettier` to format `.md` files.\n\nYou can either use `npm i -g prettier` to install it globally or use `npx` to run it as a standalone binary. Using `npx` required a working node environment. Upgrading to the latest prettier is recommended (by adding `--upgrade` to the `npm` command).\n\n```bash\n$ prettier --version\n2.3.0\n```\n\nAfter you've confirmed your prettier version, you can format all the `.md` files:\n\n```bash\nprettier -w README.md {ballista,ballista-cli,benchmarks,dev,docs,examples,python}/**/*.md\n```\n"

The community is working hard to close this gap\n\n```rust\nuse ballista::prelude::*;\nuse datafusion::prelude::*;\n\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() -> datafusion::error::Result<()> {\n  // create DataFusion SessionContext with ballista standalone cluster started\n  let ctx = SessionContext::standalone();\n\n  // register the table\n  ctx.register_csv(\"example\", \"tests/data/example.csv\", CsvReadOptions::new()).await?;\n\n  // create a plan to run a SQL query\n  let df = ctx.sql(\"SELECT a, MIN(b) FROM example WHERE a <= b GROUP BY a LIMIT 100\").await?;\n\n  // execute and print results\n  df.show().await?;\n  Ok(())\n}\n```\n\nIf you are looking for documentation or more examples, please refer to the [Ballista User Guide][user-guide].\n\n## Architecture\n\nA Ballista cluster consists of one or more scheduler processes and one or more executor processes. These processes\ncan be run as native binaries and are also available as Docker Images, which can be easily deployed with\n[Docker Compose](https://datafusion.apache.org/ballista/user-guide/deployment/docker-compose.html) or\n[Kubernetes](https://datafusion.apache.org/ballista/user-guide/deployment/kubernetes.html).\n\nThe following diagram shows the interaction between clients and the scheduler for submitting jobs, and the interaction\nbetween the executor(s) and the scheduler for fetching tasks and reporting task status.\n\n![Ballista Cluster Diagram](docs/source/contributors-guide/ballista_architecture.excalidraw.svg)\n\nSee the [architecture guide](docs/source/contributors-guide/architecture.md) for more details.\n\n## Performance\n\nWe run some simple benchmarks comparing Ballista with Apache Spark to track progress with performance optimizations.\nThese are benchmarks derived from TPC-H and not official TPC-H benchmarks. These results are from running individual\nqueries at scale factor 100 (100 GB) on a single node with a single executor and 8 concurrent tasks.\n\n### Overall Speedup\n\nThe overall speedup is 2.9x\n\n![benchmarks](docs/source/_static/images/tpch_allqueries.png)\n\n### Per Query Comparison\n\n![benchmarks](docs/source/_static/images/tpch_queries_compare.png)\n\n### Relative Speedup\n\n![benchmarks](docs/source/_static/images/tpch_queries_speedup_rel.png)\n\n### Absolute Speedup\n\n![benchmarks](docs/source/_static/images/tpch_queries_speedup_abs.png)\n\n# Getting Started\n\nThe easiest way to get started is to run one of the standalone or distributed [examples](./examples/README.md). After\nthat, refer to the [Getting Started Guide](ballista/client/README.md).\n\n## Project Status\n\nBallista supports a wide range of SQL, including CTEs, Joins, and subqueries and can execute complex queries at scale,\nbut still there is a gap between DataFusion and Ballista which we want to bridge in near future.\n\nRefer to the [DataFusion SQL Reference](https://datafusion.apache.org/user-guide/sql/index.html) for more\ninformation on supported SQL.\n\n## Contribution Guide\n\nPlease see the [Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for information about contributing to Ballista.\n\n[user-guide]: https://datafusion.apache.org/ballista/\n"

Initially for resiliency and fault tolerance but ultimately to support\n    sharding for scalability and more efficient caching.\n- Shuffle improvement\n  - Shuffle memory control ([#320](https://github.com/apache/arrow-ballista/issues/320))\n  - Improve shuffle IO to avoid producing too many files\n  - Support sort-based shuffle\n  - Support range partition\n  - Support broadcast shuffle ([#342](https://github.com/apache/arrow-ballista/issues/342))\n- Scheduler Improvements\n  - All-at-once job task scheduling\n  - Executor deployment grouping based on resource allocation\n- Cloud Support\n  - Support Azure Blob Storage ([#294](https://github.com/apache/arrow-ballista/issues/294))\n  - Support Google Cloud Storage ([#293](https://github.com/apache/arrow-ballista/issues/293))\n- Performance and scalability\n  - Implement Adaptive Query Execution ([#387](https://github.com/apache/arrow-ballista/issues/387))\n  - Implement bubble execution ([#408](https://github.com/apache/arrow-ballista/issues/408))\n  - Improve benchmark results ([#339](https://github.com/apache/arrow-ballista/issues/339))\n- Python Support\n  - Support Python UDFs ([#173](https://github.com/apache/arrow-ballista/issues/173))\n"
