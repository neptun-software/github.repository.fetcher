          "content": "# The Rust Code of Conduct\n\n## Conduct\n\n**Contact**: [HAL team][team]\n\n* We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other similar characteristic.\n* On IRC, please avoid using overtly sexual nicknames or other nicknames that might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.\n* Please be kind and courteous. There's no need to be mean or rude.\n* Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a right answer.\n* Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.\n* We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone. That is not welcome behavior. We interpret the term \"harassment\" as including the definition in the [Citizen Code of Conduct](http://citizencodeofconduct.org/); if you have any lack of clarity about what might be included in that concept, please read their definition. In particular, we don't tolerate behavior that excludes people in socially marginalized groups.\n* Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if you feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community member, please contact one of the channel ops or any of the [HAL team][team] immediately. Whether you're a regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about making this community a safe place for you and we've got your back.\n* Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome.\n\n## Moderation\n\nThese are the policies for upholding our community's standards of conduct.\n\n1. Remarks that violate the Rust standards of conduct, including hateful, hurtful, oppressive, or exclusionary remarks, are not allowed. (Cursing is allowed, but never targeting another user, and never in a hateful manner.)\n2. Remarks that moderators find inappropriate, whether listed in the code of conduct or not, are also not allowed.\n3. Moderators will first respond to such remarks with a warning.\n4. If the warning is unheeded, the user will be \"kicked,\" i.e., kicked out of the communication channel to cool off.\n5. If the user comes back and continues to make trouble, they will be banned, i.e., indefinitely excluded.\n6. Moderators may choose at their discretion to un-ban the user if it was a first offense and they offer the offended party a genuine apology.\n7. If a moderator bans someone and you think it was unjustified, please take it up with that moderator, or with a different moderator, **in private**. Complaints about bans in-channel are not allowed.\n8. Moderators are held to a higher standard than other community members. If a moderator creates an inappropriate situation, they should expect less leeway than others.\n\nIn the Rust community we strive to go the extra step to look out for each other. Don't just aim to be technically unimpeachable, try to be your best self. In particular, avoid flirting with offensive or sensitive issues, particularly if they're off-topic; this all too often leads to unnecessary fights, hurt feelings, and damaged trust; worse, it can drive people away from the community entirely.\n\nAnd if someone takes issue with something you said or did, resist the urge to be defensive. Just stop doing what it was they complained about and apologize. Even if you feel you were misinterpreted or unfairly accused, chances are good there was something you could've communicated better â€” remember that it's your responsibility to make your fellow Rustaceans comfortable. Everyone wants to get along and we are all here first and foremost because we want to talk about cool technology. You will find that people will be eager to assume good intent and forgive as long as you earn their trust.\n\nThe enforcement policies listed above apply to all official embedded WG venues; including official IRC channels (#rust-embedded); GitHub repositories under rust-embedded; and all forums under rust-embedded.org (forum.rust-embedded.org).\n\n*Adapted from the [Node.js Policy on Trolling](http://blog.izs.me/post/30036893703/policy-on-trolling) as well as the [Contributor Covenant v1.3.0](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/3/0/).*\n\n[team]: https://github.com/rust-embedded/wg#the-hal-team\n"

Check out the [announcement blog post](https://blog.rust-embedded.org/embedded-hal-v1/), the [API documentation](https://docs.rs/embedded-hal) and the [migration guide](docs/migrating-from-0.2-to-1.0.md).\n\n## Scope\n\n`embedded-hal` serves as a foundation for building an ecosystem of platform-agnostic drivers.\n(driver meaning library crates that let a target platform interface an external device like a digital\nsensor or a wireless transceiver).\n\nThe advantage of this system is that by writing the driver as a generic library on top\nof `embedded-hal` driver authors can support any number of target\nplatforms (e.g. Cortex-M microcontrollers, AVR microcontrollers, embedded Linux, etc.).\n\nThe advantage for application developers is that by adopting `embedded-hal` they can unlock all\nthese drivers for their platform.\n\nFor functionality that goes beyond what is provided by `embedded-hal`, users are encouraged\nto use the target platform directly. Abstractions of common functionality can be proposed to be\nincluded into `embedded-hal` as described [in this guide](docs/how-to-add-a-new-trait.md), though.\n\nSee more about the design goals in [this documentation section](https://docs.rs/embedded-hal/latest/embedded_hal/#design-goals).\n\n## Crates\n\nThe main  `embedded-hal` project is not tied to a specific execution model like blocking or non-blocking.\n\n| Crate | crates.io | Docs | |\n|-|-|-|-|\n| [embedded-hal](./embedded-hal)       | [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/embedded-hal.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/embedded-hal) | [![Documentation](https://docs.rs/embedded-hal/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/embedded-hal) | Core traits, blocking version |\n| [embedded-hal-async](./embedded-hal-async) | [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/embedded-hal-async.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/embedded-hal-async) | [![Documentation](https://docs.rs/embedded-hal-async/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/embedded-hal-async) | Core traits, async version |\n| [embedded-hal-nb](./embedded-hal-nb)    | [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/embedded-hal-nb.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/embedded-hal-nb) | [![Documentation](https://docs.rs/embedded-hal-nb/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/embedded-hal-nb) | Core traits, polling version using the `nb` crate |\n| [embedded-hal-bus](./embedded-hal-bus)   | [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/embedded-hal-bus.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/embedded-hal-bus) | [![Documentation](https://docs.rs/embedded-hal-bus/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/embedded-hal-bus) | Utilities for sharing SPI and I2C buses |\n| [embedded-can](./embedded-can)       | [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/embedded-can.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/embedded-can) | [![Documentation](https://docs.rs/embedded-can/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/embedded-can) | Controller Area Network (CAN) traits |\n| [embedded-io](./embedded-io)       | [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/embedded-io.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/embedded-io) | [![Documentation](https://docs.rs/embedded-io/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/embedded-io) | I/O traits (read, write, seek, etc.), blocking and nonblocking version. |\n| [embedded-io-async](./embedded-io-async)       | [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/embedded-io-async.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/embedded-io-async) | [![Documentation](https://docs.rs/embedded-io-async/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/embedded-io-async) | I/O traits, async version  |\n| [embedded-io-adapters](./embedded-io-adapters)       | [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/embedded-io-adapters.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/embedded-io-adapters) | [![Documentation](https://docs.rs/embedded-io-adapters/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/embedded-io-adapters) | Adapters between the [`embedded-io`](https://crates.io/crates/embedded-io) and [`embedded-io-async`](https://crates.io/crates/embedded-io-async) traits and other IO traits (`std`, `tokio`, `futures`...)  |\n\n## Documents\n\n- [Migrating from v0.2 to v1.0](docs/migrating-from-0.2-to-1.0.md).\n- [How-to: add a new trait](docs/how-to-add-a-new-trait.md)\n- [MSRV](docs/msrv.md)\n\n## Implementations and drivers\n\nFor a non-exhaustive list of `embedded-hal` implementations and driver crates check the\n[awesome-embedded-rust] list.\n\nYou may be able to find even more HAL implementation crates and driver crates by searching for the\n[`embedded-hal-impl`], [`embedded-hal-driver`] and [`embedded-hal`][embedded-hal-kw] keywords\non crates.io.\n\n[`embedded-hal-impl`]: https://crates.io/keywords/embedded-hal-impl\n[`embedded-hal-driver`]: https://crates.io/keywords/embedded-hal-driver\n[embedded-hal-kw]: https://crates.io/keywords/embedded-hal\n\n[awesome-embedded-rust]: https://github.com/rust-embedded/awesome-embedded-rust#driver-crates\n\n## Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)\n\nThis crate is guaranteed to compile on stable Rust 1.81 and up.
