          "content": "\n\n1.5.2 (2023-07-04) \n==================\n\n* **Feature** A new flag and associated output is available. The new flat is `--config-details` or `-C`. This will allow users to see the current configuration of `tv`. This is useful for debugging. Here is an example of the output:\n\n```sh\n> tidy-viewer -C\n\ntv.toml\n[+] delimiter = \",\"\n[+] title = \"\"\n[-] footer = None\n[+] upper_column_width = 20\n[+] lower_column_width = 2\n[+] number = 35\n[-] extend_width_length = None\n[+] meta_color = [Integer(255), Integer(0), Integer(0)]\n[+] header_color = [Integer(232), Integer(168), Integer(124)]\n[+] std_color = [Integer(133), Integer(205), Integer(202)]\n[+] na_color = [Integer(226), Integer(125), Integer(95)]\n[-] neg_num_color = None\n```\n\n- The `[+]` indicates that the values was found in the `tv.toml` file. \n\n- The `[-]` indicates that the value was not found in the `tv.toml` file and the default value was used.\n\n* **Bug** [#165](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/issues/165) The `tv.toml` has had a long history of being buggy. This is because users must provide entries for every key. I removed this constraint. Now, if a key is not provided, the default value is used. This should make the `tv.toml` more user friendly. Thanks @winter-again for the bug report.\n* **Bug** [#163](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/issues/163) Option `--number of rows to output` requires spaces between words instead of dashes. All other long form options use a dash to delimit words. Thanks @derekmahar for bug report.\n\n\n1.4.30 (2022-08-23) \n==================\n\n`tv` is 1 year old 🎉🥳🎉.\n\n* **Bug** I noticed that `tv` would not print remaining columns if the number of rows was less than `n`.\n\nChanged `if rows_remaining > 0` to `if rows_remaining > 0 || (cols - num_cols_to_print) > 0` as the \ncondition needed to get the footer to kick in.\n\nAlso, I was looking through the changelog and saw that I never gave credit to @burntsushi for holding\nmy hand as I was starting this project 1 year ago. I had a vision for this CLI, but was struggling with\nsome basics as I was learning Rust. Thank You!\n\nNote: Yes, I know there are a lot of versions skipped! I was struggling with getting some automated builds for\none of the releases. One quark is that builds are triggered with git tags. I used up a lot of git tags to test\nthings out. Which reminds me, thanks @certifiedloud for making the most recent builds possible. I could not \nhave done it without you.\n\n\n1.4.6 (2022-07-23)\n==================\n\nThis update was mainly focused on feature enhancements. I also did some `clippy` formatting.\n\n* **Bug** [#141](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/issues/141) Right alignment of row numbers might make it easier for users to quickly scan the output.\n\nI did not realize that I had the alignment wrong. I was doing left alignment, but it was brought to my attention that `tibble` uses right alignment.\nThis is now corrected. Thanks for the sharp eye @briandconnelly.\n\n* **Bug** [#140](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/issues/140)  `-n` option doesn't work when combined with `--extend-rows`\n\nThis was a bug I was not aware of that I wanted to knock out. Thanks @atsalolikhin-spokeo for using this package and reporting the issue. Your\nreport made the cli a little better.\n  \n* **Enhancement, Good first issue** [#139](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/issues/139)  Is it possible to turn off row numbering?\n\nAs requested I implemented `-R`, `--no-row-numbering` for this functionality\n  \n* **Enhancement, Good first issue** [#138](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/issues/138)  Is it possible to turn off dimensions printing?\n\nAs requested I implemented `-D`, `--no-dimensions` for this functionality\n\n1.4.5 (2021-05-10)\n==================\n\n* **Bug 1**  Though `-e` was added as an option I found that it was not overriding the `-n` argument. The fix was made with a simple if/else statement. \n\nIt may seem odd to bump the version with such a small bug, but I did not want to have something in the help file that was not functional in\nthe CLI. \n\n1.4.4 (2021-05-02)\n==================\n\n* **Feature 1**  Added `-e` flag to extend rows (don't truncate).\n\nThis new version gives a flag option to extend rows rather than truncate. This is especially useful for wide csv files that would overflow the terminal width. When using the extend mode, pipe output to `less -S` to enables scrolling right and left with arrow keys.\n\nI also did some clean up work. I removed a binary I was not using.\n\n1.4.3 (2021-11-17)\n==================\n\n* **Feature 1**  Added forced color flag for color pager support [Issue #112](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/issues/112)\n\nI was not aware of this until @ismaelgv opened the issue. `less -R` and `bat -p` can do color comprehension. In previous versions of `tv` we just stripped the color if the output was piped to programs like less. Now the user can override this behavior with a `-a` flag.\n\n\n1.4.2 (2021-10-28)\n==================\n\n### Version 1 🎉🥳🎉\n\nWe made it!! Version #1!!\n\nTechnically it is version 1.4.2. The [42](https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/42) is a homage to Geek culture.\n\nWhat makes this release version 1? My view is that version 1 should encapsulate the original vision of the software. The features of the current package is what I imagined when I started drawing up the project. Of course, as I have continued to work on the package I have found many additional enhancements. Also, if it were not for users of the software I would not have had additional feedback which has improved on this package tremendously. I will continue to work on enhancements. There are currently a list of issues I plan to address. I will also address bugs as they are reported. A special thanks goes to all of the contributors. Not only has `tv` been improved by smart contributors, but my own learning experience has been enhanced. Thank you!\n\n* **Feature 1** Added the option to modify the `sigfig` from the command line with the `g` option. [PR #107](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/pull/107). Thanks to @rlewicki for this fantastic contribution🎉\n* **Bug 1** Added NA alignment. If an NA is in a double or int column then the NA string is right aligned. If it is in a char or any other type it is left aligned. NA stings in double columns do not pass the decimal.[Bug #105](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/issues/105)\n\n\n0.0.22 (2021-10-18)\n==================\n\nThanks to @Lireer and @rlewicki for the fantastic contributions in this release 🎉\n\n* **Feature 1** Color negative numbers [PR #98](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/pull/98)\n* **Feature 2** Parse `\\t` as tab delimiter [PR #99](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/pull/99)\n* **Feature 3** Check file extensions to choose a delimiter [PR #100](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/pull/100)\n* **Feature 4** Use atty to omit text coloring and decorations  [PR #95](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/pull/95). \n\nAlong with these new features came additional tests. \n\nSince [PR #98](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/pull/98) was a aesthetic change it was also added as an additional parameter to be tweaked with a config file.\n\n0.0.21 (2021-10-09)\n==================\n\n* **Feature 1** Add configuration via `tv.toml`\n* **Feature 2** Decimal alignment. Correct formatting with a single pass. General code clean up. Thanks @jacobmischka!\n\nWe also saw @namitaarya fix a help file typo.\n\n0.0.20 (2021-10-02)\n==================\n\n* **Feature 1** Detect floats with `f64::from_str`\n* **Feature 2** Add the ability to pass file as argument. Not just stdin only.\n* [bug #75](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/issues/75):\nCut space from really long doubles.\n* [bug #25](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/issues/25):\nExponential notation is not captured as a float. Fixed with above feature 1.\n\nWe also saw some code quality improvements in this release. [PR #82](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/pull/82)\n\n\n0.0.19 (2021-09-29)\n==================\n\nThe version number jump was due to testing out github actions on automated releases using git tags as the release name. It took a few tries to get right.\n\n* **Feature 1** Add package to `snapcraft` to increase accessibility.\n* [bug #55](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/issues/55):\nfix panic on unicode string truncation\n* [BUG #40](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/issues/30):\nRemove trailing comma.\n* [BUG #48](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/issues/48):\nLogicals 1/0 were mentioned in comments, but not implemented.\n* [BUG #60](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/issues/60):\nEllipsis then space, not space then ellipsis.\n\nThe rest of the updates had to do with README updates and spelling errors in code comments.\n\n0.0.13 (2021-09-27)\n==================\nThis version was made possible by the contributions of @Lireer! Thank You!\n\n* [PR #40](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/pull/40) Allow users to specify the deliminator with the `delimiter` option.\n* [PR #42](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/pull/42) `clippy` warnings and code refactoring. \n* [PR #41](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/pull/41) change `.len()` to `.chars().count()` to avoid potential column widths if the value contains code points consisting of multiple bytes.\n\n0.0.12 (2021-09-09)\n==================\n* [BUG #33](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/issues/33) Ellipses used when NA should replace on unquoted string missingness #33\nThis problem was caused by all of the columns being width 1. When width is 1 the length of the string \"NA\" is 2. Since 2 was greater\nthan 1 NA was converted to ellipses. To fix this problem I added a min width of 2 and while I was at it I included a new option `lower-column-width`\n* [BUG #32](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/issues/32) Column with integer 1 and 0 returns NaN for 0.\nThis bug was caused by logging 0s. I added a condition on the sigfig decision tree to fix.\n* **Feature 1** `lower-column-width`: `The lower (minimum) width of columns. Must be 2 or larger. Default 2. `\n* **Feature 2** `upper-column-width`: `The upper (maximum) width of columns. Default 20.`\n* **Feature 2** `debug-mode`: `Print object details to make it easier for the maintainer to find and resolve bugs.` This is to save me time in the future :smile:\n\n0.0.10 (2021-08-05)\n==================\n* [BUG #29](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/issues/29) Turns out the column count was correct. `tv` was not printing the last column\n\n0.0.9 (2021-08-05)\n==================\nMinor Mistakes:\n\n* Added color format to additional footer data.\n* [BUG #29](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/issues/29):\nColumn count was wrong.\n* [BUG #28](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/issues/28):\nAccidental extra info printed from debug.\n\n0.0.8 (2021-08-05)\n==================\nFeature Enhancement:\n\n* [BUG #23](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/issues/23):\nSimplified the regex for floats.\n* [BUG #19](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/issues/19):\nPrinting \"wide\" datasets with more columns than space in the terminal resulted in a poor viewer experience. This fix removes extra columns from the print and mentions them in the footer.\n"

Nice colors out of the box\n2. Significant digit printing (no more decimal dust taking valuable terminal space)\n3. NA comprehension and coloring (no more misaligned data cells due to missing data)\n4. Dimensions printed first (no more guessing how many rows and columns are in the data)\n5. Column overflow logic (no more misalignment due to terminal dimensions)\n6. Long string/Unicode truncation (no more long strings pushing other data around)\n7. Customizable with a dotfile config (bring your own theme)\n\n# Installation\n\nThe following install options are available via package managers:\n\n* [Cargo](#cargo)\n* [Debian](#debian)\n* [AUR](#aur)\n* [Snap](#snap)\n* [Homebrew](#homebrew)\n\nWe currently cut releases for the following architectures. Download from the [release page](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/releases).\n\n* **MacOS**\n* **ARM**\n* **Windows**\n* **Build from source (Most general)**\n\nThe instructions for all of the above are very similar with the following general steps.\n\n1. Download your desired release from the [release page](https://github.com/alexhallam/tv/releases)\n2. `tar -xvzf <RELEASE_FILE_NAME>`\n3. `cd` into uncompressed folder\n4. Find binary `tidy-viewer`\n\nAfter the above steps I would highly recommend you make an alias for `tidy-viewer` as shown for other builds.\n\n### Cargo\n\nThe following will install from the [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/tidy-viewer) source.

This section defines terms and the decision tree used in the calculation of the final value displayed.\n\n## Definitions\n\n```text\n     ┌─────┐      ┌─────┐     ─┐\n     │     │      │     │      │\n     │     │      │     │      │\n     │     │      │     │      │\n     │     │      │     │      │\n     │     │  ┌┐  │     │      │\n     └─────┘  └┘  └─────┘    ──┴─\n   │        │    │                │\n   └────────┘  ▲ └────────────────┘\nleft hand side │  right hand side\n     (lhs)     │       (rhs)\n\n            decimal\n```\n\n**left hand side (lhs)**: digits on the left hand side of the decimal.\n\n**right hand side (rhs)**: digits on the right hand side of the decimal.\n\n```text\n\n ┌─────┐      ┌─────┐     ─┐     ┌─────┐\n │     │      │     │      │     │     │\n │     │      │     │      │     │     │\n │     │      │     │      │     │     │\n │     │      │     │      │     │     │\n │     │  ┌┐  │     │      │     │     │\n └─────┘  └┘  └─────┘    ──┴─    └─────┘\n\n│                     │         │       │\n└─────────────────────┘         └───────┘\n       leading 0s              trailing 0s\n```\n**leading 0s**: 0s to the left of a non-zero.\n\n**trailing 0s**: 0s to the right of a non-zero.

To get similar functionality run `column file.csv -ts,`\n\nThough `column` is similar I do think there are some reasons `tv` is a better tool.\n\n## 1. NA comprehension\n\n`NA` values are very important! Viewers should have their attention drawn to these empty cells. In the image below `NA` values are not only invisible, but it seems to be causing incorrect alignment in other columns.\n\n![na_comp](img/na_comprehension.png)\n\nThere are many ways that programs will designate missing values. Some use `none`, others use `NaN`, and many more `\"\"`, `NA`, `null`, `n/a` etc. `tv` searches for these strings and replaces them with `NA`. This is similar in spirit to the significant digit calculations and the truncation of columns with long strings. The purpose of `tv` is not to show the complete literal value, but to guide the eye.\n\n![na_comp](img/na_cases.png)\n\n## 2. Column Overflow Logic\n\nIn cases where the terminal width can't fit all of the columns in a dataframe, `column` will try to smush data on the rows below. This results in an unpleasant viewing experience. \n\n`tv` can automatically tell when there will be too many columns to print. When this occurs it will only print the columns that fit in the terminal and mention the extras in the footer below the table.\n\n![overflow](img/pigeon-racing.png)\n\n# Configuration Dotfile\n\nFor information on dotfile configuration see `tv --help`. This allows users to set their own color palette, rows to print, max column width, etc.\n\n# FAQ\n\n* Does `tv` have a light theme?\n\n> Yes, solorized light is added out of the box. This was added in version `1.4.6`. You may also define your own themes in the config.\n\n* The `~/.config/tv.toml` file is having no effect on the output. What am I doing wrong?\n\n> Every key/value pair must exist or the toml will not be read. If even one key/value is missing then the config will not work.\n\n* It would be nice to be able to scroll vertically/horizontally through tall/wide csv file. Does `tv` allow for this functionality?\n\n> Yes, pipe the output to `less` or `bat`. `tv` allows for this with the `-e` flag. \n> To extend to the full csv width and length and keep color try the following `tv diamonds.csv -ea | less -SR`\n> To extend to the full csv width and length and remove all color try the following `tv diamonds.csv -e | less -S`\n\n# Help\n\n`tv --help`\n\n```txt\ntv 1.5.2\nTidy Viewer (tv) is a csv pretty printer that uses column styling to maximize viewer enjoyment.✨✨📺✨✨\n\n    Example Usage:\n    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/master/data-raw/diamonds.csv\n    cat diamonds.csv | head -n 35 | tv\n    tv diamonds.csv\n\n    Configuration File Support:\n    An example config is printed to make it easy to copy/paste to `tv.toml`.\n    Check the parameters you have changed with `tv --config-details`.\n    The config (tv.toml) location is dependent on OS:\n        * Linux: $XDG_CONFIG_HOME or $HOME/.config/tv.toml\n        * macOS: $HOME/Library/Application Support/tv.toml\n        * Windows: {FOLDERID_RoamingAppData}\\tv.toml\n\n        ## ==Tidy-Viewer Config Example==\n        ## Remove the first column of comments for valid toml file\n        ## All fields must be defined.

If it is not the most deployed software it is probably close to it. For more info on SQLite see their [Executive Summary](https://www.sqlite.org/about.html)\n\nFor this example you will need to download and uncompress taxi data\n\n```bash\nwget https://github.com/multiprocessio/dsq/blob/43e72ff1d2c871082fed0ae401dd59e2ff9f6cfe/testdata/taxi.csv.7z?raw=true -O taxi.csv.7z\n7z x taxi.csv.7z\ncd testdata\nls -l --block-size=M # the data is farily large at 192MB\n```\n\n### SQLite One-liner\n```bash\nsqlite3 :memory: -csv -header -cmd '.import taxi.csv taxi' 'SELECT passenger_count, COUNT(*), AVG(total_amount) FROM taxi GROUP BY passenger_count' | tv\n```\n\nThe above one-liner queries a csv as an in-memory database. It is also possible to query an *existing* `sqlite` database and pipe the output as a csv for `tv` to pick up. A one-liner is shown below.\n\n```bash \nsqlite3 -csv -header <file_name.sqlite> 'select * from <table>;' | tv\n```\n\n## Use With DuckDB\n\n[DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/why_duckdb) has a lot in common with SQLite. As personal anecdotes I do like that fewer CLI flags are needed to run on csvs. I also like the speed. Though it is not as universal as SQLite I think that it is a good fit for command line data manipulation.\n\nFor this example you will need to download and uncompress taxi data\n\n```bash\nwget https://github.com/multiprocessio/dsq/blob/43e72ff1d2c871082fed0ae401dd59e2ff9f6cfe/testdata/taxi.csv.7z?raw=true -O taxi.csv.7z\n7z x taxi.csv.7z\ncd testdata\nls -l --block-size=M # the data is fairly large at 192MB\n```\n\n## Fun With `tv`\n\nUsing `duckdb` with `tv` and `less` to manipulate data with SQL grammar and view results in a scrolling window.\n\n```sh\nduckdb --csv -c \"select norm1 from norms.csv\" | ../target/release/tidy-viewer -f -a | less -R\n```\n\n### DuckDB One-liner\n```bash\nduckdb --csv -c \"SELECT passenger_count, COUNT(*), AVG(total_amount) FROM taxi.csv GROUP BY passenger_count ORDER BY passenger_count\" | tv\n```\n\n# Inspiration\n\n[pillar](https://pillar.r-lib.org/dev/articles/digits.html#trailing-dot-1) - R's tibble like formatting. Fantastic original work by [Kirill Müller](https://github.com/krlmlr) and [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/). `tv` makes an attempt to port their ideas to the terminal.\n"
