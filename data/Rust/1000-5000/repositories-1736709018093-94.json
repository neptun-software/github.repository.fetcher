          "content": "# How to contribute to the Linfa project\n\nThis document should be used as a reference when contributing to Linfa. It describes how an algorithm should be implemented to fit well into the Linfa ecosystem. First, there are implementation details, how to use a generic float type, how to use the `Dataset` type in arguments etc. Second, the cargo manifest should be set up, such that a user can choose for different backends. \n\n## Datasets and learning traits\n\nAn important part of the Linfa ecosystem is how to organize data for the training and estimation process. A [Dataset](src/dataset/mod.rs) serves this purpose. It is a small wrapper of data and targets types and should be used as argument for the [Fit](src/traits.rs) trait. Its parametrization is generic, with [Records](src/dataset/mod.rs) representing input data (atm only implemented for `ndarray::ArrayBase`) and [Targets](src/dataset/mod.rs) for targets.\n\nYou can find traits for different classes of algorithms [here](src/traits.rs). For example, to implement a fittable algorithm, which takes an `Array2` as input data and boolean array as targets and could fail with an `Error` struct:\n```rust\nimpl<F: Float> Fit<Array2<F>, Array1<bool>, Error> for SvmParams<F, Pr> {\n    type Object = Svm<F, Pr>;\n\n    fn fit(&self, dataset: &Dataset<Array2<F>, Array1<bool>>) -> Result<Self::Object, Error> {\n        ...\n    }\n}\n```\nwhere the type of the input dataset is `&Dataset<Kernel<F>, Array1<bool>>`. It produces a result with a fitted state, called `Svm<F, Pr>` with probability type `Pr`, or an error of type `Error` in case of failure.\n\nThe [Predict](src/traits.rs) trait has its own section later in this document, while for an example of a `Transformer` please look into the [linfa-kernel](linfa-kernel/src/lib.rs) implementation.\n\n## Parameters and checking\n\nAn algorithm has a number of hyperparameters, describing how it operates. This section describes how the algorithm's structs should be organized in order to conform with other implementations. \n\nSometimes only an algorithm's parameters must be checked for validity. As such, Linfa makes a distinction between checked and unchecked parameters. Unchecked parameters can be converted into checked parameters if the values are valid, and only checked parameters can be used to run the algorithm.\n\nImagine we have an implementation of `MyAlg`, there should separate structs called `MyAlgValidParams`, which are the checked parameters, and `MyAlgParams`, which are the unchecked parameters. The method `MyAlg::params(..) -> MyAlgParams` constructs a parameter set with default parameters and optionally required arguments (for example the number of clusters). `MyAlgValidParams` should be a struct that contains all the hyperparameters as fields, and `MyAlgParams` should just be a newtype that wraps `MyAlgValidParams`.\n```rust\nstruct MyAlgValidParams {\n    eps: f32,\n    backwards: bool,\n}\n\nstruct MyAlgParams(MyAlgValidParams);\n```\n\n`MyAlgParams` should implement the Consuming Builder pattern, explained in the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.0.0/style/ownership/builders.html). Each hyperparameter gets a method to modify it. `MyAlgParams` should also implement the `ParamGuard` trait, which facilitates parameter checking. The associated type `ParamGuard::Checked` should be `MyAlgValidParams` and the `check_ref()` method should contain the parameter checking logic, while `check()` simply calls `check_ref()` before unwrapping the inner `MyAlgValidParams`.\n\nWith a checked set of parameters, `MyAlgValidParams::fit(..) -> Result<MyAlg>` executes the learning process and returns a learned state. Due to blanket impls on `ParamGuard`, it's also possible to call `fit()` or `transform()` directly on `MyAlgParams` as well, which performs the parameter checking before the learning process.\n\nFollowing this convention, the pattern can be used by the user like this:\n```rust\nMyAlg::params()\n    .eps(1e-5)\n    .backwards(true)\n    ...\n    .fit(&dataset)?;\n```\nor, if the checking is done explicitly:\n```rust\nlet params = MyAlg::params().check();\nparams.fit(&dataset);\n```\n\n## Generic float types\n\nEvery algorithm should be implemented for `f32` and `f64` floating points. This can be achieved with the `linfa::Float` trait, which is basically just a combination of `ndarray::NdFloat` and `num_traits::Float`. You can look up most of the constants (like zero, one, PI) in the `num_traits` documentation. Here is a small example for a function, generic over `Float`:\n```rust\nuse linfa::Float;\nfn div_capped<F: Float>(num: F) {\n    F::one() / (num + F::from(1e-5).unwrap())\n}\n```\n\n## Implement prediction traits\n\nThere are two different traits for predictions, `Predict` and `PredictInplace`. `PredictInplace` takes a reference to the records and writes the prediction into a target parameter. This should be implemented by a new algorithms, for example:\n```rust\nimpl<F: Float, D: Data<Elem = F>> PredictInplace<ArrayBase<D, Ix2>, Array1<F>> for Svm<F, F> {\n    fn predict_inplace(&self, data: &ArrayBase<D, Ix2>, targets: &mut Array1<F>) {\n        assert_eq!(data.n_rows(), targets.len(), \"The number of data points must match the number of output targets.\");\n\n        for (data, target) in data.outer_iter().zip(targets.iter_mut()) {\n            *target = self.normal.dot(&data) - self.rho;\n        }\n    }\n\n    fn default_target(&self, data: &ArrayBase<D, Ix2>) -> Array1<F> {\n        Array1::zeros(data.nrows())\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation is then used by `Predict` to provide the following `records` and `targets` combinations:\n\n * `Dataset` -> `Dataset`\n * `&Dataset` -> `Array1`\n * `Array2` -> `Dataset`\n * `&Array2` -> `Array1`\n\nand should be imported by the user.\n\n## Make serde optionally\n\nIf you want to implement `Serialize` and `Deserialize` for your parameters, please do that behind a feature flag. You can add to your cargo manifest\n```\n[features]\nserde = [\"serde_crate\", \"ndarray/serde\"]\n\n[dependencies.serde_crate]\npackage = \"serde\"\noptional = true\nversion = \"1.0\"\n```\nwhich basically renames the `serde` crate to `serde_crate` and adds a feature `serde`. In your parameter struct, move the macro definition behind the `serde` feature:\n```rust\n#[cfg(feature = \"serde\")]\nuse serde_crate::{Deserialize, Serialize};\n\n#[cfg_attr(\n    feature = \"serde\",\n    derive(Serialize, Deserialize),\n    serde(crate = \"serde_crate\")\n)]\n#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq)]\npub struct HyperParams {\n...\n}\n```\n\n## Add a dataset\n\nWhen you want to add a dataset to the `linfa-datasets` crate, you have to do the following:\n * create a tarball with your dataset as a semicolon separated CSV file and move it to `linfa-datasets/data/?.csv.gz`\n * add a feature with the name of your dataset to `linfa-datasets`\n * create a new function in `linfa-datasets/src/lib.rs` carrying the name of your dataset and loading it as a binary file\n\nFor the last step you can look at similar implementations, for example the Iris plant dataset. The idea here is to put the dataset into the produced library directly and parse it from memory. This is obviously only feasible for small datasets.\n\nAfter adding it to the `linfa-datasets` crate you can include with the corresponding feature to your `Cargo.toml` file\n```\nlinfa-datasets = { version = \"0.3.0\", path = \"../datasets\", features = [\"winequality\"] }\n```\nand then use it in your example or tests as\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    let (train, valid) = linfa_datasets::winequality()\n        .split_with_ratio(0.8);\n    /// ...\n}\n```\n\n## Use the lapack trait bound\n\nWhen you want to implement an algorithm which requires the [Lapack](https://docs.rs/ndarray-linalg/0.13.1/ndarray_linalg/types/trait.Lapack.html) bound, then you could add the trait bound to the `linfa::Float` standard bound, e.g. `F: Float + Scalar + Lapack`. If you do that you're currently running into conflicting function definitions of [num_traits::Float](https://docs.rs/num-traits/0.2.14/num_traits/float/trait.Float.html) and [cauchy::Scalar](https://docs.rs/cauchy/0.4.0/cauchy/trait.Scalar.html) with the first defined for real-valued values and the second for complex values. \n\nIf you want to avoid that you can use the `linfa::dataset::{WithLapack, WithoutLapack}` traits, which basically adds the lapack trait bound for a block and then removes it again so that the conflicts can be avoided. For example:\n```rust\nlet decomp = covariance.with_lapack().cholesky(UPLO::Lower)?;\nlet sol = decomp\n     .solve_triangular(UPLO::Lower, Diag::NonUnit, &Array::eye(n_features))?\n     .without_lapack();\n```\n\n## Benchmarking\n\n### Building Benchmarks\nIt is important to the project that we have benchmarks in place to evaluate the benefit of performance related changes. To make that process easier we provide some guidelines for writing benchmarks.\n\n1. Test for a variety of sample sizes for most algorithms [1_000, 10_000, 20_000] will be sufficient. For algorithms where it's not too slow, use 100k instead of 20k.\n2. Test for a variety of feature dimensions. Two is usually enough for most algorithms. The following are suggested feature dimensions to use for different types of algorithms:\n    - Spatial algorithms: [3, 8]\n    - Dimentionality reduction algorithms: [10, 20, 50]\n    - Others: [5, 10]\n3. Use Criterion. Iai another popular benchmarking tool is not being actively maintained at the moment and at the time of this writing it hasn't been updated since Feb 25, 2021.\n4. Test various alg implementations for instance Pls has the following algorithms: Nipals and Svd.\n5. For algorithms that require an RNG or random seed as input, use a constant seed for reproducibility\n6. When benchmarking multi-target the target count should be within the following range: [2, 4].\n7. In `BenchmarkId` include the values used to parametrize the benchmark. For example if we're doing Pls then we may have something like `Canonical-Nipals-5feats-1_000samples`\n8. Pass data as an argument to the function being benched. This will prevent Criterion from including data creation time as part of the benchmark.\n9. Add a profiler see [here](https://github.com/tikv/pprof-rs#integrate-with-criterion) for an example on how to do so with pprof, Criterion, and Flamegraph.\n10. Use the `benchmarks` feature of the linfa crate to configure your benchmark groups and profiler. See the bench in linfa-pls as an example of this. In most cases you can just copy and paste the configuration portions of the code. If other configurations are desired it is still easily customizable and explained in the pprof and Criterion documentations.\n\nFeel free to use the pls bench as a guideline. Note that it uses the config::set_default_benchmark_configs and config::get_default_profiling_configs functions to configure benchmarking and profiling respectively.\n\n### Running Benchmarks\nWhen running benchmarks sometimes you will want to profile the code execution. Assuming you have followed step 9 to add a pprof profiling hook for the linfa-ica package you can run the following to get your profiling results as a flamegraph. Be advised that at the time of writing this profiling will not work on Windows machines.\n\n`cargo bench -p linfa-ica --bench fast_ica -q -- --profile-time 30`\n\nIf you are interested in running a regular criterion bench for linfa-ica then you can run the following\n\n`cargo bench -p linfa-ica`\n\n### Reporting Benchmark Metrics\nIt is important that we have a consistent methodology for reporting benchmarks below is a template that should aid reviewers.\n\n```\n### Context\nIn a bullet list describe the following:\n1. Run on battery charge or while plugged in\n2. Power saving mode\n3. If the computer was idle during benchmark\n4. If the computer was overheating\n5. Hardware specs\n\n### Bench Command Run\nbench results (code format)\n\n[Attached Flamegraphs if profile runs were also done]\n```"

By default, we use a pure-Rust implementation. However, you can also choose an external BLAS/LAPACK backend library instead, by enabling the `blas` feature and a feature corresponding to your BLAS backend. Currently you can choose between the following BLAS/LAPACK backends: `openblas`, `netblas` or `intel-mkl`.\n\n|Backend  | Linux | Windows | macOS |\n|:--------|:-----:|:-------:|:-----:|\n|OpenBLAS |✔️      |-        |-      |\n|Netlib   |✔️      |-        |-      |\n|Intel MKL|✔️      |✔️        |✔️      |\n\nEach BLAS backend has two features available. The feature allows you to choose between linking the BLAS library in your system or statically building the library. For example, the features for the `intel-mkl` backend are `intel-mkl-static` and `intel-mkl-system`.\n\nAn example set of Cargo flags for enabling the Intel MKL backend on an algorithm crate is `--features blas,linfa/intel-mkl-system`. Note that the BLAS backend features are defined on the `linfa` crate, and should only be specified for the final executable.\n\n# License\nDual-licensed to be compatible with the Rust project.\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0 or the MIT license http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT, at your option.
