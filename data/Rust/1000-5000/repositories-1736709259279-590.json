This way you, as a developer,\ncan use your machine for changing the source code or browsing the documentation\nwithout constant freezes and hearing jet engine-like sounds caused by the build process.\nThe execution itself is not limited and can be applied to actions\nlike encoding audio and video, batch processing and more.\n\nIt works via pushing files to the remote machine, executing the command there\nand pulling results to the local machine.\n\n```console\n$ mainframer ./gradlew build\nSync local → remote machine...\n:build\nBUILD SUCCESSFUL\nSync remote → local machine...\n\n$ java -jar build/libs/sample.jar\nThis program was built on a remote machine!\n```\n\n## State of the Project\n\n* [`2.x`](https://github.com/gojuno/mainframer/tree/v2.1.0) — the stable version, recommended for production use.\n* `3.x` — the future version, in active development at this point.\n    * Mainframer is going to be [a system-wide tool](https://github.com/gojuno/mainframer/issues/185).\n    * Mainframer is [rewritten in Rust](https://github.com/gojuno/mainframer/issues/191).\n    * Mainframer will speed up most of existing workflows by [syncing during remote command execution](https://github.com/gojuno/mainframer/issues/188).\n\n## Documentation\n\n### Getting Started\n\n* [Remote Machine](docs/getting-started/remote-machine.md)\n* [Local Machine](docs/getting-started/local-machine.md)\n\n### Configuration\n\n* [Description](docs/configuration/description.md)\n* [Examples](docs/configuration/examples.md)\n\n### Integrations\n\n* [IntelliJ IDEA](docs/integration/intellij-idea.md)\n\n## Transfer Notice\n\nIn October 2018, Mainframer was transferred from\n[github/gojuno](https://github.com/gojuno) to [github/buildfoundation](https://github.com/buildfoundation).\nIt was a friendly agreement between Juno Inc. and Build Foundation after\nthe core developer of the project [@artem-zinnatullin](https://github.com/artem-zinnatullin) left the company.\n\nThe motivation for the transfer is to have a neutral space for the future work on the project.\n\n## License\n\n```\nCopyright 2018 Mainframer Maintainers.\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n   http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n```\n"
