          "content": "# High-Level Priorities\n\n1. Ease of Use / Protection Against Misuse\n2. Maintainability\n3. Code Size\n4. Performance\n\nThese should usually be prioritized in that order, but adjust the trade-off as necessary for whatever you're working on.\n\n# General\n\n- **The bridging layer is not API.** As noted in the [readme](README.md), the primary purpose of this library is to provide good Java, Swift, and TypeScript APIs. We also try to make the non-bridge crates have a nice API, both for our own maintainence, testing, and internal use; and for external users who want to use or fork our crate. However, the Rust APIs in rust/bridge/ and the raw C symbols / JNI entry points / Node module we build are not considered public-facing at all. Use that to keep everything else nice!\n\n    (Not that you should be sloppy in the bridging layer. Maintainability is still a priority!)\n\n- **Public APIs should follow the convention of their language/environment.** What makes a good Java API is different from what makes a good Swift API or TypeScript API (or Rust API). It's okay if that leads to differently-shaped public APIs or even multiple bridge functions.\n\n- But, **try not to repeat implementation details across app languages**. If something has to be changed in multiple places, it's going to get out of sync. It's better if we can put that information in the Rust bridging layer and have the app languages access it that way.\n\n    The exception is tests, where we do primary testing in Rust but still want to have good coverage for all three app languages. We've missed edge cases for just one app language too many times in the past.\n\n- **Every change should have tests** or be covered by existing tests. There are sometimes exceptions to this, but a lot of times the act of justifying the exception can suggest how to write the tests instead.\n\n- **Logs should not contain user data**, including the default stringification for errors (Rust's Display, Java and TypeScript's `toString()`, Swift's `description`). \"Debug\" and \"verbose\" log levels are an exception to this, since they are turned off at compile time in our client library release builds. Note that this isn't \"any information that can uniquely distinguish one user from another\" (an ephemeral public key can do that, and there are legitimate reasons to log those; use your best judgment), but it is \"any information that includes user input\" (such as unencrypted usernames), \"any information that can be linked back to a Signal account\" (such as identity keys), and of course \"any passwords or private keys\".\n\n    One place where this is particularly subtle is when working with types that come from dependencies, especially errors. If the dependency has access to any such potentially-sensitive information, it's best to assume it could make it into arbitrary output, including error messages. The libsignal-net crate is particularly sensitive to this and constrains its errors with a custom LogSafeDisplay trait, but this isn't perfect.\n\n    Low-level objects like ServiceId and ProtocolAddress do not follow this rule; instead, they stringify in fixed formats that are easy to filter from higher-level logs en masse.\n\n- **Logs should be kept minimal on success paths**. It's harder to find significant information in a sea of \"operation succeeded!\", and in the worst case we'd hit the log size limit sooner. (Clients only keep a few days of logs, and they'll keep even less if the recent logs are taking up too much space.) Even on failure paths, consider how much will end up in client logs, and if it'll be redundant with a higher-level log. Especially when logging in a loop. But don't go too far: it's important to know when certain events happen in relation to earlier or later failures.\n\n    As with the previous rule, this does not apply to the \"debug\" and \"verbose\" log levels, which are turned off at compile time in our client library release builds.\n\n\n# Rust\n\n- **We avoid including multiple versions of crates in our build products when reasonable.** This is purely for code size reasons, not compile time; we allow multiple versions of crates for host and testing dependencies. This is enforced in CI with the [verify_duplicate_crates](bin/verify_duplicate_crates) script.\n\n- **Panics are caught** and reported to apps as recoverable errors, so everything we make has to be unwind-safe in at least a basic sense.\n\n- **Prefer `expect()` to `unwrap()`.** As noted, we don't have a no-panics policy, but `expect()` forces you to write down why you believe something should *never* happen except for programmer errors. In particular, untrusted input that fails to validate should *not* panic.\n\n    (Yes, there's a Clippy lint for this, but we also have a lot of code that predates this guideline.)\n\n- You don't have to write doc comments on everything, but **if you do write a comment, make it a doc comment**, because they show up more nicely in IDEs.\n\n- We build with a pinned nightly toolchain, but **we also support stable**. The specific minimum supported version of stable is checked in CI (specifically, at the top of [build_and_test.yml](.github/workflows/build_and_test.yml)). We permit ourselves to bump this as needed, but try not to do so capriciously because we know external people might be in non-rustup scenarios where getting a new stable is tricky. If you need to bump the minimum supported version of stable, make sure the next release has a \"breaking\" version number.\n\n- **We do not have a changelog file**; we rely on [GitHub displaying all our releases](https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal/releases).\n\n- **Avoid `cargo add`**, or fix up the Cargo.toml afterwards. Some of our dependency lists are organized and `cargo add` doesn't respect that.\n\n- We do not have consistent guidelines for how to do errors in Rust, and the different crates do them differently. :-(\n\n- When profiling on an aarch64 device, you need to **explicitly enable hardware AES support** in the `aes` crate:\n\n        RUSTFLAGS=\"--cfg aes_armv8 ${RUSTFLAGS:-}\"\n\n    These are automatically detected on x86_64, but will require an opt-in for aarch64 until we can update to `aes 0.9` or newer (not out yet at the time of this writing). All our app library build scripts set this themselves, but doing a manual `cargo build --release` will not.\n\n\n## Async\n\n- When using the `select!` macro, **prefer `tokio::select!` over `futures::select!`**. They are not the same! `futures::select!` tries to make you think about use in loops by requiring that the futures be FusedFutures. However, many real-world futures do not implement FusedFuture, which means you have to call `fuse()` somewhere; it's easy to mistakenly do that *every time through the loop* instead of ahead of time. Doing so may also make it harder to use other methods of the Future in question, if the `select!` is not consuming.\n\n    `tokio::select!` does not require FusedFuture, so you may need to add a guard clause (e.g. `, if !future.is_terminated`) if you're polling in a loop (or if the future may have already been completed for some other reason).\n\n    More background here: \"[Why doesn't tokio::select! require FusedFuture?](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/why-doesnt-tokio-select-require-fusedfuture/46975)\"\n\n- When bridging async APIs that use `#[bridge_io]`, **remember that the arguments and results will cross thread/queue/actor boundaries**, even in Node where there's only one JavaScript thread. Most of the time Rust's own Send/Sync checking will prevent this from being a problem, but whatever types are passed across the bridge layer will be unchecked, and you, the author of the code, will have to think about whether it's a problem (on both sides of the bridge). Usually it won't be! Value types like C structs and immutable Java objects are fine, it's only mutable objects and raw pointers where you have to be careful.\n\n    Async APIs that do not use `#[bridge_io]` are always run on the calling thread: for Java and Swift, they are run to completion immediately, and for Node they are run by being scheduled on the JavaScript microtask queue. However, in theory any calls back into app code could still lead to reentrant use, and any borrowed Rust objects might be accessed from other threads while the operation is ongoing.\n\n\n# Java\n\n- Many of our APIs are shared between Android and Server, and we also run the client tests on desktop machines, so **stick to Java 8** unless you've verified that something newer is available on Android (back to our earliest supported version, API level 21, at the time of this writing), and don't use Android-specific APIs unless you're actually in Android-specific code. (This *should* be checked in CI but things have slipped through before, and it'll save you time to know whether you're allowed to use something.)\n\n- **Put server-specific APIs in the server/ folder if they're not needed to test client features**, so they don't add code size for Android.\n\n- **Put tests in the client/ folder unless they're testing server-only APIs**, so they can be run on both desktop machines and Android devices (and emulators).\n\n- **Write javadocs** unless an API is trivial (or not app-team-facing). Even for internal methods, though, if you do write a comment, make it a doc comment (like for Rust code), because it shows up in IDEs.\n\n- Our Java code gets minified with [Android's R8] tool, which scans for usages of all items (classes, methods, fields) and prunes those that are never used. It can't see usages from Rust code via JNI, so additional annotations are required. **Annotate classes, methods, and fields that are accessed via JNI with `@CalledFromNative`**, which is recognized by the directives in [`libsignal.pro`], to ensure they are kept.\n\n[Android's R8]: https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code\n[`libsignal.pro`]: ./java/shared/resources/META-INF/proguard/libsignal.pro\n\n\n# Swift\n\n- We support back to **iOS 13** (at the time of this writing), so newer APIs may not be available. This will be checked on build, so you can't get it wrong.\n\n- **Write API docs** using [DocC syntax][] (a Markdown dialect), unless an API is trivial (or not app-team-facing). Even for internal methods, though, if you do write a comment, make it a doc comment (like for Rust code), because it shows up in IDEs.\n\n- To make sure that error messages get into logs, we use the `failOnError` helper instead of `try!` for forcing an unwrap on the result of an operation that can throw an error.\n\n- [`Sendable`][] is a part of Swift's concurrency-checking model similar to Rust's `Send` and `Sync`. In general, **any `public` struct or enum should be marked `Sendable`** unless it wraps something that isn't Sendable (or if it's an enum just used for namespacing). You don't have to do this for non-public structs and enums; Swift will infer whether they are Sendable within the library automatically.\n\n    Classes are trickier: a class that will forever be immutable is safe to mark `Sendable`, as is a class whose methods are designed to be called from multiple threads (often shortened to \"this class is thread-safe\"). However, unless you can make the class `final` *and* it doesn't have a superclass that's non-`Sendable`, the compiler won't be able to check it for you, and you'll have to write `@unchecked Sendable` instead. Be careful that this really is safe, and that we won't ever want to introduce mutating operations! It's easier to add Sendable later than to remove it, so err on the side of not including it.\n\n    As an approximation, `Sendable` in Swift is *roughly* equivalent to Rust's `Send` for value types (e.g. structs) and `Sync` for reference types (e.g. classes), because every reference in Swift has an implicit `Arc` around it.\n\n[DocC syntax]: https://www.swift.org/documentation/docc/writing-symbol-documentation-in-your-source-files\n[`Sendable`]: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/sendable\n\n\n# TypeScript\n\n- **Write API docs** using [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app), unless an API is trivial (or not app-team-facing). Even for internal methods, though, if you do write a comment, make it a doc comment (like for Rust code), because it shows up in IDEs.\n\n- **Include server APIs** in the TypeScript package; [@signalapp/mock-server][] exists.\n\n[@signalapp/mock-server]: https://github.com/signalapp/Mock-Signal-Server\n\n\n# Other useful documents\n\nWe don't adhere to these exactly but they're often useful tiebreakers or points of reference:\n\n- [Official Rust API guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/)\n- [Fuchsia Netstack Team's Rust Patterns](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/contribute/contributing-to-netstack/rust-patterns)\n- [Official Swift API guidelines](https://www.swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/)\n"

          "content": "                    GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 3, 19 November 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure\ncooperation with the community in the case of network server software.\n\n  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\nour General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights\nwith two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer\nyou this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\nand/or modify the software.\n\n  A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that\nimprovements made in alternate versions of the program, if they\nreceive widespread use, become available for other developers to\nincorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and\nencouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of\nsoftware used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.\nThe GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and\nletting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its\nsource code to the public.\n\n  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to\nensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available\nto the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to\nprovide the source code of the modified version running there to the\nusers of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on\na publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source\ncode of the modified version.\n\n  An older license, called the Affero General Public License and\npublished by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is\na different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has\nreleased a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under\nthis license.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the\nProgram, your modified version must prominently offer all users\ninteracting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version\nsupports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding\nSource of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source\nfrom a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary\nmeans of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source\nshall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3\nof the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the\nfollowing paragraph.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version\n3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions\nwill be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU Affero General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer\nnetwork, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to\nget its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its\ninterface could display a \"Source\" link that leads users to an archive\nof the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different\nsolutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the\nspecific requirements.\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n"

          "content": "# Overview\n\nlibsignal contains platform-agnostic APIs used by the official Signal clients and servers, exposed\nas a Java, Swift, or TypeScript library. The underlying implementations are written in Rust:\n\n- libsignal-protocol: Implements the Signal protocol, including the [Double Ratchet algorithm][]. A\n  replacement for [libsignal-protocol-java][] and [libsignal-metadata-java][].\n- signal-crypto: Cryptographic primitives such as AES-GCM. We use [RustCrypto][]'s where we can\n  but sometimes have differing needs.\n- device-transfer: Support logic for Signal's device-to-device transfer feature.\n- attest: Functionality for remote attestation of [SGX enclaves][] and server-side [HSMs][].\n- zkgroup: Functionality for [zero-knowledge groups][] and related features available in Signal.\n- zkcredential: An abstraction for the sort of zero-knowledge credentials used by zkgroup, based on the paper \"[The Signal Private Group System][]\" by Chase, Perrin, and Zaverucha.\n- poksho: Utilities for implementing zero-knowledge proofs (such as those used by zkgroup); stands for \"proof-of-knowledge, stateful-hash-object\".\n- account-keys: Functionality for consistently using [PINs][] as passwords in Signal's Secure Value Recovery system, as well as other account-wide key operations.\n- usernames: Functionality for username generation, hashing, and proofs.\n- media: Utilities for manipulating media.\n\nThis repository is used by the Signal client apps ([Android][], [iOS][], and [Desktop][]) as well as\nserver-side. Use outside of Signal is unsupported. In particular, the products of this repository\nare the Java, Swift, and TypeScript libraries that wrap the underlying Rust implementations. All\nAPIs and implementations are subject to change without notice, as are the JNI, C, and Node add-on\n\"bridge\" layers. However, backwards-incompatible changes to the Java, Swift, TypeScript, and\nnon-bridge Rust APIs will be reflected in the version number on a best-effort basis, including\nincreases to the minimum supported tools versions.\n\n[Double Ratchet algorithm]: https://signal.org/docs/\n[libsignal-protocol-java]: https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal-protocol-java\n[libsignal-metadata-java]: https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal-metadata-java\n[RustCrypto]: https://github.com/RustCrypto\n[Noise protocol]: http://noiseprotocol.org/\n[SGX enclaves]: https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/software-guard-extensions.html\n[HSMs]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_security_module\n[zero-knowledge groups]: https://signal.org/blog/signal-private-group-system/\n[The Signal Private Group System]: https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1416.pdf\n[PINs]: https://signal.org/blog/signal-pins/\n[Android]: https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android\n[iOS]: https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-iOS\n[Desktop]: https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Desktop\n\n\n# Building\n\n### Toolchain Installation\n\nTo build anything in this repository you must have [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) installed,\nas well as Clang, libclang, [CMake](https://cmake.org), Make, protoc, and git.\n\n#### Linux/Debian\n\nOn a Debian-like system, you can get these extra dependencies through `apt`:\n\n```shell\n$ apt-get install clang libclang-dev cmake make protobuf-compiler git\n```\n\n#### macOS\n\nOn macOS, we have a best-effort maintained script to set up the Rust toolchain you can run by:\n\n```shell\n$ bin/mac_setup.sh\n```\n\n## Rust\n\n### First Build and Test\n\nThe build currently uses a specific version of the Rust nightly compiler, which\nwill be downloaded automatically by cargo. To build and test the basic protocol\nlibraries:\n\n```shell\n$ cargo build\n...\n$ cargo test\n...\n```\n\n### Additional Rust Tools\n\nThe basic tools above should get you set up for most libsignal Rust development. \n\nEventually, you may find that you need some additional Rust tools like `cbindgen` to modify the bridges to the \nclient libraries or `taplo` for code formatting. \n\nYou should always install any Rust tools you need that may affect the build from cargo rather than from your system\npackage manager (e.g. `apt` or `brew`). Package managers sometimes contain outdated versions of these tools that can break\nthe build with incompatibility issues (especially cbindgen).\n\nTo install the main Rust extra dependencies matching the versions we use, you can run the following commands: \n\n```shell\n$ cargo +stable install cbindgen cargo-fuzz\n$ cargo +stable install --version \"$(cat ../acknowledgments/cargo-about-version)\" --locked cargo-about\n$ cargo +stable install --version \"$(cat ../.taplo-cli-version)\" --locked taplo-cli\n```\n\n## Java/Android\n\nTo build for Android you must install several additional packages including a JDK,\nthe Android NDK/SDK, and add the Android targets to the Rust compiler, using\n\n```rustup target add armv7-linux-androideabi aarch64-linux-android i686-linux-android x86_64-linux-android```\n\nTo build the Java/Android ``jar`` and ``aar``, and run the tests:\n\n```shell\n$ cd java\n$ ./gradlew test\n$ ./gradlew build # if you need AAR outputs\n```\n\nYou can pass `-P debugLevelLogs` to Gradle to build without filtering out debug- and verbose-level\nlogs from Rust.\n\nAlternately, a build system using Docker is available:\n\n```shell\n$ cd java\n$ make\n```\n\nWhen exposing new APIs to Java, you will need to run `rust/bridge/jni/bin/gen_java_decl.py` in\naddition to rebuilding. This requires installing the `cbindgen` Rust tool, as detailed above. \n\n### Maven Central\n\nSignal publishes Java packages on [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.org) for its own use,\nunder the names org.signal:libsignal-server, org.signal:libsignal-client, and\norg.signal:libsignal-android. libsignal-client and libsignal-server contain native libraries for\nDebian-flavored x86_64 Linux as well as Windows (x86_64) and macOS (x86_64 and arm64).\nlibsignal-android contains native libraries for armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, x86, and x86_64 Android.\n\nWhen building for Android you need *both* libsignal-android and libsignal-client, but the Windows\nand macOS libraries in libsignal-client won't automatically be excluded from your final app. You can\nexplicitly exclude them using `packagingOptions`:\n\n```\nandroid {\n  // ...\n  packagingOptions {\n    resources {\n      excludes += setOf(\"libsignal_jni*.dylib\", \"signal_jni*.dll\")\n    }\n  }\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nYou can additionally exclude `libsignal_jni_testing.so` if you do not plan to use any of the APIs\nintended for client testing.\n\n\n## Swift\n\nTo learn about the Swift build process see [``swift/README.md``](swift/)\n\n\n## Node\n\nYou'll need Node installed to build. If you have [nvm][], you can run `nvm use` to select an\nappropriate version automatically.\n\nWe use `npm` as our package manager, and `node-gyp` to control building the Rust library.\n\n```shell\n$ cd node\n$ nvm use\n$ npm install\n$ npx node-gyp rebuild  # clean->configure->build\n$ npm run tsc\n$ npm run test\n```\n\nWhen testing changes locally, you can use `npm run build` to do an incremental rebuild of the Rust library. Alternately, `npm run build-with-debug-level-logs` will rebuild without filtering out debug- and verbose-level logs.\n\nWhen exposing new APIs to Node, you will need to run `rust/bridge/node/bin/gen_ts_decl.py` in\naddition to rebuilding.\n\n[nvm]: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm\n\n### NPM\n\nSignal publishes the NPM package `@signalapp/libsignal-client` for its own use, including native\nlibraries for Windows, macOS, and Debian-flavored Linux. Both x64 and arm64 builds are included for\nall three platforms, but the arm64 builds for Windows and Linux are considered experimental, since\nthere are no official builds of Signal for those architectures.\n\n\n# Contributions\n\nSignal does accept external contributions to this project. However unless the change is\nsimple and easily understood, for example fixing a bug or portability issue, adding a new\ntest, or improving performance, first open an issue to discuss your intended change as not\nall changes can be accepted.\n\nContributions that will not be used directly by one of Signal's official client apps may still be\nconsidered, but only if they do not pose an undue maintenance burden or conflict with the goals of\nthe project.\n\nSigning a [CLA (Contributor License Agreement)](https://signal.org/cla/) is required for all contributions.\n\n## Code Formatting and Acknowledgments\n\nYou can run the styler on the entire project by running:\n\n```shell\njust format-all\n```\n\nYou can run more extensive tests as well as linters and clippy by running:\n\n```shell\njust check-pre-commit\n```\n\nWhen making a PR that adjusts dependencies, you'll need to regenerate our acknowledgments files. See [``acknowledgments/README.md``](acknowledgments/).\n\n# Legal things\n## Cryptography Notice\n\nThis distribution includes cryptographic software.

Otherwise, increase the third version component.\n\n```\nbin/update_versions.py 0.x.y\ncargo check --workspace --all-features # make sure Cargo.lock is updated\n```\n\n## 2. Record the code size for the Java library\n\nOn GitHub, under the Java tests for the most recent commit, copy the code size computed for the \"current\" commit in the \"java/check_code_size.py\" step into a new entry in java/code_size.json.\n\n## 3. Commit the version change and tag with release notes\n\n```\ngit commit -am 'Bump to version v0.x.y'\ngit tag -a v0.x.y\n```\n\nTake a look at a past release for examples of the format:\n\n```\nv0.8.3\n\n- Fixed several issues running signal-crypto operations on 32-bit\n  platforms.\n- Removed custom implementation of AES-GCM-SIV, AES, AES-CTR, and\n  GHash in favor of the implementations from RustCrypto. The interface\n  presented to Java, Swift, and TypeScript clients has not changed.\n- Updated several Rust dependencies.\n- Java: Exposed the tag size for Aes256GcmDecryption.\n```\n\n(You might think repeating the version number in the summary field is redundant, but GitHub shows it as a title.)\n\n## 4. Push the version bump and tag to GitHub\n\nNote that both the tag *and* the branch need to be pushed.\n\n## 5. Submit to package repositories as needed\n\n### Android and Server: Sonatype\n\nIn the signalapp/libsignal repository on GitHub, run the \"Upload Java libraries to Sonatype\" action on the tag you just made. Then go to [Maven Central][] and wait for the build to show up (it can take up to an hour).\n\n[Maven Central]: https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.signal/libsignal-client/versions\n\n### Node: NPM\n\nIn the signalapp/libsignal repository on GitHub, run the \"Publish to NPM\" action on the tag you just made. Leave the \"NPM Tag\" as \"latest\".\n\n### iOS: Build Artifacts\n\nIn the signalapp/libsignal repository on GitHub, run the \"Build iOS Artifacts\" action on the tag you just made. Share the resulting checksum with whoever will update the iOS app repository.\n"

          "size": 3.716796875,
          "content": "For the most part, libsignal is tested using each language's usual testing infrastructure, as described in the main [README.md](./README.md):\n\n```shell\n# Rust\n% cargo test --workspace --all-features\n\n# Java / Android\n% ./gradlew client:test server:test android:connectedAndroidTest\n\n# Node\n% npm run build && npm run tsc && npm run test\n\n# Swift\n% ./build_ffi.sh --generate-ffi && swift test\n```\n\nHowever, sometimes there are some more interesting test configurations; those are documented here.\n\n\n# Rust Benchmarks\n\n- If you are testing on an ARM64 device (including Desktop), you should compile with `RUSTFLAGS=\"--cfg aes_armv8\"` to enable hardware support in the `aes` crate.\n\n- Similarly, although most tests are not very sensitive to the speed of SHA-2, you should also compile with `--features sha2/asm`. (`libsignal-message-backup` turns this on by default as a dev-dependency.) This will go away when we get to update to sha2 0.11.\n\nAll of these configuration options are normally set either at the bridge crate level or in the build scripts for each bridged platform, but they may not be set when running with plain `cargo bench`.\n\n\n# Running cross-compiling Rust tests with custom runners\n\nRust allows running tests with cross-compiled targets, but normally that only works if your system supports executing the cross-compiled binary (like Intel targets on ARM64 macOS or Windows, or 32-bit targets on 64-bit Linux or Windows). However, by overriding the \"runner\" setting for a particular target, we can run cross-compiled tests as well.\n\n## Running Rust tests on Android Devices (including the emulator)\n\n1. Connect your device, or start an emulator and let it finish booting.\n\n2. Make sure `adb` is in your path, or set `ADB` to the path to `adb` (it's usually in `$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/platform-tools/adb`).\n\n3. Set the following environment variables, filling in `path/to/ndk` and `YOUR_HOST_HERE`:\n\n    ```shell\n    ANDROID_NDK_HOME=path/to/ndk\n    CARGO_PROFILE_TEST_STRIP=debuginfo   # make the \"push\" step take less time\n    CARGO_PROFILE_BENCH_STRIP=debuginfo  # same for benchmarks\n    CARGO_TARGET_AARCH64_LINUX_ANDROID_LINKER=path/to/ndk/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/YOUR_HOST_HERE/bin/aarch64-linux-android21-clang\n    CARGO_TARGET_AARCH64_LINUX_ANDROID_RUNNER=bin/adb-run-test # in the repo root\n    ```\n\n    (If working with a different target architecture, don't forget to change the environment variables above. You may need to set additional environment variables depending on what you're building; see [`build_jni.sh`][java/build_jni.sh] for the full set that libsignal-jni uses.)\n\n4. Finally, run `cargo test --target aarch64-linux-android -p PACKAGE`.\n\nWhen running against an actual device, the \"push\" step in [`adb-run-test`][bin/adb-run-test] can be a bit flaky. Turning on the developer option \"Stay awake\" in the system settings seems to help.\n\nYou may need to push additional resources if the test expects to find them relative to the working directory, which you can `adb push` as well. (If you're writing the test, prefer `include_bytes!` instead to avoid this.)\n\n\n## Running Rust tests in the iOS Simulator\n\n1. Start a simulator and let it finish booting.\n\n2. Set the following environment variable:\n\n    ```shell\n    CARGO_TARGET_AARCH64_APPLE_IOS_SIM_RUNNER='xcrun simctl spawn booted'\n    ```\n\n    (if working on an Intel Mac, don't forget to change the environment variables above to match the Intel simulator target)\n\n3. Finally, run `cargo test --target aarch64-apple-ios-sim -p PACKAGE`.\n\nIf the test has resources found relatively, you’ll have to hack them in by loading them into the simulator’s root, which is located at `~/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/YOUR_SIMULATOR_UUID/data`. (If you're writing the test, prefer `include_bytes!` instead to avoid this.)\n"
