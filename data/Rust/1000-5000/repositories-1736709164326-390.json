Call to action\n\nWe don't have a vibrant community just yet. This is the very stages of the project. But if you are passionate about code with high standards and no compromises, if you are looking for a project with high impact, if you are interested in a better, more open infrastructure for spreadsheets, whether you are a developer (rust, python, TypeScript, electron/tauri/anything else native app, React, you name it), a designer, an Excel power user who wants features, a business looking to integrate a MIT/Apache licensed spreadsheet in your own SaaS application join us!\n\nThe best place to start will be to join or [discord channel](https://discord.gg/zZYWfh3RHJ) or send us an email at hello@ironcalc.com.\n\nMany have said it better before me:\n\n> Folks wanted for hazardous journey. Low wages, bitter cold, long hours of complete darkness. Safe return doubtful. Honour and recognition in event of success.\n\n\n# License\n\nLicensed under either of\n\n* [MIT license](LICENSE-MIT)\n* [Apache license, version 2.0](LICENSE-Apache-2.0)\n\nat your option.\n"
