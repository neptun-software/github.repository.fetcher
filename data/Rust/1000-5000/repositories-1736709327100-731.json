We welcome contributions from people of all backgrounds who are interested in making great software with us.\n\nAt Embark, we aspire to empower everyone to create interactive experiences. To do this, we're exploring and pushing the boundaries of new technologies, and sharing our learnings with the open source community.\n\nIf you have any difficulties getting involved or finding answers to your questions, please don't hesitate to ask your questions in our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/8TW9nfF).\n\nIf you have ideas for collaboration, email us at opensource@embark-studios.com.\n\nWe're also hiring full-time engineers to work with us in Stockholm! Check out our current job postings [here](https://www.embark-studios.com/jobs).\n\n## Issues\n\n### Feature Requests\n\nIf you have ideas or how to improve our projects, you can suggest features by opening a GitHub issue. Make sure to include details about the feature or change, and describe any uses cases it would enable.\n\nFeature requests will be tagged as `enhancement` and their status will be updated in the comments of the issue.\n\n### Bugs\n\nWhen reporting a bug or unexpected behaviour in a project, make sure your issue describes steps to reproduce the behaviour, including the platform you were using, what steps you took, and any error messages.\n\nReproducible bugs will be tagged as `bug` and their status will be updated in the comments of the issue.\n\n### Wontfix\n\nIssues will be closed and tagged as `wontfix` if we decide that we do not wish to implement it, usually due to being misaligned with the project vision or out of scope. We will comment on the issue with more detailed reasoning.\n\n## Contribution Workflow\n\n### Open Issues\n\nIf you're ready to contribute, start by looking at our open issues tagged as [`help wanted`](../../issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A\"help+wanted\") or [`good first issue`](../../issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A\"good+first+issue\").\n\nYou can comment on the issue to let others know you're interested in working on it or to ask questions.\n\n### Making Changes\n\n1. Fork the repository.\n\n2. Create a new feature branch.\n\n3. Make your changes. Ensure that there are no build errors by running the project with your changes locally.\n\n4. Open a pull request with a name and description of what you did. You can read more about working with pull requests on GitHub [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).\n\n5. A maintainer will review your pull request and may ask you to make changes.\n\n## Code Guidelines\n\n### Rust\n\nYou can read about our standards and recommendations for working with Rust [here](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/rust-ecosystem/blob/main/guidelines.md).\n\n### Python\n\nWe recommend following [PEP8 conventions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) when working with Python modules.\n\n### JavaScript\n\nWe follow the [AirBnB JavaScript style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript). You can find the ESLint configuration in relevant repositories.\n\n## Licensing\n\nUnless otherwise specified, all Embark open source projects are licensed under a dual MIT OR Apache-2.0 license, allowing licensees to chose either at their option. You can read more in each project's respective README.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nPlease note that our projects are released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to ensure that they are welcoming places for everyone to contribute. By participating in any Embark open source project, you agree to abide by these terms.\n"

When the outermost scope of a thread is closed, the data stream is sent to a global profiler collector. The scopes are pretty light-weight, costing around 50-200 ns.\n\nYou have to turn on the profiler before it captures any data with a call to `puffin::set_scopes_on(true);`. When the profiler is off the profiler scope macros only has an overhead of 1 ns on an M1 MacBook Pro (plus some stack space).\n\nOnce per frame you need to call `puffin::GlobalProfiler::lock().new_frame();`.\n\n![Puffin Flamegraph using puffin_egui](puffin_egui.gif)\n\n## Remote profiling\n\nYou can use [`puffin_http`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/puffin/tree/main/puffin_http) to send profile events over TCP to [`puffin_viewer`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/puffin/tree/main/puffin_viewer). This is as easy as:\n\n```rs\nfn main() {\n    let server_addr = format!(\"127.0.0.1:{}\", puffin_http::DEFAULT_PORT);\n    let _puffin_server = puffin_http::Server::new(&server_addr).unwrap();\n    eprintln!(\"Run this to view profiling data:  puffin_viewer {server_addr}\");\n    puffin::set_scopes_on(true);\n\n    …\n\n    // You also need to periodically call\n    // `puffin::GlobalProfiler::lock().new_frame();`\n    // to flush the profiling events.\n}\n```\n\n## [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui) integration\n\nTo view the profile data in-game you can use [`puffin_egui`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/puffin/tree/main/puffin_egui).\n\nIf you are using [`eframe`](https://crates.io/crates/eframe) you can look at [this example](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/master/examples/puffin_profiler).\n\n## Other\n\nAlso check out the crate [`profiling`](https://crates.io/crates/profiling) which provides a unifying layer of abstraction on top of `puffin` and other profiling crates.\n\n## Contributing\n\n[![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributor%20covenant-v1.4-ff69b4.svg)](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n\nWe welcome community contributions to this project.\n\nPlease read our [Contributor Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on how to get started.\n\n## Releasing\n\nWe use the [cargo release](https://github.com/crate-ci/cargo-release) tool to manage changelogs, git tags and publishing crates.\n\nEach substantial pull request should add a changelog entry under the `[Unreleased]` section (see [keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com)\nand previous changelog entries).
