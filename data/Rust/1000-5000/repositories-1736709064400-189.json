          "content": "# Contributing\n\nThe best way to interact with this project is and will be a work in progress. However, there are some core tenets based\non my ([@glommer](https://github.com/glommer)) previous experiences (two decades of Linux and Linux-like projects) that\nmay be summarized as follows:\n\n1. Code review is paramount but not enough to block progress on anyone's end. **What is more important is architectural\n   review and unit tests.**\n2. Splitting your changes in easy-to-consume, self-contained pieces is important but not enough to impose a constant\n   burden on the code author.\n\nWriting system-level software is challenging enough as it is; the last thing we want is to add an undue burden on\ncontributors.\n\nIf you are interested in understanding these motivations a bit better, you can check out\n[this article.](https://medium.com/@glaubercosta_11125/the-linux-development-process-is-it-worth-the-hassle-4f09d7ff09a2)\n\n## Pull Request Process\n\nAs of today (September 2021), this is the set of rules that materialize the principles above:\n\n1. **Test your changes.** Unless what you are doing is _absolutely_ trivial, add unit tests. Good unit tests come in\n   bundles, and should test for both the expected and unexpected cases.\n\n2. **Discuss your architecture first.** If you are making changes that add new components, new data structures, or\n   reorganize an existing flow, it is helpful to plan how best to achieve that. A GitHub issue is the place to have this\n   conversation.\n\n3. **Invest in your git log.** If you fix a bug, tell us more about how you found it, in which circumstances it appears,\n   etc. This is important for others as well as for _future you_. Split significant changes in smaller, self-contained\n   commits, so it is easier to follow what you have done. `git add -p` is a powerful tool, and you should use it.\n\n   At the end, if the result is too hard to follow and the change is simple and limited in complexity, **squashing your\n   commits is okay**. Otherwise, if the diff is complex or has a large surface area, we will ask you to rewrite history\n   to preserve the individual commits of your branch.\n\n## Licensing\n\nUnless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the work by you, as\ndefined in the Apache-2.0 license, shall be dual licensed as described in the [README](README.md#license), without any\nadditional terms or conditions.\n"

Tell us about\nexciting applications you are building, ask for help, or just chat with friends 😃\n\n## What is Glommio?\n\nGlommio (pronounced glo-mee-jow or |glomjəʊ|) is a Cooperative Thread-per-Core crate for Rust & Linux based\non `io_uring`. Like other rust asynchronous crates, it allows one to write asynchronous code that takes advantage of\nrust `async`/`await`, but unlike its counterparts, it doesn't use helper threads anywhere.\n\nUsing Glommio is not hard if you are familiar with rust async. All you have to do is:\n\n```rust\nuse glommio::prelude::*;\n\nLocalExecutorBuilder::default().spawn(|| async move {\n    /// your async code here\n})\n.expect(\"failed to spawn local executor\")\n.join();\n```\n\nFor more details check out our [docs page](https://docs.rs/glommio/latest/glommio/) and\nan [introductory article.](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/engineering/introducing-glommio/)\n\n## Supported Rust Versions\n\nGlommio is built against the latest stable release. The minimum supported version is 1.65. The current Glommio version\nis not guaranteed to build on Rust versions earlier than the minimum supported version.\n\n## Supported Linux kernels\n\nGlommio requires a kernel with a recent enough `io_uring` support, at least current enough to run discovery probes. The\nminimum version at this time is 5.8.\n\nPlease also note Glommio requires at least 512 KiB of locked memory for `io_uring` to work. You can increase the\n`memlock` resource limit (rlimit) as follows:\n\n```sh\n$ vi /etc/security/limits.conf\n*    hard    memlock        512\n*    soft    memlock        512\n```\n\n> Please note that 512 KiB is the minimum needed to spawn a single executor. Spawning multiple executors may require you\n> to raise the limit accordingly.\n\nTo make the new limits effective, you need to log in to the machine again. You can verify that the limits are updated by\nrunning the following:\n\n```sh\n$ ulimit -l\n512\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [Contributing.](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n## License\n\nLicensed under either of\n\n* Apache License, Version 2.0 ([LICENSE-APACHE](LICENSE-APACHE) or http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\n* MIT license ([LICENSE-MIT](LICENSE-MIT) or http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n\nat your option.\n"
