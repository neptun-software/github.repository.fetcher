The old behavior\n    interacted poorly with configurations that allowed the pool size to shrink when mostly idle.\n\n## [0.8.2] - 2017-12-24\n\n### Changed\n\n* Upgraded from log 0.3 to 0.4.\n\n## [0.8.1] - 2017-10-28\n\n### Fixed\n\n* Fixed the example in the README.\n\n## [0.8.0] - 2017-10-26\n\n### Changed\n\n* Pool configuration has changed. Rather than constructing a `Config` and passing it to the `Pool`\n    constructor, you now configure a `Builder` which then directly constructs the pool:\n\n    ```rust\n    // In 0.7.x\n    let config = Config::builder()\n        .min_idle(3)\n        .build();\n    let pool = Pool::new(config, manager)?;\n\n    // In 0.8.x\n    let pool = Pool::builder()\n        .min_idle(3)\n        .build(manager)?;\n    ```\n\n* The `Pool::new` method can be used to construct a `Pool` with default settings:\n\n    ```rust\n    // In 0.7.x\n    let config = Config::default();\n    let pool = Pool::new(config, manager)?;\n\n    // In 0.8.x\n    let pool = Pool::new(manager)?;\n    ```\n\n* The `initialization_fail_fast` configuration option has been replaced with separate\n    `Builder::build` and `Builder::build_unchecked` methods. The second returns a `Pool` directly\n    without wrapping it in a `Result`, and does not check that connections are being successfully\n    opened:\n\n    ```rust\n    // In 0.7.x\n    let config = Config::builder()\n        .initialization_fail_fast(false)\n        .build();\n    let pool = Pool::new(config, manager).unwrap();\n\n    // In 0.8.x\n    let pool = Pool::builder().build_unchecked(manager);\n    ```\n\n* The `InitializationError` and `GetTimeout` error types have been merged into a unified `Error`\n    type.\n\n* The `Pool::config` method has been replaced with accessor methods on `Pool` to directly access\n    configuration, such as `Pool::min_idle`.\n\n* The `scheduled_thread_pool` crate has been upgraded from 0.1 to 0.2.\n\n### Removed\n\n* The deprecated `Builder::num_threads` method has been removed. Construct a `ScheduledThreadPool`\n    and set it via `Builder::thread_pool` instead.\n\n## Older\n\nLook at the [release tags] for information about older releases.\n\n[Unreleased]: https://github.com/sfackler/r2d2/compare/v0.8.10...HEAD\n[0.8.10]: https://github.com/sfackler/r2d2/compare/v0.8.9...v0.8.10\n[0.8.9]: https://github.com/sfackler/r2d2/compare/v0.8.8...v0.8.9\n[0.8.7]: https://github.com/sfackler/r2d2/compare/v0.8.6...v0.8.7\n[0.8.6]: https://github.com/sfackler/r2d2/compare/v0.8.5...v0.8.6\n[0.8.5]: https://github.com/sfackler/r2d2/compare/v0.8.4...v0.8.5\n[0.8.4]: https://github.com/sfackler/r2d2/compare/v0.8.3...v0.8.4\n[0.8.3]: https://github.com/sfackler/r2d2/compare/v0.8.2...v0.8.3\n[0.8.2]: https://github.com/sfackler/r2d2/compare/v0.8.1...v0.8.2\n[0.8.1]: https://github.com/sfackler/r2d2/compare/v0.8.0...v0.8.1\n[0.8.0]: https://github.com/sfackler/r2d2/compare/v0.7.4...v0.8.0\n[release tags]: https://github.com/sfackler/r2d2/releases\n"
