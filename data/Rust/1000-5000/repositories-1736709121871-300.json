We wanted a running start for 2025, and qsv 2.0.0 marks qsv's biggest release yet!\n\n* It fully enables the \"Data Resource Upload First (DRUF)\" workflow, allowing Datapusher+ to infer [\"automagical metadata\"](https://dathere.com/2023/11/automagical-metadata/) from the data itself. It exposes two Domain Specific Language (DSL) options - [Luau](https://luau.org) and [MiniJinja](https://docs.rs/minijinja/latest/minijinja/) - to enable powerful data transformation and validation capabilities. This allows data stewards to upload data first, then use qsv's DSL capabilities inside DP+ to automatically generate rich metadata - including data dictionaries, field descriptions, data quality rules, and data validation schemas. This \"automagical metadata\" approach dramatically reduces the friction in compiling high-quality, high-resolution metadata (using the [DCAT-US 3.0 specification](https://doi-do.github.io/dcat-us/) as a reference) that would otherwise be a manual, laborious, and error-prone process.  \nUnder the hood, the `fetchpost`, `template`, `stats`, and `luau` commands now have the necessary scaffolding to fully support this workflow inside Datapusher+ and ckanext-scheming.\n* It adds a new `pivotp` command, powered by Polars, to enable fast pivot operations on large datasets. You can now pivot your data in seconds by simply specifying the columns to pivot on while blowing past [Excel's PivotTable limitations](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/excel-specifications-and-limits-1672b34d-7043-467e-8e27-269d656771c3).\n* `stats` now computes geometric mean and harmonic mean and adds string length stats, all while getting a performance boost.\n* `join` and `joinp` got a lot of love in this release, with several new options:\n  * `joinp`: non-equi join support! 🎉💯🥳<br/> See [\"Lightning Fast and Space Efficient Inequality Joins\" paper](https://vldb.org/pvldb/vol8/p2074-khayyat.pdf) and this [Polars non-equi join tracking issue](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/issues/10068).\n  * `join` & `joinp`: `--right-anti` and `--right-semi` joins\n  * `joinp`: `--ignore-leading-zeros` option for join keys\n  * `joinp`: `--maintain-order` option to maintain the order of the either the left or right dataset in the output\n  * `joinp`: expanded `--cache-schema` options to make `joinp` smarter/faster by leveraging the stats cache\n  * `join`: `--keys-output` option to write successfully joined keys to a separate output file.\n\nThis release lays the groundwork for the [`outliers` \"smart\" command](https://github.com/dathere/qsv/issues/107) to quickly identify outliers using stats/frequency info.\n\nIt also sets the stage for an initial implementation of our [\"Data Concierge\"](https://dathere.com/2024/12/the-golden-rule-of-pragmatic-data-governance/) that leverages all the high-quality, high-res metadata we automagically compile with DRUF to enable *Metadata Gardening Agents* to proactively link seemingly unrelated data and glean insights as it constantly grooms the Data Catalog - effectively making it a ___[FAIR Data](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) Factory___.\n\n---\n\n### Added\n* `fetchpost`: add `--globals-json` option  https://github.com/dathere/qsv/pull/2357\n* `fixlengths`: add `--remove-empty` option; refactored for performance.

https://github.com/dathere/qsv/commit/9c663d84da49cbbe53d7c9df6bd747cad0d9ba24\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/dathere/qsv/compare/0.138.0...1.0.0\n\n## [0.138.0] - 2024-11-05\n\n## Highlights:\n* __:star: New `template` command for rendering templates with CSV data.__  \nThis should allow users to generate very complex documents (Form letters, JSON/XML files, etc.) with the powerful [MiniJinja template engine](https://docs.rs/minijinja/latest/minijinja/) ([Example template](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/blob/master/scripts/template.tpl)).   \n\n* __:star: New `lookup` module for fetching reference data from remote and local files.__  \nIn addition to the typical `http`/`https` schemes for remote files, qsv adds two additional schemes - `CKAN://` and `datHere://`, fetching lookup data from a CKAN site or [datHere maintained](https://data.dathere.com) [reference data](https://github.com/dathere/qsv-lookup-tables) respectively. The lookup module has simple file-based caching as well to minimize repeated fetching of typically static reference data (default cache age: 600 seconds).  \nThe `lookup` module is now being used by the `luau` (for its [`qsv_register_lookup`](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/blob/9036430b1902701eaf60058afce7823810968099/src/cmd/luau.rs#L2034-L2070) helper) and `validate` (for its [`dynamicEnum`](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/blob/9036430b1902701eaf60058afce7823810968099/src/cmd/validate.rs#L35-L72) custom JSON Schema keyword) commands. More commands will take advantage of this module over time (e.g. `apply`, `geocode`, `template`, `sqlp`, etc.) to do extended lookups (e.g. lookup Census information given spatiotemporal data - like demographic info of a Census tract).\n* __:sparkles: Enhanced `fetchpost` with MiniJinja templating for payload construction.__  \nPreviously, `fetchpost` was limited to posting url-encoded HTML Form data. Now with the `--payload-tpl` and `--content-type` options, users can render and post request bodies using MiniJinja using other content types as well (typically `application/json`, `text/plain`, `multipart/form-data`).\n* __:sparkles: Improved Polars integration with automatic schema detection__  \nThe `joinp` and `sqlp` commands now use qsv's stats cache to automatically determine column data types, rather than having Polars scan a sample of rows. This provides two key benefits:\n  1. Faster execution by skipping Polars' schema inference step\n  2. More accurate data type detection since the stats cache analyzes the entire dataset, not just a sample\n* __:running: `fast-float2` crate for faster float parsing__  \nCasting string/bytes to float is now much faster ([2 to 8x faster than Rust's standard library](https://github.com/Alexhuszagh/fast-float-rust?tab=readme-ov-file#performance)) with `fast-float2`.\n* __:muscle: Major dependency updates including [Polars 0.44.2](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/releases/tag/rs-0.44.2), [Luau 0.650](https://github.com/luau-lang/luau/releases/tag/0.650), [mlua 0.10.0](https://github.com/mlua-rs/mlua/releases/tag/v0.10.0) and [jsonschema 0.26.1](https://github.com/Stranger6667/jsonschema/releases/tag/rust-v0.26.1)__  \nThese core crates underpin much of qsv's functionality. Using the latest version of these crates allow qsv to stay true to its goal of being the [fastest and most comprehensive data-wrangling toolkit](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv?tab=readme-ov-file#goals--non-goals).\n\n---\n\n### Added\n* added lookup module - enabling fetching and caching of reference data from remote and local

2024-10-20\n\n### Highlights:\n* `extdedup` and `extsort` now support two modes - LINE mode and CSV mode. Previously, both commands only sorted on a line-by-line basis (now called LINE MODE).<br/>\nWith the addition of CSV MODE, you can now deduplicate or sort CSV files on a column-by-column basis, with the powerful `--select` option to specify which columns to deduplicate or sort on. This is especially useful for large CSV files with many columns, where you only want to deduplicate or sort on a subset of columns.\nAnd since both commands use the disk and are streaming, they can handle files of any size.\n* `sqlp` now has a `--cache-schema` option that caches the schema of the input CSV file, which can significantly speed up subsequent queries on the same file.\n* `fetch` and `fetchpost` have been updated to use the [`jaq`](https://github.com/01mf02/jaq?tab=readme-ov-file#jaq) (a [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/)-like tool for parsing JSON) crate instead of the `jql` crate. This change was made to improve performance and to make the commands more consistent with the `json` command which also uses `jaq`. Furthermore, `jaq` is a clone of `jq` - which is widely used and has a large community, so it should be more familiar to users.\n* `stats` is a tad faster as we keep squeezing more performance from this central command.\n* `validate` is now faster and more memory efficient due to optimizations in the `jsonschema` crate and minor performance improvements in the `validate` command itself.\n\n---\n\n### Added\n* `extdedup`: now supports two modes - LINE mode and CSV mode https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2208\n* `extsort`: now also has two modes - CSV mode and LINE mode https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2210\n* `sqlp`: add `--cache-schema` option https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2224\n* added `sqlp --cache-schema` benchmarks\n\n### Changed\n* `apply` & `applydp`: use smallvec for operations vector & other minor performance optimizations https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2219 & https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/bc837ae698f3aee06ea9b846b98ea0c75820a22d\n* `apply` & `applydp`: specify min_length for parallel iterators https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/7d6ce5ec9675755abd5942a5e9e731592961700d\n* `fetch` & `fetchpost`: replace jql with jaq https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2222\n* `stats`: performance optimizations https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/f205809549ac275078a95bc2821a583611955ad0 https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/e26c27f58df688d7bfb2185ad54d4fe010b1fccf https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/4579c1bfba4eca21d7480694780e39f6966a88a0\n* `validate`: specify min_length for parallel iterators https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/a5b818562d5db7d65f00e5acd2c8bf7d44bd869a\n* build(deps): bump calamine from 0.26.0 to 0.26.1 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2204\n* build(deps): bump csvs_convert from 0.8.14 to 0.9.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2215\n* build(deps): bump flexi_logger from 0.29.2 to 0.29.3 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2209\n* build(deps): bump jsonschema from 0.23.0 to 0.24.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2223\n* build(deps): bump pyo3 from 0.22.3 to 0.22.4 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2207\n* build(deps): bump pyo3 from 0.22.4 to 0.22.5 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2212\n* build(deps): bump redis from 0.27.3 to 0.27.4 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2202\n* build(deps): bump redis from 0.27.4 to 0.27.5 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2217\n* build(deps): bump serde_json from 1.0.129 to 1.0.130 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2218\n* build(deps): bump serde_json from 1.0.131 to 1.0.132 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2220\n* build(deps): bump uuid from 1.10.0 to 1.11.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2213\n* apply select clippy lints\n* bumped indirect dependencies\n* bumped MSRV to 1.82\n\n### Fixed:\n* fix performance regression in batched commands by refactoring `optimal_batch_size` to require indexed CSV files https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2206\n\n### Removed:\n* `fetch` & `fetchpost`: removed jql options; replaced with jaq https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2222\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/compare/0.136.0...0.137.0\n\n## [0.136.0] - 2024-10-08\n\n## Highlights\n\n# :tada: qsv pro is now available in the Microsoft Store!

https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/compare/0.135.0...0.136.0\n\n## [0.135.0] - 2024-09-24\n\n### Highlights\nJSON Schema validation just got a whole lot more powerful with the introduction of the `dynenum` keyword!\nWith `dynenum`, you can now dynamically lookup valid enum values from a CSV (on the filesystem or on a URL), allowing for more flexible and responsive data validation.  \n\nUnlike the standard[`enum` keyword](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/draft-bhutton-json-schema-validation-01#name-enum), `dynenum` does not require hardcoding valid values at schema definition time, and can be used to validate data against a changing set of valid values.  \n\nIn an upcoming qsv pro release, we're making `dynenum` even more powerful by allowing you to specify  high-value reference data (e.g. US Census data, World Bank data, etc.) that is maintained at [data.dathere.com](https://data.dathere.com) and other CKAN instances.\n\nThis release also add the custom [`currency` JSON Schema format](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/blob/90257bbba6d0b1c59c7a6c104b05beae35ae97e1/src/cmd/validate.rs#L23-L31), which enables currency validation according to the [ISO 4217 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).\n\nThe Polars engine was also updated to [0.43.1](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/releases/tag/rs-0.43.1) at the [py-1.81.1 tag](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/releases/tag/py-1.81.1) - making for various under-the-hood improvements for the `sqlp`, `joinp` and `count` commands, as we set the stage for more [Polars-powered features in future releases](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Apolars).\n\n---\n\n### Added\n* `foreach`: enabled `foreach` command on Windows

You just have to try it!\n\nDownload qsv pro v1 now at [qsvpro.dathere.com](https://qsvpro.dathere.com/).\n\nOther highlights include:\n\n- `pro`: new command to allow qsv to interact with the qsv pro API to tap into qsv pro exclusive features.\n- `lens`: new command to interactively view CSVs using the [csvlens](https://github.com/YS-L/csvlens) crate.\n- The ludicrously fast `diff` command is now easier to use with its `--drop-equal-fields` option. @janriemer continues to work on his `csv-diff` crate, and there's more `diff` UX improvements coming soon!\n- `stats` adds `sum_length` and `avg_length` \"streaming\" statistics in addition to the existing `min_length` and `max_length` metrics. These are especially useful for datasets with a lot of \"free text\" columns.\n- `stats` also got \"smarter\" and \"faster\" by [dog-fooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) its own statistics to make it run faster!  \n&nbsp;  \nIt's a little complicated, but the way `stats` works is that it compiles the \"streaming\" statistics on the fly first, and the more expensive advanced statistics are \"lazily\" computed at the end.  \nSince we now compile \"sort order\" in a streaming manner, we use this info when deriving cardinality at the end to see if we can skip sorting - an otherwise necessary step to get cardinality which is done by \"scanning\" all the sorted values of a column. Everytime two neighboring values differ in a sortedcolumn, it increments the cardinality count.  \nApart from this \"sort order\" optimization, we also improved the \"cardinality scan\" algorithm - halving its memory footprint and making it faster still for larger datasets by parallelizing the computation!  \nThis in turn, makes the `frequency` command faster and more memory efficient!\n- we now also use our own fork of the `csv` crate, featuring SIMD-accelerated UTF-8 validation and other minor perf tweaks, making the *entire qsv suite* faster still!\n\n---\n\n### Added\n* `pro`: add `qsv pro` command to interact with qsv pro API by @rzmk in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2039\n* `lens`: new command to interactively view CSVs using the [csvlens](https://github.com/YS-L/csvlens) crate https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2117\n* `apply`: add crc32 operation https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2121\n* `count`: add --delimiter option https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2120\n* `diff`: add flag `--drop-equal-fields` by @janriemer in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2114\n* `stats`: add `sum_length` and `avg_length` columns https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2113\n* `stats`: smarter cardinality computation - added new parallel algorithm for large datasets (10,000+ rows) and updated sequential algorithm for smaller datasets https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/4e63fec61a394ef2ddfa499c0cdd0958e677ad17\n\n### Changed\n* `count`: added comment to justify magic number https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/5241e3972c05f024a0791be04632d03a06b2f9ce\n* `stats`: use simdjson for faster JSONL parsing; micro-optimize `compute` hot loop https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/0e8b73451999a3e95bfd52246b1088aecd64b88f\n* `stats`: standardized OVERFLOW and UNDERFLOW messages https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/38c61285704e5064a63c9dbb1ac866f18fa130fd\n* `sort`: renamed symbol so eliminate devskim lint false positive warning https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/12db7397f68d3199e3311f402d5c7afed586b88c\n* enable `lens` feature in GH workflows https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2122\n* `deps`: bump polars 0.42.0 to latest upstream at time of release https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/3c17ed12c3c763d644d9713afcc8442964f22de3\n* `deps`: use our own optimized fork of csv crate, with simdutf8 validation and other minor perf tweaks https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/e4bcd7123172fa8d8094c305d7780e151c120db1\n* build(deps): bump serde from 1.0.209 to 1.0.210 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2111\n* build(deps): bump serde_json from 1.0.127 to 1.0.128 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2106\n* build(deps): bump qsv-stats from 0.19.0 to 0.22.0 https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2107 https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2112 https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/cb1eb60a0a9fb3b9ba381183a2c29909f82efa42\n* apply select clippy lint suggestions\n* updated several indirect dependencies\n* made various doc and usage text improvements\n\n### Fixed\n* `schema`: Print an error if the `qsv stats` invocation fails by @abrauchli in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2110\n\n## New Contributors\n* @abrauchli made their first contribution in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2110\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/compare/0.133.1...0.134.0\n\n## [0.133.1] - 2024-09-03\n\n### Highlights\nThis release doubles down on Polars' capabilities, as we now, as a matter of [policy track the latest polars upstream](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/blob/0801f678fd55af01ff53f80ee6b22b508e7c3dfb/Cargo.toml#L283-L294). If you think qsv has a torrid release schedule, you should [see Polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/releases). They're constantly fixing bugs, adding new features and optimizations!  \nTo keep up, we've added Polars revision info to the `--version` output, and the `--envlist` option now includes Polars relevant env vars. We've also added a new `POLARS_BACKTRACE_IN_ERR` env var to control whether Polars backtraces are included in error messages.  \nWe also removed the `to parquet` subcommand as its redundant with the Polars-powered `sqlp`'s ability to create parquet files. This also removes the HUGE duckdb dependency, which should markedly make compile times shorter and binaries much smaller.\n\nOther highlights include:\n- New `edit` command that allows you to edit CSV files.\n- The `count` command's `--width` option now includes record width stats beyond max length (avg, median, min, variance, stddev & MAD).\n- The `fixlengths` command now has `--quote` and `--escape` options.\n- The `stats` command adds a `sort_order` streaming statistic.\n\n---\n\n### Added\n* `count`: expanded `--width` options, adding record width stats beyond max length (avg, median, min, variance, stddev & MAD). Also added `--json` output when using `--width`  https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2099\n* `edit`: add `qsv edit` command by @rzmk in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2074\n* `fixlengths`: added `--quote` and `--escape` options https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2104\n* `stats`: add `sort_order` streaming statistic https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2101\n* `polars`: add polars revision info to `--version` output https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/e60e44f99061c37758bd53dfa8511c16d49ceed5\n* `polars`: added Polars relevant env vars to `--envlist` option https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/0ad68fed94f7b5059cca6cf96cec4a3b55638e60\n* `polars`: add & document `POLARS_BACKTRACE_IN_ERR` env var https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/f9cc5595664d4665f0b610fcbac93c30fa445056\n\n### Changed\n* Optimize polars optflags https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2089\n* `deps`: bump polars 0.42.0 to latest upstream at time of release https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/3b7af519343f08919f114c7307f0f561d04f93e8\n* bump polars to latest upstream, removing smartstring https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2091\n* build(deps): bump actions/setup-python from 5.1.1 to 5.2.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2094\n* build(deps): bump flate2 from 1.0.32 to 1.0.33 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2085\n* build(deps): bump flexi_logger from 0.28.5 to 0.29.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2086\n* build(deps): bump indexmap from 2.4.0 to 2.5.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2096\n* build(deps): bump jsonschema from 0.18.0 to 0.18.1 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2084\n* build(deps): bump serde from 1.0.208 to 1.0.209 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2082\n* build(deps): bump serde_json from 1.0.125 to 1.0.127 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2079\n* build(deps): bump sysinfo from 0.31.2 to 0.31.3 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2077\n* build(deps): bump qsv-stats from 0.18.0 to 0.19.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2100\n* build(deps): bump tokio from 1.39.3 to 1.40.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2095\n* apply select clippy lint suggestions\n* updated several indirect dependencies\n* made various doc and usage text improvements\n* pin Rust nightly to 2024-08-26 from 2024-07-26, aligning with Polars pinned nightly\n\n### Fixed\n* Ensure portable binaries are \"added\" to the publish zip archive, instead of replacing all the binaries with just the portable version. Fixes #2083. https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/34ad2067007a86ffad6355f7244163c4105a98f2\n\n### Removed\n* removed `to parquet` subcommand as its redundant with `sqlp`'s ability to create parquet files. This also removes the HUGE duckdb dependency, which should markedly make compile times shorter and binaries much smaller https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2088\n* removed `smartstring` dependency now that Polars has its own compact inlined string type https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/47f047e6ee10916b5caa19ee829471e9fb6f4bea\n* remove `to parquet` benchmark\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/compare/0.132.0...0.133.1\n\n## [0.133.0] - 2024-09-03\nSKIPPED because `cargo publish` was not publishing to crates.io because of a dev dependency issue with `csvs_convert` crate.\n\n## [0.132.0] - 2024-08-21\n\n### Highlights\nWith this release, we finally finish the `stats` caching refactor started in 0.131.0, replacing the binary encoded stats cache with a simpler JSONL cache. The `stats` cache stores the necessary statistical metadata to make several key commands smarter & faster. Per the [benchmarks](https://qsv.dathere.com/benchmarks):\n\n- `frequency` is 6x faster (`frequency_index_stats_mode_auto`).   \nNot only is it faster, it now doesn't need to compile a hashmap for columns with ALL unique values (e.g. ID columns) - practically, making it able to handle \"real-world\" datasets of any size (that is, unless all the columns have ALL unique cardinalities. In that case, the entire CSV will have to fit into memory).\n- `tojsonl` is 2.67x faster (`tojsonl_index`)\n- `schema` is two orders of magnitude (100x) faster!!! (`schema_index`)\n\nThe stats cache also provides the foundation for even more \"smart\" features and commands in the future.  It also has the side-benefit of adding a way to produce stats in JSONL  format that can be used for other purposes beyond qsv.\n\nThe `search`, `searchset`, and `replace` commands now also have a `--literal` option that allows you to search for and replace strings with regex special/reserved characters. This makes it easier to search for and replace strings that contain special characters without having to escape them.\n\n---\n\n### Added\n* `search`, `searchset` & `replace`: add `--literal` option https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2060 & https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/7196053b36c8886092fe25fd030ccf1cf765ed6a\n* `slice`: added usage text examples https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/04afaa3d5a6e51c75f3f9041515c1d7986c45777\n* `publish`: added workflow to build \"portable\" binaries with CPU features disabled\n* `contrib(completions)`: add `--literal` for `search` and `searchset` by @rzmk in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2061\n* `contrib(completions)`: add `--literal` completion to `replace` by @rzmk in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2062\n* add more polars metadata in `--version` info https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2073\n* `docs`: added more info to SECURITY.md https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/609d4df61c93de6959f07e8d972009ae6cd12b78\n* `docs`: expanded Goals/Non-Goals https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/54998e36eb4608a1fba7938836e5985b699e32ff\n* `docs`: added Installation \"Option 0\" quick start https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/bf5bf82105397436d901de247398fce3e808b122\n* added `search --literal` benchmark\n\n### Changed\n* `stats`, `schema`, `frequency` & `tojsonl`: stats caching refactor, replacing binary encoded stats cache with a simpler JSONL cache https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2055\n* rename `stats --stats-json` option to `stats --stats-jsonl` https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2063\n* changed \"broken pipe\" error to a warning https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/73532759a8dad2d643f283296aa402950765b648\n* `docs`: update multithreading and caching sections of PERFORMANCE.md https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/5e6bc455bc544003535e18f99493cc1a20c4a2ce\n* `deps`: switch to our qsv-optimized fork of csv crate https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/3fc1e82c83b5dec23d3ba610e3d0f9bbd2924788\n* `deps`: bump polars from 0.41.3 to 0.42.0 https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2051\n* build(deps): bump actix-web from 4.8.0 to 4.9.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2041\n* build(deps): bump flate2 from 1.0.31 to 1.0.32 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2071\n\n* build(deps): bump indexmap from 2.3.0 to 2.4.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2049\n* build(deps): bump reqwest from 0.12.6 to 0.12.7 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2070\n* build(deps): bump rust_decimal from 1.35.0 to 1.36.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2068\n* build(deps): bump serde from 1.0.205 to 1.0.206 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2043\n* build(deps): bump serde from 1.0.206 to 1.0.207 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2047\n* build(deps): bump serde from 1.0.207 to 1.0.208 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2054\n* build(deps): bump serde_json from 1.0.122 to 1.0.124 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2045\n* build(deps): bump serde_json from 1.0.124 to 1.0.125 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2052\n* apply select clippy lint suggestions\n* updated several indirect dependencies\n* made various usage text improvements\n\n### Fixed\n* `stats`: fix `--output` delimiter inferencing based on file extension https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2065\n* make process_input helper handle stdin better https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2058\n* `docs`: fix completions for `--stats-jsonl` and qsv pro installation text update by @rzmk in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2072\n* `docs`: added Note about why `luau` feature is disabled in musl binaries -

2024-08-09\n\n### Changed\n* deps: bump polars to latest upstream post py-1.41.1 release at the time of this release\n* build(deps): bump filetime from 0.2.23 to 0.2.24 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/2038\n\n### Fixed\n* `frequency`: change `--stats-mode` default to `none` from `auto`.   \nThis is because of a big performance regression when using `--stats-mode auto` on datasets with columns with ALL unique values. \nSee https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/issues/2040 for more info.\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/compare/0.131.0...0.131.1\n\n## [0.131.0] - 2024-08-08\n\n### Highlights\n* __Refactored `frequency` to make it smarter and faster.__   \n`frequency`'s core algorithm essentially compiles an in-memory hashmap to determine the frequency of each unique value for each column. It does this using multi-threaded, multi-I/O techniques to make it blazing fast.   \nHowever, for columns with ALL unique values (e.g. ID columns), this takes a comparatively long time and consumes a lot of memory as it essentially compiles a hashmap of the entire column.  \nNow, with the new `--stats-mode` option (enabled by default), `frequency` can compile the dataset in a more intelligent way by looking up a column's cardinality in the stats cache.  \nIf the cardinality of a column is equal to the CSV's rowcount (indicating a column with ALL unique values), it short-circuits frequency calculations for that column - dramatically reducing the time and memory requirements for the ID column as it eliminates the need to maintain a hashmap for it.  \nPractically speaking, this makes `frequency` able to handle \"real-world\" datasets of any size.  \nTo ensure `frequency` is as fast as possible, be sure to `index` and compute `stats` for your datasets beforehand.\n* __Setting the stage for Datapusher+ v1 and...__  \nThe \"[itches we've been scratching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar#Lessons_for_creating_good_open_source_software)\" the past few months have been informed by our work at several clients towards the release of Datapusher+ 1.0 and qsv pro 1.0 (more info below) - both targeted for release this month.  \n[DP+](https://github.com/dathere/datapusher-plus) is our third-gen, high-speed data ingestion/registration tool for CKAN that uses qsv as its data wrangling/analysis engine. It will enable us to reinvent the way data is ingested into CKAN - with exponentially faster data ingestion, metadata inferencing, data validation, computed metadata fields, and more!  \nWe're particularly excited how qsv will allow us to compute and infer high-quality metadata for datasets (with a focus on inferring optional recommended [DCAT-US v3](https://doi-do.github.io/dcat-us/) metadata fields) in \"near real-time\", while dataset publishers are still entering metadata. This will be a game-changer for CKAN administrators and data publishers!\n* __...qsv pro 1.0__  \n[qsv pro](https://qsvpro.dathere.com) is [datHere](https://dathere.com)'s enterprise-grade data wrangling/curation workbench that’s planned for v1.0 release this month.\nBuilding the core functionality of qsv pro's Workflow feature is one of the primary reasons for a v1.0 release.  \nWe feel qsv pro may be a game-changer for data wranglers and data curators who need to work with spreadsheets and large datasets to view statistical data and metadata while also performing complex data wrangling operations in a user-friendly way without having to write code.\n\n---\n\n### Added\n* `docs`: added Shell Completion section

largest release ever](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/releases/tag/0.129.0), 0.130.0 continues to polish qsv as a data-wrangling engine, packing new features, fixes, and improvements, previewing upcoming features in qsv pro 1.0. Here are a few highlights:\n\n### Highlights\n- Added `.ssv` (semicolon separated values) automatic support. Semicolon separated values are now automatically detected and supported by qsv. Though not as common as CSV, SSV is used in some regions and industries, so qsv now supports it.\n- Added cargo deb compatibility. In preparation for the release of [DataPusher+ 1.0](https://github.com/dathere/datapusher-plus/tree/master), we're now making it easier to upgrade `qsvdp` so [CKAN](https://ckan.org) administrators can install and upgrade it more easily, using `apt-get install qsvdp` or `apt-get upgrade qsvdp`.\nDP+ is our next-gen, high-speed data ingestion tool for CKAN. Its not only a robust, fast, validating data pump that guarantees high quality data, it also does extended analysis to infer and derive high-quality metadata - what we call \"[automagical metadata](https://dathere.com/2023/11/automagical-metadata/)\".\n- Upgraded to the latest Polars upstream at the [py-polars-1.3.0](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/releases/tag/py-1.3.0) tag. [Polars tops the TPC-H Benchmark](https://pola.rs/posts/benchmarks/) and is several orders of magnitude faster than traditional dataframe libraries (cough - 🐼 pandas). qsv proudly rides the 🐻‍❄️ Polars bear to get subsecond response times even with very large datasets!\n- qsv v0.130.0 shell completions files are available for download [here](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/tree/master/contrib/completions/examples). With shell completions, pressing tab in a compatible shell may provide suggestions for various qsv commands, subcommands, and options that you may choose from. Supported shells include bash, zsh, powershell, fish, nushell, fig, and elvish.

There are multiple exercises planned, but feel free to try out the first few available lessons/exercises by visiting [100.dathere.com](https://100.dathere.com) and star the source code's repository [here](https://github.com/dathere/100.dathere.com).\n\n</details>\n\n<details><summary><strong>New <a href=\"https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/tree/master/contrib/completions\">multi-shell completions draft</a></strong> (bash, zsh, powershell, fish, nushell, fig, elvish)</summary>\n\nThere's a draft of more qsv shell completion support including 7 different shells! The plan is to add the rest of the commands in this implementation since we can use one codebase to generate the 7 shell completion script files. Feel free to try out the various shell completions in the `examples` folder from [`contrib/completions`](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/tree/master/contrib/completions) to verify if the examples work (as of today's release date only `qsv count` and `qsv clipboard` may be available) and also contribute to adding the rest of the completions if you know a bit of Rust.\n\nThe existing <a href=\"https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/tree/master/contrib/bashly\">Bash shell completions for v0.129.0</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/tree/master/contrib/fish\">fish shell completions draft</a> are available for now as the multi-shell completions draft is being developed.\n\n| Bash completions demo                            | Fish completions demo                            |\n| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |\n| ![qsv Bash completions demo](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/assets/30333942/bec4b9ae-584a-49ad-8ced-c765174e8113) | ![qsv Fish completions demo](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/assets/30333942/fafbf40b-9ea3-4ec4-ae22-9ae3319ce400) |\n\nWith shell completions enabled, you may identify qsv commands more easily when pressing the `tab` key on your keyboard in certain positions using the relevant Bash or fish shell from your terminal. You may follow the instructions from 100.dathere.com [here](https://100.dathere.com/exercises-setup.html#bash) to learn how to install the Bash completions and under the Usage section [here](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/tree/master/contrib/fish#usage) for fish shell completions. Note that the fish shell completions are incomplete and both of the implementations may be replaced by the multi-shell completions implementation once complete.\n\n</details>\n\n<details><summary><strong><a href=\"https://qsvpro.dathere.com\">qsvpro.dathere.com</a></strong> - Preview: Download spreadsheets from a compatible CKAN instance into the qsv pro Workflow</summary>\n\n> This is a preview of a feature, meaning it is planned for an upcoming release but may change by the time it is released.\n\n![qsv-pro-ckan-download-demo](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/assets/30333942/9f4931ce-f51e-4266-9c22-e568d10ed811)\n\nIn addition to importing local spreadsheet files and uploading to a CKAN instance, this new feature allows users to select a locally registered CKAN instance where they have the `create_dataset` permission to download a spreadsheet file from their CKAN instance and load the new local spreadsheet file into the Workflow. qsv pro's Workflow would therefore have both upload and download capability to and from a compatible CKAN instance.\n\n</details>\n<details><summary><strong><a href=\"https://qsvpro.dathere.com\">qsvpro.dathere.com</a></strong> - Preview: Attempt SQL query generation from natural language with a compatible LLM API instance</summary>\n\n> This is a preview of a feature, meaning it is planned for an upcoming release but may change by the time it is released.\n> Also note that this video is sped up as you may see by the notes that pop up (you may pause the video to read them).\n\nhttps://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/assets/30333942/e90893e6-3196-4fa6-bce0-f69a9f6347f2\n\nLeveraging [`qsv describegpt`](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/tree/master/src/cmd/describegpt.rs)'s AI integration capabilities along with multiple other qsv commands, qsv pro's Workflow's existing SQL query tab now has a generator that may ***attempt*** to generate a SQL query natural language using an LLM API compatible with OpenAI's API specification  such as running an [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) (v0.2.0 or above) server locally and  ***attempt*** to generate a SQL query by asking a question related to your spreadsheet data. Results may vary depending on your configuration and you may need to fix the generated output. For example in the demo we asked for ***who*** has the highest salary but extra information and only the highest salary was provided, though this does give a query we can modify and work with.\n\n<details><summary>Note on Ask and <code>qsv describegpt</code></summary>\n\nWe mention ***attempt*** since LLMs can produce incorrect output, even output that *seems* correct but is not. We mention that \"inaccurate information\" may be produced within `qsv describegpt`'s usage text too along with AI-generated output potentially being incorrect within qsv pro, so make sure the output is fixed and verified before using it in production use cases.\n\n</details>\n</details>\n\n<details><summary><h2>🔁 Changelog</h2></summary>\n\n### Added\n\n* `clipboard`: add `qsv clipboard` command for clipboard input/output by @rzmk in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1953\n* `describegpt`: add `--prompt` for custom prompt & update prompt file + docs by @rzmk in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1862\n* `describegpt`: add base_url, model, ollama, & timeout to prompt file by @rzmk in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1859\n* `enum`: add  `--hash` option to create a platform-independent deterministic id https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1902\n* `enum`: add `--uuid7` option to create UUID v7 identifiers https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1914\n* `freq`: add  `--no-trim` option  https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1944\n* `foreach`: add sample Windows implementation by @rzmk in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1847\n* `joinp`: add `--right` outer join option https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1945\n* `json`: change jsonp to json using new implementation by @rzmk in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1924\n* `json`: add `--jaq` option to allow jq-like filtering & test by @rzmk in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1959\n* `jsonp`: add `jsonp` command allowing non-nested JSON to CSV conversion with Polars by @rzmk in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1880\n* `prompt`: add `qsv prompt` to pick a file with a file dialog & write to stdout by @rzmk in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1860\n* `prompt`: add `--fd-output` (`-f`) & `--output` (`-o`) options by @rzmk in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1861\n* `select`: add `--sort`, `--random` & `--seed` options; also add 9999 sentinel value to indicate last column https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1867\n* `select`: use underscore char (_) to indicate last column, replacing 9999 sentinel value https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1873\n* `sqlp`: add `--streaming` option https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/e8bee9a60dccc6ec5b5a43b91cb6f558915faa0e\n* `stats`: add Standard Error of the Mean (SEM) & Coefficient of Variation (CV) https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1857\n* `validate`: added custom JSONschema format \"currency\" (decimal with 2 decimal places).

Edition - [_¡Ándale! ¡Ándale! ¡Arriba! ¡Arriba!_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bmiDLH5htU) 🎉 #\n\nYii-hah! We're Mexico bound as we head to [csv,conf,v8](https://csvconf.com) to present and share qsv with fellow data-makers and wranglers from all over!\n\nAnd we've packed a lot into this release for the occcasion:\n* `search` got a lot of love as it now powers `qsv-pro`'s new `search` feature to get near-instant search results even on large datasets.\n* `stats` - the ❤️ of qsv, now has cache fine-tuning options with the `--cache-threshold` option. It now also computes `max_precision` for floats and `is_ascii` for strings. It also has a new `--round` 9999 sentinel value to suppress rounding of statistics.\n* `schema` & `tojsonl` are now faster thanks to `stats --cache-threshold` autoindex creation/deletion logic.\n* We [upgraded Polars to 0.40.0](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/releases/tag/rs-0.40.0) for even more speed and stability for the `count`, `joinp` & `sqlp` commands.\n* `count` now has an additional blazing fast counting mode using Polars' `read_csv()` table function.\n* `frequency` gets some micro-optimizations for even faster frequency analysis.\n* `luau` is bundled with luau [0.625](https://github.com/luau-lang/luau/releases/tag/0.625) from [0.622](https://github.com/luau-lang/luau/releases/tag/0.622). We also upgraded the bundled LuaDate library [from 2.2.0 to 2.2.1](https://github.com/Tieske/date?tab=readme-ov-file#changes).\n\nOverall, qsv manages to keep its performance edge despite the addition of new capabilities and features, and we'll give a whirlwind tour in [our talk at csv,conf,v8](https://csvconf.com/schedule/). \n\nWe'll also preview what we've been calling the __People's APPI__ - our _\"Answering People/Policymaker Interface\"_ in [qsv pro](https://qsvpro.dathere.com). This is a new way to interact with qsv that's more conversational and less command-line-y using a natural language interface. It's a way to make qsv more accessible to more people, especially those who are not comfortable with the command line.\n\nWe're excited to share these with the csv,conf,v8 community and the wider world! Nos vemos en Puebla!\n\n[_¡Ándele! ¡Ándele! ¡Epa! ¡Epa! ¡Epa!_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cc-3wVQuD7k)\n\n---\n\n### Added\n* `count`: additional Polars-powered counting mode using `read_csv()`

#\nThis a quick release adding several `frequency` enhancements for more detailed frequency analysis. The `frequency` command now includes a percentage column, calculates `other` values, and supports limiting unique counts and negative limits.\nThese options provides additional context for qsv-pro and `describegpt` so their metadata inferences are more accurate and comprehensive.\n\nPreviously, for a 775-row CSV file containing one column named `state` with entries for all 50 states, `frequency` only showed:\n\n```\nfield,value,count\nstate,NY,100\nstate,NJ,70\nstate,CA,60\nstate,MA,55\nstate,FL,45\nstate,TX,43\nstate,NM,40\nstate,AZ,39\nstate,NV,38\nstate,MI,35\n```\n\nNow, there's a new `percentage` column and `other` values calculation, both of which have configurable options:\n\n```\nfield, value, count, percentage\nstate, NY, 100, 12.90\nstate, NJ, 70, 9.03\nstate, CA, 60, 7.74\nstate, MA, 55, 7.10\nstate, FL, 45, 5.81\nstate, TX, 43, 5.55\nstate, NM, 40, 5.16\nstate, AZ, 39, 5.03\nstate, NV, 38, 4.90\nstate, MI, 35, 4.52\nstate, Other (40), 250, 32.26\n```\n\nThis release is also out of cycle to address a big performance regression in the `excel` command caused by unnecessary formula info retrieval for the `--error-format` option introduced in 0.126.0. This has been fixed, and the `excel` command is now back to its speedy self.\n\n---\n\n### Added\n* `frequency`: added percentage column;  `other` values calculation, implementing https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/issues/1774 https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1775\n* `benchmarks`: added new `frequency` and `excel` benchmarks https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/b83ad3aae1cdf9a1750201cbf9b3ccd4ac3a4192\n\n### Changed\n* contrib(bashly): update completions.bash for qsv v0.126.0 by @rzmk in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1771\n* build(deps): bump mimalloc from 0.1.39 to 0.1.41 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1772\n* build(deps): bump qsv-stats from 0.14.0 to 0.15.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1773\n* updated several indirect dependencies\n* applied select clippy recommendations\n\n### Fixed\n* `excel`: fixed performance regression because qsv was unnecessarily getting formula info (an expensive operation) for `--error-format` option even when not required https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/772af3420c44c864e06cd2cb61606900bff17947\n* renamed 0.126.0 sqlp_vs_duckdb benchmark results so they're not to each other for easy direct comparison https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/7bcd59e301965b9e8737a9230d1236e8d34ab4bf\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/compare/0.126.0...0.127.0\n\n## [0.126.0] - 2024-04-22\n\n# 🤖 Expanded Metadata Inferencing 🤖 #\n\n`describegpt` headlines this release, with its new ability to support other local Large Language Models (LLMs) such as [Ollama](https://ollama.com) and [Jan](https://jan.ai).

Previously, `count` was already using Polars, but it mistakenly fell back to a slower counting mode. Now, it consistently delivers fast performance, even without an index.\n\nThe `datefmt` command also got a tad faster while also being enhanced with new timezone and timestamp options.\n\nLastly, we are excited to announce that qsv will be attending the [CSV,Conf,V8](https://csvconf.com) conference in Puebla, Mexico on May 28-29. I'll be presenting a talk titled \"qsv: A Blazing Fast CSV Data-Wrangling Toolkit\".

For comparison, let's contrast qsv's performance against \"traditional\" SQL engines\nthat require setup and import (aka ETL).   Not counting setup and import time (which alone, takes several minutes), we get:\n\n#### **sqlite3.43.2** takes 2.910 seconds - 20.79x slower\n```sql\nsqlite> .timer on\nsqlite> select VendorID,sum(total_amount) from taxi group by VendorID order by VendorID;\n1,52377417.53\n2,89959869.13\n4,600584.61\nRun Time: real 2.910 user 2.569494 sys 0.272972\n```\n#### **PostgreSQL 15.6** using PgAdmin 4 v6.12 takes 18.527 seconds - 132.34x slower\n \n![Screenshot 2024-03-06 at 10 14 04 AM](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/assets/1980690/5f7a0eca-d035-46b7-b4df-15991f92c00f)\n\n#### even with an index, qsv sqlp is still 5.96x faster\n\n<img width=\"996\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-03-08 at 7 57 57 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/assets/1980690/e2919dc6-68fd-4ad9-a56d-9a4dc105b59f\">\n\n\n* `sqlp` now supports JSONL output format and adds compression support for Avro and Arrow output formats.\n* `fetch` now has a `--disk-cache` option, so you can cache web service responses to disk, complete with cache control and expiry handling!\n* `jsonl` is now multithreaded with additional `--batch` and `--job` options.\n* `split` now has three modes: split by record count, split by number of chunks and split by file size.\n* `datefmt` is a new top-level command for date formatting.

https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/compare/0.122.0...0.123.0\n\n## [0.122.0] - 2024-01-17\n\n## 👉  **REQUEST FOR USE CASES**: 👈 \nPlease help define the future of qsv.\nAdd what you're currently using qsv for here - https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/discussions/1529\n\nNot only does it help us catalog what use cases we should optimize for, posters will get higher priority access to the qsv pro preview.\n\n## Highlights:\n* `qsvpy` is now available in the prebuilt binaries for select platforms! It's a new qsv binary variant with the python feature, enabling the `py` command. Three subvariants are available - qsvpy310, qsvpy311 and qsvpy312, corresponding to Python 3.10, 3.11 and 3.12 respectively.\n* Removed `generate` command as `generate`'s main dependency is unmaintained and has old dependencies. `generate` was also not used much, as the test data it generated was not well suited for training models and it was too slow so we decided to remove it even before the `fake` (#235) command is ready.\n* `reverse` now has index support and can work in \"streaming\" mode.\n* `sort` and `sample` now have faster and cryptosecure Random Number Generators (RNG) with the `--rng` option.\n* `pseudo` now has `--start`, `--increment` & `--formatstr` options.\n* `fmt` now has a `--no-final-newline` option to suppress the final newline for better interoperability with other tools, specifically Excel. It also treats \"T\" as special value for tab character for the `--out-delimiter` option.\n\n---\n\n### Added\n* `reverse`: now has index support and can work in \"streaming\" mode https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1531\n* `sort`: added `--rng <kind>` for different kinds of RNGs - standard, faster & cryptosecure https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1535\n* `sample`: added `--rng <kind>` option (standard, faster & cryptosecure) https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1532\n* `pseudo`: major refactor. Added `--start`, `--increment` & `--formatstr` options https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1541\n* `fmt`:  add `--no-final-newline` option https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1545\n* added additional benchmarks\n* added additional test for new options.  We now have ~1,300 tests!\n\n### Changed\n* `fmt`: `--out-delimiter` now treats \"T\" as special value for tab character https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1546\n* build(deps): bump whatlang from 0.16.3 to 0.16.4 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1525\n* build(deps): bump serde_json from 1.0.110 to 1.0.111 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1524\n* build(deps): bump pyo3 from 0.20.1 to 0.20.2 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1526\n* build(deps): bump sysinfo from 0.30.3 to 0.30.4 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1523\n* build(deps): bump sysinfo from 0.30.4 to 0.30.5 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1530\n* build(deps): bump serial_test from 2.0.0 to 3.0.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1534\n* build(deps): bump mlua from 0.9.2 to 0.9.3 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1540\n* build(deps): bump mlua from 0.9.3 to 0.9.4 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1542\n* build(deps): bump simple-home-dir from 0.2.1 to 0.2.3 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1544\n* apply select clippy suggestions\n* update several indirect dependencies\n\n### Removed\n* removed `generate` command https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1527\n* removed `generate` feature from GitHub Action workflows https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1528\n* `sample`: removed `--faster` RNG sampling option https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1532\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/compare/0.121.0...0.122.0\n\n## [0.121.0] - 2024-01-03\n\nWe just released 0.120.0 two days ago, and hours later, Polars 0.36 was released, Homebrew released support for Rust 1.75.0 and our [pull request for cached](https://github.com/jaemk/cached/pull/176) was merged!\n\nSo we're releasing 0.121.0 out of cycle to take advantage of the latest features and performance improvements of these critical components that underpin qsv!\n\n---\n\n### Added\n* `sqlp`: with Polars 0.36, it now supports:\n  * subqueries for JOIN and FROM\n  * REGEXP and RLIKE pattern matching\n  * common variant spelling STDEV in the SQL engine (in addition to STDDEV)\n  * and more [under the hood improvements](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/releases)!\n* `sqlp`: now supports writing to Apache Avro format https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/32f2fbb1b06dfbee4e7823521e9991a306e7eb44\n* `sqlp`: when writing to CSV format, if a file has a TSV or TAB extension, it will automatically use the tab delimiter https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/c97048cfc8c0fed01d7b32d3173be508135b9769\n\n### Changed\n* Bump polars from 0.35 to 0.36 https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1521\n* build(deps): bump serde from 1.0.193 to 1.0.194 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1520\n* build(deps): bump serde_json from 1.0.109 to 1.0.110 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1519\n* build(deps): bump semver from 1.0.20 to 1.0.21 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1518\n* build(deps): bump serde_stacker from 0.1.10 to 0.1.11 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1517\n* build(deps): bump cached from 0.46.1 to 0.47.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1522\n* bumped MSRV to 1.75.0\n\n### Fixed\n* `cat`: fixed performance regression in `rowskey` by moving unchanging variables out of hot loop - https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/96a40e93b5ab09655aa90f8653014c96d3da652b\n* `sqlp`: Polars 0.36 fixed the SQL SUBSTR() function\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/compare/0.120.0...0.121.0\n\n## [0.120.0] - 2024-01-01\n\nHappy New Year! 🎉🎉🎉\nHere's the first release of 2024, the biggest ever with 280+ commits! qsv 0.120.0 continues to focus on performance, stability and reliability as we continue setting the stage for qsv's big brother - qsv pro.\n\nApart from wrapping qsv with a User Interface, qsv pro also comes with a retinue of related cloud-based data cleaning, enrichment and enhancement services along with expanded metadata inferencing to make your _*Data Useful, Usable and Used!*_\n\nqsv pro draws inspiration from [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org), but reimagined without its file size and speed limitations, with qsv pro having ability to process multi-gigabyte files in seconds.\n\nIt incorporates hard lessons we learned in the past 12 years deploying Data Portals and Data Pipelines to create a new Data/Metadata Wrangling and AI-assisted Data Publishing service that's easy to use for casual Excel users and Data Publishers, yet powerful enough for data scientists and data engineers.\n\nBut it's not quite ready for release yet, so stay tuned!\n\nWe're now taking signups for a preview release however, so if you're interested, please [sign up here](https://dathere.com/qsv-feedback-form/)!\n\nExcitingly, qsv was also mentioned on Hacker News in [this thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38733617) Dec 23, 2023! As a result, we're now almost at 2,000+ stars on GitHub from 900 stars on Dec 22! 🎉🎉🎉\n\nStay tuned for more advancements in 2024 – it's set to be a landmark year for qsv! 🦄🦄🦄\n\n---\n\n### Added\n*

2023-10-27\n\n## Highlights:\n* With the Polars upgrade to [0.34.2](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/releases/tag/rs-0.34.0), the `sqlp` and `joinp` enjoy [expanded](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/blob/rs-0.34.0/crates/polars-sql/src/functions.rs\n) [capabilities](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/blob/rs-0.34.0/crates/polars-sql/src/keywords.rs) and a noticeable performance boost. 🦄🏇\n* We now publish the 500, 1000, 5000 and 15000 Geonames cities indices for the `geocode` command, with users able to easily switch indices with the `index-load` subcommand. As the name implies, the 500 index contains cities with populations of 500 or more, the 1000 index contains cities with populations of 1000 or more, and so on.   \nThe 15000 index (default) is the smallest (13mb) and fastest with ~26k cities. The 500 index is the largest(56mb) and slowest, with ~200k cities.  The 5000 index is 21mb with ~53k cities. The 1000 index is 44mb with ~140k cities. 🎠\n* The `geocode` command now returns US Census FIPS codes for US places with the `%json` and `%pretty-json` formats, returning both US State and US County FIPS codes, with upcoming support for Cities and other US Census geographies (School Districts, Voting Districts, Congressional Districts, etc.) 🎠\n* Improved performance for `stats`, `schema` and `tojsonl` commands with the stats cache bincode refactor. This is especially noticeable for large CSV files as `stats`  previously created large bincode cache files by default.   \nThe bincode cache allows other commands (currently, only `schema` and `tojsonl`) to skip recomputing statistics and deserialize the saved stats data structures directly into memory. Now, it will only create a bincode file if the `--stats-binout` option is specified (typically, before using the `schema` an `tojsonl` commands). `stats` will still continue to create a stats CSV cache file by default, but it will be much smaller than the bincode file, and is universally applicable, unlike the bincode cache. 🏇\n* self-update will now verify updates. This is done by verifying the [zipsign](https://crates.io/crates/zipsign) signature of the release zip archive before applying it. This should make it harder for malicious actors to compromise the self-update process. Version 0.118.0 has the verification code, and future releases will use this new verification process.\nRegardless, we will zipsign all zip archives starting with this release.\nUsers can manually verify the signatures by downloading the zipsign public key and running the `zipsign` command line tool. See [Verifying the Integrity of the Prebuilt Binaries Zip Archive](README.md#verifying-the-integrity-of-the-prebuilt-binaries-zip-archives) for more info. 🦄\n* The `frequency` command now supports the `--ignore-case` option for case-insensitive frequency counts. 🦄🎠\n* The `schema` command can now compile case-insensitive enum constraints. 🦄\n* Improved performance for `apply` and `applydp` commands with faster compile-time perfect hash functions for operations lookups. 🏇\n* Several minor performance improvements and bug fixes with `snappy`, `sniff` & `cat` commands. 🏇\n\n---\n\n### Added\n* `frequency`: added `--ignore-case` option https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1386\n* `geocode`: added 500, 1000, 5000, 15000 Geonames cities convenience shortcuts to `index` subcommands https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/bd9f4c34b0a88cc6a446872ed4cda41e8a1ca102\n* `schema`: added `--ignore-case` option when compiling enum constraints; replaced Hashset with faster AHashset https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/a16a1ca25f93699a5ee27327f4257e8e559bc5e8\n* `snappy`: added `buf_size` param to compress helper fn https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/e0c0d1f7eb22917d43f638121babe23e366c9dd8\n* `sniff` added `--just-mime` option https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1372\n* added zipsign signature verification to self-update https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1389\n\n### Changed\n* `apply` & `applydp`: replaced binary_search with faster compile-time perfect hash functions for operations lookups https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1371\n* `stats`, `schema` and `tojsonl`:  stats cache bincode refactor https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1377\n* `luau`: replaced sanitise-file-name with more popular sanitize-filename crate https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/8927cb70bc92e9e1360547e96d1ac10e6037e9e3\n* `cat`: minor optimization by preallocating with capacity https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/c13c34120c47bb7ab603a97a0a7cae7f0de7b146\n* `sqlp` & `joinp`: expanded speed/functionality with upgrade to Polars 0.34.2 https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1385\n* `tojsonl`: improved boolean inferencing.

This paves the way to doing data enrichment lookups (starting with the US Census) in an upcoming release.\n* Added [Goal/Non-goals](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv#goals--non-goals), explicitly codifying what qsv is and isn't, and what we're trying to achieve with the toolkit.\n* `excel`: CSV output processing is now multithreaded, making it a bit faster. The bottleneck is still the Excel/ODS library we're using ([calamine](https://github.com/tafia/calamine)), which is single-threaded. But there are [active](https://github.com/tafia/calamine/issues/346) [discussions](https://github.com/tafia/calamine/issues/362) underway to make it much faster in the future.\n* Upgrading the MSRV to 1.73.0 has allowed us to use LLVM 17, which has resulted in an overall performance boost.\n\n---\n\n### Added:\n* `geocode`: added Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) codes to results for US places.\n* Added Goals/Non-goals to README.md\n\n### Changed\n* `cat` : minor optimization https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/343bb668ae84fcf862883245382e7d8015da88c2\n* `excel`: CSV output processing is now multithreaded https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1360\n* `geocode`: more efficient dynfmt ptocessing https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1367\n* `frequency`: optimize allocations before hot loop https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/655bebcdec6d89f0ffa33d794069ee5eee0df3e5\n* `luau`: upgraded embedded Luau from 0.596 to 0.599\n* `deps`: bump calamine from 0.22.0 to 0.22.1 https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/4c4ed7e25614bbfe4d7b16fe7619a5a874ef7591\n* `docs`: reorganized README, moving FEATURES and INTERPRETERS to their own markdown files.\n* build(deps): bump byteorder from 1.4.3 to 1.5.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1347\n* build(deps): bump tokio from 1.32.0 to 1.33.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1354\n* build(deps): bump regex from 1.9.6 to 1.10.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1356\n* build(deps): bump semver from 1.0.19 to 1.0.20 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1358\n* build(deps): bump pyo3 from 0.19.2 to 0.20.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1359\n* build(deps): bump serde from 1.0.188 to 1.0.189 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1361\n* build(deps): bump flate2 from 1.0.27 to 1.0.28 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1363\n* build(deps): bump regex from 1.10.0 to 1.10.1 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1366\n* `deps`: update several indirect dependencies\n* pin Rust nightly to 2023-10-14\n* bump MSRV to 1.73.0\n\n### Removed\n* `excel`: removed `--progressbar` option as Excel/ODS maximum sheet size is just too small (1,048,576 rows) to make it useful. \n\n### Fixed\n* Fixed Jupyter Notebook Viewer Link  by @a5dur in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1349\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/compare/0.116.0...0.117.0\n\n## [0.116.0] - 2023-10-05\n\n## Highlights: :tada: :rocket:\n* Benchmarks refinements galore with more benchmarks and more comprehensive benchmarking instructions. 🎠\n* `geocode`: The Geonames index's configuration metadata is now available with the `geocode index-check` command.

This should help users maintain several Geonames index files with different configurations. 🎠\n\n`geocode` should also be a tad faster now, thanks to `cached` crate making ahash its default hashing algorithm and upgrading `hashbrown` - microbenchmarks show a 33% performance improvement. 🏇🏽\n\nWe also added a `release-samply` profile so we can make it easier to squeeze more performance out of the toolkit with [`samply`](https://github.com/mstange/samply/#samply). 🏇🏽\n\n---\n\n### Added\n* `geocode`: added a JSON file describing the Geonames index file configuration in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1324\n* `benchmarks`: v3.0.0 release\n  * added `setup` argument to setup and install required tools for the benchmark suite\n  * added more comprehensive required tools check\n  * added more realistic luau benchmarks, using helper luau scripts\n    (dt_format.luau and turnaround_time.luau)\n  * added stats with_cache and create_cache benchmarks\n  * added benchmark_aggregations.luau script for benchmark analysis\n  * captured `binary`, `total_mean` and `qsv_env` columns to benchmark results\n    `binary` is the qsv binary variant used\n    `total_mean` is the sum of all the mean run times of the benchmarks\n    `qsv_env` are the qsv-relevant environment variables active while running the benchmarks\n  * expanded README.md and benchmark suite usage instructions\n* added `release-samply` profile to Cargo.toml to facilitate continued performance optimization with [`samply`](https://github.com/mstange/samply/#samply)\n\n### Changed\n* `readme`: move tab completion instructions/script to scripts/misc\n* `geocode`: updated bundled Geonames index to 2021-09-25\n* bump embedded luau from 0.594 to 0.596\n* build(deps): bump flexi_logger from 0.26.1 to 0.27.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1317\n* build(deps): bump indicatif from 0.17.6 to 0.17.7 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1318\n* build(deps): bump semver from 1.0.18 to 1.0.19 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1320\n* build(deps): bump cached from 0.45.1 to 0.46.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1322\n* build(deps): bump geosuggest-core from 0.4.3 to 0.4.5 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1323\n* build(deps): bump geosuggest-utils from 0.4.3 to 0.4.5 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1321\n* build(deps): bump fastrand from 2.0.0 to 2.0.1 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1325\n* bump MSRV from Rust 1.72.0 to 1.72.1\n* cargo update bump several indirect dependencies\n* pin Rust nightly to 2023-09-25\n\n### Fixed\n* `benchmarks`: fixed invalid luau benchmark that had invalid luau command\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/compare/0.114.0...0.115.0\n\n## [0.114.0] - 2023-09-21 🏇🏽🎠\nThe long-overdue Benchmarks revamp is finally here! 🎉\n\nThe benchmarks have been completely rewritten to be more reproducible, and now use [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine#hyperfine) instead of `time`.  The new benchmarks are now run as part of the release process, and the results are compiled into a single page that is published on the new [Quicksilver website](https://qsv.dathere.com/benchmarks/).\n\nThe new benchmarks are also more comprehensive, and designed to be run on a variety of hardware and operating systems. This allows users to adapt the benchmarks to their own workloads and environments.\n\nOther release highlights include:\n* [`geocode`](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/blob/master/src/cmd/geocode.rs#L2) is now fully-featured and ready for production use! 🎉 Though it only currently features Geonames city-level lookup support, it provides a solid foundation on top of which we'll add more geocoding providers in the future (next up - [OpenCage support](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/issues/1295) with street-level geocoding).\n* [Polars](https://www.pola.rs) has been bumped from 0.32.1 to [0.33.2](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/releases/tag/rs-0.33.0), which includes a number of performance improvements for the `sqlp` and `joinp` commands.\n* major performance increase on several `regex`/`aho-corasick` powered commands on Apple Silicon thanks to various under-the-hood improvements in the [`aho-corasick`](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/16lvyyg/ahocorasick_and_thus_the_regex_crate_too_now_uses/) crate.\n\n---\n\n### Added\n* Added autoindex size threshold, replacing `QSV_AUTOINDEX` env var with `QSV_AUTOINDEX_SIZE`. Resolves #1300. in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1301 https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/69e25aceb25d3bb20d8fdeeadf5504d8fe75fe37\n* `diff`: Added test for different delimiters by @janriemer in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1297\n* `benchmarks`: Added qsv benchmark notebook. by @a5dur in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1309\n* `geocode`: Added `countryinfo/now` subcommand made available in geosuggest 0.4.3 https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1311\n* `geocode`: Added `--language` option so users can specify the language of the geocoding results. This requires running the `index-update` subcommand with the `--languages` option to rebuild the index with the desired languages.\n* `sqlp`: add example of using columns with embedded spaces in SQL queries https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/f7bf4f65edc2068f42712808aec7096ef7122dfe\n\n### Changed\n* `benchmarks`: Benchmarks revamped https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1298, https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1310 https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/d8eeb949b8c846793941eb9c343e8598784b6207\n* build(deps): bump serde_json from 1.0.106 to 1.0.107 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1302\n* build(deps): bump mimalloc from 0.1.38 to 0.1.39 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1303\n* build(deps): bump simple-home-dir from 0.1.4 to 0.2.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1304\n* build(deps): bump chrono from 0.4.30 to 0.4.31 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1305\n* (deps): bump Polars from 0.32.1 to Polars 0.33.2 https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1308\n* build(deps): bump cpc from 1.9.2 to 1.9.3 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1313\n* build(deps): bump rayon from 1.7.0 to 1.8.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1315\n* (deps): update several indirect dependencies\n* pin Rust nightly to 2023-09-21\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/compare/0.113.0...0.114.0\n\n## [0.113.0] - 2023-09-08 🦄🏇🏽🎠\nThis is the first \"[Unicorn](https://7esl.com/unicorn/)\" 🦄 release, adding MAJOR new features to the toolkit!\n\n* `geocode`: adds high-speed, cache-backed, multithreaded geocoding using a local, updateable copy of the [GeoNames](https://www.geonames.org/) database.  This is a major improvement over the previous `geocode` subcommand in the `apply` command thanks to the wonderful [geosuggest](https://github.com/estin/geosuggest) crate.\n* guaranteed non-UTF8 input detection with the `validate` and `input` commands. Quicksilver [_REQUIRES_ UTF-8 encoded input](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/tree/master#utf-8-encoding). You can now use these commands to ensure you have valid UTF-8 input before using the rest of the toolkit.\n* New/expanded whirlwind tour & quick-start notebooks by @a5dur and @rzmk 🎠\n* Various performance improvements all-around: 🏇🏽\n  * overall increase of ~5% now that `mimalloc` - the default allocator for qsv, is built without secure mode unnecessarily enabled.\n  * `flatten` command is now ~10% faster\n  * faster regex performance thanks to various under-the-hood improvements in the [`regex`](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#195-2023-09-02) crate\n  * and the benchmark scripts have been updated by @minhajuddin2510 to use [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine#hyperfine) instead of time, and to use the same input file for all benchmarks to make them more reproducible. In upcoming releases, we'll start compiling the benchmark results into a single page as part of the release process, so we can track our progress over time.\n\nand last but not least - Quicksilver now has a website! - https://qsv.dathere.com/ :unicorn: :tada: :rocket:\n\nAnd its not just a static site with a few links - its a full-blown web app that lets you try out qsv commands in your browser!  It's not just a demo site - you can use it as a configurator and save your commands to a gist and share them with others!\n\nIt's the first Beta release of the Quicksilver website, so there's still a lot of work to do, but we're excited to share it with you and get your [feedback](https://dathere.com/qsv-feedback-form/)!\n\nWe have more exciting features planned for Quicksilver and the website, but we require your help to make it happen! For qsv, use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/issues). For the website, use the [feedback form](https://dathere.com/qsv-feedback-form/).  And if you want to help out, please check out the [contributing guide](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\nBig thanks to @rzmk for all the work on the website! To @a5dur for all the QA work on this release! And to @minhajuddin2510 for revamping the benchmark script!\n\n---\n\n### Added\n* `geocode`: new high-speed geocoding command  https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1231\n  * major improvements

[0.112.0] - 2023-08-15 🏇🏽🎠\nThis is the second in a series of \"[Giddy-up](https://7esl.com/giddy-up/)\" 🏇🏽 releases, improving the performance of the following commands:\n\n* `stats`: by refactoring the code to detect empty cells more efficiently, and by removing\nunnecessary bounds checks in the main compute loop.

This was made possible by the solid foundation of Rust and the [xsv](https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv) project from which qsv was forked.  We will continue to build on this foundation by adding more CI tests and starting to track code coverage so we can continue to iterate aggressively with confidence.\n\nApart from \"giddy-up\" releases, Quicksilver will also have \"carousel\" 🎠 releases that will focus on making the toolkit more accessible to non-technical users.\n\n\"Carousel\" 🎠 releases will include:\n* more documentation\n* more examples\n* more tutorials\n* more recipes in the Cookbook\n* multiple GUI wrappers around the CLI\n* integrations with common desktop tools like Excel, Google Sheets, Open Office, etc.\n\nHopefully, this will make qsv more accessible to non-technical users, and help them get more value out of their data.\n\nEvery now and then, we'll also have \"Unicorn\" 🦄 releases that will add MAJOR new features to the toolkit (e.g. 10x type features like the integration of [Pola.rs](https://pola.rs) into qsv).\n\nWe will also add a new Technical Documentation section to the [wiki](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/wiki) to document qsv's architecture and how each command works.  The hope is doing so will [lower the barrier to contributions](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and help us grow the community of qsv contributors.\n\n### Added\n* `sort`: add --faster option https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1190\n* `describegpt`: add -Q, --quiet option by @rzmk in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1179\n\n### Changed\n* `stats`: refactor init_date_inference https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1187\n* `join`: cache has_headers result in hot loop https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/e53edafdc91493c61e9889c8004177f147483a45\n* `search` &  `searchset`: amortize allocs https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1188\n* `stats`: use `fast-float` to convert string to float https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1191\n* `sqlp`: more examples, apply clippy::needless_borrow lint https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/ff37a041da246101db03c51d22b498127a5d7ba7 and https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/b8e1f7784cc6906745cdd43b61194e897a3666c4\n* use `fast-float` project-wide (`apply`, `applydp`, `schema`, `sort`, `validate`) https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1192\n* fine tune publishing workflows to enable universally available CPU features https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/a1dccc74b480477acaa17e21dde706c159c56b48\n* build(deps): bump serde from 1.0.179 to 1.0.180 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1176\n* build(deps): bump pyo3 from 0.19.1 to 0.19.2 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1177\n* build(deps): bump qsv-dateparser from 0.9.0 to 0.10.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1178\n* build(deps): bump qsv-sniffer from 0.9.4 to 0.10.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1180\n* build(deps): bump indicatif from 0.17.5 to 0.17.6 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1182\n* Bump to qsv stats 0.11  https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1184\n* build(deps): bump serde from 1.0.180 to 1.0.181 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1185\n* build(deps): bump qsv_docopt from 1.3.0 to 1.4.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1186\n* build(deps): bump filetime from 0.2.21 to 0.2.22 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1193\n* build(deps): bump regex from 1.9.1 to 1.9.2 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1194\n* build(deps): bump regex from 1.9.2 to 1.9.3 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1195\n* build(deps): bump serde from 1.0.181 to 1.0.182 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1196\n* build(deps): bump tempfile from 3.7.0 to 3.7.1 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1199\n* build(deps): bump strum_macros from 0.25.1 to 0.25.2 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1200\n* build(deps): bump serde from 1.0.182 to 1.0.183 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1201\n* cargo update bump several indirect dependencies\n* apply select clippy lint suggestions\n* pin Rust nightly to 2023-08-07\n\n### Removed\n* temporarily remove rand/simd_support feature when building nightly as its causing the nightly build to fail https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/0a66fdb454941052857f6458df38abe7730e0b4b\n\n### Fixed\n* fixed typos from documentation by @a5dur in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1203\n\n## New Contributors\n* @a5dur made their first contribution in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1203\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/compare/0.110.0...0.111.0\n\n## [0.110.0] -

We created this command primarily for [CKAN](https://ckan.org) and [Datapusher+](https://github.com/dathere/datapusher-plus#datapusher) so we can infer descriptions, tags and to automatically created annotated data dictionaries using the CSV's summary statistics and frequency tables. In that way, it works even for very large CSV files without consuming too many Open AI tokens.\nThis is a very powerful feature and we are looking forward to seeing what people do with it. Thanks @rzmk for all the work on this!\n\nThis release also features major improvements in the `sqlp` and `joinp` commands thanks to all the new capabilities of [Polars 0.31.1](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/releases/tag/rs-0.31.1). \n\nPolars SQL's capabilities have been vastly improved in 0.31.1 with numerous new SQL functions and operators, and they're all available using the `sqlp` command.\n\nThe `joinp` command has several new options for CSV parsing, for pre-join filtering (`--filter-left` and `--filter-right`), and pre-join validation with the `--validate` option. Two new asof join variants (`--left_by` and `right_by`) were also added.\n\n### Added\n* `describegpt` command by @rzmk in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1036\n* `describegpt`: minor refactoring in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1104\n* `describegpt`: `--key` & QSV_OPENAI_API_KEY by @rzmk in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1105\n* `describegpt`: add `--user-agent` in help message by @rzmk in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1095\n* `describegpt`: json output format for redirection by @rzmk in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1107\n* `describegpt`: add testing (resolves #1114) by @rzmk in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1115\n* `describegpt`: add `--model` option (resolves #1101) by @rzmk in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1117\n* `describegpt`: polishing https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1122\n* `describegpt`: add `--jsonl` option (resolves #1086) by @rzmk in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1127\n* `describegpt`: add `--prompt-file` option (resolves #1085) by @rzmk in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1120\n* `joinp`: added  `asof_by` join variant;

These builds are created using native Apple Silicon self-hosted Action Runners, which means we can enable all qsv features without being constrained by cross-compilation limitations and GitHub’s Action Runner’s disk/memory constraints. Additionally, we compile Apple Silicon builds with M1/M2 chip optimizations enabled to maximize performance.\n\nFinally, qsv startup should be noticeably faster, thanks to @vi’s [PR to avoid sysinfo::System::new_all](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1064).\n\n### Added\n* `joinp`: added asof join & --try-parsedates option https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1059\n* `cat`: emulate csvkit's csvstack https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1067\n* `input`: SIMD-accelerated utf8 validation https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/88e1df2757b4a9a6f9dbaf55a99b87fc15b18a65\n* `sniff`: replace magic with file-format crate, enabling mime-type detection on all platforms https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1069\n* `sqlp`: add --low-memory option https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/d95048e7be1a9d34cc7a22feebbd792a5c27c604\n* `sqlp`: added parquet format options https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/c179cf49e02343138b058d02783332394029a050 https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/a861ebf246d22db0f4bcbce1b76788413cfdd1e7\n* `flatten`: add --field-separator option https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1068\n* Apple Silicon binaries built on native Apple Silicon self-hosted Action Runners, enabling all features and optimized for M1/M2 chips\n\n### Changed\n* `input`: minor improvements https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/62cff74b4679e2ba207916392cab5de573ce0a59\n* `joinp`: align option names with `join` command https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1058\n* `sqlp`: minor improvements\n* changed all GitHub action workflows to account for the new Apple Silicon builds\n* Bump rust_decimal from 1.29.1 to 1.30.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1049\n* Bump serde_json from 1.0.96 to 1.0.97 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1051\n* Bump calamine from 0.21.0 to 0.21.1 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1052\n* Bump strum from 0.24.1 to 0.25.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1055\n* Bump actix-governor from 0.4.0 to 0.4.1 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1060\n* Bump csvs_convert from 0.8.5 to 0.8.6 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1061\n* Bump itertools from 0.10.5 to 0.11.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1062\n* Bump serde_json from 1.0.97 to 1.0.99 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1065\n* Bump indexmap from 1.9.3 to 2.0.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1066\n* Bump calamine from 0.21.1 to 0.21.2 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1071\n* cargo update bump various indirect dependencies\n* pin Rust nightly to 2021-06-23\n\n### Fixed\n* Avoid sysinfo::System::new_all by @vi in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1064\n* correct typos project-wide https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1072\n\n### Removed\n* removed libmagic dependency from all GitHub action workflows\n\n## New Contributors\n* @vi made their first contribution in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1064\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/compare/0.107.0...0.108.0\n\n## [0.107.0] - 2023-06-14\nWe continue to improve the new [`sqlp`](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/blob/master/src/cmd/sqlp.rs#L2) command. It now supports scripts, Polars CSV parsing and CSV format options. We also added a new special value for the `rename` command which allows you to rename all columns in a CSV. This was done to make it easier to prepare CSVs with no headers for use with `sqlp`.\n\nThis release also features a Windows MSI installer. This is a big step forward for qsv and we hope to make it easier for Windows users to install and use qsv. Thanks @minhajuddin2510 for all the work on pulling this together!\n\n### Added\n* `sqlp`: added script support https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1037\n* `sqlp`: added CSV format options https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1048\n* `rename`: add `\"_all generic\"` special value for headers https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1031\n\n### Changed\n* `excel`: now supports Duration type with calamine upgrade to 0.21.0 https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1045\n* Update publish-wix-installer.yml by @minhajuddin2510 in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1032\n* Bump mlua from 0.9.0-beta.2 to 0.9.0-beta.3 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1030\n* Bump serde from 1.0.163 to 1.0.164 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1029\n* Bump csvs_convert from 0.8.4 to 0.8.5 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1028\n* Bump sysinfo from 0.29.1 to 0.29.2 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1027\n* Bump log from 0.4.18 to 0.4.19 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1039\n* Bump uuid from 1.3.3 to 1.3.4 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1041\n* Bump jql-runner from 6.0.8 to 6.0.9 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1043\n* cargo update bump several indirect dependencies\n* pin Rust nightly to 2021-06-13\n\n### Fixed\n* Remove redundant registries protocol by @icp1994 in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1034\n* fix typo in tojsonl.rs (optionns -> options) by @rzmk in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1035\n* Fix eula by @minhajuddin2510 in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1046\n\n## New Contributors\n* @icp1994 made their first contribution in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1034\n* @rzmk made their first contribution in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/1035\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/compare/0.106.0...0.107.0\n\n## [0.106.0] - 2023-06-07\nThis release features the new [Polars](https://www.pola.rs/)-powered `sqlp` command which allows you to run SQL queries against CSVs.\n\nInitial tests show that its competitive with [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) and faster than [DataFusion](https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/) on identical SQL queries, and it just runs rings around [pandasql](https://github.com/yhat/pandasql/#pandasql).\n\nIt converts Polars SQL (a subset of ANSI SQL) queries to multithreaded LazyFrames expressions and then executes them. This is a very powerful feature and allows you to do things like joins, aggregations, group bys, etc. on larger than memory CSVs. The `sqlp` command is still experimental and we are looking for feedback on it.

Disabled magic when cross-compiling for non-x86_64 Linux targets.\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/compare/0.102.0...0.102.1\n\n## [0.102.0] - 2023-05-08\nA lot of work was done on `sniff` to make it not just a CSV dialect detector, but a general purpose file type detector leveraging :magic_wand: [magic](https://www.darwinsys.com/file/) :sparkles: - able to detect mime types even for files on URLs.  \n\n`sniff` can now also use the same data types as `stats` with the `--stats-types` option. This was primarily done to support metadata collection when registering CKAN resources not only during data entry, but also when checking resource links for bitrot, and when harvesting metadata from other systems, so `stats` & `sniff` can be used interchangeably based on the response time requirement and the data quality of the data source.\n\nFor example, `sniff` can be used for quickly inferring metadata by just downloading a small sample from a very large data file DURING data entry ([\"Resource-first upload workflow\"](https://github.com/dathere/datapusher-plus/blob/master/docs/RESOURCE_FIRST_WORKFLOW.md#Resource-first-Upload-Workflow)), with `stats` being used later on, when the data is actually being pushed to the Datastore with [Datapusher+](https://github.com/dathere/datapusher-plus#datapusher), when data type inferences need to be guaranteed, and the entire file will need to be scanned.\n\n### Added\n* `stats`: add `--infer-boolean` option https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/967\n* `sniff`: add `--stats-types` option https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/968\n* `sniff`: add magic mime-type detection on Linux https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/970\n* `sniff`: add `--user-agent` option https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/bd0bf788609c7dd5220cdab6061067170acf1ca2\n* `sniff`: add last_modified info https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/ef68bff177ee7c9ce6bd45868488287c8114a91e\n\n### Changed\n* make `--envlist` option allocator-aware https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/f3566dc0c4ab7c7236374cce936f5db7200e39de\n* Bump serde from 1.0.160 to 1.0.162 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/962\n* Bump robinraju/release-downloader from 1.7 to 1.8 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/960\n* Bump flexi_logger from 0.25.3 to 0.25.4 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/965\n* Bump sysinfo from 0.28.4 to 0.29.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/966\n* Bump jql-runner from 6.0.6 to 6.0.7 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/969\n* Bump polars from 0.28.0 to 0.29.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/971\n* apply select clippy recommendations\n* cargo update bump indirect dependencies\n* change MSRV to 1.69.0\n* pin Rust nightly to 2023-05-07\n\n### Fixed\n* `sniff`: make sniff give more consistent results https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/958.

It was increasing code complexity and not very reliable. https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/782\n\n### Fixed\n* `dedup`: refactored to use iterators to avoid out of bounds errors. https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/f5e547b68410407851f217c706ad303bdbc5a583\n* `exclude`: don't screen for utf8. This bugfix spurred the utf8 validation revamp, where I realized, I just needed to pull out utf8 screening https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/781\n* `py`:  `col`, not `row` https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/793\n\n## New Contributors\n* @tmtmtmtm made their first contribution in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/783\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/compare/0.88.2...0.89.0\n\n## [0.88.2] - 2023-02-16\n\n### Changed\n* also show `--update` and `--updatenow` errors on stderr https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/770\n* `sortcheck`: when a file is not sorted, dupecount is invalid. Set dupecount to -1 to make it plainly evident when file is not sorted. https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/771\n* `excel`: added `--quiet` option https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/99d88499df573f9f46992346f394d9372ceeffcc\n* `extdedup`: minimize allocations in hot loop https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/62096fa84505b6de2c108d1f07707008e1c2d170\n* improved mem_file_check OOM-prevention helper function. Better error messages; clamp free memory headroom percentage between 10 and 90 percent https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/6701ebfae58e942117378996ec6679544f620cbf and https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/5cd8a95e7b36819f75f0d3bb8172dcff601b649b\n* improved utf8 check error messages to give more detail, and not just say there is an encoding error https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/c9b5b075d31b9639958193db919683475c3e3ba5\n* improved README, adding Regular Expression Syntax section; reordered sections\n* modified CI workflows to also check qsvlite\n* Bump once_cell from 1.17.0 to 1.17.1 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/775\n* cargo update bump several indirect dependencies\n* pin Rust nightly to 2023-02-14\n\n### Fixed\n* `dedup` unnecessarily doing utf8 check; improve `input` usage text https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/773\n* `dedup`: fix unstable dedup results caused by using `par_sort_unstable_by` https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/776\n* `sort`: fix unstable sort results caused by using `par_sort_unstable_by` https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/9f01df41a77dece75e434ee24b3ea0178d58deaf\n* removed mispublished 0.88.1 release\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/compare/0.88.0...088.2\n\n## [0.88.0] - 2023-02-13\n\n### Added\n* `extdedup`: new command to deduplicate arbitrarily large CSV/text files using a memory-buffered, on-disk hash table. Not only does it dedup very large files using constant memory, it does so while retaining the file's original sort order, unlike `dedup` which loads the entire file into memory to sort it first before deduping by comparing neighboring rows https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/762\n* Added Out-of-Memory (OOM) handling for \"non-streaming\" commands (i.e. commands that load the entire file into memory) using a heuristic that if an input file's size is lower than the free memory available minus a default headroom of 20 percent, qsv processing stops gracefully with a detailed message about the potential OOM condition. This headroom can be adjusted using the `QSV_FREEMEMORY_HEADROOM_PCT` environment variable, which has a minimum value of 10 percent https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/767\n* add `-Q, --quiet` option to all commands that return counts to stderr (`dedup`, `extdedup`, `search`, `searchset` and `replace`) in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/768\n\n### Changed\n* `sort` & `sortcheck`: separate test suites and link from usage text https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/756\n* `frequency`: amortize allocations, preallocate with_capacity. Informal benchmarking shows an improvement of ~30%! :rocket: https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/761\n* `extsort`: refactor. Aligned options with `extdedup`; now also support stdin/stdout; added `--memory-limit` option  https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/763\n* `safenames`: minor optimization https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/a7df378e0a755300e541dec0fef0b12d39b215f2\n* `excel`: minor optimization https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/75eac7875e276b45e668cbe91271ad86cec8db49\n* `stats`: add date inferencing false positive warning, with a recommendation how to prevent false positives https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/a84a4e614b5c14dd2e0d523bec4c6d9dbeb7c3ba\n* `sortcheck`: added note to usage text that dupe_count is only valid if file is sorted https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/ab69f144fa2ac375255bf9fbd6dd08bf538c1dfa\n* reorganized Installation section to differentiate different options https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/9ef8bfc0b90574b41629c7c7bd463289dc1dcb62\n* bump MSRV to 1.67.1\n* applied select clippy recommendations\n* Bump flexi_logger from 0.25.0 to 0.25.1 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/755\n* Bump pyo3 from 0.18.0 to 0.18.1 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/757\n* Bump serde_json from 1.0.92 to 1.0.93 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/760\n* Bump filetime from 0.2.19 to 0.2.20 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/759\n* Bump self_update from 0.34.0 to 0.35.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/765\n* cargo update bump several indirect dependencies\n* pin Rust nightly to 2023-02-12\n\n### Fixed\n* `sortcheck`: correct wrong progress message showing invalid dupe_count (as dupe count is only valid if the file is sorted) https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/8eaa8240249c5c7eb1ece068764a8caa7e804414\n* `py` & `luau`: correct usage text about stderr https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/1b56e72988e2dee1502517f8e2dbf036416efb8d\n\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/compare/0.87.1...0.88.0\n\n## [0.87.1] - 2023-02-02\n\n### Changed\n* `safenames`: refactor in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/754\n   - better handling of headers that start with a digit, instead of replacing the digit with a _, prepend the unsafe prefix\n   - quoted identifiers are also considered unsafe, unless conditional mode is used\n   - verbose modes now also return a list of duplicate header names\n* update MSRV to 1.67.0\n* cargo update bump dependencies\n* disable optimization on test profile for faster CI compilation, which was taking much longer than test run time\n* optimize prebuilt nightlies to compile with target-cpu=native\n* pin Rust nightly to 2023-02-01\n\n### Fixed\n^ `safenames`: fixed mode behavior inconsistencies https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/754\nall modes now use the same safenames algorithm. Before, the verbose modes used a simpler one leading to inconsistencies between modes (resolves safenames handling inconsistent between modes #753)\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/compare/0.87.0...0.88.0\n\n## [0.87.0] - 2023-01-29\n\n### Added\n* `apply`: add decimal separator --replacement option to thousands operation. This fully rounds out `thousands` formatting, as it will allow formatting numbers to support \"euro-style\" formats (e.g. 1.234.567,89 instead of 1,234,567.89) https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/749\n* `apply`: add round operation; also refactored thousands operation to use more appropriate `--formatstr` option instead of `--comparand` option to specify \"format\" of thousands separator policy https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/751\n* `applydp`: add round operation  https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/752\n\n### Changed\n* changed MSRV policy to track latest Rust version in Homebrew, instead of latest Rust stable\n* removed excess trailing whitespace in `apply` & `applydp` usage text\n* moved `round_num` function from `stats.rs` to `util.rs` so it can be used in round operation in `apply` and `applydp`\n* cargo update bump dependencies, notably tokio from 1.24.2 to 1.25.0\n* pin Rust nightly to 2023-01-28\n\n### Fixed\n* `apply`: corrected thousands operation usage text - `hexfour` not `hex_four` https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/6545aa2b3ce470b5f6c039c998e9f6fc21a6ad84\n\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/compare/0.86.0...0.87.0\n\n\n## [0.86.0] - 2023-01-29\n\n### Added\n* `apply`: added `thousands` operation which adds thousands separators to numeric values.\nSpecify the separator policy with --comparand (default: comma). The valid policies are:\ncomma, dot, space, underscore, hexfour (place a space every four hex digits) and\nindiancomma (place a comma every two digits, except the last three digits). https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/748\n* `searchset`: added `--unmatched-output` option. This was done to allow Datapusher+ to screen for PIIs more efficiently. Writing PII candidate records in one CSV file, and the \"clean\" records in another CSV in just one pass.  https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/742\n\n\n### Changed\n* `fetch` & `fetchpost`: expanded usage text info on HTTP2 Adaptive Flow Control support\n* `fetchpost`: added more detail about `--compress` option\n* `stats`: added more tests\n* updated prebuilt zip archive READMEs https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/072973efd7947a93773b2783d098eeace17d963d\n* Bump redis from 0.22.2 to 0.22.3 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/741\n* Bump ahash from 0.8.2 to 0.8.3 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/743\n* Bump jql from 5.1.4 to 5.1.6 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/747\n* applied select clippy recommendations\n* cargo update bump several indirect dependencies\n* pin Rust nightly to 2023-01-27\n\n\n### Fixed\n* `stats`: fixed antimodes null display. Use the literal `NULL` instead of just \"\" when listing NULL as an antimode. https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/745\n* `tojsonl`: fixed invalid escaping of JSON values https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/746\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/compare/0.85.0...0.86.0\n\n## [0.85.0] - 2023-01-22\n\n### Added\n* Update csvs_convert by @kindly in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/736\n* `sniff`: added `--delimiter` option https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/732\n* `fetchpost`: add `--compress` option in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/737\n* `searchset`: several tweaks for PII screening requirement of Datapusher+. `--flag` option now shows regex labels instead of just row number; new `--flag-matches-only` option sends only matching rows to output when used with `--flag`; `--json` option returns rows_with_matches, total_matches and rowcount as json to stderr. https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/738\n\n### Changed\n* `luau`: minor tweaks to increase code readability https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/31d01c8b9eb1fe85262e9bf5fd237ae4493d562c\n* `stats`: now normalize after rounding. Normalizing strips trailing zeroes and converts -0.0 to 0.0. https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/f838272b4deb79d25ca5704cf3c89652c0b9a3bb\n* `safenames`: mention CKAN-specific options https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/f371ac25ba0c27e48b7b9b14a37dc47913cf0095\n* `fetch` & `fetchpost`: document decompression priority https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/43ce13c4bf7eb23dc5d051d522d6d52d3cc255aa\n* Bump actix-governor from 0.3.2 to 0.4.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/728\n* Bump sysinfo from 0.27.6 to 0.27.7 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/730\n* Bump serial_test from 0.10.0 to 1.0.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/729\n* Bump pyo3 from 0.17.3 to 0.18.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/731\n* Bump reqwest from 0.11.13 to 0.11.14 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/734\n* cargo update bump for other dependencies\n* pin Rust nightly to 2023-01-21\n\n### Fixed\n* `sniff`: now checks that `--sample` size is greater than zero https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/cd4c390ce4322d7076866be27025d67800bc60e2\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/compare/0.84.0...0.85.0\n\n## [0.84.0] - 2023-01-14\n\n### Added\n* `headers`: added `--trim` option to trim quote and spaces from headers https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/726\n\n\n### Changed\n* `input`: `--trim-headers` option also removes excess quotes https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/727\n* `safenames`: trim quotes and spaces from headers https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/0260833bc8b36ea6e6ccb9e79687c76470a8a6b0\n* cargo update bump dependencies\n* pin Rust nightly to 2022-01-13\n\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/compare/0.83.0...0.84.0\n\n## [0.83.0] - 2023-01-13\n\n### Added\n* `stats`: add sparsity to \"streaming\" statistics https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/719\n* `schema`: also infer enum constraints for integer fields. Not only good for validation, this is also required by `tojsonl` for smarter boolean inferencing https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/721\n\n### Changed\n* `stats`: change `--typesonly` so it will not automatically `--infer-dates`. Let the user decide. https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/718\n* `stats`: if median is already known, use it to calculate Median Absolute Deviation https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/08ed08da4651a96bf05372b34b670063fbcec14f\n* `tojsonl`: smarter boolean inferencing. It will infer a column as boolean if it only has a domain of two values,\nand the first character of the values are one of the following case-insensitive \"truthy/falsy\"\ncombinations: t/f; t/null; 1/0; 1/null; y/n & y/null are treated as true/false. https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/722 and https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/723\n* `safenames`: process `--reserved` option before `--prefix` option. https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/b333549199726a3e92b95fb1d501fbdbbeede34a\n* `strum` and `strum-macros` are no longer optional dependencies as we use it with all the binary variants now https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/bea6e00fc400e8fafa2938832f8654d97c45fe34\n* Bump qsv-stats from 0.6.0 to 0.7.0\n* Bump sysinfo from 0.27.3 to 0.27.6\n* Bump hashbrown from 0.13.1 to 0.13.2 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/720\n* Bump actions/setup-python from 4.4.0 to 4.5.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/724\n* change MSRV from 1.66.0 to 1.66.1\n\n* cargo update bump indirect dependencies\n* pin Rust nightly to 2023-01-12\n\n### Fixed\n* `safenames`: fixed `--prefix` option. When checking for invalid underscore prefix, it was checking for hyphen, not underscore, causing a problem with Datapusher+ https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/4fbbfd3a479b6678fa9d4c823fd00b592b326c7a\n\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/compare/0.82.0...0.83.0\n\n\n## [0.82.0] - 2023-01-09\n\n### Added\n* `diff`: Find the difference between two CSVs ludicrously fast! by @janriemer in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/711\n* `stats`: added [Median Absolute Deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_absolute_deviation) (MAD) https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/715\n* added Testing section to README https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/517d69b496aaa9535a2b23b05e44a5999d8ef994\n\n### Changed\n* `validate`: schema less validation error improvements https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/703\n* `stats`: faster date inferencing https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/706\n* `stats`: minor performance tweaks https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/15e6284c20cccf4a6b74498336d31b0d7ba03285 https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/3f0ed2b314765a546e28b534d5e82bff892592c3\n* `stats`: refactored modes compilation https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/6e448b041a2c78b3ce1cc89aadaff4a8d1081472\n* `stats`: simplify if condition https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/ae7cc85afe1dc4c3f87cbefe3b14dc93b28d94e9\n* `luau`: show luau version when invoking --version https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/f7f9c4297fb3dea685b5d0f631932b6b2ca4a99a\n* `excel`: add \"sheet\" suffix to end msg for readability https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/ae3a8e31784a24c8492de76c5074e477cc474063\n* cache `util::count_rows` result, so if a CSV without an index is queried, it caches the result and future calls to count_rows in the same session will be instantaneous https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/e805dedf5674cfbc56d9948791419ac6fd51f2fd\n* Bump console from 0.15.3 to 0.15.4 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/704\n* Bump cached from 0.41.0 to 0.42.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/709\n* Bump mlua from 0.8.6 to 0.8.7 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/712\n* Bump qsv-stats from 0.5.2 to 0.6.0 with the new MAD statistic support\n* cargo update bump dependencies - notably mimalloc from 0.1.32 to 0.1.34, luau0-src from 0.4.1_luau553 to 0.5.0_luau555, csvs_convert from 0.7.9 to 0.7.11 and regex from 1.7.0 to 1.7.1\n* pin Rust nightly to 2023-01-08\n\n### Fixed\n* `tojsonl`: fix escaping of unicode string.

For prebuilt binaries, Python 3.10 is now required and the python 3.10 shared libraries are bundled for select platforms.\nIf you require an earlier version of Python (3.6 and up), you'll have to install/compile from source. https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/492\n* Smarter self update. --update can still be explicitly invoked even when self-update feature has been disabled. Further, if you compiled qsv from source,\nself-update will only notify you of new releases, instead of proceeding with self-update. https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/490 and https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/493\n* `lua`: switch from Lua 5.4 to LuaJIT 2.1, primarily for performance https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/495\n* `lua`: when filtering using floats, \"0.0\" is false\n* `join`: removed unneeded utf8 check\n* `search`: simplify regex_unicode check\n* `fetch` & `fetchpost`: optimize imports; remove unneeded utf8 check\n* Bump anyhow from 1.0.64 to 1.0.65 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/498\n* Bump self_update from 0.31.0 to 0.32.0 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/499\n* add additional copyright holder to MIT License\n* Improved publishing workflow for prebuilt binaries\n* cargo update bumped several dependencies\n* pin Rust nightly to 2022-09-14\n\n### Fixed\n* fix typos by @kianmeng in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/491\n* `python`: better error handling. When mapping/filtering, python expression errors no longer cause a panic, but instead fail to map/filter as expected (when mapping, \"\\<ERROR\\>\" is returned, when filtering, the filter is not applied), and continue processing. Also, other errors are properly propagated instead of panicking. https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/496\n* `lua`: better error handling. When mapping/filtering, Lua errors no longer cause a panic, but instead fail to map/filter as expected (when mapping, \"\\<ERROR\\>\" is returned, when filtering, the filter is not applied), and continue processing. https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/497\n\n## [0.67.0] - 2022-09-09\n### Added\n* added `self_update` feature, so users can build qsv without self-update engine https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/483 and https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/484\n\n### Changed\n* `search` & `searchset`: --quick option returns first match row to stderr https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/475\n* `python`: make --batch size configurable https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/485\n* `stats`: added more implementation comments; standardize string creation\n* `replace`: add conditional compilation to eliminate dead_code warning\n* `lua`: when filtering, non-zero integers are true\n* refactored `workdir.rs` test helpers\n* refactored `util:init_logger()` to log command-line arguments\n* Bump url from 2.3.0 to 2.3.1 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/489\n* Bump anyhow from 1.0.63 to 1.0.64 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/478\n* Bump sysinfo from 0.26.1 to 0.26.2 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/477\n* Bump robinraju/release-downloader from 1.4 to 1.5 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/481\n* cargo update bump indirect dependencies\n* pin Rust nightly to 2022-09-07\n\n## [0.66.0] - 2022-09-01\n\n### Added\n* `apply`: added Multi-column subcommands by @udsamani in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/462\n* `stats`:  added --round option https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/474\n* created `fail_format!` macro for more concise error handling in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/471\n\n### Changed\n* Move command usage text to beginning of cmd source code, so we don't need to move around deeplinks to usage texts from README https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/467\n* Optimize conditional compilation of various qsv binary variants, removing dead code https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/473\n* `fetch` & `fetchpost`: removed initial burst of requests, making the commands \"friendlier\" to rate-limited APIs\n* `search`, `searchset` & `replace`: minor performance optimizations\n* created dedicated rustfmt GitHub action workflow to ensure code is always rust formatted. Previously, rustfmt check was in Linux workflow.\n* applied some clippy recommendations\n* Bump actix-governor from 0.3.1 to 0.3.2 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/461\n* cargo update bumped several dependencies\n* pin Rust nightly to 2022-08-31\n* set RUSTFLAGS to emit=asm when compiling pre-built binaries for performance\n  see http://likebike.com/posts/How_To_Write_Fast_Rust_Code.html#emit-asm\n\n### Fixed\n* `extsort` code was being compiled for qsvdp even if it was not enabled\n* bump sysinfo from 0.25.2 to 0.26.0, fixing segfault on Apple Silicon\n* fixed qsvnp on Windows so it doesn't look for python shared libraries even if python is not enabled\n* fixed CliError::Other so it returns bad exitcode (exitcode 1) instead of incorrect_usage (exit code 2)\n\n## New Contributors\n* @udsamani made their first contribution in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/462\n\n## [0.65.0] - 2022-08-28\n\n### Added\n* Major refactoring of main variants - removing redundant code and moving them to a new module - clitypes.rs. Added custom exit codes. \n  Removed need to have --exitcode option in several commands as qsv now returns exit codes for ALL commands in a standard way. https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/460\n* Major refactoring of CI test helpers in workdir.rs\n\n### Changed\n* `py`: use python interning to amortize allocs https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/457\n* `search` & `searchset`: return num of matches to stderr; add --quick option; remove --exitcode option https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/458\n* `extsort`: improved error handling\n* `fetch` & `fetchpost`: better --report option handling https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/451\n* `lua`: faster number to string conversion using itoa and ryu\n* `replace`: removed --exitcode option\n* `sortcheck`: --json options now always cause full scan of CSV\n* `stats`: expanded usage text, explicitly listing stats that require loading the entire CSV into memory. Mentioned data type inferences are guaranteed.\n* cargo update bumped several dependencies\n* pin Rust nightly to 2022-08-27\n\n### Fixed\n* `py`: batched python processing refactor. Instead of using one GILpool for one session, `py` now processes in batches of 30,000 rows, releasing memory after each batch.

This prevented publishing of qsv 0.58.1 to crates.io.\n\n## [0.58.1] - 2022-07-02\n### Changed\n* Universal clippy handling. Added allow clippy hint section in main for clippy lints we allow/ignore, and added exceptions as needed throughout the codebase.\nThis means clippy, even in pedantic/nursery/perf mode will have no warnings. https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/365\n* reqwest deflate compression support https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/366\n* `fetch`: expanded --http-header explanation/example\n* `fetch`: refactored --timeout processing https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/3454ed068f0f243473a0f66520f90f55ece4bf49\n* `fetch`: prioritized ACCEPT-ENCODING to prioritize brotli first, gzip second, and deflate last for compression https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/c540d22b630df424a8516bb07af9bbf80150d67b\n* updated patched crates, particularly our rust-csv fork with more clippy recommendations applied\n* cargo update bump actix-http from 3.2.0 to 3.2.1\n\n### Fixed\n* `excel`: fixed docopt usage text which prevents --help from working\n* `extsort`: better parsing/error-handling, instead of generic panic when no input/output is specified. This also allows --help to be displayed.\n\n## [0.58.0] - 2022-07-02\n### Added\n* `excel`: add --list-sheets option https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/364\n* `fetch`: added 0 option to --rate-limit to go as fast as possible.  \n**CAUTION:** Only use this with APIs that have [RateLimit](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-polli-ratelimit-headers-00.html) headers so qsv can automatically down-throttle as required. Otherwise, the fetch job will look like a Denial-of-Service attack. https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/e4ece60aea3720b872119ca7a8ad3666dad033e7\n* `fetch`: added --max-errors option. Maximum number of errors before aborting\n\n### Changed\n* progress bars now display per_sec throughput while running jobs, not just at the end of a job\n* `fetch`: for long-running fetch jobs, the progress bar will update at least every three seconds, so it doesn't look like the job is frozen/stuck.\n* `fetch`: added additional verbiage to usage text on how to pass multiple key-value pairs to the HTTP header\n* `fetch`: made RateLimit jitters (required to avoid [thundering herd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundering_herd_problem) issues as per the [RateLimit spec](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-polli-ratelimit-headers-00.html#resource-exhaustion-and-clock-skew)) shorter, as they were too long.\n* pin Rust nightly to 2022-07-01\n* applied various clippy recommendations\n* bumped serde from 1.0.137 to 1.0.138\n* added stale warning to benchmarks. The benchmarks have not been updated since qsv 0.20.0.\n* cargo update bumped several other dependencies\n\n### Fixed\n* remove unneeded sleep pause before fetch ratelimit test\n\n## [0.57.1] - 2022-06-31\n### Changed\n* `fetch`: higher default settings which makes fetch much faster\n\n## [0.57.0] - 2022-06-30\n### Added\n* `excel`: date support https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/357\n* added hardware survey reminiscent of [Steam's Hardware Survey](https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey). Only sent when checking for updates with no personally identifiable information. https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/358\n* `fetch`: ensure URLs are properly encoded https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/359\n\n### Changed\n* Bump jql from 4.0.4 to 4.0.5 by @dependabot in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/356\n* cargo bump update several dependencies\n* change MSRV to Rust 1.62.0\n* pin Rust Nightly to 2022-06-29\n\n### Fixed\n* `fetch`: is single-threaded again.

Otherwise, `--update` unzipping doesn't work.\n## [0.26.0] - 2021-12-21\n### Changed\n* `fetch` refinements. Still WIP, but usable (See [#77](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/issues/77))\n  - add default user agent\n  - `fetch` progress bar\n  - `--jobs`, `--throttle`, `--header`, `--store-error` and `cookies` options still not functional.\n* cargo update bump several crates to their latest releases. Of note are `test-data-generation`, \n`self_update` and `jql` where we worked with the crate maintainers directly with the update.\n\n### Fixed\n* `--update` bug fixed. It was not finding the binary to self update properly.\n\n\n## [0.25.2-beta] - 2021-12-13\n## Added\n* `fetch` command by [@mhuang74](https://github.com/mhuang74). Note that the command is functional but still WIP, that's why this is a beta release.\n* Download badge for GitHub pre-built binaries\n* Compute hashes for pre-built binaries for verification\n\n## Changed\n* Additional helptext for `apply` NLP functions\n* standardized on canonical way to suppress progress bars with `--quiet` option\n* README: Mentioned `--frozen` option when installing/building qsv; wordsmithing\n* rustfmt; clippy\n\n## Deleted\n* remove obsolete Makefile and .gitsubmodules\n## [0.24.1] - 2021-12-06\n### Changed\n- changed selfupdate dependency to use pure Rust TLS implementation as cross no longer bundles OpenSSL, causing some binary builds using cross to fail.\n## [0.24.0] - 2021-12-06\n### Added\n* Add logging by @mhuang74 in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/116\n* Environment variables for logging - `QSV_LOG_LEVEL` and `QSV_LOG_DIR` - see [Logging](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/blob/master/docs/Logging.md#logging) for more details.\n* `sentiment` analysis `apply` operation  https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/121\n* `whatlang` language detection `apply` operation  https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/122\n* aarch64-apple-darwin prebuilt binary (Apple Silicon AKA M1)\n* `--envlist` convenience option to list all environment variables with the `QSV_` prefix\n\n### Changed\n* changed `MAX_JOBS` heuristic logical processor divisor from 4 to 3\n* `selfupdate` is no longer an optional feature\n\n## New Contributors\n* @mhuang74 made their first contribution in https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/pull/116\n## [0.23.0] - 2021-11-29\n### Added\n- added `--update` option. This allows qsv to check and update itself if there are new release binaries published on GitHub.\n- added `--envlist` option to show all environment variables with the `QSV_` prefix.\n- `apply`, `generate`, `lua`, `foreach` and `selfupdate` are now optional features. `apply` and `generate` are marked optional since they have\nlarge dependency trees; `lua` and `foreach` are very powerful commands that can be abused to issue system commands. Users now have the option exclude these features from their local builds.  Published binaries on GitHub still have `-all-features` enabled.\n- added `QSV_COMMENTS` environment variable (contributed by [@jbertovic](https://github.com/jbertovic)). This allows qsv to ignore lines in the CSV (including headers) that start with the set character. [EXAMPLES](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/blob/feae8cf5750530318b83c4b3c7bf0f72d2332079/tests/test_comments.rs#L3)\n- catch input empty condition when qsv's input is empty when using `select`.   \n(e.g. `cat /dev/null | qsv select 1` will now show the error \"Input is empty.\" instead of \"Selector index 1 is out of bounds. Index must be >= 1 and <= 0.\")\n- added `--pad <arg>` option to `split` command to zero-pad the generated filename by the number of `<arg>` places. [EXAMPLES](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/blob/feae8cf5750530318b83c4b3c7bf0f72d2332079/tests/test_split.rs#L81)\n- tests for `QSV_COMMENTS`, `split --pad`, `select` input empty condition, \n### Changed\n- set Cargo.toml to Rust 2021 edition\n- added \"command-line-utilities\" category to crates.io metadata\n- cargo update bumped `mimalloc`, `serde_json`, `syn`, `anyhow` and `ryu`.\n- GitHub Actions CI tests runs with `--all-features` enabled.\n- published binaries on GitHub have `--all-features` enabled by default.\n- made geocode caching a tad faster by making the transitional cache unbounded, and simplifying the key.\n- `--version` now also shows the number of logical CPUs detected.\n- project-wide rustfmt\n- documentation for features, `QSV_COMMENTS` and `apply`\n### Removed\n- removed greetings.yml workflow from GitHub Actions.\n\n## [0.22.1] - 2021-11-22\n### Added\n- added `lua` and `foreach` feature flags. These commands are very powerful and can be easily abused or get into \"foot-shooting\" scenarios.\nThey are now only enabled when these features are enabled during install/build.\n- `censor` and `censor_check` now support the addition of custom profanities to screen for with the --comparand option.\n### Changed\n- removed `lazy_static` and used `once_cell` instead\n- smaller stripped binaries for `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, `i686-unknown-linux-gnu`, `x86_64-apple-darwin` targets\n- expanded `apply` help text\n- added more tests (currencytonum, censor, censor_check)\n\n## [0.22.0] - 2021-11-15\n### Added\n- `generate` command. Generate test data by profiling a CSV using a [Markov decision process](https://docs.rs/test-data-generation).\n- add `--no-headers` option to `rename` command (see [discussion #81](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/discussions/81#discussioncomment-1599027))\n- Auto-publish binaries for more platforms on release\n- added combo-test for sort-dedup-sort (see [discussion #80](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/discussions/80#discussioncomment-1610190))\n- New environment variables galore\n  - `QSV_DEFAULT_DELIMITER` - single ascii character to use as delimiter.  Overrides `--delimiter` option. Defaults to \",\" (comma) for CSV files and \"\\t\" (tab) for TSV files, when not set. Note that this will also set the delimiter for qsv's output. Adapted from [xsv PR](https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv/pull/94) by [@camerondavison](https://github.com/camerondavison).\n  - `QSV_NO_HEADERS` - when set, the first row will **NOT** be interpreted as headers. Supersedes `QSV_TOGGLE_HEADERS`.\n  - `QSV_MAX_JOBS` - number of jobs to use for parallelized commands (currently `frequency`, `split` and `stats`). If not set, max_jobs is set\nto number of logical processors divided by four.  See [Parallelization](#parallelization) for more info.\n  - `QSV_REGEX_UNICODE` - if set, makes `search`, `searchset` and `replace` commands unicode-aware. For increased performance, these\ncommands are not unicode-aware and will ignore unicode values when matching and will panic when unicode characters are used in the regex.\n- Added parallelization heuristic (num_cpus/4), in connection with `QSV_MAX_JOBS`.\n- Added more tests\n  - `apply` (test for regex_replace, eudex, and lat/long parsing)\n  - combo-test (see above) - for testing qsv command combinations\n  - tests for `QSV_NO_HEADERS` environment variable\n  - tests for `QSV_REGEX_UNICODE` environment variable in `search`, `searchset` and `replace` commands\n  - tests for `QSV_DEFAULT_DELIMITER` environment variable\n### Changed\n- MSRV of Rust 1.56\n- expanded `apply` help-text examples\n- progress bar now only updates every 1% progress by default\n- replaced English-specific soundex with multi-lingual eudex algorithm (see https://docs.rs/crate/eudex/0.1.1)\n- refactored `apply geocode` subcommand to improve cache performance\n- improved lat/long parsing - can now recognize embedded coordinates in text\n- changed `apply operations regex_replace` behavior to do all matches in a field, instead of just the left-most one, to be consistent with the behavior of `apply operations replace`\n\n## [0.21.0] - 2021-11-07\n### Added\n- added `apply geocode` caching, more than doubling performance in the geocode benchmark.\n- added `--random` and `--seed` options to `sort` command from [@pjsier](https://github.com/pjsier).\n- added qsv tab completion section to README.\n- additional `apply operations` subcommands:\n  * Match Trim operations - enables trimming of more than just whitespace, but also of multiple trim characters in one pass ([Example](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/blob/9569dd7c2a897e0a47b97e1abfd1c3efab920990/tests/test_apply.rs#L214)):\n    * mtrim: Trims `--comparand` matches left & right of the string ([trim_matches](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html#method.trim_matches) wrapper)\n    * mltrim: Left trim `--comparand` matches ([trim_start_matches](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html#method.trim_start_matches) wrapper)\n    * mrtrim: Right trim `--comparand` matches ([trim_end_matches](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html#method.trim_end_matches) wrapper)\n  * replace: Replace all matches of a pattern (using `--comparand`)\n      with a string (using `--replacement`) (Std::String [replace](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html#method.replace) wrapper).\n  * regex_replace: Replace the leftmost-first regex match with `--replacement` (regex [replace](https://docs.rs/regex/1.1.0/regex/struct.Regex.html#method.replace) wrapper).\n  * titlecase - capitalizes English text using Daring Fireball titlecase style\n      https://daringfireball.net/2008/05/title_case\n  * censor_check: check if profanity is detected (boolean) [Examples](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/blob/9569dd7c2a897e0a47b97e1abfd1c3efab920990/tests/test_apply.rs#L66)\n  * censor: profanity filter\n- added parameter validation to `apply operations` subcommands\n- added more robust parameter validation to `apply` command by leveraging docopt\n- added more tests\n- added `rust-version` in Cargo.toml to specify MSRV of rust 1.56\n\n### Changed\n- revamped benchmark script:\n  * allow binary to be changed, so users can benchmark xsv and other xsv forks by simply replacing the $bin shell variable\n  * now uses a much larger data file - a 1M row, 512 mb, 41 column sampling of NYC's 311 data\n  * simplified and cleaned-up script now that it's just using 1 data file\n- Upgrade rand and quickcheck crates to latest releases (0.8.4 and 1.0.3 respectively), and modified code accordingly.\n- `cargo update` bumped addr2line (0.16.0->0.17.0), backtrace (0.3.62->0.3.63), gimli (0.25.0->0.26.1) and anyhow (1.0.44->1.0.45)\n\n### Removed\n- removed `scramble` command as its function is now subsumed by the `sort` command with the `--random` and `--seed` options\n- removed `num-format` crate which has a large dependency tree with several old crates; replaced with much smaller `thousands` crate.\n- removed 1M row, 48mb, 7 column world_cities_pop_mil.csv as its no longer used by the revamped benchmark script.\n- removed `build.rs` build dependency that was checking for MSRV of Rust >= \"1.50\". Instead, took advantage of new [`rust-version`](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2021/10/21/Rust-1.56.0.html#cargo-rust-version) Cargo.toml option\nintroduced in Rust 1.56.\n\n## [0.20.0] - 2021-10-31\n### Added\n- added string similarity operations to `apply` command:\n  * simdl: Damerau-Levenshtein similarity\n  * simdln: Normalized Damerau-Levenshtein similarity (between 0.0 & 1.0)\n  * simjw: Jaro-Winkler similarity (between 0.0 & 1.0)\n  * simsd: Sørensen-Dice similarity (between 0.0 & 1.0)\n  * simhm: Hamming distance. Number of positions where characters differ.\n  * simod: OSA Distance.\n  * soundex: sounds like (boolean)\n- added progress bars to commands that may spawn long-running jobs - for this release,\n`apply`, `foreach`, and `lua`. Progress bars can be suppressed with `--quiet` option.\n- added progress bar helper functions to utils.rs.\n- added `apply` to benchmarks.\n- added sample NYC 311 data to benchmarks.\n- added records per second (RECS_PER_SEC) to benchmarks\n\n### Changed\n- major refactoring of `apply` command:\n  - to take advantage of docopt parsing/validation.\n  - instead of one big command, broke down apply to several subcommands:\n    - operations\n    - emptyreplace\n    - datefmt\n    - geocode\n- simplified lat/long regex validator to no longer validate range, as the underlying \ngeocoder function validates it already - 18% geocode speedup.\n- bumped docopt back up to 1.1.1.\n- improved error message when specifying an invalid apply operation.\n\n## [0.19.0] - 2021-10-24\n### Added\n- new `scramble` command. Randomly scrambles a CSV's records.\n- read/write buffer capacity can now be set using environment variables\n`QSV_RDR_BUFFER_CAPACITY` and `QSV_WTR_BUFFER_CAPACITY` (in bytes).\n- added additional test for `apply datefmt`.\n\n### Changed\n- default read buffer doubled from 8k to 16k.\n- default write buffer doubled from 32k to 64k.\n- benchmark script revamped. Now produces aligned output onscreen,\nwhile also creating a benchmark TSV file; downloads the sample file from GitHub;\nbenchmark more commands.\n- version info now also returns memory allocator being used, and number of cpus detected.\n- minor refactor of `enumerate`, `explode`, `fill` and `foreach` commands.\n\n### Removed\n- removed benchmark data from repository. Moved to GitHub wiki instead.\n\n## [0.18.2] - 2021-10-21\n## Changed\n- use docopt v1.1.0 instead of docopt v.1.1.1 for docopt to support all regex features\n\n## [0.18.1] - 2021-10-20\n### Added\n- added `mimalloc` feature flag. [mimalloc](https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc) is Microsoft's performance-oriented memory allocator.\nEarlier versions of qsv used mimalloc by default. Now it is only used when the feature is set.\n- README: Added Performance section.\n- README: Document how to enable `mimalloc` feature.\n\n### Changed\n- README: Explicitly show how to set environment variables on different platforms.\n## [0.18.0] - 2021-10-18\n### Added\n- `stats` `mode` is now also multi-modal -i.e. returns multiples modes when detected. \ne.g. mode[1,1,2,2,3,4,6,6] will return [1,2,6].\nIt will continue to return one mode if there is only one detected.\n- `stats` `quartile` now also computes IQR, lower/upper fences and skew ([using Pearson's median skewness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness#Pearson's_second_skewness_coefficient_(median_skewness))). For code simplicity, calculated skew with quartile.\n- `join` now also support `left-semi` and `left-anti` joins, the same way [Spark does](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-ref-syntax-qry-select-join.html#semi-join).\n- `search` `--flag` option now returns row number, not just '1'.\n- `searchset` `--flag` option now returns row number, followed by a semi-colon, and a list of matching regexes.\n- README: Added badges for Security Audit, Discussion & Docs\n- README: Added FAQ link in fork note.\n\n### Changed\n- point to https://docs.rs/crate/qsv for documentation.\n- README: `stats` and `join` section updated with new features.\n- README: wordsmithing - replaced \"CSV data\" and \"CSV file/s\" with just \"CSV\".\n- in `stats` changed `q2` column name to `q2_median`.\n- removed debug symbols in release build for smaller binaries.\n- minor refactoring of `search`, `searchset` & `stats`.\n\n### Fixed\n- README: fixed `flatten` example.\n\n### Removed\n- removed Rust badge.\n\n## [0.17.3] - 2021-10-12\n### Added\n- added [sample regexset file](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/d209436b588b88b0f92cc133ebcada726f72a2bd) for PII-screening.\n\n### Changed\n- `apply geocode --formatstr` now accepts less US-centric format selectors.\n- `searchset --flag` now shows which regexes match as a list (e.g. \"[1, 3, 5]\"), not just \"1\" or \"0\".\n### Fixed\n- `foreach` command now returns error message on Windows. `foreach` still doesn't work on \nWindows (yet), but at least it returns \"foreach command does not work on Windows.\".\n- `apply geocode` was not accepting valid lat/longs below the equator. Fixed regex validator.\n- more robust `searchset` error handling when attempting to load regexset files.\n- `apply` link on README was off by one. \n## [0.17.2] - 2021-10-10\n\n### Changed\n- bumped `dateparser` to 0.1.6. This now allows `apply datefmt` to properly reformat\ndates without a time component. Before, when reformatting a date like \"July 4, 2020\", \nqsv returns \"2020-07-04T00:00:00+00:00\". It now returns \"2020-07-04\".\n- minor clippy refactoring\n### Removed\n- removed rust-stats submodule introduced in 0.17.1. It turns out\ncrates.io does not allow publishing of crates with local dependencies on submodules. \nPublished the modified rust-stats fork as qsv-stats instead. This allows us to publish\nqsv on crates.io\n- removed unused `textwrap` dependency\n## [0.17.1] - 2021-10-10\n### Fixed\n- explicitly specified embedded modified rust-stats version in Cargo.toml. \n## [0.17.0] - 2021-10-10\n### Added\n- added `searchset` command. Run **multiple regexes** over CSV data in a **single pass**.\n- added `--unicode` flag to `search`, `searchset` and `replace` commands.\nPreviously, regex unicode support was on by default, which comes at the cost of performance.\nAnd since `qsv` optimizes for performance (\"q is for quick\"), it is now off by default.\n- added quartiles calculation to `stats`. Pulled in upstream\n[pending](https://github.com/BurntSushi/rust-stats/pull/15) [PRs](https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv/pull/273) \nfrom [@m15a](https://github.com/m15a) to implement.\n\n### Changed\n- changed variance algorithm. For some reason, the previous variance algorithm was causing\nintermittent test failures on macOS. Pulled in [pending upstream PR](https://github.com/BurntSushi/rust-stats/pull/11)\nfrom [@ruppertmillard](https://github.com/ruppertmillard).\n- embedded [rust-stats fork](https://github.com/jqnatividad/rust-stats) submodule which implements \nquartile and new variance algorithm.\n- changed GitHub Actions to pull in submodules.\n\n### Fixed\n- the project was not following semver properly, as several new features were released \nin the 0.16.x series that should have been MINOR version bumps, not PATCH bumps.\n\n## [0.16.4] - 2021-10-08\n### Added\n- added `geocode` operation to `apply` command. It geocodes to the closest city given a column   \nwith coordinates in Location format ('latitude, longitude') using a static geonames lookup file.   \n(see https://docs.rs/reverse_geocoder)\n- added `currencytonum` operation to `apply` command.\n- added `getquarter.lua` helper script to support `lua` example in [Cookbook](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/wiki#cookbook).\n- added `turnaroundtime.lua` helper script to compute turnaround time.\n- added `nyc311samp.csv` to provide sample data for recipes.\n- added several Date Enrichment and Geocoding recipes to [Cookbook](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/wiki#cookbook).\n\n### Fixed\n- fixed `publish.yml` Github Action workflow to properly create platform specific binaries.\n- fixed variance test to eliminate false positives in macOS.\n\n## [0.16.3] - 2021-10-06\n### Added\n- added `docs` directory. For README reorg, and to add detailed examples per command in the future.\n- added `emptyreplace` operation to `apply` command.\n- added `datefmt` operation to `apply` command.\n- added support for reading from stdin to `join` command.\n- setup GitHub wiki to host [Cookbook](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/wiki#cookbook) and sundry docs to encourage collaborative editing.\n- added footnotes to commands table in README.\n\n### Changed\n- changed GitHub Actions publish workflow so it adds the version to binary zip filename.\n- changed GitHub Actions publish workflow so binary is no longer in `target/release` directory.\n- reorganized README.\n- moved whirlwind tour and benchmarks to `docs` directory.\n- use zipped repo copy of worldcitiespop_mil.csv for benchmarks.\n\n### Fixed\n- fixed links to help text in README for `fixlengths` and `slice` cmds\n- `exclude` not listed in commands table. Added to README.\n\n### Removed\n- Removed `empty0` and `emptyNA` operations in `apply` command.\nReplaced with `emptyreplace`.\n\n## [0.16.2] - 2021-09-30\n### Changed\n- changed Makefile to remove github recipe as we are now using GitHub Actions.\n- Applied rustfmt to entire project [#56](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/issues/56)\n- Changed stats variance test as it was causing false positive test failures on macOS ([details](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/commit/8c45c60de7598c7dc4cedd10ce7cb281ee34db46))\n- removed `-amd64` suffix from binaries built by GitHub Actions.\n\n### Fixed\n- fixed publish Github Actions workflow to zip binaries before uploading.\n\n### Removed \n- removed `.travis.yml` as we are now using GitHub Actions.\n- removed scripts `build-release`, `github-release` and `github-upload` as we are now\n using GitHub Actions.\n- removed `ci` folder as we are now using GitHub Actions.\n- removed `py` command. [#58](https://github.com/jqnatividad/qsv/issues/58)\n\n## [0.16.1] - 2021-09-28\n### Fixed\n- Bumped qsv version to 0.16.1. Inadvertently released 0.16.0 with qsv version still at 0.15.0.\n\n## [0.16.0] - 2021-09-28\n### Added\n- Added a CHANGELOG.\n- Added additional commands/options from [@Yomguithereal](https://github.com/Yomguithereal) \n[xsv fork](https://github.com/Yomguithereal/xsv).\n  * `apply` - Apply series of string transformations to a CSV column.\n  * `behead` - Drop headers from CSV file.\n  * `enum` - Add a new column enumerating rows by adding a column of incremental or \n  uuid identifiers.

          "content": "# Contributing\n\nWe welcome and encourage all contributions to the project. Please read the following guidelines before submitting a pull request.\n\n## Code Contributions\n\nFor code contributions, we follow several conventions:\n\n* Please run `cargo +nightly fmt` before submitting a pull request. We use [rustfmt settings](https://github.com/dathere/qsv/blob/master/rustfmt.toml) that require nightly.\n* Please run `cargo +nightly clippy -F all_features -- -W clippy::perf` before submitting a pull request. The project has its clippy preferences set [here](https://github.com/dathere/qsv/blob/bb4f4c7d683719a30f5e9552d16fba96a6872ce9/src/main.rs#L1-L36), and we generally apply clippy's suggestions with those preferences unless there is a good reason not to.   \nIn that case, our practice is to suppress lints for each specific instance with an optional comment so it does not show up again in future clippy runs, e.g:  \n\n```rust\n#[allow(clippy::unused_assignments)]\nlet mut var_a = String::with_capacity(10); // amortize allocation\n```\n\n* Ensure you have the latest version of Rust nightly installed (`rustup toolchain update nightly`), as we use it for clippy and rustfmt. Running `cargo +nightly fmt` and `cargo +nightly clippy` may return different results if you are not using the latest nightly version of Rust.\n* We use docopt for command line argument parsing as we fully take advantage of its ability to parse command line arguments from the contiguous, verbose usage text that is at the beginning of each command's source code that more popular libraries like clap or structopt do not offer.   \nHowever, since [docopt.rs is unmaintained](https://github.com/docopt/docopt.rs#this-crate-is-unmaintained), we have a [fork](https://github.com/dathere/docopt.rs) that will be maintained along with this project. See this [discussion thread](https://github.com/dathere/qsv/discussions/463) for more details.\n* `unwrap()` and `expect()` are allowed, but there should be an accompanying comment detailing safety\n* TODO: explain testing conventions, and test helpers\n* TODO: explain error handling conventions\n* TODO: explain logging conventions\n* TODO: release practices\n* TODO: explain the various GitHub Action workflows\n\n## Recipe Contributions\n\nWe also welcome and highly encourage recipe contributions!\n\nThe recipes need not be all that complicated or use `qsv` exclusively (feel free to mix and match qsv with other CLI tools) but they should be useful and not trivial. We also ask that you include a short description of the recipe, and a link to the source of the recipe if it is not your own.\n\nJust go to the [Cookbook](https://github.com/dathere/qsv/wiki/Cookbook#cookbook) and add your recipe.\n\nOnce you add a recipe, show it in action! Add a [_\"Show and tell\"_](https://github.com/dathere/qsv/discussions/categories/show-and-tell) entry in [Discussions](https://github.com/dathere/qsv/discussions), and link to your recipe.\n\n## Documentation Contributions\n\nWe are always looking for ways to improve the documentation. If you find a typo, or have a suggestion for improvement, please submit a pull request.\n\nAnd if you want to add a new page to the Wiki, please do! Just make sure to add section headers to your Wiki contributions, so it automatically shows up in the sidebar.\n\nIf you are not familiar with GitHub Wikis, you can find a guide [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/adding-or-editing-wiki-pages#adding-wiki-pages).\n"

This allows us to show the polars rev/tag in --version.\n# The convention to use for QSV_POLARS_REV is:\n# - if we are using a release version of Rust Polars, leave QSV_POLARS_REV empty\n# - if we are using a release version of Python Polars, use the Python tag\n#   (e.g. py-1.19.0)\n# - if we are using a commit hash, separate the tag and commit hash with a colon, in the order of\n#   - Python Polars tag\n#   - short commit hash\n#     (e.g. py-1.19.0:52ea381 to indicate that we are Python Polars 1.19.0,\n#      and the commit hash 52ea381)\n# ================================\n# QSV_POLARS_REV=py-1.19.0:74dad84\n# polars = { git = \"https://github.com/pola-rs/polars\", tag = \"py-1.19.0\" }\npolars = { git = \"https://github.com/pola-rs/polars\", rev = \"74dad84\" }\n# polars-ops = { git = \"https://github.com/pola-rs/polars\", tag = \"py-1.19.0\" }\npolars-ops = { git = \"https://github.com/pola-rs/polars\", rev = \"74dad84\" }\n\n[features]\ndefault = [\"mimalloc\"]\ndistrib_features = [\n    \"feature_capable\",\n    \"apply\",\n    \"fetch\",\n    \"foreach\",\n    \"geocode\",\n    \"luau\",\n    \"polars\",\n    \"python\",\n    \"to\",\n]\nall_features = [\"distrib_features\", \"self_update\", \"ui\"]\napply = [\n    \"base62\",\n    \"censor\",\n    \"cpc\",\n    \"crc32fast\",\n    \"data-encoding\",\n    \"eudex\",\n    \"gender_guesser\",\n    \"hashbrown\",\n    \"qsv_vader_sentiment_analysis\",\n    \"strsim\",\n    \"thousands\",\n    \"titlecase\",\n    \"whatlang\",\n]\nclipboard = [\"arboard\"]\nfetch = [\n    \"cached\",\n    \"console\",\n    \"flate2\",\n    \"governor\",\n    \"hashbrown\",\n    \"publicsuffix\",\n    \"redis\",\n    \"serde_urlencoded\",\n    \"sled\",\n]\nforeach = [\"local-encoding\"]\ngeocode = [\n    \"bytemuck\",\n    \"cached\",\n    \"geosuggest-core\",\n    \"geosuggest-utils\",\n    \"phf\",\n    \"sled\",\n]\nluau = [\"mlua\", \"sanitize-filename\"]\npolars = [\"dep:polars\", \"bytemuck\", \"dep:polars-ops\"]\nprompt = [\"rfd\"]\npython = [\"pyo3\"]\nto = [\"csvs_convert\"]\nlens = [\"csvlens\"]\nlite = []\ndatapusher_plus = [\"self_update\"]\nui = [\"clipboard\", \"prompt\", \"lens\"]\nfeature_capable = []\nnightly = [\n    \"crc32fast/nightly\",\n    \"hashbrown/nightly\",\n    \"polars/nightly\",\n    \"polars/simd\",\n    \"pyo3/nightly\",\n    \"rand/nightly\",\n]\n\n[package.metadata.deb]\nmaintainer           = \"Konstantin Sivakov <konstantin@datHere.com>\"\ncopyright            = \"2024, datHere Inc. <www.dathere.com>\"\nextended-description = \"\"\"A high performance CSV data-wrangling toolkit.\"\"\"\ndepends              = \"$auto\"\nsection              = \"utility\"\npriority             = \"optional\"\n\n# Default feature and asset\nfeatures = [\"feature_capable\"]\nassets   = [[\"target/release/qsv\", \"/usr/local/bin/\", \"755\"]]\n\n# Conditional features and assets\n[package.metadata.deb.variants.lite]\nfeatures = [\"lite\"]\nassets   = [[\"target/release/qsvlite\", \"/usr/local/bin/\", \"755\"]]\n\n[package.metadata.deb.variants.datapusher_plus]\nfeatures = [\"datapusher_plus\", \"luau\"]\nassets   = [[\"target/release/qsvdp\", \"/usr/local/bin/\", \"755\"]]\n"

Apart from a Graphical User Interface, it's superpowered with additional features and capabilities - an API, [CKAN](https://ckan.org) integration, a Natural Language interface, no false-positive Windows Defender warnings and more!\n\n<a href=\"https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/xpffdj3f1jsztf?mode=full\">\n<img\nsrc=\"https://get.microsoft.com/images/en-us%20light.svg\"\nwidth=\"200\"  /></a>\n\n### Option 1: Download Prebuilt Binaries\n\nFull-featured prebuilt [binary variants](#variants) of the latest qsv version for Linux, macOS & Windows are available [for download](https://github.com/dathere/qsv/releases/latest), including binaries compiled with [Rust Nightly](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70745970/rust-nightly-vs-beta-version) ([more info](https://github.com/dathere/qsv/blob/master/docs/PERFORMANCE.md#nightly-release-builds)).\n\nThese prebuilt binaries are also built with CPU optimizations enabled for x86_64 (e.g. [SSE4.2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE4#SSE4.2), [AVX2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions#Advanced_Vector_Extensions_2), [AVX512](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions#Advanced_Vector_Extensions_512), etc. on Intel and AMD processors) and Apple Silicon processors ([ARM64 SIMD NEON](https://eclecticlight.co/2021/08/06/accelerating-the-m1-mac-an-introduction-to-simd/)) for even more performance gains.\n\nFor Windows, an MSI Installer wrapping the x86_64-pc-windows-msvc build is also available for download.\n\nFor macOS, [\"ad-hoc\" signatures](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/distributing-cli-apps-on-macos/70223) are used to sign our binaries, so you will need to [set appropriate Gatekeeper security settings](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491) or run the following command to remove the quarantine attribute from qsv before you run it for the first time:\n\n```bash\n# replace qsv with qsvlite or qsvdp if you installed those binary variants\nxattr -d com.apple.quarantine qsv\n```\n\nAn additional benefit of using the prebuilt binaries is that they have the `self_update` feature enabled, allowing you to quickly update qsv to the latest version with a simple `qsv --update`. For further security, the `self_update` feature only fetches [releases from this GitHub repo](https://github.com/dathere/qsv/releases) and automatically verifies the signature of the downloaded zip archive before installing the update.\n\n> **_NOTE:_** The `luau` feature is not available in `musl` prebuilt binaries[^3].\n\n#### Manually verifying the Integrity of the Prebuilt Binaries Zip Archives\nAll prebuilt binaries zip archives are signed with [zipsign](https://github.com/Kijewski/zipsign#zipsign) with the following public key [qsv-zipsign-public.key](https://github.com/dathere/qsv/raw/master/src/qsv-zipsign-public.key). To verify the integrity of the downloaded zip archives:\n\n```bash\n# if you don't have zipsign installed yet\ncargo install zipsign\n\n# verify the integrity of the downloaded prebuilt binary zip archive\n# after downloading the zip archive and the qsv-zipsign-public.key file.\n# replace <PREBUILT-BINARY-ARCHIVE.zip> with the name of the downloaded zip archive\n# e.g. zipsign verify zip qsv-0.118.0-aarch64-apple-darwin.zip qsv-zipsign-public.key\nzipsign verify zip <PREBUILT-BINARY-ARCHIVE.zip> qsv-zipsign-public.key\n```\n\n### Option 2: Package Managers & Distributions\n\nqsv is also distributed by several package managers and distros.\n\n[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/qsv.svg)](https://repology.org/project/qsv/versions)\n\nHere are the relevant commands for installing qsv using the various package managers and distros:\n```bash\n# Arch Linux AUR (https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/qsv)\nyay -S qsv\n\n# Homebrew on macOS/Linux (https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/qsv#default)\nbrew install qsv\n\n# MacPorts on macOS (https://ports.macports.org/port/qsv/)\nsudo port install qsv\n\n# Nixpkgs on Linux/macOS (https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&show=qsv&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=qsv)\nnix-shell -p qsv\n\n# Scoop on Windows (https://scoop.sh/#/apps?q=qsv)\nscoop install qsv\n\n# Void Linux (https://voidlinux.org/packages/?arch=x86_64&q=qsv)\nsudo xbps-install qsv\n```\n\nNote that qsv provided by these package managers/distros enable different features (Homebrew, for instance, only enables the `apply` and `luau` features. However, it does automatically install shell completion for `bash`, `fish` and `zsh` shells).\n\nTo find out what features are enabled in a package/distro's qsv, run `qsv --version` ([more info](https://github.com/dathere/qsv/blob/master/docs/PERFORMANCE.md#version-details)).\n\nIn the true spirit of open source, these packages are maintained by volunteers who wanted to make qsv easier to install in various environments. They are much appreciated, and we loosely collaborate with the package maintainers through GitHub, but know that these packages are maintained by third-parties.\n\ndatHere also maintains a Debian package targeting the latest Ubuntu LTS on x86_64 architecture to make it easier to install qsv with DataPusher+.\n\nTo install qsv on Ubuntu/Debian:\n\n```bash\nwget -O - https://dathere.github.io/qsv-deb-releases/qsv-deb.gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/qsv-deb.gpg\necho \"deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/qsv-deb.gpg] https://dathere.github.io/qsv-deb-releases ./\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/qsv.list\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install qsv\n```\n\n### Option 3: Install with Rust\n\nIf you have [Rust installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), you can also install from source using Rust's cargo command[^2]:\n\n[^2]: Of course, you'll also need a linker & a C compiler. Linux users should generally install GCC or Clang, according to their distribution’s documentation.\nFor example, if you use Ubuntu, you can install the `build-essential` package. On macOS, you can get a C compiler by running `$ xcode-select --install`.\nFor Windows, this means installing [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). When prompted for workloads, include \"Desktop Development with C++\",\nthe Windows 10 or 11 SDK & the English language pack, along with any other language packs your require.\n\n```bash\ncargo install qsv --locked --features all_features\n```\n\nThe binary will be installed in `~/.cargo/bin`.\n\nTo install different [variants](#variants) and enable optional features, use cargo `--features` (see [Feature Flags](#feature-flags) for more info):\n\n```bash\n# to install qsv with all features enabled\ncargo install qsv --locked --bin qsv --features feature_capable,apply,fetch,foreach,geocode,luau,polars,python,self_update,to,ui\n# or shorthand\ncargo install qsv --locked --bin qsv -F all_features\n\n# or enable only the apply and polars features\ncargo install qsv --locked --bin qsv -F feature_capable,apply,polars\n\n# or to install qsvlite\ncargo install qsv --locked --bin qsvlite -F lite\n\n# or to install qsvdp\ncargo install qsv --locked --bin qsvdp -F datapusher_plus,luau,polars\n```\n\n> **_NOTE:_** if you get compilation errors when running `cargo install`, use Option 4 to compile from source using `cargo build`. The errors are usually due to `cargo install` only using the latest release version of qsv's dependencies, and ignoring `patch.crates-io` entries in our Cargo.toml.\n\n### Option 4: Compile from Source\n\nCompiling from source also works similarly[^2]:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/dathere/qsv.git\ncd qsv\ncargo build --release --locked --bin qsv --features all_features\n```\n\nThe compiled binary will end up in `./target/release/`.\n\nTo compile different [variants](#variants) and enable optional [features](#feature-flags):\n\n```bash\n# to compile qsv with all features enabled\ncargo build --release --locked --bin qsv --features feature_capable,apply,fetch,foreach,geocode,luau,polars,python,self_update,to,ui\n# shorthand\ncargo build --release --locked --bin qsv -F all_features\n\n# or build qsv with only the fetch and foreach features enabled\ncargo build --release --locked --bin qsv -F feature_capable,fetch,foreach\n\n# for qsvlite\ncargo build --release --locked --bin qsvlite -F lite\n\n# for qsvdp\ncargo build --release --locked --bin qsvdp -F datapusher_plus,luau,polars\n```\n\n> **_NOTE:_** To build with Rust nightly, see [Nightly Release Builds](docs/PERFORMANCE.md#nightly-release-builds).\nThe `feature_capable`, `lite` and `datapusher_plus` are MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE features. See [Special Build Features](docs/FEATURES.md#special-features-for-building-qsv-binary-variants) for more info.\n\n### Variants\n\nThere are four binary variants of qsv:\n\n* `qsv` - [feature](#feature-flags)-capable(✨), with the [prebuilt binaries](https://github.com/dathere/qsv/releases/latest) enabling all applicable features except Python [^3]\n* `qsvpy` - same as `qsv` but with the Python feature enabled. Three subvariants are available - qsvpy310, qsvpy311 & qsvpy312 - which are compiled with the latest patch version of Python 3.10, 3.11 & 3.12 respectively.\n* `qsvlite` - all features disabled (~13% of the size of `qsv`)\n* `qsvdp` - optimized for use with [DataPusher+](https://github.com/dathere/datapusher-plus) with only DataPusher+ relevant commands; an embedded [`luau`](#luau_deeplink) interpreter; [`applydp`](#applydp_deeplink), a slimmed-down version of the `apply` feature; the `--progressbar` option disabled; and the self-update only checking for new releases, requiring an explicit `--update` (~12% of the the size of `qsv`).\n\n> **_NOTE:_** There are \"portable\" subvariants of qsv available with the \"p\" suffix - `qsvp`, `qsvplite` and `qsvpdp`. These subvariants are compiled without any CPU features enabled. Use these subvariants if you're getting \"Illegal instruction\" errors when running the regular qsv binaries.\n\n[^3]: The `luau`feature is NOT enabled by default on the prebuilt binaries for musl platforms. This is because we cross-compile using GitHub Action Runners using Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with the [musl libc](https://musl.libc.org/) toolchain. However, Ubuntu is a glibc-based, not a musl-based distro. We get around this by [cross-compiling](https://blog.logrocket.com/guide-cross-compilation-rust/).   \nUnfortunately, this prevents us from cross-compiling binaries with the `luau` feature enabled as doing so requires statically linking the host OS libc library. If you need the `luau` feature on `musl`, you will need to compile from source on your own musl-based Linux Distro (e.g. Alpine, Void, [etc.](https://wiki.musl-libc.org/projects-using-musl)).  \n\n### Shell Completion\nqsv has extensive, extendable [shell completion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_completion) support. It currently supports the following shells: `bash`, `zsh`, `powershell`, `fish`, `nushell`, `fig` & `elvish`.\n\nTo enable shell completion, see the [Shell Completion](contrib/completions/README.md) documentation. If you're using Bash, you can also follow the step-by-step tutorial at [100.dathere.com](https://100.dathere.com/exercises-setup.html#optional-set-up-qsv-completions).  \n\n## Regular Expression Syntax\n\nThe `--select` option and several commands (`apply`, `applydp`, `datefmt`, `exclude`, `fetchpost`, `replace`, `schema`, `search`, `searchset`, `select`, `sqlp` & `stats`) allow the user to specify regular expressions. We use the [`regex`](https://docs.rs/regex) crate to parse, compile and execute these expressions. [^4]\n\n[^4]: This is the same regex engine used by [`ripgrep`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#ripgrep-rg) - the [blazingly fast grep replacement](https://blog.burntsushi.net/ripgrep/) that powers Visual Studio's [magical](https://lab.cccb.org/en/arthur-c-clarke-any-sufficiently-advanced-technology-is-indistinguishable-from-magic/) [\"Find in Files\"](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-ripgrep) feature.\n\nIts syntax can be found [here](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#syntax) and *\"is similar to other regex engines, but it lacks several features that are not known how to implement efficiently. This includes, but is not limited to, look-around and backreferences. In exchange, all regex searches in this crate have worst case O(m * n) time complexity, where m is proportional to the size of the regex and n is proportional to the size of the string being searched.\"*\n\nIf you want to test your regular expressions, [regex101](https://regex101.com) supports the syntax used by the `regex` crate. Just select the \"Rust\" flavor.\n\n## File formats\n\nqsv recognizes UTF-8/ASCII encoded, CSV (`.csv`), SSV (`.ssv`) and TSV files (`.tsv` & `.tab`). CSV files are assumed to have \",\" (comma) as a delimiter, SSV files have \";\" (semicolon) as a delimiter\nand TSV files, \"\\t\" (tab) as a delimiter. The delimiter is a single ascii character that can be set either by the `--delimiter` command-line option or\nwith the `QSV_DEFAULT_DELIMITER` environment variable or automatically detected when `QSV_SNIFF_DELIMITER` is set.\n\nWhen using the `--output` option, qsv will UTF-8 encode the file & automatically change the delimiter used in the generated file based on the file extension - i.e. comma for `.csv`, semicolon for `.ssv`, tab for `.tsv` & `.tab` files.\n\nJSON files are recognized & converted to CSV with the [`json`](/src/cmd/json.rs#L2) command.\n[JSONL](https://jsonlines.org/)/[NDJSON](http://ndjson.org/) files are also recognized & converted to/from CSV with the [`jsonl`](/src/cmd/jsonl.rs#L2) and [`tojsonl`](/src/cmd/tojsonl.rs#L2) commands respectively.\n\nThe `fetch` & `fetchpost` commands also produces JSONL files when its invoked without the `--new-column` option & TSV files with the `--report` option.\n\nThe `excel`, `safenames`, `sniff`, `sortcheck` & `validate` commands produce JSON files with their JSON options following the [JSON API 1.1 specification](https://jsonapi.org/format/), so it can return detailed machine-friendly metadata that can be used by other systems.\n\nThe `schema` command produces a [JSON Schema Validation (Draft 7)](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-validation.html) file with the \".schema.json\" file extension, which can be used with the `validate` command to validate other CSV files with an identical schema.\n\nThe `excel` command recognizes Excel & Open Document Spreadsheet(ODS) files (`.xls`, `.xlsx`, `.xlsm`, `.xlsb` & `.ods` files).\n\nSpeaking of Excel, if you're having trouble opening qsv-generated CSV files in Excel, set the QSV_OUTPUT_BOM environment variable to add a [Byte Order Mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark) to the beginning of the generated CSV file. This is a workaround for [Excel's UTF-8 encoding detection bug](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/155097/microsoft-excel-mangles-diacritics-in-csv-files).\n\nThe `to` command converts CSVs to `.xlsx`, [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org) & [Data Package](https://datahub.io/docs/data-packages/tabular) files, and populates [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) and [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) databases.\n\nThe `sqlp` command returns query results in CSV, JSON, JSONL, Parquet, [Apache Arrow IPC](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html#ipc-file-format) & [Apache AVRO](https://avro.apache.org) formats. Polars SQL also supports reading external files directly in various formats with its `read_csv`, `read_ndjson`, `read_parquet` & `read_ipc` [table functions](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/blob/91a423fea2dc067837db65c3608e3cbc1112a6fc/crates/polars-sql/src/table_functions.rs#L18-L43).\n\nThe `sniff` command can also detect the mime type of any file with the `--no-infer` or `--just-mime` options, may it be local or remote (http and https schemes supported).\nIt can detect more than 130 file formats, including MS Office/Open Document files, JSON, XML, PDF, PNG, JPEG and specialized geospatial formats like GPX, GML, KML, TML, TMX, TSX, TTML.\nClick [here](https://docs.rs/file-format/latest/file_format/#reader-features) for a complete list.\n\n### Extended Input Support\n\nThe `cat`, `headers`, `sqlp` & `to` commands have extended input support (🗄️). If the input is `-` or empty, the command will try to use stdin as input. If it's not, it will check if its a directory, and if so, add all the files in the directory as input files.\n\nIf its a file, it will first check if it has an `.infile-list` extension. If it does, it will load the text file and parse each line as an input file path. This is a much faster and convenient way to process a large number of input files, without having to pass them all as separate command-line arguments. Further, the file paths can be anywhere in the file system, even on separate volumes. If an input file path is not fully qualified, it will be treated as relative to the current working directory. Empty lines and lines starting with `#` are ignored. Invalid file paths will be logged as warnings and skipped.\n\nFor both directory and `.infile-list` input, snappy compressed files with a `.sz` extension will be automatically decompressed.\n\nFinally, if its just a regular file, it will be treated as a regular input file.\n\n### Automatic Compression/Decompression\n\nqsv supports _automatic compression/decompression_ using the [Snappy frame format](https://github.com/google/snappy/blob/main/framing_format.txt). Snappy was chosen instead of more popular compression formats like gzip because it was designed for [high-performance streaming compression & decompression](https://github.com/google/snappy/tree/main/docs#readme) (up to 2.58 gb/sec compression, 0.89 gb/sec decompression).\n\nFor all commands except the `index`, `extdedup` & `extsort` commands, if the input file has an \".sz\" extension, qsv will _automatically_ do streaming decompression as it reads it. Further, if the input file has an extended CSV/TSV \".sz\" extension (e.g nyc311.csv.sz/nyc311.tsv.sz/nyc311.tab.sz), qsv will also use the file extension to determine the delimiter to use.   \n\nSimilarly, if the `--output` file has an \".sz\" extension, qsv will _automatically_ do streaming compression as it writes it.\nIf the output file has an extended CSV/TSV \".sz\" extension, qsv will also use the file extension to determine the delimiter to use.  \n\nNote however that compressed files cannot be indexed, so index-accelerated commands (`frequency`, `schema`, `split`, `stats`, `tojsonl`) will not be multithreaded. Random access is also disabled without an index, so `slice` will not be instantaneous and `luau`'s random-access mode will not be available.\n\nThere is also a dedicated [`snappy`](/src/cmd/snappy.rs#L2) command with four subcommands for direct snappy file operations — a multithreaded `compress` subcommand (4-5x faster than the built-in, single-threaded auto-compression); a `decompress` subcommand with detailed compression metadata; a `check` subcommand to quickly inspect if a file has a Snappy header; and a `validate` subcommand to confirm if a Snappy file is valid.\n\nThe `snappy` command can be used to compress/decompress ANY file, not just CSV/TSV files.\n\nUsing the `snappy` command, we can compress NYC's 311 data (15gb, 28m rows) to 4.95 gb in _5.77 seconds_ with the multithreaded `compress` subcommand - _2.58 gb/sec_ with a 0.33 (3.01:1) compression ratio.  With `snappy decompress`, we can roundtrip decompress the same file in _16.71 seconds_ - _0.89 gb/sec_.\n\nCompare that to [zip 3.0](https://infozip.sourceforge.net/Zip.html), which compressed the same file to 2.9 gb in _248.3 seconds on the same machine - 43x slower at 0.06 gb/sec_ with a 0.19 (5.17:1) compression ratio - for just an additional 14% (2.45 gb) of saved space. zip also took 4.3x longer to roundtrip decompress the same file in _72 seconds_ - _0.20 gb/sec_.\n\n> **_NOTE:_** In addition to `snappy` support, the `sqlp` command also supports automatic decompression of gzip, zstd and zlib compressed input files using the [`read_csv()` table function](https://github.com/dathere/qsv/blob/aa3b20f8ba3ae41b02a3c5d445092571f064b90d/src/cmd/sqlp.rs#L120-L130). It also supports automatic compression of output files when using the Arrow, Avro and Parquet output formats (using the [`--format`](https://github.com/dathere/qsv/blob/aa3b20f8ba3ae41b02a3c5d445092571f064b90d/src/cmd/sqlp.rs#L178-L185) and [`--compression`](https://github.com/dathere/qsv/blob/aa3b20f8ba3ae41b02a3c5d445092571f064b90d/src/cmd/sqlp.rs#L246-L261) options).\n\n## RFC 4180 CSV Standard\n\nqsv follows the [RFC 4180](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4180) CSV standard. However, in real life, CSV formats vary significantly & qsv is actually not strictly compliant with the specification so it can process \"real-world\" CSV files.\nqsv leverages the awesome [Rust CSV](https://docs.rs/csv/latest/csv/) crate to read/write CSV files.\n\nClick [here](https://docs.rs/csv-core/latest/csv_core/struct.Reader.html#rfc-4180) to find out more about how qsv conforms to the standard using this crate.\n\nWhen dealing with \"atypical\" CSV files, you can use the `input` & `fmt` commands to normalize them to be RFC 4180-compliant.\n\n## UTF-8 Encoding\n\nqsv requires UTF-8 encoded input (of which ASCII is a subset).\n\nShould you need to re-encode CSV/TSV files, you can use the `input` command to \"lossy save\" to UTF-8 - replacing invalid UTF-8 sequences with `�` ([U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/char/constant.REPLACEMENT_CHARACTER.html)).\n\nAlternatively, if you want to truly transcode to UTF-8, there are several utilities like [`iconv`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iconv) that you can use to do so on [Linux/macOS](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/805418/how-can-i-find-encoding-of-a-file-via-a-script-on-linux) & [Windows](https://superuser.com/questions/1163753/converting-text-file-to-utf-8-on-windows-command-prompt).\n\n### Windows Powershell and Windows Excel Usage Note\n\nUnlike other modern operating systems, Microsoft Windows' [default encoding](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_character_encoding?view=powershell-7.4) [is UTF16-LE](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66072117/why-does-windows-use-utf-16le). This will cause problems when redirecting qsv's output to a CSV file in Powershell & trying to open it with Excel - everything will be in the first column, as the UTF16-LE encoded CSV file will not be properly recognized by Excel.\n\n```\n# the following command will produce a UTF16-LE encoded CSV file on Windows\nqsv stats wcp.csv > wcpstats.csv\n```\n\nWhich is weird, since you'd think [Microsoft's own Excel would properly recognize UTF16-LE encoded CSV files](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/opening-csv-file-with-utf16-encoding-in-excel-2010/ed522cb9-e88d-4b82-b88e-a2d4bd99f874?auth=1). Regardless, to create a properly UTF-8 encoded file on Windows, use the `--output` option instead:\n\n```\n# so instead of redirecting stdout to a file on Windows\nqsv stats wcp.csv > wcpstats.csv\n\n# do this instead, so it will be properly UTF-8 encoded\nqsv stats wcp.csv --output wcpstats.csv\n```\n\nAlternatively, qsv can add a [Byte Order Mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark) (BOM) to the beginning of a CSV to indicate it's UTF-8 encoded. You can do this by setting the `QSV_OUTPUT_BOM` environment variable to `1`.\n\nThis will allow Excel on Windows to properly recognize the CSV file as UTF-8 encoded.\n\nNote that this is not a problem with Excel on macOS, as macOS (like most other *nixes) uses UTF-8 as its default encoding.\n\nNor is it a problem with qsv output files produced on other operating systems, as Excel on Windows can properly recognize UTF-8 encoded CSV files.\n\n## Interpreters\nFor complex data-wrangling tasks, you can use Luau and Python scripts.\n\nLuau is recommended over Python for complex data-wrangling tasks as it is faster, more memory-efficient, has no external dependencies and has several data-wrangling helper functions as qsv's DSL.\n\nSee [Luau vs Python](docs/INTERPRETERS.md) for more info.\n\n## Memory Management\nqsv supports three memory allocators - mimalloc (default), jemalloc and the standard allocator.<br>See [Memory Allocator](docs/PERFORMANCE.md#memory-allocator) for more info.\n\nIt also has Out-of-Memory prevention, with two modes - NORMAL (default) & CONSERVATIVE.<br>See [Out-of-Memory Prevention](docs/PERFORMANCE.md#out-of-memory-oom-prevention) for more info.\n\n## Environment Variables & dotenv file support\n\nqsv supports an extensive list of environment variables and supports `.env` files to set them.\n\nFor details, see [Environment Variables](docs/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md) and the [`dotenv.template.yaml`](dotenv.template) file.\n## Feature Flags\n\nqsv has several [feature flags](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html) that can be used to enable/disable optional features.\n\nSee [Features](docs/FEATURES.md) for more info.\n\n## Minimum Supported Rust Version\n\nqsv's MSRV policy is to require the latest stable [Rust version](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.md) that is [supported by Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/rust#default), currently [![HomeBrew](https://img.shields.io/homebrew/v/rust?logo=homebrew)](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/rust). \nqsv itself may upgrade its MSRV, but a new qsv release will only be made once Homebrew supports the latest Rust stable.\n\n## Goals / Non-Goals\n\nQuickSilver's goals, in priority order, are to be:\n* **As Fast as Possible** - To do so, it has frequent releases, an aggressive MSRV policy, takes advantage of CPU features, employs [various caching strategies](docs/PERFORMANCE.md#caching), uses [HTTP/2](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/http2-vs-http1.1/#:~:text=Multiplexing%3A%20HTTP%2F1.1%20loads%20resources,resource%20blocks%20any%20other%20resource.), and is multithreaded when possible and it makes sense. It also uses the latest dependencies when possible, and will use Cargo [`patch`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/overriding-dependencies.html#the-patch-section) to get unreleased fixes/features from its dependencies. See [Performance](docs/PERFORMANCE.md) for more info.\n* **Able to Process Very Large Files** - Most qsv commands are streaming, using constant memory, and can process arbitrarily large CSV files. For those commands that require loading the entire CSV into memory (denoted by 🤯), qsv has Out-of-Memory prevention, batch processing strategies and \"ext\"ernal commands that use the disk to process larger than memory files. See [Memory Management](docs/PERFORMANCE.md#memory-management) for more info.\n* **A Complete Data-Wrangling Toolkit** - qsv aims to be a comprehensive data-wrangling toolkit that you can use for quick analysis and investigations, but is also robust enough for production data pipelines. Its many commands are targeted towards common data-wrangling tasks and can be combined/composed into complex data-wrangling scripts with its Luau-based DSL.  \nLuau will also serve as the backbone of a whole library of **qsv recipes** - reusable scripts for common tasks (e.g. street-level geocoding, removing PII, data enrichment, etc.) that prompt for easily modifiable parameters.   \n* **Composable/Interoperable** - qsv is designed to be composable, with a focus on interoperability with other common CLI tools like 'awk', 'xargs', 'ripgrep', 'sed', etc., and with well known ETL/ELT tools like Airbyte, Airflow, Pentaho Kettle, etc. Its commands can be combined with other tools via pipes, and it supports other common file formats like JSON/JSONL, Parquet, Arrow IPC, Avro, Excel, ODS, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc. See [File Formats](#file-formats) for more info.\n* **As Portable as Possible** - qsv is designed to be portable, with installers on several platforms with an integrated self-update mechanism. In preference order, it supports Linux, macOS and Windows. See [Installation Options](#installation-options) for more info.\n* **As Easy to Use as Possible** - qsv is designed to be easy to use. As easy-to-use that is,\n as command line interfaces go :shrug:. Its commands have numerous options but have sensible defaults. The usage text is written for a data analyst audience, not developers; and there are numerous examples in the usage text, with the tests doubling as examples as well. With [qsv pro](https://qsvpro.dathere.com), it has much expanded functionality while being easier to use with its Graphical User Interface.\n* **As Secure as Possible** - qsv is designed to be secure. It has no external runtime dependencies, is [written](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/why-aws-loves-rust-and-how-wed-like-to-help/) [in](https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2019/07/why-rust-for-safe-systems-programming/) [Rust](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2023/06/rust-fact-vs-fiction-5-insights-from-googles-rust-journey-2022.html), and it's codebase is automatically audited for security vulnerabilities with automated [DevSkim](https://github.com/microsoft/DevSkim#devskim), [\"cargo audit\"](https://rustsec.org) and [Codacy](https://app.codacy.com/gh/dathere/qsv/dashboard) Github Actions workflows.  \nIt uses the latest stable Rust version, with an aggressive MSRV policy and the latest version of all its dependencies.\nIt has an extensive test suite with ~1,740 tests, including several [property tests](https://medium.com/criteo-engineering/introduction-to-property-based-testing-f5236229d237) which [randomly generate](https://github.com/BurntSushi/quickcheck#quickcheck) parameters for oft-used commands.   \nIts prebuilt binary archives are [zipsigned](https://github.com/Kijewski/zipsign#zipsign), so you can [verify their integrity](#verifying-the-integrity-of-the-prebuilt-binaries-zip-archives). Its self-update mechanism automatically verifies the integrity of the prebuilt binaries archive before applying an update.\nSee [Security](docs/SECURITY.md) for more info.\n* **As Easy to Contribute to as Possible** - qsv is designed to be easy to contribute to, with a focus on maintainability. It's modular architecture allows the easy addition of self-contained commands gated by feature flags, the source code is heavily commented, the usage text is embedded, and there are helper functions that make it easy to create additional commands and supporting tests. See [Features](docs/FEATURES.md) and [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more info.\n\nQuickSilver's non-goals are to be:\n* **As Small as Possible** - qsv is designed to be small, but not at the expense of performance, features, composability, portability, usability, security or maintainability. However, we do have a `qsvlite` variant that is ~13% of the size of `qsv` and a `qsvdp` variant that is ~12% of the size of `qsv`. Those variants, however, have reduced functionality.\nFurther, several commands are gated behind feature flags, so you can compile qsv with only the features you need.\n* **Multi-lingual** - qsv's _usage text_ and _messages_ are English-only. There are no plans to support other languages. This does not mean it can only process English input files.  \nIt can process well-formed CSVs in _any_ language so long as its UTF-8 encoded. Further, it supports alternate delimiters/separators other than comma; the `apply whatlang` operation detects 69 languages; and its `apply thousands, currency and eudex` operations supports different languages and country conventions for number, currency and date parsing/formatting.  \nFinally, though the default Geonames index of the `geocode` command is English-only, the index can be rebuilt with the `geocode index-update` subcommand with the `--languages` option to return place names in multiple languages ([with support for 254 languages](http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/alternatenames/)).\n\n## Testing\nqsv has ~1,740 tests in the [tests](https://github.com/dathere/qsv/tree/master/tests) directory.\nEach command has its own test suite in a separate file with the convention `test_<COMMAND>.rs`.\nApart from preventing regressions, the tests also serve as good illustrative examples, and are often linked from the usage text of each corresponding command.\n\nTo test each binary variant:\n\n```bash\n# to test qsv\ncargo test --features all_features\n\n# to test qsvlite\ncargo test --features lite\n# to test all tests with \"stats\" in the name with qsvlite\ncargo test stats --features lite\n\n# to test qsvdp\ncargo test --features datapusher_plus,luau,polars\n\n# to test a specific command\n# here we test only stats and use the\n# t alias for test and the -F shortcut for --features\ncargo t stats -F all_features\n\n# to test a specific command with a specific feature\n# here we test only luau command with the luau feature\ncargo t luau -F feature_capable,luau\n\n# to test the count command with multiple features\n# we use \"test_count\" as we don't want to run other tests\n# that have \"count\" in the testname - e.g. test_geocode_countryinfo\ncargo t test_count -F feature_capable,luau,polars\n\n# to test using an alternate allocator\n# other than the default mimalloc allocator\ncargo t --no-default-features -F all_features,jemallocator\n```\n\n## License\n\nDual-licensed under MIT or the [UNLICENSE](https://unlicense.org).\n\n\n[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.com/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fjqnatividad%2Fqsv.svg?type=large)](https://app.fossa.com/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fjqnatividad%2Fqsv?ref=badge_large)\n\n## Origins\n\nqsv is a fork of the popular [xsv](https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv) utility, merging several pending PRs [since xsv 0.13.0's May 2018 release](https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv/issues/267).
