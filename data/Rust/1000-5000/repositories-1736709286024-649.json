It is being superseded by the [Rapier](https://rapier.rs) project.**⚠️\n\n-----\n\nnphysics\n========\n**nphysics** is a 2 and 3-dimensional physics engine for games and animations.\nIt uses [ncollide](http://ncollide.org) for collision detection, and\n[nalgebra](http://nalgebra.org) for vector/matrix math. 2D and 3D\nimplementations both share the same code!\n\n\nExamples are available in the `examples2d` and `examples3d` directories. Interactive\n3D are available [there](http://demo.nphysics.org/). Because those demos are based on\nWASM and WebGl 1.0 they should work on most modern browsers. Feel free to ask for help\nand discuss features on the official [user forum](http://users.nphysics.org).\n\n## Why another physics engine?\nThere are a lot of physics engine out there.\nHowever having a physics engine written in Rust is much more fun than\nwriting bindings and has several advantages:\n\n- It shows that Rust is suitable for soft real-time applications.\n− It features an efficient implementation of multibodies using the reduced-coordinates approach. Constraint-based joints are also supported.\n- It shows that there is no need to write two separate engines for 2D and 3D:\n  genericity wrt the dimension is possible (modulo low level arithmetic\n  specializations for each dimension).\n- In a not-that-near future, C++ will die of ugliness. Then, people will\n  search for a physics engine and **nphysics** will be there, proudly\n  exhibiting its _Rusty_ sexiness.\n\n## Features\n- Static, dynamic, and kinematic rigid bodies.\n- Common convex primitives: box, ball, convex polyhedron.\n- Concave geometries built from convex primitives: compound geometries, triangle mesh, polylines.\n- Multibodies using reduced-coordinates approaches or constraints-based joints.\n- Multibody joint limits and motors.\n- Stable stacking due to non-linear a position-based penetration correction and one-shot contact manifold generation.\n- Island based sleeping (objects deactivation when they are at rest).\n- Ray casting.\n- Swept sphere based continuous collision detection.\n- Ball-in-socket joint.\n- FixedJoint joint.\n- Sensors.\n- Deformable bodies (aka. soft-bodies)\n- Kinematic bodies\n- WASM support\n\n## What is missing?\n**nphysics** is a very young library and needs to learn a lot of things to\nbecome a grown up. Many missing features are because of missing features on\n**ncollide**. Features missing from **nphysics** itself include:\n\n- more joints, joint limits, joint motors and breakable joints.\n- parallel pipeline\n- GPU-based pipeline\n\n## Dependencies\nThe libraries needed to compile the physics engine are:\n\n* [ncollide](http://ncollide.org): the collision detection library.\n* [nalgebra](http://nalgebra.org): the linear algebra library.\n\nThe libraries needed to compile the examples are:\n\n* [kiss3d](http://kiss3d.org): the 3d graphics engine.\n"
