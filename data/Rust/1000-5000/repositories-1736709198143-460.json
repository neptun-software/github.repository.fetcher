          "content": "# Contribution Guidelines\n\nThank you for your interest in Spice.ai!\n\nThis project welcomes contributions and suggestions.\n\nContributions come in many forms: submitting issues, writing code, participating in discussions and community calls.\n\nThis document provides the guidelines for how to contribute to the Spice.ai project.\n\n## Issues\n\nThis section describes the guidelines for submitting issues\n\n### Issue Types\n\nThere are 4 types of issues:\n\n- Issue/Bug: You've found a bug with the code, and want to report it, or create an issue to track the bug.\n- Issue/Discussion: You have something on your mind, which requires input from others in a discussion, before it eventually manifests as a proposal.\n- Issue/Proposal: Used for items that propose a new idea or functionality. This allows feedback from others before code is written.\n- Issue/Question: Use this issue type, if you need help or have a question.\n\n### Before You File\n\nBefore you file an issue, make sure you've checked the following:\n\n1. Check for existing issues\n   - Before you create a new issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.\n   - If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reaction-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction:\n     - 👍 up-vote\n     - 👎 down-vote\n1. For bugs\n   - You have as much data as possible. This usually comes in the form of logs and/or stacktraces. Screenshots or screen recordings of the buggy behavior are very helpful.\n\n## Contributing to Spice.ai\n\nThis section describes the guidelines for contributing code / docs to Spice.ai.\n\n### Follow principles and guidelines\n\n- [Principles](/docs/PRINCIPLES.md)\n- [Style Guide](/docs/dev/style_guide.md)\n- [Error Handling](/docs/dev/error_handling.md)\n- [Metrics Naming](/docs/dev/metrics.md)\n\n### Pull Requests\n\nAll contributions come through pull requests. To submit a proposed change, we recommend following this workflow:\n\n1. Make sure there's an issue (bug or proposal) raised, which sets the expectations for the contribution you are about to make.\n1. Fork the repo and create a new branch\n1. Create your change\n   - Code changes require tests\n1. Update relevant documentation for the change\n1. Commit and open a PR\n1. Wait for the CI process to finish and make sure all checks are green\n1. A maintainer of the project will be assigned, and you can expect a review within a few days\n\n### Use work-in-progress PRs for early feedback\n\nA good way to communicate before investing too much time is to create a \"Work-in-progress\" PR and share it with your reviewers. The standard way of doing this is to add a \"[WIP]\" prefix in your PR's title and assign the **do-not-merge** label. This will let people looking at your PR know that it is not well baked yet.\n\n## Security Vulnerability Reporting\n\nSpice.ai takes security and our users' trust very seriously. If you believe you have found a security issue in any of our open source projects, please responsibly disclose it by contacting security@spice.ai.\n\n### Use of Third-party code\n\n- Third-party code must include licenses.\n\n## Building\n\n`spiceai` consists of two main binaries. `spiced` is the runtime daemon written in Rust.\n`spice` is the command line interface for end users written in go. All targets can\nbe built from Makefiles.\n\n### Setting up your development environment\n\n#### MacOS\n\n```bash\n# Install Xcode Command Line Tools\nxcode-select --install\n\n# Install Homebrew\n# Note: Be sure to follow the steps in the Homebrew installation output to add Homebrew to your PATH.\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n\n# Install dependencies\nbrew install rust\nbrew install go\n\n# Cmake/Protobuf are only required for building the databricks connector\nbrew install cmake\nbrew install protobuf\n\n# Clone SpiceAI OSS Repo\ngit clone https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai.git\ncd spiceai\n\n# Build and install OSS project in release mode\nmake install\n\n# Build and install OSS project in dev mode\nmake install-dev\n\n# Also you can specify specific features\nSPICED_CUSTOM_FEATURES=\"postgres sqlite\" make install\n\n# Run the following to temporarily add spice to your PATH.\n# Add it to the end of your .bashrc or .zshrc to permanently add spice to your PATH.\nexport PATH=\"$PATH:$HOME/.spice/bin\"\n\n# Initialize and run a test app to ensure everything is working\ncd ../\nmkdir test-app\ncd test-app\nspice init test-app\nspice run\n```\n\n#### Linux (Ubuntu)\n\n```bash\n# Install system dependencies\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install build-essential curl openssl libssl-dev pkg-config protobuf-compiler cmake\n\n# Install Go\nexport GO_VERSION=\"1.23.4\"\nrm -rf /tmp/spice\nmkdir -p /tmp/spice\ncd /tmp/spice\nwget https://go.dev/dl/go$GO_VERSION.linux-amd64.tar.gz\ntar xvfz go$GO_VERSION.linux-amd64.tar.gz\nsudo mv ./go /usr/local/go\necho 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin' >> $HOME/.profile\nsource $HOME/.profile\ncd $HOME\nrm -rf /tmp/spice\n\n# Install Rust\ncurl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y # install unattended\nsource $HOME/.cargo/env\n\n# Clone SpiceAI OSS Repo\ngit clone https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai.git\ncd spiceai\n\n# Build and install OSS project in release mode\nmake install\n\n# Build and install OSS project in dev mode\nmake install-dev\n\n# Also you can specify specific features\nSPICED_CUSTOM_FEATURES=\"postgres sqlite\" make install\n\n# Run the following to temporarily add spice to your PATH.\n# Add it to the end of your .bashrc or .zshrc to permanently add spice to your PATH.\nexport PATH=\"$PATH:$HOME/.spice/bin\"\n\n# Initialize and run a test app to ensure everything is working\ncd ../\nmkdir test-app\ncd test-app\nspice init test-app\nspice run\n```\n\n#### VSCode Configuration\n\nTo configure VSCode to automatically apply the rustfmt style on save and to use the same Clippy rules we enforce in our CI as the default, add the following in your User Settings JSON file:\n\n```json\n  \"[rust]\": {\n    \"editor.defaultFormatter\": \"rust-lang.rust-analyzer\",\n    \"editor.formatOnSave\": true,\n  },\n  \"rust-analyzer.check.command\": \"clippy\",\n  \"rust-analyzer.check.features\": \"all\",\n  \"rust-analyzer.check.extraArgs\": [\"--\", \"-Dclippy::pedantic\", \"-Dclippy::unwrap_used\", \"-Dclippy::clone_on_ref_ptr\", \"-Aclippy::module_name_repetitions\"]\n```\n\nBy default, `rust-analyzer` will attempt to rebuild all dependencies when a change is made to a `cargo.toml` file. To prevent this and only rebuild what has changed, add the following in your User Settings JSON file, setting the value to your architecture:\n\n```json\n   \"rust-analyzer.cargo.target\": \"aarch64-apple-darwin\",\n```\n\nTo see all valid values use `rustc --print target-list`.\n\n### Build Options\n\n`spiced` is the default-member of the [Cargo workspace crate](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/workspaces.html).\nIts manifests should allow custom builds where heavy dependencies are optional.\n\nOther workspace crates shouldn't include large features by default. This makes excluding features less error prone.\nAlternatively, crates that depend on those workspace crates need to set `default-features = false`.\n\nFor example, to support a newly popular database called `newdb`, add it by default to `bin/Cargo.toml`:\n\n```diff\n [features]\n-default = [\"duckdb\", \"postgres\", \"sqlite\", \"mysql\"]\n+default = [\"duckdb\", \"postgres\", \"sqlite\", \"mysql\", \"newdb\"]\n```\n\nNext, create the same feature in crates that implement a `newdb` connector or dataset:\n\n```toml\nnewdb = [\"runtime/newdb\", \"spicepod/newdb\", \"app/newdb\"]\n````\n\nInclude external dependencies optionally and with `dep:` prefix in `features`:\n\n```toml\nnewdb = [\n    \"dep:newdb-tokio\",\n    \"db_connection_pool/newdb\",\n    ...\n]\n```\n\nFinally, tag code and module imports with `#[cfg(feature = \"newdb\")]`.\nTo build `spiced` with only `newdb` and some other desired features:\n\n```\nSPICED_CUSTOM_FEATURES=\"newdb postgres\" make build-runtime\n```\n\nIdeally none or few unused code warnings should be emitted. If not, consider refactorings.\n\n\n**Thank You!** - Your contributions to open source, large or small, make projects like this possible. Thank you for taking the time to contribute.\n"

[Learn More](https://docs.spiceai.org/features/federated-queries).\n- **Data Materialization and Acceleration**: Materialize, accelerate, and cache database queries. [Read the MaterializedView interview - Building a CDN for Databases](https://materializedview.io/p/building-a-cdn-for-databases-spice-ai)\n- **AI apps and agents**: An AI-database powering retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and intelligent agents. [Learn More](https://github.com/spiceai/cookbook/tree/trunk/rag#readme).\n\nIf you want to build with DataFusion or using DuckDB, Spice provides a simple, flexible, and production-ready engine you can just use.\n\n📣 Read the [Spice.ai OSS announcement blog post](https://blog.spiceai.org/posts/2024/03/28/adding-spice-the-next-generation-of-spice.ai-oss/).\n\nSpice is built-on industry leading technologies including [Apache DataFusion](https://datafusion.apache.org), Apache Arrow, Arrow Flight, SQLite, and DuckDB.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <picture>\n    <img width=\"600\" alt=\"How Spice works.\" src=\"https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai/assets/80174/7d93ae32-d6d8-437b-88d3-d64fe089e4b7\" />\n  </picture>\n</div>\n\n🎥 [Watch the CMU Databases Accelerating Data and AI with Spice.ai Open-Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyM-ec1lKfU)\n\n## Why Spice?\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <picture>\n    <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai/assets/80174/96b5fcef-a550-4ce8-a74a-83931275e83e\">\n    <img width=\"800\" alt=\"Spice.ai\" src=\"https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai/assets/80174/29e4421d-8942-4f2a-8397-e9d4fdeda36b\" />\n  </picture>\n</div>\n\nSpice simplifies building data-driven AI applications and agents by making it fast and easy to query, federate, and accelerate data from one or more sources using SQL, while grounding AI in real-time, reliable data. Co-locate datasets with apps and AI models to power AI feedback loops, enable RAG and search, and deliver fast, low-latency data-query and AI-inference with full control over cost and performance.\n\n### How is Spice different?\n\n1. **AI-Native Runtime**: Spice combines data query and AI inference in a single engine, for data-grounded AI and accurate AI.\n\n2. **Application-Focused**: Designed to run distributed at the application and agent level, often as a 1:1 or 1:N mapping between app and Spice instance, unlike traditional data systems built for many apps on one centralized database. It’s common to spin up multiple Spice instances—even one per tenant or customer.\n\n3. **Dual-Engine Acceleration**: Supports both **OLAP** (Arrow/DuckDB) and **OLTP** (SQLite/PostgreSQL) engines at the dataset level, providing flexible performance across analytical and transactional workloads.\n\n4. **Disaggregated Storage**: Separation of compute from disaggregated storage, co-locating local, materialized working sets of data with applications, dashboards, or ML pipelines while accessing source data in its original storage.\n\n5. **Edge to Cloud Native**: Deploy as a standalone instance, Kubernetes sidecar, microservice, or cluster—across edge/POP, on-prem, and public clouds. Chain multiple Spice instances for tier-optimized, distributed deployments.\n\n## How does Spice compare?\n\n### Data Query and Analytics\n\n| Feature                          | **Spice**                              | Trino / Presto       | Dremio                | ClickHouse          | Materialize          |\n| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- |\n| **Primary Use-Case**             | Data & AI apps/agents                  | Big data analytics   | Interactive analytics | Real-time analytics | Real-time analytics  |\n| **Primary deployment model**     | Sidecar                                | Cluster              | Cluster               | Cluster             | Cluster              |\n| **Federated Query Support**      | ✅                                     | ✅                   | ✅                    | ―                   | ―                    |\n| **Acceleration/Materialization** | ✅ (Arrow, SQLite, DuckDB, PostgreSQL) | Intermediate storage | Reflections (Iceberg) | Materialized views  | ✅ (Real-time views) |\n| **Catalog Support**              | ✅ (Iceberg, Unity Catalog)            | ✅                   | ✅                    | ―                   | ―                    |\n| **Query Result Caching**         | ✅                                     | ✅                   | ✅                    | ✅                  | Limited              |\n| **Multi-Modal Acceleration**     | ✅ (OLAP + OLTP)                       | ―                    | ―                     | ―                   | ―                    |\n| **Change Data Capture (CDC)**    | ✅ (Debezium)                          | ―                    | ―                     | ―                   | ✅ (Debezium)        |\n\n### AI Apps and Agents\n\n| Feature                       | **Spice**                            | LangChain          | LlamaIndex | AgentOps.ai      | Ollama                        |\n| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------ | ---------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------- |\n| **Primary Use-Case**          | Data & AI apps                       | Agentic workflows  | RAG apps   | Agent operations | LLM apps                      |\n| **Programming Language**      | Any language (HTTP interface)        | JavaScript, Python | Python     | Python           | Any language (HTTP interface) |\n| **Unified Data + AI Runtime** | ✅                                   | ―                  | ―          | ―                | ―                             |\n| **Federated Data Query**      | ✅                                   | ―                  | ―          | ―                | ―                             |\n| **Accelerated Data Access**   | ✅                                   | ―                  | ―          | ―                | ―                             |\n| **Tools/Functions**           | ✅                                   | ✅                 | ✅         | Limited          | Limited                       |\n| **LLM Memory**                | ✅                                   | ✅                 | ―          | ✅               | ―                             |\n| **Evaluations (Evals)**       | ✅                                   | Limited            | ―          | Limited          | ―                             |\n| **Search**                    | ✅ (VSS)                             | ✅                 | ✅         | Limited          | Limited                       |\n| **Caching**                   | ✅ (Query and results caching)       | Limited            | ―          | ―                | ―                             |\n| **Embeddings**                | ✅ (Built-in & pluggable models/DBs) | ✅                 | ✅         | Limited          | ―                             |\n\n✅ = Fully supported  \n❌ = Not supported  \nLimited = Partial or restricted support\n\n## Example Use-Cases\n\n### Data-grounded Agentic AI Applications\n\n- **OpenAI-compatible API**: Connect to hosted models (OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI) or deploy locally (Llama, NVIDIA NIM).

A cache would fetch data on a cache-miss while Spice prefetches and materializes filtered data on an interval, trigger, or as data changes using CDC. In addition to acceleration Spice supports [results caching](https://docs.spiceai.org/features/caching).\n\n- **Is Spice a CDN for databases?** Yes, a common use-case for Spice is as a CDN for different data sources. Using CDN concepts, Spice enables you to ship (load) a working set of your database (or data lake, or data warehouse) where it's most frequently accessed, like from a data-intensive application or for AI context.\n\n### Watch a 30-sec BI dashboard acceleration demo\n\n<https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai/assets/80174/7735ee94-3f4a-4983-a98e-fe766e79e03a>\n\nSee more demos on

Find it at [https://github.com/spiceai/cookbook](https://github.com/spiceai/cookbook#readme).\n\n### Using Spice.ai Cloud Platform\n\nAccess ready-to-use Spicepods and datasets hosted on the Spice.ai Cloud Platform using the Spice runtime. A list of public Spicepods is available on Spicerack: [https://spicerack.org/](https://spicerack.org/).\n\nTo use public datasets, create a free account on Spice.ai:\n\n1. Visit [spice.ai](https://spice.ai/) and click **Try for Free**.  \n   ![Try for Free](https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai/assets/112157037/27fb47ed-4825-4fa8-94bd-48197406cfaa)\n\n2. After creating an account, create an app to generate an API key.  \n   ![Create App](https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai/assets/112157037/d2446406-1f06-40fb-8373-1b6d692cb5f7)\n\nOnce set up, you can access ready-to-use Spicepods including datasets. For this demonstration, use the `taxi_trips` dataset from the [Spice.ai Quickstart](https://spice.ai/spiceai/quickstart).\n\n**Step 1.** Initialize a new project.\n\n```bash\n# Initialize a new Spice app\nspice init spice_app\n\n# Change to app directory\ncd spice_app\n```\n\n**Step 2.** Log in and authenticate from the command line using the `spice login` command. A pop up browser window will prompt you to authenticate:\n\n```bash\nspice login\n```\n\n**Step 3.** Start the runtime:\n\n```bash\n# Start the runtime\nspice run\n```\n\n**Step 4.** Configure the dataset:\n\nIn a new terminal window, configure a new dataset using the `spice dataset configure` command:\n\n```bash\nspice dataset configure\n```\n\nEnter a dataset name that will be used to reference the dataset in queries. This name does not need to match the name in the dataset source.\n\n```bash\ndataset name: (spice_app) taxi_trips\n```\n\nEnter the description of the dataset:\n\n```bash\ndescription: Taxi trips dataset\n```\n\nEnter the location of the dataset:\n\n```bash\nfrom: spice.ai/spiceai/quickstart/datasets/taxi_trips\n```\n\nSelect `y` when prompted whether to accelerate the data:\n\n```bash\nLocally accelerate (y/n)? y\n```\n\nYou should see the following output from your runtime terminal:\n\n```bash\n2024-12-16T05:12:45.803694Z  INFO runtime::init::dataset: Dataset taxi_trips registered (spice.ai/spiceai/quickstart/datasets/taxi_trips), acceleration (arrow, 10s refresh), results cache enabled.\n2024-12-16T05:12:45.805494Z  INFO runtime::accelerated_table::refresh_task: Loading data for dataset taxi_trips\n2024-12-16T05:13:24.218345Z  INFO runtime::accelerated_table::refresh_task: Loaded 2,964,624 rows (8.41 GiB) for dataset taxi_trips in 38s 412ms.\n```\n\n**Step 5.** In a new terminal window, use the Spice SQL REPL to query the dataset\n\n```bash\nspice sql\n```\n\n```bash\nSELECT tpep_pickup_datetime, passenger_count, trip_distance from taxi_trips LIMIT 10;\n```\n\nThe output displays the results of the query along with the query execution time:\n\n```bash\n+----------------------+-----------------+---------------+\n| tpep_pickup_datetime | passenger_count | trip_distance |\n+----------------------+-----------------+---------------+\n| 2024-01-11T12:55:12  | 1               | 0.0           |\n| 2024-01-11T12:55:12  | 1               | 0.0           |\n| 2024-01-11T12:04:56  | 1               | 0.63          |\n| 2024-01-11T12:18:31  | 1               | 1.38          |\n| 2024-01-11T12:39:26  | 1               | 1.01          |\n| 2024-01-11T12:18:58  | 1               | 5.13          |\n| 2024-01-11T12:43:13  | 1               | 2.9           |\n| 2024-01-11T12:05:41  | 1               | 1.36          |\n| 2024-01-11T12:20:41  | 1               | 1.11          |\n| 2024-01-11T12:37:25  | 1               | 2.04          |\n+----------------------+-----------------+---------------+\n\nTime: 0.00538925 seconds. 10 rows.\n```\n\nYou can experiment with the time it takes to generate queries when using non-accelerated datasets. You can change the acceleration setting from `true` to `false` in the datasets.yaml file.\n\n### 📄 Documentation\n\nComprehensive documentation is available at [docs.spiceai.org](https://docs.spiceai.org/).\n\nOver 45 quickstarts and samples available in the [Spice Cookbook](https://github.com/spiceai/cookbook#spiceai-oss-cookbook).\n\n### 🔌 Extensibility\n\nSpice.ai is designed to be extensible with extension points documented at [EXTENSIBILITY.md](./docs/EXTENSIBILITY.md).
