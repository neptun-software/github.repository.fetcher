You *will* get linker errors if you don't use the toolchain file.\n\n## VSCode\nIf you intend to run and debug tests in VSCode, you may want to create a symlink from `<souce>/.cargo/config.toml`\nto `<build>/.cargo/config.toml`.\n\n# Build\n```\ncd build\nmake <target>\n```\n\n# Test\n```\nmake check\n```\nYou can also execute specific tests via `ctest -V -R <test name regex>`.  To get the list of tests run `ctest -N`.\n- adapter:<debuggee target> - tests core debug adapter functionality using a debuggee built for the specified target\n  (e.g., on Windows, either x86_64-pc-windows-gnu or x86_64-pc-windows-msvc).\n- `cargo_test` - execute cargo tests in all crates.\n- `dependencies:<binary>` - check that the binary does not have dylib dependencies outside of the allowed set (for portability).\n\n## Running tests under debugger\n- Launch codelldb under the debugger with `--multi-session --port=4711`.\n- Run tests with the following environment variable set: `LLDB_SERVER=4711`.  For example: `LLDB_SERVER=4711 make check`.\n\n## Useful targets:\n- `dev_debugging` - build extension, adapter, debuggee and other stuff needed for debugging extension directly out of\n   the build directory. After building this target you can run `code --extensionDevelopmentPath=${workspaceFolder}/build`\n   to try out the extension.\n- `adapter` - build the debug adapter.\n- `extension` - build VSCode extension.\n- `debuggee` - build debuggee subproject (used for testing).\n- `tests` - build extension tests.\n- `check` - run all tests.\n- `vsix_bootstrap` - build VSIX package containing only the VSCode extension.\n- `vsix_full` - build VSIX package including all required native binaries (for the current platform).\n- `xclean` - extra-thorough cleaning.  Useful in cases of build problems caused by stale dependencies.\n"

          "content": "# Release Notes\n\n# 1.11.1\n\n### New\n- Updated embedded Python to v3.12.\n- Added support for [Step Into Targets](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_46#_step-into-targets).\n  When debugging statements such as `foo(bar(), baz())`, this allows stepping directly into `foo`, bypassing `bar` and `baz`.\n- Added support for the `restart` request: This enables restarting the debuggee without ending the current session,\n  making restarts faster by reusing the same debug adapter instance and cached debug info from the debuggee binary.<br>\n  Note that, because the session is retained, the **exitCommands** sequence will not run before terminating the old instance\n  of the debuggee. To address this, a new **preTerminateCommands** sequence has been added.\n  Additionally, **initCommands** will not be re-executed, while **preRunCommands** and **postRunCommands** will be.\n- Added \"cwd\" attribute to Cargo configuration.\n- Add `--color=always` when running Cargo.\n\n### Fixed\n- #1113: Disassembly does not show until call stack is clicked\n- #1126: Highlight the current hit breakpoint\n- Restored compatibility with liblldb v17\n\n# 1.11.0\n\n### New\n- Updated bundled LLDB to v19.1.0.\n- The Python module implementing the CodeLLDB Python API is now called `codelldb` (aliased to `debugger` for backward\n  compatibility).\n- Python scripts running in the context of CodeLLDB can now read workspace configuration settings stored under\n  the `lldb.script` namespace via `codelldb.get_config()`.\n\n### Changed\n- To reduce the maintenance burden, support for the Rust language service and custom data formatters in CodeLLDB has\n  been removed. The constant breaking changes in LLDB's language service API, along with Rust's evolving internal\n  representation of `std::` types, have made it increasingly difficult to maintain these updates. Future versions of\n  CodeLLDB will be based on stock LLDB, without the Rust language service. Rust data types will still have partial\n  support via the data formatters provided by `rustc`, but custom formatters will no longer be maintained.\n\n# 1.10.0\n\n## New\n- Updated bundled LLDB to v17.0.0\n\n## Fixed\n- #954: VSCode call stack doesn't work when instruction pointer is invalid\n- #958: Excluded Callers feature not working in Dev Container\n- #853: Display Whole String in Debug Console\n- #980: Global variables are miscategorized as static\n\n# 1.9.2\n\n## New\n- Implemented [Excluded Callers](MANUAL.md#excluded-callers) feature, similar to the\n  [one in Javascript debugger](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_64#_javascript-debugging).\n- Added [create_webview()](MANUAL.md#webview) Python API, which allows scripts to create and manipulate VSCode Webviews.\n  This function supersedes functionality of the older `display_html` API.\n- Enabled conditions on exception breakpoints.\n\n# 1.9.1\n\n## New\n- Implemented support for [envFile](https://github.com/vadimcn/codelldb/issues/866).\n- Added `breakpointMode` setting: when this is set to `file`, breakpoints will be resolved using file name only, which\n  is similar to how `breakpoint set -f <filename> -l <line>` command works in CLI LLDB.  This relieves the need\n  of setting up `sourceMap`; however, this is at the expense of potentially hitting unexpectd breakpoints\n  if there is more than one source file of the same name in the project.\n- `targetCreateCommands` and `processCreateCommands` are now allowed in for `launch` and `attach` requests.  When\n  specified, these command sequences over-ride the default logic for target and process creation.\n\n## Fixed\n- #761: Error: there is no registered task type 'codelldb.cargo'\n- #776: Error: there is no registered task type 'codelldb.cargo'\n- #891: Incorrect matcher\n- #904: Cannot see VecDeque values in \"Variables\" panel after insert\n- #911: Vec in sidebar shows wrong (old) value- #920: Rust: local variables not updated during debugging\n- #915: Pick(My)Process not working\n\n# 1.9.0\n\n## New\n- Updated bundled LLDB to v16.0.0\n- It is now possible to combine number format specifiers (`foo,x`) and \"reinterpret as array\" speficiers (`foo,[10]`)\n  together: `foo,x[10]` (Feature request #851).\n- Added support for native VSCode [disassmbly view](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/visual-studio-code-c-july-2021-update-disassembly-view-macro-expansion-and-windows-arm64-debugging/#disassembly-view) (thanks @puremourning!).\n\n## Fixed\n- #813: Mixed GAS/Intel syntax in disassembly view.\n- #842: Syntax error in conditional breakpoint.\n- #840: Make the whole command string readable in the \"Select a process\" dropdown window.\n\n# 1.8.1\n\n## Fixed\n- #777: Json parsing error when debugging rust\n\n# 1.8.0\n\n## New\n- Updated LLDB to 15.0.0\n- Added experimental `split` option to the [`consoleMode`](MANUAL.md#general) config setting.  In this mode the debug console\n  will be used for evaluation of expressions and a separate terminal will be created for input of LLDB commands.\n\n## Changed\n- [\"Simple\" expressions](MANUAL.md#simple-expressions)\" now use a proper parser, which should make syntax error messages less confusing.\n- `${`...`}`-delimited expressions embedded in Simple and Python expressions now may conatin full Native expressions,\nnot just variable names, which the case previously.\n- The `show_debug_info` [command](MANUAL.md#debugger-commands) has been renamed to `debug_info`, with sub-commands `list` and `show`.\n\n# 1.7.4\n\n## Fixed\n- #745: Bug: didn't catch panics in Rust code\n\n# 1.7.3\n\n## Fixed\n- #734: Cargo task hangs.\n- #738: Cargo artifacts are not filtered.\n\n# 1.7.2\n\n## Fixed\n- #731: Crash on debug session startup.\n\n# 1.7.1\n\n## Changed\n- Renamed `debug_info` command to `show_debug_info`.\n\n## New\n- Cargo is now executed as a task, which allows applying problem matchers to its output.\n- Added `lldb.cargo` configuration setting to allow overriding command invoked as Cargo.\n- Added `cargo.env` attribute in launch configs to allow passing custom environment variables to Cargo.\n- Added \"View Memory\" command, which allows viewing raw memory at an arbitrary address.\n- Added \"Search Symbols\" command, which allows searching target's symbols.\n- Initialize LLDB's `target.process.thread.step-avoid-regexp` setting for Rust programs, to avoid stepping into Rust std library.\n\n## Fixed\n- #647: Cannot display Python string containing non-ASCII characters.\n- #718: Large containers take too long to display.\n- #726: Cannot display Rust String's and Vec's (due to data layout change in std).\n\n# 1.7.0\n\n## Changed\n- CodeLLDB configuration settings are now split into three groups: basic, advanced, and launch configuration defaults.\n\n## New\n- Updated LLDB to 14.0.0\n- Added support for VSCode [memory viewer](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_64#_viewing-and-editing-binary-data).\n- Added UI for [console mode](MANUAL.md#debug-console) switching.\n\n## Fixed\n- #584: Rust - With Simple Function, LLDB Debugger variables duplicated and random?\n- #633: Rust now emits with a new PDB language identifier, breaking debugging on Windows\n\n# 1.6.10\n\n## Fixed\n- #568: Viewing a struct with union:s in C++ doesn't show all the member variables\n- #573: Installing package flags \"Unauthorized\"\n\n# 1.6.9\n\n## Fixed\n- #465: Incompatibility with arm64 macOS Monterey.\n\n# 1.6.8\n\n## Changed\n- Okay, LLDB 12.0.1 seems too broken.  Restored it to v13.0.0.\n\n## Fixed\n- #527: Breakpoints no longer triggering in library when using version 1.6.7\n- #540: Rust printing of enums not working [for -windows-msvc targets]\n- #337: Visualizing Vec<(f32,f32)> is showing as pointer\n\n# 1.6.7\n\n## Changed\n- Rolled the bundled LLDB back to v12, because crash reports started coming from users after upgrade to v13.\n\n## New\n- Added support for inline breakpoints.\n- Added support for LLDB [reproducers](https://lldb.llvm.org/design/reproducers.html).\n\n## Fixed\n- Bug #512: External terminal no longer works since updating to v1.6.6\n- Bug #519: Attaching to remote process using debugserver on Mac/iOS is not working.\n- Bug #522: Conditional breakpoints don't trigger when empty logMessage is supplied.\n\n# 1.6.6\n\n## New\n- Updated LLDB to 13.0.0\n- Added [`debug_info`](MANUAL.md#debugger-commands) LLDB command, that makes it easier to determine which modules have debug info available.\n\n## Fixed\n- Bug #474: image dump sections causes the plugin to hang\n- Bug #480: Panic: 'assertion failed: addr.is_valid()'\n\n# 1.6.5\n\n## Fixed\n- Bug #327: Enums are not correctly displayed on MacOS.\n- Bug #451: Debug Console doesn't work with version 1.6.4 on Windows.\n- Bug #454: readMemory request does not accept negative offset.\n\n## New\n- Rust windows-msvc binaries built using nightly-2021-06-05 or later compiler will have their enums displayed correctly 🎉.  (This will be in stable rustc 1.54)\n- Upon completing a request, the [RPC server](MANUAL.md#rpc-server) will now respond with a status message.\n\n# 1.6.4\n\n## Fixed\n- Bug #411: Cannot launch and connect to debugserver on Mac\n- Bug #412: std::collectionHashMap/Set are not displayed (on x86_64-pc-windows-msvc)\n- Bug #435: debug session exited unexpectedly\n- Bug #438: Supply memoryReference for variables\n- Bug #439: Debug session fails if I \"watch\" for a certain expression\n- Bug #440: Nicer watch window messages with \"native\" expressions\n- Bug #442: Rust std::collection::HashMap has no pretty printing\n\n# 1.6.3\n\n## Fixed\n- Bug #424: 1.6.2 failure stopping at breakpoints\n- Bug #428: Debugger fails to start (Fresh install / macOS 10.13)\n\n# 1.6.2\n\n## Fixed\n- Bug #417: Loaded modules not shown.\n- Fixed visualizers for Rust 1.48+ hashmaps.\n\n## New\n- Added support for Apple Silicon.\n- The bundled LLDB is now compiled with support for X86, ARM, AVR, RISCV, MSP430 and WebAssembly architectures.\n- Added [RPC server](MANUAL.md#rpc-server) for \"external\" launching.\n- Implemented new data watchpoint options (read vs write vs read/write).\n\n# 1.6.1\n\n## Fixed\n- Bug #395 - Size and content of std::vector is not adjusted correctly after push_back.\n- Bug #394 - Debug adapter crash when hit breakpoint.\n\n## New\n- Added \"LLDB Command Prompt\" command, which opens LLDB command prompt in a terminal.  This is mainly intended for\n  managing installed Python packages (via the `pip` command).\n- Added `\"lldb.evaluateForHovers\"` configuration setting, which allows to disable expression evaluation for mouse hovers.\n  This is intended to mitigate problems similar to the one described in #353, triggered by auto-evaluation of expressions.\n- Added `\"lldb.commandCompletions\"` configuration setting, which allows to disable command completions in the debug console.\n  Similarly to the previous one, this is for mitigation of LLDB crashes triggered by completions.\n\n# 1.6.0\n\n## Changed\n- I've decided to stop trying to use external Python installations with CodeLLDB.  Bugs keep coming in, and it seems\n  that the diversity of Python variants out there is just too big.<br>\n  As of this version, a minimal Python installation will be bundled with CodeLLDB (courtesy of PyOxidizer project!), so\n  users won't have to worry about installing it separately.\n- The bundled LLDB is now based on version 11.0.   This fixes a number of problems in parsing C++ debug info, including\n  returning wrong template parameters for some types and crashes during expression evaluation.\n- Due to problems it causes for some shells, the terminal prompt clearing feature will now be disabled by default.\n  Those who wish to keep using it, can re-enable it by adding `\"lldb.terminalPromptClear\": [\"\\n\"]` to their\n  user/workspace configuration files.\n- Added Objective C++ and Zig to the list of supported languages.\n\n## Fixed\n- Source file paths on Windows will now follow casing of the file system.  This should fix a number of issues where\n  VSCode would not display the current execution location in the editor.\n- Updated Rust HashMap/HashSet formatter to account for the recent memory layout change.\n\n# 1.5.3\n\n## Fixed\n- Bugs #312, #318: In v1.5.2 a new method of clearing the terminal prompt had been introduced; unfortunately, it seems\nto have caused problems for some shells (fish, zsh).  This should be resolved now.  If you still experience problems,\nyou can use the newly added `lldb.terminalPromptClear` setting to override string sequence used to clear the prompt,\nor to disable prompt clearing altogether.\n\n## New\n- Added `lldb.terminalPromptClear` setting.\n\n# 1.5.2\n\n## Fixed\n- Bug #276: Running lldb python scripts only outputs to OUTPUT(lldb) tab.\n- Bug #286: \"Run Without Debugging\" doesn't wait for process to finish.\n- Bug #297: Breakpoints disappear when debug symbols have relative path outside ${workspaceFolder}, or paths that need mapping.\n- Fixed compatibility with Eclipse Theia IDE (thanks @dschafhauser!)\n\n## Changed\n- Updated bundled LLDB to v10.0.1\n\n## New\n- Added '/cmd ' prefix (in addition to backtick) for executing lldb commands when debug console is set to `evaluate` mode.\n\n# 1.5.1\n\n## Fixed\n- Bug 270: CodeLLDB requires too new liblzma on OSX\n\n# 1.5.0\n\n## Fixed\n- Bug #252: Cannot Attach: Could not send event to DebugSession: \"Full(..)\"\n- Bug #253: Rust conditional breakpoints: `usize` is a string?\n- Debugging inside docker containers should work now.\n\n## Changed\n- Removed \"classic\" adapter.\n- Improved platform package validation after download.\n\n# 1.4.5\n\n## Fixed\n- Improved compatibility with Anaconda Python on Windows.\n- Fixed parsing of Python versions involving beta releases.\n\n## Other\n- [Version 5.3](https://github.com/mozilla/rr/releases/tag/5.3.0) of Mozilla's [rr](https://rr-project.org/) has been released a few days ago.  It seems to work pretty well with CodeLLDB's [reverse debugging](MANUAL.md#reverse-debugging) support.\n- This is likely to be the last version supporting \"classic\" adapter.\n\n# 1.4.4\n\n## Fixed\n- Bug #238: Unable use attach snippet\n\n# 1.4.3\n\n## Fixed\n- Bug #231: v1.4.1 freezes program\n\n# 1.4.2\n\n## Fixed\n- Bug #229: Cargo invocation has failed: Error: spawn ENOMEM\n\n# 1.4.1\n\n## Fixed\n- Bug #221: No-debug launch mode doesn't work.\n- Fixed \"reinterpret as array\" format specifier (var,[length]).\n\n## New\n- Rust visualizers now support `HashMap` and `HashSet`.\n- The `.../command` [URL handler](MANUAL.md#starting-debug-session-outside-of-vscode) now supports setting debuggee environment variables.\n- Added support for armv7 platform (Raspberry Pi, etc).\n\n# 1.4.0\n\n## Changed\n- In preparation for [Python 2 fading into the sunset](https://pythonclock.org/), all supported platforms now require Python 3.3 or later.\n\n## New\n- Added support for [data breakpoints](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_38#_breaking-when-value-changes-data-breakpoints).\n- Added \"Attach to Process...\" command for quick attaching without having to create a debug configuration.\n- Added URL handler for [starting a debug session from outside of VSCode](MANUAL.md#starting-debug-session-outside-of-vscode).<br>\n  Rust users: please take note - I believe this may provide a more convenient way of debugging the unit tests.\n\n# 1.3.0\n\n## Fixed\n- Redirection to the integrated terminal now works on Windows too.\n\n## Changed\n- [Native adapter](#heads-up-codelldb-is-moving-to-native-code) is now the default.  You can still use 'classic' or 'bundle' by setting the `lldb.adapterType` configuration option.\n- \"integrated\" is now the default value for the \"terminal\" launch config property.\n\n## New\n- Loaded modules viewlet: rather than printing loaded modules notifications in the Debug Console view, modules are now displayed in a separate tab in the Debug view.\n- `lldb.consoleMode` setting, which controls whether the debug console input is by default treated as debugger commands or as expressions to evaluate.\n- Added support for [Jump to to cursor](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_36#_jump-to-cursor) command (thanks @ntoskrnl7!).\n\n# 1.2.3\n\n## New\n- New UI for display settings (status bar and \"Display Options...\" command).\n- Added support for configurable external LLDB backends (native adapter only).\n\n## Changed\n- Updated bundled LLDB to v8.0 final.\n\n## Fixed\n- Bug #173 - Debugger module is not auto-imported when native adapter is used.\n- Native adapter panics in rare cases when formatting Python tracebacks.\n\n# 1.2.2\n\n### Fixed\n- Debug configuration generation from Cargo.toml when using recent Cargo versions.\n\n### Fixed (native adapter only)\n- LLDB command completions inserting duplicate tokens in some cases.\n- Remote debugging when using QEMU debug stub.\n- Spurious stop events at the beginning of a debug session.\n\n### New (native adapter only)\n- Implemented hit conditions on breakpoints.\n- More informative error messages when displaying optimized-out variables, invalid pointers, etc.\n- Announce executed scripts (e.g. initCommands, preRunCommands), for easier attribution of script errors.\n- Support \",[\\<number\\>]\" format specifier, which reinterprets the displayed value as an array of \\<number\\> elements.\n\n### Heads up: CodeLLDB is moving to native code.\n\nUp until now, CodeLLDB's debug adapter has been based on whatever version of the LLDB was installed on the local machine,\nwith Python scripts providing the glue between LLDB API and VS Code. This arrangement has its benefits:\nthe extension can be very compact and platform-independent. The flip side of using an externally-provided LLDB, is that it may\nhappen to be quite old and buggy.  There had been quite a few problems reported because of that.  I've also been somewhat\ndissatisfied with CodeLLDB's performance and stability, which I attribute to the use of Python in a project that has\nlong grown past being \"just a simple script\".<br>\n\nAs a consequence, I've decided to try a new approach:\n- Pre-built LLDB binaries will be provided with the extension. This will ensure that it is used with the same\nversion of LLDB engine as it was tested with. (In order to reduce the download size, native binaries will not be included\nin the initial installation package published on VS Code Marketplace.  Instead, a smaller, platform-targeted package will\nbe downloaded on first use.)\n- Most of Python code had been ported to a statically-typed compiled language (Rust).\n\nFor now, both implementations of the debug adapter will exist in parallel.\nYou can choose which one is used by setting `lldb.adapterType` to either `classic` or `native` in your workspace settings.\nIn a few versions, I plan to make `native` the default, and then, eventually, the only option.\n\nPlease give the `native` adapter a try and let me know how that worked for you, and, especially, if it didn't.  Thanks!\n\n# 1.2.1\n\n### Changed\n- The minimum supported VSCode version is now 1.30.\n\n### Fixed\n- Source maps.\n- Python detection on Windows.\n- Debug adapter process is sometimes left running after the end of a debug session.\n- Adjusted Rust visualizer for libstd changes in v1.33.\n\n# 1.2.0\n\n### New\n- [Beta] Introduced \"bundled\" and \"native\" debug adapter types (in addition to \"classic\"): if `lldb.adapterType` confguration\nsetting is set to either of those values, CodeLLDB will download and use a custom build of LLDB and use it instead of the\nsystem-provided one.\n\n### Fixed\n- Misc bug fixes.\n\n# 1.1.0\n- The minimum supported VSCode version is now 1.23.\n- Due to deprecation of VSCode's `previewHtml` command, the signature of `display_html` API had to change: HTML markup\nmust now be provided in the first parameter; lazy content generation via `register_content_provider` is no longer supported.\n- Bug fixes.\n\n# 1.0.0\n- The pace of changes has been slowing down as of late, I think this is about time to declare a v1.0!\n- Added Rust visualizers for Box, Rc, Arc, Mutex, Cell, RefCell.\n- Bug fixes.\n\n# 0.8.9\n- Bug fixes.\n\n# 0.8.8\n- Added [`postRunCommands`](MANUAL.md#launching).\n- Bug fixes.\n\n# 0.8.7\n- CodeLLDB will now attempt to auto-generate summaries for compound objects, for which there is no built-in support.\n  Previously, it would fall back to displaying object's type instead.\n- Fixed breakpoint resolution when dynamically-loaded modules are used.\n\n# 0.8.6\n- Filter out build scripts when looking parsing Cargo output.\n- New substitution variable for launch configs: `${cargo:program}`.\n- Bug fixes.\n\n# 0.8.5\n- Added support for [Cargo projects](MANUAL.md#cargo-support).\n- Added support for [logpoints](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_22#_logpoints).\n- Added `waitFor` property for \"attach\" configurations - to wait for the process to launch.\n- Custom launch configuration changes (the old ways still work, but marked deprecated):\n  - Use `{\"request\":\"custom\"}`, instead of `{\"request\":\"launch\", \"custom\":true}`.\n  - Renamed `initCommands` and `preRunCommands` to\n  `targetCreateCommands` and `processCreateCommands` respectively, to clarify what they do.\n- `sourceLanguages` can once again be specified at the launch configuration level.  Workspace-level configuration\n is still possible via `lldb.sourceLanguages`.\n\n# 0.8.2\n- Fixed startup bug on Windows.\n\n# 0.8.1\n- Added `expressions` ∈ { `simple`, `python`, `native` } launch configuration property, which selects the default\n  [expression evaluator type](MANUAL.md#expressions).\n- Exception breakpoints are now language specific: \"on throw\" and \"on catch\" for C++, \"on panic\" for Rust.<br>\n  In order to implement this, the \"sourceLanguages\" setting had to be moved to [workspace configuration](#workspace-configuration) level.\n- Fixed watch panel bug, which, in rare circumstances, could cause display of incorrect evaluation results.\n\n# 0.8.0\n- Added [Parameterized Launch Configurations](MANUAL.md#parameterized-launch-configurations).\n- Display settings such as disassembly display, default variable formats, will now be persisted across debug sessions.\n- New command to toggle pointer address display setting.\n- Fixed order of precedence when merging of lldb.launch... properties across multiple levels of settings.\n- CodeLLDB will now pause execution upon debuggee crash (instead of terminating the debug session).\n\n# 0.7.5\n- Fixed LLDB detection on OSX and Windows.\n\n# 0.7.4\n- It is now possible to set [default values for launch configurations](MANUAL.md#workspace-configuration) per-workspace.\n- The debugger will now suppress source location information if the source files does not exist on local machine (after mapping paths through `sourceMap`).\nThis behavior may be altered via `lldb.suppressMissingSourceFiles` configuration setting.\n- Bug fixes.\n\n# 0.7.3\n- Bug fixes.\n\n# 0.7.2\n- Bug fixes.\n\n# 0.7.1\n- Bug fixes.\n\n# 0.7.0\n- The minimum supported VSCode version is now 1.17.\n- Source maps may now contain glob wildcards.\n- Source maps may now be used to suppress source location info (by setting \"target\" prefix to null).\n- Complex variable names (e.g. statics in templated classes) may now be escaped in expressions as `${...}`.\n- Breakpoints set or deleted via Debug Console commands will now be reflected in VSCode UI.\n\n# 0.6.2\n- Bug fixes.\n\n# 0.6.1\n- Bug fixes.\n\n# 0.6.0\n- The minimum supported VSCode version is now 1.15.\n- Process state will now be updated after custom launch.\n- Fixed threads display regression.\n- Fixed \"Add to Watch\" regression.\n- Experimental support for reverse-debugging via gdb-server or rr.\n\n# 0.5.5\n- Fixed Unicode handling.\n\n# 0.5.4\n- Fixed some bugs on Windows.\n\n# 0.5.3\n- Fixed fallout from VSCode 1.14 changes.\n- Fixed Rust formatters after the move of String and Vec into alloc crate.\n\n# 0.5.2\n- Changed how LLDB is launched.  This should automatically fix compatibility issues with Brew Python\n  and in general provide better messages when LLDB fails.\n- Added 'LLDB: Run diagnostics' command for troubleshooting.\n\n# 0.5.1\n- Show pointee's summary rather than its address for pointers and references in \"default\" formatting\nmode.  The address may still be seen when a display format override is specified, e.g. `pointer,x`.\n- Bug fixes.\n\n# 0.5.0\n- The minimum supported VSCode version is now 1.11.\n- Rust visualizers are now activated automatically (no need for `sourceLanguages: [\"rust\"]`).\n- Added [data visualization](https://github.com/vadimcn/codelldb/wiki/Data-visualization) tutorial.\n- Bug fixes.\n\n# 0.4.1\n- Bug fixes.\n\n# 0.4.0\n- The minimum supported VSCode version is now 1.9.\n- Added debugger API for HTML display.\n- @keyword is no longer allowed in \"simple\" expressions, the '/py ...' syntax replaces that.\n- Changed prefix for invoking native evaluator: `?<expr>` -> `/nat <expr>`\n- Changed prefix for regex breakpoints: `/` -> `/re `.\n- Fixed bugs #18, #19.\n\n# 0.3.4\n- Bug fixes.\n\n# 0.3.3\n- [Custom launch requests](MANUAL.md#custom-launch).\n- Command completions in debug console.\n- Windows LLDB is now supported!\n- Debugger stdout is now piped to debug console.\n- Fixed bug #13 (breakpoints in headers).\n\n# 0.3.2\n- Added pickProcess and pickMyProcess commands to be used with the **pid** parameter when [attaching](README.md#attaching).\n- Added debug configuration snippets.\n- Added Swift debugging (thanks @jesspittman!).\n\n# 0.3.1\n- Bug fixes.\n\n# 0.3.0\n- [Variable visualizers for Rust](MANUAL.md#rust-language-support).\n- New [expression evaluator](MANUAL.md#expressions).\n- Bug fixes.\n\n# 0.2.2\n- Bug fixes.\n\n# 0.2.1\n- Added 'terminal' launch config option. '*' in stdio config now behaves identically to null.\n- Moved static variables out to their own scope.\n- Disassembly in symbolless locations should work now.\n- Resume debuggee after attach, unless stopOnEntry is true.\n\n# 0.2.0\n- Added [disassembly view](MANUAL.md#disassembly-view).\n- Added [variable formatting](MANUAL.md#formatting).\n\n# 0.1.3\n- Added support for setting variable values (primitive types only).\n- Added [regex breakpoints](MANUAL.md#regex-breakpoints).\n\n# 0.1.2\n- Infer `.exe` target extension on Windows.\n- `args` may now be a string.\n\n# 0.1.0\nFirst released version.\n"

Here's a minimal one:\n\n```javascript\n{\n    \"name\": \"Launch\",\n    \"type\": \"lldb\",\n    \"request\": \"launch\",\n    \"program\": \"${workspaceFolder}/<executable file>\",\n    \"args\": [\"-arg1\", \"-arg2\"],\n}\n```\n\n These attributes are common to all CodeLLDB launch configurations:\n\n|attribute                |type  |         |\n|-------------------------|------|---------|\n|**name**                 |string| *Required.* Launch configuration name, as you want it to appear in the Run and Debug panel.\n|**type**                 |string| *Required.* Set to `lldb`.\n|**request**              |string| *Required.* Session initiation method:<br><li>`launch` to [create a new process](#launching-a-new-process),<br><li>`attach` to [attach to an already running process](#attaching-to-a-running-process),<br><li>`custom` to [configure session \"manually\" using LLDB commands](#custom-launch).\n|**initCommands**         |[string]| LLDB commands executed upon debugger startup.\n|**targetCreateCommands**|[string]| LLDB commands executed to create debug target.\n|**preRunCommands**       |[string]| LLDB commands executed just before launching of attaching to the debuggee.\n|**processCreateCommands**|[string]| LLDB commands executed to create/attach the debuggee process.\n|**postRunCommands**      |[string]| LLDB commands executed just after launching or attaching to the debuggee.\n|**preTerminateCommands** |[string]| LLDB commands executed just before the debuggee is terminated or disconnected from.\n|**exitCommands**         |[string]| LLDB commands executed at the end of the debugging session.\n|**expressions**          |string| The default expression evaluator type: `simple`, `python` or `native`.  See [Expressions](#expressions).\n|**sourceMap**            |dictionary| See [Source Path Remapping](#source-path-remapping).\n|**relativePathBase**     |string | Base directory used for resolution of relative source paths.  Defaults to \"${workspaceFolder}\".\n|**breakpointMode**       |enum | Specifies how source breakpoints should be set:<br><li>`path` - Resolve locations using full source file path (default).<li>`file` - Resolve locations using file name only.  This option may be useful in lieu of configuring `sourceMap`, however, note that breakpoints will be set in all files of the same name in the project.  For example, Rust projects often have lots of files named \"mod.rs\".\n|**sourceLanguages**      |[string]| A list of source languages used in the program.  This is used to enable language-specific debugger features.\n|**reverseDebugging**     |bool   | Enable [reverse debugging](#reverse-debugging).\n\n\n\n## Launching a New Process\n\nThese attributes are applicable when the \"launch\" initiation method is selected:\n\n|attribute          |type|         |\n|-------------------|----|---------|\n|**program**        |string| Path of the executable file.  *Required*, unless using `cargo` attribute.\n|**cargo**          |string| See [Cargo support](#cargo-support).\n|**args**           |string &#10072; [string]| Command line parameters.  If this is a string, it will be split using shell-like syntax.\n|**cwd**            |string| Working directory.\n|**env**            |dictionary| Environment variables to set in addition to the ones inherited from the parent process environment (unless LLDB's `target.inherit-env` setting has been set to `false`, in which case the initial process environment is empty).  You may refer to existing environment variables using `${env:NAME}` syntax.  For example, in order to alter the inherited `PATH` variable, you can do this: `\"PATH\":\"${env:HOME}/bin:${env:PATH}\"`.\n|**envFile**        |string| Path of the file to read the environment variables from.  Note that `env` entries will override `envPath` entries.\n|**stdio**          |string &#10072; [string] &#10072; dictionary| See [Stdio Redirection](#stdio-redirection).\n|**terminal**       |string| Destination for debuggee's stdio streams: <ul><li>`console` for DEBUG CONSOLE</li><li>`integrated` (default) for VSCode integrated terminal</li><li>`external` for a new terminal window</li></ul>\n|**stopOnEntry**    |boolean| Whether to stop debuggee immediately after launching.\n\nOperations performed for launch:\n- The `initCommands` sequence is executed.\n- The [debug target object](https://lldb.llvm.org/python_api/lldb.SBTarget.html) is created:\n  - If `targetCreateCommands` attribute is present, this command sequence is executed.  The currently selected target\n    is assumed to have been created by these commands and will be associated with the current debugging session.\n  - Otherwise, target is created from the binary pointed to by the `program` attribute.\n- Target properties are configured using `args`, `env`, `cwd`, `stdio`, etc, configuration attributes.\n- Breakpoints are created.\n- The `preRunCommands` sequence is executed.  These commands may alter debug target configuration (e.g. args or env).\n- The debuggee process is created:\n  - If `processCreateCommands` attribute is present, this command sequence is executed. These are expected to have created\n    a process corresponding to the debug target.\n  - Otherwise the default process creation action is performed (equivalent to the `process launch` command).\n- The `postRunCommands` sequence is executed.\n- ...\n- At the end of the debugging session the `exitCommands` sequence is executed.\n\n### Stdio Redirection\nThe **stdio** property is a list of redirection targets for each of the debuggee's stdio streams:\n- `null` value will cause redirect to the default debug session terminal (as specified by the **terminal** launch property),\n- `\"/some/path\"` will cause the stream to be redirected to the specified file, pipe or a TTY device<sup>*</sup>,\n- if you provide less than 3 values, the list will be padded to 3 entries using the last provided value,\n- you may specify more than three values, in which case additional file descriptors will be created (4, 5, etc.)\n\nExamples:\n- `\"stdio\": [null, \"log.txt\", null]` - connect stdin and stderr to the default terminal, while sending\nstdout to \"log.txt\",\n- `\"stdio\": [\"input.txt\", \"log.txt\"]` - connect stdin to \"input.txt\", while sending both stdout and stderr to \"log.txt\",\n- `\"stdio\": null` - connect all three streams to the default terminal.\n\n<sup>*</sup> Run `tty` command in a terminal window to find out the TTY device name.\n\n## Attaching to a Running Process\n\nThese attributes are applicable when the \"attach\" initiation method is selected:\n\n|attribute          |type    |         |\n|-------------------|--------|---------|\n|**program**        |string  |Path of the executable file.\n|**pid**            |number  |Process id to attach to.  **pid** may be omitted, in which case debugger will attempt to locate an already running instance of the program. You may also use [`${command:pickProcess}` or `${command:pickMyProcess}`](#pick-process-command) here to choose process interactively.\n|**stopOnEntry**    |boolean |Whether to stop the debuggee immediately after attaching.\n|**waitFor**        |boolean |Wait for the process to launch.\n\nOperations performed for attach:\nFlow during the attach sequence:\n- The `initCommands` sequence is executed.\n- The [debug target object](https://lldb.llvm.org/python_api/lldb.SBTarget.html) is created:\n  - If `targetCreateCommands` attribute is present, this command sequence is executed.  The currently selected target\n    is assumed to have been created by these commands and will be associated with the current debugging session.\n  - Otherwise, target is created from the binary pointed to by the `program` attribute, if one exists.\n  - Otherwise, target is created from the process specified by `pid`.\n- Breakpoints are created.\n- The `preRunCommands` sequence is executed.  These commands may alter debug target configuration.\n- The debugger attaches to the specified process.\n  - If `processCreateCommands` attribute is present, this command sequence is executed. These are expected to have\n    attached debugger to the process corresponding to the debug target.\n  - Otherwise the default attach action is performed (equivalent to the `process attach` command).\n- The `postRunCommands` sequence is executed.\n- ...\n- At the end of the debugging session the `exitCommands` sequence is executed.\n\nNote that attaching to a running process may be [restricted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptrace#Support)\non some systems.  You may need to adjust system configuration to enable it.\n\n### Pick Process Command\n\nThe `${command:pickProcess}` or `${command:pickMyProcess}` can be used directly in the configuration for an interactive\nlist of processes running on the machine running Visual Studio Code:\n\n```javascript\n{\n    \"name\": \"Pick Process Attach\",\n    \"type\": \"lldb\",\n    \"request\": \"attach\",\n    \"pid\": \"${command:pickProcess}\" // Or pickMyProcess for only processes for the current user.\n}\n```\n\nThe `lldb.pickProcess` and `lldb.pickMyProcess` commands provide more configuration when used with input variables. The\noptional `initCommands` arg let you specify lldb commands to configure a remote connection. The optional `filter` arg\nlets you filter the process list to those that match the specified filter.\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n  \"configurations\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Filtered Remote Attach\",\n      \"type\": \"lldb\",\n      \"request\": \"attach\",\n      \"pid\": \"${input:pickExampleProcess}\",\n      \"initCommands\": [ ... ], // Eg, platform select/connect commands.\n    },\n  ],\n  \"inputs\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"pickExampleProcess\",\n      \"type\": \"command\",\n      \"command\": \"lldb.pickProcess\",\n      \"args\": {\n        \"initCommands\": [ ], // Eg., platform select/connect commands.\n        \"filter\": \"example\" // RegExp to filter processes to.\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Custom Launch\n\nThe custom launch method allows user to fully specify how the debug session is initiated:\n- The `targetCreateCommands` command sequence is executed. This sequence is expected to have created the debug target (see `target create` command).\n- Breakpoints are created.\n- The `processCreateCommands` command sequence is executed.  This sequence is expected to have created the debuggee process (see `process launch` command).\n- ...\n- At the end of the debugging session the `exitCommands` sequence is executed.\n\n|attribute          |type    |         |\n|-------------------|--------|---------|\n|**targetCreateCommands**  |[string]|Commands that create the debug target.\n|**processCreateCommands** |[string]|Commands that create the debuggee process.\n\n\n## Debugging Externally Launched Code\n\nDebugging sessions may also be started from outside of VSCode by invoking a specially formatted URI:\n\n- **`vscode://vadimcn.vscode-lldb/launch?name=<configuration name>,[folder=<path>]`**</br>\n  This will start a new debug session using the named launch configuration.  The optional `folder` parameter specifies\n  the workspace folder where the launch configuration is defined.  If omitted, all folders in the current workspace will be searched.\n  - `code --open-url \"vscode://vadimcn.vscode-lldb/launch?name=Debug My Project\"`\n- **`vscode://vadimcn.vscode-lldb/launch/command?<env1>=<val1>&<env2>=<val2>&<command-line>`**</br>\n  The \\<command-line\\> will be split into the program name and arguments array using the usual shell command-line parsing rules.\n  - `code --open-url \"vscode://vadimcn.vscode-lldb/launch/command?/path/filename arg1 \\\"arg 2\\\" arg3\"`\n  - `code --open-url \"vscode://vadimcn.vscode-lldb/launch/command?RUST_LOG=error&/path/filename arg1 'arg 2' arg3\"`\n- **`vscode://vadimcn.vscode-lldb/launch/config?<yaml>`**</br>\n  This endpoint accepts a [YAML](https://yaml.org/) snippet matching one of the above debug session initiation methods.\n  The `type` and the `request` attributes may be omitted, and will default to \"lldb\" and \"launch\" respectively.\n  - JSON-like YAML (if you are not quoting keys in mappings, remember to insert a space after the colon!):<br>\n  `code --open-url \"vscode://vadimcn.vscode-lldb/launch/config?{program: '/path/filename', args: ['arg1','arg 2','arg3']}\"`<br>\n  - Line-oriented YAML (`%0A` encodes the 'newline' character):<br>\n   `code --open-url \"vscode://vadimcn.vscode-lldb/launch/config?program: /path/filename%0Aargs:%0A- arg1%0A- arg 2%0A- arg3\"`<br>\n\n\nNotes:\n- All URIs above are subject to normal [URI encoding rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding), therefore all '%' characters must be escaped as '%25'.   A more rigorous launcher script would have done that :)<br>\n- VSCode URIs may also be invoked using OS-specific tools:\n  - Linux: `xdg-open <uri>`\n  - MacOS: `open <uri>`\n  - Windows: `start <uri>`\n\nExamples:\n\n### Attaching debugger to the current process (C)\n```C\nchar command[256];\nsnprintf(command, sizeof(command), \"code --open-url \\\"vscode://vadimcn.vscode-lldb/launch/config?{'request':'attach','pid':%d}\\\"\", getpid());\nsystem(command);\nsleep(1); // Wait for debugger to attach\n```\n\n### Attaching debugger to the current process (Rust)\nEver wanted to debug a build script?\n```Rust\nlet url = format!(\"vscode://vadimcn.vscode-lldb/launch/config?{{'request':'attach','pid':{}}}\", std::process::id());\nstd::process::Command::new(\"code\").arg(\"--open-url\").arg(url).output().unwrap();\nstd::thread::sleep_ms(1000); // Wait for debugger to attach\n```\n\n### Debugging Rust unit tests\n- Create `.cargo` directory in your project folder containing these two files:\n    - `config` [(see also)](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html)\n        ```TOML\n        [target.<current-target-triple>]\n        runner = \".cargo/codelldb.sh\"\n        ```\n    - `codelldb.sh`\n        ```sh\n        #!/bin/bash\n        code --open-url \"vscode://vadimcn.vscode-lldb/launch/command?LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH&$*\"\n        ```\n- `chmod +x .cargo/codelldb.sh`\n- Execute tests as normal.\n\n### Bazel\n- Create `codelldb.sh`:\n    ```sh\n    #!/bin/bash\n    code --open-url \"vscode://vadimcn.vscode-lldb/launch/command?LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH&$*\"\n    ```\n- `chmod +x codelldb.sh`\n- `bazel run --run_under=codelldb.sh //<package>:<target>`\n\n## RPC Server\nUnfortunately, starting debug sessons via the \"open-url\" interface has two problems:\n- It launches debug session in the last active VSCode window.\n- It [does not work](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/4260) with VSCode remoting.\n\nFor these reasons, CodeLLDB offers an alternate method of performing external launches: by adding `lldb.rpcServer` setting to a workspace\nof folder configuration you can start an RPC server listening for debug configurations on a Unix or a TCP socket:\n- The value is the [options](https://nodejs.org/api/net.html#net_server_listen_options_callback) object of the Node.js network server object.\n- As a rudimentary security feature, you may add a \"`token`\" attribute to the server options above, in which case, the submitted\ndebug configurations must also contain `token` with a matching value.<br>\n- After writing configuration data, the client must half-close its end of the connection.\n- Upon completion, CodeLLDB will respond with `{ \"success\": true/false, \"message\": <optional error message> }`\n\n\n\n### Example:\n- Configuration in settings.json: `\"lldb.rpcServer\": { \"host\": \"127.0.0.1\", \"port\": 12345, \"token\": \"secret\" }`\n- Launch: `echo \"{ program: '/usr/bin/ls', token: 'secret' }\" | netcat -N 127.0.0.1 12345`\n\n## Remote debugging\n\nFor general information on remote debugging please see [LLDB Remote Debugging Guide](http://lldb.llvm.org/remote.html).\n\n### Connecting to lldb-server agent\n- Run `lldb-server platform --server --listen *:<port>` on the remote machine.\n- Create launch configuration similar to the one below.\n- Start debugging as usual.  The executable identified by the `program` property will\nbe automatically copied to `lldb-server`'s current directory on the remote machine.\n\nIf you require additional configuration of the remote system, you may use `preRunCommands` sequence\nto execute commands such as `platform mkdir`, `platform put-file`, `platform shell`, etc.\n(see `help platform` for a list of available platform commands).\n\n```javascript\n{\n    \"name\": \"Remote launch\",\n    \"type\": \"lldb\",\n    \"request\": \"launch\",\n    \"program\": \"${workspaceFolder}/build/debuggee\", // Local path.\n    \"initCommands\": [\n        \"platform select <platform>\", // For example: 'remote-linux', 'remote-macosx', 'remote-android', etc.\n        \"platform connect connect://<remote_host>:<port>\",\n        \"settings set target.inherit-env false\", // See note below.\n    ],\n    \"env\": {\n        \"PATH\": \"...\", // See note below.\n    }\n}\n```\nNote: By default, debuggee will inherit environment from the debugger.  However, this environment  will be of your\n**local** machine.  In most cases these values will not be suitable on the remote system,\nso you should consider disabling environment inheritance with `settings set target.inherit-env false` and\ninitializing them as appropriate, starting with `PATH`.\n\n### Connecting to a gdbserver-style agent\nThis includes not just gdbserver itself, but also execution environments that implement the gdbserver protocol,\nsuch as [OpenOCD](http://openocd.org/), [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/), [rr](https://rr-project.org/), and others.\n\n- Start remote agent. For example, run `gdbserver *:<port> <debuggee> <debuggee args>` on the remote machine.\n- Create a custom launch configuration.\n- Start debugging.\n```javascript\n{\n    \"name\": \"Remote attach\",\n    \"type\": \"lldb\",\n    \"request\": \"custom\",\n    \"targetCreateCommands\": [\"target create ${workspaceFolder}/build/debuggee\"],\n    \"processCreateCommands\": [\"gdb-remote <remote_host>:<port>\"]\n}\n```\n\n\nPlease note that depending on protocol features implemented by the remote stub, there may be more setup needed.\nFor example, in the case of \"bare-metal\" debugging (OpenOCD), the debugger may not be aware of memory locations\nof the debuggee modules; you may need to specify this manually:\n```\ntarget modules load --file ${workspaceFolder}/build/debuggee -s <base load address>`\n```\n\n## Reverse Debugging\n\nAlso known as [Time travel debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel_debugging).  Provided you use a debugging backend that supports\n[these commands](https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Packets.html#bc), CodeLLDB be used to control reverse execution and stepping.\n\nAs of this writing, the only known backend that works is [Mozilla's rr](https://rr-project.org/).  The minimum supported version is 5.3.0.\n\nThere are others mentioned [here](http://www.sourceware.org/gdb/news/reversible.html) and [here](https://github.com/mozilla/rr/wiki/Related-work).\n[QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) reportedly [supports record/replay](https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/master/docs/replay.txt) in full system emulation mode.\nIf you get any of them to work, please let me know!\n\n### Example: (using rr)\nRecord execution trace:\n```sh\nrr record <debuggee> <arg1> ...\n```\n\nReplay execution:\n```sh\nrr replay -s <port>\n```\n\nLaunch config:\n```javascript\n{\n    \"name\": \"Replay\",\n    \"type\": \"lldb\",\n    \"request\": \"custom\",\n    \"targetCreateCommands\": [\"target create ${workspaceFolder}/build/debuggee\"],\n    \"processCreateCommands\": [\"gdb-remote 127.0.0.1:<port>\"],\n    \"reverseDebugging\": true\n}\n```\n\n## Inspecting a Core Dump\nUse custom launch with `target create -c <core path>` command:\n```javascript\n{\n    \"name\": \"Core dump\",\n    \"type\": \"lldb\",\n    \"request\": \"custom\",\n    \"targetCreateCommands\": [\"target create -c ${workspaceFolder}/core\"],\n}\n```\n\n## Source Path Remapping\nSource path remapping is helpful when the program's source code is located in a different directory than it was at build time (for example, if a build server was used).\n\nA source map consists of pairs of \"from\" and \"to\" path prefixes.  When the debugger encounters a source\nfile path beginning with one of the \"from\" prefixes, it will substitute the corresponding \"to\" prefix\ninstead.  Example:\n```javascript\n    \"sourceMap\": { \"/build/time/source/path\" : \"/current/source/path\" }\n```\n\n## Parameterized Launch Configurations\nSometimes you'll find yourself adding the same parameters (e.g. a path of a dataset directory)\nto multiple launch configurations over and over again.  CodeLLDB can help with configuration management\nin such cases: you can place common configuration values into `lldb.dbgconfig` section of the workspace configuration,\nthen reference via `${dbgconfig:variable}` in launch configurations.<br>\nExample:\n\n```javascript\n// settings.json\n    ...\n    \"lldb.dbgconfig\":\n    {\n        \"dataset\": \"dataset1\",\n        \"datadir\": \"${env:HOME}/mydata/${dbgconfig:dataset}\" // \"dbgconfig\" properties may reference each other,\n                                                             // as long as there is no recursion.\n    }\n\n// launch.json\n    ...\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Debug program\",\n        \"type\": \"lldb\",\n        \"program\": \"${workspaceFolder}/build/bin/program\",\n        \"cwd\": \"${dbgconfig:datadir}\" // will be expanded to \"/home/user/mydata/dataset1\"\n    }\n```\n\n# Debugger Features\n\n## VSCode Commands\n\n|                                 |                                                         |\n|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n|**Show Disassembly...**          |Choose when disassembly is shown.

See [Alternate LLDB backends](#alternate-lldb-backends)\n\n\n## Debugger Commands\n\nCodeLLDB adds in-debugger commands that may be executed in the DEBUG CONSOLE panel during a debug dession:\n\n|                 |                                                         |\n|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n|**debug_info**   |Provides tools for investigation of debugging information.  See `debug_info -h` for options.\n\nFor more details about each command please use `help <command>`.\n\n## Debug Console\n\nThe VSCode [DEBUG CONSOLE](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_debug-console-repl) panel serves a dual\npurpose in CodeLLDB:\n1. Execution of [LLDB commands](https://lldb.llvm.org/use/tutorial.html).\n2. Evaluation of [expressions](#expressions).\n\nBy default, console input is interpreted as LLDB commands.  If you would like to evaluate an expression instead, prefix it with\n'`?`', e.g. '`?a+2`' (Expression type preffixes are added on top of that, i.e. '`?/nat a.size()`').\nConsole input mode may altered via **\"lldb.consoleMode\": \"evaluate\"** setting: in this case expression evaluation will be the default,\nwhile commands will need to be prefixed with either '`/cmd `' or '`' (backtick).\n\n## Regex Breakpoints\nFunction breakpoints prefixed with '`/re `', are interpreted as regular expressions.\nThis causes a breakpoint to be set in every function matching the expression.\nThe list of created breakpoint locations may be examined using the `break list` command.\n\n## Conditional Breakpoints\nYou may use any of the supported expression [syntaxes](#expressions) to create breakpoint conditions.\nWhen a breakpoint condition evaluates to False, the breakpoint will not be stopped at.\nAny other value (or expression evaluation error) will cause the debugger to stop.\n\n## Data Breakpoints\nData breakpoints (or \"watchpoints\" in LLDB terms) allow monitoring memory locations for changes.  You can create data\nbreakpoints by choosing \"Break When Value Changes\" from context menu in the Variables panel. (To access advanced features,\nsuch as breaking on memory reads, use LLDB `watch` command).\n\nNote that data breakpoints require hardware support, and, as such, may come with restrictions, depending on CPU platform and OS support.\nFor example, on x86_64 the restrictions are as follows:\n- The monitored memory region must be 1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes in size.\n- There may be at most 4 data watchpoints.\n\n\n## Hit conditions\nSyntax:\n```\n    operator :: = '<' | '<=' | '=' | '>=' | '>' | '%'\n    hit_condition ::= operator number\n```\n\nThe `'%'` operator causes a stop after every `number` of breakpoint hits.\n\n## Logpoints\nExpressions embedded in log messages via curly brackets may use any of the supported expression [syntaxes](#expressions).\n\n## Disassembly View\nWhen execution steps into code for which debug info is not available, CodeLLDB will automatically\nswitch to disassembly view.  This behavior may be controlled using **Show Disassembly**\nand **Toggle Disassembly** commands.  The former allows to choose between `never`,\n`auto` (the default) and `always`, the latter toggles between `auto` and `always`.\n\nWhile is disassembly view, 'step over' and 'step into' debug actions will perform instruction-level\nstepping rather than source-level stepping.\n\n![disassembly view](images/disasm.png)\n\n## Excluded Callers\n\nSometimes you may want skip breakpoints when called from certain code paths.  This is particularily relevant for \"on throw\"\nexception breakpoints in programs that use exceptions as a part of \"normal\" control flow.\n\nWhen stopped on a breakpoint, you can right-click a frame in the CALL STACK panel and choose the \"Exclude Caller\" item.\nAfterwards, the debugger won't stop on that breakpoint location, if the excluded caller appears anywhere in the call stack.\nYou can see and manage current exclusions in the EXCLUDED CALLERS panel.\n\n## Formatting\nYou may change the default display format of evaluation results using the `Display Format` command.\n\nWhen evaluating expressions in the DEBUG CONSOLE or in WATCH panel, you may control formatting of\nindividual expressions by adding one of the suffixes listed below:\n\n|suffix |format |\n|:-----:|-------|\n|**c**  | Character\n|**x**  | Hex\n|**o**  | Octal\n|**d**  | Decimal\n|**u**  | Unsigned decimal\n|**b**  | Binary\n|**f**  | Float (reinterprets bits, no casting is done)\n|**p**  | Pointer\n|**s**  | C string\n|**y**  | Bytes\n|**Y**  | Bytes with ASCII\n|**[\\<num\\>]**| Reinterpret as an array of \\<num\\> elements.\n\nFor example, evaluation of `var,x` will display the value of `var` formatted as hex.  It is also possible to combine\nnumber format and array specifiers like this: `var,x[10]`.\n\n### Pointers\n\nWhen displaying pointer and reference variables, CodeLLDB will prefer to display the\nvalue of the object pointed to.  If you would like to see the raw address value,\nyou may toggle this behavior using **Toggle Pointee Summaries** command.\nAnother way to display raw pointer address is to add the pointer variable to WATCH panel and specify\nan explicit format, as described in the previous section.\n\n## Expressions\n\nCodeLLDB implements three expression evaluator types: \"simple\", \"python\" and \"native\".  These are used\nwherever user-entered expression needs to be evaluated: in the WATCH panel, in the DEBUG CONSOLE (for input\nprefixed with `?`) and in breakpoint conditions.<br>\nBy default, \"simple\" is assumed, however you may change this using the [expressions](#launching-a-new-process) launch\nconfiguration property.  The default type may also be overridden on a per-expression basis using a prefix.\n\n### Simple expressions\nPrefix: `/se `<br>\nSimple expressions are designed to enable performing basic arithmetic and logical operations on [formatted\nviews](https://lldb.llvm.org/use/varformats.html) of the debuggee variables.  For example, things like indexing an\n`std::vector` or comparing `std::string` to a string literal should \"just work\".\n\nThe followng features are supported:\n- References to variables: all identifiers are assumed to refer to variables in the debuggee current stack frame.\n  The identifiers may be qualified with namespaces and template parameters (e.g. `std::numeric_limits<float>::digits`).\n- Embedded [native expressions](#native-expressions): these must be delimited with `${` and `}`.\n- Literals: integers, floats and strings, `True`, `False`.\n- Operators: `()`, `**`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `<<`, `>>`, `~`, `&`, `^`, `|`, `==`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`,\n             `not`, `and`, `or` with the same precedence as in Python.\n- Attribute access: `<expr>.<attr>`.\n- Indexing: `<expr>[<expr>]`.\n\n### Python expressions\nPrefix: `/py `<br>\nPython expressions support full Python syntax.  In addition to that, any identifier prefixed by `$`, will be replaced\nwith the value of the corresponding debuggee variable.  Such values may be mixed with regular Python variables.\nFor example, `/py [math.sqrt(x) for x in $arr]` will evaluate to a list of square roots of the values contained in\nthe array variable `arr`.\n\nThe environment in which Python expressions are executed is shared with the internal Python interpreter of the debugger\nand is affected by the `script ...` command.   This may be used to import Python modules you are going to use later.\nFor example, in order to evaluate `math.sqrt(x)` above, you'll need to have imported the `math` package via\n`script import math`.  To import Python modules on debug session startup, use `\"initCommands\": [\"script import ...\"]`.\n\n**Technical note**<br>\nEvaluation of Python expressions is performed as follows:\n- First, the expression is preprocessed and all tokens starting with '$' are replaced with calls to the `__expr()` function,\n  For example, the expression `[math.sqrt(x) for x in $arr]` will be re-written as `[math.sqrt(x) for x in __eval('arr')]`\n- The resulting string is evaluated by the Python interpreter, with the `__eval()` function performing variable\n  lookups and evaluation of native expressions, returning instances of [`Value`](#value).\n\n### Native expressions\nPrefix: `/nat `<br>\nNative expressions use LLDB's built-in expression evaluators.  The specifics depend on source language of the\ncurrent debug target (e.g. C, C++ or Swift).<br>\nFor example, the C++ expression evaluator offers many powerful features including interactive definition\nof new data types, instantiation of C++ classes, invocation of functions and class methods, and more.\n\nNote, however, that native evaluators ignore data formatters and operate on \"raw\" data structures,\nthus they are often not as convenient as \"simple\" or \"python\" expressions.\n\n# Python Scripting\n\n## Debugger API\n\nCodeLLDB provides extended Python API via the `codelldb` module (also aliased as `debugger`),\nwhich is auto-imported into debugger's main script context:\n\n```python\n# codelldb\n\ndef get_config(name: str, default: Any = None) -> Any:\n    '''Retrieve a configuration value from the adapter settings.\n        name:    Dot-separated path of the setting to retrieve.

May be later replaced via Webview.set_html().\n        title:              Panel title.\n        view_column:        Column in which to show the webview.\n        preserve_focus:     Whether to preserve focus in the current editor when revealing the webview.\n        enable_find_widget: Controls if the find widget is enabled in the panel.\n        retain_context_when_hidden: Controls if the webview panel retains its context when it is hidden.\n        enable_scripts:     Controls if scripts are enabled in the webview.\n    '''\n```\n\n## Webview\nA simplified interface for [webview panels](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#WebviewPanel).\n\n```python\nclass Webview:\n    def dispose(self):\n        '''Destroy webview panel.'''\n    def set_html(self, html: str):\n        '''Set HTML contents of the webview.'''\n    def reveal(self,  view_column: Optional[int] = None, preserve_focus: bool = False):\n        '''Show the webview panel in a given column.'''\n    def post_message(self, message: Any):\n        '''Post a message to the webview content.'''\n        interface.send_message(dict(message='webviewPostMessage', id=self.id, inner=message))\n    @property\n    def on_did_receive_message(self) -> Event:\n        '''Fired when webview content posts a new message.'''\n    @property\n    def on_did_dispose(self) -> Event:\n        '''Fired when the webview panel is disposed (either by the user or by calling dispose())'''\n```\n\n## Event\n```python\nclass Event:\n    def add(self, listener: Callable[[Any]]):\n        '''Add an event listener.'''\n    def remove(self, listener: Callable[[Any]]):\n        '''Remove an event listener.'''\n```\n\n## Value\n`Value` objects ([source](adapter/scripts/codelldb/value.py)) are proxy wrappers around [`lldb.SBValue`](https://lldb.llvm.org/python_api/lldb.SBValue.html),\nwhich add implementations of standard Python operators.\n\n## Installing Packages\n\nCodeLLDB bundles its own copy of Python, which may be different from the version of your default Python.\nAs such, it likely won't be able to use third-party packages you've installed through `pip`.  In order to install packages\nfor use in CodeLLDB, you will need to use the **LLDB: Command Prompt** command in VSCode, followed by `pip install --user <package>`.\n\n## Stdio in Python scripts\n- `stdout` output will be sent to the Debug Console\n- `stderr` output will be sent to the Output/LLDB panel\n\n# Alternate LLDB Backends\n\nCodeLLDB can use external LLDB backends instead of the bundled one.  For example, when debugging Swift programs,\none might want to use a custom LLDB instance that has Swift extensions built in.   In order to use an alternate backend,\nyou will need to provide location of the corresponding LLDB dynamic library (which must be v10.0 or later) via\n**lldb.library** configuration setting.\n\nWhere to find the LLDB dynamic library:\n- Linux: `<lldb root>/lib/liblldb.so.<verson>`,<br>\n    `<lldb root>` is wherever you've installed LLDB, or `/usr`, if it's a standard distro package.\n- MacOS: `<lldb framework>/LLDB` if built as Apple framework, `<lldb root>/lib/liblldb.<version>.dylib` otherwise.<br>\n    `<lldb framework>` is typically located under `/Library/Developer/<toolchain>/.../PrivateFrameworks`.\n- Windows: `<lldb root>/bin/liblldb.dll`.\n\nSince locating liblldb is not always trivial, CodeLLDB provides the **Use Alternate Backend...** command to assist with this task.\nYou will be prompted to enter the file name of the main LLDB executable, which CodeLLDB will then use to find the dynamic library.\n\nNote: Debian builds of LLDB have a bug whereby they search for `lldb-server` helper binary relative to the current\nexecutable module (which in this case is CodeLLDB), rather than relative to liblldb (as they should).  As a result,\nyou may see the following error after switching to an alternate backend: \"Unable to locate lldb-server-\\<version\\>\".\nTo fix this, determine where `lldb-server` is installed (via `which lldb-server-<version>`), then add\nthis configuration entry: `\"lldb.adapterEnv\": {\"LLDB_DEBUGSERVER_PATH\": \"<lldb-server path>\"}`.\n\n\n# Rust Language Support\n\nCodeLLDB will attempt to locate and load LLDB data formatters provided by the Rust toolchain.  By default, the configured\ntoolchain of your workspace root will be used, however this can be overridden via these configuration settings:\n- **lldb.script.lang.rust.toolchain** - override toolchain name, for example `beta`.\n- **lldb.script.lang.rust.sysroot** - set toolchain sysroot directly, for example `/home/user/.rustup/toolchains/beta-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`.\n\nTo enable this feature, add `\"sourceLanguages\": [\"rust\"]` into your launch configuration.\n\n## Cargo support\n\nSeveral Rust users had pointed out that debugging tests and benchmarks in Cargo-based projects is somewhat\ndifficult since names of the output test/bench binary generated by Cargo is not deterministic.\nTo address this problem, CodeLLDB can query Cargo for a list of its compilation outputs.  In order\nto use this feature, replace `program` property in your launch configuration with `cargo`:\n```javascript\n{\n    \"type\": \"lldb\",\n    \"request\": \"launch\",\n    \"cargo\": {\n        \"args\": [\"test\", \"--no-run\", \"--lib\"],      // Cargo command line to build the debug target\n                                                    // \"args\": [\"build\", \"--bin=foo\"] is another possibility\n        // The rest are optional\n        \"env\": { \"RUSTFLAGS\": \"-Clinker=ld.mold\" }, // Extra environment variables.\n        \"cwd\": \"${workspaceFolder}\",                // Cargo working directory.\n        \"problemMatcher\": \"$rustc\",                 // Problem matcher(s) to apply to cargo output.\n        \"filter\": {                                 // Filter applied to compilation artifacts.\n            \"name\": \"mylib\",\n            \"kind\": \"lib\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nTry to be as specific as possible when specifying the build target, because if there is more than one\nbinary output, CodeLLDB won't know which one you want it to debug!\n\nNormally, Cargo output will be used to set the `program` property (but only if it isn't defined).\nHowever, in order to support custom launch and other oddball scenarios, there is also\na substitution variable, which expands to the same thing: `${cargo:program}`.\n\nCodeLLDB will also use `Cargo.toml` in the workspace root to generate initial debug\nconfigurations when there is no existing `launch.json`.\n\n# Settings\n\n## Workspace Settings\n\nThe \"Workspace Settings\" term used in the document refers to the combined view of [VSCode User and Workspace settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings), merged according to the\n[settings precedence](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings#_settings-precedence) hierarchy.\n\n## Launch Configurations Settings\nVSCode [launch configuration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_launch-configurations)\nsettings are distinct from workspace settings and are not subject to the usual settings merging described above.\n\nHowever, since common defaults for all launch configurations in a project are often desired, the CodeLLDB extension\nprovides this feature via [`lldb.launch.*`](#default-launch-configuration-settings) setting group, which serve as defaults\nfor the corresponding launch configuration settings.  When a setting is specified in both locations, the values will\nbe merged according to on their type:\n- For lists, the resulting value will be a concatenation of both sources.\n- For dictionaties, the resulting value will be a combination of key-value pairs from both sources.  For equal keys,\n  the launch configuration value takes precedence.\n- For numbers and strings, the launch configuration value takes precedence.\n\n### Variable Substitution in Launch Configurations\nBefore being sent to the debug adapter, launch configuration settings undergo expansion of\n[variable references](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/variables-reference).\nIn addition to the standard expansions performed by VSCode, CodeLLDB also expands references to\n[`${dbgconfig:<name>}`](#parameterized-launch-configurations) as well as [`${cargo:program}`](#cargo-support).\n\n## LLDB Settings\nThe LLDB debugger engine also has a number of internal settings, which affect its behavior.
