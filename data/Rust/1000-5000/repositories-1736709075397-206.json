Code\ncontributions are not the only way to help the community. Answering questions, helping\nothers, and improving the documentation are also immensely valuable.\n\nIt also helps us if you spread the word! Reference the library in blog posts\nabout the awesome projects it made possible, shout out on Twitter every time it has\nhelped you, or simply ⭐️ the repository to say thank you.\n\nHowever you choose to contribute, please be mindful and respect our\n[code of conduct](https://github.com/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n**This guide was heavily inspired by the awesome [scikit-learn guide to contributing](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).**\n\n## Ways to contribute\n\nThere are several ways you can contribute to text-embeddings-inference.\n\n* Fix outstanding issues with the existing code.\n* Submit issues related to bugs or desired new features.\n* Contribute to the examples or to the documentation.\n\n> All contributions are equally valuable to the community. 🥰\n\n## Fixing outstanding issues\n\nIf you notice an issue with the existing code and have a fix in mind, feel free to [start contributing](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) and open\na Pull Request!\n\n## Submitting a bug-related issue or feature request\n\nDo your best to follow these guidelines when submitting a bug-related issue or a feature\nrequest. It will make it easier for us to come back to you quickly and with good\nfeedback.\n\n### Did you find a bug?\n\nThe text-embeddings-inference library is robust and reliable thanks to users who report the problems they encounter.\n\nBefore you report an issue, we would really appreciate it if you could **make sure the bug was not\nalready reported** (use the search bar on GitHub under Issues). Your issue should also be related to bugs in the\nlibrary itself, and not your code.\n\nOnce you've confirmed the bug hasn't already been reported, please include the following information in your issue so\nwe can quickly resolve it:\n\n* Your **OS type and version**, as well as your environment versions (versions of rust, python, and dependencies).\n* A short, self-contained, code snippet that allows us to reproduce the bug.\n* The *full* traceback if an exception is raised.\n* Attach any other additional information, like screenshots, you think may help.\n\n### Do you want a new feature?\n\nIf there is a new feature you'd like to see in text-embeddings-inference, please open an issue and describe:\n\n1. What is the *motivation* behind this feature? Is it related to a problem or frustration with the library? Is it\n   a feature related to something you need for a project? Is it something you worked on and think it could benefit\n   the community?\n\n   Whatever it is, we'd love to hear about it!\n\n2. Describe your requested feature in as much detail as possible. The more you can tell us about it, the better\n   we'll be able to help you.\n3. Provide a *code snippet* that demonstrates the feature's usage.\n4. If the feature is related to a paper, please include a link.\n\nIf your issue is well written we're already 80% of the way there by the time you create it.\n\nWe have added [templates](https://github.com/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference/tree/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE)\nto help you get started with your issue.\n\n## Do you want to implement a new model?\n\nNew models are constantly released and if you want to implement a new model, please provide the following information:\n\n* A short description of the model and a link to the paper.\n* Link to the implementation if it is open-sourced.\n* Link to the model weights if they are available.\n\nIf you are willing to contribute the model yourself, let us know so we can help you add it to text-embeddings-inference!\n\n## Do you want to add documentation?\n\nWe're always looking for improvements to the documentation that make it more clear and accurate. Please let us know\nhow the documentation can be improved such as typos and any content that is missing, unclear or inaccurate. We'll be\nhappy to make the changes or help you make a contribution if you're interested!\n\n## I want to become a maintainer of the project. How do I get there?\n\nTGI is a project led and managed by Hugging Face as it powers our internal services. However, we are happy to have\nmotivated individuals from other organizations join us as maintainers with the goal of making TGI the best inference\nservice.\n\nIf you are such an individual (or organization), please reach out to us and let's collaborate.\n"

This allows you to gain access to protected resources.\n\nFor example:\n\n1. Go to https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens\n2. Copy your cli READ token\n3. Export `HF_API_TOKEN=<your cli READ token>`\n\nor with Docker:\n\n```shell\nmodel=<your private model>\nvolume=$PWD/data # share a volume with the Docker container to avoid downloading weights every run\ntoken=<your cli READ token>\n\ndocker run --gpus all -e HF_API_TOKEN=$token -p 8080:80 -v $volume:/data --pull always ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:1.6 --model-id $model\n```\n\n### Air gapped deployment\n\nTo deploy Text Embeddings Inference in an air-gapped environment, first download the weights and then mount them inside\nthe container using a volume.\n\nFor example:\n\n```shell\n# (Optional) create a `models` directory\nmkdir models\ncd models\n\n# Make sure you have git-lfs installed (https://git-lfs.com)\ngit lfs install\ngit clone https://huggingface.co/Alibaba-NLP/gte-base-en-v1.5\n\n# Set the models directory as the volume path\nvolume=$PWD\n\n# Mount the models directory inside the container with a volume and set the model ID\ndocker run --gpus all -p 8080:80 -v $volume:/data --pull always ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:1.6 --model-id /data/gte-base-en-v1.5\n```\n\n### Using Re-rankers models\n\n`text-embeddings-inference` v0.4.0 added support for CamemBERT, RoBERTa, XLM-RoBERTa, and GTE Sequence Classification models.\nRe-rankers models are Sequence Classification cross-encoders models with a single class that scores the similarity\nbetween a query and a text.\n\nSee [this blogpost](https://blog.llamaindex.ai/boosting-rag-picking-the-best-embedding-reranker-models-42d079022e83) by\nthe LlamaIndex team to understand how you can use re-rankers models in your RAG pipeline to improve\ndownstream performance.\n\n```shell\nmodel=BAAI/bge-reranker-large\nvolume=$PWD/data # share a volume with the Docker container to avoid downloading weights every run\n\ndocker run --gpus all -p 8080:80 -v $volume:/data --pull always ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:1.6 --model-id $model\n```\n\nAnd then you can rank the similarity between a query and a list of texts with:\n\n```bash\ncurl 127.0.0.1:8080/rerank \\\n    -X POST \\\n    -d '{\"query\": \"What is Deep Learning?\", \"texts\": [\"Deep Learning is not...\", \"Deep learning is...\"]}' \\\n    -H 'Content-Type: application/json'\n```\n\n### Using Sequence Classification models\n\nYou can also use classic Sequence Classification models like `SamLowe/roberta-base-go_emotions`:\n\n```shell\nmodel=SamLowe/roberta-base-go_emotions\nvolume=$PWD/data # share a volume with the Docker container to avoid downloading weights every run\n\ndocker run --gpus all -p 8080:80 -v $volume:/data --pull always ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:1.6 --model-id $model\n```\n\nOnce you have deployed the model you can use the `predict` endpoint to get the emotions most associated with an input:\n\n```bash\ncurl 127.0.0.1:8080/predict \\\n    -X POST \\\n    -d '{\"inputs\":\"I like you.\"}' \\\n    -H 'Content-Type: application/json'\n```\n\n### Using SPLADE pooling\n\nYou can choose to activate SPLADE pooling for Bert and Distilbert MaskedLM architectures:\n\n```shell\nmodel=naver/efficient-splade-VI-BT-large-query\nvolume=$PWD/data # share a volume with the Docker container to avoid downloading weights every run\n\ndocker run --gpus all -p 8080:80 -v $volume:/data --pull always ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:1.6 --model-id $model --pooling splade\n```\n\nOnce you have deployed the model you can use the `/embed_sparse` endpoint to get the sparse embedding:\n\n```bash\ncurl 127.0.0.1:8080/embed_sparse \\\n    -X POST \\\n    -d '{\"inputs\":\"I like you.\"}' \\\n    -H 'Content-Type: application/json'\n```\n\n### Distributed Tracing\n\n`text-embeddings-inference` is instrumented with distributed tracing using OpenTelemetry. You can use this feature\nby setting the address to an OTLP collector with the `--otlp-endpoint` argument.\n\n### gRPC\n\n`text-embeddings-inference` offers a gRPC API as an alternative to the default HTTP API for high performance\ndeployments. The API protobuf definition can be\nfound [here](https://github.com/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference/blob/main/proto/tei.proto).\n\nYou can use the gRPC API by adding the `-grpc` tag to any TEI Docker image. For example:\n\n```shell\nmodel=BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5\nvolume=$PWD/data # share a volume with the Docker container to avoid downloading weights every run\n\ndocker run --gpus all -p 8080:80 -v $volume:/data --pull always ghcr.io/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference:1.6-grpc --model-id $model\n```\n\n```shell\ngrpcurl -d '{\"inputs\": \"What is Deep Learning\"}' -plaintext 0.0.0.0:8080 tei.v1.Embed/Embed\n```\n\n## Local install\n\n### CPU\n\nYou can also opt to install `text-embeddings-inference` locally.\n\nFirst [install Rust](https://rustup.rs/):\n\n```shell\ncurl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh\n```\n\nThen run:\n\n```shell\n# On x86\ncargo install --path router -F mkl\n# On M1 or M2\ncargo install --path router -F metal\n```\n\nYou can now launch Text Embeddings Inference on CPU with:\n\n```shell\nmodel=BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5\n\ntext-embeddings-router --model-id $model --port 8080\n```\n\n**Note:** on some machines, you may also need the OpenSSL libraries and gcc. On Linux machines, run:\n\n```shell\nsudo apt-get install libssl-dev gcc -y\n```\n\n### Cuda\n\nGPUs with Cuda compute capabilities < 7.5 are not supported (V100, Titan V, GTX 1000 series, ...).\n\nMake sure you have Cuda and the nvidia drivers installed. NVIDIA drivers on your device need to be compatible with CUDA\nversion 12.2 or higher.\nYou also need to add the nvidia binaries to your path:\n\n```shell\nexport PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/cuda/bin\n```\n\nThen run:\n\n```shell\n# This can take a while as we need to compile a lot of cuda kernels\n\n# On Turing GPUs (T4, RTX 2000 series ... )\ncargo install --path router -F candle-cuda-turing -F http --no-default-features\n\n# On Ampere and Hopper\ncargo install --path router -F candle-cuda -F http --no-default-features\n```\n\nYou can now launch Text Embeddings Inference on GPU with:\n\n```shell\nmodel=BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5\n\ntext-embeddings-router --model-id $model --port 8080\n```\n\n## Docker build\n\nYou can build the CPU container with:\n\n```shell\ndocker build .\n```\n\nTo build the Cuda containers, you need to know the compute cap of the GPU you will be using\nat runtime.\n\nThen you can build the container with:\n\n```shell\n# Example for Turing (T4, RTX 2000 series, ...)\nruntime_compute_cap=75\n\n# Example for A100\nruntime_compute_cap=80\n\n# Example for A10\nruntime_compute_cap=86\n\n# Example for Ada Lovelace (RTX 4000 series, ...)\nruntime_compute_cap=89\n\n# Example for H100\nruntime_compute_cap=90\n\ndocker build . -f Dockerfile-cuda --build-arg CUDA_COMPUTE_CAP=$runtime_compute_cap\n```\n\n### Apple M1/M2 arm64 architectures\n\n#### DISCLAIMER\n\nAs explained here [MPS-Ready, ARM64 Docker Image](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/81224), Metal / MPS is not\nsupported via Docker. As such inference will be CPU bound and most likely pretty slow when using this docker image on an\nM1/M2 ARM CPU.\n\n```\ndocker build . -f Dockerfile --platform=linux/arm64\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n- [Set up an Inference Endpoint with TEI](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/automatic_embedding_tei_inference_endpoints)\n- [RAG containers with TEI](https://github.com/plaggy/rag-containers)\n"
