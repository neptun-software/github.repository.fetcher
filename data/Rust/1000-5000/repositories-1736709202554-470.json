The primitive keeps two copies of the\nbacking data structure, one that is accessed by readers, and one that is\naccessed by the (single) writer. This enables all reads to proceed in\nparallel with minimal coordination, and shifts the coordination overhead\nto the writer. In the absence of writes, reads scale linearly with the\nnumber of cores.\n"
