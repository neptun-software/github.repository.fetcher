This means that the crate will continue to\nreceive critical security and bug fixes, but heavy feature development has stopped. If you're looking for a new\nfeature, you're welcome to open a PR and I'll try to find the time to review it.\n\nFlume has been great fun to work on, and I'm happy that it's being used successfully by so many people. I consider the\ncrate to be largely feature-complete at this point (bar small details here and there).\n\n## License\n\nFlume is licensed under either of:\n\n- Apache License 2.0, (http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\n\n- MIT license (http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n"
