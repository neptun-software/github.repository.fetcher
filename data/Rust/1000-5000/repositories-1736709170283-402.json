The\nunderlying algorithm for figuring out which bits of code need to be\nre-executed after any given change is based on the algorithm used in\nrustc. Michael Woerister and I first described the rustc algorithm in\nterms of two colors, red and green, and hence we called it the\n\"red-green algorithm\". This made me think of the New Mexico State\nQuestion --- [\"Red or green?\"][nm] --- which refers to chile\n(salsa). Although this version no longer uses colors (we borrowed\nrevision counters from Glimmer, instead), I still like the name.\n\n[nm]: https://www.sos.state.nm.us/about-new-mexico/state-question/\n\n## What is the relationship between salsa and an Entity-Component System (ECS)?\n\nYou may have noticed that Salsa \"feels\" a lot like an ECS in some\nways. That's true -- Salsa's queries are a bit like *components* (and\nthe keys to the queries are a bit like *entities*). But there is one\nbig difference: **ECS is -- at its heart -- a mutable system**. You\ncan get or set a component of some entity whenever you like. In\ncontrast, salsa's queries **define \"derived values\" via pure\ncomputations**.\n\nPartly as a consequence, ECS doesn't handle incremental updates for\nyou. When you update some component of some entity, you have to ensure\nthat other entities' components are updated appropriately.\n\nFinally, ECS offers interesting metadata and \"aspect-like\" facilities,\nsuch as iterating over all entities that share certain components.\nSalsa has no analogue to that.\n\n"

Ready for experimental use\nbut expect frequent breaking changes.\n\n## Credits\n\nThis system is heavily inspired by [adapton](http://adapton.org/), [glimmer](https://github.com/glimmerjs/glimmer-vm), and rustc's query\nsystem. So credit goes to Eduard-Mihai Burtescu, Matthew Hammer,\nYehuda Katz, and Michael Woerister.\n\n## Key idea\n\nThe key idea of `salsa` is that you define your program as a set of\n**queries**. Every query is used like function `K -> V` that maps from\nsome key of type `K` to a value of type `V`. Queries come in two basic\nvarieties:\n\n- **Inputs**: the base inputs to your system. You can change these\n  whenever you like.\n- **Functions**: pure functions (no side effects) that transform your\n  inputs into other values. The results of queries are memoized to\n  avoid recomputing them a lot. When you make changes to the inputs,\n  we'll figure out (fairly intelligently) when we can re-use these\n  memoized values and when we have to recompute them.\n\n## Want to learn more?\n\nTo learn more about Salsa, try one of the following:\n\n- read the [heavily commented examples](https://github.com/salsa-rs/salsa/tree/master/examples);\n- check out the [Salsa book](https://salsa-rs.github.io/salsa);\n    - [中文版](https://rust-chinese-translation.github.io/salsa-book)\n- watch one of our [videos](https://salsa-rs.github.io/salsa/videos.html).\n\n## Getting in touch\n\nThe bulk of the discussion happens in the [issues](https://github.com/salsa-rs/salsa/issues) \nand [pull requests](https://github.com/salsa-rs/salsa/pulls), \nbut we have a [zulip chat](https://salsa.zulipchat.com/) as well.\n\n"
