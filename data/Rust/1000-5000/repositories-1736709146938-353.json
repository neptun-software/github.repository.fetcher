See the [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents) for different ways to help and details about how this project handles them. Please make sure to read the relevant section before making your contribution. It will make it a lot easier for us maintainers and smooth out the experience for all involved. The community looks forward to your contributions. 🎉\n\n> And if you like the project, but just don't have time to contribute, that's fine. There are other easy ways to support the project and show your appreciation, which we would also be very happy about:\n>\n> - Star the project\n> - Tweet about it\n> - Refer this project in your project's readme\n> - Mention the project at local meetups and tell your friends/colleagues\n\n<!-- omit in toc -->\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct)\n- [I Have a Question](#i-have-a-question)\n- [I Want To Contribute](#i-want-to-contribute)\n  - [Reporting Bugs](#reporting-bugs)\n  - [Suggesting Enhancements](#suggesting-enhancements)\n  - [Your First Code Contribution](#your-first-code-contribution)\n  - [Improving The Documentation](#improving-the-documentation)\n- [Styleguides](#styleguides)\n  - [Commit Messages](#commit-messages)\n- [Join The Project Team](#join-the-project-team)\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nThis project and everyone participating in it is governed by the\n[gptcommit Code of Conduct](https://github.com/zurawiki/gptcommitblob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\nBy participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior\nto <support@zura.wiki>.\n\n## I Have a Question\n\n> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation](https://github.com/zurawiki/gptcommit).\n\nBefore you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/zurawiki/gptcommit/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.\n\nIf you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:\n\n- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/zurawiki/gptcommit/issues/new).\n- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.\n- Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant.\n\nWe will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.\n\n<!--\nYou might want to create a separate issue tag for questions and include it in this description. People should then tag their issues accordingly.\n\nDepending on how large the project is, you may want to outsource the questioning, e.g. to Stack Overflow or Gitter. You may add additional contact and information possibilities:\n- IRC\n- Slack\n- Gitter\n- Stack Overflow tag\n- Blog\n- FAQ\n- Roadmap\n- E-Mail List\n- Forum\n-->\n\n## I Want To Contribute\n\n> ### Legal Notice <!-- omit in toc -->\n>\n> When contributing to this project, you must agree that you have authored 100% of the content, that you have the necessary rights to the content and that the content you contribute may be provided under the project license.\n\n### Reporting Bugs\n\n<!-- omit in toc -->\n#### Before Submitting a Bug Report\n\nA good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.\n\n- Make sure that you are using the latest version.\n- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the [documentation](https://github.com/zurawiki/gptcommit). If you are looking for support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).\n- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](https://github.com/zurawiki/gptcommitissues?q=label%3Abug).\n- Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue.\n- Collect information about the bug:\n  - Stack trace (Traceback)\n  - OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)\n  - Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package manager, depending on what seems relevant.\n  - Possibly your input and the output\n  - Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?\n\n<!-- omit in toc -->\n#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?\n\n> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to <security@zura.wiki>.\n<!-- You may add a PGP key to allow the messages to be sent encrypted as well. -->\n\nWe use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:\n\n- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/zurawiki/gptcommit/issues/new). (Since we can't be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.)\n- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.\n- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.\n- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.\n\nOnce it's filed:\n\n- The project team will label the issue accordingly.\n- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `needs-repro`. Bugs with the `needs-repro` tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.\n- If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked `needs-fix`, as well as possibly other tags (such as `critical`), and the issue will be left to be [implemented by someone](#your-first-code-contribution).\n\n<!-- You might want to create an issue template for bugs and errors that can be used as a guide and that defines the structure of the information to be included. If you do so, reference it here in the description. -->\n\n### Suggesting Enhancements\n\nThis section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for gptcommit, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.\n\n<!-- omit in toc -->\n#### Before Submitting an Enhancement\n\n- Make sure that you are using the latest version.\n- Read the [documentation](https://github.com/zurawiki/gptcommit) carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.\n- Perform a [search](https://github.com/zurawiki/gptcommit/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.\n- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just targeting a minority of users, consider writing an add-on/plugin library.\n\n<!-- omit in toc -->\n#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?\n\nEnhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/zurawiki/gptcommit/issues).\n\n- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.\n- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.\n- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.\n- You may want to **include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux. <!-- this should only be included if the project has a GUI -->\n- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most gptcommit users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.\n\n<!-- You might want to create an issue template for enhancement suggestions that can be used as a guide and that defines the structure of the information to be included. If you do so, reference it here in the description. -->\n\n### Your First Code Contribution\n\nThis project is written as one or more Cargo crates. See the Rust website for setting up your development environment.\n\n<https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started>\n\nFor running commands, we use the [`just`](https://just.systems/man/en/) runner.\n\nSome commands to know:\n\n- `just run` or `just r [...]` to run the main binary\n\n- `just test` or `just t` to run all tests\n\n- `just fix` to format code and address and any lint issues before uploading your changes.\n\n### Improving The Documentation\n\nDocumentation lives in README.md and in the source code. Code documentation is handled by `rustdoc`, a tool that ships with the Rust toolchain. Find the documentation below:\n\n<https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/what-is-rustdoc.html>\n\n## Styleguides\n\nUse `just fix` to format code and address and any lint issues before uploading your changes.\n\nWe use `rust fmt` and `clippy` with a default configuration.\n\n### Commit Messages\n\nCommit messages should follow \"The Seven Rules of a great Git commit message\" listed in <https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#seven-rules>\n\n<!-- omit in toc -->\n## Attribution\n\nThis guide is based on the **contributing-gen**. [Make your own](https://github.com/bttger/contributing-gen)!\n"

With this tool, you can easily generate clear, comprehensive and descriptive commit messages letting you focus on writing code.\n\nSee [announcement blog post](https://zura.wiki/post/never-write-a-commit-message-again-with-the-help-of-gpt-3/).\n\n## Demo\n\n[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/552380.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/552380)\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Install this tool locally with `cargo` (recommended).\n\n```sh\ncargo install --locked gptcommit\n```\n\nor on macOS, use homebrew\n\n```sh\nbrew install zurawiki/brews/gptcommit\n```\n\n2. In your `git` repository, run the following command to install `gptcommit` as a git prepare-commit-msg hook. You will need to provide an OpenAI API key to complete the installation.\n\n```\ngptcommit install\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nTo use `gptcommit`, simply run `git commit` as you normally would. The hook will automatically generate a commit message for you using a large language model like GPT. If you're not satisfied with the generated message, you can always edit it before committing.\n\nNote: By default, `gptcommit` uses the GPT-3 model. Please ensure you have sufficient credits in your OpenAI account to use it.\n\n## Features\n\n`gptcommit` supports a number of configuration options that are read from `$HOME/.config/gptcommit/config.toml`.\nConfigs are applied in the following order:\n\n- User settings as read from `$HOME/.config/gptcommit/config.toml`.\n- The settings as read from the repo clone at `$GIT_ROOT/.git/gptcommit.toml`.\n- Environment variables starting with `GPTCOMMIT__*`.\n\nSee all the config options available with `gptcommit config keys`.\n\n### Set your OpenAI API key\n\nPersist your OpenAI key\n\n```sh\ngptcommit config set openai.api_key sk-...\n```\n\nor set it just for you local repo:\n\n```sh\ngptcommit config set --local openai.api_key sk-...\n```\n\nYou can also config this setting via the `GPTCOMMIT__OPENAI__API_KEY`.\n\nTo maintain compatibility with other OpenAI clients, we support the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variables. This will take the highest precedence.\n\n### Set a custom OpenAI API base URL\n\nPersist your OpenAI key\n\n```sh\ngptcommit config set openai.api_base https://...\n```\n\nor set it just for you local repo:\n\n```sh\ngptcommit config set --local openai.api_base https://...\n```\n\nYou can also config this setting via the `GPTCOMMIT__OPENAI__API_BASE` or .\n\nTo maintain compatibility with other OpenAI clients, we support the `OPENAI_API_BASE` environment variables. This will take the highest precedence.\n\n### Try out a different OpenAI model\n\n`gptcommit` uses `text-davinci-003` by default. The model can be configured to use other models as below\n\n```sh\ngptcommit config set openai.model text-davinci-002\n```\n\nYou can also config this setting via the `GPTCOMMIT__OPENAI__MODEL`.\n\nFor a list of public OpenAI models, checkout the [OpenAI docs](https://beta.openai.com/docs/models/overview). You can also bring in your own fine-tuned model.\n\n### Set summarizing language\n\n`gptcommit` uses English by default. The language can be configured to use other languages as below\n\n```sh\ngptcommit config set output.lang zh-cn\n```\n\nNow, supported languages are:\n|locale code|language|\n|-|-|\n|`en`|English|\n|`zh-cn`|简体中文|\n|`zh-tw`|繁體中文|\n|`ja`|日本語|\n\n### Allow re-summarizing when amending commits\n\n```sh\ngptcommit config set allow-amend true\n```\n\n### Proxy configuration support\n\nConfigure an OpenAI proxy using\n\n```sh\ngptcommit config set openai.proxy \"my_http_proxy....\"\n```\n\n## Common Issues / FAQs\n\n### How can I reduce my OpenAI usage bill?\n\nIn the current design, gptcommit issues N+2 prompts, where N is the number of modified files with diffs under the max_token_limit. The other prompts are the title and summary.\n\nOpenAI Completions are billed by \"tokens\" that are both sent and generated. Pricing per token depends on the model used. The number of tokens generated are generally predictable (as a commit message is usually only so big) but gptcommit could be sending over a lot of tokens in the form of diff data.\n\nToday, I see two low-hanging solutions for reducing cost:\n\n- Switch to a different model using the openai.model configuration option\n- Reduce the side of prompts and diff data sent to OpenAI\n\nOpenAI's pricing page can be found at\n<https://openai.com/api/pricing/#faq-completions-pricing>\n\n### The githook is not running when I commit\n\nBy default, the githook is only run for new commits.\nIf a template is set or the commit is being amended, the githook will skip by default.\n\nBecause the githook detected the user is supplying their own template, we make sure not to overwrite it with GPT. You can remove the commit template by making sure `git config --local commit.template` is blank.\n\nYou can allow gptcommit to summarize amended commits with the following configuration above.\n\n### Installing in GitHub codespaces\n\nYou'll need to install Rust and the cargo toolchain first. Remember to configure your API key.\n\n```sh\ncurl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh\nbash\ncargo install --locked gptcommit\n\n# insert your openai api key https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys\ngptcommit config set openai.api_key # sk-...\n```\n\n## Derived Works\n\nAll of these awesome projects are built using `gptcommit`.\n\n- A VSCode extension you can\n    [install here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pwwang.gptcommit) | [GitHub](https://github.com/pwwang/vscode-gptcommit)\n\n## Encountered any bugs?\n\nIf you encounter any bugs or have any suggestions for improvements, please open an issue on the repository.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the [MIT License](./LICENSE).\n\n---\n\n## Detailed Help Usage\n\n```\n$ gptcommit -h\nUsage: gptcommit [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>\n\nCommands:\n  install             Install the git hook\n  uninstall           Uninstall the git hook\n  config              Read and modify settings\n  prepare-commit-msg  Run on the prepare-commit-msg hook\n  help                Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)\n\nOptions:\n  -v, --verbose  Enable verbose logging\n  -h, --help     Print help\n  -V, --version  Print version\n```\n\n```\n$ gptcommit install -h\nInstall the git hook\n\nUsage: gptcommit install [OPTIONS]\n\nOptions:\n  -v, --verbose  Enable verbose logging\n  -h, --help     Print help\n  -V, --version  Print version\n```\n\n```\n$ gptcommit uninstall -h\nUninstall the git hook\n\nUsage: gptcommit uninstall [OPTIONS]\n\nOptions:\n  -v, --verbose  Enable verbose logging\n  -h, --help     Print help\n  -V, --version  Print version\n```\n\n```\n$ gptcommit config -h\nRead and modify settings\n\nUsage: gptcommit config [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>\n\nCommands:\n  keys    List all config keys\n  list    List all config values\n  get     Read a config value\n  set     Set a config value\n  delete  Clear a config value\n  help    Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)\n\nOptions:\n  -v, --verbose  Enable verbose logging\n  -h, --help     Print help\n  -V, --version  Print version\n```\n\n```\n$ gptcommit config keys\nallow_amend\nfile_ignore\nmodel_provider\nopenai.api_base\nopenai.api_key\nopenai.model\nopenai.proxy\nopenai.retries\noutput.conventional_commit\noutput.conventional_commit_prefix_format\noutput.lang\noutput.show_per_file_summary\nprompt.commit_summary\nprompt.commit_title\nprompt.conventional_commit_prefix\nprompt.file_diff\nprompt.translation\n```\n"
