[gRPC](http://www.grpc.io) is a high performance, open source universal RPC framework that puts mobile and HTTP/2 first.\n\n[![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/grpcio.svg?maxAge=2592000)](https://crates.io/crates/grpcio)\n[![docs.rs](https://docs.rs/grpcio/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/grpcio)\n[![Build Status](https://github.com/tikv/grpc-rs/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tikv/grpc-rs/actions)\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tikv/grpc-rs.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/tikv/grpc-rs)\n\n## Status\n\nThis project is still under development. The following features with the check marks are supported:\n\n- [x] Basic asynchronous unary/steaming call\n- [x] SSL\n- [x] Generic call\n- [x] Connection level compression\n- [x] Interoperability test\n- [x] QPS benchmark\n- [ ] Custom metadata\n- [x] Health check\n- [ ] Reflection\n- [X] Authentication\n- [ ] Load balance, client side is fully supported, server side load report is not implemented yet.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- CMake >= 3.8.0\n- Rust >= 1.36.0\n- binutils >= 2.22\n- LLVM and Clang >= 3.9 if you need to generate bindings at compile time.\n\nFor Linux and MacOS, you also need to install gcc 7.3+ (or clang 6+) too.\n\nBindings are pre-generated for x86_64/arm64 Linux. For other platforms, bindings are generated at compile time.\n\nFor Windows, you also need to install following software:\n\n- Active State Perl\n- yasm\n- Visual Studio 2015+\n\n## Build\n\n```\n$ cargo xtask submodule # if you just cloned the repository\n$ cargo build\n```\n\n### Error linking OpenSSL\n\nIf you're getting linker errors when building your project using `gRPC-rs`, head\ndown to the `openssl` feature section for a possible fix.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo generate the sources from proto files:\n\n### Option 1 - Manual Generation\n\n1. Install the protobuf compiler:\n\n```\n$ cargo install protobuf-codegen\n```\n\n2. Install the gRPC compiler:\n\n```\n$ cargo install grpcio-compiler\n```\n\n3. Generate the sources:\n\n```\n$ protoc --rust_out=. --grpc_out=. --plugin=protoc-gen-grpc=`which grpc_rust_plugin` example.proto\n```\n\n\n### Option 2 - Programmatic Generation\n\nProgrammatic generation can be used to generate Rust modules from proto files\nvia your `build.rs` by using [protoc-grpcio](https://crates.io/crates/protoc-grpcio).\n\nFor more information and examples see\n[README](https://github.com/mtp401/protoc-grpcio/blob/master/README.md).\n\nTo include this project as a dependency:\n\n```\n[dependencies]\ngrpcio = \"0.13\"\n```\n\n### Feature `boringssl`\n\n`boringssl` feature enables support for TLS encryption and some authentication\nmechanism. When you do not need it, for example when working in intranet,\nyou can disable it by using the following configuration:\n```\n[dependencies]\ngrpcio = { version = \"0.13\", default-features = false, features = [\"protobuf-codec\"] }\n```\n\n### Feature `prost-codec` and `protobuf-codec`\n\n`gRPC-rs` uses `protobuf` crate by default. If you want to use `prost` instead, you can enable\n`prost-codec` feature. You probably only want to enable only one of the two features. Though\ngrpcio is completely fine with both features enabled at the same time, grpcio-compiler\nwill not going to work as expected.\n\n### Feature `openssl` and `openssl-vendored`\n\n`gRPC-rs` comes vendored with `gRPC Core`, which by default uses BoringSSL\ninstead of OpenSSL. This may cause linking issues due to symbol clashes and/or\nmissing symbols when another one of your dependencies uses OpenSSL. To resolve\nthis, you can tell `gRPC-rs` to use OpenSSL too by specifying `\"openssl\"` in\nyour `Cargo.toml`'s features list for `gprcio`, which requires openssl (>=1.0.2). E.g.:\n\n```toml\n[dependencies]\ngrpcio = { version = \"0.13\", features = [\"openssl\"] }\n```\n\nFeature `openssl-vendored` is the same as feature `openssl` except it will build openssl from\nbundled sources.\n\n## Performance\n\nSee [benchmark](https://github.com/tikv/grpc-rs/tree/master/benchmark) to find out how to run a benchmark by yourself.\n\nCross Compile\n-------------\nSee [cross_compile](cross_compile.md)\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nMake sure to format and test the code before sending a PR.\n\nIf the content in grpc-sys/grpc is updated, you may need to regenerate bindings:\n\n```\n$ cargo xtask bindgen\n```\n"
