Velocity\nhas slowed down a bit in recent months, we're still hoping to finish the new\nresolver and the new formatter in the near future.\n\nIt has 97 commits from 10 contributors. Selected changes:\n\n**Features**:\n\n- Add a option to the experimental documentation generator to output the docs in\n  HTML format. The option is given using the `--format=html` option.\n  (@vanillajonathan, 4791)\n\n- The version of the library is now read from `git describe`. This doesn't\n  affect libraries built on git tags (such as our releases), only those built\n  when developing. When reporting bugs, this helps identify the exact version.\n  (@max-sixty & @m-span, #4804)\n\n**Fixes**:\n\n- Raw strings (`r\"...\"`) are retained through `prqlc fmt` (@max-sixty, #4848)\n\n- Strings containing an odd contiguous number of quotes are now delimited by an\n  odd number of quotes when being formatted. The previous implementation would\n  use an even number, which is invalid PRQL. (@max-sixty, #4850)\n\n- A few more keywords are quoted, such as `user`, which is a reserved keyword in\n  PostgreSQL. (@max-sixty)\n\n## 0.13.0 — 2024-07-25\n\n0.13.0 brings a new debug logging framework, a big refactor of the parser, a new\nhighlighter, an `**` operator for exponentiation, a few bug fixes, and lots of\nother changes. It has 153 commits from 11 contributors.\n\nOur work continues on rewriting the resolver and completing `prqlc fmt`.\n\nSelected changes:\n\n**Language**:\n\n- Parentheses are always required around pipelines, even within tuples. For\n  example:\n\n  ```prql no-eval\n  from artists\n  # These parentheses are now required\n  derive {a=(b | math.abs)}\n  # No change — doesn't affect expressions or function calls without pipelines\n  derive {x = 3 + 4}\n  ```\n\n  This is a small breaking change. The new behavior matches the existing\n  documentation. (@max-sixty, #4775)\n\n- A new `**` operator for exponentiation. (@aljazerzen & @max-sixty, #4125)\n\n**Features**:\n\n- `prqlc compile --debug-log=log.html` will generate an HTML file with a\n  detailed log of the compilation process. (@aljazerzen, #4646)\n- Added `prqlc debug json-schema` command to auto-generate JSON Schema\n  representations of commonly exposed IR types such as PL and RQ. (@kgutwin,\n  #4698)\n- Add documentation comments to the output of the documentation generator.\n  (@vanillajonathan, #4729)\n- Add CLI syntax highlighting to `prqlc`. You can try it as\n  `prqlc experimental highlight example.prql`. (@vanillajonathan, #4755)\n\n**Fixes**:\n\n- Using `in` with an empty array pattern (e.g. `expr | in []`) will now output a\n  constant `false` condition instead of an `expr IN ()`, which is syntactically\n  invalid in some SQL dialects (@Globidev, #4598)\n\n**Integrations**:\n\n- The Snap package previously released on the edge channel is now released on\n  the stable channel. (@vanillajonathan, #4784)\n\n**Internal changes**:\n\n- Major reorganization of `prqlc-parser` — `prqlc-ast` is merged into\n  `prqlc-parser`, and `prqlc-parser`'s files are rearranged, including its\n  exports. This is part of an effort to modularize the compiler by stage,\n  reducing the amount of context that's required to understand a single stage.\n  There will likely be some further changes (more detail in the PR description).\n  (@m-span, #4634)\n\n  - This is a breaking change for any libraries that depend on `prqlc-parser`\n    (which should be fairly rare).\n\n- Renamed `prql-compiler-macros` to `prqlc-macros` for consistency with other\n  crates (@max-sixty, #4565)\n\n- `prql-compiler`, the old name for `prqlc`, is removed as a facade to `prqlc`.\n  It had been deprecated for a few versions and will no longer be updated.\n  (@max-sixty)\n\n- New benchmarks (@max-sixty, #4654)\n\n**New Contributors**:\n\n- @Globidev, with #4598\n\n## 0.12.2 — 2024-06-10\n\n0.12.2 is a very small release which renames `prql-js` to `prqlc-js` to match\nour standard naming scheme. Within node the package is imported as `prqlc`.\n\nIt also fixes a mistake in the `prqlc-python` release pipeline.\n\n## 0.12.1 — 2024-06-09\n\n0.12.1 is a tiny hotfix release which fixes how intra-prql crate dependencies\nwere specified.\n\n## 0.12.0 — 2024-06-08\n\n0.12.0 contains a few months of smaller features. Our focus has been on\nrewriting the resolver, an effort that is still ongoing.\n\nIt has 239 commits from 12 contributors. Selected changes (most are not listed\nhere, possibly we should be more conscientious about adding them...):\n\n**Features**:\n\n- Add `prqlc lex` command to the CLI (@max-sixty)\n- Add `prqlc debug lineage` command to the CLI, creating an expression lineage\n  graph from a query (@kgutwin, #4533)\n- Initial implementation of an experimental documentation generator that\n  generates Markdown documentation from `.prql` files. (@vanillajonathan,\n  #4152).\n- Join's `side` parameter can take a reference that resolves to a literal (note:\n  this is an experimental feature which may change in the future) (@kgutwin,\n  #4499)\n\n**Fixes**:\n\n- Support expressions on left hand side of `std.in` operator. (@kgutwin, #4498)\n- Prevent panic for `from {}` and `std` (@m-span, #4538)\n\n**Web**:\n\n- The `browser` dist files are now built with `wasm-pack`'s `web` target. As a\n  result, they should be usable as ES Modules, through JS CDNs, and for example\n  with Observable Framework (@srenatus, #4274).\n\n**Integrations**:\n\n- The syntax highlighter package for Sublime Text is now\n  [published](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/PRQL) (@vanillajonathan).\n- The\n  [VSCode Great Icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=emmanuelbeziat.vscode-great-icons)\n  icon pack extension shows a database icon for `.prql` files. (@EmmanuelBeziat)\n- [Tokei](https://github.com/XAMPPRocky/tokei), a source lines of code counter\n  now has support for `.prql` files. (@vanillajonathan)\n- Add syntax highlight file for the [micro](https://micro-editor.github.io/)\n  text editor. (@vanillajonathan)\n\n**New Contributors**:\n\n- @srenatus, with #4274\n- @jacquayj, with #4332\n- @pdelewski, with #4337\n- @m-span, with #4422\n- @kgutwin, with #4498\n\n## 0.11.4 — 2024-02-25\n\n0.11.4 is a hotfix release, fixing a CI issue that caused the CLI binaries to be\nbuilt without the `cli` feature.\n\n## 0.11.3 — 2024-02-10\n\n0.11.3 is a very small release, mostly a rename of the Python bindings.\n\nThe release has 13 commits from 4 contributors.\n\n**Internal changes**:\n\n- As part of making our names more consistent, the Python bindings are renamed.\n  `prql-python` becomes a package published and importable as `prqlc`. The\n  internal Rust crate is named `prqlc-python`.\n\n## 0.11.2 — 2024-02-07\n\n0.11.2 contains lots of internal changes, lots of syntax highlighting, and the\nbeginning of `lutra`, a query runner.\n\nThis release has 122 commits from 9 contributors. Selected changes:\n\n**Features**:\n\n- Initial implementation of `lutra`, a query runner. (@aljazerzen, #4182, #4174,\n  #4134)\n- `prqlc fmt` works on projects with multiple files. (@max-sixty, #4028)\n\n**Fixes**:\n\n- Reduce stack memory usage (@aljazerzen, #4103)\n\n**Integrations**:\n\n- Add syntax highlight file for GtkSourceView. (@vanillajonathan, #4062)\n- Add syntax highlight file for CotEditor. (@vanillajonathan)\n- Add syntax highlight file for Sublime Text. (@vanillajonathan, #4127)\n- [sloc](https://github.com/flosse/sloc), a source lines of code counter now has\n  support for `.prql` files. (@vanillajonathan)\n\n**Internal changes**:\n\n- `prql-compiler` has been renamed to `prqlc`, and we've established a more\n  consistent naming scheme. The existing crate will still be published,\n  re-exporting `prqlc`, so no dependencies will break. A future version will add\n  a deprecation warning.\n- The `prqlc-clib` crate was renamed to `prqlc-c`, and associated artifacts were\n  renamed. We're trying to make names consistent (ideally for the final time!),\n  and have a plan to rename some other bindings. (@max-sixty, #4077)\n- Add lots of whitespace items to the lexer, in preparation for the completion\n  of `prqlc fmt` (@max-sixty, #4109, #4105)\n- Table declarations (@aljazerzen, #4126)\n\n**New Contributors**:\n\n- @kaspermarstal, with #4124\n\n## 0.11.1 — 2023-12-26\n\n0.11.1 fixes a couple of small bugs; it comes a few days after 0.11.\n\nThis release has 16 commits from 6 contributors. Selected changes:\n\n**Features**:\n\n- Infer the type of array literals to be the union of types of its items.\n  (@aljazerzen, #3989)\n- `prql` module is added and the `prql_version` function is renamed to the\n  `prql.version` function. The old `prql_version` function is deprecated and\n  will be removed in the future release.

The\nrelease has 77 commits from 8 contributors. Selected changes are below.\n\nLook out for some conference talks coming up over the next few weeks, including\n[QCon SF on Oct 2](https://qconsf.com/presentation/oct2023/prql-simple-powerful-pipelined-sql-replacement)\nand\n[date2day on Oct 12](https://www.data2day.de/veranstaltung-21353-0-prql-a-modern-language-for-data-transformation.html).\n\n**Language**:\n\n- A new line-wrapping character, for lines that are long and we want to break up\n  into multiple physical lines. This is slightly different from from many\n  languages — it's on the subsequent line:\n\n  ```prql no-eval\n  from artists\n  select is_europe =\n  \\ country == \"DE\"\n  \\ || country == \"FR\"\n  \\ || country == \"ES\"\n  ```\n\n  This allows for easily commenting out physical lines while maintaining a\n  correct logical line; for example:\n\n  ```diff\n  from artists\n  select is_europe =\n  \\ country == \"DE\"\n  \\ || country == \"FR\"\n  \\ || country == \"FR\"\n  -\\ || country == \"ES\"\n  +#\\ || country == \"ES\"\n  ```\n\n  (@max-sixty, #3408)\n\n**Fixes**:\n\n- Fix stack overflow on very long queries in Windows debug builds (@max-sixty,\n  #2908)\n\n- Fix panic when unresolved lineage appears in group or window (@davidot, #3266)\n\n- Fix a corner-case in handling precedence, and remove unneeded parentheses in\n  some outputs (@max-sixty, #3472)\n\n**Web**:\n\n- Compiler panics are now printed to the console (@max-sixty, #3446)\n\n**Integrations**:\n\n- [Ace](https://ace.c9.io/), the JavaScript code editor now has syntax\n  highlighting for PRQL. (@vanillajonathan, #3493)\n\n**Internal changes**:\n\n- Simplify & speed up lexer (@max-sixty, #3426, #3418)\n\n**New Contributors**:\n\n- @davidot, with #3450\n\n## 0.9.4 — 2023-08-24\n\n0.9.4 is a small release with some improvements and bug fixes in the compiler\nand `prqlc`. And, the documentation and CI are continually being improved.\n\nThis release has 110 commits from 9 contributors. Selected changes:\n\n**Features**:\n\n- Strings can be delimited with any odd number of quote characters. The logic\n  for lexing quotes is now simpler and slightly faster. Escapes in\n  single-quote-delimited strings escape single-quotes rather than double-quotes.\n  (@max-sixty, #3274)\n\n**Fixes**:\n\n- S-strings within double braces now parse correctly (@max-sixty, #3265)\n\n**Documentation**:\n\n- New docs for strings (@max-sixty, #3281)\n\n**Web**:\n\n- Improve syntax highlighting for numbers in the book & website (@max-sixty,\n  #3261)\n- Add ClickHouse integration to docs (@max-sixty, #3251)\n\n**Integrations**:\n\n- `prqlc` no longer displays a prompt when piping a query into its stdin\n  (@max-sixty, #3248).\n- Add a minimal example for use `prql-lib` with Zig (@vanillajonathan, #3372)\n\n**Internal changes**:\n\n- Overhaul our CI to run a cohesive set of tests depending on the specific\n  changes in the PR, and elide all others. This cuts CI latency to less than\n  three minutes for most changes, and enables GitHub's auto-merge to wait for\n  all relevant tests. It also reduces the CI time on merging to main, by moving\n  some tests to only run on specific path changes or on our nightly run.\n\n  We now have one label we can add to PRs to run more tests — `pr-nightly`.\n  (@max-sixty, #3317 & others).\n\n- Auto-merge PRs for backports or pre-commit updates (@max-sixty, #3246)\n- Add a workflow to create an issue when the scheduled nightly workflow fails\n  (@max-sixty, #3304)\n\n**New Contributors**:\n\n- @FinnRG, with #3292\n- @sitiom, with #3353\n\n## 0.9.3 — 2023-08-02\n\n0.9.3 is a small release, with mostly documentation, internal, and CI changes.\n\nThis release has 85 commits from 10 contributors.\n\nWe'd like to welcome @not-my-profile as someone who has helped with lots of\ninternal refactoring in the past couple of weeks.\n\n**New Contributors**:\n\n- @vthriller, with #3171\n- @postmeback, with #3216\n\n## 0.9.2 — 2023-07-25\n\n0.9.2 is a hotfix release to fix an issue in the 0.9.0 & 0.9.1 release\npipelines.\n\n## 0.9.1 — 2023-07-25\n\n0.9.1 is a hotfix release to fix an issue in the 0.9.0 release pipeline.\n\n## 0.9.0 — 2023-07-24\n\n0.9.0 is probably PRQL's biggest ever release. We have dialect-specific\nstandard-libraries, a regex operator, an initial implementation of multiple-file\nprojects & modules, lots of bug fixes, and many many internal changes.\n\nWe've made a few backward incompatible syntax changes. Most queries will work\nwith a simple find/replace; see below for details.\n\nThe release has 421 commits from 12 contributors.\n\nA small selection of the changes:\n\n**Language**:\n\n- The major breaking change is a new syntax for lists, which have been renamed\n  to _tuples_, and are now represented with braces `{}` rather than brackets\n  `[]`.\n\n  To convert previous PRQL queries to this new syntax simply change `[ ... ]` to\n  `{ ... }`.\n\n  We made the syntax change to incorporate arrays. Almost every major language\n  uses `[]` for arrays. We are adopting that convention — arrays use `[]`,\n  tuples will use `{}`. (Though we recognize that `{}` for tuples is also rare\n  (Hi, Erlang!), but didn't want to further load parentheses with meaning.)\n\n  Arrays are conceptually similar to columns — their elements have a single\n  type. Array syntax can't contain assignments.\n\n  As part of this, we've also formalized tuples as containing both individual\n  items (`select {foo, baz}`), and assignments (`select {foo=bar, baz=fuz}`).\n\n- Some significant changes regarding SQL dialects:\n\n  - Operators and functions can be defined on per-dialect basis. (@aljazerzen,\n    #2681)\n  - _Breaking_: The `sql.duckdb` target supports DuckDB 0.8 (@eitsupi, #2810).\n  - _Breaking_: The `sql.hive` target is removed (@eitsupi, #2837).\n\n- New arithmetic operators. These compile to different function or operator\n  depending on the target.\n\n  - _Breaking_: Operator `/` now always performs floating division (@aljazerzen,\n    #2684). See the\n    [Division docs](https://prql-lang.org/book/reference/syntax/operators.html#division-and-integer-division)\n    for details.\n\n  - Truncated integer division operator `//` (@aljazerzen, #2684). See the\n    [Division docs](https://prql-lang.org/book/reference/syntax/operators.html#division-and-integer-division)\n    for details.\n\n  - Regex search operator `~=` (@max-sixty, #2458). An example:\n\n    ```prql no-eval\n    from tracks\n    filter (name ~= \"Love\")\n    ```\n\n    ...compiles to;\n\n    ```sql\n    SELECT\n      *\n    FROM\n      tracks\n    WHERE\n      REGEXP(name, 'Love')\n    ```\n\n    ...though the exact form differs by dialect; see the\n    [Regex docs](https://prql-lang.org/book/reference/syntax/operators.html#regex)\n    for more details.\n\n- New aggregation functions: `every`, `any`, `average`, and `concat_array`.\n  _Breaking:_ Remove `avg` in favor of `average`.\n\n- _Breaking:_ We've changed our function declaration syntax to match other\n  declarations. Functions were one of the first language constructs in PRQL, and\n  since then we've added normal declarations there's no compelling reason for\n  functions to be different.\n\n  ```prql no-eval\n  let add = a b -> a + b\n  ```\n\n  Previously, this was:\n\n  ```prql no-eval\n  func add a b -> a + b\n  ```\n\n- Experimental modules, which allow importing declarations from other files.\n  Docs are forthcoming.\n\n- Relation literals create a relation (a \"table\") as an _array_ of _tuples_.\n  This example demonstrates the new syntax for arrays `[]` and tuples `{}`.\n  (@aljazerzen, #2605)\n\n  ```prql no-eval\n  from [{a=5, b=false}, {a=6, b=true}]\n  filter b == true\n  select a\n  ```\n\n- `this` can be used to refer to the current pipeline, for situations where\n  plain column name would be ambiguous:\n\n  ```prql no-eval\n  from x\n  derive sum = my_column\n  select this.sum   # does not conflict with `std.sum`\n  ```\n\n  Within a `join` transform, there is also a reference to the right relation:\n  `that`.\n\n- _Breaking:_ functions `count`, `rank` and `row_number` now require an argument\n  of the array to operate on. In most cases you can directly replace `count`\n  with `count this`. The `non_null` argument of `count` has been removed.\n\n**Features**:\n\n- We've changed how we handle colors.\n\n  `Options::color` is deprecated and has no effect. Code which consumes\n  `prql_compiler::compile` should instead accept the output with colors and use\n  a library such as `anstream` to handle the presentation of colors. To ensure\n  minimal disruption, `prql_compiler` will currently strip color codes when a\n  standard environment variable such as `CLI_COLOR=0` is set or when it detects\n  `stderr` is not a TTY.\n\n  We now use the [`anstream`](https://github.com/rust-cli/anstyle) library in\n  `prqlc` & `prql-compiler`.\n\n  (@max-sixty, #2773)\n\n- `prqlc` can now show backtraces when the standard backtrace env var\n  (`RUST_BACKTRACE`) is active. (@max-sixty, #2751)\n\n**Fixes**:\n\n- Numbers expressed with scientific notation — `1e9` — are now handled correctly\n  by the compiler (@max-sixty, #2865).\n\n**Integrations**:\n\n- prql-python now provides type hints (@philpep, #2912)\n\n**Internal changes**:\n\n- Annotations in PRQL. These have limited support but are currently used to\n  specify binding strengths. They're modeled after Rust's annotations, but with\n  `@` syntax, more similar to traditional decorators. (#2729)\n\n  ```prql no-eval\n  @{binding_strength=11}\n  let mod = l r -> s\"{l} % {r}\"\n  ```\n\n- Remove BigQuery's special handling of quoted identifiers, now that our module\n  system handles its semantics (@max-sixty, #2609).\n\n- ClickHouse is tested in CI (@eitsupi, #2815).\n\n**New Contributors**:\n\n- @maxmcd, with #2533\n- @khoa165, with #2876\n- @philpep, with #2912\n- @not-my-profile, with #2971\n\n## 0.8.1 — 2023-04-29\n\n0.8.1 is a small release with a new `list-targets` command in `prqlc`, some\ndocumentation improvements, and some internal improvements.\n\nThis release has 41 commits from 8 contributors.\n\nFrom the broader perspective of the project, we're increasing the relative\nprioritization of it being easy for folks to actually use PRQL — either with\nexisting tools, or a tool we'd build. We'll be thinking about & discussing the\nbest way to do that over the next few weeks.\n\n## 0.8.0 — 2023-04-14\n\n0.8.0 renames the `and` & `or` operators to `&&` & `||` respectively,\nreorganizes the Syntax section in the book, and introduces `read_parquet` &\n`read_csv` functions for reading files with DuckDB.\n\nThis release has 38 commits from 8 contributors. Selected changes:\n\n**Features**:\n\n- Rename `and` to `&&` and `or` to `||`. Operators which are symbols are now\n  consistently infix, while \"words\" are now consistently functions (@aljazerzen,\n  #2422).\n\n- New functions `read_parquet` and `read_csv`, which mirror the DuckDB\n  functions, instructing the database to read from files (@max-sixty, #2409).\n\n## 0.7.1 — 2023-04-03\n\n0.7.1 is a hotfix release to fix `prql-js`'s `npm install` behavior when being\ninstalled as a dependency.\n\nThis release has 17 commits from 4 contributors.\n\n## 0.7.0 — 2023-04-01\n\n0.7.0 is a fairly small release in terms of new features, with lots of internal\nimprovements, such as integration tests with a whole range of DBs, a blog post\non Pi day, RFCs for a type system, and more robust language bindings.\n\nThere's a very small breaking change to the Rust API, hence the minor version\nbump.\n\nHere's our April 2023 Update, from our\n[Readme](https://github.com/PRQL/prql/blob/main/README.md):\n\n> ### April 2023 update\n>\n> PRQL is being actively developed by a growing community. It's ready to use by\n> the intrepid, either as part of one of our supported extensions, or within\n> your own tools, using one of our supported language bindings.\n>\n> PRQL still has some minor bugs and some missing features, and probably is only\n> ready to be rolled out to non-technical teams for fairly simple queries.\n>\n> Here's our current [Roadmap](https://prql-lang.org/roadmap/) and our\n> [Milestones.](https://github.com/PRQL/prql/milestones)\n>\n> Our immediate focus for the code is on:\n>\n> - Building out the next few big features, including\n>   [types](https://github.com/PRQL/prql/pull/1964) and\n>   [modules](https://github.com/PRQL/prql/pull/2129).\n> - Ensuring our supported features feel extremely robust; resolving any\n>   [priority bugs](https://github.com/PRQL/prql/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug+label%3Apriority).\n>\n> We're also spending time thinking about:\n>\n> - Making it really easy to start using PRQL. We're doing that by building\n>   integrations with tools that folks already use; for example our VS Code\n>   extension & Jupyter integration. If there are tools you're familiar with\n>   that you think would be open to integrating with PRQL, please let us know in\n>   an issue.\n> - Making it easier to contribute to the compiler. We have a wide group of\n>   contributors to the project, but contributions to the compiler itself are\n>   quite concentrated. We're keen to expand this;\n>   [#1840](https://github.com/PRQL/prql/issues/1840) for feedback.\n\n---\n\nThe release has 131 commits from 10 contributors. Particular credit goes to to\n@eitsupi & @jelenkee, who have made significant contributions, and\n@vanillajonathan, whose prolific contribution include our growing language\nbindings.\n\nA small selection of the changes:\n\n**Features**:\n\n- `prqlc compile` adds `--color` & `--include-signature-comment` options.\n  (@max-sixty, #2267)\n\n**Web**:\n\n- Added the PRQL snippets from the book to the\n  [Playground](https://prql-lang.org/playground/) (@jelenkee, #2197)\n\n**Internal changes**:\n\n- _Breaking_: The `compile` function's `Options` now includes a `color` member,\n  which determines whether error messages use ANSI color codes. This is\n  technically a breaking change to the API. (@max-sixty, #2251)\n- The `Error` struct now exposes the `MessageKind` enum. (@vanillajonathan,\n  #2307)\n- Integration tests run in CI with DuckDB, SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQL\n  Server (@jelenkee, #2286)\n\n**New Contributors**:\n\n- @k-nut, with #2294\n\n## 0.6.1 — 2023-03-12\n\n0.6.1 is a small release containing an internal refactoring and improved\nbindings for C, PHP & .NET.\n\nThis release has 54 commits from 6 contributors. Selected changes:\n\n**Fixes**:\n\n- No longer incorrectly compile to `DISTINCT` when a `take 1` refers to a\n  different set of columns than are in the `group`. (@max-sixty, with thanks to\n  @cottrell, #2109)\n- The version specification of the dependency Chumsky was bumped from `0.9.0` to\n  `0.9.2`. `0.9.0` has a bug that causes an infinite loop. (@eitsupi, #2110)\n\n**Documentation**:\n\n- Add a policy for which bindings are supported / unsupported / nascent. See\n  <https://prql-lang.org/book/project/bindings/index.html> for more details\n  (@max-sixty, #2062) (@max-sixty, #2062)\n\n**Integrations**:\n\n- [prql-lib] Added C++ header file. (@vanillajonathan, #2126)\n\n**Internal changes**:\n\n- Many of the items that were in the root of the repo have been aggregated into\n  `web` & `bindings`, simplifying the repo's structure. There's also `grammars`\n  & `packages` (@max-sixty, #2135, #2117, #2121).\n\n## 0.6.0 — 2023-03-08\n\n0.6.0 introduces a rewritten parser, giving us the ability to dramatically\nimprove error messages, renames `switch` to `case` and includes lots of minor\nimprovements and fixes. It also introduces `loop`, which compiles to\n`WITH RECURSIVE`, as a highly experimental feature.\n\nThere are a few cases of breaking changes, including switching `switch` to\n`case`, in case that's confusing. There are also some minor parsing changes\noutlined below.\n\nThis release has 108 commits from 11 contributors. Selected changes:\n\n**Features**:\n\n- Add a (highly experimental) `loop` language feature, which translates to\n  `WITH RECURSIVE`. We expect changes and refinements in upcoming releases.\n  (#1642, @aljazerzen)\n- Rename the experimental `switch` function to `case` given it more closely\n  matches the traditional semantics of `case`. (@max-sixty, #2036)\n- Change the `case` syntax to use `=>` instead of `->` to distinguish it from\n  function syntax.\n- Convert parser from pest to Chumsky (@aljazerzen, #1818)\n  - Improved error messages, and the potential to make even better in the\n    future. Many of these improvements come from error recovery.\n  - String escapes (`\\n \\t`).\n  - Raw strings that don't escape backslashes.\n  - String interpolations can only contain identifiers and not any expression.\n  - Operator associativity has been changed from right-to-left to left-to-right\n    to be more similar to other conventional languages.\n  - `and` now has a higher precedence than `or` (of same reason as the previous\n    point).\n  - Dates, times and timestamps have stricter parsing rules.\n  - `let`, `func`, `prql`, `case` are now treated as keywords.\n  - Float literals without fraction part are not allowed anymore (`1.`).\n- Add a `--format` option to `prqlc parse` which can return the AST in YAML\n  (@max-sixty, #1962)\n- Add a new subcommand `prqlc jinja`. (@aljazerzen, #1722)\n- _Breaking_: prql-compiler no longer passes text containing `{{` & `}}` through\n  to the output. (@aljazerzen, #1722)\n\n  For example, the following PRQL query\n\n  ```prql no-eval\n  from {{foo}}\n  ```\n\n  was compiled to the following SQL previously, but now it raises an error.\n\n  ```sql\n  SELECT\n    *\n  FROM\n    {{ foo }}\n  ```\n\n  This pass-through feature existed for integration with dbt.\n\n  We're again considering how to best integrate with dbt, and this change is\n  based on the idea that the jinja macro should run before the PRQL compiler.\n\n  If you're interested in dbt integration, subscribe or 👍 to\n  <https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/pull/5982>.\n\n- A new compile target `\"sql.any\"`. When `\"sql.any\"` is used as the target of\n  the compile function's option, the target contained in the query header will\n  be used. (@aljazerzen, #1995)\n- Support for SQL parameters with similar syntax (#1957, @aljazerzen)\n- Allow `:` to be elided in timezones, such as `0800` in\n  `@2020-01-01T13:19:55-0800` (@max-sixty, #1991).\n- Add `std.upper` and `std.lower` functions for changing string casing\n  (@Jelenkee, #2019).\n\n**Fixes**:\n\n- `prqlc compile` returns a non-zero exit code for invalid queries. (@max-sixty,\n  #1924)\n- Identifiers can contain any alphabetic unicode characters (@max-sixty, #2003)\n\n**Documentation**:\n\n- Operator precedence (@aljazerzen, #1818)\n- Error messages for invalid queries are displayed in the book (@max-sixty,\n  #2015)\n\n**Integrations**:\n\n- [prql-php] Added PHP bindings. (@vanillajonathan, #1860)\n- [prql-dotnet] Added .NET bindings. (@vanillajonathan, #1917)\n- [prql-lib] Added C header file. (@vanillajonathan, #1879)\n- Added a workflow building a `.deb` on each release. (Note that it's not yet\n  published on each release). (@vanillajonathan, #1883)\n- Added a workflow building a `.rpm` on each release. (Note that it's not yet\n  published on each release). (@vanillajonathan, #1918)\n- Added a workflow building a Snap package on each release. (@vanillajonathan,\n  #1881)\n\n**Internal changes**:\n\n- Test that the output of our nascent autoformatter can be successfully compiled\n  into SQL. Failing examples are now clearly labeled. (@max-sixty, #2016)\n- Definition files have been added to configure\n  [Dev Containers](https://containers.dev/) for Rust development environment.\n  (@eitsupi, #1893, #2025, #2028)\n\n**New Contributors**:\n\n- @linux-china, with #1971\n- @Jelenkee, with #2019\n\n## 0.5.2 — 2023-02-18\n\n0.5.2 is a tiny release to fix an build issue in yesterday's `prql-js` 0.5.1\nrelease.\n\nThis release has 7 commits from 2 contributors.\n\n**New Contributors**:\n\n- @matthias-Q, with #1873\n\n## 0.5.1 — 2023-02-17\n\n0.5.1 contains a few fixes, and another change to how bindings handle default\ntarget / dialects.\n\nThis release has 53 commits from 7 contributors. Selected changes:\n\n**Fixes**:\n\n- Delegate dividing literal integers to the DB. Previously integer division was\n  executed during PRQL compilation, which could be confusing given that behavior\n  is different across DBs. Other arithmetic operations are still executed during\n  compilation. (@max-sixty, #1747)\n\n**Documentation**:\n\n- Add docs on the `from_text` transform (@max-sixty, #1756)\n\n**Integrations**:\n\n- [prql-js] Default compile target changed from `Sql(Generic)` to `Sql(None)`.\n  (@eitsupi, #1856)\n- [prql-python] Compilation options can now be specified from Python. (@eitsupi,\n  #1807)\n- [prql-python] Default compile target changed from `Sql(Generic)` to\n  `Sql(None)`. (@eitsupi, #1861)\n\n**New Contributors**:\n\n- @vanillajonathan, with #1766\n\n## 0.5.0 — 2023-02-08\n\n0.5.0 contains a few fixes, some improvements to bindings, lots of docs\nimprovements, and some work on forthcoming features. It contains one breaking\nchange in the compiler's `Options` interface.\n\nThis release has 74 commits from 12 contributors. Selected changes:\n\n**Features**:\n\n- Change public API to use target instead of dialect in preparation for feature\n  work (@aljazerzen, #1684)\n\n- `prqlc watch` command which watches filesystem for changes and compiles .prql\n  files to .sql (@aljazerzen, #1708)\n\n**Fixes**:\n\n- Support double brackets in s-strings which aren't symmetric (@max-sixty,\n  #1650)\n- Support Postgres's Interval syntax (@max-sixty, #1649)\n- Fixed tests for `prql-elixir` with macOS (@kasvith, #1707)\n\n**Documentation**:\n\n- Add a documentation test for prql-compiler, update prql-compiler README, and\n  include the README in the prql book section for Rust bindings. The code\n  examples in the README are included and tested as doctests in the\n  prql-compiler (@nkicg6, #1679)\n\n**Internal changes**:\n\n- Add tests for all PRQL website examples to prql-python to ensure compiled\n  results match expected SQL (@nkicg6, #1719)\n\n**New Contributors**:\n\n- @ruslandoga, with #1628\n- @RalfNorthman, with #1632\n- @nicot, with #1662\n\n## 0.4.2 — 2023-01-25\n\n**Features**:\n\n- New `from_text format-arg string-arg` function that supports JSON and CSV\n  formats. _format-arg_ can be `format:csv` or `format:json`. _string-arg_ can\n  be a string in any format. (@aljazerzen & @snth, #1514)\n\n  ```prql no-eval\n  from_text format:csv \"\"\"\n  a,b,c\n  1,2,3\n  4,5,6\n  \"\"\"\n  ```\n\n  ```prql no-eval\n  from_text format:json '''\n      [{\"a\": 1, \"b\": \"x\", \"c\": false }, {\"a\": 4, \"b\": \"y\", \"c\": null }]\n  '''\n  ```\n\n  ```prql no-eval\n  from_text format:json '''{\n      \"columns\": [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"],\n      \"data\": [\n          [1, \"x\", false],\n          [4, \"y\", null]\n      ]\n  }'''\n  ```\n\n  For now, the argument is limited to string constants.\n\n**Fixes**\n\n- Export constructor for SQLCompileOptions (@bcho, #1621)\n- Remove backticks in count_distinct (@aljazerzen, #1611)\n\n**New Contributors**\n\n- @1Kinoti, with #1596\n- @veenaamb, with #1614\n\n## 0.4.1 — 2023-01-18\n\n0.4.1 comes a few days after 0.4.0, with a couple of features and the release of\n`prqlc`, the CLI crate.\n\n0.4.1 has 35 commits from 6 contributors.\n\n**Features**:\n\n- Inferred column names include the relation name (@aljazerzen, #1550):\n\n  ```prql no-eval\n  from albums\n  select title # name used to be inferred as title only\n  select albums.title # so using albums was not possible here\n  ```\n\n- Quoted identifiers such as `dir/*.parquet` are passed through to SQL.\n  (@max-sixty, #1516).\n\n- The CLI is installed with `cargo install prqlc`. The binary was renamed in\n  0.4.0 but required an additional `--features` flag, which has been removed in\n  favor of this new crate (@max-sixty & @aljazerzen, #1549).\n\n**New Contributors**:\n\n- @fool1280, with #1554\n- @nkicg6, with #1567\n\n## 0.4.0 — 2023-01-15\n\n0.4.0 brings lots of new features including `case`, `select ![]` and numbers\nwith underscores. We have initial (unpublished) bindings to Elixir. And there's\nthe usual improvements to fixes & documentation (only a minority are listed\nbelow in this release).\n\n0.4.0 also has some breaking changes: `table` is `let`, `dialect` is renamed to\n`target`, and the compiler's API has changed. Full details below.\n\n**Features**:\n\n- Defining a temporary table is now expressed as `let` rather than `table`\n  (@aljazerzen, #1315). See the\n  [tables docs](https://prql-lang.org/book/reference/declarations/variables.html)\n  for details.\n\n- _Experimental:_ The\n  [`case`](https://prql-lang.org/book/reference/syntax/case.html) function sets\n  a variable to a value based on one of several expressions (@aljazerzen,\n  #1278).\n\n  ```prql no-eval\n  derive var = case [\n    score <= 10 -> \"low\",\n    score <= 30 -> \"medium\",\n    score <= 70 -> \"high\",\n    true -> \"very high\",\n  ]\n  ```\n\n  ...compiles to:\n\n  ```sql\n  SELECT\n    *,\n    CASE\n      WHEN score <= 10 THEN 'low'\n      WHEN score <= 30 THEN 'medium'\n      WHEN score <= 70 THEN 'high'\n      ELSE 'very high'\n    END AS var\n  FROM\n    bar\n  ```\n\n  Check out the\n  [`case` docs](https://prql-lang.org/book/reference/syntax/case.html) for more\n  details.\n\n- _Experimental:_ Columns can be excluded by name with `select` (@aljazerzen,\n  #1329)\n\n  ```prql no-eval\n  from albums\n  select ![title, composer]\n  ```\n\n- _Experimental:_ `append` transform, equivalent to `UNION ALL` in SQL.\n  (@aljazerzen, #894)\n\n  ```prql no-eval\n  from employees\n  append managers\n  ```\n\n  Check out the\n  [`append` docs](https://prql-lang.org/book/reference/stdlib/transforms/append.html)\n  for more details.\n\n- Numbers can contain underscores, which can make reading long numbers easier\n  (@max-sixty, #1467):\n\n  ```prql no-eval\n  from numbers\n  select {\n      small = 1.000_000_1,\n      big = 5_000_000,\n  }\n  ```\n\n- The SQL output contains a comment with the PRQL compiler version (@aljazerzen,\n  #1322)\n- `dialect` is renamed to `target`, and its values are prefixed with `sql.`\n  (@max-sixty, #1388); for example:\n\n  ```prql no-eval\n  prql target:sql.bigquery  # previously was `dialect:bigquery`\n\n  from employees\n  ```\n\n  This gives us the flexibility to target other languages than SQL in the long\n  term.\n\n- Tables definitions can contain a bare s-string (@max-sixty, #1422), which\n  enables us to include a full CTE of SQL, for example:\n\n  ```prql no-eval\n  let grouping = s\"\"\"\n    SELECT SUM(a)\n    FROM tbl\n    GROUP BY\n      GROUPING SETS\n      ((b, c, d), (d), (b, d))\n  \"\"\"\n  ```\n\n- Ranges supplied to `in` can be half-open (@aljazerzen, #1330).\n\n- The crate's external API has changed to allow for compiling to intermediate\n  representation. This also affects bindings. See\n  [`prql-compiler` docs](https://docs.rs/prql-compiler/latest/prql_compiler/)\n  for more details.\n\n**Fixes**:\n\n[This release, the changelog only contains a subset of fixes]\n\n- Allow interpolations in table s-strings (@aljazerzen, #1337)\n\n**Documentation**:\n\n[This release, the changelog only contains a subset of documentation\nimprovements]\n\n- Add docs on aliases in\n  [Select](https://prql-lang.org/book/reference/stdlib/transforms/select.html)\n- Add JS template literal and multiline example (@BCsabaEngine, #1432)\n- JS template literal and multiline example (@BCsabaEngine, #1432)\n- Improve prql-compiler docs & examples (@aljazerzen, #1515)\n- Fix string highlighting in book (@max-sixty, #1264)\n\n**Web**:\n\n- The playground allows querying some sample data. As before, the result updates\n  on every keystroke. (@aljazerzen, #1305)\n\n**Integrations**:\n\n[This release, the changelog only contains a subset of integration improvements]\n\n- Added Elixir integration exposing PRQL functions as NIFs (#1500, @kasvith)\n- Exposed Elixir flavor with exceptions (#1513, @kasvith)\n- Rename `prql-compiler` binary to `prqlc` (@aljazerzen #1515)\n\n**Internal changes**:\n\n[This release, the changelog only contains a subset of internal changes]\n\n- Add parsing for negative select (@max-sixty, #1317)\n- Allow for additional builtin functions (@aljazerzen, #1325)\n- Add an automated check for typos (@max-sixty, #1421)\n- Add tasks for running playground & book (@max-sixty, #1265)\n- Add tasks for running tests on every file change (@max-sixty, #1380)\n\n**New contributors**:\n\n- @EArazli, with #1359\n- @boramalper, with #1362\n- @allurefx, with #1377\n- @bcho, with #1375\n- @JettChenT, with #1385\n- @BlurrechDev, with #1411\n- @BCsabaEngine, with #1432\n- @kasvith, with #1500\n\n## 0.3.1 - 2022-12-03\n\n0.3.1 brings a couple of small improvements and fixes.\n\n**Features**:\n\n- Support for using s-strings for `from` (#1197, @aljazerzen)\n\n  ```prql no-eval\n  from s\"SELECT * FROM employees WHERE foo > 5\"\n  ```\n\n- Helpful error message when referencing a table in an s-string (#1203,\n  @aljazerzen)\n\n**Fixes**:\n\n- Multiple columns with same name created (#1211, @aljazerzen)\n- Renaming via select breaks preceding sorting (#1204, @aljazerzen)\n- Same column gets selected multiple times (#1186, @mklopets)\n\n**Internal**:\n\n- Update Github Actions and Workflows to current version numbers (and avoid\n  using Node 12)\n\n## 0.3.0 — 2022-11-29\n\n🎉 0.3.0 is the biggest ever change in PRQL's compiler, rewriting much of the\ninternals: the compiler now has a semantic understanding of expressions,\nincluding resolving names & building a DAG of column lineage 🎉.\n\nWhile the immediate changes to the language are modest — some long-running bugs\nare fixed — this unlocks the development of many of the project's long-term\npriorities, such as type-checking & auto-complete. And it simplifies the\nbuilding of our next language features, such as match-case expressions, unions &\ntable expressions.\n\n@aljazerzen has (mostly single-handedly) done this work over the past few\nmonths. The project owes him immense appreciation.\n\n**Breaking changes**:\n\nWe've had to make some modest breaking changes for 0.3:\n\n- _Pipelines must start with `from`_. For example, a pipeline with only\n  `derive foo = 5`, with no `from` transform, is no longer valid. Depending on\n  demand for this feature, it would be possible to add this back.\n\n- _Shared column names now require `==` in a join_. The existing approach is\n  ambiguous to the compiler — `id` in the following example could be a boolean\n  column.\n\n  ```diff\n  from employees\n  -join positions [id]\n  +join positions [==id]\n  ```\n\n- _Table references containing periods must be surrounded by backticks_. For\n  example, when referencing a schema name:\n\n  ```diff\n  -from public.sometable\n  +from `public.sometable`\n  ```\n\n**Features**:\n\n- Change self equality op to `==` (#1176, @aljazerzen)\n- Add logging (@aljazerzen)\n- Add clickhouse dialect (#1090, @max-sixty)\n- Allow namespaces & tables to contain `.` (#1079, @aljazerzen)\n\n**Fixes**:\n\n- Deduplicate column appearing in `SELECT` multiple times (#1186, @aljazerzen)\n- Fix uppercase table names (#1184, @aljazerzen)\n- Omit table name when only one ident in SELECT (#1094, @aljazerzen)\n\n**Documentation**:\n\n- Add chapter on semantics' internals (@aljazerzen, #1028)\n- Add note about nesting variables in s-strings (@max-sixty, #1163)\n\n**Internal changes**:\n\n- Flatten group and window (#1120, @aljazerzen)\n- Split ast into expr and stmt (@aljazerzen)\n- Refactor associativity (#1156, @aljazerzen)\n- Rename Ident constructor to `from_name` (#1084, @aljazerzen)\n- Refactor rq folding (#1177, @aljazerzen)\n- Add tests for reported bugs fixes in semantic (#1174, @aljazerzen)\n- Bump duckdb from 0.5.0 to 0.6.0 (#1132)\n- Bump once_cell from 1.15.0 to 1.16.0 (#1101)\n- Bump pest from 2.4.0 to 2.5.0 (#1161)\n- Bump pest_derive from 2.4.0 to 2.5.0 (#1179)\n- Bump sqlparser from 0.25.0 to 0.27.0 (#1131)\n- Bump trash from 2.1.5 to 3.0.0 (#1178)\n\n## 0.2.11 — 2022-11-20\n\n0.2.11 contains a few helpful fixes.\n\nWork continues on our `semantic` refactor — look out for 0.3.0 soon! Many thanks\nto @aljazerzen for his continued contributions to this.\n\nNote: 0.2.10 was skipped due to this maintainer's inability to read his own docs\non bumping versions...\n\n**Features**:\n\n- Detect when compiler version is behind query version (@MarinPostma, #1058)\n- Add `__version__` to prql-python package (@max-sixty, #1034)\n\n**Fixes**:\n\n- Fix nesting of expressions with equal binding strength and left associativity,\n  such as `a - (b - c)` (@max-sixty, #1136)\n- Retain floats without significant digits as floats (@max-sixty, #1141)\n\n**Documentation**:\n\n- Add documentation of `prqlr` bindings (@eitsupi, #1091)\n- Add a 'Why PRQL' section to the website (@max-sixty, #1098)\n- Add @snth to core-devs (@max-sixty, #1050)\n\n**Internal changes**:\n\n- Use workspace versioning (@max-sixty, #1065)\n\n## 0.2.9 — 2022-10-14\n\n0.2.9 is a small release containing a bug fix for empty strings.\n\n**Fixes**:\n\n- Fix parsing of empty strings (@aljazerzen, #1024)\n\n## 0.2.8 — 2022-10-10\n\n0.2.8 is another modest release with some fixes, doc improvements, bindings\nimprovements, and lots of internal changes. Note that one of the fixes causes\nthe behavior of `round` and `cast` to change slightly — though it's handled as a\nfix rather than a breaking change in semantic versioning.\n\n**Fixes**:\n\n- Change order of the `round` & `cast` function parameters to have the column\n  last; for example `round 2 foo_col` / `cast int foo`. This is consistent with\n  other functions, and makes piping possible:\n\n  ```prql no-eval\n  derive [\n    gross_salary = (salary + payroll_tax | as int),\n    gross_salary_rounded = (gross_salary | round 0),\n  ]\n  ```\n\n**Documentation**:\n\n- Split `DEVELOPMENT.md` from `CONTRIBUTING.md` (@richb-hanover, #1010)\n- Make s-strings more prominent in website intro (@max-sixty, #982)\n\n**Web**:\n\n- Add GitHub star count to website (@max-sixty, #990)\n\n**Integrations**:\n\n- Expose a shortened error message, in particular for the VS Code extension\n  (@aljazerzen, #1005)\n\n**Internal changes**:\n\n- Specify 1.60.0 as minimum Rust version (@max-sixty, #1011)\n- Remove old `wee-alloc` code (@max-sixty, #1013)\n- Upgrade clap to version 4 (@aj-bagwell, #1004)\n- Improve book-building script in Taskfile (@max-sixty, #989)\n- Publish website using an artifact rather than a long-lived branch (@max-sixty,\n  #1009)\n\n## 0.2.7 — 2022-09-17\n\n0.2.7 is a fairly modest release, six weeks after 0.2.6. We have some more\nsignificant features, including a `union` operator and an overhaul of our type\nsystem, as open PRs which will follow in future releases.\n\nWe also have new features in the\n[VS Code extension](https://github.com/PRQL/prql-code), courtesy of\n@jiripospisil, including a live output panel.\n\n**Fixes**:\n\n- `range_of_ranges` checks the Range end is smaller than its start (@shuozeli,\n  #946)\n\n**Documentation**:\n\n- Improve various docs (@max-sixty, #974, #971, #972, #970, #925)\n- Add reference to EdgeDB's blog post in our FAQ (@max-sixty, #922)\n- Fix typos (@kianmeng, #943)\n\n**Integrations**:\n\n- Add `prql-lib`, enabling language bindings with `go` (@sigxcpu76, #923)\n- Fix line numbers in JS exceptions (@charlie-sanders, #929)\n\n**Internal changes**:\n\n- Lock the version of the rust-toolchain, with auto-updates (@max-sixty, #926,\n  #927)\n\n## 0.2.6 — 2022-08-05\n\n**Fixes**:\n\n- Adjust `fmt` to only escape names when needed (@aljazerzen, #907)\n- Fix quoting on upper case `table` names (@max-sixty, #893)\n- Fix scoping of identical column names from multiple tables (@max-sixty, #908)\n- Fix parse error on newlines in a `table` (@sebastiantoh 🆕, #902)\n- Fix quoting of upper case table names (@max-sixty, #893)\n\n**Documentation**:\n\n- Add docs on Architecture (@aljazerzen, #904)\n- Add Changelog (@max-sixty, #890 #891)\n\n**Internal changes**:\n\n- Start trial using Conventional Commits (@max-sixty, #889)\n- Add crates.io release workflow, docs (@max-sixty, #887)\n\n## 0.2.5 - 2022-07-29\n\n0.2.5 is a very small release following 0.2.4 yesterday. It includes:\n\n- Add the ability to represent single brackets in an s-string, with two brackets\n  (#752, @max-sixty)\n- Fix the \"Copy to Clipboard\" command in the Playground, for Firefox (#880,\n  @mklopets)\n\n## 0.2.4 - 2022-07-28\n\n0.2.4 is a small release following 0.2.3 a few days ago. The 0.2.4 release\nincludes:\n\n- Enrich our CLI, adding commands to get different stages of the compilation\n  process (@aljazerzen , #863)\n- Fix multiple `take n` statements in a query, leading to duplicate proxy\n  columns in generated SQL (@charlie-sanders)\n- Fix BigQuery quoting of identifiers in `SELECT` statements (@max-sixty)\n- Some internal changes — reorganize top-level functions (@aljazerzen), add a\n  workflow to track our Rust compilation time (@max-sixty), simplify our simple\n  prql-to-sql tests (@max-sixty)\n\nThanks to @ankane, `prql-compiler` is now available from homebrew core;\n`brew install prql-compiler`[^1].\n\n[^1]:\n    we still need to update docs and add a release workflow for this:\n    <https://github.com/PRQL/prql/issues/866>\n\n## 0.2.3 - 2022-07-24\n\nA couple of weeks since the 0.2.2 release: we've squashed a few bugs, added some\nmid-sized features to the language, and made a bunch of internal improvements.\n\nThe 0.2.3 release includes:\n\n- Allow for escaping otherwise-invalid identifiers (@aljazerzen & @max-sixty)\n- Fix a bug around operator precedence (@max-sixty)\n- Add a section the book on the language bindings (@charlie-sanders)\n- Add tests for our `Display` representation while fixing some existing bugs.\n  This is gradually becoming our code formatter (@arrizalamin)\n- Add a \"copy to clipboard\" button in the Playground (@mklopets)\n- Add lots of guidance to our `CONTRIBUTING.md` around our tests and process for\n  merging (@max-sixty)\n- Add a `prql!` macro for parsing a prql query at compile time (@aljazerzen)\n- Add tests for `prql-js` (@charlie-sanders)\n- Add a `from_json` method for transforming json to a PRQL string (@arrizalamin)\n- Add a workflow to release `prql-java` to Maven (@doki23)\n- Enable running all tests from a PR by adding a `pr-run-all-tests` label\n  (@max-sixty)\n- Have `cargo-release` to bump all crate & npm versions (@max-sixty)\n- Update `prql-js` to use the bundler build of `prql-js` (@mklopets)\n\nAs well as those contribution changes, thanks to those who've reported issues,\nsuch as @mklopets @huw @mm444 @ajfriend.\n\nFrom here, we're planning to continue squashing bugs (albeit more minor than\nthose in this release), adding some features like `union`, while working on\nbigger issues such as type-inference.\n\nWe're also going to document and modularize the compiler further. It's important\nthat we give more people an opportunity to contribute to the guts of PRQL,\nespecially given the number and enthusiasm of contributions to project in\ngeneral — and it's not that easy to do so at the moment. While this is ongoing\nif anyone has something they'd like to work on in the more difficult parts of\nthe compiler, let us know on GitHub or Discord, and we'd be happy to work\ntogether on it.\n\nThank you!\n\n## 0.2.2 - 2022-07-10\n\nWe're a couple of weeks since our 0.2.0 release. Thanks for the surge in\ninterest and contributions! 0.2.2 has some fixes & some internal improvements:\n\n- We now test against SQLite & DuckDB on every commit, to ensure we're producing\n  correct SQL. (@aljazerzen)\n- We have the beginning of Java bindings! (@doki23)\n- Idents surrounded by backticks are passed through to SQL (@max-sixty)\n- More examples on homepage; e.g. `join` & `window`, lots of small docs\n  improvements\n- Automated releases to homebrew (@roG0d)\n- [prql-js](https://github.com/PRQL/prql/tree/main/prqlc/bindings/js) is now a\n  single package for Node, browsers & webpack (@charlie-sanders)\n- Parsing has some fixes, including `>=` and leading underscores in idents\n  (@mklopets)\n- Ranges receive correct syntax highlighting (@max-sixty)\n\nThanks to Aljaž Mur Eržen @aljazerzen , George Roldugin @roldugin , Jasper\nMcCulloch @Jaspooky , Jie Han @doki23 , Marko Klopets @mklopets , Maximilian\nRoos @max-sixty , Rodrigo Garcia @roG0d , Ryan Russell @ryanrussell , Steven\nMaude @StevenMaude , Charlie Sanders @charlie-sanders .\n\nWe're planning to continue collecting bugs & feature requests from users, as\nwell as working on some of the bigger features, like type-inference.\n\nFor those interesting in joining, we also have a new\n[Contributing page](https://github.com/PRQL/prql/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## 0.2.0 - 2022-06-27\n\n🎉 🎉 **After several months of building, PRQL is ready to use!** 🎉 🎉\n\n---\n\nHow we got here:\n\nAt the end of January, we published a proposal of a better language for data\ntransformation: PRQL. The reception was better than I could have hoped for — we\nwere no. 2 on HackerNews for a day, and gained 2.5K GitHub stars over the next\nfew days.\n\nBut man cannot live on GitHub Stars alone — we had to do the work to build it.\nSo over the next several months, during many evenings & weekends, a growing\ngroup of us gradually built the compiler, evolved the language, and wrote some\nintegrations.\n\nWe want to double-down on the community and its roots in open source — it's\nincredible that a few of us from all over the globe have collaborated on a\nproject without ever having met. We decided early-on that PRQL would always be\nopen-source and would never have a commercial product (despite lots of outside\ninterest to fund a seed round!). Because languages are so deep in the stack, and\nthe data stack has so many players, the best chance of building a great language\nis to build an open language.\n\n---\n\nWe still have a long way to go. While PRQL is usable, it has lots of missing\nfeatures, and an incredible amount of unfulfilled potential, including a\nlanguage server, cohesion with databases, and type inference. Over the coming\nweeks, we'd like to grow the number of intrepid users experimenting PRQL in\ntheir projects, prioritize features that will unblock them, and then start\nfulfilling PRQL's potential by working through our\n[roadmap](https://prql-lang.org/roadmap/).\n\nThe best way to experience PRQL is to try it. Check out our\n[website](https://prql-lang.org) and the\n[Playground](https://prql-lang.org/playground). Start using PRQL for your own\nprojects in [dbt](https://github.com/prql/dbt-prql),\n[Jupyter notebooks](https://pyprql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/magic_readme.html)\nand Prefect workflows.\n\nKeep in touch with PRQL by following the project on\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/prql_lang), joining us on\n[Discord](https://discord.gg/eQcfaCmsNc), starring the\n[repo](https://github.com/PRQL/prql).\n\n[Contribute](https://github.com/PRQL/prql/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) to\nthe project — we're a really friendly community, whether you're a recent SQL\nuser or an advanced Rust programmer. We need bug reports, documentation tweaks &\nfeature requests — just as much as we need compiler improvements written in\nRust.\n\n---\n\nI especially want to give [Aljaž Mur Eržen](https://github.com/aljazerzen)\n(@aljazerzen) the credit he deserves, who has contributed the majority of the\ndifficult work of building out the compiler. Much credit also goes to\n@charlie-sanders, one of PRQL's earliest supporters and the author of pyprql,\nand [Ryan Patterson-Cross](https://github.com/rbpatt2019) (@rbpatt2019), who\nbuilt the Jupyter integration among other Python contributions.\n\nOther contributors who deserve a special mention include: @roG0d, @snth,\n@kwigley\n\n---\n\nThank you, and we look forward to your feedback!\n"

Like SQL, it's readable, explicit and declarative. Unlike SQL,\nit forms a logical pipeline of transformations, and supports abstractions such\nas variables and functions. It can be used with any database that uses SQL,\nsince it compiles to SQL.\n\nPRQL can be as simple as:\n\n```elm\nfrom tracks\nfilter artist == \"Bob Marley\"                 # Each line transforms the previous result\naggregate {                                   # `aggregate` reduces each column to a value\n  plays    = sum plays,\n  longest  = max length,\n  shortest = min length,                      # Trailing commas are allowed\n}\n```\n\nHere's a larger example of the language:\n\n```elm\nfrom employees\nfilter start_date > @2021-01-01               # Clear date syntax\nderive {                                      # `derive` adds columns / variables\n  gross_salary = salary + (tax ?? 0),         # Terse coalesce\n  gross_cost = gross_salary + benefits_cost,  # Variables can use other variables\n}\nfilter gross_cost > 0\ngroup {title, country} (                      # `group` runs a pipeline over each group\n  aggregate {                                 # `aggregate` reduces each group to a value\n    average gross_salary,\n    sum_gross_cost = sum gross_cost,          # `=` sets a column name\n  }\n)\nfilter sum_gross_cost > 100_000               # `filter` replaces both of SQL's `WHERE` & `HAVING`\nderive id = f\"{title}_{country}\"              # F-strings like Python\nderive country_code = s\"LEFT(country, 2)\"     # S-strings allow using SQL as an escape hatch\nsort {sum_gross_cost, -country}               # `-country` means descending order\ntake 1..20                                    # Range expressions (also valid here as `take 20`)\n```\n\nFor more on the language, more examples & comparisons with SQL, visit\n[prql-lang.org][prql website].

It's ready to use by\nthe intrepid, either with our supported integrations, or within your own tools,\nusing one of our supported language bindings.\n\nPRQL still has some bugs and some missing features, and is probably only ready\nto be rolled out to non-technical teams for fairly simple queries.\n\nIn particular, we're working on a new resolver, which will let us squash many\nbugs and simplify our code a lot. It'll also let us scale the language without\nscaling the complexity of the compiler.\n\nWhile we work on that, we're also focusing on\n\n- Ensuring our supported features feel extremely robust; resolving any\n  [priority bugs](https://github.com/PRQL/prql/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug+label%3Apriority).\n  As more folks have started using PRQL, we've had more bug reports — good news,\n  but also gives us more to work on.\n- Filling remaining feature gaps, so that PRQL is possible to use for almost all\n  standard SQL queries.\n- Expanding our set of supported features — we are working to add experimental\n  support for modules / multi-file projects, and for auto-formatting.\n\nWe're also spending time thinking about:\n\n- Making it really easy to start using PRQL. We're doing that by building\n  integrations with tools that folks already use; for example a VS Code\n  extension, Jupyter integration, and the recent\n  [QStudio](https://www.timestored.com/qstudio/prql-ide) integration. If there\n  are tools you're familiar with that you think would be open to integrating\n  with PRQL, please let us know in an issue.\n- Whether all our initial decisions were correct — for example\n  [how we handle window functions outside of a `window` transform](https://github.com/PRQL/prql/issues/2723).\n- Making it easier to contribute to the compiler. We have a wide group of\n  contributors to the project, but contributions to the compiler itself are\n  quite concentrated. We're keen to expand this;\n  [#1840](https://github.com/PRQL/prql/issues/1840) for feedback, some\n  suggestions on starter issues are below.\n\n## Get involved\n\nTo stay in touch with PRQL:\n\n- Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/prql_lang)\n- Join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/eQcfaCmsNc)\n- Star this repo\n- [Contribute][contributing] — join us in building PRQL, through writing code\n  [(send us your use-cases!)](https://github.com/PRQL/prql/discussions), or\n  inspiring others to use it.\n- See the [development][development] documentation for PRQL. It's easy to get\n  started — the project can be built in a couple of commands, and we're a really\n  friendly community!\n- For those who might be interested in contributing to the code now, check out\n  issues with the\n  [good first issue](https://github.com/PRQL/prql/labels/good%20first%20issue)\n  label. Always feel free to ask questions or open a draft PR.\n\n## Explore\n\n- [PRQL Playground][prql playground] — experiment with PRQL in the browser.\n- [PRQL Book][prql book] — the language documentation.\n- [Jupyter magic](https://pyprql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/magic_readme.html) —\n  run PRQL in Jupyter, either against a DB, or a Pandas DataFrame / CSV /\n  Parquet file through DuckDB.\n- [pyprql Docs](https://pyprql.readthedocs.io) — the pyprql documentation, the\n  Python bindings to PRQL, including Jupyter magic.\n- [PRQL VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=prql-lang.prql-vscode)\n- [prqlc-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prqlc) — JavaScript bindings for\n  PRQL.\n\n## Repo organization\n\nThis repo is composed of:\n\n- **[prqlc](./prqlc/)** — the compiler, written in rust, whose main role is to\n  compile PRQL into SQL. Also contains the CLI and bindings from various\n  languages.\n- **[web](./web/)** — our web content: the [Book][prql book],\n  [Website][prql website], and [Playground][prql playground].\n\nIt also contains our testing / CI infrastructure and development tools.
