Amazing!\n\n## Understand the License\n\nFirst thing to know, GitButler is not a side project, it is the product of a\npretty cool company located in Berlin who develop this client and its\nassociated services professionally. For this reason, we have licensed this\nsoftware under the [Functional Source License](https://fsl.software/), a\nmostly permissive non-compete license that converts to Apache 2.0 or MIT after\ntwo years.\n\nSo, it's not strictly OSS, but it _will_ be. You're free to contribute,\nbut you can't take this and use it to compete with us. You can, however,\notherwise use it however you want.\n\nWe figured this is better than closed source while still letting us make a\nliving from our hard work without worrying too much about bad actors.\n\n## Our Development Process\n\nAs a private company, we have our own development processes that we try to be\nfairly open about, but we're all sitting in a room in Berlin, so external\ncontributions and remote work aren't really a central part of our process.\n\nIt's possible that you want to see a feature, and we disagree, so if you want\nto get something accepted, please discuss it with us first, so we can all be\nfairly confident that your work has a chance to be accepted before you spend\nyour time or result in needing to maintain a fork.\n\nThe two places to communicate with us are on Discord and GitHub (issues and\ndiscussions, etc.).\n\nJoin our Discord here: https://discord.gg/MmFkmaJ42D\n\n## Submitting a Bug Report\n\nYou probably know how to submit a bug report.\n\nYou know, check first to see if something is already there, give us detail to\nrecreate it if at all possible. Things you would want you to do if you were\nmaintaining this project.\n\n## Submitting a Change\n\nIf you talked it over with us, and we agree that it's something we would take,\nplease do the familiar GitHub dance of forking the repository and submitting\na Pull Request, so we can review and possibly merge it.\n\nAny contributions sent to us implicitly give us the right to redistribute that\nwork under the same license and rights.\n\n[Why we don't explicitly require a CLA for contributions to GitButler](https://ben.balter.com/2018/01/02/why-you-probably-shouldnt-add-a-cla-to-your-open-source-project/)\n\n## How will GitButler Stay in Business?\n\nThe client is open source and free to use, forever. If you want to use this\nas your Git client, it will never be pulled out from under you.\n\nIn parallel with this client, we're also developing some rad cloud services\nthat you can optionally enable but are not necessary or limiting to your\nclient experience. If we can provide some compelling team functionality that\nyou can get your boss to pay for, then we would love to have your business\nin that area. If it's not interesting to you, then never fear, the client is\nfully functional on its own and totally free.\n\n## Kudos\n\nWe _love_ our community. Whether you just join Discord to give us some feedback,\nfile a well researched issue, or submit a killer PR, we are excited that you\ncare about what we're doing.\n\nHowever, helping us with our codebase is over the top. We'll call out our\ncontributors in some way, though we haven't quite figured out how yet. But\nrest assured, we'll give you credit. Or schwag, maybe. Or a beer, if you're\never in town.\n\n## Get into the Code!\n\nOk, you're officially onboarded. Grab the code and start in on the\n[DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) file.\n\nGod speed.\n"

Except instead of Node for the\nfilesystem access part, Tauri uses [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).\n\nSo everything that hits disk is in Rust, everything that the\nuser sees is in HTML/JS. Specifically we use [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)\nin Typescript for that layer.\n\n---\n\n## The Basics\n\nOK, let's get it running.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nFirst of all, this is a Tauri app, which uses Rust for the backend and Javascript for the frontend. So let's make sure you have all the prerequisites installed.\n\n1. Tauri Dev Deps (https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/#system-dependencies)\n\nOn Mac OS, ensure you've installed XCode and `cmake`. On Linux, if you're on Debian or one of its derivatives like Ubuntu, you can use the following command.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Linux Tauri dependencies</summary>\n\n```bash\n$ sudo apt update\n$ sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev \\\n  build-essential \\\n  curl \\\n  wget \\\n  file \\\n  libxdo-dev \\\n  libssl-dev \\\n  libayatana-appindicator3-dev \\\n  librsvg2-dev \\\n  cmake\n```\n\n</details>\n\n2. Rust\n\nFor both Mac OS and Linux, you can use the following `rustup` quick install script to get all the necessary tools.\n\n```bash\n$ cd gitbutler-repo\n$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh\n```\n\n3. Node\n\nNext, ensure you've got at least Node 20 installed. If you're on Mac OS or Linux and you're missing `node`, you can use your favorite package manager like `brew` or `apt`.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the following Node installer from Vercel to get the latest version.\n\n```bash\n$ curl https://install-node.vercel.app/latest > install_node.sh\n$ sudo ./install_node.sh\n```\n\n4. pnpm\n\nFinally, we use `pnpm` as our javascript package manager. You can leverage `corepack`, which comes shipped with `node`, to install and use the `pnpm` version we defined in our `package.json`.\n\n```bash\n$ cd gitbutler-repo\n$ corepack enable\n```\n\n### Install dependencies\n\nNext, install the app dependencies.\n\nI hope you have some disk space for 300M of `node_modules`, because this bad\nboy will fill er up:\n\n```bash\n$ pnpm install # This should now ask you to confirm the download, installation, and use of pnpm via corepack\n```\n\nYou'll have to re-run this occasionally when our deps change.\n\n> [!NOTE]  \n> We use [turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) as our monorepo tooling and by default Vercel collects some [basic telemetry](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/telemetry). If you'd like to disable this, please run `pnpm exec turbo telemetry disable` once in the project's root directory after installing dependencies.\n\n### Run the app\n\nFirst, run cargo build such that supplementary bins such as `gitbutler-git-askpass` and `gitbutler-git-setsid` are created (Note the default folder (`target`) will be used for the build):\n\n```bash\n$ cargo build\n```\n\nNow you should be able to run the app in development mode:\n\n```bash\n$ pnpm dev:desktop\n```\n\nBy default it will not print debug logs to console. If you want debug logs, set `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable:\n\n```bash\n$ LOG_LEVEL=debug pnpm dev:desktop\n```\n\n### Lint & format\n\nIn order to have a PR accepted, you need to make sure everything passes our\nLinters, so make sure to run these before submitting. Our CI will shame you\nif you don't.\n\nJavascript:\n\n```bash\n$ pnpm lint\n$ pnpm format\n```\n\nRust:\n\n```bash\n$ cargo clippy   # see linting errors\n$ cargo fmt      # format code\n```\n\n---\n\n## Debugging\n\nNow that you have the app running, here are some hints for debugging whatever\nit is that you're working on.\n\n### Logs\n\nThe app writes logs into:\n\n1. `stdout` in development mode\n2. The Tauri [logs](https://tauri.app/v1/api/js/path/#platform-specific) directory\n\nOne can get performance log when launching the application locally as follows:\n\n```bash\nGITBUTLER_PERFORMANCE_LOG=1 LOG_LEVEL=debug pnpm tauri dev\n```\n\nFor more realistic performance logging, use local release builds with `--release`.\n\n```bash\nGITBUTLER_PERFORMANCE_LOG=1 LOG_LEVEL=debug pnpm tauri dev --release\n```\n\nSince release builds are configured for public releases, they are very slow to compile.\nSpeed them up by sourcing the following file.\n\n```bash\nexport CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_DEBUG=0\nexport CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_INCREMENTAL=false\nexport CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_LTO=false\nexport CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_CODEGEN_UNITS=256\nexport CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_OPT_LEVEL=2\n```\n\n### Tokio\n\nWe are also collecting tokio's runtime tracing information that could be viewed using [tokio-console](https://github.com/tokio-rs/console#tokio-console-prototypes):\n\n- development:\n  ```bash\n  $ tokio-console\n  ```\n- nightly:\n  ```bash\n  $ tokio-console http://127.0.0.1:6668\n  ```\n- production:\n  ```bash\n  $ tokio-console http://127.0.0.1:6667\n  ```\n\n---\n\n## Building\n\nTo build the app in production mode, run:\n\n```bash\n$ pnpm tauri build --features devtools --config crates/gitbutler-tauri/tauri.conf.nightly.json\n```\n\nThis will make an asset similar to our nightly build.\n\n### Building on Windows\n\nBuilding on Windows is a bit of a tricky process. Here are some helpful tips.\n\n#### Nightly Compiler\n\nAs a few crates require nightly features on Windows, a `rust-toolchain.toml` is provided\nto have rustup use the right compiler version.\n\nIf for some reason this cannot be used or doesn't kick-in, one can also set an override.\n\n```shell\nrustup override add nightly-2024-07-01\n```\n\nIf a stable nightly isn't desired or necessary, the latest nightly compiler can also be used:\n\n```shell\nrustup override add nightly\n```\n\n#### File permissions\n\nWe use `pnpm`, which requires a relatively recent version of Node.js.\nMake sure that the latest stable version of Node.js is installed and\non the PATH, and then `npm i -g pnpm`.\n\nSometimes npm's prefix is incorrect on Windows, we can check this via:\n\n```sh\nnpm config get prefix\n```\n\nIf it's not `C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm` or another folder that is\nnormally writable, then we can set it in Powershell:\n\n```sh\nmkdir -p $APPDATA\\npm\nnpm config set prefix $env:APPDATA\\npm\n```\n\nAfterwards, add this folder to your PATH.\n\n#### Perl\n\nA Perl interpreter is required to be installed in order to configure the `openssl-sys`\ncrate. We've used [Strawberry Perl](https://strawberryperl.com/) without issue.\nMake sure it's installed and `perl` is available on the `PATH` (it is by default\nafter installation, just make sure to restart the terminal after installing).\n[Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) users can install this via `scoop install perl`.\n\nNote that it might appear that the build has hung or frozen on the `openssl-sys` crate.\nIt's not, it's just that Cargo can't report the status of a C/C++ build happening\nunder the hood, and openssl is _large_. It'll take a while to compile.\n\n#### Crosscompilation\n\nThis paragraph is about crosscompilation to x86_64-MSVC from ARM Windows,\na configuration typical for people with Apple Silicon and Parallels VMs,\nwhich only allow ARM Windows to be used.\n\nThe `windows` dependency on `gitbutler-git` doesn't currently compile on ARM,\nwhich means cross-compilation to x86-64 is required to workaround that. Besides,\nmost users will probably still be on INTEL machines, making this capability\na common requirement.\n\nIn a Git `bash`, _with MSVC for x86-64 installed on the system_, run the following\nto prepare the environment.\n\n```bash\nexport TRIPLE_OVERRIDE=x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\nexport CARGO_BUILD_TARGET=x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\nexport OPENSSL_SRC_PERL=\"c:/Strawberry/perl/bin/perl.exe\"\n```\n\nHere is how to produce a nightly release build:\n\n```\npnpm tauri build --features windows,devtools --config  crates/gitbutler-tauri/tauri.conf.nightly.json\n```\n\nAnd this is how to get a local developer debug build:\n\n```bash\npnpm tauri dev --features windows --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\n```\n\nNote that it's necessary to repeat the `--target` specification as otherwise the final copy operation doesn't work,\ntriggered by `tauri` itself.\n\n---\n\n## Design\n\nWe use [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for our design work.\nIf you're a designer (and even if you're not), you want to contribute to the\ndesign of GitButler, or your work involves UI, you could duplicate our design file.\n\nGitButler design: [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/FbeLt0yjY9RiNn8MXUXsYs/Client-Design?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=MUDQhR3iOM3DpI9m-1) 🎨\n\n---\n\n## Contributing\n\nNow that you're up and running, if you want to change something and open a PR\nfor us, make sure to read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) to make sure you're\nnot wasting your time.\n\n---\n\n## Some Other Random Notes\n\nMost of this is for internal GitButler use, but maybe everyone else will find\nit interesting too.\n\n---\n\n### Icon generation\n\nI always forget how to do this, but when we update our app icon, run this to\nimport it.\n\n```bash\n$ pnpm tauri icon path/to/icon.png\n```\n\n### Release\n\nBuilding is done via [GitHub Action](https://github.com/gitbutlerapp/gitbutler/actions/workflows/publish.yaml).\nGo to the link and select `Run workflow` from the desired branch.\n\n### Versioning\n\nWhen running the [release action](https://github.com/gitbutlerapp/gitbutler/actions/workflows/publish.yaml),\nyou will have to choose one of `major`, `minor`, or `patch` release type. Action will generate a new version based on your input and current\nversion found at `https://app.gitbutler.com/releases`.\n\n### Publishing\n\nTo publish a version that you've just build, use [Release Manager](https://gitbutler.retool.com/apps/cb9cbed6-ae0a-11ed-918c-736c4335d3af/Release%20Manager).\n\n---\n\n## Development mode OAuth login\n\nBy default, you will not be able to log into GitButler using Github/Google because the base url does not match. To be able to do this add ( or update ) the following line to your `.env.development` file. You will need to create the file if it does not exist.\n\n```\nPUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://app.gitbutler.com/\n```\n\n---\n\n## Joining the GitButler Team\n\nIf you are interested in joining our small but tightly knit engineering team, we are currently looking for the following roles:\n\n- [Senior Rust developer](https://gitbutler.homerun.co/senior-rust-developer) (Onsite Berlin)\n- [Senior TypeScript developer](https://gitbutler.homerun.co/senior-typescript-developer) (Onsite Berlin)\n- [Senior Rails developer](https://gitbutler.homerun.co/senior-rails-developer) (Onsite Berlin)\n\n## Code Hitlist\n\nThis is a list of crates/modules that we want to eliminate or split into smaller crates:\n\n- [gitbutler-reference](crates/gitbutler-reference/) (just bad)\n- [gitbutler-storage](crates/gitbutler-storage/) (legacy way of dealing with files)\n- [gitbutler-branch-actions](crates/gitbutler-branch-actions/) (contains functionality outside of the virtual branch domain (e.g. commit actions etc.))\n- [gitbutler-repository](crates/gitbutler-repository/)\n- [gitbutler-branch](crates/gitbutler-branch/) (contains `diff` and `branch` contexts due to a cyclic dependency)\n- [gitbutler-url](crates/gitbutler-url/) (this is a huge mess and ideally we need none of it)\n- [gitbutler_repo::config](crates/gitbutler-repo/src/config.rs) (seems like the wrong abstraction)\n- [gitbutler-config](crates/gitbutler-config) (this provides an API for the UI layer to read and write git config and we want none of that)\n- [gitbutler_virtual::assets](crates/gitbutler-branch-actions/src/assets.rs) (this is a caching of things like favicons and it's clearly a UI concern that doesn't belong here)\n"

Changes to files or parts of files can be grouped into what we call virtual branches. Whenever you are happy with the contents of a virtual branch, you can push it to a remote. GitButler makes sure that the state of other virtual branches is kept separate.\n\n## How Do GB's Virtual Branches Differ From Git Branches?\n\nThe branches that we know and love in Git are separate universes, and switching between them is a full context switch. GitButler allows you to work with multiple branches in parallel in the same working directory. This effectively means having the content of multiple branches available at the same time.\n\nGitButler is aware of changes before they are committed. This allows it to keep a record of which virtual branch each individual diff belongs to. Effectively, this means that you can separate out individual branches with their content at any time to push them to a remote or to unapply them from your working directory.\n\nAnd finally, while in Git it is preferable that you create your desired branch ahead of time, using GitButler you can move changes between virtual branches at any point during development.\n\n## Why GitButler?\n\nWe love Git. Our own [@schacon](https://github.com/schacon) has even published the [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) book. At the same time, Git's user interface hasn't been fundamentally changed for 15 years. While it was written for Linux kernel devs sending patches to each other over mailing lists, most developers today have different workflows and needs.\n\nInstead of trying to fit the semantics of the Git CLI into a graphical interface, we are starting with the developer workflow and mapping it back to Git.\n\n## Tech\n\nGitButler is a [Tauri](https://tauri.app/)-based application. Its UI is written in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and its backend is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).\n\n## Main Features\n\n- **Virtual Branches**\n  - Organize work on multiple branches simultaneously, rather than constantly switching branches\n  - Automatically create new branches when needed\n- **Easy Commit Management**\n  - Undo, Amend and Squash commits by dragging and dropping\n- **Undo Timeline**\n  - Logs all operations and changes and allows you to easily undo or revert any operation\n- **GitHub Integration**\n  - Authenticate to GitHub to open Pull Requests, list branches and statuses and more\n- **Easy SSH Key Management**\n  - GitButler can generate an SSH key to upload to GitHub automatically\n- **AI Tooling**\n  - Automatically write commit messages based on your work in progress\n  - Automatically create descriptive branch names\n- **Commit Signing**\n  - Easy commit signing with GPG or SSH\n\n## Example Uses\n\n### Fixing a Bug While Working on a Feature\n\n> Say that while developing a feature, you encounter a bug that you wish to fix. It's often desirable that you ship the fix as a separate contribution (Pull request).\n\nUsing Git you can stash your changes and switch to another branch, where you can commit, and push your fix.\n\n_With GitButler_ you simply assign your fix to a separate virtual branch, which you can individually push (or directly create a PR). An additional benefit is that you can retain the fix in your working directory while waiting for CI and/or code review.\n\n### Trying Someone Else's Branch Together With My Work in Progress\n\n> Say you want to test a branch from someone else for the purpose of code review.\n\nUsing Git trying out someone else's branch is a full context switch away from your own work.\n_With GitButler_ you can apply and unapply (add / remove) any remote branch directly into your working directory.\n\n## Documentation\n\nYou can find our end user documentation at: https://docs.gitbutler.com\n\n## Bugs and Feature Requests\n\nIf you have a bug or feature request, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/gitbutlerapp/gitbutler/issues/new),\nor [join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/MmFkmaJ42D).\n\n## AI Commit Message Generation\n\nCommit message generation is an opt-in feature. You can enable it while adding your repository for the first time or later in the project settings.\n\nCurrently, GitButler uses OpenAI's API for diff summarization, which means that if enabled, code diffs would be sent to OpenAI's servers.\n\nOur goal is to make this feature more modular such that in the future you can modify the prompt as well as plug a different LLM endpoints (including local ones).\n\n## Contributing\n\nSo you want to help out? Please check out the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)\ndocument.\n\nIf you want to skip right to getting the code to actually compile, take a look\nat the [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) file.\n\nWant to show your support?
