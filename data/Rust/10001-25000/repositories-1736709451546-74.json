For backward compatibility, support for raw\n  identifiers has been introduced; for example, use `cfg(r#true)` instead.\n  [#14671](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/14671)\n- Dependency resolution now provides richer error messages explaining why some versions were rejected, unmatched, or invalid.  \n  [#14897](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/14897)\n  [#14921](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/14921)\n  [#14923](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/14923)\n  [#14927](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/14927)\n- cargo-doc: improve the error message when `--open`ing a doc while no doc generated.\n  [#14969](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/14969)\n- cargo-package: warn if symlinks checked out as plain text files \n  [#14994](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/14994)\n- cargo-package: Shows dirty file paths relative to the Git working directory.\n  [#14968](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/14968)\n  [#14970](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/14970)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Set `GIT_DIR` to ensure compatibility with bare repositories\n  for `net.git-fetch-with-cli=true`.\n  [#14860](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/14860)\n- Fixed workspace Cargo.toml modification didn't invalidate build cache.\n  [#14973](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/14973)\n- Prevented build caches from being discarded after changes to `RUSTFLAGS`.\n  [#14830](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/14830)\n  [#14898](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/14898)\n- cargo-add: Don't select yanked versions when normalizing names.\n  [#14895](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/14895)\n- cargo-fix: Migrate workspace dependencies to the 2024 edition also for virtual manifests.\n  [#14890](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/14890)\n- cargo-package: Verify the VCS status of `package.readme` and `package.license-file`\n  when they point to paths outside the current package root.\n  [#14966](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/14966)\n- cargo-package: assure possibly blocking non-files (like FIFOs) won't be\n  picked up for publishing.\n  [#14977](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/14977)\n\n### Nightly only\n\n- `path-bases`: Support bases in `[patch]`es in virtual manifests\n

(2024-07-25)\n[b60a1555...rust-1.80.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/b60a1555...rust-1.80.0)\n\n### Added\n\n- üéâ Stabilize `-Zcheck-cfg`! This by default enables rustc's checking of\n  conditional compilation at compile time, which verifies that the crate is\n  correctly handling conditional compilation for different target platforms or\n  features. Internally, cargo will be passing a new command line option\n  `--check-cfg` to all rustc and rustdoc invocations.\n\n  A new build script invocation\n  [`cargo::rustc-check-cfg=CHECK_CFG`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/build-scripts.html#rustc-check-cfg)\n  is added along with this stabilization, as a way to add custom cfgs to the\n  list of expected cfg names and values.\n\n  If a build script is not an option for your package, Cargo provides a config\n  [`[lints.rust.unexpected_cfgs.check-cfg]`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/check-cfg/cargo-specifics.html#check-cfg-in-lintsrust-table)\n  to add known custom cfgs statically.\n\n  ([RFC

üéâ `cargo add` respects `package.rust-version` a.k.a. MSRV when adding new\n  dependencies. The behavior can be overridden by specifying a version requirement,\n  or passing the `--ignore-rust-version` flag.\n  ([RFC 3537](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/3537-msrv-resolver.md))\n  [#13608](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13608)\n- A new `Locking` status message shows dependency changes on any command.\n  For `cargo update`, it also tells you if any dependency version is outdated.\n  [#13561](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13561)\n  [#13647](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13647)\n  [#13651](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13651)\n  [#13657](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13657)\n  [#13759](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13759)\n  [#13764](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13764)\n\n### Changed\n\n- ‚ùóÔ∏è `RUSTC_WRAPPER`, `RUSTC_WORKSPACE_WRAPPER`, and variables from the `[env]`\n  table now also apply to the initial `rustc -vV` invocation Cargo uses for\n  probing rustc information.\n  [#13659](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13659)\n- ‚ùóÔ∏è Turns dependencies like `foo = { optional = true }` from `version=\"*\"`\n  dependencies with a warning into errors.\n  This behavior has been considered a bug from the beginning.\n  [#13775](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13775)\n- ‚ùóÔ∏è Replace dashes with underscores also if `lib.name` is inferred from `package.name`.\n  This change aligns to the documented behavior. One caveat is that JSON messages\n  emitted by Cargo, like via `cargo metadata` or `--message-format=json`,\n  will start reporting underscore lib names.\n  [#12783](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/12783)\n- Switch to `gitoxide` for listing files. This improves the performance of\n  build script and `cargo doc` for computing cache freshness,\n  as well as fixes some subtle bugs for `cargo publish`.\n

[#13808](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13808)\n- Don't warn on `lints.rust.unexpected_cfgs.check-cfg`.\n  [#13925](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13925)\n- cargo-init: don't assign `target.name` in Cargo.toml if the value can be inferred.\n  [#13606](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13606)\n- cargo-package: normalize paths in `Cargo.toml`, including replacing `\\` with

[#13756](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13756)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Ensure `--config net.git-fetch-with-cli=true` is respected.\n  [#13992](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13992)\n  [#13997](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13997)\n- Dont panic when resolving an empty alias.\n  [#13613](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13613)\n- When using `--target`, the default debuginfo strip rule also applies.\n  Note that on Windows MSVC Cargo no longer strips by default.\n  [#13618](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13618)\n- Don't crash on Cargo.toml parse errors that point to multi-byte character\n  [#13780](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/13780)\n- Don't emit deprecation warning if one of `.cargo/{config,config.toml}` is\n  a symlink to the other.\n

These extended characters aren't allowed on crates.io,\n  so this should only impact users of other registries, or people who don't publish to a registry.\n  [#12291](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/12291)\n- Cargo now warns when an edition 2021 package is in a virtual workspace and\n  `workspace.resolver` is not set. It is recommended to set the resolver\n  version for workspaces explicitly.\n  [#10910](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10910)\n- Set IBM AIX shared libraries search path to `LIBPATH`.\n  [#11968](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/11968)\n- Don't pass `-C debuginfo=0` to rustc as it is the default value.\n  [#12022](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/12022)\n  [#12205](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/12205)\n- Added a message on reusing previous temporary path on `cargo install` failures.\n  [#12231](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/12231)\n- Added a message when `rustup` override shorthand is put in a wrong position.\n  [#12226](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/12226)\n- Respect scp-like URL as much as possible when fetching nested submodules.\n  [#12359](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/12359)\n  [#12411](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/12411)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- `cargo clean` uses `remove_dir_all` as a fallback to resolve race conditions.\n  [#11442](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/11442)\n- Reduced the chance Cargo re-formats the user's `[features]` table.\n  [#12191](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/12191)\n- Fixed nested Git submodules not able to fetch.\n  [#12244](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/12244)\n\n### Nightly only\n\n- üî• The `-Zscript` is an experimental feature to add unstable support for\n  single-file packages in Cargo, so we can explore the design and resolve\n  questions with an implementation to collect feedback on.\n  ([eRFC 3424](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/3424-cargo-script.md))\n  [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#script)\n

[CVE-2023-38497](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/security/advisories/GHSA-j3xp-wfr4-hx87):\n  Cargo 1.71.1 or later respects umask when extracting crate archives. It also\n  purges the caches it tries to access if they were generated by older Cargo versions.\n\n## Cargo 1.71 (2023-07-13)\n[84b7041f...rust-1.71.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/84b7041f...rust-1.71.0)\n\n### Added\n\n- Allowed named debuginfo options in Cargo.toml.\n  [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/profiles.html#debug)\n  [#11958](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/11958)\n- Added `workspace_default_members` to the output of `cargo metadata`.\n  [#11978](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/11978)\n- Automatically inherit workspace fields when running `cargo new`/`cargo init`.\n  [#12069](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/12069)\n\n### Changed\n\n- ‚ùó Optimized the usage under `rustup`. When Cargo detects it will run `rustc`\n  pointing a rustup proxy, it'll try bypassing the proxy and use the underlying\n  binary directly. There are assumptions around the interaction with rustup and\n  `RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN`.

This allows creating feature names with the same name as a\n  dependency, and allows for \"hiding\" optional dependencies so that they do\n  not implicitly expose a feature name.\n  [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/features.html#optional-dependencies)\n  [#10269](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10269)\n- üéâ Added the `dep-name?/feature-name` syntax to the `[features]` table to\n  only enable the feature `feature-name` if the optional dependency `dep-name`\n  is already enabled by some other feature.\n  [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/features.html#dependency-features)\n  [#10269](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10269)\n- üéâ Added `--timings` option to generate an HTML report about build timing,\n  concurrency, and CPU use.\n  [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/timings.html)\n  [#10245](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10245)\n- Added the `\"v\"` and `\"features2\"` fields to the registry index.\n  The `\"v\"` field provides a method for compatibility with future changes to the index.\n  [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/registries.html#index-format)\n  [#10269](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10269)\n- Added bash completion for `cargo clippy`\n  [#10347](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10347)\n- Added bash completion for `cargo report`\n  [#10295](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10295)\n- Added support to build scripts for `rustc-link-arg-tests`,\n  `rustc-link-arg-examples`, and `rustc-link-arg-benches`.\n  [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/build-scripts.html#outputs-of-the-build-script)\n  [#10274](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10274)\n\n### Changed\n\n- Cargo now uses the clap 3 library for command-line argument parsing.\n  [#10265](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10265)\n- The `build.pipelining` config option is now deprecated, pipelining will now\n  always be enabled.\n  [#10258](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10258)\n- `cargo new` will now generate a `.gitignore` which only ignores `Cargo.lock`\n  in the root of the repo, instead of any directory.\n  [#10379](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10379)\n- Improved startup time of bash completion.\n  [#10365](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10365)\n- The `--features` flag is now honored when used with the `--all-features`\n  flag, which allows enabling features from other packages.\n  [#10337](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10337)\n- Cargo now uses a different TOML parser. This should not introduce any\n  user-visible changes. This paves the way to support format-preserving\n  programmatic modification of TOML files for supporting `cargo add` and other\n  future enhancements.\n  [#10086](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10086)\n- Setting a library to emit both a `dylib` and `cdylib` is now an error, as\n  this combination is not supported.\n  [#10243](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10243)\n- `cargo --list` now includes the `help` command.\n  [#10300](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10300)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed running `cargo doc` on examples with dev-dependencies.\n  [#10341](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10341)\n- Fixed `cargo install --path` for a path that is relative to a directory\n  outside of the workspace in the current directory.\n  [#10335](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10335)\n- `cargo test TEST_FILTER` should no longer build binaries that are explicitly\n  disabled with `test = false`.\n  [#10305](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10305)\n- Fixed regression with `term.verbose` without `term.quiet`, and vice versa.\n  [#10429](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10429)\n  [#10436](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10436)\n\n### Nightly only\n\n- Added `rustflags` option to a profile definition.\n  [#10217](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10217)\n- Changed `--config` to only support dotted keys.\n  [#10176](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10176)\n- Fixed profile `rustflags` not being gated in profile overrides.\n  [#10411](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10411)\n  [#10413](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10413)\n\n## Cargo 1.59 (2022-02-24)\n[7f08ace4...rust-1.59.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/7f08ace4...rust-1.59.0)\n\n### Added\n\n- üéâ The `strip` option can now be specified in a profile to specify the\n  behavior for removing symbols and debug information from binaries.\n  [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/profiles.html#strip)\n  [#10088](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10088)\n  [#10376](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10376)\n- üéâ Added future incompatible reporting.\n  This provides reporting for when a future change in `rustc` may cause a\n  package or any of its dependencies to stop building.\n  [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/future-incompat-report.html)\n  [#10165](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10165)\n- SSH authentication on Windows now supports ssh-agent.\n  [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/appendix/git-authentication.html#ssh-authentication)\n  [#10248](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10248)\n- Added `term.quiet` configuration option to enable the `--quiet` behavior\n  from a config file.\n  [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/config.html#termquiet)\n  [#10152](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10152)\n- Added `-r` CLI option as an alias for `--release`.\n  [#10133](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10133)\n\n### Changed\n\n- Scanning the package directory should now be resilient to errors, such as\n  filesystem loops or access issues.\n  [#10188](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10188)\n  [#10214](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10214)\n  [#10286](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10286)\n- `cargo help <alias>` will now show the target of the alias.\n  [#10193](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10193)\n- Removed the deprecated `--host` CLI option.\n  [#10145](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10145)\n  [#10327](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10327)\n- Cargo should now report its version to always be in sync with `rustc`.\n  [#10178](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10178)\n- Added EOPNOTSUPP to ignored file locking errors, which is relevant to BSD\n  operating systems.\n  [#10157](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10157)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- macOS: Fixed an issue where running an executable would sporadically be\n  killed by the kernel (likely starting in macOS 12).\n  [#10196](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10196)\n- Fixed so that the `doc=false` setting is honored in the `[lib]` definition\n  of a dependency.\n  [#10201](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10201)\n  [#10324](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10324)\n- The `\"executable\"` field in the JSON option was incorrectly including the\n  path to `index.html` when documenting a binary. It is now null.\n  [#10171](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10171)\n- Documenting a binary now waits for the package library to finish documenting\n  before starting. This fixes some race conditions if the binary has intra-doc\n  links to the library.\n  [#10172](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10172)\n- Fixed panic when displaying help text to a closed pipe.\n  [#10164](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10164)\n\n### Nightly only\n- Added the `--crate-type` flag to `cargo rustc`.\n  [#10093](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10093)\n\n\n## Cargo 1.58 (2022-01-13)\n[b2e52d7c...rust-1.58.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/b2e52d7c...rust-1.58.0)\n\n### Added\n\n- Added `rust_version` field to package data in `cargo metadata`.\n  [#9967](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9967)\n- Added `--message-format` option to `cargo install`.\n  [#10107](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10107)\n\n### Changed\n\n- A warning is now shown when an alias shadows an external command.\n  [#10082](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10082)\n- Updated curl to 7.80.0.\n  [#10040](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10040)\n  [#10106](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10106)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Doctests now include rustc-link-args from build scripts.\n  [#9916](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9916)\n- Fixed `cargo tree` entering an infinite loop with cyclical dev-dependencies.\n  Fixed an edge case where the resolver would fail to handle a cyclical dev-dependency with a feature.\n  [#10103](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10103)\n- Fixed `cargo clean -p` when the directory path contains glob characters.\n  [#10072](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10072)\n- Fixed debug builds of `cargo` which could panic when downloading a crate\n  when the server has a redirect with a non-empty body.\n  [#10048](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10048)\n\n### Nightly only\n\n- Make future-incompat-report output more user-friendly.\n  [#9953](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9953)\n- Added support to scrape code examples from the `examples` directory to be included in the documentation.\n  [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#scrape-examples)\n  [#9525](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9525)\n  [#10037](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10037)\n  [#10017](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10017)\n- Fixed `cargo report future-incompatibilities` to check stdout if it supports color.\n  [#10024](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/10024)\n\n## Cargo 1.57 (2021-12-02)\n[18751dd3...rust-1.57.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/18751dd3...rust-1.57.0)\n\n### Added\n\n- üéâ Added custom named profiles. This also changes the `test` and `bench`\n  profiles to inherit their settings from `dev` and `release`, and Cargo will\n  now only use a single profile during a given command instead of using\n  different profiles for dependencies and cargo-targets.\n  [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/profiles.html#custom-profiles)\n  [#9943](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9943)\n- The `rev` option for a git dependency now supports git references that start\n  with `refs/`. An example where this can be used is to depend on a pull\n  request from a service like GitHub before it is merged.\n  [#9859](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9859)\n- Added `path_in_vcs` field to the `.cargo_vcs_info.json` file.\n  [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/commands/cargo-package.html#cargo_vcs_infojson-format)\n  [#9866](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9866)\n\n### Changed\n\n- ‚ùó `RUSTFLAGS` is no longer set for build scripts. This change was made in\n  1.55, but the release notes did not highlight this change. Build scripts\n  should use `CARGO_ENCODED_RUSTFLAGS` instead. See the\n  [documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/environment-variables.html#environment-variables-cargo-sets-for-build-scripts)\n  for more details.\n- The `cargo version` command now includes some extra information.\n  [#9968](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9968)\n- Updated libgit2 to 1.3 which brings in a number of fixes and changes to git\n  handling.\n  [#9963](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9963)\n  [#9988](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9988)\n- Shell completions now include shorthand b/r/c/d subcommands.\n  [#9951](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9951)\n- `cargo update --precise` now allows specifying a version without semver\n  metadata (stuff after `+` in the version number).\n  [#9945](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9945)\n- zsh completions now complete `--example` names.\n  [#9939](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9939)\n- The progress bar now differentiates when building unittests.\n  [#9934](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9934)\n- Some backwards-compatibility support for invalid TOML syntax has been removed.\n  [#9932](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9932)\n- Reverted the change from 1.55 that triggered an error for dependency\n  specifications that did not include any fields.\n  [#9911](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9911)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Removed a log message (from `CARGO_LOG`) that may leak tokens.\n  [#9873](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9873)\n- `cargo fix` will now avoid writing fixes to the global registry cache.\n  [#9938](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9938)\n- Fixed `-Z help` CLI option when used with a shorthand alias (b/c/r/d).\n  [#9933](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9933)\n\n\n### Nightly only\n\n\n## Cargo 1.56 (2021-10-21)\n[cebef295...rust-1.56.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/cebef295...rust-1.56.0)\n\n### Added\n\n- üéâ Cargo now supports the 2021 edition.\n  More information may be found in the [edition\n  guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/edition-guide/rust-2021/index.html).\n  [#9800](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9800)\n- üéâ Added the\n  [`rust-version`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-rust-version-field)\n  field to `Cargo.toml` to specify the minimum supported Rust version, and the\n  `--ignore-rust-version` command line option to override it.\n  [#9732](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9732)\n- Added the `[env]` table to config files to specify environment variables to\n  set.\n  [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/config.html#env)\n  [#9411](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9411)\n- `[patch]` tables may now be specified in config files.\n  [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/config.html#patch)\n  [#9839](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9839)\n- `cargo doc` now supports the `--example` and `--examples` flags.\n  [#9808](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9808)\n- üéâ Build scripts can now pass additional linker arguments for binaries or all\n  linkable targets.

aligned with the\n  original to help make it easier to see the difference.\n  [#9665](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9665)\n- Windows platforms may now warn on environment variables that have the wrong case.\n  [#9654](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9654)\n- `features` used in a `[patch]` table now issues a warning, as they are ignored.\n

fixes each target serially instead of in parallel to avoid\n  problems with fixing the same file concurrently.\n  [#9677](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9677)\n- Changes to the target `linker` config value now trigger a rebuild.\n  [#9647](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9647)\n- Git unstaged deleted files are now ignored when using the `--allow-dirty`\n  flag with `cargo publish` or `cargo package`.\n  [#9645](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9645)\n\n### Nightly only\n\n- Enabled support for `cargo fix --edition` for 2021.\n

Fetching from a git repository (such as the crates.io index) now displays\n  the network transfer rate.\n  [#9395](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9395)\n- Added `--prune` option for `cargo tree` to limit what is displayed.\n  [#9520](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9520)\n- Added `--depth` option for `cargo tree` to limit what is displayed.\n  [#9499](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9499)\n- Added `cargo tree -e no-proc-macro` to hide procedural macro dependencies.\n  [#9488](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9488)\n- Added

This should behave mostly\n  the same as before with some minor exceptions where invalid syntax for\n  version requirements is now rejected.\n  [#9508](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9508)\n- Mtime handling of `.crate` published packages has changed slightly to avoid\n  mtime values of 0. This was causing problems with lldb which refused to read\n  those files.\n  [#9517](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9517)\n- Improved performance of git status check in `cargo package`.\n  [#9478](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9478)\n- `cargo new` with fossil now places the ignore settings in the new repository\n  instead of using `fossil settings` to set them globally. This also includes\n  several other cleanups to make it more consistent with other VCS\n  configurations.\n  [#9469](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9469)\n- `rustc-cdylib-link-arg` applying transitively displays a warning that this\n  was not intended, and may be an error in the future.\n  [#9563](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9563)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed `package.exclude` in `Cargo.toml` using inverted exclusions\n  (`!somefile`) when not in a git repository or when vendoring a dependency.\n  [#9186](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9186)\n- Dep-info files now adjust build script `rerun-if-changed` paths to be\n  absolute paths.\n  [#9421](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9421)\n- Fixed a bug when with resolver = \"1\" non-virtual package was allowing\n  unknown features.\n  [#9437](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9437)\n- Fixed an issue with the index cache mishandling versions that only\n  differed in build metadata (such as `110.0.0` and `110.0.0+1.1.0f`).\n  [#9476](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9476)\n- Fixed `cargo install` with a semver metadata version.\n  [#9467](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9467)\n\n### Nightly only\n\n- Added `report` subcommand, and changed `cargo\n  describe-future-incompatibilitie` to `cargo report\n  future-incompatibilities`.\n  [#9438](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9438)\n- Added a `[host]` table to the config files to be able to set build flags for\n  host target. Also added `target-applies-to-host` to control how the\n  `[target]` tables behave.\n  [#9322](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9322)\n- Added some validation to build script `rustc-link-arg-*` instructions to\n  return an error if the target doesn't exist.\n  [#9523](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9523)\n- Added `cargo:rustc-link-arg-bin` instruction for build scripts.\n  [#9486](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9486)\n\n\n## Cargo 1.53 (2021-06-17)\n[90691f2b...rust-1.53.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/90691f2b...rust-1.53.0)\n\n### Added\n\n### Changed\n- üî• Cargo now supports git repositories where the default `HEAD` branch is not\n  \"master\". This also includes a switch to the version 3 `Cargo.lock` format\n  which can handle default branches correctly.\n  [#9133](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9133)\n  [#9397](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9397)\n  [#9384](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9384)\n  [#9392](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9392)\n- üî• macOS targets now default to `unpacked` split-debuginfo.\n  [#9298](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9298)\n- ‚ùó The `authors` field is no longer included in `Cargo.toml` for new\n  projects.\n  [#9282](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9282)\n- `cargo update` may now work with the `--offline` flag.\n  [#9279](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9279)\n- `cargo doc` will now erase the `doc` directory when switching between\n  different toolchain versions. There are shared, unversioned files (such as\n  the search index) that can become broken when using different versions.\n  [#8640](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8640)\n  [#9404](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9404)\n- Improved error messages when path dependency/workspace member is missing.\n  [#9368](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9368)\n\n### Fixed\n- Fixed `cargo doc` detecting if the documentation needs to be rebuilt when\n  changing some settings such as features.\n  [#9419](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9419)\n- `cargo doc` now deletes the output directory for the package before running\n  rustdoc to clear out any stale files.\n  [#9419](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9419)\n- Fixed the `-C metadata` value to always include all information for all\n  builds. Previously, in some situations, the hash only included the package\n  name and version. This fixes some issues, such as incremental builds with\n  split-debuginfo on macOS corrupting the incremental cache in some cases.\n  [#9418](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9418)\n- Fixed man pages not working on Windows if `man` is in `PATH`.\n  [#9378](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9378)\n- The `rustc` cache is now aware of `RUSTC_WRAPPER` and `RUSTC_WORKSPACE_WRAPPER`.\n

`--future-incompat-report` had nothing to report.\n  [#9263](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9263)\n- Error messages for nightly features flags (like `-Z` and `cargo-features`)\n  now provides more information.\n  [#9290](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9290)\n- Added the ability to set the target for an individual package in `Cargo.toml`.\n  [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#per-package-target)\n  [#9030](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9030)\n- Fixed build-std updating the index on every build.\n  [#9393](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9393)\n- `-Z help` now displays all the `-Z` options.\n  [#9369](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9369)\n- Added `-Zallow-features` to specify which nightly features are allowed to be used.\n  [#9283](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9283)\n- Added `cargo config` subcommand.\n  [#9302](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9302)\n\n## Cargo 1.52 (2021-05-06)\n[34170fcd...rust-1.52.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/34170fcd...rust-1.52.0)\n\n### Added\n- Added the `\"manifest_path\"` field to JSON messages for a package.\n  [#9022](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9022)\n  [#9247](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9247)\n\n### Changed\n- Build scripts are now forbidden from setting `RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP` on stable.\n  [#9181](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9181)\n  [#9385](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9385)\n- crates.io now supports SPDX 3.11 licenses.\n  [#9209](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9209)\n- An error is now reported if `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` is an empty string.\n  [#8939](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8939)\n- Doc tests now pass the `--message-format` flag into the test so that the\n  \"short\" format can now be used for doc tests.\n  [#9128](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9128)\n- `cargo test` now prints a clearer indicator of which target is currently running.\n  [#9195](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9195)\n- The `CARGO_TARGET_<TRIPLE>` environment variable will now issue a warning if\n  it is using lowercase letters.\n  [#9169](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9169)\n\n### Fixed\n- Fixed publication of packages with metadata and resolver fields in `Cargo.toml`.\n  [#9300](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9300)\n  [#9304](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9304)\n- Fixed logic for determining prefer-dynamic for a dylib which differed in a\n  workspace vs a single package.\n  [#9252](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9252)\n- Fixed an issue where exclusive target-specific dependencies that overlapped\n  across dependency kinds (like regular and build-dependencies) would\n  incorrectly include the dependencies in both.\n  [#9255](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9255)\n- Fixed panic with certain styles of Package IDs when passed to the `-p` flag.\n  [#9188](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9188)\n- When running cargo with output not going to a TTY, and with the progress bar\n  and color force-enabled, the output will now correctly clear the progress\n  line.\n  [#9231](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9231)\n- Error instead of panic when JSON may contain non-utf8 paths.\n  [#9226](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9226)\n- Fixed a hang that can happen on broken stderr.\n  [#9201](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9201)\n- Fixed thin-local LTO not being disabled correctly when `lto=off` is set.\n

package dependencies list\n  to show the path for \"path\" dependencies.\n  [#8994](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8994)\n- üî• Added a new feature resolver, and new CLI feature flag behavior. See the\n  new [features](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/features.html#feature-resolver-version-2)\n  and [resolver](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/resolver.html#feature-resolver-version-2)\n  documentation for the `resolver = \"2\"` option. See the\n  [CLI](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/features.html#command-line-feature-options)\n  and [resolver 2 CLI](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/features.html#resolver-version-2-command-line-flags)\n  options for the new CLI behavior. And, finally, see\n  [RFC 2957](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2957-cargo-features2.md)\n  for a detailed look at what has changed.\n  [#8997](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8997)\n\n### Changed\n- `cargo install --locked` now emits a warning if `Cargo.lock` is not found.\n  [#9108](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9108)\n- Unknown or ambiguous package IDs passed on the command-line now display\n  suggestions for the correct package ID.\n  [#9095](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9095)\n- Slightly optimize `cargo vendor`\n  [#8937](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8937)\n  [#9131](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9131)\n  [#9132](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9132)\n\n### Fixed\n- Fixed environment variables and cfg settings emitted by a build script that\n  are set for `cargo test` and `cargo run` when the build script runs multiple\n  times during the same build session.\n  [#9122](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9122)\n- Fixed a panic with `cargo doc` and the new feature resolver. This also\n  introduces some heuristics to try to avoid path collisions with `rustdoc` by\n  only documenting one variant of a package if there are multiple (such as\n  multiple versions, or the same package shared for host and target\n  platforms).\n  [#9077](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9077)\n- Fixed a bug in Cargo's cyclic dep graph detection that caused a stack\n  overflow.\n  [#9075](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9075)\n- Fixed build script `links` environment variables (`DEP_*`) not showing up\n  for testing packages in some cases.\n  [#9065](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9065)\n- Fixed features being selected in a nondeterministic way for a specific\n  scenario when building an entire workspace with all targets with a\n  proc-macro in the workspace with `resolver=\"2\"`.\n  [#9059](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9059)\n- Fixed to use `http.proxy` setting in `~/.gitconfig`.\n  [#8986](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8986)\n- Fixed --feature pkg/feat for V1 resolver for non-member.\n  [#9275](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9275)\n  [#9277](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9277)\n- Fixed panic in `cargo doc` when there are colliding output filenames in a workspace.\n  [#9276](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9276)\n  [#9277](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9277)\n- Fixed `cargo install` from exiting with success if one of several packages\n  did not install successfully.\n  [#9185](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9185)\n  [#9196](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9196)\n- Fix panic with doc collision orphan.\n  [#9142](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9142)\n  [#9196](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9196)\n\n### Nightly only\n- Removed the `publish-lockfile` unstable feature, it was stabilized without\n  the need for an explicit flag 1.5 years ago.\n  [#9092](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9092)\n- Added better diagnostics, help messages, and documentation for nightly\n  features (such as those passed with the `-Z` flag, or specified with\n  `cargo-features` in `Cargo.toml`).\n  [#9092](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9092)\n- Added support for Rust edition 2021.\n  [#8922](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8922)\n- Added support for the `rust-version` field in project metadata.\n  [#8037](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8037)\n- Added a schema field to the index.\n  [#9161](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9161)\n  [#9196](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9196)\n\n## Cargo 1.50 (2021-02-11)\n[8662ab42...rust-1.50.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/8662ab42...rust-1.50.0)\n\n### Added\n- Added the `doc` field to `cargo metadata`, which indicates if a target is\n  documented.\n  [#8869](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8869)\n- Added `RUSTC_WORKSPACE_WRAPPER`, an alternate RUSTC wrapper that only runs\n  for the local workspace packages, and caches its artifacts independently of\n  non-wrapped builds.\n  [#8976](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8976)\n- Added `--workspace` to `cargo update` to update only the workspace members,\n  and not their dependencies. This is particularly useful if you update the\n  version in `Cargo.toml` and want to update `Cargo.lock` without running any\n  other commands.\n  [#8725](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8725)\n\n### Changed\n- `.crate` files uploaded to a registry are now built with reproducible\n  settings, so that the same `.crate` file created on different machines\n  should be identical.\n  [#8864](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8864)\n- Git dependencies that specify more than one of `branch`, `tag`, or `rev` are\n  now rejected.\n  [#8984](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8984)\n- The `rerun-if-changed` build script directive can now point to a directory,\n  in which case Cargo will check if any file in that directory changes.\n  [#8973](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8973)\n- If Cargo cannot determine the username or email address, `cargo new` will no\n  longer fail, and instead create an empty authors list.\n  [#8912](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8912)\n- The progress bar width has been reduced to provide more room to display the\n  crates currently being built.\n  [#8892](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8892)\n- `cargo new` will now support `includeIf` directives in `.gitconfig` to match\n  the correct directory when determining the username and email address.\n  [#8886](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8886)\n\n### Fixed\n- Fixed `cargo metadata` and `cargo tree` to only download packages for the\n  requested target.\n  [#8987](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8987)\n- Updated libgit2, which brings in many fixes, particularly fixing a zlib\n  error that occasionally appeared on 32-bit systems.\n  [#8998](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8998)\n- Fixed stack overflow with a circular dev-dependency that uses the `links`\n  field.\n  [#8969](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8969)\n- Fixed `cargo publish` failing on some filesystems, particularly 9p on WSL2.\n  [#8950](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8950)\n\n### Nightly only\n- Allow `resolver=\"1\"` to specify the original feature resolution behavior.\n  [#8857](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8857)\n- Added `-Z extra-link-arg` which adds the `cargo:rustc-link-arg-bins`\n  and `cargo:rustc-link-arg` build script options.\n  [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#extra-link-arg)\n  [#8441](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8441)\n- Implemented external credential process support, and added `cargo logout`.\n  ([RFC 2730](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2730-cargo-token-from-process.md))\n  ([docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#credential-process))\n  [#8934](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8934)\n- Fix panic with `-Zbuild-std` and no roots.\n  [#8942](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8942)\n- Set docs.rs as the default extern-map for crates.io\n  [#8877](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8877)\n\n## Cargo 1.49 (2020-12-31)\n[75615f8e...rust-1.49.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/75615f8e...rust-1.49.0)\n\n### Added\n- Added `homepage` and `documentation` fields to `cargo metadata`.\n  [#8744](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8744)\n- Added the `CARGO_PRIMARY_PACKAGE` environment variable which is set when\n  running `rustc` if the package is one of the \"root\" packages selected on the\n  command line.\n  [#8758](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8758)\n- Added support for Unix-style glob patterns for package and target selection\n  flags on the command-line (such as `-p 'serde*'` or `--test '*'`).\n  [#8752](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8752)\n\n### Changed\n- Computed LTO flags are now included in the filename metadata hash so that\n  changes in LTO settings will independently cache build artifacts instead of\n  overwriting previous ones. This prevents rebuilds in some situations such as\n  switching between `cargo build` and `cargo test` in some circumstances.\n  [#8755](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8755)\n- `cargo tree` now displays `(proc-macro)` next to proc-macro packages.\n  [#8765](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8765)\n- Added a warning that the allowed characters for a feature name have been\n  restricted to letters, digits, `_`, `-`, and `+` to accommodate future\n  syntax changes. This is still a superset of the allowed syntax on crates.io,\n  which requires ASCII. This is intended to be changed to an error in the\n  future.\n  [#8814](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8814)\n- `-p` without a value will now print a list of workspace package names.\n  [#8808](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8808)\n- Add period to allowed feature name characters.\n  [#8932](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8932)\n  [#8943](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8943)\n\n### Fixed\n- Fixed building a library with both \"dylib\" and \"rlib\" crate types with LTO enabled.\n  [#8754](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8754)\n- Fixed paths in Cargo's dep-info files.\n  [#8819](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8819)\n- Fixed inconsistent source IDs in `cargo metadata` for git dependencies that\n  explicitly specify `branch=\"master\"`.\n  [#8824](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8824)\n- Fixed re-extracting dependencies which contained a `.cargo-ok` file.\n  [#8835](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8835)\n\n### Nightly only\n- Fixed a panic with `cargo doc -Zfeatures=itarget` in some situations.\n  [#8777](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8777)\n- New implementation for namespaced features, using the syntax `dep:serde`.\n  [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#namespaced-features)\n  [#8799](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8799)\n- Added support for \"weak\" dependency features, using the syntax\n  `dep_name?/feat_name`, which will enable a feature for a dependency without\n  also enabling the dependency.\n  [#8818](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8818)\n- Fixed the new feature resolver downloading extra dependencies that weren't\n  strictly necessary.\n  [#8823](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8823)\n\n## Cargo 1.48 (2020-11-19)\n[51b66125...rust-1.48.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/51b66125...rust-1.48.0)\n\n### Added\n- Added `term.progress` configuration option to control when and how the\n  progress bar is displayed.\n  [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/config.html#termprogresswhen)\n  [#8165](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8165)\n- Added `--message-format plain` option to `cargo locate-project` to display\n  the project location without JSON to make it easier to use in a script.\n  [#8707](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8707)\n- Added `--workspace` option to `cargo locate-project` to display the path to\n  the workspace manifest.\n  [#8712](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8712)\n- A new contributor guide has been added for contributing to Cargo itself.\n  This is published at <https://rust-lang.github.io/cargo/contrib/>.\n  [#8715](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8715)\n- Zsh `--target` completion will now complete with the built-in rustc targets.\n  [#8740](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8740)\n\n### Changed\n\n### Fixed\n- Fixed `cargo new` creating a fossil repository to properly ignore the `target` directory.\n  [#8671](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8671)\n- Don't show warnings about the workspace in the current directory when using `cargo install`\n  of a remote package.\n  [#8681](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8681)\n- Automatically reinitialize the index when an \"Object not found\" error is\n  encountered in the git repository.\n  [#8735](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8735)\n- Updated libgit2, which brings in several fixes for git repository handling.\n  [#8778](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8778)\n  [#8780](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8780)\n\n### Nightly only\n- Fixed `cargo install` so that it will ignore the `[unstable]` table in local config files.\n  [#8656](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8656)\n- Fixed nondeterministic behavior of the new feature resolver.\n  [#8701](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8701)\n- Fixed running `cargo test` on a proc-macro with the new feature resolver\n  under a specific combination of circumstances.\n  [#8742](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8742)\n\n## Cargo 1.47 (2020-10-08)\n[4f74d9b2...rust-1.47.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/4f74d9b2...rust-1.47.0)\n\n### Added\n- `cargo doc` will now include the package's version in the left sidebar.\n  [#8509](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8509)\n- Added the `test` field to `cargo metadata` targets.\n  [#8478](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8478)\n- Cargo's man pages are now displayed via the `cargo help` command (such as\n  `cargo help build`).\n  [#8456](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8456)\n  [#8577](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8577)\n- Added new documentation chapters on [how dependency resolution\n  works](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/resolver.html) and\n  [SemVer\n  compatibility](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/semver.html),\n  along with suggestions on how to version your project and work with\n  dependencies.\n  [#8609](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8609)\n\n### Changed\n- The comments added to `.gitignore` when it is modified have been tweaked to\n  add some spacing.\n  [#8476](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8476)\n- `cargo metadata` output should now be sorted to be deterministic.\n  [#8489](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8489)\n- By default, build scripts and proc-macros are now built with `opt-level=0`\n  and the default codegen units, even in release mode.\n  [#8500](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8500)\n- `workspace.default-members` is now filtered by `workspace.exclude`.\n  [#8485](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8485)\n- `workspace.members` globs now ignore non-directory paths.\n  [#8511](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8511)\n- git zlib errors now trigger a retry.\n  [#8520](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8520)\n- \"http\" class git errors now trigger a retry.\n  [#8553](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8553)\n- git dependencies now override the `core.autocrlf` git configuration value to\n  ensure they behave consistently across platforms, particularly when\n  vendoring git dependencies on Windows.\n  [#8523](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8523)\n- If `Cargo.lock` needs to be updated, then it will be automatically\n  transitioned to the new V2 format. This format removes the `[metadata]`\n  table, and should be easier to merge changes in source control systems. This\n  format was introduced in 1.38, and made the default for new projects in\n  1.41.\n  [#8554](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8554)\n- Added preparation for support of git repositories with a non-\"master\"\n  default branch. Actual support will arrive in a future version. This\n  introduces some warnings:\n  - Warn if a git dependency does not specify a branch, and the default branch\n    on the repository is not \"master\". In the future, Cargo will fetch the\n    default branch. In this scenario, the branch should be explicitly\n    specified.\n  - Warn if a workspace has multiple dependencies to the same git repository,\n    one without a `branch` and one with `branch=\"master\"`. Dependencies should\n    all use one form or the other.\n  [#8522](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8522)\n- Warnings are now issued if a `required-features` entry lists a feature that\n  does not exist.\n  [#7950](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7950)\n- Built-in aliases are now included in `cargo --list`.\n  [#8542](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8542)\n- `cargo install` with a specific version that has been yanked will now\n  display an error message that it has been yanked, instead of \"could not\n  find\".\n  [#8565](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8565)\n- `cargo publish` with a package that has the `publish` field set to a single\n  registry, and no `--registry` flag has been given, will now publish to that\n  registry instead of generating an error.\n  [#8571](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8571)\n\n### Fixed\n- Fixed issue where if a project directory was moved, and one of the\n  build scripts did not use the `rerun-if-changed` directive, then that\n  build script was being rebuilt when it shouldn't.\n  [#8497](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8497)\n- Console colors should now work on Windows 7 and 8.\n  [#8540](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8540)\n- The `CARGO_TARGET_{triplet}_RUNNER` environment variable will now correctly\n  override the config file instead of trying to merge the commands.\n  [#8629](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8629)\n- Fixed LTO with doctests.\n  [#8657](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8657)\n  [#8658](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8658)\n\n### Nightly only\n- Added support for `-Z terminal-width` which tells `rustc` the width of the\n  terminal so that it can format diagnostics better.\n  [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#terminal-width)\n  [#8427](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8427)\n- Added ability to configure `-Z` unstable flags in config files via the\n  `[unstable]` table.\n  [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html)\n  [#8393](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8393)\n- Added `-Z build-std-features` flag to set features for the standard library.\n  [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#build-std-features)\n  [#8490](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8490)\n\n## Cargo 1.46 (2020-08-27)\n[9fcb8c1d...rust-1.46.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/9fcb8c1d...rust-1.46.0)\n\n### Added\n- The `dl` key in `config.json` of a registry index now supports the\n  replacement markers `{prefix}` and `{lowerprefix}` to allow spreading crates\n  across directories similar to how the index itself is structured.\n  [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/registries.html#index-format)\n  [#8267](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8267)\n- Added new environment variables that are set during compilation:\n  - `CARGO_CRATE_NAME`: The name of the crate being built.\n  - `CARGO_BIN_NAME`: The name of the executable binary (if this is a binary crate).\n  - `CARGO_PKG_LICENSE`: The `license` field from the manifest.\n  - `CARGO_PKG_LICENSE_FILE`: The `license-file` field from the manifest.\n  [#8270](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8270)\n  [#8325](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8325)\n  [#8387](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8387)\n- If the value for `readme` is not specified in `Cargo.toml`, it is now\n  automatically inferred from the existence of a file named `README`,\n  `README.md`, or `README.txt`. This can be suppressed by setting\n  `readme = false`.\n  [#8277](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8277)\n- `cargo install` now supports the `--index` flag to install directly from an index.\n  [#8344](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8344)\n- Added the `metadata` table to the `workspace` definition in `Cargo.toml`.\n  This can be used for arbitrary data similar to the `package.metadata` table.\n  [#8323](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8323)\n- Added the `--target-dir` flag to `cargo install` to set the target directory.\n  [#8391](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8391)\n- Changes to environment variables used by the\n  [`env!`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.env.html) or\n  [`option_env!`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.option_env.html) macros\n  are now automatically detected to trigger a rebuild.\n  [#8421](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8421)\n- The `target` directory now includes the `CACHEDIR.TAG` file which is used by\n  some tools to exclude the directory from backups.\n  [#8378](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8378)\n- Added docs about rustup's `+toolchain` syntax.\n  [#8455](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8455)\n\n### Changed\n- A warning is now displayed if a git dependency includes a `#` fragment in\n  the URL. This was potentially confusing because Cargo itself displays git\n  URLs with this syntax, but it does not have any meaning outside of the\n  `Cargo.lock` file, and would not work properly.\n  [#8297](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8297)\n- Various optimizations and fixes for bitcode embedding and LTO.\n  [#8349](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8349)\n- Reduced the amount of data fetched for git dependencies. If Cargo knows the\n  branch or tag to fetch, it will now only fetch that branch or tag instead of\n  all branches and tags.\n  [#8363](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8363)\n- Enhanced git fetch error messages.\n  [#8409](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8409)\n- `.crate` files are now generated with GNU tar format instead of UStar, which\n  supports longer file names.\n  [#8453](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8453)\n\n### Fixed\n- Fixed a rare situation where an update to `Cargo.lock` failed once, but then\n  subsequent runs allowed it proceed.\n  [#8274](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8274)\n- Removed assertion that Windows dylibs must have a `.dll` extension. Some\n  custom JSON spec targets may change the extension.\n  [#8310](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8310)\n- Updated libgit2, which brings in a fix for zlib errors for some remote\n  git servers like googlesource.com.\n  [#8320](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8320)\n- Fixed the GitHub fast-path check for up-to-date git dependencies on\n  non-master branches.\n  [#8363](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8363)\n- Fixed issue when enabling a feature with `pkg/feature` syntax, and `pkg` is\n  an optional dependency, but also a dev-dependency, and the dev-dependency\n  appears before the optional normal dependency in the registry summary, then\n  the optional dependency would not get activated.\n  [#8395](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8395)\n- Fixed `clean -p` deleting the build directory if there is a test named\n  `build`.\n  [#8398](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8398)\n- Fixed indentation of multi-line Cargo error messages.\n  [#8409](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8409)\n- Fixed issue where the automatic inclusion of the `--document-private-items`\n  flag for rustdoc would override any flags passed to the `cargo rustdoc`\n  command.\n  [#8449](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8449)\n- Cargo will now include a version in the hash of the fingerprint directories\n  to support backwards-incompatible changes to the fingerprint structure.\n  [#8473](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8473)\n  [#8488](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8488)\n\n### Nightly only\n- Added `-Zrustdoc-map` feature which provides external mappings for rustdoc\n  (such as https://docs.rs/ links).\n  [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#rustdoc-map)\n  [#8287](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8287)\n- Fixed feature calculation when a proc-macro is declared in `Cargo.toml` with\n  an underscore (like `proc_macro = true`).\n  [#8319](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8319)\n- Added support for setting `-Clinker` with `-Zdoctest-xcompile`.\n  [#8359](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8359)\n- Fixed setting the `strip` profile field in config files.\n  [#8454](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8454)\n\n## Cargo 1.45 (2020-07-16)\n[ebda5065e...rust-1.45.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/ebda5065...rust-1.45.0)\n\n### Added\n\n### Changed\n- Changed official documentation to recommend `.cargo/config.toml` filenames\n  (with the `.toml` extension). `.toml` extension support was added in 1.39.\n  [#8121](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8121)\n- The `registry.index` config value is no longer allowed (it has been\n  deprecated for 4 years).\n  [#7973](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7973)\n- An error is generated if both `--index` and `--registry` are passed\n  (previously `--index` was silently ignored).\n  [#7973](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7973)\n- The `registry.token` config value is no longer used with the `--index` flag.\n  This is intended to avoid potentially leaking the crates.io token to another\n  registry.\n  [#7973](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7973)\n- Added a warning if `registry.token` is used with source replacement. It is\n  intended this will be an error in future versions.\n  [#7973](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7973)\n- Windows GNU targets now copy `.dll.a` import library files for DLL crate\n  types to the output directory.\n  [#8141](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8141)\n- Dylibs for all dependencies are now unconditionally copied to the output\n  directory. Some obscure scenarios can cause an old dylib to be referenced\n  between builds, and this ensures that all the latest copies are used.\n  [#8139](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8139)\n- `package.exclude` can now match directory names. If a directory is\n  specified, the entire directory will be excluded, and Cargo will not attempt\n  to inspect it further. Previously Cargo would try to check every file in the\n  directory which could cause problems if the directory contained unreadable\n  files.\n  [#8095](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8095)\n- When packaging with `cargo publish` or `cargo package`, Cargo can use git to\n  guide its decision on which files to include. Previously this git-based\n  logic required a `Cargo.toml` file to exist at the root of the repository.\n  This is no longer required, so Cargo will now use git-based guidance even if\n  there is not a `Cargo.toml` in the root of the repository.\n  [#8095](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8095)\n- While unpacking a crate on Windows, if it fails to write a file because the\n  file is a reserved Windows filename (like \"aux.rs\"), Cargo will display an\n  extra message to explain why it failed.\n  [#8136](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8136)\n- Failures to set mtime on files are now ignored. Some filesystems did not\n  support this.\n  [#8185](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8185)\n- Certain classes of git errors will now recommend enabling\n  `net.git-fetch-with-cli`.\n  [#8166](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8166)\n- When doing an LTO build, Cargo will now instruct rustc not to perform\n  codegen when possible. This may result in a faster build and use less disk\n  space. Additionally, for non-LTO builds, Cargo will instruct rustc to not\n  embed LLVM bitcode in libraries, which should decrease their size.\n  [#8192](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8192)\n  [#8226](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8226)\n  [#8254](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8254)\n- The implementation for `cargo clean -p` has been rewritten so that it can\n  more accurately remove the files for a specific package.\n  [#8210](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8210)\n- The way Cargo computes the outputs from a build has been rewritten to be\n  more complete and accurate. Newly tracked files will be displayed in JSON\n  messages, and may be uplifted to the output directory in some cases. Some of\n  the changes from this are:\n\n  - `.exp` export files on Windows MSVC dynamic libraries are now tracked.\n  - Proc-macros on Windows track import/export files.\n  - All targets (like tests, etc.) that generate separate debug files\n    (pdb/dSYM) are tracked.\n  - Added .map files for wasm32-unknown-emscripten.\n  - macOS dSYM directories are tracked for all dynamic libraries\n    (dylib/cdylib/proc-macro) and for build scripts.\n\n  There are a variety of other changes as a consequence of this:\n\n  - Binary examples on Windows MSVC with a hyphen will now show up twice in\n    the examples directory (`foo_bar.exe` and `foo-bar.exe`). Previously Cargo\n    just renamed the file instead of hard-linking it.\n  - Example libraries now follow the same rules for hyphen/underscore\n    translation as normal libs (they will now use underscores).\n\n  [#8210](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8210)\n- Cargo attempts to scrub any secrets from the debug log for HTTP debugging.\n  [#8222](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8222)\n- Context has been added to many of Cargo's filesystem operations, so that\n  error messages now provide more information, such as the path that caused\n  the problem.\n  [#8232](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8232)\n- Several commands now ignore the error if stdout or stderr is closed while it\n  is running. For example `cargo install --list | grep -q cargo-fuzz` would\n  previously sometimes panic because `grep -q` may close stdout before the\n  command finishes. Regular builds continue to fail if stdout or stderr is\n  closed, matching the behavior of many other build systems.\n  [#8236](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8236)\n- If `cargo install` is given an exact version, like `--version=1.2.3`, it\n  will now avoid updating the index if that version is already installed, and\n  exit quickly indicating it is already installed.\n  [#8022](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8022)\n- Changes to the `[patch]` section will now attempt to automatically update\n  `Cargo.lock` to the new version. It should now also provide better error\n  messages for the rare cases where it is unable to automatically update.\n  [#8248](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8248)\n\n### Fixed\n- Fixed copying Windows `.pdb` files to the output directory when the filename\n  contained dashes.\n  [#8123](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8123)\n- Fixed error where Cargo would fail when scanning if a package is inside a\n  git repository when any of its ancestor paths is a symlink.\n  [#8186](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8186)\n- Fixed `cargo update` with an unused `[patch]` so that it does not get\n  stuck and refuse to update.\n  [#8243](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8243)\n- Fixed a situation where Cargo would hang if stderr is closed, and the\n  compiler generated a large number of messages.\n  [#8247](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8247)\n- Fixed backtraces on macOS not showing filenames or line numbers. As a\n  consequence of this, binary executables on apple targets do not include a\n  hash in the filename in Cargo's cache. This means Cargo can only track one\n  copy, so if you switch features or rustc versions, Cargo will need to\n  rebuild the executable.\n  [#8329](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8329)\n  [#8335](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8335)\n- Fixed fingerprinting when using lld on Windows with a dylib. Cargo was\n  erroneously thinking the dylib was never fresh.\n  [#8290](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8290)\n  [#8335](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8335)\n\n### Nightly only\n- Fixed passing the full path for `--target` to `rustdoc` when using JSON spec\n  targets.\n  [#8094](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8094)\n- `-Cembed-bitcode=no` renamed to `-Cbitcode-in-rlib=no`\n  [#8134](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8134)\n- Added new `resolver` field to `Cargo.toml` to opt-in to the new feature\n  resolver.\n  [#8129](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8129)\n- `-Zbuild-std` no longer treats std dependencies as \"local\". This means that\n  it won't use incremental compilation for those dependencies, removes them\n  from dep-info files, and caps lints at \"allow\".\n  [#8177](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8177)\n- Added `-Zmultitarget` which allows multiple `--target` flags to build the\n  same thing for multiple targets at once.\n  [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#multitarget)\n  [#8167](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8167)\n- Added `strip` option to the profile to remove symbols and debug information.\n  [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#profile-strip-option)\n  [#8246](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8246)\n- Fixed panic with `cargo tree --target=all -Zfeatures=all`.\n  [#8269](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8269)\n\n## Cargo 1.44 (2020-06-04)\n[bda50510...rust-1.44.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/bda50510...rust-1.44.0)\n\n### Added\n- üî• Added the `cargo tree` command.\n  [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/commands/cargo-tree.html)\n  [#8062](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8062)\n- Added warnings if a package has Windows-restricted filenames (like `nul`,\n  `con`, `aux`, `prn`, etc.).\n  [#7959](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7959)\n- Added a `\"build-finished\"` JSON message when compilation is complete so that\n  tools can detect when they can stop listening for JSON messages with\n  commands like `cargo run` or `cargo test`.\n  [#8069](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8069)\n\n### Changed\n- Valid package names are now restricted to Unicode XID identifiers. This is\n  mostly the same as before, except package names cannot start with a number\n  or `-`.\n  [#7959](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7959)\n- `cargo new` and `init` will warn or reject additional package names\n  (reserved Windows names, reserved Cargo directories, non-ASCII names,\n  conflicting std names like `core`, etc.).\n  [#7959](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7959)\n- Tests are no longer hard-linked into the output directory (`target/debug/`).\n  This ensures tools will have access to debug symbols and execute tests in\n  the same way as Cargo. Tools should use JSON messages to discover the path\n  to the executable.\n  [#7965](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7965)\n- Updating git submodules now displays an \"Updating\" message for each\n  submodule.\n  [#7989](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7989)\n- File modification times are now preserved when extracting a `.crate` file.\n  This reverses the change made in 1.40 where the mtime was not preserved.\n  [#7935](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7935)\n- Build script warnings are now displayed separately when the build script\n  fails.\n  [#8017](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8017)\n- Removed the `git-checkout` subcommand.\n  [#8040](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8040)\n- The progress bar is now enabled for all unix platforms. Previously it was\n  only Linux, macOS, and FreeBSD.\n  [#8054](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8054)\n- Artifacts generated by pre-release versions of `rustc` now share the same\n  filenames. This means that changing nightly versions will not leave stale\n  files in the build directory.\n  [#8073](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8073)\n- Invalid package names are rejected when using renamed dependencies.\n  [#8090](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8090)\n- Added a certain class of HTTP2 errors as \"spurious\" that will get retried.\n  [#8102](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8102)\n- Allow `cargo package --list` to succeed, even if there are other validation\n  errors (such as `Cargo.lock` generation problem, or missing dependencies).\n  [#8175](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8175)\n  [#8215](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8215)\n\n### Fixed\n- Cargo no longer buffers excessive amounts of compiler output in memory.\n  [#7838](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7838)\n- Symbolic links in git repositories now work on Windows.\n  [#7996](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7996)\n- Fixed an issue where `profile.dev` was not loaded from a config file with\n  `cargo test` when the `dev` profile was not defined in `Cargo.toml`.\n  [#8012](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8012)\n- When a binary is built as an implicit dependency of an integration test,\n  it now checks `dep_name/feature_name` syntax in `required-features` correctly.\n  [#8020](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8020)\n- Fixed an issue where Cargo would not detect that an executable (such as an\n  integration test) needs to be rebuilt when the previous build was\n  interrupted with Ctrl-C.\n  [#8087](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8087)\n- Protect against some (unknown) situations where Cargo could panic when the\n  system monotonic clock doesn't appear to be monotonic.\n  [#8114](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8114)\n- Fixed panic with `cargo clean -p` if the package has a build script.\n  [#8216](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8216)\n\n### Nightly only\n- Fixed panic with new feature resolver and required-features.\n  [#7962](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7962)\n- Added `RUSTC_WORKSPACE_WRAPPER` environment variable, which provides a way\n  to wrap `rustc` for workspace members only, and affects the filename hash so\n  that artifacts produced by the wrapper are cached separately. This usage can\n  be seen on nightly clippy with `cargo clippy -Zunstable-options`.\n  [#7533](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7533)\n- Added `--unit-graph` CLI option to display Cargo's internal dependency graph\n  as JSON.\n  [#7977](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7977)\n- Changed `-Zbuild_dep` to `-Zhost_dep`, and added proc-macros to the feature\n  decoupling logic.\n  [#8003](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8003)\n  [#8028](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8028)\n- Fixed so that `--crate-version` is not automatically passed when the flag\n  is found in `RUSTDOCFLAGS`.\n  [#8014](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8014)\n- Fixed panic with `-Zfeatures=dev_dep` and `check --profile=test`.\n  [#8027](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8027)\n- Fixed panic with `-Zfeatures=itarget` with certain host dependencies.\n  [#8048](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8048)\n- Added support for `-Cembed-bitcode=no`, which provides a performance boost\n  and disk-space usage reduction for non-LTO builds.\n  [#8066](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8066)\n- `-Zpackage-features` has been extended with several changes intended to make\n  it easier to select features on the command-line in a workspace.\n  [#8074](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/8074)\n\n## Cargo 1.43 (2020-04-23)\n[9d32b7b0...rust-1.43.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/9d32b7b0...rust-1.43.0)\n\n### Added\n- üî• Profiles may now be specified in config files (and environment variables).\n  [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/config.html#profile)\n  [#7823](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7823)\n- ‚ùó Added `CARGO_BIN_EXE_<name>` environment variable when building\n  integration tests. This variable contains the path to any `[[bin]]` targets\n  in the package. Integration tests should use the `env!` macro to determine\n  the path to a binary to execute.\n  [docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/environment-variables.html#environment-variables-cargo-sets-for-crates)\n  [#7697](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7697)\n\n### Changed\n- `cargo install --git` now honors workspaces in a git repository. This allows\n  workspace settings, like `[patch]`, `[replace]`, or `[profile]` to be used.\n  [#7768](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7768)\n- `cargo new` will now run `rustfmt` on the new files to pick up rustfmt\n  settings like `tab_spaces` so that the new file matches the user's preferred\n  indentation settings.\n  [#7827](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7827)\n- Environment variables printed with \"very verbose\" output (`-vv`) are now\n  consistently sorted.\n  [#7877](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7877)\n- Debug logging for fingerprint rebuild-detection now includes more information.\n  [#7888](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7888)\n  [#7890](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7890)\n  [#7952](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7952)\n- Added warning during publish if the license-file doesn't exist.\n  [#7905](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7905)\n- The `license-file` file is automatically included during publish, even if it\n  is not explicitly listed in the `include` list or is in a location outside\n  of the root of the package.\n  [#7905](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7905)\n- `CARGO_CFG_DEBUG_ASSERTIONS` and `CARGO_CFG_PROC_MACRO` are no longer set\n  when running a build script. These were inadvertently set in the past, but\n  had no meaning as they were always true. Additionally, `cfg(proc-macro)`\n  is no longer supported in a `target` expression.\n  [#7943](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7943)\n  [#7970](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7970)\n\n### Fixed\n- Global command-line flags now work with aliases (like `cargo -v b`).\n  [#7837](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7837)\n- Required-features using dependency syntax (like `renamed_dep/feat_name`) now\n  handle renamed dependencies correctly.\n  [#7855](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7855)\n- Fixed a rare situation where if a build script is run multiple times during\n  the same build, Cargo will now keep the results separate instead of losing\n  the output of the first execution.\n  [#7857](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7857)\n- Fixed incorrect interpretation of environment variable\n  `CARGO_TARGET_*_RUNNER=true` as a boolean. Also improved related env var\n  error messages.\n  [#7891](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7891)\n- Updated internal libgit2 library, bringing various fixes to git support.\n  [#7939](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7939)\n- `cargo package` / `cargo publish` should no longer buffer the entire\n  contents of each file in memory.\n  [#7946](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7946)\n- Ignore more invalid `Cargo.toml` files in a git dependency. Cargo currently\n  walks the entire repo to find the requested package. Certain invalid\n  manifests were already skipped, and now it should skip all of them.\n  [#7947](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7947)\n\n### Nightly only\n- Added `build.out-dir` config variable to set the output directory.\n  [#7810](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7810)\n- Added `-Zjobserver-per-rustc` feature to support improved performance for\n  parallel rustc.\n  [#7731](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7731)\n- Fixed filename collision with `build-std` and crates like `cc`.\n  [#7860](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7860)\n- `-Ztimings` will now save its report even if there is an error.\n  [#7872](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7872)\n- Updated `--config` command-line flag to support taking a path to a config\n  file to load.\n  [#7901](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7901)\n- Added new feature resolver.\n  [#7820](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7820)\n- Rustdoc docs now automatically include the version of the package in the\n  side bar (requires `-Z crate-versions` flag).\n  [#7903](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7903)\n\n## Cargo 1.42 (2020-03-12)\n[0bf7aafe...rust-1.42.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/0bf7aafe...rust-1.42.0)\n\n### Added\n- Added documentation on git authentication.\n  [#7658](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7658)\n- Bitbucket Pipeline badges are now supported on crates.io.\n  [#7663](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7663)\n- `cargo vendor` now accepts the `--versioned-dirs` option to force it to\n  always include the version number in each package's directory name.\n  [#7631](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7631)\n- The `proc_macro` crate is now automatically added to the extern prelude for\n  proc-macro packages. This means that `extern crate proc_macro;` is no longer\n  necessary for proc-macros.\n  [#7700](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7700)\n\n### Changed\n- Emit a warning if `debug_assertions`, `test`, `proc_macro`, or `feature=` is\n  used in a `cfg()` expression.\n  [#7660](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7660)\n- Large update to the Cargo documentation, adding new chapters on Cargo\n  targets, workspaces, and features.\n  [#7733](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7733)\n- Windows: `.lib` DLL import libraries are now copied next to the dll for all\n  Windows MSVC targets. Previously it was only supported for\n  `pc-windows-msvc`. This adds DLL support for `uwp-windows-msvc` targets.\n  [#7758](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7758)\n- The `ar` field in the `[target]` configuration is no longer read. It has\n  been ignored for over 4 years.\n  [#7763](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7763)\n- Bash completion file simplified and updated for latest changes.\n  [#7789](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7789)\n- Credentials are only loaded when needed, instead of every Cargo command.\n  [#7774](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7774)\n\n### Fixed\n- Removed `--offline` empty index check, which was a false positive in some\n  cases.\n  [#7655](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7655)\n- Files and directories starting with a `.` can now be included in a package\n  by adding it to the `include` list.\n  [#7680](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7680)\n- Fixed `cargo login` removing alternative registry tokens when previous\n  entries existed in the credentials file.\n  [#7708](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7708)\n- Fixed `cargo vendor` from panicking when used with alternative registries.\n  [#7718](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7718)\n- Fixed incorrect explanation in the fingerprint debug log message.\n  [#7749](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7749)\n- A `[source]` that is defined multiple times will now result in an error.\n  Previously it was randomly picking a source, which could cause\n  non-deterministic behavior.\n  [#7751](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7751)\n- `dep_kinds` in `cargo metadata` are now de-duplicated.\n  [#7756](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7756)\n- Fixed packaging where `Cargo.lock` was listed in `.gitignore` in a\n  subdirectory inside a git repository. Previously it was assuming\n  `Cargo.lock` was at the root of the repo.\n  [#7779](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7779)\n- Partial file transfer errors will now cause an automatic retry.\n  [#7788](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7788)\n- Linux: Fixed panic if CPU iowait stat decreases.\n  [#7803](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7803)\n- Fixed using the wrong sysroot for detecting host compiler settings when\n  `--sysroot` is passed in via `RUSTFLAGS`.\n  [#7798](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7798)\n\n### Nightly only\n- `build-std` now uses `--extern` instead of `--sysroot` to find sysroot\n  packages.\n  [#7699](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7699)\n- Added `--config` command-line option to set config settings.\n  [#7649](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7649)\n- Added `include` config setting which allows including another config file.\n  [#7649](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7649)\n- Profiles in config files now support any named profile. Previously it was\n  limited to dev/release.\n  [#7750](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7750)\n\n## Cargo 1.41 (2020-01-30)\n[5da4b4d4...rust-1.41.0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/5da4b4d4...rust-1.41.0)\n\n### Added\n- üî• Cargo now uses a new `Cargo.lock` file format. This new format should\n  support easier merges in source control systems. Projects using the old\n  format will continue to use the old format, only new `Cargo.lock` files will\n  use the new format.\n  [#7579](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7579)\n- üî• `cargo install` will now upgrade already installed packages instead of\n  failing.\n  [#7560](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7560)\n- üî• Profile overrides have been added. This allows overriding profiles for\n  individual dependencies or build scripts. See [the\n  documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/profiles.html#overrides)\n  for more.\n  [#7591](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7591)\n- Added new documentation for build scripts.\n  [#7565](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7565)\n- Added documentation for Cargo's JSON output.\n  [#7595](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7595)\n- Significant expansion of config and environment variable documentation.\n  [#7650](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7650)\n- Add back support for `BROWSER` environment variable for `cargo doc --open`.\n  [#7576](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7576)\n- Added `kind` and `platform` for dependencies in `cargo metadata`.\n  [#7132](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7132)\n- The `OUT_DIR` value is now included in the `build-script-executed` JSON message.\n  [#7622](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7622)\n\n### Changed\n- `cargo doc` will now document private items in binaries by default.\n  [#7593](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7593)\n- Subcommand typo suggestions now include aliases.\n  [#7486](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7486)\n- Tweak how the \"already existing...\" comment is added to `.gitignore`.\n  [#7570](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7570)\n- Ignore `cargo login` text from copy/paste in token.\n  [#7588](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7588)\n- Windows: Ignore errors for locking files when not supported by the filesystem.\n  [#7602](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7602)\n- Remove `**/*.rs.bk` from `.gitignore`.\n  [#7647](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7647)\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix unused warnings for some keys in the `build` config section.\n  [#7575](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7575)\n- Linux: Don't panic when parsing `/proc/stat`.\n  [#7580](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7580)\n- Don't show canonical path in `cargo vendor`.\n  [#7629](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7629)\n\n### Nightly only\n\n\n## Cargo 1.40 (2019-12-19)\n[1c6ec66d...5da4b4d4](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/1c6ec66d...5da4b4d4)\n\n### Added\n- Added `http.ssl-version` config option to control the version of TLS,\n  along with min/max versions.\n  [#7308](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7308)\n- üî• Compiler warnings are now cached on disk. If a build generates warnings,\n  re-running the build will now re-display the warnings.\n  [#7450](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7450)\n- Added `--filter-platform` option to `cargo metadata` to narrow the nodes\n  shown in the resolver graph to only packages included for the given target\n  triple.\n  [#7376](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7376)\n\n### Changed\n- Cargo's \"platform\" `cfg` parsing has been extracted into a separate crate\n  named `cargo-platform`.\n  [#7375](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7375)\n- Dependencies extracted into Cargo's cache no longer preserve mtimes to\n  reduce syscall overhead.\n  [#7465](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7465)\n- Windows: EXE files no longer include a metadata hash in the filename.\n  This helps with debuggers correlating the filename with the PDB file.\n  [#7400](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7400)\n- Wasm32: `.wasm` files are no longer treated as an \"executable\", allowing\n  `cargo test` and `cargo run` to work properly with the generated `.js` file.\n  [#7476](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7476)\n- crates.io now supports SPDX 3.6 licenses.\n  [#7481](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7481)\n- Improved cyclic dependency error message.\n  [#7470](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7470)\n- Bare `cargo clean` no longer locks the package cache.\n  [#7502](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7502)\n- `cargo publish` now allows dev-dependencies without a version key to be\n  published. A git or path-only dev-dependency will be removed from the\n  package manifest before uploading.\n  [#7333](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7333)\n- `--features` and `--no-default-features` in the root of a virtual workspace\n  will now generate an error instead of being ignored.\n  [#7507](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7507)\n- Generated files (like `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock`) in a package archive\n  now have their timestamp set to the current time instead of the epoch.\n  [#7523](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7523)\n- The `-Z` flag parser is now more strict, rejecting more invalid syntax.\n  [#7531](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7531)\n\n### Fixed\n- Fixed an issue where if a package had an `include` field, and `Cargo.lock`\n  in `.gitignore`, and a binary or example target, and the `Cargo.lock` exists\n  in the current project, it would fail to publish complaining the\n  `Cargo.lock` was dirty.\n  [#7448](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7448)\n- Fixed a panic in a particular combination of `[patch]` entries.\n  [#7452](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7452)\n- Windows: Better error message when `cargo test` or `rustc` crashes in an\n  abnormal way, such as a signal or seg fault.\n  [#7535](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7535)\n\n### Nightly only\n- The `mtime-on-use` feature may now be enabled via the\n  `unstable.mtime_on_use` config option.\n  [#7411](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7411)\n- Added support for named profiles.\n  [#6989](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6989)\n- Added `-Zpanic-abort-tests` to allow building and running tests with the\n  \"abort\" panic strategy.\n  [#7460](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7460)\n- Changed `build-std` to use `--sysroot`.\n  [#7421](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7421)\n- Various fixes and enhancements to `-Ztimings`.\n  [#7395](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7395)\n  [#7398](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7398)\n  [#7397](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7397)\n  [#7403](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7403)\n  [#7428](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7428)\n  [#7429](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7429)\n- Profile overrides have renamed the syntax to be\n  `[profile.dev.package.NAME]`.\n  [#7504](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7504)\n- Fixed warnings for unused profile overrides in a workspace.\n  [#7536](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7536)\n\n## Cargo 1.39 (2019-11-07)\n[e853aa97...1c6ec66d](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/e853aa97...1c6ec66d)\n\n### Added\n- Config files may now use the `.toml` filename extension.\n  [#7295](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7295)\n- The `--workspace` flag has been added as an alias for `--all` to help avoid\n  confusion about the meaning of \"all\".\n  [#7241](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7241)\n- The `publish` field has been added to `cargo metadata`.\n  [#7354](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7354)\n\n### Changed\n- Display more information if parsing the output from `rustc` fails.\n  [#7236](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7236)\n- TOML errors now show the column number.\n  [#7248](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7248)\n- `cargo vendor` no longer deletes files in the `vendor` directory that starts\n  with a `.`.\n  [#7242](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7242)\n- `cargo fetch` will now show manifest warnings.\n  [#7243](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7243)\n- `cargo publish` will now check git submodules if they contain any\n  uncommitted changes.\n  [#7245](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7245)\n- In a build script, `cargo:rustc-flags` now allows `-l` and `-L` flags\n  without spaces.\n  [#7257](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7257)\n- When `cargo install` replaces an older version of a package it will now\n  delete any installed binaries that are no longer present in the newly\n  installed version.\n  [#7246](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7246)\n- A git dependency may now also specify a `version` key when published. The\n  `git` value will be stripped from the uploaded crate, matching the behavior\n  of `path` dependencies.\n  [#7237](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7237)\n- The behavior of workspace default-members has changed. The default-members\n  now only applies when running Cargo in the root of the workspace. Previously\n  it would always apply regardless of which directory Cargo is running in.\n  [#7270](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7270)\n- libgit2 updated pulling in all upstream changes.\n  [#7275](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7275)\n- Bump `home` dependency for locating home directories.\n  [#7277](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7277)\n- zsh completions have been updated.\n  [#7296](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7296)\n- SSL connect errors are now retried.\n  [#7318](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7318)\n- The jobserver has been changed to acquire N tokens (instead of N-1), and\n  then immediately acquires the extra token. This was changed to accommodate\n  the `cc` crate on Windows to allow it to release its implicit token.\n  [#7344](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7344)\n- The scheduling algorithm for choosing which crate to build next has been\n  changed. It now chooses the crate with the greatest number of transitive\n  crates waiting on it. Previously it used a maximum topological depth.\n  [#7390](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7390)\n- RUSTFLAGS are no longer incorporated in the metadata and filename hash,\n  reversing the change from 1.33 that added it. This means that any change to\n  RUSTFLAGS will cause a recompile, and will not affect symbol munging.\n  [#7459](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7459)\n\n### Fixed\n- Git dependencies with submodules with shorthand SSH URLs (like\n  `git@github.com/user/repo.git`) should now work.\n  [#7238](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7238)\n- Handle broken symlinks when creating `.dSYM` symlinks on macOS.\n  [#7268](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7268)\n- Fixed issues with multiple versions of the same crate in a `[patch]` table.\n  [#7303](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7303)\n- Fixed issue with custom target `.json` files where a substring of the name\n  matches an unsupported crate type (like \"bin\").\n  [#7363](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/7363)\n- Fixed issues with generating documentation for proc-macro crate types.\n  [#7159](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7159)\n- Fixed hang if Cargo panics within a build thread.\n  [#7366](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7366)\n- Fixed rebuild detection if a `build.rs` script issues different `rerun-if`\n  directives between builds. Cargo was erroneously causing a rebuild after the\n  change.\n  [#7373](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7373)\n- Properly handle canonical URLs for `[patch]` table entries, preventing\n  the patch from working after the first time it is used.\n  [#7368](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7368)\n- Fixed an issue where integration tests were waiting for the package binary\n  to finish building before starting their own build. They now may build\n  concurrently.\n  [#7394](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7394)\n- Fixed accidental change in the previous release on how `--features a b` flag\n  is interpreted, restoring the original behavior where this is interpreted as\n  `--features a` along with the argument `b` passed to the command. To pass\n  multiple features, use quotes around the features to pass multiple features\n  like `--features \"a b\"`, or use commas, or use multiple `--features` flags.\n  [#7419](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7419)\n\n### Nightly only\n- Basic support for building the standard library directly from Cargo has been\n  added.\n  ([docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#build-std))\n  [#7216](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7216)\n- Added `-Ztimings` feature to generate an HTML report on the time spent on\n  individual compilation steps. This also may output completion steps on the\n  console and JSON data.\n  ([docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#timings))\n  [#7311](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7311)\n- Added ability to cross-compile doctests.\n  ([docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#doctest-xcompile))\n  [#6892](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6892)\n\n## Cargo 1.38 (2019-09-26)\n[4c1fa54d...23ef9a4e](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/4c1fa54d...23ef9a4e)\n\n### Added\n- üî• Cargo build pipelining has been enabled by default to leverage more idle CPU\n  parallelism during builds.\n  [#7143](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7143)\n- The `--message-format` option to Cargo can now be specified multiple times and\n  accepts a comma-separated list of values. In addition to the previous values\n  it also now accepts `json-diagnostic-short` and\n  `json-diagnostic-rendered-ansi` which configures the output coming from rustc\n  in `json` message mode.\n  [#7214](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7214)\n- Cirrus CI badges are now supported on crates.io.\n  [#7119](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7119)\n- A new format for `Cargo.lock` has been introduced. This new format is\n  intended to avoid source-control merge conflicts more often, and to\n  generally make it safer to merge changes. This new format is *not* enabled\n  at this time, though Cargo will use it if it sees it. At some point in the\n  future, it is intended that this will become the default.\n  [#7070](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7070)\n- Progress bar support added for FreeBSD.\n  [#7222](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7222)\n\n### Changed\n- The `-q` flag will no longer suppress the root error message for an error\n  from Cargo itself.\n  [#7116](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7116)\n- The Cargo Book is now published with mdbook 0.3 providing a number of\n  formatting fixes and improvements.\n  [#7140](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7140)\n- The `--features` command-line flag can now be specified multiple times.\n  The list of features from all the flags are joined together.\n  [#7084](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7084)\n- Package include/exclude glob-vs-gitignore warnings have been removed.\n  Packages may now use gitignore-style matching without producing any\n  warnings.\n  [#7170](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7170)\n- Cargo now shows the command and output when parsing `rustc` output fails\n  when querying `rustc` for information like `cfg` values.\n  [#7185](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7185)\n- `cargo package`/`cargo publish` now allows a symbolic link to a git\n  submodule to include that submodule.\n  [#6817](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6817)\n- Improved the error message when a version requirement does not\n  match any versions, but there are pre-release versions available.\n  [#7191](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7191)\n\n### Fixed\n- Fixed using the wrong directory when updating git repositories when using\n  the `git-fetch-with-cli` config option, and the `GIT_DIR` environment\n  variable is set. This may happen when running cargo from git callbacks.\n  [#7082](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7082)\n- Fixed dep-info files being overwritten for targets that have separate debug\n  outputs. For example, binaries on `-apple-` targets with `.dSYM` directories\n  would overwrite the `.d` file.\n  [#7057](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7057)\n- Fix `[patch]` table not preserving \"one major version per source\" rule.\n  [#7118](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7118)\n- Ignore `--remap-path-prefix` flags for the metadata hash in the `cargo\n  rustc` command. This was causing the remap settings to inadvertently affect\n  symbol names.\n  [#7134](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7134)\n- Fixed cycle detection in `[patch]` dependencies.\n  [#7174](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7174)\n- Fixed `cargo new` leaving behind a symlink on Windows when `core.symlinks`\n  git config is true. Also adds a number of fixes and updates from upstream\n  libgit2.\n  [#7176](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7176)\n- macOS: Fixed setting the flag to mark the `target` directory to be excluded\n  from backups.\n  [#7192](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7192)\n- Fixed `cargo fix` panicking under some situations involving multi-byte\n  characters.\n  [#7221](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7221)\n\n### Nightly only\n- Added `cargo fix --clippy` which will apply machine-applicable fixes from\n  Clippy.\n  [#7069](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7069)\n- Added `-Z binary-dep-depinfo` flag to add change tracking for binary\n  dependencies like the standard library.\n  [#7137](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7137)\n  [#7219](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7219)\n- `cargo clippy-preview` will always run, even if no changes have been made.\n  [#7157](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7157)\n- Fixed exponential blowup when using `CARGO_BUILD_PIPELINING`.\n  [#7062](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7062)\n- Fixed passing args to clippy in `cargo clippy-preview`.\n  [#7162](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7162)\n\n## Cargo 1.37 (2019-08-15)\n[c4fcfb72...9edd0891](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/c4fcfb72...9edd0891)\n\n### Added\n- Added `doctest` field to `cargo metadata` to determine if a target's\n  documentation is tested.\n  [#6953](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6953)\n  [#6965](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6965)\n- üî• The [`cargo\n  vendor`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/commands/cargo-vendor.html)\n  command is now built-in to Cargo. This command may be used to create a local\n  copy of the sources of all dependencies.\n  [#6869](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6869)\n- üî• The \"publish lockfile\" feature is now stable. This feature will\n  automatically include the `Cargo.lock` file when a package is published if\n  it contains a binary executable target. By default, Cargo will ignore\n  `Cargo.lock` when installing a package. To force Cargo to use the\n  `Cargo.lock` file included in the published package, use `cargo install\n  --locked`. This may be useful to ensure that `cargo install` consistently\n  reproduces the same result. It may also be useful when a semver-incompatible\n  change is accidentally published to a dependency, providing a way to fall\n  back to a version that is known to work.\n  [#7026](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7026)\n- üî• The `default-run` feature has been stabilized. This feature allows you to\n  specify which binary executable to run by default with `cargo run` when a\n  package includes multiple binaries. Set the `default-run` key in the\n  `[package]` table in `Cargo.toml` to the name of the binary to use by\n  default.\n  [#7056](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7056)\n\n### Changed\n- `cargo package` now verifies that build scripts do not create empty\n  directories.\n  [#6973](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6973)\n- A warning is now issued if `cargo doc` generates duplicate outputs, which\n  causes files to be randomly stomped on. This may happen for a variety of\n  reasons (renamed dependencies, multiple versions of the same package,\n  packages with renamed libraries, etc.). This is a known bug, which needs\n  more work to handle correctly.\n  [#6998](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6998)\n- Enabling a dependency's feature with `--features foo/bar` will no longer\n  compile the current crate with the `foo` feature if `foo` is not an optional\n  dependency.\n  [#7010](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7010)\n- If `--remap-path-prefix` is passed via RUSTFLAGS, it will no longer affect\n  the filename metadata hash.\n  [#6966](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6966)\n- libgit2 has been updated to 0.28.2, which Cargo uses to access git\n  repositories. This brings in hundreds of changes and fixes since it was last\n  updated in November.\n  [#7018](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7018)\n- Cargo now supports absolute paths in the dep-info files generated by rustc.\n  This is laying the groundwork for [tracking\n  binaries](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/61727), such as libstd, for\n  rebuild detection. (Note: this contains a known bug.)\n  [#7030](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7030)\n\n### Fixed\n- Fixed how zsh completions fetch the list of commands.\n  [#6956](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6956)\n- \"+ debuginfo\" is no longer printed in the build summary when `debug` is set\n  to 0.\n  [#6971](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6971)\n- Fixed `cargo doc` with an example configured with `doc = true` to document\n  correctly.\n  [#7023](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7023)\n- Don't fail if a read-only lock cannot be acquired in CARGO_HOME. This helps\n  when CARGO_HOME doesn't exist, but `--locked` is used which means CARGO_HOME\n  is not needed.\n  [#7149](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7149)\n- Reverted a change in 1.35 which released jobserver tokens when Cargo blocked\n  on a lock file. It caused a deadlock in some situations.\n  [#7204](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7204)\n\n### Nightly only\n- Added [compiler message\n  caching](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#cache-messages).\n  The `-Z cache-messages` flag makes cargo cache the compiler output so that\n  future runs can redisplay previous warnings.\n  [#6933](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6933)\n- `-Z mtime-on-use` no longer touches intermediate artifacts.\n  [#7050](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/7050)\n\n## Cargo 1.36 (2019-07-04)\n[6f3e9c36...c4fcfb72](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/6f3e9c36...c4fcfb72)\n\n### Added\n- Added more detailed documentation on target auto-discovery.\n  [#6898](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6898)\n- üî• Stabilize the `--offline` flag which allows using cargo without a network\n  connection.\n  [#6934](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6934)\n  [#6871](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6871)\n\n### Changed\n- `publish = [\"crates-io\"]` may be added to the manifest to restrict\n  publishing to crates.io only.\n  [#6838](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6838)\n- macOS: Only include the default paths if `DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH` is not\n  set. Also, remove `/lib` from the default set.\n  [#6856](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6856)\n- `cargo publish` will now exit early if the login token is not available.\n  [#6854](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6854)\n- HTTP/2 stream errors are now considered \"spurious\" and will cause a retry.\n  [#6861](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6861)\n- Setting a feature on a dependency where that feature points to a *required*\n  dependency is now an error. Previously it was a warning.\n  [#6860](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6860)\n- The `registry.index` config value now supports relative `file:` URLs.\n  [#6873](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6873)\n- macOS: The `.dSYM` directory is now symbolically linked next to example\n  binaries without the metadata hash so that debuggers can find it.\n  [#6891](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6891)\n- The default `Cargo.toml` template for now projects now includes a comment\n  providing a link to the documentation.\n  [#6881](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6881)\n- Some improvements to the wording of the crate download summary.\n  [#6916](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6916)\n  [#6920](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6920)\n- ‚ú® Changed `RUST_LOG` environment variable to `CARGO_LOG` so that user code\n  that uses the `log` crate will not display cargo's debug output.\n  [#6918](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6918)\n- `Cargo.toml` is now always included when packaging, even if it is not listed\n  in `package.include`.\n  [#6925](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6925)\n- Package include/exclude values now use gitignore patterns instead of glob\n  patterns. [#6924](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6924)\n- Provide a better error message when crates.io times out. Also improve error\n  messages with other HTTP response codes.\n  [#6936](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6936)\n\n### Performance\n- Resolver performance improvements for some cases.\n  [#6853](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6853)\n- Optimized how cargo reads the index JSON files by caching the results.\n  [#6880](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6880)\n  [#6912](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6912)\n  [#6940](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6940)\n- Various performance improvements.\n  [#6867](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6867)\n\n### Fixed\n- More carefully track the on-disk fingerprint information for dependencies.\n  This can help in some rare cases where the build is interrupted and\n  restarted. [#6832](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6832)\n- `cargo run` now correctly passes non-UTF8 arguments to the child process.\n  [#6849](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6849)\n- Fixed bash completion to run on bash 3.2, the stock version in macOS.\n  [#6905](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6905)\n- Various fixes and improvements to zsh completion.\n  [#6926](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6926)\n  [#6929](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6929)\n- Fix `cargo update` ignoring `-p` arguments if the `Cargo.lock` file was\n  missing.\n  [#6904](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6904)\n\n### Nightly only\n- Added [`-Z install-upgrade`\n  feature](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#install-upgrade)\n  to track details about installed crates and to update them if they are\n  out-of-date. [#6798](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6798)\n- Added the [`public-dependency`\n  feature](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/unstable.html#public-dependency)\n  which allows tracking public versus private dependencies.\n  [#6772](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6772)\n- Added build pipelining via the `build.pipelining` config\n  option (`CARGO_BUILD_PIPELINING` env var).\n  [#6883](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6883)\n- The `publish-lockfile` feature has had some significant changes. The default\n  is now `true`, the `Cargo.lock` will always be published for binary crates.\n  The `Cargo.lock` is now regenerated during publishing. `cargo install` now\n  ignores the `Cargo.lock` file by default, and requires `--locked` to use the\n  lock file. Warnings have been added if yanked dependencies are detected.\n  [#6840](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6840)\n\n## Cargo 1.35 (2019-05-23)\n[6789d8a0...6f3e9c36](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/6789d8a0...6f3e9c36)\n\n### Added\n- Added the `rustc-cdylib-link-arg` key for build scripts to specify linker\n  arguments for cdylib crates.\n  [#6298](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6298)\n\n### Changed\n- When passing a test filter, such as `cargo test foo`, don't build examples\n  (unless they set `test = true`).\n  [#6683](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6683)\n- Forward the `--quiet` flag from `cargo test` to the libtest harness so that\n  tests are actually quiet.\n  [#6358](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6358)\n- The verification step in `cargo package` that checks if any files are\n  modified is now stricter. It uses a hash of the contents instead of checking\n  filesystem mtimes. It also checks *all* files in the package.\n  [#6740](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6740)\n- Jobserver tokens are now released whenever Cargo blocks on a file lock.\n  [#6748](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6748)\n- Issue a warning for a previous bug in the TOML parser that allowed multiple\n  table headers with the same name.\n  [#6761](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6761)\n- Removed the `CARGO_PKG_*` environment variables from the metadata hash and\n  added them to the fingerprint instead. This means that when these values\n  change, stale artifacts are not left behind. Also added the \"repository\"\n  value to the fingerprint.\n  [#6785](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6785)\n- `cargo metadata` no longer shows a `null` field for a dependency without a\n  library in `resolve.nodes.deps`. The dependency is no longer shown.\n  [#6534](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6534)\n- `cargo new` will no longer include an email address in the `authors` field\n  if it is set to the empty string.\n  [#6802](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6802)\n- `cargo doc --open` now works when documenting multiple packages.\n  [#6803](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6803)\n- `cargo install --path P` now loads the `.cargo/config` file from the\n  directory P. [#6805](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6805)\n- Using semver metadata in a version requirement (such as `1.0.0+1234`) now\n  issues a warning that it is ignored.\n  [#6806](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6806)\n- `cargo install` now rejects certain combinations of flags where some flags\n  would have been ignored.\n  [#6801](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6801)\n- Resolver performance improvements for some cases.\n  [#6776](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6776)\n\n### Fixed\n- Fixed running separate commands (such as `cargo build` then `cargo test`)\n  where the second command could use stale results from a build script.\n  [#6720](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6720)\n- Fixed `cargo fix` not working properly if a `.gitignore` file that matched\n  the root package directory.\n  [#6767](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6767)\n- Fixed accidentally compiling a lib multiple times if `panic=unwind` was set\n  in a profile. [#6781](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6781)\n- Paths to JSON files in `build.target` config value are now canonicalized to\n  fix building dependencies.\n  [#6778](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6778)\n- Fixed re-running a build script if its compilation was interrupted (such as\n  if it is killed). [#6782](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6782)\n- Fixed `cargo new` initializing a fossil repo.\n  [#6792](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6792)\n- Fixed supporting updating a git repo that has a force push when using the\n  `git-fetch-with-cli` feature. `git-fetch-with-cli` also shows more error\n  information now when it fails.\n  [#6800](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6800)\n- `--example` binaries built for the WASM target are fixed to no longer\n  include a metadata hash in the filename, and are correctly emitted in the\n  `compiler-artifact` JSON message.\n  [#6812](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6812)\n\n### Nightly only\n- `cargo clippy-preview` is now a built-in cargo command.\n  [#6759](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6759)\n- The `build-override` profile setting now includes proc-macros and their\n  dependencies.\n  [#6811](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6811)\n- Optional and target dependencies now work better with `-Z offline`.\n  [#6814](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6814)\n\n## Cargo 1.34 (2019-04-11)\n[f099fe94...6789d8a0](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/f099fe94...6789d8a0)\n\n### Added\n- üî• Stabilized support for [alternate\n  registries](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.34.0/cargo/reference/registries.html).\n  [#6654](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6654)\n- Added documentation on using builds.sr.ht Continuous Integration with Cargo.\n  [#6565](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6565)\n- `Cargo.lock` now includes a comment at the top that it is `@generated`.\n  [#6548](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6548)\n- Azure DevOps badges are now supported.\n  [#6264](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6264)\n- Added a warning if `--exclude` flag specifies an unknown package.\n  [#6679](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6679)\n\n### Changed\n- `cargo test --doc --no-run` doesn't do anything, so it now displays an error\n  to that effect. [#6628](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6628)\n- Various updates to bash completion: add missing options and commands,\n  support libtest completions, use rustup for `--target` completion, fallback\n  to filename completion, fix editing the command line.\n  [#6644](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6644)\n- Publishing a crate with a `[patch]` section no longer generates an error.\n  The `[patch]` section is removed from the manifest before publishing.\n  [#6535](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6535)\n- `build.incremental = true` config value is now treated the same as\n  `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=1`, previously it was ignored.\n  [#6688](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6688)\n- Errors from a registry are now always displayed regardless of the HTTP\n  response code. [#6771](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6771)\n\n### Fixed\n- Fixed bash completion for `cargo run --example`.\n  [#6578](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6578)\n- Fixed a race condition when using a *local* registry and running multiple\n  cargo commands at the same time that build the same crate.\n  [#6591](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6591)\n- Fixed some flickering and excessive updates of the progress bar.\n  [#6615](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6615)\n- Fixed a hang when using a git credential helper that returns incorrect\n  credentials. [#6681](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6681)\n- Fixed resolving yanked crates with a local registry.\n  [#6750](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6750)\n\n### Nightly only\n- Added `-Z mtime-on-use` flag to cause the mtime to be updated on the\n  filesystem when a crate is used. This is intended to be able to track stale\n  artifacts in the future for cleaning up unused files.\n  [#6477](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6477)\n  [#6573](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6573)\n- Added experimental `-Z dual-proc-macros` to build proc macros for both the\n  host and the target.\n  [#6547](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6547)\n\n## Cargo 1.33 (2019-02-28)\n[8610973a...f099fe94](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/compare/8610973a...f099fe94)\n\n### Added\n- `compiler-artifact` JSON messages now include an `\"executable\"` key which\n  includes the path to the executable that was built.\n  [#6363](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6363)\n- The man pages have been rewritten, and are now published with the web\n  documentation. [#6405](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6405)\n- `cargo login` now displays a confirmation after saving the token.\n  [#6466](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6466)\n- A warning is now emitted if a `[patch]` entry does not match any package.\n  [#6470](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6470)\n- `cargo metadata` now includes the `links` key for a package.\n  [#6480](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6480)\n- \"Very verbose\" output with `-vv` now displays the environment variables that\n  cargo sets when it runs a process.\n  [#6492](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6492)\n- `--example`, `--bin`, `--bench`, or `--test` without an argument now lists\n  the available targets for those options.\n  [#6505](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6505)\n- Windows: If a process fails with an extended status exit code, a\n  human-readable name for the code is now displayed.\n  [#6532](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6532)\n- Added `--features`, `--no-default-features`, and `--all-features` flags to\n  the `cargo package` and `cargo publish` commands to use the given features\n  when verifying the package.\n  [#6453](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6453)\n\n### Changed\n- If `cargo fix` fails to compile the fixed code, the rustc errors are now\n  displayed on the console.\n  [#6419](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6419)\n- Hide the `--host` flag from `cargo login`, it is unused.\n  [#6466](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6466)\n- Build script fingerprints now include the rustc version.\n  [#6473](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6473)\n- macOS: Switched to setting `DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH` instead of\n  `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`. [#6355](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6355)\n- `RUSTFLAGS` is now included in the metadata hash, meaning that changing\n  the flags will not overwrite previously built files.\n  [#6503](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6503)\n- When updating the crate graph, unrelated yanked crates were erroneously\n  removed. They are now kept at their original version if possible. This was\n  causing unrelated packages to be downgraded during `cargo update -p\n  somecrate`. [#5702](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/5702)\n- TOML files now support the [0.5 TOML\n  syntax](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#050--2018-07-11).\n\n### Fixed\n- `cargo fix` will now ignore suggestions that modify multiple files.\n  [#6402](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6402)\n- `cargo fix` will now only fix one target at a time, to deal with targets\n  which share the same source files.\n  [#6434](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6434)\n- Fixed bash completion showing the list of cargo commands.\n  [#6461](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6461)\n- `cargo init` will now avoid creating duplicate entries in `.gitignore`\n  files. [#6521](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6521)\n- Builds now attempt to detect if a file is modified in the middle of a\n  compilation, allowing you to build again and pick up the new changes. This\n  is done by keeping track of when the compilation *starts* not when it\n  finishes. Also, [#5919](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/5919) was\n  reverted, meaning that cargo does *not* treat equal filesystem mtimes as\n  requiring a rebuild.

[#6321](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6321)\n- Added the alias `c` for `cargo check`.\n  [#6218](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6218)\n\n### Changed\n- üî• HTTP/2 multiplexing is now enabled by default. The `http.multiplexing`\n  config value may be used to disable it.\n  [#6271](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6271)\n- Use ANSI escape sequences to clear lines instead of spaces.\n  [#6233](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6233)\n- Disable git templates when checking out git dependencies, which can cause\n  problems. [#6252](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6252)\n- Include the `--update-head-ok` git flag when using the\n  `net.git-fetch-with-cli` option. This can help prevent failures when\n  fetching some repositories.\n  [#6250](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6250)\n- When extracting a crate during the verification step of `cargo package`, the\n  filesystem mtimes are no longer set, which was failing on some rare\n  filesystems. [#6257](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6257)\n- `crate-type = [\"proc-macro\"]` is now treated the same as `proc-macro = true`\n  in `Cargo.toml`. [#6256](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6256)\n- An error is raised if `dependencies`, `features`, `target`, or `badges` is\n  set in a virtual workspace. Warnings are displayed if `replace` or `patch`\n  is used in a workspace member.\n  [#6276](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6276)\n- Improved performance of the resolver in some cases.\n  [#6283](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6283)\n  [#6366](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6366)\n- `.rmeta` files are no longer hard-linked into the base target directory\n  (`target/debug`). [#6292](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6292)\n- A warning is issued if multiple targets are built with the same output\n  filenames. [#6308](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/6308)\n- When using `cargo build` (without `--release`) benchmarks are now built\n  using the \"test\" profile instead of \"bench\".

By contrast, the GNU General Public\n    License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\n    software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\n    General Public License applies to most of the Free Software\n    Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\n    using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\n    the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\n    your programs, too.\n\n      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n    price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n    this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\n    if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\n    in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\n    anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\n    These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\n    distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n      For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\n    gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\n    you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\n    source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\n    rights.\n\n      We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n    (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\n    distribute and/or modify the software.\n\n      Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\n    that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\n    software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\n    want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\n    that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\n    authors' reputations.\n\n      Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\n    patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\n    program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\n    program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\n    patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n    modification follow.\n\n            GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n       TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n      0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\n    a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\n    under the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\n    refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\n    means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\n    that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\n    either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\n    language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\n    the term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n    covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\n    running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\n    is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\n    Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).\n    Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n      1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\n    source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\n    conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\n    copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\n    notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\n    and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\n    along with the Program.\n\n    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\n    you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n      2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\n    of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\n    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\n    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n        a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n        b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n        whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n        part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n        parties under the terms of this License.\n\n        c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n        when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n        interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n        announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n        notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n        a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n        these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n        License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n        does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n        the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\n    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\n    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\n    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\n    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n    sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\n    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\n    on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\n    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\n    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\n    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\n    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\n    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\n    collective works based on the Program.\n\n    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\n    with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\n    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\n    the scope of this License.\n\n      3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\n    under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\n    Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n        a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n        source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n        1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n        b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n        years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n        cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n        machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n        distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n        customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n        c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n        to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n        allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n        received the program in object code or executable form with such\n        an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\n    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n    making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\n    code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\n    associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\n    control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\n    special exception, the source code distributed need not include\n    anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\n    form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\n    operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\n    itself accompanies the executable.\n\n    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\n    access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\n    access to copy the source code from the same place counts as\n    distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\n    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n      4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\n    except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\n    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\n    void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\n    However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\n    this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\n    parties remain in full compliance.\n\n      5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\n    distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\n    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\n    modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\n    Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\n    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\n    the Program or works based on it.\n\n      6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\n    Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n    original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\n    these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\n    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\n    this License.\n\n      7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\n    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\n    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\n    may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\n    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\n    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\n    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\n    refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\n    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\n    any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\n    apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\n    circumstances.\n\n    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\n    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\n    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\n    integrity of the free software distribution system, which is\n    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\n    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\n    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\n    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\n    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\n    impose that choice.\n\n    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\n    be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n      8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\n    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License\n    may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\n    those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\n    countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\n    the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n      9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\n    of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\n    be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\n    address new problems or concerns.\n\n    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\n    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\n    later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\n    either of that version or of any later version published by the Free\n    Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\n    this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\n    Foundation.\n\n      10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\n    programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\n    to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\n    Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\n    make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\n    of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\n    of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n              NO WARRANTY\n\n      11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\n    FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\n    OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\n    PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\n    OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\n    TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\n    PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\n    REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n      12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\n    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\n    REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\n    INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\n    OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\n    TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\n    YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\n    PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\n    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n             END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n          How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n      If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\n    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\n    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n      To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\n    to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\n    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\n    the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n        <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n        Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n        This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n        the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n        (at your option) any later version.\n\n        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n        but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Of course, the commands you use may\n    be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\n    mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\n    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\n    school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\n    necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n      Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n      `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n      <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n      Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\n    This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\n    proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\n    consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\n    library.

It also counts\n     as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n     the version number 2.1.]\n\n                                Preamble\n\n      The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\n    freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\n    Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\n    free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n      This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\n    specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\n    Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\n    can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\n    this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\n    strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n\n      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\n    not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\n    you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\n    for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\n    it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\n    it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\n    these things.\n\n      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\n    distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\n    rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\n    you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n      For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\n    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\n    you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\n    code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\n    complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\n    with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\n    it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n      We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\n    library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\n    permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n      To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\n    there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\n    modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\n    that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\n    author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\n    introduced by others.\n\n      Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\n    any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\n    effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\n    restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\n    any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\n    consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n      Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\n    ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\n    General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\n    is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\n    this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\n    libraries into non-free programs.\n\n      When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\n    a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\n    combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\n    General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\n    entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\n    Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\n    the library.\n\n      We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\n    does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\n    Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\n    of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\n    are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\n    libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\n    special circumstances.\n\n      For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\n    encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\n    a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\n    allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\n    library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\n    case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\n    software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n      In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\n    programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\n    free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\n    non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\n    operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\n    system.\n\n      Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\n    users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\n    linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\n    that program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n    modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n    \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\n    former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\n    be combined with the library in order to run.\n\n                      GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n       TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n      0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\n    program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\n    other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\n    this Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\n    Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n      A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\n    prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n    (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n      The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\n    which has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\n    Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\n    copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\n    portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\n    straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\n    included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n      \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n    making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\n    all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\n    interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\n    and installation of the library.\n\n      Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n    covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\n    running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\n    such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\n    on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\n    writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\n    and what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n      1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\n    complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\n    you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\n    appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\n    all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\n    warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\n    Library.\n\n      You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\n    and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\n    fee.\n\n      2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\n    of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\n    distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\n    above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n        a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n        b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n        stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n        c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n        charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n        d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n        table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n        the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n        is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n        in the event an application does not supply such function or\n        table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n        its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n        (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n        a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n        application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n        application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n        be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n        root function must still compute square roots.)\n\n    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\n    identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\n    and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\n    themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n    sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\n    distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\n    on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\n    this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\n    entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\n    it.\n\n    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\n    your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\n    exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\n    collective works based on the Library.\n\n    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\n    with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\n    a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\n    the scope of this License.\n\n      3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\n    License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\n    this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\n    that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\n    instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\n    ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\n    that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\n    these notices.\n\n      Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\n    that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\n    subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n      This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\n    the Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n      4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\n    derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\n    under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\n    it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\n    must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\n    medium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n      If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\n    source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\n    distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\n    compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n      5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\n    Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\n    linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\n    work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\n    therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n      However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\n    creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\n    contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\n    library\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\n    Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n      When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\n    that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\n    derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\n    Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\n    linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\n    threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n      If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\n    structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\n    functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\n    file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\n    work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\n    Library will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n      Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\n    distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\n    Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\n    whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\n      6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\n    link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\n    work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\n    under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\n    modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\n    engineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n      You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\n    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\n    this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\n    during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\n    copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\n    directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\n    of these things:\n\n        a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n        machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n        changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n        Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n        with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n        uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n        user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n        executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n        that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n        Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n        to use the modified definitions.)\n\n        b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n        Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n        copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n        rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n        will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n        the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n        interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n        c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\n        least three years, to give the same user the materials\n        specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n        than the cost of performing this distribution.\n\n        d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n        from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n        specified materials from the same place.\n\n        e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n        materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n      For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\n    Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\n    reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\n    the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\n    normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\n    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\n    which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\n    the executable.\n\n      It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\n    restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\n    accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\n    use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\n    distribute.\n\n      7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\n    Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library\n    facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\n    library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\n    the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\n    permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n        a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n        based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n        facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n        Sections above.\n\n        b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n        that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n        where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n      8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\n    the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\n    attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\n    distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\n    rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\n    or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\n    terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n      9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n    signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\n    distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\n    prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\n    modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\n    Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\n    all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\n    the Library or works based on it.\n\n      10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\n    Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n    original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\n    subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\n    restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n    You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\n    this License.\n\n      11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\n    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\n    distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\n    may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\n    license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\n    all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\n    the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\n    refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\n    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\n    particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\n    and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\n    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\n    patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\n    such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\n    integrity of the free software distribution system which is\n    implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\n    generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\n    through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\n    system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\n    to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\n    impose that choice.\n\n    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\n    be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n      12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\n    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n    original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\n    an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\n    so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\n    excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\n    written in the body of this License.\n\n      13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\n    versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\n    Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\n    but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n    Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\n    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n    \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\n    conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\n    the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\n    license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\n    the Free Software Foundation.\n\n      14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\n    programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\n    write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\n    copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\n    Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\n    decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\n    of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\n    and reuse of software generally.\n\n                                NO WARRANTY\n\n      15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\n    WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\n    EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\n    OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\n    KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\n    IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n    PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\n    LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\n    THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n      16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\n    WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\n    AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\n    FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\n    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\n    LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\n    RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\n    FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\n    SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\n    DAMAGES.\n\n                         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n               How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n      If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\n    possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\n    everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\n    redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\n    ordinary General Public License).\n\n      To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\n    safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\n    convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n    \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n        <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n        Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n        This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n        modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n        License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n        version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n        This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n        but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\n        Lesser General Public License for more details.\n\n        You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\n        License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\n        Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\n    Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n    You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\n    school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library, if\n    necessary.

This crate may make major changes to\n> its APIs.\n\n## Code Status\n\n[![CI](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=auto-cargo)](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/actions/workflows/main.yml)\n\nCode documentation: <https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/cargo/>\n\n## Compiling from Source\n\n### Requirements\n\nCargo requires the following tools and packages to build:\n\n* `cargo` and `rustc`\n* A C compiler [for your platform](https://github.com/rust-lang/cc-rs#compile-time-requirements)\n* `git` (to clone this repository)\n\n**Other requirements:**\n\nThe following are optional based on your platform and needs.\n\n* `pkg-config` ‚Äî This is used to help locate system packages, such as `libssl` headers/libraries. This may not be required in all cases, such as using vendored OpenSSL, or on Windows.\n* OpenSSL ‚Äî Only needed on Unix-like systems and only if the `vendored-openssl` Cargo feature is not used.\n\n  This requires the development headers, which can be obtained from the `libssl-dev` package on Ubuntu or `openssl-devel` with apk or yum or the `openssl` package from Homebrew on macOS.\n\n  If using the `vendored-openssl` Cargo feature, then a static copy of OpenSSL will be built from source instead of using the system OpenSSL.\n  This may require additional tools such as `perl` and `make`.\n\n  On macOS, common installation directories from Homebrew, MacPorts, or pkgsrc will be checked. Otherwise it will fall back to `pkg-config`.\n\n  On Windows, the system-provided Schannel will be used instead.\n\n  LibreSSL is also supported.\n\n**Optional system libraries:**\n\nThe build will automatically use vendored versions of the following libraries.

See [the Wiki page][third-party-subcommands] for more details and\na list of known community-developed subcommands.\n\n[third-party-subcommands]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/wiki/Third-party-cargo-subcommands\n\n\n## Releases\n\nCargo releases coincide with Rust releases.\nHigh level release notes are available as part of [Rust's release notes][rel].\nDetailed release notes are available in this repo at [CHANGELOG.md].\n\n[rel]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.md\n[CHANGELOG.md]: CHANGELOG.md\n\n## Reporting issues\n\nFound a bug?
