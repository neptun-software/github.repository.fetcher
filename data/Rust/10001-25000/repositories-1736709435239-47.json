          "content": "# Bytecode Alliance Organizational Code of Conduct (OCoC)\n\n*Note*: this Code of Conduct pertains to organizations' behavior. Please also see the [Individual Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n## Preamble\n\nThe Bytecode Alliance (BA) welcomes involvement from organizations,\nincluding commercial organizations.  This document is an\n*organizational* code of conduct, intended particularly to provide\nguidance to commercial organizations.  It is distinct from the\n[Individual Code of Conduct (ICoC)](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and does not \nreplace the ICoC. This OCoC applies to any group of people acting in \nconcert as a BA member or as a participant in BA activities, whether \nor not that group is formally incorporated in some jurisdiction.\n\nThe code of conduct described below is not a set of rigid rules, and\nwe did not write it to encompass every conceivable scenario that might\narise.  For example, it is theoretically possible there would be times\nwhen asserting patents is in the best interest of the BA community as\na whole.  In such instances, consult with the BA, strive for\nconsensus, and interpret these rules with an intent that is generous\nto the community the BA serves.\n\nWhile we may revise these guidelines from time to time based on\nreal-world experience, overall they are based on a simple principle:\n\n*Bytecode Alliance members should observe the distinction between\n public community functions and private functions — especially\n commercial ones — and should ensure that the latter support, or at\n least do not harm, the former.*\n\n## Guidelines\n\n * **Do not cause confusion about Wasm standards or interoperability.** \n \n   Having an interoperable WebAssembly core is a high priority for\n   the BA, and members should strive to preserve that core.  It is fine\n   to develop additional non-standard features or APIs, but they\n   should always be clearly distinguished from the core interoperable\n   Wasm.\n \n   Treat the WebAssembly name and any BA-associated names with\n   respect, and follow BA trademark and branding guidelines.  If you\n   distribute a customized version of software originally produced by\n   the BA, or if you build a product or service using BA-derived\n   software, use names that clearly distinguish your work from the\n   original.  (You should still provide proper attribution to the\n   original, of course, wherever such attribution would normally be\n   given.)\n     \n   Further, do not use the WebAssembly name or BA-associated names in\n   other public namespaces in ways that could cause confusion, e.g.,\n   in company names, names of commercial service offerings, domain\n   names, publicly-visible social media accounts or online service\n   accounts, etc.  It may sometimes be reasonable, however, to\n   register such a name in a new namespace and then immediately donate\n   control of that account to the BA, because that would help the project\n   maintain its identity.\n\n   For further guidance, see the BA Trademark and Branding Policy\n   [TODO: create policy, then insert link].\n     \n * **Do not restrict contributors.** If your company requires\n   employees or contractors to sign non-compete agreements, those\n   agreements must not prevent people from participating in the BA or\n   contributing to related projects.\n\n   This does not mean that all non-compete agreements are incompatible\n   with this code of conduct.  For example, a company may restrict an\n   employee's ability to solicit the company's customers.  However, an\n   agreement must not block any form of technical or social\n   participation in BA activities, including but not limited to the\n   implementation of particular features.\n\n   The accumulation of experience and expertise in individual persons,\n   who are ultimately free to direct their energy and attention as\n   they decide, is one of the most important drivers of progress in\n   open source projects.  A company that limits this freedom may hinder\n   the success of the BA's efforts.\n\n * **Do not use patents as offensive weapons.** If any BA participant\n   prevents the adoption or development of BA technologies by\n   asserting its patents, that undermines the purpose of the\n   coalition.  The collaboration fostered by the BA cannot include\n   members who act to undermine its work.\n \n * **Practice responsible disclosure** for security vulnerabilities.\n   Use designated, non-public reporting channels to disclose technical\n   vulnerabilities, and give the project a reasonable period to\n   respond, remediate, and patch.  [TODO: optionally include the\n   security vulnerability reporting URL here.]\n\n   Vulnerability reporters may patch their company's own offerings, as\n   long as that patching does not significantly delay the reporting of\n   the vulnerability.  Vulnerability information should never be used\n   for unilateral commercial advantage.  Vendors may legitimately\n   compete on the speed and reliability with which they deploy\n   security fixes, but withholding vulnerability information damages\n   everyone in the long run by risking harm to the BA project's\n   reputation and to the security of all users.\n\n * **Respect the letter and spirit of open source practice.** While\n     there is not space to list here all possible aspects of standard\n     open source practice, some examples will help show what we mean:\n\n   * Abide by all applicable open source license terms.  Do not engage\n     in copyright violation or misattribution of any kind.\n\n   * Do not claim others' ideas or designs as your own.\n\n   * When others engage in publicly visible work (e.g., an upcoming\n     demo that is coordinated in a public issue tracker), do not\n     unilaterally announce early releases or early demonstrations of\n     that work ahead of their schedule in order to secure private\n     advantage (such as marketplace advantage) for yourself.\n\n   The BA reserves the right to determine what constitutes good open\n   source practices and to take action as it deems appropriate to\n   encourage, and if necessary enforce, such practices.\n\n## Enforcement\n\nInstances of organizational behavior in violation of the OCoC may \nbe reported by contacting the Bytecode Alliance CoC team at \n[report@bytecodealliance.org](mailto:report@bytecodealliance.org). The \nCoC team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond \nin a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The CoC team \nis obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of \nan incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be \nposted separately.\n\nWhen the BA deems an organization in violation of this OCoC, the BA\nwill, at its sole discretion, determine what action to take.  The BA\nwill decide what type, degree, and duration of corrective action is\nneeded, if any, before a violating organization can be considered for\nmembership (if it was not already a member) or can have its membership\nreinstated (if it was a member and the BA canceled its membership due\nto the violation).\n\nIn practice, the BA's first approach will be to start a conversation,\nwith punitive enforcement used only as a last resort.  Violations\noften turn out to be unintentional and swiftly correctable with all\nparties acting in good faith.\n"

Otherwise, the `rustup target add...`\ncommand may not install the target for the correct copy of Rust.)\n\n## Features\n\n* **Fast**. Wasmtime is built on the optimizing [Cranelift] code generator to\n  quickly generate high-quality machine code either at runtime or\n  ahead-of-time. Wasmtime is optimized for efficient instantiation, low-overhead\n  calls between the embedder and wasm, and scalability of concurrent instances.\n\n* **[Secure]**. Wasmtime's development is strongly focused on correctness and\n  security. Building on top of Rust's runtime safety guarantees, each Wasmtime\n  feature goes through careful review and consideration via an [RFC\n  process]. Once features are designed and implemented, they undergo 24/7\n  fuzzing donated by [Google's OSS Fuzz]. As features stabilize they become part\n  of a [release][release policy], and when things go wrong we have a\n  well-defined [security policy] in place to quickly mitigate and patch any\n  issues. We follow best practices for defense-in-depth and integrate\n  protections and mitigations for issues like Spectre. Finally, we're working to\n  push the state-of-the-art by collaborating with academic researchers to\n  formally verify critical parts of Wasmtime and Cranelift.\n\n* **[Configurable]**. Wasmtime uses sensible defaults, but can also be\n  configured to provide more fine-grained control over things like CPU and\n  memory consumption. Whether you want to run Wasmtime in a tiny environment or\n  on massive servers with many concurrent instances, we've got you covered.\n\n* **[WASI]**. Wasmtime supports a rich set of APIs for interacting with the host\n  environment through the [WASI standard](https://wasi.dev).\n\n* **[Standards Compliant]**. Wasmtime passes the [official WebAssembly test\n  suite](https://github.com/WebAssembly/testsuite), implements the [official C\n  API of wasm](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasm-c-api), and implements\n  [future proposals to WebAssembly](https://github.com/WebAssembly/proposals) as\n  well. Wasmtime developers are intimately engaged with the WebAssembly\n  standards process all along the way too.\n\n[Wasmtime]: https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime\n[Cranelift]: https://cranelift.dev/\n[Google's OSS Fuzz]: https://google.github.io/oss-fuzz/\n[security policy]: https://bytecodealliance.org/security\n[RFC process]: https://github.com/bytecodealliance/rfcs\n[release policy]: https://docs.wasmtime.dev/stability-release.html\n[Secure]: https://docs.wasmtime.dev/security.html\n[Configurable]: https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.Config.html\n[WASI]: https://docs.rs/wasmtime-wasi/latest/wasmtime_wasi/\n[Standards Compliant]: https://docs.wasmtime.dev/stability-tiers.html\n\n## Language Support\n\nYou can use Wasmtime from a variety of different languages through embeddings of\nthe implementation.\n\nLanguages supported by the Bytecode Alliance:\n\n* **[Rust]** - the [`wasmtime` crate]\n* **[C]** - the [`wasm.h`, `wasi.h`, and `wasmtime.h` headers][c-headers], [CMake](crates/c-api/CMakeLists.txt) or [`wasmtime` Conan package]\n* **C++** - the [`wasmtime-cpp` repository][wasmtime-cpp] or use [`wasmtime-cpp` Conan package]\n* **[Python]** - the [`wasmtime` PyPI package]\n* **[.NET]** - the [`Wasmtime` NuGet package]\n* **[Go]** - the [`wasmtime-go` repository]\n* **[Ruby]** - the [`wasmtime` gem]\n\nLanguages supported by the community:\n\n* **[Elixir]** - the [`wasmex` hex package]\n* **Perl** - the [`Wasm` Perl package's `Wasm::Wasmtime`]\n\n[Rust]: https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime/lang-rust.html\n[C]: https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime/lang-c.html\n[`wasmtime` crate]: https://crates.io/crates/wasmtime\n[c-headers]: https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime/c-api/\n[Python]: https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime/lang-python.html\n[`wasmtime` PyPI package]: https://pypi.org/project/wasmtime/\n[.NET]: https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime/lang-dotnet.html\n[`Wasmtime` NuGet package]: https://www.nuget.org/packages/Wasmtime\n[Go]: https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime/lang-go.html\n[`wasmtime-go` repository]: https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-go\n[wasmtime-cpp]: https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-cpp\n[`wasmtime` Conan package]: https://conan.io/center/wasmtime\n[`wasmtime-cpp` Conan package]: https://conan.io/center/wasmtime-cpp\n[Ruby]: https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wasmtime/lang-ruby.html\n[`wasmtime` gem]: https://rubygems.org/gems/wasmtime\n[Elixir]: https://docs.wasmtime.dev/lang-elixir.html\n[`wasmex` hex package]: https://hex.pm/packages/wasmex\n[`Wasm` Perl package's `Wasm::Wasmtime`]: https://metacpan.org/pod/Wasm::Wasmtime\n\n## Documentation\n\n[📚 Read the Wasmtime guide here! 📚][guide]\n\nThe [wasmtime guide][guide] is the best starting point to learn about what\nWasmtime can do for you or help answer your questions about Wasmtime.
