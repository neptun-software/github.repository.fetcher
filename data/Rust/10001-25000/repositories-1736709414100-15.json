This has had no\neffect since 0.46.\n\n### Parsing\n\nFile detection now supports Windows-1252 encoded test (an extension of\nISO-8859-1), and is stricter about UTF-16 detection.\n\nUpdated to the latest tree-sitter parser for Make and YAML.\n\n## 0.62 (released 20th December 2024)\n\n### Diffing\n\nImproved handling of multiline strings, which could cause a crash if\nthey occurred at the end of the file. This was particularly noticeable\nwith YAML.\n\n### Parsing\n\nImproved language detection when one argument is a named pipe.\n\nUpdated to the latest tree-sitter parser for Bash, C, C++, C#, CSS,\nGo, Haskell, HTML, Java, JavaScript, JSON, Julia, Lua, Objective-C,\nOCaml, PHP, Python, Ruby, Scala, TOML, TypeScript and XML.\n\n### Syntax Highlighting\n\nImproved syntax highlighting, particularly for keywords.\n\n### Build\n\ndifftastic now requires Rust 1.74.1 to build.\n\nPrebuilt packages for macOS on x86-64 are now built on macOS 13.\n\n## 0.61 (released 24th October 2024)\n\n**Recommended git configuration has changed! Please update your\n`~/.gitconfig` to [match the git\ninstructions](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/git.html), regardless\nof your difftastic version.**\n\n### Display\n\nSide-by-side display is now smarter on very wide terminals when the\ncontent is narrow.\n\n### Diffing\n\nFixed a crash (introduced in 0.60) when the final line in a file does\nnot have a trailing newline and occurs more than once in the file.\n\n### Build\n\ndifftastic now requires Rust 1.66 to build.\n\n## 0.60 (released 1st August 2024)\n\n### Diffing\n\nFixed a crash (introduced in 0.59) when the final changed hunk\nincluded the last line of the file.\n\n### Display\n\nFixed an issue where files with no common content would show duplicate\nhunks.\n\nFixed a performance issue when files had extremely long lines\n(e.g. 100,000+ characters).\n\n## 0.59 (released 20th July 2024)\n\n### Diffing\n\nFixed crash on some textual files where a single change contained more than\n1,000 words.\n\n### Parsing\n\nAdded support for device tree and F#.\n\nDifftastic now uses tree-sitter comment highlighing as a hint that\nnodes should be treated as atoms. This ensures comments are treated\nmore consistently across languages. This fixes cases in Elm where\ncomment differences were ignored, and may improve other languages too.\n\n## 0.58 (released 11th May 2024)\n\n### Parsing\n\nDifftastic now preserves tree-sitter parse tree structure on parse\nerror nodes. This reverts the flattening behaviour introduced in\n0.38. Preserving structure tends to produce better diffs, although it\nincreases the risk that difftastic will show fewer changes in the\npresence of parse errors.\n\nSince difftastic is now conservative with parse errors\n(DFT_PARSE_ERROR_LIMIT is 0 by default), this seems like a better\ntradeoff.\n\nUpdated C, C++, CMake, CSS, Elm, Go, Lua and Python parsers.\n\n### Diffing\n\n`--strip-cr` now defaults to `on`, so comparing a file with CRLF\nendings with a file with unix line endings will not show spurious\nchanges.\n\n### Documentation\n\nDifftastic now has a man page, see the `difft.1` file.\n\n### Performance\n\nFixed a memory leak and improved performance in some cases.\n\n### Command Line Interface\n\nFixed a crash when difftastic could not detect the terminal width,\nsuch as inside eshell.\n\nDifftastic now also considers $COLUMNS when detecting the terminal\nwidth.\n\n## 0.57 (released 1st April 2024)\n\n### Parsing\n\nText file detection is now stricter, considering null bytes as a hint\nthat files are binaries.\n\n### Diffing\n\nFixed an issue where hidden files (filename starting with `.`) were\nignored when diffing directories.\n\nScheme now uses the same slider heuristics as other lisps, preferring\nthe outer delimiter.\n\nFixed an issue with line-based diffing where only the first line in a\nlarge changed region was highlighted. This was particularly noticeable\nwhen diffing brand new files.\n\n### Display\n\nFixed an issue when reporting changes in binary files, where trailing\nwhitespace was inconsistent with other changes shown.\n\n## 0.56.1 (released 5th March 2024)\n\n### Build\n\nFixed an issue with building difftastic on aarch64 with rust 1.71 or\nearlier.\n\n## 0.56 (released 5th March 2024)\n\n### Parsing\n\nUpdated JavaScript, TypeScript, QML and Perl parsers.\n\n`Makefile*.in` is now detected as Makefile syntax.\n\nImproved shebang parsing with whitespace, e.g. `#! /bin/bash` is now\ndetected as a shell script.\n\nAdded support for Scheme and Smali.\n\n### Diffing\n\nFixed an issue with runaway memory usage on text files with very long\nlines.\n\n### Display\n\nFixed an issue where all files would show a permissions change when\nusing difftastic with `git difftool`.\n\nFixed an issue with paths not showing the containing directory when\nusing difftastic with `git difftool`.\n\nDifftastic now correctly reports file permission changes when called\nfrom `git diff`.\n\nFixed an issue with the experimental JSON display mode where it\nignored `--skip-unchanged`.\n\nFixed an issue with tabs not being replaced in single-column display.\n\n## 0.55 (released 1st February 2024)\n\n### Parsing\n\nAdded support for Objective-C and VHDL.\n\nFiles starting with `<?xml` are now parsed as XML.\n\nFixed a `munmap_chunk(): invalid pointer` crash on parsing some\nlarge files, particularly JSON.\n\n### Display\n\nThe default display width for tabs has changed to 4.\n\nFixed an issue where difftastic would sometimes output literal tabs\nrather than respecting the display width for tabs.\n\n### Build\n\ndifftastic now requires Rust 1.65 to build.\n\n## 0.54 (released 7th January 2024)\n\n### Parsing\n\nAdded support for Salesforce Apex.\n\nImproved parsing of regex literals in Clojure and strictness\nannotations in Haskell.\n\n### Diffing\n\nDifftastic will now also report file permission changes.\n\nFixed an issue where directory diffing would show a file more than\nonce.\n\n### Display\n\nFixed a rare crash when the last non-blank line had changes for\ncertain parsers, particularly YAML.\n\n### Command Line Interface\n\nDifftastic now errors if given a single path, unless that file\ncontains conflict markers. Previously this was a warning.\n\n### Build\n\nDifftastic now requires Rust 1.63 to build.\n\n## 0.53.1 (released 26th November 2023)\n\n### Build\n\nFixed a dependency issue that broke aarch64 builds on older rustc versions.\n\n## 0.53 (released 24th November 2023)\n\n### Parsing\n\nAdded support for SCSS.\n\nUpdated the Kotlin parser and improved handling of Kotlin nullable\ntypes.\n\n`.snap` files (Jest snapshots) are now detected as JavaScript files.\n\n### Diffing\n\nFixed an issue where adding or removing blank lines would be ignored\nby the textual diffing logic.\n\nDirectory diffing now respects `.gitignore` files.\n\nDirectory diffing can now be sorted by path with the `--sort-paths`\noption.\n\n### Command Line Interface\n\nAdded the option `--strip-cr`. This removes all carriage return\ncharacters before diffing, which is helpful when dealing with a mix of\nWindows and non-Windows flies.\n\nThe option `--skip-unchanged` now has a corresponding environment\noption `DFT_SKIP_UNCHANGED`.\n\n### Build\n\nDifftastic now requires Rust 1.60 to build.\n\n## 0.52 (released 8th October 2023)\n\n### Parsing\n\nAdded support for XML and JSONL.\n\n### Diffing\n\nText nodes now get word diffing, consistent with string literals and\ncomments. This is used in languages like HTML and XML that have\nseparate text nodes.\n\n### Display\n\nImproved syntax highlighting of constructors (i.e. type names when\nvalues are constructed, such as `Foo {}`).\n\nImproved syntax highlighting for C#.\n\n### Build\n\nThis release does not provide a prebuilt musl binary, due\nto [a dynamic linking\nissue](https://github.com/Wilfred/difftastic/issues/563) with binaries\nin the release script.\n\nmusl remains tested in CI and supported for users, but you will need\nto compile difftastic from source.\n\n## 0.51.1 (released 25th August 2023)\n\nFixed an issue with GitHub actions that prevented prebuilt binaries\nbeing attached to the release.\n\nThis is the same code as 0.51.0 otherwise.\n\n## 0.51.0 (released 25th August 2023)\n\n### Parsing\n\nUpdated Bash, Python and Rust parsers.\n\n### Display\n\nAdded a JSON display option. This is currently unstable, and requires\nyou to set DFT_UNSTABLE. The JSON structure may change in future.\n\nPlease give it a try and give feedback on GitHub issues.\n\n### Build\n\nAdded support for Linux with musl, Linux on aarch64, and macOS on\naarch64.\n\nNote that Difftastic already worked on these platforms, but they are\nnow tested in CI and will be included in prebuilt binaries in\nreleases.\n\n## 0.50 (released 15th August 2023)\n\n### Conflicts\n\nDifftastic now supports parsing files with conflict markers, enabling\nyou to diff the two conflicting file states.\n\n```\n$ difft file_with_conflicts.js\n```\n\n### Parsing\n\nUpdated Elixir, Erlang, Go, Kotlin and Racket parsers.\n\n### Display\n\nTweaked the colours on the file header, to make metadata less\nprominent.\n\nImproved styling of file rename information.\n\nImproved syntax hightling for Java built-in types.\n\n### Diffing\n\nFixed an issue with runaway memory usage when the two files input\nfiles had a large number of differences.\n\n### Build\n\nDifftastic now requires Rust 1.59 to build.\n\n## 0.49 (released 26th July 2023)\n\n### Parsing\n\nAdded support for LaTeX.\n\nUpdated grammars for C, C++ and Java.\n\nImproved parsing of qualified constructors in Haskell.\n\nDifftastic is now stricter about valid UTF-8 and UTF-16, considering\nmore of the file's bytes during filetype detection. This fixes cases\nwhere e.g. PDF was sometimes incorrectly considered as UTF-8.\n\n### Diffing\n\nImproved handling of delimiters (\"nested sliders\") in languages that\nprefer the outer delimiter, such as JSON and Lisps.\n\n### Build\n\nDifftastic now requires Rust 1.58 to build.\n\n## 0.48 (released 12th July 2023)\n\n### Parsing\n\nUpdated Scala parser.\n\nImproved parsing of qualified modules and variables in Haskell.\n\n### Diffing\n\nReplaced strings now have subword highlighting, consistent with\nreplaced comments. Thanks @amnore!\n\nFixed an issue with the cost model for comment replacement, leading\ndifftastic to prefer modified comments even when exact comment matches\nare possible.\n\nSimplified the cost model, which previously had an inconsistent\nheuristic depending on whether there were multiple items on the same\nline. This can lead to slightly different items being marked as\nchanged, but on average the results are better.\n\n### Display\n\nImproved word highlighting in comments when they contain numbers or\nhyphens.\n\n### Internals\n\nDifftastic's logging is now configured with the environment variable\n`DFT_LOG`. This was previously `RUST_LOG`, which could interfere with\nusers configuring logging for their own development work.\n\n## 0.47 (released 16th May 2023)\n\n### Language Detection\n\nFixed an issue where file extensions of the form `*.foo.bar`\n(e.g. `*.cmake.in`) were ignored.\n\nAdded an option `--override` which overrides language detection based\non a glob, e.g. `--override='*.js:javascript jsx'`. See `--help` for\nfull documentation and more examples.\n\nRemoved the `--language` option. This option was confusing (it took a\nfile extension rather than a language name) and not very useful\n(it overrode language detection for all files together).\n\n### Parsing\n\nAdded support for Solidity.\n\n### Display\n\nWhen difftastic is invoked with two file paths, it will now truncate\nthe path shown to the shared common parts. This is particularly\nhelpful when using difftastic with mercurial.\n\n```\n$ difft dir1/foo/bar.py dir2/foo/bar.py\nfoo/bar.py -- Python\n...\n```\n\n## 0.46 (released 31st March 2023)\n\n### Command Line Interface\n\nRemoved the option `--missing-as-empty`. This is no longer needed as\ndifftastic handles `/dev/null` gracefully on all platforms.\n\n### Parsing\n\nAdded support for Ada.\n\n`.ino` files are now treated as C++.\n\nImproved parsing for TOML.\n\nUpdated grammars for Bash, C, C++, C#, Clojure, CMake, Elixir, Go,\nJava, JavaScript, OCaml, Perl, QML and TypeScript.\n\nDifftastic now prefers treating files as 'mostly UTF-8' or binary rather than\nUTF-16. Many files can be decoded as UTF-16 without decoding errors\nbut produce nonsense results, so this heuristic seems to work better.\n\nFixed an issue where difftastic would discard the last newline in a\nfile before diffing. This was most noticeable when doing textual diffs\nand the last line had changed.\n\n### Display\n\nDifftastic no longer uses purple to highlight regions that are missing\nstyling. This was intended as a debug feature, but it in practice it\nonly highlighted trailing whitespace for a few languages.\n\n## 0.45 (released 3rd March 2023)\n\n### Diffing\n\nRacket and Newick are now treated as lisps for the purposes for\nparenthesis heuristics.\n\n### Parsing\n\nFixed an issue where parse errors were undercounted, particularly in\nYAML files.\n\nImproved parsing for Makefiles.\n\n## 0.44 (released 2nd March 2023)\n\n### Parsing\n\nAdded support for Newick and Racket.\n\n### Diffing\n\nDifftastic now uses a textual diff on files that have any parse\nerrors. The parse error limit defaults to 0, but it is configurable\nwith `DFT_PARSE_ERROR_LIMIT` or `--parse-error-limit`.\n\nTextual diffing now respects `--check-only`, consistent with syntactic\ndiffing.\n\n### Display\n\nImproved syntax highlighting for keywords.\n\nIf a file exceeds `DFT_BYTE_LIMIT`, difftastic now displays its size in\nthe header.\n\n## 0.43.1 (released 3rd February 2023)\n\nThis release has no logic changes from 0.43.\n\nThe only difference is that the `test_gzip_is_binary` test is ignored by default, as it depends on MIME database availability. This database isn't always installed in packaging environments, so packagers saw this test failing.\n\n## 0.43 (released 3rd February 2023)\n\n### Parsing\n\nAdded support for R.\n\nDifftastic now considers gzipped files to be binary, even if they\nhappen to be valid UTF-16.\n\n### Diffing\n\nFixed a rare crash when one file had repeated lists that partially\nmatched the other side.\n\n### Display\n\nFixed an issue with single-column display when colour is disabled,\nwhere newlines were missing from the output.\n\n### Command Line Interface\n\n`--help` now shows the default value for all arguments (it was\npreviously missing `--color` and `--display`).\n\n`--color` can now be configured with the environment variable\n`DFT_COLOR`.\n\nFixed an issue where git on Windows would fail with an error about\n`/dev/null`.\n\n## 0.42 (released 15th January 2023)\n\n### Parsing\n\nImproved CSS parsing and HTML sublanguage parsing.\n\n### Diffing\n\nAdded an `--ignore-comments` option.\n\nImproved textual diffing performance, particularly when the two files\nhave few lines in common.\n\n### Display\n\nFixed an issue with unwanted underlines with textual diffing when\nDFT_BYTE_LIMIT is reached.\n\nFixed a crash in inline display when the file ends with whitespace.\n\n### Build\n\nRenamed the vendored parser directory to vendored_parsers/, as `cargo\nvendor` would clobber the `vendor/` directory.\n\n## 0.41 (released 8th January 2023)\n\n### Parsing\n\nDifftastic now supports embedded languages in HTML and Makefiles. This\nenables difftastic to parse embedded CSS or JavaScript in HTML, or\nBash in Makefiles, leading to better diffs in those files.\n\nTab replacement is now done after parsing. If tab characters are\nsyntactically important, they are now handled correctly. This was\nparticularly an issue in Makefiles, where indentation must be tabs.\n\n### Diffing\n\nImproved word highlighting in changed comments. Whitespace is never\nunderlined and the characters `-` and `_` are now considered word\nconstituents.\n\n### Display\n\n`--display=inline` now respects `--tab-width`.\n\nFixed an issue with unwanted underlines with textual diffing when\nDFT_GRAPH_LIMIT is reached.\n\nImproved syntax highlighting for predefined types in TypeScript.\n\n## 0.40 (released 28th December 2022)\n\n### Diffing\n\nDiffing is now more efficient: the generated graphs have ~20% fewer\nvertices. This improves performance (less memory, shorter runtime),\nand also enables difftastic to handle larger files (you're less likely\nto reach `DFT_GRAPH_LIMIT`).\n\nThis improvement was contributed by @QuarticCat, thanks!\n\n### Parsing\n\n`rebar` files (e.g. `rebar.lock`) are no longer associated with\nErlang, only `*.erl` files, as the Erlang parser does not currently\nsupport them.\n\n### Command Line Interface\n\n`--list-languages` now shows filenames associated with languages\n(e.g. `Cargo.lock` is TOML) in addition to extensions.\n\n### Display\n\nSymlinks are now expanded before calculating relative paths, resulting\nin relative paths being shown in more cases.\n\n### Build\n\nDifftastic is now built with Ubuntu 20.04 on GitHub, so prebuilt\nbinaries do not require libc version 2.32. This was broken in 0.39 due\nto a GitHub default changing.\n\n## 0.39 (released 19th December 2022)\n\n### Parsing\n\nAdded support for Erlang.\n\nImproved detection of binary content when the MIME type database\nincorrectly claims a text file is another format.\n\n### Display\n\nPaths are now always displayed relative to the current working\ndirectory.\n\nFixed a race condition where diffing directories would lead to\ninterleaved output from different files.\n\n### Command Line Interface\n\nAdded a `--check-only` flag that reports if there are any syntactic\ndifferences, but doesn't calculate or print them. This is much faster\nthan normal syntactic diffing.\n\nDifftastic now sets the exit code if it finds changes and\n`--exit-code` is set. See [usage in the\nmanual](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/usage.html) for the full list\nof exit codes used.\n\n## 0.38 (released 14th November 2022)\n\n### Parsing\n\nSyntax error nodes are now always treated as atoms. This produces\nbetter results when difftastic doesn't fully support the syntax\n(e.g. PostCSS is a superset of CSS) or when there are actual syntax\nerrors.\n\nFixed a crash on file content detection when the local MIME database\ncontains blank lines.\n\n### Display\n\nLine numbers styling has been tweaked to make it more visually\ndistinct from file content.\n\nFixed an issue with inline display discarding newlines when color is\ndisabled, leading to broken display.\n\nTwo column display now ensures that both columns have the same width,\nso line wrapping is at the same point on both sides.\n\n## 0.37 (released 14th October 2022)\n\n### Manual\n\nAdded a Chinese translation: https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/zh-CN/\n\n### Diffing\n\nImproved runtime performance and memory usage (thanks to @QuarticCat).\n\nStandalone `.` is now considered punctuation in the diff cost model,\nwhich improves diff results in some cases.\n\n### Parsing\n\nUpdated to the latest tree-sitter parser for Swift.\n\n### Command Line Interface\n\nDifftastic will now read a file from stdin if given `-` as a path\nargument.\n\nAdded an option `--context` to control the number of lines of context\ndisplayed.\n\n`--list-languages` now respects the value of `--color`, whose default\nonly uses styling when stdout is a TTY.\n\n### Display\n\nFixed side-by-side display width when color is disabled (when piping\ndifftastic stdout or with `--color=never`).\n\n### Build\n\nFixed an issue with building on Windows with gcc.\n\n## 0.36.1 (released 17th September 2022)\n\nFixed a release script that prevented 0.36.0 from including Windows\nbinaries.\n\n## 0.36 (released 17th September 2022)\n\n### Diffing\n\nImproved diff cost model to prefer finding unchanged variable names\nover unchanged punctuation.\n\n### Parsing\n\nAdded support for Hare, Pascal and QML.\n\nZIP files are now always treated as binary files.\n\nDifftastic is now stricter about text content validity, so more binary\nfiles are correctly detected.\n\n### Display\n\nChanged words in changed comments are now also underlined, to make\nthem more visible.\n\nFixed crash when word-wrapping lines containing Unicode combining\ndiacritics characters.\n\n## 0.35 (released 2nd September 2022)\n\n### Diffing\n\nDifftastic now fixes sliders in more cases, producing better diff results.\n\n### Parsing\n\nDifftastic will now autodetect files in UTF-16-BE and\nUTF-16-LE. Previously it required files to be UTF-8.\n\nAdded support for Makefiles.\n\nFixed an issue with HCL language detection on `.workflow` files. Fixed\nan issue with Makefile language detection.\n\n### Command Line Interface\n\nFixed terminal width detection when only stderr is a TTY (e.g. when\nusing difftastic with git). This was broken in 0.34.\n\nAdded an option `--list-languages` which reports all the languages\nsupported, along with the extensions associated with them.\n\n## 0.34 (released 27th August 2022)\n\n### Build\n\nFixed build on Rust 1.61+.\n\n### Display\n\nFixed an issue where side-by-side display would sometimes print the\nline number from the second file rather than the first file.\n\n## 0.33 (released 21st August 2022)\n\n### Diffing\n\nDifftastic now explores 2x more parenthesis nesting\npossibilities. This can make diffing slower, but produces\nsubstantially better results.\n\n### Parsing\n\nAdded support for CMake.\n\nImproved comment detection using tree-sitter syntax highlighting\nqueries.\n\nFixed an issue with language detection when file names were very\nshort.\n\n### Command Line Interface\n\nDifftastic prefers to show the second path when called with two\narguments. This fixes an issue (broken in 0.31) where the path would\nbe shown as `/tmp/git-blob-abc/file_name`.\n\n### Build\n\nDifftastic now requires Rust 1.57 to build.\n\nFixed build on Windows. Previously it would fail\nnon-deterministically.\n\n## 0.32 (released 7th August 2022)\n\n### Diffing\n\nImproved performance in many cases, particularly for files with a\nfairly flat structure.\n\n### Command Line Interface\n\nDifftastic now treats the path `/dev/null` as an empty file, even if\nthat path doesn't exist on the current machine. This fixes a crash\nwhen using difftastic with git on Windows.\n\n## 0.31 (released 11th July 2022)\n\n### Parsing\n\nAdded Hacklang and SQL support.\n\nUpdated to the latest tree-sitter parsers for C#, Dart, Elm, Gleam,\nHaskell, HCL, Java, JSON, OCaml, PHP, Python, Ruby, Scala and\nTypeScript.\n\n### Display\n\nFixed an issue with inline mode where there was a blank line between\nevery line.\n\n### Command Line Interface\n\nFixed language detection and filename display when one path was\n`/dev/null` and difftastic was invoked with two arguments.\n\n## 0.30 (released 4th July 2022)\n\n### Parsing\n\nAdded support for HTML and Julia.\n\n### Display\n\nFixed an issue where line numbers were coloured even when colour was\ndisabled.\n\nImproved alignment when files contain Unicode characters that are more\nthan one column wide.\n\nImproved syntax highlighting for conditionals, particularly for Dart,\nElvish and HCL.\n\n### Command Line Interface\n\n`--node-limit` has been replaced by `--graph-limit`, and the\ncorresponding environment variable `DFT_NODE_LIMIT` has been replaced\nwith `DFT_GRAPH_LIMIT`.\n\n`--graph-limit` makes difftastic give up on structural diffs after\ntraversing this many graph nodes. `--node-limit` applied a limit based\non an estimate of how big the graph would be, leading to very slow\ndiffs when the estimate was wrong.\n\nThis new setting sets a more accurate limit on difftastic\nperformance. It also means that difftastic will always try a\nstructural diff first. This will be slower for files that exceed\n`--graph-limit`, but guarantees that files with a small number of\nchanges will always get a structural diff.\n\n## 0.29.1 (released 13th June 2022)\n\nFixed a major memory regression in 0.29 when performing large\nline-based diffs (e.g. files of 100 KLOC or more).\n\n## 0.29 (released 9th June 2022)\n\nPerformance has improved in 0.29, and larger files typically see a 30%\nreduction in runtime.\n\n### Parsing\n\nImproved detection of binary files, including using\n`/usr/share/mime/magic` when available.\n\nImproved handling of comments and regexp literals in Perl.\n\nAdded Elvish support.\n\n### Diffing\n\nImproved delimiter heuristics in lisp-like languages.\n\n### Display\n\nDifftastic now displays information about file renames. Previously, it\nwould only show the new name.\n\n## 0.28 (released 29th April 2022)\n\n### Parsing\n\nAdded support for HCL, Perl and Swift.\n\nImproved language detection for JSON. More file extensions and file\nnames are recognised as JSON, e.g. `.jsonl`.\n\n### Display\n\nFixed crash in inline mode.\n\nAdded an option `--tab-width` that controls how many spaces are used\nto display tabs. The default value is 8, consistent with older\nversions.\n\nAdded an option `--syntax-highlight` that controls whether the output\nis syntax highlighted.\n\n### Diffing\n\nDifftastic now diffs files in parallel when diffing whole directories,\nincreasing performance.\n\nDirectory diffing now correctly handles files that are only in one of\nthe directories.\n\n### Command Line Interface\n\nFixed handling of paths that aren't valid UTF-8.\n\n`--missing-as-empty` now only applies when diffing files, and has no\neffect when diffing directories.\n\n### Note: Crates.io Is Patched\n\nDue to the 10 MB crate limit, two patches were applied before\nuploading to crates.io. The source code on crates.io therefore does\nnot exactly match this git tag.\n\n`Cargo.toml` had the include list changed (committed on master as\nd9ef270d273e3f7c61e2e167b7efbd33b36d0c96), and the vendored perl\nparser had whitespace removed with `sed \"s/^[ \\t]*//\" -i\nvendor/tree-sitter-perl-src/parser.c`.\n\n## 0.27 (released 18th April 2022)\n\n### Parsing\n\nAdded support for Kotlin and TOML.\n\nFixed an issue with YAML and `|` block strings.\n\nUpdated to the latest upstream C++, C#, Elixir, Go, Haskell, Java,\nPython, Ruby, Rust and TypeScript parsers.\n\n### Diffing\n\nImproved performance in large files when changes are clustered together.\n\n### Display\n\nImproved syntax highlighting.\n\nTabs are now rendered with eight spaces.\n\n### Command Line Interface\n\nDifftastic now validates environment variables the same way as\narguments. `DFT_DISPLAY=no-such-mode` will now error rather than\nsilently using the default display mode.\n\n### Build\n\nThe upstream Haskell parser has been ported from C++14 to pure C. This\nshould allow difftastic to build on platforms with older C++\ncompilers.\n\n## 0.26.3 (released 10th April 2022)\n\n### Release\n\nDifftastic now uses GitHub releases with precompiled binaries for\nLinux, macOS and Windows.\n\n## 0.26.2 (released 10th April 2022)\n\n### Build\n\nFixed compilation error on Windows due to GCC extension usage in the\ntree-sitter-nix library.\n\n## 0.26.1 (released 10th April 2022)\n\n### Build\n\nThis version of difftastic is also available as a GitHub release with\nprecompiled binaries available.\n\n### Parsing\n\nFixed Zig parsing of `@foo` identifiers.\n\n### Display\n\nFixed a crash when inserting newlines in JSX literals.\n\n## 0.26 (released 9th April 2022)\n\n### Build\n\nFixed an issue where C++ libraries were built before before the C\nlibraries that they depended on.\n\n### Display\n\nThe side-by-side display no longer pads the right column to fill the\nterminal. This improves display when the terminal is slightly shrunk,\nor when wide characters (e.g. emoji) are used.\n\nImproved syntax highlighting for boolean constants and character\nliterals.\n\n### Parsing\n\nAdded Gleam, Elm, YAML and Zig support.\n\nImproved Clojure parsing with `^Metadata`.\n\n### Command Line Interface\n\nAdded the `--display` option to switch between `side-by-side`,\n`side-by-side-show-both`, and `inline` display modes. This replaces\nthe `INLINE` and `DFT_SHOW_BOTH` environment variables.\n\nAdded the `--language` option to enable overriding language\ndetection. When specified, language detection is disabled, and the\ninput file is assumed to have the extension specified.\n\n### Diffing\n\nImproved diff results for nested sequences `foo(bar(baz()))` in C-like\nlanguages.\n\n## 0.25 (released 31st March 2022)\n\n### Display\n\nDifftastic no longer shows \"1/1\" when a file only has a single hunk.\n\nImproved Clojure and Scala syntax highlighting.\n\nWhen a file is entirely unchanged, difftastic now shows \"no changes\"\neven if it successfully parsed. Previously it would only show \"no\nsyntactic changes\".\n\nFixed an issue where some colors were shown when `--color never` was\nspecified.\n\nFixed a crash when a text file ended with a multibyte character.\n\nFixed side-by-side display when source files contained CRLF.\n\n### Parsing\n\nFixed an issue in C and C++ where blank lines were highlighted after\nnovel preprocessor lines.\n\nFixed an issue with parsing `[` and `]` in Java.\n\nFixed an issue with parsing interpolated strings in PHP.\n\nAdded support for Janet, Lua and Nix.\n\n## 0.24 (released 26th March 2022)\n\n### Diffing\n\nReduced the default value of DFT_NODE_LIMIT from 100,000 to\n30,000. This fixes cases where files near the limit would use too much\nmemory and not terminate.\n\n### Display\n\nFixed an issue where hunks would be missing lines. This occurred in\ncertain circumstances when a line contained both changed and unchanged\nparts.\n\nFixed an issue where blank lines at the beginning or end of a file\nwould be excluded from context.\n\nFixed an issue where lines containing only whitespace would be\nhighlighted in purple.\n\nFixed an issue with changed multiline strings where blank lines were\nnot highlighted.\n\nImproved Clojure syntax highlighting.\n\n### Parsing\n\nAdded support for Dart.\n\n### Command Line Interface\n\nDifftastic will now warn if both arguments point to the same file.\n\nWhen diffing directories, diff results are printed incrementally\nrather than waiting for the results of all files before printing.\n\n## 0.23.1 (released 19th March 2022)\n\nFixed crash where the 'shrink unchanged' logic would not set the\nchange state on the outer list.\n\n## 0.23 (released 17th March 2022)\n\n### Diffing\n\nImproved performance on very large files that are compared by text.\n\nFixed some cases where changing list delimiters would lead to\nincorrect diffs.\n\nFixed an issue where lines were not aligned correctly after correcting\nsliders.\n\nFixed an issue the outermost delimiter in lists was sometimes\nincorrectly marked as unchanged, producing non-optimal diffs.\n\n### Display\n\nDisplay now prefers to align blank lines in the display, producing\nsignificantly better results in many cases.\n\nFixed an issue where some lines in a hunk were not displayed.\n\n## 0.22 (released 10th March 2022)\n\nDifftastic now requires Rust 1.56 to build.\n\n### Parsing\n\nAdded support for PHP.\n\nFixed handling of `<` `>` delimiters in C++ and Rust.\n\n### Diffing\n\nDifftastic will now split files that contain obviously unchanged\nregions, substantially improving performance when a file has multiple\nchanges that have many unchanged items between them.\n\nImproved diff results when choosing between syntax nodes at different\nnesting levels. This is restoring a heuristic that was removed in\n0.20.\n\nImproved diff results when lists have unequal sizes.\n\nImproved diff results when the language parser thinks that names occur\nin different syntactic positions.\n\nAdjusted the heuristics for 'so much has changed in this expression\nthat it is confusing to highlight the unchanged parts'. The heuristic\nis now less aggressive, which helps performance and seems to produce\nslightly better results.\n\n## 0.21 (released 28th February 2022)\n\n### Parsing\n\nDifftastic now understands `-*-` file headers (as used by Emacs) when\nperforming language detection.\n\n### Display\n\nImproved alignment logic. This fixes a bug where the last line of a\nfile wasn't displayed, and generally improves how difftastic chooses\nto align content.\n\nFixed a crash when line wrapping produced an entirely blank line.\n\n### Diffing\n\nImproved word diffing (in both comments and textual diffs) when source\ncontains Unicode characters. Word splitting now uses the Unicode\nalphabetic property.\n\nFixed a crash when comments contained multibyte Unicode characters.\n\n## 0.20 (released 20th February 2022)\n\n### Diffing\n\nDiffing now correctly handles nodes being moved to parent\nlists. Previously this would be ignored, leading to difftastic\nincorrectly claiming things were unchanged. This also leads to better\ndiffing results in general, although is somewhat slower (2x in\ntesting).\n\nImproved slider logic in larger expressions.\n\nIncreased the default value DFT_NODE_LIMIT to 100,000 (from\n50,000). This increases the likelihood that files get a syntactic diff\nwhilst still having acceptable performance.\n\n### Display\n\nFixed an issue where whole file additions/removals were printed twice.\n\nFixed an issue where difftastic didn't show context on hunks where the\nunchanged content was on different lines.\n\nHunks are now merged if the lines are immediately adjacent\n(e.g. hunk 1 ends on line 11, hunk 2 starts on line 12), not just if\nthey're overlapping.\n\n### Command Line Interface\n\nDifftastic will now use a text dif for large files that are too big to\nparse in a reasonable amount of time. This threshold is\nconfigurable with `--byte-limit` and `DFT_BYTE_LIMIT`.\n\nFixed a crash when called with zero arguments.\n\n## 0.19 (released 7th February 2022)\n\n### Parsing\n\nFixed an issue with changes being ignored in OCaml's `{||}` string\nliterals.\n\n### Display\n\nFixed an issue where larger additions were not lined up with removals.\n\nImproved syntax highlighting for Clojure, Common Lisp and TypeScript.\n\nComments are now highlighted with italics, making it easier to see\nsyntax even when text is red.\n\nBuilt-in constants are now highlighted consistently with other\nconstants.\n\nImproved minor display issues when one file is longer than the other.\n\n### Diffing\n\nIf given binary files, difftastic will now report if the file contents\nare identical.\n\nDifftastic will now use a text diff for large files, rather than\ntrying to use more memory than is available. This threshold is\nconfigurable with `--node-limit` and `DFT_NODE_LIMIT`.\n\nFixed a bug in the text diff logic where lines weren't shown if they\ndid not have both word additions and word removals.\n\n### Command Line Interface\n\nDifftastic will now error if either argument does not exist, unless\n`--missing-as-empty` (new argument) is passed. This is a better\ndefault, but requires Mercurial uses to [specify this\nflag](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/mercurial.html) in their\nconfiguration.\n\n## 0.18.1 (released 30 January 2022)\n\nFixed a compilation issue on Rust 1.54 (0.18 only built on newer\nversions of Rust).\n\n## 0.18 (released 30 January 2022)\n\n### Parsing\n\nFixed an issue with missing positions in OCaml attribute syntax.\n\nFixed parsing issues in Common Lisp: character literals, `loop` macro\nusage with `maximizing`.\n\n### Diffing\n\nImproved performance when diffing a single large expression.\n\n### Display\n\nFixed display issues where lines were printed more than once.\n\nSubword changes in comments are now shown in bold, to make them more\nvisible.\n\nImproved colours on terminals with light coloured backgrounds.\n\n### Command Line Interface\n\nAdded a `--width` option which allows overriding `DFT_WIDTH`, and is\nmore discoverable.\n\nAdded a `--color` option which allows explicitly enabling/disabling\ncolour output.\n\nAdded a `--background` option which controls whether difftastic uses\nbright or dark colours. This can also be controlled by\n`DFT_BACKGROUND`.\n\nAdded a `--skip-unchanged` option which suppresses printing for files\nthat have no changes.\n\n## 0.17 (released 25 January 2022)\n\n### Diffing\n\nImproved performance when all file changes are close together.\n\nFixed a bug where syntax after the last changed item was incorrectly\nmarked as added.\n\n### Display\n\nAdded syntax highlighting for unchanged comments, strings and types.\n\nFixed a bug (introduced in 0.15) where identical text files were\nreported as binary files.\n\n## 0.16 (released 22 January 2022)\n\n### Parsing\n\nWhitespace in JSX is parsed more closely to React's whitespace\ntrimming rules.\n\nFixed parsing of heredocs in shell scripts. They are now treated as\nstring literals.\n\nFixed parsing of type variables and tags in OCaml.\n\nImproved language detection for files with bash/sh syntax.\n\n### Integration\n\nFixed a crash when on Mercurial diffs when a whole file has been\nremoved.\n\n### Display\n\nImproved display performance when there are a large number of hunks.\n\nFixed several issues where lines were displayed more than once in a\nhunk.\n\nFixed an issue where the first changed line was not displayed.\n\n### Diffing\n\nImproved diffing performance (both time and memory usage).\n\nSliders are now fixed up after diffing. This produces better looking\nresults in more cases, and makes the primary diffing faster.\n\nFixed some corner cases in the line parser where it would match up\nisolated newline character as unchanged, leading to weird alignment.\n\n## 0.15 (released 6 January 2022)\n\n### Parsing\n\nMoved to the [official Elixir\nparser](https://github.com/elixir-lang/tree-sitter-elixir).\n\nUpdated the Bash, C, C++, C#, Haskell, Java, OCaml, Python, Ruby and\nTypeScript parsers to the latest upstream version.\n\nFixed a parsing performance regression introduced in 0.13.\n\n### Diffing\n\nText diffing now has a standalone implementation rather than reusing\nstructural diff logic. This is signficantly faster and highlighted\nbetter.\n\nImproved performance when diffing two identical files. This is common\nwhen diffing directorires.\n\n### Display\n\nImproved highlighting heuristics for added/removed blank lines.\n\nFixed an alignment bug where the last line being novel would lead to\npoor alignment of unchanged lines.\n\nFixed minor formatting issues when reporting that a file is binary.\n\nImproved display performance on large files.\n\n## 0.14 (released 27 December 2021)\n\n### Parsing\n\nImproved language detection if a file has a recognised filename\n(e.g. `Rakefile`) or a shebang (e.g. `#!/usr/bin/env node`).\n\n### Display\n\nDisplay width can now be overridden by setting the environment\nvariable DFT_WIDTH.\n\nFixed terminal width calculations on Windows.\n\nFixed crash when only one side has changes, but the other side has\nadditional blank lines.\n\nFixed crash on displaying unicode characters on line boundaries.\n\n### Build\n\nFixed some build issues on Windows.\n\n## 0.13 (released 4 December 2021)\n\n### Parsing\n\nAdded Bash, Common Lisp and Ruby support.\n\nUpdated the C, CSS and JSON parsers to the latest upstream versions.\n\nExpanded filename associations, so difftastic recognises more files.\n\nImproved parsing for regex and template string literals in JavaScript\nand TypeScript.\n\nImproved parsing for float values in CSS.\n\nImproved word diffing on punctuation in comments.\n\nWhen logging is enabled (e.g. `RUST_LOG=warn`), difftastic now warns\non syntax errors. Difftastic is intended to be robust against syntax\nerrors, so this is primarily intended for parser debugging.\n\n### Build\n\nDifftastic now requires fewer C compiler flags, so it should build in\nmore environments (e.g. compiling with MSVC).\n\n## 0.12 (released 19 November 2021)\n\n### Display\n\nEvery hunk is now shown with the file name and a hunk number. This\nmakes it easier to see which file you're looking at when there are\nmany changes.\n\nKeywords in added/removed regions are now shown in bold, to give\nmodified regions basic syntax highlighting. Previously, all\nadded/removed regions were bold.\n\nLines with changes are now shown in a different colour in side-by-side\ndisplay.\n\nThe display logic has been written in terms of a `Hunk` type. This\nproduces more accurate context, with better alignment, especially when\nthe context contains blank lines.\n\nIf only a single side has changes (e.g. additions but no removals),\nonly one column is shown, to maximise display usage.\n\nDifftastic now wraps rather than truncating lines that are too long\nfor the terminal width.\n\nIf a file has no syntactic changes, difftastic now shows the file name\nconsistently with changed files.\n\n### Command Line Interface\n\nThe difftastic binary is now named `difft`, to reduce typing during\nusage.\n\n### Parsing\n\nUpdated to latest upstream Haskell parser ([commit\nd72f2e4](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-haskell/commit/d72f2e42c0d5ccf8e8b1c39e3642428317e8fe02)).\n\n### Diffing\n\nFixed a bug when diffing multiline comments where unchanged parts were\nnot highlighted correctly.\n\n## 0.11 (released 18 October 2021)\n\n### Parsing\n\nImproved handling of paired delimiters, particularly in C, C++ and C#.\n\nImproved word splitting in when diffing similar comments (it's now\nmore granular).\n\nFixed a rare issue where single-item lists were flattened.\n\n### Diffing\n\nDiff calculations are now greedier when syntax nodes are identical, making\ndiffing significantly faster when most syntax nodes are the same.\n\n### Integration\n\nAdded support for Mercurial, see [this section in the\nmanual](http://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/getting_started.html#mercurial-external-diffs)\nfor instructions.\n\n### Display\n\nAdded basic syntax highlighting for comments (dimmed) and keywords\n(bold) in unchanged source code.\n\nCharacters that don't have a position in the parsed syntax tree are\nnow displayed in purple, to make bugs more obvious. Previously they\nwere dimmed.\n\n## 0.10.1 (released 28 September 2021)\n\n### Build\n\nFix compilation on macOS where the C++ compiler defaulted to a\nversion of C++ older than C++14.\n\n## 0.10 (released 24 September 2021)\n\n### Parsing\n\nAdded a C parser.\n\nAdded a C++ parser. Difftastic prefers the C++ parser for `.h`\nfiles. Please file a bug if you see issues.\n\nAdded a C# parser.\n\nAdded a Haskell parser.\n\nRemoved legacy regex-based parsing backend.\n\n### Diffing\n\nSome additional runtime optimisations.\n\n### Manual\n\nAdded a chapter on difficult cases for tree diff algorithms.\n\n## 0.9 (released 14 September 2021)\n\n### Parsing\n\nAdded TypeScript parser and TSX parser. Added Elixir parser.\n\nThe following extensions are now associated with Clojure: `.bb`,\n`.boot`, `.clj`, `.cljc`, `.clje`, `.cljs`, `.cljx`, `.edn`, `.joke`\nand `.joker`.\n\nFixed an issue with parsing integer values in CSS with units,\ne.g. `123px`.\n\nImproved parsing of Rust punctuation like `&` and `::` inside macro\ninvocations. Improved handling of `|closure_param|` and `[` `]`\ndelimiters in Rust.\n\nThe line-based parser for text files now uses word-level diffs.\n\n### Diffing\n\nOptimised Dijkstra implementation, improving runtime performance.\n\n### Display\n\nSide-by-side displays now uses the same width for the left and right\ncolumns, regardless of the content.\n\n### Internals\n\nDifftastic is now a library with a main binary. No APIs are considered\nstable for external usage. This is intended to make benchmarking\neasier.\n\n## 0.8 (released 5 September 2021)\n\n### Git integration\n\nFixed a crash on removing whole files.\n\n### Parsing\n\nTree-sitter parsing is now the default, unless the environment\nvariable DFT_RX is set.\n\nTree-sitter parser: Improved handling of string literals. Improved\nmatching of delimiters.\n\nAdded Python parser.\n\nAdded Java parser.\n\nJSON (legacy parser): fixed parsing string literals (broken in 0.7).\n\nRemoved Scheme support, as there's no tree-sitter parser available.\n\n### Display\n\nFixed crashes on files with non-ASCII characters on long lines.\n\nFixed an issue where multiline comments were not highlighted\ncorrectly.\n\nImproved display to better use the whole width when whole files are\nadded or removed.\n\n### Command Line Interface\n\nRemoved the unused `--lang` argument.\n\nDifftastic now handles writing to a closed pipe (SIGPIPE) gracefully\nrather than crashing.\n\nDifftastic now has some debugging logs available. `RUST_LOG=trace`\nwill show information on the route found during graph solving.\n\n## 0.7 (released 24 August 2021)\n\n### Git integration\n\nFixed issues when adding/removing a whole file meant that difftastic\ndidn't display anything.\n\nFixed a crash on renaming a file.\n\nColour is now enabled when using git with a pager.\n\n### Display\n\nSide-by-side display now uses \"...\" for column numbers when aligning\nlines. This makes hunks more obvious, but hunks now also have two\nblank lines between them to make it clearer.\n\nFixed an issue where screen width was not shared evenly by LHS and\nRHS.\n\nSide-by-side display will now use the full width of the screen when\nusing a pager (i.e. if stdout is a not a TTY).\n\nSide-by-side display now handles whole file additions better,\npreferring a single column display.\n\nDisplay width calculations are now based on the longest line visible\nin the diff, not the longest line in the file.\n\n### Parsing\n\nAdded tree-sitter parsers. These have known bugs, but you can try\nthem by setting the environment variable `DFT_TS=y`.\n\nFixed handling of `->` in Rust.\n\n### Diffing\n\nDifftastic will now prefer matching up comments that are similar\n(according to levenshtein distance).\n\nContiguous syntax logic now considers close delimiter positions, so\n`[ \\n ];` now treats the `;` atom as contiguous.\n\nFixed an issue where diffs would prefer prefer a low depth change on a\ndelimiter over a delimiter that gave contiguous changes.\n\n### Command Line Interface\n\nRemoved the `--width` argument.\n\nAdded debug options `--dump-syntax` and `--dump-ts` for viewing parse\ntrees. The output of these options may change without notice.\n\n## 0.6 (released 27 July 2021)\n\n### Parsing\n\nFixed handling of `@`, `<` and `>` in elisp.\n\nFixed crash on binary files. Difftastic now simply shows \"binary\" for\nfiles that don't look like text.\n\nAdded a basic Go parser.\n\n### Diffing\n\nFixed an issue where comment replacements were not detected.\n\nChanged words in comments are now only highlighted when comments are\nrelatively similar (according to their Levenshtein distance).\n\nMultiline comments are now considered unchanged if only their\nindentation changes.\n\nImproved alignment for lines at the beginning of a changed group of\nlines.\n\nImproved horizontal spacing between before and after code shown.\n\nFixed an issue where source code containing tab characters was not\ncorrectly aligned.\n\n### Command Line Interface\n\nRemoved unused `--inline` and `--context` arguments.\n\nFixed crash when called with no arguments.\n\n## 0.5 (released 22 July 2021)\n\n### Parsing\n\nFixed a crash on parsing non-ASCII source files. Fixed a crash on\nfiles without an extension. Fixed crashes on empty files.\n\nInput files that aren't valid UTF-8 are now replaced with � rather\nthan giving up.\n\nImproved parsing for Rust punctuation.\n\nImproved parsing for OCaml punctuation, including `:=` and `method!`.\n\nImproved parsing for Emacs Lisp symbols containing `+` and `=`, and\npunctuation of `#`, `.` and `&`.\n\nImproved parsing for Scheme symbols containing `=`, and punctuation of\n`#` and `.`.\n\nImproved parsing of `=` and `&` in Clojure.\n\nImproved parsing of `:`, `,`, and constants in JSON.\n\nImproved parsing of string literals in all languages, supporting\nescaped delimiters such as `\"\\\"\"` and removing incorrect support for\nsingle-quoted strings in JSON.\n\n### Diffing\n\nReduced memory usage when diffing.\n\nDifftastic now highlights word-level changes between comments.\n\nDiffing now prefers contiguous nodes even when entering a list, so\n`(foo` is considered contiguous.\n\nLarge AST trees with very few common nodes are now considered wholly\nnovel, rather than trying to match up the few common nodes. This\navoids nonsensical diffs when toplevel function A is completely\nreplaced with function B and they only have something trivial in\ncommon (e.g. the `function` keyword).\n\n### Command Line Interface\n\nImproved `--help`.\n\n### Integration\n\nIt's now possible to use `difftastic` with `git diff` and `git show`!\n\n## 0.4 (released 13 July 2021)\n\n### Parsing\n\nImproved parsing for Rust macro definitions and punctuation.\n\nImproved parsing for OCaml punctuation, and added `.mli` as an OCaml\nfile extension.\n\n### Diffing\n\nDiff calculation is now significantly faster.\n\nDifftastic now considers nesting depth when comparing AST nodes, and\ntries to match nodes with similar nesting levels.\n\nDifftastic now prefers marking multiple items on the same line as\nnovel, rather than adjacent items on different lines. This helps avoid\n[sliders](https://twitter.com/_wilfredh/status/1411949035871637509),\nwhere the diff chooses a keyword on the 'wrong' side.\n\nFixed an issue where complex diffs would not display some unchanged\nlines.\n\n### Robustness\n\nFixed a crash when diff context included the first line.\n\nFixed a crash when plain text content contained certain non-ASCII\ncharacters.\n\n## 0.3 (released 7 July 2021)\n\nDiffs are now displayed with unchanged lines aligned to the other side.\n\nImproved Rust parsing to recognise lifetime syntax `'foo`, character\nliterals `'x'` and punctuation.\n\nImproved punctuation parsing for OCaml and JS.\n\nFixed an issue where the diff calculated may not be minimal.\n\nFixed a crash on files with no changes.\n\n## 0.2 (released 4 July 2021)\n\nFirst version using Dijkstra's algorithm for calculating diffs.\n\n## 0.1\n\nExperimenting with different implementation ideas.\n"

It highlights the matching `{` and\n`}`, but understands that `foo()` hasn't changed despite the leading\nwhitespace.\n\n(2) Difftastic understands which lines should be aligned. It's aligned\n`bar(1)` on the left with `bar(2)` on the right, even though the\ntextual content isn't identical.\n\n(3) Difftastic understands that line-wrapping isn't\nmeaningful. `\"eric\"` is now on a new line, but it hasn't changed.\n\n## One Minute Demo\n\n[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/480875.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/480875)\n\nThis one minute screencast demonstrates difftastic usage with both\nstandalone files and git.\n\n## Languages\n\nDifftastic supports over 30 programming languages, see [the\nmanual](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/languages_supported.html) for the full list.\n\nIf a file has an unrecognised extension, difftastic uses a\ntextual diff with word highlighting.\n\n## Known Issues\n\nPerformance. Difftastic scales relatively poorly on files with a large\nnumber of changes, and can use a lot of memory.\n\nDisplay. Difftastic has a side-by-side display which usually works well, but can\nbe confusing.\n\nRobustness. Difftastic regularly has releases that fix crashes.\n\n## Non-goals\n\nPatching. Difftastic output is intended for human consumption, and it\ndoes not generate patches that you can apply later. Use `diff` if you\nneed a patch.\n\n(Patch files are also line-oriented, which is too limited for\ndifftastic. Difftastic might find additions and removals on the same\nline, and it tracks the relationship between line numbers in the old\nand new file.)\n\nMerging. AST merging is a hard problem that difftastic does not\naddress.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Isn't this basically `--word-diff --ignore-all-space`?\n\nWord diffing [can't do\nthis](https://twitter.com/_wilfredh/status/1510139929971421191/photo/1).\n\nDifftastic parses your code. It understands when whitespace matters,\nsuch as inside string literals or languages like Python. It understands\nthat `x-1` is three tokens in JS but one token in Lisp.\n\n### Can I use difftastic with git?\n\nYou can! The difftastic manual [includes instructions for git\nusage](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/git.html). You can also use it\n[with mercurial](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/mercurial.html).\n\nIf you're a magit user, check out [this blog\npost](https://tsdh.org/posts/2022-08-01-difftastic-diffing-with-magit.html)\nshowing one way to use difftastic with magit.\n\n### Does difftastic integrate with my favourite tool?\n\nProbably not. Difftastic is young. Consider writing a plugin for your\nfavourite tool, and I will link it in the README!\n\n### Can difftastic help me with merge conflicts?\n\nYes! As of version 0.50, difftastic understands merge conflict markers\n(i.e. `<<<<<<<`, `=======` and `>>>>>>>`).\n\nPass your file with conflicts as a single argument to\ndifftastic. Difftastic will construct the two conflicting files and\ndiff those.\n\n```\n$ difft file_with_conflicts.js\n```\n\n### Can difftastic do merges?\n\nNo. AST merging is a hard problem that difftastic does not address.\n\nAST diffing is a lossy process from the perspective of a text\ndiff. Difftastic will ignore whitespace that isn't syntactically\nsignificant, but merging requires tracking whitespace.\n\nThe [mergiraf](https://mergiraf.org/) tool does offer merges based on\na tree-sitter AST however.\n\n### Can difftastic ignore reordering?\n\nNo. Difftastic always considers order to be important, so diffing\ne.g. `set(1, 2)` and `set(2, 1)` will show changes.\n\nIf you're diffing JSON, consider sorting the keys before passing them\nto difftastic.\n\n```\n$ difft <(jq --sort-keys < file_1.json) <(jq --sort-keys < file_2.json)\n```\n\nSee also [Tricky Cases: Unordered Data\nTypes](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/tricky_cases.html#unordered-data-types)\nin the manual.\n\n### Can I use difftastic to check for syntactic changes without diffing?\n\nYes. Difftastic can check if the two files have the same AST, without\ncalculating a diff. This is much faster than normal diffing, and\nuseful for building tools that check for changes.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\n$ difft --check-only --exit-code before.js after.js\n```\n\nThis will set the exit code to 0 if there are no syntactic changes, or\n1 if there are changes found.\n\n### Why aren't colours appearing in my terminal?\n\nDifftastic uses ANSI bright colours by default, but some terminal\nthemes show bright colours as grey. Solarized is a popular theme that\ndoes this.\n\nIf you're a Solarized user, use `export DFT_BACKGROUND=light` to\ndisable bright colours, or try a different terminal colour scheme.\n\n### How does it work?\n\nDifftastic treats structural diffing as a graph problem, and uses\nDijkstra's algorithm.\n\nMy [blog\npost](https://www.wilfred.me.uk/blog/2022/09/06/difftastic-the-fantastic-diff/)\ndescribes the design, and there is also an [internals section in the\nmanual](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/diffing.html).\n\n## Translation\n\n+ [Chinese](./translation/zh-CN/README-zh-CN.md)\n\n## License\n\nDifftastic is open source under the MIT license, see LICENSE for more\ndetails.\n\nThis repository also includes tree-sitter parsers by other authors in\nthe `vendored_parsers/` directory.

Difftastic produces accurate diffs\nthat are easier for humans to read.\n\nOPTIONS\n-------\n\n**\\-\\-background** _BACKGROUND_\n\n: Set the background brightness. Difftastic will prefer brighter colours on dark\n  backgrounds.\n\n**\\-\\-byte-limit** _LIMIT_\n\n: Use a text diff if either input file exceeds this size.\n\n**\\-\\-check-only**\n\n: Report whether there are any changes, but don't calculate them. Much faster.\n\n**\\-\\-color** _WHEN_\n\n: When to use color output.\n\n**\\-\\-context** _LINES_\n\n: The number of contextual lines to show around changed lines.\n\n**\\-\\-display** _MODE_\n\n: Display mode for showing results.\n\n    _side-by-side_: Display the before file and the after file in two separate columns, with\n    line numbers aligned according to unchanged content. If a change is exclusively\n    additions or exclusively removals, use a single column.\n\n    _side-by-side-show-both_: The same as _side-by-side_, but always uses two columns.\n\n    _inline_: A single column display, closer to traditional diff display.\n\n    _json_: Output the results as a machine-readable JSON array with an element per file.\n\n**\\-\\-exit-code**\n\n: Set the exit code to 1 if there are syntactic changes in any files. For files where\n  there is no detected language (e.g. unsupported language or binary files), sets the exit\n  code if there are any byte changes.\n\n**\\-\\-graph-limit** _LIMIT_\n\n: Use a text diff if the structural graph exceed this number of nodes in memory.\n\n**-h, \\-\\-help**\n\n: Print help information.\n\n**\\-\\-ignore-comments**\n\n: Don't consider comments when diffing.\n\n**\\-\\-list-languages**\n\n: Print the all the languages supported by difftastic, along with their extensions.\n\n**\\-\\-override** _GLOB:NAME_\n\n: Associate this glob pattern with this language, overriding normal language detection.\n  For example:\n\n    $ difft \\-\\-override='*.c:C++' old.c new.c\n\n    See **\\-\\-list-languages** for the list of language names. Language names are matched case\n    insensitively. Overrides may also specify the language _\"text\"_ to treat a file as plain\n    text.\n\n    This argument may be given more than once. For example:\n\n    $ difft \\-\\-override='CustomFile:json' \\-\\-override='*.c:text' old.c new.c\n\n    To configure multiple overrides using environment variables, difftastic also accepts\n    **DFT_OVERRIDE_1** up to **DFT_OVERRIDE_9**.\n\n    $ export DFT_OVERRIDE='CustomFile:json'\n    $ export DFT_OVERRIDE_1='*.c:text'\n    $ export DFT_OVERRIDE_2='*.js:javascript jsx'\n\n    When multiple overrides are specified, the first matching override wins.\n\n**\\-\\-parse-error-limit** _LIMIT_\n\n: Use a text diff if the number of parse errors exceeds this value.\n\n**\\-\\-skip-unchanged**\n\n: Don't display anything if a file is unchanged.\n\n**\\-\\-sort-paths**\n\n: When diffing a directory, output the results sorted by path. This is slower.\n\n**\\-\\-strip-cr**\n\n: Remove any carriage return characters before diffing. This can be helpful when dealing\n  with files on Windows that contain CRLF, i.e. **\\r\\n**.\n\n**\\-\\-syntax-highlight** _on/off_\n\n: Enable or disable syntax highlighting.\n\n**\\-\\-tab-width** _NUMSPACES_\n\n: Treat a tab as this many spaces.\n\n**-V, \\-\\-version**\n\n: Print version information.\n\n**\\-\\-width** _COLUMNS_\n\n: Use this many columns when calculating line wrapping. If not specified, difftastic will\n  detect the terminal width.\n\nDEBUG OPTIONS\n-------------\n\n**\\-\\-dump-syntax** _PATH_\n\n: Parse a single file with tree-sitter and display the difftastic syntax tree.\n\n**\\-\\-dump-ts** _PATH_\n\n: Parse a single file with tree-sitter and display the tree-sitter parse\n  tree.\n\nMANUAL\n======\n\nA full HTML manual is available at <https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/introduction>.\n\nBUGS\n====\n\nSee GitHub issues at <https://github.com/Wilfred/difftastic/issues>.\n\nAUTHOR\n======\n\nWilfred Hughes <me@wilfred.me.uk>\n"
