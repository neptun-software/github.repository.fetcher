          "content": "# Contributing to TiKV\n\nThanks for your interest in contributing to TiKV! This document outlines some of the conventions on building, running, and testing TiKV, the development workflow, commit message formatting, contact points and other resources.\n\nTiKV has many dependent repositories. If you need any help or mentoring getting started, understanding the codebase, or making a PR (or anything else really), please ask on [Slack](https://slack.tidb.io/invite?team=tikv-wg&channel=general). If you don't know where to start, please click on the contributor icon below to get you on the right contributing path.\n\n[<img src=\"images/contribution-map.png\" alt=\"contribution-map\" width=\"180\">](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-map/blob/master/maps/contribution-map.md#tikv-distributed-transactional-key-value-database)\n\n## Building and setting up a development workspace\n\nTiKV is mostly written in Rust, but has components written in C++ (RocksDB, gRPC). We are currently using the Rust nightly toolchain. To provide consistency, we use linters and automated formatting tools.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nTo build TiKV you'll need to at least have the following installed:\n\n* `git` - Version control\n* [`rustup`](https://rustup.rs/) - Rust installer and toolchain manager\n* `make` - Build tool (run common workflows)\n* `cmake` - Build tool (required for gRPC)\n* `awk` - Pattern scanning/processing language\n* [`protoc`](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases) - Google protocol buffer compiler\n* `C++ compiler` - gcc 5+ or clang (required for gRPC)\n\nIf you are targeting platforms other than x86_64/aarch64 Linux or macOS, you'll also need:\n\n* [`llvm` and `clang`](http://releases.llvm.org/download.html) - Used to generate bindings for different platforms and build native libraries (required for grpcio, rocksdb).\n\n### Getting the repository\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/tikv/tikv.git\ncd tikv\n# Future instructions assume you are in this directory\n```\n\n### Configuring your Rust toolchain\n\n`rustup` is the official toolchain manager for Rust, similar to `rvm` or `rbenv` from the Ruby world.\n\nTiKV is pinned to a version of Rust using a `rust-toolchain` file. `rustup` and `cargo` will automatically use this file. We also use the `rustfmt` and `clippy` components, to install those:\n\n```bash\nrustup component add rustfmt\nrustup component add clippy\n```\n\n### Building and testing\n\nTiKV includes a `Makefile` that has common workflows and sets up a standard build environment. You can also use `cargo`, as you would in many other Rust projects. It can help to run a command in the same environment as the Makefile: this can avoid re-compilations due to environment changes. This is done by prefixing a command with `scripts/env`, for example: `./scripts/env cargo build`\n\nYou can build TiKV:\n\n```bash\nmake build\n```\n\nDuring interactive development, you may prefer using `cargo check`, which will parse, borrow check, and lint your code, but not actually compile it:\n\n```bash\ncargo check --all\n```\n\nWhen you're ready to test out your changes, use the `dev` task. It will format your codebase, build with `clippy` enabled, and run tests. This should run without failure before you create a PR. Unfortunately, some tests will fail intermittently and others don't pass on all platforms. If you're unsure, just ask!\n\n```bash\nmake dev\n```\n\nYou can run the test suite alone, or just run a specific test:\n\n```bash\n# Run the full suite\nmake test\n# Run a specific test\n./scripts/test $TESTNAME -- --nocapture\n# Or using make\nenv EXTRA_CARGO_ARGS=$TESTNAME make test\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use [nextest](https://github.com/nextest-rs/nextest) to run tests:\n\n```bash\nenv EXTRA_CARGO_ARGS=$TESTNAME make test_with_nextest\n```\n\nTiKV follows the Rust community coding style. We use Rustfmt and [Clippy](https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-clippy) to automatically format and lint our code. Using these tools is checked in our CI. These are as part of `make dev`, you can also run them alone:\n\n```bash\n# Run Rustfmt\nmake format\n# Run Clippy (note that some lints are ignored, so `cargo clippy` will give many false positives)\nmake clippy\n```\n\nSee the [style doc](https://github.com/rust-lang/fmt-rfcs/blob/master/guide/guide.md) and the [API guidelines](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/api-guidelines/) for details on the conventions.\n\nPlease follow this style to make TiKV easy to review, maintain, and develop.\n\n### Run test in docker\n\nAlternatively, you can run test in a docker environment. Simply running the following command, it will build the pingcap/tikv_dev image and run the tikv unittests. And you may re-use the pingcap/tikv_dev image directly for ad-hoc test.\n\n```bash\nmake docker_test\n```\n\nNote that you may find many messages below, which in fact are not errors. They're emitted by rustc or cargo.\n\n```bash\n<jemalloc>: Invalid conf pair: prof:true\n```\n\n### Build issues\n\nTo reduce compilation time and disk usage, TiKV builds do not include full debugging information by default &mdash; only tests package will have line debug info enabled. To change debuginfo, just precede build commands with `RUSTFLAGS=-Cdebuginfo=1` (for line numbers), or `RUSTFLAGS=-Cdebuginfo=2` (for full debuginfo). For example,\n\n```bash\nRUSTFLAGS=-Cdebuginfo=1 make dev\nRUSTFLAGS=-Cdebuginfo=1 cargo build\n```\n\nWhen building with make, cargo will automatically use [pipelined][p] compilation to increase the parallelism of the build. To turn on pipelining while using cargo directly, set `CARGO_BUILD_PIPELINING=true`.\n\n[p]: https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/evaluating-pipelined-rustc-compilation/10199\n\n## Running TiKV\n\nTo run TiKV as an actual key-value store, you will need to run it as a cluster (a cluster can have just one node, which is useful for testing). You can do this on a single machine or on multiple machines. \n\nUse [PD](https://github.com/tikv/pd) to manage the cluster (even if just one node on a single machine). \n\nInstructions are in our [docs](https://tikv.org/docs/latest/deploy/install/test/#install-binary-manually) (if you build TiKV from source, you could skip `1. Download package` and `tikv-server` is in directory `/target`).\n\nTips: It's recommended to increase the open file limit above 82920. WSL2 users may refer to [the comment](https://github.com/Microsoft/WSL/issues/1688#issuecomment-532767317) if having difficulty in changing the `ulimit`.\n\n### Configuration\n\nRead our configuration guide to learn about various [configuration options](https://tikv.org/docs/latest/deploy/configure/introduction/). There is also a [configuration template](./etc/config-template.toml).\n\n## Contribution flow\n\nThis is a rough outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:\n\n- Make sure what you want to contribute is already traced as an issue (see below for linking issue).\n  * We may discuss the problem and solution in the issue.\n- Create a Git branch from where you want to base your work. This is usually master.\n- Write code, add test cases, and commit your work (see below for message format).\n- Run tests and make sure all tests pass.\n- Push your changes to a branch in your fork of the repository and submit a pull request.\n  * Make sure to mention the issue, which is created at step 1, in the commit message.\n- Your PR will be reviewed and may be requested some changes.\n  * Once you've made changes, your PR must be re-reviewed and approved.\n  * If the PR becomes out of date, you can use GitHub's 'update branch' button.\n  * If there are conflicts, you can merge and resolve them locally. Then push to your PR branch.\n    You do not need to get re-review just for resolving conflicts, but you should request re-review if there are significant changes.\n- Our CI system automatically tests all pull requests.\n- Our [bot](https://github.com/ti-chi-bot) will merge your PR. It can be summoned by commenting `/merge` (requires tests to pass and two approvals. You might have to ask your reviewer to do this).\n\nSee [Rustdoc of TiKV](https://tikv.github.io) for TiKV code documentation.\n\nThanks for your contributions!\n\n### Finding something to work on\n\nFor beginners, we have prepared many suitable tasks for you. Checkout our [Help Wanted issues](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Astatus%2Fhelp-wanted) for a list, in which we have also marked the difficulty level.\n\nIf you are planning something big, for example, relates to multiple components or changes current behaviors, make sure to open an issue to discuss with us before going on.\n\nThe TiKV team actively develops and maintains a bunch of dependencies used in TiKV, which you may be also interested in:\n\n- [rust-prometheus](https://github.com/tikv/rust-prometheus): The Prometheus client for Rust, our metrics collecting and reporting library\n- [rust-rocksdb](https://github.com/tikv/rust-rocksdb): Our RocksDB binding and wrapper for Rust\n- [raft-rs](https://github.com/tikv/raft-rs): The Raft distributed consensus algorithm implemented in Rust\n- [grpc-rs](https://github.com/tikv/grpc-rs): The gRPC library for Rust built on the gRPC C Core library and Rust Futures\n- [fail-rs](https://github.com/tikv/fail-rs): Fail points for Rust\n\nSee more in [TiKV Community](https://github.com/tikv/community).\n\n### Linking issues\n\nCode repositories in TiKV community require **ALL** the pull requests referring to its corresponding issues. In the pull request body, there **MUST** be one line starting with `Issue Number: ` and linking the relevant issues via the [keyword](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword), for example:\n\nIf the pull request resolves the relevant issues, and you want GitHub to close these issues automatically after it merged into the default branch, you can use the syntax (`KEYWORD #ISSUE-NUMBER`) like this:\n\n```\nIssue Number: close #123\n```\n\nIf the pull request links an issue but does not close it, you can use the keyword `ref` like this:\n\n```\nIssue Number: ref #456\n```\n\nMultiple issues should use full syntax for each issue and separate by a comma, like:\n\n```\nIssue Number: close #123, ref #456\n```\n\nFor pull requests trying to close issues in a different repository, contributors need to first create an issue in the same repository and use this issue to track.\n\nIf the pull request body does not provide the required content, the bot will add the `do-not-merge/needs-linked-issue` label to the pull request to prevent it from being merged.\n\n### Format of the commit message\n\nThe bot we use will extract the pull request title as the one-line subject and messages inside the `commit-message` code block as commit message body. For example, a pull request with title `pkg: what's changed in this one package` and body containing:\n\n    ```commit-message\n    any multiple line commit messages that go into\n    the final commit message body\n\n    * fix something 1\n    * fix something 2\n    ```\n\nwill get a final commit message:\n\n```\npkg: what's changed in this one package (#12345)\n\nany multiple line commit messages that go into\nthe final commit message body\n\n* fix something 1\n* fix something 2\n```\n\nThe first line is the subject (the pull request title) and should be no longer than 50 characters, the other lines should be wrapped at 72 characters (see [this blog post](https://preslav.me/2015/02/21/what-s-with-the-50-72-rule/) for why).\n\nIf the change affects more than one subsystem, you can use comma to separate them like `util/codec,util/types:`.\n\nIf the change affects many subsystems, you can use ```*``` instead, like ```*:```.\n\nThe body of the commit message should describe why the change was made and at a high level, how the code works.\n\n### Signing off the Commit\n\nThe project uses [DCO check](https://github.com/probot/dco#how-it-works) and the commit message must contain a `Signed-off-by` line for [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/).\n\nUse option `git commit -s` to sign off your commits. The bot will group and distinguish the signatures from all your commits in the pull request and append them to the final commit message body. \n\n\n### Testing AWS\n\nTesting AWS can be done without an AWS account by using [localstack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack).\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/localstack/localstack.git\ncd localstack\ndocker-compose up\n```\n\nFor example, to test KMS, create a key:\n\n```bash\npip install awscli-local\nawslocal kms create-key`\n```\n\nThen add then use the returned ID in key-id:\n\n```bash\n[security.encryption.master-key]\ntype = \"kms\"\nregion = \"us-west-2\"\nendpoint = \"http://localhost:4566\"\nkey-id = \"KMS key id\"\n```\n\nWhen you run TiKV, make sure to set the localstack credentials\n\n```bash\nexport AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=test\nexport AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=test\n```\n"

They're so important to the overall performance that any regression will directly impact user experience. We add a comment `#[PerformanceCriticalPath]` to highlight these critical files. Please note that this is the best-effort work and some files in critical path may not be marked. But if a file is marked,  please pay special attention when you change its code.\n\nHere're some typical mistakes that should be avoided in the `#[PerformanceCriticalPath]` files:\n\n* Unnecessary synchronous I/O. Here 'unnecessary' means it's not a MUST for serving the current user request. For example, on_gc_snap() in peers.rs should spin off its I/O related work to background thread.\n* Verbose logging with info or above log level.\n* Global lock.\n* Long tasks that do not have to be synchronous (Could be done in background thread instead).\n\nBelow is the performance map that would help you to understand how read/write requests are executed inside TiKV:\n\n![performance map](images/tikv_map.png)\n"

Unlike other traditional NoSQL systems, TiKV not only provides classical key-value APIs, but also transactional APIs with ACID compliance. Built in Rust and powered by Raft, TiKV was originally created by [PingCAP](https://en.pingcap.com) to complement [TiDB](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb), a distributed HTAP database compatible with the MySQL protocol.\n\nThe design of TiKV ('Ti' stands for titanium) is inspired by some great distributed systems from Google, such as BigTable, Spanner, and Percolator, and some of the latest achievements in academia in recent years, such as the Raft consensus algorithm.\n\nIf you're interested in contributing to TiKV, or want to build it from source, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n![cncf_logo](images/cncf.png#gh-light-mode-only)\n![cncf_logo](images/cncf-white.png#gh-dark-mode-only)\n\nTiKV is a graduated project of the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io/) (CNCF). If you are an organization that wants to help shape the evolution of technologies that are container-packaged, dynamically-scheduled and microservices-oriented, consider joining the CNCF. For details about who's involved and how TiKV plays a role, read the CNCF [announcement](https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2020/09/02/cloud-native-computing-foundation-announces-tikv-graduation/).\n\n---\n\nWith the implementation of the Raft consensus algorithm in Rust and consensus state stored in RocksDB, TiKV guarantees data consistency. [Placement Driver (PD)](https://github.com/pingcap/pd/), which is introduced to implement auto-sharding, enables automatic data migration. The transaction model is similar to Google's Percolator with some performance improvements. TiKV also provides snapshot isolation (SI), snapshot isolation with lock (SQL: `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`), and externally consistent reads and writes in distributed transactions.\n\nTiKV has the following key features:\n\n- **Geo-Replication**\n\n    TiKV uses [Raft](http://raft.github.io/) and the Placement Driver to support Geo-Replication.\n\n- **Horizontal scalability**\n\n    With PD and carefully designed Raft groups, TiKV excels in horizontal scalability and can easily scale to 100+ TBs of data.\n\n- **Consistent distributed transactions**\n\n    Similar to Google's Spanner, TiKV supports externally-consistent distributed transactions.\n\n- **Coprocessor support**\n\n    Similar to HBase, TiKV implements a coprocessor framework to support distributed computing.\n\n- **Cooperates with [TiDB](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb)**\n\n    Thanks to the internal optimization, TiKV and TiDB can work together to be a compelling database solution with high horizontal scalability, externally-consistent transactions, support for RDBMS, and NoSQL design patterns.\n\n## Governance\n\nSee [Governance](https://github.com/tikv/community/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md).\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor instructions on deployment, configuration, and maintenance of TiKV,see TiKV documentation on our [website](https://tikv.org/docs/4.0/tasks/introduction/). For more details on concepts and designs behind TiKV, see [Deep Dive TiKV](https://tikv.org/deep-dive/introduction/).\n\n> **Note:**\n>\n> We have migrated our documentation from the [TiKV's wiki page](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/wiki/) to the [official website](https://tikv.org/docs). The original Wiki page is discontinued. If you have any suggestions or issues regarding documentation, offer your feedback [here](https://github.com/tikv/website).\n\n## TiKV adopters\n\nYou can view the list of [TiKV Adopters](https://tikv.org/adopters/).\n\n## TiKV software stack\n\n![The TiKV software stack](images/tikv_stack.png)\n\n- **Placement Driver:** PD is the cluster manager of TiKV, which periodically checks replication constraints to balance load and data automatically.\n- **Store:** There is a RocksDB within each Store and it stores data into the local disk.\n- **Region:** Region is the basic unit of Key-Value data movement. Each Region is replicated to multiple Nodes. These multiple replicas form a Raft group.\n- **Node:** A physical node in the cluster. Within each node, there are one or more Stores. Within each Store, there are many Regions.\n\nWhen a node starts, the metadata of the Node, Store and Region are recorded into PD. The status of each Region and Store is reported to PD regularly.\n\n## Quick start\n\n### Deploy a playground with TiUP\n\nThe most quickest to try out TiKV with TiDB is using TiUP, a component manager for TiDB.\n\nYou can see [this page](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/quick-start-with-tidb#deploy-a-local-test-environment-using-tiup-playground) for a step by step tutorial.\n\n### Deploy a playground with binary\n\nTiKV is able to run separately with PD, which is the minimal deployment required.\n\n1. Download and extract binaries.\n\n```bash\n$ export TIKV_VERSION=v7.5.0\n$ export GOOS=darwin  # only {darwin, linux} are supported\n$ export GOARCH=amd64 # only {amd64, arm64} are supported\n$ curl -O  https://tiup-mirrors.pingcap.com/tikv-$TIKV_VERSION-$GOOS-$GOARCH.tar.gz\n$ curl -O  https://tiup-mirrors.pingcap.com/pd-$TIKV_VERSION-$GOOS-$GOARCH.tar.gz\n$ tar -xzf tikv-$TIKV_VERSION-$GOOS-$GOARCH.tar.gz\n$ tar -xzf pd-$TIKV_VERSION-$GOOS-$GOARCH.tar.gz\n```\n\n2. Start PD instance.\n\n```bash\n$ ./pd-server --name=pd --data-dir=/tmp/pd/data --client-urls=\"http://127.0.0.1:2379\" --peer-urls=\"http://127.0.0.1:2380\" --initial-cluster=\"pd=http://127.0.0.1:2380\" --log-file=/tmp/pd/log/pd.log\n```\n\n3. Start TiKV instance.\n\n```bash\n$ ./tikv-server --pd-endpoints=\"127.0.0.1:2379\" --addr=\"127.0.0.1:20160\" --data-dir=/tmp/tikv/data --log-file=/tmp/tikv/log/tikv.log\n```\n\n4. Install TiKV Client(Python) and verify the deployment, required Python 3.5+.\n\n```bash\n$ pip3 install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ tikv-client\n```\n\n```python\nfrom tikv_client import RawClient\n\nclient = RawClient.connect(\"127.0.0.1:2379\")\n\nclient.put(b'foo', b'bar')\nprint(client.get(b'foo')) # b'bar'\n\nclient.put(b'foo', b'baz')\nprint(client.get(b'foo')) # b'baz'\n```\n\n### Deploy a cluster with TiUP\n\nYou can see [this manual](./doc/deploy.md) of production-like cluster deployment presented by @c4pt0r.\n\n### Build from source\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Client drivers\n\n- [Go](https://github.com/tikv/client-go) (The most stable and widely used)\n- [Java](https://github.com/tikv/client-java)\n- [Rust](https://github.com/tikv/client-rust)\n- [C](https://github.com/tikv/client-c)\n\nIf you want to try the Go client, see [Go Client](https://tikv.org/docs/4.0/reference/clients/go/).\n\n## Security\n\n### Security audit\n\nA third-party security auditing was performed by Cure53.
