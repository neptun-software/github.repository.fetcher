This is for developers and users to have an easier time developing with Pingora in Unix-like environments like macOS (though some features might be missing)\n\nWindows support is preliminary by community's best effort only.\n\nBoth x86_64 and aarch64 architectures will be supported.\n\n## Rust version\n\nPingora keeps a rolling MSRV (minimum supported Rust version) policy of 6 months. This means we will accept PRs that upgrade the MSRV as long as the new Rust version used is at least 6 months old.\n\nOur current MSRV is 1.72.\n\n## Build Requirements\n\nSome of the crates in this repository have dependencies on additional tools and\nlibraries that must be satisfied in order to build them:\n\n* Make sure that [Clang] is installed on your system (for boringssl)\n* Make sure that [Perl 5] is installed on your system (for openssl)\n\n[Clang]:https://clang.llvm.org/\n[Perl 5]:https://www.perl.org/\n\n# Contributing\nPlease see our [contribution guidelines](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n# License\nThis project is Licensed under [Apache License, Version 2.0](./LICENSE).\n"
