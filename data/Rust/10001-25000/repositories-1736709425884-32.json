A type error in the middle of a pipeline\n  won't stop the compiler from figuring out the types of the remaining pieces,\n  enabling the language server to show better suggestions for incomplete pipes.\n  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))\n\n- Improved code generation for blocks in tail position on the Javascript target.\n  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))\n\n- Function documentation comments and module documentation comments are now\n  included in the generated Erlang code and can be browsed from the Erlang\n  shell starting from OTP27.\n  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))\n\n### Build tool\n\n- `gleam new` now has refined project name validation - rather than failing on\n  invalid project names, it suggests a valid alternative and prompts for\n  confirmation to use it.\n  ([Diemo Gebhardt](https://github.com/diemogebhardt))\n\n### Language server\n\n- The language server can now fill in the labels of any function call, even when\n  only some of the arguments are provided. For example:\n\n  ```gleam\n  import gleam/string\n\n  pub fn main() {\n    string.replace(\"wibble\")\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Will be completed to:\n\n  ```gleam\n  import gleam/string\n\n  pub fn main() {\n    string.replace(\"wibble\", each: todo, with: todo)\n  }\n  ```\n\n  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))\n\n- The language server now suggests a code action to pattern match on a\n  function's argument. For example:\n\n  ```gleam\n  pub type Pokemon {\n    Pokemon(pokedex_number: Int, name: String)\n  }\n\n  pub fn to_string(pokemon: Pokemon) {\n    //             ^ If you put your cursor over the argument\n    todo\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Triggering the code action on the `pokemon` argument will generate the\n  following code for you:\n\n  ```gleam\n  pub type Pokemon {\n    Pokemon(pokedex_number: Int, name: String)\n  }\n\n  pub fn to_string(pokemon: Pokemon) {\n    let Pokemon(pokedex_number:, name:) = pokemon\n    todo\n  }\n  ```\n\n  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))\n\n- The language server now suggests a code action to pattern match on a variable.\n  For example:\n\n  ```gleam\n  pub fn main() {\n    let result = list.first(a_list)\n    //  ^ If you put your cursor over the variable\n    todo\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Triggering the code action on the `result` variable will generate the\n  following code for you:\n\n  ```gleam\n  pub fn main() {\n    let result = list.first(a_list)\n    case result {\n      Ok(value) -> todo\n      Error(value) -> todo\n    }\n    todo\n  }\n  ```\n\n  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))\n\n### Formatter\n\n### Bug fixes\n\n- Fixed a bug where the \"convert from use\" code action would generate invalid\n  code for use expressions ending with a trailing comma.\n  ([Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri))\n\n- Fixed a bug where floats outside of Erlang's floating point range were not\n  causing errors.\n  ([shayan](https://github.com/massivefermion))\n\n- Fixed a bug where build tool could fail to add new dependencies when\n  dependencies with optional dependencies are present in the manifest.\n  ([Louis Pilfold](https://github.com/lpil))\n\n- Fixed a bug where a block expression containing a singular record update would\n  produce invalid erlang.\n  ([yoshi](https://github.com/joshi-monster))\n"

If you cannot\nfind an existing ticket for the bug please open a new one.\n\n[issues]: https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/issues\n\nA bug may be a technical problem such as a compiler crash or an incorrect\nreturn value from a library function, or a user experience issue such as\nunclear or absent documentation. If you are unsure if your problem is a bug\nplease open a ticket and we will work it out together.\n\n\n## Contributing code changes\n\nBefore working on code it is suggested that you read the\n[docs/compiler/README.md](docs/compiler/README.md) file.\nIt outlines fundamental components and design of this project.\n\nCode changes to Gleam are welcomed via the process below.\n\n1. Find or open a GitHub issue relevant to the change you wish to make and\n   comment saying that you wish to work on this issue. If the change\n   introduces new functionality or behaviour this would be a good time to\n   discuss the details of the change to ensure we are in agreement as to how\n   the new functionality should work.\n2. Open a GitHub pull request with your changes and ensure the tests and build\n   pass on CI.\n3. A Gleam team member will review the changes and may provide feedback to\n   work on. Depending on the change there may be multiple rounds of feedback.\n4. Once the changes have been approved the code will be rebased into the\n   `main` branch.\n\n## Local development\n\nTo run the compiler tests. This will require a recent stable version of Rust\nto be installed.\n\nIf you are using the Nix package manager, there's a [gleam-nix flake](https://github.com/vic/gleam-nix)\nyou can use for running any Gleam version or quickly obtaining a development environment for Gleam.\n\n```shell\ncargo test\n\n# Or if you have watchexec installed you can run them automatically\n# when files change\nmake test-watch\n```\n\nTo run the language integration tests. This will require a recent stable\nversion of Rust, Erlang, and NodeJS to be installed.\n\n```shell\nmake language-test\n```\n\nIf you don't have Rust or Cargo installed you can run the above command in a docker sandbox.\nRun the command below from this directory.\n\n```shell\ndocker run -v $(pwd):/opt/app -it -w /opt/app rust:latest bash\n```\n\n## Rust development\n\nHere are some tips and guidelines for writing Rust code in the Gleam compiler:\n\nThe `GLEAM_LOG` environment variable can be used to cause the compiler to\nprint more information for debugging and introspection. i.e.\n`GLEAM_LOG=trace`.\n\n### Clippy linter\n\nYour PR may fail on CI due to clippy errors. Clippy can be run locally like so:\n\n```shell\ncargo clean -p gleam\ncargo clippy\n```\n\nIf you have lint errors on CI but not locally upgrade your Rust version to the\nlatest stable.\n\n```shell\nrustup upgrade stable\n```\n\n## Cap'n Proto schema\n\nThe compiler uses a Cap'n Proto schema to serialize/deserialize module information.\nOccasionally, the schema needs to change. After modifying `compiler-core/schema.capnp`\nyou need to to re-generate `compiler-core/generated/schema_capnp.rs`. To do that,\n[install Cap'n Proto](https://capnproto.org/install.html) and un-comment appropriate lines\nin `compiler-core/build.rs`. Then you should be able to re-generate that file with:\n\n```shell\ncd compiler-core\ncargo build\n```\n"

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.
