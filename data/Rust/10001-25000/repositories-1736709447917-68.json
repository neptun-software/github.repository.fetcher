          "content": "# Thank you for contributing\n\nPlease feel free to open a pull request if you know of a static analysis tool that\nis not mentioned here.  \nIf you're in doubt if a tool is a good fit for the list, **don't open an issue,\nbut create a pull request right away** because that's easier to handle. Thanks!\n:smiley:\n\n### Requirements\n\nEach tool on the list should be\n\n- actively maintained (more than one contributor)\n- actively used (have **more than 20 stars on Github or similar impact**)\n- relatively mature (project exists for at least three months)\n\n### Format\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è **The main `README.md` is just a rendered version of the data. Do not edit it\nmanually.**\n\nTo add a new tool, please create a file in the `data/tools` directory like\n`data/tools/<toolname>.yml`. Feel free to check out a few other YAML files in\nthat directory to see how it should look like.\n\n- Make each tool description as precise as possible.  Please limit the\n  description to **500 characters**.\n- Add a license. If it's a proprietary tool, use `license: proprietary`.\n- Please add as many tags as possible. You can choose from the tags in\n  `data/tags.yml` If a tool does not match any existing tag, feel free to add a\n  new tag but also add it to `data/tags.yml`.\n\nFinally, create a pull request with all your changes. You can call `make\nrender` to check for errors before.  This is optional, because it will also be\ndone when creating a pull request.\n\n### How to mark a tool as unmaintained/deprecated\n\nSometimes a tool becomes unmaintained and there's nothing wrong with that.  \nAfter all, a tool can still be very valuable to the community - even without\nfrequent updates.  \nHowever, since it is one of the goals of this project to allow people to make an\ninformed decision on what is the best tool for the job, we are marking\nunmaintained or deprecated tools after a while.\n[Here](https://github.com/mre/awesome-static-analysis/issues/223) is a nice\ndiscussion about why we think this is necessary. If you find a tool, which is\nunmaintained, please add `deprecated: true` to the entry in `data/tools/` and\ncreate a pull request in which you provide an objective explanation as to why\nyou think the tool should be marked deprecated. Every deprecation will be\nhandled on a case-by-case basis.\n\n**Thanks for helping out!** :tada:\n"
