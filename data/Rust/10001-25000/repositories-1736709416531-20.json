It doesn't\nmatter if you are just getting started with Rust or are the most weathered\nexpert, we can use your help.\n\n**No contribution is too small and all contributions are valued.**\n\nThis guide will help you get started. **Do not let this guide intimidate you**.\nIt should be considered a map to help you navigate the process.\n\nDon't know where to start? Check [issues labeled with \"E-help-wanted\"](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AE-help-wanted) or [\"E-easy\"](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AE-easy).\n\nYou may also get help with contributing in the [`axum` Discord\nchannel][discord], please join us!\n\n[discord]: https://discord.gg/tokio\n\n## Conduct\n\nThe `axum` project adheres to the [Rust Code of Conduct][coc]. This\ndescribes the _minimum_ behavior expected from all contributors.\n\n[coc]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\n\n## Contributing in Issues\n\nFor any issue, there are fundamentally three ways an individual can contribute:\n\n1. By opening the issue for discussion: For instance, if you believe that you\n   have uncovered a bug in a `axum` crate, creating a new issue in the\n   tokio-rs/axum [issue tracker][issues] is the way to report it.\n\n2. By helping to triage the issue: This can be done by providing\n   supporting details (a test case that demonstrates a bug), providing\n   suggestions on how to address the issue, or ensuring that the issue is tagged\n   correctly.\n\n3. By helping to resolve the issue: Typically this is done either in the form of\n   demonstrating that the issue reported is not a problem after all, or more\n   often, by opening a Pull Request that changes some bit of something in\n   axum in a concrete and reviewable manner.\n\n**Anybody can participate in any stage of contribution**. We urge you to\nparticipate in the discussion around bugs and participate in reviewing PRs.\n\n[issues]: https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum/issues\n\n### Asking for General Help\n\nIf you have reviewed existing documentation and still have questions or are\nhaving problems, you can open an issue asking for help.\n\nIn exchange for receiving help, we ask that you contribute back a documentation\nPR that helps others avoid the problems that you encountered.\n\n### Submitting a Bug Report\n\nWhen opening a new issue in the `axum` issue tracker, users will\nbe presented with a [basic template][template] that should be filled in. If you\nbelieve that you have uncovered a bug, please fill out this form, following the\ntemplate to the best of your ability. Do not worry if you cannot answer every\ndetail, just fill in what you can.\n\nThe two most important pieces of information we need in order to properly\nevaluate the report is a description of the behavior you are seeing and a simple\ntest case we can use to recreate the problem on our own. If we cannot recreate\nthe issue, it becomes harder for us to fix.\n\nSee [How to create a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example][mcve].\n\n[mcve]: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\n[template]: .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md\n\n### Triaging a Bug Report\n\nOnce an issue has been opened, it is not uncommon for there to be discussion\naround it. Some contributors may have differing opinions about the issue,\nincluding whether the behavior being seen is a bug or a feature. This discussion\nis part of the process and should be kept focused, helpful, and professional.\n\nShort, clipped responses—that provide neither additional context nor supporting\ndetail—are not helpful or professional. To many, such responses are simply\nannoying and unfriendly.\n\nContributors are encouraged to help one another make forward progress as much as\npossible, empowering one another to solve issues collaboratively. If you choose\nto comment on an issue that you feel either is not a problem that needs to be\nfixed, or if you encounter information in an issue that you feel is incorrect,\nexplain why you feel that way with additional supporting context, and be willing\nto be convinced that you may be wrong. By doing so, we can often reach the\ncorrect outcome much faster.\n\n### Resolving a Bug Report\n\nIn the majority of cases, issues are resolved by opening a Pull Request. The\nprocess for opening and reviewing a Pull Request is similar to that of opening\nand triaging issues, but carries with it a necessary review and approval\nworkflow that ensures that the proposed changes meet the minimal quality.\n\n## Pull Requests\n\nPull Requests are the way concrete changes are made to the code, documentation,\nand dependencies in the `axum` repository.\n\nEven tiny pull requests (e.g., one character pull request fixing a typo in API\ndocumentation) are greatly appreciated. Before making a large change, it is\nusually a good idea to first open an issue describing the change to solicit\nfeedback and guidance. This will increase the likelihood of the PR getting\nmerged.\n\n### Tests\n\nIf the change being proposed alters code (as opposed to only documentation for\nexample), it is either adding new functionality to a crate or it is fixing\nexisting, broken functionality. In both of these cases, the pull request should\ninclude one or more tests to ensure that the crate does not regress in the future.\n\n#### Documentation tests\n\nIdeally, every API has at least one [documentation test] that demonstrates how to\nuse the API. Documentation tests are run with `cargo test --doc`. This ensures\nthat the example is correct and provides additional test coverage.\n\nThe trick to documentation tests is striking a balance between being succinct\nfor a reader to understand and actually testing the API.\n\nIn Rust documentation, lines that start with `/// #` are removed when the\ndocumentation is generated. They are only there to get the test to run.\n\n### Commits\n\nIt is a recommended best practice to keep your changes as logically grouped as\npossible within individual commits. There is no limit to the number of commits\nany single Pull Request may have, and many contributors find it easier to review\nchanges that are split across multiple commits.\n\nNote that multiple commits often get squashed when they are landed (see the\nnotes about [commit squashing]).\n\n#### Commit message guidelines\n\nA good commit message should describe what changed and why.\n\n1. The first line should:\n\n  * Contain a short description of the change (preferably 50 characters or less,\n    and no more than 72 characters)\n\n2. Keep the second line blank.\n3. Wrap all other lines at 72 columns (except for long URLs).\n4. If your patch fixes an open issue, you can add a reference to it at the end\n   of the log. Use the `Fixes: #` prefix and the issue number. For other\n   references use `Refs: #`. `Refs` may include multiple issues, separated by a\n   comma.\n\n   Examples:\n\n   - `Fixes: #1337`\n   - `Refs: #1234, #42`\n\n### Opening the Pull Request\n\nFrom within GitHub, opening a new Pull Request will present you with a\n[template] that should be filled out. Please try to do your best at filling out\nthe details, but feel free to skip parts if you're not sure what to put.\n\n[template]: .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md\n\n### Discuss and update\n\nYou will probably get feedback or requests for changes to your Pull Request.\nThis is a big part of the submission process so don't be discouraged! Some\ncontributors may sign off on the Pull Request right away, others may have\nmore detailed comments or feedback. This is a necessary part of the process\nin order to evaluate whether the changes are correct and necessary.\n\n**Any community member can review a PR and you might get conflicting feedback**.\nKeep an eye out for comments from code owners to provide guidance on conflicting\nfeedback.\n\n**Once the PR is open, do not rebase the commits**. See [Commit Squashing] for\nmore details.\n\n### Commit Squashing\n\nIn most cases, **do not squash commits that you add to your Pull Request during\nthe review process**. When the commits in your Pull Request land, they may be\nsquashed into one commit per logical change. Metadata will be added to the\ncommit message (including links to the Pull Request, links to relevant issues,\nand the names of the reviewers). The commit history of your Pull Request,\nhowever, will stay intact on the Pull Request page.\n\n## Reviewing Pull Requests\n\n**Any Tokio, Hyperium, and Tower, Axum community member is welcome to review any pull request**.\n\nAll contributors who choose to review and provide feedback on Pull Requests have\na responsibility to both the project and the individual making the contribution.\nReviews and feedback must be helpful, insightful, and geared towards improving\nthe contribution as opposed to simply blocking it. If there are reasons why you\nfeel the PR should not land, explain what those are. Do not expect to be able to\nblock a Pull Request from advancing simply because you say \"No\" without giving\nan explanation. Be open to having your mind changed. Be open to working with the\ncontributor to make the Pull Request better.\n\nReviews that are dismissive or disrespectful of the contributor or any other\nreviewers are strictly counter to the Code of Conduct.\n\nWhen reviewing a Pull Request, the primary goals are for the codebase to improve\nand for the person submitting the request to succeed. **Even if a Pull Request\ndoes not land, the submitters should come away from the experience feeling like\ntheir effort was not wasted or unappreciated**. Every Pull Request from a new\ncontributor is an opportunity to grow the community.\n\n### Review a bit at a time.\n\nDo not overwhelm new contributors.\n\nIt is tempting to micro-optimize and make everything about relative performance,\nperfect grammar, or exact style matches. Do not succumb to that temptation.\n\nFocus first on the most significant aspects of the change:\n\n1. Does this change make sense for axum?\n2. Does this change make axum better, even if only incrementally?\n3. Are there clear bugs or larger scale issues that need attending to?\n4. Is the commit message readable and correct? If it contains a breaking change\n   is it clear enough?\n\nNote that only **incremental** improvement is needed to land a PR. This means\nthat the PR does not need to be perfect, only better than the status quo. Follow\nup PRs may be opened to continue iterating.\n\nWhen changes are necessary, *request* them, do not *demand* them, and **do not\nassume that the submitter already knows how to add a test or run a benchmark**.\n\nSpecific performance optimization techniques, coding styles and conventions\nchange over time. The first impression you give to a new contributor never does.\n\nNits (requests for small changes that are not essential) are fine, but try to\navoid stalling the Pull Request. Most nits can typically be fixed by the Axum\nCollaborator landing the Pull Request but they can also be an opportunity for\nthe contributor to learn a bit more about the project.\n\nIt is always good to clearly indicate nits when you comment: e.g.\n`Nit: change foo() to bar(). But this is not blocking.`\n\nIf your comments were addressed but were not folded automatically after new\ncommits or if they proved to be mistaken, please, [hide them][hiding-a-comment]\nwith the appropriate reason to keep the conversation flow concise and relevant.\n\n### Be aware of the person behind the code\n\nBe aware that *how* you communicate requests and reviews in your feedback can\nhave a significant impact on the success of the Pull Request. Yes, we may land a\nparticular change that makes `axum` better, but the individual might just\nnot want to have anything to do with `axum` ever again. The goal is not\njust having good code.\n\n### Abandoned or Stalled Pull Requests\n\nIf a Pull Request appears to be abandoned or stalled, it is polite to first\ncheck with the contributor to see if they intend to continue the work before\nchecking if they would mind if you took it over (especially if it just has nits\nleft). When doing so, it is courteous to give the original contributor credit\nfor the work they started, either by preserving their name and email address in\nthe commit log, or by using an `Author: ` meta-data tag in the commit.\n\n[hiding-a-comment]: https://help.github.com/articles/managing-disruptive-comments/#hiding-a-comment\n[documentation test]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/documentation-tests.html\n[keep-a-changelog]: https://github.com/olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\n"
