It can be used for a variety of things, including but not limited to:\n\n- Compiling, deploying, and testing [Sway](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway) contracts;\n- Launching a local Fuel network;\n- Crafting and signing transactions with hand-crafted scripts or contract calls;\n- Generating type-safe Rust bindings of contract methods;\n- And more, `fuels-rs` is still in active development.\n\n## Documentation\n\nSee [the `fuels-rs` book](https://fuellabs.github.io/fuels-rs/latest/)\n\n## Features\n\n- [x] Launch Fuel nodes\n- [x] Deploy contracts\n- [x] Interact with deployed contracts\n- [x] Type-safe Sway contracts bindings code generation\n- [x] Run Sway scripts\n- [x] CLI for common operations\n- [x] Local test wallets\n- [ ] Wallet integration\n- [ ] Events querying/monitoring\n\n## FAQ\n\n### What dependencies do I need?\n\n- [The latest `stable` Rust toolchain](https://docs.fuel.network/guides/installation/#installing-rust);\n- [`forc` and `fuel-core` binaries](https://docs.fuel.network/guides/installation/#installing-the-fuel-toolchain-using-fuelup).\n\n### How can I run the SDK tests?\n\nFirst, build the test projects using `forc`:\n\n```shell\nforc build --release --path e2e\n```\n\nThen you can run the SDK tests with:\n\n```shell\ncargo test\n```\n\nYou can also run specific tests. The following example will run all integration tests in `types.rs` whose names contain `in_vector` and show their outputs:\n\n```shell\ncargo test --test types in_vector -- --show-output\n```\n\n### How to run WASM tests?\n\nYou need to have wasm32 as a target, if you don't already:\n\n```shell\n rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown\n```\n\nYou also need `wasm-pack`, if you don't already:\n\n```shell\ncargo install wasm-pack\n```\n\nNavigate to `packages/wasm-tests` and run `wasm-pack test`.\n\n### What to do if my tests are failing on `master`\n\nBefore doing anything else, try all these commands:\n\n```shell\ncargo clean\nrm Cargo.lock\nforc build --release --path e2e\ncargo test\n```\n\n### Why is the prefix `fuels` and not `fuel`?\n\nIn order to make the SDK for Fuel feel familiar with those coming from the [ethers.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js) ecosystem, this project opted for an `s` at the end. The `fuels-*` family of SDKs is inspired by The Ethers Project.\n\n### How can I run the docs locally?\n\nInstall `mdbook` by running:\n\n```shell\ncargo install mdbook\n```\n\nNext, navigate to the `docs` folder and run the command below to start a local server and open a new tab in your browser.\n\n```shell\nmdbook serve --open\n```\n\nYou can build the book by running:\n\n```shell\nmdbook build\n```\n"
