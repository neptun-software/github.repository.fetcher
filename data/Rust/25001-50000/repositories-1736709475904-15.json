You want to make some change to Nushell that is more involved than simple bug-fixing.\n2. Go to [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/NtAbbGn) or a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/issues/new/choose) and chat with some core team members and/or other contributors about it.\n3. After getting a green light from the core team, implement the feature, open a pull request (PR) and write a concise but comprehensive description of the change.\n4. If your PR includes any use-facing features (such as adding a flag to a command), clearly list them in the PR description.\n5. Then, core team members and other regular contributors will review the PR and suggest changes.\n6. When we all agree, the PR will be merged.\n7. If your PR includes any user-facing features, make sure the changes are also reflected in [the documentation](https://github.com/nushell/nushell.github.io) after the PR is merged.\n8. Congratulate yourself, you just improved Nushell! :-)\n\n## Developing\n\n### Setup\n\nNushell requires a recent Rust toolchain and some dependencies; [refer to the Nu Book for up-to-date requirements](https://www.nushell.sh/book/installation.html#build-from-source). After installing dependencies, you should be able to clone+build Nu like any other Rust project:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/nushell/nushell\ncd nushell\ncargo build\n```\n\n### Tests\n\nIt is good practice to cover your changes with a test. Also, try to think about corner cases and various ways how your changes could break. Cover those in the tests as well.\n\nTests can be found in different places:\n* `/tests`\n* command examples\n* crate-specific tests\n\nMost of the tests are built upon the `nu-test-support` crate. For testing specific features, such as running Nushell in a REPL mode, we have so called \"testbins\". For simple tests, you can find `run_test()` and `fail_test()` functions.\n\n### Useful Commands\n\nAs Nushell is built using a cargo workspace consisting of multiple crates keep in mind that you may need to pass additional flags compared to how you may be used to it from a single crate project.\nRead cargo's documentation for more details: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/workspaces.html\n\n- Build and run Nushell:\n\n  ```nushell\n  cargo run\n  ```\n\n- Run Clippy on Nushell:\n\n  ```nushell\n  cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings -D clippy::unwrap_used\n  ```\n  or via the `toolkit.nu` command:\n  ```nushell\n  use toolkit.nu clippy\n  clippy\n  ```\n\n- Run all tests:\n\n  ```nushell\n  cargo test --workspace\n  ```\n\n  or via the `toolkit.nu` command:\n  ```nushell\n  use toolkit.nu test\n  test\n  ```\n\n- Run all tests for a specific command\n\n  ```nushell\n  cargo test --package nu-cli --test main -- commands::<command_name_here>\n  ```\n\n- Check to see if there are code formatting issues\n\n  ```nushell\n  cargo fmt --all -- --check\n  ```\n  or via the `toolkit.nu` command:\n  ```nushell\n  use toolkit.nu fmt\n  fmt --check\n  ```\n\n- Format the code in the project\n\n  ```nushell\n  cargo fmt --all\n  ```\n  or via the `toolkit.nu` command:\n  ```nushell\n  use toolkit.nu fmt\n  fmt\n  ```\n\n- Set up `git` hooks to check formatting and run `clippy` before committing and pushing:\n\n  ```nushell\n  use toolkit.nu setup-git-hooks\n  setup-git-hooks\n  ```\n  _Unfortunately, this hook isn't available on Windows._\n\n### Debugging Tips\n\n- To view verbose logs when developing, enable the `trace` log level.\n\n  ```nushell\n  cargo run --release -- --log-level trace\n  ```\n\n- To redirect trace logs to a file, enable the `--log-target file` switch.\n  ```nushell\n  cargo run --release -- --log-level trace --log-target file\n  open $\"($nu.temp-path)/nu-($nu.pid).log\"\n  ```\n\n## Git etiquette\n\nAs nushell thrives on its broad base of volunteer contributors and maintainers with different backgrounds we have a few guidelines for how we best utilize git and GitHub for our contributions. We strive to balance three goals with those recommendations:\n\n1. The **volunteer maintainers and contributors** can easily follow the changes you propose, gauge the impact, and come to help you or make a decision.\n2. **You as a contributor** can focus most of your time on improving the quality of the nushell project and contributing your expertise to the code or documentation.\n3. Making sure we can trace back *why* decisions were made in the past.\nThis includes discarded approaches. Also we want to quickly identify regressions and fix when something broke.\n\n### How we merge PRs\n\nIn general the maintainers **squash** all changes of your PR into a single commit when merging.\n\nThis keeps a clean enough linear history, while not forcing you to conform to a too strict style while iterating in your PR or fixing small problems. As an added benefit the commits on the `main` branch are tied to the discussion that happened in the PR through their `#1234` issue number.\n\n> **Note**\n> **Pro advice:** In some circumstances, we can agree on rebase-merging a particularly large but connected PR as a series of atomic commits onto the `main` branch to ensure we can more easily revert or bisect particular aspects.\n\n### A good PR makes a change!\n\nAs a result of this PR-centric strategy and the general goal that the reviewers should easily understand your change, the **PR title and description matters** a great deal!\n\nMake sure your description is **concise** but contains all relevant information and context.\nThis means demonstrating what changes, ideally through nushell code or output **examples**.\nFurthermore links to technical documentation or instructions for folks that want to play with your change make the review process much easier.\n\n> **Note**\n> Try to follow the suggestions in our PR message template to make sure we can quickly focus on the technical merits and impact on the users.\n\n#### A PR should limit itself to a single functional change or related set of same changes.\n\nMixing different changes in the same PR will make the review process much harder. A PR might get stuck on one aspect while we would actually like to land another change. Furthermore, if we are forced to revert a change, mixing and matching different aspects makes fixing bugs or regressions much harder.\n\nThus, please try to **separate out unrelated changes**!\n**Don't** mix unrelated refactors with a potentially contested change.\nStylistic fixes and housekeeping can be bundled up into singular PRs.\n\n#### Guidelines for the PR title\n\nThe PR title should be concise but contain everything for a contributor to know if they should help out in the review of this particular change.\n\n**DON'T**\n- `Update file/in/some/deeply/nested/path.rs`\n  - Why are you making this change?\n- `Fix 2134`\n  - What has to be fixed?\n  - Hard to follow when not online on GitHub.\n- ``Ignore `~` expansion``\n  - In what context should this change take effect?\n- `[feature] refactor the whole parser and also make nushell indentation-sensitive, upgrade to using Cpython. Let me know what you think!`\n  - Be concise\n  - Maybe break up into smaller commits or PRs if the title already appears too long?\n\n**DO**\n- Mention the nushell feature or command that is affected.\n  - ``Fix URL parsing in `http get` (issue #1234)``\n- You can mention the issue number if other context is there.\n  - In general, mention all related issues in the description to crosslink (e.g. `Fixes #1234`, `Closes #6789`)\n- For internal changes mention the area or symbols affected if it helps to clarify\n  - ``Factor out `quote_string()` from parser to reuse in `explore` ``\n\n### Review process / Merge conflicts\n\n> **Note**\n> Keep in mind that the maintainers are volunteers that need to allocate their attention to several different areas and active PRs. We will try to get back to you as soon as possible.\n\nYou can help us to make the review process a smooth experience:\n- Testing:\n  - We generally review in detail after all the tests pass. Let us know if there is a problem you want to discuss to fix a test failure or forces us to accept a breaking change.\n  - If you fix a bug, it is highly recommended that you add a test that reproduces the original issue/panic in a minimal form.\n  - In general, added tests help us to understand which assumptions go into a particular addition/change.\n  - Try to also test corner cases where those assumptions might break. This can be more valuable than simply adding many similar tests.\n- Commit history inside a PR during code review:\n  - Good **atomic commits** can help follow larger changes, but we are not pedantic.\n  - We don't shame fixup commits while you try to figure out a problem. They can help others see what you tried and what didn't work. (see our [squash policy](#how-we-merge-prs))\n  - During active review constant **force pushing** just to amend changes can be confusing!\n    - GitHub's UI presents reviewers with less options to compare diffs\n    - fetched branches for experimentation become invalid!\n    - the notification a maintainer receives has a low signal-to-noise ratio\n  - Git pros *can* use their judgement to rebase/squash to clean up the history *if it aids the understanding* of a larger change during review\n- Merge conflicts:\n  - In general you should take care of resolving merge conflicts.\n    - Use your judgement whether to `git merge main` or to `git rebase main`\n    - Choose what simplifies having confidence in the conflict resolution and the review. **Merge commits in your branch are OK** in the squash model.\n  - Feel free to notify your reviewers or affected PR authors if your change might cause larger conflicts with another change.\n  - During the rollup of multiple PRs, we may choose to resolve merge conflicts and CI failures ourselves. (Allow maintainers to push to your branch to enable us to do this quickly.)\n\n## License\n\nWe use the [MIT License](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/blob/main/LICENSE) in all of our Nushell projects.

Many people use it as their daily driver, but it may be unstable for some commands. Nu's design is subject to change as it matures.\n\n## Learning About Nu\n\nThe [Nushell book](https://www.nushell.sh/book/) is the primary source of Nushell documentation. You can find [a full list of Nu commands in the book](https://www.nushell.sh/commands/), and we have many examples of using Nu in our [cookbook](https://www.nushell.sh/cookbook/).\n\nWe're also active on [Discord](https://discord.gg/NtAbbGn) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nu_shell); come and chat with us!\n\n## Installation\n\nTo quickly install Nu:\n\n```bash\n# Linux and macOS\nbrew install nushell\n# Windows\nwinget install nushell\n```\n\nTo use `Nu` in GitHub Action, check [setup-nu](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-nu) for more detail.\n\nDetailed installation instructions can be found in the [installation chapter of the book](https://www.nushell.sh/book/installation.html). Nu is available via many package managers:\n\n[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/nushell.svg?columns=3)](https://repology.org/project/nushell/versions)\n\nFor details about which platforms the Nushell team actively supports, see [our platform support policy](devdocs/PLATFORM_SUPPORT.md).\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe default configurations can be found at [sample_config](crates/nu-utils/src/default_files)\nwhich are the configuration files one gets when they startup Nushell for the first time.\n\nIt sets all of the default configuration to run Nushell.  From here one can\nthen customize this file for their specific needs.\n\nTo see where *config.nu* is located on your system simply type this command.\n\n```rust\n$nu.config-path\n```\n\nPlease see our [book](https://www.nushell.sh) for all of the Nushell documentation.\n\n\n## Philosophy\n\nNu draws inspiration from projects like PowerShell, functional programming languages, and modern CLI tools.\nRather than thinking of files and data as raw streams of text, Nu looks at each input as something with structure.\nFor example, when you list the contents of a directory what you get back is a table of rows, where each row represents an item in that directory.\nThese values can be piped through a series of steps, in a series of commands called a 'pipeline'.\n\n### Pipelines\n\nIn Unix, it's common to pipe between commands to split up a sophisticated command over multiple steps.\nNu takes this a step further and builds heavily on the idea of _pipelines_.\nAs in the Unix philosophy, Nu allows commands to output to stdout and read from stdin.\nAdditionally, commands can output structured data (you can think of this as a third kind of stream).\nCommands that work in the pipeline fit into one of three categories:\n\n-   Commands that produce a stream (e.g., `ls`)\n-   Commands that filter a stream (e.g., `where type == \"dir\"`)\n-   Commands that consume the output of the pipeline (e.g., `table`)\n\nCommands are separated by the pipe symbol (`|`) to denote a pipeline flowing left to right.\n\n```shell\nls | where type == \"dir\" | table\n# => ╭────┬──────────┬──────┬─────────┬───────────────╮\n# => │ #  │   name   │ type │  size   │   modified    │\n# => ├────┼──────────┼──────┼─────────┼───────────────┤\n# => │  0 │ .cargo   │ dir  │     0 B │ 9 minutes ago │\n# => │  1 │ assets   │ dir  │     0 B │ 2 weeks ago   │\n# => │  2 │ crates   │ dir  │ 4.0 KiB │ 2 weeks ago   │\n# => │  3 │ docker   │ dir  │     0 B │ 2 weeks ago   │\n# => │  4 │ docs     │ dir  │     0 B │ 2 weeks ago   │\n# => │  5 │ images   │ dir  │     0 B │ 2 weeks ago   │\n# => │  6 │ pkg_mgrs │ dir  │     0 B │ 2 weeks ago   │\n# => │  7 │ samples  │ dir  │     0 B │ 2 weeks ago   │\n# => │  8 │ src      │ dir  │ 4.0 KiB │ 2 weeks ago   │\n# => │  9 │ target   │ dir  │     0 B │ a day ago     │\n# => │ 10 │ tests    │ dir  │ 4.0 KiB │ 2 weeks ago   │\n# => │ 11 │ wix      │ dir  │     0 B │ 2 weeks ago   │\n# => ╰────┴──────────┴──────┴─────────┴───────────────╯\n```\n\nBecause most of the time you'll want to see the output of a pipeline, `table` is assumed.\nWe could have also written the above:\n\n```shell\nls | where type == \"dir\"\n```\n\nBeing able to use the same commands and compose them differently is an important philosophy in Nu.\nFor example, we could use the built-in `ps` command to get a list of the running processes, using the same `where` as above.\n\n```shell\nps | where cpu > 0\n# => ╭───┬───────┬───────────┬───────┬───────────┬───────────╮\n# => │ # │  pid  │   name    │  cpu  │    mem    │  virtual  │\n# => ├───┼───────┼───────────┼───────┼───────────┼───────────┤\n# => │ 0 │  2240 │ Slack.exe │ 16.40 │ 178.3 MiB │ 232.6 MiB │\n# => │ 1 │ 16948 │ Slack.exe │ 16.32 │ 205.0 MiB │ 197.9 MiB │\n# => │ 2 │ 17700 │ nu.exe    │  3.77 │  26.1 MiB │   8.8 MiB │\n# => ╰───┴───────┴───────────┴───────┴───────────┴───────────╯\n```\n\n### Opening files\n\nNu can load file and URL contents as raw text or structured data (if it recognizes the format).\nFor example, you can load a .toml file as structured data and explore it:\n\n```shell\nopen Cargo.toml\n# => ╭──────────────────┬────────────────────╮\n# => │ bin              │ [table 1 row]      │\n# => │ dependencies     │ {record 25 fields} │\n# => │ dev-dependencies │ {record 8 fields}  │\n# => │ features         │ {record 10 fields} │\n# => │ package          │ {record 13 fields} │\n# => │ patch            │ {record 1 field}   │\n# => │ profile          │ {record 3 fields}  │\n# => │ target           │ {record 3 fields}  │\n# => │ workspace        │ {record 1 field}   │\n# => ╰──────────────────┴────────────────────╯\n```\n\nWe can pipe this into a command that gets the contents of one of the columns:\n\n```shell\nopen Cargo.toml | get package\n# => ╭───────────────┬────────────────────────────────────╮\n# => │ authors       │ [list 1 item]                      │\n# => │ default-run   │ nu                                 │\n# => │ description   │ A new type of shell                │\n# => │ documentation │ https://www.nushell.sh/book/       │\n# => │ edition       │ 2018                               │\n# => │ exclude       │ [list 1 item]                      │\n# => │ homepage      │ https://www.nushell.sh             │\n# => │ license       │ MIT                                │\n# => │ metadata      │ {record 1 field}                   │\n# => │ name          │ nu                                 │\n# => │ repository    │ https://github.com/nushell/nushell │\n# => │ rust-version  │ 1.60                               │\n# => │ version       │ 0.72.0                             │\n# => ╰───────────────┴────────────────────────────────────╯\n```\n\nAnd if needed we can drill down further:\n\n```shell\nopen Cargo.toml | get package.version\n# => 0.72.0\n```\n\n### Plugins\n\nNu supports plugins that offer additional functionality to the shell and follow the same structured data model that built-in commands use. There are a few examples in the `crates/nu_plugins_*` directories.\n\nPlugins are binaries that are available in your path and follow a `nu_plugin_*` naming convention.\nThese binaries interact with nu via a simple JSON-RPC protocol where the command identifies itself and passes along its configuration, making it available for use.\nIf the plugin is a filter, data streams to it one element at a time, and it can stream data back in return via stdin/stdout.\nIf the plugin is a sink, it is given the full vector of final data and is given free reign over stdin/stdout to use as it pleases.\n\nThe [awesome-nu repo](https://github.com/nushell/awesome-nu#plugins) lists a variety of nu-plugins while the [showcase repo](https://github.com/nushell/showcase) *shows* off informative blog posts that have been written about Nushell along with videos that highlight technical\ntopics that have been presented.\n\n## Goals\n\nNu adheres closely to a set of goals that make up its design philosophy. As features are added, they are checked against these goals.\n\n-   First and foremost, Nu is cross-platform. Commands and techniques should work across platforms and Nu has [first-class support for Windows, macOS, and Linux](devdocs/PLATFORM_SUPPORT.md).\n\n-   Nu ensures compatibility with existing platform-specific executables.\n\n-   Nu's workflow and tools should have the usability expected of modern software in 2022 (and beyond).\n\n-   Nu views data as either structured or unstructured. It is a structured shell like PowerShell.\n\n-   Finally, Nu views data functionally. Rather than using mutation, pipelines act as a means to load, change, and save data without mutable state.\n\n## Officially Supported By\n\nPlease submit an issue or PR to be added to this list.\n\n-   [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide)\n-   [starship](https://github.com/starship/starship)\n-   [oh-my-posh](https://ohmyposh.dev)\n-   [Couchbase Shell](https://couchbase.sh)\n-   [virtualenv](https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv)\n-   [atuin](https://github.com/ellie/atuin)\n-   [clap](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/tree/master/clap_complete_nushell)\n-   [Dorothy](http://github.com/bevry/dorothy)\n-   [Direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv/blob/master/docs/hook.md#nushell)\n-   [x-cmd](https://x-cmd.com/mod/nu)\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

          "content": "# Security Policy\n\nAs a shell and programming language Nushell provides you with great powers and the potential to do dangerous things to your computer and data. Whenever there is a risk that a malicious actor can abuse a bug or a violation of documented behavior/assumptions in Nushell to harm you this is a *security* risk. \nWe want to fix those issues without exposing our users to unnecessary risk. Thus we want to explain our security policy.\nAdditional issues may be part of *safety* where the behavior of Nushell as designed and implemented can cause unintended harm or a bug causes damage without the involvement of a third party.\n\n## Supported Versions\n\nAs Nushell is still under very active pre-stable development, the only version the core team prioritizes for security and safety fixes is the [most recent version as published on GitHub](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/latest).\nOnly if you provide a strong reasoning and the necessary resources, will we consider blessing a backported fix with an official patch release for a previous version.\n\n## Reporting a Vulnerability\n\nIf you suspect that a bug or behavior of Nushell can affect security or may be potentially exploitable, please report the issue to us in private. \nEither reach out to the core team on [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/NtAbbGn) to arrange a private channel or use the [GitHub vulnerability reporting form](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/security/advisories/new).\nPlease try to answer the following questions:\n- How can we reach you for further questions?\n- What is the bug? Which system of Nushell may be affected?\n- Do you have proof-of-concept for a potential exploit or have you observed an exploit in the wild?\n- What is your assessment of the severity based on what could be impacted should the bug be exploited?\n- Are additional people aware of the issue or deserve credit for identifying the issue?\n\nWe will try to get back to you within a week with:\n- acknowledging the receipt of the report\n- an initial plan of how we want to address this including the primary points of contact for further communication\n- our preliminary assessment of how severe we judge the issue\n- a proposal for how we can coordinate responsible disclosure (e.g. how we ship the bugfix, if we need to coordinate with distribution maintainers, when you can release a blog post if you want to etc.)\n\nFor purely *safety* related issues where the impact is severe by direct user action instead of malicious input or third parties, feel free to open a regular issue. If we deem that there may be an additional *security* risk on a *safety* issue we may continue discussions in a restricted forum.\n"
