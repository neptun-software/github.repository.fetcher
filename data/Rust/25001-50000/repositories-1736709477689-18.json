          "content": "# Contributing\n\nThank you for thinking of contributing! We very much welcome contributions from the community.\nTo make the process easier and more valuable for everyone involved we have a few rules and guidelines to follow.\n\nAnyone with a Github account is free to file issues on the project.\nHowever, if you want to contribute documentation or code then you will need to sign InfluxData's Individual Contributor License Agreement (CLA), which can be found with more information [on our website].\n\n[on our website]: https://www.influxdata.com/legal/cla/\n\n## Submitting Issues and Feature Requests\n\nBefore you file an [issue], please search existing issues in case the same or similar issues have already been filed.\nIf you find an existing open ticket covering your issue then please avoid adding \"👍\" or \"me too\" comments; Github notifications can cause a lot of noise for the project maintainers who triage the back-log.\nHowever, if you have a new piece of information for an existing ticket and you think it may help the investigation or resolution, then please do add it as a comment!\nYou can signal to the team that you're experiencing an existing issue with one of Github's emoji reactions (these are a good way to add \"weight\" to an issue from a prioritisation perspective).\n\n### Submitting an Issue\n\nThe [New Issue] page has templates for both bug reports and feature requests.\nPlease fill one of them out!\nThe issue templates provide details on what information we will find useful to help us fix an issue.\nIn short though, the more information you can provide us about your environment and what behaviour you're seeing, the easier we can fix the issue.\nIf you can push a PR with test cases that trigger a defect or bug, even better!\nP.S, if you have never written a bug report before, or if you want to brush up on your bug reporting skills, we recommend reading Simon Tatham's essay [How to Report Bugs Effectively].\n\nAs well as bug reports we also welcome feature requests (there is a dedicated issue template for these).\nTypically, the maintainers will periodically review community feature requests and make decisions about if we want to add them.\nFor features we don't plan to support we will close the feature request ticket (so, again, please check closed tickets for feature requests before submitting them).\n\n[issue]: https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/issues/new\n[New Issue]: https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/issues/new\n[How to Report Bugs Effectively]: https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html\n\n## Contributing Changes\n\nInfluxDB 3 is written mostly in idiomatic Rust—please see the [Style Guide] for more details.\nAll code must adhere to the `rustfmt` format, and pass all of the `clippy` checks we run in CI (there are more details further down this README).\n\n[Style Guide]: docs/style_guide.md\n\n### Finding Issues To Work On\n\nThe [good first issue](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Agood-first-issue) and the [help wanted](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted) labels are used to identify issues where we encourage community contributions.\nThey both indicate issues for which we would welcome independent community contributions, but the former indicates a sub-set of these that are especially good for first-time contributors.\nIf you want some clarifications or guidance for working on one of these issues, or you simply want to let others know that you're working on one, please leave a comment on the ticket.\n\n[good first issue]: https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Agood-first-issue\n[help wanted]: https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted\n\n### Bigger Changes\n\nIf you're planning to submit significant changes, even if it relates to existing tickets **please** talk to the project maintainers first!\nThe easiest way to do this is to open up a new ticket, describing the changes you plan to make and *why* you plan to make them. Changes that may seem obviously good to you, are not always obvious to everyone else.\nExample of changes where we would encourage up-front communication:\n\n* new InfluxDB 3 features;\n* significant refactors that move code between modules/crates etc;\n* performance improvements involving new concurrency patterns or the use of `unsafe` code;\n* API-breaking changes, or changes that require a data migration;\n* any changes that risk the durability or correctness of data.\n\nWe are always excited to have community involvement but we can't accept everything.\nTo avoid having your hard work rejected the best approach to start a discussion first.\nFurther, please don't expect us to accept significant changes without new test coverage, and/or in the case of performance changes benchmarks that show the improvements.\n\n### Making a PR\n\nTo open a PR you will need to have a Github account.\nFork the `influxdb` repo and work on a branch on your fork.\nWhen you have completed your changes, or you want some incremental feedback make a Pull Request to InfluxDB [here].\n\nIf you want to discuss some work in progress then please prefix `[WIP]` to the\nPR title.\n\nFor PRs that you consider ready for review, verify the following locally before you submit it:\n\n* you have a coherent set of logical commits, with messages conforming to the [Conventional Commits] specification;\n* all the tests and/or benchmarks pass, including documentation tests;\n* the code is correctly formatted and all `clippy` checks pass; and\n* you haven't left any \"code cruft\" (commented out code blocks etc).\n\nThere are some tips on verifying the above in the [next section](#running-tests).\n\n**After** submitting a PR, you should:\n\n* verify that all CI status checks pass and the PR is 💚;\n* ask for help on the PR if any of the status checks are 🔴, and you don't know why;\n* wait patiently for one of the team to review your PR, which could take a few days.\n\n[here]: https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/compare\n[Conventional Commits]: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\n\n## Running Tests\n\nThe `cargo` build tool runs tests as well. Run:\n\n```shell\ncargo test --workspace\n```\n\n### Enabling logging in tests\n\nTo enable logging to stderr during a run of `cargo test` set the Rust\n`RUST_LOG` environment variable. For example, to see all INFO messages:\n\n```shell\nRUST_LOG=info cargo test --workspace\n```\n\nSince this feature uses\n[`EnvFilter`](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/0.2.15/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html) internally, you\ncan use all the features of that crate. For example, to disable the\n(somewhat noisy) logs in some h2 modules, you can use a value of\n`RUST_LOG` such as:\n\n```shell\nRUST_LOG=debug,hyper::proto::h1=info,h2=info cargo test --workspace\n```\n\nSee [logging.md](docs/logging.md) for more information on logging.\n\n### End-to-End Tests\n\nThere are end-to-end tests that spin up a server and make requests via the client library and API. They can be found in `tests/end_to_end_cases`\n\nThese require additional setup as described in [testing.md](docs/testing.md).\n\n### Visually showing explain plans\n\nSome query plans are output in the log in [graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) format. To display them you can use the `tools/iplan` helper.\n\nFor example, if you want to display this plan:\n\n```\n// Begin DataFusion GraphViz Plan (see https://graphviz.org)\ndigraph {\n  subgraph cluster_1\n  {\n    graph[label=\"LogicalPlan\"]\n    2[shape=box label=\"SchemaPivot\"]\n    3[shape=box label=\"Projection: \"]\n    2 -> 3 [arrowhead=none, arrowtail=normal, dir=back]\n    4[shape=box label=\"Filter: Int64(0) LtEq #time And #time Lt Int64(10000) And #host Eq Utf8(_server01_)\"]\n    3 -> 4 [arrowhead=none, arrowtail=normal, dir=back]\n    5[shape=box label=\"TableScan: attributes projection=None\"]\n    4 -> 5 [arrowhead=none, arrowtail=normal, dir=back]\n  }\n  subgraph cluster_6\n  {\n    graph[label=\"Detailed LogicalPlan\"]\n    7[shape=box label=\"SchemaPivot\\nSchema: [non_null_column:Utf8]\"]\n    8[shape=box label=\"Projection: \\nSchema: []\"]\n    7 -> 8 [arrowhead=none, arrowtail=normal, dir=back]\n    9[shape=box label=\"Filter: Int64(0) LtEq #time And #time Lt Int64(10000) And #host Eq Utf8(_server01_)\\nSchema: [color:Utf8;N, time:Int64]\"]\n    8 -> 9 [arrowhead=none, arrowtail=normal, dir=back]\n    10[shape=box label=\"TableScan: attributes projection=None\\nSchema: [color:Utf8;N, time:Int64]\"]\n    9 -> 10 [arrowhead=none, arrowtail=normal, dir=back]\n  }\n}\n// End DataFusion GraphViz Plan\n```\n\nYou can pipe it to `iplan` and render as a .pdf\n\n\n## Running `rustfmt` and `clippy`\n\nCI will check the code formatting with [`rustfmt`] and Rust best practices with [`clippy`].\n\nTo automatically format your code according to `rustfmt` style, first make sure `rustfmt` is installed using `rustup`:\n\n```shell\nrustup component add rustfmt\n```\n\nThen, whenever you make a change and want to reformat, run:\n\n```shell\ncargo fmt --all\n```\n\nSimilarly with `clippy`, install with:\n\n```shell\nrustup component add clippy\n```\n\nAnd run with:\n\n```shell\ncargo clippy --all-targets --workspace -- -D warnings\n```\n\n[`rustfmt`]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt\n[`clippy`]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy\n\n## Distributed Tracing\n\nSee [tracing.md](docs/tracing.md) for more information on the distributed tracing functionality within InfluxDB 3\n"

          "content": "Profiling `influxdb3`\n=====================\n\nThis document explains several profiling strategies.\n\n# Preparation\n\n## Choosing a profile\n\nYou will need to choose a profile to build and run the `influxdb3` binary. Available profiles are \nconfigured in [Cargo.toml] and are listed here:\n\n- `release`: this is the profile used for release builds, and will produce a fully-optimized\nproduction quality release binary. The compile time for this profile can be quite long, so for\nrapid iteration, this profile is not recommended.\n- `quick-release`: this is a modified version of `release` intended to produce a close-to-production\nbinary, but with a faster build time. So, it is more suitable to rapid iterations and testing out\nchanges.\n- `bench`: this is the same as `release`, but will compile the binary with `debuginfo` turned on\nfor more readable symbols in generated profiles.\n- `quick-bench`: a modified version of `quick-release` that compiles the binary with `debuginfo`\nturned on.\n- `dev`: this profile produces an unoptimized binary with `debuginfo` turned on.\n\nIf you are getting started, we recommend using either the `quick-release` or `quick-bench` profiles \nto get up and running faster, then once you are ready, and need to get as much performance as \npossible out of the binary, use `release` or `bench`.\n\n## Building and running the binary\n\nOnce you have chosen a profile, you can build the `influxdb3` binary using cargo:\n\n```\ncargo build -p influxdb3 --profile <profile>\n```\n\nThis will build the binary and place it in the `target` folder in your working directory, e.g.,\n`target/<profile>/influxdb3`.\n\nYou can then prfile the `influxdb3` server, or whichever command, using the fully-qualified path\nand the profiling tools of your choice. For example,\n\n```\n<path_to_working_directory>/target/<profile>/influxdb3 serve\n```\n\n# Profiling Tools\n\n## macOS\n\nInstruments is a versatile profiling tool packaged with XCode on macOS that comes with several \nbuilt-in profiling tools.\n\nIn order to profile your compiled `influxdb3` binary, you will need to choose it as the target in\nInstruments, and then provide the necessary environment variables or command line arguments. For\nexample, to profile a running `influxdb3` instance using the local file system for object storage, \nyou would choose the compiled target as:\n```\n<path_to_working_directory>/target/<profile>/influxdb3\n```\nand then provide the command-line arguments:\n```\nserve --object-store=file --data-dir=~/.influxdb3\n```\n\nYou can then start your profiled binary by pressing the red record button, **File** > **Record Trace**\n, or with the shortcut `⌘`+`R`.\n\nIf the default sampling frequency in Instruments is not resolute enough, then you can open the\n**File** > **Recording Options** and enable **High-Frequency** recording.\n\n### Instruments: CPU/Performance Profiling\n\nThere are several instruments useful for profiling the CPU and performance of `influxdb3`.\n\n- Time Profiler (sample-based CPU profiler)\n- CPU Profiler (cycle-based CPU profiler)\n- Filesystem Activity (file system and disk I/O activity)\n- System Call Trace (system calls and CPU scheduling)\n\n### Instruments: Allocations\n\nThe allocations instrument is a powerful tool for tracking heap allocations on macOS and recording \ncall stacks.\n\nIt can be used with Rust and `influxdb3`, but requires some additional steps on aarch64 and later \nversions of macOS due to increased security.\n\n#### Preparing binary\n\nYou must compile `influxdb3` with `--no-default-features` to ensure the default system allocator is\nused. Following the compilation step, [you must codesign the binary][instruments-codesign-bin] with \nthe `get-task-allow` entitlement set to `true`. Without the codesign step, the Allocations \ninstrument will fail to start with an error similar to the following:\n\n> Required Kernel Recording Resources Are in Use\n\nFirst, generate a temporary entitlements plist file, named `tmp.entitlements`:\n\n```sh\n/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c \"Add :com.apple.security.get-task-allow bool true\" tmp.entitlements\n```\n\nThen codesign the file with the `tmp.entitlements` file:\n\n```sh\ncodesign -s - --entitlements tmp.entitlements -f target/release/influxdb3\n```\n\nYou can verify the file is correctly code-signed as follows:\n\n```sh\ncodesign --display --entitlements - target/release/influxdb3\n```\n```\nExecutable=<path_to_working_dir>/target/<profile>/influxdb3\n[Dict]\n\t[Key] com.apple.security.get-task-allow\n\t[Value]\n\t\t[Bool] true\n```\n\nor the running `influxdb3` process using its PID:\n\n```sh\ncodesign --display --entitlements - +<PID>\n```\n\n[instruments-codesign-bin]: https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/685964?answerId=683365022#683365022\n"
