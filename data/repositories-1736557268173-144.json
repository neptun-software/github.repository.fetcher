Most contributions require you to\nagree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to,\nand actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit\n<https://cla.microsoft.com>.\n\n> Important: when translating text in this repo, please ensure that you do not use machine translation. We will verify translations via the community, so please only volunteer for translations in languages where you are proficient.\n\nWhen you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need\nto provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the\ninstructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repositories using our CLA.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nThis project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst).\nFor more information read the [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst) or contact [opencode@microsoft.com](mailto:opencode@microsoft.com) with any additional questions or comments.\n\n## Question or Problem?\n\nPlease do not open GitHub issues for general support questions as the GitHub list should be used for feature requests and bug reports. This way we can more easily track actual issues or bugs from the code and keep the general discussion separate from the actual code.\n\n## Typos, Issues, Bugs and contributions\n\nWhenever you are submitting any changes to the Generative AI for Beginners repository, please follow these recommendations.\n\n* Always fork the repository to your own account before making your modifications\n* Do not combine multiple changes to one pull request. For example, submit any bug fix and documentation updates using separate PRs\n* If your pull request shows merge conflicts, make sure to update your local main to be a mirror of what's in the main repository before making your modifications\n* If you are submitting a translation, please create one PR for all the translated files as we don't accept partial translations for the content\n* If you are submitting a typo or documentation fix, you can combine modifications to a single PR where suitable\n\n## General Guidance for writing\n\n- Ensure that all your URLs are wrapped in square brackets followed by a parenthesis with no extra spaces around them or inside them `[]()`.\n- Ensure that any relative link (i.e. links to other files and folders in the repository) starts with a `./` referring to a file or a folder located in the current working directory or a `../` referring to a file or a folder located in a parent working directory.\n- Ensure that any relative link (i.e. links to other files and folders in the repository) has a tracking ID (i.e. `?` or `&` then `wt.mc_id=` or `WT.mc_id=`) at the end of it.\n- Ensure that any URL from the following domains _github.com, microsoft.com, visualstudio.com, aka.ms, and azure.com_ has a tracking ID (i.e. `?` or `&` then `wt.mc_id=` or `WT.mc_id=`) at the end of it.\n- Ensure that your links don't have country specific locale in them (i.e. `/en-us/` or `/en/`).\n- Ensure that all images are stored in the `./images` folder.\n- Ensure that the images have descriptive names using English characters, numbers, and dashes in the name of your image.\n\n## GitHub Workflows\n\nWhen you submit a pull request, four different workflows will be triggered to validate the previous rules.\nSimply follow the instructions listed here to pass the workflow checks.\n\n- [Check Broken Relative Paths](#check-broken-relative-paths)\n- [Check Paths Have Tracking](#check-paths-have-tracking)\n- [Check URLs Have Tracking](#check-urls-have-tracking)\n- [Check URLs Don't Have Locale](#check-urls-dont-have-locale)\n\n### Check Broken Relative Paths\n\nThis workflow ensures that any relative path in your files is working.\nThis repository is deployed to GitHub pages so you need to be very careful when you type the links that glue everything together to not direct anyone to the wrong place.\n\nTo make sure that your links are working properly simply use VS code to check that.\n\nFor example, when you hover over any link in your files you will be prompted to follow the link by pressing on **ctrl + click**\n\n![VS code follow links screenshot](./images/vscode-follow-link.png?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst \"Screenshot from vs code prompt to follow a link when you hover over a link.\")\n\nIf you click on a link and it's not working locally then, surely it will trigger the workflow and won't work on GitHub.\n\nTo fix this issue, try to type the link with the help of VS code.\n\nWhen you type `./` or `../` VS code will prompt you to choose from the available options according to what you typed.\n\n![VS code select relative path screenshot](./images/vscode-select-relative-path.png?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst \"Screenshot from vs code prompt to select relative path from a pop up list.\")\n\nFollow the path by clicking on the desired file or folder and you will be sure that your path is not broken.\n\nOnce you add the correct relative path, save, and push your changes the workflow will be triggered again to verify your changes.\nIf you pass the check then you are good to go.\n\n### Check Paths Have Tracking\n\nThis workflow ensures that any relative path has tracking in it.\nThis repository is deployed to GitHub pages so we need to track the movement between the different files and folders.\n\nTo make sure your relative paths have tracking in them simply check for the following text `?wt.mc_id=` at the end of the path.\nIf it's appended to your relative paths then you will pass this check.\n\nIf not, you may get the following error.\n\n![GitHub check paths missing tracking comment screenshot](./images/github-check-paths-missing-tracking-comment.png?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst \"Screenshot from github comment that shows missing tracking from relative paths\")\n\nTo fix this issue, try to open the file path that the workflow highlighted and add the tracking ID to the end of the relative paths.\n\nOnce you add the tracking ID, save, and push your changes the workflow will be triggered again to verify your changes.\nIf you pass the check then you are good to go.\n\n### Check URLs Have Tracking\n\nThis workflow ensures that any web URL has tracking in it.\nThis repository is available to everyone so you need to make sure to track the access to know from where the traffic is coming.\n\nTo make sure your URLs have tracking in them simply check for the following text `?wt.mc_id=` at the end of the URL.\nIf it's appended to your URLs then you will pass this check.\n\nIf not, you may get the following error.\n\n![GitHub check urls missing tracking comment screenshot](./images/github-check-urls-missing-tracking-comment.png?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst \"Screenshot from github comment that shows missing tracking from urls\")\n\nTo fix this issue, try to open the file path that the workflow highlighted and add the tracking ID to the end of the URLs.\n\nOnce you add the tracking ID, save, and push your changes the workflow will be triggered again to verify your changes.\nIf you pass the check then you are good to go.\n\n### Check URLs Don't Have Locale\n\nThis workflow ensures that any web URL doesn't have country specific locale in it.\nThis repository is available to everyone around the world so you need to make sure not to include your country's locale in URLs.\n\nTo make sure your URLs don't have country locale in them simply check for the following text `/en-us/` or `/en/` or any other language locale anywhere in the URL.\nIf it's not present in your URLs then you will pass this check.\n\nIf not, you may get the following error.\n\n![GitHub check country locale comment screenshot](./images/github-check-country-locale-comment.png?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst \"Screenshot from github comment that shows added country locale to urls\")\n\nTo fix this issue, try to open the file path that the workflow highlighted and remove the country locale from the URLs.\n\nOnce you remove the country locale, save, and push your changes the workflow will be triggered again to verify your changes.\nIf you pass the check then you are good to go.\n\nCongratulations! We will get back to you as soon as possible with feedback about your contribution.\n"
