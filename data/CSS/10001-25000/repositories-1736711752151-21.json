It must be specifically related to development (so software like Microsoft Word or Google Calendar won't be accepted since it's too general).</p>\n\n<b>Special Cases (see <a href='https://github.com/devicons/devicon/discussions/353'>this discussion</a> for more details)</b>\n<ul>\n  <li>Tech companies used to be accepted in the repository. However, we do not accept them anymore. Icons like Facebook, Twitter, etc., are kept due to backward compatibility. </li>\n    <ul>\n    <li>We still accept their icons if they represent a service and not the company itself.</li>\n    <li>Ex. AWS is accepted since their names refer to their services. We will not accept Amazon since that's the parent company that includes non-tech related tools</li>\n    </ul>\n  <li>Related fields like graphic designs or game development. Since many \"development\" jobs require people to know related fields, some softwares will be accepted in Devicon even though they aren't strictly \"development tools\". </li>\n    <ul>\n      <li>ex. some Adobe products, game engines, CMS, etc... See <a href='https://github.com/devicons/devicon/pull/336'> for more details.</a></li>\n    </ul>\n  <li>General tools that are well known in the tech industries. Things like Trello, Slack, etc., are accepted under this category. Unfortunately, we won't accept Discord since its use is still too general. This will be treated on a case-by-case basis.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<hr>\n<h2 id='requestingIcon'>Requesting an Icon</h2>\n<p>To request an icon, please create an issue in the repository, and follow these guidelines:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Search for other issues already requesting the icon</li>\n  <li>If an issue doesn't exist, create an issue naming it \"Icon request: <i>name-of-the-icon</i>\". </li>\n  <li>Please create separate issues for each icon</li>\n  <li>Use the Issue Template and fill out the proper information</li>\n  <li>Please include links where the icon can be found. Ex: the icon's official webpage/wiki article.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"overview\">Overview on Submitting Icons</h2>\n<p>Here is what you have to do to submit your icons to the repo.</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Create the SVGs for each <a href=\"#versionNaming\"> SVG versions </a> that you have. Follow the <a href=\"#SVGStandards\">convention</a> listed.</li>\n  <li>Put the SVGs of each Icon into its own <a href=\"#orgGuidelines\">folders</a> in <code>/icons</code></li>\n  <li><a href=\"#updateDevicon\">Update the <code>devicon.json</code> to include the new Icon</a> </li>\n  <li>Create a separated pull request (PR) towards the <code>develop</code> branch for each Icon.</li>\n  <li>Fill out the info as stated in the PR template.</li>\n  <li>Include the name of the Icon in the pull request title in this format: <code>new icon: <i>Icon name</i> (<i>versions</i>)</code> </li>\n  <li><i>Optional</i>: Reference the issues regarding the new icon and label the PR `feature:icon`. </li>\n  <li>Some bots will check your SVGs. If there are any errors, please fix them as instructed.</li>\n  <li>Wait for a maintainer to review your changes. They will run the <a href='#peekBot'><code>peek-bot</code></a> to check your icons.</li>\n  <li>If there are no issues, they will merge it using <a href=\"https://github.com/devicons/devicon/discussions/470\"><b>squash merging</b></a>. If there are any problems, they will let you know, and give you a chance to fix them.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><b>Note:</b> Due to our recent bot upgrades, icon contributors don't have to optimize/minify their SVGs anymore!</p>\n\n<hr>\n<h2 id='versionNaming'>Versions and Naming Conventions</h2>\n<p>For the technology name, make the file and folder name lowercase and concatenate them.

An icon can only have one or two versions available. Just keep in mind that the minimum is 1 and the maximum 6 (for now). You must also have at least one version that can be make into an icon.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    The <b>plain</b> and <b>line</b> versions (with or without wordmark) are designed to be available in the final icon font.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    The <b>original</b> SVG version do not need to be simple and can contain numerous colors/gradients. However, if it's intended to be made into an icon, keep it simple.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Some icons are really simple (ex. Apple), so the original version can be used as the plain version and as the icon font. In this case, you'll only need to make one of the version (either <b>original</b> or <b>plain</b>) and name them <b>original</b>. \n      <ul>\n        <li>If you are a long time contributor: aliases are no longer mandatory. If you are wondering which name to use, just pick <code>original</code></li>\n      </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n<h2 id='SVGStandards'>SVG Standards</h2>\n<p>Before you submit your logos/SVGs, please ensure that they meet the following standard:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The background must be transparent.</li>\n  <li>The icon is centered horizontally and vertically within the <code>viewBox</code>.</li>\n  <li>The SVG name follows this convention: <code>(Technology name)-(original|plain|line)(-wordmark?).</code></li>\n  <li>The <b>plain</b> and <b>line</b> versions (with or without wordmark) need to stay as simple as possible. They must have only one color and the paths are united. The color will be removed when being turned into icons so the <code>.svg</code> can have any color.\n  </li>\n  <li>Each <code>.svg</code> file contains one version of an icon in a <code>0 0 128 128</code> viewbox. You can use a service like <a href=\"https://www.iloveimg.com/resize-image/resize-svg\">resize-image</a> for scaling the SVG.</li>\n  <li>The icon's strokes and texts must be fills. This is to satisfy our conversion website's <a href=\"https://icomoon.io/#docs/stroke-to-fill\">requirements.</a></li>\n  <li>Each <code>.svg</code> must use the <code>fill</code> attribute instead of using <code>classes</code> for colors. This is to prevent class name clashing when using inline SVG. See <a href=\"https://github.com/devicons/devicon/issues/407\">here</a> for more details.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n<h2 id='orgGuidelines'>Organizational Guidelines</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>Each icon has its own folder located in the <code>icons</code> folder. </li>\n  <li>The folder name must matches the name value uses for the SVG files. Ex: `react-original.svg` should go inside a `react` folder, `microsoftsqlserver` icons should go inside a `microsoftsqlserver` folder. </li>\n  <li>All the <code>.svg</code> files for the Icon must go in the same folder. </li>\n  <li><i>Optional</i>: Each folder <i>may</i> contain one <code>.eps</code> file. The <code>.eps</code> file should contains all available versions of an icon. Each version is contained in a 128px by 128px artboard</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n<h2 id='updateDevicon'> Updating the <code>devicon.json</code> </h2>\n<p>\n  Before you open a PR into Devicon, you must update the <code>devicon.json</code>.

Basically, follow the <a href=\"#overview\">Overview on Submitting Icon</a> but replace the <code>new</code> with <code>update</code> in name of request with the above.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Follow the rest of the steps as laid out in <a href=\"#overview\">Overview on Submitting Icon</a>.\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr>\n<h2 id='teams'>Maintainer/Reviewer/Teams</h2>\n<p>\n    Devicon is living by it's contributors and <a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/devicons/people\">maintainers</a>.

Please feel free to take a look at the workflow files. The codes should be clear enough to follow along.</p>\n\n<p>Here are the main bots/script that we use:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li id='peekBot'><code>peek-bot</code>: Upload the icons to Icomoon and see what it looks like. Doesn't download any icons at this time.</li>\n  <li id='buildBot'><code>build-bot</code>: Build the icons by uploading them to Icomoon and download the resulting icon files. Also update the css file</li>\n  <li id='optimizeBot'><code>optimize-bot</code>: Optimize the SVGs by minifying them and prefixing their IDs with the file names. This is done so using inline SVGs from this repository will not cause ID clash.</li>\n  <li id='checkSvgBot'><code>check-SVG-bot</code>: Check the SVGs uploaded and ensure they have the correct view box, fills, etc..</li>\n  <li id='npmReleaseBot'><code>npm-release-bot</code>: Update the NPM package.</li>\n  <li id='releaseMessageBot'><code>release-message-bot</code>: Create the release message for the PR.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here are the modular tasks in the build script:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Upload SVGs to <a href=\"https://icomoon.io/app/#/select\">icomoon.io</a> and get the icons back. For details, see <a href=\"https://github.com/devicons/devicon/issues/252\"> the original disscussion</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/devicons/devicon/pull/268\">this PR that introduce the feature</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/devicons/devicon/issues/300\">the final changes to it.</a> Used by <b>peek-bot</b> and <b>build-bot</b>.</li>\n  <li>Preview what an SVG would look like as an icon using the upload svgs script (see <a href=\"https://github.com/devicons/devicon/pull/412\">this</a>). Used by <b>peek-bot</b>.</li>\n  <li>Build, combine, and minify CSS files. For details, see <a href=\"https://github.com/devicons/devicon/pull/290\">this</a>. Used by <b>build-bot</b>.</li>\n  <li>Send screenshots to Imgur and upload it to a PR. See <a href=\"https://github.com/devicons/devicon/pull/398\">the PR for the Imgur action</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/devicons/devicon/pull/481\"> the PR for uploading the pictures to a PR. Used by <b>peek-bot</b> and <b>build-bot</b>.</a>\n  <li>Ensure code quality is up to standard</li>\n  <li>Comment on the PR so maintainers don't have to manually upload icon result. Used by <b>peek-bot</b> and <b>build-bot</b>.</li>\n  <li>Publishing a new release to <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/devicon\">npm</a>; See <a href=\"https://github.com/devicons/devicon/issues/288\">#288</a></li>\n  <li>Creating a list of features that was added since last release.

Listed below are the common ones and their solutions</p>\n<ol>\n  <li><b>No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it. (os error 10061)</b>\n    <ul>\n      <li>See <a href=\"https://github.com/devicons/devicon/runs/2292634069?check_suite_focus=true\">this action</a> for an example.</li>\n      <li>Caused by Selenium being unable to connect to the Icomoon website. It is unknown why this happens but the hypothesis is Icomoon blocks Selenium's multiple connection request and treats them as bots. See <a href=\"https://github.com/devicons/devicon/pull/544#issuecomment-812147713\">this</a>.</li>\n      <li>Solution: wait for a few minutes and rerun the script. Repeat until it works.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><b>SHA Integrity</b>\n    <ul>\n      <li>See <a href=\"https://github.com/devicons/devicon/runs/2310036084?check_suite_focus=true\">this action</a> for an example.</li>\n      <li>Caused by the <code>package-lock.json</code>. Most likely the result of a dependabot update but not 100% sure.</li>\n      <li>Solution: Remove the <code>package-lock.json</code> and run `npm install` to generate a new file. Commit and push.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><b>Wrong PR Title</b>\n    <ul>\n      <li>The <code>bot-peek</code> script relies on the PR title to find the icon that was added in the PR. If the format doesn't match what is specified in <a href=\"#overview\">Overview on Submitting Icon</a>, the bot will fail.</li>\n      <li>Solution: Ensure the name of the PR follows the convention.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><b>Icon created by Icomoon contains strange lines that aren't in the SVG</b>\n    <ul>\n      <li>See <a href=\"https://github.com/devicons/devicon/pull/532\">this PR</a>'s peek result.</li>\n      <li>This is caused by a bug in Icomoon's parser (see <a href=\"https://github.com/devicons/devicon/pull/532#issuecomment-827180766\">this</a>).</li>\n      <li>Solution: Luckily this is an extremely rare case. Try remaking the SVG in a different way (using different paths/shapes). If your text/paths are joined with another object (say, the logo), try splitting them into individual paths (see <a href=\"https://github.com/devicons/devicon/pull/816#issuecomment-904021383\">this PR</a>). You can always test using Icomoon to see if your fix works.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2 id=\"discordServer\">Discord server</h2>\n<p>\nWe are running a Discord server. You can go here to talk, discuss, and more with the maintainers and other people, too. Here's the invitation: https://discord.gg/hScy8KWACQ. If you don't have a GitHub account but want to suggest ideas or new icons, you can do that here in our Discord channel.\n<b>The Discord server is unofficial, and Devicons is still being maintained via GitHub.</b>\n</p>\n\n<h2 id='release'>Release strategy, conventions, preparation and execution</h2>\n<h5>Release strategy</h5>\n<p>Devicon does not follow a strict release plan. A new release is depended on current amount of contributions, required bugfixes/patches and will be discussed by the team of maintainers.</p>\n<p>Generally speaking: A new release will be published when new icons are added or a bug was fixed. When it's predictable that multiple icons are added in a foreseeable amount of time they are usually wrapped together.</p>\n<h5>Conventions</h5>\n<p>The version naming follows the rules of <a href=\"https://semver.org/\">Semantic Versioning</a>. Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,</li>\n    <li>MINOR version when you add functionality <b>(like a new icon)</b> in a backwards compatible manner, and</li>\n    <li>PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h5>Release preparation and execution</h5>\n<ol>\n    <li>Define the next release version number based on the conventions</li>\n    <li>Checkout <code>development</code> as <code>draft-release</code> branch</li>\n    <li>Bump the package version using <code>npm version v<i>MAJOR</i>.<i>MINOR</i>.<i>PATCH</i> -m \"bump npm version to v<i>MAJOR</i>.<i>MINOR</i>.<i>PATCH</i>\"</code>  (see <code><a href=\"https://github.com/devicons/devicon/pull/497\">#487</a></code>)</li>\n    <li>Push the branch <code>draft-release</code></li>\n    <li>Manually trigger the workflow <code><a href=\"https://github.com/devicons/devicon/actions/workflows/build_icons.yml\">build_icons.yml</a></code> (which has a <code>workflow_dispatch</code> event trigger) and select the branch <code>draft-release</code> as target branch. This will build a font version of all icons using icomoon and automatically creates a pull request to merge the build result back into <code>draft-release</code></li>\n    <li>Review and approve the auto-create pull request created by the action of the step above</li>\n    <li>Create a pull request towards <code>development</code>. Mention the release number in the pull request title (like \"Build preparation for release v<i>MAJOR</i>.<i>MINOR</i>.<i>PATCH</i>).\n      <ul> \n        <li>\n        Add information about all new icons, fixes, features and enhancements in the description of the pull request. \n        </li>\n        <li>\n        Take the PRs/commits as a guideline. It's also a good idea to mention and thank all contributions who participated in the release (take description of <code><a href=\"https://github.com/devicons/devicon/pull/504\">#504</a></code> as an example).\n        </li>\n        <li>\n        We now have a script that will do this for us. Check the `build-bot`'s PR message in the last step. There should be a section where it displays the features that have been added to the release. You can copy the markdown there and use it for the release message.\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li>Wait for review and approval of the pull request (you can perform a squash-merge)</li>\n    <li>Once merged create a pull request with BASE <code>master</code> and HEAD <code>development</code>. Copy the description of the earlier pull request.</li>\n    <li>Since it was already approved in the 'development' stage a maintainer is allowed to merge it (<b>DON'T</b> perform a squash-merge).</li>\n    <li>Create a <a href=\"https://github.com/devicons/devicon/releases/new\">new release</a> using the format \"<b>Release v<i>MAJOR</i>.<i>MINOR</i>.<i>PATCH</i></b>\" as tag and release title. Use the earlier created description as description of the release.</li>\n    <li>Publishing the release will trigger the <a href=\"/.github/workflows/npm_publish.yml\">npm_publish.yml</a> workflow which will execute a <code>npm publish</code> leading to a updated <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/devicon\">npm package</a> (v<i>MAJOR</i>.<i>MINOR</i>.<i>PATCH</i>).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2 id='resources'>Recommended resources and tools</h2>\n\n| Tool Name          | Link                                               | Description & Usage                                |\n| :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |\n| Inkscape           | https://inkscape.org/                              | Desktop application for editing and Making SVG's   |\n| Visual Studio Code | https://code.visualstudio.com/                     | A code editor for editing code                     |\n| vscode.dev         | https://vscode.dev/                                | Visual Studio Code in the browser                  |\n| Iloveimg           | https://www.iloveimg.com/resize-image/resize-svg   | Resizing SVG's                                     |\n| svgviewer.dev      | https://www.svgviewer.dev/                         | View, save, and optimize SVGs                      |\n"
