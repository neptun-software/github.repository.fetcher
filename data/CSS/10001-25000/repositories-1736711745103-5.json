          "content": "# [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com)\nSkeleton is a simple, responsive boilerplate to kickstart any responsive project.\n\nCheck out <http://getskeleton.com> for documentation and details.\n\n## Getting started\n\nThere are a couple ways to download Skeleton:\n- [Download the zip](https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton/releases/download/2.0.4/Skeleton-2.0.4.zip)\n- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton.git` (Note: this is under active development, so if you're looking for stable and safe, use the zipped download)\n\n\n### What's in the download?\n\nThe download includes Skeleton's CSS, Normalize CSS as a reset, a sample favicon, and an index.html as a starting point.\n\n```\nSkeleton/\n├── index.html\n├── css/\n│   ├── normalize.min.css\n│   └── skeleton.css\n└── images/\n    └── favicon.ico\n\n```\n\n### Why it's awesome\n\nSkeleton is lightweight and simple. It styles only raw HTML elements (with a few exceptions) and provides a responsive grid. Nothing more.\n- Around 400 lines of CSS unminified and with comments\n- It's a starting point, not a UI framework\n- No compiling or installing...just vanilla CSS\n\n\n## Browser support\n\n- Chrome latest\n- Firefox latest\n- Opera latest\n- Safari latest\n- IE latest\n\nThe above list is non-exhaustive. Skeleton works perfectly with almost all older versions of the browsers above, though IE certainly has large degradation prior to IE9.\n\n\n## License\n\nAll parts of Skeleton are free to use and abuse under the [open-source MIT license](https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton/blob/master/LICENSE.md).\n\n\n## Extensions\n\nThe following are extensions to Skeleton built by the community. They are not officially supported, but all have been tested and are compatible with v2.0 (exact release noted):\n- [Skeleton on LESS](https://github.com/whatsnewsaes/Skeleton-less): Skeleton built with LESS for easier replacement of grid, color, and media queries. (Last update was to match v2.0.1)\n- [Skeleton on Sass](https://github.com/whatsnewsaes/Skeleton-Sass): Skeleton built with Sass for easier replacement of grid, color, and media queries. (Last update was to match v2.0.1)\n\nHave an extension you want to see here? Just shoot an email to hi@getskeleton.com with your extension!\n\n\n## Colophon\n\nSkeleton was built using [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) and designed with [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch). The typeface [Raleway](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Raleway) was created by [Matt McInerney](http://matt.cc/) and [Pablo Impallari](http://www.impallari.com/). Code highlighting by Google's [Prettify library](https://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/). Icons in the header of the documentation are all derivative work of icons from [The Noun Project](http://thenounproject.com).
