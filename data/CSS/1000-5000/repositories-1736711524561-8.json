          "content": "# Michael Abrash's Graphics Programming Black Book\n\nThis is the source for an ebook version of Michael Abrash's Black Book of Graphics Programming (Special Edition), originally published in 1997 and [released online for free in 2001](http://www.drdobbs.com/parallel/graphics-programming-black-book/184404919) (original link now broken, [Internet Archive link](https://web.archive.org/web/20190706123029/http://www.drdobbs.com/parallel/graphics-programming-black-book/184404919)).\n\nReproduced with blessing of Michael Abrash, converted and maintained by [James Gregory](mailto:james@jagregory.com).\n\nThe [GitHub releases list](https://github.com/jagregory/abrash-black-book/releases) has an EPUB and Mobi version available for download, and you can find a mirror of the HTML version at [www.jagregory.com/abrash-black-book](http://www.jagregory.com/abrash-black-book/).\n\n## How does this differ from the previously released versions?\n\nThe book is now out of print, and hard to come by. Last time I checked, it was going for over $200 on eBay.\n\nThe version which Michael and Dr. Dobbs released in 2001 was a collection of PDF files. That version is [still available](http://www.drdobbs.com/parallel/graphics-programming-black-book/184404919) (original link now broken, [Internet Archive link](https://web.archive.org/web/20190706123029/http://www.drdobbs.com/parallel/graphics-programming-black-book/184404919)). However, the structure (multiple files) and the format (PDF) result in a poor user experience on an ebook reader or other mobile device.\n\nThis version has been thoroughly cleaned of artifacts and condensed into something which can easily be converted into an ebook-friendly format. You can read this version online at GitHub, or download any of the EPUB or Mobi releases. You can clone the repository and generate your own version with [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) if necessary.\n\n## Contributing\n\nChanges are welcome, especially conversion-related ones. If you spot any problems while reading, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/jagregory/abrash-black-book/issues) and I'll correct it. Pull requests are always welcome.\n\nSome larger changes could be made to improve the content. I'd love to see some of the images converted to a vector representation so we can provide higher-resolution versions.  Formulas and equations could be typeset with [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/).\n\n## Generating your own ebook\n\nYou need to have the following software installed and on your `PATH` before you begin:\n\n  * [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) version 2.0 or greater for Markdown to HTML and EPUB conversion.\n  * [kindlegen](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000765211) for Epub to Mobi conversion.\n\nTo generate an e-reader friendly version of the book, you can use `make` with one of the following options:\n\n  * `html` - build an HTML5 single-page version of the book\n  * `epub` - build an EPUB3 ebook\n  * `mobi` - build a Kindle-friendly Mobi\n  * `all`  - do all of the above\n\nOnce complete, there will be an `out` directory with a `black-book.epub`, a `black-book.mobi` and an `html` directory with a `black-book.html` file.\n\n> Note: Generating a Mobi requires an EPUB to already exist. Also, Mobi generation can be *slow* because of compression. If you want a quick Mobi conversion you can just run `kindlegen out/black-book.epub`.\n"
