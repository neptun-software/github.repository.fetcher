There are\njust a few small guidelines you need to follow.\n\n## Contributing to transition.css\n\nThanks for your interest in contributing! Before contributing, please make sure you understand the guidelines provided here. \n\n## Design Guidelines\n\nTransitions, like many facets of visual and interaction design, can be highly subjective. Maintaining a consistent library of transitions in an active community can be difficult; these design guidelines are designed to help encourage thoughtful criticism of new transitions that are proposed for transition.css.\n\nThe transitions in transition.css should follow a few key principles:\n\n- **Transitions should be tolerable.** Transitions should be tolerable, seeing them repeatedly should not become too annoying or overbearing.\n- **Transitions should not interfere with document flow or control/input availability.** In other words, the absence of an transition should never reduce usability of a product: they should be non-critical and seen as “progressive enhancements”.\n- **Transitions should be helpful.** They should be designed to move users through moments of interest, ease natural reading order, or to communicate relationships between spaces.\n- **Transitions should feel familial.** Avoid introducing transitions that feel out-of-place compared to the existing set.\n- **Transitions should feel natural.** Transitions should reflect, as much as is reasonable, motion that occurs in natural physics. Avoid extreme timing functions, and model transitions on real-world events.\n- **Transitions shouldn't run on devices without the power to do so.** If a device is contrained in battery, memory, GPU, etc, then it's a good idea to avoid transitions. \n\n## Contributor License Agreement\n\nContributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License\nAgreement (CLA). You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your\ncontribution; this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your\ncontributions as part of the project. Head over to\n<https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see your current agreements on file or\nto sign a new one.\n\nYou generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one\n(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it\nagain.\n\n## Code reviews\n\nAll submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We\nuse GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult\n[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more\ninformation on using pull requests.\n\n## Community Guidelines\n\nThis project follows\n[Google's Open Source Community Guidelines](https://opensource.google/conduct/).\n"

Just copy 📋 the following, create a new bookmark, and paste in the URL:\n\n```js\njavascript:(function(){var a=document.createElement(\"link\");a.rel=\"stylesheet\";a.href=\"https://unpkg.com/transition-style\";document.head.append(a);})();\n```\n\nYou can now go to a website and click the bookmark to try it out! Animations automatically run when you manually add classes in dev tools, or run code like this in the console:\n\n```js\n$('body').setAttribute('transition-style','in:circle:bottom-right')\n```\n\nCaveat: this bookmarklet doesn't work on websites that have a strict CSP set up.\n\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://github.com/argyleink/transition.css/blob/main/gif/opposing-corner-fold.gif?raw=true\" />\n<br><br>\n\n## Usage\nAfter `transition.css` has been added to your project, add an attribute to an element and watch the magic:  \n\n```html\n<div transition-style=\"in:circle:bottom-right\">\n  A transitioned IN element\n</div>\n\n<div transition-style=\"out:wipe:down\">\n  A transitioned OUT element\n</div>\n```\n\n> if nothing is happening when using the attributes, it's likely `transition.css` has not loaded\n\n<br>\nAttributes were chosen as the default so there's no question which transition is active. **There can be only 1 at a time.** With classes, for example, what happens when multiple \"transition in\" classes are applied to an element? Transition.css chooses to default with a state machine approach so things like a classname collision doesn't need solved. See the [custom](#custom) section below for ways to use classes and/or the shape custom properties so transition.css can fit into your development environment. The built in attribute based approach is very easy to hack, customize and escape. \n\n#### Using `@keyframes`\nEach bundle ships with the `@keyframes` declared, and you can use them as you see fit. You can use these to build your own animations or just hook into the presets in your own way:\n\n```css\n.main--state-in {\n  animation: wipe-in-left;\n  animation-duration: 2s;\n  animation-fill-mode: both;\n}\n```\n\nCheckout the [src](https://github.com/argyleink/transition.css/blob/main/src) to find the names of the `@keyframe` animations. They follow a pattern like the attributes, so you should be able to assume what they are with decent accuracy. \n\n<br>\n\n#### Using CSS Custom Properties\nEach bundle ships with clearly named custom properties which contain the state and geometry needed to orchestrate custom transitions. \n\n```css\n.overrides {\n  --transition__duration: 1s;            /* default: 2.5s */\n  --transition__easing: ease-in-out;     /* default: cubic-bezier(.25, 1, .30, 1) */\n  --transition__delay: 1s;               /* default: 0 */\n}\n```\n\nor target a specific transition and override it's defaults:\n\n```css\n[transition=\"in:wipe:up\"] {\n  --transition__duration: 1s;\n}\n```\n\n<br>\n\n#### Custom\nGo off the rails and build your own transitions with these variables. There's even the `The Hackpack` which is exclusively the custom props 🤘💀  Here's how you can compose a brand new transition from the custom property primitives:\n\n```css\n@keyframes circle-swoop {\n  from {\n    clip-path: var(--circle-top-right-out);\n  }\n  to {\n    clip-path: var(--circle-bottom-right-in);\n  }\n}\n\n.--in-custom {\n  --transition__duration: 1s;\n  --transition__easing: ease-in-out;\n  animation-name: circle-swoop;\n}\n```\n\nThen, in the HTML:\n\n```html\n<div transition-style class=\"--in-custom\">\n  A custom transitioned element\n</div>\n```\n\n> The only rule is that you must transition from the same type of shapes\n\nAt this point you're using Transition.css to it's maximum. You can reach a huge set of transitions by using the custom properties. Have fun!\n\n#### Play\nPlay and experiment with [this Codepen](https://codepen.io/argyleink/pen/RwrzGJb)\n\n<br><br>\n\n## Development\nSee the `svelte` branch.\n\n## Production\n`npm run bundle` concurrently bundles and minifies. \n"
