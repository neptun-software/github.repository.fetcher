You must inform recipients that the Source\nCode Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\nLicense, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\nattempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\nForm.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\nprovided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\nthe Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\nSoftware with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\nCovered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\nLicense permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\nunder the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\nthe Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\nSoftware under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\nLicense(s).\n\n3.4. Notices\n\nYou may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\n(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\nor limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of\nthe Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to\nthe extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n\n3.5.

However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\nbehalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\nsuch warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\nYou alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\nliability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\ndisclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\njurisdiction.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\nLicense with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to\nstatute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\nthe terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\ndescribe the limitations and the code they affect.

          "content": "# CSS Remedy\n\nStart your project with a remedy for the technical debt of CSS.\n\n_This project is just getting started. It's too early to distribute it as part of other frameworks. Feel free to read the files and take inspiration, but do know we have a ways to go before it's really \"ready to use\"._\n\n\n## Contribute\n\nWe'd love to have you contribute to this project.\nSee the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more detail.\n\n\n## What Is This?\n\nFor years, base or reset stylesheets have helped web developers get started faster.\n\nEarly resets eliminated all visual styling, putting the burden of defining styles for every element on the webmaster. This made sense when there weren't as many elements or  properties, and when each browser did something very different than the others. By zeroing everything out, you start from a blank page. There were many reset stylesheets that took this approach. Eric Meyer's became the most popular.\n\nMore recently, Normalize and similar projects took a different approach. Rather than removing all styling, they set out to create sensible defaults and eliminate browser bugs. Use one of these and you get a consistent base across all browsers.\n\nCSS Remedy takes a slightly different approach. These days, browsers are far more consistent in how they render CSS. But there are limitations on how far browsers can improve their User Agent Stylesheet. The defaults for the web have to be consistent with the past. Many desirable changes would break millions of existing websites.\n\nYou, however, don't have to stay in the past. You can override the UA styles with more modern ideas of how CSS should work by default. Introducing CSS Remedy.\n\n> *‘Because that’s what Mosaic did’* is exactly the kind of reasoning CSS Remedy is trying to leave behind.\n>\n> ---Eric Meyer\n\n## Guiding Ideas\n\nCSS Remedy sets CSS properties or values to what they would be if the CSSWG were creating the CSS today, from scratch, and didn't have to worry about backwards compatibility.\n\nWe provide:\n- A core `remedy.css` that we recommend using broadly across most projects.\n- A secondary `reminders.css` with more opinionated or situational remedies that should be reviewed and considered on a case-by-case basis.\n- Additional specialized remedy files (such as `quotes.css`) that can be used as-needed, but may not be required generally.\n\nThe current set of features can be extended along those lines, with opportunities for light-weight form-styling and other useful defaults. This is a living project, and we're excited to see where it goes!\n\n## Browser Support\n\nWe will actively support modern browsers, IE 11 and up. For older browsers:\n\n- We will add proven fixes when they are light-weight and non-invasive. We're not trying to ensure full interoperability, but we do want to help encourage reasonable fallbacks.\n- We won't \"support\" older browsers with any sense of urgency, priority, or completeness.\n- We're not trying to polyfill new CSS features like grid, or recreate the full html5 \"shiv\"\n\n## Inspiration and History\n\n* [How browsers are supposed to render things](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/rendering.html)\n* [Requests on Twitter](https://twitter.com/jensimmons/status/1082396940237750272)\n* [Incomplete List of Mistakes in the Design of CSS](https://wiki.csswg.org/ideas/mistakes)\n* [Reboot, created by the Bootstrap team, 2017](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/content/reboot)\n* [Web Typography, a book by Richard Rutter, 2017](http://book.webtypography.net)\n* [Sanitize, created by Jonathan Neal](https://csstools.github.io/sanitize.css)\n* [Formalize, created by Nathan Smith](https://formalize.me)\n* [Normalize, created by Nicolas Gallagher and Jonathan Neal, 2011-2019](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css)\n* [HTML5 Reset Stylesheet, by Richard Clark, 2010](https://html5doctor.com/html-5-reset-stylesheet)\n* [CSS Reset, created by Eric Meyer, 2007-2011](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset)\n* [Tantek’s CSS Reset: UndoHTML, 2004](https://tantek.com/log/2004/undohtml.css)\n* [A look at CSS Resets in 2018, article by Ire Aderinokun](https://bitsofco.de/a-look-at-css-resets-in-2018)\n* [A Roundup of CSS Resets, from before 2007 (there were many)](https://perishablepress.com/a-killer-collection-of-global-css-reset-styles)\n* [The origin story of `body { margin: 8px; }` by Miriam Suzanne, 2022](https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/2022/07/04/body-margin-8px/)\n"
