I have been keeping busy lately, and have been using Ubuntu sporadically, so it would be nice to have some help!\n\n# Flatabulous\n\nThis is a Flat theme for Ubuntu and other debian based Linux Systems.  This is based on the Ultra-Flat theme. Special thanks to @steftrikia and Satyajit Sahoo for the original work.\n\n# Installation\n\n## Update\n\nInstall it manually, if you are on Ubuntu 16.04 or higher. If you prefer the `.deb` installers, please download the correct one, based on the version from [here](https://github.com/anmoljagetia/Flatabulous/releases).\n\n\nThis theme was designed *specially* for the Unity environment on Ubuntu as I have only tested it on Ubuntu. It might not work properly for the other versions.\n\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/M5yxggQ.png?1)\n*The terminal*\n\n\nTo install the theme, you must first install the [**Unity Tweak Tool**](https://launchpad.net/unity-tweak-tool). It can be installed by simply running the command:\n\n```\nsudo apt-get install unity-tweak-tool\n```\n\n## Update\n\nIf you are on Ubuntu 16.04 or higher, run the commands below to install Ubuntu Tweak:\n\n```\nwget -q -O - http://archive.getdeb.net/getdeb-archive.key | sudo apt-key add -\nsudo sh -c 'echo \"deb http://archive.getdeb.net/ubuntu xenial-getdeb apps\" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/getdeb.list'\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-tweak\n```\n\nor head over to their website, downloading the .deb file (recommended).\n\n## 1. Using the .deb file for Debian, Ubuntu and derivatives (Recommended)\n\nDownload the .deb file from [here](https://github.com/anmoljagetia/Flatabulous/releases/latest), double click to open with Ubuntu Software Center and click on install. Then, install the theme using ubuntu-tweak.\n\n## 2. Using the noobslab PPA\n\n```\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:noobslab/themes\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install flatabulous-theme\n```\n\n## 3. Manually\n\nDownload the source to the theme [here](https://github.com/anmoljagetia/Flatabulous/archive/master.zip). If a problem occurs with your installation, kindly download the correct version based on your version of Ubuntu from [here](https://github.com/anmoljagetia/Flatabulous/releases). If you are a developer or a designer, I also encourage you to contribute to it. Create a folder, called .theme in your home directory. This can be simply created by firing up your terminal, and then running\n\n```\nmkdir .themes\n```\n\nNow this is a hidden directory, to view this in Nautilus, you can press `Ctrl/âŒ˜ + H`. Alternatively, you can also place the extracted files in your `/usr/share/themes/` folder.\n\n# Flat Icons\n\n![Flat Icons](http://i.imgur.com/80qCZGQ.png)\n*Dashboard*\n\nFor icons, I use the ultra-flat-icons theme. It is available in blue (recommended), orange and mint green colors. To install this, you can run the following commands\n\n```\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:noobslab/icons\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ultra-flat-icons\n```\n\nAlternatively, you could also run `sudo apt-get install ultra-flat-icons-orange` OR `sudo apt-get install ultra-flat-icons-green`.\n\nbased on you color preference. I recommend these flat icons, but you can also look at **Numix** and **Flattr**.\n\nNow press your super key, search for **Ubuntu Tweak** and fire it. Under the tweaks tab, there is an option for theme. Under that select the **Flatabulous** theme. Under the icon settings, select **ultra-flat-icons**. Restart your computer, and you should be good to go! You computer will look something like this after you *restart*.\n\n# Screenshots\n\n![Code](http://i.imgur.com/AspVFn7.png?1)\n*Theme with Sublime Text 3 and JavaScript Code.*\n\n\n![Nautilus](http://i.imgur.com/yXB6VSa.png?1)\n*Nautilus*\n\n![Settings](http://i.imgur.com/TKTe3Mn.png?1)\n*Settings Menu*\n\n# Posters\n\nThere are a few posters, for promotion and publicity.

What is your Sublime Text theme ?**\n\n**A.** My Sublime text theme is a port of [Brogrammer](https://github.com/kenwheeler/brogrammer-theme) and [Numix](https://github.com/nauzethc/sublime-text-numix) themes, which I have tweaked a little using [this](http://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com/) awesome tool for better contrast and colors. My exact version can be found [here](https://github.com/anmoljagetia/dotfiles/blob/master/sublime/anmol.tmTheme).\n\n[**Quentin Gerodel**](https://github.com/Swizz540) has also contributed a version for [Atom](https://atom.io), which can be found [here](https://github.com/Swizz540/atom-anmol-syntax).\n\n**Q. Where can I find your wallpaper ?**\n\n**A.** This wallpaper can be found [here](http://imgur.com/nrbzQMa) and [here](https://drive.google.com/a/media.net/file/d/0B4nzxp4u7hzvVXJVeTZoY3dhSEE/view).\n\nCredits: [Meteor](https://dribbble.com/shots/1355879-Meteor-Wallpaper) by [Nina Geometrieva](https://dribbble.com/ni)\n\n**Q. What are your terminal theme and settings ?**\n\n**A.** I am presently using zsh with [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) configuration. For the colorscheme, I am using a modified version of the default tango colors, material colors and the one dark scheme.\n\nMy zsh config can be found [here](https://github.com/anmoljagetia/dotfiles/blob/master/zsh/custom/themes/anmol.zsh-theme). This works if  you have powerline fonts installed and oh-my-zsh setup. All other dotfiles can be found [here](https://github.com/anmoljagetia/dotfiles).\n\n[Here](https://gist.github.com/anmoljagetia/780945d542a27c6cf6e8) is a script that will add a new profile in gnome-terminal that mimics my terminal settings.\n\nA one liner install can be done by running the command\n\n```\nwget -O xt http://git.io/vn6HM && chmod +x xt && ./xt && rm xt\n```\n\nI have my terminal set at 10% transparency. More cool color schemes can be found [here](https://terminal.sexy), for a variety of other terminals.\n\n# License\n\n[MIT](http://anmoljagetia.mit-license.org/)\n"
