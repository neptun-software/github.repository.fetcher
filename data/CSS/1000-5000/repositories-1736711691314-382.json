As such it is constantly being updated and new featured are added. As it relates to configurations this guide tries to be as open as possible since each environment is unique and recomendations are based on these contraints as much as possible. The guide is made Open Source so that as Sysmon evolves the comunity helps in expanding and maintaining the guide. \n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease use the issues system or GitHub pull requests to make corrections, contributions, and other changes to the text - we welcome your contributions!\n\n## Credits\n\nThis guide was originally written and edited by Carlos Perez of TrustedSec LLC.\n\n- **[MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)**\n- Copyright 2020 © <a href=\"https://www.trustedsec.com/\" target=\"_blank\">TrustedSec LLC</a>.\n"
