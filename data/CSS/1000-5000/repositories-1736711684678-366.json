This results in the lowest bundle sizes and is one of the simpler approaches.\n\nWant to get a component up and running as soon as possible? Check out the [quick start guide](https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-css/blob/main/.github/QUICK-START.md).\n\n### Functionality\n\nSpectrum CSS is CSS-only, implementing only the interactivity that can be done with pure CSS. We do include some lightweight JS-based interaction for demonstration purposes only in our [Storybook](https://opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-css/). Spectrum CSS should only be used by implementations of Spectrum, or very simple applications that only need things like typography, checkboxes, text fields, etc.\n\nAdobe maintains separate libraries written with [web components](https://opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-web-components/) and [React](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-spectrum/index.html) that work in partnership with Spectrum CSS to create fully interactive Spectrum components.\n\nThe [Spectrum Web Components](https://opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-web-components/) library directly imports Spectrum CSS and optimizes it for use with web components.\n\n### Installing components\n\nEach component is released on npm as a separate, individually versioned package inside of the [@spectrum-css](https://www.npmjs.com/org/spectrum-css) org.\n\nTo incorporate Spectrum CSS into your project, you install the components you need along with any peer dependencies you need for your implementation. Most peer dependencies are optional and can bring additional features when installed along with a component. For example a button can be rendered with or without an icon; so if your use-case leverages an icon with your button, you'll want to install icon as a peer dependency.\n\n```shell\nyarn add -DW @spectrum-css/tokens @spectrum-css/typography @spectrum-css/page @spectrum-css/icon @spectrum-css/button\n```\n\nInstalled components will be available in the `node_modules/@spectrum-css/` folder of your project.\n\nAll components in this library have a peer dependency on [`@spectrum-css/tokens`](tokens), which is a local package that serves up the [Spectrum design tokens](https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-tokens) as CSS custom properties (via [Style dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/)). These custom properties are leveraged in all components to create a cohesive visual language and to allow for easy theming. If you choose not to use the provided `@spectrum-css/tokens` package, you must define your own custom properties or your components will render with a significant number of missing styles. When overriding certain styles is necessary, modifying styles is supported through the use of component-specific `--mod` prefixed properties. [More on this below](https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-css?tab=readme-ov-file#modifying-components).\n\n### Using components in your project\n\nSpectrum CSS components have build output that is designed to be used in a variety of ways:\n\n- `index.css` - _Preferred and most commonly used to incorporate Spectrum CSS into a project_. This file includes the component's styles and variable definitions. In this version, token-driven CSS properties<sup>[1](#token-footnote)</sup> are mapped to empty `--mod` prefixed variables (for customization) with a fallback to variables prefixed with `--spectrum` (sourced from the design tokens).\n\n  - This file loads both the `.spectrum` and `.spectrum--express` contexts which are used to toggle components between two different [visual styles](https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-css?tab=readme-ov-file#visual-language). The `.spectrum` context is the default.\n\n- `index-vars.css` - _Deprecated_. This file is identical to `index.css`. It is provided as a fallback for older implementations that may have been using it and will be removed. It is recommended to use `index.css` instead.\n\n- `index-base.css`: This file mimics the `index.css` output, but does not include the `.spectrum` or `.spectrum--express` contexts.\n\n  - If your product only requires the `.spectrum` context, you can use `index-base.css` plus `themes/spectrum.css` from the `themes` directory to render the default Spectrum visual language.\n    - The `.spectrum--express` context, on the other hand, is dependent on/expands on the default `.spectrum` context. This means if you only want to use the Express context, you still need to include `themes/spectrum.css`. In this case, we recommend using `index.css` instead since it includes both contexts by default.\n  - This approach can also be used when you have defined and written your own visual language and only need the base component styles from Spectrum CSS. To wire up your own visual language, you would need to define your own custom properties that match those defined in the `themes/*.css` assets.\n\n- `index-theme.css`: This file provides only the visual language for a component. It is used in conjunction with `index-base.css` and when loaded together, provides the same result as using `index.css` by itself.\n\n<sup><a name=\"token-footnote\">1</a></sup>: Token-driven CSS properties are properties whose values are mapped to a value in the `@spectrum-css/tokens` package. These values represent design-language and are meant to be used across platforms. In contrast, properties specific to web-based implementations will not have a token value assigned, so not all CSS properties will use custom properties.\n\n#### Including assets\n\nStart by including the base set of variables:\n\n```css\n/* Include tokens */\n@import \"node_modules/@spectrum-css/tokens/dist/index.css\";\n\n/*\n  For components with no other contexts available, load the\n  index.css file from the component's package. These are components\n  that do not have a spectrum or express context available.\n*/\n@import \"node_modules/@spectrum-css/page/dist/index.css\";\n@import \"node_modules/@spectrum-css/typography/dist/index.css\";\n@import \"node_modules/@spectrum-css/icon/dist/index.css\";\n\n/*\n  Recommended: For components with multiple contexts available, if you\n  want access to all contexts, load the index.css file, which includes\n  all contexts and component variables.\n*/\n@import \"node_modules/@spectrum-css/button/dist/index.css\";\n\n/*\n  If you only need the spectrum visual context: For components with\n  multiple contexts available, load only the spectrum context by sourcing\n  index-base.css and the spectrum theme from the themes directory.\n*/\n@import \"node_modules/@spectrum-css/button/dist/index-base.css\";\n@import \"node_modules/@spectrum-css/button/dist/themes/spectrum.css\";\n```\n\nTokens values are mapped to context-specific classes which can be applied to the `<html>` element or any place in your DOM where you wish to encapsulate or alter the visual language of your Spectrum components.\n\nAll contexts you want to use must be defined in order to load all the appropriate custom properties for the components you are using.\n\n#### Global variables\n\n##### Visual language\n\n- `.spectrum` - The default visual language for Spectrum CSS\n- `.spectrum--express` - A variant of the standard visual language. _This visual language will be deprecated in Spectrum 2_.\n\n##### Scales\n\nScales represent the browsing context of the user. They are used to adjust the size of components to improve readability and usability on different devices.\n\n- `.spectrum--medium` - The default scale for Spectrum CSS, used for desktop and tablet devices\n- `.spectrum--large` - A larger scale for Spectrum CSS, used for mobile devices and other small screens to create a more touch-friendly experience\n\n##### Themes (colorstops)\n\nThemes represent the color scheme of the user's browsing context. They are used to adjust the color of components to improve readability and usability in different environments.\n\n- `.spectrum--light` - The default theme for Spectrum CSS, used for light mode\n- `.spectrum--dark` - A darker theme for Spectrum CSS, used for dark mode\n\nOther themes are available but are in the process of being deprecated and should not be used in new projects.\n\n#### Context example\n\nPut together, we would define the context for our application in the following way:\n\n```html\n<html class=\"spectrum spectrum--medium spectrum--light\"></html>\n```\n\nTo switch to Express, **add** the `.spectrum--express` class to the `<html>` element:\n\n```html\n<html\n  class=\"spectrum spectrum--medium spectrum--light spectrum--express\"\n></html>\n```\n\nNote the `spectrum--express` class is added to the existing classes; `spectrum` should always be present to ensure the correct visual language is loaded.\n\nBecause CSS custom properties honor the cascading nature of CSS, you can infinitely nest different contexts. For example, you could have a `.spectrum--dark` context inside of a `.spectrum--light` context, and components will honor the innermost context.\n\n### Modifying components\n\nYou can override variables and modify Spectrum CSS' look and feel by re-defining the custom properties in context. Look for the **Custom Property API** section in each component to determine which custom properties you can override. See [Action Button for a complete example](https://opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-css/actionbutton.html#custompropertiesapi).\n\n### Importing UI icons\n\nSome components require certain \"UI icons\" to render. These icons are released within the [`@spectrum-css/ui-icons`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@spectrum-css/ui-icons) package and are used by components like `@spectrum-css/icon` and `@spectrum-css/actionbutton`.\n\nBased on [which scales](https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-css?tab=readme-ov-file#scales) you'll be using, you can choose to load different files:\n\n- `spectrum-css-icons.svg` - Both medium and large icons for responsive UIs that support both `.spectrum--medium` and `.spectrum--large`\n\n- `spectrum-css-icons-medium.svg` - Medium icons only, supports `.spectrum--medium` only\n\n- `spectrum-css-icons-large.svg` - Large icons only, supports `.spectrum--large` only\n\n**Note:** If you're using `spectrum-css-icons.svg`, be sure to add `.spectrum--medium` or `.spectrum--large` to the `<html>` element, or you'll see both medium and large icons at once.\n\n### Importing workflow icons\n\nIf your app has any level of complexity, you'll need \"workflow\" icons to indicate actions. These icons are not required to render the base components, and instead are used within buttons or menu items for actions like share, play, justify, save, etc.\n\nThese icons are released within the [`@adobe/spectrum-css-workflow-icons`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@adobe/spectrum-css-workflow-icons) package. Visit the [Spectrum workflow icon list](https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/icons/) and click on any icon to get the SVG markup.\n\n### Language support\n\nTo take advantage of locale specific changes such as placeholders not italicizing Japanese, your application should specify a [`Content-Language` response header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Language) or set the [`lang` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/lang).\n\nIn addition, you should set the `dir` attribute for components to render correctly.\n\nFor English, a left-to-right language:\n\n```html\n<html lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"></html>\n```\n\nFor Arabic, a right-to-left language:\n\n```html\n<html lang=\"ar\" dir=\"rtl\"></html>\n```\n\n### Browser support\n\nWe maintain a modern codebase that supports the latest two versions of evergreen web browsers. The current list of browsers officially supported by Spectrum CSS can be found in the browserslist section of the project's [package.json file](https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-css/blob/main/package.json). This setting is used by the build tools when the source files are built. If you require additional browser support for your project, the CSS can be processed further with your chosen tools.\n\n- latest 2 Edge versions\n- latest 2 Chrome versions\n- latest 2 Firefox versions\n- latest 2 Safari versions\n- latest 2 iOS versions\n\n### Optimizing Spectrum CSS\n\nSpectrum CSS is designed to be as modern and flexible as possible, and as such, leaves room for consumers to optimize in their own way. There are many tools and techniques you can use to optimize CSS for your project such as tree shaking, purging, and minification. If you are loading the entire set of `@spectrum-css/tokens` for example, you can safely tree shake the tokens to only include the variables you are using, often leading to a significant reduction in file size.\n\n## Contributing\n\nA very special thank you to all of our [contributors](https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-css/graphs/contributors) without whom this project would not be possible.\n\nWant to join the team?
