          "content": "# Contributing\n\n> Hey, thanks for helping! It's great that you took the time to make this project better (:\n\nTo get an overall developer view of the code you can refer to the documentation.md. Here I explain the main folders:\n\n- node_modules: where dependencies get installed from node\n- plugins: where all of the plugins are stored. Picnic is mainly made up of plugins, with little codebase otherwise.\n- releases: where the two main releases are stored and what jsdelivr.com uses to CDN the files.\n- src: the files that include the needed plugins and other files. **This is a good place to start.**\n- themes: so far there's only one default theme, but here is where other themes can go.\n- docs: where [Picnic's website](http://picnicss.com/) files reside. This is useful to see a possible workflow with using picnic.\n\n## Where to start?\n\nI recommend reading `src/picnic.scss` first. It will give you a general sense of where to find other things. Also, reading the source code for `plugins/*` is a good start.\n\n## Please lint and test\n\nLint your files with `SublimeLinter-contrib-scss-lint` for sublime text. You can see that there are some exceptions.\n\nFor testing, you just need to display some common uses of the plugin you write so it can be easily tested in different browsers.\n\n## Plugin structure\n\n- `_class.scss`: this is where the placeholder definition and variables go. [Read more about SCSS placeholders](http://thesassway.com/intermediate/understanding-placeholder-selectors) (tip: they're a really cool feature). Remember, only one placeholder per file and maximum one top level one. Like you would with any Object Oriented language.\n- `_plugin.scss`: this file should include `_class.scss` with a normal `@import 'class';` and extend the placeholder you created previously for your actual plugin. See the plugin `button` for an example.\n- `description.html`: a small description that will be included in the _plugins_ page. This is normally a highly visual example.\n- `documentation.md`: an in-depth article describing the plugin.\n- `info.json`: a file containing all of the information for your plugin. Specially important are `id`, `name`, `included`, `affected` and `summary`.\n- `test.html`: where your tests should go.\n"

[Official webpage](https://picnicss.com) (with live demo/test). \n\n\n## Getting started\n\nThere are many ways of using Picnic CSS in your projects. Here a brief introduction of the recommended two methods:\n\n\n### CDN - just give me the file\n\nUse [Picnic CSS in the CDN jsDelivr](http://www.jsdelivr.com/#!picnicss) for linking to the static file.\n\n\n### Bower - to personalize Picnic\n\nTo install Picnic with bower just write this in your terminal (you'll need bower installed):\n\n```\nbower install picnic\n```\n\nThen, to use it within your scss development cycle, just do:\n\n```scss\n// Here go any variables you want to overwrite\n$picnic-primary: #faa;\n\n// Now import picnic and a couple of plugins\n@import 'BOWER_PATH/picnic/src/picnic';\n@import 'BOWER_PATH/picnic/plugins/nav/plugin';\n@import 'BOWER_PATH/picnic/plugins/modal/plugin';\n```\n\n\n### NPM\n\nJust do\n\n```bash\nnpm install picnic --save\n```\n\nTo add it to your repository. Then you can include it straight from your css like:\n\n```css\n@import \"../node_modules/picnic/picnic.min.css\";\n```\n\nThanks to [chadoh](https://github.com/chadoh) for helping me in publishing it in NPM and for the instructions.\n\n\n\n### Other ways\n\nYou can always download the latest minimized version from github, clone the repository or download it. Or clone it: `git clone https://github.com/franciscop/picnic.git`\n\n\n\n## Wait, *invasive*?\n\nMany libraries rely upon adding classes to your already existing HTML elements, resulting in bloated code like `<button class=\"btn btn-primary\">Hey</button>`. It would be easier if the buttons knew they are, well, *buttons*. Crazy eh?\n\nThis setup works neatly for newly created projects or for pages that you have to build quick from scratch. It also allows for a much more intuitive extension of base elements.\n\n\n\n## Browser support IE11+\n\nBug reports and fixes only for IE11+. With IE8- usage [dropping *fast*](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/64250/do-websites-still-have-to-support-internet-explorer-8-and-below/#64361) and with IE9 and IE10 usage even below their older mate, it is time to start thinking about not supporting them anymore. For others, up to 2 previous versions are expected to be working, and everything that is not is definitely a bug.\n\n\n\n## Example usage\n\nAfter including the stylesheet as indicated in the `Getting started`:\n\n```html\n<form>\n  What's your favourite Picnic CSS feature?\n\n  <label>\n    <select name=\"feature\">\n      <option value=\"semantic\">    Semantic HTML5 </option>\n      <option value=\"lightweight\"> Lightweight    </option>\n      <option value=\"css3\">        Only CSS3      </option>\n      <option value=\"responsive\">  Responsive     </option>\n    </select>\n  </label>\n\n  <input type=\"email\" placeholder=\"Email to receive updates\">\n\n  <button class=\"primary\"> Subscribe! </button>\n</form>\n```\n\nIf you don't see anything that seems *picnic.css exclusive*, that's because there's nothing, that's the main purpose of Picnic CSS. However, try it out and you'll see a decent example in your browser.\n\n\n\n## Advantages\n\n- **Only CSS3** is needed and your **HTML5** stays highly semantic*.\n\n- **Under 10kb** when minimized and gzipped with all plugins.\n\n- **Normalize.css** is used as a base, achieving a solid foundation.\n\n- **Support**: IE 9+ and others. No fancy CSS3 on IE 8.\n\n- **Responsive**: The nav and the grids are responsive.\n\n\n\\* Except for the grids :(\n\n\n\n## Disadvantages\n\n- Difficult to drop in an already created project. This is what I meant by *invasive*. This is not within the new scope of the project.\n\n\n\n## Alternatives and why I still created Picnic CSS\n\n[Milligram](https://milligram.github.io/): A minimalist CSS framework\n\n[PureCSS](http://purecss.io/): Lightweight, nice package. The thing I would be using if I didn't build Picnic CSS and where I took the inspiration. However, no nice `<select>` out of the box and the non-responsive grid from the CDN feels like a stab on the back.\n\n[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/): Really comprehensive, but too many files and too heavy for most of the websites. It also relies too much on javascript. Still cannot get the `<select>` right out of the box.\n\n[Min](http://mincss.com/): a tiny, basic css framework. It has great browser support. No `<select>` right, and it's too inexpressive.\n\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nYou are encouraged to contribute to Picnic CSS. To write a new plugin, just copy one of the existing ones (specially recommend \"button\") and modify the files. The code must be linted with scss-lint, except the `PropertySortOrder` which is ignored for a better code structure.\n\n\n\n## Authors\n\nCreated by [Francisco Presencia](https://github.com/FranciscoP). SASS from [Jordan Wallwork](https://github.com/jordanwallwork). Significant fixes from [Alex Galushka](https://github.com/galulex). Tons of help in several parts of the project from [Emilio Coppola](https://github.com/Coppolaemilio).\n\n\n\n## Some love\n\n- [Clrs](http://clrs.cc/) the new nice web palette (from HN) used for Picnic CSS.\n\n- [Fontello](http://fontello.com/) an icon library that plays really nice with others.\n\n- [Normalize](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) the foundation of Picnic CSS\n"
