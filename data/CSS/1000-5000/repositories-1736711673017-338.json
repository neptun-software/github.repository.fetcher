          "content": "node-webkit-hipster-seed\n========================\n[![Gittip](http://img.shields.io/gittip/Anonyfox.png)](https://www.gittip.com/Anonyfox/)\n[![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/Anonyfox/node-webkit-hipster-seed.png)](https://gemnasium.com/Anonyfox/node-webkit-hipster-seed)\n\nBootstrap a crossplatform Desktop Application using tools you probably never heard of.\n\nIf you're familiar with the node.js world, this sketch should get you informed, if not: an [explanation](https://github.com/Anonyfox/node-webkit-hipster-seed/wiki/how-it-works) is placed [in the wiki](https://github.com/Anonyfox/node-webkit-hipster-seed/wiki). \n\n![How NWHS works](https://raw.github.com/Anonyfox/node-webkit-hipster-seed/master/docs/nwhs-draft.png)\n\n# TL;DR?\n\n- No this isn't a developer joke. It works. \n- `brunch new https://github.com/Anonyfox/node-webkit-hipster-seed MyApp` to get you started.\n- `npm run compiler` assembles your application into `/_public` and watches file changes.\n- `npm run app` starts your application locally. \n- `npm run deploy` builds your app for windows, osx and linux. the binaries are placed in `/dist` after building. \n- `bower install <frontend-module>` for any frontend-related stuff. jQuery, Angular-plugins, and so on. \n- `npm install my-module` **inside of `app/assets`** to install node.js modules. \n- see the [wiki](https://github.com/Anonyfox/node-webkit-hipster-seed/wiki) for advanced stuff.\n\n# Workflow - detailed\n\n### 0. Prerequisites\n\nYou need the following stuff installed on your machine: \n- [Node.js & NPM](http://nodejs.org/) (see the instructions for your operating system. Ensure that globally installed NPM modules are in your PATH!)\n- Windows Users: Use a Git Bash or the [PowerShell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_PowerShell) instead of CMD.exe !\n- Linux Users: You may have to do a [symlink](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit/wiki/The-solution-of-lacking-libudev.so.0). \n- Git. (Brunch and Bower depend on Git to work.) Windows users: try [this](http://git-scm.com/), there is a good usable CLI included which should work with the workflow out-of-the-box. The primitive CMD.exe is currently NOT supported. \n- [Brunch](http://brunch.io/) via a global npm installation: `npm install -g brunch`.\n- [Bower](http://bower.io/) via a global npm installation: `npm install -g bower`.\n\n### 1. Bootstrap a new Desktop App!\n\n```\nbrunch new https://github.com/Anonyfox/node-webkit-hipster-seed MyApp\n```\n\n*This may take a few minutes depending on your hardware and internet connection, since this git repo will be cloned, a bunch of npm modules will be installed, including the somewhat big [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit), and several bower modules afterwards.*\n\n**Currently there is a bug within the nodewebkit package.** You have to rename\n`node_modules/nodewebkit/package.json` to `node_modules/nodewebkit/_package.json`\n\n### 2. Develop an AngularJS App on Steroids!\n\n`cd MyApp`. Place your typical application code under `/app`. So: \n\n- `/app/styles` contains all your stylesheets as LESS files. You may look into `/app/styles/app.less` when fine-tuning your included CSS-related components.\n- `/app/scripts` is the folder for your coffeescript application logic, especially your AngularJS stuff. The mighty AngularJS main-module is defined in `/app/app.coffee` and includes the angular module loader and the url routing definitions. \n- `/app/partials` contains your Jade templates which are compiled and merged into an AngularJS template module. The main index file is located at `/app/index.jade` and will be compiled to an actual `index.html` file.\n- `/app/assets` is the catch-all directory for everything else, like images or fonts. The whole directory, including the folder-hierarchy, is copied **as is** into the final application folder. *If you want to use npm modules inside your application, install them here, and NOT in the toplevel folder!* Also, the `/app/assets/package.json` is used to describe and build your application, NOT the toplevel `/package.json`!\n\n*The App-level structure is basically the same as [angular-brunch-seed](https://github.com/scotch/angular-brunch-seed).*\n\nAll this assembling stuff is managed for you automatically when you run the following command: \n\n```npm run compiler```\n\nWhile this task is running, every change in your `/app` folder triggers an efficient partial rebuild of the relevant files. Any `bower install <frontend-module>` triggers this, too. \n\nTo run your app locally, just enter: \n\n```npm run app```\n\n### 3. Add more modules and plugins!\n\nGone are the days of drag'n'droppin' your jQuery plugins from diverse websites into your script folders. Just use [Bower](http://bower.io/) for anything \"browser related\". Think of it as a NPM for the frontend. Any components installed by bower are saved in `bower_components` and automatically inserted in the compilation process. \n\n### 4. Test ALL the things!\n\nSince your desktop application is basically just an AngularJS app, you can use [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.10/index.html), which is especially written for testing AngularJS apps end-to-end. *(ToDo: configure karma to fire up node-webkit instead of chromium.)*\n\n### 5. Deploy your App!\n\nWhen you're done building your awesome app, just type \n\n```npm run deploy```\n\nand you'll have your final application folders located in `/dist` for each major operating system. When performing this task the first time, it'll take several minutes to download the necessary node-webkit binaries per target system. \n\n*So far only tested on OSX and Windows 7/8. The application icon and several minor features still require some work, have a look at [grunt-node-webkit-builder](https://github.com/mllrsohn/grunt-node-webkit-builder) if you want to give a helping hand.*\n\n#Licence\n\n**MIT.** You can assign any licence you want to your built apps, however you should pick the GPL if you are awesome *([like lighttable did](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7024626))*. \n\n#Feedback\n\n- Just use the issues section to discuss features or report bugs.\n- There is a thread on [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7094465) and one on [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1vumf5/workflow_for_frontend_developers_to_create/). \n- If you have general questions not related to this project, you may tweet to [@Hisako1337](https://twitter.com/Hisako1337) (that's me.).\n\n#Donate!\n\nIf you like what you see, feel free to tip me some DOGECOIN. Much App. Wow!\n`D6M5ibT5CUe14yWRt8ZmVQkwzp8icio5Yc`\n"
