The documentation source files that Docbox uses are friendly for documentation authors and free of presentational code: it's Markdown.\n\n[![](https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1534/24963539843_e26a00b3e1_b.jpg)](https://67-53007065-gh.circle-artifacts.com/0/tmp/circle-artifacts.NCC9T6a/index.html#our-api)\n\n_[Demo documentation](https://67-53007065-gh.circle-artifacts.com/0/tmp/circle-artifacts.NCC9T6a/index.html#our-api)_\n\n**Docbox is a JavaScript application written with React.** The core magic is thanks to the [remark](http://remark.js.org/) Markdown parser, which enables the layout: after parsing a file into an [Abstract Syntax Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree), we can move examples to the right, prose to the left, and build the navigation system.\n\n**It has a supercharged test suite**. Our tests check for everything from broken links to invalid examples and structure problems: this way, the application is only concerned with output and you can proactively enforce consistency and correctness. We even extract JavaScript examples from documentation and test them with [eslint](http://eslint.org/)\n\n**When you're ready to ship**, Docbox's `build` task minifies JavaScript and uses React's server rendering code to make documentation indexable for search engines and viewable without JavaScript.\n\n## Writing Documentation\n\nDocumentation is written as Markdown files in the `content` directory, and is organized by the `src/custom/content.js` file - that file requires each documentation page and puts them in order. This demo has a little bit of content - [content/example.md](content/example.md) and [content/introduction.md](content/introduction.md), so that there's an example to follow.\n\n## Testing-driven\n\nDocbox's test suite is an integral part of the design: it's designed to catch any error that would produce invalid documentation and also designed to be extended with custom rules for your documentation standards. Remember to run `npm test` if anything looks funky, and if you have a standard you want to enforce, to enforce it automatically by writing a test!\n\n## Customization\n\nAll custom code - code that relates to brands and specifics of APIs - is in the `./src/custom` directory. Content is [src/custom/content.js](custom/content.js) and brand names & tweaks are in [src/custom/index.js](src/custom/index.js), with inline documentation for both.\n\n## Development\n\nWe care about the ease of writing documentation. Docbox comes with batteries included: after you `npm install` the project, you can run `npm start` and its development server, [budo](https://github.com/mattdesl/budo), will serve the website locally and update automatically.\n\n### Requirements\n\n* Node v4 or higher\n* NPM\n* Git\n\nTo run the site locally:\n\n1. Clone this repository\n2. `git clone https://github.com/tmcw/docbox.git`\n3. `npm install`\n4. `npm start`\n5. Open http://localhost:9966/\n\n## Tests\n\nTests cover both the source code of Docbox as well as the content in the `content/` directory.\n\nTo run tests:\n\n1. Clone this repository\n2. `git clone https://github.com/tmcw/docbox.git`\n3. `npm install`\n4. `npm test`\n\n\n## Deployment\n\nThe `npm run build` command builds a `bundle.js` file that contains all the JavaScript code and content needed to show the site, and creates an `index.html` file that already contains the site content. Note that this _replaces_ the existing `index.html` file, so it's best to run this only when deploying the site and to undo changes to `index.html` if you want to keep working on content.\n\n1. Clone this repository\n2. `git clone https://github.com/tmcw/docbox.git`\n3. `npm install`\n4. `npm run build`\n\n---\n\n### Using docbox\n\n* [Mapbox API Documentation](https://www.mapbox.com/api-documentation/)\n* Mapillary uses docbox for [API Documentation](https://www.mapillary.com/developer/api-documentation/) and [Tiles Documentation](https://www.mapillary.com/developer/tiles-documentation/)\n* The open source [Project OSRM](http://project-osrm.org/docs/v5.10.0/api/#general-options) routing engine uses Docbox for its API documentation.\n* [8th Wall](https://docs.8thwall.com/) uses Docbox for the documentation of their AR product\n* [HYCON](https://docs.hycon.io/#introduction) documents their REST API for a blockchain with Docbox\n* _[do you use docbox? let us know!](https://github.com/tmcw/docbox/issues/new?title=I%27m%20using%20docbox!)_\n\n### [FAQ & See Also](https://github.com/mapbox/docbox/wiki)\n\nProps to [Tripit's Slate project](https://github.com/tripit/slate), which served\nas the inspiration for Docbox's layout. We also maintain a [list of similar projects](https://github.com/tmcw/docbox/wiki).\n"
