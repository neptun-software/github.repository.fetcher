Intentionally\nthemed to look like a Square merchant page on the directory.\n\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n\n### Run the site locally\n```bash\ngem install bundler # first time only\nbundle install # first time only\nbundle exec jekyll serve\n```\n\n\n### Update list of repos:\n```bash\npip install pystache requests pygithub3 # first time only\n./generate.py\n```\n\nAbout the code\n-----------\nDue to the use of absolute URLs in CSS files that are (essentially) out of our\ncontrol, the easiest way to develop is by running with Jekyll.\n\nRepositories are listed in the `repos.json` file as a map of repository names\nto a list of their categories. Invoking the `generate.py` script will update\nthe `index.html` page with the latest repos by using the `index.mustache` file\nas a template.\n\nRepository data is pulled via the GitHub API (e.g., website). By default the\nscript performs unauthenticated requests, so it's easy to run up against\nGitHub's limit of [60 unauthenticated requests per\nhour](http://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting). To make authenticated\nrequests and work around the rate-limiting, add an entry for api.github.com to\nyour ~/.netrc file, preferably with a Personal Access Token from\nhttps://github.com/settings/tokens\n\n    machine api.github.com\n      login YourUsername\n      password PersonalAccessToken\n\nImages are loaded by convention from the `repo_images/` directory. Ensure the\nname is the same as the repo name in the `repos.json` file and has a `.jpg`\nextension. Currently all images are rotated 10 degrees counter-clockwise to\nbreak up the overwhelming horizontal and vertical visual lines on the page.\n\n## License\n\n```plaintext\nCopyright 2021 Square Inc.\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n```\n"
