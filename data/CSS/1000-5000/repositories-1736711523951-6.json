How to fix it?\n\nUnfortunately, this is quite common. I listed some possible fixes [in this document](npm-fixes.md).\n\n### Q3: I'm stuck in one of the projects. Where do I get help?\n\n**A:** Have you actually tried to fix the problem on your own? Have you compared your code to the final code? If you failed fixing your problem, please **post a detailed description of the problem to the Q&A area of that video over at Udemy**, along with a [codepen](https://codepen.io/pen/) containing your code. You will get help there. Please don't send me a personal message or email to fix coding problems.\n\n### Q4: You keep mentioning your resources page. Where can I find it?\n\n**A:** It's on my website at <http://codingheroes.io/resources>. You can subscribe for updates ðŸ˜‰\n\n### Q5: What VSCode theme are you using?\n\n**A:** I use Oceanic Next (dimmed bg) for all my coding and course production. [Here is my complete VSCode setup](vscode-setup.md).\n\n### Q6: You use codepens in some of the lectures. Where can I find them?\n\n**A:** They are all available on my [public codepen profile](https://codepen.io/jonasschmedtmann/pens/public/). The ones you're looking for might be buried under some newer ones.\n\n### Q7: Can I see a final version of the course projects?\n\n**A:** Sure, I have an online version of all three. Here they are: [Natours](https://natours.netlify.com) (advanced CSS, Sass and responsive design), [Trillo](http://trillo.netlify.com/) (flexbox) and [Nexter](https://nexter.netlify.com/) (CSS Grid).\n\n### Q8: Videos don't load, can you fix it?\n\n**A:** Unfortunately, there is nothing I can do about it. The course is hosted on Udemy, and sometimes they have technical issues like this. Please just come back a bit later or [contact their support team](https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us).\n\n### Q9: Videos are blurred / have low quality, can you fix it?\n\n**A:** Please open video settings and change the quality from 'Auto' to another value, for example 720p. If that doesn't help, please [contact the Udemy support team](https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us).\n\n### Q10: Are the videos downloadable?\n\n**A:** Yes! I made all videos downloadable from Udemy so you can learn even without an internet connection. To download a video, use the settings icon in the right bottom corner of the video player. Videos have to be downloaded individually.\n\n### Q11: I want to put these projects in my portfolio. Is that allowed?\n\n**A:** Absolutely! Just make sure you actually built them yourself by following the course, and that you understand what you did. What is **not allowed** is that you create your own course/videos/articles based on this course's content!\n\n### Q12: I love your courses and want to get updates on new courses. How?\n\n**A:** First, you can subscribe to my email list [at my website](http://codingheroes.io/resources). Plus, I make important announcements on twitter [@jonasschmedtman](https://twitter.com/jonasschmedtman), so you should definitely follow me there ðŸ”¥\n\n### Q13: How do I get my certificate of completion?\n\n**A:** A certificate of completion is provided by Udemy after you complete 100% of the course. After completing the course, just click on the \"Your progress\" indicator in the top right-hand corner of the course page. If you want to change your name on the certificate, please [contact the Udemy support team](https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us).\n\n### Q13: Do you accept pull requests?\n\n**A:** No, for the simple reason that I want this repository to contain the _exact_ same code that is shown in the videos. However, please feel free to add an issue if you found one.\n"

          "content": "# Possible fixes for common problems with NPM packages\n\n## Q1: My Sass isn't compiling at all or the `-w` flag is not working\n\n### Solution 1\n\nThis may be because you're using a different `node-sass` version than the one I use in the videos. Please uninstall `node-sass` with:\n\n`npm uninstall node-sass --save-dev`\n\nThen install version `4.5.3` with;\n\n`npm install node-sass@4.5.3 --save-dev`.\n\n### Solution 2\n\nThis is more of a workaround if Solution 1 doesn't work. You can install a package called `nodemon` to run node.js code directly. Install it with:\n\n`npm install nodemon --save-dev`\n\nThen in the `package.json` file, add the following tasks:\n\n```\n\"compile:sass\": \"node-sass sass/main.scss css/style.comp.css\"\n\"watch:sass\": \"nodemon -e scss -x \\\"npm run compile:sass\\\"\"\n```\n\n### Solution 3\n\nIf you're using VSCode, the defualt autosave setting is that it saves your file each time you stroke a key. This made me run into some errors in the videos. The fix is to change the autosave setting to `onFocusChange`. You can do so by copying the following instruction to the settings (panel on the right side):\n\n`\"files.autoSave\": \"onFocusChange\"`\n\n## Q2: Autoprefixer isn't working on Windows\n\nOn Windows you will have to escape the `\"` in the autoprefixer task, just like this:\n\n`\"prefix:css\": \"postcss --use autoprefixer -b \\\"last 10 versions\\\" css/style.concat.css -o css/style.prefix.css\"`\n\n## Q3: General problems\n\nIf your NPM packages don't work at all, please make sure you have at least node `v6.x.x` installed on your computer. You can check your version with `node -v`.\n\nYou can also try setting all your NPM packages to the same versions used in the videos. It works like described in **Q1** of this document (`node-sass` example). These are the versions I used in the videos:\n\n```\n\"autoprefixer\": \"^7.1.4\",\n\"concat\": \"^1.0.3\",\n\"node-sass\": \"^4.5.3\",\n\"npm-run-all\": \"^4.1.1\",\n\"postcss-cli\": \"^4.1.1\"\n```\n\n**I will keep this document updated if more issues arise.**"
