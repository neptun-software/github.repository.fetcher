You can simply view the interface. If you want to use the local model, please download and use it on your own.\n```\n\n### Other Function Examples\n[Video Demonstration](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1zH4y1h7Y9/)\n\n## ❓How to get started?\n\nHere I am using Postgres as the data and vector storage because Semantic Kernel and Kernel Memory support it, but you can also use other options.\n\nThe model by default supports the local model of openai, azure openai, and llama. If you need to use other models, you can integrate them using one-api.\n\nThe Login configuration in the configuration file is the default login account and password.\n\nThe following configuration file needs to be configured\n\n## 1️⃣Using docker-compose\n\nProvided the pg version **appsettings.json** and simplified version (Sqlite+disk) **docker-compose.simple.yml**\n\nDownload **docker-compose.yml** from the project root directory and place the configuration file **appsettings.json** in the same directory.\n\nThe pg image has already been prepared. You can modify the default username and password in docker-compose.yml, and then the database connection in your **appsettings.json** needs to be consistent.\n\nThen you can execute the following command in the directory to start AntSK\n```\ndocker-compose up -d\n```\n\n## 2️⃣How to mount local models and model download directory in docker\n```\n# Non-host version, do not use local proxy\nversion: '3.8'\nservices:\n  antsk:\n    container_name: antsk\n    image: registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/AIDotNet/antsk:v0.5.0\n    ports:\n      - 5000:5000\n    networks:\n      - antsk\n    depends_on:\n      - antskpg\n    restart: always\n    environment:\n      - ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://*:5000\n    volumes:\n      - ./appsettings.json:/app/appsettings.json # Local configuration file needs to be placed in the same directory\n      - D://model:/app/model\nnetworks:\n  antsk:\n```\nTaking this as an example, it means mounting the local D://model folder of Windows into the container /app/model. If so, the model address in your appsettings.json should be configured as\n\n[LiteDockerCompose](https://github.com/AIDotNet/AntSK/blob/main/docker-compose.simple.yml)\n\nThe compact version is deployed with sqlite-disk by one click\n\n[FullDockerCompose](https://github.com/AIDotNet/AntSK/blob/main/docker-compose.yml)\n\nThe full version uses pg+aspire\n\n\n## 3️⃣Some meanings of configuration file\n```\n{\n  \"DBConnection\": {\n    \"DbType\": \"Sqlite\",\n    \"ConnectionStrings\": \"Data Source=AntSK.db;\"\n  },\n  \"KernelMemory\": {\n    \"VectorDb\": \"Disk\",\n    \"ConnectionString\": \"Host=;Port=;Database=antsk;Username=;Password=\",\n    \"TableNamePrefix\": \"km-\"\n  },\n  \"FileDir\": {\n    \"DirectoryPath\": \"D:\\\\git\\\\AntBlazor\\\\model\"\n  },\n  \"Login\": {\n    \"User\": \"admin\",\n    \"Password\": \"xuzeyu\"\n  },\n  \"BackgroundTaskBroker\": {\n    \"ImportKMSTask\": {\n      \"WorkerCount\": 1 \n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n```\n// Supports various databases, you can check SqlSugar, MySql, SqlServer, Sqlite, Oracle, PostgreSQL, Dm, Kdbndp, Oscar, MySqlConnector, Access, OpenGauss, QuestDB, HG, ClickHouse, GBase, Odbc, OceanBaseForOracle, TDengine, GaussDB, OceanBase, Tidb, Vastbase, PolarDB, Custom\nDBConnection.DbType\n\n// Connection string, need to use the corresponding string according to the different DB types\nDBConnection.ConnectionStrings\n\n//The type of vector storage, supporting Postgres, Disk, Memory, Qdrant, Redis, AzureAISearch\n//Postgres and Redis require ConnectionString configuration\n//The ConnectionString of Qdrant and AzureAISearch uses Endpoint | APIKey\nKernelMemory.VectorDb\n\n//Local model path, used for quick selection of models under llama, as well as saving downloaded models.\nFileDir.DirectoryPath\n\n//Default admin account password\nLogin\n\n//Import asynchronous processing thread count. A higher count can be used for online API, but for local models, 1 is recommended to avoid memory overflow issues.\nBackgroundTaskBroker.ImportKMSTask.WorkerCount\n\n```\n\n## ⚠️Fixing Style Issues:\nRun the following in AntSK/src/AntSK:\n```\ndotnet clean\ndotnet build\ndotnet publish \"AntSK.csproj\"\n```\nThen navigate to AntSK/src/AntSK/bin/Release/net8.0/publish and run:\n```\ndotnet AntSK.dll\n```\nThe styles should now be applied after starting.\n\nI'm using CodeFirst mode for the database, so as long as the database connection is properly configured, the table structure will be created automatically.\n\n## ✔️Using llamafactory\n```\n1. First, ensure that Python and pip are installed in your environment. This step is not necessary if using an image, such as version v0.2.3.2, which already includes the complete Python environment.\n2. Go to the model add page and select llamafactory.\n3. Click \"Initialize\" to check whether the 'pip install' environment setup is complete.\n4. Choose a model that you like.\n5. Click \"Start\" to begin downloading the model from the tower. This may involve a somewhat lengthy wait.\n6. After the model has finished downloading, enter http://localhost:8000/ in the request address. The default port is 8000.\n7. Click \"Save\" and start chatting.\n8. Many people ask about the difference between LLamaSharp and llamafactory. In fact, LLamaSharp is a .NET implementation of llama.cpp, but only supports local gguf models, while llamafactory supports a wider variety of models and uses Python implementation. The main difference lies here. Additionally, llamafactory has the ability to fine-tune models, which is an area we will focus on integrating in the future.\n```\n\n## 💕 Contributors\n\nThis project exists thanks to all the people who contribute.\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/AIDotNet/AntSK/graphs/contributors\">\n  <img src=\"https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=AIDotNet/AntSK&max=1000&columns=15&anon=1\" />\n</a>\n\n## 🚨  Use Protocol\n\nThis warehouse follows the [AntSK License](https://github.com/AIDotNet/AntSK?tab=Apache-2.0-1-ov-file) open source protocol.\n\nThis project follows the Apache 2.0 agreement, in addition to the following additional terms\n\n1.
