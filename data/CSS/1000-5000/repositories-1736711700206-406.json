But IMHO it looks a bit outdated.\n\nThis theme is an attempt to update the visuals of Doxygen without changing its overall layout too much.\n\n## Features\n\n- 🌈 Clean, modern design\n- 🚀 Heavily customizable by adjusting CSS variables\n- 🧩 No changes to the HTML structure of Doxygen are required\n- 📱 Improved mobile usability\n- 🌘 Dark mode support!\n- 🥇 Works best with **doxygen 1.9.1** - **1.9.4** and **1.9.6** - **1.12.0**\n\n## Examples\n\nSome websites using this theme:\n\n- [Documentation of this repository](https://jothepro.github.io/doxygen-awesome-css/)\n- [wxWidgets](https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.2/)\n- [OpenCV 5.x](https://docs.opencv.org/5.x/)\n- [Zephyr](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/doxygen/html/index.html)\n- [FELTOR](https://mwiesenberger.github.io/feltor/dg/html/modules.html)\n- [Spatial Audio Framework (SAF)](https://leomccormack.github.io/Spatial_Audio_Framework/index.html)\n- [Randolf Richardson's C++ classes](https://www.randolf.ca/c++/docs/)\n- [libCloudSync](https://jothepro.github.io/libCloudSync/)\n- [libsl3](https://a4z.github.io/libsl3/)\n\n## Installation\n\nTo use the theme when generating your documentation, bring the required CSS and JS files from this repository into your project.\n\nThis can be done in several ways:\n\n- manually copying the files\n- adding the project as a Git submodule\n- downloading the project with CMake FetchContent\n- adding the project as a npm/xpm dependency\n- installing the theme system-wide\n\nAll theme files are located in the root of this repository and start with the prefix `doxygen-awesome-`. You may not need all of them. Follow the install instructions to figure out what files are required for your setup.\n\n### Git submodule\nFor projects that use git, add the repository as a submodule and check out the desired release:\n\n```sh\ngit submodule add https://github.com/jothepro/doxygen-awesome-css.git\ncd doxygen-awesome-css\ngit checkout v2.3.4\n```\n\n### CMake with FetchContent\n\nFor project that build with CMake, the `FetchContent` module can be used to download the repository at configure-time.\n\nAdd the following snippet to your `CMakeLists.txt`\n\n```cmake\ninclude(FetchContent)\nFetchContent_Declare(\n    doxygen-awesome-css\n    URL https://github.com/jothepro/doxygen-awesome-css/archive/refs/heads/main.zip\n)\nFetchContent_MakeAvailable(doxygen-awesome-css)\n\n# Save the location the files were cloned into\n# This allows us to get the path to doxygen-awesome.css\nFetchContent_GetProperties(doxygen-awesome-css SOURCE_DIR AWESOME_CSS_DIR)\n\n# Generate the Doxyfile\nset(DOXYFILE_IN ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/doc/Doxyfile.in)\nset(DOXYFILE_OUT ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/Doxyfile)\nconfigure_file(${DOXYFILE_IN} ${DOXYFILE_OUT} @ONLY)\n```\n\nThis downloads the latest main (but any other revision could be used) and unpacks in the build folder. The `Doxyfile.in` can reference this location in the `HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET` field\n\n```text\nHTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET  = @AWESOME_CSS_DIR@/doxygen-awesome.css\n```\n\nWhen the configure stage of CMake is run, the `Doxyfile.in` is rendered to Doxyfile and Doxygen can be run as usual.\n\n### npm/xpm dependency\n\nIn the npm ecosystem, this project can be added as a development dependency\nto your project:\n\n```sh\ncd your-project\nnpm install https://github.com/jothepro/doxygen-awesome-css#v2.3.4 --save-dev\n\nls -l node_module/@jothepro/doxygen-awesome-css\n```\n\nSimilarly, in the [xPack](https://xpack.github.io) ecosystem, this project can be added\nas a development dependency to an [`xpm`](https://xpack.github.io/xpm/)\nmanaged project.\n\n### System-wide\n\nYou can even install the theme system-wide by running `make install`.\nThe files will be installed to `/usr/local/share/` by default,\nbut you can customize the install location with `make PREFIX=/my/custom/path install`.\n\n### Choosing a layout\n\nThere are two layout options. Choose one of them and configure Doxygen accordingly:\n\n<div class=\"tabbed\">\n\n- <b class=\"tab-title\">Base Theme</b><div class=\"darkmode_inverted_image\">\n    ![](img/theme-variants-base.drawio.svg)\n    </div>\n    Comes with the typical Doxygen titlebar. Optionally the treeview in the sidebar can be enabled.\n\n    Required files: `doxygen-awesome.css`\n\n    Required `Doxyfile` configuration:\n    ```\n    GENERATE_TREEVIEW      = YES # optional. Also works without treeview\n    DISABLE_INDEX = NO\n    FULL_SIDEBAR = NO\n    HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET  = doxygen-awesome-css/doxygen-awesome.css\n    HTML_COLORSTYLE        = LIGHT # required with Doxygen >= 1.9.5\n    ```\n\n- <b class=\"tab-title\">Sidebar-Only Theme</b><div class=\"darkmode_inverted_image\">\n    ![](img/theme-variants-sidebar-only.drawio.svg)\n    </div>\n    Hides the top titlebar to give more space to the content. The treeview must be enabled in order for this theme to work.\n\n    Required files: `doxygen-awesome.css`, `doxygen-awesome-sidebar-only.css`\n\n    Required `Doxyfile` configuration:\n    ```\n\n    GENERATE_TREEVIEW      = YES # required!\n    DISABLE_INDEX          = NO\n    FULL_SIDEBAR           = NO\n    HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET  = doxygen-awesome-css/doxygen-awesome.css \\\n                            doxygen-awesome-css/doxygen-awesome-sidebar-only.css\n    HTML_COLORSTYLE        = LIGHT # required with Doxygen >= 1.9.5\n    ```\n\n</div>\n\n<br>\n\n@warning\n- This theme is not compatible with the `FULL_SIDEBAR = YES` option provided by Doxygen!\n- `HTML_COLORSTYLE` must be set to `LIGHT` since Doxygen 1.9.5!\n\n### Further installation instructions\n\n- [Installing extensions](docs/extensions.md)\n- [Customizing the theme (colors, spacing, border-radius, ...)](docs/customization.md)\n- [Tips and Tricks for further configuration](docs/tricks.md)\n\n## Browser support\n\nTested with\n\n- Chrome 119, Chrome 119 for Android, Chrome 119 for iOS\n- Safari 17, Safari for iOS 16\n- Firefox 118, Firefox 120 for Android, Firefox 119 for iOS\n- Edge 119\n- Opera 108\n\n\nThe theme does not strive to be backward compatible with (significantly) older browser versions.\n\n\n## Credits\n\nThanks for all the bug reports and inspiring feedback on GitHub!\n\nSpecial thanks to all the contributors:\n<br><br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jothepro/doxygen-awesome-css/graphs/contributors\">\n    <img src=\"https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=jothepro/doxygen-awesome-css\" />\n</a>\n\n\n<div class=\"section_buttons\">\n\n|                        Read Next |\n|---------------------------------:|\n| [Extensions](docs/extensions.md) |\n\n</div>\n"
