This website provides you with wordlists that are up to date and effective against the most popular technologies on the internet.\n\nWordlists are generated on the 28th of each month, using [Commonspeak2](https://github.com/assetnote/commonspeak2/) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/assetnote/wordlists/actions). If there's an extension or technology that you would like a wordlist for, but it's not included in this repo, [send us a PR](https://github.com/assetnote/wordlists/blob/master/.github/workflows/wordlists.yml) and it will be included on this page after the next run.\n\nAssetnote Continuous Security automatically maps your external assets and monitors them for changes and security issues to help prevent serious breaches.

These wordlists are then committed to a web server being served through Cloudflare (CDN).\n\nAs a part of the GitHub actions, JSON files are generated using the [gen-json.py](https://github.com/assetnote/wordlists/blob/master/gen-json.py) script. These JSON files are also pushed to the repo, and then are loaded in [index.html](https://github.com/assetnote/wordlists/blob/master/index.html) using [DataTables](https://datatables.net/).\n\nCredits\n-------\n\n- [cqsd](https://github.com/cqsd/daily-commonspeak2) for his initial work on automating Commonspeak2 with GitHub actions.\n- [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Discovery/Web-Content) for their excellent wordlists for content discovery.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n```\n   Copyright 2020 Assetnote\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License.\n```\n\n[Assetnote Pty.
