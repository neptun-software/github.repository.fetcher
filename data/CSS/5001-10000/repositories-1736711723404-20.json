Beyond this, we try to\nlimit discussions to those which focus on problems that will be dealt with in\nthe next version of JSON:API. A roadmap can be found on the [about] section of\nour website.\n\nThe ideal world we are shooting for is an empty issue tracker on release days.\n\n## Discussion Forum\n> http://discuss.jsonapi.org\n\nOur discussion forum is where general conversations about JSON:API should take\nplace. Ideas for new extensions and questions about how to correctly implement\nor consume an API that adheres to the JSON:API specification belong here.\n\n[about]: http://jsonapi.org/about\n\n## JSON Schema\nIf you would like to update the JSON schemas, you must first install the node.js dependencies :\n\n`\nnpm install\n`\n\nThen you can run the schema validator by running one of the following commands :\n\n`\nnode ./_schemas/scripts/validator.js\n`\n\nor\n\n`\nnpm run test-schema\n`\n\nThis script validates all test files against all available versions of the specification.\nSome options can be used :\n- `--verbose` : allows more verbose output.\n- `-f relative-path` : the relative path of the only file to test. For example : `npm run test-schema -- -f _schemas/1.0/response/valid/with_success/complete.json`\n- `-v version` : the version of the specification to use to test the files. For example : `npm run test-schema -- -v 1.0`\n"

Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and Related Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nthe right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;\nmoral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\npublicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;\nrights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\nrights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;\ndatabase rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\nother similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.\n2.

Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n\n3. Public License Fallback.

Clients built around JSON:API are\nable to take advantage of its features around efficiently caching responses,\nsometimes eliminating network requests entirely.\n\nHere's an example response from a blog that implements JSON:API:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"links\": {\n    \"self\": \"http://example.com/articles\",\n    \"next\": \"http://example.com/articles?page[offset]=2\",\n    \"last\": \"http://example.com/articles?page[offset]=10\"\n  },\n  \"data\": [{\n    \"type\": \"articles\",\n    \"id\": \"1\",\n    \"attributes\": {\n      \"title\": \"JSON:API paints my bikeshed!\"\n    },\n    \"relationships\": {\n      \"author\": {\n        \"links\": {\n          \"self\": \"http://example.com/articles/1/relationships/author\",\n          \"related\": \"http://example.com/articles/1/author\"\n        },\n        \"data\": { \"type\": \"people\", \"id\": \"9\" }\n      },\n      \"comments\": {\n        \"links\": {\n          \"self\": \"http://example.com/articles/1/relationships/comments\",\n          \"related\": \"http://example.com/articles/1/comments\"\n        },\n        \"data\": [\n          { \"type\": \"comments\", \"id\": \"5\" },\n          { \"type\": \"comments\", \"id\": \"12\" }\n        ]\n      }\n    },\n    \"links\": {\n      \"self\": \"http://example.com/articles/1\"\n    }\n  }],\n  \"included\": [{\n    \"type\": \"people\",\n    \"id\": \"9\",\n    \"attributes\": {\n      \"firstName\": \"Dan\",\n      \"lastName\": \"Gebhardt\",\n      \"twitter\": \"dgeb\"\n    },\n    \"links\": {\n      \"self\": \"http://example.com/people/9\"\n    }\n  }, {\n    \"type\": \"comments\",\n    \"id\": \"5\",\n    \"attributes\": {\n      \"body\": \"First!\"\n    },\n    \"relationships\": {\n      \"author\": {\n        \"data\": { \"type\": \"people\", \"id\": \"2\" }\n      }\n    },\n    \"links\": {\n      \"self\": \"http://example.com/comments/5\"\n    }\n  }, {\n    \"type\": \"comments\",\n    \"id\": \"12\",\n    \"attributes\": {\n      \"body\": \"I like XML better\"\n    },\n    \"relationships\": {\n      \"author\": {\n        \"data\": { \"type\": \"people\", \"id\": \"9\" }\n      }\n    },\n    \"links\": {\n      \"self\": \"http://example.com/comments/12\"\n    }\n  }]\n}\n```\n\nThe response above contains the first in a collection of \"articles\", as well as\nlinks to subsequent members in that collection. It also contains resources\nlinked to the article, including its author and comments. Last but not least,\nlinks are provided that can be used to fetch or update any of these\nresources.\n\nJSON:API covers creating and updating resources as well, not just responses.\n\n## <a href=\"#mime-types\" id=\"mime-types\" class=\"headerlink\"></a> MIME Types\n\nJSON:API has been properly registered with the IANA. Its media\ntype designation is [`application/vnd.api+json`](http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/vnd.api+json).\n\n## <a href=\"#format-documentation\" id=\"format-documentation\" class=\"headerlink\"></a> Format documentation\n\nTo get started with JSON:API, check out [documentation for the base\nspecification](/format).\n\n## <a href=\"#extensions\" id=\"extensions\" class=\"headerlink\"></a> Extensions\n\nThe JSON:API community has created a collection of extensions that APIs can use\nto provide clients with information or functionality beyond that described in the\nbase JSON:API specification. These extensions are called profiles.\n\nYou can [browse existing profiles](/extensions/#existing-profiles) or\n[create a new one](/extensions/#profile-creation).\n\n## <a href=\"#milestones\" id=\"milestones\" class=\"headerlink\"></a> Milestones\n\nMajor milestones for this specification include:\n\n- 2022-09-30: 1.1 final released.\n- 2015-05-29: 1.0 final released.\n- 2013-07-21: Media type registration completed with the IANA.\n- 2013-05-03: Initial release of the draft.\n\nA more thorough history is available [here](/about/#update-history).\n\nYou can subscribe to an RSS feed of individual changes [here](https://github.com/json-api/json-api/commits.atom).\n"

Or, if your\nextension defines a \"type\" key, it should use that key as JSON API does\n(i.e. to hold a string indicating a resource's type).\n"
