However, you *should* override\nthe rule so that your change is explicit, and so that your source maps\naccurately indicate your changes coming from your files.\n\n### 3.3.0 (March 3, 2016)\n\n- Added: `b` and `strong` normalization\n- Added: `::-moz-focus-inner` normalization\n- Added: `hr` normalization\n- Added: `svg` fill as the current color\n- Updated: Organized rules into normalization, universal inheritance,\n           opinionated defaults, and configurable defaults\n- Updated: Moved source and compiled libraries\n\n### 3.2.0 (February 3, 2016)\n\n- Added: `selection.less`\n- Updated: Use `root`-prefixed values across all formats\n- Updated: Documentation\n\n## 3.1.1 (February 1, 2016)\n\n- Updated: `box-sizing` variable corrected to `border-box` in sass, scss, styl\n\n### 3.1.0 (February 1, 2016)\n\n- Added: Project configuration (.editorconfig)\n- Added: Style linting rules and tests\n- Added: `touch-action: manipulation` to remove delays during mobile tapping\n- Removed: `text-rendering` due to performance issues\n- Updated: `::selection` color variable corrected to `--selection-color`\n- Updated: Use direct nesting\n\n### 3.0.0 (October 23, 2015)\n\n- Added: Normalization for **iOS 8+**\n- Added: `background-repeat` for all elements\n- Added: CONTRIBUTING.md\n- Updated: background color and color for `:root` previously `html`\n- Updated: `::selection` color to `#ffffff`\n- Updated: dist from CSS source using PostCSS, cssnext, and cssnano\n- Updated: Documentation\n\n### 2.1.1 (October 5, 2015)\n\n- Updated: bower.json\n\n### 2.1.1 (October 5, 2015)\n\n- Added: CSS version\n- Updated: Use percentage `font-size` on `:root`\n- Updated: Documentation\n- Removed: `background-color` inheritance\n\n### 2.0.0 (September 3, 2015)\n\n- Added: Visually hidden element style `[hidden][aria-hidden=\"false\"]`\n- Added: Currently updating element style `[aria-busy=\"true\"]`\n- Added: Trigger element style `[aria-controls]`\n- Added: Color style for `html`\n- Added: CHANGELOG.md\n- Removed: Standards-breaking visually hidden style `[hidden~=\"screen\"]`\n- Removed: Standards-breaking IE-proprietary style `[unselectable=\"on\"]`\n- Removed: Prefix-less properties and the use of Autoprefixer\n- Updated: Form styling\n- Updated: Support for the latest **Chrome**, **Edge**, **Firefox**,\n           and **Safari**\n- Updated: Licensing reference in package.json\n- Updated: Development dependencies\n- Updated: README.md and code documentation\n\n### 1.2.0 (June 16, 2015)\n\n- Added: Control over options via Sass variables\n- Added: Overflow normalization on :root\n- Added: `font-style` inheritance\n- Updated: Support for the latest **Firefox**\n- Removed: Redundant inheritance in ::before and ::after\n- Removed: redundant cursor inheritance in anchor and form controls\n\n### 1.1.0 (March 20, 2015)\n\n- Added: Form support\n- Updated: Normalization\n- Updated: Border assignment\n\n### 1.0.0 (11 6, 2012)\n\n- Updated: Moved from normalize.css to sanitize.css\n\n> Normalize.css had and still has opinionated, developer-centric styles. For\nexample, `sub` and `sup` elements are styled to not impact the line height of\ntext, and `table`, `th`, and `td` omit all spacing. As Nicolas pushed\nNormalize.css into maturity, future preferences like these no longer had a\nplace in the project. Almost a year later, Sanitize was officially branded.\nWhere Normalize.css conservatively follows user agent consensus and results\nin more pre-styled elements, Sanitize.css liberally follows developer\nconsensus and results in more unstyled elements.\n\n### 0.0.0 (4 21, 2011)\n\n- Added: Normalize.css\n"

In return, we will\nreciprocate that respect in addressing your issues, patches, and features.\n\n## Using the issue tracker\n\nThe issue tracker is the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bug-reports),\n[feature requests](#feature-requests) and [pull\nrequests](#pull-requests), but please respect the following restrictions:\n\n* Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests.\n* Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and\n  respect the opinions of others.\n\n## Bug reports\n\nA bug is a _demonstrable problem_ caused by the code in this repository.\n\n1. **Use the GitHub issue search** to see if the issue has\n   [already been reported].\n\n2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** by trying to reproduce it using the\n   latest `master` branch in the repository.\n\n3. **Isolate the problem** to create a [live example] of a [reduced test case].\n\nA good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more\ninformation. Please be as detailed as possible in your report. What is your\nenvironment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS\nexperience the problem? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these\ndetails will help people to fix any potential bugs.\n\nExample:\n\n> Short and descriptive example bug report title\n>\n> A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If\n> suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.\n>\n> 1. This is the first step\n> 2. This is the second step\n> 3. Further steps, etc.\n>\n> `<url>` - a link to the reduced test case\n>\n> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being\n> reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as\n> causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their\n> merits).\n\n## Feature requests\n\nFeature requests are welcome. Take a moment to find out whether your idea fits\nwith the scope and aims of the project. It's up to *you* to make a strong case\nto convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please\nprovide as much detail and context as possible.\n\n## Pull requests\n\nGood pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastic\nhelp. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated\ncommits.\n\n**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant work, otherwise you\nrisk spending a lot of time working on something that the project's developers\nmight not want to merge into the project.\n\nPlease adhere to the coding conventions used throughout a project (whitespace,\naccurate comments, etc.) and any other requirements (such as test coverage).\n\nFollow this process if you'd like your work considered for inclusion in the\nproject:\n\n1. To begin: [fork this project], clone your fork, and add our upstream.\n   ```bash\n   # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory\n   git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USER/sanitize.css.git\n\n   # Navigate to the newly cloned directory\n   cd sanitize.css\n\n   # Assign the original repo to a remote called \"upstream\"\n   git remote add upstream git@github.com:csstools/sanitize.css.git\n\n   # Install the tools necessary for testing\n   npm install\n   ```\n\n2. Create a branch for your feature or fix:\n   ```bash\n   # Move into a new branch for your feature\n   git checkout -b feature/thing\n   ```\n   ```bash\n   # Move into a new branch for your fix\n   git checkout -b fix/something\n   ```\n\n3. If your code follows our practices, then push your feature branch:\n   ```bash\n   # Test current code\n   npm test\n   ```\n   ```bash\n   # Push the branch for your new feature\n   git push origin feature/thing\n   ```\n   ```bash\n   # Or, push the branch for your update\n   git push origin update/something\n   ```\n\n   Be sure to add a test to the `test.html` file if appropriate, and test\n   your change in all supported browsers.\n\n\nNow [open a pull request] with a clear title and description. Remember,\nby submitting a patch, you agree to allow the project owner to license your\nwork under the same license as that used by the project.\n\n### CSS Conventions\n\nKeep the CSS file as readable as possible by following these guidelines:\n\n- Comments are short and to the point.\n- Comments without a number reference the entire rule.\n- Comments describe the selector when the selector does not make the\n  normalization obvious.\n- Comments begin with “Correct the...” when they deal with less obvious side\n  effects.\n- Rules are sorted by section, cascade, specificity, and then alphabetic order.\n- Selectors are sorted by low-to-high specificity and then alphabetic order.\n- `in browser` applies to all versions.\n- `in browser v+` applies to all versions after and including the version.\n- `in browser v-` applies to all versions up to and including the version.\n- `in browser v-v` applies to all versions including and between the versions.\n\n## Maintainers\n\nIf you have commit access, please follow this process for merging patches and\ncutting new releases.\n\n### Accepting patches\n\n1. Check that a patch is within the scope and philosophy of the project.\n2. Check that a patch has any necessary tests and a proper, descriptive commit\n   message.\n3. Test the patch locally.\n4. Use GitHub’s merge button with caution or apply the patch locally, squashing\n   any commits.\n\n### Releasing a new version\n\n1. Include all new functional changes in CHANGELOG.md.\n2. Create an annotated tag for the version: `git tag -m \"0.0.0\" 0.0.0`.\n3. Push the changes and tags to GitHub: `git push --tags origin master`\n4. Update the `gh-pages` branch,\n   1. Copy the latest sanitize.css and test.html from the master branch into\n      the root directory, the `latest` directory, and a new directory named\n      after the new version: `0.0.0`.\n   2. Update the sanitize.css version and supported browsers in `index.html`.\n\n### Semver strategy\n\n[Semver](http://semver.org/) is a widely accepted method for deciding how\nversion numbers are incremented in a project. Versions are written as\nMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.\n\nAny change to CSS rules whatsoever is considered backwards-breaking and will\nresult in a new **major** release. Others changes with no impact on rendering\nare considered backwards-compatible and will result in a new **patch** release.\n\nNo changes to CSS rules can add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner,\ntherefore no changes are considered **minor**. For instance, a normalization on\nan element selector may override a user style on a universal selector, or a\nchange to `opacity` might cause [inputs to disappear](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/3901363/),\nor a change to `background-color` might cause [backgrounds to shrink](https://github.com/csstools/sanitize.css/issues/42).\n\n[already been reported]: https://github.com/csstools/sanitize.css/issues\n[fork this project]:     https://github.com/csstools/sanitize.css/fork\n[live example]:          https://codepen.io/pen\n[open a pull request]:   https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/\n[reduced test case]:     https://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/\n"

Both sanitize.css and normalize.css are\nmaintained in sync.\n\n## Features\n\n##### Box sizing defaults to border-box\n\n```css\n*, ::before, ::after {\n  box-sizing: border-box;\n}\n```\n\n##### Backgrounds do not repeat by default\n\n```css\n*, ::before, ::after {\n  background-repeat: no-repeat;\n}\n```\n\n##### Pseudo-elements inherit text decoration and vertical alignment\n\n```css\n::before,\n::after {\n  text-decoration: inherit;\n  vertical-align: inherit;\n}\n```\n\n##### Cursors only change to hint non-obvious interfaces\n\n```css\nhtml {\n  cursor: default;\n}\n```\n\n##### Text has a comfortable line height in all browsers\n\n```css\nhtml {\n  line-height: 1.5;\n}\n```\n\n##### Tabs appear the same on the web as in a typical editor\n\n```css\nhtml {\n  tab-size: 4;\n}\n```\n\n##### Words break to prevent overflow\n\n```css\nhtml {\n  word-break: break-all;\n}\n```\n\n##### Documents do not use a margin for outer padding\n\n```css\nbody {\n  margin: 0;\n}\n```\n\n##### Navigation lists do not include a marker style\n\n```css\nnav ol, nav ul {\n  list-style: none;\n  padding: 0;\n}\n```\n\n##### Media elements align to the text center of other content\n\n```css\naudio, canvas, iframe, img, svg, video {\n  vertical-align: middle;\n}\n```\n\n##### SVGs fallback to the current text color\n\n```css\nsvg:not([fill]) {\n  fill: currentColor;\n}\n```\n\n##### Tables do not include additional border spacing\n\n```css\ntable {\n  border-collapse: collapse;\n}\n```\n\n##### Textareas only resize vertically by default\n\n```css\ntextarea {\n  resize: vertical;\n}\n```\n\n##### Single taps are dispatched immediately on clickable elements\n\n```css\na, area, button, input, label, select, summary, textarea, [tabindex] {\n  -ms-touch-action: manipulation;\n  touch-action: manipulation;\n}\n```\n\n##### ARIA roles include visual cursor hints\n\n```css\n[aria-busy=\"true\"] {\n  cursor: progress;\n}\n\n[aria-controls] {\n  cursor: pointer;\n}\n\n[aria-disabled=\"true\"], [disabled] {\n  cursor: default;\n}\n```\n\n##### Visually hidden content remains
