They are the result of many \nperson-years of discussion and design across a number of organizations. Their design encourages general applicability and broad adoption but \nthey can be freely copied and modified to meet your organization's needs. \n\nWe encourage contributions to the C++ Core Guidelines in a number of ways:\n- **Individual feedback** Are you a developer who is passionate about your code? Join the discussion in \n[Issues](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/issues). We want to know which rules resonate with you and which don't. Were any rules\ninordinately difficult to apply? Does your compiler vendor's Guidelines Support Library (e.g., \n[Microsoft's implementation of the GSL](https://github.com/microsoft/gsl)) suit your needs in adopting these guidelines?\n- **Organizational adoption** While the guidelines are designed to be broadly adoptable they are also intended to be modified to fit your\norganization's particular needs. We encourage your organization to fork this repo and create your own copy of these guidelines with changes \nthat reflect your needs. We suggest that you make it clear in the title of your guidelines that these are your organization's fork of the\nguidelines and that you provide a link back to the original set of [guidelines](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines). And if any of\nyour local changes are appropriate to pull back into the original guidelines, please open an \n[Issue](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/issues) which can lead to a pull request.\n- **Maintain the Guidelines** The C++ Core Guidelines were created from a wealth of knowledge spread across a number of organizations\nworldwide. If you or your organization is passionate about helping to create the guidelines, consider becoming an editor or maintainer. If\nyou're a C++ expert who is serious about participating, please \n[email coreguidelines@isocpp.org](mailto:coreguidelines@isocpp.org?subject=Maintain%20the%20C++%20Code%20Guidelines).\n \n## Contributor License Agreement\nBy contributing content to the C++ Core Guidelines (i.e., submitting a pull request for inclusion in this repository) you agree with the \n[Standard C++ Foundation](https://isocpp.org/about) [Terms of Use](https://isocpp.org/home/terms-of-use), especially all of the terms specified\nregarding Copyright and Patents.   \n- You warrant that your material is original, or you have the right to contribute it.\n- With respect to the material that you own, you grant a worldwide, non-exclusive, irrevocable, transferable, and royalty-free license to your contributed \nmaterial to Standard C++ Foundation to display, reproduce, perform, distribute, and create derivative works of that material for commercial or \nnon-commercial use. With respect to any other material you contribute, such material must be under a license sufficient to allow Standard C++ Foundation\nto display, reproduce, perform, distribute, and create derivative works of that material for commercial or non-commercial use.\n- You agree that, if your contributed material is subsequently reflected in the ISO/IEC C++ standard in any form, it will be subject to all ISO/IEC JTC \n1 policies including [copyrights](http://www.iso.org/iso/home/policies.htm), \n[patents](http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards_development/governance_of_technical_work/patents.htm), and \n[procedures](http://www.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/sc29/29w7proc.htm); please direct any questions about these policies to the \n[ISO Central Secretariat](http://www.iso.org/iso/home/about.htm).\n\n\n## Pull requests\n\nWe welcome pull requests for scoped changes to the guidelines--bug fixes in\nexamples, clarifying ambiguous text, etc.  Significant changes should first be\ndiscussed in the [Issues](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/issues)\nand the Issue number must be included in the pull request.  For\nguideline-related changes, please specify the rule number in your Issue and/or\nPull Request.\n\nChanges should be made in a child commit of a recent commit in the master\nbranch.  If you are making many small changes, please create separate PRs to\nminimize merge issues.\n\n### Document Style Guidelines\n\nDocuments in this repository are written in an unspecific flavor of Markdown,\nwhich leaves some ambiguity for formatting text.  We ask that pull requests\nmaintain the following style guidelines, though we are aware that the document\nmay not already be consistent.\n\n#### Indentation\n\nCode and nested text should use multiples of 4 spaces of indentation, and no\ntab characters, like so:\n\n    void func(const int x)\n    {\n        std::cout << x << '\\n';\n    }\n\n#### Code Blocks\n\nPlease use 4-space indentation to trigger code parsing, rather than [fenced code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/#fenced-code-blocks) or any other style, like so:\n\n    This is some document text, with an example below:\n\n        void func()\n        {\n            std::cout << \"This is code.\\n\";\n        }\n\n#### Document style decisions\n\nWe've discussed and made decisions on a number of document style. Please do not open PRs that revisit these stylistic points:\n\n- The CppCoreGuidelines.md file is a single GH-flavored Markdown file. It is not split into separate chapters.\n- We do not use syntax highlighting in the Core Guidelines. See PRs #33, #96, #328, and #779. If you want syntax highlighting you\ncan either view the \"pretty\" version at http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines or do your own post-processing.\n- We're sticking with the ASCII character set. We do not use Unicode em-dashes, Unicode spaces, or pretty quotes. Lots of people edit this file with their various text editors. ASCII is simple and universally understood. \n\n### Update dictionary\n\nCode samples in the guidelines are run through a spelling checker.  Be sure to add new class and variable names to [scripts/hunspell/isocpp.dic](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/scripts/hunspell/isocpp.dic).\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\nTo avoid line-ending issues, please set `autocrlf = input` and `whitespace = cr-at-eol` in your git configuration.\n"

we mean effective use of the ISO C++ standard (currently C++20, but almost all of our recommendations also apply to C++17, C++14 and C++11).\nIn other words, what would you like your code to look like in 5 years' time, given that you can start now? In 10 years' time?\n\nThe guidelines are focused on relatively high-level issues, such as interfaces, resource management, memory management, and concurrency.\nSuch rules affect application architecture and library design.\nFollowing the rules will lead to code that is statically type safe, has no resource leaks, and catches many more programming logic errors than is common in code today.\nAnd it will run fast -- you can afford to do things right.\n\nWe are less concerned with low-level issues, such as naming conventions and indentation style.\nHowever, no topic that can help a programmer is out of bounds.\n\nOur initial set of rules emphasizes safety (of various forms) and simplicity.\nThey might very well be too strict.\nWe expect to have to introduce more exceptions to better accommodate real-world needs.\nWe also need more rules.\n\nYou will find some of the rules contrary to your expectations or even contrary to your experience.\nIf we haven't suggested you change your coding style in any way, we have failed!\nPlease try to verify or disprove rules!\nIn particular, we'd really like to have some of our rules backed up with measurements or better examples.\n\nYou will find some of the rules obvious or even trivial.\nPlease remember that one purpose of a guideline is to help someone who is less experienced or coming from a different background or language to get up to speed.\n\nMany of the rules are designed to be supported by an analysis tool.\nViolations of rules will be flagged with references (or links) to the relevant rule.\nWe do not expect you to memorize all the rules before trying to write code.\nOne way of thinking about these guidelines is as a specification for tools that happens to be readable by humans.\n\nThe rules are meant for gradual introduction into a code base.\nWe plan to build tools for that and hope others will too.\n\nComments and suggestions for improvements are most welcome.\nWe plan to modify and extend this document as our understanding improves and the language and the set of available libraries improve.\n\n# <a name=\"S-introduction\"></a>In: Introduction\n\nThis is a set of core guidelines for modern C++ (currently C++20 and C++17) taking likely future enhancements and ISO Technical Specifications (TSs) into account.\nThe aim is to help C++ programmers to write simpler, more efficient, more maintainable code.\n\nIntroduction summary:\n\n* [In.target: Target readership](#SS-readers)\n* [In.aims: Aims](#SS-aims)\n* [In.not: Non-aims](#SS-non)\n* [In.force: Enforcement](#SS-force)\n* [In.struct: The structure of this document](#SS-struct)\n* [In.sec: Major sections](#SS-sec)\n\n## <a name=\"SS-readers\"></a>In.target: Target readership\n\nAll C++ programmers. This includes [programmers who might consider C](#S-cpl).\n\n## <a name=\"SS-aims\"></a>In.aims: Aims\n\nThe purpose of this document is to help developers to adopt modern C++ (currently C++20 and C++17) and to achieve a more uniform style across code bases.\n\nWe do not suffer the delusion that every one of these rules can be effectively applied to every code base. Upgrading old systems is hard. However, we do believe that a program that uses a rule is less error-prone and more maintainable than one that does not. Often, rules also lead to faster/easier initial development.\nAs far as we can tell, these rules lead to code that performs as well or better than older, more conventional techniques; they are meant to follow the zero-overhead principle (\"what you don't use, you don't pay for\" or \"when you use an abstraction mechanism appropriately, you get at least as good performance as if you had handcoded using lower-level language constructs\").\nConsider these rules ideals for new code, opportunities to exploit when working on older code, and try to approximate these ideals as closely as feasible.\nRemember:\n\n### <a name=\"R0\"></a>In.0: Don't panic!\n\nTake the time to understand the implications of a guideline rule on your program.\n\nThese guidelines are designed according to the \"subset of superset\" principle ([Stroustrup05](#Stroustrup05)).\nThey do not simply define a subset of C++ to be used (for reliability, safety, performance, or whatever).\nInstead, they strongly recommend the use of a few simple \"extensions\" ([library components](#gsl-guidelines-support-library))\nthat make the use of the most error-prone features of C++ redundant, so that they can be banned (in our set of rules).\n\nThe rules emphasize static type safety and resource safety.\nFor that reason, they emphasize possibilities for range checking, for avoiding dereferencing `nullptr`, for avoiding dangling pointers, and the systematic use of exceptions (via RAII).\nPartly to achieve that and partly to minimize obscure code as a source of errors, the rules also emphasize simplicity and the hiding of necessary complexity behind well-specified interfaces.\n\nMany of the rules are prescriptive.\nWe are uncomfortable with rules that simply state \"don't do that!\" without offering an alternative.\nOne consequence of that is that some rules can be supported only by heuristics, rather than precise and mechanically verifiable checks.\nOther rules articulate general principles. For these more general rules, more detailed and specific rules provide partial checking.\n\nThese guidelines address the core of C++ and its use.\nWe expect that most large organizations, specific application areas, and even large projects will need further rules, possibly further restrictions, and further library support.\nFor example, hard-real-time programmers typically can't use free store (dynamic memory) freely and will be restricted in their choice of libraries.\nWe encourage the development of such more specific rules as addenda to these core guidelines.\nBuild your ideal small foundation library and use that, rather than lowering your level of programming to glorified assembly code.\n\nThe rules are designed to allow [gradual adoption](#S-modernizing).\n\nSome rules aim to increase various forms of safety while others aim to reduce the likelihood of accidents, many do both.\nThe guidelines aimed at preventing accidents often ban perfectly legal C++.\nHowever, when there are two ways of expressing an idea and one has shown itself a common source of errors and the other has not, we try to guide programmers towards the latter.\n\n## <a name=\"SS-non\"></a>In.not: Non-aims\n\nThe rules are not intended to be minimal or orthogonal.\nIn particular, general rules can be simple, but unenforceable.\nAlso, it is often hard to understand the implications of a general rule.\nMore specialized rules are often easier to understand and to enforce, but without general rules, they would just be a long list of special cases.\nWe provide rules aimed at helping novices as well as rules supporting expert use.\nSome rules can be completely enforced, but others are based on heuristics.\n\nThese rules are not meant to be read serially, like a book.\nYou can browse through them using the links.\nHowever, their main intended use is to be targets for tools.\nThat is, a tool looks for violations and the tool returns links to violated rules.\nThe rules then provide reasons, examples of potential consequences of the violation, and suggested remedies.\n\nThese guidelines are not intended to be a substitute for a tutorial treatment of C++.\nIf you need a tutorial for some given level of experience, see [the references](#S-references).\n\nThis is not a guide on how to convert old C++ code to more modern code.\nIt is meant to articulate ideas for new code in a concrete fashion.\nHowever, see [the modernization section](#S-modernizing) for some possible approaches to modernizing/rejuvenating/upgrading.\nImportantly, the rules support gradual adoption: It is typically infeasible to completely convert a large code base all at once.\n\nThese guidelines are not meant to be complete or exact in every language-technical detail.\nFor the final word on language definition issues, including every exception to general rules and every feature, see the ISO C++ standard.\n\nThe rules are not intended to force you to write in an impoverished subset of C++.\nThey are *emphatically* not meant to define a, say, Java-like subset of C++.\nThey are not meant to define a single \"one true C++\" language.\nWe value expressiveness and uncompromised performance.\n\nThe rules are not value-neutral.\nThey are meant to make code simpler and more correct/safer than most existing C++ code, without loss of performance.\nThey are meant to inhibit perfectly valid C++ code that correlates with errors, spurious complexity, and poor performance.\n\nThe rules are not precise to the point where a person (or machine) can follow them without thinking.\nThe enforcement parts try to be that, but we would rather leave a rule or a definition a bit vague\nand open to interpretation than specify something precisely and wrong.\nSometimes, precision comes only with time and experience.\nDesign is not (yet) a form of Math.\n\nThe rules are not perfect.\nA rule can do harm by prohibiting something that is useful in a given situation.\nA rule can do harm by failing to prohibit something that enables a serious error in a given situation.\nA rule can do a lot of harm by being vague, ambiguous, unenforceable, or by enabling every solution to a problem.\nIt is impossible to completely meet the \"do no harm\" criteria.\nInstead, our aim is the less ambitious: \"Do the most good for most programmers\";\nif you cannot live with a rule, object to it, ignore it, but don't water it down until it becomes meaningless.\nAlso, suggest an improvement.\n\n## <a name=\"SS-force\"></a>In.force: Enforcement\n\nRules with no enforcement are unmanageable for large code bases.\nEnforcement of all rules is possible only for a small weak set of rules or for a specific user community.\n\n* But we want lots of rules, and we want rules that everybody can use.\n* But different people have different needs.\n* But people don't like to read lots of rules.\n* But people can't remember many rules.\n\nSo, we need subsetting to meet a variety of needs.\n\n* But arbitrary subsetting leads to chaos.\n\nWe want guidelines that help a lot of people, make code more uniform, and strongly encourage people to modernize their code.\nWe want to encourage best practices, rather than leave all to individual choices and management pressures.\nThe ideal is to use all rules; that gives the greatest benefits.\n\nThis adds up to quite a few dilemmas.\nWe try to resolve those using tools.\nEach rule has an **Enforcement** section listing ideas for enforcement.\nEnforcement might be done by code review, by static analysis, by compiler, or by run-time checks.\nWherever possible, we prefer \"mechanical\" checking (humans are slow, inaccurate, and bore easily) and static checking.\nRun-time checks are suggested only rarely where no alternative exists; we do not want to introduce \"distributed bloat\".\nWhere appropriate, we label a rule (in the **Enforcement** sections) with the name of groups of related rules (called \"profiles\").\nA rule can be part of several profiles, or none.\nFor a start, we have a few profiles corresponding to common needs (desires, ideals):\n\n* **type**: No type violations (reinterpreting a `T` as a `U` through casts, unions, or varargs)\n* **bounds**: No bounds violations (accessing beyond the range of an array)\n* **lifetime**: No leaks (failing to `delete` or multiple `delete`) and no access to invalid objects (dereferencing `nullptr`, using a dangling reference).\n\nThe profiles are intended to be used by tools, but also serve as an aid to the human reader.\nWe do not limit our comment in the **Enforcement** sections to things we know how to enforce; some comments are mere wishes that might inspire some tool builder.\n\nTools that implement these rules shall respect the following syntax to explicitly suppress a rule:\n\n    [[gsl::suppress(\"tag\")]]\n\nand optionally with a message (following usual C++11 standard attribute syntax):\n\n    [[gsl::suppress(\"tag\", justification: \"message\")]]\n\nwhere\n\n* `\"tag\"` is a string literal with the anchor name of the item where the Enforcement rule appears (e.g., for [C.134](#Rh-public) it is \"Rh-public\"), the\nname of a

However, many rules apply widely, but not universally, so exceptions must be listed\n* **Enforcement** -- ideas about how the rule might be checked \"mechanically\"\n* **See also**s -- references to related rules and/or further discussion (in this document or elsewhere)\n* **Note**s (comments) -- something that needs saying that doesn't fit the other classifications\n* **Discussion** -- references to more extensive rationale and/or examples placed outside the main lists of rules\n\nSome rules are hard to check mechanically, but they all meet the minimal criteria that an expert programmer can spot many violations without too much trouble.\nWe hope that \"mechanical\" tools will improve with time to approximate what such an expert programmer notices.\nAlso, we assume that the rules will be refined over time to make them more precise and checkable.\n\nA rule is aimed at being simple, rather than carefully phrased to mention every alternative and special case.\nSuch information is found in the **Alternative** paragraphs and the [Discussion](#S-discussion) sections.\nIf you don't understand a rule or disagree with it, please visit its **Discussion**.\nIf you feel that a discussion is missing or incomplete, enter an [Issue](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/issues)\nexplaining your concerns and possibly a corresponding PR.\n\nExamples are written to illustrate rules.\n\n* Examples are not intended to be production quality or to cover all tutorial dimensions.\nFor example, many examples are language-technical and use names like `f`, `base`, and `x`.\n* We try to ensure that \"good\" examples follow the Core Guidelines.\n* Comments are often illustrating rules where they would be unnecessary and/or distracting in \"real code.\"\n* We assume knowledge of the standard library.

 // do\n        int month();          // don't\n        // ...\n    };\n\nThe first declaration of `month` is explicit about returning a `Month` and about not modifying the state of the `Date` object.\nThe second version leaves the reader guessing and opens more possibilities for uncaught bugs.\n\n##### Example, bad\n\nThis loop is a restricted form of `std::find`:\n\n    void f(vector<string>& v)\n    {\n        string val;\n        cin >> val;\n        // ...\n        int index = -1;                    // bad, plus should use gsl::index\n        for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); ++i) {\n            if (v[i] == val) {\n                index = i;\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        // ...\n    }\n\n##### Example, good\n\nA much clearer expression of intent would be:\n\n    void f(vector<string>& v)\n    {\n        string val;\n        cin >> val;\n        // ...\n        auto p = find(begin(v), end(v), val);  // better\n        // ...\n    }\n\nA well-designed library expresses intent (what is to be done, rather than just how something is being done) far better than direct use of language features.\n\nA C++ programmer should know the basics of the standard library, and use it where appropriate.\nAny programmer should know the basics of the foundation libraries of the project being worked on, and use them appropriately.\nAny programmer using these guidelines should know the [guidelines support library](#gsl-guidelines-support-library), and use it appropriately.\n\n##### Example\n\n    change_speed(double s);   // bad: what does s signify?\n    // ...\n    change_speed(2.3);\n\nA better approach is to be explicit about the meaning of the double (new speed or delta on old speed?) and the unit used:\n\n    change_speed(Speed s);    // better: the meaning of s is specified\n    // ...\n    change_speed(2.3);        // error: no unit\n    change_speed(23_m / 10s);  // meters per second\n\nWe could have accepted a plain (unit-less) `double` as a delta, but that would have been error-prone.\nIf we wanted both absolute speed and deltas, we would have defined a `Delta` type.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nVery hard in general.\n\n* use `const` consistently (check if member functions modify their object; check if functions modify arguments passed by pointer or reference)\n* flag uses of casts (casts neuter the type system)\n* detect code that mimics the standard library (hard)\n\n### <a name=\"Rp-Cplusplus\"></a>P.2: Write in ISO Standard C++\n\n##### Reason\n\nThis is a set of guidelines for writing ISO Standard C++.\n\n##### Note\n\nThere are environments where extensions are necessary, e.g., to access system resources.\nIn such cases, localize the use of necessary extensions and control their use with non-core Coding Guidelines.  If possible, build interfaces that encapsulate the extensions so they can be turned off or compiled away on systems that do not support those extensions.\n\nExtensions often do not have rigorously defined semantics.  Even extensions that\nare common and implemented by multiple compilers might have slightly different\nbehaviors and edge case behavior as a direct result of *not* having a rigorous\nstandard definition.  With sufficient use of any such extension, expected\nportability will be impacted.\n\n##### Note\n\nUsing valid ISO C++ does not guarantee portability (let alone correctness).\nAvoid dependence on undefined behavior (e.g., [undefined order of evaluation](#Res-order))\nand be aware of constructs with implementation defined meaning (e.g., `sizeof(int)`).\n\n##### Note\n\nThere are environments where restrictions on use of standard C++ language or library features are necessary, e.g., to avoid dynamic memory allocation as required by aircraft control software standards.\nIn such cases, control their (dis)use with an extension of these Coding Guidelines customized to the specific environment.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nUse an up-to-date C++ compiler (currently C++20 or C++17) with a set of options that do not accept extensions.\n\n### <a name=\"Rp-what\"></a>P.3: Express intent\n\n##### Reason\n\nUnless the intent of some code is stated (e.g., in names or comments), it is impossible to tell whether the code does what it is supposed to do.\n\n##### Example\n\n    gsl::index i = 0;\n    while (i < v.size()) {\n        // ... do something with v[i] ...\n    }\n\nThe intent of \"just\" looping over the elements of `v` is not expressed here. The implementation detail of an index is exposed (so that it might be misused), and `i` outlives the scope of the loop, which might or might not be intended. The reader cannot know from just this section of code.\n\nBetter:\n\n    for (const auto& x : v) { /* do something with the value of x */ }\n\nNow, there is no explicit mention of the iteration mechanism, and the loop operates on a reference to `const` elements so that accidental modification cannot happen. If modification is desired, say so:\n\n    for (auto& x : v) { /* modify x */ }\n\nFor more details about for-statements, see [ES.71](#Res-for-range).\nSometimes better still, use a named algorithm. This example uses the `for_each` from the Ranges TS because it directly expresses the intent:\n\n    for_each(v, [](int x) { /* do something with the value of x */ });\n    for_each(par, v, [](int x) { /* do something with the value of x */ });\n\nThe last variant makes it clear that we are not interested in the order in which the elements of `v` are handled.\n\nA programmer should be familiar with\n\n* [The guidelines support library](#gsl-guidelines-support-library)\n* [The ISO C++ Standard Library](#sl-the-standard-library)\n* Whatever foundation libraries are used for the current project(s)\n\n##### Note\n\nAlternative formulation: Say what should be done, rather than just how it should be done.\n\n##### Note\n\nSome language constructs express intent better than others.\n\n##### Example\n\nIf two `int`s are meant to be the coordinates of a 2D point, say so:\n\n    draw_line(int, int, int, int);  // obscure: (x1,y1,x2,y2)? (x,y,h,w)? ...?\n                                    // need to look up documentation to know\n\n    draw_line(Point, Point);        // clearer\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nLook for common patterns for which there are better alternatives\n\n* simple `for` loops vs. range-`for` loops\n* `f(T*, int)` interfaces vs. `f(span<T>)` interfaces\n* loop variables in too large a scope\n* naked `new` and `delete`\n* functions with many parameters of built-in types\n\nThere is a huge scope for cleverness and semi-automated program transformation.\n\n### <a name=\"Rp-typesafe\"></a>P.4: Ideally, a program should be statically type safe\n\n##### Reason\n\nIdeally, a program would be completely statically (compile-time) type safe.\nUnfortunately, that is not possible. Problem areas:\n\n* unions\n* casts\n* array decay\n* range errors\n* narrowing conversions\n\n##### Note\n\nThese areas are sources of serious problems (e.g., crashes and security violations).\nWe try to provide alternative techniques.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nWe can ban, restrain, or detect the individual problem categories separately, as required and feasible for individual programs.\nAlways suggest an alternative.\nFor example:\n\n* unions -- use `variant` (in C++17)\n* casts -- minimize their use; templates can help\n* array decay -- use `span` (from the GSL)\n* range errors -- use `span`\n* narrowing conversions -- minimize their use and use `narrow` or `narrow_cast` (from the GSL) where they are necessary\n\n### <a name=\"Rp-compile-time\"></a>P.5: Prefer compile-time checking to run-time checking\n\n##### Reason\n\nCode clarity and performance.\nYou don't need to write error handlers for errors caught at compile time.\n\n##### Example\n\n    // Int is an alias used for integers\n    int bits = 0;         // don't: avoidable code\n    for (Int i = 1; i; i <<= 1)\n        ++bits;\n    if (bits < 32)\n        cerr << \"Int too small\\n\";\n\nThis example fails to achieve what it is trying to achieve (because overflow is undefined) and should be replaced with a simple `static_assert`:\n\n    // Int is an alias used for integers\n    static_assert(sizeof(Int) >= 4);    // do: compile-time check\n\nOr better still just use the type system and replace `Int` with `int32_t`.\n\n##### Example\n\n    void read(int* p, int n);   // read max n integers into *p\n\n    int a[100];\n    read(a, 1000);    // bad, off the end\n\nbetter\n\n    void read(span<int> r); // read into the range of integers r\n\n    int a[100];\n    read(a);        // better: let the compiler figure out the number of elements\n\n**Alternative formulation**: Don't postpone to run time what can be done well at compile time.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* Look for pointer arguments.\n* Look for run-time checks for range violations.\n\n### <a name=\"Rp-run-time\"></a>P.6: What cannot be checked at compile time should be checkable at run time\n\n##### Reason\n\nLeaving hard-to-detect errors in a program is asking for crashes and bad results.\n\n##### Note\n\nIdeally, we catch all errors (that are not errors in the programmer's logic) at either compile time or run time. It is impossible to catch all errors at compile time and often not affordable to catch all remaining errors at run time. However, we should endeavor to write programs that in principle can be checked, given sufficient resources (analysis programs, run-time checks, machine resources, time).\n\n##### Example, bad\n\n    // separately compiled, possibly dynamically loaded\n    extern void f(int* p);\n\n    void g(int n)\n    {\n        // bad: the number of elements is not passed to f()\n        f(new int[n]);\n    }\n\nHere, a crucial bit of information (the number of elements) has been so thoroughly \"obscured\" that static analysis is probably rendered infeasible and dynamic checking can be very difficult when `f()` is part of an ABI so that we cannot \"instrument\" that pointer. We could embed helpful information into the free store, but that requires global changes to a system and maybe to the compiler. What we have here is a design that makes error detection very hard.\n\n##### Example, bad\n\nWe can of course pass the number of elements along with the pointer:\n\n    // separately compiled, possibly dynamically loaded\n    extern void f2(int* p, int n);\n\n    void g2(int n)\n    {\n        f2(new int[n], m);  // bad: a wrong number of elements can be passed to f()\n    }\n\nPassing the number of elements as an argument is better (and far more common) than just passing the pointer and relying on some (unstated) convention for knowing or discovering the number of elements. However (as shown), a simple typo can introduce a serious error. The connection between the two arguments of `f2()` is conventional, rather than explicit.\n\nAlso, it is implicit that `f2()` is supposed to `delete` its argument (or did the caller make a second mistake?).\n\n##### Example, bad\n\nThe standard library resource management pointers fail to pass the size when they point to an object:\n\n    // separately compiled, possibly dynamically loaded\n    // NB: this assumes the calling code is ABI-compatible, using a\n    // compatible C++ compiler and the same stdlib implementation\n    extern void f3(unique_ptr<int[]>, int n);\n\n    void g3(int n)\n    {\n        f3(make_unique<int[]>(n), m);    // bad: pass ownership and size separately\n    }\n\n##### Example\n\nWe need to pass the pointer and the number of elements as an integral object:\n\n    extern void f4(vector<int>&);   // separately compiled, possibly dynamically loaded\n    extern void f4(span<int>);      // separately compiled, possibly dynamically loaded\n                                    // NB: this assumes the calling code is ABI-compatible, using a\n                                    // compatible C++ compiler and the same stdlib implementation\n\n    void g3(int n)\n    {\n        vector<int> v(n);\n        f4(v);                     // pass a reference, retain ownership\n        f4(span<int>{v});          // pass a view, retain ownership\n    }\n\nThis design carries the number of elements along as an integral part of an object, so that errors are unlikely and dynamic (run-time) checking is always feasible, if not always affordable.\n\n##### Example\n\nHow do we transfer both ownership and all information needed for validating use?\n\n    vector<int> f5(int n)    // OK: move\n    {\n        vector<int> v(n);\n        // ... initialize v ...\n        return v;\n    }\n\n    unique_ptr<int[]> f6(int n)    // bad: loses n\n    {\n        auto p = make_unique<int[]>(n);\n        // ... initialize *p ...\n        return p;\n    }\n\n    owner<int*> f7(int n)    // bad: loses n and we might forget to delete\n    {\n        owner<int*> p = new int[n];\n        // ... initialize *p ...\n        return p;\n    }\n\n##### Example\n\n* ???\n* show how possible checks are avoided by interfaces that pass polymorphic base classes around, when they actually know what they need?\n  Or strings as \"free-style\" options\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* Flag (pointer, count)-style interfaces (this will flag a lot of examples that can't be fixed for compatibility reasons)\n* ???\n\n### <a name=\"Rp-early\"></a>P.7: Catch run-time errors early\n\n##### Reason\n\nAvoid \"mysterious\" crashes.\nAvoid errors leading to (possibly unrecognized) wrong results.\n\n##### Example\n\n    void increment1(int* p, int n)    // bad: error-prone\n    {\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) ++p[i];\n    }\n\n    void use1(int m)\n    {\n        const int n = 10;\n        int a[n] = {};\n        // ...\n        increment1(a, m);   // maybe typo, maybe m <= n is supposed\n                            // but assume that m == 20\n        // ...\n    }\n\nHere we made a small error in `use1` that will lead to corrupted data or a crash.\nThe (pointer, count)-style interface leaves `increment1()` with no realistic way of defending itself against out-of-range errors.\nIf we could check subscripts for out of range access, then the error would not be discovered until `p[10]` was accessed.\nWe could check earlier and improve the code:\n\n    void increment2(span<int> p)\n    {\n        for (int& x : p) ++x;\n    }\n\n    void use2(int m)\n    {\n        const int n = 10;\n        int a[n] = {};\n        // ...\n        increment2({a, m});    // maybe typo, maybe m <= n is supposed\n        // ...\n    }\n\nNow, `m <= n` can be checked at the point of call (early) rather than later.\nIf all we had was a typo so that we meant to use `n` as the bound, the code could be further simplified (eliminating the possibility of an error):\n\n    void use3(int m)\n    {\n        const int n = 10;\n        int a[n] = {};\n        // ...\n        increment2(a);   // the number of elements of a need not be repeated\n        // ...\n    }\n\n##### Example, bad\n\nDon't repeatedly check the same value. Don't pass structured data as strings:\n\n    Date read_date(istream& is);    // read date from istream\n\n    Date extract_date(const string& s);    // extract date from string\n\n    void user1(const string& date)    // manipulate date\n    {\n        auto d = extract_date(date);\n        // ...\n    }\n\n    void user2()\n    {\n        Date d = read_date(cin);\n        // ...\n        user1(d.to_string());\n        // ...\n    }\n\nThe date is validated twice (by the `Date` constructor) and passed as a character string (unstructured data).\n\n##### Example\n\nExcess checking can be costly.\nThere are cases where checking early is inefficient because you might never need the value, or might only need part of the value that is more easily checked than the whole.

  // OK: no leak\n        // ...\n    }\n\n**See also**: [The resource management section](#S-resource)\n\n##### Note\n\nA leak is colloquially \"anything that isn't cleaned up.\"\nThe more important classification is \"anything that can no longer be cleaned up.\"\nFor example, allocating an object on the heap and then losing the last pointer that points to that allocation.\nThis rule should not be taken as requiring that allocations within long-lived objects must be returned during program shutdown.\nFor example, relying on system guaranteed cleanup such as file closing and memory deallocation upon process shutdown can simplify code.\nHowever, relying on abstractions that implicitly clean up can be as simple, and often safer.\n\n##### Note\n\nEnforcing [the lifetime safety profile](#SS-lifetime) eliminates leaks.\nWhen combined with resource safety provided by [RAII](#Rr-raii), it eliminates the need for \"garbage collection\" (by generating no garbage).\nCombine this with enforcement of [the type and bounds profiles](#SS-force) and you get complete type- and resource-safety, guaranteed by tools.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* Look at pointers: Classify them into non-owners (the default) and owners.\n  Where feasible, replace owners with standard-library resource handles (as in the example above).\n  Alternatively, mark an owner as such using `owner` from [the GSL](#gsl-guidelines-support-library).\n* Look for naked `new` and `delete`\n* Look for known resource allocating functions returning raw pointers (such as `fopen`, `malloc`, and `strdup`)\n\n### <a name=\"Rp-waste\"></a>P.9: Don't waste time or space\n\n##### Reason\n\nThis is C++.\n\n##### Note\n\nTime and space that you spend well to achieve a goal (e.g., speed of development, resource safety, or simplification of testing) is not wasted.\n\"Another benefit of striving for efficiency is that the process forces you to understand the problem in more depth.\" - Alex Stepanov\n\n##### Example, bad\n\n    struct X {\n        char ch;\n        int i;\n        string s;\n        char ch2;\n\n        X& operator=(const X& a);\n        X(const X&);\n    };\n\n    X waste(const char* p)\n    {\n        if (!p) throw Nullptr_error{};\n        int n = strlen(p);\n        auto buf = new char[n];\n        if (!buf) throw Allocation_error{};\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) buf[i] = p[i];\n        // ... manipulate buffer ...\n        X x;\n        x.ch = 'a';\n        x.s = string(n);    // give x.s space for *p\n        for (gsl::index i = 0; i < x.s.size(); ++i) x.s[i] = buf[i];  // copy buf into x.s\n        delete[] buf;\n        return x;\n    }\n\n    void driver()\n    {\n        X x = waste(\"Typical argument\");\n        // ...\n    }\n\nYes, this is a caricature, but we have seen every individual mistake in production code, and worse.\nNote that the layout of `X` guarantees that at least 6 bytes (and most likely more) are wasted.\nThe spurious definition of copy operations disables move semantics so that the return operation is slow\n(please note that the Return Value Optimization, RVO, is not guaranteed here).\nThe use of `new` and `delete` for `buf` is redundant; if we really needed a local string, we should use a local `string`.\nThere are several more performance bugs and gratuitous complication.\n\n##### Example, bad\n\n    void lower(zstring s)\n    {\n        for (int i = 0; i < strlen(s); ++i) s[i] = tolower(s[i]);\n    }\n\nThis is actually an example from production code.\nWe can see that in our condition we have `i < strlen(s)`. This expression will be evaluated on every iteration of the loop, which means that `strlen` must walk through string every loop to discover its length. While the string contents are changing, it's assumed that `tolower` will not affect the length of the string, so it's better to cache the length outside the loop and not incur that cost each iteration.\n\n##### Note\n\nAn individual example of waste is rarely significant, and where it is significant, it is typically easily eliminated by an expert.\nHowever, waste spread liberally across a code base can easily be significant and experts are not always as available as we would like.\nThe aim of this rule (and the more specific rules that support it) is to eliminate most waste related to the use of C++ before it happens.\nAfter that, we can look at waste related to algorithms and requirements, but that is beyond the scope of these guidelines.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nMany more specific rules aim at the overall goals of simplicity and elimination of gratuitous waste.\n\n* Flag an unused return value from a user-defined non-defaulted postfix `operator++` or `operator--` function. Prefer using the prefix form instead. (Note: \"User-defined non-defaulted\" is intended to reduce noise. Review this enforcement if it's still too noisy in practice.)\n\n\n### <a name=\"Rp-mutable\"></a>P.10: Prefer immutable data to mutable data\n\n##### Reason\n\nIt is easier to reason about constants than about variables.\nSomething immutable cannot change unexpectedly.\nSometimes immutability enables better optimization.\nYou can't have a data race on a constant.\n\nSee [Con: Constants and immutability](#S-const)\n\n### <a name=\"Rp-library\"></a>P.11: Encapsulate messy constructs, rather than spreading through the code\n\n##### Reason\n\nMessy code is more likely to hide bugs and harder to write.\nA good interface is easier and safer to use.\nMessy, low-level code breeds more such code.\n\n##### Example\n\n    int sz = 100;\n    int* p = (int*) malloc(sizeof(int) * sz);\n    int count = 0;\n    // ...\n    for (;;) {\n        // ... read an int into x, exit loop if end of file is reached ...\n        // ... check that x is valid ...\n        if (count == sz)\n            p = (int*) realloc(p, sizeof(int) * sz * 2);\n        p[count++] = x;\n        // ...\n    }\n\nThis is low-level, verbose, and error-prone.\nFor example, we \"forgot\" to test for memory exhaustion.\nInstead, we could use `vector`:\n\n    vector<int> v;\n    v.reserve(100);\n    // ...\n    for (int x; cin >> x; ) {\n        // ... check that x is valid ...\n        v.push_back(x);\n    }\n\n##### Note\n\nThe standards library and the GSL are examples of this philosophy.\nFor example, instead of messing with the arrays, unions, cast, tricky lifetime issues, `gsl::owner`, etc.,\nthat are needed to implement key abstractions, such as `vector`, `span`, `lock_guard`, and `future`, we use the libraries\ndesigned and implemented by people with more time and expertise than we usually have.\nSimilarly, we can and should design and implement more specialized libraries, rather than leaving the users (often ourselves)\nwith the challenge of repeatedly getting low-level code well.\nThis is a variant of the [subset of superset principle](#R0) that underlies these guidelines.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* Look for \"messy code\" such as complex pointer manipulation and casting outside the implementation of abstractions.\n\n\n### <a name=\"Rp-tools\"></a>P.12: Use supporting tools as appropriate\n\n##### Reason\n\nThere are many things that are done better \"by machine\".\nComputers don't tire or get bored by repetitive tasks.\nWe typically have better things to do than repeatedly do routine tasks.\n\n##### Example\n\nRun a static analyzer to verify that your code follows the guidelines you want it to follow.\n\n##### Note\n\nSee\n\n* [Static analysis tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tools_for_static_code_analysis)\n* [Concurrency tools](#Rconc-tools)\n* [Testing tools](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/tree/master)\n\nThere are many other kinds of tools, such as source code repositories, build tools, etc.,\nbut those are beyond the scope of these guidelines.\n\n##### Note\n\nBe careful not to become dependent on over-elaborate or over-specialized tool chains.\nThose can make your otherwise portable code non-portable.\n\n\n### <a name=\"Rp-lib\"></a>P.13: Use support libraries as appropriate\n\n##### Reason\n\nUsing a well-designed, well-documented, and well-supported library saves time and effort;\nits quality and documentation are likely to be greater than what you could do\nif the majority of your time must be spent on an implementation.\nThe cost (time, effort, money, etc.) of a library can be shared over many users.\nA widely used library is more likely to be kept up-to-date and ported to new systems than an individual application.\nKnowledge of a widely-used library can save time on other/future projects.\nSo, if a suitable library exists for your application domain, use it.\n\n##### Example\n\n    std::sort(begin(v), end(v), std::greater<>());\n\nUnless you are an expert in sorting algorithms and have plenty of time,\nthis is more likely to be correct and to run faster than anything you write for a specific application.\nYou need a reason not to use the standard library (or whatever foundational libraries your application uses) rather than a reason to use it.\n\n##### Note\n\nBy default use\n\n* The [ISO C++ Standard Library](#sl-the-standard-library)\n* The [Guidelines Support Library](#gsl-guidelines-support-library)\n\n##### Note\n\nIf no well-designed, well-documented, and well-supported library exists for an important domain,\nmaybe you should design and implement it, and then use it.\n\n\n# <a name=\"S-interfaces\"></a>I: Interfaces\n\nAn interface is a contract between two parts of a program. Precisely stating what is expected of a supplier of a service and a user of that service is essential.\nHaving good (easy-to-understand, encouraging efficient use, not error-prone, supporting testing, etc.) interfaces is probably the most important single aspect of code organization.\n\nInterface rule summary:\n\n* [I.1: Make interfaces explicit](#Ri-explicit)\n* [I.2: Avoid non-`const` global variables](#Ri-global)\n* [I.3: Avoid singletons](#Ri-singleton)\n* [I.4: Make interfaces precisely and strongly typed](#Ri-typed)\n* [I.5: State preconditions (if any)](#Ri-pre)\n* [I.6: Prefer `Expects()` for expressing preconditions](#Ri-expects)\n* [I.7: State postconditions](#Ri-post)\n* [I.8: Prefer `Ensures()` for expressing postconditions](#Ri-ensures)\n* [I.9: If an interface is a template, document its parameters using concepts](#Ri-concepts)\n* [I.10: Use exceptions to signal a failure to perform a required task](#Ri-except)\n* [I.11: Never transfer ownership by a raw pointer (`T*`) or reference (`T&`)](#Ri-raw)\n* [I.12: Declare a pointer that must not be null as `not_null`](#Ri-nullptr)\n* [I.13: Do not pass an array as a single pointer](#Ri-array)\n* [I.22: Avoid complex initialization of global objects](#Ri-global-init)\n* [I.23: Keep the number of function arguments low](#Ri-nargs)\n* [I.24: Avoid adjacent parameters that can be invoked by the same arguments in either order with different meaning](#Ri-unrelated)\n* [I.25: Prefer empty abstract classes as interfaces to class hierarchies](#Ri-abstract)\n* [I.26: If you want a cross-compiler ABI, use a C-style subset](#Ri-abi)\n* [I.27: For stable library ABI, consider the Pimpl idiom](#Ri-pimpl)\n* [I.30: Encapsulate rule violations](#Ri-encapsulate)\n\n**See also**:\n\n* [F: Functions](#S-functions)\n* [C.concrete: Concrete types](#SS-concrete)\n* [C.hier: Class hierarchies](#SS-hier)\n* [C.over: Overloading and overloaded operators](#SS-overload)\n* [C.con: Containers and other resource handles](#SS-containers)\n* [E: Error handling](#S-errors)\n* [T: Templates and generic programming](#S-templates)\n\n### <a name=\"Ri-explicit\"></a>I.1: Make interfaces explicit\n\n##### Reason\n\nCorrectness. Assumptions not stated in an interface are easily overlooked and hard to test.\n\n##### Example, bad\n\nControlling the behavior of a function through a global (namespace scope) variable (a call mode) is implicit and potentially confusing. For example:\n\n    int round(double d)\n    {\n        return (round_up) ? ceil(d) : d;    // don't: \"invisible\" dependency\n    }\n\nIt will not be obvious to a caller that the meaning of two calls of `round(7.2)` might give different results.\n\n##### Exception\n\nSometimes we control the details of a set of operations by an environment variable, e.g., normal vs. verbose output or debug vs. optimized.\nThe use of a non-local control is potentially confusing, but controls only implementation details of otherwise fixed semantics.\n\n##### Example, bad\n\nReporting through non-local variables (e.g., `errno`) is easily ignored. For example:\n\n    // don't: no test of fprintf's return value\n    fprintf(connection, \"logging: %d %d %d\\n\", x, y, s);\n\nWhat if the connection goes down so that no logging output is produced? See I.???.\n\n**Alternative**: Throw an exception. An exception cannot be ignored.\n\n**Alternative formulation**: Avoid passing information across an interface through non-local or implicit state.\nNote that non-`const` member functions pass information to other member functions through their object's state.\n\n**Alternative formulation**: An interface should be a function or a set of functions.\nFunctions can be function templates and sets of functions can be classes or class templates.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* (Simple) A function should not make control-flow decisions based on the values of variables declared at namespace scope.\n* (Simple) A function should not write to variables declared at namespace scope.\n\n### <a name=\"Ri-global\"></a>I.2: Avoid non-`const` global variables\n\n##### Reason\n\nNon-`const` global variables hide dependencies and make the dependencies subject to unpredictable changes.\n\n##### Example\n\n    struct Data {\n        // ... lots of stuff ...\n    } data;            // non-const data\n\n    void compute()     // don't\n    {\n        // ... use data ...\n    }\n\n    void output()     // don't\n    {\n        // ... use data ...\n    }\n\nWho else might modify `data`?\n\n**Warning**: The initialization of global objects is not totally ordered.\nIf you use a global object initialize it with a constant.\nNote that it is possible to get undefined initialization order even for `const` objects.\n\n##### Exception\n\nA global object is often better than a singleton.\n\n##### Note\n\nGlobal constants are useful.\n\n##### Note\n\nThe rule against global variables applies to namespace scope variables as well.\n\n**Alternative**: If you use global (more generally namespace scope) data to avoid copying, consider passing the data as an object by reference to `const`.\nAnother solution is to define the data as the state of some object and the operations as member functions.\n\n**Warning**: Beware of data races: If one thread can access non-local data (or data passed by reference) while another thread executes the callee, we can have a data race.\nEvery pointer or reference to mutable data is a potential data race.\n\nUsing global pointers or references to access and change non-const, and otherwise non-global,\ndata isn't a better alternative to non-const global variables since that doesn't solve the issues of hidden dependencies or potential race conditions.\n\n##### Note\n\nYou cannot have a race condition on immutable data.\n\n**References**: See the [rules for calling functions](#SS-call).\n\n##### Note\n\nThe rule is \"avoid\", not \"don't use.\" Of course there will be (rare) exceptions, such as `cin`, `cout`, and `cerr`.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n(Simple) Report all non-`const` variables declared at namespace scope and global pointers/references to non-const data.\n\n\n### <a name=\"Ri-singleton\"></a>I.3: Avoid singletons\n\n##### Reason\n\nSingletons are basically complicated global objects in disguise.\n\n##### Example\n\n    class Singleton {\n        // ... lots of stuff to ensure that only one Singleton object is created,\n        // that it is initialized properly, etc.\n    };\n\nThere are many variants of the singleton idea.\nThat's part of the problem.\n\n##### Note\n\nIf you don't want a global object to change, declare it `const` or `constexpr`.\n\n##### Exception\n\nYou can use the simplest \"singleton\" (so simple that it is often not considered a singleton) to get initialization on first use, if any:\n\n    X& myX()\n    {\n        static X my_x {3};\n        return my_x;\n    }\n\nThis is one of the most effective solutions to problems related to initialization order.\nIn a multi-threaded environment, the initialization of the static object does not introduce a race condition\n(unless you carelessly access a shared object from within its constructor).\n\nNote that the initialization of a local `static` does not imply a race condition.\nHowever, if the destruction of `X` involves an operation that needs to be synchronized we must use a less simple solution.\nFor example:\n\n    X& myX()\n    {\n        static auto p = new X {3};\n        return *p;  // potential leak\n    }\n\nNow someone must `delete` that object in some suitably thread-safe way.\nThat's error-prone, so we don't use that technique unless\n\n* `myX` is in multi-threaded code,\n* that `X` object needs to be destroyed (e.g., because it releases a resource), and\n* `X`'s destructor's code needs to be synchronized.\n\nIf you, as many do, define a singleton as a class for which only one object is created, functions like `myX` are not singletons, and this useful technique is not an exception to the no-singleton rule.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nVery hard in general.\n\n* Look for classes with names that include `singleton`.\n* Look for classes for which only a single object is created (by counting objects or by examining constructors).\n* If a class X has a public static function that contains a function-local static of the class' type X and returns a pointer or reference to it, ban that.\n\n### <a name=\"Ri-typed\"></a>I.4: Make interfaces precisely and strongly typed\n\n##### Reason\n\nTypes are the simplest and best documentation, improve legibility due to their well-defined meaning, and are checked at compile time.\nAlso, precisely typed code is often optimized better.\n\n##### Example, don't\n\nConsider:\n\n    void pass(void* data);    // weak and under qualified type void* is suspicious\n\nCallers are unsure what types are allowed and if the data may\nbe mutated as `const` is not specified. Note all pointer types\nimplicitly convert to `void*`, so it is easy for callers to provide this value.\n\nThe callee must `static_cast` data to an unverified type to use it.\nThat is error-prone and verbose.\n\nOnly use `const void*` for passing in data in designs that are indescribable in C++. Consider using a `variant` or a pointer to base instead.\n\n**Alternative**: Often, a template parameter can eliminate the `void*` turning it into a `T*` or `T&`.\nFor generic code these `T`s can be general or concept constrained template parameters.\n\n##### Example, bad\n\nConsider:\n\n    draw_rect(100, 200, 100, 500); // what do the numbers specify?\n\n    draw_rect(p.x, p.y, 10, 20); // what units are 10 and 20 in?\n\nIt is clear that the caller is describing a rectangle, but it is unclear what parts they relate to. Also, an `int` can carry arbitrary forms of information, including values of many units, so we must guess about the meaning of the four `int`s. Most likely, the first two are an `x`,`y` coordinate pair, but what are the last two?\n\nComments and parameter names can help, but we could be explicit:\n\n    void draw_rectangle(Point top_left, Point bottom_right);\n    void draw_rectangle(Point top_left, Size height_width);\n\n    draw_rectangle(p, Point{10, 20});  // two corners\n    draw_rectangle(p, Size{10, 20});   // one corner and a (height, width) pair\n\nObviously, we cannot catch all errors through the static type system\n(e.g., the fact that a first argument is supposed to be a top-left point is left to convention (naming and comments)).\n\n##### Example, bad\n\nConsider:\n\n    set_settings(true, false, 42); // what do the numbers specify?\n\nThe parameter types and their values do not communicate what settings are being specified or what those values mean.\n\nThis design is more explicit, safe and legible:\n\n    alarm_settings s{};\n    s.enabled = true;\n    s.displayMode = alarm_settings::mode::spinning_light;\n    s.frequency = alarm_settings::every_10_seconds;\n    set_settings(s);\n\nFor the case of a set of boolean values consider using a flags `enum`; a pattern that expresses a set of boolean values.\n\n    enable_lamp_options(lamp_option::on | lamp_option::animate_state_transitions);\n\n##### Example, bad\n\nIn the following example, it is not clear from the interface what `time_to_blink` means: Seconds? Milliseconds?\n\n    void blink_led(int time_to_blink) // bad -- the unit is ambiguous\n    {\n        // ...\n        // do something with time_to_blink\n        // ...\n    }\n\n    void use()\n    {\n        blink_led(2);\n    }\n\n##### Example, good\n\n`std::chrono::duration` types helps making the unit of time duration explicit.\n\n    void blink_led(milliseconds time_to_blink) // good -- the unit is explicit\n    {\n        // ...\n        // do something with time_to_blink\n        // ...\n    }\n\n    void use()\n    {\n        blink_led(1500ms);\n    }\n\nThe function can also be written in such a way that it will accept any time duration unit.\n\n    template<class rep, class period>\n    void blink_led(duration<rep, period> time_to_blink) // good -- accepts any unit\n    {\n        // assuming that millisecond is the smallest relevant unit\n        auto milliseconds_to_blink = duration_cast<milliseconds>(time_to_blink);\n        // ...\n        // do something with milliseconds_to_blink\n        // ...\n    }\n\n    void use()\n    {\n        blink_led(2s);\n        blink_led(1500ms);\n    }\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* (Simple) Report the use of `void*` as a parameter or return type.\n* (Simple) Report the use of more than one `bool` parameter.\n* (Hard to do well) Look for functions that use too many primitive type arguments.\n\n### <a name=\"Ri-pre\"></a>I.5: State preconditions (if any)\n\n##### Reason\n\nArguments have meaning that might constrain their proper use in the callee.\n\n##### Example\n\nConsider:\n\n    double sqrt(double x);\n\nHere `x` must be non-negative. The type system cannot (easily and naturally) express that, so we must use other means. For example:\n\n    double sqrt(double x); // x must be non-negative\n\nSome preconditions can be expressed as assertions. For example:\n\n    double sqrt(double x) { Expects(x >= 0); /* ... */ }\n\nIdeally, that `Expects(x >= 0)` should be part of the interface of `sqrt()` but that's not easily done.

Domain specific checkers (like lock-holding\ncheckers) exist for many toolchains.\n\n### <a name=\"Ri-ensures\"></a>I.8: Prefer `Ensures()` for expressing postconditions\n\n##### Reason\n\nTo make it clear that the condition is a postcondition and to enable tool use.\n\n##### Example\n\n    void f()\n    {\n        char buffer[MAX];\n        // ...\n        memset(buffer, 0, MAX);\n        Ensures(buffer[0] == 0);\n    }\n\n##### Note\n\nPostconditions can be stated in many ways, including comments, `if`-statements, and `assert()`.\nThis can make them hard to distinguish from ordinary code, hard to update, hard to manipulate by tools, and might have the wrong semantics.\n\n**Alternative**: Postconditions of the form \"this resource must be released\" are best expressed by [RAII](#Rr-raii).\n\n##### Note\n\nIdeally, that `Ensures` should be part of the interface, but that's not easily done.\nFor now, we place it in the definition (function body).\nOnce language support becomes available (e.g., see the [contract proposal](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0380r1.pdf)) we will adopt the standard version of preconditions, postconditions, and assertions.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n(Not enforceable) Finding the variety of ways postconditions can be asserted is not feasible. Warning about those that can be easily identified (`assert()`) has questionable value in the absence of a language facility.\n\n### <a name=\"Ri-concepts\"></a>I.9: If an interface is a template, document its parameters using concepts\n\n##### Reason\n\nMake the interface precisely specified and compile-time checkable in the (not so distant) future.\n\n##### Example\n\nUse the C++20 style of requirements specification. For example:\n\n    template<typename Iter, typename Val>\n      requires input_iterator<Iter> && equality_comparable_with<iter_value_t<Iter>, Val>\n    Iter find(Iter first, Iter last, Val v)\n    {\n        // ...\n    }\n\n**See also**: [Generic programming](#SS-GP) and [concepts](#SS-concepts).\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nWarn if any non-variadic template parameter is not constrained by a concept (in its declaration or mentioned in a `requires` clause).\n\n### <a name=\"Ri-except\"></a>I.10: Use exceptions to signal a failure to perform a required task\n\n##### Reason\n\nIt should not be possible to ignore an error because that could leave the system or a computation in an undefined (or unexpected) state.\nThis is a major source of errors.\n\n##### Example\n\n    int printf(const char* ...);    // bad: return negative number if output fails\n\n    template<class F, class ...Args>\n    // good: throw system_error if unable to start the new thread\n    explicit thread(F&& f, Args&&... args);\n\n##### Note\n\nWhat is an error?\n\nAn error means that the function cannot achieve its advertised purpose (including establishing postconditions).\nCalling code that ignores an error could lead to wrong results or undefined systems state.\nFor example, not being able to connect to a remote server is not by itself an error:\nthe server can refuse a connection for all kinds of reasons, so the natural thing is to return a result that the caller should always check.\nHowever, if failing to make a connection is considered an error, then a failure should throw an exception.\n\n##### Exception\n\nMany traditional interface functions (e.g., UNIX signal handlers) use error codes (e.g., `errno`) to report what are really status codes, rather than errors. You don't have a good alternative to using such, so calling these does not violate the rule.\n\n##### Alternative\n\nIf you can't use exceptions (e.g., because your code is full of old-style raw-pointer use or because there are hard-real-time constraints), consider using a style that returns a pair of values:\n\n    int val;\n    int error_code;\n    tie(val, error_code) = do_something();\n    if (error_code) {\n        // ... handle the error or exit ...\n    }\n    // ... use val ...\n\nThis style unfortunately leads to uninitialized variables.\nSince C++17 the \"structured bindings\" feature can be used to initialize variables directly from the return value:\n\n    auto [val, error_code] = do_something();\n    if (error_code) {\n        // ... handle the error or exit ...\n    }\n    // ... use val ...\n\n##### Note\n\nWe don't consider \"performance\" a valid reason not to use exceptions.\n\n* Often, explicit error checking and handling consume as much time and space as exception handling.\n* Often, cleaner code yields better performance with exceptions (simplifying the tracing of paths through the program and their optimization).\n* A good rule for performance critical code is to move checking outside the [critical](#Rper-critical) part of the code.\n* In the longer term, more regular code gets better optimized.\n* Always carefully [measure](#Rper-measure) before making performance claims.\n\n**See also**: [I.5](#Ri-pre) and [I.7](#Ri-post) for reporting precondition and postcondition violations.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* (Not enforceable) This is a philosophical guideline that is infeasible to check directly.\n* Look for `errno`.\n\n### <a name=\"Ri-raw\"></a>I.11: Never transfer ownership by a raw pointer (`T*`) or reference (`T&`)\n\n##### Reason\n\nIf there is any doubt whether the caller or the callee owns an object, leaks or premature destruction will occur.\n\n##### Example\n\nConsider:\n\n    X* compute(args)    // don't\n    {\n        X* res = new X{};\n        // ...\n        return res;\n    }\n\nWho deletes the returned `X`? The problem would be harder to spot if `compute` returned a reference.\nConsider returning the result by value (use move semantics if the result is large):\n\n    vector<double> compute(args)  // good\n    {\n        vector<double> res(10000);\n        // ...\n        return res;\n    }\n\n**Alternative**: [Pass ownership](#Rr-smartptrparam) using a \"smart pointer\", such as `unique_ptr` (for exclusive ownership) and `shared_ptr` (for shared ownership).\nHowever, that is less elegant and often less efficient than returning the object itself,\nso use smart pointers only if reference semantics are needed.\n\n**Alternative**: Sometimes older code can't be modified because of ABI compatibility requirements or lack of resources.\nIn that case, mark owning pointers using `owner` from the [guidelines support library](#gsl-guidelines-support-library):\n\n    owner<X*> compute(args)    // It is now clear that ownership is transferred\n    {\n        owner<X*> res = new X{};\n        // ...\n        return res;\n    }\n\nThis tells analysis tools that `res` is an owner.\nThat is, its value must be `delete`d or transferred to another owner, as is done here by the `return`.\n\n`owner` is used similarly in the implementation of resource handles.\n\n##### Note\n\nEvery object passed as a raw pointer (or iterator) is assumed to be owned by the\ncaller, so that its lifetime is handled by the caller. Viewed another way:\nownership transferring APIs are relatively rare compared to pointer-passing APIs,\nso the default is \"no ownership transfer.\"\n\n**See also**: [Argument passing](#Rf-conventional), [use of smart pointer arguments](#Rr-smartptrparam), and [value return](#Rf-value-return).\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* (Simple) Warn on `delete` of a raw pointer that is not an `owner<T>`. Suggest use of standard-library resource handle or use of `owner<T>`.\n* (Simple) Warn on failure to either `reset` or explicitly `delete` an `owner` pointer on every code path.\n* (Simple) Warn if the return value of `new` or a function call with an `owner` return value is assigned to a raw pointer or non-`owner` reference.\n\n### <a name=\"Ri-nullptr\"></a>I.12: Declare a pointer that must not be null as `not_null`\n\n##### Reason\n\nTo help avoid dereferencing `nullptr` errors.\nTo improve performance by avoiding redundant checks for `nullptr`.\n\n##### Example\n\n    int length(const char* p);            // it is not clear whether length(nullptr) is valid\n\n    length(nullptr);                      // OK?\n\n    int length(not_null<const char*> p);  // better: we can assume that p cannot be nullptr\n\n    int length(const char* p);            // we must assume that p can be nullptr\n\nBy stating the intent in source, implementers and tools can provide better diagnostics, such as finding some classes of errors through static analysis, and perform optimizations, such as removing branches and null tests.\n\n##### Note\n\n`not_null` is defined in the [guidelines support library](#gsl-guidelines-support-library).\n\n##### Note\n\nThe assumption that the pointer to `char` pointed to a C-style string (a zero-terminated string of characters) was still implicit, and a potential source of confusion and errors. Use `czstring` in preference to `const char*`.\n\n    // we can assume that p cannot be nullptr\n    // we can assume that p points to a zero-terminated array of characters\n    int length(not_null<czstring> p);\n\nNote: `length()` is, of course, `std::strlen()` in disguise.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* (Simple) ((Foundation)) If a function checks a pointer parameter against `nullptr` before access, on all control-flow paths, then warn it should be declared `not_null`.\n* (Complex) If a function with pointer return value ensures it is not `nullptr` on all return paths, then warn the return type should be declared `not_null`.\n\n### <a name=\"Ri-array\"></a>I.13: Do not pass an array as a single pointer\n\n##### Reason\n\n (pointer, size)-style interfaces are error-prone. Also, a plain pointer (to array) must rely on some convention to allow the callee to determine the size.\n\n##### Example\n\nConsider:\n\n    void copy_n(const T* p, T* q, int n); // copy from [p:p+n) to [q:q+n)\n\nWhat if there are fewer than `n` elements in the array pointed to by `q`? Then, we overwrite some probably unrelated memory.\nWhat if there are fewer than `n` elements in the array pointed to by `p`? Then, we read some probably unrelated memory.\nEither is undefined behavior and a potentially very nasty bug.\n\n##### Alternative\n\nConsider using explicit spans:\n\n    void copy(span<const T> r, span<T> r2); // copy r to r2\n\n##### Example, bad\n\nConsider:\n\n    void draw(Shape* p, int n);  // poor interface; poor code\n    Circle arr[10];\n    // ...\n    draw(arr, 10);\n\nPassing `10` as the `n` argument might be a mistake: the most common convention is to assume `[0:n)` but that is nowhere stated. Worse is that the call of `draw()` compiled at all: there was an implicit conversion from array to pointer (array decay) and then another implicit conversion from `Circle` to `Shape`. There is no way that `draw()` can safely iterate through that array: it has no way of knowing the size of the elements.\n\n**Alternative**: Use a support class that ensures that the number of elements is correct and prevents dangerous implicit conversions. For example:\n\n    void draw2(span<Circle>);\n    Circle arr[10];\n    // ...\n    draw2(span<Circle>(arr));  // deduce the number of elements\n    draw2(arr);    // deduce the element type and array size\n\n    void draw3(span<Shape>);\n    draw3(arr);    // error: cannot convert Circle[10] to span<Shape>\n\nThis `draw2()` passes the same amount of information to `draw()`, but makes the fact that it is supposed to be a range of `Circle`s explicit. See ???.\n\n##### Exception\n\nUse `zstring` and `czstring` to represent C-style, zero-terminated strings.\nBut when doing so, use `std::string_view` or `span<char>` from the [GSL](#gsl-guidelines-support-library) to prevent range errors.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* (Simple) ((Bounds)) Warn for any expression that would rely on implicit conversion of an array type to a pointer type. Allow exception for zstring/czstring pointer types.\n* (Simple) ((Bounds)) Warn for any arithmetic operation on an expression of pointer type that results in a value of pointer type. Allow exception for zstring/czstring pointer types.\n\n### <a name=\"Ri-global-init\"></a>I.22: Avoid complex initialization of global objects\n\n##### Reason\n\nComplex initialization can lead to undefined order of execution.\n\n##### Example\n\n    // file1.c\n\n    extern const X x;\n\n    const Y y = f(x);   // read x; write y\n\n    // file2.c\n\n    extern const Y y;\n\n    const X x = g(y);   // read y; write x\n\nSince `x` and `y` are in different translation units the order of calls to `f()` and `g()` is undefined;\none will access an uninitialized `const`.\nThis shows that the order-of-initialization problem for global (namespace scope) objects is not limited to global *variables*.\n\n##### Note\n\nOrder of initialization problems become particularly difficult to handle in concurrent code.\nIt is usually best to avoid global (namespace scope) objects altogether.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* Flag initializers of globals that call non-`constexpr` functions\n* Flag initializers of globals that access `extern` objects\n\n### <a name=\"Ri-nargs\"></a>I.23: Keep the number of function arguments low\n\n##### Reason\n\nHaving many arguments opens opportunities for confusion. Passing lots of arguments is often costly compared to alternatives.\n\n##### Discussion\n\nThe two most common reasons why functions have too many parameters are:\n\n1. *Missing an abstraction.*\n   There is an abstraction missing, so that a compound value is being\n   passed as individual elements instead of as a single object that enforces an invariant.\n   This not only expands the parameter list, but it leads to errors because the component values\n   are no longer protected by an enforced invariant.\n\n2. *Violating \"one function, one responsibility.\"*\n   The function is trying to do more than one job and should probably be refactored.\n\n##### Example\n\nThe standard-library `merge()` is at the limit of what we can comfortably handle:\n\n    template<class InputIterator1, class InputIterator2, class OutputIterator, class Compare>\n    OutputIterator merge(InputIterator1 first1, InputIterator1 last1,\n                         InputIterator2 first2, InputIterator2 last2,\n                         OutputIterator result, Compare comp);\n\nNote that this is because of problem 1 above -- missing abstraction. Instead of passing a range (abstraction), STL passed iterator pairs (unencapsulated component values).\n\nHere, we have four template arguments and six function arguments.\nTo simplify the most frequent and simplest uses, the comparison argument can be defaulted to `<`:\n\n    template<class InputIterator1, class InputIterator2, class OutputIterator>\n    OutputIterator merge(InputIterator1 first1, InputIterator1 last1,\n                         InputIterator2 first2, InputIterator2 last2,\n                         OutputIterator result);\n\nThis doesn't reduce the total complexity, but it reduces the surface complexity presented to many users.\nTo really reduce the number of arguments, we need to bundle the arguments into higher-level abstractions:\n\n    template<class InputRange1, class InputRange2, class OutputIterator>\n    OutputIterator merge(InputRange1 r1, InputRange2 r2, OutputIterator result);\n\nGrouping arguments into \"bundles\" is a general technique to reduce the number of arguments and to increase the opportunities for checking.\n\nAlternatively, we could use a standard library concept to define the notion of three types that must be usable for merging:\n\n    template<class In1, class In2, class Out>\n      requires mergeable<In1, In2, Out>\n    Out merge(In1 r1, In2 r2, Out result);\n\n##### Example\n\nThe safety Profiles recommend replacing\n\n    void f(int* some_ints, int some_ints_length);  // BAD: C style, unsafe\n\nwith\n\n    void f(gsl::span<int> some_ints);              // GOOD: safe, bounds-checked\n\nHere, using an abstraction has safety and robustness benefits, and naturally also reduces the number of parameters.\n\n##### Note\n\nHow many parameters are too many? Try to use fewer than four (4) parameters.\nThere are functions that are best expressed with four individual parameters, but not many.\n\n**Alternative**: Use better abstraction: Group arguments into meaningful objects and pass the objects (by value or by reference).\n\n**Alternative**: Use default arguments or overloads to allow the most common forms of calls to be done with fewer arguments.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* Warn when a function declares two iterators (including pointers) of the same type instead of a range or a view.\n* (Not enforceable) This is a philosophical guideline that is infeasible to check directly.\n\n### <a name=\"Ri-unrelated\"></a>I.24: Avoid adjacent parameters that can be invoked by the same arguments in either order with different meaning\n\n##### Reason\n\nAdjacent arguments of the same type are easily swapped by mistake.\n\n##### Example, bad\n\nConsider:\n\n    void copy_n(T* p, T* q, int n);  // copy from [p:p + n) to [q:q + n)\n\nThis is a nasty variant of a K&R C-style interface. It is easy to reverse the \"to\" and \"from\" arguments.\n\nUse `const` for the \"from\" argument:\n\n    void copy_n(const T* p, T* q, int n);  // copy from [p:p + n) to [q:q + n)\n\n##### Exception\n\nIf the order of the parameters is not important, there is no problem:\n\n    int max(int a, int b);\n\n##### Alternative\n\nDon't pass arrays as pointers, pass an object representing a range (e.g., a `span`):\n\n    void copy_n(span<const T> p, span<T> q);  // copy from p to q\n\n##### Alternative\n\nDefine a `struct` as the parameter type and name the fields for those parameters accordingly:\n\n    struct SystemParams {\n        string config_file;\n        string output_path;\n        seconds timeout;\n    };\n    void initialize(SystemParams p);\n\nThis tends to make invocations of this clear to future readers, as the parameters\nare often filled in by name at the call site.\n\n##### Note\n\nOnly the interface's designer can adequately address the source of violations of this guideline.\n\n##### Enforcement strategy\n\n(Simple) Warn if two consecutive parameters share the same type\n\nWe are still looking for a less-simple enforcement.\n\n### <a name=\"Ri-abstract\"></a>I.25: Prefer empty abstract classes as interfaces to class hierarchies\n\n##### Reason\n\nAbstract classes that are empty (have no non-static member data) are more likely to be stable than base classes with state.\n\n##### Example, bad\n\nYou just knew that `Shape` would turn up somewhere :-)\n\n    class Shape {  // bad: interface class loaded with data\n    public:\n        Point center() const { return c; }\n        virtual void draw() const;\n        virtual void rotate(int);\n        // ...\n    private:\n        Point c;\n        vector<Point> outline;\n        Color col;\n    };\n\nThis will force every derived class to compute a center -- even if that's non-trivial and the center is never used. Similarly, not every `Shape` has a `Color`, and many `Shape`s are best represented without an outline defined as a sequence of `Point`s.

definition is a function declaration that also specifies the function's implementation, the function body.\n\n### <a name=\"Rf-package\"></a>F.1: \"Package\" meaningful operations as carefully named functions\n\n##### Reason\n\nFactoring out common code makes code more readable, more likely to be reused, and limit errors from complex code.\nIf something is a well-specified action, separate it out from its surrounding code and give it a name.\n\n##### Example, don't\n\n    void read_and_print(istream& is)    // read and print an int\n    {\n        int x;\n        if (is >> x)\n            cout << \"the int is \" << x << '\\n';\n        else\n            cerr << \"no int on input\\n\";\n    }\n\nAlmost everything is wrong with `read_and_print`.\nIt reads, it writes (to a fixed `ostream`), it writes error messages (to a fixed `ostream`), it handles only `int`s.\nThere is nothing to reuse, logically separate operations are intermingled and local variables are in scope after the end of their logical use.\nFor a tiny example, this looks OK, but if the input operation, the output operation, and the error handling had been more complicated the tangled\nmess could become hard to understand.\n\n##### Note\n\nIf you write a non-trivial lambda that potentially can be used in more than one place, give it a name by assigning it to a (usually non-local) variable.\n\n##### Example\n\n    sort(a, b, [](T x, T y) { return x.rank() < y.rank() && x.value() < y.value(); });\n\nNaming that lambda breaks up the expression into its logical parts and provides a strong hint to the meaning of the lambda.\n\n    auto lessT = [](T x, T y) { return x.rank() < y.rank() && x.value() < y.value(); };\n\n    sort(a, b, lessT);\n\nThe shortest code is not always the best for performance or maintainability.\n\n##### Exception\n\nLoop bodies, including lambdas used as loop bodies, rarely need to be named.\nHowever, large loop bodies (e.g., dozens of lines or dozens of pages) can be a problem.\nThe rule [Keep functions short and simple](#Rf-single) implies \"Keep loop bodies short.\"\nSimilarly, lambdas used as callback arguments are sometimes non-trivial, yet unlikely to be reusable.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* See [Keep functions short and simple](#Rf-single)\n* Flag identical and very similar lambdas used in different places.\n\n### <a name=\"Rf-logical\"></a>F.2: A function should perform a single logical operation\n\n##### Reason\n\nA function that performs a single operation is simpler to understand, test, and reuse.\n\n##### Example\n\nConsider:\n\n    void read_and_print()    // bad\n    {\n        int x;\n        cin >> x;\n        // check for errors\n        cout << x << \"\\n\";\n    }\n\nThis is a monolith that is tied to a specific input and will never find another (different) use. Instead, break functions up into suitable logical parts and parameterize:\n\n    int read(istream& is)    // better\n    {\n        int x;\n        is >> x;\n        // check for errors\n        return x;\n    }\n\n    void print(ostream& os, int x)\n    {\n        os << x << \"\\n\";\n    }\n\nThese can now be combined where needed:\n\n    void read_and_print()\n    {\n        auto x = read(cin);\n        print(cout, x);\n    }\n\nIf there was a need, we could further templatize `read()` and `print()` on the data type, the I/O mechanism, the response to errors, etc. Example:\n\n    auto read = [](auto& input, auto& value)    // better\n    {\n        input >> value;\n        // check for errors\n    };\n\n    void print(auto& output, const auto& value)\n    {\n        output << value << \"\\n\";\n    }\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* Consider functions with more than one \"out\" parameter suspicious. Use return values instead, including `tuple` for multiple return values.\n* Consider \"large\" functions that don't fit on one editor screen suspicious. Consider factoring such a function into smaller well-named suboperations.\n* Consider functions with 7 or more parameters suspicious.\n\n### <a name=\"Rf-single\"></a>F.3: Keep functions short and simple\n\n##### Reason\n\nLarge functions are hard to read, more likely to contain complex code, and more likely to have variables in larger than minimal scopes.\nFunctions with complex control structures are more likely to be long and more likely to hide logical errors\n\n##### Example\n\nConsider:\n\n    double simple_func(double val, int flag1, int flag2)\n        // simple_func: takes a value and calculates the expected ASIC output,\n        // given the two mode flags.\n    {\n        double intermediate;\n        if (flag1 > 0) {\n            intermediate = func1(val);\n            if (flag2 % 2)\n                 intermediate = sqrt(intermediate);\n        }\n        else if (flag1 == -1) {\n            intermediate = func1(-val);\n            if (flag2 % 2)\n                 intermediate = sqrt(-intermediate);\n            flag1 = -flag1;\n        }\n        if (abs(flag2) > 10) {\n            intermediate = func2(intermediate);\n        }\n        switch (flag2 / 10) {\n        case 1: if (flag1 == -1) return finalize(intermediate, 1.171);\n                break;\n        case 2: return finalize(intermediate, 13.1);\n        default: break;\n        }\n        return finalize(intermediate, 0.);\n    }\n\nThis is too complex.\nHow would you know if all possible alternatives have been correctly handled?\nYes, it breaks other rules also.\n\nWe can refactor:\n\n    double func1_muon(double val, int flag)\n    {\n        // ???\n    }\n\n    double func1_tau(double val, int flag1, int flag2)\n    {\n        // ???\n    }\n\n    double simple_func(double val, int flag1, int flag2)\n        // simple_func: takes a value and calculates the expected ASIC output,\n        // given the two mode flags.\n    {\n        if (flag1 > 0)\n            return func1_muon(val, flag2);\n        if (flag1 == -1)\n            // handled by func1_tau: flag1 = -flag1;\n            return func1_tau(-val, flag1, flag2);\n        return 0.;\n    }\n\n##### Note\n\n\"It doesn't fit on a screen\" is often a good practical definition of \"far too large.\"\nOne-to-five-line functions should be considered normal.\n\n##### Note\n\nBreak large functions up into smaller cohesive and named functions.\nSmall simple functions are easily inlined where the cost of a function call is significant.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* Flag functions that do not \"fit on a screen.\"\n  How big is a screen? Try 60 lines by 140 characters; that's roughly the maximum that's comfortable for a book page.\n* Flag functions that are too complex. How complex is too complex?\n  You could use cyclomatic complexity. Try \"more than 10 logical paths through.\" Count a simple switch as one path.\n\n### <a name=\"Rf-constexpr\"></a>F.4: If a function might have to be evaluated at compile time, declare it `constexpr`\n\n##### Reason\n\n `constexpr` is needed to tell the compiler to allow compile-time evaluation.\n\n##### Example\n\nThe (in)famous factorial:\n\n    constexpr int fac(int n)\n    {\n        constexpr int max_exp = 17;      // constexpr enables max_exp to be used in Expects\n        Expects(0 <= n && n < max_exp);  // prevent silliness and overflow\n        int x = 1;\n        for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) x *= i;\n        return x;\n    }\n\nThis is C++14.\nFor C++11, use a recursive formulation of `fac()`.\n\n##### Note\n\n`constexpr` does not guarantee compile-time evaluation;\nit just guarantees that the function can be evaluated at compile time for constant expression arguments if the programmer requires it or the compiler decides to do so to optimize.\n\n    constexpr int min(int x, int y) { return x < y ? x : y; }\n\n    void test(int v)\n    {\n        int m1 = min(-1, 2);            // probably compile-time evaluation\n        constexpr int m2 = min(-1, 2);  // compile-time evaluation\n        int m3 = min(-1, v);            // run-time evaluation\n        constexpr int m4 = min(-1, v);  // error: cannot evaluate at compile time\n    }\n\n##### Note\n\nDon't try to make all functions `constexpr`.\nMost computation is best done at run time.\n\n##### Note\n\nAny API that might eventually depend on high-level run-time configuration or\nbusiness logic should not be made `constexpr`. Such customization can not be\nevaluated by the compiler, and any `constexpr` functions that depended upon\nthat API would have to be refactored or drop `constexpr`.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nImpossible and unnecessary.\nThe compiler gives an error if a non-`constexpr` function is called where a constant is required.\n\n### <a name=\"Rf-inline\"></a>F.5: If a function is very small and time-critical, declare it `inline`\n\n##### Reason\n\nSome optimizers are good at inlining without hints from the programmer, but don't rely on it.\nMeasure! Over the last 40 years or so, we have been promised compilers that can inline better than humans without hints from humans.\nWe are still waiting.\nSpecifying inline (explicitly, or implicitly when writing member functions inside a class definition) encourages the compiler to do a better job.\n\n##### Example\n\n    inline string cat(const string& s, const string& s2) { return s + s2; }\n\n##### Exception\n\nDo not put an `inline` function in what is meant to be a stable interface unless you are certain that it will not change.\nAn inline function is part of the ABI.\n\n##### Note\n\n`constexpr` implies `inline`.\n\n##### Note\n\nMember functions defined in-class are `inline` by default.\n\n##### Exception\n\nFunction templates (including member functions of class templates `A<T>::function()` and member function templates `A::function<T>()`) are normally defined in headers and therefore inline.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nFlag `inline` functions that are more than three statements and could have been declared out of line (such as class member functions).\n\n### <a name=\"Rf-noexcept\"></a>F.6: If your function must not throw, declare it `noexcept`\n\n##### Reason\n\nIf an exception is not supposed to be thrown, the program cannot be assumed to cope with the error and should be terminated as soon as possible. Declaring a function `noexcept` helps optimizers by reducing the number of alternative execution paths. It also speeds up the exit after failure.\n\n##### Example\n\nPut `noexcept` on every function written completely in C or in any other language without exceptions.\nThe C++ Standard Library does that implicitly for all functions in the C Standard Library.\n\n##### Note\n\n`constexpr` functions can throw when evaluated at run time, so you might need conditional `noexcept` for some of those.\n\n##### Example\n\nYou can use `noexcept` even on functions that can throw:\n\n    vector<string> collect(istream& is) noexcept\n    {\n        vector<string> res;\n        for (string s; is >> s;)\n            res.push_back(s);\n        return res;\n    }\n\nIf `collect()` runs out of memory, the program crashes.\nUnless the program is crafted to survive memory exhaustion, that might be just the right thing to do;\n`terminate()` might generate suitable error log information (but after memory runs out it is hard to do anything clever).\n\n##### Note\n\nYou must be aware of the execution environment that your code is running when\ndeciding whether to tag a function `noexcept`, especially because of the issue\nof throwing and allocation.  Code that is intended to be perfectly general (like\nthe standard library and other utility code of that sort) needs to support\nenvironments where a `bad_alloc` exception could be handled meaningfully.\nHowever, most programs and execution environments cannot meaningfully\nhandle a failure to allocate, and aborting the program is the cleanest and\nsimplest response to an allocation failure in those cases.  If you know that\nyour application code cannot respond to an allocation failure, it could be\nappropriate to add `noexcept` even on functions that allocate.\n\nPut another way: In most programs, most functions can throw (e.g., because they\nuse `new`, call functions that do, or use library functions that reports failure\nby throwing), so don't just sprinkle `noexcept` all over the place without\nconsidering whether the possible exceptions can be handled.\n\n`noexcept` is most useful (and most clearly correct) for frequently used,\nlow-level functions.\n\n##### Note\n\nDestructors, `swap` functions, move operations, and default constructors should never throw.\nSee also [C.44](#Rc-default00).\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* Flag functions that are not `noexcept`, yet cannot throw.\n* Flag throwing `swap`, `move`, destructors, and default constructors.\n\n### <a name=\"Rf-smart\"></a>F.7: For general use, take `T*` or `T&` arguments rather than smart pointers\n\n##### Reason\n\nPassing a smart pointer transfers or shares ownership and should only be used when ownership semantics are intended.\nA function that does not manipulate lifetime should take raw pointers or references instead.\n\nPassing by smart pointer restricts the use of a function to callers that use smart pointers.\nA function that needs a `widget` should be able to accept any `widget` object, not just ones whose lifetimes are managed by a particular kind of smart pointer.\n\nPassing a shared smart pointer (e.g., `std::shared_ptr`) implies a run-time cost.\n\n##### Example\n\n    // accepts any int*\n    void f(int*);\n\n    // can only accept ints for which you want to transfer ownership\n    void g(unique_ptr<int>);\n\n    // can only accept ints for which you are willing to share ownership\n    void g(shared_ptr<int>);\n\n    // doesn't change ownership, but requires a particular ownership of the caller\n    void h(const unique_ptr<int>&);\n\n    // accepts any int\n    void h(int&);\n\n##### Example, bad\n\n    // callee\n    void f(shared_ptr<widget>& w)\n    {\n        // ...\n        use(*w); // only use of w -- the lifetime is not used at all\n        // ...\n    };\n\n    // caller\n    shared_ptr<widget> my_widget = /* ... */;\n    f(my_widget);\n\n    widget stack_widget;\n    f(stack_widget); // error\n\n##### Example, good\n\n    // callee\n    void f(widget& w)\n    {\n        // ...\n        use(w);\n        // ...\n    };\n\n    // caller\n    shared_ptr<widget> my_widget = /* ... */;\n    f(*my_widget);\n\n    widget stack_widget;\n    f(stack_widget); // ok -- now this works\n\n##### Note\n\nWe can catch many common cases of dangling pointers statically (see [lifetime safety profile](#SS-lifetime)). Function arguments naturally live for the lifetime of the function call, and so have fewer lifetime problems.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* (Simple) Warn if a function takes a parameter of a smart pointer type (that overloads `operator->` or `operator*`) that is copyable but the function only calls any of: `operator*`, `operator->` or `get()`.\n  Suggest using a `T*` or `T&` instead.\n* Flag a parameter of a smart pointer type (a type that overloads `operator->` or `operator*`) that is copyable/movable but never copied/moved from in the function body, and that is never modified, and that is not passed along to another function that could do so.

 // OK: pass by reference to const; always cheap\n\n    void f2(string s);         // bad: potentially expensive\n\n    void f3(int x);            // OK: Unbeatable\n\n    void f4(const int& x);     // bad: overhead on access in f4()\n\nFor advanced uses (only), where you really need to optimize for rvalues passed to \"input-only\" parameters:\n\n* If the function is going to unconditionally move from the argument, take it by `&&`. See [F.18](#Rf-consume).\n* If the function is going to keep a locally modifiable copy of the argument only for its own local use, taking it by value is fine\n* If the function is going to keep a copy of the argument to pass to another destination (to another function, or store in a non-local location), in addition to passing by `const&` (for lvalues),\n  add an overload that passes the parameter by `&&` (for rvalues) and in the body `std::move`s it to its destination. Essentially this overloads a \"will-move-from\"; see [F.18](#Rf-consume).\n* In special cases, such as multiple \"input + copy\" parameters, consider using perfect forwarding. See [F.19](#Rf-forward).\n\n##### Example\n\n    int multiply(int, int); // just input ints, pass by value\n\n    // suffix is input-only but not as cheap as an int, pass by const&\n    string& concatenate(string&, const string& suffix);\n\n    void sink(unique_ptr<widget>);  // input only, and moves ownership of the widget\n\nAvoid \"esoteric techniques\" such as passing arguments as `T&&` \"for efficiency\".\nMost rumors about performance advantages from passing by `&&` are false or brittle (but see [F.18](#Rf-consume) and [F.19](#Rf-forward)).\n\n##### Notes\n\nA reference can be assumed to refer to a valid object (language rule).\nThere is no (legitimate) \"null reference.\"\nIf you need the notion of an optional value, use a pointer, `std::optional`, or a special value used to denote \"no value.\"\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* (Simple) ((Foundation)) Warn when a parameter being passed by value has a size greater than `2 * sizeof(void*)`.\n  Suggest using a reference to `const` instead.\n* (Simple) ((Foundation)) Warn when a parameter passed by reference to `const` has a size less or equal than `2 * sizeof(void*)`.

Therefore any code that uses a `TP&&` is implicitly declaring that it itself doesn't care about the variable's `const`-ness and rvalue-ness (because it is ignored), but that intends to pass the value onward to other code that does care about `const`-ness and rvalue-ness (because it is preserved). When used as a parameter `TP&&` is safe because any temporary objects passed from the caller will live for the duration of the function call. A parameter of type `TP&&` should essentially always be passed onward via `std::forward` in the body of the function.\n\n##### Example\n\nUsually you forward the entire parameter (or parameter pack, using `...`) exactly once on every static control flow path:\n\n    template<class F, class... Args>\n    inline decltype(auto) invoke(F&& f, Args&&... args)\n    {\n        return forward<F>(f)(forward<Args>(args)...);\n    }\n\n##### Example\n\nSometimes you may forward a composite parameter piecewise, each subobject once on every static control flow path:\n\n    template<class PairLike>\n    inline auto test(PairLike&& pairlike)\n    {\n        // ...\n        f1(some, args, and, forward<PairLike>(pairlike).first);           // forward .first\n        f2(and, forward<PairLike>(pairlike).second, in, another, call);   // forward .second\n    }\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* Flag a function that takes a `TP&&` parameter (where `TP` is a template type parameter name) and does anything with it other than `std::forward`ing it exactly once on every static path, or `std::forward`ing it more than once but qualified with a different data member exactly once on every static path.\n\n### <a name=\"Rf-out\"></a>F.20: For \"out\" output values, prefer return values to output parameters\n\n##### Reason\n\nA return value is self-documenting, whereas a `&` could be either in-out or out-only and is liable to be misused.\n\nThis includes large objects like standard containers that use implicit move operations for performance and to avoid explicit memory management.\n\nIf you have multiple values to return, [use a tuple](#Rf-out-multi) or similar multi-member type.\n\n##### Example\n\n    // OK: return pointers to elements with the value x\n    vector<const int*> find_all(const vector<int>&, int x);\n\n    // Bad: place pointers to elements with value x in-out\n    void find_all(const vector<int>&, vector<const int*>& out, int x);\n\n##### Note\n\nA `struct` of many (individually cheap-to-move) elements might be in aggregate expensive to move.\n\n##### Exceptions\n\n* For non-concrete types, such as types in an inheritance hierarchy, return the object by `unique_ptr` or `shared_ptr`.\n* If a type is expensive to move (e.g., `array<BigTrivial>`), consider allocating it on the free store and return a handle (e.g., `unique_ptr`), or passing it in a reference to non-`const` target object to fill (to be used as an out-parameter).\n* To reuse an object that carries capacity (e.g., `std::string`, `std::vector`) across multiple calls to the function in an inner loop: [treat it as an in/out parameter and pass by reference](#Rf-out-multi).\n\n##### Example\n\nAssuming that `Matrix` has move operations (possibly by keeping its elements in a `std::vector`):\n\n    Matrix operator+(const Matrix& a, const Matrix& b)\n    {\n        Matrix res;\n        // ... fill res with the sum ...\n        return res;\n    }\n\n    Matrix x = m1 + m2;  // move constructor\n\n    y = m3 + m3;         // move assignment\n\n\n##### Note\n\nThe return value optimization doesn't handle the assignment case, but the move assignment does.\n\n##### Example\n\n    struct Package {      // exceptional case: expensive-to-move object\n        char header[16];\n        char load[2024 - 16];\n    };\n\n    Package fill();       // Bad: large return value\n    void fill(Package&);  // OK\n\n    int val();            // OK\n    void val(int&);       // Bad: Is val reading its argument\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* Flag reference to non-`const` parameters that are not read before being written to and are a type that could be cheaply returned; they should be \"out\" return values.\n\n### <a name=\"Rf-out-multi\"></a>F.21: To return multiple \"out\" values, prefer returning a struct\n\n##### Reason\n\nA return value is self-documenting as an \"output-only\" value.\nNote that C++ does have multiple return values, by convention of using tuple-like types (`struct`, `array`, `tuple`, etc.),\npossibly with the extra convenience of structured bindings (C++17) at the call site.\nPrefer using a named `struct` if possible.\nOtherwise, a `tuple` is useful in variadic templates.\n\n##### Example\n\n    // BAD: output-only parameter documented in a comment\n    int f(const string& input, /*output only*/ string& output_data)\n    {\n        // ...\n        output_data = something();\n        return status;\n    }\n\n    // GOOD: self-documenting\n    struct f_result { int status; string data; };\n\n    f_result f(const string& input)\n    {\n        // ...\n        return {status, something()};\n    }\n\nC++98's standard library used this style in places, by returning `pair` in some functions.\nFor example, given a `set<string> my_set`, consider:\n\n    // C++98\n    pair<set::iterator, bool> result = my_set.insert(\"Hello\");\n    if (result.second)\n        do_something_with(result.first);    // workaround\n\nWith C++17 we are able to use \"structured bindings\" to give each member a name:\n\n    if (auto [ iter, success ] = my_set.insert(\"Hello\"); success)\n        do_something_with(iter);\n\nA `struct` with meaningful names is more common in modern C++.\nSee for example `ranges::min_max_result`, `from_chars_result`, and others.\n\n##### Exception\n\nSometimes, we need to pass an object to a function to manipulate its state.\nIn such cases, passing the object by reference [`T&`](#Rf-inout) is usually the right technique.\nExplicitly passing an in-out parameter back out again as a return value is often not necessary.\nFor example:\n\n    istream& operator>>(istream& in, string& s);    // much like std::operator>>()\n\n    for (string s; in >> s; ) {\n        // do something with line\n    }\n\nHere, both `s` and `in` are used as in-out parameters.\nWe pass `in` by (non-`const`) reference to be able to manipulate its state.\nWe pass `s` to avoid repeated allocations.\nBy reusing `s` (passed by reference), we allocate new memory only when we need to expand `s`'s capacity.\nThis technique is sometimes called the \"caller-allocated out\" pattern and is particularly useful for types,\nsuch as `string` and `vector`, that needs to do free store allocations.\n\nTo compare, if we passed out all values as return values, we would write something like this:\n\n    struct get_string_result { istream& in; string s; };\n\n    get_string_result get_string(istream& in)  // not recommended\n    {\n        string s;\n        in >> s;\n        return { in, move(s) };\n    }\n\n    for (auto [in, s] = get_string(cin); in; s = get_string(in).s) {\n        // do something with string\n    }\n\nWe consider that significantly less elegant with significantly less performance.\n\nFor a truly strict reading of this rule (F.21), the exception isn't really an exception because it relies on in-out parameters,\nrather than the plain out parameters mentioned in the rule.\nHowever, we prefer to be explicit, rather than subtle.\n\n##### Note\n\nIn most cases, it is useful to return a specific, user-defined type.\nFor example:\n\n    struct Distance {\n        int value;\n        int unit = 1;   // 1 means meters\n    };\n\n    Distance d1 = measure(obj1);        // access d1.value and d1.unit\n    auto d2 = measure(obj2);            // access d2.value and d2.unit\n    auto [value, unit] = measure(obj3); // access value and unit; somewhat redundant\n                                        // to people who know measure()\n    auto [x, y] = measure(obj4);        // don't; it's likely to be confusing\n\nThe overly generic `pair` and `tuple` should be used only when the value returned represents independent entities rather than an abstraction.\n\nAnother option is to use `optional<T>` or `expected<T, error_code>`, rather than `pair` or `tuple`.\nWhen used appropriately these types convey more information about what the members mean than `pair<T, bool>` or `pair<T, error_code>` do.\n\n##### Note\n\nWhen the object to be returned is initialized from local variables that are expensive to copy,\nexplicit `move` may be helpful to avoid copying:\n\n    pair<LargeObject, LargeObject> f(const string& input)\n    {\n        LargeObject large1 = g(input);\n        LargeObject large2 = h(input);\n        // ...\n        return { move(large1), move(large2) };

A function with a `not_null<T>` parameter makes it clear that the caller of the function is responsible for any `nullptr` checks that might be necessary.\nSimilarly, a function with a return value of `not_null<T>` makes it clear that the caller of the function does not need to check for `nullptr`.\n\n##### Example\n\n`not_null<T*>` makes it obvious to a reader (human or machine) that a test for `nullptr` is not necessary before dereference.\nAdditionally, when debugging, `owner<T*>` and `not_null<T>` can be instrumented to check for correctness.\n\nConsider:\n\n    int length(Record* p);\n\nWhen I call `length(p)` should I check if `p` is `nullptr` first? Should the implementation of `length()` check if `p` is `nullptr`?\n\n    // it is the caller's job to make sure p != nullptr\n    int length(not_null<Record*> p);\n\n    // the implementor of length() must assume that p == nullptr is possible\n    int length(Record* p);\n\n##### Note\n\nA `not_null<T*>` is assumed not to be the `nullptr`; a `T*` might be the `nullptr`; both can be represented in memory as a `T*` (so no run-time overhead is implied).\n\n##### Note\n\n`not_null` is not just for built-in pointers. It works for `unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`, and other pointer-like types.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* (Simple) Warn if a raw pointer is dereferenced without being tested against `nullptr` (or equivalent) within a function, suggest it is declared `not_null` instead.\n* (Simple) Error if a raw pointer is sometimes dereferenced after first being tested against `nullptr` (or equivalent) within the function and sometimes is not.\n* (Simple) Warn if a `not_null` pointer is tested against `nullptr` within a function.\n\n### <a name=\"Rf-range\"></a>F.24: Use a `span<T>` or a `span_p<T>` to designate a half-open sequence\n\n##### Reason\n\nInformal/non-explicit ranges are a source of errors.\n\n##### Example\n\n    X* find(span<X> r, const X& v);    // find v in r\n\n    vector<X> vec;\n    // ...\n    auto p = find({vec.begin(), vec.end()}, X{});  // find X{} in vec\n\n##### Note\n\nRanges are extremely common in C++ code. Typically, they are implicit and their correct use is very hard to ensure.\nIn particular, given a pair of arguments `(p, n)` designating an array `[p:p+n)`,\nit is in general impossible to know if there really are `n` elements to access following `*p`.\n`span<T>` and `span_p<T>` are simple helper classes designating a `[p:q)` range and a range starting with `p` and ending with the first element for which a predicate is true, respectively.\n\n##### Example\n\nA `span` represents a range of elements, but how do we manipulate elements of that range?\n\n    void f(span<int> s)\n    {\n        // range traversal (guaranteed correct)\n        for (int x : s) cout << x << '\\n';\n\n        // C-style traversal (potentially checked)\n        for (gsl::index i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) cout << s[i] << '\\n';\n\n        // random access (potentially checked)\n        s[7] = 9;\n\n        // extract pointers (potentially checked)\n        std::sort(&s[0], &s[s.size() / 2]);\n    }\n\n##### Note\n\nA `span<T>` object does not own its elements and is so small that it can be passed by value.\n\nPassing a `span` object as an argument is exactly as efficient as passing a pair of pointer arguments or passing a pointer and an integer count.\n\n**See also**: [Support library](#gsl-guidelines-support-library)\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n(Complex) Warn where accesses to pointer parameters are bounded by other parameters that are integral types and suggest they could use `span` instead.\n\n### <a name=\"Rf-zstring\"></a>F.25: Use a `zstring` or a `not_null<zstring>` to designate a C-style string\n\n##### Reason\n\nC-style strings are ubiquitous. They are defined by convention: zero-terminated arrays of characters.\nWe must distinguish C-style strings from a pointer to a single character or an old-fashioned pointer to an array of characters.\n\nIf you don't need null termination, use `string_view`.\n\n##### Example\n\nConsider:\n\n    int length(const char* p);\n\nWhen I call `length(s)` should I check if `s` is `nullptr` first? Should the implementation of `length()` check if `p` is `nullptr`?\n\n    // the implementor of length() must assume that p == nullptr is possible\n    int length(zstring p);\n\n    // it is the caller's job to make sure p != nullptr\n    int length(not_null<zstring> p);\n\n##### Note\n\n`zstring` does not represent ownership.\n\n**See also**: [Support library](#gsl-guidelines-support-library)\n\n### <a name=\"Rf-unique_ptr\"></a>F.26: Use a `unique_ptr<T>` to transfer ownership where a pointer is needed\n\n##### Reason\n\nUsing `unique_ptr` is the cheapest way to pass a pointer safely.\n\n**See also**: [C.50](#Rc-factory) regarding when to return a `shared_ptr` from a factory.\n\n##### Example\n\n    unique_ptr<Shape> get_shape(istream& is)  // assemble shape from input stream\n    {\n        auto kind = read_header(is); // read header and identify the next shape on input\n        switch (kind) {\n        case kCircle:\n            return make_unique<Circle>(is);\n        case kTriangle:\n            return make_unique<Triangle>(is);\n        // ...\n        }\n    }\n\n##### Note\n\nYou need to pass a pointer rather than an object if what you are transferring is an object from a class hierarchy that is to be used through an interface (base class).\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n(Simple) Warn if a function returns a locally allocated raw pointer.

 // BAD\n    }\n\n    void g(int* p)   // looks innocent enough\n    {\n        int gx;\n        cout << \"*p == \" << *p << '\\n';\n        *p = 999;\n        cout << \"gx == \" << gx << '\\n';\n    }\n\n    void h()\n    {\n        int* p = f();\n        int z = *p;  // read from abandoned stack frame (bad)\n        g(p);        // pass pointer to abandoned stack frame to function (bad)\n    }\n\nHere on one popular implementation I got the output:\n\n    *p == 999\n    gx == 999\n\nI expected that because the call of `g()` reuses the stack space abandoned by the call of `f()` so `*p` refers to the space now occupied by `gx`.\n\n* Imagine what would happen if `fx` and `gx` were of different types.\n* Imagine what would happen if `fx` or `gx` was a type with an invariant.\n* Imagine what would happen if more that dangling pointer was passed around among a larger set of functions.\n* Imagine what a cracker could do with that dangling pointer.\n\nFortunately, most (all?) modern compilers catch and warn against this simple case.\n\n##### Note\n\nThis applies to references as well:\n\n    int& f()\n    {\n        int x = 7;\n        // ...\n        return x;  // Bad: returns reference to object that is about to be destroyed\n    }\n\n##### Note\n\nThis applies only to non-`static` local variables.\nAll `static` variables are (as their name indicates) statically allocated, so that pointers to them cannot dangle.\n\n##### Example, bad\n\nNot all examples of leaking a pointer to a local variable are that obvious:\n\n    int* glob;       // global variables are bad in so many ways\n\n    template<class T>\n    void steal(T x)\n    {\n        glob = x();  // BAD\n    }\n\n    void f()\n    {\n        int i = 99;\n        steal([&] { return &i;

  // OK, so far\n    foo(x);                 // Undefined behavior\n\nThis kind of use is a frequent source of bugs, often incorrectly reported as a compiler bug.\nAn implementer of a function should avoid setting such traps for users.\n\nThe [lifetime safety profile](#SS-lifetime) will (when completely implemented) catch such problems.\n\n\n##### Example\n\nReturning an rvalue reference is fine when the reference to the temporary is being passed \"downward\" to a callee;\nthen, the temporary is guaranteed to outlive the function call (see [F.18](#Rf-consume) and [F.19](#Rf-forward)).\nHowever, it's not fine when passing such a reference \"upward\" to a larger caller scope.\nFor passthrough functions that pass in parameters (by ordinary reference or by perfect forwarding) and want to return values, use simple `auto` return type deduction (not `auto&&`).\n\nAssume that `F` returns by value:\n\n    template<class F>\n    auto&& wrapper(F f)\n    {\n        log_call(typeid(f));

We don't know of any other good examples of returning `&&`.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nFlag any use of `&&` as a return type, except in `std::move` and `std::forward`.\n\n### <a name=\"Rf-main\"></a>F.46: `int` is the return type for `main()`\n\n##### Reason\n\nIt's a language rule, but violated through \"language extensions\" so often that it is worth mentioning.\nDeclaring `main` (the one global `main` of a program) `void` limits portability.\n\n##### Example\n\n        void main() { /* ... */ };  // bad, not C++\n\n        int main()\n        {\n            std::cout << \"This is the way to do it\\n\";\n        }\n\n##### Note\n\nWe mention this only because of the persistence of this error in the community.\nNote that despite its non-void return type, the main function does not require an explicit return statement.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* The compiler should do it\n* If the compiler doesn't do it, let tools flag it\n\n### <a name=\"Rf-assignment-op\"></a>F.47: Return `T&` from assignment operators\n\n##### Reason\n\nThe convention for operator overloads (especially on concrete types) is for\n`operator=(const T&)` to perform the assignment and then return (non-`const`)\n`*this`.  This ensures consistency with standard-library types and follows the\nprinciple of \"do as the ints do.\"\n\n##### Note\n\nHistorically there was some guidance to make the assignment operator return `const T&`.\nThis was primarily to avoid code of the form `(a = b) = c` -- such code is not common enough to warrant violating consistency with standard types.\n\n##### Example\n\n    class Foo\n    {\n     public:\n        ...\n        Foo& operator=(const Foo& rhs)\n        {\n          // Copy members.\n          ...\n          return *this;\n        }\n    };\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nThis should be enforced by tooling by checking the return type (and return\nvalue) of any assignment operator.\n\n### <a name=\"Rf-return-move-local\"></a>F.48: Don't `return std::move(local)`\n\n##### Reason\n\nReturning a local variable implicitly moves it anyway.\nAn explicit `std::move` is always a pessimization, because it prevents Return Value Optimization (RVO),\nwhich can eliminate the move completely.\n\n##### Example, bad\n\n    S bad()\n    {\n      S result;\n      return std::move(result);\n    }\n\n##### Example, good\n\n    S good()\n    {\n      S result;\n      // Named RVO: move elision at best, move construction at worst\n      return result;\n    }\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nThis should be enforced by tooling by checking the return expression .\n\n### <a name=\"Rf-return-const\"></a>F.49: Don't return `const T`\n\n##### Reason\n\nIt is not recommended to return a `const` value.\nSuch older advice is now obsolete; it does not add value, and it interferes with move semantics.\n\n##### Example\n\n    const vector<int> fct();    // bad: that \"const\" is more trouble than it is worth\n\n    void g(vector<int>& vx)\n    {\n        // ...\n        fct() = vx;   // prevented by the \"const\"\n        // ...\n        vx = fct(); // expensive copy: move semantics suppressed by the \"const\"\n        // ...\n    }\n\nThe argument for adding `const` to a return value is that it prevents (very rare) accidental access to a temporary.\nThe argument against is that it prevents (very frequent) use of move semantics.\n\n**See also**: [F.20, the general item about \"out\" output values](#Rf-out)\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* Flag returning a `const` value. To fix: Remove `const` to return a non-`const` value instead.\n\n\n### <a name=\"Rf-capture-vs-overload\"></a>F.50: Use a lambda when a function won't do (to capture local variables, or to write a local function)\n\n##### Reason\n\nFunctions can't capture local variables or be defined at local scope; if you need those things, prefer a lambda where possible, and a handwritten function object where not. On the other hand, lambdas and function objects don't overload; if you need to overload, prefer a function (the workarounds to make lambdas overload are ornate). If either will work, prefer writing a function; use the simplest tool necessary.\n\n##### Example\n\n    // writing a function that should only take an int or a string\n    // -- overloading is natural\n    void f(int);\n    void f(const string&);\n\n    // writing a function object that needs to capture local state and appear\n    // at statement or expression scope -- a lambda is natural\n    vector<work> v = lots_of_work();\n    for (int tasknum = 0; tasknum < max; ++tasknum) {\n        pool.run([=, &v] {\n            /*\n            ...\n            ... process 1 / max - th of v, the tasknum - th chunk\n            ...\n            */\n        });\n    }\n    pool.join();\n\n##### Exception\n\nGeneric lambdas offer a concise way to write function templates and so can be useful even when a normal function template would do equally well with a little more syntax. This advantage will probably disappear in the future once all functions gain the ability to have Concept parameters.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* Warn on use of a named non-generic lambda (e.g., `auto x = [](int i) { /*...*/; };`) that captures nothing and appears at global scope. Write an ordinary function instead.\n\n### <a name=\"Rf-default-args\"></a>F.51: Where there is a choice, prefer default arguments over overloading\n\n##### Reason\n\nDefault arguments simply provide alternative interfaces to a single implementation.\nThere is no guarantee that a set of overloaded functions all implement the same semantics.\nThe use of default arguments can avoid code replication.\n\n##### Note\n\nThere is a choice between using default argument and overloading when the alternatives are from a set of arguments of the same types.\nFor example:\n\n    void print(const string& s, format f = {});\n\nas opposed to\n\n    void print(const string& s);  // use default format\n    void print(const string& s, format f);\n\nThere is not a choice when a set of functions are used to do a semantically equivalent operation to a set of types. For example:\n\n    void print(const char&);\n    void print(int);\n    void print(zstring);\n\n##### See also\n\n\n[Default arguments for virtual functions](#Rh-virtual-default-arg)\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* Warn on an overload set where the overloads have a common prefix of parameters (e.g., `f(int)`, `f(int, const string&)`, `f(int, const string&, double)`). (Note: Review this enforcement if it's too noisy in practice.)\n\n### <a name=\"Rf-reference-capture\"></a>F.52: Prefer capturing by reference in lambdas that will be used locally, including passed to algorithms\n\n##### Reason\n\nFor efficiency and correctness, you nearly always want to capture by reference when using the lambda locally. This includes when writing or calling parallel algorithms that are local because they join before returning.\n\n##### Discussion\n\nThe efficiency consideration is that most types are cheaper to pass by reference than by value.\n\nThe correctness consideration is that many calls want to perform side effects on the original object at the call site (see example below). Passing by value prevents this.\n\n##### Note\n\nUnfortunately, there is no simple way to capture by reference to `const` to get the efficiency for a local call but also prevent side effects.\n\n##### Example\n\nHere, a large object (a network message) is passed to an iterative algorithm, and it is not efficient or correct to copy the message (which might not be copyable):\n\n    std::for_each(begin(sockets), end(sockets), [&message](auto& socket)\n    {\n        socket.send(message);\n    });\n\n##### Example\n\nThis is a simple three-stage parallel pipeline. Each `stage` object encapsulates a worker thread and a queue, has a `process` function to enqueue work, and in its destructor automatically blocks waiting for the queue to empty before ending the thread.\n\n    void send_packets(buffers& bufs)\n    {\n        stage encryptor([](buffer& b) { encrypt(b); });\n        stage compressor([&](buffer& b) { compress(b); encryptor.process(b); });\n        stage decorator([&](buffer& b) { decorate(b); compressor.process(b); });\n        for (auto& b : bufs) { decorator.process(b); }\n    }  // automatically blocks waiting for pipeline to finish\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nFlag a lambda that captures by reference, but is used other than locally within the function scope or passed to a function by reference. (Note: This rule is an approximation, but does flag passing by pointer as those are more likely to be stored by the callee, writing to a heap location accessed via a parameter, returning the lambda, etc. The Lifetime rules will also provide general rules that flag escaping pointers and references including via lambdas.)\n\n### <a name=\"Rf-value-capture\"></a>F.53: Avoid capturing by reference in lambdas that will be used non-locally, including returned, stored on the heap, or passed to another thread\n\n##### Reason\n\nPointers and references to locals shouldn't outlive their scope. Lambdas that capture by reference are just another place to store a reference to a local object, and shouldn't do so if they (or a copy) outlive the scope.\n\n##### Example, bad\n\n    int local = 42;\n\n    // Want a reference to local.\n    // Note, that after program exits this scope,\n    // local no longer exists, therefore\n    // process() call will have undefined behavior!\n    thread_pool.queue_work([&] { process(local); });\n\n##### Example, good\n\n    int local = 42;\n    // Want a copy of local.\n    // Since a copy of local is made, it will\n    // always be available for the call.\n    thread_pool.queue_work([=] { process(local); });\n\n##### Note\n\nIf a non-local pointer must be captured, consider using `unique_ptr`; this handles both lifetime and synchronization.\n\nIf the `this` pointer must be captured, consider using `[*this]` capture, which creates a copy of the entire object.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* (Simple) Warn when capture-list contains a reference to a locally declared variable\n* (Complex) Flag when capture-list contains a reference to a locally declared variable and the lambda is passed to a non-`const` and non-local context\n\n### <a name=\"Rf-this-capture\"></a>F.54: When writing a lambda that captures `this` or any class data member, don't use `[=]` default capture\n\n##### Reason\n\nIt's confusing. Writing `[=]` in a member function appears to capture by value, but actually captures data members by reference because it actually captures the invisible `this` pointer by value. If you meant to do that, write `this` explicitly.\n\n##### Example\n\n    class My_class {\n        int x = 0;\n        // ...\n\n        void f()\n        {\n            int i = 0;\n            // ...\n\n            auto lambda = [=] { use(i, x); };   // BAD: \"looks like\" copy/value capture\n\n            x = 42;\n            lambda(); // calls use(0, 42);\n            x = 43;\n            lambda(); // calls use(0, 43);\n\n            // ...\n\n            auto lambda2 = [i, this] { use(i, x); }; // ok, most explicit and least confusing\n\n            // ...\n        }\n    };\n\n##### Note\n\nIf you intend to capture a copy of all class data members, consider C++17 `[*this]`.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* Flag any lambda capture-list that specifies a capture-default of `[=]` and also captures `this` (whether explicitly or via the default capture and a use of `this` in the body)\n\n### <a name=\"F-varargs\"></a>F.55: Don't use `va_arg` arguments\n\n##### Reason\n\nReading from a `va_arg` assumes that the correct type was actually passed.\nPassing to varargs assumes the correct type will be read.\nThis is fragile because it cannot generally be enforced to be safe in the language and so relies on programmer discipline to get it right.\n\n##### Example\n\n    int sum(...)\n    {\n        // ...\n        while (/*...*/)\n            result += va_arg(list, int); // BAD, assumes it will be passed ints\n        // ...\n    }\n\n    sum(3, 2); // ok\n    sum(3.14159, 2.71828); // BAD, undefined\n\n    template<class ...Args>\n    auto sum(Args... args) // GOOD, and much more flexible\n    {\n        return (... + args); // note: C++17 \"fold expression\"\n    }\n\n    sum(3, 2); // ok: 5\n    sum(3.14159, 2.71828); // ok: ~5.85987\n\n##### Alternatives\n\n* overloading\n* variadic templates\n* `variant` arguments\n* `initializer_list` (homogeneous)\n\n##### Note\n\nDeclaring a `...` parameter is sometimes useful for techniques that don't involve actual argument passing, notably to declare \"take-anything\" functions so as to disable \"everything else\" in an overload set or express a catchall case in a template metaprogram.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* Issue a diagnostic for using `va_list`, `va_start`, or `va_arg`.\n* Issue a diagnostic for passing an argument to a vararg parameter of a function that does not offer an overload for a more specific type in the position of the vararg.

   // day\n    };\n\n##### Note\n\nIf a class has any `private` data, a user cannot completely initialize an object without the use of a constructor.\nHence, the class definer will provide a constructor and must specify its meaning.\nThis effectively means the definer need to define an invariant.\n\n**See also**:\n\n* [define a class with private data as `class`](#Rc-class)\n* [Prefer to place the interface first in a class](#Rl-order)\n* [minimize exposure of members](#Rc-private)\n* [Avoid `protected` data](#Rh-protected)\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nLook for `struct`s with all data private and `class`es with public members.\n\n### <a name=\"Rc-interface\"></a>C.3: Represent the distinction between an interface and an implementation using a class\n\n##### Reason\n\nAn explicit distinction between interface and implementation improves readability and simplifies maintenance.\n\n##### Example\n\n    class Date {\n    public:\n        Date();\n        // validate that {yy, mm, dd} is a valid date and initialize\n        Date(int yy, Month mm, char dd);\n\n        int day() const;\n        Month month() const;\n        // ...\n    private:\n        // ... some representation ...\n    };\n\nFor example, we can now change the representation of a `Date` without affecting its users (recompilation is likely, though).\n\n##### Note\n\nUsing a class in this way to represent the distinction between interface and implementation is of course not the only way.\nFor example, we can use a set of declarations of freestanding functions in a namespace, an abstract base class, or a function template with concepts to represent an interface.\nThe most important issue is to explicitly distinguish between an interface and its implementation \"details.\"\nIdeally, and typically, an interface is far more stable than its implementation(s).\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n???\n\n### <a name=\"Rc-member\"></a>C.4: Make a function a member only if it needs direct access to the representation of a class\n\n##### Reason\n\nLess coupling than with member functions, fewer functions that can cause trouble by modifying object state, reduces the number of functions that needs to be modified after a change in representation.\n\n##### Example\n\n    class Date {\n        // ... relatively small interface ...\n    };\n\n    // helper functions:\n    Date next_weekday(Date);\n    bool operator==(Date, Date);\n\nThe \"helper functions\" have no need for direct access to the representation of a `Date`.\n\n##### Note\n\nThis rule becomes even better if C++ gets [\"uniform function call\"](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0251r0.pdf).\n\n##### Exception\n\nThe language requires `virtual` functions to be members, and not all `virtual` functions directly access data.\nIn particular, members of an abstract class rarely do.\n\nNote [multi-methods](https://web.archive.org/web/20200605021759/https://parasol.tamu.edu/~yuriys/papers/OMM10.pdf).\n\n##### Exception\n\nThe language requires operators `=`, `()`, `[]`, and `->` to be members.\n\n##### Exception\n\nAn overload set could have some members that do not directly access `private` data:\n\n    class Foobar {\n    public:\n        void foo(long x) { /* manipulate private data */ }\n        void foo(double x) { foo(std::lround(x));

 // year\n    };\n\nThere is nothing wrong with this code as far as the C++ language rules are concerned,\nbut nearly everything is wrong from a design perspective.\nThe private data is hidden far from the public data.\nThe data is split in different parts of the class declaration.\nDifferent parts of the data have different access.\nAll of this decreases readability and complicates maintenance.\n\n##### Note\n\nPrefer to place the interface first in a class, [see NL.16](#Rl-order).\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nFlag classes declared with `struct` if there is a `private` or `protected` member.\n\n### <a name=\"Rc-private\"></a>C.9: Minimize exposure of members\n\n##### Reason\n\nEncapsulation.\nInformation hiding.\nMinimize the chance of unintended access.\nThis simplifies maintenance.\n\n##### Example\n\n    template<typename T, typename U>\n    struct pair {\n        T a;\n        U b;\n        // ...\n    };\n\nWhatever we do in the `//`-part, an arbitrary user of a `pair` can arbitrarily and independently change its `a` and `b`.\nIn a large code base, we cannot easily find which code does what to the members of `pair`.\nThis might be exactly what we want, but if we want to enforce a relation among members, we need to make them `private`\nand enforce that relation (invariant) through constructors and member functions.\nFor example:\n\n    class Distance {\n    public:\n        // ...\n        double meters() const { return magnitude*unit; }\n        void set_unit(double u)\n        {\n                // ... check that u is a factor of 10 ...\n                // ... change magnitude appropriately ...\n                unit = u;\n        }\n        // ...\n    private:\n        double magnitude;\n        double unit;    // 1 is meters, 1000 is kilometers, 0.001 is millimeters, etc.\n    };\n\n##### Note\n\nIf the set of direct users of a set of variables cannot be easily determined, the type or usage of that set cannot be (easily) changed/improved.\nFor `public` and `protected` data, that's usually the case.\n\n##### Example\n\nA class can provide two interfaces to its users.\nOne for derived classes (`protected`) and one for general users (`public`).\nFor example, a derived class might be allowed to skip a run-time check because it has already guaranteed correctness:\n\n    class Foo {\n    public:\n        int bar(int x) { check(x); return do_bar(x); }\n        // ...\n    protected:\n        int do_bar(int x); // do some operation on the data\n        // ...\n    private:\n        // ... data ...\n    };\n\n    class Dir : public Foo {\n        //...\n        int mem(int x, int y)\n        {\n            /* ... do something ... */\n            return do_bar(x + y); // OK: derived class can bypass check\n        }\n    };\n\n    void user(Foo& x)\n    {\n        int r1 = x.bar(1);      // OK, will check\n        int r2 = x.do_bar(2);   // error: would bypass check\n        // ...\n    }\n\n##### Note\n\n[`protected` data is a bad idea](#Rh-protected).\n\n##### Note\n\nPrefer the order `public` members before `protected` members before `private` members;

Concrete classes without assignment and equality can be defined, but they are (and should be) rare.\n\n##### Example\n\n    struct Bundle {\n        string name;\n        vector<Record> vr;\n    };\n\n    bool operator==(const Bundle& a, const Bundle& b)\n    {\n        return a.name == b.name && a.vr == b.vr;\n    }\n\n    Bundle b1 { \"my bundle\", {r1, r2, r3}};\n    Bundle b2 = b1;\n    if (!(b1 == b2)) error(\"impossible!\");\n    b2.name = \"the other bundle\";\n    if (b1 == b2) error(\"No!\");\n\nIn particular, if a concrete type is copyable, prefer to also give it an equality comparison operator, and ensure that `a = b` implies `a == b`.\n\n##### Note\n\nFor structs intended to be shared with C code, defining `operator==` may not be feasible.\n\n##### Note\n\nHandles for resources that cannot be cloned, e.g., a `scoped_lock` for a `mutex`, are concrete types but typically cannot be copied (instead, they can usually be moved),\nso they can't be regular; instead, they tend to be move-only.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n???\n\n\n### <a name=\"Rc-constref\"></a>C.12: Don't make data members `const` or references in a copyable or movable type\n\n##### Reason\n\n`const` and reference data members are not useful in a copyable or movable type, and make such types difficult to use by making them at least partly uncopyable/unmovable for subtle reasons.\n\n##### Example;

 // at least one abstract method to make the class abstract\n        virtual ~AbstractBase() = default;\n        // ...\n    };\n\nTo prevent slicing as per [C.67](#Rc-copy-virtual),\nmake the copy and move operations protected or `=delete`d, and add a `clone`:\n\n    class CloneableBase {\n    public:\n        virtual unique_ptr<CloneableBase> clone() const;\n        virtual ~CloneableBase() = default;\n        CloneableBase() = default;\n        CloneableBase(const CloneableBase&) = delete;\n        CloneableBase& operator=(const CloneableBase&) = delete;\n        CloneableBase(CloneableBase&&) = delete;\n        CloneableBase& operator=(CloneableBase&&) = delete;\n        // ... other constructors and functions ...\n    };\n\nDefining only the move operations or only the copy operations would have the\nsame effect here, but stating the intent explicitly for each special member\nmakes it more obvious to the reader.\n\n##### Note\n\nCompilers enforce much of this rule and ideally warn about any violation.\n\n##### Note\n\nRelying on an implicitly generated copy operation in a class with a destructor is deprecated.\n\n##### Note\n\nWriting these functions can be error-prone.\nNote their argument types:\n\n    class X {\n    public:\n        // ...\n        virtual ~X() = default;               // destructor (virtual if X is meant to be a base class)\n        X(const X&) = default;                // copy constructor\n        X& operator=(const X&) = default;     // copy assignment\n        X(X&&) noexcept = default;            // move constructor\n        X& operator=(X&&) noexcept = default; // move assignment\n    };\n\nA minor mistake (such as a misspelling, leaving out a `const`, using `&` instead of `&&`, or leaving out a special function) can lead to errors or warnings.\nTo avoid the tedium and the possibility of errors, try to follow the [rule of zero](#Rc-zero).\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n(Simple) A class should have a declaration (even a `=delete` one) for either all or none of the copy/move/destructor functions.\n\n### <a name=\"Rc-matched\"></a>C.22: Make default operations consistent\n\n##### Reason\n\nThe default operations are conceptually a matched set. Their semantics are interrelated.\nUsers will be surprised if copy/move construction and copy/move assignment do logically different things. Users will be surprised if constructors and destructors do not provide a consistent view of resource management. Users will be surprised if copy and move don't reflect the way constructors and destructors work.\n\n##### Example, bad\n\n    class Silly {   // BAD: Inconsistent copy operations\n        class Impl {\n            // ...\n        };\n        shared_ptr<Impl> p;\n    public:\n        Silly(const Silly& a) : p(make_shared<Impl>()) { *p = *a.p; }   // deep copy\n        Silly& operator=(const Silly& a) { p = a.p; return *this; }   // shallow copy\n        // ...\n    };\n\nThese operations disagree about copy semantics. This will lead to confusion and bugs.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* (Complex) A copy/move constructor and the corresponding copy/move assignment operator should write to the same data members at the same level of dereference.\n* (Complex) Any data members written in a copy/move constructor should also be initialized by all other constructors.\n* (Complex) If a copy/move constructor performs a deep copy of a data member, then the destructor should modify the data member.\n* (Complex) If a destructor is modifying a data member, that data member should be written in any copy/move constructors or assignment operators.\n\n## <a name=\"SS-dtor\"></a>C.dtor: Destructors\n\n\"Does this class need a destructor?\" is a surprisingly insightful design question.\nFor most classes the answer is \"no\" either because the class holds no resources or because destruction is handled by [the rule of zero](#Rc-zero);\nthat is, its members can take care of themselves as concerns destruction.\nIf the answer is \"yes\", much of the design of the class follows (see [the rule of five](#Rc-five)).\n\n### <a name=\"Rc-dtor\"></a>C.30: Define a destructor if a class needs an explicit action at object destruction\n\n##### Reason\n\nA destructor is implicitly invoked at the end of an object's lifetime.\nIf the default destructor is sufficient, use it.\nOnly define a non-default destructor if a class needs to execute code that is not already part of its members' destructors.\n\n##### Example\n\n    template<typename A>\n    struct final_action {   // slightly simplified\n        A act;\n        final_action(A a) : act{a} {}\n        ~final_action() { act(); }\n    };\n\n    template<typename A>\n    final_action<A> finally(A act)   // deduce action type\n    {\n        return final_action<A>{act};\n    }\n\n    void test()\n    {\n        auto act = finally([] { cout << \"Exit test\\n\"; });  // establish exit action\n        // ...\n        if (something) return;   // act done here\n        // ...\n    } // act done here\n\nThe whole purpose of `final_action` is to get a piece of code (usually a lambda) executed upon destruction.\n\n##### Note\n\nThere are two general categories of classes that need a user-defined destructor:\n\n* A class with a resource that is not already represented as a class with a destructor, e.g., a `vector` or a transaction class.\n* A class that exists primarily to execute an action upon destruction, such as a tracer or `final_action`.\n\n##### Example, bad\n\n    class Foo {   // bad; use the default destructor\n    public:\n        // ...\n        ~Foo() { s = \"\"; i = 0; vi.clear(); }  // clean up\n    private:\n        string s;\n        int i;\n        vector<int> vi;\n    };\n\nThe default destructor does it better, more efficiently, and can't get it wrong.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nLook for likely \"implicit resources\", such as pointers and references. Look for classes with destructors even though all their data members have destructors.\n\n### <a name=\"Rc-dtor-release\"></a>C.31: All resources acquired by a class must be released by the class's destructor\n\n##### Reason\n\nPrevention of resource leaks, especially in error cases.\n\n##### Note\n\nFor resources represented as classes with a complete set of default operations, this happens automatically.\n\n##### Example\n\n    class X {\n        ifstream f;   // might own a file\n        // ... no default operations defined or =deleted ...\n    };\n\n`X`'s `ifstream` implicitly closes any file it might have open upon destruction of its `X`.\n\n##### Example, bad\n\n    class X2 {     // bad\n        FILE* f;   // might own a file\n        // ... no default operations defined or =deleted ...\n    };\n\n`X2` might leak a file handle.\n\n##### Note\n\nWhat about a socket that won't close? A destructor, close, or cleanup operation [should never fail](#Rc-dtor-fail).\nIf it does nevertheless, we have a problem that has no really good solution.\nFor starters, the writer of a destructor does not know why the destructor is called and cannot \"refuse to act\" by throwing an exception.\nSee [discussion](#Sd-never-fail).\nTo make the problem worse, many \"close/release\" operations are not retryable.\nMany have tried to solve this problem, but no general solution is known.\nIf at all possible, consider failure to close/cleanup a fundamental design error and terminate.\n\n##### Note\n\nA class can hold pointers and references to objects that it does not own.\nObviously, such objects should not be `delete`d by the class's destructor.\nFor example:\n\n    Preprocessor pp { /* ... */ };\n    Parser p { pp, /* ... */ };\n    Type_checker tc { p, /* ... */ };\n\nHere `p` refers to `pp` but does not own it.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* (Simple) If a class has pointer or reference members that are owners\n  (e.g., deemed owners by using `gsl::owner`), then they should be referenced in its destructor.\n* (Hard) Determine if pointer or reference members are owners when there is no explicit statement of ownership\n  (e.g., look into the constructors).\n\n### <a name=\"Rc-dtor-ptr\"></a>C.32: If a class has a raw pointer (`T*`) or reference (`T&`), consider whether it might be owning\n\n##### Reason\n\nThere is a lot of code that is non-specific about ownership.\n\n##### Example\n\n    class legacy_class\n    {\n        foo* m_owning;   // Bad: change to unique_ptr<T> or owner<T*>\n        bar* m_observer; // OK: keep\n    }\n\nThe only way to determine ownership may be code analysis.\n\n##### Note\n\nOwnership should be clear in new code (and refactored legacy code) according to [R.20](#Rr-owner) for owning\npointers and [R.3](#Rr-ptr) for non-owning pointers.  References should never own [R.4](#Rr-ref).\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nLook at the initialization of raw member pointers and member references and see if an allocation is used.\n\n### <a name=\"Rc-dtor-ptr2\"></a>C.33: If a class has an owning pointer member, define a destructor\n\n##### Reason\n\nAn owned object must be `deleted` upon destruction of the object that owns it.\n\n##### Example\n\nA pointer member could represent a resource.\n[A `T*` should not do so](#Rr-ptr), but in older code, that's common.\nConsider a `T*` a possible owner and therefore suspect.\n\n    template<typename T>\n    class Smart_ptr {\n        T* p;   // BAD: vague about ownership of *p\n        // ...\n    public:\n        // ... no user-defined default operations ...\n    };\n\n    void use(Smart_ptr<int> p1)\n    {\n        // error: p2.p leaked (if not nullptr and not owned by some other code)\n        auto p2 = p1;\n    }\n\nNote that if you define a destructor, you must define or delete [all default operations](#Rc-five):\n\n    template<typename T>\n    class Smart_ptr2 {\n        T* p;   // BAD: vague about ownership of *p\n        // ...\n    public:\n        // ... no user-defined copy operations ...\n        ~Smart_ptr2() { delete p; }  // p is an owner!\n    };\n\n    void use(Smart_ptr2<int> p1)\n    {\n        auto p2 = p1;   // error: double deletion\n    }\n\nThe default copy operation will just copy the `p1.p` into `p2.p` leading to a double destruction of `p1.p`. Be explicit about ownership:\n\n    template<typename T>\n    class Smart_ptr3 {\n        owner<T*> p;   // OK: explicit about ownership of *p\n        // ...\n    public:\n        // ...\n        // ... copy and move operations ...\n        ~Smart_ptr3() { delete p; }\n    };\n\n    void use(Smart_ptr3<int> p1)\n    {\n        auto p2 = p1;   // OK: no double deletion\n    }\n\n##### Note\n\nOften the simplest way to get a destructor is to replace the pointer with a smart pointer (e.g., `std::unique_ptr`) and let the compiler arrange for proper destruction to be done implicitly.\n\n##### Note\n\nWhy not just require all owning pointers to be \"smart pointers\"?\nThat would sometimes require non-trivial code changes and might affect ABIs.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* A class with a pointer data member is suspect.\n* A class with an `owner<T>` should define its default operations.\n\n\n### <a name=\"Rc-dtor-virtual\"></a>C.35: A base class destructor should be either public and virtual, or protected and non-virtual\n\n##### Reason\n\nTo prevent undefined behavior.\nIf the destructor is public, then calling code can attempt to destroy a derived class object through a base class pointer, and the result is undefined if the base class's destructor is non-virtual.\nIf the destructor is protected, then calling code cannot destroy through a base class pointer and the destructor does not need to be virtual; it does need to be protected, not private, so that derived destructors can invoke it.\nIn general, the writer of a base class does not know the appropriate action to be done upon destruction.\n\n##### Discussion\n\nSee [this in the Discussion section](#Sd-dtor).\n\n##### Example, bad\n\n    struct Base {  // BAD: implicitly has a public non-virtual destructor\n        virtual void f();\n    };\n\n    struct D : Base {\n        string s {\"a resource needing cleanup\"};\n        ~D() { /* ... do some cleanup ... */ }\n        // ...\n    };\n\n    void use()\n    {\n        unique_ptr<Base> p = make_unique<D>();\n        // ...\n    } // p's destruction calls ~Base(), not ~D(), which leaks D::s and possibly more\n\n##### Note\n\nA virtual function defines an interface to derived classes that can be used without looking at the derived classes.\nIf the interface allows destroying, it should be safe to do so.\n\n##### Note\n\nA destructor must be non-private or it will prevent using the type:\n\n    class X {\n        ~X();   // private destructor\n        // ...\n    };\n\n    void use()\n    {\n        X a;                        // error: cannot destroy\n        auto p = make_unique<X>();  // error: cannot destroy\n    }\n\n##### Exception\n\nWe can imagine one case where you could want a protected virtual destructor: When an object of a derived type (and only of such a type) should be allowed to destroy *another* object (not itself) through a pointer to base. We haven't seen such a case in practice, though.\n\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* A class with any virtual functions should have a destructor that is either public and virtual or else protected and non-virtual.\n* If a class inherits publicly from a base class, the base class should have a destructor that is either public and virtual or else protected and non-virtual.\n\n### <a name=\"Rc-dtor-fail\"></a>C.36: A destructor must not fail\n\n##### Reason\n\nIn general we do not know how to write error-free code if a destructor should fail.\nThe standard library requires that all classes it deals with have destructors that do not exit by throwing.\n\n##### Example\n\n    class X {\n    public:\n        ~X() noexcept;\n        // ...\n    };\n\n    X::~X() noexcept\n    {\n        // ...\n        if (cannot_release_a_resource) terminate();\n        // ...\n    }\n\n##### Note\n\nMany have tried to devise a fool-proof scheme for dealing with failure in destructors.\nNone have succeeded to come up with a general scheme.\nThis can be a real practical problem: For example, what about a socket that won't close?\nThe writer of a destructor does not know why the destructor is called and cannot \"refuse to act\" by throwing an exception.\nSee [discussion](#Sd-never-fail).\nTo make the problem worse, many \"close/release\" operations are not retryable.\nIf at all possible, consider failure to close/cleanup a fundamental design error and terminate.\n\n##### Note\n\nDeclare a destructor `noexcept`. That will ensure that it either completes normally or terminates the program.\n\n##### Note\n\nIf a resource cannot be released and the program must not fail, try to signal the failure to the rest of the system somehow\n(maybe even by modifying some global state and hope something will notice and be able to take care of the problem).\nBe fully aware that this technique is special-purpose and error-prone.\nConsider the \"my connection will not close\" example.\nProbably there is a problem at the other end of the connection and only a piece of code responsible for both ends of the connection can properly handle the problem.\nThe destructor could send a message (somehow) to the responsible part of the system, consider that to have closed the connection, and return normally.\n\n##### Note\n\nIf a destructor uses operations that could fail, it can catch exceptions and in some cases still complete successfully\n(e.g., by using a different clean-up mechanism from the one that threw an exception).\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n(Simple) A destructor should be declared `noexcept` if it could throw.\n\n### <a name=\"Rc-dtor-noexcept\"></a>C.37: Make destructors `noexcept`\n\n##### Reason\n\n [A destructor must not fail](#Rc-dtor-fail). If a destructor tries to exit with an exception, it's a bad design error and the program had better terminate.\n\n##### Note\n\nA destructor (either user-defined or compiler-generated) is implicitly declared `noexcept` (independently of what code is in its body) if all of the members of its class have `noexcept` destructors. By explicitly marking destructors `noexcept`, an author guards against the destructor becoming implicitly `noexcept(false)` through the addition or modification of a class member.\n\n##### Example\n\nNot all destructors are noexcept by default; one throwing member poisons the whole class hierarchy\n\n    struct X {\n        Details x;  // happens to have a throwing destructor\n        // ...\n        ~X() { }    // implicitly noexcept(false); aka can throw\n    };\n\nSo, if in doubt, declare a destructor noexcept.\n\n##### Note\n\nWhy not then declare all destructors noexcept?\nBecause that would in many cases -- especially simple cases -- be distracting clutter.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n(Simple) A destructor should be declared `noexcept` if it could throw.\n\n## <a name=\"SS-ctor\"></a>C.ctor: Constructors\n\nA constructor defines how an object is initialized (constructed).\n\n### <a name=\"Rc-ctor\"></a>C.40: Define a constructor if a class has an invariant\n\n##### Reason\n\nThat's what constructors are for.\n\n##### Example\n\n    class Date {  // a Date represents a valid date\n                  // in the January 1, 1900 to December 31, 2100 range\n        Date(int dd, int mm, int yy)\n            :d{dd}, m{mm}, y{yy}\n        {\n            if (!is_valid(d, m, y)) throw Bad_date{};  // enforce invariant\n        }\n        // ...\n    private:\n        int d, m, y;\n    };\n\nIt is often a good idea to express the invariant as an `Ensures` on the constructor.\n\n##### Note\n\nA constructor can be used for convenience even if a class does not have an invariant. For example:\n\n    struct Rec {\n        string s;\n        int i {0};\n        Rec(const string& ss) : s{ss} {}\n        Rec(int ii) :i{ii} {}\n    };\n\n    Rec r1 {7};\n    Rec r2 {\"Foo bar\"};\n\n##### Note\n\nThe C++11 initializer list rule eliminates the need for many constructors. For example:\n\n    struct Rec2{\n        string s;\n        int i;\n        Rec2(const string& ss, int ii = 0) :s{ss}, i{ii} {}   // redundant\n    };\n\n    Rec2 r1 {\"Foo\", 7};\n    Rec2 r2 {\"Bar\"};\n\nThe `Rec2` constructor is redundant.\nAlso, the default for `int` would be better done as a [default member initializer](#Rc-in-class-initializer).\n\n**See also**: [construct valid object](#Rc-complete) and [constructor throws](#Rc-throw).\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* Flag classes with user-defined copy operations but no constructor (a user-defined copy is a good indicator that the class has an invariant)\n\n### <a name=\"Rc-complete\"></a>C.41: A constructor should create a fully initialized object\n\n##### Reason\n\nA constructor establishes the invariant for a class.

Such a type can naturally use the special state as a default constructed value, whether or not it is copyable:\n\n    // std::ofstream is not a copyable type.\n    // It does happen to have a default constructor\n    // that goes along with a special \"not open\" state.\n    ofstream out {\"Foobar\"};\n    // ...\n    out << log(time, transaction);\n\nSimilar special-state types that are copyable, such as copyable smart pointers that have the special state \"==nullptr\", should use the special state as their default constructed value.\n\nHowever, it is preferable to have a default constructor default to a meaningful state such as `std::string`s `\"\"` and `std::vector`s `{}`.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* Flag classes that are copyable by `=` without a default constructor\n* Flag classes that are comparable with `==` but not copyable\n\n\n### <a name=\"Rc-default00\"></a>C.44: Prefer default constructors to be simple and non-throwing\n\n##### Reason\n\nBeing able to set a value to \"the default\" without operations that might fail simplifies error handling and reasoning about move operations.\n\n##### Example, problematic\n\n    template<typename T>\n    // elem points to space-elem element allocated using new\n    class Vector0 {\n    public:\n        Vector0() :Vector0{0} {}\n        Vector0(int n) :elem{new T[n]}, space{elem + n}, last{elem} {}\n        // ...\n    private:\n        own<T*> elem;\n        T* space;\n        T* last;\n    };\n\nThis is nice and general, but setting a `Vector0` to empty after an error involves an allocation, which might fail.\nAlso, having a default `Vector` represented as `{new T[0], 0, 0}` seems wasteful.\nFor example, `Vector0<int> v[100]` costs 100 allocations.\n\n##### Example\n\n    template<typename T>\n    // elem is nullptr or elem points to space-elem element allocated using new\n    class Vector1 {\n    public:\n        // sets the representation to {nullptr, nullptr, nullptr}; doesn't throw\n        Vector1() noexcept {}\n        Vector1(int n) :elem{new T[n]}, space{elem + n}, last{elem} {}\n        // ...\n    private:\n        own<T*> elem {};\n        T* space {};\n        T* last {};\n    };\n\nUsing `{nullptr, nullptr, nullptr}` makes `Vector1{}` cheap, but a special case and implies run-time checks.\nSetting a `Vector1` to empty after detecting an error is trivial.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* Flag throwing default constructors\n\n### <a name=\"Rc-default\"></a>C.45: Don't define a default constructor that only initializes data members; use default member initializers instead\n\n##### Reason\n\nUsing default member initializers lets the compiler generate the function for you.

The problem with `j` (forgetting to initialize a member) often happens when a new member is added to an existing class.\n\n##### Example\n\n    class X2 {\n        int i {666};\n        string s {\"qqq\"};\n        int j {0};\n    public:\n        X2() = default;        // all members are initialized to their defaults\n        X2(int ii) :i{ii} {}   // s and j initialized to their defaults\n        // ...\n    };\n\n**Alternative**: We can get part of the benefits from default arguments to constructors, and that is not uncommon in older code.

Consider a simple `Vector` intended for a domain where assignment of large, equal-sized `Vector`s is common. In this case, the copy of elements implied by the `swap` implementation technique could cause an order of magnitude increase in cost:\n\n    template<typename T>\n    class Vector {\n    public:\n        Vector& operator=(const Vector&);\n        // ...\n    private:\n        T* elem;\n        int sz;\n    };\n\n    Vector& Vector::operator=(const Vector& a)\n    {\n        if (a.sz > sz) {\n            // ... use the swap technique, it can't be bettered ...\n            return *this;\n        }\n        // ... copy sz elements from *a.elem to elem ...\n        if (a.sz < sz) {\n            // ... destroy the surplus elements in *this and adjust size ...\n        }\n        return *this;\n    }\n\nBy writing directly to the target elements, we will get only [the basic guarantee](#Abrahams01) rather than the strong guarantee offered by the `swap` technique. Beware of [self-assignment](#Rc-copy-self).\n\n**Alternatives**: If you think you need a `virtual` assignment operator, and understand why that's deeply problematic, don't call it `operator=`. Make it a named function like `virtual void assign(const Foo&)`.\nSee [copy constructor vs. `clone()`](#Rc-copy-virtual).\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* (Simple) An assignment operator should not be virtual.

After `x = y`, we should have `x == y`.\nAfter a copy `x` and `y` can be independent objects (value semantics, the way non-pointer built-in types and the standard-library types work) or refer to a shared object (pointer semantics, the way pointers work).\n\n##### Example\n\n    class X {   // OK: value semantics\n    public:\n        X();\n        X(const X&);     // copy X\n        void modify();   // change the value of X\n        // ...\n        ~X() { delete[] p; }\n    private:\n        T* p;\n        int sz;\n    };\n\n    bool operator==(const X& a, const X& b)\n    {\n        return a.sz == b.sz && equal(a.p, a.p + a.sz, b.p, b.p + b.sz);\n    }\n\n    X::X(const X& a)\n        :p{new T[a.sz]}, sz{a.sz}\n    {\n        copy(a.p, a.p + sz, p);\n    }\n\n    X x;\n    X y = x;\n    if (x != y) throw Bad{};\n    x.modify();\n    if (x == y) throw Bad{};   // assume value semantics\n\n##### Example\n\n    class X2 {  // OK: pointer semantics\n    public:\n        X2();\n        X2(const X2&) = default; // shallow copy\n        ~X2() = default;\n        void modify();          // change the pointed-to value\n        // ...\n    private:\n        T* p;\n        int sz;\n    };\n\n    bool operator==(const X2& a, const X2& b)\n    {\n        return a.sz == b.sz && a.p == b.p;\n    }\n\n    X2 x;\n    X2 y = x;\n    if (x != y) throw Bad{};\n    x.modify();\n    if (x != y) throw Bad{};  // assume pointer semantics\n\n##### Note\n\nPrefer value semantics unless you are building a \"smart pointer\".

However, people don't usually directly write a self-assignment that turn into a move, but it can occur. However, `std::swap` is implemented using move operations so if you accidentally do `swap(a, b)` where `a` and `b` refer to the same object, failing to handle self-move could be a serious and subtle error.\n\n##### Example\n\n    class Foo {\n        string s;\n        int i;\n    public:\n        Foo& operator=(Foo&& a) noexcept;\n        // ...\n    };\n\n    Foo& Foo::operator=(Foo&& a) noexcept  // OK, but there is a cost\n    {\n        if (this == &a) return *this;  // this line is redundant\n        s = std::move(a.s);\n        i = a.i;\n        return *this;\n    }\n\nThe one-in-a-million argument against `if (this == &a) return *this;` tests from the discussion of [self-assignment](#Rc-copy-self) is even more relevant for self-move.\n\n##### Note\n\nThere is no known general way of avoiding an `if (this == &a) return *this;` test for a move assignment and still get a correct answer (i.e., after `x = x` the value of `x` is unchanged).\n\n##### Note\n\nThe ISO standard guarantees only a \"valid but unspecified\" state for the standard-library containers. Apparently this has not been a problem in about 10 years of experimental and production use. Please contact the editors if you find a counter example. The rule here is more caution and insists on complete safety.\n\n##### Example\n\nHere is a way to move a pointer without a test (imagine it as code in the implementation a move assignment):\n\n    // move from other.ptr to this->ptr\n    T* temp = other.ptr;\n    other.ptr = nullptr;\n    delete ptr; // in self-move, this->ptr is also null; delete is a no-op\n    ptr = temp; // in self-move, the original ptr is restored\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* (Moderate) In the case of self-assignment, a move assignment operator should not leave the object holding pointer members that have been `delete`d or set to `nullptr`.\n* (Not enforceable) Look at the use of standard-library container types (incl. `string`) and consider them safe for ordinary (not life-critical) uses.\n\n### <a name=\"Rc-move-noexcept\"></a>C.66: Make move operations `noexcept`\n\n##### Reason\n\nA throwing move violates most people's reasonable assumptions.\nA non-throwing move will be used more efficiently by standard-library and language facilities.\n\n##### Example\n\n    template<typename T>\n    class Vector {\n    public:\n        Vector(Vector&& a) noexcept :elem{a.elem}, sz{a.sz} { a.elem = nullptr; a.sz = 0; }\n        Vector& operator=(Vector&& a) noexcept {\n            if (&a != this) {\n                delete elem;\n                elem = a.elem; a.elem = nullptr;\n                sz   = a.sz;   a.sz   = 0;\n            }\n            return *this;\n        }\n        // ...\n    private:\n        T* elem;\n        int sz;\n    };\n\nThese operations do not throw.\n\n##### Example, bad\n\n    template<typename T>\n    class Vector2 {\n    public:\n        Vector2(Vector2&& a) noexcept { *this = a; }             // just use the copy\n        Vector2& operator=(Vector2&& a) noexcept { *this = a; }  // just use the copy\n        // ...\n    private:\n        T* elem;\n        int sz;\n    };\n\nThis `Vector2` is not just inefficient, but since a vector copy requires allocation, it can throw.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n(Simple) A move operation should be marked `noexcept`.\n\n### <a name=\"Rc-copy-virtual\"></a>C.67: A polymorphic class should suppress public copy/move\n\n##### Reason\n\nA *polymorphic class* is a class that defines or inherits at least one virtual function.

A compiler does it better.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n(Moderate) The body of a user-defined operation should not have the same semantics as the compiler-generated version, because that would be redundant.\n\n### <a name=\"Rc-delete\"></a>C.81: Use `=delete` when you want to disable default behavior (without wanting an alternative)\n\n##### Reason\n\nIn a few cases, a default operation is not desirable.\n\n##### Example\n\n    class Immortal {\n    public:\n        ~Immortal() = delete;   // do not allow destruction\n        // ...\n    };\n\n    void use()\n    {\n        Immortal ugh;   // error: ugh cannot be destroyed\n        Immortal* p = new Immortal{};\n        delete p;       // error: cannot destroy *p\n    }\n\n##### Example\n\nA `unique_ptr` can be moved, but not copied. To achieve that its copy operations are deleted. To avoid copying it is necessary to `=delete` its copy operations from lvalues:\n\n    template<class T, class D = default_delete<T>> class unique_ptr {\n    public:\n        // ...\n        constexpr unique_ptr() noexcept;\n        explicit unique_ptr(pointer p) noexcept;\n        // ...\n        unique_ptr(unique_ptr&& u) noexcept;   // move constructor\n        // ...\n        unique_ptr(const unique_ptr&) = delete; // disable copy from lvalue\n        // ...\n    };\n\n    unique_ptr<int> make();   // make \"something\" and return it by moving\n\n    void f()\n    {\n        unique_ptr<int> pi {};\n        auto pi2 {pi};      // error: no move constructor from lvalue\n        auto pi3 {make()};  // OK, move: the result of make() is an rvalue\n    }\n\nNote that deleted functions should be public.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nThe elimination of a default operation is (should be) based on the desired semantics of the class. Consider such classes suspect, but maintain a \"positive list\" of classes where a human has asserted that the semantics is correct.\n\n### <a name=\"Rc-ctor-virtual\"></a>C.82: Don't call virtual functions in constructors and destructors\n\n##### Reason\n\nThe function called will be that of the object constructed so far, rather than a possibly overriding function in a derived class.\nThis can be most confusing.\nWorse, a direct or indirect call to an unimplemented pure virtual function from a constructor or destructor results in undefined behavior.\n\n##### Example, bad\n\n    class Base {\n    public:\n        virtual void f() = 0;   // not implemented\n        virtual void g();       // implemented with Base version\n        virtual void h();       // implemented with Base version\n        virtual ~Base();        // implemented with Base version\n    };\n\n    class Derived : public Base {\n    public:\n        void g() override;   // provide Derived implementation\n        void h() final;      // provide Derived implementation\n\n        Derived()\n        {\n            // BAD: attempt to call an unimplemented virtual function\n            f();\n\n            // BAD: will call Derived::g, not dispatch further virtually\n            g();\n\n            // GOOD: explicitly state intent to call only the visible version\n            Derived::g();\n\n            // ok, no qualification needed, h is final\n            h();\n        }\n    };\n\nNote that calling a specific explicitly qualified function is not a virtual call even if the function is `virtual`.\n\n**See also** [factory functions](#Rc-factory) for how to achieve the effect of a call to a derived class function without risking undefined behavior.\n\n##### Note\n\nThere is nothing inherently wrong with calling virtual functions from constructors and destructors.\nThe semantics of such calls is type safe.\nHowever, experience shows that such calls are rarely needed, easily confuse maintainers, and become a source of errors when used by novices.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* Flag calls of virtual functions from constructors and destructors.\n\n### <a name=\"Rc-swap\"></a>C.83: For value-like types, consider providing a `noexcept` swap function\n\n##### Reason\n\nA `swap` can be handy for implementing a number of idioms, from smoothly moving objects around to implementing assignment easily to providing a guaranteed commit function that enables strongly error-safe calling code. Consider using swap to implement copy assignment in terms of copy construction. See also [destructors, deallocation, and swap must never fail](#Re-never-fail).\n\n##### Example, good\n\n    class Foo {\n    public:\n        void swap(Foo& rhs) noexcept\n        {\n            m1.swap(rhs.m1);\n            std::swap(m2, rhs.m2);\n        }\n    private:\n        Bar m1;\n        int m2;\n    };\n\nProviding a non-member `swap` function in the same namespace as your type for callers' convenience.\n\n    void swap(Foo& a, Foo& b)\n    {\n        a.swap(b);\n    }\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* Non-trivially copyable types should provide a member swap or a free swap overload.\n* (Simple) When a class has a `swap` member function, it should be declared `noexcept`.\n\n### <a name=\"Rc-swap-fail\"></a>C.84: A `swap` function must not fail\n\n##### Reason\n\n `swap` is widely used in ways that are assumed never to fail and programs cannot easily be written to work correctly in the presence of a failing `swap`. The standard-library containers and algorithms will not work correctly if a swap of an element type fails.\n\n##### Example, bad\n\n    void swap(My_vector& x, My_vector& y)\n    {\n        auto tmp = x;   // copy elements\n        x = y;\n        y = tmp;\n    }\n\nThis is not just slow, but if a memory allocation occurs for the elements in `tmp`, this `swap` could throw and would make STL algorithms fail if used with them.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n(Simple) When a class has a `swap` member function, it should be declared `noexcept`.\n\n### <a name=\"Rc-swap-noexcept\"></a>C.85: Make `swap` `noexcept`\n\n##### Reason\n\n [A `swap` must not fail](#Rc-swap-fail).\nIf a `swap` tries to exit with an exception, it's a bad design error and the program had better terminate.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n(Simple) When a class has a `swap` member function, it should be declared `noexcept`.\n\n### <a name=\"Rc-eq\"></a>C.86: Make `==` symmetric with respect to operand types and `noexcept`\n\n##### Reason\n\nAsymmetric treatment of operands is surprising and a source of errors where conversions are possible.\n`==` is a fundamental operation and programmers should be able to use it without fear of failure.\n\n##### Example\n\n    struct X {\n        string name;\n        int number;\n    };\n\n    bool operator==(const X& a, const X& b) noexcept {\n        return a.name == b.name && a.number == b.number;\n    }\n\n##### Example, bad\n\n    class B {\n        string name;\n        int number;\n        bool operator==(const B& a) const {\n            return name == a.name && number == a.number;\n        }\n        // ...\n    };\n\n`B`'s comparison accepts conversions for its second operand, but not its first.\n\n##### Note\n\nIf a class has a failure state, like `double`'s `NaN`, there is a temptation to make a comparison against the failure state throw.\nThe alternative is to make two failure states compare equal and any valid state compare false against the failure state.\n\n##### Note\n\nThis rule applies to all the usual comparison operators: `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, and `>=`.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* Flag an `operator==()` for which the argument types differ;

As specified in guideline [C.41](#Rc-complete): a constructor should create a fully initialized object. No additional initialization, such as by `memcpy`, should be required.\nA type will provide a copy constructor and/or copy assignment operator to appropriately make a copy of the class, preserving the type's invariants.  Using memcpy to copy a non-trivially copyable type has undefined behavior.  Frequently this results in slicing, or data corruption.\n\n##### Example, good\n\n    struct base {\n        virtual void update() = 0;\n        std::shared_ptr<int> sp;\n    };\n\n    struct derived : public base {\n        void update() override {}\n    };\n\n##### Example, bad\n\n    void init(derived& a)\n    {\n        memset(&a, 0, sizeof(derived));\n    }\n\nThis is type-unsafe and overwrites the vtable.\n\n##### Example, bad\n\n    void copy(derived& a, derived& b)\n    {\n        memcpy(&a, &b, sizeof(derived));\n    }\n\nThis is also type-unsafe and overwrites the vtable.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* Flag passing a non-trivially-copyable type to `memset` or `memcpy`.\n\n## <a name=\"SS-containers\"></a>C.con: Containers and other resource handles\n\nA container is an object holding a sequence of objects of some type;

Usually this means that the derived type needs to override a base virtual function or needs access to a protected member.\n\n##### Example\n\n    class DrawableUIElement {\n    public:\n        virtual void render() const = 0;\n        // ...\n    };\n\n    class AbstractButton : public DrawableUIElement {\n    public:\n        virtual void onClick() = 0;\n        // ...\n    };\n\n    class PushButton : public AbstractButton {\n        void render() const override;\n        void onClick() override;\n        // ...\n    };\n\n    class Checkbox : public AbstractButton {\n    // ...\n    };\n\n##### Example, bad\n\nDo *not* represent non-hierarchical domain concepts as class hierarchies.\n\n    template<typename T>\n    class Container {\n    public:\n        // list operations:\n        virtual T& get() = 0;\n        virtual void put(T&) = 0;\n        virtual void insert(Position) = 0;\n        // ...\n        // vector operations:\n        virtual T& operator[](int) = 0;\n        virtual void sort() = 0;\n        // ...\n        // tree operations:\n        virtual void balance() = 0;\n        // ...\n    };\n\nHere most overriding classes cannot implement most of the functions required in the interface well.\nThus the base class becomes an implementation burden.\nFurthermore, the user of `Container` cannot rely on the member functions actually performing meaningful operations reasonably efficiently;\nit might throw an exception instead.\nThus users have to resort to run-time checking and/or\nnot using this (over)general interface in favor of a particular interface found by a run-time type inquiry (e.g., a `dynamic_cast`).\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* Look for classes with lots of members that do nothing but throw.\n* Flag every use of a non-public base class `B` where the derived class `D` does not override a virtual function or access a protected member in `B`, and `B` is not one of the following: empty, a template parameter or parameter pack of `D`, a class template specialized with `D`.\n\n### <a name=\"Rh-abstract\"></a>C.121: If a base class is used as an interface, make it a pure abstract class\n\n##### Reason\n\nA class is more stable (less brittle) if it does not contain data.\nInterfaces should normally be composed entirely of public pure virtual functions and a default/empty virtual destructor.\n\n##### Example\n\n    class My_interface {\n    public:\n        // ...only pure virtual functions here ...\n        virtual ~My_interface() {}   // or =default\n    };\n\n##### Example, bad\n\n    class Goof {\n    public:\n        // ...only pure virtual functions here ...\n        // no virtual destructor\n    };\n\n    class Derived : public Goof {\n        string s;\n        // ...\n    };\n\n    void use()\n    {\n        unique_ptr<Goof> p {new Derived{\"here we go\"}};\n        f(p.get());

such classes tend to have constructors. But be warned: Such classes also tend to be prone to requiring virtual inheritance.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nFlag abstract classes with constructors.\n\n### <a name=\"Rh-dtor\"></a>C.127: A class with a virtual function should have a virtual or protected destructor\n\n##### Reason\n\nA class with a virtual function is usually (and in general) used via a pointer to base. Usually, the last user has to call delete on a pointer to base, often via a smart pointer to base, so the destructor should be public and virtual. Less commonly, if deletion through a pointer to base is not intended to be supported, the destructor should be protected and non-virtual; see [C.35](#Rc-dtor-virtual).\n\n##### Example, bad\n\n    struct B {\n        virtual int f() = 0;\n        // ... no user-written destructor, defaults to public non-virtual ...\n    };\n\n    // bad: derived from a class without a virtual destructor\n    struct D : B {\n        string s {\"default\"};\n        // ...\n    };\n\n    void use()\n    {\n        unique_ptr<B> p = make_unique<D>();\n        // ...\n    } // undefined behavior, might call B::~B only and leak the string\n\n##### Note\n\nThere are people who don't follow this rule because they plan to use a class only through a `shared_ptr`: `std::shared_ptr<B> p = std::make_shared<D>(args);` Here, the shared pointer will take care of deletion, so no leak will occur from an inappropriate `delete` of the base. People who do this consistently can get a false positive, but the rule is important -- what if one was allocated using `make_unique`? It's not safe unless the author of `B` ensures that it can never be misused, such as by making all constructors private and providing a factory function to enforce the allocation with `make_shared`.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* A class with any virtual functions should have a destructor that is either public and virtual or else protected and non-virtual.\n* Flag `delete` of a class with a virtual function but no virtual destructor.\n\n### <a name=\"Rh-override\"></a>C.128: Virtual functions should specify exactly one of `virtual`, `override`, or `final`\n\n##### Reason\n\nReadability.\nDetection of mistakes.\nWriting explicit `virtual`, `override`, or `final` is self-documenting and enables the compiler to catch mismatch of types and/or names between base and derived classes. However, writing more than one of these three is both redundant and a potential source of errors.\n\nIt's simple and clear:\n\n* `virtual` means exactly and only \"this is a new virtual function.\"\n* `override` means exactly and only \"this is a non-final overrider.\"\n* `final` means exactly and only \"this is a final overrider.\"\n\n##### Example, bad\n\n    struct B {\n        void f1(int);\n        virtual void f2(int) const;\n        virtual void f3(int);\n        // ...\n    };\n\n    struct D : B {\n        void f1(int);        // bad (hope for a warning): D::f1() hides B::f1()\n        void f2(int) const;  // bad (but conventional and valid): no explicit override\n        void f3(double);     // bad (hope for a warning): D::f3() hides B::f3()\n        // ...\n    };\n\n##### Example, good\n\n    struct Better : B {\n        void f1(int) override;        // error (caught): Better::f1() hides B::f1()\n        void f2(int) const override;\n        void f3(double) override;     // error (caught): Better::f3() hides B::f3()\n        // ...\n    };\n\n#### Discussion\n\nWe want to eliminate two particular classes of errors:\n\n* **implicit virtual**: the programmer intended the function to be implicitly virtual and it is (but readers of the code can't tell); or the programmer intended the function to be implicitly virtual but it isn't (e.g., because of a subtle parameter list mismatch); or the programmer did not intend the function to be virtual but it is (because it happens to have the same signature as a virtual in the base class)\n* **implicit override**: the programmer intended the function to be implicitly an overrider and it is (but readers of the code can't tell); or the programmer intended the function to be implicitly an overrider but it isn't (e.g., because of a subtle parameter list mismatch); or the programmer did not intend the function to be an overrider but it is (because it happens to have the same signature as a virtual in the base class -- note this problem arises whether or not the function is explicitly declared virtual, because the programmer might have intended to create either a new virtual function or a new non-virtual function)\n\nNote: On a class defined as `final`, it doesn't matter whether you put `override` or `final` on an individual virtual function.\n\nNote: Use `final` on functions sparingly. It does not necessarily lead to optimization, and it precludes further overriding.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* Compare virtual function names in base and derived classes and flag uses of the same name that does not override.\n* Flag overrides with neither `override` nor `final`.\n* Flag function declarations that use more than one of `virtual`, `override`, and `final`.\n\n### <a name=\"Rh-kind\"></a>C.129: When designing a class hierarchy, distinguish between implementation inheritance and interface inheritance\n\n##### Reason\n\nImplementation details in an interface make the interface brittle;\nthat is, make its users vulnerable to having to recompile after changes in the implementation.\nData in a base class increases the complexity of implementing the base and can lead to replication of code.\n\n##### Note\n\nDefinition:\n\n* interface inheritance is the use of inheritance to separate users from implementations,\nin particular to allow derived classes to be added and changed without affecting the users of base classes.\n* implementation inheritance is the use of inheritance to simplify implementation of new facilities\nby making useful operations available for implementers of related new operations (sometimes called \"programming by difference\").\n\nA pure interface class is simply a set of pure virtual functions; see [I.25](#Ri-abstract).\n\nIn early OOP (e.g., in the 1980s and 1990s), implementation inheritance and interface inheritance were often mixed\nand bad habits die hard.\nEven now, mixtures are not uncommon in old code bases and in old-style teaching material.\n\nThe importance of keeping the two kinds of inheritance increases\n\n* with the size of a hierarchy (e.g., dozens of derived classes),\n* with the length of time the hierarchy is used (e.g., decades), and\n* with the number of distinct organizations in which a hierarchy is used\n(e.g., it can be difficult to distribute an update to a base class)\n\n\n##### Example, bad\n\n    class Shape {   // BAD, mixed interface and implementation\n    public:\n        Shape();\n        Shape(Point ce = {0, 0}, Color co = none): cent{ce}, col {co} { /* ... */}\n\n        Point center() const { return cent; }\n        Color color() const { return col; }\n\n        virtual void rotate(int) = 0;\n        virtual void move(Point p) { cent = p; redraw(); }\n\n        virtual void redraw();\n\n        // ...\n    private:\n        Point cent;\n        Color col;\n    };\n\n    class Circle : public Shape {\n    public:\n        Circle(Point c, int r) : Shape{c}, rad{r} { /* ... */ }\n\n        // ...\n    private:\n        int rad;\n    };\n\n    class Triangle : public Shape {\n    public:\n        Triangle(Point p1, Point p2, Point p3); // calculate center\n        // ...\n    };\n\nProblems:\n\n* As the hierarchy grows and more data is added to `Shape`, the constructors get harder to write and maintain.\n* Why calculate the center for the `Triangle`? we might never use it.\n* Add a data member to `Shape` (e.g., drawing style or canvas)\nand all classes derived from `Shape` and all code using `Shape` will need to be reviewed, possibly changed, and probably recompiled.\n\nThe implementation of `Shape::move()` is an example of implementation inheritance:\nwe have defined `move()` once and for all, for all derived classes.\nThe more code there is in such base class member function implementations and the more data is shared by placing it in the base,\nthe more benefits we gain - and the less stable the hierarchy is.\n\n##### Example\n\nThis Shape hierarchy can be rewritten using interface inheritance:\n\n    class Shape {  // pure interface\n    public:\n        virtual Point center() const = 0;\n        virtual Color color() const = 0;\n\n        virtual void rotate(int) = 0;\n        virtual void move(Point p) = 0;\n\n        virtual void redraw() = 0;\n\n        // ...\n    };\n\nNote that a pure interface rarely has constructors: there is nothing to construct.\n\n    class Circle : public Shape {\n    public:\n        Circle(Point c, int r, Color c) : cent{c}, rad{r}, col{c} { /* ... */ }\n\n        Point center() const override { return cent; }\n        Color color() const override { return col; }\n\n        // ...\n    private:\n        Point cent;\n        int rad;\n        Color col;\n    };\n\nThe interface is now less brittle, but there is more work in implementing the member functions.\nFor example, `center` has to be implemented by every class derived from `Shape`.\n\n##### Example, dual hierarchy\n\nHow can we gain the benefit of stable hierarchies from interface hierarchies and the benefit of implementation reuse from implementation inheritance?\nOne popular technique is dual hierarchies.\nThere are many ways of implementing the idea of dual hierarchies; here, we use a multiple-inheritance variant.\n\nFirst we devise a hierarchy of interface classes:\n\n    class Shape {   // pure interface\n    public:\n        virtual Point center() const = 0;\n        virtual Color color() const = 0;\n\n        virtual void rotate(int) = 0;\n        virtual void move(Point p) = 0;\n\n        virtual void redraw() = 0;\n\n        // ...\n    };\n\n    class Circle : public virtual Shape {   // pure interface\n    public:\n        virtual int radius() = 0;\n        // ...\n    };\n\nTo make this interface useful, we must provide its implementation classes (here, named equivalently, but in the `Impl` namespace):\n\n    class Impl::Shape : public virtual ::Shape { // implementation\n    public:\n        // constructors, destructor\n        // ...\n        Point center() const override { /* ... */ }\n        Color color() const override { /* ... */ }\n\n        void rotate(int) override { /* ... */ }\n        void move(Point p) override { /* ... */ }\n\n        void redraw() override { /* ... */ }\n\n        // ...\n    };\n\nNow `Shape` is a poor example of a class with an implementation,\nbut bear with us because this is just a simple example of a technique aimed at more complex hierarchies.\n\n    class Impl::Circle : public virtual ::Circle, public Impl::Shape {   // implementation\n    public:\n        // constructors, destructor\n\n        int radius() override { /* ... */ }\n        // ...\n    };\n\nAnd we could extend the hierarchies by adding a Smiley class (:-)):\n\n    class Smiley : public virtual Circle { // pure interface\n    public:\n        // ...\n    };\n\n    class Impl::Smiley : public virtual ::Smiley, public Impl::Circle {   // implementation\n    public:\n        // constructors, destructor\n        // ...\n    }\n\nThere are now two hierarchies:\n\n* interface: Smiley -> Circle -> Shape\n* implementation: Impl::Smiley -> Impl::Circle -> Impl::Shape\n\nSince each implementation is derived from its interface as well as its implementation base class we get a lattice (DAG):\n\n    Smiley     ->         Circle     ->  Shape\n      ^                     ^               ^\n      |                     |               |\n    Impl::Smiley -> Impl::Circle -> Impl::Shape\n\nAs mentioned, this is just one way to construct a dual hierarchy.\n\nThe implementation hierarchy can be used directly, rather than through the abstract interface.\n\n    void work_with_shape(Shape&);\n\n    int user()\n    {\n        Impl::Smiley my_smiley{ /* args */ };   // create concrete shape\n        // ...\n        my_smiley.some_member();        // use implementation class directly\n        // ...\n        work_with_shape(my_smiley);     // use implementation through abstract interface\n        // ...\n    }\n\nThis can be useful when the implementation class has members that are not offered in the abstract interface\nor if direct use of a member offers optimization opportunities (e.g., if an implementation member function is `final`)\n\n##### Note\n\nAnother (related) technique for separating interface and implementation is [Pimpl](#Ri-pimpl).\n\n##### Note\n\nThere is often a choice between offering common functionality as (implemented) base class functions and freestanding functions\n(in an implementation namespace).\nBase classes give a shorter notation and easier access to shared data (in the base)\nat the cost of the functionality being available only to users of the hierarchy.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* Flag a derived to base conversion to a base with both data and virtual functions\n(except for calls from a derived class member to a base class member)\n* ???\n\n\n### <a name=\"Rh-copy\"></a>C.130: For making deep copies of polymorphic classes prefer a virtual `clone` function instead of public copy construction/assignment\n\n##### Reason\n\nCopying a polymorphic class is discouraged due to the slicing problem, see [C.67](#Rc-copy-virtual). If you really need copy semantics, copy deeply: Provide a virtual `clone` function that will copy the actual most-derived type and return an owning pointer to the new object, and then in derived classes return the derived type (use a covariant return type).\n\n##### Example\n\n    class B {\n    public:\n        B() = default;\n        virtual ~B() = default;\n        virtual gsl::owner<B*> clone() const = 0;\n    protected:\n         B(const B&) = default;\n         B& operator=(const B&) = default;\n         B(B&&) noexcept = default;\n         B& operator=(B&&) noexcept = default;\n        // ...\n    };\n\n    class D : public B {\n    public:\n        gsl::owner<D*> clone() const override\n        {\n            return new D{*this};\n        };\n    };\n\nGenerally, it is recommended to use smart pointers to represent ownership (see [R.20](#Rr-owner)). However, because of language rules, the covariant return type cannot be a smart pointer: `D::clone` can't return a `unique_ptr<D>` while `B::clone` returns `unique_ptr<B>`.

While it is not a complete definition of \"trivial\", consider whether there would be any difference beyond syntax if the getter/setter was a public data member instead. Examples of non-trivial semantics would be: maintaining a class invariant or converting between an internal type and an interface type.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nFlag multiple `get` and `set` member functions that simply access a member without additional semantics.\n\n### <a name=\"Rh-virtual\"></a>C.132: Don't make a function `virtual` without reason\n\n##### Reason\n\nRedundant `virtual` increases run-time and object-code size.\nA virtual function can be overridden and is thus open to mistakes in a derived class.\nA virtual function ensures code replication in a templated hierarchy.\n\n##### Example, bad\n\n    template<class T>\n    class Vector {\n    public:\n        // ...\n        virtual int size() const { return sz; }   // bad: what good could a derived class do?\n    private:\n        T* elem;   // the elements\n        int sz;    // number of elements\n    };\n\nThis kind of \"vector\" isn't meant to be used as a base class at all.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* Flag a class with virtual functions but no derived classes.\n* Flag a class where all member functions are virtual and have implementations.\n\n### <a name=\"Rh-protected\"></a>C.133: Avoid `protected` data\n\n##### Reason\n\n`protected` data is a source of complexity and errors.\n`protected` data complicates the statement of invariants.\n`protected` data inherently violates the guidance against putting data in base classes, which usually leads to having to deal with virtual inheritance as well.\n\n##### Example, bad\n\n    class Shape {\n    public:\n        // ... interface functions ...\n    protected:\n        // data for use in derived classes:\n        Color fill_color;\n        Color edge_color;\n        Style st;\n    };\n\nNow it is up to every derived `Shape` to manipulate the protected data correctly.\nThis has been popular, but also a major source of maintenance problems.\nIn a large class hierarchy, the consistent use of protected data is hard to maintain because there can be a lot of code,\nspread over a lot of classes.\nThe set of classes that can touch that data is open: anyone can derive a new class and start manipulating the protected data.\nOften, it is not possible to examine the complete set of classes, so any change to the representation of the class becomes infeasible.\nThere is no enforced invariant for the protected data; it is much like a set of global variables.\nThe protected data has de facto become global to a large body of code.\n\n##### Note\n\nProtected data often looks tempting to enable arbitrary improvements through derivation.\nOften, what you get is unprincipled changes and errors.\n[Prefer `private` data](#Rc-private) with a well-specified and enforced invariant.\nAlternative, and often better, [keep data out of any class used as an interface](#Rh-abstract).\n\n##### Note\n\nProtected member function can be just fine.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nFlag classes with `protected` data.\n\n### <a name=\"Rh-public\"></a>C.134: Ensure all non-`const` data members have the same access level\n\n##### Reason\n\nPrevention of logical confusion leading to errors.\nIf the non-`const` data members don't have the same access level, the type is confused about what it's trying to do.\nIs it a type that maintains an invariant or simply a collection of values?\n\n##### Discussion\n\nThe core question is: What code is responsible for maintaining a meaningful/correct value for that variable?\n\nThere are exactly two kinds of data members:\n\n* A: Ones that don't participate in the object's invariant. Any combination of values for these members is valid.\n* B: Ones that do participate in the object's invariant. Not every combination of values is meaningful (else there'd be no invariant). Therefore all code that has write access to these variables must know about the invariant, know the semantics, and know (and actively implement and enforce) the rules for keeping the values correct.\n\nData members in category A should just be `public` (or, more rarely, `protected` if you only want derived classes to see them). They don't need encapsulation. All code in the system might as well see and manipulate them.\n\nData members in category B should be `private` or `const`. This is because encapsulation is important. To make them non-`private` and non-`const` would mean that the object can't control its own state: An unbounded amount of code beyond the class would need to know about the invariant and participate in maintaining it accurately -- if these data members were `public`, that would be all calling code that uses the object; if they were `protected`, it would be all the code in current and future derived classes. This leads to brittle and tightly coupled code that quickly becomes a nightmare to maintain. Any code that inadvertently sets the data members to an invalid or unexpected combination of values would corrupt the object and all subsequent uses of the object.\n\nMost classes are either all A or all B:\n\n* *All public*: If you're writing an aggregate bundle-of-variables without an invariant across those variables, then all the variables should be `public`.\n  [By convention, declare such classes `struct` rather than `class`](#Rc-struct)\n* *All private*: If you're writing a type that maintains an invariant, then all the non-`const` variables should be private -- it should be encapsulated.\n\n##### Exception\n\nOccasionally classes will mix A and B, usually for debug reasons. An encapsulated object might contain something like non-`const` debug instrumentation that isn't part of the invariant and so falls into category A -- it isn't really part of the object's value or meaningful observable state either. In that case, the A parts should be treated as A's (made `public`, or in rarer cases `protected` if they should be visible only to derived classes) and the B parts should still be treated like B's (`private` or `const`).\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nFlag any class that has non-`const` data members with different access levels.\n\n### <a name=\"Rh-mi-interface\"></a>C.135: Use multiple inheritance to represent multiple distinct interfaces\n\n##### Reason\n\nNot all classes will necessarily support all interfaces, and not all callers will necessarily want to deal with all operations.\nEspecially to break apart monolithic interfaces into \"aspects\" of behavior supported by a given derived class.\n\n##### Example\n\n    class iostream : public istream, public ostream {   // very simplified\n        // ...\n    };\n\n`istream` provides the interface to input operations;

Since failure to find the class merely returns a null value, it can be tested during run time. This allows writing code that can choose alternative paths depending on the results.\n\nContrast with [C.147](#Rh-ref-cast), where failure is an error, and should not be used for conditional execution.\n\n##### Example\n\nThe example below describes the `add` function of a `Shape_owner` that takes ownership of constructed `Shape` objects.

It is a general (standard-library) function with a definition that will work for just about any type.\nHowever, it is desirable to define specific `swap()`s for specific types.\nFor example, the general `swap()` will copy the elements of two `vector`s being swapped, whereas a good specific implementation will not copy elements at all.\n\n    namespace N {\n        My_type X { /* ... */ };\n        void swap(X&, X&);   // optimized swap for N::X\n        // ...\n    }\n\n    void f1(N::X& a, N::X& b)\n    {\n        std::swap(a, b);   // probably not what we wanted: calls std::swap()\n    }\n\nThe `std::swap()` in `f1()` does exactly what we asked it to do: it calls the `swap()` in namespace `std`.\nUnfortunately, that's probably not what we wanted.\nHow do we get `N::X` considered?\n\n    void f2(N::X& a, N::X& b)\n    {\n        swap(a, b);   // calls N::swap\n    }\n\nBut that might not be what we wanted for generic code.\nThere, we typically want the specific function if it exists and the general function if not.\nThis is done by including the general function in the lookup for the function:\n\n    void f3(N::X& a, N::X& b)\n    {\n        using std::swap;  // make std::swap available\n        swap(a, b);        // calls N::swap if it exists, otherwise std::swap\n    }\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nUnlikely, except for known customization points, such as `swap`.\nThe problem is that the unqualified and qualified lookups both have uses.\n\n### <a name=\"Ro-address-of\"></a>C.166: Overload unary `&` only as part of a system of smart pointers and references\n\n##### Reason\n\nThe `&` operator is fundamental in C++.\nMany parts of the C++ semantics assume its default meaning.\n\n##### Example\n\n    class Ptr { // a somewhat smart pointer\n        Ptr(X* pp) : p(pp) { /* check */ }\n        X* operator->() { /* check */ return p; }\n        X operator[](int i);\n        X operator*();\n    private:\n        T* p;\n    };\n\n    class X {\n        Ptr operator&() { return Ptr{this}; }\n        // ...\n    };\n\n##### Note\n\nIf you \"mess with\" operator `&` be sure that its definition has matching meanings for `->`, `[]`, `*`, and `.` on the result type.\nNote that operator `.` currently cannot be overloaded so a perfect system is impossible.\nWe hope to remedy that: [Operator Dot (R2)](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/n4477.pdf).\nNote that `std::addressof()` always yields a built-in pointer.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nTricky.

Also, macro names are removed during preprocessing and so usually don't appear in tools like debuggers.\n\n##### Example\n\nFirst some bad old code:\n\n    // webcolors.h (third party header)\n    #define RED   0xFF0000\n    #define GREEN 0x00FF00\n    #define BLUE  0x0000FF\n\n    // productinfo.h\n    // The following define product subtypes based on color\n    #define RED    0\n    #define PURPLE 1\n    #define BLUE   2\n\n    int webby = BLUE;   // webby == 2; probably not what was desired\n\nInstead use an `enum`:\n\n    enum class Web_color { red = 0xFF0000, green = 0x00FF00, blue = 0x0000FF };\n    enum class Product_info { red = 0, purple = 1, blue = 2 };\n\n    int webby = blue;   // error: be specific\n    Web_color webby = Web_color::blue;\n\nWe used an `enum class` to avoid name clashes.\n\n##### Note\n\nAlso consider `constexpr` and `const inline` variables.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nFlag macros that define integer values. Use `enum` or `const inline` or another non-macro alternative instead.\n\n\n### <a name=\"Renum-set\"></a>Enum.2: Use enumerations to represent sets of related named constants\n\n##### Reason\n\nAn enumeration shows the enumerators to be related and can be a named type.\n\n\n\n##### Example\n\n    enum class Web_color { red = 0xFF0000, green = 0x00FF00, blue = 0x0000FF };\n\n\n##### Note\n\nSwitching on an enumeration is common and the compiler can warn against unusual patterns of case labels. For example:\n\n    enum class Product_info { red = 0, purple = 1, blue = 2 };\n\n    void print(Product_info inf)\n    {\n        switch (inf) {\n        case Product_info::red: cout << \"red\"; break;\n        case Product_info::purple: cout << \"purple\"; break;\n        }\n    }\n\nSuch off-by-one `switch`-statements are often the results of an added enumerator and insufficient testing.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* Flag `switch`-statements where the `case`s cover most but not all enumerators of an enumeration.\n* Flag `switch`-statements where the `case`s cover a few enumerators of an enumeration, but there is no `default`.\n\n\n### <a name=\"Renum-class\"></a>Enum.3: Prefer class enums over \"plain\" enums\n\n##### Reason\n\nTo minimize surprises: traditional enums convert to int too readily.\n\n##### Example\n\n    void Print_color(int color);\n\n    enum Web_color { red = 0xFF0000, green = 0x00FF00, blue = 0x0000FF };\n    enum Product_info { red = 0, purple = 1, blue = 2 };\n\n    Web_color webby = Web_color::blue;\n\n    // Clearly at least one of these calls is buggy.\n    Print_color(webby);\n    Print_color(Product_info::blue);\n\nInstead use an `enum class`:\n\n    void Print_color(int color);\n\n    enum class Web_color { red = 0xFF0000, green = 0x00FF00, blue = 0x0000FF };\n    enum class Product_info { red = 0, purple = 1, blue = 2 };\n\n    Web_color webby = Web_color::blue;\n    Print_color(webby);  // Error: cannot convert Web_color to int.\n    Print_color(Product_info::red);  // Error: cannot convert Product_info to int.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n(Simple) Warn on any non-class `enum` definition.\n\n### <a name=\"Renum-oper\"></a>Enum.4: Define operations on enumerations for safe and simple use\n\n##### Reason\n\nConvenience of use and avoidance of errors.\n\n##### Example\n\n    enum class Day { mon, tue, wed, thu, fri, sat, sun };\n\n    Day& operator++(Day& d)\n    {\n        return d = (d == Day::sun) ? Day::mon : static_cast<Day>(static_cast<int>(d)+1);\n    }\n\n    Day today = Day::sat;\n    Day tomorrow = ++today;\n\nThe use of a `static_cast` is not pretty, but\n\n    Day& operator++(Day& d)\n    {\n        return d = (d == Day::sun) ? Day::mon : Day{++d};    // error\n    }\n\nis an infinite recursion, and writing it without a cast, using a `switch` on all cases is long-winded.\n\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nFlag repeated expressions cast back into an enumeration.\n\n\n### <a name=\"Renum-caps\"></a>Enum.5: Don't use `ALL_CAPS` for enumerators\n\n##### Reason\n\nAvoid clashes with macros.\n\n##### Example, bad\n\n     // webcolors.h (third party header)\n    #define RED   0xFF0000\n    #define GREEN 0x00FF00\n    #define BLUE  0x0000FF\n\n    // productinfo.h\n    // The following define product subtypes based on color\n\n    enum class Product_info { RED, PURPLE, BLUE };   // syntax error\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nFlag ALL_CAPS enumerators.\n\n### <a name=\"Renum-unnamed\"></a>Enum.6: Avoid unnamed enumerations\n\n##### Reason\n\nIf you can't name an enumeration, the values are not related\n\n##### Example, bad\n\n    enum { red = 0xFF0000, scale = 4, is_signed = 1 };\n\nSuch code is not uncommon in code written before there were convenient alternative ways of specifying integer constants.\n\n##### Alternative\n\nUse `constexpr` values instead. For example:\n\n    constexpr int red = 0xFF0000;\n    constexpr short scale = 4;\n    constexpr bool is_signed = true;\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nFlag unnamed enumerations.\n\n\n### <a name=\"Renum-underlying\"></a>Enum.7: Specify the underlying type of an enumeration only when necessary\n\n##### Reason\n\nThe default is the easiest to read and write.\n`int` is the default integer type.\n`int` is compatible with C `enum`s.\n\n##### Example\n\n    enum class Direction : char { n, s, e, w,\n                                  ne, nw, se, sw };  // underlying type saves space\n\n    enum class Web_color : int32_t { red   = 0xFF0000,\n                                     green = 0x00FF00,\n                                     blue  = 0x0000FF };  // underlying type is redundant\n\n##### Note\n\nSpecifying the underlying type is necessary to forward-declare an enum or enum class:\n\n    enum Flags : char;\n\n    void f(Flags);\n\n    // ....\n\n    enum Flags : char { /* ... */ };\n\nor to ensure that values of that type have a specified bit-precision:\n\n    enum Bitboard : uint64_t { /* ... */ };\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n????\n\n\n### <a name=\"Renum-value\"></a>Enum.8: Specify enumerator values only when necessary\n\n##### Reason\n\nIt's the simplest.\nIt avoids duplicate enumerator values.\nThe default gives a consecutive set of values that is good for `switch`-statement implementations.\n\n##### Example\n\n    enum class Col1 { red, yellow, blue };\n    enum class Col2 { red = 1, yellow = 2, blue = 2 }; // typo\n    enum class Month { jan = 1, feb, mar, apr, may, jun,\n                       jul, august, sep, oct, nov, dec }; // starting with 1 is conventional\n    enum class Base_flag { dec = 1, oct = dec << 1, hex = dec << 2 }; // set of bits\n\nSpecifying values is necessary to match conventional values (e.g., `Month`)\nand where consecutive values are undesirable (e.g., to get separate bits as in `Base_flag`).\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* Flag duplicate enumerator values\n* Flag explicitly specified all-consecutive enumerator values\n\n\n# <a name=\"S-resource\"></a>R: Resource management\n\nThis section contains rules related to resources.\nA resource is anything that must be acquired and (explicitly or implicitly) released, such as memory, file handles, sockets, and locks.\nThe reason it must be released is typically that it can be in short supply, so even delayed release might do harm.\nThe fundamental aim is to ensure that we don't leak any resources and that we don't hold a resource longer than we need to.\nAn entity that is responsible for releasing a resource is called an owner.\n\nThere are a few cases where leaks can be acceptable or even optimal:\nIf you are writing a program that simply produces an output based on an input and the amount of memory needed is proportional to the size of the input, the optimal strategy (for performance and ease of programming) is sometimes simply never to delete anything.\nIf you have enough memory to handle your largest input, leak away, but be sure to give a good error message if you are wrong.\nHere, we ignore such cases.\n\n* Resource management rule summary:\n\n  * [R.1: Manage resources automatically using resource handles and RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)](#Rr-raii)\n  * [R.2: In interfaces, use raw pointers to denote individual objects (only)](#Rr-use-ptr)\n  * [R.3: A raw pointer (a `T*`) is non-owning](#Rr-ptr)\n  * [R.4: A raw reference (a `T&`) is non-owning](#Rr-ref)\n  * [R.5:

automatically using resource handles and RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)\n\n##### Reason\n\nTo avoid leaks and the complexity of manual resource management.\nC++'s language-enforced constructor/destructor symmetry mirrors the symmetry inherent in resource acquire/release function pairs such as `fopen`/`fclose`, `lock`/`unlock`, and `new`/`delete`.\nWhenever you deal with a resource that needs paired acquire/release function calls, encapsulate that resource in an object that enforces pairing for you -- acquire the resource in its constructor, and release it in its destructor.\n\n##### Example, bad\n\nConsider:\n\n    void send(X* x, string_view destination)\n    {\n        auto port = open_port(destination);\n        my_mutex.lock();\n        // ...\n        send(port, x);\n        // ...\n        my_mutex.unlock();\n        close_port(port);\n        delete x;\n    }\n\nIn this code, you have to remember to `unlock`, `close_port`, and `delete` on all paths, and do each exactly once.\nFurther, if any of the code marked `...` throws an exception, then `x` is leaked and `my_mutex` remains locked.\n\n##### Example\n\nConsider:\n\n    void send(unique_ptr<X> x, string_view destination)  // x owns the X\n    {\n        Port port{destination};            // port owns the PortHandle\n        lock_guard<mutex> guard{my_mutex}; // guard owns the lock\n        // ...\n        send(port, x);\n        // ...\n    } // automatically unlocks my_mutex and deletes the pointer in x\n\nNow all resource cleanup is automatic, performed once on all paths whether or not there is an exception. As a bonus, the function now advertises that it takes over ownership of the pointer.\n\nWhat is `Port`? A handy wrapper that encapsulates the resource:\n\n    class Port {\n        PortHandle port;\n    public:\n        Port(string_view destination) : port{open_port(destination)} { }\n        ~Port() { close_port(port); }\n        operator PortHandle() { return port; }\n\n        // port handles can't usually be cloned, so disable copying and assignment if necessary\n        Port(const Port&) = delete;\n        Port& operator=(const Port&) = delete;\n    };\n\n##### Note\n\nWhere a resource is \"ill-behaved\" in that it isn't represented as a class with a destructor, wrap it in a class or use [`finally`](#Re-finally)\n\n**See also**: [RAII](#Re-raii)\n\n### <a name=\"Rr-use-ptr\"></a>R.2: In interfaces, use raw pointers to denote individual objects (only)\n\n##### Reason\n\nArrays are best represented by a container type (e.g., `vector` (owning)) or a `span` (non-owning).\nSuch containers and views hold sufficient information to do range checking.\n\n##### Example, bad\n\n    void f(int* p, int n)   // n is the number of elements in p[]\n    {\n        // ...\n        p[2] = 7;   // bad: subscript raw pointer\n        // ...\n    }\n\nThe compiler does not read comments, and without reading other code you do not know whether `p` really points to `n` elements.\nUse a `span` instead.\n\n##### Example\n\n    void g(int* p, int fmt)   // print *p using format #fmt\n    {\n        // ... uses *p and p[0] only ...\n    }\n\n##### Exception\n\nC-style strings are passed as single pointers to a zero-terminated sequence of characters.\nUse `zstring` rather than `char*` to indicate that you rely on that convention.\n\n##### Note\n\nMany current uses of pointers to a single element could be references.\nHowever, where `nullptr` is a possible value, a reference might not be a reasonable alternative.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* Flag pointer arithmetic (including `++`) on a pointer that is not part of a container, view, or iterator.\n  This rule would generate a huge number of false positives if applied to an older code base.\n* Flag array names passed as simple pointers\n\n### <a name=\"Rr-ptr\"></a>R.3: A raw pointer (a `T*`) is non-owning\n\n##### Reason\n\nThere is nothing (in the C++ standard or in most code) to say otherwise and most raw pointers are non-owning.\nWe want owning pointers identified so that we can reliably and efficiently delete the objects pointed to by owning pointers.\n\n##### Example\n\n    void f()\n    {\n        int* p1 = new int{7};           // bad: raw owning pointer\n        auto p2 = make_unique<int>(7);  // OK: the int is owned by a unique pointer\n        // ...\n    }\n\nThe `unique_ptr` protects against leaks by guaranteeing the deletion of its object (even in the presence of exceptions). The `T*` does not.\n\n##### Example\n\n    template<typename T>\n    class X {\n    public:\n        T* p;   // bad: it is unclear whether p is owning or not\n        T* q;   // bad: it is unclear whether q is owning or not\n        // ...\n    };\n\nWe can fix that problem by making ownership explicit:\n\n    template<typename T>\n    class X2 {\n    public:\n        owner<T*> p;  // OK: p is owning\n        T* q;         // OK: q is not owning\n        // ...\n    };\n\n##### Exception\n\nA major class of exception is legacy code, especially code that must remain compilable as C or interface with C and C-style C++ through ABIs.\nThe fact that there are billions of lines of code that violate this rule against owning `T*`s cannot be ignored.\nWe'd love to see program transformation tools turning 20-year-old \"legacy\" code into shiny modern code,\nwe encourage the development, deployment and use of such tools,\nwe hope the guidelines will help the development of such tools,\nand we even contributed (and contribute) to the research and development in this area.\nHowever, it will take time: \"legacy code\" is generated faster than we can renovate old code, and so it will be for a few years.\n\nThis code cannot all be rewritten (even assuming good code transformation software), especially not soon.\nThis problem cannot be solved (at scale) by transforming all owning pointers to `unique_ptr`s and `shared_ptr`s,\npartly because we need/use owning \"raw pointers\" as well as simple pointers in the implementation of our fundamental resource handles.\nFor example, common `vector` implementations have one owning pointer and two non-owning pointers.\nMany ABIs (and essentially all interfaces to C code) use `T*`s, some of them owning.\nSome interfaces cannot be simply annotated with `owner` because they need to remain compilable as C\n(although this would be a rare good use for a macro, that expands to `owner` in C++ mode only).\n\n##### Note\n\n`owner<T*>` has no default semantics beyond `T*`. It can be used without changing any code using it and without affecting ABIs.\nIt is simply an indicator to programmers and analysis tools.\nFor example, if an `owner<T*>` is a member of a class, that class better have a destructor that `delete`s it.\n\n##### Example, bad\n\nReturning a (raw) pointer imposes a lifetime management uncertainty on the caller; that is, who deletes the pointed-to object?\n\n    Gadget* make_gadget(int n)\n    {\n        auto p = new Gadget{n};\n        // ...\n        return p;\n    }\n\n    void caller(int n)\n    {\n        auto p = make_gadget(n);   // remember to delete p\n        // ...\n        delete p;\n    }\n\nIn addition to suffering from the problem of [leak](#Rp-leak), this adds a spurious allocation and deallocation operation, and is needlessly verbose. If Gadget is cheap to move out of a function (i.e., is small or has an efficient move operation), just return it \"by value\" (see [\"out\" return values](#Rf-out)):\n\n    Gadget make_gadget(int n)\n    {\n        Gadget g{n};\n        // ...\n        return g;\n    }\n\n##### Note\n\nThis rule applies to factory functions.\n\n##### Note\n\nIf pointer semantics are required (e.g., because the return type needs to refer to a base class of a class hierarchy (an interface)), return a \"smart pointer.\"\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* (Simple) Warn on `delete` of a raw pointer that is not an `owner<T>`.\n* (Moderate) Warn on failure to either `reset` or explicitly `delete` an `owner<T>` pointer on every code path.\n* (Simple) Warn if the return value of `new` is assigned to a raw pointer.\n* (Simple) Warn if a function returns an object that was allocated within the function but has a move constructor.\n  Suggest considering returning it by value instead.\n\n### <a name=\"Rr-ref\"></a>R.4: A raw reference (a `T&`) is non-owning\n\n##### Reason\n\nThere is nothing (in the C++ standard or in most code) to say otherwise and most raw references are non-owning.\nWe want owners identified so that we can reliably and efficiently delete the objects pointed to by owning pointers.\n\n##### Example\n\n    void f()\n    {\n        int& r = *new int{7};  // bad: raw owning reference\n        // ...\n        delete &r;             // bad: violated the rule against deleting raw pointers\n    }\n\n**See also**: [The raw pointer rule](#Rr-ptr)\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nSee [the raw pointer rule](#Rr-ptr)\n\n### <a name=\"Rr-scoped\"></a>R.5: Prefer scoped objects, don't heap-allocate unnecessarily\n\n##### Reason\n\nA scoped object is a local object, a global object, or a member.\nThis implies that there is no separate allocation and deallocation cost in excess of that already used for the containing scope or object.\nThe members of a scoped object are themselves scoped and the scoped object's constructor and destructor manage the members' lifetimes.\n\n##### Example\n\nThe following example is inefficient (because it has unnecessary allocation and deallocation), vulnerable to exception throws and returns in the `...` part (leading to leaks), and verbose:\n\n    void f(int n)\n    {\n        auto p = new Gadget{n};\n        // ...\n        delete p;\n    }\n\nInstead, use a local variable:\n\n    void f(int n)\n    {\n        Gadget g{n};\n        // ...\n    }\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* (Moderate) Warn if an object is allocated and then deallocated on all paths within a function.

Otherwise they should accept a `widget*`, if it can be `nullptr`. Otherwise, and ideally, the function should accept a `widget&`.\nThese smart pointers match the `Shared_pointer` concept, so these guideline enforcement rules work on them out of the box and expose this common pessimization.\n\n### <a name=\"Rr-uniqueptrparam\"></a>R.32: Take a `unique_ptr<widget>` parameter to express that a function assumes ownership of a `widget`\n\n##### Reason\n\nUsing `unique_ptr` in this way both documents and enforces the function call's ownership transfer.\n\n##### Example\n\n    void sink(unique_ptr<widget>); // takes ownership of the widget\n\n    void uses(widget*);            // just uses the widget\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* (Simple) Warn if a function takes a `Unique_pointer<T>` parameter by lvalue reference and does not either assign to it or call `reset()` on it on at least one code path.

  // good\n\na range version of `accumulate` would be even better:\n\n    auto sum = accumulate(v, 0.0); // better\n\nbut don't hand-code a well-known algorithm:\n\n    int max = v.size();   // bad: verbose, purpose unstated\n    double sum = 0.0;\n    for (int i = 0; i < max; ++i)\n        sum = sum + v[i];\n\n##### Exception\n\nLarge parts of the standard library rely on dynamic allocation (free store). These parts, notably the containers but not the algorithms, are unsuitable for some hard-real-time and embedded applications. In such cases, consider providing/using similar facilities, e.g.,  a standard-library-style container implemented using a pool allocator.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nNot easy. ??? Look for messy loops, nested loops, long functions, absence of function calls, lack of use of built-in types. Cyclomatic complexity?\n\n### <a name=\"Res-abstr\"></a>ES.2: Prefer suitable abstractions to direct use of language features\n\n##### Reason\n\nA \"suitable abstraction\" (e.g., library or class) is closer to the application concepts than the bare language, leads to shorter and clearer code, and is likely to be better tested.\n\n##### Example\n\n    vector<string> read1(istream& is)   // good\n    {\n        vector<string> res;\n        for (string s; is >> s;)\n            res.push_back(s);\n        return res;\n    }\n\nThe more traditional and lower-level near-equivalent is longer, messier, harder to get right, and most likely slower:\n\n    char** read2(istream& is, int maxelem, int maxstring, int* nread)   // bad: verbose and incomplete\n    {\n        auto res = new char*[maxelem];\n        int elemcount = 0;\n        while (is && elemcount < maxelem) {\n            auto s = new char[maxstring];\n            is.read(s, maxstring);\n            res[elemcount++] = s;\n        }\n        *nread = elemcount;\n        return res;\n    }\n\nOnce the checking for overflow and error handling has been added that code gets quite messy, and there is the problem remembering to `delete` the returned pointer and the C-style strings that array contains.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nNot easy. ??? Look for messy loops, nested loops, long functions, absence of function calls, lack of use of built-in types. Cyclomatic complexity?\n\n### <a name=\"Res-DRY\"></a>ES.3: Don't repeat yourself, avoid redundant code\n\nDuplicated or otherwise redundant code obscures intent, makes it harder to understand the logic, and makes maintenance harder, among other problems. It often arises from cut-and-paste programming.\n\nUse standard algorithms where appropriate, instead of writing some own implementation.\n\n**See also**: [SL.1](#Rsl-lib), [ES.11](#Res-auto)\n\n##### Example\n\n    void func(bool flag)    // Bad, duplicated code.\n    {\n        if (flag) {\n            x();\n            y();\n        }\n        else {\n            x();\n            z();\n        }\n    }\n\n    void func(bool flag)    // Better, no duplicated code.\n    {\n        x();\n\n        if (flag)\n            y();\n        else\n            z();\n    }\n\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* Use a static analyzer. It will catch at least some redundant constructs.\n* Code review\n\n## ES.dcl: Declarations\n\nA declaration is a statement. A declaration introduces a name into a scope and might cause the construction of a named object.\n\n### <a name=\"Res-scope\"></a>ES.5: Keep scopes small\n\n##### Reason\n\nReadability. Minimize resource retention. Avoid accidental misuse of value.\n\n**Alternative formulation**: Don't declare a name in an unnecessarily large scope.\n\n##### Example\n\n    void use()\n    {\n        int i;    // bad: i is needlessly accessible after loop\n        for (i = 0; i < 20; ++i) { /* ... */ }\n        // no intended use of i here\n        for (int i = 0; i < 20; ++i) { /* ... */ }  // good: i is local to for-loop\n\n        if (auto pc = dynamic_cast<Circle*>(ps)) {  // good: pc is local to if-statement\n            // ... deal with Circle ...\n        }\n        else {\n            // ... handle error ...\n        }\n    }\n\n##### Example, bad\n\n    void use(const string& name)\n    {\n        string fn = name + \".txt\";\n        ifstream is {fn};\n        Record r;\n        is >> r;\n        // ... 200 lines of code without intended use of fn or is ...\n    }\n\nThis function is by most measures too long anyway, but the point is that the resources used by `fn` and the file handle held by `is`\nare retained for much longer than needed and that unanticipated use of `is` and `fn` could happen later in the function.\nIn this case, it might be a good idea to factor out the read:\n\n    Record load_record(const string& name)\n    {\n        string fn = name + \".txt\";\n        ifstream is {fn};\n        Record r;\n        is >> r;\n        return r;\n    }\n\n    void use(const string& name)\n    {\n        Record r = load_record(name);\n        // ... 200 lines of code ...\n    }\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* Flag loop variable declared outside a loop and not used after the loop\n* Flag when expensive resources, such as file handles and locks are not used for N-lines (for some suitable N)\n\n### <a name=\"Res-cond\"></a>ES.6: Declare names in for-statement initializers and conditions to limit scope\n\n##### Reason\n\nReadability.\nLimit the loop variable visibility to the scope of the loop.\nAvoid using the loop variable for other purposes after the loop.\nMinimize resource retention.\n\n##### Example\n\n    void use()\n    {\n        for (string s; cin >> s;)\n            v.push_back(s);\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < 20; ++i) {   // good: i is local to for-loop\n            // ...\n        }\n\n        if (auto pc = dynamic_cast<Circle*>(ps)) {   // good: pc is local to if-statement\n            // ... deal with Circle ...\n        }\n        else {\n            // ... handle error ...\n        }\n    }\n\n##### Example, don't\n\n    int j;                            // BAD: j is visible outside the loop\n    for (j = 0; j < 100; ++j) {\n        // ...\n    }\n    // j is still visible here and isn't needed\n\n**See also**: [Don't use a variable for two unrelated purposes](#Res-recycle)\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* Warn when a variable modified inside the `for`-statement is declared outside the loop and not being used outside the loop.\n* (hard) Flag loop variables declared before the loop and used after the loop for an unrelated purpose.\n\n**Discussion**: Scoping the loop variable to the loop body also helps code optimizers greatly. Recognizing that the induction variable\nis only accessible in the loop body unblocks optimizations such as hoisting, strength reduction, loop-invariant code motion, etc.\n\n##### C++17 and C++20 example\n\nNote: C++17 and C++20 also add `if`, `switch`, and range-`for` initializer statements. These require C++17 and C++20 support.\n\n    map<int, string> mymap;\n\n    if (auto result = mymap.insert(value); result.second) {\n        // insert succeeded, and result is valid for this block\n        use(result.first);  // ok\n        // ...\n    } // result is destroyed here\n\n##### C++17 and C++20 enforcement (if using a C++17 or C++20 compiler)\n\n* Flag selection/loop variables declared before the body and not used after the body\n* (hard) Flag selection/loop variables declared before the body and used after the body for an unrelated purpose.\n\n### <a name=\"Res-name-length\"></a>ES.7: Keep common and local names short, and keep uncommon and non-local names longer\n\n##### Reason\n\nReadability. Lowering the chance of clashes between unrelated non-local names.\n\n##### Example\n\nConventional short, local names increase readability:\n\n    template<typename T>    // good\n    void print(ostream& os, const vector<T>& v)\n    {\n        for (gsl::index i = 0; i < v.size(); ++i)\n            os << v[i] << '\\n';\n    }\n\nAn index is conventionally called `i` and there is no hint about the meaning of the vector in this generic function, so `v` is as good name as any. Compare\n\n    template<typename Element_type>   // bad: verbose, hard to read\n    void print(ostream& target_stream, const vector<Element_type>& current_vector)\n    {\n        for (gsl::index current_element_index = 0;\n             current_element_index < current_vector.size();\n             ++current_element_index\n        )\n        target_stream << current_vector[current_element_index] << '\\n';\n    }\n\nYes, it is a caricature, but we have seen worse.\n\n##### Example\n\nUnconventional and short non-local names obscure code:\n\n    void use1(const string& s)\n    {\n        // ...\n        tt(s);   // bad: what is tt()?\n        // ...\n    }\n\nBetter, give non-local entities readable names:\n\n    void use1(const string& s)\n    {\n        // ...\n        trim_tail(s);   // better\n        // ...\n    }\n\nHere, there is a chance that the reader knows what `trim_tail` means and that the reader can remember it after looking it up.\n\n##### Example, bad\n\nArgument names of large functions are de facto non-local and should be meaningful:\n\n    void complicated_algorithm(vector<Record>& vr, const vector<int>& vi, map<string, int>& out)\n    // read from events in vr (marking used Records) for the indices in\n    // vi placing (name, index) pairs into out\n    {\n        // ... 500 lines of code using vr, vi, and out ...\n    }\n\nWe recommend keeping functions short, but that rule isn't universally adhered to and naming should reflect that.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nCheck length of local and non-local names. Also take function length into account.\n\n### <a name=\"Res-name-similar\"></a>ES.8: Avoid similar-looking names\n\n##### Reason\n\nCode clarity and readability. Too-similar names slow down comprehension and increase the likelihood of error.\n\n##### Example, bad\n\n    if (readable(i1 + l1 + ol + o1 + o0 + ol + o1 + I0 + l0)) surprise();\n\n##### Example, bad\n\nDo not declare a non-type with the same name as a type in the same scope. This removes the need to disambiguate with a keyword such as `struct` or `enum`. It also removes a source of errors, as `struct X` can implicitly declare `X` if lookup fails.\n\n    struct foo { int n; };\n    struct foo foo();       // BAD, foo is a type already in scope\n    struct foo x = foo();   // requires disambiguation\n\n##### Exception\n\nAntique header files might declare non-types and types with the same name in the same scope.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* Check names against a list of known confusing letter and digit combinations.\n* Flag a declaration of a variable, function, or enumerator that hides a class or enumeration declared in the same scope.\n\n### <a name=\"Res-not-CAPS\"></a>ES.9: Avoid `ALL_CAPS` names\n\n##### Reason\n\nSuch names are commonly used for macros. Thus, `ALL_CAPS` name are vulnerable to unintended macro substitution.\n\n##### Example\n\n    // somewhere in some header:\n    #define NE !=\n\n    // somewhere else in some other header:\n    enum Coord { N, NE, NW, S, SE, SW, E, W };\n\n    // somewhere third in some poor programmer's .cpp:\n    switch (direction) {\n    case N:\n        // ...\n    case NE:\n        // ...\n    // ...\n    }\n\n##### Note\n\nDo not use `ALL_CAPS` for constants just because constants used to be macros.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nFlag all uses of ALL CAPS. For older code, accept ALL CAPS for macro names and flag all non-ALL-CAPS macro names.\n\n### <a name=\"Res-name-one\"></a>ES.10: Declare one name (only) per declaration\n\n##### Reason\n\nOne declaration per line increases readability and avoids mistakes related to\nthe C/C++ grammar. It also leaves room for a more descriptive end-of-line\ncomment.\n\n##### Example, bad\n\n    char *p, c, a[7], *pp[7], **aa[10];   // yuck!\n\n##### Exception\n\nA function declaration can contain several function argument declarations.\n\n##### Exception\n\nA structured binding (C++17) is specifically designed to introduce several variables:\n\n    auto [iter, inserted] = m.insert_or_assign(k, val);\n    if (inserted) { /* new entry was inserted */ }\n\n##### Example\n\n    template<class InputIterator, class Predicate>\n    bool any_of(InputIterator first, InputIterator last, Predicate pred);\n\nor better using concepts:\n\n    bool any_of(input_iterator auto first, input_iterator auto last, predicate auto pred);\n\n##### Example\n\n    double scalbn(double x, int n);   // OK: x * pow(FLT_RADIX, n); FLT_RADIX is usually 2\n\nor:\n\n    double scalbn(    // better: x * pow(FLT_RADIX, n); FLT_RADIX is usually 2\n        double x,     // base value\n        int n         // exponent\n    );\n\nor:\n\n    // better: base * pow(FLT_RADIX, exponent); FLT_RADIX is usually 2\n    double scalbn(double base, int exponent);\n\n##### Example\n\n    int a = 10, b = 11, c = 12, d, e = 14, f = 15;\n\nIn a long list of declarators it is easy to overlook an uninitialized variable.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nFlag variable and constant declarations with multiple declarators (e.g., `int* p, q;`)\n\n### <a name=\"Res-auto\"></a>ES.11: Use `auto` to avoid redundant repetition of type names\n\n##### Reason\n\n* Simple repetition is tedious and error-prone.\n* When you use `auto`, the name of the declared entity is in a fixed position in the declaration, increasing readability.\n* In a function template declaration the return type can be a member type.\n\n##### Example\n\nConsider:\n\n    auto p = v.begin();      // vector<DataRecord>::iterator\n    auto z1 = v[3];          // makes copy of DataRecord\n    auto& z2 = v[3];         // avoids copy\n    const auto& z3 = v[3];   // const and avoids copy\n    auto h = t.future();\n    auto q = make_unique<int[]>(s);\n    auto f = [](int x) { return x + 10; };\n\nIn each case, we save writing a longish, hard-to-remember type that the compiler already knows but a programmer could get wrong.\n\n##### Example\n\n    template<class T>\n    auto Container<T>::first() -> Iterator;   // Container<T>::Iterator\n\n##### Exception\n\nAvoid `auto` for initializer lists and in cases where you know exactly which type you want and where an initializer might require conversion.\n\n##### Example\n\n    auto lst = { 1, 2, 3 };   // lst is an initializer list\n    auto x{1};   // x is an int (in C++17; initializer_list in C++11)\n\n##### Note\n\nAs of C++20, we can (and should) use concepts to be more specific about the type we are deducing:\n\n    // ...\n    forward_iterator auto p = algo(x, y, z);\n\n##### Example (C++17)\n\n    std::set<int> values;\n    // ...\n    auto [ position, newly_inserted ] = values.insert(5);   // break out the members of the std::pair\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nFlag redundant repetition of type names in a declaration.\n\n### <a name=\"Res-reuse\"></a>ES.12: Do not reuse names in nested scopes\n\n##### Reason\n\nIt is easy to get confused about which variable is used.\nCan cause maintenance problems.\n\n##### Example, bad\n\n    int d = 0;\n    // ...\n    if (cond) {\n        // ...\n        d = 9;\n        // ...\n    }\n    else {\n        // ...\n        int d = 7;\n        // ...\n        d = value_to_be_returned;\n        // ...\n    }\n\n    return d;\n\nIf this is a large `if`-statement, it is easy to overlook that a new `d` has been introduced in the inner scope.\nThis is a known source of bugs.\nSometimes such reuse of a name in an inner scope is called \"shadowing\".\n\n##### Note\n\nShadowing is primarily a problem when functions are too large and too complex.\n\n##### Example\n\nShadowing of function arguments in the outermost block is disallowed by the language:\n\n    void f(int x)\n    {\n        int x = 4;  // error: reuse of function argument name\n\n        if (x) {\n            int x = 7;  // allowed, but bad\n            // ...\n        }\n    }\n\n##### Example, bad\n\nReuse of a member name as a local variable can also be a problem:\n\n    struct S {\n        int m;\n        void f(int x);\n    };\n\n    void S::f(int x)\n    {\n        m = 7;    // assign to member\n        if (x) {\n            int m = 9;\n            // ...\n            m = 99; // assign to local variable\n            // ...\n        }\n    }\n\n##### Exception\n\nWe often reuse function names from a base class in a derived class:\n\n    struct B {\n        void f(int);\n    };\n\n    struct D : B {\n        void f(double);\n        using B::f;\n    };\n\nThis is error-prone.\nFor example, had we forgotten the using declaration, a call `d.f(1)` would not have found the `int` version of `f`.\n\n???

Also, `i` can be read in the `...` part. Better:\n\n    void use(int arg)   // OK\n    {\n        int i = 7;   // OK: initialized\n        string s;    // OK: default initialized\n        // ...\n    }\n\n##### Note\n\nThe *always initialize* rule is deliberately stronger than the *an object must be set before used* language rule.\nThe latter, more relaxed rule, catches the technical bugs, but:\n\n* It leads to less readable code\n* It encourages people to declare names in greater than necessary scopes\n* It leads to harder to read code\n* It leads to logic bugs by encouraging complex code\n* It hampers refactoring\n\nThe *always initialize* rule is a style rule aimed to improve maintainability as well as a rule protecting against used-before-set errors.\n\n##### Example\n\nHere is an example that is often considered to demonstrate the need for a more relaxed rule for initialization\n\n    widget i;    // \"widget\" a type that's expensive to initialize, possibly a large trivial type\n    widget j;\n\n    if (cond) {  // bad: i and j are initialized \"late\"\n        i = f1();\n        j = f2();\n    }\n    else {\n        i = f3();\n        j = f4();\n    }\n\nThis cannot trivially be rewritten to initialize `i` and `j` with initializers.\nNote that for types with a default constructor, attempting to postpone initialization simply leads to a default initialization followed by an assignment.\nA popular reason for such examples is \"efficiency\", but a compiler that can detect whether we made a used-before-set error can also eliminate any redundant double initialization.\n\nAssuming that there is a logical connection between `i` and `j`, that connection should probably be expressed in code:\n\n    pair<widget, widget> make_related_widgets(bool x)\n    {\n        return (x) ? {f1(), f2()} : {f3(), f4()};\n    }\n\n    auto [i, j] = make_related_widgets(cond);    // C++17\n\nIf the `make_related_widgets` function is otherwise redundant,\nwe can eliminate it by using a lambda [ES.28](#Res-lambda-init):\n\n    auto [i, j] = [x] { return (x) ? pair{f1(), f2()} : pair{f3(), f4()} }();    // C++17\n\nUsing a value representing \"uninitialized\" is a symptom of a problem and not a solution:\n\n    widget i = uninit;  // bad\n    widget j = uninit;\n\n    // ...\n    use(i);         // possibly used before set\n    // ...\n\n    if (cond) {     // bad: i and j are initialized \"late\"\n        i = f1();\n        j = f2();\n    }\n    else {\n        i = f3();\n        j = f4();\n    }\n\nNow the compiler cannot even simply detect a used-before-set. Further, we've introduced complexity in the state space for widget: which operations are valid on an `uninit` widget and which are not?\n\n##### Note\n\nComplex initialization has been popular with clever programmers for decades.\nIt has also been a major source of errors and complexity.\nMany such errors are introduced during maintenance years after the initial implementation.\n\n##### Example\n\nThis rule covers data members.\n\n    class X {\n    public:\n        X(int i, int ci) : m2{i}, cm2{ci} {}\n        // ...\n\n    private:\n        int m1 = 7;\n        int m2;\n        int m3;\n\n        const int cm1 = 7;\n        const int cm2;\n        const int cm3;\n    };\n\nThe compiler will flag the uninitialized `cm3` because it is a `const`, but it will not catch the lack of initialization of `m3`.\nUsually, a rare spurious member initialization is worth the absence of errors from lack of initialization and often an optimizer\ncan eliminate a redundant initialization (e.g., an initialization that occurs immediately before an assignment).\n\n##### Exception\n\nIf you are declaring an object that is just about to be initialized from input, initializing it would cause a double initialization.\nHowever, beware that this might leave uninitialized data beyond the input -- and that has been a fertile source of errors and security breaches:\n\n    constexpr int max = 8 * 1024;\n    int buf[max];         // OK, but suspicious: uninitialized\n    f.read(buf, max);\n\nThe cost of initializing that array could be significant in some situations.\nHowever, such examples do tend to leave uninitialized variables accessible, so they should be treated with suspicion.\n\n    constexpr int max = 8 * 1024;\n    int buf[max] = {};   // zero all elements; better in some situations\n    f.read(buf, max);\n\nBecause of the restrictive initialization rules for arrays and `std::array`, they offer the most compelling examples of the need for this exception.\n\nWhen feasible use a library function that is known not to overflow. For example:\n\n    string s;   // s is default initialized to \"\"\n    cin >> s;   // s expands to hold the string\n\nDon't consider simple variables that are targets for input operations exceptions to this rule:\n\n    int i;   // bad\n    // ...\n    cin >> i;\n\nIn the not uncommon case where the input target and the input operation get separated (as they should not) the possibility of used-before-set opens up.\n\n    int i2 = 0;   // better, assuming that zero is an acceptable value for i2\n    // ...\n    cin >> i2;\n\nA good optimizer should know about input operations and eliminate the redundant operation.\n\n\n##### Note\n\nSometimes, a lambda can be used as an initializer to avoid an uninitialized variable:\n\n    error_code ec;\n    Value v = [&] {\n        auto p = get_value();   // get_value() returns a pair<error_code, Value>\n        ec = p.first;\n        return p.second;\n    }();\n\nor maybe:\n\n    Value v = [] {\n        auto p = get_value();   // get_value() returns a pair<error_code, Value>\n        if (p.first) throw Bad_value{p.first};\n        return p.second;\n    }();\n\n**See also**: [ES.28](#Res-lambda-init)\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* Flag every uninitialized variable.\n  Don't flag variables of user-defined types with default constructors.\n* Check that an uninitialized buffer is written into *immediately* after declaration.\n  Passing an uninitialized variable as a reference to non-`const` argument can be assumed to be a write into the variable.\n\n### <a name=\"Res-introduce\"></a>ES.21: Don't introduce a variable (or constant) before you need to use it\n\n##### Reason\n\nReadability.

Limit the scope in which a variable can be used. Don't risk used-before-set. Initialization is often more efficient than assignment.\n\n##### Example, bad\n\n    string s;\n    // ... no use of s here ...\n    s = \"what a waste\";\n\n##### Example, bad\n\n    SomeLargeType var;  // Hard-to-read CaMeLcAsEvArIaBlE\n\n    if (cond)   // some non-trivial condition\n        Set(&var);\n    else if (cond2 || !cond3) {\n        var = Set2(3.14);\n    }\n    else {\n        var = 0;\n        for (auto& e : something)\n            var += e;\n    }\n\n    // use var; that this isn't done too early can be enforced statically with only control flow\n\nThis would be fine if there was a default initialization for `SomeLargeType` that wasn't too expensive.\nOtherwise, a programmer might very well wonder if every possible path through the maze of conditions has been covered.\nIf not, we have a \"use before set\" bug. This is a maintenance trap.\n\nFor initializers of moderate complexity, including for `const` variables, consider using a lambda to express the initializer; see [ES.28](#Res-lambda-init).\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* Flag declarations with default initialization that are assigned to before they are first read.\n* Flag any complicated computation after an uninitialized variable and before its use.\n\n### <a name=\"Res-list\"></a>ES.23: Prefer the `{}`-initializer syntax\n\n##### Reason\n\nPrefer `{}`. The rules for `{}` initialization are simpler, more general, less ambiguous, and safer than for other forms of initialization.\n\nUse `=` only when you are sure that there can be no narrowing conversions. For built-in arithmetic types, use `=` only with `auto`.\n\nAvoid `()` initialization, which allows parsing ambiguities.\n\n##### Example\n\n    int x {f(99)};\n    int y = x;\n    vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};\n\n##### Exception\n\nFor containers, there is a tradition for using `{...}` for a list of elements and `(...)` for sizes:\n\n    vector<int> v1(10);    // vector of 10 elements with the default value 0\n    vector<int> v2{10};    // vector of 1 element with the value 10\n\n    vector<int> v3(1, 2);  // vector of 1 element with the value 2\n    vector<int> v4{1, 2};  // vector of 2 elements with the values 1 and 2\n\n##### Note\n\n`{}`-initializers do not allow narrowing conversions (and that is usually a good thing) and allow explicit constructors (which is fine, we're intentionally initializing a new variable).\n\n##### Example\n\n    int x {7.9};   // error: narrowing\n    int y = 7.9;   // OK: y becomes 7. Hope for a compiler warning\n    int z {gsl::narrow_cast<int>(7.9)};    // OK: you asked for it\n    auto zz = gsl::narrow_cast<int>(7.9);  // OK: you asked for it\n\n##### Note\n\n`{}` initialization can be used for nearly all initialization; other forms of initialization can't:\n\n    auto p = new vector<int> {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};   // initialized vector\n    D::D(int a, int b) :m{a, b} {   // member initializer (e.g., m might be a pair)\n        // ...\n    };\n    X var {};   // initialize var to be empty\n    struct S {\n        int m {7};   // default initializer for a member\n        // ...\n    };\n\nFor that reason, `{}`-initialization is often called \"uniform initialization\"\n(though there unfortunately are a few irregularities left).\n\n##### Note\n\nInitialization of a variable declared using `auto` with a single value, e.g., `{v}`, had surprising results until C++17.\nThe C++17 rules are somewhat less surprising:\n\n    auto x1 {7};        // x1 is an int with the value 7\n    auto x2 = {7};      // x2 is an initializer_list<int> with an element 7\n\n    auto x11 {7, 8};    // error: two initializers\n    auto x22 = {7, 8};  // x22 is an initializer_list<int> with elements 7 and 8\n\nUse `={...}` if you really want an `initializer_list<T>`\n\n    auto fib10 = {1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55};   // fib10 is a list\n\n##### Note\n\n`={}` gives copy initialization whereas `{}` gives direct initialization.\nLike the distinction between copy-initialization and direct-initialization itself, this can lead to surprises.\n`{}` accepts `explicit` constructors; `={}` does not. For example:\n\n    struct Z { explicit Z() {} };\n\n    Z z1{};     // OK: direct initialization, so we use explicit constructor\n    Z z2 = {};  // error: copy initialization, so we cannot use the explicit constructor\n\nUse plain `{}`-initialization unless you specifically want to disable explicit constructors.\n\n##### Example\n\n    template<typename T>\n    void f()\n    {\n        T x1(1);    // T initialized with 1\n        T x0();     // bad: function declaration (often a mistake)\n\n        T y1 {1};   // T initialized with 1\n        T y0 {};    // default initialized T\n        // ...\n    }\n\n**See also**: [Discussion](#???)\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* Flag uses of `=` to initialize arithmetic types where narrowing occurs.\n* Flag uses of `()` initialization syntax that are actually declarations. (Many compilers should warn on this already.)\n\n### <a name=\"Res-unique\"></a>ES.24: Use a `unique_ptr<T>` to hold pointers\n\n##### Reason\n\nUsing `std::unique_ptr` is the simplest way to avoid leaks. It is reliable, it\nmakes the type system do much of the work to validate ownership safety, it\nincreases readability, and it has zero or near zero run-time cost.\n\n##### Example\n\n    void use(bool leak)\n    {\n        auto p1 = make_unique<int>(7);   // OK\n        int* p2 = new int{7};            // bad: might leak\n        // ... no assignment to p2 ...\n        if (leak) return;\n        // ... no assignment to p2 ...\n        vector<int> v(7);\n        v.at(7) = 0;                    // exception thrown\n        delete p2;                      // too late to prevent leaks\n        // ...\n    }\n\nIf `leak == true` the object pointed to by `p2` is leaked and the object pointed to by `p1` is not.\nThe same is the case when `at()` throws. In both cases, the `delete p2` statement is not reached.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nLook for raw pointers that are targets of `new`, `malloc()`, or functions that might return such pointers.\n\n### <a name=\"Res-const\"></a>ES.25: Declare an object `const` or `constexpr` unless you want to modify its value later on\n\n##### Reason\n\nThat way you can't change the value by mistake. That way might offer the compiler optimization opportunities.\n\n##### Example\n\n    void f(int n)\n    {\n        const int bufmax = 2 * n + 2;  // good: we can't change bufmax by accident\n        int xmax = n;                  // suspicious: is xmax intended to change?\n        // ...\n    }\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nLook to see if a variable is actually mutated, and flag it if\nnot. Unfortunately, it might be impossible to detect when a non-`const` was not\n*intended* to vary (vs when it merely did not vary).\n\n### <a name=\"Res-recycle\"></a>ES.26: Don't use a variable for two unrelated purposes\n\n##### Reason\n\nReadability and safety.\n\n##### Example, bad\n\n    void use()\n    {\n        int i;\n        for (i = 0; i < 20; ++i) { /* ... */ }\n        for (i = 0; i < 200; ++i) { /* ... */ } // bad: i recycled\n    }\n\n##### Note\n\nAs an optimization, you might want to reuse a buffer as a scratch pad, but even then prefer to limit the variable's scope as much as possible and be careful not to cause bugs from data left in a recycled buffer as this is a common source of security bugs.\n\n    void write_to_file()\n    {\n        std::string buffer;             // to avoid reallocations on every loop iteration\n        for (auto& o : objects) {\n            // First part of the work.\n            generate_first_string(buffer, o);\n            write_to_file(buffer);\n\n            // Second part of the work.\n            generate_second_string(buffer, o);\n            write_to_file(buffer);\n\n            // etc...\n        }\n    }\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nFlag recycled variables.\n\n### <a name=\"Res-stack\"></a>ES.27: Use `std::array` or `stack_array` for arrays on the stack\n\n##### Reason\n\nThey are readable and don't implicitly convert to pointers.\nThey are not confused with non-standard extensions of built-in arrays.\n\n##### Example, bad\n\n    const int n = 7;\n    int m = 9;\n\n    void f()\n    {\n        int a1[n];\n        int a2[m];   // error: not ISO C++\n        // ...\n    }\n\n##### Note\n\nThe definition of `a1` is legal C++ and has always been.\nThere is a lot of such code.\nIt is error-prone, though, especially when the bound is non-local.\nAlso, it is a \"popular\" source of errors (buffer overflow, pointers from array decay, etc.).\nThe definition of `a2` is C but not C++ and is considered a security risk\n\n##### Example\n\n    const int n = 7;\n    int m = 9;\n\n    void f()\n    {\n        array<int, n> a1;\n        stack_array<int> a2(m);\n        // ...\n    }\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* Flag arrays with non-constant bounds (C-style VLAs)\n* Flag arrays with non-local constant bounds\n\n### <a name=\"Res-lambda-init\"></a>ES.28: Use lambdas for complex initialization, especially of `const` variables\n\n##### Reason\n\nIt nicely encapsulates local initialization, including cleaning up scratch variables needed only for the initialization, without needing to create a needless non-local yet non-reusable function. It also works for variables that should be `const` but only after some initialization work.\n\n##### Example, bad\n\n    widget x;   // should be const, but:\n    for (auto i = 2; i <= N; ++i) {          // this could be some\n        x += some_obj.do_something_with(i);  // arbitrarily long code\n    }                                        // needed to initialize x\n    // from here, x should be const, but we can't say so in code in this style\n\n##### Example, good\n\n    const widget x = [&] {\n        widget val;                                // assume that widget has a default constructor\n        for (auto i = 2; i <= N; ++i) {            // this could be some\n            val += some_obj.do_something_with(i);  // arbitrarily long code\n        }                                          // needed to initialize x\n        return val;\n    }();\n\nIf at all possible, reduce the conditions to a simple set of alternatives (e.g., an `enum`) and don't mix up selection and initialization.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nHard.

For example:\n\n    enum E { a, b };\n\n    template<int x>\n    constexpr const char* stringify()\n    {\n        switch (x) {\n        case a: return \"a\";\n        case b: return \"b\";\n        }\n    }\n\n    void f()\n    {\n        string s1 = stringify<a>();\n        string s2 = stringify<b>();\n        // ...\n    }\n\nThis is not as convenient as a macro to define, but as easy to use, has zero overhead, and is typed and scoped.\n\nIn the future, static reflection is likely to eliminate the last needs for the preprocessor for program text manipulation.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nScream when you see a macro that isn't just used for source control (e.g., `#ifdef`)\n\n### <a name=\"Res-macros2\"></a>ES.31: Don't use macros for constants or \"functions\"\n\n##### Reason\n\nMacros are a major source of bugs.\nMacros don't obey the usual scope and type rules.\nMacros don't obey the usual rules for argument passing.\nMacros ensure that the human reader sees something different from what the compiler sees.\nMacros complicate tool building.\n\n##### Example, bad\n\n    #define PI 3.14\n    #define SQUARE(a, b) (a * b)\n\nEven if we hadn't left a well-known bug in `SQUARE` there are much better behaved alternatives; for example:\n\n    constexpr double pi = 3.14;\n    template<typename T> T square(T a, T b) { return a * b; }\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nScream when you see a macro that isn't just used for source control (e.g., `#ifdef`)\n\n### <a name=\"Res-ALL_CAPS\"></a>ES.32: Use `ALL_CAPS` for all macro names\n\n##### Reason\n\nConvention.

Portability.\nEven if it does something sensible for you, it might do something different on another compiler (e.g., the next release of your compiler) or with a different optimizer setting.\n\n##### Note\n\nC++17 tightens up the rules for the order of evaluation:\nleft-to-right except right-to-left in assignments, and the order of evaluation of function arguments is unspecified.\n\nHowever, remember that your code might be compiled with a pre-C++17 compiler (e.g., through cut-and-paste) so don't be too clever.\n\n##### Example\n\n    v[i] = ++i;   //  the result is undefined\n\nA good rule of thumb is that you should not read a value twice in an expression where you write to it.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nCan be detected by a good analyzer.\n\n### <a name=\"Res-order-fct\"></a>ES.44: Don't depend on order of evaluation of function arguments\n\n##### Reason\n\nBecause that order is unspecified.\n\n##### Note\n\nC++17 tightens up the rules for the order of evaluation, but the order of evaluation of function arguments is still unspecified.\n\n##### Example\n\n    int i = 0;\n    f(++i, ++i);\n\nBefore C++17, the behavior is undefined, so the behavior could be anything (e.g., `f(2, 2)`).\nSince C++17, this code does not have undefined behavior, but it is still not specified which argument is evaluated first. The call will be `f(1, 2)` or `f(2, 1)`, but you don't know which.\n\n##### Example\n\nOverloaded operators can lead to order of evaluation problems:\n\n    f1()->m(f2());          // m(f1(), f2())\n    cout << f1() << f2();   // operator<<(operator<<(cout, f1()), f2())\n\nIn C++17, these examples work as expected (left to right) and assignments are evaluated right to left (just as ='s binding is right-to-left)\n\n    f1() = f2();    // undefined behavior in C++14; in C++17, f2() is evaluated before f1()\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nCan be detected by a good analyzer.\n\n### <a name=\"Res-magic\"></a>ES.45: Avoid \"magic constants\"; use symbolic constants\n\n##### Reason\n\nUnnamed constants embedded in expressions are easily overlooked and often hard to understand:\n\n##### Example\n\n    for (int m = 1; m <= 12; ++m)   // don't: magic constant 12\n        cout << month[m] << '\\n';\n\nNo, we don't all know that there are 12 months, numbered 1..12, in a year. Better:\n\n    // months are indexed 1..12\n    constexpr int first_month = 1;\n    constexpr int last_month = 12;\n\n    for (int m = first_month; m <= last_month; ++m)   // better\n        cout << month[m] << '\\n';\n\nBetter still, don't expose constants:\n\n    for (auto m : month)\n        cout << m << '\\n';\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nFlag literals in code. Give a pass to `0`, `1`, `nullptr`, `\\n`, `\"\"`, and others on a positive list.\n\n### <a name=\"Res-narrowing\"></a>ES.46: Avoid lossy (narrowing, truncating) arithmetic conversions\n\n##### Reason\n\nA narrowing conversion destroys information, often unexpectedly so.\n\n##### Example, bad\n\nA key example is basic narrowing:\n\n    double d = 7.9;\n    int i = d;    // bad: narrowing: i becomes 7\n    i = (int) d;  // bad: we're going to claim this is still not explicit enough\n\n    void f(int x, long y, double d)\n    {\n        char c1 = x;   // bad: narrowing\n        char c2 = y;   // bad: narrowing\n        char c3 = d;   // bad: narrowing\n    }\n\n##### Note\n\nThe guidelines support library offers a `narrow_cast` operation for specifying that narrowing is acceptable and a `narrow` (\"narrow if\") that throws an exception if a narrowing would throw away legal values:\n\n    i = gsl::narrow_cast<int>(d);   // OK (you asked for it): narrowing: i becomes 7\n    i = gsl::narrow<int>(d);        // OK: throws narrowing_error\n\nWe also include lossy arithmetic casts, such as from a negative floating point type to an unsigned integral type:\n\n    double d = -7.9;\n    unsigned u = 0;\n\n    u = d;                               // bad: narrowing\n    u = gsl::narrow_cast<unsigned>(d);   // OK (you asked for it): u becomes 4294967289\n    u = gsl::narrow<unsigned>(d);        // OK: throws narrowing_error\n\n##### Note\n\nThis rule does not apply to [contextual conversions to bool](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/implicit_conversion#Contextual_conversions):\n\n    if (ptr) do_something(*ptr);   // OK: ptr is used as a condition\n    bool b = ptr;                  // bad: narrowing\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nA good analyzer can detect all narrowing conversions. However, flagging all narrowing conversions will lead to a lot of false positives. Suggestions:\n\n* Flag all floating-point to integer conversions (maybe only `float`->`char` and `double`->`int`. Here be dragons! we need data).\n* Flag all `long`->`char` (I suspect `int`->`char` is very common. Here be dragons! we need data).\n* Consider narrowing conversions for function arguments especially suspect.\n\n### <a name=\"Res-nullptr\"></a>ES.47: Use `nullptr` rather than `0` or `NULL`\n\n##### Reason\n\nReadability. Minimize surprises: `nullptr` cannot be confused with an\n`int`. `nullptr` also has a well-specified (very restrictive) type, and thus\nworks in more scenarios where type deduction might do the wrong thing on `NULL`\nor `0`.\n\n##### Example\n\nConsider:\n\n    void f(int);\n    void f(char*);\n    f(0);         // call f(int)\n    f(nullptr);   // call f(char*)\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nFlag uses of `0` and `NULL` for pointers. The transformation might be helped by simple program transformation.\n\n### <a name=\"Res-casts\"></a>ES.48: Avoid casts\n\n##### Reason\n\nCasts are a well-known source of errors and make some optimizations unreliable.\n\n##### Example, bad\n\n    double d = 2;\n    auto p = (long*)&d;\n    auto q = (long long*)&d;\n    cout << d << ' ' << *p << ' ' << *q << '\\n';\n\nWhat would you think this fragment prints? The result is at best implementation defined. I got\n\n    2 0 4611686018427387904\n\nAdding\n\n    *q = 666;\n    cout << d << ' ' << *p << ' ' << *q << '\\n';\n\nI got\n\n    3.29048e-321 666 666\n\nSurprised? I'm just glad I didn't crash the program.\n\n##### Note\n\nProgrammers who write casts typically assume that they know what they are doing,\nor that writing a cast makes the program \"easier to read\".\nIn fact, they often disable the general rules for using values.\nOverload resolution and template instantiation usually pick the right function if there is a right function to pick.\nIf there is not, maybe there ought to be, rather than applying a local fix (cast).\n\n##### Notes\n\nCasts are necessary in a systems programming language.  For example, how else\nwould we get the address of a device register into a pointer?  However, casts\nare seriously overused as well as a major source of errors.\n\nIf you feel the need for a lot of casts, there might be a fundamental design problem.\n\nThe [type profile](#Pro-type-reinterpretcast) bans `reinterpret_cast` and C-style casts.\n\nNever cast to `(void)` to ignore a `[[nodiscard]]`return value.\nIf you deliberately want to discard such a result, first think hard about whether that is really a good idea (there is usually a good reason the author of the function or of the return type used `[[nodiscard]]` in the first place).\nIf you still think it's appropriate and your code reviewer agrees, use `std::ignore =` to turn off the warning which is simple, portable, and easy to grep.\n\n##### Alternatives\n\nCasts are widely (mis)used. Modern C++ has rules and constructs that eliminate the need for casts in many contexts, such as\n\n* Use templates\n* Use `std::variant`\n* Rely on the well-defined, safe, implicit conversions between pointer types\n* Use `std::ignore =` to ignore `[[nodiscard]]` values.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* Flag all C-style casts, including to `void`.\n* Flag functional style casts using `Type(value)`. Use `Type{value}` instead which is not narrowing. (See [ES.64](#Res-construct).)\n* Flag [identity casts](#Pro-type-identitycast) between pointer types, where the source and target types are the same (#Pro-type-identitycast).\n* Flag an explicit pointer cast that could be [implicit](#Pro-type-implicitpointercast).\n\n### <a name=\"Res-casts-named\"></a>ES.49: If you must use a cast, use a named cast\n\n##### Reason\n\nReadability. Error avoidance.\nNamed casts are more specific than a C-style or functional cast, allowing the compiler to catch some errors.\n\nThe named casts are:\n\n* `static_cast`\n* `const_cast`\n* `reinterpret_cast`\n* `dynamic_cast`\n* `std::move`         // `move(x)` is an rvalue reference to `x`\n* `std::forward`      // `forward<T>(x)` is an rvalue or an lvalue reference to `x` depending on `T`\n* `gsl::narrow_cast`  // `narrow_cast<T>(x)` is `static_cast<T>(x)`\n* `gsl::narrow`       // `narrow<T>(x)` is `static_cast<T>(x)` if `static_cast<T>(x) == x` or it throws `narrowing_error`\n\n##### Example\n\n    class B { /* ... */ };\n    class D { /* ... */ };\n\n    template<typename D> D* upcast(B* pb)\n    {\n        D* pd0 = pb;                        // error: no implicit conversion from B* to D*\n        D* pd1 = (D*)pb;                    // legal, but what is done?\n        D* pd2 = static_cast<D*>(pb);       // error: D is not derived from B\n        D* pd3 = reinterpret_cast<D*>(pb);  // OK: on your head be it!\n        D* pd4 = dynamic_cast<D*>(pb);      // OK: return nullptr\n        // ...\n    }\n\nThe example was synthesized from real-world bugs where `D` used to be derived from `B`, but someone refactored the hierarchy.\nThe C-style cast is dangerous because it can do any kind of conversion, depriving us of any protection from mistakes (now or in the future).\n\n##### Note\n\nWhen converting between types with no information loss (e.g. from `float` to\n`double` or from `int32` to `int64`), brace initialization might be used instead.\n\n    double d {some_float};\n    int64_t i {some_int32};\n\nThis makes it clear that the type conversion was intended and also prevents\nconversions between types that might result in loss of precision. (It is a\ncompilation error to try to initialize a `float` from a `double` in this fashion,\nfor example.)\n\n##### Note\n\n`reinterpret_cast` can be essential, but the essential uses (e.g., turning a machine address into pointer) are not type safe:\n\n    auto p = reinterpret_cast<Device_register>(0x800);  // inherently dangerous\n\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* Flag all C-style casts, including to `void`.\n* Flag functional style casts using `Type(value)`. Use `Type{value}` instead which is not narrowing. (See [ES.64](#Res-construct).)\n* The [type profile](#Pro-type-reinterpretcast) bans `reinterpret_cast`.\n* The [type profile](#Pro-type-arithmeticcast) warns when using `static_cast` between arithmetic types.\n\n### <a name=\"Res-casts-const\"></a>ES.50: Don't cast away `const`\n\n##### Reason\n\nIt makes a lie out of `const`.\nIf the variable is actually declared `const`, modifying it results in undefined behavior.\n\n##### Example, bad\n\n    void f(const int& x)\n    {\n        const_cast<int&>(x) = 42;   // BAD\n    }\n\n    static int i = 0;\n    static const int j = 0;\n\n    f(i); // silent side effect\n    f(j); // undefined behavior\n\n##### Example\n\nSometimes, you might be tempted to resort to `const_cast` to avoid code duplication, such as when two accessor functions that differ only in `const`-ness have similar implementations. For example:\n\n    class Bar;\n\n    class Foo {\n    public:\n        // BAD, duplicates logic\n        Bar& get_bar()\n        {\n            /* complex logic around getting a non-const reference to my_bar */\n        }\n\n        const Bar& get_bar() const\n        {\n            /* same complex logic around getting a const reference to my_bar */\n        }\n    private:\n        Bar my_bar;\n    };\n\nInstead, prefer to share implementations. Normally, you can just have the non-`const` function call the `const` function. However, when there is complex logic this can lead to the following pattern that still resorts to a `const_cast`:\n\n    class Foo {\n    public:\n        // not great, non-const calls const version but resorts to const_cast\n        Bar& get_bar()\n        {\n            return const_cast<Bar&>(static_cast<const Foo&>(*this).get_bar());\n        }\n        const Bar& get_bar() const\n        {\n            /* the complex logic around getting a const reference to my_bar */\n        }\n    private:\n        Bar my_bar;\n    };\n\nAlthough this pattern is safe when applied correctly, because the caller must have had a non-`const` object to begin with, it's not ideal because the safety is hard to enforce automatically as a checker rule.\n\nInstead, prefer to put the common code in a common helper function -- and make it a template so that it deduces `const`. This doesn't use any `const_cast` at all:\n\n    class Foo {\n    public:                         // good\n              Bar& get_bar()       { return get_bar_impl(*this); }\n        const Bar& get_bar() const { return get_bar_impl(*this); }\n    private:\n        Bar my_bar;\n\n        template<class T>           // good, deduces whether T is const or non-const\n        static auto& get_bar_impl(T& t)\n            { /* the complex logic around getting a possibly-const reference to my_bar */ }\n    };\n\nNote: Don't do large non-dependent work inside a template, which leads to code bloat. For example, a further improvement would be if all or part of `get_bar_impl` can be non-dependent and factored out into a common non-template function, for a potentially big reduction in code size.\n\n##### Exception\n\nYou might need to cast away `const` when calling `const`-incorrect functions.\nPrefer to wrap such functions in inline `const`-correct wrappers to encapsulate the cast in one place.\n\n##### Example\n\nSometimes, \"cast away `const`\" is to allow the updating of some transient information of an otherwise immutable object.\nExamples are caching, memoization, and precomputation.\nSuch examples are often handled as well or better using `mutable` or an indirection than with a `const_cast`.\n\nConsider keeping previously computed results around for a costly operation:\n\n    int compute(int x); // compute a value for x; assume this to be costly\n\n    class Cache {   // some type implementing a cache for an int->int operation\n    public:\n        pair<bool, int> find(int x) const;   // is there a value for x?\n        void set(int x, int v);             // make y the value for x\n        // ...\n    private:\n        // ...\n    };\n\n    class X {\n    public:\n        int get_val(int x)\n        {\n            auto p = cache.find(x);\n            if (p.first) return p.second;\n            int val = compute(x);\n            cache.set(x, val); // insert value for x\n            return val;\n        }\n        // ...\n    private:\n        Cache cache;\n    };\n\nHere, `get_val()` is logically constant, so we would like to make it a `const` member.\nTo do this we still need to mutate `cache`, so people sometimes resort to a `const_cast`:\n\n    class X {   // Suspicious solution based on casting\n    public:\n        int get_val(int x) const\n        {\n            auto p = cache.find(x);\n            if (p.first) return p.second;\n            int val = compute(x);\n            const_cast<Cache&>(cache).set(x, val);   // ugly\n            return val;\n        }\n        // ...\n    private:\n        Cache cache;\n    };\n\nFortunately, there is a better solution:\nState that `cache` is mutable even for a `const` object:\n\n    class X {   // better solution\n    public:\n        int get_val(int x) const\n        {\n            auto p = cache.find(x);\n            if (p.first) return p.second;\n            int val = compute(x);\n            cache.set(x, val);\n            return val;\n        }\n        // ...\n    private:\n        mutable Cache cache;\n    };\n\nAn alternative solution would be to store a pointer to the `cache`:\n\n    class X {   // OK, but slightly messier solution\n    public:\n        int get_val(int x) const\n        {\n            auto p = cache->find(x);\n            if (p.first) return p.second;\n            int val = compute(x);\n            cache->set(x, val);\n            return val;\n        }\n        // ...\n    private:\n        unique_ptr<Cache> cache;\n    };\n\nThat solution is the most flexible, but requires explicit construction and destruction of `*cache`\n(most likely in the constructor and destructor of `X`).\n\nIn any variant, we must guard against data races on the `cache` in multi-threaded code, possibly using a `std::mutex`.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* Flag `const_cast`s.\n* This rule is part of the [type-safety profile](#Pro-type-constcast) for the related Profile.\n\n### <a name=\"Res-range-checking\"></a>ES.55: Avoid the need for range checking\n\n##### Reason\n\nConstructs that cannot overflow do not overflow (and usually run faster):\n\n##### Example\n\n    for (auto& x : v)      // print all elements of v\n        cout << x << '\\n';\n\n    auto p = find(v, x);   // find x in v\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nLook for explicit range checks and heuristically suggest alternatives.\n\n### <a name=\"Res-move\"></a>ES.56: Write `std::move()` only when you need to explicitly move an object to another scope\n\n##### Reason\n\nWe move, rather than copy, to avoid duplication and for improved performance.\n\nA move typically leaves behind an empty object ([C.64](#Rc-move-semantic)), which can be surprising or even dangerous, so we try to avoid moving from lvalues (they might be accessed later).\n\n##### Notes\n\nMoving is done implicitly when the source is an rvalue (e.g., value in a `return` treatment or a function result), so don't pointlessly complicate code in those cases by writing `move` explicitly. Instead, write short functions that return values, and both the function's return and the caller's accepting of the return will be optimized naturally.\n\nIn general, following the guidelines in this document (including not making variables' scopes needlessly large, writing short functions that return values, returning local variables) help eliminate most need for explicit `std::move`.\n\nExplicit `move` is needed to explicitly move an object to another scope, notably to pass it to a \"sink\" function and in the implementations of the move operations themselves (move constructor, move assignment operator) and swap operations.\n\n##### Example, bad\n\n    void sink(X&& x);   // sink takes ownership of x\n\n    void user()\n    {\n        X x;\n        // error: cannot bind an lvalue to a rvalue reference\n        sink(x);\n        // OK: sink takes the contents of x, x must now be assumed to be empty\n        sink(std::move(x));\n\n        // ...\n\n        // probably a mistake\n        use(x);\n    }\n\nUsually, a `std::move()` is used as an argument to a `&&` parameter.\nAnd after you do that, assume the object has been moved from (see [C.64](#Rc-move-semantic)) and don't read its state again until you first set it to a new value.\n\n    void f()\n    {\n        string s1 = \"supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\";\n\n        string s2 = s1;             // ok, takes a copy\n        assert(s1 == \"supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\");  // ok\n\n        // bad, if you want to keep using s1's value\n        string s3 = move(s1);\n\n        // bad, assert will likely fail, s1 likely changed\n        assert(s1 == \"supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\");\n    }\n\n##### Example\n\n    void sink(unique_ptr<widget> p);  // pass ownership of p to sink()\n\n    void f()\n    {\n        auto w = make_unique<widget>();\n        // ...\n        sink(std::move(w));               // ok, give to sink()\n        // ...\n        sink(w);    // Error: unique_ptr is carefully designed so that you cannot copy it\n    }\n\n##### Notes\n\n`std::move()` is a cast to `&&` in disguise; it doesn't itself move anything, but marks a named object as a candidate that can be moved from.\nThe language already knows the common cases where objects can be moved from, especially when returning values from functions, so don't complicate code with redundant `std::move()`'s.\n\nNever write `std::move()` just because you've heard \"it's more efficient.\"\nIn general, don't believe claims of \"efficiency\" without data (???).\nIn general, don't complicate your code without reason (??).\nNever write `std::move()` on a const object, it is silently transformed into a copy (see Item 23 in [Meyers15](#Meyers15))\n\n##### Example, bad\n\n    vector<int> make_vector()\n    {\n        vector<int> result;\n        // ... load result with data\n        return std::move(result);       // bad; just write \"return result;\"\n    }\n\nNever write `return move(local_variable);`, because the language already knows the variable is a move candidate.\nWriting `move` in this code won't help, and can actually be detrimental because on some compilers it interferes with RVO (the return value optimization) by creating an additional reference alias to the local variable.\n\n\n##### Example, bad\n\n    vector<int> v = std::move(make_vector());   // bad; the std::move is entirely redundant\n\nNever write `move` on a returned value such as `x = move(f());` where `f` returns by value.\nThe language already knows that a returned value is a temporary object that can be moved from.\n\n##### Example\n\n    void mover(X&& x)\n    {\n        call_something(std::move(x));         // ok\n        call_something(std::forward<X>(x));   // bad, don't std::forward an rvalue reference\n        call_something(x);                    // suspicious, why not std::move?\n    }\n\n    template<class T>\n    void forwarder(T&& t)\n    {\n        call_something(std::move(t));         // bad, don't std::move a forwarding reference\n        call_something(std::forward<T>(t));   // ok\n        call_something(t);                    // suspicious, why not std::forward?\n    }\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* Flag use of `std::move(x)` where `x` is an rvalue or the language will already treat it as an rvalue, including `return std::move(local_variable);` and `std::move(f())` on a function that returns by value.\n* Flag functions taking an `S&&` parameter if there is no `const S&` overload to take care of lvalues.\n* Flag a `std::move`d argument passed to a parameter, except when the parameter type is an `X&&` rvalue reference or the type is move-only and the parameter is passed by value.\n* Flag when `std::move` is applied to a forwarding reference (`T&&` where `T` is a template parameter type).

 // sort [b:e)\n\n    sort(data, data + 100);\n\nHere, we use the compiler's knowledge about the size of the array, the type of elements, and how to compare `double`s.\n\nWith C++20, we can do better still\n\n    // sortable specifies that c must be a\n    // random-access sequence of elements comparable with <\n    void sort(sortable auto& c);\n\n    sort(c);\n\nThe key is to pass sufficient information for a good implementation to be chosen.\nIn this, the `sort` interfaces shown here still have a weakness:\nThey implicitly rely on the element type having less-than (`<`) defined.\nTo complete the interface, we need a second version that accepts a comparison criterion:\n\n    // compare elements of c using r\n    template<random_access_range R, class C> requires sortable<R, C>\n    void sort(R&& r, C c);\n\nThe standard-library specification of `sort` offers those two versions, and more.\n\n##### Note\n\nPremature optimization is said to be [the root of all evil](#Rper-Knuth), but that's not a reason to despise performance.\nIt is never premature to consider what makes a design amenable to improvement, and improved performance is a commonly desired improvement.\nAim to build a set of habits that by default results in efficient, maintainable, and optimizable code.\nIn particular, when you write a function that is not a one-off implementation detail, consider\n\n* Information passing:\nPrefer clean [interfaces](#S-interfaces) carrying sufficient information for later improvement of implementation.\nNote that information flows into and out of an implementation through the interfaces we provide.\n* Compact data: By default, [use compact data](#Rper-compact), such as `std::vector` and [access it in a systematic fashion](#Rper-access).\nIf you think you need a linked structure, try to craft the interface so that this structure isn't seen by users.\n* Function argument passing and return:\nDistinguish between mutable and non-mutable data.\nDon't impose a resource management burden on your users.\nDon't impose spurious run-time indirections on your users.\nUse [conventional ways](#Rf-conventional) of passing information through an interface;\nunconventional and/or \"optimized\" ways of passing data can seriously complicate later reimplementation.\n* Abstraction:\nDon't overgeneralize; a design that tries to cater for every possible use (and misuse) and defers every design decision for later\n(using compile-time or run-time indirections) is usually a complicated, bloated, hard-to-understand mess.\nGeneralize from concrete examples, preserving performance as we generalize.\nDo not generalize based on mere speculation about future needs.\nThe ideal is zero-overhead generalization.\n* Libraries:\nUse libraries with good interfaces.\nIf no library is available build one yourself and imitate the interface style from a good library.\nThe [standard library](#sl-the-standard-library) is a good first place to look for inspiration.\n* Isolation:\nIsolate your code from messy and/or old-style code by providing an interface of your choosing to it.\nThis is sometimes called \"providing a wrapper\" for the useful/necessary but messy code.\nDon't let bad designs \"bleed into\" your code.\n\n##### Example\n\nConsider:\n\n    template<class ForwardIterator, class T>\n    bool binary_search(ForwardIterator first, ForwardIterator last, const T& val);\n\n`binary_search(begin(c), end(c), 7)` will tell you whether `7` is in `c` or not.\nHowever, it will not tell you where that `7` is or whether there are more than one `7`.\n\nSometimes, just passing the minimal amount of information back (here, `true` or `false`) is sufficient, but a good interface passes\nneeded information back to the caller. Therefore, the standard library also offers\n\n    template<class ForwardIterator, class T>\n    ForwardIterator lower_bound(ForwardIterator first, ForwardIterator last, const T& val);\n\n`lower_bound` returns an iterator to the first match if any, otherwise to the first element greater than `val`, or `last` if no such element is found.\n\nHowever, `lower_bound` still doesn't return enough information for all uses, so the standard library also offers\n\n    template<class ForwardIterator, class T>\n    pair<ForwardIterator, ForwardIterator>\n    equal_range(ForwardIterator first, ForwardIterator last, const T& val);\n\n`equal_range` returns a `pair` of iterators specifying the first and one beyond last match.\n\n    auto r = equal_range(begin(c), end(c), 7);\n    for (auto p = r.first; p != r.second; ++p)\n        cout << *p << '\\n';\n\nObviously, these three interfaces are implemented by the same basic code.\nThey are simply three ways of presenting the basic binary search algorithm to users,\nranging from the simplest (\"make simple things simple!\")\nto returning complete, but not always needed, information (\"don't hide useful information\").\nNaturally, crafting such a set of interfaces requires experience and domain knowledge.\n\n##### Note\n\nDo not simply craft the interface to match the first implementation and the first use case you think of.\nOnce your first initial implementation is complete, review it; once you deploy it, mistakes will be hard to remedy.\n\n##### Note\n\nA need for efficiency does not imply a need for [low-level code](#Rper-low).\nHigh-level code isn't necessarily slow or bloated.\n\n##### Note\n\nThings have costs.\nDon't be paranoid about costs (modern computers really are very fast),\nbut have a rough idea of the order of magnitude of cost of what you use.\nFor example, have a rough idea of the cost of\na memory access,\na function call,\na string comparison,\na system call,\na disk access,\nand a message through a network.\n\n##### Note\n\nIf you can only think of one implementation, you probably don't have something for which you can devise a stable interface.\nMaybe, it is just an implementation detail - not every piece of code needs a stable interface - but pause and consider.\nOne question that can be useful is\n\"what interface would be needed if this operation should be implemented using multiple threads? be vectorized?\"\n\n##### Note\n\nThis rule does not contradict the [Don't optimize prematurely](#Rper-Knuth) rule.\nIt complements it, encouraging developers to enable later - appropriate and non-premature - optimization, if and where needed.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nTricky.\nMaybe looking for `void*` function arguments will find examples of interfaces that hinder later optimization.\n\n### <a name=\"Rper-type\"></a>Per.10: Rely on the static type system\n\n##### Reason\n\nType violations, weak types (e.g. `void*`s), and low-level code (e.g., manipulation of sequences as individual bytes) make the job of the optimizer much harder. Simple code often optimizes better than hand-crafted complex code.\n\n???\n\n### <a name=\"Rper-Comp\"></a>Per.11: Move computation from run time to compile time\n\n##### Reason\n\nTo decrease code size and run time.\nTo avoid data races by using constants.\nTo catch errors at compile time (and thus eliminate the need for error-handling code).\n\n##### Example\n\n    double square(double d) { return d*d; }\n    static double s2 = square(2);    // old-style: dynamic initialization\n\n    constexpr double ntimes(double d, int n)   // assume 0 <= n\n    {\n            double m = 1;\n            while (n--) m *= d;\n            return m;\n    }\n    constexpr double s3 {ntimes(2, 3)};  // modern-style: compile-time initialization\n\nCode like the initialization of `s2` isn't uncommon, especially for initialization that's a bit more complicated than `square()`.\nHowever, compared to the initialization of `s3` there are two problems:\n\n* we suffer the overhead of a function call at run time\n* `s2` just might be accessed by another thread before the initialization happens.\n\nNote: you can't have a data race on a constant.\n\n##### Example\n\nConsider a popular technique for providing a handle for storing small objects in the handle itself and larger ones on the heap.\n\n    constexpr int on_stack_max = 20;\n\n    template<typename T>\n    struct Scoped {     // store a T in Scoped\n            // ...\n        T obj;\n    };\n\n    template<typename T>\n    struct On_heap {    // store a T on the free store\n            // ...\n            T* objp;\n    };\n\n    template<typename T>\n    using Handle = typename std::conditional<(sizeof(T) <= on_stack_max),\n                        Scoped<T>,      // first alternative\n                        On_heap<T>      // second alternative\n                   >::type;\n\n    void f()\n    {\n        Handle<double> v1;                   // the double goes on the stack\n        Handle<std::array<double, 200>> v2;  // the array goes on the free store\n        // ...\n    }\n\nAssume that `Scoped` and `On_heap` provide compatible user interfaces.\nHere we compute the optimal type to use at compile time.\nThere are similar techniques for selecting the optimal function to call.\n\n##### Note\n\nThe ideal is *not* to try to execute everything at compile time.\nObviously, most computations depend on inputs, so they can't be moved to compile time,\nbut beyond that logical constraint is the fact that complex compile-time computation can seriously increase compile times\nand complicate debugging.\nIt is even possible to slow down code by compile-time computation.\nThis is admittedly rare, but by factoring out a general computation into separate optimal sub-calculations, it is possible to render the instruction cache less effective.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n* Look for simple functions that might be constexpr (but are not).\n* Look for functions called with all constant-expression arguments.\n* Look for macros that could be constexpr.\n\n### <a name=\"Rper-alias\"></a>Per.12: Eliminate redundant aliases\n\n???\n\n### <a name=\"Rper-indirect\"></a>Per.13: Eliminate redundant indirections\n\n???\n\n### <a name=\"Rper-alloc\"></a>Per.14: Minimize the number of allocations and deallocations\n\n???\n\n### <a name=\"Rper-alloc0\"></a>Per.15: Do not allocate on a critical branch\n\n???\n\n### <a name=\"Rper-compact\"></a>Per.16: Use compact data structures\n\n##### Reason\n\nPerformance is typically dominated by memory access times.\n\n???\n\n### <a name=\"Rper-struct\"></a>Per.17: Declare the most used member of a time-critical struct first\n\n???\n\n### <a name=\"Rper-space\"></a>Per.18: Space is time\n\n##### Reason\n\nPerformance is typically dominated by memory access times.\n\n???\n\n### <a name=\"Rper-access\"></a>Per.19: Access memory predictably\n\n##### Reason\n\nPerformance is very sensitive to cache performance, and cache algorithms favor simple (usually linear) access to adjacent data.\n\n##### Example\n\n    int matrix[rows][cols];\n\n    // bad\n    for (int c = 0; c < cols; ++c)\n        for (int r = 0; r < rows; ++r)\n            sum += matrix[r][c];\n\n    // good\n    for (int r = 0; r < rows; ++r)\n        for (int c = 0; c < cols; ++c)\n            sum += matrix[r][c];\n\n### <a name=\"Rper-context\"></a>Per.30: Avoid context switches on the critical path\n\n???\n\n# <a name=\"S-concurrency\"></a>CP: Concurrency and parallelism\n\nWe often want our computers to do many tasks at the same time (or at least appear to do them at the same time).\nThe reasons for doing so vary (e.g., waiting for many events using only a single processor, processing many data streams simultaneously, or utilizing many hardware facilities)\nand so do the basic facilities for expressing concurrency and parallelism.\nHere, we articulate principles and rules for using the ISO standard C++ facilities for expressing basic concurrency and parallelism.\n\nThreads are the machine-level foundation for concurrent and parallel programming.\nThreads allow running multiple sections of a program independently, while sharing\nthe same memory. Concurrent programming is tricky,\nbecause protecting shared data between threads is easier said than done.\nMaking existing single-threaded code execute concurrently can be\nas trivial as adding `std::async` or `std::thread` strategically, or it can\nnecessitate a full rewrite, depending on whether the original code was written\nin a thread-friendly way.\n\nThe concurrency/parallelism rules in this document are designed with three goals\nin mind:\n\n* To help in writing code that is amenable to being used in a threaded\n  environment\n* To show clean, safe ways to use the threading primitives offered by the\n  standard library\n* To offer guidance on what to do when concurrency and parallelism aren't giving\n  the performance gains needed\n\nIt is also important to note that concurrency in C++ is an unfinished\nstory. C++11 introduced many core concurrency primitives, C++14 and C++17 improved on\nthem, and there is much interest in making the writing of\nconcurrent programs in C++ even easier. We expect some of the library-related\nguidance here to change significantly over time.\n\nThis section needs a lot of work (obviously).\nPlease note that we start with rules for relative non-experts.\nReal experts must wait a bit;\ncontributions are welcome,\nbut please think about the majority of programmers who are struggling to get their concurrent programs correct and performant.\n\nConcurrency and parallelism rule summary:\n\n* [CP.1: Assume that your code will run as part of a multi-threaded program](#Rconc-multi)\n* [CP.2: Avoid data races](#Rconc-races)\n* [CP.3: Minimize explicit sharing of writable data](#Rconc-data)\n* [CP.4: Think in terms of tasks, rather than threads](#Rconc-task)\n* [CP.8: Don't try to use `volatile` for synchronization](#Rconc-volatile)\n* [CP.9: Whenever feasible use tools to validate your concurrent code](#Rconc-tools)\n\n**See also**:\n\n* [CP.con: Concurrency](#SScp-con)\n* [CP.coro: Coroutines](#SScp-coro)\n* [CP.par: Parallelism](#SScp-par)\n* [CP.mess: Message passing](#SScp-mess)\n* [CP.vec: Vectorization](#SScp-vec)\n* [CP.free: Lock-free programming](#SScp-free)\n* [CP.etc: Etc. concurrency rules](#SScp-etc)\n\n### <a name=\"Rconc-multi\"></a>CP.1: Assume that your code will run as part of a multi-threaded program\n\n##### Reason\n\nIt's hard to be certain that concurrency isn't used now or won't be used sometime in the future.\nCode gets reused.\nLibraries not using threads might be used from some other part of a program that does use threads.\nNote that this rule applies most urgently to library code and least urgently to stand-alone applications.\nHowever, over time, code fragments can turn up in unexpected places.\n\n##### Example, bad\n\n    double cached_computation(int x)\n    {\n        // bad: these statics cause data races in multi-threaded usage\n        static int cached_x = 0.0;\n        static double cached_result = COMPUTATION_OF_ZERO;\n\n        if (cached_x != x) {\n            cached_x = x;\n            cached_result = computation(x);\n        }\n        return cached_result;\n    }\n\nAlthough `cached_computation` works perfectly in a single-threaded environment, in a multi-threaded environment the two `static` variables result in data races and thus undefined behavior.\n\n##### Example, good\n\n    struct ComputationCache {\n        int cached_x = 0;\n        double cached_result = COMPUTATION_OF_ZERO;\n\n        double compute(int x) {\n            if (cached_x != x) {\n                cached_x = x;\n                cached_result = computation(x);\n            }\n            return cached_result;\n        }\n    };\n\nHere the cache is stored as member data of a `ComputationCache` object, rather than as shared static state.\nThis refactoring essentially delegates the concern upward to the caller: a single-threaded program\nmight still choose to have one global `ComputationCache`, while a multi-threaded program might\nhave one `ComputationCache` instance per thread, or one per \"context\" for any definition of \"context.\"\nThe refactored function no longer attempts to manage the allocation of `cached_x`. In that sense,\nthis is an application of the Single Responsibility Principle.\n\nIn this specific example, refactoring for thread-safety also improved reusability in single-threaded\nprograms. It's not hard to imagine that a single-threaded program might want two `ComputationCache` instances\nfor use in different parts of the program, without having them overwrite each other's cached data.\n\nThere are several other ways one might add thread-safety to code written for a standard multi-threaded environment\n(that is, one where the only form of concurrency is `std::thread`):\n\n* Mark the state variables as `thread_local` instead of `static`.\n* Implement concurrency control, for example, protecting access to the two `static` variables with a `static std::mutex`.\n* Refuse to build and/or run in a multi-threaded environment.\n* Provide two implementations: one for single-threaded environments and another for multi-threaded environments.\n\n##### Exception\n\nCode that is never run in a multi-threaded environment.\n\nBe careful: there are many examples where code that was \"known\" to never run in a multi-threaded program\nwas run as part of a multi-threaded program, often years later.\nTypically, such programs lead to a painful effort to remove data races.\nTherefore, code that is never intended to run in a multi-threaded environment should be clearly labeled as such and ideally come with compile or run-time enforcement mechanisms to catch those usage bugs early.\n\n### <a name=\"Rconc-races\"></a>CP.2: Avoid data races\n\n##### Reason\n\nUnless you do, nothing is guaranteed to work and subtle errors will persist.\n\n##### Note\n\nIn a nutshell, if two threads can access the same object concurrently (without synchronization), and at least one is a writer (performing a non-`const` operation), you have a data race.\nFor further information of how to use synchronization well to eliminate data races, please consult a good book about concurrency (See [Carefully study the literature](#Rconc-literature)).\n\n##### Example, bad\n\nThere are many examples of data races that exist, some of which are running in\nproduction software at this very moment. One very simple example:\n\n    int get_id()\n    {\n      static int id = 1;\n      return id++;\n    }\n\nThe increment here is an example of a data race. This can go wrong in many ways,\nincluding:\n\n* Thread A loads the value of `id`, the OS context switches A out for some\n  period, during which other threads create hundreds of IDs. Thread A is then\n  allowed to run again, and `id` is written back to that location as A's read of\n  `id` plus one.\n* Thread A and B load `id` and increment it simultaneously.  They both get the\n  same ID.\n\nLocal static variables are a common source of data races.\n\n##### Example, bad:\n\n    void f(fstream& fs, regex pattern)\n    {\n        array<double, max> buf;\n        int sz = read_vec(fs, buf, max);            // read from fs into buf\n        gsl::span<double> s {buf};\n        // ...\n        auto h1 = async([&] { sort(std::execution::par, s); });     // spawn a task to sort\n        // ...\n        auto h2 = async([&] { return find_all(buf, sz, pattern); });   // spawn a task to find matches\n        // ...\n    }\n\nHere, we have a (nasty) data race on the elements of `buf` (`sort` will both read and write).\nAll data races are nasty.\nHere, we managed to get a data race on data on the stack.\nNot all data races are as easy to spot as this one.\n\n##### Example, bad:\n\n    // code not controlled by a lock\n\n    unsigned val;\n\n    if (val < 5) {\n        // ... other thread can change val here ...\n        switch (val) {\n        case 0: // ...\n        case 1: // ...\n        case 2: // ...\n        case 3: // ...\n        case 4: // ...\n        }\n    }\n\nNow, a compiler that does not know that `val` can change will  most likely implement that `switch` using a jump table with five entries.\nThen, a `val` outside the `[0..4]` range will cause a jump to an address that could be anywhere in the program, and execution would proceed there.\nReally, \"all bets are off\" if you get a data race.\nActually, it can be worse still: by looking at the generated code you might be able to determine where the stray jump will go for a given value;\nthis can be a security risk.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nSome is possible, do at least something.\nThere are commercial and open-source tools that try to address this problem,\nbut be aware that solutions have costs and blind spots.\nStatic tools often have many false positives and run-time tools often have a significant cost.\nWe hope for better tools.\nUsing multiple tools can catch more problems than a single one.\n\nThere are other ways you can mitigate the chance of data races:\n\n* Avoid global data\n* Avoid `static` variables\n* More use of concrete types on the stack (and don't pass pointers around too much)\n* More use of immutable data (literals, `constexpr`, and `const`)\n\n### <a name=\"Rconc-data\"></a>CP.3: Minimize explicit sharing of writable data\n\n##### Reason\n\nIf you don't share writable data, you can't have a data race.\nThe less sharing you do, the less chance you have to forget to synchronize access (and get data races).\nThe less sharing you do, the less chance you have to wait on a lock (so performance can improve).\n\n##### Example\n\n    bool validate(const vector<Reading>&);\n    Graph<Temp_node> temperature_gradients(const vector<Reading>&);\n    Image altitude_map(const vector<Reading>&);\n    // ...\n\n    void process_readings(const vector<Reading>& surface_readings)\n    {\n        auto h1 = async([&] { if (!validate(surface_readings)) throw Invalid_data{}; });\n        auto h2 = async([&] { return temperature_gradients(surface_readings); });\n        auto h3 = async([&] { return altitude_map(surface_readings); });\n        // ...\n        h1.get();\n        auto v2 = h2.get();\n        auto v3 = h3.get();\n        // ...\n    }\n\nWithout those `const`s, we would have to review every asynchronously invoked function for potential data races on `surface_readings`.\nMaking `surface_readings` be `const` (with respect to this function) allow reasoning using only the function body.\n\n##### Note\n\nImmutable data can be safely and efficiently shared.\nNo locking is needed: You can't have a data race on a constant.\nSee also [CP.mess: Message Passing](#SScp-mess) and [CP.31: prefer pass by value](#Rconc-data-by-value).\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n???\n\n\n### <a name=\"Rconc-task\"></a>CP.4: Think in terms of tasks, rather than threads\n\n##### Reason\n\nA `thread` is an implementation concept, a way of thinking about the machine.\nA task is an application notion, something you'd like to do, preferably concurrently with other tasks.\nApplication concepts are easier to reason about.\n\n##### Example\n\n    void some_fun(const std::string& msg)\n    {\n        std::thread publisher([=] { std::cout << msg; });      // bad: less expressive\n                                                               //      and more error-prone\n        auto pubtask = std::async([=] { std::cout << msg; });  // OK\n        // ...\n        publisher.join();\n    }\n\n##### Note\n\nWith the exception of `async()`, the standard-library facilities are low-level, machine-oriented, threads-and-lock level.\nThis is a necessary foundation, but we have to try to raise the level of abstraction: for productivity, for reliability, and for performance.\nThis is a potent argument for using higher level, more applications-oriented libraries (if possible, built on top of standard-library facilities).\n\n##### Enforcement\n\n???\n\n### <a name=\"Rconc-volatile\"></a>CP.8: Don't try to use `volatile` for synchronization\n\n##### Reason\n\nIn C++, unlike some other languages, `volatile` does not provide atomicity, does not synchronize between threads,\nand does not prevent instruction reordering (neither compiler nor hardware).\nIt simply has nothing to do with concurrency.\n\n##### Example, bad:\n\n    int free_slots = max_slots; // current source of memory for objects\n\n    Pool* use()\n    {\n        if (int n = free_slots--) return &pool[n];\n    }\n\nHere we have a problem:\nThis is perfectly good code in a single-threaded program, but have two threads execute this and\nthere is a race condition on `free_slots` so that two threads might get the same value and `free_slots`.\nThat's (obviously) a bad data race, so people trained in other languages might try to fix it like this:\n\n    volatile int free_slots = max_slots; // current source of memory for objects\n\n    Pool* use()\n    {\n        if (int n = free_slots--) return &pool[n];\n    }\n\nThis has no effect on synchronization: The data race is still there!\n\nThe C++ mechanism for this is `atomic` types:\n\n    atomic<int> free_slots = max_slots; // current source of memory for objects\n\n    Pool* use()\n    {\n        if (int n = free_slots--) return &pool[n];\n    }\n\nNow the `--` operation is atomic,\nrather than a read-increment-write sequence where another thread might get in-between the individual operations.\n\n##### Alternative\n\nUse `atomic` types where you might have used `volatile` in some other language.\nUse a `mutex` for more complicated examples.\n\n##### See also\n\n[(rare) proper uses of `volatile`](#Rconc-volatile2)\n\n### <a name=\"Rconc-tools\"></a>CP.9: Whenever feasible use tools to validate your concurrent code\n\nExperience shows that concurrent code is exceptionally hard to get right\nand that compile-time checking, run-time checks, and testing are less effective at finding concurrency errors\nthan they are at finding errors in sequential code.\nSubtle concurrency errors can have dramatically bad effects, including memory corruption, deadlocks, and security vulnerabilities.\n\n##### Example\n\n    ???\n\n##### Note\n\nThread safety is challenging, often getting the better of experienced programmers: tooling is an important strategy to mitigate those risks.\nThere are many tools \"out there\", both commercial and open-source tools, both research and production tools.\nUnfortunately people's needs and constraints differ so dramatically that we cannot make specific recommendations,\nbut we can mention:\n\n* Static enforcement tools: both [clang](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.html)\nand some older versions of [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/ThreadSafetyAnnotation)\nhave some support for static annotation of thread safety properties.\nConsistent use of this technique turns many classes of thread-safety errors into compile-time errors.\nThe annotations are generally local (marking a particular data member as guarded by a particular mutex),\nand are usually easy to learn. However, as with many static tools, it can often present false negatives;\ncases that should have been caught but were allowed.\n\n* dynamic enforcement tools: Clang's [Thread Sanitizer](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSanitizer.html) (aka TSAN)\nis a powerful example of dynamic tools: it changes the build and execution of your program to add bookkeeping on memory access,\nabsolutely identifying data races in a given execution of your binary.\nThe cost for this is both memory (5-10x in most cases) and CPU slowdown (2-20x).\nDynamic tools like this are best when applied to integration tests, canary pushes, or unit tests that operate on multiple threads.\nWorkload matters: When TSAN identifies a problem, it is effectively always an actual data race,\nbut it can only identify races seen in a given execution.\n\n##### Enforcement\n\nIt is up to an application builder to choose which support tools are valuable for a particular application.\n\n## <a name=\"SScp-con\"></a>CP.con: Concurrency\n\nThis section focuses on"

They are the result of many\nperson-years of discussion and design across a number of organizations. Their design encourages general applicability and broad adoption but\nthey can be freely copied and modified to meet your organization's needs.\n\n## Getting started\n\nThe guidelines themselves are found at [CppCoreGuidelines](CppCoreGuidelines.md). The document is in [GH-flavored MarkDown](https://github.github.com/gfm/). It is intentionally kept simple, mostly in ASCII, to allow automatic post-processing such as language translation and reformatting. The editors maintain one\n[version formatted for browsing](http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines). Note that it is manually integrated and can be slightly older than the version in the master branch.\n\nThe Guidelines are a constantly evolving document without a strict \"release\" cadence. Bjarne Stroustrup periodically reviews the document and increments the version number in the introduction. [Checkins that increment the version number](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/releases) are tagged in git. \n\nMany of the guidelines make use of the header-only Guidelines Support Library. One implementation is available at [GSL: Guidelines Support Library](https://github.com/Microsoft/GSL).\n\n## Background and scope\n\nThe aim of the guidelines is to help people to use modern C++ effectively. By \"modern C++\" we mean C++11 and newer. In other\nwords, what would you like your code to look like in 5 years' time, given that you can start now? In 10 years' time?\n\nThe guidelines are focused on relatively higher-level issues, such as interfaces, resource management, memory management, and concurrency. Such\nrules affect application architecture and library design. Following the rules will lead to code that is statically type-safe, has no resource\nleaks, and catches many more programming logic errors than is common in code today. And it will run fast -- you can afford to do things right.\n\nWe are less concerned with low-level issues, such as naming conventions and indentation style. However, no topic that can help a programmer is\nout of bounds.\n\nOur initial set of rules emphasizes safety (of various forms) and simplicity. They may very well be too strict. We expect to have to introduce\nmore exceptions to better accommodate real-world needs. We also need more rules.\n\nYou will find some of the rules contrary to your expectations or even contrary to your experience. If we haven't suggested that you change your\ncoding style in any way, we have failed! Please try to verify or disprove rules! In particular, we'd really like to have some of our rules\nbacked up with measurements or better examples.\n\nYou will find some of the rules obvious or even trivial. Please remember that one purpose of a guideline is to help someone who is less\nexperienced or coming from a different background or language to get up to speed.\n\nThe rules are designed to be supported by an analysis tool. Violations of rules will be flagged with references (or links) to the relevant rule.\nWe do not expect you to memorize all the rules before trying to write code.\n\nThe rules are meant for gradual introduction into a code base. We plan to build tools for that and hope others will too.\n\n## Contributions and LICENSE\n\nComments and suggestions for improvements are most welcome. We plan to modify and extend this document as our understanding improves and the\nlanguage and the set of available libraries improve.

They are the result of many \\r\\nperson-years of discussion and design across a number of organizations. Their design encourages general applicability and broad adoption but \\r\\nthey can be freely copied and modified to meet your organization's needs. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe aim of the guidelines is to help people to use modern C++ effectively. By \\\"modern C++\\\" we mean C++11 and C++14 (and soon C++17). In other \\r\\nwords, what would you like your code to look like in 5 years' time, given that you can start now? In 10 years' time?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe guidelines are focused on relatively higher-level issues, such as interfaces, resource management, memory management, and concurrency. Such \\r\\nrules affect application architecture and library design. Following the rules will lead to code that is statically type safe, has no resource \\r\\nleaks, and catches many more programming logic errors than is common in code today. And it will run fast - you can afford to do things right.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are less concerned with low-level issues, such as naming conventions and indentation style. However, no topic that can help a programmer is \\r\\nout of bounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur initial set of rules emphasize safety (of various forms) and simplicity. They may very well be too strict. We expect to have to introduce \\r\\nmore exceptions to better accommodate real-world needs. We also need more rules.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou will find some of the rules contrary to your expectations or even contrary to your experience. If we haven't suggested you change your \\r\\ncoding style in any way, we have failed! Please try to verify or disprove rules! In particular, we'd really like to have some of our rules \\r\\nbacked up with measurements or better examples.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou will find some of the rules obvious or even trivial. Please remember that one purpose of a guideline is to help someone who is less \\r\\nexperienced or coming from a different background or language to get up to speed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rules are designed to be supported by an analysis tool. Violations of rules will be flagged with references (or links) to the relevant rule. \\r\\nWe do not expect you to memorize all the rules before trying to write code.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rules are meant for gradual introduction into a code base. We plan to build tools for that and hope others will too.\\r\\n\\r\\nComments and suggestions for improvements are most welcome. We plan to modify and extend this document as our understanding improves and the \\r\\nlanguage and the set of available libraries improve.\\r\\n\",\"google\":\"\",\"note\":\"Don't delete this file!
