          "content": "# Instructions for Logging Issues\n\n## 1. Read the FAQ\n\nPlease [read the FAQ](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/FAQ) before logging new issues, even if you think you have found a bug.\n\nIssues that ask questions answered in the FAQ will be closed without elaboration.\n\n## 2. Search for Duplicates\n\n[Search the existing issues in GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/search?type=Issues) or by the query `site:github.com/microsoft/TypeScript <your keywords>` in your favorite search engine before logging a new one. Search engines generally list more relevant and accurate results at the top than the GitHub searching feature.\n\nSome search tips:\n * *Don't* restrict your search to only open issues. An issue with a title similar to yours may have been closed as a duplicate of one with a less-findable title.\n * Check for synonyms. For example, if your bug involves an interface, it likely also occurs with type aliases or classes.\n * Search for the title of the issue you're about to log. This sounds obvious but 80% of the time this is sufficient to find a duplicate when one exists.\n * Read more than the first page of results. Many bugs here use the same words so relevancy sorting is not particularly strong.\n * If you have a crash, search for the first few topmost function names shown in the call stack.\n\n## 3. Do you have a question?\n\nThe issue tracker is for **issues**, in other words, bugs and suggestions.\nIf you have a *question*, please use [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/typescript), [Gitter](https://gitter.im/Microsoft/TypeScript), your favorite search engine, or other resources.\nDue to increased traffic, we can no longer answer questions in the issue tracker.\n\n## 4. Did you find a bug?\n\nWhen logging a bug, please be sure to include the following:\n * What version of TypeScript you're using (run `tsc --v`)\n * If at all possible, an *isolated* way to reproduce the behavior\n * The behavior you expect to see, and the actual behavior\n\nYou can try out the nightly build of TypeScript (`npm install typescript@next`) to see if the bug has already been fixed.\n\n## 5. Do you have a suggestion?\n\nWe also accept suggestions in the issue tracker.\nBe sure to [check the FAQ](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/FAQ) and [search](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue) first.\n\nIn general, things we find useful when reviewing suggestions are:\n* A description of the problem you're trying to solve\n* An overview of the suggested solution\n* Examples of how the suggestion would work in various places\n  * Code examples showing e.g. \"this would be an error, this wouldn't\"\n  * Code examples showing the generated JavaScript (if applicable)\n* If relevant, precedent in other languages can be useful for establishing context and expected behavior\n\n# Instructions for Contributing Code\n\n## What You'll Need\n\n0. [A bug or feature you want to work on](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/labels/help%20wanted)!\n1. [A GitHub account](https://github.com/join).\n2. A copy of the TypeScript code. See the next steps for instructions.\n3. [Node](https://nodejs.org), which runs JavaScript locally. Current or LTS will both work.\n4. An editor. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is the best place to start for TypeScript.\n5. The hereby command line tool, for building and testing changes. See the next steps for how to install it.\n\n## Get Started\n\n1. Install node using the version you downloaded from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).\n2. Open a terminal.\n3. Make a fork&mdash;your own copy&mdash;of TypeScript on your GitHub account, then make a clone&mdash;a local copy&mdash;on your computer. ([Here are some step-by-step instructions](https://github.com/anitab-org/mentorship-android/wiki/Fork%2C-Clone-%26-Remote)). Add `--depth=1` to the end of the `git clone` command to save time.\n4. Install the hereby command line tool: `npm install -g hereby`\n5. Change to the TypeScript folder you made: `cd TypeScript`\n6. Install dependencies: `npm ci`\n7. Make sure everything builds and tests pass: `hereby runtests-parallel`\n8. Open the TypeScript folder in your editor.\n9. Follow the directions below to add and debug a test.\n\n## Helpful tasks\n\nRunning `hereby --tasks` provides the full listing, but here are a few common tasks you might use.\n\n```\nhereby local             # Build the compiler into built/local.\nhereby clean             # Delete the built compiler.\nhereby LKG               # Replace the last known good with the built one.\n                         # Bootstrapping step to be executed when the built compiler reaches a stable state.\nhereby tests             # Build the test infrastructure using the built compiler.\nhereby runtests          # Run tests using the built compiler and test infrastructure.\n                         # You can override the specific suite runner used or specify a test for this command.\n                         # Use --tests=<testPath> for a specific test and/or --runner=<runnerName> for a specific suite.\n                         # Valid runners include conformance, compiler, fourslash, and project\nhereby runtests-parallel # Like runtests, but split across multiple threads. Uses a number of threads equal to the system\n                         # core count by default. Use --workers=<number> to adjust this.\nhereby baseline-accept   # This replaces the baseline test results with the results obtained from hereby runtests.\nhereby lint              # Runs eslint on the TypeScript source.\nhereby help              # List the above commands.\n```\n\n## Tips\n\n### Using a development container\n\nIf you prefer to develop using containers, this repository includes a [development container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) that you can use to quickly create an isolated development environment with all the tools you need to start working on TypeScript. To get started with a dev container and VS Code, either:\n\n- Clone the TypeScript repository locally and use the `Open Folder in Container` command.\n- Use the `Clone Repository in Container Volume` command to clone the TypeScript repository into a new container.\n\n### Faster clones\n\nThe TypeScript repository is relatively large. To save some time, you might want to clone it without the repo's full history using `git clone --depth=1`.\n\n### Filename too long on Windows\n\nYou might need to run `git config --global core.longpaths true` before cloning TypeScript on Windows.\n\n### Using local builds\n\nRun `hereby` to build a version of the compiler/language service that reflects changes you've made. You can then run `node <repo-root>/built/local/tsc.js` in place of `tsc` in your project. For example, to run `tsc --watch` from within the root of the repository on a file called `test.ts`, you can run `node ./built/local/tsc.js --watch test.ts`.\n\n## Contributing bug fixes\n\nTypeScript is currently accepting contributions in the form of bug fixes. A bug must have an issue tracking it in the issue tracker that has been approved (labelled [\"help wanted\"](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) or in the \"Backlog milestone\") by the TypeScript team. Your pull request should include a link to the bug that you are fixing. If you've submitted a PR for a bug, please post a comment in the bug to avoid duplication of effort.\n\n## Contributing features\n\nFeatures (things that add new or improved functionality to TypeScript) may be accepted, but will need to first be approved (labelled [\"help wanted\"](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) or in the \"Backlog\" milestone) by a TypeScript project maintainer in the suggestion issue. Features with language design impact, or that are adequately satisfied with external tools, will not be accepted.\n\n## Issue claiming\n\nIf you intend to work on an issue, please avoid leaving comments like \"I'm going to work on this\". There are a few reasons for this. These comments tend to [discourage anyone from working in the area](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20091201-00/?p=15843), yet many issues are much more difficult than they first appear, and you might find yourself trying to fix several issues before finding one that can be completed. Many issues have a long trail of people indicating that they're going to try to fix it, but no PR.\n\nConversely, you do not need to ask anyone's permission before starting work on an issue marked as \"help wanted\". It's always fine to try! We ask that you choose issues tagged in the \"Backlog\" milestone as these are issues that we've identified as needing fixes / implementations.\n\nThe sheer quantity of open issues, combined with their general difficulty, makes it extremely unlikely that you and another contributor are a) working on the same issue and b) both going to find a solution.\n\n## Legal\n\nYou will need to complete a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). Briefly, this agreement testifies that you are granting us permission to use the submitted change according to the terms of the project's license, and that the work being submitted is under appropriate copyright. Upon submitting a pull request, you will automatically be given instructions on how to sign the CLA.\n\n## Housekeeping\n\nYour pull request should:\n\n* Include a description of what your change intends to do\n* Be based on reasonably recent commit in the **main** branch\n* Include adequate tests\n    * At least one test should fail in the absence of your non-test code changes. If your PR does not match this criteria, please specify why\n    * Tests should include reasonable permutations of the target fix/change\n    * Include baseline changes with your change\n* Follow the code conventions described in [Coding guidelines](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Coding-guidelines)\n* To avoid line ending issues, set `autocrlf = input` and `whitespace = cr-at-eol` in your git configuration\n\n## Force-pushing\n\nAvoid force-pushing your changes, especially when updating your PR based on review feedback. Force-pushed changes are not easily viewable on GitHub, and not at all viewable if a force-push also rebases against main. TypeScript PRs are squash merged, so the specific commits on your PR branch do not matter, only the PR title itself. Don't worry about having a perfect commit history; instead focus on making your changes as easy to review and merge as possible.\n\n## Contributing `lib.d.ts` fixes\n\nThere are three relevant locations to be aware of when it comes to TypeScript's library declaration files:\n\n* `src/lib`: the location of the sources themselves.\n* `lib`: the location of the last-known-good (LKG) versions of the files which are updated periodically.\n* `built/local`: the build output location, including where `src/lib` files will be copied to.\n\nAny changes should be made to [src/lib](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/tree/main/src/lib). **Most** of these files can be updated by hand, with the exception of any generated files (see below).\n\nLibrary files in `built/local/` are updated automatically by running the standard build task:\n\n```sh\nhereby\n```\n\nThe files in `lib/` are used to bootstrap compilation and usually **should not** be updated unless publishing a new version or updating the LKG.\n\n### Modifying generated library files\n\nThe files `src/lib/dom.generated.d.ts` and `src/lib/webworker.generated.d.ts` both represent type declarations for the DOM and are auto-generated. To make any modifications to them, you will have to direct changes to https://github.com/Microsoft/TSJS-lib-generator\n\n## Documentation on TypeScript Compiler\n\nIf you need a head start understanding how the compiler works, or how the code in different parts of the compiler works, there is a separate repo: [TypeScript Compiler Notes](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-Compiler-Notes). As the name implies, it contains notes understood by different engineers about different parts of the compiler.\n\n## Running the Tests\n\nTo run all tests, invoke the `runtests-parallel` target using hereby:\n\n```Shell\nhereby runtests-parallel\n```\n\nThis will run all tests; to run only a specific subset of tests, use:\n\n```Shell\nhereby runtests --tests=<regex>\n```\n\ne.g. to run all compiler baseline tests:\n\n```Shell\nhereby runtests --tests=compiler\n```\n\nor to run a specific test: `tests\\cases\\compiler\\2dArrays.ts`\n\n```Shell\nhereby runtests --tests=2dArrays\n```\n\n## Debugging the tests\n\nYou can debug with VS Code or Node instead with `hereby runtests -i`:\n\n```Shell\nhereby runtests --tests=2dArrays -i\n```\n\nYou can also use the [provided VS Code launch configuration](./.vscode/launch.template.json) to launch a debug session for an open test file. Rename the file 'launch.json', open the test file of interest, and launch the debugger from the debug panel (or press F5).\n\n## Adding a Test\n\nTo add a new test case, add a `.ts` file in `tests\\cases\\compiler` with code that shows the bug is now fixed, or your new feature now works.\n\nThese files support metadata tags in the format  `// @metaDataName: value`.\nThe supported names and values are the same as those supported in the compiler itself, with the addition of the `fileName` flag.\n`fileName` tags delimit sections of a file to be used as separate compilation units.\nThey are useful for testing modules.\nSee below for examples.\n\n**Note** that if you have a test corresponding to a specific area of spec compliance, you can put it in the appropriate subfolder of `tests\\cases\\conformance`.\n**Note** that test filenames must be distinct from all other test names, so you may have to work a bit to find a unique name if it's something common.\n\n### Tests for multiple files\n\nWhen you need to mimic having multiple files in a single test to test features such as \"import\", use the `filename` tag:\n\n```ts\n// @filename: file1.ts\nexport function f() {\n}\n\n// @filename: file2.ts\nimport { f as g } from \"file1\";\n\nvar x = g();\n```\n\n## Managing the baselines\n\nMost tests generate \"baselines\" to find differences in output.\nAs an example, compiler tests usually emit one file each for\n\n- the `.js` and `.d.ts` output (all in the same `.js` output file),\n- the errors produced by the compiler (in an `.errors.txt` file),\n- the types of each expression (in a `.types` file),\n- the symbols for each identifier (in a `.symbols` file), and\n- the source map outputs for files if a test opts into them (in a `.js.map` file).\n\nWhen a change in the baselines is detected, the test will fail. To inspect changes vs the expected baselines, use\n\n```Shell\ngit diff --diff-filter=AM --no-index ./tests/baselines/reference ./tests/baselines/local\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can set the `DIFF` environment variable and run `hereby diff`, or manually run your favorite folder diffing tool between `tests/baselines/reference` and `tests/baselines/local`. Our team largely uses Beyond Compare and WinMerge.\n\nAfter verifying that the changes in the baselines are correct, run\n\n```Shell\nhereby baseline-accept\n```\n\nThis will change the files in `tests\\baselines\\reference`, which should be included as part of your commit.\nBe sure to validate the changes carefully -- apparently unrelated changes to baselines can be clues about something you didn't think of.\n\n## Localization\n\nAll strings the user may see are stored in [`diagnosticMessages.json`](./src/compiler/diagnosticMessages.json).\nIf you make changes to it, run `hereby generate-diagnostics` to push them to the `Diagnostic` interface in `diagnosticInformationMap.generated.ts`.\n\nSee [coding guidelines on diagnostic messages](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Coding-guidelines#diagnostic-messages).\n"

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses. Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC- licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:\r\n\r\nwiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations for the public: wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensees ======================================================================= \r\nCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License (\"Public License\"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions. Section 1 -- Definitions. a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image. b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License. c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights. d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements. e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material. f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License. g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license. h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License. i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them. j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world. k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning. Section 2 -- Scope. a. License grant. 1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to: a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material. 2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions. 3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a). 4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a) (4) never produces Adapted Material. 5. Downstream recipients. a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License. b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material. 6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i). b. Other rights. 1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise. 2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License. 3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties. Section 3 -- License Conditions. Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions. a. Attribution. 1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must: a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material: i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated); ii. a copyright notice; iii. a notice that refers to this Public License; iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties; v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable; b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License. 2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information. 3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable. 4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License. Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights. Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material: a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database; b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights. Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability. a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability. Section 6 -- Term and Termination. a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically. b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates: 1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or 2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License. c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License. d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License. Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions. a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed. b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License. Section 8 -- Interpretation. a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License. b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions. c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor. d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority. ======================================================================= Creative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.

See also the related \"W3C Community Contributor License Agreement\".\r\n1. The Purpose of this Agreement.\r\nThis Agreement sets forth the terms under which I make certain copyright and patent rights available to you for your implementation of the Specification. \r\nAny other capitalized terms not specifically defined herein have the same meaning as those terms have in the \"W3C Patent Policy\", and if not defined there, in the \"W3C Process Document\".\r\n2. Copyrights. \r\n2.1. Copyright Grant. I grant to you a perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright), worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, copyright license, without any obligation for accounting to me, to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, distribute, and implement the Specification to the full extent of my copyright interest in the Specification. \r\n2.2. Attribution. As a condition of the copyright grant, you must include an attribution to the Specification in any derivative work you make based on the Specification. That attribution must include, at minimum, the Specification name and version number.\r\n3. Patents. \r\n3.1. Patent Licensing Commitment. I agree to license my Essential Claims under the W3C Community RF Licensing Requirements. This requirement includes Essential Claims that I own and any that I have the right to license without obligation of payment or other consideration to an unrelated third party. W3C Community RF Licensing Requirements obligations made concerning the Specification and described in this policy are binding on me for the life of the patents in question and encumber the patents containing Essential Claims, regardless of changes in participation status or W3C Membership. I also agree to license my Essential Claims under the W3C Community RF Licensing Requirements in derivative works of the Specification so long as all normative portions of the Specification are maintained and that this licensing commitment does not extend to any portion of the derivative work that was not included in the Specification.\r\n3.2. Optional, Additional Patent Grant. In addition to the provisions of Section 3.1, I may also, at my option, make certain intellectual property rights infringed by implementations of the Specification, including Essential Claims, available by providing those terms via the W3C Web site.\r\n4. No Other Rights. Except as specifically set forth in this Agreement, no other express or implied patent, trademark, copyright, or other property rights are granted under this Agreement, including by implication, waiver, or estoppel.\r\n5. Antitrust Compliance. I acknowledge that I may compete with other participants, that I am under no obligation to implement the Specification, that each participant is free to develop competing technologies and standards, and that each party is free to license its patent rights to third parties, including for the purpose of enabling competing technologies and standards.\r\n6. Non-Circumvention. I agree that I will not intentionally take or willfully assist any third party to take any action for the purpose of circumventing my obligations under this Agreement.\r\n7. Transition to W3C Recommendation Track. The Specification developed by the Project may transition to the W3C Recommendation Track. The W3C Team is responsible for notifying me that a Corresponding Working Group has been chartered. I have no obligation to join the Corresponding Working Group. If the Specification developed by the Project transitions to the W3C Recommendation Track, the following terms apply: \r\n7.1. If I join the Corresponding Working Group. If I join the Corresponding Working Group, I will be subject to all W3C rules, obligations, licensing commitments, and policies that govern that Corresponding Working Group.\r\n7.2. If I Do Not Join the Corresponding Working Group. \r\n7.2.1. Licensing Obligations to Resulting Specification. If I do not join the Corresponding Working Group, I agree to offer patent licenses according to the W3C Royalty-Free licensing requirements described in Section 5 of the W3C Patent Policy for the portions of the Specification included in the resulting Recommendation. This licensing commitment does not extend to any portion of an implementation of the Recommendation that was not included in the Specification. This licensing commitment may not be revoked but may be modified through the exclusion process defined in Section 4 of the W3C Patent Policy. I am not required to join the Corresponding Working Group to exclude patents from the W3C Royalty-Free licensing commitment, but must otherwise follow the normal exclusion procedures defined by the W3C Patent Policy. The W3C Team will notify me of any Call for Exclusion in the Corresponding Working Group as set forth in Section 4.5 of the W3C Patent Policy.\r\n7.2.2. No Disclosure Obligation. If I do not join the Corresponding Working Group, I have no patent disclosure obligations outside of those set forth in Section 6 of the W3C Patent Policy.\r\n8. Conflict of Interest. I will disclose significant relationships when those relationships might reasonably be perceived as creating a conflict of interest with my role. I will notify W3C of any change in my affiliation using W3C-provided mechanisms.\r\n9. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimers. I represent and warrant that I am legally entitled to grant the rights and promises set forth in this Agreement. IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS THE SPECIFICATION IS PROVIDED “AS IS.” The entire risk as to implementing or otherwise using the Specification is assumed by the implementer and user. Except as stated herein, I expressly disclaim any warranties (express, implied, or otherwise), including implied warranties of merchantability, non-infringement, fitness for a particular purpose, or title, related to the Specification. IN NO EVENT WILL ANY PARTY BE LIABLE TO ANY OTHER PARTY FOR LOST PROFITS OR ANY FORM OF INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER FROM ANY CAUSES OF ACTION OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. All of my obligations under Section 3 regarding the transfer, successors in interest, or assignment of Granted Claims will be satisfied if I notify the transferee or assignee of any patent that I know contains Granted Claims of the obligations under Section 3. Nothing in this Agreement requires me to undertake a patent search.\r\n10. Definitions. \r\n10.1. Agreement. “Agreement” means this W3C Community Final Specification Agreement.\r\n10.2. Corresponding Working Group. “Corresponding Working Group” is a W3C Working Group that is chartered to develop a Recommendation, as defined in the W3C Process Document, that takes the Specification as an input.\r\n10.3. Essential Claims. “Essential Claims” shall mean all claims in any patent or patent application in any jurisdiction in the world that would necessarily be infringed by implementation of the Specification. A claim is necessarily infringed hereunder only when it is not possible to avoid infringing it because there is no non-infringing alternative for implementing the normative portions of the Specification. Existence of a non-infringing alternative shall be judged based on the state of the art at the time of the publication of the Specification. The following are expressly excluded from and shall not be deemed to constitute Essential Claims: \r\n10.3.1. any claims other than as set forth above even if contained in the same patent as Essential Claims; and\r\n10.3.2. claims which would be infringed only by: \r\nportions of an implementation that are not specified in the normative portions of the Specification, or\r\nenabling technologies that may be necessary to make or use any product or portion thereof that complies with the Specification and are not themselves expressly set forth in the Specification (e.g., semiconductor manufacturing technology, compiler technology, object-oriented technology, basic operating system technology, and the like); or\r\nthe implementation of technology developed elsewhere and merely incorporated by reference in the body of the Specification.\r\n10.3.3. design patents and design registrations.\r\nFor purposes of this definition, the normative portions of the Specification shall be deemed to include only architectural and interoperability requirements. Optional features in the RFC 2119 sense are considered normative unless they are specifically identified as informative. Implementation examples or any other material that merely illustrate the requirements of the Specification are informative, rather than normative.\r\n10.4. I, Me, or My. “I,” “me,” or “my” refers to the signatory.\r\n10.5 Project. “Project” means the W3C Community Group or Business Group for which I executed this Agreement.\r\n10.6. Specification. “Specification” means the Specification identified by the Project as the target of this agreement in a call for Final Specification Commitments. W3C shall provide the authoritative mechanisms for the identification of this Specification.\r\n10.7. W3C Community RF Licensing Requirements. “W3C Community RF Licensing Requirements” license shall mean a non-assignable, non-sublicensable license to make, have made, use, sell, have sold, offer to sell, import, and distribute and dispose of implementations of the Specification that: \r\n10.7.1. shall be available to all, worldwide, whether or not they are W3C Members;\r\n10.7.2. shall extend to all Essential Claims owned or controlled by me;\r\n10.7.3. may be limited to implementations of the Specification, and to what is required by the Specification;\r\n10.7.4. may be conditioned on a grant of a reciprocal RF license (as defined in this policy) to all Essential Claims owned or controlled by the licensee. A reciprocal license may be required to be available to all, and a reciprocal license may itself be conditioned on a further reciprocal license from all.\r\n10.7.5. may not be conditioned on payment of royalties, fees or other consideration;\r\n10.7.6. may be suspended with respect to any licensee when licensor issued by licensee for infringement of claims essential to implement the Specification or any W3C Recommendation;\r\n10.7.7. may not impose any further conditions or restrictions on the use of any technology, intellectual property rights, or other restrictions on behavior of the licensee, but may include reasonable, customary terms relating to operation or maintenance of the license relationship such as the following: choice of law and dispute resolution;\r\n10.7.8. shall not be considered accepted by an implementer who manifests an intent not to accept the terms of the W3C Community RF Licensing Requirements license as offered by the licensor.\r\n10.7.9. The RF license conforming to the requirements in this policy shall be made available by the licensor as long as the Specification is in effect. The term of such license shall be for the life of the patents in question.\r\nI am encouraged to provide a contact from which licensing information can be obtained and other relevant licensing information. Any such information will be made publicly available. \r\n10.8. You or Your. “You,” “you,” or “your” means any person or entity who exercises copyright or patent rights granted under this Agreement, and any person that person or entity controls.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n------------------- WebGL -----------------------------\r\nCopyright (c) 2018 The Khronos Group Inc.\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\r\ncopy of this software and/or associated documentation files (the\r\n\"Materials\"), to deal in the Materials without restriction, including\r\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\r\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Materials, and to\r\npermit persons to whom the Materials are furnished to do so, subject to\r\nthe following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included\r\nin all copies or substantial portions of the Materials.\r\n\r\nTHE MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\r\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\r\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\r\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\r\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\r\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\r\nMATERIALS OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE MATERIALS.\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n------------- End of ThirdPartyNotices ------------------------------------------- */\r\n\r\n"
