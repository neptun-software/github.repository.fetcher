All minimum browser versions listed above support the Web Animations API.\n\n<h2 id=\"version-8x-dark-mode\">Dark Mode</h2>\n\n\nIn previous versions, it was recommended to define the dark palette in the following way:\n\n```css\n@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n  body {\n    /* global app variables */\n  }\n\n  .ios body {\n    /* global ios app variables */\n  }\n\n  .md body {\n    /* global md app variables */\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn Ionic Framework version 8, the dark palette is being distributed via css files that can be imported. Below is an example of importing a dark palette file in Angular:\n\n```css\n/* @import '@ionic/angular/css/palettes/dark.always.css'; */\n/* @import \"@ionic/angular/css/palettes/dark.class.css\"; */\n@import \"@ionic/angular/css/palettes/dark.system.css\";\n```\n\nBy importing the `dark.system.css` file, the dark palette variables will be defined like the following:\n\n```css\n@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n  :root {\n    /* global app variables */\n  }\n\n  :root.ios {\n    /* global ios app variables */\n  }\n\n  :root.md {\n    /* global md app variables */\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNotice that the dark palette is now applied to the `:root` selector instead of the `body` selector. The [`:root`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:root) selector represents the `<html>` element and is identical to the selector `html`, except that its specificity is higher.\n\nWhile migrating to include the new dark palette files is unlikely to cause breaking changes, these new selectors can lead to unexpected overrides if custom CSS variables are being set on the `body` element. We recommend updating any instances where global application variables are set to target the `:root` selector instead.\n\nFor more information on the new dark palette files, refer to the [Dark Mode documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/theming/dark-mode).\n\n<h2 id=\"version-8x-global-styles\">Global Styles</h2>\n\n<h4 id=\"version-8x-text-color\">Text Color</h4>\n\nThe `core.css` file has been updated to set the text color on the `body` element:\n\n```diff\nbody {\n+  color: var(--ion-text-color);\n}\n```\n\nThis allows components to inherit the color properly when used outside of Ionic Framework and is required for custom themes to work properly. However, it may have unintentional side effects in apps if the color was not expected to inherit.\n\n<h4 id=\"version-8x-dynamic-font\">Dynamic Font</h4>\n\nThe `core.css` file has been updated to enable dynamic font scaling by default.\n\nThe `--ion-default-dynamic-font` variable has been removed and replaced with `--ion-dynamic-font`.\n\nDevelopers who had previously chosen dynamic font scaling by activating it in their global stylesheets can revert to the default setting by removing their custom CSS. In doing so, their application will seamlessly continue utilizing dynamic font scaling as it did before. It's essential to note that altering the font-size of the html element should be avoided, as it may disrupt the proper functioning of dynamic font scaling.\n\nDevelopers who want to disable dynamic font scaling can set `--ion-dynamic-font: initial;` in their global stylesheets. However, this is not recommended because it may introduce accessibility challenges for users who depend on enlarged font sizes.\n\nFor more information on the dynamic font, refer to the [Dynamic Font Scaling documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/layout/dynamic-font-scaling).\n\n<h2 id=\"version-8x-haptics\">Haptics</h2>\n\n- Support for the Cordova Haptics plugin has been removed. Components that integrate with haptics, such as `ion-picker` and `ion-toggle`, will continue to function but will no longer play haptics in Cordova environments. Developers should migrate to Capacitor to continue to have haptics in these components.\n\n<h2 id=\"version-8x-components\">Components</h2>\n\n<h4 id=\"version-8x-button\">Button</h4>\n\n- Button text now wraps by default. If this behavior is not desired, add the `ion-text-nowrap` class from the [CSS Utilities](https://ionicframework.com/docs/layout/css-utilities).\n\n<h4 id=\"version-8x-checkbox\">Checkbox</h4>\n\n The `legacy` property and support for the legacy syntax, which involved placing an `ion-checkbox` inside of an `ion-item` with an `ion-label`, have been removed. For more information on migrating from the legacy checkbox syntax, refer to the [Checkbox documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/checkbox#migrating-from-legacy-checkbox-syntax).\n\n<h4 id=\"version-8x-content\">Content</h4>\n\n- Content no longer sets the `--background` custom property when the `.outer-content` class is set on the host.\n\n<h4 id=\"version-8x-datetime\">Datetime</h4>\n\n- The CSS shadow part for `month-year-button` has been changed to target a `button` element instead of `ion-item`. Developers should verify their UI renders as expected for the month/year toggle button inside of `ion-datetime`.\n   - Developers using the CSS variables available on `ion-item` will need to migrate their CSS to use CSS properties. For example:\n      ```diff\n      ion-datetime::part(month-year-button) {\n      -  --background: red;\n\n      +  background: red;\n      }\n      ```\n\n<h4 id=\"version-8x-input\">Input</h4>\n\n- `size` has been removed from the `ion-input` component. Developers should use CSS to specify the visible width of the input.\n- `accept` has been removed from the `ion-input` component. This was previously used in conjunction with the `type=\"file\"`. However, the `file` value for `type` is not a valid value in Ionic Framework.\n- The `legacy` property and support for the legacy syntax, which involved placing an `ion-input` inside of an `ion-item` with an `ion-label`, have been removed. For more information on migrating from the legacy input syntax, refer to the [Input documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/input#migrating-from-legacy-input-syntax).\n\n<h4 id=\"version-8x-item\">Item</h4>\n\n- The `helper` slot has been removed. Developers should use the `helperText` property on `ion-input` and `ion-textarea`.\n- The `error` slot has been removed. Developers should use the `errorText` property on `ion-input` and `ion-textarea`.\n- Counter functionality has been removed including the `counter` and `counterFormatter` properties. Developers should use the properties of the same name on `ion-input` and `ion-textarea`.\n- The `fill` property has been removed. Developers should use the property of the same name on `ion-input`, `ion-select`, and `ion-textarea`.\n- The `shape` property has been removed. Developers should use the property of the same name on `ion-input`, `ion-select`, and `ion-textarea`.\n- Item no longer automatically delegates focus to the first focusable element. While most developers should not need to make any changes to account for this update, usages of `ion-item` with interactive elements such as form controls (inputs, textareas, etc) should be evaluated to verify that interactions still work as expected.\n\n<h5>CSS variables</h4>\n\nThe following deprecated CSS variables have been removed: `--highlight-height`, `--highlight-color-focused`, `--highlight-color-valid`, and `--highlight-color-invalid`. These variables were used on the bottom border highlight of an item when the form control inside of that item was focused. The form control syntax was [simplified in v7](https://ionic.io/blog/ionic-7-is-here#simplified-form-control-syntax) so that inputs, selects, and textareas would no longer be required to be used inside of an item.\n\nIf you have not yet migrated to the modern form control syntax, migration guides for each of the form controls that added a highlight to item can be found below:\n- [Input migration documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/input#migrating-from-legacy-input-syntax)\n- [Select migration documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/select#migrating-from-legacy-select-syntax)\n- [Textarea migration documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/textarea#migrating-from-legacy-textarea-syntax)\n\nOnce all form controls are using the modern syntax, the same variables can be used to customize them from the form control itself:\n\n| Name                        | Description                             |\n| ----------------------------| ----------------------------------------|\n| `--highlight-color-focused` | The color of the highlight when focused |\n| `--highlight-color-invalid` | The color of the highlight when invalid |\n| `--highlight-color-valid`   | The color of the highlight when valid   |\n| `--highlight-height`        | The height of the highlight indicator   |\n\nThe following styles for item:\n\n```css\nion-item {\n  --highlight-color-focused: purple;\n  --highlight-color-valid: blue;\n  --highlight-color-invalid: orange;\n  --highlight-height: 6px;\n}\n```\n\nwill instead be applied on the form controls:\n\n```css\nion-input,\nion-textarea,\nion-select {\n  --highlight-color-focused: purple;\n  --highlight-color-valid: blue;\n  --highlight-color-invalid: orange;\n  --highlight-height: 6px;\n}\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The input and textarea components are scoped, which means they will automatically scope their CSS by appending each of the styles with an additional class at runtime. Overriding scoped selectors in CSS requires a [higher specificity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity) selector. Targeting the `ion-input` or `ion-textarea` for customization will not work; therefore we recommend adding a class and customizing it that way.\n\n<h4 id=\"version-8x-modal\">Modal</h4>\n\n- Detection for Capacitor <= 2 with applying status bar styles has been removed. Developers should ensure they are using Capacitor 3 or later when using the card modal presentation.\n\n<h4 id=\"version-8x-nav\">Nav</h4>\n\n- `getLength` returns `Promise<number>` instead of `<number>`. This method was not previously available in Nav's TypeScript interface, but developers could still access it by casting Nav as `any`. Developers should ensure they `await` their `getLength` call before accessing the returned value.\n\n<h4 id=\"version-8x-picker\">Picker</h4>\n\n- `ion-picker` and `ion-picker-column` have been renamed to `ion-picker-legacy` and `ion-picker-legacy-column`, respectively. This change was made to accommodate the new inline picker component while allowing developers to continue to use the legacy picker during this migration period.\n  - Only the component names have been changed. Usages such as `ion-picker` or `IonPicker` should be changed to `ion-picker-legacy` and `IonPickerLegacy`, respectively.\n  - Non-component usages such as `pickerController` or `useIonPicker` remain unchanged. The new picker displays inline with your page content and does not have equivalents for these non-component usages.\n\n<h4 id=\"version-8x-progress-bar\">Progress bar</h4>\n\n- The `--buffer-background` CSS variable has been removed. Use `--background` instead.\n\n<h4 id=\"version-8x-toast\">Toast</h4>\n\n- `cssClass` has been removed from the `ToastButton` interface. This was previously used to apply a custom class to the toast buttons. Developers can use the \"button\" shadow part to style the buttons.\n\nFor more information on styling toast buttons, refer to the [Toast Theming documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/toast#theming).\n\n<h4 id=\"version-8x-radio\">Radio</h4>\n\n- The `legacy` property and support for the legacy syntax, which involved placing an `ion-radio` inside of an `ion-item` with an `ion-label`, have been removed. For more information on migrating from the legacy radio syntax, refer to the [Radio documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/radio#migrating-from-legacy-radio-syntax).\n\n<h4 id=\"version-8x-range\">Range</h4>\n\n- The `legacy` property and support for the legacy syntax, which involved placing an `ion-range` inside of an `ion-item` with an `ion-label`, have been removed. Ionic will also no longer attempt to automatically associate form controls with sibling `<label>` elements as these label elements are now used inside the form control. Developers should provide a label (either visible text or `aria-label`) directly to the form control. For more information on migrating from the legacy range syntax, refer to the [Range documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/range#migrating-from-legacy-range-syntax).\n\n<h4 id=\"version-8x-searchbar\">Searchbar</h4>\n\n- The `autocapitalize` property now defaults to `'off'`.\n\n<h4 id=\"version-8x-select\">Select</h4>\n\n- The `legacy` property and support for the legacy syntax, which involved placing an `ion-select` inside of an `ion-item` with an `ion-label`, have been removed. Ionic will also no longer attempt to automatically associate form controls with sibling `<label>` elements as these label elements are now used inside the form control. Developers should provide a label (either visible text or `aria-label`) directly to the form control. For more information on migrating from the legacy select syntax, refer to the [Select documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/select#migrating-from-legacy-select-syntax).\n\n<h4 id=\"version-8x-textarea\">Textarea</h4>\n\n- The `legacy` property and support for the legacy syntax, which involved placing an `ion-textarea` inside of an `ion-item` with an `ion-label`, have been removed. For more information on migrating from the legacy textarea syntax, refer to the [Textarea documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/textarea#migrating-from-legacy-textarea-syntax).\n\n<h4 id=\"version-8x-toggle\">Toggle</h4>\n\n- The `legacy` property and support for the legacy syntax, which involved placing an `ion-toggle` inside of an `ion-item` with an `ion-label`, have been removed. For more information on migrating from the legacy toggle syntax, refer to the [Toggle documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/toggle#migrating-from-legacy-toggle-syntax).\n\n<h2 id=\"version-8x-framework-specific\">Framework Specific</h2>\n\n<h4 id=\"version-8x-angular\">Angular</h4>\n\n- The `IonBackButtonDelegate` class has been removed in favor of `IonBackButton`.\n\n  ```diff\n  - import { IonBackButtonDelegate } from '@ionic/angular';\n  + import { IonBackButton } from '@ionic/angular';\n  ```\n"

BREAKING CHANGES\n\n* **range:** The `legacy` property and support for the legacy syntax, which involved placing an `ion-range` inside of an `ion-item` with an `ion-label`, have been removed from range. For more information on migrating from the legacy range syntax, refer to the [Range documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/range#migrating-from-legacy-range-syntax).\n* **checkbox:** The `legacy` property and support for the legacy syntax, which involved placing an `ion-checkbox` inside of an `ion-item` with an `ion-label`, have been removed from checkbox. For more information on migrating from the legacy checkbox syntax, refer to the [Checkbox documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/checkbox#migrating-from-legacy-checkbox-syntax).\n* **radio:** The `legacy` property and support for the legacy syntax, which involved placing an `ion-radio` inside of an `ion-item` with an `ion-label`, have been removed from radio. For more information on migrating from the legacy radio syntax, refer to the [Radio documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/radio#migrating-from-legacy-radio-syntax).\n* **toggle:** The `legacy` property and support for the legacy syntax, which involved placing an `ion-toggle` inside of an `ion-item` with an `ion-label`, have been removed from toggle. For more information on migrating from the legacy toggle syntax, refer to the [Toggle documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/toggle#migrating-from-legacy-toggle-syntax).\n* **toast:** The `cssClass` property has been removed from `ToastButton`\n* **input:** The `accept` property has been removed from `ion-input`.\n* **nav:** `getLength` returns `Promise<number>` instead of `<number>`. This method was not previously available in Nav's TypeScript interface, but developers could still access it by casting Nav as `any`. Developers should ensure they `await` their `getLength` call before accessing the returned value.\n* **button:** Button text now wraps by default.\n* Content no longer sets the `--background` custom property when the `.outer-content` class is set on the host.\n* **breaking:** The supported JS Framework and Browser/Platform versions have been revised for Ionic 8\n\n\n\n\n\n##

BREAKING CHANGES\n\n* **config:** The supported version of Firefox for Ionic v7 has changed to Firefox v70+\n* **input, searchbar, select, textarea:** The default value for the `--placeholder-opacity` CSS Variable on `ion-input`, `ion-searchbar`, `ion-select`, and `ion-textarea` has been updated to `0.6`.\n* **select:** The `icon` CSS Shadow Part for `ion-select` now targets an `ion-icon` component.\n* **datetime:** The haptics when swiping the wheel picker are now enabled only on iOS.\n* **toggle:** The `--background` and `--background-checked` variables have been renamed to `--track-background` and `--track-background-checked`, respectively.\n* **angular:** Datetime:\n\nPassing the empty string to the `value` property will now error as it is not a valid ISO-8601 value.\n\nAngular:\n\n`null` values on form components will no longer be converted to the empty string (`''`) or `false`. This impacts `ion-checkbox`, `ion-datetime`, `ion-input`, `ion-radio`, `ion-radio-group`, ion-range`, `ion-searchbar`, `ion-segment`, `ion-select`, `ion-textarea`, and `ion-toggle`.\n* **picker:** The `refresh` key has been removed from the `PickerColumn` interface. Developers should use the `columns` property to refresh the `ion-picker` view.\n* **input, textarea:** The `detail` payload for the `ionInput` event on `ion-input` and `ion-textarea` now contains an object with the current `value` as well as the native event that triggered `ionInput`.\n* **datetime:** Datetime no longer incorrectly reports the time zone when `value` is updated. Datetime does not manage time zones, so any time zone information provided is ignored.\n* **types:** `ActionSheetAttributes`, `AlertAttributes`, `AlertTextareaAttributes`, `AlertInputAttributes`, `LoadingAttributes`, `ModalAttributes`, `PickerAttributes`, `PopoverAttributes`, and `ToastAttributes` have been removed. Developers should use `{ [key: string]: any }` instead.\n* **card-header:** - The card header has ben changed to a flex container with direction set to `column` (top to bottom). In `ios` mode the direction is set to `column-reverse` which results in the subtitle displaying on top of the title.\n* **accordion-group:** Accordion Group no longer automatically adjusts the `value` property when passed an array and `multiple=\"false\"`. Developers should update their apps to ensure they are using the API correctly.\n* **select:** `ionChange` is no longer emitted when the `value` of `ion-select` is modified externally. `ionChange` is only emitted from user committed changes, such as confirming a selected option in the select's overlay.\n* **react:** `@ionic/react` and `@ionic/react-router` no longer ship a CommonJS entry point. Instead, only an ES Module entry point is provided for improved compatibility with Vite.\n* **vue:** `@ionic/vue` and `@ionic/vue-router` no longer ship a CommonJS entry point. Instead, only an ES Module entry point is provided for improved compatibility with Vite.\n* **modal:** - The `swipeToClose` property has been removed in favor of `canDismiss`.\n- The `canDismiss` property now defaults to `true` and can no longer be set to `undefined`.\n* **checkbox:** `ionChange` is no longer emitted when the `checked` property of `ion-checkbox` is modified externally. `ionChange` is only emitted from user committed changes, such as clicking or tapping the checkbox.\n* **accordion:** `ionChange` is no longer emitted when the `value` of `ion-accordion-group` is modified externally. `ionChange` is only emitted from user committed changes, such as clicking or tapping the accordion header.\n* **core:** The `[hidden]` attribute has been removed from Ionic's global stylesheet. The `[hidden]` attribute can continue to be used, but developers will get the [native `hidden` implementation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/hidden) instead. The main difference is that the native implementation is easier to override using `display` than Ionic's implementation.\n\nDevelopers can add the following CSS to their global stylesheet if they need the old behavior:\n\n```css\n[hidden] {\n  display: none !important;\n}\n```\n* **overlays:** Ionic now listens on the `keydown` event instead of the `keyup` event when determining when to dismiss overlays via the \"Escape\" key. Any applications that were listening on `keyup` to suppress this behavior should listen on `keydown` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n##
