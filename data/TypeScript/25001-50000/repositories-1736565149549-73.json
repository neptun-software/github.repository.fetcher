By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\n    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.\n\n  Mikael Finstad, hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  LosslessCut.\n\n  Mikael Finstad, 26 Aug 2021\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.\n"

Or you can add a music or subtitle track to your video without needing to encode. Everything is extremely fast because it does an almost direct data copy, fueled by the awesome FFmpeg which does all the grunt work.\n\n## Features\n- Lossless cutting of most video and audio formats\n- [Smart cut](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/issues/126) (experimental)\n- Losslessly cut out parts of video/audio (for cutting away commercials etc.)\n- Losslessly rearrange the order of video/audio segments\n- Lossless merge/concatenation of arbitrary files (with identical codecs parameters, e.g. from the same camera)\n- Lossless stream editing\n  - Combine arbitrary tracks from multiple files (ex. add music or subtitle track to a video file)\n  - Remove unneeded tracks\n  - Replace or re-encode only some tracks\n  - Extract all tracks from a file (extract video, audio, subtitle, attachments and other tracks from one file into separate files)\n- Fast multi-file workflow (note: no mass/batch export yet)\n- Keyboard shortcut workflow\n- Losslessly remux video/audio into a different container (file) format\n- Take full-resolution snapshots from videos in JPEG/PNG format (low or high quality)\n- Export ranges of video frames to images (every nth frame, second, by scene change, best thumbnails)\n  - Export only from a selected time range (segment)\n  - Optionally include original timestamps in image file names\n- Manual input of cutpoint times\n- Apply a per-file timecode offset (and auto load timecode from file)\n- Edit file metadata, per-track metadata and per-track disposition\n- Change rotation/orientation metadata in videos\n- View technical data about all tracks\n- Timeline zoom and frame/keyframe jumping for cutting around keyframes\n- Video thumbnails and audio waveform\n- Saves per project cut segments to project file\n- View FFmpeg last command log so you can modify and re-run recent commands on the command line\n- Undo/redo\n- Give labels to cut segments\n- Annotate segments with tags\n- [Import/export](import-export.md) segments: MP4/MKV chapter marks, Text file, YouTube, CSV, CUE, XML (DaVinci, Final Cut Pro) and more\n- MKV/MP4 embedded chapters marks editor\n- View subtitles\n- Customizable keyboard hotkeys\n- Black scene detection, silent audio detection, and scene change detection\n- Divide timeline into segments with length L or into N segments or even randomized segments!\n- Speed up / slow down video or audio file ([changing FPS](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/issues/1712))\n- Basic [CLI](cli.md) and [HTTP API](api.md)\n- Show (DJI) embedded GPS track on a map\n- Losslessly Download videos over HTTP (e.g. HLS `.m3u8`)\n\n## Example lossless use cases\n\n- Cut out commercials from a recorded TV show (and re-format from TS to MP4)\n- Remove audio tracks from a file\n- Extract music track from a video and cut it to your needs\n- Add music to a video (or replace existing audio track)\n- Combine audio and video tracks from separate recordings\n- Include an external subtitle into a video\n- Quickly change a H264/H265 MKV video to MOV or MP4 for playback on iPhone\n- Import a list of cut times from other tool as a EDL (edit decision list, CSV) and run these cuts with LosslessCut\n- Export a list of cut times as a CSV EDL and process these in another tool\n- Quickly cut a file by its MP4/MKV chapters\n- Quickly cut a [YouTube video](https://youtube-dl.org/) by its chapters (or music times from a comment)\n- Change the language of a file's audio/subtitle tracks\n- Attach cover art / thumbnail to videos / audio from an external JPEG file or from a frame on the timeline\n- Change author, title, GPS position, recording time of a video\n- Fix rotation of a video that has the wrong orientation flag set\n  - Great for rotating phone videos that come out the wrong way without actually re-encoding the video.\n- Loop a video / audio clip X times quickly without re-encoding\n  - See [#284](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/issues/284)\n- Convert a video or parts of it into X image files (not lossless)\n- Losslessly split a video into one file per scene (note you probably have to shift segments, see [#330](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/issues/330).)\n- Cut away silent parts of an audio/video\n- Split video into segments to for example respect Twitter's 140 second limit\n- Annotate each segment with one or more tags, then use those tags to organize your segments or use it to create an output folder structure or hierarchy for your segments.\n\n### Export cut times as YouTube Chapters\n1. Export with Merge and \"Create chapters from merged segments\" enabled\n2. Open the exported file and select \"Import chapters\" in the dialog\n3. File -> Export project -> YouTube Chapters\n\n### Re-encode only the audio track, keeping the lossless video track\n\nFirst export each track as individual files. Then use Handbrake or similar to re-encode the audio file (if mp4 file, encode as AAC.) Then open the extracted video stream in LosslessCut. The open your encoded audio file and select \"Include all tracks from the new file\". Then export.\n\n### Advanced multi-step workflows\n\n**Tip:** you can use LosslessCut in multiple passes in order to achieve separate trimming of individual tracks:\n1. Open a file an export all tracks as individual files\n2. Open the exported track files independently and cut them as desired\n3. Add the track back to the video and combine them to one output video\n\n## Download\n\nIf you want to support my continued work on LosslessCut, and you want the advantage of a secure and simple installation process with automatic, stable updates, consider getting it from your favorite store:\n\n<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/id1505323402\"><img src=\"mac-app-store-badge.svg\" alt=\"Mac App Store\" height=\"50\"/></a> <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9P30LSR4705L?cid=storebadge&ocid=badge\"><img src=\"ms-store-badge.svg\" alt=\"MS badge\" height=\"50\"/></a>\n\nFor Linux these are some alternatives:\n\n<a href=\"https://snapcraft.io/losslesscut\"><img src=\"https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/raw/master/snap-store-black.svg?sanitize=true\" alt=\"Snapcraft\" height=\"50\"/></a> <a href=\"https://flathub.org/apps/details/no.mifi.losslesscut\"><img src=\"https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/raw/master/flathub-badge.svg?sanitize=true\" alt=\"Flathub\" height=\"50\"/></a>\n\nIf you prefer to download the executables manually, this will of course always be free:\n\n- Mac OS X: [Intel DMG](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/releases/latest/download/LosslessCut-mac-x64.dmg) / [Apple Silicon DMG](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/releases/latest/download/LosslessCut-mac-arm64.dmg) (note that universal.pkg **does not work**)\n- Windows: [7zip](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/releases/latest/download/LosslessCut-win-x64.7z) (Windows 7, 8 and 8.1 is [no longer supported](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/discussions/1476) after [v3.50.0](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/releases/tag/v3.50.0))\n- Linux: [x64 tar.bz2](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/releases/latest/download/LosslessCut-linux-x64.tar.bz2) / [x64 AppImage](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/releases/latest/download/LosslessCut-linux-x86_64.AppImage) / [arm64 tar.bz2](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/releases/latest/download/LosslessCut-linux-arm64.tar.bz2) / [Raspberry Pi armv7l](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/releases/latest/download/LosslessCut-linux-armv7l.tar.bz2)\n- [More releases](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/releases) (note that APPX for Windows and PKG for MacOS **do not work**)\n- [Download latest nightly builds 🧪](https://mifi.no/llc/nightly/).\n\nIf you find LosslessCut useful, I'm very thankful for [your support](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut#donate-).\n\nWhat's the **difference between App Stores and GitHub download?** [Please see FAQ](issues.md#app-stores-and-github-difference)\n\n## [Supported operating systems](./requirements.md)\n\n## Supported formats\n\nLosslessCut uses Chromium's HTML5 video player, and not all FFmpeg supported formats and codecs are natively supported. Generally, the following formats should work: `MP4`, `MOV`, `WebM`, `Matroska`, `OGG` and `WAV`. The following audio codecs: `FLAC`, `MP3`, `Opus`, `PCM`, `Vorbis` and `AAC`. Video codecs: `H264`, `AV1`, `Theora`, `VP8`, `VP9` and `H265` (needs hardware decoder). More information about [Chromium supported formats / codecs](https://www.chromium.org/audio-video). [What's the difference between a codec and a format?](./issues.md#primer-video--audio-formats-vs-codecs)\n\nCodecs and formats not listed above can still be converted to a supported format/codec from the `File` menu. (Try the `fastest` option first.) A low quality version of the file (with/without audio) will then be created and opened in the player. The actual cut/export operation will still be performed on the original file, so it will be lossless. This allows for potentially opening any file that FFmpeg is able to decode.\n\n## Video demos\n\n- [Common features](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYHMxXy05Jg)\n- [How to add a thumbnail / cover art to an MP4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pYJ93cn80E)\n- [How to add multi-language audio to a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRBGDsuw_WU)\n- **Your video here?** If you would like to make a video showing off LosslessCut use cases, let me know and I can link it here!\n\n### Typical workflow\n\n- Drag drop a video file into player or use <kbd>⌘</kbd>/<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd>.\n- Press <kbd>SPACE</kbd> to play/pause or <kbd>◀</kbd><kbd>▶</kbd>, <kbd>,</kbd><kbd>.</kbd> or mouse/trackpad wheel to seek back/forth.\n- Select the cut segment's start and end time by moving the time marker and then pressing <kbd>I</kbd> to set start time, and <kbd>O</kbd> to set end time.\n  - Note that all segments you create will be **preserved** and exported as new files. You can change this behavior with the **Yin Yang** symbol ☯️, in which case it will instead **remove** all selected segments and export the parts **between** segments.\n  - Note also that start times will not be accurate, see [Known issues](issues.md)\n- *(optional)* If you want to add more than one segment, move to the desired start time and press <kbd>+</kbd>, then select the next segment start/end times with <kbd>I</kbd>/<kbd>O</kbd>.\n- *(optional)* If you want to re-merge all the selected segments into one file after cutting, toggle the button `Separate files` to `Merge cuts`.\n- *(optional)* If you want to export to a certain output folder, press the `Working dir unset` button (default: Input file folder)\n- *(optional)* If you want to change orientation, press the **rotation** button\n- *(optional)* By default, audio, video and subtitle tracks from the input file will be cut and exported. Press the `Tracks` button to customise and/or add new tracks from other files.\n- *(optional)* select a new output format\n- *(optional)* In the right-hand segments panel, right click a segment for options, or drag-drop to reorder. Segments will appear in this order in the merged output.\n- **When done, press the `Export` button (or <kbd>E</kbd>) to show an overview with export options.**\n- *(optional)* adjust any export options\n- **Then press `Export` again to confirm the export**\n- Press the **Camera** button (or <kbd>C</kbd>) if you want to take a JPEG/PNG snapshot from the current time\n- If you want to move the original file to trash, press the **trash** button\n- For best results you may need to trial and error with another output format (Matroska takes nearly everything), change keyframe cut mode or disable some tracks (see [known issues](issues.md)).\n- Press <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd> to view all keyboard & mouse shortcuts.\n- **Note:** The original video file will not be modified. Instead, a file is created file in the same directory as the original file with from/to timestamps in the file name.\n\n## [Installation](./installation.md)\n\n## [Import / export](import-export.md)\n\n## [Command line interface (CLI)](cli.md) & [HTTP API](api.md)\n\n## [Known issues, limitations, troubleshooting, FAQ](issues.md)\n\n## [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n## [Translation](translation.md)\n\nIf you have any problem or question, [please read this](issues.md) before creating an issue.

          "content": "# Batch processing ⏩\n\nI get a lot of questions about whether LosslessCut can help automate the same operation on X number of files. For example given a folder of 100 files, cut off 10 seconds from the beginning of every file. LosslessCut can generally not do this, however the good news is that often it's not very hard to automate with a simple script.\n\nSee also [#868](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/issues/868).\n\n## Setup FFmpeg 📀\n\nFirst you need to [download and install FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) on your computer. Make sure you install it properly so that you can open a Bash terminal (Linux/macOS) or Console (Windows) and type the command `ffmpeg` (or `ffmpeg.exe` on Windows) and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. It should then print out something like this:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg version 7.1 Copyright (c) 2000-2024 the FFmpeg developers\n```\n\nIf you cannot get it working, there here are lots of resources online on how to do this. Or you can ask an AI (for example ChatGPT) to assist you.\n\n## Create your script 📜\n\nMake a file `myscript.sh` (macOS/Linux) or `myscript.bat` (Windows) and edit it with a plain text editor like `nano` or Notepad.\n\nIf there's a particular operation from LosslessCut you want to automate across multiple files, you can find the command from the \"Last FFmpeg commands\" page. Then copy paste this command into your script. Note: if you're on Windows, the command might have to be altered slightly to be compatible (you can use an AI for this).\n\n## Using AI 🤖\n\nI wish more people were aware of this: large language models like ChatGPT can be incredibly useful for helping non-programmers with simple scripting tasks as well as helping you learn things, and it's free! Basically you just ask the AI to write a script for you to do whatever you need. If it doesn't work, you can continue the conversation with the AI and give it the error messages you received and it will try to help your get it working.\n\nStart your sentence with your operating system, e.g. \"I am using Windows 10\", then try to be so exact and concise as possible to describe what kind of files you have and what you want to do with them to the AI using FFmpeg. Example prompt:\n\n> I am on macOS. Please help me write a script that for each *.mp4 file in a specified folder, losslessly removes the first 10 seconds from each file? Also how do I run the script? The files are inside the folder `/Users/user/my-files`. I have FFmpeg installed and running as `ffmpeg`.\n\n### Action from LosslessCut\n\nIf there's a particular operation from LosslessCut you want to automate, you can find the command from the \"Last FFmpeg commands\" page. Then copy it and paste it into your AI prompt. For example:\n\n> I am on Windows 11. I have this (UNIX bash) command: `ffmpeg -hide_banner -i 'C:\\path\\to\\input.mp4' -map '0:1' -c copy -f adts -y 'c:\\path\\to\\lofoten-stream-1-audio-aac.aac'`, that I want to run automatically on every *.mp4 file in a specified folder. Please help me write a script that achieves this. The files are inside the folder `C:\\path\\to\\folder`. I have FFmpeg installed and running as `ffmpeg.exe`.\n\nIf you are on Windows and what you want to do is more complex, it might be a good idea to instruct the AI to use PowerShell instead of Batch.\n\n### More examples\n\nSplit files into equal length segments:\n\n> Write a script that takes a folder of *.mp4 files, then for each file, split it into an (unknown) number of files, each file of an equal length of approximately 299 seconds.\n\nBatch rotate all files to 90 degrees:\n\n> Write a script that takes a folder of *.mp4 files, then for each file, losslessly change the rotation to 90 degrees and output to the same folder.\n"

See also [HTTP API](./api.md).\n\n```bash\nLosslessCut [options] [files]\n```\n\nNote that these examples assume that you have set up the LosslessCut executable to be available in your `PATH` (command line environment). Alternatively you can run it like this:\n\n```bash\n# First navigate to the folder containing the LosslessCut app\ncd /path/to/directory/containing/app\n# Then run it\n# On Linux:\n./LosslessCut arguments\n# On Windows:\n./LosslessCut.exe arguments\n# On MacOS:\n./LosslessCut.app/Contents/MacOS/LosslessCut arguments\n```\n\n## Open one or more files:\n```bash\nLosslessCut file1.mp4 file2.mkv\n```\n\n## Override settings (experimental)\nSee [available settings](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/blob/master/src/main/configStore.ts). Note that this is subject to change in newer versions. ⚠️ If you specify incorrect values it could corrupt your configuration file. You may use JSON or JSON5. Example:\n```bash\nLosslessCut --settings-json '{captureFormat:\"jpeg\", \"keyframeCut\":true}'\n```\n\n## Other options\n\n- `--locales-path` Customise path to locales (useful for [translators](./translation.md)).\n- `--disable-networking` Turn off all network requests.\n- `--http-api` Start the [HTTP server with an API](./api.md) to control LosslessCut, optionally specifying a port (default `8080`).\n- `--keyboard-action` Run a keyboard action (see below.)\n- `--config-dir` Path to a directory where the `config.json` file will be stored and loaded from. Note: don't include `config.json` in the path (only the directory containing it).\n\n## Controlling a running instance (experimental)\n\nIf you have the \"Allow multiple instances\" setting enabled, you can control a running instance of LosslessCut from the outside, using for example a command line. You do this by issuing messages to it through the `LosslessCut` command. Currently only keyboard actions are supported, and you can open files. *Note that this is considered experimental and the API may change at any time.*\n\n### Keyboard actions, `--keyboard-action`\n\nSimulate a keyboard press action in an already running instance of LosslessCut. Note that the command will return immediately, so if you want to run multiple actions in a sequence, you have to `sleep` for a few seconds between the commands. Alternatively if you want to wait until an action has finished processing, you can use the [HTTP API](./api.md) instead. Note that the HTTP API does not support opening files, and it is currently not possible to wait for a file to have finished opening.\n\n### Available keyboard actions\n\nA list of the available action names can be found in the \"Keyboard shortcuts\" dialog in the app. Note that you don't have to bind them to any key before using them.\n\nExample:\n\n```bash\n# Open a file in an already running instance\nLosslessCut file.mp4\nsleep 3 # hopefully the file has loaded by now\n# Export the currently opened file\nLosslessCut --keyboard-action export\n```\n\n### Open files in running instance\n\n```bash\nLosslessCut file1.mp4 file2.mkv\n```\n"

          "content": "# Import / Export\n\n## Customising exported file names\n\nWhen exporting multiple segments as separate files, LosslessCut offers you the ability to specify how the output files will be named in sequence using a *template string*. The template string is evaluated as a [JavaScript template string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals), so you can use JavaScript syntax inside of it. The following variables are available in the template to customize the filenames:\n\n| Avail when merging? | Variable | Output |\n| - | - | - |\n| ✅ | `${FILENAME}` | The original filename *without the extension* (e.g. `Beach Trip` for a file named `Beach Trip.mp4`).\n| ✅ | `${EXT}` | The extension of the file (e.g.: `.mp4`, `.mkv`).\n| ✅ | `${EPOCH_MS}` | Number of milliseconds since epoch (e.g. `1680852771465`). Useful to generate a unique file name on every export to prevent accidental overwrite.\n| | `${SEG_NUM}` | Number of the segment, padded string (e.g. `01`, `02` or `42`).\n| | `${SEG_NUM_INT}` | Number of the segment, as a raw integer (e.g. `1`, `2` or `42`). Can be used with numeric arithmetics, e.g. `${SEG_NUM_INT+100}`.\n| | `${SEG_LABEL}` | The label of the segment (e.g. `Getting_Lunch`).\n| | `${SEG_SUFFIX}` | If a label exists for this segment, the label will be used, prepended by `-`. Otherwise, the segment number prepended by `-seg` will be used (e.g. `-Getting_Lunch`, `-seg1`).\n| | `${CUT_FROM}` | The timestamp for the beginning of the segment in `hh.mm.ss.sss` format (e.g. `00.00.27.184`).\n| | `${CUT_TO}` | The timestamp for the ending of the segment in `hh.mm.ss.sss` format (e.g. `00.00.28.000`).\n| | `${SEG_TAGS.XX}` | Allows you to retrieve the tags for a given segment by name. If a tag is called foo, it can be accessed with `${SEG_TAGS.foo}`. Note that if the tag does not exist, it will return the text `undefined`. You can work around this as follows: `${SEG_TAGS.foo ?? ''}`\n\nYour files must always include at least one unique identifer (such as `${SEG_NUM}` or `${CUT_FROM}`), and it should end in `${EXT}` (or else players might not recognise the files). For instance, to achieve a filename sequence of `Beach Trip - 1.mp4`, `Beach Trip - 2.mp4`, `Beach Trip - 3.mp4`, your format should read `${FILENAME} - ${SEG_NUM}${EXT}`\n\n##  Export project formats\n\nLosslessCut also allows importing/exporting your project (segments) in a variety of file formats.\n\n### CSV\n\n- The CSV export/import function takes CSV files with one cut segment on each line. Each line contains three columns: `segment start`, `segment end`, `label`.\n- `segment start` and `segment end` are expressed in seconds or left empty. Empty `segment end` means segment ends at the duration of the video.\n- Use comma `,` to separate the fields (**not** semicolon `;`)\n\n#### example.csv\n```csv\n,56.9568,First segment starting at 0\n70,842.33,\"Another quoted label\"\n1234,,Last segment\n```\n\n### TSV\n\nSame as CSV but `<tab>` instead.\n\n### More formats?\n\nSee https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/issues/1340\n"

The app is just a compressed file that you download from [GitHub](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/releases) and extract. Then you run the executable contained within.\n- Windows: Download the `.7z` file and extract it using [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html).\n- MacOS: Mount the `dmg` and drag the app into your `Applications` folder.\n- Linux: Y'all know what to do ;)\n\n## Portable app?\n\nLosslessCut is **not** a portable app. If you install it from the Mac App Store or Microsoft Store, it is somewhat portable because it will be containerized by the operating system, so that when you uninstall the app there will most likely not be many traces of it left. You *can* however customise where settings are stored, see below.\n\n## Settings and temporary files\n\nSettings, logs and temporary cache files are stored in your [`appData`](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/app#appgetpathname) folder.\n\n### `appData` folder:\n\n| OS | Path | Notes |\n|-|-|-|\n| Windows | `%APPDATA%\\LosslessCut` | |\n| Windows (MS Store Version) | `C:\\Users\\%USERNAME%\\AppData\\Local\\Packages\\57275mifi.no.LosslessCut_eg8x93dt4dxje\\LocalCache\\Roaming\\LosslessCut` | [*Not sure](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/discussions/2167) |\n| MacOS | `~/Library/Application Support/LosslessCut` | |\n| MacOS (App Store version) | `~/Library/Containers/no.mifi.losslesscut/Data/Library/Application Support/LosslessCut` | |\n| Linux | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/LosslessCut` or `~/.config/LosslessCut` | |\n\n[What is Windows `%APPDATA%`?](https://superuser.com/questions/632891/what-is-appdata)\n\nSettings and keyboard actions are stored inside the `config.json` file inside your `appData` folder.\n\n### Custom `config.json` path\n\nOn Windows, if you create a `config.json` file with the contents `{}` next to the `LosslessCut.exe` file, LosslessCut will read/store settings from this file instead of the one inside `appData`. Note that other temporary files will still be stored in `appData`. Alternatively you can specify a custom path to a folder containing `config.json` by using the [CLI option](./cli.md) `--config-dir`. See also [#645](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/issues/645).\n\n## How to uninstall\n\nJust delete the folder/app that you extracted when you installed it.\n\nIf you want to also delete all settings, logs and caches, see [Settings and temporary files](#settings-and-temporary-files) above. See also [#2058](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/issues/).\n\n## Unofficial versions\n\nBecause LosslessCut is Open Source (GPL), there are many people and organizations who publish their own variant of LosslessCut for example portableapps.com. This is fine, however **I don't provide support for those versions**.\n"

          "content": "# FAQ\n\nPlease read this first:\n\n- **Q:** Can LosslessCut **crop, resize, stretch, mirror/flip, overlay text/images, watermark, blur, redact, reduce quality/re-encode, create GIF, slideshow, burn subtitles, color grading, fade/transition between video clips, fade/combine/mix/merge audio tracks or change audio volume**?\n  - **A:** No, these are all lossy operations (meaning you *have* to re-encode the file), but in the future I may start to implement such features. [See #372](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/issues/372). Related: [#643](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/issues/643).\n- **Q:** Is there a keyboard shortcut to do X?\n  - **A:** First check the Keyboard shortcuts dialog. If you cannot find your shortcut there, [see this issue.](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/issues/254)\n- **Q:** Can LosslessCut do the same batch conversion operation on multiple files?\n  - [**A:** Probably not, but you can probably do it! See here.](./batch.md)\n- **Q:** Can LosslessCut be automated using a CLI or API or do external post-processing?\n  - **A:** While it was never designed for advanced batching/automation, it does have a [basic CLI and a HTTP API](./cli.md). More info: [#980](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/issues/980) [#868](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/issues/868).\n- **Q:** How to *cut away* a middle part of a video?\n  - **A:** Enable \"advanced view\" and then click the Yin Yang symbol. It will invert the segments.\n- **Q:** When will you implement feature X?\n  - **A:** I have limited time and I have a lot of projects to work on, so I cannot promise any timeline. I will usually prioritize the issues with the most likes, [see here for a list of the most popular issues](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/issues/691).\n- **Q:** Is LosslessCut a portable app? Where is application data, settings and temp files stored?\n  - **A:** See LosslessCut is *not* a [portable app](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/issues/645). See [Installation and files](./installation.md).\n- **Q:** Can I export and replace the input file in-place?\n  - **A:** No, but you can export and automatically delete the input file.\n- **Q:** Can you publish through [winget](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/issues/1279), [Flatpak](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/pull/1813), [Docker](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/issues/1086) or other software mangers?\n  - **A:** In general I don't want to maintain more build systems, but I could be open to linking to externally maintained build systems.\n\n## App Stores and GitHub difference\n\nLosslessCut version in the App Stores is often a few versions behind the latest GitHub version, because I want to be sure that the new versions work perfectly before releasing in the App Stores. The GitHub version will contain new, untested features and may contain some bugs (even in existing functionality). I consider the newest GitHub versions to be a public \"beta\" test. Then, once I'm sure that the new version works well, I will release it in the App Stores as well to give a frictionless as possible experience for customers. They have exactly the same in-app features, except for a few platform limitations: Apple doesn't allow opening VOB files with App Store apps. Apple App Store apps run in a sandbox, and therefore need to prompt for output directory before allowing writing files.\n\n# Primer: Video & audio formats vs. codecs\n\nHere's a little primer about video and audio formats for those not familiar. A common mistake when dealing with audio and video files, is to confuse *formats*, *codecs*, and *file names*. In short: A file's media format is a *container* that holds one or more *codecs* (audio/video/subtitle) inside of it. For example `.mov` is a *container format*, and `H265`/`HEVC` is a *codec*. Some formats support only a few codecs inside of them, while others support more codecs. The most common formats are MP4/MOV (often `.mp4`,`.mov`,`.m4a`) and Matroska (often `.mkv`,`.mka`). Example: If you have a file named `My video.mp4`, this file most likely (but not necessarily) has the *format* `MP4`. Note that the extension of a file (in this case `.mp4`) doesn't really mean anything, and the file could in reality for example have the `MOV` format, or the extension could be `.txt`. Inside `My video.mp4` there are multiple tracks/streams, each with their own *codec*. In this example, let's say that it contains one `H264` track and one `AAC` track. In LosslessCut you can view and add/delete/modify these tracks.\n\n**Remuxing**: If you change the output format in LosslessCut and export a file, you are *remuxing* the tracks/codecs into a different container format. When you do this, the operation is in theory lossless, meaning you will not lose any codec data and the different tracks will remain exactly the same, even though the format is now different (but some format metadata might get lost due to incompatibilities between container formats). There are limitations: Some popular codecs like VP8 or VP9 are not supported in popular formats like MP4, and some popular formats like Matroska (`.mkv`) are not natively supported in popular video players like iPhone or QuickTime.\n\nIf you want to reduce the size of a file using LosslessCut you have to \"get rid of\" something, either:\n- Reduce the duration of the file (cut off start/end)\n- Remove one or more tracks/streams (e.g. remove an audio track that you don't need)\nOther than that you it's not possible convert a file losslessly to reduce its size, unless you re-encode and lose quality. For that, I recommend using a different tool like e.g. [HandBrake](https://handbrake.fr/).\n\nHere is a great introduction to audio/video: [howvideo.works](https://howvideo.works/).\n\n# Common / known issues & troubleshooting\n\n## The exported video has a problem\n\nIf the video exports successfully without any error from LosslessCut, but it does not look as expected when playing back, please try this:\n\n- Try both with *Keyframe cut mode* on and off (do not use `Smart Cut` if you have any problem).\n- Disable unnecessary tracks from the **Tracks panel**. First try to disable all tracks except the main track (e.g. video) and if that succeeds, then work your way by enabling more tracks and see which one is causing the problem. Sometimes LosslessCut (ffmpeg) is unable to cut certain tracks at all, and this could lead to a strange output (e.g. wrong output duration or black parts).\n- Select a different **output format** (`matroska` and `mov` support a lot of codecs.)\n- Try the same operation with a different file (same codec or different codec) and see whether it's a problem with just that one particular file.\n- Enable the **Experimental Flag** under **Settings** before trying again.\n\n## Cutting times are not accurate\n\nEach segment's *start cut time* normally (but not always) will be \"rounded\" to the nearest **previous** keyframe. This means that you often have to move the **start cut time** to **few frames after** the desired keyframe.\n- Lossless cutting is not an exact science. For some files, it just works. For others, you may need to trial and error to get the best cut. See [#330](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/issues/330)\n- Your mileage may vary when it comes to *Keyframe cut mode*. Most common video files need *Keyframe cut* enabled, but you may need to try both values. [ffmpeg](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Seeking) also has documentation about these two seek/cut modes. In `ffmpeg`, *Keyframe cut* corresponds to `-ss` *before* `-i`.\n- Try to change `avoid_negative_ts` (in export options).\n- Try also to set the **start**-cutpoint a few frames **before or after** the nearest keyframe (may also solve audio sync issues).\n- You may try to enable the new \"Smart cut\" mode to allow cutting between keyframes. However it is very experimental and may not work for many files.\n- Currently, the only way to review the exported file (to check the actual cutpoints) is to run the export (possibly with only one segment enabled to speed up) and then manually check the output file. See also [#1887](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/issues/1887)\n\n### Starts from wrong keyframe\n\nFor some files, when you place segment start cutpoints at keyframes, and you export, it will instead cut from the keyframe **before** the keyframe that you wanted. This is because with some videos, ffmpeg struggles to find the nearest previous keyframe, see [#1216](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/issues/1216). To workaround this, you can try to shift your segments' **start**-cutpoints forward by a few frames, so that ffmpeg correctly cuts from the *previous* keyframe. You can also enable the Export Option \"Shift all start times\" by +1, +2, +3 frames or so.\n\n- Menu: \"Edit\" -> \"Segments\" -> \"Shift all segments on timeline\"\n- Enter `00:00:00.200` (or a larger value if it doesn't help)\n- When asked about Start or End timestamps, Select **Start**\n\nThis will effectively shift all start times of segments by 6 frames (`6/30=0.2` for 30fps video).\n\n## Cut file has same length as input\n\nIf you cut a file, but the duration of the exported file is the same as input file's duration, try to disable all tracks except for the video track and see if that helps. Sometimes a file contains some tracks that LosslessCut is unable to cut. It will then leave them as is, while cutting the other tracks. This may lead to incorrect output duration. Try also changing `avoid_negative_ts` (in export options).\n\nIf you are trying to cut a FLAC file but your output has the same duration as input, you might have run into [this ffmpeg limitation](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/discussions/1320).\n\n## Merge / concat results in corrupt or broken parts\n\nThis can happen when trying to merge files that are not compatible. Make sure they have the exact same codec parameters before merging. If you are sure they are the same, you can try to first running each of the files separately through LosslessCut before merging the outputs:\n1. First open each file separately and just export without cutting anything\n  - Changing format to `mp4` is [known to fix certain issues like `Non-monotonous DTS in output stream`](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/issues/1713#issuecomment-1726325218)\n  - If you're seeing incorrect output duration, sped up or slowed down segments, then changing format to TS is [known to give the files a common timebase](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/issues/455), which sometimes makes it possible to merge them.\n3. Then merge the exported files.\n\nDoing this first might \"clean up\" certain parameters in the files, to make them more compatible for merging. If this doesn't work, you can also try to change `avoid_negative_ts` (in export options). Also try to disable most tracks (see above). If this doesn't resolve the issue, then it probably means that you're hitting a bug or limitation in FFmpeg with the particular file that you're cutting/merging. Unfortunately there's not much to do other than trying different output settings, different cut time or waiting for improvements in FFmpeg.\n\n## Smart cut not working\n\nSmart cut is experimental, so don't expect too much. But if you're having problems, check out [this issue](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/issues/126).\n- If Smart cut gives you repeated (duplicate) segments, you can try to enable the Export Option \"Shift all start times\".\n- Sometimes it helps to convert (remux) your videos [to mp4 first](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/discussions/1292#discussioncomment-10425084) (e.g. from mkv) using LosslessCut, before smart cutting them.\n\n## MP4/MOV issues\n\nMP4 and MOV are technically almost the same format. Sometimes files have the extension `.mp4` but are in reality the MOV format (and vice versa). MOV tends to be more lenient in which codecs it supports. FFmpeg has problems exporting some MP4 files as MP4, so MOV needs to be selected instead. Unfortunately I don't know any way to fix this. Sometimes certain players are not able to play back certain exported `.mov` files ([Adobe Premiere](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/issues/1075#issuecomment-2327459890) 👀). You can try to rename the exported MOV file extension to `.mp4` and see if it helps. Or vice versa, rename an exported MP4 file to `.mov`.\n\n## Output file name is missing characters (Chinese, accents etc)\n\nIf the output file name has special characters that get replaced by underscore (`_`), try to turn off [\"Sanitize\"](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/issues/889) in the \"Output file names\" editor in the \"Export options\" dialog. Note that this will cause special characters like `/` to be preserved. Some characters are not supported in some operating systems, so be careful. using `/` or `\\` can be used to create a folder structure from your segments when exported.\n\n## Linux specific issues\n\n- If you get an error like `FATAL:setuid_sandbox_host.cc(157)] The SUID sandbox helper binary was found, but is not configured correctly. Rather than run without sandboxing I'm aborting now.`, try to run it as `./lossless-cut --no-sandbox`. See [#258](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/issues/258)\n- [Hardware accelerated HEVC playback](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/discussions/2261)\n\nIf you have an issue with the Snap or Flatpak version of LosslessCut, try instead the GitHub downloads. I **cannot provide support for the [Flatpak version](https://github.com/flathub/no.mifi.losslesscut)** because is not maintained by me.\n\n## Windows specific issues\n\n- I get an error/crash immediately when starting up LosslessCut\n  - Try to disable your anti-virus or whitelist LosslessCut. See [#18](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/issues/18) [#1114](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/issues/1114)\n- Completely white window when starting up?\n  - Try to run with `--disable-gpu` - See [781](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/issues/781).\n- How to uninstall LosslessCut?\n  - There is no installer. Just delete the folder. [More info](./installation.md).\n- Preview of H265/HEVC files is completely black, corrupted or just won't play back?\n  - This probably means that Chromium (which LosslessCut uses for playback) doesn't support your particular file (maybe it's 10-bit). [#2228](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/discussions/2228), [#1767](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/discussions/1767)\n  - Go to settings and disable \"Hardware HEVC decoding\".\n  - Use FFmpeg-assisted software decoding playback by going to *File* -> *Convert to supported format*\n- Video preview playback slow, stuttering, flickering inside LosslessCut (NVIDIA)\n  - See [#922](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/issues/922) [#1904](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/issues/1904) [#1915](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/issues/1915) [#922](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/issues/922) [#2083](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/issues/2083)\n- Why no `.exe`/`.zip`/`.appx` downloads?\n  - I decided to stop distributing exe/zip and instead just [7zip](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/releases/latest/download/LosslessCut-win-x64.7z), due to the [problems](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/issues/1072#issuecomment-1066026323) that the (self-extracting) exe was causing and the large size of `.zip` files. `appx` is unsigned and [**does not work**](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/issues/337).\n- I'm getting a `KERNEL32.dll` error\n  - It's probably because you're running Windows 7, 8 or 8.1 which is [no longer supported.](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/discussions/1476)\n\n# Known limitations\n\n- Undo/redo segments doesn't work through the top menu. This is a [known issue](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/issues/610) that I don't know how to fix. Please use the keyboard shortcuts instead (<kbd>CTRL</kbd>/<kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> and <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>Y</kbd> / <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd>).\n\n## Low quality / blurry playback\n\nSome formats or codecs are not natively supported, so they will play back with a lower quality. You may convert these files to a supported codec from the File menu, see [#88](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/issues/88).\n\n## MPEG TS / MTS\n\nMPEG TS (`.mts`/`.ts`) files have a tendency to be a [bit problematic](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/issues/1839). It may help to **first** remux them to another format like MP4/MKV. Then you can open the MP4/MKV file an work on that. Also disable non-needed tracks. In LosslessCut you can remux files by simply opening them, select a different output format, and export without editing the timeline (segments).\n\n## EXIF / metadata\n\nIt is a known problem that FFmpeg will not always preserve metadata correctly. More info [#1027](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/issues/1027). Some metadata can be preserved (see Export Options dialog), but it doesn't always output compliant files, so use it carefully. Alternatively you can use [exiftool](https://exiftool.org/) after exporting with LosslessCut to transfer metadata, for example:\n\n```bash\nexiftool -tagsFromFile Original-Source-File.mp4 -all:all -overwrite_original Exported-From-LosslessCut.mp4\n```\n\n## Proprietary data tracks list\n\nWhen exporting, LosslessCut may be unable to process certain proprietary tracks. For example `tmcd`, `fdsc` and `gpmd` added by GoPro. These can however be losslessly exported to separate files if you want to keep this data for later.\n\n## Multiple LosslessCut instances\n\nBy default, only a single running instance of LosslessCut is allowed. If you start a new LosslessCut instance from the command line, it will instead pass the list of files onto the already running instance. You can override this behavior inside settings Note that this is **(experimental)**, because Electron doesn't seem to support this. [More info](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/2493) [#1641](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/issues/1641)\n\n## Rotation and merging\n\nA video’s rotation is just metadata stored in its file. A file can only have a single rotation across the whole file, so if you have two video files and you rotate only one file and then concatenate them, there will be only one output rotation.\n\n# Still cannot find an answer?\n\nIf any other problem please search for [existing issues](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/issues) before you [ask a question](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/discussions) here on GitHub. You can check the developer tools for any errors or clues. Menu: `Tools` -> `Toggle Developer Tools`.\nAlso you are welcome to hang out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/fhnEREfUJ3) 🤗\n"

Great for saving space by rough cutting your large video files taken from a video camera, GoPro, drone, etc. It lets you quickly extract the good parts from your videos and discard many gigabytes of data without doing a slow re-encode and thereby losing quality. It extremely fast because it does an almost direct data copy. It is fueled by the awesome ffmpeg (included) for doing the grunt work. It also features some other lossless operations on videos.</p>\n  </description>\n  <launchable type=\"desktop-id\">no.mifi.losslesscut.desktop</launchable>\n  <screenshots>\n    <screenshot type=\"default\">\n      <image>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mifi/lossless-cut/master/main_screenshot.jpg</image>\n      <caption>A screenshot of the main window of LosslessCut</caption>\n    </screenshot>\n  </screenshots>\n  <url type=\"homepage\">https://mifi.no/losslesscut/</url>\n  <url type=\"bugtracker\">https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/issues</url>\n  <url type=\"donation\">https://paypal.me/mifino/usd</url>\n  <releases>\n    <release version=\"3.64.0\" date=\"2024-11-01\"/>\n    <release version=\"3.63.0\" date=\"2024-10-07\"/>\n    <release version=\"3.62.0\" date=\"2024-08-06\"/>\n    <release version=\"3.61.1\" date=\"2024-05-27\"/>\n    <release version=\"3.61.0\" date=\"2024-05-14\"/>\n    <release version=\"3.60.0\" date=\"2024-01-05\"/>\n    <release version=\"3.59.1\" date=\"2023-12-22\"/>\n    <release version=\"3.59.0\" date=\"2023-12-22\"/>\n    <release version=\"3.58.0\" date=\"2023-10-16\"/>\n    <release version=\"3.57.0\" date=\"2023-10-15\"/>\n    <release version=\"3.56.0\" date=\"2023-08-24\"/>\n    <release version=\"3.55.2\" date=\"2023-04-09\"/>\n    <release version=\"3.55.1\" date=\"2023-04-07\"/>\n    <release version=\"3.55.0\" date=\"2023-04-07\"/>\n    <release version=\"3.54.0\" date=\"2023-04-04\"/>\n    <release version=\"3.53.0\" date=\"2023-03-10\"/>\n    <release version=\"3.52.0\" date=\"2023-02-17\"/>\n    <release version=\"3.51.1\" date=\"2023-02-17\"/>\n    <release version=\"3.51.0\" date=\"2023-02-17\"/>\n    <release version=\"3.50.0\" date=\"2023-02-05\"/>\n    <release version=\"3.49.0\" date=\"2023-01-15\"/>\n    <release version=\"3.48.2\" date=\"2022-11-23\"/>\n    <release version=\"3.48.1\" date=\"2022-11-23\"/>\n    <release version=\"3.48.0\" date=\"2022-11-23\"/>\n    <release version=\"3.47.1\" date=\"2022-10-15\"/>\n    <release version=\"3.47.0\" date=\"2022-10-15\"/>\n    <release version=\"3.46.3\" date=\"2022-08-12\"/>\n    <release version=\"3.46.2\" date=\"2022-07-20\"/>\n    <release version=\"3.46.1\" date=\"2022-07-20\"/>\n    <release version=\"3.46.0\" date=\"2022-07-20\"/>\n    <release version=\"3.45.0\" date=\"2022-05-23\"/>\n    <release version=\"3.44.0\" date=\"2022-03-09\"/>\n    <release version=\"3.43.0\" date=\"2022-02-22\"/>\n    <release version=\"3.42.0\" date=\"2022-01-16\"/>\n    <release version=\"3.40.0\" date=\"2021-11-13\"/>\n    <release version=\"3.37.0\" date=\"2021-07-25\"/>\n    <release version=\"3.31.1\" date=\"2021-01-25\"/>\n    <release version=\"3.30.0\" date=\"2020-12-15\"/>\n    <release version=\"3.29.1\" date=\"2020-12-11\"/>\n    <release version=\"3.29.0\" date=\"2020-12-10\"/>\n    <release version=\"3.27.0\" date=\"2020-11-26\"/>\n    <release version=\"3.22.8\" date=\"2020-07-10\"/>\n    <release version=\"3.22.3\" date=\"2020-05-06\"/>\n    <release version=\"3.22.2\" date=\"2020-05-04\"/>\n    <release version=\"3.18.0\" date=\"2020-04-10\"/>\n    <release version=\"3.17.14\" date=\"2020-03-30\"/>\n    <release version=\"3.17.9\" date=\"2020-03-29\"/>\n    <release version=\"2.6.2\" date=\"2019-11-05\"/>\n  </releases>\n  <content_rating type=\"oars-1.0\">\n    <content_attribute id=\"violence-cartoon\">none</content_attribute>\n    <content_attribute id=\"violence-fantasy\">none</content_attribute>\n    <content_attribute id=\"violence-realistic\">none</content_attribute>\n    <content_attribute id=\"violence-bloodshed\">none</content_attribute>\n    <content_attribute id=\"violence-sexual\">none</content_attribute>\n    <content_attribute id=\"drugs-alcohol\">none</content_attribute>\n    <content_attribute id=\"drugs-narcotics\">none</content_attribute>\n    <content_attribute id=\"drugs-tobacco\">none</content_attribute>\n    <content_attribute id=\"sex-nudity\">none</content_attribute>\n    <content_attribute id=\"sex-themes\">none</content_attribute>\n    <content_attribute id=\"language-profanity\">none</content_attribute>\n    <content_attribute id=\"language-humor\">none</content_attribute>\n    <content_attribute id=\"language-discrimination\">none</content_attribute>\n    <content_attribute id=\"social-chat\">none</content_attribute>\n    <content_attribute id=\"social-info\">none</content_attribute>\n    <content_attribute id=\"social-audio\">none</content_attribute>\n    <content_attribute id=\"social-location\">none</content_attribute>\n    <content_attribute id=\"social-contacts\">none</content_attribute>\n    <content_attribute id=\"money-purchasing\">none</content_attribute>\n    <content_attribute id=\"money-gambling\">none</content_attribute>\n  </content_rating>\n</component>\n"

You are welcome to help translate the app in [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/losslesscut/losslesscut/). **Do not submit a PR** yourself with translations. Weblate will automatically push translations as a Pull Request in this repo, but this PR is not merged immediately by maintainers.\n\nMaster language is English and i18n keys are the English strings.\n\n## Testing translations locally\n\nBecause the Weblate PR with translation updates is not merged immediately, your changes made in Weblate will not appear automatically in the nightly build. If you want test new weblate translations you made in the app, you need to:\n1. Download the translation for your language from Weblate: **Files -> Download translation**\n2. Rename the downloaded `.json` file to: `translation.json`\n3. Create a [folder structure](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/tree/master/src/main/locales) somewhere on your computer that looks like this:\n```\ntranslations/locales/localeCode\n```\nYou can find a list of the available [`localeCode`s here](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut/tree/master/src/main/locales). In our example we will use `nb_NO` (Norwegian 🇳🇴) with this path:\n```\n/Users/mifi/Desktop/translations/locales/nb_NO\n```\n\n4. Now move your `translation.json` file into the folder:\n```\n/Users/mifi/Desktop/translations/locales/nb_NO/translation.json\n```\n\n5. Now run LosslessCut from the [command line](cli.md), with the special command line argument `--locales-path`. Use the path to the **folder containing the locales folder**, e.g.:\n```bash\n./LosslessCut --locales-path /Users/mifi/Desktop/translations\n```\n\nNow LosslessCut will use your language local file.\n\n## Weblate\n\nNote to LosslessCut maintainers: Weblate [does not allow](https://github.com/WeblateOrg/weblate/issues/7081) any pushes to the weblate LosslessCut github repository (`https://hosted.weblate.org/git/losslesscut/losslesscut/`). This means if their repo becomes out of sync with this repo, the translations will be locked and the `master` branch here needs to be synced with their branch. This should normally not happen unless the weblate PR has been accidentally merged with a squash commit.\n"
