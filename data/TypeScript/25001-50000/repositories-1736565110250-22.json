          "content": "# Contributing to `styled-components`\n\nAs the creators and maintainers of this project, we want to ensure that `styled-components` lives and continues to grow and evolve. The evolution of the library should never be blocked by any single person's time. One of the simplest ways of doing this is by encouraging a larger set of shallow contributors. Through this, we hope to mitigate the problems of a project that needs updates but there's no one who has the power to do so.\n\nTo quote [@alloy](https://github.com/alloy) from [this issue](https://github.com/Moya/Moya/issues/135):\n\n> Don't ever feel bad for not contributing to open source.\n\nWe want contributors to provide ideas, keep the ship shipping and to take some of the load from others. It is non-obligatory; we’re here to get things done in an enjoyable way. :trophy:\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nIt's important to note that all repositories under the `styled-components` banner have a [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please review and help enforce this CoC should any violations happen if you feel comfortable doing so.\n\n## What if you have problems that cannot be discussed in a public issue?\n\nThese days, we highly recommend trying a tool like [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) to get instant feedback and tips. [@quantizor](https://x.com/quantizor) can be reached on X to start a private conversation, but please keep in mind that response is not guaranteed since open source is volunteer effort and subject to personal availability.\n\n## Code contributions\n\n### Environment setup\n\n1. Ensure `yarn` is installed (https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)\n2. [Fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo), then pull it down to your disk: `git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/styled-components.git`\n3. Hop into the styled-components folder and run `yarn install`\n4. Set the base repository as upstream: `git remote add upstream git@github.com:styled-components/styled-components.git` (makes it easier to pull updates to your fork)\n\nAt this point, the repository is initialized and ready for development! Check the `packages/` folder for the `styled-components` core library, a development `sandbox` (great for testing functionality), and the `benchmarks` suite.\n\nHelpful commands:\n\n- run unit tests: `yarn run test`\n- check code style `yarn run prettier` (handled automatically if you have a prettier extension installed in your IDE)\n- run build: `yarn run build`\n- run dev sandbox: `yarn workspace sandbox dev` (or just `yarn dev` if you're in that folder)\n\n### Making changes\n\nHere is a quick guide to doing code contributions to the library.\n\n1. Find some issue you're interested in, or a feature that you'd like to tackle.\n   Also make sure that no one else is already working on it. We don't want you to be\n   disappointed.\n\n2. See [Environment setup](#environment-setup)\n\n3. Update your local copy of the `main` branch with the latest code: `git checkout main && git pull -f upstream/main`\n\n4. Create a branch with a meaningful name for the issue: `git checkout -b fix-something`\n\n5. Run `yarn install` to capture any dependency updates\n\n6. Make desired changes...\n\n7. Add a changeset via `yarn changeset`, be descriptive!\n\n   - patch = bugfix, chores, small things\n   - minor = new functionality\n   - major = breaking changes\n\n8. Push your branch: `git push -u origin your-branch-name`\n\n9. Submit a pull request to the upstream styled-components repository.\n\n10. Choose a descriptive title and describe your changes briefly.\n\n11. Wait for a maintainer to review your PR, make changes if it's being recommended, and get it merged.\n\n12. Perform a celebratory dance! :dancer:\n\n### How do I run the benchmarks?\n\nWe have three different benchmarks: mounting a deep tree, mounting a wide tree and updating dynamic styles. Shoutout to [@necolas](https://github.com/necolas), who wrote these for `react-native-web` and whom we stole these benchmarks from.\n\nTo run the benchmarks run:\n\n```sh\ncd packages/benchmarks\n```\n\nThen build the benchmark page:\n\n```sh\nyarn run build\n```\n\nThen open the page in your browser:\n\n```sh\nyarn run open\n```\n\nOn the page which opens, select the benchmark to run and click the \"Run\" button in your browser.\n\nYou may need to re-build styled-components and/or the benchmarks package after making changes if you want to re-run the benchmarks with your changes.\n\n## Credits\n\nThese contribution guidelines are based on https://github.com/moya/contributors, big thanks to @alloy, @orta et al. for the inspiration and guidance.\n\n## Financial contributions\n\nPlease see the \"Sponsor\" button at the top of the repository, thank you!\n\n## Credits\n\n### Contributors\n\nThank you to all the people who have already contributed to styled-components!\n<a href=\"graphs/contributors\"><img src=\"https://opencollective.com/styled-components/contributors.svg?width=890\" /></a>\n\n### Backers\n\nThank you to all our backers!

The Core Team has [GitHub admin privileges](https://github.com/orgs/styled-components/teams/core) on all `styled-components` repos.\n\n## Core Team Responsibilities\n\nThe `styled-components` Core Team has the following responsibilities:\n\n- Being available to answer high-level questions about `styled-components`'s vision and future.\n- Being available to review longstanding/forgotten pull requests.\n- Occasionally check `styled-components` issues, offer input, and categorize with GitHub issue labels.\n- Looking out for up-and-coming members of the `styled-components` community who might want to serve as Core Team members.\n- Pushing new releases of the package to `npm`.\n\nNote that the `styled-components` Core Team – and all `styled-components` contributors – are open source _volunteers_; membership on the Core Team is expressly _not_ an obligation. The Core Team is distinguished as leaders in the community and while they are a good group to turn to when someone needs an answer to a question, they are still volunteering their time, and may not be available to help immediately.\n\n## Core Team Members\n\nThe current core team members, ordered first by status and then time of addition:\n\n| Handle      | Status   |\n| ----------- | -------- |\n| @quantizor  | active   |\n| @geelen     | inactive |\n| @mxstbr     | inactive |\n| @philpl     | inactive |\n| @schwers    | inactive |\n| @imbhargav5 | inactive |\n\nWe are seeking helping hands for the future of styled-components! If interested, please shoot [@quantizor](https://x.com/quantizor) a message on X.\n\n## Adding new Core Team Members\n\nThe process for adding new Core Team members is as follows:\n\n- An existing Core Team member reaches out privately to see if the individual is interested. If they are, open a pull request adding them to the list.\n- Existing Core Team members review the pull request. The person merging the PR is responsible for adding them to the [\"Core\" GitHub team](https://github.com/orgs/styled-components/teams/core) and for adding them as an owner to the npm package. (`npm owner add <npmusername>`)\n\n> Note: If you feel like you have demonstrated a lasting enthusiasm for the `styled-components` project and community, yet nobody has reached out to you about joining the core team, feel free to ping one of the existing core team members _privately_ about the possibility of joining the core team.\n\n## Credits\n\nThis document is based on the Moya `CORE_TEAM.md` layout: https://github.com/Moya/contributors\n"

It also removes the mapping between components and styles – using components as a low-level styling construct could not be easier!\n\n```jsx\nconst Button = styled.button`\n  color: grey;\n`;\n```\n\nAlternatively, you may use [style objects](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced#style-objects). This allows for easy porting of CSS from inline styles, while still supporting the more advanced styled-components capabilities like component selectors and media queries.\n\n```jsx\nconst Button = styled.button({\n  color: 'grey',\n});\n```\n\nEquivalent to:\n\n```jsx\nconst Button = styled.button`\n  color: grey;\n`;\n```\n\n`styled-components` is compatible with both React (for web) and React Native – meaning it's the perfect choice even for truly universal apps! See the [documentation about React Native](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/basics#react-native) for more information.\n\n_Supported by [Front End Center](https://frontend.center).

A lot of them make it easier to get started or help you with your next project!
