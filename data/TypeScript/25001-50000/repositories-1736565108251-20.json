(This does not prevent the browser to show the hint to add the password)\n\n- Galician onboarding translation ([#27908](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/27908) by [@Thiagof99](https://github.com/Thiagof99))\n\n  I've translated the entire onboarding page and forms to galician language.

The only scenario where this information could be missing is if migrations failed to run properly when upgrading to 6.0. We haven't been able to identify the root cause yet, so we decided to provide a workaround in the meanwhile\n\n- App crashing when switching to Hindi (hi-In) language ([#28285](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28285) by [@bhardwajdisha](https://github.com/bhardwajdisha))\n\n- app status inconsistencies when running multiple instances in a cluster ([#29180](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/29180))\n\n  App status inconsistencies between multiple instances in a cluster boil down to the fact that the Apps-Engine is currently responsible for orchestrating when these events are triggered and is overly verbose in doing so.\r\n\r\n  Upon analysis, the framework itself _should not_ have the concept of \"other instances\"   - this is a deployment detail of the host system, and as such should be controlled by the host. The correct solution for this problem is to review this notification system, potentially removing it from the framework and leaving the responsibility solely for Rocket.Chat.\r\n\r\n  However, this is hindering the current app management experience for workspaces, so this PR cuts the control of some notifications that come from the framework (the more problematic ones) and moves the control over to RC in a short and practical way.\r\n\r\n  This is done by turning the methods of the most problematic events in the `AppActivationBridge` into no-ops, and instead triggering the `AppServerNotifier` directly in the api endpoints that are applicable.\r\n\r\n  It is _not_ the most correct solution to the problem, but due to time constraints and urgency this will be applied first so we can move with the correct solution in a future point.\n\n- application crashing when clicking on files button ([#28878](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28878) by [@jayesh-jain252](https://github.com/jayesh-jain252))\n\n  The application crashed when a user clicked on the files option when there were multiple files in the room.\r\n\r\n  After:\r\n  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79307894/231410669-971dbde8-2885-472c-8e18-602d0f5765c4.png)\n\n- Apps.engine resource consumption ([#28514](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28514))\n\n  Added some validations to avoid doing unnecessary updates and also avoid loop that causes high server usage\n\n- Avoid `useEffect` loop ([#28699](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28699))\n\n  A bug in `useUserBanners` hooks will generate a infinite loop whenever a new user banner (e.g. new version announcement) is available. This PR fixes it.\n\n- Avoid throw error on `settings.watch` at startup ([#28649](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28649))\n\n- Bring unseen app requests badge back and minor refactors ([#28348](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28348))\n\n  Brought back the unseen app requests badge that disappeared due to a development oversight and fixed some typos and style issues.\n\n- change default text color in homepage custom content block ([#28685](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28685))\n\n  - The default text (if there is no content or the admin just adds text without style) color in the homepage custom content block was blue (due to `color=\"info\"`), but should actually be black\r\n\r\n  Before:\r\n\r\n  <img width=\"613\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-03-29 at 12 14 47\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48109548/228594931-379f4df6-89f1-411d-9226-76ad9abe1c02.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n  After:\r\n\r\n  <img width=\"605\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-03-29 at 12 47 55\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48109548/228594967-6a2ceb9f-6422-4b85-8021-653ae9a3e4f6.png\">\n\n- Changing the app's error verification ([#28450](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28450))\n\n- check if custom field is required to apply rule ([#28428](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28428) by [@filipemarins](https://github.com/filipemarins))\n\n  Fix save button is not enabled until non-required custom fields are not filled under room information.\n\n- composer slashcommands duplication  ([#29086](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/29086))\n\n- Confirm password flow fixed and refactored ([#28453](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28453) by [@XshubhamX](https://github.com/XshubhamX))\n\n- convert OVERWRITE_SETTING type MULTISELECT to array ([#29208](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/29208))\n\n- Delete accounts modal asks for a username instead of the password ([#28883](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28883))\n\n  Jira task: [WM-2](https://rocketchat.atlassian.net/browse/WM-2?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiYWQ2MjJjZTk3MGRlNDY3ZTljM2EzYjNhMmNkYTM0NmEiLCJwIjoiaiJ9)\r\n  Fixed a misuse of the password.bcrypt data. This info shouldn't be exposed to the front-end. Not only that, but it also wasn't available to the front-end causing a bug in which the user would be prompted for their username when deleting their account even if they had a password.

Edit the `MessageBoxReplies` to add a `collapsed` prop to the attachments to always start as collapsed\r  \n  - Add a new prop to the `MessageCollapsible` component to control the preview attachments in `MessageBoxReplies` to always start as collapsed\r  \n  - Edit the Attachment components to read the `collapsed` value and send it thought \r  \n  - Edited the `ShareMessageModal` to display the correct attachment and its previews\r  \n  - Edited the `useCollapse` hook prop as optional because was not making sense to put it as mandatory since it was getting the value from the user preferences as default and for the `MessageCollapsible` work in a dynamic way\r\n\r\n  **Current Behavior:**\r\n  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20212776/227235491-b04c82fd-fe74-4699-aae8-02429934c1b5.png)\r\n\r\n  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20212776/227235326-18976ab0-3fd1-44a2-8635-e2a81e839f3b.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n  **Expected Behavior**\r\n  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20212776/227236374-b13957d6-c428-4f46-81f9-890409273837.png)\r\n\r\n  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20212776/227235906-e59fb77e-2518-44fd-9a0d-00b1014d8724.png)\n\n- Messages jumping after reaction ([#28770](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28770))\n\n- Migration error when removing 'snipetted' index ([#29215](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/29215))\n\n- migration to fix apps in invalid state ([#29210](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/29210))\n\n  Due to a conflict between 5.4.x and 6.0, if the upgrade of a workspace is done using a Rolling upgrade strategy, it is likely that apps will be left in an invalid (potentially unusable) state.\r\n\r\n  We can solve apps left in this state by adding another migration.\n\n- missing margins in message composer icons ([#28430](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28430))\n\n  -

The issue was caused by the passing of three parameters (id of app, marketplaceVersion, and tab) to the route when opening an app's details. In the case of private apps, the marketplaceVersion was returning undefined, which caused the version to take on the value of the tab when redirecting. To resolve this issue, I have updated the code to pass the version of the app when the marketplaceVersion returns undefined. This fix ensures that the routes behave as expected in the Private Apps section of the Marketplace.\r\n\r\n  https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89914602/225092278-48854c4e-9135-4f6a-ae3e-6f99250dfa45.mp4\n\n- Show all users on rooms members list ([#28413](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28413))\n\n  <img width=\"465\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58601732/225011806-9062bde0-687d-4b1b-9e4e-8db30a48f992.png\">\n\n- Single omni closed room can't be deleted when the user doesn't have the permission to 'remove all closed omni rooms' ([#28877](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28877))\n\n- Small UI bugs ([#28893](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28893))\n\n  It fixes an insidious bug affecting the focus of the message composer whenever the user start typing.

The  `<GazzodownText /> ` component it's necessary because it has the `MarkupInteractionContext.Provider` that has the context necessary to display the emoji and other elements\r  \n  - Empty parent message: Since the parent message it's a quote, the initial string from a quote message it's a link that references the original message followed by `\\n` break line. I added a validation to check if it's a quoteAttachment message, if it is I remove the first markdown token responsible by the link\r\n\r\n  **Before:**\r\n  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20212776/225731429-98e2b5e2-9aff-4f17-9178-da9ff3257c2f.png)\r\n\r\n  **After:**\r\n  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20212776/225725000-9c4e9d3b-f8d0-4dec-9091-1ffa091406d0.png)\n\n- Thread message preview to ignore hide_FlexTab preference ([#28470](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28470))\n\n  Added `role='link'` so that hide_flextab preference is ignored on this DOM node.\n\n- ui crash if no app requests found ([#29107](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/29107))\n\n- Unauthorized Toast Message when accessing a channel's team that user are not a member ([#28670](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28670))\n\n  Complementary it replaces `useEndpointData` in favor of `useQuery`\n\n- Unnecessary useQuery refetch ([#28451](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28451))\n\n  Sometimes when the user focuses on the window that is running the Rocket.Chat some queries are triggered again without a reason, to prevent this to happen I added a option to `useQuery` hook, `refetchOnWindowFocus: false`\r\n\r\n  **Queries impacted:**\r  \n  - useThreadMainMessageQuery.ts   - called when has to get the thread main message, for e.g in thread preview reply\r  \n  - useHasLicenseModule.ts   - called when the client starts to show/hide certain areas that are restricted by licenses, this don't change very often\n\n- use raw image url ([#28861](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28861) by [@avelino](https://github.com/avelino))\n\n- videoconf stream ([#28455](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28455))\n\n- Whatsapp quotes not working due to livechat url change ([#29153](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/29153))\n\n- When clicking on display option their checked status does not changes ([#27881](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/27881) by [@AdityaSingh-02](https://github.com/AdityaSingh-02))\n\n- word break in rcx-message-body ([#28904](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28904))\n\n  Changes made on the fuselage repo: https://github.com/RocketChat/fuselage/pull/1028\r\n  The CSS added into `rcx-message-body` `word-break: break-all;` was breaking a word in the middle in the messages.\r\n\r\n  To change this behavior and break the entire word I changed to `word-break: break-word;`\r\n\r\n\r\n  **Previous**\r\n  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20212776/231753930-53ac7ab0-8e87-4014-9085-c0c3fc40f0b7.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n  **NOW**\r\n  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20212776/231754080-b87c4c5d-2565-43b3-ab4f-8382f6bdd2ae.png)\n\n- Wrong error message when trying to create new team with existing team name ([#28270](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28270) by [@Bankar-Swapnil](https://github.com/Bankar-Swapnil))\n\n<details>\n<summary>🔍 Minor changes</summary>\n\n\n- /help notifying the shortcuts in multiple messages ([#28765](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28765) by [@chinma-yyy](https://github.com/chinma-yyy))\n\n- `AutoComplete` Sanitization ([#28666](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28666))\n\n  Fuselage Dependency: [#1014](https://github.com/RocketChat/fuselage/pull/1014)\n\n- `enter-room` callback hook ([#28704](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28704))\n\n- `Imports` model removal ([#28459](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28459))\n\n- `InstancesModal` to ts ([#28474](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28474))\n\n- `livechat rooms` - 1 ([#28497](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28497))\n\n- `LivechatDepartmentAgents` removal ([#28472](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28472))\n\n- `LivechatDepartments` - 1/2 ([#28664](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28664))\n\n- `LivechatRooms` 2 ([#28504](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28504))\n\n- `LivechatRooms` removal - 3 ([#28506](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28506))\n\n- `LivechatTag` model to raw ([#28706](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28706))\n\n- `meteor/session` usage (1/N) ([#28565](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28565))\n\n  It restricts and replaces the usage of the `meteor/session` package on client modules.\n\n- `openRoom` dilluted into components ([#28794](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28794))\n\n  Opening a room, from client-side, was an asynchronous process that was performed imperatively by a function called `opemRoom`. Its major issue was violating the principle of single responsibility by querying both the REST API as well the local cached collection and performing side-effects, like redirecting and handling errors. This PR moves `openRoom` core logic to a React Query function, which was only possible by decoupling a bunch of stuff in `RoomCoordinator`.\n\n- `readMessage` events ([#28709](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28709))\n\n- `RegisterUsername` ([#28362](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28362))\n\n  <img width=\"643\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-03-10 at 18 26 01\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27704687/224431376-d1495b75-08ca-4fb1-808b-4eb38ea66388.png\">\n\n- `RoomInfo` to typescript ([#28250](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28250))\n\n- `Rooms` model 2X ([#28715](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28715))\n\n- `Rooms` model 3/4 ([#28736](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28736))\n\n- `Rooms` model 4/4 ([#28742](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28742))\n\n- `roomSearch` Template ([#28691](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28691))\n\n  Jira Issue: [DSA-99]\r\n\r\n  #### before\r\n  <img width=\"595\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-03-30 at 17 42 13\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27704687/228959436-6ca2314f-5511-459e-8f8f-15bb91faa6ef.png\">\r\n\r\n  #### after\r\n  <img width=\"596\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-03-30 at 17 34 18\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27704687/228957916-b146b406-6ebd-4c76-9722-e1c6c9606252.png\">\n\n- `Service Configuration` async on server ([#28813](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28813))\n\n- `Subscriptions` - 3 ([#28538](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28538))\n\n- `Subscriptions` model - 2x ([#28535](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28535))\n\n- `Subscriptions` model 6/6 ([#28675](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28675))\n\n- `utils` to ts ([#28818](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28818))\n\n- Add \"no-floating-promises\" eslint rule - Part 1 ([#28463](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28463))\n\n- Add \"no-floating-promises\" eslint rule - Part 2 ([#28464](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28464))\n\n- Add \"no-floating-promises\" eslint rule - Part 3 ([#28435](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28435))\n\n- Add “no-misused-promises” eslint rule ([#28433](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28433))\n\n- Add `rid` to scope of `create-invite-links` permission check ([#28241](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28241) by [@LucianoPierdona](https://github.com/LucianoPierdona))\n\n  This PR fixes a bug where users with the `owner` role can't create invites because the button isn't being displayed for him, to solve this issue the `rid` was added to the scope of the check.\n\n- Add missing await to online function ([#28602](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28602))\n\n- Add types for `Meteor.userAsync` ([#28597](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28597))\n\n- adjust sidebarPalette font colors ([#28886](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28886))\n\n  - due to changes made [here](https://github.com/RocketChat/fuselage/pull/1024) it's necessary to adjust the font-color tokens from sidebarPalette\n\n- Allow RoomCoordinator.roomFind to be async ([#28566](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28566))\n\n- Apps modal adjustments and Typescript rewrite ([#28785](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28785))\n\n  Move markdown parser for apps `ModalBlock` from `apps/meteor` to `fuselage-ui-kit` package and rewrite some files related to Typescript.\n\n- Bump apps engine dependency ([#28587](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28587) by [@albuquerquefabio](https://github.com/albuquerquefabio))\n\n- bump apps-engine version to 1.38.1 ([#28885](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28885))\n\n- Bump apps-engine version to 1.38.2 ([#29009](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/29009))\n\n- Bump supercharge/mongodb-github-action from 1.7.0 to 1.9.0 ([#28003](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28003) by [@dependabot[bot]](https://github.com/dependabot[bot]))\n\n- Bump TypeScript version ([#28697](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28697))\n\n- canAccessRoomId to async ([#28540](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28540))\n\n- Change price filters for Enterprise apps ([#27553](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/27553))\n\n  * Currently, Enterprise apps are classified as “Free apps”.

6.1.7\n\n`2023-05-12  ·  2 🐛  ·  2 👩‍💻👨‍💻`\n\n### Engine versions\n- Node: `14.21.2`\n- NPM: `6.14.17`\n- MongoDB: `4.4, 5.0, 6.0`\n- Apps-Engine: `1.38.3`\n\n### 🐛 Bug fixes\n\n\n- app status inconsistencies when running multiple instances in a cluster ([#29220](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/29220))\n\n  App status inconsistencies between multiple instances in a cluster boil down to the fact that the Apps-Engine is currently responsible for orchestrating when these events are triggered and is overly verbose in doing so.\n\n  Upon analysis, the framework itself _should not_ have the concept of \"other instances\"   - this is a deployment detail of the host system, and as such should be controlled by the host. The correct solution for this problem is to review this notification system, potentially removing it from the framework and leaving the responsibility solely for Rocket.Chat.\n\n  However, this is hindering the current app management experience for workspaces, so this PR cuts the control of some notifications that come from the framework (the more problematic ones) and moves the control over to RC in a short and practical way.\n\n  This is done by turning the methods of the most problematic events in the `AppActivationBridge` into no-ops, and instead triggering the `AppServerNotifier` directly in the api endpoints that are applicable.\n\n  It is _not_ the most correct solution to the problem, but due to time constraints and urgency this will be applied first so we can move with the correct solution in a future point.\n\n- Migration error when removing 'snipetted' index ([#29215](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/29215))\n\n### 👩‍💻👨‍💻 Core Team 🤓\n\n- [@d-gubert](https://github.com/d-gubert)\n- [@sampaiodiego](https://github.com/sampaiodiego)\n\n# 6.1.6\n\n`2023-05-02  ·  1 🐛  ·  1 👩‍💻👨‍💻`\n\n### Engine versions\n- Node: `14.21.2`\n- NPM: `6.14.17`\n- MongoDB: `4.4, 5.0, 6.0`\n- Apps-Engine: `1.38.2`\n\n### 🐛 Bug fixes\n\n\n- Livechat Triggers not working ([#29073](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/29073))\n\n### 👩‍💻👨‍💻 Core Team 🤓\n\n- [@MartinSchoeler](https://github.com/MartinSchoeler)\n\n\n`2023-04-24  ·  1 🔍  ·  1 👩‍💻👨‍💻`\n\n### Engine versions\n- Node: `14.21.2`\n- NPM: `6.14.17`\n- MongoDB: `4.4, 5.0, 6.0`\n- Apps-Engine: `1.38.2`\n\n<details>\n<summary>🔍 Minor changes</summary>\n\n\n- Update `vm2` ([#29025](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/29025))\n\n</details>\n\n### 👩‍💻👨‍💻 Core Team 🤓\n\n- [@sampaiodiego](https://github.com/sampaiodiego)\n\n\n# 6.1.4\n`2023-04-20  ·  1 🔍  ·  2 👩‍💻👨‍💻`\n\n### Engine versions\n- Node: `14.21.2`\n- NPM: `6.14.17`\n- MongoDB: `4.4, 5.0, 6.0`\n- Apps-Engine: `1.38.2`\n\n<details>\n<summary>🔍 Minor changes</summary>\n\n\n- Bump apps-engine version to 1.38.2 ([#28997](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28997))\n\n</details>\n\n### 👩‍💻👨‍💻 Core Team 🤓\n\n- [@sampaiodiego](https://github.com/sampaiodiego)\n- [@tapiarafael](https://github.com/tapiarafael)\n\n\n# 6.1.3\n`2023-04-17  ·  1 🐛  ·  2 👩‍💻👨‍💻`\n\n### Engine versions\n- Node: `14.21.2`\n- NPM: `6.14.17`\n- MongoDB: `4.4, 5.0, 6.0`\n- Apps-Engine: `1.38.1`\n\n### 🐛 Bug fixes\n\n\n- Livechat notifications not working correctly ([#28741](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28741))\n\n### 👩‍💻👨‍💻 Core Team 🤓\n\n- [@MartinSchoeler](https://github.com/MartinSchoeler)\n- [@tassoevan](https://github.com/tassoevan)\n\n\n# 6.1.2\n`2023-04-13  ·  4 🐛  ·  3 🔍  ·  11 👩‍💻👨‍💻`\n\n### Engine versions\n- Node: `14.21.2`\n- NPM: `6.14.17`\n- MongoDB: `4.4, 5.0, 6.0`\n- Apps-Engine: `1.38.1`\n\n### 🐛 Bug fixes\n\n\n- Add function to get installation source ([#28806](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/28806))\n\n  There have been reports of problems regarding the missing information of `installationSource` in apps.

One possible reason is that React uses a synthetic event system that does not rely on native HTML attributes, since we had the wrapper and several blaze templates in the project, this could be effecting this behavior ignoring the name attribute in the inputs.\n\n\n  **Previous:**\n

But since our minimum MongoDB supported version is now 4.2, and MMAPv1 [was removed on this version](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v4.2/core/storage-engines/), there is no need to check that.\n\n  The new approach is just try to use change streams, if it fails for any reason, fallback to oplog.\n\n  If oplog fails as well, we're now halting the process, since it wasn't able to establish a connection for reading real time data, something that is crucial for the application. An additional check was added to make sure `$MONGO_OPLOG_URL` is pointing to the `local` database.\n\n- Chore: Remove secrets.RC_TURBO_GH_TOKEN dep from build ([#27176](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/27176))\n\n- Chore: Remove SoundRow.js ([#27215](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/27215))\n\n- Chore: Remove turborepo if env is not set ([#27199](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/27199))\n\n- Chore: Remove unused css ([#27289](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/27289))\n\n- Chore: removing useEndpointData from license api ([#26634](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/26634))\n\n  The deprecated hook `useEndpointData` was removed and changed to `useMethod` + `useQuery`separated in a hook.\n\n  In `useQuery` options we added an option to keep the cache as `Infinity` until the queries are invalidated or the page refreshes, also the query keys were changed to consolidate the keys and manage the cache in the best way possible to avoid unnecessary API calls.\n\n  In settings changed or user action that impact the License status was added a method to invalidate the cache for license query keys\n\n  E.g: `queryClient.invalidateQueries(['licenses']);`\n\n- Chore: Replace all saveUserPreferences method calls ([#26187](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/26187))\n\n- Chore: Restrict `ChatMessages` API -

([#26150](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/26150))\n\n  I know this changed a lot of files, but the main goal for this PR is not to change any behavior, the goals for the PR are:\n\n\n  - Refactor the code;\n\n  - Solve any tech debt;\n\n  - Simplify and reuse some parts of the code;\n\n  - Remove duplicated code;\n\n  - Remove all unsafe type castings;\n\n  - Solve all Eslint errors and warnings;\n\n  - Split too big files;\n\n  - Encapsulate the business logic in a better way, avoiding exposing and leaking internal logic to the unintended layers;\n\n  - Improve the actual test cases;\n\n  - Add more test cases, since a lot of cases were omitted during the release phase;\n\n  - Remove unsafe `Object.assign` statements and prefer to use the class `constructor` instead;\n\n- New 'not found page' design ([#26452](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/26452))\n\n  - Add a new design for the not-found page\n\n  - Add English translation for \"page not found\" and

([#26307](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/26307))\n\n  There was a data race in the defineVisitor function, causing new guests to be created even if a registered guest with that number already existed, also made sure that the open room being searched on is the correct source type, so the clash is not possible anymore.\n\n- Active users count on `@all` and `@here`  ([#25957](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25957))\n\n  this PR updates the old `roomMembersCount` to count active users instead of everyone\n\n- add image format validation

to open apps contextual bar ([#26495](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/26495))\n\n  Fix the bug where normal users cannot open an app contextual bar.\n  The request made by the

In the past, we used the `show message in main thread` as a solution to help users to understand the thread feature, as this feature is now mature enough there's no reason to maintain this preference.\n\n  Send the thread message to the main channel or just inside of the thread, should be a decision from the user where the function `also send to channel` appears. Because of that, and because of a bunch of requests and issues we received, we're introducing a new preference `also send thread to channel` where users will be able to decide the behavior of the checkbox.\n\n  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27704687/175655594-023c5907-adc8-4924-ba7d-467608d06fec.png)\n\n  Now there are three behavior options\n\n  - `Default`: when it unchecks after sending the first message\n  <img width='250px' height='350px' src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27704687/175656500-34817639-7f13-4641-b4fa-9dd106e99443.gif' />\n\n\n  - `Always`: stay checked for all messages\n  <img width='250px' height='350px' src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27704687/175657299-d88efaba-1c2b-4bb9-a23a-f9755dcec5ca.gif' />\n\n\n  - `Never`: stay unchecked for all messages\n  <img width='250px' height='350px' src='https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27704687/175657544-3dcd0adc-05cf-4196-83a6-f6cc29a1de2b.gif' />\n\n- Remove support to old MongoDB versions ([#26098](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/26098))\n\n  As per MongoDB Lifecycle Schedules (https://www.mongodb.com/support-policy/lifecycles) we're removing official support to MongoDB versions **3.6 and 4.0** that have already reached end-of-life.\n\n  As MongoDB 4.2 was a \"supported\" version before Rocket.Chat 5.0, we'll continue supporting it, but will be flagged as deprecated.

Now the app details page is divided into three sections, details, logs, and settings, that can each be accessed through a Tabs fuselage component.\n\n  Demo gif:\n  ![tab_navigation_demo_gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43561537/157276436-3dab34c5-20da-4f5d-99d0-54c1c718ac1f.gif)\n\n  ## [MKP12   - Header](https://app.clickup.com/t/25rhm0x)\n  Implemented a new header for the marketplaces app details page.\n  -Changed the size of the app name;\n  -Implemented the app description field on the header;\n  -Changed the \"metadata\" section of the header(The part with the version and author information) now it also shows the last time the app was updated;\n  -Created a chip that will show when an app is part of one or more bundles and inform which are the bundles;\n  -Implemented a tooltip for the bundle chips;\n  -Created a new button + data badge component to substitute the current App Status;\n  -Changed the title of the \"purchase button\". Now it shows different text based on the \"purchase type\" of the app;\n  -Created a new Pricing & Status display which shows the price when the app is not bought/installed and shows the app status(Enabled/Disabled) when it is bought/installed;\n  -Changed the way the tabs are rendered, now if the app is not installed(and consequently doesn't have logs and settings tab) it will not render these tabs;\n\n  Demo gif:\n  ![new-header-gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43561537/159064599-fd64dfe2-86a3-47da-81ba-1e83f1b87432.gif)\n\n  ## [MKP12   - Configuration Tab](https://app.clickup.com/t/2452gh4)\n  Delivered together with the tab-navigation task.

The goal is that agent should remain online\n  unless agent explicitly logs off.\n  Agent can stop receiving calls in multiple ways due to network loss. Network loss can happen in following ways.\n\n  1. User tries to switch the network. User experiences a glitch of disconnectivity. This can be simulated by turning the network off\n  in the network tab of chrome's dev tool. This can disconnect the UA if the disconnection happens just before the registration refresh.\n\n  2. Second reason is when computer goes in sleep mode.\n\n  3. Third reason is that when asterisk is crashed/in maintenance mode/explicitly stopped.\n\n  Solution:\n  The idea is to detect the network disconnection and start the start the attempts to reconnect.\n  The detection of the disconnection does not happen in case#1. The SIPUA's UserAgent transport does not\n  call onDisconnected when network loss of such kind happens. To tackle this problem, window's online and offline event handlers are\n  used.\n\n  The number of retries is configurable but ideally it is to be kept at -1. Whenever disconnection happens, it should keep on trying to\n  reconnect with increasing backoff time. This behaviour is useful when the asterisk is stopped.\n\n  When the server is disconnected, it should be indicated on the phone button.\n\n- Client-generated sort parameters in channel directory  ([#25768](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25768) by [@BenWiederhake](https://github.com/BenWiederhake))\n\n- Close room when dismiss wrap up call modal ([#25056](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25056))\n\n- Custom emoji reaction size ([#25393](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25393))\n\n- Custom sound error toast messages ([#24515](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/24515) by [@Himanshu664](https://github.com/Himanshu664))\n\n- Deactivating user breaks if user is the only room owner ([#24933](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/24933) by [@sidmohanty11](https://github.com/sidmohanty11))\n\n  ## Before\n\n  https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73601258/160000871-cfc2f2a5-2a59-4d27-8049-7754d003dd48.mp4\n\n\n\n  ## After\n  https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73601258/159998287-681ab475-ff33-4282-82ff-db751c59a392.mp4\n\n- Desktop notification on multi-instance environments ([#25220](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25220))\n\n- Direct Reply ([#22588](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/22588))\n\n- Discussion alphabetical  ordering ([#25788](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25788))\n\n  Added a validation in the prop used for sorting (loweCaseName) checking for a prop that only exists in discussions (prid)\n\n- Dynamic load matrix is enabled and handle failure  ([#25495](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25495))\n\n- End call button disappearing when on-hold ([#24936](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/24936))\n\n- Error \"numRequestsAllowed\" property in rateLimiter for REST API endpoint when upgrading ([#26058](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/26058))\n\n- Failure to update Integration History index ([#25473](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25473))\n\n- Fix max-width message block ([#25686](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25686))\n\n- Fix prom-client new promise usage ([#25781](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25781))\n\n- fixes HTML sanitizing error.

Clearing call related UI when the network is disconnected or switched.\n\n  2. Do clean connectivity. There were few issues discovered in earlier implementation. e.g endpoint would randomly\n  get disconnected after a while. This was due to the fact that the earlier socket disconnection caused the\n  removal of contact on asterisk. This should be fixed in this PR.\n\n  3. This PR contains a lot of logs. This will be removed before the final merge.\n\n- FormData uploads not working ([#25069](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25069))\n\n- Full error message is visible ([#24856](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/24856) by [@Himanshu664](https://github.com/Himanshu664))\n\n- getUserMentionsByChannel method room permission ([#25748](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25748))\n\n- Importer fails to download files from URLs with query string params ([#25934](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25934))\n\n- Importer files are unnecessarily transferred over the network.

So a natural solution to solve this is to wait for setting change event 'private-settings-changed'. Then if 'VoIP_Enabled' is updated and it is true, set voipEnabled  to true in useVoipClient.ts (on client side)\n\n  It was realised that the race does not happen because of the database or server noticing the changes late. But because of the time taken to establish the AMI connection with Asterisk.\n\n  Solution:\n\n\n  1. Change apps/meteor/app/voip/server/startup.ts. When VoIP_Enabled is changed, await for Voip.init() to complete and then broadcast connector.statuschanged  with changed value.\n\n  2. From apps/meteor/server/modules/listeners/listeners.module.ts use notifyLoggedInThisInstance to notify all logged in users on current instance.\n\n  3. in apps/meteor/client/providers/CallProvider/hooks/useVoipClient.ts add the event handler that receives this event. Change voipEnabled from constant to state. Change this state based on the 'value' that is received by the handler.\n\n- Voip endpoint permissions ([#25783](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25783))\n\n- Wrong argument name preventing Omnichannel Chat Forward to User  ([#25723](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25723))\n\n<details>\n<summary>🔍 Minor changes</summary>\n\n\n- Bump body-parser from 1.19.2 to 1.20.0 in /ee/server/services ([#25042](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25042) by [@dependabot[bot]](https://github.com/dependabot[bot]))\n\n- Bump ejson from 2.2.1 to 2.2.2 ([#25057](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25057) by [@dependabot[bot]](https://github.com/dependabot[bot]))\n\n- Bump eslint-plugin-anti-trojan-source from 1.0.6 to 1.1.0 ([#25076](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25076) by [@dependabot[bot]](https://github.com/dependabot[bot]))\n\n- Bump minimist from 1.2.5 to 1.2.6 in /ee/server/services ([#24991](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/24991) by [@dependabot[bot]](https://github.com/dependabot[bot]))\n\n- Bump pino and pino-pretty ([#25052](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25052))\n\n- Bump template-file from 6.0.0 to 6.0.1 ([#25002](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25002) by [@dependabot[bot]](https://github.com/dependabot[bot]))\n\n- Chore: `@rocket.chat/favicon` ([#25920](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25920))\n\n- Chore: `refactor/tsc-perf` ([#26040](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/26040))\n\n- Chore: Account/Profile to TS ([#25929](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25929))\n\n- Chore: add _id and name options to JSON Schemas ([#25813](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25813))\n\n  This pull request adds the `roomId` and `roomName` options for the Ajv JSON Schemas on the `packages/rest-typings/src/v1/channels/` and `packages/rest-typings/src/v1/dm/` folders.\n\n- Chore: Add /v1/video-conference endpoint types ([#25278](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25278))\n\n- Chore: Add Agenda fork to the monorepo ([#25681](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25681))\n\n- Chore: add Ajv JSON Schema to api/v1 ([#25601](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25601))\n\n  This pull request adds Ajv JSON Schema validation to `apps/meteor/app/api/server/v1/` and `packages/rest-typings/src/v1/`, where needed.\n\n- Chore: Add auto label and improve Kodiak configuration ([#25829](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25829))\n\n- Chore: Add channel endpoints (rest-typings) ([#25279](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25279))\n\n- Chore: Add client folder to CODEOWNERS  ([#25397](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25397))\n\n- Chore: Add error boundary to message component ([#25223](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25223))\n\n  Not crash the whole application if something goes wrong in the MessageList component.\n\n  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40830821/162269915-931c5c3c-c979-4234-b74c-371f67467ce0.png)\n\n- Chore: Add Livechat repo into Monorepo packages ([#25312](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25312))\n\n- Chore: Add missing Swedish livechat translations ([#26048](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/26048) by [@joakimaho](https://github.com/joakimaho))\n\n  Added missing Swedish translations.\n\n- Chore: Add options to debug stdout and rate limiter ([#25336](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25336))\n\n- Chore: Add root package.json to houston files ([#25286](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25286))\n\n  See title\n\n- Chore: Add tests for agents screens ([#25637](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25637) by [@weslley543](https://github.com/weslley543))\n\n- Chore: Add typings for /v1/webdav.getMyAccounts ([#25276](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25276))\n\n- Chore: Add yarn plugin to check node and yarn version ([#25224](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25224))\n\n- Chore: Adding default message parser template ([#26064](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/26064))\n\n- Chore: adjust in some configurations ([#25612](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25612) by [@weslley543](https://github.com/weslley543))\n\n- Chore: Allow endpoints to optionally require authentication ([#26084](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/26084))\n\n- Chore: API test on method GET with params as a number.

([#25910](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25910))\n\n  With the current `dev` pipeline, whenever we modify a package (e.g. `api-client`), we have to kill the meteor proccess and run `yarn dev` again in order for the changes to be compiled and the new output to be used by meteor.\n\n  This has the drawback of taking a little longer to run the dev environment, since we can't cache a watched buid. In the other hand, it reduces the friction of modifying internal packages since we don't need to rebuild the project for changes to take effect.\n\n  This will enable us to move more things to separate packages without affecting the dev experience too much.\n\n- Chore(deps): Bump sharp from 0.30.4 to 0.30.6 ([#25719](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25719) by [@dependabot[bot]](https://github.com/dependabot[bot]))\n\n- i18n: Language update from LingoHub 🤖 on 2022-04-04Z ([#25043](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25043))\n\n- Merge master into develop & Set version to 4.7.0-develop ([#25028](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25028))\n\n- Merge master into develop & Set version to 5.0.0 ([#25702](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25702) by [@felipe-menelau](https://github.com/felipe-menelau))\n\n- Regression:  Admin Avatar Edit endpoint fix ([#26232](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/26232))\n\n- Regression: [VideoConference] Callee client behaves improperly when accepting a call from someone who lost the connection ([#26101](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/26101))\n\n  If the caller loses connection and the callee accepts the call anyway, the client will wait for five seconds for confirmation that they can join the call.

Although this solution works, we need to find a more reliable way of ensuring consistent route changes with up-to-date information.\n\n  ### I'm definitely open for better looking alternatives.

To avoid that under the callback given by `useSyncExternalStore`, we schedule an `onStoreChange` callback call to not make it reside at the same backtrace.\n\n- Regression: Omni-chats not getting routed automatically to bots ([#26267](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/26267))\n\n- Regression: Options overlapping input in Users Autocomplete ([#26309](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/26309))\n\n- Regression: OTR with new React Messages ([#26179](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/26179))\n\n  This PR solves 2 OTR issues with new react message components\n\n\n  - disable the server side message parser for OTR messages\n\n  - adds the stopwatch icon for otr messages\n\n  ### Before\n  <img width=\"548\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-07-08 at 12 58 08 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58601732/177856565-54854a45-e82c-443b-b77d-66ec69d70522.png\">\n\n  ### After\n  <img width=\"549\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-07-08 at 12 55 08 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58601732/177856597-67f7ca01-89ee-4ae9-bcd1-f4b6724db248.png\">\n\n- Regression: Parse outbound phone number removing * putting + char ([#26154](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/26154))\n\n- Regression: Re-add view logs button ([#25876](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25876))\n\n  Re-added the view logs button to the appMenu component so that the user can go directly from the marketplace list of apps to the app info page with the logs tab already open.\n  Demo gif:\n  ![re-add-view-logs-button](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43561537/173681990-86c8a93c-bb2e-4540-824d-b7fbb3161356.gif)\n\n- Regression: Remove 4.0 version banner ([#26251](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/26251))\n\n  Created a migration to disable and dismiss for all users the old 4.0 version banner.\n  It happened when a new admin user has been added.\n\n- Regression: Remove alpha tag and fix initialization process ([#26248](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/26248))\n\n- Regression: remove italic from reaction translation ([#26152](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/26152))\n\n- Regression: Removed CE watermark from VoipFooter ([#26239](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/26239))\n\n  The objective of this change is to remove the CE watermark **only** during an active call.

Now it shows different text based on the \"purchase type\" of the app;\n  -Created a new Pricing & Status display which shows the price when the app is not bought/installed and shows the app status(Enabled/Disabled) when it is bought/installed;\n  -Changed the way the tabs are rendered, now if the app is not installed(and consequently doesn't have logs and settings tab) it will not render these tabs;\n\n  Demo gif:\n  ![new-header-gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43561537/159064599-fd64dfe2-86a3-47da-81ba-1e83f1b87432.gif)\n\n  ## [MKP12   - Configuration Tab](https://app.clickup.com/t/2452gh4)\n  Delivered together with the tab-navigation task.

The goal is that agent should remain online\n  unless agent explicitly logs off.\n  Agent can stop receiving calls in multiple ways due to network loss. Network loss can happen in following ways.\n\n  1. User tries to switch the network. User experiences a glitch of disconnectivity. This can be simulated by turning the network off\n  in the network tab of chrome's dev tool. This can disconnect the UA if the disconnection happens just before the registration refresh.\n\n  2. Second reason is when computer goes in sleep mode.\n\n  3. Third reason is that when asterisk is crashed/in maintenance mode/explicitly stopped.\n\n  Solution:\n  The idea is to detect the network disconnection and start the start the attempts to reconnect.\n  The detection of the disconnection does not happen in case#1. The SIPUA's UserAgent transport does not\n  call onDisconnected when network loss of such kind happens. To tackle this problem, window's online and offline event handlers are\n  used.\n\n  The number of retries is configurable but ideally it is to be kept at -1. Whenever disconnection happens, it should keep on trying to\n  reconnect with increasing backoff time. This behaviour is useful when the asterisk is stopped.\n\n  When the server is disconnected, it should be indicated on the phone button.\n\n- Close room when dismiss wrap up call modal ([#25056](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25056))\n\n- Custom sound error toast messages ([#24515](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/24515) by [@Himanshu664](https://github.com/Himanshu664))\n\n- Deactivating user breaks if user is the only room owner ([#24933](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/24933) by [@sidmohanty11](https://github.com/sidmohanty11))\n\n  ## Before\n\n  https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73601258/160000871-cfc2f2a5-2a59-4d27-8049-7754d003dd48.mp4\n\n\n\n  ## After\n  https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73601258/159998287-681ab475-ff33-4282-82ff-db751c59a392.mp4\n\n- Desktop notification on multi-instance environments ([#25220](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25220))\n\n- End call button disappearing when on-hold ([#24936](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/24936))\n\n- Failure to update Integration History index ([#25473](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25473))\n\n- Fix max-width message block ([#25686](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25686))\n\n- Fixing app contextual bar functionality ([#25615](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25615))\n\n- Fixing Network connectivity issues with SIP client. ([#25391](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25391) by [@amolghode1981](https://github.com/amolghode1981))\n\n  The previous PR https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25170 did not handle the issues completely.\n  This PR is expected to handle\n\n  1. Clearing call related UI when the network is disconnected or switched.\n\n  2. Do clean connectivity. There were few issues discovered in earlier implementation. e.g endpoint would randomly\n  get disconnected after a while. This was due to the fact that the earlier socket disconnection caused the\n  removal of contact on asterisk. This should be fixed in this PR.\n\n  3. This PR contains a lot of logs. This will be removed before the final merge.\n\n- FormData uploads not working ([#25069](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25069))\n\n- Full error message is visible ([#24856](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/24856) by [@Himanshu664](https://github.com/Himanshu664))\n\n- Incorrect websocket url in livechat widget ([#25261](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25261))\n\n- Integrations avatar attribute misuse ([#25283](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25283))\n\n- Invitation links don't redirect to the registration form ([#25082](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25082))\n\n- Message menu action not working on legacy messages.

So a natural solution to solve this is to wait for setting change event 'private-settings-changed'. Then if 'VoIP_Enabled' is updated and it is true, set voipEnabled  to true in useVoipClient.ts (on client side)\n\n  It was realised that the race does not happen because of the database or server noticing the changes late. But because of the time taken to establish the AMI connection with Asterisk.\n\n  Solution:\n\n\n  1. Change apps/meteor/app/voip/server/startup.ts. When VoIP_Enabled is changed, await for Voip.init() to complete and then broadcast connector.statuschanged  with changed value.\n\n  2. From apps/meteor/server/modules/listeners/listeners.module.ts use notifyLoggedInThisInstance to notify all logged in users on current instance.\n\n  3. in apps/meteor/client/providers/CallProvider/hooks/useVoipClient.ts add the event handler that receives this event. Change voipEnabled from constant to state. Change this state based on the 'value' that is received by the handler.\n\n<details>\n<summary>🔍 Minor changes</summary>\n\n\n- Bump body-parser from 1.19.2 to 1.20.0 in /ee/server/services ([#25042](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25042) by [@dependabot[bot]](https://github.com/dependabot[bot]))\n\n- Bump ejson from 2.2.1 to 2.2.2 ([#25057](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25057) by [@dependabot[bot]](https://github.com/dependabot[bot]))\n\n- Bump eslint-plugin-anti-trojan-source from 1.0.6 to 1.1.0 ([#25076](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25076) by [@dependabot[bot]](https://github.com/dependabot[bot]))\n\n- Bump minimist from 1.2.5 to 1.2.6 in /ee/server/services ([#24991](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/24991) by [@dependabot[bot]](https://github.com/dependabot[bot]))\n\n- Bump pino and pino-pretty ([#25052](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25052))\n\n- Bump template-file from 6.0.0 to 6.0.1 ([#25002](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25002) by [@dependabot[bot]](https://github.com/dependabot[bot]))\n\n- Chore: Add /v1/video-conference endpoint types ([#25278](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25278))\n\n- Chore: Add channel endpoints (rest-typings) ([#25279](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25279))\n\n- Chore: Add client folder to CODEOWNERS  ([#25397](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25397))\n\n- Chore: Add error boundary to message component ([#25223](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25223))\n\n  Not crash the whole application if something goes wrong in the MessageList component.\n\n  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40830821/162269915-931c5c3c-c979-4234-b74c-371f67467ce0.png)\n\n- Chore: Add options to debug stdout and rate limiter ([#25336](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25336))\n\n- Chore: Add root package.json to houston files ([#25286](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25286))\n\n  See title\n\n- Chore: Add typings for /v1/webdav.getMyAccounts ([#25276](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25276))\n\n- Chore: Add yarn plugin to check node and yarn version ([#25224](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25224))\n\n- Chore: bump fuselage ([#25605](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25605))\n\n- Chore: Bump fuselage ([#25371](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25371))\n\n- Chore: Bump Fuselage packages ([#25259](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25259))\n\n- Chore: Cancel running jobs if PR is updated ([#24708](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/24708))\n\n- Chore: Chore add validation option to rest endpoints ([#25443](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25443))\n\n- Chore: Code Improvements for #25391 ([#25606](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25606))\n\n- Chore: Convert `UserStatusMenu` to TS ([#25265](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25265))\n\n- Chore: Convert additionalForms ([#25586](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25586))\n\n- Chore: Convert Admin -> Rooms to TS ([#25348](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25348))\n\n- Chore: Convert admin custom sound to tsx ([#25128](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25128))\n\n- Chore: Convert Admin/OAuthApps to TS ([#25277](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25277))\n\n  -

The goal is that agent should remain online\n  unless agent explicitly logs off.\n  Agent can stop receiving calls in multiple ways due to network loss. Network loss can happen in following ways.\n\n  1. User tries to switch the network. User experiences a glitch of disconnectivity. This can be simulated by turning the network off\n  in the network tab of chrome's dev tool. This can disconnect the UA if the disconnection happens just before the registration refresh.\n\n  2. Second reason is when computer goes in sleep mode.\n\n  3. Third reason is that when asterisk is crashed/in maintenance mode/explicitly stopped.\n\n  Solution:\n  The idea is to detect the network disconnection and start the start the attempts to reconnect.\n  The detection of the disconnection does not happen in case#1. The SIPUA's UserAgent transport does not\n  call onDisconnected when network loss of such kind happens. To tackle this problem, window's online and offline event handlers are\n  used.\n\n  The number of retries is configurable but ideally it is to be kept at -1. Whenever disconnection happens, it should keep on trying to\n  reconnect with increasing backoff time. This behaviour is useful when the asterisk is stopped.\n\n  When the server is disconnected, it should be indicated on the phone button.\n\n- Close room when dismiss wrap up call modal ([#25056](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25056))\n\n- Custom sound error toast messages ([#24515](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/24515) by [@Himanshu664](https://github.com/Himanshu664))\n\n- Deactivating user breaks if user is the only room owner ([#24933](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/24933) by [@sidmohanty11](https://github.com/sidmohanty11))\n\n  ## Before\n\n  https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73601258/160000871-cfc2f2a5-2a59-4d27-8049-7754d003dd48.mp4\n\n\n\n  ## After\n  https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73601258/159998287-681ab475-ff33-4282-82ff-db751c59a392.mp4\n\n- Desktop notification on multi-instance environments ([#25220](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25220))\n\n- End call button disappearing when on-hold ([#24936](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/24936))\n\n- FormData uploads not working ([#25069](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25069))\n\n- Full error message is visible ([#24856](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/24856) by [@Himanshu664](https://github.com/Himanshu664))\n\n- Incorrect websocket url in livechat widget ([#25261](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25261))\n\n- Invitation links don't redirect to the registration form ([#25082](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/25082))\n\n- Message menu action not working on legacy messages.

So a natural solution to solve this is to wait for setting change event 'private-settings-changed'. Then if 'VoIP_Enabled' is updated and it is true, set voipEnabled  to true in useVoipClient.ts (on client side)\n\n  It was realised that the race does not happen because of the database or server noticing the changes late. But because of the time taken to establish the AMI connection with Asterisk.\n\n  Solution:\n\n\n  1. Change apps/meteor/app/voip/server/startup.ts. When VoIP_Enabled is changed, await for Voip.init() to complete and then broadcast connector.statuschanged  with changed value.\n\n  2. From apps/meteor/server/modules/listeners/listeners.module.ts use notifyLoggedInThisInstance to notify all logged in users on current instance.\n\n  3. in apps/meteor/client/providers/CallProvider/hooks/useVoipClient.ts add the event handler that receives this event.
