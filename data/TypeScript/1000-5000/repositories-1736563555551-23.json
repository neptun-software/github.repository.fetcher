It's generally useful to include details of your installation, as ThreatMapper is under constant development and we fix bugs fast. `docker images list` and `docker ps -a`, or the equivalent Kubernetes commands are a good start.  Logs from any containers that may be misbehaving are also useful.\n\n### I think I have found a bug in ThreatMapper\n\nIf you believe you've found a security vulnerability, please refer to our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md).\n\nFor all other bugs, please [first check if the issue has already been opened](https://github.com/deepfence/ThreatMapper/issues).  If so, go ahead and add details to the existing issue.\n\nIf the bug appears to be new, please [open a new GitHub Bug report](https://github.com/deepfence/ThreatMapper/issues/new/choose).  The template will prompt you for the information that will help us to understand and address the issue.\n\n### I'd like to share a change to ThreatMapper\n\nThank you.  Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to ThreatMapper](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) with a clear explanation of what you're seeking to achieve, and what you have done.\n\nCode Style: we're flexible and accomodating. Copy the style of the code adjacent to your contributions, keep it clear and easy to understand for other developers and we're all good.\n\n### I have an idea for an enhancement to ThreatMapper\n\nIf it's a well-formed enhancement, please [open a new GitHub Feature request](https://github.com/deepfence/ThreatMapper/issues/new/choose).  Explain the enhancement and any supporting information - who it benefits, why it's important etc.\n\nIf you'd like to discuss the idea before proposing it on GitHub, share it on our [Community Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/deepfence-community/shared_invite/zt-podmzle9-5X~qYx8wMaLt9bGWwkSdgQ) and we will work through it together.\n\n## I'd like to talk to someone directly\n\nYou can reach out to the ThreatMapper community leads at **community *at* deepfence *dot* io**."

It uncovers vulnerable software components, exposed secrets and deviations from good security practice. ThreatMapper uses a combination of agent-based inspection and agent-less monitoring to provide the widest possible coverage to detect threats.\n\nWith ThreatMapper's **ThreatGraph** visualization, you can then identify the issues that present the greatest risk to the security of your applications, and prioritize these for planned protection or remediation.\n\n* [Learn more about ThreatMapper](https://community.deepfence.io/threatmapper/docs/v2.5/) in the product documentation.\n\n* [See ThreatMapper running](https://community.deepfence.io/threatmapper/docs/v2.5/demo) in the live demo sandbox.\n\n## When to use ThreatMapper\n\nThreatMapper carries on the good 'shift left' security practices that you already employ in your development pipelines. It continues to monitor running applications against emerging software vulnerabilities, and monitors the host and cloud configuration against industry-expert benchmarks.\n\nUse ThreatMapper to provide security observability for your production workloads and infrastructure, across cloud, kubernetes, serverless (Fargate) and on-prem platforms.\n\n\n<!--- # (# Getting Started with ThreatMapper) --->\n\n<!--- # (https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3711627/183735806-7afc0dd3-a3ee-4486-a241-06541025a3d4.mp4) --->\n\n\n## Planning your Deployment\n\nThreatMapper consists of two components:\n\n* The **ThreatMapper Management Console** is a container-based application that can be deployed on a single docker host or in a Kubernetes cluster.\n* ThreatMapper monitors running infrastructure using agentless **Cloud Scanner** tasks and agent-based **Sensor Agents**\n\n### The Management Console\n\nYou [deploy the Management Console first](https://community.deepfence.io/threatmapper/docs/v2.5/console/), on a suitable docker host or Kubernetes cluster.  For example, on Docker:\n\n```shell script\n# Docker installation process for ThreatMapper Management Console\n\nwget https://github.com/deepfence/ThreatMapper/raw/release-2.5/deployment-scripts/docker-compose.yml\ndocker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up --detach\n```\n\nOnce the Management Console is up and running, you can [register an admin account and obtain an API key](https://community.deepfence.io/threatmapper/docs/v2.5/console/initial-configuration).\n\n### Cloud Scanner tasks\n\nThreatMapper [Cloud Scanner tasks](https://community.deepfence.io/threatmapper/docs/v2.5/cloudscanner/) are responsible for querying the cloud provider APIs to gather configuration and identify deviations from compliance benchmarks.\n\nThe task is deployed using a Terraform module. The ThreatMapper Management Console will present a basic configuration that may be deployed with Terraform, or you can refer to the expert configurations to fine-tune the deployment ([AWS](https://community.deepfence.io/threatmapper/docs/cloudscanner/aws), [Azure](https://community.deepfence.io/threatmapper/docs/cloudscanner/azure), [GCP](https://community.deepfence.io/threatmapper/docs/cloudscanner/gcp)).\n\n### Sensor Agents\n\nInstall the [sensor agents](https://community.deepfence.io/threatmapper/docs/v2.5/sensors/) on your production or development platforms. The sensors report to the Management Console; they tell it what services they discover, provide telemetry and generate manifests of software dependencies.\n\nThe following production platforms are supported by ThreatMapper sensor agents:\n\n* [Kubernetes](https://community.deepfence.io/threatmapper/docs/v2.5/sensors/kubernetes/): ThreatMapper sensors are deployed as a daemonset in the Kubernetes cluster, using a helm chart.\n* [Docker](https://community.deepfence.io/threatmapper/docs/v2.5/sensors/docker/): ThreatMapper sensors are deployed as a lightweight container.\n* [Amazon ECS](https://community.deepfence.io/threatmapper/docs/v2.5/sensors/aws-ecs): ThreatMapper sensors are deployed as a daemon service using a task definition.\n* [AWS Fargate](https://community.deepfence.io/threatmapper/docs/v2.5/sensors/aws-fargate): ThreatMapper sensors are deployed as a sidecar container, using a task definition.\n* [Bare-Metal or Virtual Machines](https://community.deepfence.io/threatmapper/docs/v2.5/sensors/linux-host/): ThreatMapper sensors are deployed within a lightweight Docker runtime.\n\nFor example, run the following command to start the ThreatMapper sensor on a Docker host:\n\n```shell script\ndocker run -dit \\\n    --cpus=\".2\" \\\n    --name=deepfence-agent \\\n    --restart on-failure \\\n    --pid=host \\\n    --net=host \\\n    --log-driver json-file \\\n    --log-opt max-size=50m \\\n    --privileged=true \\\n    -v /sys/kernel/debug:/sys/kernel/debug:rw \\\n    -v /var/log/fenced \\\n    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\\n    -v /:/fenced/mnt/host/:ro \\\n    -e CUSTOM_TAGS=\"\" \\\n    -e MGMT_CONSOLE_URL=\"---CONSOLE-IP---\" \\\n    -e MGMT_CONSOLE_PORT=\"443\" \\\n    -e DEEPFENCE_KEY=\"---DEEPFENCE-API-KEY---\" \\\n    -e http_proxy=\"\" \\\n    -e https_proxy=\"\" \\\n    -e no_proxy=\"\" \\\n    quay.io/deepfenceio/deepfence_agent_ce:2.5.2\n```\n\nNote: Image tag `quay.io/deepfenceio/deepfence_agent_ce:2.5.2-multiarch` is supported in amd64 and arm64/v8 architectures.\n\nOn a Kubernetes platform, the sensors are installed using [helm chart](https://community.deepfence.io/threatmapper/docs/v2.5/sensors/kubernetes/)\n\n### Next Steps\n\nVisit the [Deepfence ThreatMapper Documentation](https://community.deepfence.io/threatmapper/docs/v2.5/), to learn how to get started and how to use ThreatMapper.\n\n\n# Get in touch\n\nThank you for using ThreatMapper.
