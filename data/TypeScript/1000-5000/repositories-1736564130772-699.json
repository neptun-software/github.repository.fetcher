Works out of the box for most [Node.js][nodejs] projects.\n\n🏃🏽 Instant Value: All basic tools included and configured:\n\n- [TypeScript][typescript] [5.7][typescript-5-7]\n- [ESM][esm]\n- [ESLint][eslint] with some initial rules recommendation\n- [Vitest][vitest] for fast unit testing and code coverage\n- Type definitions for Node.js\n- [Prettier][prettier] to enforce consistent code style\n- NPM [scripts](#available-scripts) for common operations\n- [EditorConfig][editorconfig] for consistent coding style\n- Reproducible environments thanks to [Volta][volta]\n- Example configuration for [GitHub Actions][gh-actions]\n- Simple example of TypeScript code and unit test\n\n🤲 Free as in speech: available under the APLv2 license.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThis project is intended to be used with the latest Active LTS release of [Node.js][nodejs].\n\n### Use as a repository template\n\nTo start, just click the **[Use template][repo-template-action]** link (or the green button). Start adding your code in the `src` and unit tests in the `__tests__` directories.\n\n### Clone repository\n\nTo clone the repository, use the following commands:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/jsynowiec/node-typescript-boilerplate\ncd node-typescript-boilerplate\nnpm install\n```\n\n### Download latest release\n\nDownload and unzip the current **main** branch or one of the tags:\n\n```sh\nwget https://github.com/jsynowiec/node-typescript-boilerplate/archive/main.zip -O node-typescript-boilerplate.zip\nunzip node-typescript-boilerplate.zip && rm node-typescript-boilerplate.zip\n```\n\n## Available Scripts\n\n- `clean` - remove coverage data, cache and transpiled files,\n- `prebuild` - lint source files and tests before building,\n- `build` - transpile TypeScript to ES6,\n- `build:watch` - interactive watch mode to automatically transpile source files,\n- `lint` - lint source files and tests,\n- `prettier` - reformat files,\n- `test` - run tests,\n- `test:watch` - interactive watch mode to automatically re-run tests\n- `test:coverage` - run test and print out test coverage\n\n## Additional Information\n\n### Why include Volta\n\nI recommend to [install][volta-getting-started] Volta and use it to manage your project's toolchain.\n\n[Volta][volta]’s toolchain always keeps track of where you are, it makes sure the tools you use always respect the settings of the project you’re working on. This means you don’t have to worry about changing the state of your installed software when switching between projects. For example, it's [used by engineers at LinkedIn][volta-tomdale] to standardize tools and have reproducible development environments.\n\n### Why Vitest instead of Jest\n\nI recommend using [Vitest][vitest] for unit and integration testing of your TypeScript code.\n\nIn 2023, my team and I gradually switched from Jest to [Vitest][vitest] in all the projects. We've found out that generally, Vitest is faster than Jest, especially for large test suits. Furthermore, Vitest has native support for ES modules, is easier to configure, and has a much nicer developer experience when used with TypeScript. For example, when working with mocks, spies and types.\n\nNevertheless, the choice of specific tooling always depends on the specific requirements and characteristics of the project.\n\n### ES Modules\n\nThis template uses native [ESM][esm]. Make sure to read [this][nodejs-esm], and [this][ts47-esm] first.\n\nIf your project requires CommonJS, you will have to [convert to ESM][sindresorhus-esm].\n\nPlease do not open issues for questions regarding CommonJS or ESM on this repo.\n\n## Backers & Sponsors\n\nSupport this project by becoming a [sponsor][sponsor].\n\n## License\n\nLicensed under the APLv2.
