          "content": "GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                      Version 3, 29 June 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. {http://fsf.org/}\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works.\n\n  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.

Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    {one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.}\n    Copyright (C) {year}  {name of author}\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

If not, see {http://www.gnu.org/licenses/}.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    {{project}}  Copyright (C) {{year}}  {{fullname}}\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n{http://www.gnu.org/licenses/}.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.

HFS tries to detect problems and suggest solutions.\n- Share **even a single file** with our *virtual file system*, even with a different name, all without touching the real file. Present things the way you want!\n- **Watch** all activities in real-time.\n- **Control bandwidth**, decide how much to give.\n- **No intermediaries**, give a huge file to your friend without waiting for it to be uploaded on a server first.\n\nThis is a full rewrite of [the Delphi version](https://github.com/rejetto/hfs2).\n\n## How does it work\n\n- run HFS on your computer, administration page automatically shows up\n- select what files and folders you want to be accessible\n- access those files from a phone or another computer just using a browser\n- possibly create accounts and limit access to files\n\n## Features\n\n- https\n- easy certificate generation\n- unicode\n- virtual file system\n- mobile friendly\n- search\n- accounts\n- resumable downloads & uploads\n- download folders as zip archive\n- delete, move and rename files\n- simple website serving\n- plug-ins\n- real-time monitoring of connections\n- [show some files](https://github.com/rejetto/hfs/discussions/270)\n- speed throttler\n- geographic firewall\n- admin web interface\n- multi-language front-end\n- virtual hosting\n- anti-brute-force (plug-in)\n- [reverse-proxy support](https://github.com/rejetto/hfs/wiki/Reverse-proxy)\n- comments in file descript.ion\n- integrated media player\n- [customizable with html, css and javascript](https://github.com/rejetto/hfs/wiki/Customization)\n- dynamic-dns updater\n\n## Installation\n\nFor service installation instructions, [see our wiki](https://github.com/rejetto/hfs/wiki/Service-installation).\n\nFor Docker installation, [see dedicated repo](https://github.com/damienzonly/hfs-docker).\n\nNB: minimum Windows version required is 8.1 , Windows Server 2012 R2 (because of Node.js 18)\n\n1. go to https://github.com/rejetto/hfs/releases\n2. click on `Assets`\n3. **download** the right version for your system, unzip and launch `hfs` file. \n   - Mac: if you get *\"cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer\"*,\n     you can hold `control` key while clicking, then click `open`.\n   - If you cannot find your system in the list, see next section [Other systems](#other-systems).\n4. the browser should automatically open on `localhost` address, so you can configure the rest in the Admin-panel.\n   - if a browser cannot be opened on the computer where you are installing HFS, \n     you should enter this command in the HFS console: `create-admin <PASSWORD>`\n   - if you cannot access the console (like when you are running as a service), \n       you can [edit the config file to add your admin account](config.md#accounts)\n   - if you don't want to use an editor you can create the file with this command: \n     \n     `echo \"create-admin: PASSWORD\" > config.yaml` \n\nIf you access *Admin-panel* via localhost, by default HFS **won't** require you to login.\nIf you don't like this behavior, disable it in the Admin-panel or enter this console command `config localhost_admin false`.\n\n### Other systems\n\nIf your system is not Windows/Linux/Mac or you just don't want to run the binaries, you can try this alternative version:\n\n1. [install node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 18\n2. execute at command line `npx hfs@latest`\n\nThe `@latest` part is optional, and ensures that you are always up to date.\n\nIf this procedure fails, it may be that you are missing one of [these requirements](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation).\n\nConfiguration and other files will be stored in `%HOME%/.vfs`\n\n## Console commands\n\nIf you have full access to HFS' console, you can enter commands. Start with `help` to have a full list.\n\n## Configuration\n\nFor configuration please see [file config.md](config.md).\n\n### Where is it stored\n\nConfiguration is stored in the file `config.yaml`, exception made for custom HTML which is stored in `custom.html`.\n\nThese files are kept in the Current Working Directory (cwd), which is by default the same folder of `hfs.exe`\nif you are using this kind of distribution on Windows, or `USER_FOLDER/.hfs` on other systems.\nYou can decide a different folder passing `--cwd SOME_FOLDER` parameter at command line.\nAny relative path provided is relative to the *cwd*.\n\n[Check details about config file format](config.md).\n\n## Internationalization\n\nIt is possible to show the Front-end in other languages.\nTranslation for some languages is already provided. If you find an error, consider reporting it\nor [editing the source file](https://github.com/rejetto/hfs/tree/main/src/langs). \n\nIn the Languages section of the Admin-panel you can install additional language files.\n\nIf your language is missing, please consider [translating yourself](https://github.com/rejetto/hfs/wiki/Translation). \n\n## Hidden features\n\n- Appending `#LOGIN` to address will bring up the login dialog\n- Appending ?lang=CODE to address will force a specific language\n- Right-click on toggle-all checkbox will invert each checkbox state\n- Appending `?login=USER:PASSWORD` will automatically log in the browser\n- Appending `?overwrite` on uploads, will override the dont_overwrite_uploading configuration, provided you also have delete permission\n- Appending `?search=PATTERN` will trigger search at start\n- Appending `?onlyFiles` or `?onlyFolders` will limit type of results\n- Appending `?autoplay=shuffle` will trigger show & play; `?autoplay` will not shuffle, but also will not start until the list is complete \n- Right-click on \"check for updates\" will let you input a URL of a version to install\n- Shift+click on a file will show & play\n- Type the name of a file/folder to focus it, and ctrl+backspace to go to parent folder\n- `--consoleFile PATH` will output all stdout and stderr also to a file \n\n## Contribute\n\nThere are several ways to contribute\n\n- [Report bugs](https://github.com/rejetto/hfs/issues/new?labels=bug&template=bug_report.md)\n\n  It's very important to report bugs, and if you are not so sure about it, don't worry, we'll discuss it.\n  If you find important security problems, please [contact us privately](mailto:a@rejetto.com) so that we can publish a fix before\n  the problem is disclosed, for the safety of other users.  \n\n- Use beta versions, and give feedback. \n\n  While betas have more problems, you'll get more features and give a huge help to the project. \n\n- [Translate to your language](https://github.com/rejetto/hfs/wiki/Translation).\n\n- [Suggest ideas](https://github.com/rejetto/hfs/discussions)\n\n  While the project should not become too complex, yours may be an idea for a plugin.\n\n- Write guides or make videos for other users. [We got a wiki](https://github.com/rejetto/hfs/wiki)! \n\n- Submit your code\n\n  If you'd like to make a change yourself in the code, please first open an \"issue\" or \"discussion\" about it,\n  so we'll try to cooperate and understand what's the best path for it.\n\n- [Make a plugin](dev-plugins.md)\n\n  A plugin can change the look (a theme), and/or introduce a new functionality.\n\n## More\n\n- [APIs](https://github.com/rejetto/hfs/wiki/APIs)\n\n- [Build yourself](dev.md)\n\n- [License](https://github.com/rejetto/hfs/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)\n\n- Flag images are public-domain, downloaded from https://flagpedia.net"

Bookmark it.\n      If your port is 8000 the address will be http://localhost:8000/~/admin\n- passing via command line at start in the form `--NAME VALUE`\n- using envs in the form `HFS_<uppercase property name>`, like `HFS_PORT=80` if you want to change the config `port`, but same applies to any other config available,\n- directly editing the `config.yaml` file. As soon as you save it is reloaded and changes are applied\n  - if you don't want to use an editor, consider typing this (example) command inside the folder where the config file is:\n    `echo \"port: 1080\" >> config.yaml` \n- after HFS has started you can enter console command in the form `config NAME VALUE`\n- setting special env `HFS_ENV_BOOTSTRAP=true` will disable other envs when file config.yaml already exists. \n\n`NAME` stands for the property name that you want to change.

As soon as the account is created, this entry is removed. \n\n#### Virtual File System (VFS)\n\nThe virtual file system is a tree of files and folders, collectively called *nodes*.\nBy default, a node is a folder, unless you provide for it a source that's a file.\nValid keys in a node are:\n- `name`: this is the name we'll use to display this file/folder. If not provided, HFS will infer it from the source. At least `name` or `source` must be provided.\n- `source`: absolute or relative path of where to get the content\n- `children`: just for folders, specify its virtual children.\n  Value is a list and its entries are nodes.\n- `rename`: similar to name, but it's  from the parent node point.\n  Use this to change the name of  entries that are read from the source, not listed in the VFS.\n  Value is a dictionary, where the key is the original name. No UI.\n- `mime`: specify what mime to use for this resource. Use \"auto\" for automatic detection.\n- `url`: when this value is present, the element is a link to the URL you specify.\n- `target`: optional, for links only, used to [open the link in a new browser](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a#target). E.g. `_blank`\n- `accept`:  valid only on upload folders, used to restrict the type of files you can upload. E.g. `.zip,.rar`\n- `default`: to be used with a folder where you want to serve a default html. E.g.: \"index.html\". Using this will make `mime` default to \"auto\".\n  The value must be an absolute or relative path in the VFS, not a path on disk. It works also with other type of files.  \n- `can_read`: specify who can download this entry. Value is a `WhoCan` descriptor, which is one of these values\n    - `true`: anyone can, even people who didn't log in. This is normally the default value.\n    - `false`: no one can.\n    - `\"*\"`: any account can, i.e. anyone who logged in.\n    - `[ frank, peter ]`: the list of accounts who can.\n    - `can_SOMETHING`: copy the permission from another permission. This is convenient to have same value for different permissions. E.g. `can_see` \n    - `{ this?: WhoCan, children?: WhoCan }`: this form is useful only for folders. By using it, you can have\n      different permission for the folder itself and its children. For example, having only the `this` property\n      will make the permission limited to the folder and not be inherited by children. Otherwise, having only\n      the `children` will make the permission have no effect on the folder, but only on its content.  \n        - `this` specifies permission for this folder\n        - `children` specifies permission for the content.\n- `can_see`: specify who can see this element. Even if a user can download you can still make the file not appear in the list.\n  Value is a `WhoCan` descriptor, refer above. Default is `can_read`.\n- `can_upload`: specify who can upload. Applies to folders with a source. Default is none.\n- `can_list`: specify who can see the content of a folder. Default is `can_read`.\n- `can_archive`: specify who can get the zip a folder or a set of files. Default is `can_read`.\n- `can_delete`: specify who can delete. Applies to folders with a source. Default is none.\n- `masks`: maps a file mask to a set of properties as the one documented in this section. E.g.\n  ```\n  myfile.txt:\n    can_see: false\n    can_read: false\n  \"**/*.mp3\":\n    can_read: false\n  \"*.jpg|*.png\": \n    mime: auto\n  ```\n  Rules on top have priority over bottom rules. Inner rules have priority over parent's rules.\n  A mask can carry any node property (even property \"masks\") plus a special property `maskOnly` (optional) to restrict\n  the application of the mask to only files or folders, just by specifying exactly `files` or `folders`\n\nPermissions set on an inner element will override inherited permissions. This means that you can restrict access to folder1,\nand yet decide to give free access to folder1/subfolder2.\n\n#### Accounts\n\nAll accounts go under `accounts:` property, as a dictionary where the key is the username.\nE.g.\n```\naccounts:\n    admin:\n        password: hello123\n        admin: true\n    frank:\n        password: another\n        belongs: group1\n    guest:\n        password: guest\n    group1:\n```\n\nAs soon as the config is read HFS will encrypt passwords (if necessary) in a non-reversible way. It means that `password` property is replaced with an encrypted property: `srp`.\n\nAs you can see in the example, `group1` has no password. This implies that you cannot log in as `group1`, but still `group1` exists and its purpose is to\ngather multiple accounts and refer to them collectively as `group1`, so you can quickly share powers among several accounts.\n\nFor each account entries, this is the list of properties you can have:\n\n- `ignore_limits` to ignore speed limits. Default is `false`.\n- `redirect` provide a URL if you want the user to be redirected upon login. Default is none.\n- `admin` set `true` if you want to let this account log in to the Admin-panel. Default is `false`.\n- `belongs` an array of usernames of other accounts from which to inherit their permissions. Default is none.\n- `disable_password_change` set `true` if you want to forbid password change for users. Default is `false`.\n\n### Specify another file\n\nDo you need to load a different config file that's not `config.yaml`?\nUse this parameter at command line `--config PATH` or similarly with an env `HFS_CONFIG`.\nThe path you specify can be either a folder, or full-path to the file.\n"

          "content": "# For plug-in makers\n\nIf the information you are searching for is not in this document, [please ask](https://github.com/rejetto/hfs/discussions). \n\nA plug-in is a folder with a `plugin.js` file in it. To install a plugin you just copy the folder into the `plugins` folder.\nYou will find `plugins` folder near `config.yaml`, and then in `USER_FOLDER/.hfs` for Linux and MacOS, or near `hfs.exe` on Windows. \n\nPlug-ins can be hot-swapped, and to some extent can be edited without restarting the server.\n\nEach plug-in has access to the same set of features.\nNormally you'll have a plug-in that's a theme, and another that's a firewall,\nbut nothing is preventing a single plug-in from doing both tasks.\n\n## Backend / Frontend\n\nPlugins can run both in backend (the server) and frontend (the browser). Frontend files reside in the \"public\" folder, while all the rest is backend.\n\n## Exported object\n\n`plugin.js` is a javascript module (executed by Node.js), and its main way to communicate with HFS is by exporting things.\nFor example, it can define its description like this \n```js\nexports.description = \"I'm a nice plugin\"\n```\n\nThe set of things exported goes by the name \"exported object\".\n\n### init\n\nA plugin can define an `init` function like this:\n```js\nexports.init = function(api) {\n  return { frontend_css: 'mystyle.css' }  \n}\n```\n\nThe init function is called by HFS when the module is loaded and should return an object with more things to\nadd/merge to the exported object. In the example above we are asking a css file to be loaded in the frontend.\nSince it's a basic example, you could have simply defined it like this:\n```js\nexports.frontend_css = 'mystyle.css'\n```\nbut in more complex cases you'll need to go through the `init`.\nIf you need to access the API you must use `init`, since that's the only place where it is found, otherwise you\ncan just use `exports`. The parameter `api` of the init is an object containing useful things [we'll see later](#api-object).\n\nLet's first look at the things you can export:\n\n## Things a plugin can export\n\nAll the following properties are optional unless otherwise specified.\n\n- `description: string` try to explain what this plugin is for. (JSON syntax)\n- `version: number` use progressive numbers to distinguish each release\n- `apiRequired: number | [min:number,max:number]` declare version(s) for which the plugin is designed. Mandatory. [Refer to API version history](#api-version-history)   \n- `isTheme: boolean | \"light\" | \"dark\"` set true if this is a theme that's not supposed to work together with other themes. \n  Running a theme will cause other themes to be stopped. Missing this, HFS will check if the name of the plugin ends with `-theme`.\n  Special values \"light\" and \"dark\" to declare whether the theme is (for example) dark and forces HFS to use dark-theme as a base.   \n- `preview: string | string[]` one or more URLs to images you want to show before your plugin is downloaded. (JSON syntax) \n- `depend: { repo: string, version: number }[]` declare what other plugins this depends on. (JSON syntax)\n- `beforePlugin: string` control the order this plugin is executed relative to another\n- `afterPlugin: string` control the order this plugin is executed relative to another\n- `repo: string | object` pointer to a GitHub repo where this plugin is hosted. (JSON syntax)\n    - the string form is for GitHub repos. Example: \"rejetto/file-icons\"\n    - the object form will point to other custom repo. Object properties:\n        - `web: string` link to a web page\n        - `main: string` link to the plugin.js (can be relative to `web`)\n        - `zip: string` link to the zip with the whole plugin (can be relative to `web`)\n        - `zipRoot: string` optional, in case the plugin in the zip is inside a folder\n\n      Example:\n      ```\n      { \n        \"web\": \"https://github.com/rejetto/file-icons\", \n        \"zip\": \"/archive/refs/heads/main.zip\",\n        \"zipRoot\": \"file-icons-main/dist\", \n        \"main\": \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rejetto/file-icons/main/dist/plugin.js\" \n      }\n      ```\n      Note that in this example we are pointing to a github repo just for clarity. You are not supposed to use this\n      complicated object form to link github, use the string form.\n      Plugins with custom repos are not included in search results, but the update feature will still work.\n\nWARNING: All the properties above are a bit special and must go in `exports` only (thus, not returned in `init`) and the syntax\nused must be strictly JSON (thus, no single quotes, only double quotes for strings and objects), and must fit one line.\n\n- `init: (api: object) => void | object | function` described in the previous section. If an object is returned, \n  it will be merged with other \"exported\" properties described in this section, so you can return `{ unload }` for example.\n  If you return a function, this is just a shorter way to return the `unload`.\n- `frontend_css: string | string[]` path to one or more css files that you want the frontend to load. These are to be placed in the `public` folder (refer below).\n  You can also include external files, by entering a full URL. Multiple files can be specified as `['file1.css', 'file2.css']`.  \n- `frontend_js: string | string[]` path to one or more js files that you want the frontend to load. These are to be placed in the `public` folder (refer below).\n  You can also include external files, by entering a full URL.\n- `middleware: (Context) => Promisable<void | function>` a function that will be used as a middleware: use this to interfere with http activity.\n  \n  ```js\n  exports.middleware = ctx => {\n    ctx.body = \"You are in the wrong place\"\n    ctx.status = 404\n  }\n  ```\n  You'll find more examples by studying plugins like `antidos` or `antibrute`.\n  To interrupt other middlewares on this http request, call `ctx.stop()`.\n  In past versions stop() was not available, and to get the same effect you'd `return true`, therefore a possible way\n  to be compatible with older versions is to `return ctx.stop?.() || true`. \n\n  If you want to execute something in the \"upstream\" of middlewares, return a function. This function can be async.\n  You can read more in [the ctx object](#the-ctx-object) section.\n\n- `unload: function` called when unloading a plugin. This is a good place for example to clearInterval().\n- `onDirEntry: ({ entry: DirEntry, listUri: string, ctx, node: VfsNode  }) => Promisable<void | false>` \n  by providing this callback you can manipulate the record that is sent to the frontend (`entry`),\n  or you can return false to exclude this entry from the results. Refer to source `frontend/src/state.ts`.\n- `config: { [key]: FieldDescriptor }` declare a set of admin-configurable values owned by the plugin\n  that will be displayed inside Admin-panel for change. Each property is identified by its key,\n  and the descriptor is another object with options about the field. \n\n  Eg: you want a `message` text. You add this to your `plugin.js`:\n  ```js\n  exports.config = { message: {} }\n  ``` \n  This will produce a configuration form in the admin-panel.\n  Once the admin has customized the value, the latter will be saved in the main config file, under the `plugins_config` property.\n    ```yaml\n    plugins_config:\n      name_of_the_plugin:\n        message: Hi there!\n    ```\n\n  When necessary your plugin will read its value using `api.getConfig('message')` in the backend, \n  or `HFS.getPluginConfig('message')` in the frontend, but the latter must be enabled using the `frontend` flag in the config.\n  \n- `configDialog: DialogOptions` object to override dialog options. Please refer to sources for details.\n- `onFrontendConfig: (config: object) => void | object` manipulate config values exposed to frontend.\n- `customHtml: object | () => object` return custom-html sections programmatically.\n- `customRest: { [name]: (parameters: object) => any }` declare backend functions to be called by frontend with `HFS.customRestCall`\n- `customApi: { [name]: (parameters) => any }` declare functions to be called by other plugins (only backend, not frontend) using `api.customApiCall` (documented below) \n\n### FieldDescriptor\n\nA FieldDescriptor is an object and can be empty. Currently, these optional properties are supported:\n- `type: 'string' | 'number' | 'boolean' | 'select' | 'multiselect' | 'real_path' | 'vfs_path' | 'array' | 'username' | 'color'` . Default is `string`.\n- `label: string` what name to display next to the field. Default is based on `key`.\n- `defaultValue: any` value to be used when nothing is set. Default is undefined.\n- `helperText: string` extra text printed next to the field.\n- `showIf: (values: object) => boolean` only show this field if the function returns truthy. Must not reference variables of the outer scope.\n- `frontend: boolean` expose this setting on the frontend, so that javascript can access it \n   using `HFS.getPluginConfig()[CONFIG_KEY]` but also css can access it as `var(--PLUGIN_NAME-CONFIG_KEY)`.\n   Hint: if you need to use a numeric config in CSS but you need to add a unit (like `em`),\n   the trick is to use something like this `calc(var(--plugin-something) * 1em)`.\n\nBased on `type`, other properties are supported:\n- `string`\n    - `multiline: boolean`. Default is `false`.\n- `number`\n    - `min: number`\n    - `max: number`\n- `select`\n    - `options: { [label]: AnyJsonValue }`\n- `multiselect` it's like `select` but its result is an array of values.\n- `array` list of objects\n    - `fields`: an object of `FieldDescriptor`s, i.e. same format as `config`.\n      This field will be use for both the configuration of the grid's column, and the form's field.\n      Other than properties of `FieldDescriptor` you get these extra properties:\n        - `$column`: where you can put all the properties you want specifically to be set on the [grid's column](https://mui.com/x/api/data-grid/grid-col-def/).\n        - `$width`: a shortcut property that can substitute `$column: { width }` or `$column: { flex }`.\n          By default, a column gets flex:1 unless you specify $width. A value of 8 and higher is considered width's pixels,\n          while lower are flex-values.\n- `real_path` path to server disk\n    - `files: boolean` allow to select a file. Default is `true`.\n    - `folders: boolean` allow to select a folder. Default is `false`.\n    - `defaultPath: string` what path to start from if no value is set. E.g. __dirname if you want to start with your plugin's folder.\n    - `fileMask: string` restrict files that are displayed. E.g. `*.jpg|*.png`\n- `username`\n    - `groups: undefined | boolean` true if you want only groups, false if you want only users. Default is undefined.\n    - `multiple: boolean` if you set this to true, the field will allow the selection of multiple accounts, \n      and the resulting value will be array of strings, instead of a string. Default is false.\n\n## api object\n\nThe `api` object you get as parameter of the `init` contains the following:\n\n- `getConfig(key?: string): any` get plugin's config value, described in `exports.config`.\n  If key is not provided, an object with all keys is returned. \n  \n- `setConfig(key: string, value: any)` set plugin's config value.\n\n- `subscribeConfig(key: string, callback: (value: any) => void): Unsubscriber`\n  will call `callback` with initial value and then at each change.\n\n- `getHfsConfig(key: string): any` similar to getConfig, but retrieves HFS' config instead.\n\n- `log(...args)` print log in a standard form for plugins.\n\n- `addBlock({ ip, expire?, comment?, disabled? }, merge?)` add a blocking rule on specified IP. You can use merge to\n   append the IP to an existing rule (if any, otherwise is created). Eg: \n    ```js  \n    // try to append to existing rule, by comment\n    addBlock({ ip: '1.2.3.4' }, { comment: \"banned by my plugin\" }) \n    ```\n\n- `Const: object` all constants of the `const.ts` file are exposed here. E.g. BUILD_TIMESTAMP, API_VERSION, etc.\n\n- `getConnections(): Connections[]` retrieve current list of active connections.\n\n- `getCurrentUsername(ctx: Context): string` an empty string if no user is logged in in the specified session, or its username otherwise.\n\n- `storageDir: string` folder where a plugin is supposed to store run-time data. This folder is preserved during\n  an update of the plugin, while the rest could be deleted.\n\n- `events` this is the main events emitter used by HFS.\n  These are backend side events, not to be confused with frontend ones. It's not the standard EventEmitter class,\n  and the API is slightly different.\n\n    - `events.on(name: string, listener: Callback): Callback`\n\n      call your listener every time the event is emitted.\n      The returned callback will unsubscribe the event.\n\n    - `events.once(name: string, listener?: Callback): Promise<eventArguments>`\n\n      when the event is emitted, your (optional) listener is called, and the returned promise is resolved.\n\n- `require(module: string)` use this instead of standard `require` function to access modules already loaded by HFS. Example:\n  ```js\n  const { watchLoad } = api.require('./watchLoad')\n  ```\n  You *should* try to keep this kind of behavior at its minimum, as name of sources and elements can change, and your\n  plugin can become incompatible with future versions.\n  If you need something for your plugin that's not covered by `api`, you can test it with this method, but you should\n  then discuss it on the forum because an addition to `api` is your best option for making a future-proof plugin.\n\n- `customApiCall(method: string, ...params): any[]` this will invoke other plugins if they define `method`\n  exported inside `customApi: object`\n\n- `openDb(filename: string, options): Promise<{ get, put, del, close, unlink, sublevel }>` LevelDB-like class for storage.\n  The specified file name will be stored in the \"storage\" folder of the plugin, by default.\n  DB is automatically closed when the plugin is unloaded. Refer to [dedicated documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rejetto/kvstorage) for details.\n\n- `notifyClient(channel: string, eventName: string, data?: any)` send a message to those frontends that are on the same channel.\n\n- `i18n(ctx: Context): Promise<{ t }>` if you need to translate messages inside http body, without the GUI, use this function  \n  to instantiate translation for the language of the browser. You can then use the `t` function as documented in [dedicated section](Internationalization-i18n).  \n\n- `ctxBelongsTo(ctx: Context, accounts: strings[]): boolean` check if the current username, or any group it belongs to, matches the provided accounts list.  \n\n- `misc` many functions and constants available in [misc.ts](https://github.com/rejetto/hfs/blob/main/src/misc.ts).\n  These are not documented, probably never will, and are subject to change without notifications,\n  but you can study the sources if you are interested in using them. It's just a shorter version of `api.require('./misc')`\n\n## Frontend specific\n\nThe following information applies to the default frontend, and may not apply to a custom one.\n\nOnce your script is loaded into the frontend (via `frontend_js`), you will have access to the `HFS` object in the global scope.\n\nThe HFS object contains many properties:\n- `onEvent` this is the main API function inside the frontend. Refer to dedicated section below.\n- `apiCall`\n- `useApi`\n- `reloadList`\n- `logout`\n- `prefixUrl: string` normally an empty string, it will be set in case a [reverse-proxy wants to mount HFS on a path](https://github.com/rejetto/hfs/wiki/Reverse-proxy).\n- `state: StateObject` [object with many values in it](https://github.com/rejetto/hfs/blob/main/frontend/src/state.ts)\n  - you'll find here some interesting values, like `username` and `loading`. \n- `watchState(key: string, callback): function`\n    - watch the `key` property of the state object above\n    - `callback(newValue)` will be called at each change\n    - use returned callback to stop watching\n- `useSnapState(): StateObject` React hook version of the `state` object above \n- `React` whole React object, as for `require('react')` (JSX syntax is not supported here)\n- `h` shortcut for React.createElement\n- `t` [translator function](https://github.com/rejetto/hfs/blob/main/frontend/src/i18n.ts)\n- `_` [lodash library](https://lodash.com/docs/)\n- `toast(message: string | ReactElement, type: ToastType='info')`\n    - show a brief message that doesn't steal focus\n    - `ToastType = 'error' | 'warning' | 'info' | 'success'`\n- `dialogLib` this exposes all functions available in [dialog.ts](https://github.com/rejetto/hfs/blob/main/frontend/src/dialog.ts), \n  for example alertDialog and newDialog. These are not documented yet, and subject to change without notification,\n  but you can study the sources if you are interested in using them.\n- `misc` many functions and constants available in [cross.ts](https://github.com/rejetto/hfs/blob/main/src/cross.ts). These are not documented, probably never will, and are subject to change without notifications, but you can study the sources if you are interested in using them.\n- `navigate(uri: string)` use this if you have to change the page address without causing reload\n- `emit(name: string, params?: object): any[]` use this to emit a custom event. Prefix name with your plugin name to avoid conflicts.\n- `Icon: ReactComponent` Properties:\n    - `name: string` refer to file `icons.ts` for names, but you can also enter an emoji instead.\n- `iconBtn(icon: string, onClick: function, props?: any)` render a React Icon Button. For icons, refer to `Icon` component.\n- `domOn(eventName: string, cb: function, { target }?): function` convenient alternative to addEventListener/removeEventListener.\n  The default target is window. Returns a callback to remove the listener. \n- `useBatch(worker, job): { data }` this is a bit complicated, please refer to source `shared/react.ts`. \n- `getNotifications(channel: string, cb: (eventName: string, data:any) => void)`\n  receive messages when the backend uses `notifyClient` on the same channel. \n- `html(html: string): ReactNode` convert html code to React\n- `debounceAsync: function` like lodash.debounce, but also avoids async invocations to overlap.\n  For details please refer to `src/debounceAsync.ts`.\n- `loadScript(uri: string): Promise` load a js file. If uri is relative, it is based on the plugin's public folder.\n- `customRestCall(name: string, parameters?: object): Promise<any>` call backend functions exported with `customRest`.\n- `userBelongsTo(groupOrUsername: string): boolean` returns true if logged in account belongs to the specified group name. \n  Returns true if the specified name is the one of the logged in account.\n- `DirEntry: class_constructor(n :string, otherProps?: DirEntry)` this is the class of the objects inside `HFS.state.list`;\n  in case you need to add to the list, do it by instantiating this class. E.g. `new HFS.DirEntry(name)`\n- `fileShow(entry: DirEntry, options?: { startPlaying: true )` open file-show on the specified entry.\n- `copyTextToClipboard(text: string)` self-explanatory.\n- `urlParams: object` you'll find each parameter in the URL mapped in this object as string.\n- `fileShowComponents: { Video, Audio }` exposes standard components used by file-show. Can be useful if you need extend them, inside `fileShow` event.  \n\nThe following properties are accessible only immediately at top-level; don't call it later in a callback.\n- `getPluginConfig()` returns object of all config keys that are declared frontend-accessible by this plugin.\n- `getPluginPublic()` returns plugin's public folder, with final slash. Useful to point to public files.\n\n### Frontend API events\n\nAPI at this level is done with frontend-events, that you can handle by calling\n\n```typescript\nHFS.onEvent(eventName: string, callback: (parameters: object) => any)\n``` \n\nParameters of your callback and meaning of returned value varies with the event name.\nRefer to the specific event for further information.\nHFS object is the same you access globally. Here just for legacy, consider it deprecated.\n\nSome frontend events can return HTML, which can be expressed in several ways:\n- as a string containing markup\n- as DOM Nodes, using methods like `document.createElement()`\n- as a ReactElement\n- as an array of ReactNode\n- `null`, `undefined`, `false`, and empty strings will be discarded\n\nThese events will receive a `def` property (in addition event's specific properties),\nwith the default content that will be displayed if no callback return a valid output.\nYou can decide to embed such default content inside your content.\nYou can produce output for such events also by adding sections (with same name as the event) to file `custom.html`.\n\nThis is a list of available frontend-events, with respective object parameter and output.\n\n- `additionalEntryDetails`\n  - you receive each entry of the list, and optionally produce HTML code that will be added in the `entry-details` container.\n  - parameter `{ entry: DirEntry }`\n\n    The `DirEntry` type is an object with the following properties:\n    - `name: string` name of the entry.\n    - `ext: string` just the extension part of the name, dot excluded and lowercase.\n    - `isFolder: boolean` true if it's a folder.\n    - `n: string` name of the entry, including relative path when searched in sub-folders.\n    - `uri: string` relative url of the entry.\n    - `s?: number` size of the entry, in bytes. It may be missing, for example for folders.\n    - `t?: Date` generic timestamp, combination of creation-time and modified-time.\n    - `c?: Date` creation-time.\n    - `m?: Date` modified-time.\n    - `p?: string` permissions missing\n    - `cantOpen: boolean` true if current user has no permission to open this entry\n    - `getNext/getPrevious: ()=>DirEntry` return next/previous DirEntry in list\n    - `getNextFiltered/getPreviousFiltered: ()=>DirEntry` as above, but considers the filtered-list instead\n    - `getDefaultIcon: ()=>ReactElement` produces the default icon for this entry\n  - output `Html`\n- `entry`\n  - you receive each entry of the list, and optionally produce HTML code that will completely replace the entry row/slot.\n  - parameter `{ entry: DirEntry }` (refer above for DirEntry object)\n  - output `Html | null` return null if you want to hide this entry\n- `afterEntryName`\n  - you receive each entry of the list, and optionally produce HTML code that will be added after the name of the entry.\n  - parameter `{ entry: DirEntry }` (refer above for DirEntry object)\n  - output `Html`\n- `entryIcon`\n  - you receive an entry of the list and optionally produce HTML that will be used in place of the standard icon.\n  - parameter `{ entry: DirEntry }` (refer above for DirEntry object)\n  - output `Html`\n- `beforeHeader` & `afterHeader`\n  - use this to produce content that should go right before/after the `header` part\n  - output `Html`\n- `beforeLogin`\n  - no parameter\n  - output `Html`\n- `fileMenu`\n  - add or manipulate entries of the menu. If you return something, that will be added to the menu.\n    You can also delete or replace the content of the `menu` array.\n  - parameter `{ entry: DirEntry, menu: FileMenuEntry[], props: FileMenuProp[] }`\n  - output `undefined | FileMenuEntry | FileMenuEntry[]`\n    ```typescript\n    interface FileMenuEntry {\n      id?: string, \n      label: ReactNode,\n      subLabel: ReactNode,\n      href?: string, // use this if you want your entry to be a link\n      icon?: string, // supports: emoji, name from a limited set\n      onClick?: () => (Promisable<boolean>) // return false to not close menu dialog\n      //...rest is transfered to <a> element, for example 'target', or 'title' \n    }\n    type FileMenuProp = { id?: string, label: ReactNode, value: ReactNode } | ReactElement\n    ```\n    Example, if you want to remove the 'show' item of the menu:\n    ```typescript\n    HFS.onEvent('fileMenu', ({ entry, menu }) => {\n    const index = menu.findIndex(x => x.id === 'show')\n    if (index >= 0)\n      menu.splice(index, 1)\n    })\n    ```\n    or if you like lodash, you can simply `HFS._.remove(menu, { id: 'show' })`\n- `fileShow`\n  - you receive an entry of the list, and optionally produce React Component for visualization.\n  - parameter `{ entry: DirEntry }` (refer above for DirEntry object)\n  - output `ReactComponent`\n- `showPlay`\n  - emitted on each file played inside file-show. Use setCover if you want to customize the background picture.\n  - parameter `{ entry: DirEntry, setCover(uri: string), meta: { title, album, artist, year } }`\n- `menuZip`\n  - parameter `{ def: ReactNode }`\n  - output `Html`\n- `userPanelAfterInfo`\n  - no parameter\n  - output `Html`\n- `uriChanged`\n  - DEPRECATED: use `watchState('uri', callback)` instead.\n  - parameter `{ uri: string, previous: string }`\n- `sortCompare`\n  - you can decide the order of entries by comparing two entries.\n    Return a negative value if entry `a` must appear before `b`, or positive if you want the opposite.\n    Return zero or any falsy value if you want to leave the order to what the user decided in his options.\n  - parameter `{ a: DirEntry, b: DirEntry }`\n  - output `number | undefined`\n- `enableEntrySelection`\n  - selection of multiple entries is used for some standard actions like deletion or zip. \n    When none of such standard actions is permitted on an entry, its selection control (checkbox) is disabled. \n    If you want to override this behavior, because you have a custom action that makes use of the selection, return `true`.\n  - parameter `{ entry: DirEntry }`\n  - output `boolean`\n- `entryToggleSelection`\n  - an entry is being un/selected\n  - parameter `{ entry: DirEntry }`\n  - can be prevented\n- `newListEntries`\n  - new entries for the list have being fetched from the server\n  - parameter `{ entries: DirEntry[] }`\n- All of the following have no parameters and you are supposed to output `Html` that will be displayed in the described place:\n-   `appendMenuBar` inside menu-bar, at the end\n  - `afterMenuBar` between menu-bar and breadcrumbs\n  - `afterList` at the end of the files list\n  - `footer` at the bottom of the screen, even after the clipboard-bar (when visible)\n  - `unauthorized` displayed behind the login dialog accessing a protected folder\n  - `userPanelAfterInfo` visible to logged-in users, after the click on the button with their username, between user-info and buttons\n\n## Backend events\n\nThese events happen in the server, and not in the browser.\nYou can listen to these events accessing `api.events` in the `init` function of the plugin.\nE.g.:\n```js\nexports.init = function(api) {\n    const cancelListening = api.events.on('spam', () => 'spam received!')\n    // pass the canceller callback to the 'unload', so the subscription will be correctly disposed when the plugin is stopped   \n    return { unload: cancelListening }\n}\n```\n\nOf course the example above can be written more shortly as follows, but they are equivalent.\n\n```js\nexports.init = api => ({\n    unload: api.events.on('spam', () => 'spam received!')\n})\n```\n\n### Async\n\nOnly where specified, events support async listeners, like\n```js\napi.events.on('deleting', async () => your-code-here)\n```\n\n### Stop, the way you prevent default behavior\n\nSome events allow you to stop their default behavior, by returning `api.events.preventDefault`.\nThis is reported in the list below with the word \"preventable\".\n\n```js\napi.events.on('deleting', ({ node }) => node.source.endsWith('.jpg'))\n```\n\nThe example above will return false only when the file is NOT ending with .jpg, thus allowing only jpg files to be deleted.\n\n### Available events\n\nThis section is still partially documented, and you may need to have a look at the sources for further details.\n\n- `deleting`\n  - parameters: { node, ctx }\n  - called just before trying to delete a file or folder (which still may not exist and fail)\n  - async supported\n  - preventable\n- `login`\n- `logout`\n- `attemptingLogin`\n- `failedLogin`\n- `config ready`\n- `config.KEY` where KEY is the key of a config that has changed\n- `connectionClosed`\n- `connection`\n- `connectionUpdated`\n- `console`\n- `dynamicDnsError`\n- `httpsReady`\n- `spam`\n- `log`\n- `error_log`\n- `failedLogin`\n- `accountRenamed`\n- `pluginDownload`\n- `pluginUpdated`\n- `pluginInstalled`\n- `pluginUninstalled`\n- `pluginStopped`\n- `pluginStarted`\n- `uploadStart`\n  - parameters: { ctx, writeStream } \n  - preventable\n  - return: callback to call when upload is finished\n- `uploadFinished`\n- `publicIpsChanged`\n  - parameters: { IPs, IP4, IP6, IPX }\n- `newSocket`\n  - parameters: { socket,ip }\n  - preventable\n- `getList`\n    - parameters: { node, ctx }\n    - called when get=list on legit requests to ?get=list\n    - async supported\n    - stoppable\n\n# Notifications (backend-to-frontend events)\n\nYou can send messages from the backend (plugin.js) using `api.notifyClient`, and receive on the frontend\nusing `HFS.getNotifications`. Find details in the reference above.\n\nExample:\n\n`plugin.js`\n```js\nexports.init = api => {\n    const t = setInterval(() => api.notifyClient('test', 'message', 'hello'), 5000)\n    return {\n        frontend_js: 'main.js',\n        unload() {\n            clearInterval(t)\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n`public/main.js`\n```js\nHFS.getNotifications('test', console.log)\n```\n\n# The `ctx` object\n\nHFS is currently based on [Koa](https://koajs.com), so you'll see some things related to it in the backend API.\nThe most prominent is the `ctx` object, short for \"context\".\nTo know what the Context object contains please refer to [Koa documentation](https://github.com/koajs/koa/blob/master/docs/api/context.md).\n\nHFS adds a few useful properties in the `ctx.state` object. Some of it may turn to be useful,\nso we prepared this list as a quick reference, but beware that it may become out of date and needs a double check.\nIf so, please report, and we'll do our best to update it asap.\nWhere information is too little, you'll have to consult the source code, sorry.\n\n        originalPath: string // before roots is applied\n        browsing?: string // for admin/monitoring\n        dontLog?: boolean // don't log this request\n        logExtra?: object\n        completed?: Promise<unknown>\n        spam?: boolean // this request was marked as spam\n        params: Record<string, any>\n        account?: Account // user logged in\n        revProxyPath: string\n        connection: Connection\n        skipFilters?: boolean\n        vfsNode?: VfsNode\n        includesLastByte?: boolean\n        serveApp?: boolean // please, serve the frontend app\n        uploadPath?: string // current one\n        uploads?: string[] // in case of request with potentially multiple uploads (POST), we register all filenames (no full path)\n        length?: number\n        originalStream?: typeof ctx.body\n        uploadDestinationPath?: string // this value is the temporary file in uploadStart and the final one in uploadFinished\n        archive?: string\n        fileSource?: string // set when serving a file\n        fileStats?: Stat // file attributes\n\n## Other files\n\nTogether with the main file (plugin.js), you can have other files, both for data and javascript to include with `require('./other-file')`.\nNotice that in this case you don't use `api.require` but classic `require` because it's in your plugin folder.\n\nThese files have a special meaning:\n\n- `public` folder, and its files will be accessible at `/~/plugins/PLUGIN_NAME/FILENAME`\n- `custom.html` file, that works exactly like the main `custom.html`. Even when same section is specified\n  by 2 (or more) files, both contents are appended.\n\n## Storage\n\nPlugins that need to store generated data persistently should put all the files in the \"storage\" folder that is\nautomatically created for each plugin. In your plugin you can get this path by reading `api.storageDir`.\n\nThere is a very powerful way to store data, that is by using `api.openDb`. This will automatically create the file\ninside the storage folder. For further details please refer to the dedicated documentation.\n\n## Dependencies\n\nYou run vanilla javascript here, in the backend and/or in the browser, so the tools you have for dependencies\nare the ones provided by node.js and/or the browser.\nIf you use a library for the browser, you'll have to keep it in the \"public\" folder, as the browser must be able to load it.\nIf you want to use a module for node.js, just include \"node_modules\" folder (not in \"public\" folder).\nYou can decide if you want to use some building system/transpiler, but you'll have to set it up yourself.\n\n## Publish your plug-in\n\nSuggested method for publishing is to have a dedicated repository on GitHub, with topic `hfs-plugin`.\nTo set the topic go on the repo home and click on the gear icon near the \"About\" box.\nBe sure to also fill the \"description\" field, especially with words that people may search for.\n\nThe files intended to be installed must go in a folder named `dist`.\nYou can keep other files outside.\n\nHint: if you go in your .hfs/plugins folder on linux and mac, and enter \n\n    ln -s /PATH_TO_YOUR_REPO/dist MY_PLUGIN_NAME\n\nYou'll install your repo so that you can edit the sources and see effects in real-time. \nThis allows you to continue editing your repo and be ready to commit changes.\n\nIf you have platform-dependent files, you can put those files in `dist-PLATFORM` or `dist-PLATFORM-ARCHITECTURE`.\nFor example, if you want some files to be installed only on Windows with Intel CPUs, put them in `dist-win32-x64`.\n\nPossible values for platform are `aix`, `darwin`, `freebsd`, `linux`, `openbsd`, `sunos`, `win32`.\n\nPossible values for CPUs are `arm`, `arm64`, `ia32`, `mips`, `mipsel`, `ppc`, `ppc64`, `s390`, `s390x`, `x64`.\n\nYou can refer to these published plugins for reference, like\n- https://github.com/rejetto/simple-player/\n- https://github.com/rejetto/theme-example/\n\nPublished plugins are required to specify the `apiRequired` property.\n\n### Multiple versions\n\nIt is possible to publish different versions of the plugin to be compatible with different versions of HFS.\nTo do that, just have your other versions in branches with name starting with `api`.\nHFS will scan through them in inverted alphabetical order searching for a compatible one.\n\n## React developers\n\nMost React developers are used to JSX, which is not (currently) supported here.\nIf you want, you can try solutions to JSX support, like transpiling.\nAnyway, React is not JSX, and can be easily used without.\n\nAny time in JSX you do\n```jsx\n<button onClick={() => console.log('hi')}>Say hi</button>\n```\n\nThis is just translated to\n```js\nh('button', { onClick: () => console.log('hi') }, 'Say hi')\n```\n\nWhere `h` is just `import { createElement as h } from 'react'`.\n\n## Internationalization (i18n)\n\nTo make your plugin multi-language you can use `t` function in javascript, like this: `t('myPlugin_greeting', \"Hello!\")`.\n\nIn frontend you get `t` from `HFS`, like this `const { t } = HFS`, while in backend you need to do \n`const { t } = await api.i18n(ctx)` inside an `async init` ([see example](https://github.com/rejetto/download-quota/blob/main/dist/plugin.js)).\nWhen possible, we suggest to do translation in the frontend. \n\nNow that your code is ready, to translate in some language you'll add files like `hfs-lang-XX.json` to your plugin (same folder as plugin.js),\nwhere XX is the language code. The system is basically the same used to translate the rest of HFS,\nand you can [read details here](https://github.com/rejetto/hfs/wiki/Translation).\n\nIn the previous example `myPlugin_greeting` is the name of the translation, while `Hello!` is the default text.\nInstead of `myPlugin` use some text that you feel unique and no one else will use, to be sure that the same name\nis not used by another plugin, or even HFS in the future. We suggest to use your plugin's name in camelCase. \n\nIf you need to pass variables in the text, introduce a third parameter in the middle.\nEg: `HFS.t('myPlugin_filter_count', {n:filteredVariable}, \"{n} filtered\")`\n\n### Language customization\n\nOne can change a specific text by overriding existing translation. Example: you want to change the text for \"Options\" to \"Settings\".\nIf you want to override for a specific language, for example english with language-code `en`:\n\n```js\nHFS._.set(HFS.lang, 'en.translate.Options', 'Settings')\n```\n\nThis works because all translations are stored inside `HFS.lang`.\nUsing `HFS._.set` is not necessary, but in this case is convenient, because the language-code key may not exist.\n\nIf you want to override a text regardless of the language, use the special language-code `all`.\n\n## API version history\n\n - 10.3 (v0.55.0)\n    - HFS.copyTextToClipboard\n    - HFS.urlParams\n    - exports.beforePlugin + afterPlugin\n    - config.type: color\n    - config.showIf\n    - init can now return directly the unload function\n    - api.i18n\n    - frontend event: newListEntries\n    - HFS.fileShowComponents\n    - api.ctxBelongsTo\n    - api.getCurrentUsername\n- 9.6 (v0.54.0)\n    - frontend event: showPlay\n    - api.addBlock \n    - api.misc\n    - frontend event: paste\n    - exports.customRest + HFS.customRestCall\n    - config.type: vfs_path\n    - frontend event: sortCompare\n    - HFS.userBelongsTo\n    - HFS.DirEntry\n    - frontend event: appendMenuBar\n    - config.helperText: basic md formatting\n    - HFS.onEvent.setOrder\n    - backend event: newSocket\n- 8.891 (v0.53.0)\n    - api.openDb\n    - frontend event: menuZip\n    - config.type:username\n    - api.events class has changed\n    - frontend event \"fileMenu\": changed props format\n    - api.getConfig() without parameters\n    - api.notifyClient + HFS.getNotifications\n    - HFS.html\n    - HFS.useSnapState\n    - HFS.debounceAsync\n    - HFS.loadScript\n    - HFS.iconBtn\n    - middleware: ctx.stop()\n      - the old way of returning true is now deprecated\n    - exports.customHtml\n    - more functions in HFS.misc\n    - frontend event 'entry' can now ask to skip an entry\n    - backend events: login attemptingLogin failedLogin\n- 8.72 (v0.52.0)\n    - HFS.toast\n    - HFS.misc functions\n    - HFS.state.uri\n    - ~~frontend event: uriChanged~~\n- 8.65 (v0.51.0)\n    - plugin's own hfs-lang files\n    - HFS.state.props.can_overwrite\n    - ctx.state.considerAsGui\n    - frontend event: userPanelAfterInfo\n    - breaking: moved custom properties from ctx to ctx.state\n    - HFS.navigate\n    - internationalization\n- 8.5 (v0.49.0)\n    - frontend event: entry\n    - exports.onDirEntry: entry.icon\n    - customApiCall supports any number of parameters\n- 8.4 (v0.48.2)\n    - HFS.fileShow\n    - api.Const (api.const is now deprecated)\n- 8.3 (v0.47.0)\n    - HFS.useBatch\n    - FileMenuEntry.id, .subLabel\n- 8.23 (v0.46.0)\n    - entry.getNext, getPrevious, getNextFiltered, getPreviousFiltered, getDefaultIcon\n    - platform-dependent distribution\n    - HFS.watchState, emit, useApi\n    - api.storageDir, customApiCall\n    - exports.depend\n    - frontend event: fileShow\n- 8.1 (v0.45.0) should have been 0.44.0 but forgot to update number\n    - full URL support for frontend_js and frontend_css\n    - custom.html\n    - entry.cantOpen, ext, isFolder\n    - HFS.apiCall, reloadList, logout, h, React, state, t, _, dialogLib, Icon, getPluginPublic\n    - second parameter of onEvent is now deprecated\n    - renamed: additionalEntryProps > additionalEntryDetails & entry-props > entry-details\n    - frontend event: entryIcon\n- 8 (v0.43.0)\n    - entry.name & .uri\n    - tools.dialogLib\n    - HFS.getPluginConfig()\n- 7 (v0.42.0)\n    - frontend event: fileMenu\n    - HFS.SPECIAL_URI, PLUGINS_PUB_URI, FRONTEND_URI,\n- 6 (v0.38.0)\n    - config.frontend\n- 5 (v0.33.0)\n    - frontend event: afterEntryName\n- 4.1 (v0.23.4)\n    - config.type:array added $width, $column and fixed height\n- 4 (v0.23.0)\n    - config.type:real_path\n    - api.subscribeConfig\n    - api.setConfig\n    - api.getHfsConfig\n- 3 (v0.21.0)\n    - config.defaultValue\n    - async for init/unload\n    - api.log\n- 2\n    - config.type:array\n"

Launch `npm run build-all` in the root\n\nAt this stage you have a javascript output. For binary files you'll also have to `npm run dist-bin`.\n\nYou could instead run *dist* to run both *build-all* & *dist-bin*.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- If you get error \"Rollup failed to resolve import \"@mui/icons-material/...\"\n  - edit `admin/src/vite.config.ts` and remove the `vitePluginImport` part\n\n# Dev environment\n\n0. `npm install`\n1. `npm run watch-server-proxied` and leave it running. It will serve server stuff plus will proxy frontend and admin files.\n2. `npm run start-frontend` and leave it running. It will serve on port 3005.\n3. `npm run start-admin` and leave it running. It will serve on port 3006\n\nIf you don't want this proxying version, you can use `npm run watch-server` but after both frontend and admin have\nbeen built, so their files are available in `dist` folder.\n\n# Tests\n\nTo run tests\n- `npm run build-all`\n- `npm run server-for-test` and leave it running.\n- `npm test`\n\nAlternatively you can run a development server, just be sure to load config from `tests` folder.\n\n# File organization\n\nThe project is roughly divided in Server + Frontend + Admin, where Frontend is a web interface intended to access\nshared files, while Admin is the web interface for configuration/administration.  \nServer lies in the root of the project, with its \"src\" folder, while Frontend and Admin are inside folders \"frontend\"\nand \"admin\" respectively, with their \"src\" folder within. \n\nAdditionally, you have the following folders:\n- mui-grid-form: a lib used by Admin to easily build forms  \n- plugins: a collection of plugins that are pre-installed \n- shared: code shared between Frontend and Admin\n- tests: automated tests with related resources\n\n# Known problems\n- vite's proxying server (but also CRA's) doesn't play nicely with SSE, leaving sockets open\n\n# Guidelines\n\n- For strings, I'm using double-quotes for text that's read by the user, and single-quotes elsewhere. Backticks can be any. \n- All objects that go in yaml should use snake_case.\n  - Reason: we want something that is both easy for the user and maps directly in our code.\n    Spaces and kebab-case don't play well with javascript and camel is less readable for the user.\n- API names should start with get_ if and only if they provide information without making changes.\n- All parameters that contain a *uri* should have a name that starts with `uri`.\n- React parts don't use JSX. I used JSX for a couple of years before deciding that it is not good enough to pay the\n  price of using an extra language that is also necessary to switched in and out multiple times when stuff is nested.  \n\n# Project design\n\n- At the moment the admin-panel was designed to be completely separated from the \"user\" frontend \n  to keep the latter smaller and to allow alternative frontends creation without having to deal with\n  the complexity of the admin-panel.\n\n  Of course this comes with a price to pay on the programmer's side, more work to do.\n"
