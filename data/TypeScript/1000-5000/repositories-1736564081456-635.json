          "content": "# Architecture\n\nDataStation has three modes: browser, desktop, and server. Browser\npanel eval happens in-browser. Desktop and server panel eval happen on\nthe desktop or server. Each panel's eval has logic that decides\nwhether to evaluate the panel in-memory or to pass over RPC to the\nbackend (the desktop or server process).\n\nDesktop RPC happens through Node's builtin RPC and Server RPC happens\nover HTTP. RPC logic from the UI is defined in ui/asyncRPC.ts and also\ndesktop/preload.ts (for some Electron RPC helpers on desktop only).\n\nThe results of panel evals are kept only on disk. Only metadata\n(preview, shape, size, etc.) from panel evals are returned in RPC.\n\n## ./desktop\n\nThis directory contains the Electron app and code that runs RPC\ncalls. It loads the entire UI bundle and responds to RPC requests from\nit.\n\n### ./desktop/project.ts\n\nAll state in the desktop app is stored in JSON files on disk at the\nmoment. The result of panel evals is stored on disk.\n\nIt might be ideal to store state in a database (especially for the\nserver use case) but that complicates the install for all supported\nlanguages that would then depend not just on a JSON library but also\non a database library. Still, this may be the right way to go at the\nsame time as making language setup easier by providing a button or\nsomething to install all missing dependencies.\n\n### ./desktop/panel\n\nEvaluation happens by spawning a runner (see ./runner below)\nsubprocess where all the eval handlers are actually run. This allows\neasy resource cleanup and easy \"kill\" panel eval support.\n\n## ./runner\n\n./runner/eval.go is the main eval entrypoint but the command line\nentrypoint is at ./runner/cmd/main.go.\n\n## ./server\n\nThis directory contains the server (Express) app and code that proxies\nRPC calls over HTTP to \"desktop\" implementations. Really, the code is\njust located in the ./desktop/panel/ directory but it is run in/by the\nserver process at the moment.\n\nAll state in the server app is stored in PostgreSQL. The result of\npanel evals is still stored on disk however. So it isn't currently\npossible to run more than one instance of the server without something\nlike sticky sessions.\n\n## ./ui\n\nThis contains the in-browser UI that makes RPC calls to handle project\nstate and panel evals.\n\n### ./ui/asyncRPC.ts\n\nThis contains the code the client uses to make RPC calls to either the\ndesktop process or the server process.\n\n### ./ui/panels\n\nThis is where all logic for each panel is contained. If you wanted to\nadd a new panel type, you could copy an existing panel and register it\nin ./ui/panels/index.ts. You would also need to declare it in\n./shared/state.ts.\n\n### ./ui/connectors\n\nThis is where all data connectors are defined. If you wanted to add a\nnew connector, you could copy an existing connector and register it in\n./ui/connectors/index.ts. You would also need to declare it in\n./shared/state.ts.\n\n## ./shared\n\nThis contains helper utilities used all over the place.\n\n### ./shared/state.ts\n\nThis is where types for all entities in state are described. Any time\nyou want to add a new panel or connector, etc. you'll need to add it\nhere.\n\nIf the change needs to be read by the runner you'll also need to add\nthe change to ./runner/state.go. There is nothing at the moment\nkeeping these two files in sync other than tests that may exist.\n\n### ./shared/languages\n\nThis is where all supported languages are defined and where their\nlibraries for interacting with DataStation are defined.\n\nThe reason it's shared is because Python and JavaScript run in the\nbrowser in browser mode but on a machine in desktop/server mode.\n\nLanguage wrappers are defined in Jsonnet so that they can include\ncomments and newlines. That is translated to JSON and embedded in Go\nwith `yarn build-language-definitions`. The CI will complain if these\ndefinitions ever go out of date but it may be confusing locally not to\nsee your changes until you run this and recompile the Go runner.\n"

Remove\nall the `await`s (even if that would be incorrect) and it will lead\nyou closer to the real problem. Even then it probably won't be\naccurate. It doesn't seem to handle syntax errors pretty terribly in\ngeneral.\n\nShould move to something that is not ts-jest eventually.\n\n## Run a single JavaScript test-local file\n\nPass the test-local file name to `yarn test`.\n\n```bash\nyarn test-local server/exporter.test.js\n```\n\n## Run tests on only a single runner type\n\nAll (or should be all) tests on panels run both against a Node version\nand a Go version. To quickly filter on only a specific runner, you can\npass `--dsrunner=X` where X is `memory` or `go` or `node` and only\ntests against that runner will be run.\n\nFor example:\n\n```bash\nyarn test-local desktop/panel/file.test.js --dsrunner=memory\n```\n\n## Adding/editing language libraries\n\nLanguage libraries (i.e. the implementation of\nDM_getPanel/DM_setPanel) are in shared/libraries/*.jsonnet. They are\nin jsonnet so that you can have nicely formatted code. They get\ncompiled to JSON and committed. They also get embedded into Go code.\n\nTo re-run this process, use on Mac or Linux:\n\n```\n$ yarn build-language-definitions\n```\n\n## Tests blow up with SIGABRT on macos when -race is on\n\nSee https://github.com/golang/go/issues/49138. Set `MallocNanoZone=0`\nbefore running tests to get around this.\n\nOr upgrade to a more recent minor version.\n"

Install [tdm-gcc](https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/) on\nWindows (yes, you need this not MSVC because some Go packages [require\ngcc](https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3/issues/684)) or XCode on\nmacOS. On Linux install gcc or clang.\n\nYou'll need Go 1.18 or newer.\n\nIf you want to have hot-reloading, install\n[fswatch](https://github.com/emcrisostomo/fswatch).\n\n## Principles\n\n* Keep things simple and don't abstract early\n* Node packages bring in tons of dependencies. So be very careful before adding new depencies and don't bring in small dependencies or dependencies that can be easily written and fully unit-tested.\n* Keep adding unit tests and bumping\n\n## Build and run the online environment\n\nThis will start a web server for the in-browser application.
