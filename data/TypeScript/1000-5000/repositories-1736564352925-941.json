Check out the [migration guides](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/tree/main/doc/migrations) for any changes you need to make.\n\n### Project status\n\nThis project has been used in production for years in Ethereum, IPFS, and more.  It is actively maintained by multiple organizations and continues to be improved!  The API might change, but we strictly follow semver.\n\nThe documentation in the main branch may contain changes from a pre-release.\n\nIf you are looking for the documentation of the latest release, you can view the latest release on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/libp2p), or select the tag in github that matches the version you are looking for.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Just tring to figure out what this is all about? Check our [GETTING\\_STARTED.md](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/blob/main/doc/GETTING_STARTED.md) guide and [examples](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-examples).\n\n## Background\n\nlibp2p is the product of a long and arduous quest to understand the evolution of the Internet networking stack. In order to build P2P applications, devs have long had to make custom ad-hoc solutions to fit their needs, sometimes making some hard assumptions about their runtimes and the state of the network at the time of their development. Today, looking back more than 20 years, we see a clear pattern in the types of mechanisms built around the Internet Protocol, IP, which can be found throughout many layers of the OSI layer system, libp2p distils these mechanisms into flat categories and defines clear interfaces that once exposed, enable other protocols and applications to use and swap them, enabling upgradability and adaptability for the runtime, without breaking the API.\n\nWe are in the process of writing better documentation, blog posts, tutorials and a formal specification. Today you can find:\n\n- [libp2p.io](https://libp2p.io)\n- [docs.libp2p.io](https://docs.libp2p.io)\n- [Specification (WIP)](https://github.com/libp2p/specs)\n- [Discussion Forums](https://discuss.libp2p.io)\n- Talks\n  - [`libp2p <3 ethereum` at DEVCON2](https://archive.devcon.org/archive/watch/2/libp2p-devp2p-ipfs-and-ethereum-networking/)\n- Articles\n  - [The overview of libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/libp2p#description)\n\nTo sum up, libp2p is a \"network stack\" -- a protocol suite -- that cleanly separates concerns, and enables sophisticated applications to only use the protocols they absolutely need, without giving up interoperability and upgradeability. libp2p grew out of IPFS, but it is built so that lots of people can use it, for lots of different projects.\n\n## Roadmap\n\nThe js-libp2p roadmap can be found here: <https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/blob/main/ROADMAP.md>\n\nIt represents current projects the js-libp2p maintainers are focused on and provides an estimation of completion targets.\n\n## Install\n\n```sh\nnpm install libp2p\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Configuration\n\nFor all the information on how you can configure libp2p see [CONFIGURATION.md](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/blob/main/doc/CONFIGURATION.md).\n\n### Limits\n\nFor help configuring your node to resist malicious network peers, see [LIMITS.md](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/blob/main/doc/LIMITS.md)\n\n### Getting started\n\nIf you are starting your journey with `js-libp2p`, read the

          "content": "# üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap 2024-H2/2025-H1\n\nThis roadmap document contains the themes upon which maintainer effort will be concentrated on in 2024/25.\n\n## üëî Productionization\n\njs-libp2p is deployed in many production environments so to take adoption to the next level we want to really double down on helping these users get the best out of their deployments.\n\n### js-libp2p amino DHT bootstrapper\n\nDeploying a public bootstrapper is a great test of the capacity of js-libp2p since it will need to maintain several thousand simultaneous connections and service many DHT RPC requests.  Comprehensive metrics and logging will also give us insight into real world usage patterns that can further direct performance optimisations.\n\n  - Deploy a bootstrap server that acts as an entry point to the network for DHT clients\n  - Ship it in the default config of majority libp2p/IPFS implementations\n  - Publish a dashboard showing usage statistics\n\n### Metrics\n\nHaving a view on the internal workings of a js-libp2p node is essential to debugging implementation problems as well as user misconfigurations.\n\n  - Add the missing metrics types, e.g. Histograms, Summaries, etc\n  - Implement metrics consistently across transports\n\n### DevTools\n\nThe [js-libp2p-devtools](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-devtools) plugin is an invaluable resource for debugging a running libp2p node running [@libp2p/devtools-metrics](https://npmjs.com/package/@libp2p/devtools-metrics).\n\n  - Finish UX improvements\n  - Publish to browser extension stores\n  - Add DHT capability detection\n  - Publish as standalone electron app to connect to Node.js/electron/react-native processes using `@libp2p/devtools-metrics`\n\n### Tuning and reduction of resource usage\n\nJavaScript is a poor choice of language in which to perform computationally expensive operations. Conveniently the ones we need to do (hashing, signing, verification) are largely implemented in native modules or as part of web browser APIs.\n\n  - Profile and benchmark CPU usage\n  - Use this to drive further optimizations in resource usage\n\n## üìö Documentation & developer onboarding\n\n- Documentation refresh - ensure all guides are up to date and follow current best practices\n- Revamp getting started guides\n  - Focus on use cases\n    - Browser vs Node.js\n    - Public server vs behind NAT\n- Create additional self-directed learning in the style of [@libp2p/protocol-adventure](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@libp2p/protocol-adventure)\n  - @libp2p/services-adventure\n  - @libp2p/dht-adventure\n  - @libp2p/pubsub-adventure\n  - @libp2p/peer-discovery-adventure\n- Link the adventure modules into a syllabus\n- Publish browser based versions using protoschool or https://tutorialkit.dev/\n\n## üåê Browser connectivity\n\nBrowsers remain the single most challenging environment in which to deploy truly decentralized applications and most of the issues are related to the poor connectivity options presented to browsers by the rest of the network.\n\n### Listen on Secure WebSockets with libp2p.direct\n\nIP Shipyard have recently acquired the ability to create wildcard ACME certificates under the `libp2p.direct` domain.  This feature is being enabled in https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/pull/10521\n\nJS should implement a similar extension to the `@libp2p/websocket` transport to allow config-free SSL encryption.\n\n### WebSocket single encryption\n\nWhen a browser connects to a WebSocket listener they can only connect over TLS.  We then apply noise encryption as well which means everything is encrypted twice which is inefficient.\n\nWe should be able to use the noise handshake mechanism to ensure the remote has the private key corresponding to it's public key, then use the browser's TLS implementation to prevent eavesdropping.\n\nThe specification is [in progress](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/pull/625) the milestone is to ship a POC.\n\n## Node.js connectivity\n\n### QUIC in Node.js\n\nThere's a decent chance the Node.js QUIC implementation is [not going to be exposed to userland](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/52628#issuecomment-2143475066), but we need this to have compatibility with other libp2p implementations.\n\nhttps://github.com/ChainSafe/js-libp2p-quic is in-progress to add QUIC support via a native module that uses the Rust implementation.\n\n### WebTransport in Node.js\n\nA [long-lived PR](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/pull/2422) is open that adds WebTransport support via the [@fails-components/webtransport](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fails-components/webtransport) module, however it's blocked on [spec incompatibilities](https://github.com/fails-components/webtransport/issues/213).\n\nWe can either resolve these incompatibilities, implement WebTransport on top of https://github.com/ChainSafe/js-libp2p-quic, or perhaps Node.js will finally ship [HTTP3 support](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/38478) and WebTransport, whichever is most expedient.\n\n### WebRTC Direct in Node.js\n\nAnother [long-lived PR](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/pull/2583) adds support for a [WebRTC Direct](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/webrtc/webrtc-direct.md) listener to Node.js.\n\nIt's currently blocked on a number of PRs that require the input of upstream maintainers (see linked issues in [#2583](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/pull/2583)). We will continue to encourage the maintainers of these libraries to give feedback and ultimately merge those PRs but we may need to publish forks in the interim.\n"
