To configure:\n\n  - To enable remult across all sveltekit route\n    ```ts\n    // src/hooks.server.ts\n    import { api } from './server/api'\n    export const handle = api\n    ```\n  - To Use remult in ssr `PageLoad` - this will leverage the `event`'s fetch to load data on the server without reloading it on the frontend, and abiding to all api rules even when it runs on the server\n\n    ```ts\n    // src/routes/+page.ts\n    import { remult } from 'remult'\n    import type { PageLoad } from './$types'\n\n    export const load = (async (event) => {\n      // Instruct remult to use the special svelte fetch to fetch data on server side page load\n      remult.useFetch(event.fetch)\n      return repo(Task).find()\n    }) satisfies PageLoad\n    ```\n\n## [0.27.21] 2024-10-28\n\n- **Added `upsert` method:**  \n  The `upsert` method allows inserting or updating an entity in a single operation. If an entity matching the `where` condition is found, it is updated; otherwise, a new entity is created. This can be used for a single entity or for batch operations with an array of options.\n\n  Example:\n\n  ```ts\n  // Single entity upsert\n  await taskRepo.upsert({\n    where: { title: 'task a' },\n    set: { completed: true },\n  })\n\n  // Batch upsert\n  await taskRepo.upsert([\n    { where: { title: 'task a' }, set: { completed: true } },\n    { where: { title: 'task b' }, set: { completed: true } },\n  ])\n  ```\n\n- Now you can get data and aggregate info with a single request using the `query` method:\n\n  ```ts\n  const result = await repo\n    .query({\n      where: { completed: false },\n      pageSize: 50,\n      aggregates: {\n        sum: ['salary'],\n        average: ['age'],\n      },\n    })\n    .paginator()\n  // Accessing the items from the first page\n  console.table(result.items)\n  // Accessing the aggregation results\n  console.log(result.aggregates.salary.sum) // Total salary sum\n  ```\n\n- Added `TestApiDataProvider` to use in unit tests that test api rules. see [tutorial](https://learn.remult.dev/in-depth/9-testing/2-testing-api-rules)\n- Fixed that values that are not included will not exist in the resulting object (previously they existed with value undefined)\n- Fixed that relations that were not included, will not be enumerable in the resulting object (previously they were only set to undefined)\n- Fixed `serverExpression` to run whenever we're not using a `proxy` data provider (for example RestDataProvider)\n- Fixed issue with `updateMany` where the `set` had `ValueListType` or relation.\n- Fixed issue when updating relation id and relation in the same update, the last one will win\n- Fixed makeTitle to handle all caps text\n- Added experimental api for sqlRelations & sqlRelationsFilter - see [Sql Relations](https://learn.remult.dev/in-depth/6-sql-expression/3-sql-relations)\n\n## [0.27.20] 2024-10-16\n\n- **Added Origin IndexedDb Storage** to store entities in the frontend:\n\n  ```ts\n  const db = new JsonDataProvider(new JsonEntityIndexedDbStorage())\n  console.table(await repo(Task, db).find())\n  ```\n\n- Fixed issue with required validation and relations\n\n## [0.27.19] 2024-09-26\n\n- Fixed issue with stackblitz async_hook replacer\n\n## [0.27.18] 2024-09-24\n\n- Added `remult.initUser` that initializes the frontend remult with the user based on the backend\n- Fixed issue with dual call to initRequest in some cases\n\n## [0.27.16] 2024-09-21\n\n- Added support for `customFilter` defined in base classes\n\n## [0.27.14] 2024-09-20\n\n- A few tweaks by @jycouet in https://github.com/remult/remult/pull/515\n- migrate to remult kit by @Yedidyar in https://github.com/remult/remult/pull/519\n\n## [0.27.13] 2024-09-16\n\n- fixed issue with null first and group by\n- fixed an error where from json returned a row that didn't have an id and could cause problems\n- fixed double init request in cases where `withRemult` accidentally wraps remult server\n\n## [0.27.12] 2024-09-05\n\n- added `$not` to value comparison: `{where:{id:{ $not:1 }}}}` for improved readability\n- removed `group` option from `aggregate`\n- Added unique id validations to all databases\n- Verified that all databases add missing columns on `ensureSchema`\n- Removed the deprecated behavior where if no entities array was sent to remult server, all entities were served\n- Removed the deprecated web sql data provider, since no browsers support it - us the OpfsEntityDataProvider instead\n- Changed id signature in EntityOptions to also allow `id:'code'` & `id:['company','code']` for compound id columns\n- Fix to remult admin\n\n## [0.27.11] 2024-09-04\n\n- **Potential breaking change** change the http status code of exceptions thrown in backend method from 500 to 400\n\n## [0.27.10] 2024-09-03\n\n- Fix for minor typing issue regarding field | null | undefined\n\n## [0.27.9] 2024-09-02\n\n- Fix for minor issue in knex\n\n## [0.27.8] 2024-09-02\n\n- More great improvements to remult admin by [jycouet](https://github.com/jycouet)\n- Added `groupBy` & `aggregate` to `Repository`\n  ```ts\n  repo(Employee).groupBy({\n    group: ['country', 'city'],\n    sum: ['salary'],\n    where: {\n      salary: {\n        $gt: 2000,\n      },\n    },\n  })\n  ```\n  [Checkout this example video](https://youtu.be/D5lDaulNDC4)\n\n## [0.27.6] 2024-08-28\n\n- Improvement to remult admin + support for bearer token in admin\n- Fix to recursive sql expression\n- Added support for backend method without a transaction using `transactional:false`\n- Fixed live query, to update the subscribers asynchronously\n\n## [0.27.5] 2024-08-23\n\n- [#474](https://github.com/remult/remult/issues/474) When using knex, an id column with auto-increment that is not named id in the db gave an error\n\n## [0.27.3] 2024-08-14\n\n- Changed RelationOptions to be an extendable interface and not a type\n\n## [0.27.2] 2024-08-07\n\n- Added `request` to `remult.context` that'll be available through the request lifecycle - to access it please extend the RemultContext type as follows\n  ```ts\n  import type express from 'express'\n  declare module 'remult' {\n    export interface RemultContext {\n      request?: express.Request\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n## [0.27.0] 2024-08-01\n\n### API BREAKING CHANGE - Improved Typescript typing\n\nTypescript version 5.4 included many changes that cause unknown & any to behave differently breaking existing code for some project.\n\nIn this version we reviewed the external api and made sure that it matches TS 5.4 while still supporting older version of TS (4.6)\n\nTheses change are likely to cause build errors in existing projects, but in most cases these errors represent potential bugs that should be addressed.\nHere's the list of significant changes:\n\n- `findFirst`, `findOne` and `findId` can return `undefined` when the row is not found, if you're sure that the row exists, add a `!` after it, for example:\n  ```ts\n  let p = await repo(Person).findId(7) // p will be Person | undefined in the new version\n  let q = (await repo(Person).findId(7))! // p will be Person\n  ```\n- Decorators that use entity, now require to define the entity in the generic definition.\n  Previously you could have the following code:\n  ```ts\n  @Fields.string({\n    validate: task => task.title.length > 2\n  })\n  title=''\n  ```\n  Now, that code will return an error that `title` is not a member of `unknown`. To fix that add the `Entity` generic definition:\n  ```ts\n  @Fields.string<Task>({\n    validate: task => task.title.length > 2\n    title = ''\n  })\n  ```\n- `FieldMetadata.key` was changed from `string` to `keyof entityType` making it easier to traverse the object.\n- `error` in `EntityRef`, `FieldRef` and `ControllerRef` can be `undefined` when there is no error\n- Change `= any` to `= unknown` in most generic definitions\n\n## [0.26.23] 2024-07-30\n\n- Fixes and improvements to the admin panel\n\n## [0.26.22] 2024-07-19\n\n- fixed issue with prevent default and insert\n\n## [0.26.21] 2024-07-11\n\n- Fixed a bug with startsWith and endsWith worked like contains\n\n## [0.26.20] 2024-07-10\n\n- Added support for $not, $startsWith & $endsWith\n\n## [0.26.19] 2024-07-08\n\n- Fixed issue with recursive sqlExpression call for field\n\n## [0.26.18] 2024-07-07\n\n- Fixed an issue with sqlExpression without aliases - now remult automatically adds an alias in select, but not in order by or where.\n\n## [0.26.17] 2024-07-06\n\n- Added support for DuckDB\n\n## [0.26.16] 2024-07-04\n\n- Many improvements to `remult-admin`\n- HUGE thanks to [jycouet](https://github.com/jycouet) & [celikovic](https://github.com/celikovic) for their amazing work on `remult-admin`\n\n## [0.26.15] 2024-06-28\n\n- docs - svelte tuto improvement by @jycouet in #458\n- Fix #460\n\n## [0.26.14] 2024-06-18\n\n- Fixed typescript error with KnexDataProvider\n- fixed issue where migrate didn't work in commonjs\n- Bump mysql2 from 3.9.7 to 3.9.8 by @dependabot in #445\n- fix auth.ts import for Next.js tutorial by @LegitPanda in #446\n- Update example-apps.md by @ikx94 in #447\n- Bump @azure/msal-node and tedious by @dependabot in #450\n- Bump braces from 3.0.2 to 3.0.3 by @dependabot in #449\n- Bump braces from 3.0.2 to 3.0.3 in /examples/angular-todo-fastify by @dependabot in #451\n- docs: improve swagger-ui integration guide page with nextjs specific info by @kckusal in #448\n\n### New Contributors\n\n- @LegitPanda made their first contribution in #446\n- @ikx94 made their first contribution in #447\n- @kckusal made their first contribution in #448\n\n## [0.26.13] 2024-05-22\n\n- fix validators with args type-check error in ts 5.4\n\n## [0.26.12] 2024-05-16\n\n- Fixed an issue with stack overflow when calling `withRemult` from within `getUser` - relevant to next auth - `session` hook\n- The \"static\" `withRemult` will now use the dataProvider provided in the remultServer options by default\n- The \"static\" `withRemult` now supports promise of data provider etc...\n- Changed json storage to save json in a non formatted way (condensed), and added a `formatted` option to control it.

2023-07-30\n\n- Fixed [#216](https://github.com/remult/remult/issues/216) wrong date type saved on update\n\n## [0.22.1] - 2023-07-25\n\n- Fixed issue [#215](https://github.com/remult/remult/issues/215) support for mongo without transactions\n\n## [0.22.0] - 2023-07-16\n\n- Added `ToJson` and `FromJson` methods the the `Repository` object. These are extremely useful in the context of SSR (next etc...) where you need to send plain json over the wire, but still want to have dates and other cool stuff in your app\n- Fixed an issue with the many-to-one relation where the 'many' table did not store the ID as an 'integer' in cases where the 'one' table's ID column was an integer\n- Fixed issue where using displayValue or validate on a spread object, marked it as new, and always triggered a post call\n- Added Remult.run\n- isBackend will return true or false based on dataProvider.isProxy equal false or runningOnServer member\n- Backend method will call backend based on isBackend method,\n- Replaced deprecated cuid with `paralleldrive/cuid2`\n- Fixed an issue where when `getDb` was called without a `remult` parameter, it wouldn't use the default remult\n- Fixed liveQuery's apply changes to also support state that it's initial value is undefined.\n- Typescript 5 style decorators are now supported in development, but to deploy you still need `experimentalDecorators` .\n  - Also, the decorators now do type checking, so if you put @Fields.string() on a number, it'll give you an error\n  - And - no longer need for the Generics in the decorators setting.\n    - `@Entity<Task>(...)` is now `@Entity(...)`\n    - `@Fields.string<Task>(...)` is now `@Fields.string(...)`\n  - Why didn't we implement typescript 5 decorators in runtime? the implementation for that is not yet fully supported with tools such as esbuild etc... so implementing it is trying to hit a moving target.\n    At this time we recommend using `experimentalDecorator:false` for development, to get the typing, but `experimentalDecorator:true` for deploying and functionality.\n- Added 404 on missing route for next app router - issue #211\n- Fixed an issue where live query would not unsubscribe automatically to a query that failed to fetch.\n- Fixed an issue where, when using the cache with findId or findFirst, and requesting to load fields, if the cache contained a row without those fields, it would return the cached row without those fields.\n- Fixed an issue where in a filter that contained multiple instances of the same custom filter, with an 'and' condition did not work correctly\n- Graphql Mutations now display validation errors in the graphql way\n\n## [0.21.1] - 2023-06-25\n\n- Fixed issue with `Field.Json` fails to insert in case of array\n\n## [0.21.0] - 2023-06-22\n\n- Major improvements to the GraphQL support:\n  - Better Query support\n  - Mutation Support\n  - Improved compatibility to standard GraphQL structures\n  - **Breaking Change** Note that the GraphQL Schema has changed, and client code needs to be adjusted. If you run into any issues, please open a github issue or reach out to us on discord.\n- Improved SQL Log to Console see [PR #204](https://github.com/remult/remult/pull/204),\n\n### Big Thanks\n\n- to [jycouet](https://github.com/jycouet) for his first two pull requests, and his help forming the GraphQL Schema according to best practices.\n- to [talmosko](https://github.com/talmosko) for his help and improvements for the tutorials and documentation.\n\n## [0.20.6] - 2023-06-19\n\n- Fixed an issue when apiPrefilter was an arrow function, it did not affect get of a specific resource\n\n## [0.20.5] - 2023-06-11\n\n- fixed issue #200 transactions on mongo db\n\n## [0.20.4] - 2023-06-05\n\n- fixed issue with columns in postgres with casing in the db - sa `createdAt`\n- Issue #196 fixed - load options in live query\n- Fixed issue with `apiReadAllowed:false` when `apiUpdateAllowed` is set to undefined\n\n## [0.20.3] - 2023-05-23\n\n- Improved Open API Support\n\n## [0.20.2] - 2023-05-22\n\n- createdAt & updatedAt are by default `allowApiUpdate` false\n- Added `apiPrefix` to `BackendMethod` `options` to allow more control over backend method routes. #189\n\n## [0.20.1] - 2023-05-17\n\n- Improved support for compound id entity\n- Minor bug fixes\n- Improved memory usage\n\n## [0.20.0] - 2023-05-08\n\n- Added `handle` method for using remult in `next.js` api handlers. see [using remult in a next.js api handler](https://remult.dev/tutorials/react-next/appendix-1-get-server-side-props.html#using-remult-in-a-next-js-api-handler)\n- Added `remult-sveltekit` see [Add remult to your project](https://remult.dev/docs/add-remult-to-your-app.html#sveltekit)\n- Added support for `next.js` App Router. See [Add remult to your project](https://remult.dev/docs/add-remult-to-your-app.html#next-js-app-router)\n\n## [0.19.0] - 2023-03-26\n\n- `Repository`\n  - Added a `validate` method that returns an `ErrorInfo` object if invalid.\n  - Added a `fields` member that can be used to access the metadata of specific fields, for example:\n    ```ts\n    repo.fields.title.caption\n    //or\n    repo.fields.title.inputType\n    ```\n  - The `insert`, `validate`, `create`, `save` and `update` value will now run `fromJson` and `toJson` for field values that do not match their type - for consistent behavior with the `api`\n- `FieldMetadata`\n  - Added `apiUpdateAllowed` to query if `update` is allowed for this field\n  - Added `includedInApi` to query of this field would be returned from the backend as part of the api\n  - Added `displayValue` that can be used to achieve a consistent way a field is displayed.\n  - Added `toInput` and `fromInput` methods that'll help with translating values from and to inputs.\n- `getId` method added to `IdMetadata` to enable extracting the id from immutable objects, this is mainly useful for entities where the `id` column is not called `id` :)\n  ```ts\n  repo.metadata.idMetadata.getId(task)\n  ```\n-\n\n### Breaking Changes\n\n- In `EntityMetadata` the `apiUpdateAllowed`, `apiDeleteAllowed` and `apiInsertAllowed` that previously were boolean fields, are now methods that accepts item and return true or false. This is useful for cases where the apiAllowed rules refer to the specific values of an entity.\n  ```ts\n  // Previously\n  if (repo.metadata.apiDeleteAllowed) {\n  }\n  // Now\n  if (repo.metadata.apiDeleteAllowed(task)) {\n  }\n  ```\n- The `validate` method in `EntityRef` and `ControllerRef` that previously returned true if valid, now returns `undefined` if valid and `ErrorInfo` if invalid\n- `FieldMetadata`'s `ValueConverter` field's members are now mandatory and no longer optional - it's expected that they'll be implemented\n"

[Try our interactive online tutorial](https://learn.remult.dev/).**\n\nRemult promotes a **consistent query syntax for both frontend and Backend code**:\n\n```ts\n// Frontend - GET: /api/products?_limit=10&unitPrice.gt=5,_sort=name\n// Backend  - 'select name, unitPrice from products where unitPrice > 5 order by name limit 10'\nawait repo(Product).find({\n  limit: 10,\n  orderBy: {\n    name: 'asc',\n  },\n  where: {\n    unitPrice: { $gt: 5 },\n  },\n})\n\n// Frontend - PUT: '/api/products/product7' (body: { \"unitPrice\" : 7 })\n// Backend  - 'update products set unitPrice = 7 where id = product7'\nawait repo(Product).update('product7', { unitPrice: 7 })\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Define schema in code\n\n```ts\n// shared/product.ts\n\nimport { Entity, Fields } from 'remult'\n\n@Entity('products', {\n  allowApiCrud: true,\n})\nexport class Product {\n  @Fields.cuid()\n  id = ''\n\n  @Fields.string()\n  name = ''\n\n  @Fields.number()\n  unitPrice = 0\n}\n```\n\n👉 **Don't like decorators?** we have full support for [Working without decorators](https://remult.dev/docs/working-without-decorators)\n\n### Add backend API with a [single line of code](https://remult.dev/docs/quickstart#server-side-initialization)\n\n_Example:_\n\n```ts\n// backend/index.ts\n\nimport express from 'express'\nimport { remultExpress } from 'remult/remult-express' // adapters for: Fastify,Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit, SolidStart, Nest, more...\nimport { createPostgresDataProvider } from 'remult/postgres' // supported: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB, MSSQL and Oracle\nimport { Product } from '../shared/product'\n\nconst app = express()\n\napp.use(\n  remultExpress({\n    entities: [Product],\n    dataProvider: createPostgresDataProvider({\n      connectionString: 'postgres://user:password@host:5432/database\"',\n    }),\n  }),\n)\n\napp.listen()\n```\n\nRemult adds route handlers for a fully functional REST API and realtime live-query endpoints, optionally including an [Open API](https://remult.dev/docs/adding-swagger) spec and a [GraphQL](https://remult.dev/docs/adding-graphql) endpoint\n\n### Fetch data with type-safe frontend code\n\n```ts\nconst [products, setProducts] = useState<Product[]>([])\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n  repo(Product)\n    .find({\n      limit: 10,\n      orderBy: {\n        name: 'asc',\n      },\n      where: {\n        unitPrice: { $gt: 5 },\n      },\n    })\n    .then(setProducts)\n}, [])\n```\n\n### :mega: Realtime Live Queries\n\n```ts\nuseEffect(() => {\n  return repo(Product)\n    .liveQuery({\n      limit: 10,\n      orderBy: {\n        name: 'asc',\n      },\n      where: {\n        unitPrice: { $gt: 5 },\n      },\n    })\n    .subscribe((info) => {\n      setProducts(info.applyChanges)\n    })\n}, [])\n```\n\n### :ballot_box_with_check: Data validation and constraints - defined once\n\n```ts\nimport { Entity, Fields, Validators } from 'remult'\n\n@Entity('products', {\n  allowApiCrud: true,\n})\nexport class Product {\n  @Fields.cuid()\n  id = ''\n\n  @Fields.string({\n    validate: Validators.required,\n  })\n  name = ''\n\n  @Fields.number<Product>({\n    validate: (product) => product.unitPrice > 0 || 'must be greater than 0',\n  })\n  unitPrice = 0\n}\n```\n\n#### Enforced in frontend:\n\n```ts\ntry {\n  await repo(Product).insert({ name: '', unitPrice: -1 })\n} catch (e: any) {\n  console.error(e)\n  /* Detailed error object ->\n{\n  \"modelState\": {\n    \"name\": \"Should not be empty\",\n    \"unitPrice\": \"must be greater than 0\"\n  },\n  \"message\": \"Name: Should not be empty\"\n}\n*/\n}\n```\n\n#### Enforced in backend:\n\n```ts\n// POST '/api/products' BODY: { \"name\":\"\", \"unitPrice\":-1 }\n// Response: status 400, body:\n{\n  \"modelState\": {\n    \"name\": \"Should not be empty\",\n    \"unitPrice\": \"must be greater than 0\"\n  },\n  \"message\": \"Name: Should not be empty\"\n}\n```\n\n### :lock: Secure the API with fine-grained authorization\n\n```ts\n@Entity<Article>('Articles', {\n  allowApiRead: true,\n  allowApiInsert: Allow.authenticated,\n  allowApiUpdate: (article) => article.author == remult.user.id,\n  apiPrefilter: () => {\n    if (remult.isAllowed('admin')) return {}\n    return {\n      author: remult.user.id,\n    }\n  },\n})\nexport class Article {\n  @Fields.string({ allowApiUpdate: false })\n  slug = ''\n\n  @Fields.string({ allowApiUpdate: false })\n  authorId = remult.user!.id\n\n  @Fields.string()\n  content = ''\n}\n```\n\n### :rocket: Relations\n\n```ts\nawait repo(Categories).find({\n  orderBy: {\n    name: 'asc ',\n  },\n  include: {\n    products: {\n      where: {\n        unitPrice: { $gt: 5 },\n      },\n    },\n  },\n})\n\n// Entity Definitions\nexport class Product {\n  //...\n  @Relations.toOne(Category)\n  category?: Category\n}\nexport class Category {\n  //...\n  @Relations.toMany<Category, Product>(() => Product, `category`)\n  products?: Product[]\n}\n```\n\n### Automatic admin UI\n\n![Automatic admin UI](static/images/admin-ui.gif)\n\n## What about complex CRUD?\n\nWhile simple CRUD shouldn’t require any backend coding, using Remult means\nhaving the ability to handle any complex scenario by controlling the backend in\nnumerous ways:\n\n- Backend computed (read-only) fields - from simple\n  [expressions](https://remult.dev/docs/ref_field.html#serverexpression) to\n  complex data lookups or even direct db access (SQL)\n- Custom side-effects with\n  [entity lifecycle hooks](https://remult.dev/docs/ref_entity.html#saving)\n  (before/after saving/deleting)\n- Backend only updatable fields (e.g. “last updated at”)\n- [Relations](https://remult.dev/docs/entity-relations.html)\n- Roll-your-own type-safe endpoints with\n  [Backend Methods](https://remult.dev/docs/backendMethods.html)\n- Roll-your-own low-level endpoints (Express, Fastify, koa, others…)\n\n## Installation\n\nThe _remult_ package is one and the same for both the frontend bundle and the\nbackend. Install it once for a monolith project or per-repo in a monorepo.\n\n```sh\nnpm i remult\n```\n\n## Tutorials\n\nThe best way to learn Remult is by following a tutorial of a simple Todo web app\nwith a Node.js Express backend.\n\n- [Tutorial with React](https://remult.dev/tutorials/react/)\n- [Tutorial with Angular](https://remult.dev/tutorials/angular/)\n- [Tutorial with Vue](https://remult.dev/tutorials/vue/)\n- [Tutorial with Next.js](https://remult.dev/tutorials/react-next/)\n- [Tutorial with Sveltekit](https://remult.dev/tutorials/sveltekit/)\n- [Tutorial with SolidStart](https://remult.dev/tutorials/solid-start/)\n\n## Demo\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEoScmSVNUE\" target=\"_blank\">\n  <p align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"https://github.com/remult/remult/raw/main/static/images/video-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Video thumbnail\"  />\n  </p>\n</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEoScmSVNUE\" target=\"_blank\">\n  <p align=\"center\">Watch code demo on YouTube here (14 mins)</p>\n</a>\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe [documentation](https://remult.dev/docs) covers the main features of Remult.\nHowever, it is still a work-in-progress.\n\n## Example Apps\n\n- Fullstack TodoMVC example with React and Express.\n  ([Source code](https://github.com/remult/TodoMVC-eample) |\n  [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/remult/TodoMVC-example?file=/src/frontend/App.tsx))\n\n- [CRM demo](https://github.com/remult/crm-demo) with a React +\n  [MUI](https://mui.com) front-end and Postgres database.\n\n### Status\n\nRemult is **production-ready** and, in fact, used in production apps since 2018.\nHowever, we’re keeping the major version at zero so we can use community\nfeedback to finalize the v1 API.\n\n## Motivation\n\nFull-stack web development is (still) too complicated. **Simple CRUD, a common\nrequirement of any business application, should be simple to build, maintain,\nand extend** when the need arises.\n\nRemult abstracts away repetitive, boilerplate, error-prone, and poorly designed\ncode on the one hand, and enables total flexibility and control on the other.\n**Remult helps building fullstack apps using only TypeScript code you can easily\nfollow and safely refactor**, and fits nicely into any existing or new project\nby being minimalistic and completely unopinionated regarding the developer’s\nchoice of other frameworks and tools.\n\nOther frameworks tend to fall into either too much abstraction (no-code,\nlow-code, BaaS) or partial abstraction (MVC frameworks, GraphQL, ORMs, API\ngenerators, code generators), and tend to be opinionated regarding the\ndevelopment tool-chain, deployment environment, configuration/conventions or\nDSL. Remult attempts to strike a better balance.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n- :speech_balloon: Any feedback or suggestions?
