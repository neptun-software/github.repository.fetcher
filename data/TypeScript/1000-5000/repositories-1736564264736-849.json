          "content": "## Configure AWS Credentials for GitHub Actions\nConfigure your AWS credentials and region environment variables for use in other\nGitHub Actions.\n\nThis action implements the AWS JavaScript SDK credential resolution chain\nand exports session environment variables for your other Actions to use.\nEnvironment variable exports are detected by both the AWS SDKs and the AWS CLI\nfor AWS API calls.\n\n## Overview\nAPI calls to AWS need to be signed with credential information, so when you use\none of the AWS SDKs or an AWS tool, you must provide it with AWS credentials and\nand AWS region. One way to do that in GitHub Actions is to use a repository\nsecret with IAM credentials, but this doesn't follow [AWS security\nguidelines](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/security-creds.html)\non using long term credentials. Instead, we recommend that you use a long term\ncredential or JWT to fetch a temporary credential, and use that with your tools\ninstead. This GitHub Action facilitates just that.\n\nAWS SDKs and Tools look for your credentials in standardized environment\nvariables. In essence, this Action runs through the standard [credential\nresolution flow](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/standardized-credentials.html),\nand at the end, exports environment variables for you to use later.\n\nWe support five methods for fetching credentials from AWS, but we recommend that\nyou use GitHub's OIDC provider in conjunction with a configured AWS IAM\nIdentity Provider endpoint.\n\nFor more information on how to do that, read on.\n\n### Note about GHES\n\nSome of this documentation may be inaccurate if you are using GHES (GitHub\nEnterprise Server), please take note to review the GitHub documentation when\nrelevant.\n\nFor example, the URL that the OIDC JWT is issued from is different than the\nusual `token.actions.githubusercontent.com`, and will be unique to your\nenterprise server. As a result, you will need to configure this differently when\nyou create the Identity Provider.\n\nWe do not presently have a GHES testing environment to validate this action. If\nyou are running in GHES and encounter problems, please\n[let us know](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials/issues/new/choose).\n\n## Security recommendations\n\nWe recommend following\n[Amazon IAM best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html)\nfor the AWS credentials used in GitHub Actions workflows, including:\n  * Do not store credentials in your repository's code.\n  * [Grant least privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege)\n  to the credentials used in GitHub Actions workflows. Grant only the\n  permissions required to perform the actions in your GitHub Actions workflows.\n  Do not assume overly permissive roles, even for testing.\n  * [Monitor the activity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#keep-a-log)\n  of the credentials used in GitHub Actions workflows.\n  * Use temporary credentials when possible.\n  * Periodically rotate any long-term credentials you use.\n\n## Using this action\nThere are five different supported ways to retrieve credentials:\n\n- Using GitHub's OIDC provider (`AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`)\n- Proceeding as an IAM user (No STS call is made)\n- Using access keys as action input (`AssumeRole`)\n- Using a WebIdentity Token File (`AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity`)\n- Using existing credentials in your runner (`AssumeRole`)\n\nBecause we use the AWS JavaScript SDK, we always will use the [credential\nresolution flow for Node.js](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/setting-credentials-node.html).\nDepending on your inputs, the action might override parts of this flow.\n\nWe recommend using the first option above: [GitHub's OIDC provider](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/configuring-openid-connect-in-amazon-web-services).\nThis method uses OIDC to get short-lived credentials needed for your actions.\nSee [OIDC](#OIDC) for more information on how to setup your AWS account to\nassume a role with OIDC. \n\nThe following table describes which method we'll use to get your credentials\nbased on which values are supplied to the Action:\n\n| **Identity Used**                                               | `aws-access-key-id` | `role-to-assume` | `web-identity-token-file` | `role-chaining` | `id-token` permission\n| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------- | - | - |\n| [✅ Recommended] Assume Role directly using GitHub OIDC provider |                     | ✔                |                           | | ✔ |\n| IAM User                                                        | ✔                   |                  |                           | | |\n| Assume Role using IAM User credentials                          | ✔                   | ✔                |                           | | |\n| Assume Role using WebIdentity Token File credentials            |                     | ✔                | ✔                         | | |\n| Assume Role using existing credentials | | ✔ | | ✔ | |\n\n*Note: `role-chaining` is not always necessary to use existing credentials.\nIf you're getting a \"Credentials loaded by the SDK do not match\" error,\ntry enabling this option.*\n\n### Options\nSee [action.yml](./action.yml) for more detail.\n\n|          Option           |                                            Description                                            | Required |\n|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| aws-region                | Which AWS region to use                                                                           |    Yes   |\n| role-to-assume            | Role for which to fetch credentials.

This option will retry fetching credentials until the secret access key does not contain special characters. This option overrides disable-retry and retry-max-attempts. | No |\n\n#### Credential Lifetime\nThe default session duration is **1 hour**.\n\nIf you would like to adjust this you can pass a duration to\n`role-duration-seconds`, but the duration cannot exceed the maximum that was\ndefined when the IAM Role was created.\n\n#### External ID\nIf your role requires an external ID to assume, you can provide the external ID\nwith the `role-external-id` input\n\n#### Session tagging and name\nThe default session name is \"GitHubActions\", and you can modify it by specifying\nthe desired name in `role-session-name`. The session will be tagged with the\nfollowing tags: (Refer to [GitHub's documentation for `GITHUB_` environment\nvariable definitions](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/using-environment-variables#default-environment-variables))\n\n| Key        | Value             |\n| ---------- | ----------------- |\n| GitHub     | \"Actions\"         |\n| Repository | GITHUB_REPOSITORY |\n| Workflow   | GITHUB_WORKFLOW   |\n| Action     | GITHUB_ACTION     |\n| Actor      | GITHUB_ACTOR      |\n| Branch     | GITHUB_REF        |\n| Commit     | GITHUB_SHA        |\n\n_Note: all tag values must conform to\n[the tag requirements](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_Tag.html).\nParticularly, `GITHUB_WORKFLOW` will be truncated if it's too long. If\n`GITHUB_ACTOR` or `GITHUB_WORKFLOW` contain invalid characters, the characters\nwill be replaced with an '*'._\n\nThe action will use session tagging by default during role assumption, unless\nyou follow our recommendation and are assuming a role with a WebIdentity. For\nWebIdentity role assumption, the session tags have to be included in the encoded\nWebIdentity token. This means that tags can only be supplied by the OIDC\nprovider, and they cannot set during the AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity API call\nwithin the Action. See [#419](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials/issues/419)\nfor more information.\n\nYou can skip this session tagging by providing\n`role-skip-session-tagging` as true in the action's inputs:\n```yaml\n      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4\n      with:\n        role-skip-session-tagging: true\n```\n\n### Session policies\nSession policies are not required, but they allow you to limit the scope of the\nfetched credentials without making changes to IAM roles. You can specify inline\nsession policies right in your workflow file, or refer to an existing managed\nsession policy by its ARN.\n\n#### Inline session policies\nAn IAM policy in stringified JSON format that you want to use as an inline\nsession policy. Depending on preferences, the JSON could be written on a single\nline like this:\n```yaml\n      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4\n      with:\n         inline-session-policy: '{\"Version\":\"2012-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Sid\":\"Stmt1\",\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Action\":\"s3:List*\",\"Resource\":\"*\"}]}'\n```\nOr we can have a nicely formatted JSON as well:\n```yaml\n      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4\n      with:\n         inline-session-policy: >-\n          {\n           \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n           \"Statement\": [\n            {\n             \"Sid\":\"Stmt1\",\n             \"Effect\":\"Allow\",\n             \"Action\":\"s3:List*\",\n             \"Resource\":\"*\"\n            }\n           ]\n          }\n```\n\n#### Managed session policies\nThe Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the IAM managed policies that you want to\nuse as managed session policies. The policies must exist in the same account as\nthe role. You can pass a single managed policy like this:\n```yaml\n      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4\n      with:\n         managed-session-policies: arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess\n```\nAnd we can pass multiple managed policies likes this:\n```yaml\n      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4\n      with:\n         managed-session-policies: |\n          arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess\n          arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3OutpostsReadOnlyAccess\n```\n\n### Misc\n\n#### Adjust the retry mechanism\nYou can now configure retry settings for when the STS call fails. By default, we\nretry with exponential backoff `12` times. You can disable this behavior\naltogether by setting the `disable-retry` input to `true`, or you can configure\nthe number of times it retries with the `retry-max-attempts` input.\n\n#### Mask account ID\nYour account ID is not masked by default in workflow logs since it's not\nconsidered sensitive information. However, you can set the `mask-aws-account-id`\ninput to `true` to mask your account ID in workflow logs if desired.\n\n#### Unset current credentials\nSometimes, existing credentials in your runner can get in the way of the\nintended outcome. You can set the `unset-current-credentials` input to `true` to\nwork around this issue.\n\n#### Special characters in AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\nSome edge cases are unable to properly parse an `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` if it\ncontains special characters. For more information, please see the\n[AWS CLI documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-troubleshooting.html#tshoot-signature-does-not-match).\nIf you set the `special-characters-workaround` option, this action will\ncontinually retry fetching credentials until we get one that does not have\nspecial characters. This option overrides the `disable-retry` and\n`retry-max-attempts` options. We recommend that you do not enable this option\nunless required, because retrying APIs infinitely until they succeed is not best\npractice.\n\n## OIDC\n\nWe recommend using [GitHub's OIDC\nprovider](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/configuring-openid-connect-in-amazon-web-services)\nto get short-lived AWS credentials needed for your actions. When using OIDC, you\nconfigure IAM to accept JWTs from GitHub's OIDC endpoint. This action will\nthen create a JWT unique to the workflow run using the OIDC endpoint, and it\nwill use the JWT to assume the specified role with short-term credentials. \n\nTo get this to work\n1. Configure your workflow to use the `id-token: write` permission.\n2. Configure your audience, if required.\n3. In your AWS account, configure IAM to trust GitHub's OIDC identity provider.\n4. Configure an IAM role with appropriate claim limits and permission scope.\n\n   *Note*: Naming your role \"GitHubActions\" has been reported to not work. See\n   [#953](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials/issues/953).\n\n5. Specify that role's ARN when setting up this action.\n\nFirst, in order for this action to create the JWT, your workflow file must have\nthe `id-token: write` permission:\n\n```yaml\n    permissions:\n      id-token: write\n      contents: read\n```\n\n### OIDC Audience\n\nWhen the JWT is created, an audience needs to be specified. Normally, you would\nuse `sts.amazonaws.com`, and this action uses this by default if you don't\nspecify one. This will work for most cases. Changing the default audience may\nbe necessary when using non-default AWS partitions, such as China regions.\nYou can specify the audience through the `audience` input:\n\n```yaml\n    - name: Configure AWS Credentials for China region audience\n      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4\n      with:\n        audience: sts.amazonaws.com.cn\n        aws-region: us-east-3\n        role-to-assume: arn:aws-cn:iam::123456789100:role/my-github-actions-role\n```\n\n### Configuring IAM to trust GitHub\nTo use GitHub's OIDC provider, you must first set up federation\nwith the provider as an IAM IdP. The GitHub OIDC provider only needs to be\ncreated once per account (i.e. multiple IAM Roles that can be assumed by the\nGitHub's OIDC can share a single OIDC Provider). Here is a sample CloudFormation\ntemplate that will configure this trust for you.\n\nNote that the thumbprint below has been set to all F's because the thumbprint is\nnot used when authenticating `token.actions.githubusercontent.com`. This is a\nspecial case used *only when GitHub's OIDC is authenticating to IAM*. IAM uses\nits library of trusted CAs to authenticate. The value is still the API, so it\nmust be specified.\n\nYou can copy the template below, or load it from here: \nhttps://d38mtn6aq9zhn6.cloudfront.net/configure-aws-credentials-latest.yml\n\n```yaml\nParameters:\n  GitHubOrg:\n    Description: Name of GitHub organization/user (case sensitive)\n    Type: String\n  RepositoryName:\n    Description: Name of GitHub repository (case sensitive)\n    Type: String\n  OIDCProviderArn:\n    Description: Arn for the GitHub OIDC Provider.\n    Default: \"\"\n    Type: String\n  OIDCAudience:\n    Description: Audience supplied to configure-aws-credentials.\n    Default: \"sts.amazonaws.com\"\n    Type: String\n\nConditions:\n  CreateOIDCProvider: !Equals \n    - !Ref OIDCProviderArn\n    - \"\"\n\nResources:\n  Role:\n    Type: AWS::IAM::Role\n    Properties:\n      AssumeRolePolicyDocument:\n        Statement:\n          - Effect: Allow\n            Action: sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity\n            Principal:\n              Federated: !If \n                - CreateOIDCProvider\n                - !Ref GithubOidc\n                - !Ref OIDCProviderArn\n            Condition:\n              StringEquals:\n                token.actions.githubusercontent.com:aud: !Ref OIDCAudience\n              StringLike:\n                token.actions.githubusercontent.com:sub: !Sub repo:${GitHubOrg}/${RepositoryName}:*\n\n  GithubOidc:\n    Type: AWS::IAM::OIDCProvider\n    Condition: CreateOIDCProvider\n    Properties:\n      Url: https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com\n      ClientIdList: \n        - sts.amazonaws.com\n      ThumbprintList:\n        - ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff\n\nOutputs:\n  Role:\n    Value: !GetAtt Role.Arn \n```\n\n### Claims and scoping permissions\nTo align with the Amazon IAM best practice of [granting least\nprivilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege),\nthe assume role policy document should contain a\n[`Condition`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition.html)\nthat specifies a subject (`sub`) allowed to assume the role. [GitHub also\nrecommends](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect#defining-trust-conditions-on-cloud-roles-using-oidc-claims)\nfiltering for the correct audience (`aud`). See [AWS IAM\ndocumentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_iam-condition-keys.html#condition-keys-wif)\non which claims you can filter for in your trust policies.\n\nWithout a subject (`sub`) condition, any GitHub user or repository could\npotentially assume the role. The subject can be scoped to a GitHub organization\nand repository as shown in the CloudFormation template. However, scoping it down\nto your org and repo may cause the role assumption to fail in some cases. See\n[Example subject claims](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect#example-subject-claims)\nfor specific details on what the subject value will be depending on your\nworkflow. You can also [customize your subject claim](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect#customizing-the-token-claims)\nif you want full control over the information you can filter for in your trust\npolicy. If you aren't sure what your subject (`sub`) key is, you can add the\n[`actions-oidc-debugger`](https://github.com/github/actions-oidc-debugger)\naction to your workflow to see the value of the subject (`sub`) key, as well as\nother claims.\n\nAdditional claim conditions can be added for higher specificity as explained in\nthe [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect).\nDue to implementation details, not every OIDC claim is presently supported by\nIAM.\n\n### Further information about OIDC\n\nFor further information on OIDC and GitHub Actions, please see:\n\n* [AWS docs: Creating OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity providers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc.html)\n* [AWS docs: IAM JSON policy elements: Condition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition.html)\n* [GitHub docs: About security hardening with OpenID Connect](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect)\n* [GitHub docs: Configuring OpenID Connect in Amazon Web Services](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/configuring-openid-connect-in-amazon-web-services)\n* [GitHub changelog: GitHub Actions: Secure cloud deployments with OpenID Connect](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-10-27-github-actions-secure-cloud-deployments-with-openid-connect/)\n\n## Self-Hosted Runners\n\nIf you run your GitHub Actions in a\n[self-hosted runner](https://help.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners) that already has access to AWS credentials, such as\nan EC2 instance, then you do not need to provide IAM user access key credentials\nto this action. We will use the standard AWS JavaScript SDK credential\nresolution methods to find your credentials, so if the AWS JS SDK can\nauthenticate on your runner, this Action will as well.\n\nIf no access key credentials are given in the action inputs, this action will\nuse credentials from the runner environment using the\n[default methods for the AWS SDK for Javascript](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/setting-credentials-node.html).\n\nYou can use this action to simply configure the region and account ID in the\nenvironment, and then use the runner's credentials for all AWS API calls made by\nyour Actions workflow:\n```yaml\nuses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4\nwith:\n  aws-region: us-east-2\n```\nIn this case, your runner's credentials must have permissions to call any AWS\nAPIs called by your Actions workflow.\n\nOr, you can use this action to assume a role, and then use the role credentials\nfor all AWS API calls made by your Actions workflow:\n```yaml\nuses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4\nwith:\n  aws-region: us-east-2\n  role-to-assume: my-github-actions-role\n```\nIn this case, your runner's credentials must have permissions to assume the\nrole.\n\nYou can also assume a role using a web identity token file, such as if using\n[Amazon EKS IRSA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts-technical-overview.html). Pods running in EKS\nworker nodes that do not run as root can use this file to assume a role with a\nweb identity.\n\n### Proxy Configuration\n\nIf need use a HTTP proxy you can set it in the action manually.\n\nAdditionally this action will always consider the `HTTP_PROXY` environment\nvariable.\n\nManually configured proxy:\n```yaml\nuses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4\nwith:\n  aws-region: us-east-2\n  role-to-assume: my-github-actions-role\n  http-proxy: \"http://companydomain.com:3128\"\n```\n\nProxy configured in the environment variable:\n```bash\n# Your environment configuration\nHTTP_PROXY=\"http://companydomain.com:3128\"\n```\n\n### Use with the AWS CLI\nThis workflow does _not_ install the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)\ninto your environment. Self-hosted runners that intend to run this action prior\nto executing `aws` commands need to have the AWS CLI\n[installed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)\nif it's not already present. \nMost [GitHub hosted runner environments](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments)\nshould include the AWS CLI by default.\n\n## Examples\n\n### AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity (recommended)\n```yaml\n    - name: Configure AWS Credentials\n      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4\n      with:\n        aws-region: us-east-2\n        role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::123456789100:role/my-github-actions-role\n        role-session-name: MySessionName\n```\nIn this example, the Action will load the OIDC token from the GitHub-provided\nenvironment variable and use it to assume the role\n`arn:aws:iam::123456789100:role/my-github-actions-role` with the session name\n`MySessionName`.\n\n### AssumeRole with role previously assumed by action in same workflow\n```yaml\n    - name: Configure AWS Credentials\n      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4\n      with:\n        aws-region: us-east-2\n        role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::123456789100:role/my-github-actions-role\n        role-session-name: MySessionName\n    - name: Configure other AWS Credentials\n      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4\n      with:\n        aws-region: us-east-2\n        role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::987654321000:role/my-second-role\n        role-session-name: MySessionName\n        role-chaining: true\n```\nIn this two-step example, the first step will use OIDC to assume the role\n`arn:aws:iam::123456789100:role/my-github-actions-role` just as in the prior\nexample. Following that, a second step will use this role to assume a different\nrole, `arn:aws:iam::987654321000:role/my-second-role`.\n\n### AssumeRole with static IAM credentials in repository secrets\n```yaml\n    - name: Configure AWS Credentials\n      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4\n      with:\n        aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}\n        aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}\n        aws-region: us-east-2\n        role-to-assume: ${{ secrets.AWS_ROLE_TO_ASSUME }}\n        role-external-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ROLE_EXTERNAL_ID }}\n        role-duration-seconds: 1200\n        role-session-name: MySessionName\n```\nIn this example, the secret `AWS_ROLE_TO_ASSUME` contains a string like\n`arn:aws:iam::123456789100:role/my-github-actions-role`.  To assume a role in\nthe same account as the static credentials, you can simply specify the role\nname, like `role-to-assume: my-github-actions-role`.\n\n### Retrieving credentials from step output, AssumeRole with temporary credentials\n```yaml\n    - name: Configure AWS Credentials 1\n      id: creds\n      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4\n      with:\n        aws-region: us-east-2\n        role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::123456789100:role/my-github-actions-role\n        output-credentials: true\n    - name: get caller identity 1\n      run: |\n        aws sts get-caller-identity\n    - name: Configure AWS Credentials 2\n      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4\n      with:\n        aws-region: us-east-2\n        aws-access-key-id: ${{ steps.creds.outputs.aws-access-key-id }}\n        aws-secret-access-key: ${{ steps.creds.outputs.aws-secret-access-key }}\n        aws-session-token: ${{ steps.creds.outputs.aws-session-token }}\n        role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::123456789100:role/my-other-github-actions-role\n    - name: get caller identity2\n      run: |\n        aws sts get-caller-identity\n```\nThis example shows that you can reference the fetched credentials as outputs if\n`output-credentials` is set to true. This example also shows that you can use\nthe `aws-session-token` input in a situation where session tokens are fetched\nand passed to this action.\n \n## License Summary\nThis code is made available under the MIT license.\n\n## Security Disclosures\nIf you would like to report a potential security issue in this project, please\ndo not create a GitHub issue.
