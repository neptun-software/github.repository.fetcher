          "content": "## vNEXT (Not yet published)\n\n## 2.15.2\n\n### All packages\n\n- Fix `useLayoutEffect` warnings when using React versions lower than 18.3.0 and\n  SSR.\n\n### `@liveblocks/react`\n\n- Fix memory leak in some hooks.\n- Fix bug where querying metadata with `useThreads()` would not always reuse the\n  cache correctly.\n\n## 2.15.1\n\n### All packages\n\n- Fix rollup config to always ensure `\"use client\"` directives are on top of\n  files after build.\n\n## 2.15.0\n\n### `@liveblocks/react`\n\n- **Breaking**: Drop support for React 17 (and 16). If you’re unable to upgrade\n  React to 18 or higher, you can still continue to use Liveblocks 2.14.0, which\n  is the last version to support React <18.\n\n### All packages\n\n- The published target for all Liveblocks packages is now ES2022 (up from\n  ES2020). This should have a positive impact on your bundle size[\\*].\n\n- Various internal refactorings and code cleanup.\n\n[\\*] If you bundle for the browser, this should not be a problem, as all major\nbrowsers support ES2022. If however you're specifically targeting very old\nbrowsers (mostly IE), then you may need to configure your bundler (Webpack,\nrollup, esbuild, etc) to also down-compile code from dependencies inside\n`node_modules` for you, if you aren't already.\n\n## 2.14.0\n\n### `@liveblocks/emails`\n\n- Add new functions `prepareTextMentionNotificationEmailAsHtml` and\n  `prepareTextMentionNotificationEmailAsReact` to support text mention\n  notification event for Lexical and Tiptap text editors and prepare data into\n  email-ready formats.\n\n## 2.13.2\n\n### `@liveblocks/react-lexical`\n\n- Fix report text editor function's call. Now we wait for the room's status to\n  be `connected` to report the text editor instead of reporting directly after\n  room creation / loading.\n\n### `@liveblocks/react-tiptap`\n\n- Fix report text editor function's call. Now we wait for the room's status to\n  be `connected` to report the text editor instead of reporting directly after\n  room creation / loading.\n\n## 2.13.1\n\n### `@liveblocks/react-ui`\n\n- Improve the spacing consequences of `--lb-line-height` (introduced in 2.13.0)\n  in some contexts.\n\n## 2.13.0\n\n### `@liveblocks/react-ui`\n\n- Add a formatting toolbar to `Composer` which appears when selecting text. It’s\n  enabled by default in the default components and can also be custom built with\n  new primitives (`Composer.FloatingToolbar` and `Composer.MarkToggle`) and new\n  APIs (`const { marks, toggleMark } = useComposer()`).\n- Add new `--lb-line-height` token to control the line height of main elements\n  (e.g. comment bodies in comments and composers).\n- Remove `Timestamp` export mistakenly added to `@liveblocks/react-ui`, it\n  should be imported from `@liveblocks/react-ui/primitives` instead.\n\n## 2.12.2\n\n### `@liveblocks/react-tiptap`\n\n- Add new options for `useLiveblocksExtension()` to allow setting\n  initialContent, experimental offline support, and the field name\n- Update floating composer to support onComposerSubmit handler and closing the\n  composer with the escape key\n\n### `@liveblocks/zustand`\n\n- Add support for Zustand v5\n\n## 2.12.1\n\n### `@liveblocks/react-ui`\n\n- Prevent unsupported attachment previews from loading infinitely.\n- Refactored `Thread` and `Comment` component to be used outside of the\n  `RoomProvider` component.\n\n## 2.12.0\n\nThis release adds support for tracking synchronization status of pending local\nchanges for any part of Liveblocks. Whether you use Storage, Text Editors,\nThreads, or Notifications.\n\nIf the client’s sync status is `synchronized`, it means all local pending\nchanges have been persisted by our servers. If there are pending local changes\nin any part of Liveblocks you’re using, then the client’s sync status will be\n`synchronizing`.\n\nAlso, we’re introducing a way to prevent browser tabs from being closed while\nlocal changes are not yet synchronized. To opt-in to this protection, enable\n`preventUnsavedChanges` option on the client:\n\n- In React: `<LiveblocksProvider preventUnsavedChanges />`\n- Otherwise: `createClient({ preventUnsavedChanges: true })`\n\n### `@liveblocks/client`\n\n- Add new API\n  [`client.getSyncStatus()`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#Client.getSyncStatus)\n  method.\n- Add new\n  [client config option](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#createClient):\n  `preventUnsavedChanges`.\n- Expose `ToImmutable<T>` helper type.\n\n### `@liveblocks/react`\n\n- Add new hook\n  [`useSyncStatus`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useSyncStatus)\n  that can be used to tell whether Liveblocks is synchronizing local changes to\n  the server. Useful to display a \"Saving...\" spinner in your application, when\n  used with `useSyncStatus({ smooth: true })`.\n- Deprecated APIs:\n  - `useStorageStatus` is now deprecated in favor of `useSyncStatus`.\n\n### `@liveblocks/react-ui`\n\n- Take composers into account when the new `preventUnsavedChanges` option is\n  set.\n\n### `@liveblocks/react-lexical`\n\n- Add new hook `useIsEditorReady` which can be used to show a skeleton UI before\n  the editor has received the initial text from the server.\n- Deprecated APIs:\n  - `useEditorStatus` is now deprecated in favor of `useIsEditorReady` (or\n    `useSyncStatus`).\n\n## 2.11.1\n\n### `@liveblocks/react-lexical`\n\n- Fix an issue with `AnchoredThreads` component not working correctly on certain\n  React versions.\n\n### `@liveblocks/react-tiptap`\n\n- Fix an issue with `AnchoredThreads` component not working correctly on certain\n  React versions.\n- Fix an issue where React components don’t update when\n  `shouldRerenderOnTransaction: false` is set.\n\n### `@liveblocks/yjs`\n\n- Adds experimental offline support for `LiveblocksYjsProvider`.\n\n## 2.11.0\n\n### `@liveblocks/react-ui`\n\n- Upgrade dependencies.\n- Fix minor appearance issues related to attachments.\n- Fix pasting issues introduced in 2.10.0.\n\n### `@liveblocks/react`\n\n- Fix regression with `useThreads` that caused the hook to return an error if\n  its associated room did not exist.\n\n### `@liveblocks/react-tiptap`\n\n- Initial release.\n\n### `@liveblocks/emails`\n\n- Initial release.\n\n## 2.10.2\n\n### `@liveblocks/client`\n\n- Internal refactorings and code cleanup across various parts of the client's\n  inner workings.\n\n### `@liveblocks/react`\n\n- Implement automatic retry for initial load of inbox notifications, user\n  threads, room threads, room versions, or room notification settings—except\n  when encountering a 4xx error.\n- Background tabs will no longer poll threads, notification, room versions or\n  room notification settings.\n- Fix incorrect suspense export for `useRoomNotificationSettings` hook.\n- Support for React 19 and Next.js 15.\n\n### `@liveblocks/react-ui`\n\n- Support for React 19 and Next.js 15.\n\n### `@liveblocks/react-lexical`\n\n- Support for React 19 and Next.js 15.\n\n## 2.10.0\n\n### `@liveblocks/client`\n\n- Add new methods under `client.resolvers.*` to invalidate the cache of\n  `resolveUsers`, `resolveRoomsInfo`, and `resolveMentionSuggestions`.\n- In storage update notifications (using\n  `room.subscribe(root, ..., { isDeep: true })`), all LiveList deletion updates\n  will now also include the item that was deleted (#2008)\n\n### `@liveblocks/react-ui`\n\n- Improve and fix pasting rich text into the composer.\n- Improve mention suggestions click behavior.\n\n## 2.9.2\n\n### `@liveblocks/node`\n\n- Detect invalid chars in secret keys and throw a more helpful error message\n\n## 2.9.1\n\n### `@liveblocks/client`\n\n- Fix type definition of `ThreadData`: `updatedAt` is always set\n- Fix bug where client wasn't always using the newest delta update backend\n  endpoint yet\n- Fix regression with metadata filtering on explicitly-`undefined` values\n\n### `@liveblocks/react-ui`\n\n- When `Composer` is disabled, its actions are now also disabled as expected.\n- Various event propagation improvements in `Composer`.\n\n## 2.9.0\n\nWe are introducing pagination support to allow apps using threads and inbox\nnotifications to be built in a more user-friendly way, where the initial load is\nfaster and more data can be fetched incrementally as users interact with the\napp.\n\n### `@liveblocks/react`\n\n- Add pagination support to `useInboxNotifications()`\n\n  ```tsx\n  const {\n    inboxNotifications,\n    isLoading,\n    error,\n\n    // ✨ New in Liveblocks 2.9\n    fetchMore,\n    isFetchingMore,\n    hasFetchedAll,\n    fetchMoreError,\n  } = useInboxNotifications();\n  ```\n\n- Add pagination support to `useThreads()` and `useUserThreads_experimental()`\n\n  ```tsx\n  const {\n    threads,\n    isLoading,\n    error,\n\n    // ✨ New in Liveblocks 2.9\n    fetchMore,\n    isFetchingMore,\n    hasFetchedAll,\n    fetchMoreError,\n  } = useThreads({ query });\n  ```\n\n## 2.8.2\n\n### `@liveblocks/client`\n\n- Send client version in HTTP request headers from the client, to ensure\n  backward compatible responses from the server\n\n## 2.8.1\n\n### `@liveblocks/react-ui`\n\n- Expose `onComposerSubmit` on `Thread` to react to the inner composer of a\n  thread.\n\n## 2.8.0\n\nWe are introducing attachments to allow users to add files to their comments,\nfor more information about this change please read our\n[Upgrade Guide for 2.8](https://liveblocks.io/docs/platform/upgrading/2.8).\n\n### `@liveblocks/react-ui`\n\n- Add out-of-the-box support for attachments in the default components.\n- Add new primitives to support attachments in custom components:\n  -

Returning\n  `undefined` will now be treated as an error.\n- Fix bug where `useUser` and `useRoomInfo` returned an extra `data` superfluous\n  property.\n- Fix bug where customizing types on `createLiveblocksContext` would conflict\n  with the provided `Client`.\n\n### `@liveblocks/react-comments`\n\n- Add actions to `InboxNotification` with a single action for now: marking as\n  read.\n- Improve actions hover behavior in `Comment`/`Thread`.\n- Change `Comment` background color when it’s linked to or being edited.\n\n## v1.10.4\n\n- Fix bundling issue in Vite projects, where `process is not defined` could\n  happen\n\n## v1.10.3\n\n### `@liveblocks/react-comments`\n\n- Add support for Emoji v15.1 in emoji picker, along two additional locales:\n  Bengali (`bn`) and Hindi (`hi`).\n- Fix bug where the `showRoomName` prop on `InboxNotification.Thread` wasn’t\n  applied to notifications about mentions.\n\n### `@liveblocks/react`\n\n- Fix bug where removing metadata via `useEditThreadMetadata` would result in a\n  brief flash of the old metadata after the metadata was removed optimistically.\n\n## v1.10.2\n\n### `@liveblocks/client`\n\n- Fix bug where calling `.clone()` immediately after creating a new `LiveObject`\n  could throw an error\n\n## v1.10.1\n\n### `@liveblocks/client`\n\n- Fix bug where the client’s backoff delay would not be respected correctly in a\n  small edge case.\n\n### `@liveblocks/react-comments`\n\n- Fix date localization in `InboxNotification`.\n- Add vendor prefixes to more CSS properties within the default styles.\n\n### `@liveblocks/react`\n\n- Added error retrying to `useThreads`, `useRoomNotificationSettings`, and\n  `useInboxNotifications` during initial fetching.\n\n## v1.10.0\n\nThis release introduces Notifications (and unread indicators) for Comments.\n\n### `create-liveblocks-app`\n\n- Add `createLiveblocksContext` and Notifications to `--init`.\n- Move resolver options from `createRoomContext` to `createClient` and add\n  `resolveRoomsInfo` to the list of resolvers.\n\n### `@liveblocks/client`\n\n- Add options to `createClient`: `resolveUsers`, `resolveMentionSuggestions`\n  (both were previously defined on `createRoomContext` from\n  `@liveblocks/react`), and the new `resolveRoomsInfo`.\n\n### `@liveblocks/react`\n\n- Add new `LiveblocksContext` accessible with `createLiveblocksContext`,\n  similarly to `createRoomContext`. This context is meant to live at the root\n  since it handles things outside of rooms, like notifications.

It now takes a Yjs encoded update (`Uint8Array`) directly.\n\n## v1.9.0\n\n### `@liveblocks/node`\n\n- Add the Comments write REST APIs as fully typed methods. (includes\n  `createThread`, `editThreadMetadata`, `createComment`, `editComment`,\n  `deleteComment`, `addCommentReaction`, and `removeCommentReaction` methods)\n- Fix the return type of `getActiveUsers` to match the data returned from the\n  endpoint.\n\n### `@liveblocks/react`\n\n- Add `query` option to `useThreads` to filter threads based on their metadata.\n\n### `@liveblocks/react-comments`\n\n- Add support for exit animations to `ComposerSuggestions`.\n\n## v1.8.2\n\n### `@liveblocks/react`\n\n- Improve Comments revalidation when losing network or staying in the\n  background.\n- Improve error handling of Comments mutations.

See\n  [docs](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#Liveblocks-client).\n- Add utilities to work with the `CommentBody` format from Comments:\n  - `getMentionedIdsFromCommentBody(body)` - Get a list of all mentioned IDs\n    from a `CommentBody`. See\n    [docs](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#get-mentioned-ids-from-comment-body).\n  - `stringifyCommentBody(body, options)` - Convert a `CommentBody` to a string,\n    either as plain text, HTML, or Markdown. It supports resolving mention IDs\n    similarly to `@liveblocks/react` and overriding each element to control the\n    formatting. See\n    [docs](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#stringify-comment-body).\n\n## 1.7.1\n\n### `@liveblocks/react-comments`\n\n- Fix `Composer` focus issues.\n- Improve relative date formatting for some locales.

(The old APIs remain working exactly how\nthey are today, however.)\n\n```ts\n// Old APIs we'll no longer be recommending (but that will remain working)\nconst room = client.enter(\"my-room\", options);\nclient.getRoom(\"my-room\");\nclient.leave(\"my-room\");\n```\n\n```ts\n// New API we'll be recommending instead\nconst { room, leave } = client.enterRoom(\"my-room\", options);\nleave();\n```\n\n### `@liveblocks/client`\n\n- New client config option: `backgroundKeepAliveTimeout` (a numeric value in\n  milliseconds). See\n  [docs](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#createClientBackgroundKeepAliveTimeout).\n- New APIs:\n  - `Client.enterRoom(roomId, options)` – enters the room and return both the\n    room and an \"unsubscribe function\" to leave that room again. This newer API\n    supports entering/leaving the same room multiple times, making it possible\n    to connect to the same room from different parts of your application. See\n    [docs](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#Client.enterRoom).\n  - `Client.logout()` – Call this on the Liveblocks client when you log out a\n    user in your application. It will purge all auth tokens and force-leave any\n    rooms, if any are still connected. See\n    [docs](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#Client.logout).\n  - `LiveList.clone()` – see\n    [docs](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#LiveList.clone).\n  - `LiveMap.clone()` – see\n    [docs](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#LiveMap.clone).\n  - `LiveObject.clone()` – see\n    [docs](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#LiveObject.clone).\n- Deprecated APIs:\n  - `client.enter(roomId, options)`\n  - `client.leave(roomId)`\n- Renamed enter option: `shouldInitiallyConnect` → `autoConnect`. Its meaning or\n  working did not change.\n- Fixes a potential `Cannot set parent: node already has a parent` error when\n  initializing storage with Live datastructures that are already tied to a\n  Storage tree.\n\n### `@liveblocks/react`\n\n- Support using multiple `RoomProvider` components in your component tree for\n  the same room ID.\n- Renamed `RoomProvider` prop: `shouldInitiallyConnect` → `autoConnect`. Its\n  meaning or working did not change.\n- New hook:\n  - `useOthersListener({ type, user, others })`, see\n    [docs](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useOthersListener)\n\n### `@liveblocks/redux`\n\n- **Breaking:** The `leaveRoom()` function no longer accepts a `roomId`. It will\n  always leave the currently joined room.\n\n### `@liveblocks/zustand`\n\n- The `enterRoom()` function will now return a leave callback function.\n- **Breaking:** The `leaveRoom()` function no longer accepts a `roomId`. It will\n  always leave the currently joined room.\n\n## v1.4.8\n\n### `create-liveblocks-app`\n\n- Add Comments hooks and options to `--init` command.\n\n### `@liveblocks/client`\n\n- Export all `CommentBody`-related types.\n\n### `@liveblocks/react-comments`\n\n- Improve default styles:\n  - Cap CSS selector specificity to improve overridability.\n  - Set tokens on `.lb-root` instead of `:root` to improve cascading tokens\n    (overriding `--lb-accent` on `body` for example, didn't create the expected\n    results), and to work within shadow DOMs.\n- Fix reactions and links styles on Safari.\n\n## v1.4.7\n\n### `@liveblocks/react`\n\n- Fix `userIds` type in `ResolveUsersArgs`.\n\n## v1.4.6\n\n### `@liveblocks/react`\n\n- Fix a race condition that could cause a Liveblocks client to hang during\n  loading when using Suspense.\n- Fix `useStatus` return value on SSR responses.\n- **Breaking (beta):** The `resolveUser` option in `createRoomContext` is now\n  called `resolveUsers` and it receives a list of user IDs (via the `userIds`\n  property, replacing `userId`) instead of a single one. Instead of returning\n  user info of a single user ID, this function will now expect a list of users'\n  info matching the provided list of user IDs.\n- **Breaking (beta):** The `ResolveUserOptions` and\n  `ResolveMentionSuggestionsOptions` types were renamed to `ResolveUsersArgs`\n  and `ResolveMentionSuggestionsArgs` respectively.\n- `resolveUsers` and `resolveMentionSuggestions` now accept synchronous\n  functions.\n- `resolveUsers` now also provides the current room ID.\n- `editThreadMetadata` now correctly allows `null` to be set on a property.\n  Doing so deletes existing metadata properties.\n\n### `@liveblocks/react-comments`\n\n- Export `ComposerSubmitComment` type from root too, in addition to\n  `/primitives`.\n- Add `onThreadDelete` to `Thread`.\n- Add `metadata` to `Composer` to attach custom metadata to new threads.\n- Add support for specifying a custom `ThreadMetadata` type on `Thread` and\n  `Composer`.\n- **Breaking (beta):** `Comment`’s `onEdit` and `onDelete` were renamed to\n  `onEditComment` and `onDeleteComment` respectively.\n\n## v1.4.5\n\n### `@liveblocks/react`\n\n- Fix `createThread` not creating valid comment.\n\n### `@liveblocks/node`\n\n- Fix URL encoding bug\n\n## v1.4.4\n\n### `@liveblocks/react`\n\n- Fix `removeReaction` not removing reactions which led to reactions displaying\n  a count of 0.\n\n### `@liveblocks/react-comments`\n\n- Fix reactions list (and its add button) showing on all comments.\n- Improve emoji rendering on Windows.\n- Hide country flag emojis when unsupported. (e.g. on Windows)\n\n## v1.4.3\n\n### `@liveblocks/react`\n\n- Add new Comments hooks to add/remove reactions.\n- Fix a bug in `useOthers()` that could lead to the warning \"The result of\n  getServerSnapshot should be cached to avoid an infinite loop\"\n\n### `@liveblocks/react-comments`\n\n- Add support for reactions. (👍)\n- Add keyboard navigation to emoji picker.\n\n## v1.4.2\n\n### `@liveblocks/client`\n\n- Fix a bug where calculating the insertion position between two existing\n  elements could happen incorrectly in a small edge case\n\n## v1.4.1\n\n### `@liveblocks/*`\n\n- [#1177](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/pull/1177) Fix an issue with\n  internal LiveList serialization that could lead to a \"ghosting\" bug with\n  `@liveblocks/zustand` / `@liveblocks/redux` when using tuples.\n\n### `@liveblocks/node`\n\n- Add comment reaction webhook events `CommentReactionAdded` and\n  `CommentReactionRemoved`\n\n## v1.4.0\n\n### DevTools\n\n- New Yjs tab: visualize Yjs documents as a diagram, a tree, or as a list of\n  operations, and inspect Awareness at the same time as Presence.\n- New Events tab: inspect all custom Events a client receives in an event\n  timeline, for easy testing/debugging.\n\n### `@liveblocks/yjs`\n\n- Add support for the Liveblocks [DevTools](https://liveblocks.io/devtools).\n\n### `@liveblocks/client`\n\n- Broadcast event messages now include a `user` property to indicate the user\n  that sent the event:\n  ```tsx\n  room.subscribe(\"event\", ({ event, user }) => {\n    //                              ^^^^ New!\n  });\n  ```\n\n### `@liveblocks/react`\n\n- Broadcast event messages now include a `user` property to indicate the user\n  that sent the event:\n  ```tsx\n  useEventListener(({ event, user }) => {\n    //                       ^^^^ New!\n  });\n  ```\n- **Breaking (beta):** Comments' hook `useThreads` now returns an object in its\n  Suspense version. (`const threads = useThreads()` becomes\n  `const { threads } = useThreads()`)\n\n### `@liveblocks/react-comments`\n\n- **Breaking (beta):** `Comment`’s `indentBody` and `Thread`’s\n  `indentCommentBody` were renamed to `indentContent` and `indentCommentContent`\n  respectively. `Thread`’s `onResolveChange` was renamed to `onResolvedChange`.\n- Add emoji button in `Composer`.\n\n### `@liveblocks/node`\n\n- Support using `@liveblocks/node` in\n  [Edge runtimes](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions/edge-runtime).\n\n## v1.3.6\n\n### `@liveblocks/client`\n\n- Support `unstable_fallbackToHTTP` client option when using any auth token type\n  (previously it only worked when using single-room tokens, which we no longer\n  recommend since 1.2)\n\n## v1.3.5\n\n### `@liveblocks/react`\n\n- Officially mark `useList()`, `useMap()`, and `useObject()` as deprecated in\n  JSDoc comments (we stopped recommending them since the release of 0.18)\n- Deduplicate Comments requests and improve how race conditions are handled\n  during mutations.\n- Fix non-Suspense Comments hooks not working properly in some situations.\n\n### `@liveblocks/react-comments`\n\n- **Breaking (beta):** Replace the render prop API (e.g. `renderMention`,\n  `renderLink`, etc) by a single `components` prop. (e.g.\n  `components={{ Mention, Link }}`)\n- Fix overflowing `Composer.Suggestions`.\n- Reduce the impact of icons on bundle size.\n\n## v1.3.4\n\n### `@liveblocks/react`\n\n- Fix confusing `Error: \"undefined\" is not a valid event name` error when using\n  the (deprecated) `useMap()`, `useObject()`, or `useList()` hooks on\n  uninitialized storage values.\n\n## v1.3.3\n\n### `@liveblocks/*`\n\n- Fix unescaped room IDs when using Comments.\n\n### `@liveblocks/react-comments`\n\n- Add support for auto links. (e.g. `\"www.liveblocks.io\"`)\n\n## v1.3.2\n\n### `@liveblocks/client`\n\n- The client will disconnect with an error if your `/api/liveblocks-auth`\n  backend returns reused/cached tokens. It’s important that auth tokens are\n  always freshly generated, and never get cached or reused. (The client itself\n  will cache and reuse tokens already, so implementing additional caching in\n  your backend isn’t needed, and could even cause reconnection issues.)\n\n## v1.3.1\n\n### `@liveblocks/client`\n\n- Actually include the new Clear History API.\n\n### `@liveblocks/react`\n\n- Fix missing dependency declaration.\n\n## v1.3.0\n\nThis release marks the initial release of\n[Liveblocks Comments](https://liveblocks.io/comments) (private beta).\n\n### `@liveblocks/client`\n\n- New history API: `room.history.clear()` allows you to explicitly clear the\n  history, which resets the ability to undo beyond the current state.\n- Removed long deprecated methods:\n  - `others.count` → Use `others.length` instead\n  - `others.toArray()` → Use `others` instead (it’s already an array)\n- Deprecated the `Others<P, U>` type → Use `readonly User<P, U>[]` instead.\n\n### `@liveblocks/react`\n\n- Add support for Comments.\n- `UserMeta[\"info\"]` can no longer be a scalar value.\n\n### `@liveblocks/react-comments`\n\n- Initial release.\n\n### `@liveblocks/node`\n\n- Add Comments helpers to Client.\n- Add Comments webhook events.\n\n## v1.2.4\n\n### `@liveblocks/node`\n\n- Fixes a bug where sending an empty (or non-string) user ID with\n  `.identifyUser` would confusingly get reported as an HTTP 503.\n\n## v1.2.3\n\n### `@liveblocks/client`\n\n- Improve configuration error messages to be more user friendly.\n- Fix bug where entering a new room could potentially initialize the undo stack\n  incorrectly.\n\n### `create-liveblocks-app`\n\n- Fix Suspense option when specifying a framework.\n- Add helpful comments by default.\n\n## v1.2.2\n\n### `@liveblocks/node`\n\n- Add Yjs document change event (`YDocUpdatedEvent`) to `WebhookHandler`.\n- Allow `Header` object to be passed to `headers` in\n  `WebhookHandler.verifyRequest()`\n\n## v1.2.1\n\n### `@liveblocks/node`\n\n- Fix session.allow to support path up to 128 characters to meet room id length\n  requirement.\n\n## v1.2.0\n\n### `@liveblocks/*`\n\n- Support the new and improved Liveblocks authorization.\n- Change client logic to stop retrying if room is full. Instead, the client will\n  now disconnect. To retry, call `room.reconnect()` explicitly.\n\n### `@liveblocks/node`\n\n- Add new APIs for authorization. See our migration guide for tips on how to\n  adopt the new style of authorizing your Liveblocks clients.\n\n## v1.1.8\n\n- Fix a small TypeScript issue introduced in 1.1.7.\n\n## v1.1.7\n\n### `@liveblocks/client`\n\n- When initializing the client with a\n  [custom auth callback](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#createClientCallback),\n  you can now return `{ error: \"forbidden\", reason: ... }` as the response,\n  which the client will treat as a sign to stop retrying. The client will then\n  disconnect from the room, instead of remaining in `\"connecting\"` status\n  indefinitely.\n\n### `@liveblocks/react`\n\n- Fix a bug with `useSelf()` where it would not correctly re-render after\n  entering an empty room. It’s now consistent again with `useMyPresence()`.\n\n### DevTools\n\n- Fix a bug in the Liveblocks [DevTools](https://liveblocks.io/devtools) panel\n  where the \"me\" view would incorrectly stay empty after entering an empty room.\n\n## v1.1.6\n\n### `@liveblocks/*`\n\n- Loosen duplicate import detection so it won't throw when used in test runners\n  that deliberately run multiple instances of a module (like Jest or Playwright\n  can do).\n\n## v1.1.5\n\n### `@liveblocks/*`\n\n- Ship all of our packages as both ESM and CJS modules again (restore the\n  changes that 1.1.3 originally introduced).\n- Auto-detect if multiple copies of Liveblocks are included in your production\n  bundle. If so, a help page is presented that will help you resolve this issue.\n- Fix a bug where the room internals could become non-functional when used in\n  combination with Immer due to Immer’s excessive auto-freezing, which would\n  break the room’s internals. (This became an issue since Liveblocks 1.1 was\n  released.)\n\n## v1.1.4\n\n- Undo the changes made in 1.1.3. We’ve got some bug reports where Liveblocks\n  could still be doubly-included in production bundles (in some bundler setups\n  only), with storage data corruptions as a possible result. We’re\n  investigating.\n\n## v1.1.3\n\nShip all of our packages as both ESM and CJS modules. By upgrading, your\nproject’s bundler can now perform (better) tree-shaking on the Liveblocks code.\n\nYou can expect (at least) the following bundle size reductions:\n\n- `@liveblocks/client` from 80kB → 70kB\n- `@liveblocks/react` from 129kB → 80kB\n- `@liveblocks/redux` from 84kB → 38kB\n- `@liveblocks/zustand` from 83kB → 37kB\n- `@liveblocks/yjs` from 129kB → 74kB\n\n## v1.1.2\n\n### `@liveblocks/yjs`\n\nAdded Yjs support to **open beta** through the new `@liveblocks/yjs` package\n(not stable yet).\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Fixes a missing internal export.\n\n## v1.1.1\n\n- Fixes a bug where under certain circumstances the Liveblocks client could\n  incorrectly throw a `Not started yet` error message.\n\n## v1.1.0\n\nThis release improves the client’s internals to ensure a more reliable\nconnection with Liveblocks servers.\n\n### `@liveblocks/client`\n\n- New APIs:\n  - `room.getStatus()`: returns the current status of the WebSocket connection:\n    `\"initial\"`, `\"connecting\"`, `\"connected\"`, `\"reconnecting\"`, or\n    `\"disconnected\"`\n  - `room.subscribe(\"status\")`: subscribe to changes of the connection status.\n  - `room.subscribe(\"lost-connection\")`: high-level API to get informed when\n    Liveblocks’ automatic reconnection process is taking longer than usual, so\n    you can show a toast message on screen. (See this\n    [example](https://liveblocks.io/examples/connection-status) for an\n    illustration.)\n- New behavior:\n  - The client will stop retrying to establish a connection in cases where\n    retrying would not help. For example an explicit 403 forbidden response from\n    your backend, or a configuration error.\n  - The client will more quickly reconnect even after long periods of sleep.\n\n### `@liveblocks/react`\n\n- New APIs:\n  - `useStatus()` - React hook version of `room.getStatus()`\n  - `useLostConnectionListener()` - React hook version of\n    `room.subscribe(\"lost-connection\")` (See this\n    [example](https://liveblocks.io/examples/connection-status) for an\n    illustration.)\n\n### Bugs fixed\n\n- Reconnection would sometimes not work after long periods of sleep. Waking up\n  is now instant.\n- React clients using Suspense could sometimes incorrectly bounce back to the\n  Suspense boundary after a successful load. No longer!\n- Client could sometimes not load storage after reconnecting. Not anymore!\n- Others array will no longer flash during an internal reconnect.\n- DevTools now keeps working even when the client goes offline.\n\n### Deprecated APIs\n\nThese APIs still work, but are replaced by newer APIs. The old APIs will be\nremoved in a future release of Liveblocks.\n\nOld connection status codes are replaced by the new ones:\n\n| ❌ Old statuses | ✅ New statuses |\n| --------------- | --------------- |\n| closed          | initial         |\n| authenticating  | connecting      |\n| connecting      | connecting      |\n| open            | connected       |\n| unavailable     | reconnecting    |\n| failed          | disconnected    |\n\nRecommended steps to upgrade:\n\n- ❌ `room.getConnectionState()` → ✅ `room.getStatus()`\n- ❌ `room.subscribe('connection')` → ✅ `room.subscribe('status')`\n- Old client options:\n  - ❌ `clientOptions.fetchPolyfill`\n  - ❌ `clientOptions.WebSocketPolyfill` → ✅\n    `clientOptions.polyfills: { fetch, WebSocket }`\n\n## v1.0.12\n\n### `create-liveblocks-app`\n\n- Added `export type TypedRoom = Room<...>` to init command for non-React apps.\n\n## v1.0.11\n\n### `@liveblocks/client`\n\n- Fix a bug where undo/redo on `LiveObject` creates exponentially larger deltas.\n\n## v1.0.10\n\n### `@liveblocks/client`\n\n- Fix a bug related to proactive token expiration detection.\n- Internal refactorings.\n- Add unstable_fallbackToHTTP option to the core client to support messages over\n  1MB.\n\n### `@liveblocks/node`\n\n- Fix incorrect status code when Liveblocks server cannot be reached\n  temporarily.\n\n## v1.0.9\n\n### `@liveblocks/client`\n\n- Export `LiveListUpdate`, `LiveMapUpdate`, and `LiveObjectUpdate` types used by\n  the storage update callback.\n- Export new utility, `toPlainLson`, to assist in calling the initialize storage\n  API.\n- Internal refactorings.\n\n## v1.0.8\n\n### `@liveblocks/client`\n\n- Internal refactorings.\n\n### `create-liveblocks-app`\n\n- Added\n  [flags](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/tree/main/tools/create-liveblocks-app#flags-optional)\n  for creating config files with `--init`. (e.g. `--framework react`)\n- Added an error if an incorrect flag is used.\n- Slightly changed the format of the default config file.\n\n### `@liveblocks/client`\n\n- Internal refactorings.\n\n## v1.0.7\n\n- Private API changes only.\n\n## v1.0.6\n\n## Internal changes\n\n- Release `create-liveblocks-app` along with other Liveblocks packages, using\n  the same versioning scheme.\n- Internal refactorings.\n\n## v1.0.5\n\nNon-existent.\n\n## v1.0.4\n\nNon-existent.\n\n## v1.0.3\n\nNon-existent.\n\n## v1.0.2\n\n- Fix bug where passing down `shouldInitiallyConnect` connection option would\n  not always work.\n\n## v1.0.1\n\n- Log stack traces of function calls that resulted in rejected storage mutations\n  to the console in non-production builds to ease debugging.\n\n### `@liveblocks/client`\n\n- Fixes bug where the state of `others` in a room was wrong when:\n  - Client A disconnects improperly (ex: computer goes to sleep)\n  - Then Client B disconnects (ex: computer goes to sleep)\n  - Then Client A reconnects: client B still shows in the `others` state\n\n## v1.0.0\n\nThis major release marks the maturity of Liveblocks. For upgrade instructions,\nsee the [1.0 upgrade guide](https://liveblocks.io/docs/platform/upgrading/1.0).\n\n## `@liveblocks/node`\n\n`authorize` option `userId` is now mandatory.\n\nOur new [pricing](https://liveblocks.io/pricing) is based on Monthly Active\nUsers instead of connections. We're using `userId` to track MAU associated to a\nLiveblocks account.\n\n## v0.19.11\n\n## `@liveblocks/node`\n\n- `WebhookHandler` now handles `RoomCreatedEvent` and `RoomDeletedEvent`\n\n## v0.19.10\n\n## `@liveblocks/client`\n\n- Allow\n  [`createClient`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#createClientThrottle)\n  `throttle` option to go as low as 16ms.\n\n## v0.19.9\n\n## `@liveblocks/client`\n\n- Adds a `WebhookHandler` class\n  - `new WebhookHandler(secret).verifyRequest({ rawBody, headers })` can be used\n    to verify event requests from Liveblock's webhook functionality. It also\n    provides fully typed `WebhookEvents`.\n  - Check out our [Webhooks guide](https://liveblocks.io/docs/guides/webhooks)\n    for more details\n\n## v0.19.8\n\n- Fixes a bug where history didn't reliably undo `LiveObject` key set changes if\n  any pending local changes existed on that key.\n- Fixes a bug where changes performed inside `room.batch` were incorrectly\n  ordered inside the history resulting in unexpected undo behavior in some\n  cases.\n- Fixes a bug where under some circumstances the Liveblocks client could get\n  stuck in a \"synchronizing\" state indefinitely\n- Expose `JsonArray` and `JsonScalar` types publicly\n\n## v0.19.7\n\nFix nested storage event handling issue.\n\n## v0.19.6\n\nSupport authentication with cookies.\n\n## v0.19.5\n\nExport the `StorageStatus` type (introduced with 0.19.3).\n\n## v0.19.4\n\nFix CORS issue.\n\n## v0.19.3\n\nIn **@liveblocks/client**:\n\n## Room.getStorageStatus\n\nGet the storage status.\n\n- `not-loaded`: Initial state when entering the room.\n- `loading`: Once the storage has been requested via room.getStorage().\n- `synchronizing`: When some local updates have not been acknowledged by\n  Liveblocks servers.\n- `synchronized`: Storage is in sync with Liveblocks servers.\n\n## Room.subscribe(\"storage-status\", status => { })\n\nSubscribe to storage status changes.\n\nReturns an unsubscribe function.\n\n```typescript\nroom.subscribe(\"storage-status\", (status) => {\n  switch (status) {\n    case \"not-loaded\":\n      break;\n    case \"loading\":\n      break;\n    case \"synchronizing\":\n      break;\n    case \"synchronized\":\n      break;\n    default:\n      break;\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## Room.reconnect\n\nClose the room connection and try to reconnect.\n\n## Internal changes\n\n- Add support for the upcoming Liveblocks browser extension\n\n## v0.19.2\n\nFixes some internal type definitions.\n\n## v0.19.1\n\nFixes an issue where `import`s from Liveblocks packages could not be resolved\ncorrectly in certain build environments.\n\n## v0.19.0\n\nThis release brings Zustand v4 support. This is a breaking change **only if\nyou’re using @liveblocks/zustand**.\n\nIn **@liveblocks/zustand**:\n\n- Support Zustand v4 (actually v4.1.3 or higher)\n- Drop support for Zustand v3 (also v4.1.2 or lower are not supported)\n- Fix bug where some usage pattern could cause the Zustand store to stop\n  synching (#491)\n\nTo migrate, make the following code changes:\n\n- `npm install zustand@latest`\n- `npm install @liveblocks/zustand@latest`\n- Change these imports, if applicable:\n  ```diff\n  -import { middleware } from \"@liveblocks/zustand\";\n  +import { liveblocks } from \"@liveblocks/zustand\";\n  ```\n  and\n  ```diff\n  -import type { LiveblocksState } from \"@liveblocks/zustand\";\n  +import type { WithLiveblocks } from \"@liveblocks/zustand\";\n  ```\n  and rename accordingly.\n- Change the pattern:\n  ```ts\n  create(liveblocks<MyState, ...>(...))\n  ```\n  to the Zustand v4 recommended pattern:\n  ```ts\n  create<WithLiveblocks<MyState, ...>>()(liveblocks(...))\n  ```\n  To be clear:\n  1.  First, move the type annotation away from the `liveblocks` middleware\n      call, and onto the `create` call.\n  2.  Next, wrap your `MyState` type in a `WithLiveblocks<...>` wrapper. This\n      will make sure the injected `liveblocks` property on your Zustand state\n      will be correctly typed.\n  3.  Finally, make sure to add the extra call `()` wrapper, needed by Zustand\n      v4 now:\n      ```ts\n      create<WithLiveblocks<MyState, ...>>()(liveblocks(...))\n      //                                  ^^ Not a typo\n      ```\n- Remove the second argument to `state.liveblocks.enterRoom()`: it no longer\n  takes an explicit initial state. Instead, it's automatically be populated from\n  your Zustand state.\n\nIn **@liveblocks/redux**:\n\n- The main export has been renamed:\n  ```diff\n  -import { enhancer } from \"@liveblocks/redux\";\n  +import { liveblocksEnhancer } from \"@liveblocks/redux\";\n  ```\n- The second argument to `state.liveblocks.enterRoom()` to send in an explicit\n  initial state is no longer supported. It will use the state in your Redux\n  store, for consistency and ease of use.\n\n## v0.18.5\n\nBug fix:\n\n- Fixes a small bug in a type definition, `scopes` was removed from\n  `BaseUserMeta`.\n\nInternal updates:\n\n- Switch the monorepo over to Turborepo.\n\n## v0.18.4\n\nAll packages now provide an `isReadOnly` flag on user instances. It is available\nwhen getting self or others. `isReadOnly` is true when storage is read-only, see\nthe\n[room management guide](https://liveblocks.io/docs/guides/managing-rooms-users-permissions#permissions)\nfor more information.\n\n```ts\nconst me = room.getSelf();\n\nme.isReadOnly; // boolean\n\nconst others = room.getOthers();\nfor (const other of others) {\n  other.isReadOnly; // boolean\n}\n```\n\nIn **@liveblocks/client**:\n\n- Add a new option `shouldInitiallyConnect` to `client.enter` that let you\n  control whether or not the room connects to Liveblocks servers. Default is\n  `true`.\n\n  Usually set to false when the client is used from the server to not call the\n  authentication endpoint or connect via WebSocket.\n\nIn **@liveblocks/react**:\n\n- Add a new property `shouldInitiallyConnect` to `RoomProvider` that let you\n  control whether or not the room connects to Liveblocks servers. Default is\n  `true`.\n\n  By default equals to `typeof window !== \"undefined\"`, meaning the RoomProvider\n  tries to connect to Liveblocks servers only on the client side.\n\n- Internal package restructurings to increase code sharing. You may notice a new\n  dependency show up in your dependency tree: `@liveblocks/core`. It contains\n  private APIs that aren't intended for direct consumption.\n\n## v0.18.3\n\n- In **@liveblocks/react**:\n\n  Fixes the \"zombie-child\" problem that can occur with React 17 or lower. **If\n  you’re on React 18: great, you can ignore this!** If you’re using React 17 or\n  lower with Liveblocks, we’ll now start to enforce that you pass the\n  `unstable_batchedUpdates` prop to RoomProvider, so this problem can be\n  circumvented. This small addition may save you hours of debugging time!\n\n  ```tsx\n  // ⚠️  Only if you’re using React 17 or lower\n  import { unstable_batchedUpdates } from \"react-dom\";  // 👈\n\n  <RoomProvider\n    id=\"my-room\"\n    initialPresence={...}\n    initialStorage={...}\n    unstable_batchedUpdates={unstable_batchedUpdates}  // 👈\n  >\n    <App />\n  </RoomProvider>\n  ```\n\n  To read more, see\n  https://liveblocks.io/docs/guides/troubleshooting#stale-props-zombie-child\n\n- In **@liveblocks/zustand**:\n\n  - Fix a confusing error message\n\n## v0.18.2\n\n- In **@liveblocks/react**:\n\n  - Make sure that `useOther` will not rerender if tracked users already left\n    the room, so that child components won't get rerendered before the parent\n    got the chance to unmount them.\n  - Disallow `useOther` without selector\n\n## v0.18.1\n\n- In **@liveblocks/react**:\n\n  - Fix a bug that could cause an error when patching presence during local\n    development. Not an issue in production builds. (#505)\n\n## v0.18.0\n\nFor information, please read our\n[Upgrade Guide for 0.18](https://liveblocks.io/docs/platform/upgrading/0.18).\n\n### New React hooks ✨\n\n- In **@liveblocks/react**:\n\n  - [`useStorage`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useStorage)\n  - [`useMutation`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useMutation)\n  - [`useSelf`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useSelf)\n  - [`useOthers`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useOthers)\n  - [`useOthersMapped`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useOthersMapped)\n  - [`useOthersConnectionIds`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useOthersConnectionIds)\n  - [`useOther`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useOther)\n    (singular)\n\n- In **@liveblocks/client**:\n\n  - New\n    [`.toImmutable()`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#LiveObject.toImmutable)\n    method on `LiveObject`, `LiveList`, and `LiveMap` lets you work with an\n    immutable representation of the storage objects\n  - Improved core performance\n  - Reduced bundle size\n  - Others only become visible in the `others` array if their presence is known\n\n### Breaking changes\n\n- Remove support for directly importing hooks from **@liveblocks/client** (e.g.\n  `import { useMyPresence } from '@liveblocks/react'`). If you’re still using\n  these imports, see the\n  [Upgrade Guide for 0.17](https://liveblocks.io/docs/platform/upgrading/0.17)\n  for instructions.\n- Remove `ClientProvider` and `useClient` hook\n- Remove `defaultPresence` and `defaultStorageRoot` arguments. (Just use\n  `initialPresence` and `initialStorage` arguments now.)\n- Remove second argument to `useMap()`, `useList()`, and `useObject()`.\n- Remove `new LiveMap(null)` support. (Just use `new LiveMap()` or\n  `new LiveMap([])`.)\n\n## v0.17.11\n\nGeneral:\n\n- Fix a packaging bug\n\nIn **@liveblocks/react**:\n\n- Deprecate an undocumented API\n\n## v0.17.9\n\n- Fix bug that could cause duplicate copies of @liveblocks/client to end up in\n  final bundle, for certain bundler configurations.\n- Fix bug where in some conditions the initial presence for a new connection\n  would not come through to all existing clients in the room\n- Various internal changes\n\n## v0.17.8\n\n### New history APIs ↩️ ↪️\n\n- In **@liveblocks/client**:\n\n  - Add `canUndo()` and `canRedo()` utilities to `room.history`\n  - Add `\"history\"` event type to `room.subscribe()` to subscribe to the current\n    user's history changes\n\n- In **@liveblocks/react**:\n\n  - Add `useCanUndo()` and `useCanRedo()` hooks\n\n## v0.17.7\n\n- In **@liveblocks/zustand**:\n\n  - Simplify zustand middleware integration with Typescript. `TPresence`,\n    `TStorage`, `TUserMeta`, and `TRoomEvent` are now optional.\n\nNote that `@liveblocks/zustand` does not work with zustand > v4 because v3 and\nv4 have completely different type definitions. As soon as zustand v4 is out of\nthe RC phase, we will consider updating our middleware to work with the latest\nversion.\n\n### Example\n\nLet's take a look at our\n[To-do list](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/tree/main/examples/zustand-todo-list)\nexample. Without our middleware, the store would look like this:\n\n```ts\nimport create from \"zustand\";\n\ntype State = {\n  draft: string;\n  isTyping: boolean;\n  todos: Todo[];\n  setDraft: (draft: string) => void;\n  addTodo: () => void;\n  deleteTodo: (index: number) => void;\n};\n\ncreate<State>(/* ... */);\n```\n\nWith our middleware, you simply need to move the `State` param at the middleware\nlevel:\n\n```ts\nimport create from \"zustand\";\nimport { createClient } from \"@liveblocks/client\";\nimport { middleware } from \"@liveblocks/zustand\";\n\nconst client = createClient({ /*...*/ });\n\ntype State = {\n  draft: string;\n  isTyping: boolean;\n  todos: Todo[];\n  setDraft: (draft: string) => void;\n  addTodo: () => void;\n  deleteTodo: (index: number) => void;\n};\n\ncreate(\n  middleware<State>(/* ... */, {\n    client,\n    presenceMapping: { isTyping: true },\n    storageMapping: { todos: true }\n  })\n);\n```\n\nIf you want to type `others` presence, you can use the `TPresence` generic\nargument on the middleware.\n\n```ts\n\ntype Presence = {\n  isTyping: true;\n}\n\nconst useStore = create(\n  middleware<State, Presence>(/* ... */, {\n    client,\n    presenceMapping: { isTyping: true },\n    storageMapping: { todos: true }\n  })\n);\n\n// In your component\nuseStore(state => state.liveblocks.others[0].presence?.isTyping)\n```\n\n## v0.17.6\n\n- In **@liveblocks/react**:\n\n  - Expose `RoomContext` in the return value of `createRoomContext()`\n\n## v0.17.5\n\n- In **@liveblocks/react**:\n\n  - Fix bug where changing the `key` argument of `useMap()`, `useList()`,\n    `useObject()` did not resubscribe to updates correctly\n  - Ignore changes to the `RoomProvider`'s initial presence/storage props on\n    subsequent renders. This makes it behave closer to `useState(initialState)`\n\n## v0.17.4\n\nFix missing documentation for hooks created via `createRoomContext()`.\n\n## v0.17.1\n\nFix `@liveblocks/nodes` packaging.\n\n## v0.17.0\n\nFor information, please read our\n[Upgrade Guide](https://liveblocks.io/docs/platform/upgrading/0.17).\n\n### TypeScript improvements ✨\n\nThis release contains major TypeScript improvements. The recommended setup now\nis that you define your own Presence and Storage types at the highest level\n(i.e. where you set up the room). After that initial one-time setup, you will no\nlonger need to provide any extra type annotations anywhere for your Liveblocks\ncode! 🙌\n\nTo learn how to set that up, follow the instructions in our\n[Upgrade Guide](https://liveblocks.io/docs/platform/upgrading/0.17).\n\n- No more `any` types used (in `@liveblocks/client` and `@liveblocks/react`)\n- All APIs that work with Presence data will now require it to be\n  JSON-serializable\n- All APIs that work with Storage data will now require it to be LSON (= JSON +\n  Live structures)\n- All Live structures now take mandatory type params for their payloads, just\n  like the built-in array, object, and map types do:\n  - `LiveMap<K, V>` (like `Map<K, V>`)\n  - `LiveObject<{ a: number, b: string }>` (like, for example,\n    `{ a: number, b: string }`)\n  - `LiveList<T>` (like `Array<T>`)\n\n### React Native support ✨\n\nWe now support React Native! To learn how to use Liveblocks in your React Native\nprojects, see our\n[API reference](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#createClientReactNative).\nIt's surprisingly simple!\n\n### New APIs ✨\n\n- In **@liveblocks/react**:\n\n  - [`createRoomContext()`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#createRoomContext)\n    is now the preferred way to initialize hooks.\n\n- In the API:\n\n  - New endpoint to\n    [Get Users in a Room](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#GetRoomUsers)\n  - New endpoint to\n    [Get a list of all Rooms](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#GetRooms)\n\n### Bug fixes 🐛\n\n- Improved conflict resolution on LiveList\n- Various minor internal bug fixes\n\n### Breaking changes\n\n- In **@liveblocks/client**:\n\n  - Removed old `Room.unsubscribe()` API\n\n### New deprecations\n\n- In **@liveblocks/client**:\n\n  - The `defaultPresence` option to `client.enter()` will get renamed to\n    `initialPresence`\n  - The `defaultStorageRoot` option to `client.enter()` will get renamed to\n    `initialStorage`\n  - Calling `new LiveMap(null)` will stop working. Please use `new LiveMap()`,\n    or `new LiveMap([])`\n\n- In **@liveblocks/react**:\n\n  - Importing the React hooks directly is deprecated, instead use the new\n    `createRoomContext()` helper. For help, read the\n    [Recommended Upgrade Steps section](https://liveblocks.io/docs/platform/upgrading/0.17#recommended-upgrade-steps)\n    within our\n    [Upgrade Guide](https://liveblocks.io/docs/platform/upgrading/0.17)\n  - The second argument to `useList()`, `useObject()`, and `useMap()` is\n    deprecated\n  - The RoomProvider's `defaultPresence` is renamed to `initialPresence`\n  - The RoomProvider's `defaultStorageRoot` is renamed to `initialStorage`\n\n## v0.16.17\n\nFix bug in internal code where some legal authentication tokens would be\nconsidered invalid.\n\n## v0.16.16\n\nInternals only.\n\n## v0.16.15\n\nInternals only.\n\n## v0.16.14\n\nFix an issue where the current user's info would not properly display accented\ncharacters.\n\n## v0.16.13\n\n(Unpublished.)\n\n## v0.16.12\n\nInternals only.\n\n## v0.16.11\n\nExpose helper type to help users adopt to using Live structures with interfaces\nthey don't own.\n\n## v0.16.10\n\nRestructures a few more internals.\n\n## v0.16.9\n\nRestructures a few internals.\n\n## v0.16.8\n\nFix bug in private/internal code.\n\n## v0.16.7\n\nFix bug in private/internal code.\n\n## v0.16.6\n\nFix bug in example code suggested in deprecation warning.\n\n## v0.16.5\n\n### All packages\n\n- Various internal refactorings\n\n### Bug fixes\n\n- In **@liveblocks/client**:\n\n  - If you're using `@liveblocks/client` in a ES2015 context, you no longer have\n    to polyfill `Object.fromEntries()`.\n\n## v0.16.4\n\n### All packages\n\n- Improve our generated bundles. They are now even more tree-shakable, and\n  smaller!\n- Some APIs are being deprecation and will show warnings in the dev console when\n  used\n\n## v0.16.3\n\n### Bug fixes\n\n- In **@liveblocks/client**:\n\n  - Fix bug where internal presence state could not get restored correctly after\n    undo/redo in certain circumstances.\n\n- In **@liveblocks/zustand** and **@liveblocks/redux**:\n\n  - Fixes an issue when initializing an array with items would result in having\n    duplicated items in other clients. Example:\n\n    - Client A updates state : `{ list: [0] }`\n    - Client B states is updated to : `{ list: [0, 0] }`\n\n## v0.16.2\n\n### Bug fixes\n\n- In **@liveblocks/client**:\n\n  - Fix small bug related to new `JsonObject` type, which would reject some\n    values that were legal JSON objects.\n\n## v0.16.1\n\n### Bug fixes\n\n- In **@liveblocks/react**:\n\n  - Fix issue with React 18 and StrictMode.\n\n## v0.16.0\n\n### New APIs\n\n#### `LiveList.set`\n\nSet one element at a specified index.\n\n```typescript\nconst list = new LiveList([\"🦁\", \"🦊\", \"🐵\"]);\nlist.set(0, \"🐺\");\nlist.toArray(); // equals [\"🐺\", \"🦊\", \"🐵\"]\n```\n\nhttps://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/pull/147 for more information\n\n⚠️ **_Before using `LiveList.set`, you need to make sure that all connected\nclients are using `0.16.0`.

If you’re unable to upgrade\n  React to 18 or higher, you can still continue to use Liveblocks 2.14.0, which\n  is the last version to support React versions lower than 18.\n\n### All packages\n\n- The published target for all Liveblocks packages is now ES2022 (up from\n  ES2020). This should have a positive impact on your bundle size[\\*].\n\n- Various internal refactorings and code cleanup.\n\n[\\*] If you bundle for the browser, this should not be a problem, as all major\nbrowsers support ES2022. If however you're specifically targeting very old\nbrowsers (mostly IE), then you may need to configure your bundler (Webpack,\nrollup, esbuild, etc) to also down-compile code from dependencies inside\n`node_modules` for you, if you aren't already.\n\n## Website\n\n- New blog post: [A better way to email your users about unread content](https://liveblocks.io/blog/a-better-way-to-email-your-users-about-unread-content).\n\n## Examples\n\n- Adjusted email templates to allow switching the logo more easily.\n- Next.js Starter Kit improvements:\n  - Renaming a document updates it immediately for everyone else.\n  - Clicking outside of the rename input saves the new name.\n  - Added tldraw's dark mode.\n  - Added option to filter for canvas in the room listing.\n  - Upgraded Liveblocks.\n  - Fixed a z-index problem and added a hover style.\n\n## Documentation\n\n- [Upgrade guide for 2.15](https://liveblocks.io/docs/platform/upgrading/2.15).\n- Added links to email templates in guides and API reference.\n\n## Contributors\n\nctnicholas, nvie, marcbouchenoire\n\n# Week 50 (2024-12-13)\n\n## v2.14.0\n\n### `@liveblocks/emails`\n\n- Add new functions [`prepareTextMentionNotificationEmailAsHtml`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-emails#prepare-text-mention-notification-email-as-html) and\n  [`prepareTextMentionNotificationEmailAsReact`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-emails#prepare-text-mention-notification-email-as-react) to support text mention\n  notification event for Lexical and Tiptap text editors and prepare data into\n  email-ready formats.\n\n## v2.13.2\n\n### `@liveblocks/react-lexical`\n\n- Fix report text editor function's call.

Whether you use Storage, Text Editors,\nThreads, or Notifications. If the client’s sync status is `synchronized`, it\nmeans all local pending changes have been persisted by our servers. If there are\npending local changes in any part of Liveblocks you’re using, then the client’s\nsync status will be `synchronizing`.\n\nAlso, we’re introducing a way to prevent browser tabs from being closed while\nlocal changes are not yet synchronized. To opt-in to this protection, enable\n`preventUnsavedChanges` option on the client:\n\n- In React: `<LiveblocksProvider preventUnsavedChanges />`\n- Otherwise: `createClient({ preventUnsavedChanges: true })`\n\n### `@liveblocks/client`\n\n- Add new API\n  [`client.getSyncStatus()`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#Client.getSyncStatus)\n  method.\n- Add new client config option:\n  [`preventUnsavedChanges`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#prevent-users-losing-unsaved-changes).\n- Expose `ToImmutable<T>` helper type.\n\n### `@liveblocks/react`\n\n- Add new hook\n  [`useSyncStatus`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useSyncStatus)\n  that can be used to tell whether Liveblocks is synchronizing local changes to\n  the server. Useful to display a \"Saving...\" spinner in your application, when\n  used with `useSyncStatus({ smooth: true })`.\n- Add new `LiveblocksProvider` prop:\n  [`preventUnsavedChanges`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#prevent-users-losing-unsaved-changes).\n- Deprecated APIs:\n  - `useStorageStatus` is now deprecated in favor of `useSyncStatus`.\n\n### `@liveblocks/react-ui`\n\n- Take composers into account when the new `preventUnsavedChanges` option is\n  set.\n\n### `@liveblocks/react-lexical`\n\n- Add new hook\n  [`useIsEditorReady`](http://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react-lexical#useIsEditorReady)\n  which can be used to show a skeleton UI before the editor has received the\n  initial text from the server.\n- Deprecated APIs:\n  - `useEditorStatus` is now deprecated in favor of `useIsEditorReady` (or\n    `useSyncStatus`).\n\n## Examples\n\n- Added new canvas document type to\n  [Next.js Starter Kit](https://liveblocks.io/nextjs-starter-kit), powered by\n  [tldraw](https://tldraw.dev/).\n- Added loading `useStatusSync` loading spinners to\n  [Linear-like Issue Tracker](https://liveblocks.io/examples/linear-like-issue-tracker/nextjs-linear-like-issue-tracker)\n  and\n  [Notion-like AI editor](https://liveblocks.io/examples/notion-like-ai-editor/nextjs-notion-like-ai-editor).\n- Added `useIsEditorReady` to Lexical examples.\n\n## Dashboard\n\n- Redirect users to a specific error page on authentication failure.\n\n## Contributors\n\nctnicholas, nvie, marcbouchenoire, nimeshnayaju, sugardarius\n\n# Week 45 (2024-11-08)\n\n## v2.11.0\n\n### `@liveblocks/react-ui`\n\n- Upgrade dependencies.\n- Fix minor appearance issues related to attachments.\n- Fix pasting issues introduced in 2.10.0.\n\n### `@liveblocks/react`\n\n- Fix regression with `useThreads` that caused the hook to return an error if\n  its associated room did not exist.\n\n### `@liveblocks/react-tiptap`\n\n- Initial release.\n\n### `@liveblocks/emails`\n\n- Initial release.\n\n## Documentation\n\n-

See\n  [docs](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#Liveblocks-client).\n- Add utilities to work with the `CommentBody` format from Comments:\n  - `getMentionedIdsFromCommentBody(body)` - Get a list of all mentioned IDs\n    from a `CommentBody`. See\n    [docs](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-node#get-mentioned-ids-from-comment-body).\n  - `stringifyCommentBody(body, options)` - Convert a `CommentBody` to a string,\n    either as plain text, HTML, or Markdown.

(The old APIs remain working exactly how\nthey are today, however.)\n\n```ts\n// Old APIs we'll no longer be recommending (but that will remain working)\nconst room = client.enter(\"my-room\", options);\nclient.getRoom(\"my-room\");\nclient.leave(\"my-room\");\n```\n\n```ts\n// New API we'll be recommending instead\nconst { room, leave } = client.enterRoom(\"my-room\", options);\nleave();\n```\n\n## `@liveblocks/client`\n\n- New client config option: `backgroundKeepAliveTimeout` (a numeric value in\n  milliseconds). See\n  [docs](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#createClientBackgroundKeepAliveTimeout).\n- New APIs:\n  - `Client.enterRoom(roomId, options)` – enters the room and return both the\n    room and an \"unsubscribe function\" to leave that room again. This newer API\n    supports entering/leaving the same room multiple times, making it possible\n    to connect to the same room from different parts of your application. See\n    [docs](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#Client.enterRoom).\n  - `Client.logout()` – Call this on the Liveblocks client when you log out a\n    user in your application. It will purge all auth tokens and force-leave any\n    rooms, if any are still connected. See\n    [docs](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#Client.logout).\n  - `LiveList.clone()` – see\n    [docs](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#LiveList.clone).\n  - `LiveMap.clone()` – see\n    [docs](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#LiveMap.clone).\n  - `LiveObject.clone()` – see\n    [docs](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#LiveObject.clone).\n- Deprecated APIs:\n  - `client.enter(roomId, options)`\n  - `client.leave(roomId)`\n- Renamed enter option: `shouldInitiallyConnect` → `autoConnect`. Its meaning or\n  working did not change.\n- Fixes a potential `Cannot set parent: node already has a parent` error when\n  initializing storage with Live datastructures that are already tied to a\n  Storage tree.\n\n## `@liveblocks/react`\n\n- Support using multiple `RoomProvider` components in your component tree for\n  the same room ID.\n- Renamed `RoomProvider` prop: `shouldInitiallyConnect` → `autoConnect`. Its\n  meaning or working did not change.\n- New hook:\n  - `useOthersListener({ type, user, others })`, see\n    [docs](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useOthersListener)\n\n## `@liveblocks/redux`\n\n- **Breaking:** The `leaveRoom()` function no longer accepts a `roomId`. It will\n  always leave the currently joined room.\n\n## `@liveblocks/zustand`\n\n- The `enterRoom()` function will now return a leave callback function.\n- **Breaking:** The `leaveRoom()` function no longer accepts a `roomId`. It will\n  always leave the currently joined room.\n\n# v1.4.8\n\n## `create-liveblocks-app`\n\n- Add Comments hooks and options to `--init` command.\n\n## `@liveblocks/client`\n\n- Export all `CommentBody`-related types.\n\n## `@liveblocks/react-comments`\n\n- Improve default styles:\n  - Cap CSS selector specificity to improve overridability.\n  - Set tokens on `.lb-root` instead of `:root` to improve cascading tokens\n    (overriding `--lb-accent` on `body` for example, didn't create the expected\n    results), and to work within shadow DOMs.\n- Fix reactions and links styles on Safari.\n\n# v1.4.7\n\n## `@liveblocks/react`\n\n- Fix `userIds` type in `ResolveUsersArgs`.\n\n# v1.4.6\n\n## `@liveblocks/react`\n\n- Fix a race condition that could cause a Liveblocks client to hang during\n  loading when using Suspense.\n- Fix `useStatus` return value on SSR responses.\n- **Breaking (beta):** The `resolveUser` option in `createRoomContext` is now\n  called `resolveUsers` and it receives a list of user IDs (via the `userIds`\n  property, replacing `userId`) instead of a single one. Instead of returning\n  user info of a single user ID, this function will now expect a list of users'\n  info matching the provided list of user IDs.\n- **Breaking (beta):** The `ResolveUserOptions` and\n  `ResolveMentionSuggestionsOptions` types were renamed to `ResolveUsersArgs`\n  and `ResolveMentionSuggestionsArgs` respectively.\n- `resolveUsers` and `resolveMentionSuggestions` now accept synchronous\n  functions.\n- `resolveUsers` now also provides the current room ID.\n- `editThreadMetadata` now correctly allows `null` to be set on a property.\n  Doing so deletes existing metadata properties.\n\n## `@liveblocks/react-comments`\n\n- Export `ComposerSubmitComment` type from root too, in addition to\n  `/primitives`.\n- Add `onThreadDelete` to `Thread`.\n- Add `metadata` to `Composer` to attach custom metadata to new threads.\n- Add support for specifying a custom `ThreadMetadata` type on `Thread` and\n  `Composer`.\n- **Breaking (beta):** `Comment`’s `onEdit` and `onDelete` were renamed to\n  `onEditComment` and `onDeleteComment` respectively.\n\n# v1.4.5\n\n## `@liveblocks/react`\n\n- Fix `createThread` not creating valid comment.\n\n## `@liveblocks/node`\n\n- Fix URL encoding bug\n\n# v1.4.4\n\n## `@liveblocks/react`\n\n- Fix `removeReaction` not removing reactions which led to reactions displaying\n  a count of 0.\n\n## `@liveblocks/react-comments`\n\n- Fix reactions list (and its add button) showing on all comments.\n- Improve emoji rendering on Windows.\n- Hide country flag emojis when unsupported.

(e.g. `\"www.liveblocks.io\"`)\n\n# v1.3.2\n\n## `@liveblocks/client`\n\n- The client will disconnect with an error if your `/api/liveblocks-auth`\n  backend returns reused/cached tokens. It’s important that auth tokens are\n  always freshly generated, and never get cached or reused. (The client itself\n  will cache and reuse tokens already, so implementing additional caching in\n  your backend isn’t needed, and could even cause reconnection issues.)\n\n# v1.3.1\n\n## `@liveblocks/client`\n\n- Actually include the new Clear History API.\n\n## `@liveblocks/react`\n\n- Fix missing dependency declaration.\n\n# v1.3.0\n\nThis release marks the initial release of\n[Liveblocks Comments](https://liveblocks.io/comments) (private beta).\n\n## `@liveblocks/client`\n\n- New history API: `room.history.clear()` allows you to explicitly clear the\n  history, which resets the ability to undo beyond the current state.\n- Removed long deprecated methods:\n  - `others.count` → Use `others.length` instead\n  - `others.toArray()` → Use `others` instead (it’s already an array)\n- Deprecated the `Others<P, U>` type → Use `readonly User<P, U>[]` instead.\n\n## `@liveblocks/react`\n\n- Add support for Comments.\n- `UserMeta[\"info\"]` can no longer be a scalar value.\n\n## `@liveblocks/react-comments`\n\n- Initial release.\n\n## `@liveblocks/node`\n\n- Add Comments helpers to Client.\n- Add Comments webhook events.\n\n# v1.2.4\n\n## `@liveblocks/node`\n\n- Fixes a bug where sending an empty (or non-string) user ID with\n  `.identifyUser` would confusingly get reported as an HTTP 503.\n\n# v1.2.3\n\n## `@liveblocks/client`\n\n- Improve configuration error messages to be more user friendly.\n- Fix bug where entering a new room could potentially initialize the undo stack\n  incorrectly.\n\n## `create-liveblocks-app`\n\n- Fix Suspense option when specifying a framework.\n- Add helpful comments by default.\n\n# v1.2.2\n\n## `@liveblocks/node`\n\n- Add Yjs document change event (`YDocUpdatedEvent`) to `WebhookHandler`.\n- Allow `Header` object to be passed to `headers` in\n  `WebhookHandler.verifyRequest()`\n\n# v1.2.1\n\n## `@liveblocks/node`\n\n- Fix session.allow to support path up to 128 characters to meet room id length\n  requirement.\n\n# v1.2.0\n\n## `@liveblocks/*`\n\n- Support the new and improved Liveblocks authorization.\n- Change client logic to stop retrying if room is full. Instead, the client will\n  now disconnect. To retry, call `room.reconnect()` explicitly.\n\n## `@liveblocks/node`\n\n- Add new APIs for authorization. See our migration guide for tips on how to\n  adopt the new style of authorizing your Liveblocks clients.\n\n# v1.1.8\n\n- Fix a small TypeScript issue introduced in 1.1.7.\n\n# v1.1.7\n\n## `@liveblocks/client`\n\n- When initializing the client with a\n  [custom auth callback](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#createClientCallback),\n  you can now return `{ error: \"forbidden\", reason: ... }` as the response,\n  which the client will treat as a sign to stop retrying. The client will then\n  disconnect from the room, instead of remaining in `\"connecting\"` status\n  indefinitely.\n\n## `@liveblocks/react`\n\n- Fix a bug with `useSelf()` where it would not correctly re-render after\n  entering an empty room. It’s now consistent again with `useMyPresence()`.\n\n## DevTools\n\n- Fix a bug in the Liveblocks [DevTools](https://liveblocks.io/devtools) panel\n  where the \"me\" view would incorrectly stay empty after entering an empty room.\n\n# v1.1.6\n\n## `@liveblocks/*`\n\n- Loosen duplicate import detection so it won't throw when used in test runners\n  that deliberately run multiple instances of a module (like Jest or Playwright\n  can do).\n\n# v1.1.5\n\n## `@liveblocks/*`\n\n- Ship all of our packages as both ESM and CJS modules again (restore the\n  changes that 1.1.3 originally introduced).\n- Auto-detect if multiple copies of Liveblocks are included in your production\n  bundle. If so, a help page is presented that will help you resolve this issue.\n- Fix a bug where the room internals could become non-functional when used in\n  combination with Immer due to Immer’s excessive auto-freezing, which would\n  break the room’s internals. (This became an issue since Liveblocks 1.1 was\n  released.)\n\n# v1.1.4\n\n- Undo the changes made in 1.1.3. We’ve got some bug reports where Liveblocks\n  could still be doubly-included in production bundles (in some bundler setups\n  only), with storage data corruptions as a possible result. We’re\n  investigating.\n\n# v1.1.3\n\nShip all of our packages as both ESM and CJS modules. By upgrading, your\nproject’s bundler can now perform (better) tree-shaking on the Liveblocks code.\n\nYou can expect (at least) the following bundle size reductions:\n\n- `@liveblocks/client` from 80kB → 70kB\n- `@liveblocks/react` from 129kB → 80kB\n- `@liveblocks/redux` from 84kB → 38kB\n- `@liveblocks/zustand` from 83kB → 37kB\n- `@liveblocks/yjs` from 129kB → 74kB\n\n# v1.1.2\n\n## `@liveblocks/yjs`\n\nAdded Yjs support to **open beta** through the new `@liveblocks/yjs` package\n(not stable yet).\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Fixes a missing internal export.\n\n# v1.1.1\n\n- Fixes a bug where under certain circumstances the Liveblocks client could\n  incorrectly throw a `Not started yet` error message.\n\n# v1.1.0\n\nThis release improves the client’s internals to ensure a more reliable\nconnection with Liveblocks servers.\n\n## `@liveblocks/client`\n\n- New APIs:\n  - `room.getStatus()`: returns the current status of the WebSocket connection:\n    `\"initial\"`, `\"connecting\"`, `\"connected\"`, `\"reconnecting\"`, or\n    `\"disconnected\"`\n  - `room.subscribe(\"status\")`: subscribe to changes of the connection status.\n  - `room.subscribe(\"lost-connection\")`: high-level API to get informed when\n    Liveblocks’ automatic reconnection process is taking longer than usual, so\n    you can show a toast message on screen. (See this\n    [example](https://liveblocks.io/examples/connection-status) for an\n    illustration.)\n- New behavior:\n  - The client will stop retrying to establish a connection in cases where\n    retrying would not help. For example an explicit 403 forbidden response from\n    your backend, or a configuration error.\n  - The client will more quickly reconnect even after long periods of sleep.\n\n## `@liveblocks/react`\n\n- New APIs:\n  - `useStatus()` - React hook version of `room.getStatus()`\n  - `useLostConnectionListener()` - React hook version of\n    `room.subscribe(\"lost-connection\")` (See this\n    [example](https://liveblocks.io/examples/connection-status) for an\n    illustration.)\n\n### Bugs fixed\n\n- Reconnection would sometimes not work after long periods of sleep. Waking up\n  is now instant.\n- React clients using Suspense could sometimes incorrectly bounce back to the\n  Suspense boundary after a successful load. No longer!\n- Client could sometimes not load storage after reconnecting. Not anymore!\n- Others array will no longer flash during an internal reconnect.\n- DevTools now keeps working even when the client goes offline.\n\n### Deprecated APIs\n\nThese APIs still work, but are replaced by newer APIs. The old APIs will be\nremoved in a future release of Liveblocks.\n\nOld connection status codes are replaced by the new ones:\n\n| ❌ Old statuses | ✅ New statuses |\n| --------------- | --------------- |\n| closed          | initial         |\n| authenticating  | connecting      |\n| connecting      | connecting      |\n| open            | connected       |\n| unavailable     | reconnecting    |\n| failed          | disconnected    |\n\nRecommended steps to upgrade:\n\n- ❌ `room.getConnectionState()` → ✅ `room.getStatus()`\n- ❌ `room.subscribe('connection')` → ✅ `room.subscribe('status')`\n- Old client options:\n  - ❌ `clientOptions.fetchPolyfill`\n  - ❌ `clientOptions.WebSocketPolyfill` → ✅\n    `clientOptions.polyfills: { fetch, WebSocket }`\n\n# v1.0.12\n\n## `create-liveblocks-app`\n\n- Added `export type TypedRoom = Room<...>` to init command for non-React apps.\n\n# v1.0.11\n\n## `@liveblocks/client`\n\n- Fix a bug where undo/redo on `LiveObject` creates exponentially larger deltas.\n\n# v1.0.10\n\n## `@liveblocks/client`\n\n- Fix a bug related to proactive token expiration detection.\n- Internal refactorings.\n- Add unstable_fallbackToHTTP option to the core client to support messages over\n  1MB.\n\n## `@liveblocks/node`\n\n- Fix incorrect status code when Liveblocks server cannot be reached\n  temporarily.\n\n# v1.0.9\n\n## `@liveblocks/client`\n\n- Export `LiveListUpdate`, `LiveMapUpdate`, and `LiveObjectUpdate` types used by\n  the storage update callback.\n- Export new utility, `toPlainLson`, to assist in calling the initialize storage\n  API.\n- Internal refactorings.\n\n# v1.0.8\n\n## `@liveblocks/client`\n\n- Internal refactorings.\n\n## `create-liveblocks-app`\n\n- Added\n  [flags](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/tree/main/tools/create-liveblocks-app#flags-optional)\n  for creating config files with `--init`. (e.g. `--framework react`)\n- Added an error if an incorrect flag is used.\n- Slightly changed the format of the default config file.\n\n## `@liveblocks/client`\n\n- Internal refactorings.\n\n# v1.0.7\n\n- Private API changes only.\n\n# v1.0.6\n\n## Internal changes\n\n- Release `create-liveblocks-app` along with other Liveblocks packages, using\n  the same versioning scheme.\n- Internal refactorings.\n\n# v1.0.5\n\nNon-existent.\n\n# v1.0.4\n\nNon-existent.\n\n# v1.0.3\n\nNon-existent.\n\n# v1.0.2\n\n- Fix bug where passing down `shouldInitiallyConnect` connection option would\n  not always work.\n\n# v1.0.1\n\n- Log stack traces of function calls that resulted in rejected storage mutations\n  to the console in non-production builds to ease debugging.\n\n## `@liveblocks/client`\n\n- Fixes bug where the state of `others` in a room was wrong when:\n  - Client A disconnects improperly (ex: computer goes to sleep)\n  - Then Client B disconnects (ex: computer goes to sleep)\n  - Then Client A reconnects: client B still shows in the `others` state\n\n# v1.0.0\n\nThis major release marks the maturity of Liveblocks. For upgrade instructions,\nsee the [1.0 upgrade guide](https://liveblocks.io/docs/platform/upgrading/1.0).\n\n## `@liveblocks/node`\n\n`authorize` option `userId` is now mandatory.\n\nOur new [pricing](https://liveblocks.io/pricing) is based on Monthly Active\nUsers instead of connections. We're using `userId` to track MAU associated to a\nLiveblocks account.\n\n# v0.19.11\n\n## `@liveblocks/node`\n\n- `WebhookHandler` now handles `RoomCreatedEvent` and `RoomDeletedEvent`\n\n# v0.19.10\n\n## `@liveblocks/client`\n\n- Allow\n  [`createClient`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#createClientThrottle)\n  `throttle` option to go as low as 16ms.\n\n# v0.19.9\n\n## `@liveblocks/client`\n\n- Adds a `WebhookHandler` class\n  - `new WebhookHandler(secret).verifyRequest({ rawBody, headers })` can be used\n    to verify event requests from Liveblock's webhook functionality. It also\n    provides fully typed `WebhookEvents`.\n  - Check out our [Webhooks guide](https://liveblocks.io/docs/guides/webhooks)\n    for more details\n\n# v0.19.8\n\n- Fixes a bug where history didn't reliably undo `LiveObject` key set changes if\n  any pending local changes existed on that key.\n- Fixes a bug where changes performed inside `room.batch` were incorrectly\n  ordered inside the history resulting in unexpected undo behavior in some\n  cases.\n- Fixes a bug where under some circumstances the Liveblocks client could get\n  stuck in a \"synchronizing\" state indefinitely\n- Expose `JsonArray` and `JsonScalar` types publicly\n\n# v0.19.7\n\nFix nested storage event handling issue.\n\n# v0.19.6\n\nSupport authentication with cookies.\n\n# v0.19.5\n\nExport the `StorageStatus` type (introduced with 0.19.3).\n\n# v0.19.4\n\nFix CORS issue.\n\n# v0.19.3\n\nIn **@liveblocks/client**:\n\n## Room.getStorageStatus\n\nGet the storage status.\n\n- `not-loaded`: Initial state when entering the room.\n- `loading`: Once the storage has been requested via room.getStorage().\n- `synchronizing`: When some local updates have not been acknowledged by\n  Liveblocks servers.\n- `synchronized`: Storage is in sync with Liveblocks servers.\n\n## Room.subscribe(\"storage-status\", status => { })\n\nSubscribe to storage status changes.\n\nReturns an unsubscribe function.\n\n```typescript\nroom.subscribe(\"storage-status\", (status) => {\n  switch (status) {\n    case \"not-loaded\":\n      break;\n    case \"loading\":\n      break;\n    case \"synchronizing\":\n      break;\n    case \"synchronized\":\n      break;\n    default:\n      break;\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## Room.reconnect\n\nClose the room connection and try to reconnect.\n\n## Internal changes\n\n- Add support for the upcoming Liveblocks browser extension\n\n# v0.19.2\n\nFixes some internal type definitions.\n\n# v0.19.1\n\nFixes an issue where `import`s from Liveblocks packages could not be resolved\ncorrectly in certain build environments.\n\n# v0.19.0\n\nThis release brings Zustand v4 support. This is a breaking change **only if\nyou’re using @liveblocks/zustand**.\n\nIn **@liveblocks/zustand**:\n\n- Support Zustand v4 (actually v4.1.3 or higher)\n- Drop support for Zustand v3 (also v4.1.2 or lower are not supported)\n- Fix bug where some usage pattern could cause the Zustand store to stop\n  synching (#491)\n\nTo migrate, make the following code changes:\n\n- `npm install zustand@latest`\n- `npm install @liveblocks/zustand@latest`\n- Change these imports, if applicable:\n  ```diff\n  -import { middleware } from \"@liveblocks/zustand\";\n  +import { liveblocks } from \"@liveblocks/zustand\";\n  ```\n  and\n  ```diff\n  -import type { LiveblocksState } from \"@liveblocks/zustand\";\n  +import type { WithLiveblocks } from \"@liveblocks/zustand\";\n  ```\n  and rename accordingly.\n- Change the pattern:\n  ```ts\n  create(liveblocks<MyState, ...>(...))\n  ```\n  to the Zustand v4 recommended pattern:\n  ```ts\n  create<WithLiveblocks<MyState, ...>>()(liveblocks(...))\n  ```\n  To be clear:\n  1.  First, move the type annotation away from the `liveblocks` middleware\n      call, and onto the `create` call.\n  2.  Next, wrap your `MyState` type in a `WithLiveblocks<...>` wrapper. This\n      will make sure the injected `liveblocks` property on your Zustand state\n      will be correctly typed.\n  3.  Finally, make sure to add the extra call `()` wrapper, needed by Zustand\n      v4 now:\n      ```ts\n      create<WithLiveblocks<MyState, ...>>()(liveblocks(...))\n      //                                  ^^ Not a typo\n      ```\n- Remove the second argument to `state.liveblocks.enterRoom()`: it no longer\n  takes an explicit initial state. Instead, it's automatically be populated from\n  your Zustand state.\n\nIn **@liveblocks/redux**:\n\n- The main export has been renamed:\n  ```diff\n  -import { enhancer } from \"@liveblocks/redux\";\n  +import { liveblocksEnhancer } from \"@liveblocks/redux\";\n  ```\n- The second argument to `state.liveblocks.enterRoom()` to send in an explicit\n  initial state is no longer supported. It will use the state in your Redux\n  store, for consistency and ease of use.\n\n# v0.18.5\n\nBug fix:\n\n- Fixes a small bug in a type definition, `scopes` was removed from\n  `BaseUserMeta`.\n\nInternal updates:\n\n- Switch the monorepo over to Turborepo.\n\n# v0.18.4\n\nAll packages now provide an `isReadOnly` flag on user instances. It is available\nwhen getting self or others. `isReadOnly` is true when storage is read-only, see\nthe\n[room management guide](https://liveblocks.io/docs/guides/managing-rooms-users-permissions#permissions)\nfor more information.\n\n```ts\nconst me = room.getSelf();\n\nme.isReadOnly; // boolean\n\nconst others = room.getOthers();\nfor (const other of others) {\n  other.isReadOnly; // boolean\n}\n```\n\nIn **@liveblocks/client**:\n\n- Add a new option `shouldInitiallyConnect` to `client.enter` that let you\n  control whether or not the room connects to Liveblocks servers. Default is\n  `true`.\n\n  Usually set to false when the client is used from the server to not call the\n  authentication endpoint or connect via WebSocket.\n\nIn **@liveblocks/react**:\n\n- Add a new property `shouldInitiallyConnect` to `RoomProvider` that let you\n  control whether or not the room connects to Liveblocks servers. Default is\n  `true`.\n\n  By default equals to `typeof window !== \"undefined\"`, meaning the RoomProvider\n  tries to connect to Liveblocks servers only on the client side.\n\n- Internal package restructurings to increase code sharing. You may notice a new\n  dependency show up in your dependency tree: `@liveblocks/core`. It contains\n  private APIs that aren't intended for direct consumption.\n\n# v0.18.3\n\n- In **@liveblocks/react**:\n\n  Fixes the \"zombie-child\" problem that can occur with React 17 or lower. **If\n  you’re on React 18: great, you can ignore this!** If you’re using React 17 or\n  lower with Liveblocks, we’ll now start to enforce that you pass the\n  `unstable_batchedUpdates` prop to RoomProvider, so this problem can be\n  circumvented. This small addition may save you hours of debugging time!\n\n  ```tsx\n  // ⚠️  Only if you’re using React 17 or lower\n  import { unstable_batchedUpdates } from \"react-dom\";  // 👈\n\n  <RoomProvider\n    id=\"my-room\"\n    initialPresence={...}\n    initialStorage={...}\n    unstable_batchedUpdates={unstable_batchedUpdates}  // 👈\n  >\n    <App />\n  </RoomProvider>\n  ```\n\n  To read more, see\n  https://liveblocks.io/docs/guides/troubleshooting#stale-props-zombie-child\n\n- In **@liveblocks/zustand**:\n\n  - Fix a confusing error message\n\n# v0.18.2\n\n- In **@liveblocks/react**:\n\n  - Make sure that `useOther` will not rerender if tracked users already left\n    the room, so that child components won't get rerendered before the parent\n    got the chance to unmount them.\n  - Disallow `useOther` without selector\n\n# v0.18.1\n\n- In **@liveblocks/react**:\n\n  - Fix a bug that could cause an error when patching presence during local\n    development. Not an issue in production builds. (#505)\n\n# v0.18.0\n\nFor information, please read our\n[Upgrade Guide for 0.18](https://liveblocks.io/docs/platform/upgrading/0.18).\n\n## New React hooks ✨\n\n- In **@liveblocks/react**:\n\n  - [`useStorage`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useStorage)\n  - [`useMutation`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useMutation)\n  - [`useSelf`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useSelf)\n  - [`useOthers`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useOthers)\n  - [`useOthersMapped`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useOthersMapped)\n  - [`useOthersConnectionIds`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useOthersConnectionIds)\n  - [`useOther`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#useOther)\n    (singular)\n\n- In **@liveblocks/client**:\n\n  - New\n    [`.toImmutable()`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#LiveObject.toImmutable)\n    method on `LiveObject`, `LiveList`, and `LiveMap` lets you work with an\n    immutable representation of the storage objects\n  - Improved core performance\n  - Reduced bundle size\n  - Others only become visible in the `others` array if their presence is known\n\n## Breaking changes\n\n- Remove support for directly importing hooks from **@liveblocks/client** (e.g.\n  `import { useMyPresence } from '@liveblocks/react'`). If you’re still using\n  these imports, see the\n  [Upgrade Guide for 0.17](https://liveblocks.io/docs/platform/upgrading/0.17)\n  for instructions.\n- Remove `ClientProvider` and `useClient` hook\n- Remove `defaultPresence` and `defaultStorageRoot` arguments. (Just use\n  `initialPresence` and `initialStorage` arguments now.)\n- Remove second argument to `useMap()`, `useList()`, and `useObject()`.\n- Remove `new LiveMap(null)` support. (Just use `new LiveMap()` or\n  `new LiveMap([])`.)\n\n# v0.17.11\n\nGeneral:\n\n- Fix a packaging bug\n\nIn **@liveblocks/react**:\n\n- Deprecate an undocumented API\n\n# v0.17.9\n\n- Fix bug that could cause duplicate copies of @liveblocks/client to end up in\n  final bundle, for certain bundler configurations.\n- Fix bug where in some conditions the initial presence for a new connection\n  would not come through to all existing clients in the room\n- Various internal changes\n\n# v0.17.8\n\n## New history APIs ↩️ ↪️\n\n- In **@liveblocks/client**:\n\n  - Add `canUndo()` and `canRedo()` utilities to `room.history`\n  - Add `\"history\"` event type to `room.subscribe()` to subscribe to the current\n    user's history changes\n\n- In **@liveblocks/react**:\n\n  - Add `useCanUndo()` and `useCanRedo()` hooks\n\n# v0.17.7\n\n- In **@liveblocks/zustand**:\n\n  - Simplify zustand middleware integration with Typescript. `TPresence`,\n    `TStorage`, `TUserMeta`, and `TRoomEvent` are now optional.\n\nNote that `@liveblocks/zustand` does not work with zustand > v4 because v3 and\nv4 have completely different type definitions. As soon as zustand v4 is out of\nthe RC phase, we will consider updating our middleware to work with the latest\nversion.\n\n### Example\n\nLet's take a look at our\n[To-do list](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/tree/main/examples/zustand-todo-list)\nexample. Without our middleware, the store would look like this:\n\n```ts\nimport create from \"zustand\";\n\ntype State = {\n  draft: string;\n  isTyping: boolean;\n  todos: Todo[];\n  setDraft: (draft: string) => void;\n  addTodo: () => void;\n  deleteTodo: (index: number) => void;\n};\n\ncreate<State>(/* ... */);\n```\n\nWith our middleware, you simply need to move the `State` param at the middleware\nlevel:\n\n```ts\nimport create from \"zustand\";\nimport { createClient } from \"@liveblocks/client\";\nimport { middleware } from \"@liveblocks/zustand\";\n\nconst client = createClient({ /*...*/ });\n\ntype State = {\n  draft: string;\n  isTyping: boolean;\n  todos: Todo[];\n  setDraft: (draft: string) => void;\n  addTodo: () => void;\n  deleteTodo: (index: number) => void;\n};\n\ncreate(\n  middleware<State>(/* ... */, {\n    client,\n    presenceMapping: { isTyping: true },\n    storageMapping: { todos: true }\n  })\n);\n```\n\nIf you want to type `others` presence, you can use the `TPresence` generic\nargument on the middleware.\n\n```ts\n\ntype Presence = {\n  isTyping: true;\n}\n\nconst useStore = create(\n  middleware<State, Presence>(/* ... */, {\n    client,\n    presenceMapping: { isTyping: true },\n    storageMapping: { todos: true }\n  })\n);\n\n// In your component\nuseStore(state => state.liveblocks.others[0].presence?.isTyping)\n```\n\n# v0.17.6\n\n- In **@liveblocks/react**:\n\n  - Expose `RoomContext` in the return value of `createRoomContext()`\n\n# v0.17.5\n\n- In **@liveblocks/react**:\n\n  - Fix bug where changing the `key` argument of `useMap()`, `useList()`,\n    `useObject()` did not resubscribe to updates correctly\n  - Ignore changes to the `RoomProvider`'s initial presence/storage props on\n    subsequent renders. This makes it behave closer to `useState(initialState)`\n\n# v0.17.4\n\nFix missing documentation for hooks created via `createRoomContext()`.\n\n# v0.17.1\n\nFix `@liveblocks/nodes` packaging.\n\n# v0.17.0\n\nFor information, please read our\n[Upgrade Guide](https://liveblocks.io/docs/platform/upgrading/0.17).\n\n## TypeScript improvements ✨\n\nThis release contains major TypeScript improvements. The recommended setup now\nis that you define your own Presence and Storage types at the highest level\n(i.e. where you set up the room). After that initial one-time setup, you will no\nlonger need to provide any extra type annotations anywhere for your Liveblocks\ncode! 🙌\n\nTo learn how to set that up, follow the instructions in our\n[Upgrade Guide](https://liveblocks.io/docs/platform/upgrading/0.17).\n\n- No more `any` types used (in `@liveblocks/client` and `@liveblocks/react`)\n- All APIs that work with Presence data will now require it to be\n  JSON-serializable\n- All APIs that work with Storage data will now require it to be LSON (= JSON +\n  Live structures)\n- All Live structures now take mandatory type params for their payloads, just\n  like the built-in array, object, and map types do:\n  - `LiveMap<K, V>` (like `Map<K, V>`)\n  - `LiveObject<{ a: number, b: string }>` (like, for example,\n    `{ a: number, b: string }`)\n  - `LiveList<T>` (like `Array<T>`)\n\n## React Native support ✨\n\nWe now support React Native! To learn how to use Liveblocks in your React Native\nprojects, see our\n[API reference](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-client#createClientReactNative).\nIt's surprisingly simple!\n\n## New APIs ✨\n\n- In **@liveblocks/react**:\n\n  - [`createRoomContext()`](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/liveblocks-react#createRoomContext)\n    is now the preferred way to initialize hooks.\n\n- In the API:\n\n  - New endpoint to\n    [Get Users in a Room](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#GetRoomUsers)\n  - New endpoint to\n    [Get a list of all Rooms](https://liveblocks.io/docs/api-reference/rest-api-endpoints#GetRooms)\n\n## Bug fixes 🐛\n\n- Improved conflict resolution on LiveList\n- Various minor internal bug fixes\n\n## Breaking changes\n\n- In **@liveblocks/client**:\n\n  - Removed old `Room.unsubscribe()` API\n\n## New deprecations\n\n- In **@liveblocks/client**:\n\n  - The `defaultPresence` option to `client.enter()` will get renamed to\n    `initialPresence`\n  - The `defaultStorageRoot` option to `client.enter()` will get renamed to\n    `initialStorage`\n  - Calling `new LiveMap(null)` will stop working. Please use `new LiveMap()`,\n    or `new LiveMap([])`\n\n- In **@liveblocks/react**:\n\n  - Importing the React hooks directly is deprecated, instead use the new\n    `createRoomContext()` helper. For help, read the\n    [Recommended Upgrade Steps section](https://liveblocks.io/docs/platform/upgrading/0.17#recommended-upgrade-steps)\n    within our\n    [Upgrade Guide](https://liveblocks.io/docs/platform/upgrading/0.17)\n  - The second argument to `useList()`, `useObject()`, and `useMap()` is\n    deprecated\n  - The RoomProvider's `defaultPresence` is renamed to `initialPresence`\n  - The RoomProvider's `defaultStorageRoot` is renamed to `initialStorage`\n\n# v0.16.17\n\nFix bug in internal code where some legal authentication tokens would be\nconsidered invalid.\n\n# v0.16.16\n\nInternals only.\n\n# v0.16.15\n\nInternals only.\n\n# v0.16.14\n\nFix an issue where the current user's info would not properly display accented\ncharacters.\n\n# v0.16.13\n\n(Unpublished.)\n\n# v0.16.12\n\nInternals only.\n\n# v0.16.11\n\nExpose helper type to help users adopt to using Live structures with interfaces\nthey don't own.\n\n# v0.16.10\n\nRestructures a few more internals.\n\n# v0.16.9\n\nRestructures a few internals.\n\n# v0.16.8\n\nFix bug in private/internal code.\n\n# v0.16.7\n\nFix bug in private/internal code.\n\n# v0.16.6\n\nFix bug in example code suggested in deprecation warning.\n\n# v0.16.5\n\n## All packages\n\n- Various internal refactorings\n\n## Bug fixes\n\n- In **@liveblocks/client**:\n\n  - If you're using `@liveblocks/client` in a ES2015 context, you no longer have\n    to polyfill `Object.fromEntries()`.\n\n# v0.16.4\n\n## All packages\n\n- Improve our generated bundles. They are now even more tree-shakable, and\n  smaller!\n- Some APIs are being deprecation and will show warnings in the dev console when\n  used\n\n# v0.16.3\n\n## Bug fixes\n\n- In **@liveblocks/client**:\n\n  - Fix bug where internal presence state could not get restored correctly after\n    undo/redo in certain circumstances.\n\n- In **@liveblocks/zustand** and **@liveblocks/redux**:\n\n  - Fixes an issue when initializing an array with items would result in having\n    duplicated items in other clients. Example:\n\n    - Client A updates state : `{ list: [0] }`\n    - Client B states is updated to : `{ list: [0, 0] }`\n\n# v0.16.2\n\n## Bug fixes\n\n- In **@liveblocks/client**:\n\n  - Fix small bug related to new `JsonObject` type, which would reject some\n    values that were legal JSON objects.\n\n# v0.16.1\n\n## Bug fixes\n\n- In **@liveblocks/react**:\n\n  - Fix issue with React 18 and StrictMode.\n\n# v0.16.0\n\n## New APIs\n\n### `LiveList.set`\n\nSet one element at a specified index.\n\n```typescript\nconst list = new LiveList([\"🦁\", \"🦊\", \"🐵\"]);\nlist.set(0, \"🐺\");\nlist.toArray(); // equals [\"🐺\", \"🦊\", \"🐵\"]\n```\n\nhttps://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/pull/147 for more information\n\n⚠️ **_Before using `LiveList.set`, you need to make sure that all connected\nclients are using `0.16.0`. If a client is connected to a room with version\n`< 0.16`, `LiveList.set` might lead to slightly unexpected behavior._**\n\n## TypeScript improvements\n\n@nvie improved our typescript definitions! They are more precise and restrictive\n(for your own good :)). If typescript errors appears after upgrading to `0.16.0`\nand they are not clear, please create a Github issue and we'll help you.\n\nMore information here: https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/pull/150\n"

We're excited to have you as a contributor.\n\n## Documentation and examples\n\nAfter making a change to documentation or examples, record your change:\n\n1. Look in [pull requests](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/pulls) for\n   the CHANGELOG PR\n2. Click the link in the PR, add your changes into the file and save\n\n## Releasing\n\nPackages are published on the [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/). Each\nrelease is associated to a github tag.\n\nA version is composed of three numbers: `X.Y.Z` where `X` is the major version,\n`Y` is the minor version and `Z` is the patch version.\n\nA tag is a label that is applied to a version. It can be used to identify a\nversion as a beta, or other version.\n\nCombined together, a version and a tag can be used to identify a package\nrelease.\n\nExample:\n\n- `v1.0.0` is the first release of the `1.0.0` version.\n- `v1.0.0-beta1` is the first `beta` release of the `1.0.0` version.\n\nWe have some rules in place to make sure that the version numbers and tags are\ncorrect.\n\n### Publishing packages\n\nPublishing packages is done by running the\n[**Publish packages**](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/actions/workflows/publish-packages.yml)\nworkflow.\n\n1. Run the workflow with the appropriate git tag.\n2. Validate that the workflow published the packages to the npm registry.\n\nTo run a release in github (for `main` and `beta` branches):\n\n3. Create a new release on github using the URL provided at the end of the\n   workflow.\n4. Add the release notes\n5. Update CHANGELOG.md\n\nNext, add changes to the public changelog:\n\n6. Look in [pull requests](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/pulls) for\n   the CHANGELOG PR\n7. Click the link in the PR, paste your release note changes into the file and\n   save\n\n### Latest releases\n\nLatest releases are stable and production ready.\n\nWe release packages under the `latest` npm tag using the following format:\n\n- github tag: `vX.Y.Z`\n- version: `X.Y.Z`\n- npm tag: `latest`\n\nLatest releases are only published from the `main` branch.\n\n### Beta releases\n\nBeta releases are near-stable and close to production ready.\n\nWe release packages under the `beta` npm tag using the following format:\n\n- github tag: `vX.Y.Z-betaN`\n- version: `X.Y.Z-betaN`\n- npm tag: `beta`\n\nBeta releases are only published from the `beta` branch.\n\n### Other releases\n\nOther releases are not stable and not production ready.\n\nWe release packages under the desired npm tag using the following format:\n\n- github tag: `vX.Y.Z-<tag>N`\n- version: `X.Y.Z-<tag>N`\n- npm tag: `<tag>`\n\nOther releases are published from any branch.\n"
