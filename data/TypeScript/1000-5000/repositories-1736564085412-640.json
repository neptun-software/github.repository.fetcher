          "content": "# Contributing\n\nWe want this community to be friendly and respectful to each other. Please follow it in all your interactions with the project.\n\n## Development workflow\n\nTo get started with the project, run `yarn` in the root directory to install the required dependencies for each package:\n\n```bash\nyarn\n```\n\n### Example app\n\n> While it's possible to use [`npm`](https://github.com/npm/cli), the tooling is built around [`yarn`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/), so you'll have an easier time if you use `yarn` for development.\n\nWhile developing, you can run the [example app](/IapExample/) to test your changes. Any changes you make in your library's JavaScript code will be reflected in the example app without a rebuild. If you change any native code, then you'll need to rebuild the example app.\n\n```bash\ncd IapExample\nyarn #install dependencies\n```\n\nTo start the packager:\n\n```bash\nyarn  start\n```\n\nTo run the example app on Android:\n\n```bash\nyarn android:play\n```\n\nor\n\n```bash\nyarn android:amazon\n```\n\nTo run the example app on iOS:\n\n```bash\nyarn ios\n```\n\n### Editing native code\n\nTo edit the Objective-C files, open `IapExample/ios/IapExample.xcworkspace` in XCode and find the source files at `Pods > Development Pods > RNIap`.\n\nTo edit the Kotlin files, open `IapExample/android` in Android studio and find the source files at `RNIap` under `Android`.\n\n### Commit message convention\n\nWe follow the [conventional commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en) for our commit messages:\n\n- `fix`: bug fixes, e.g. fix crash due to deprecated method.\n- `feat`: new features, e.g. add new method to the module.\n- `refactor`: code refactor, e.g. migrate from class components to hooks.\n- `docs`: changes into documentation, e.g. add usage example for the module..\n- `test`: adding or updating tests, e.g. add integration tests using detox.\n- `chore`: tooling changes, e.g. change CI config.\n\nOur pre-commit hooks verify that your commit message matches this format when committing.\n\n### Linting and tests\n\n[ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)\n\nWe use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type checking, [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for linting and formatting the code, and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing.\n\nOur pre-commit hooks verify that the linter and tests pass when committing.\n\nIn root directory. Make sure your code passes TypeScript and ESLint. Run the following to verify:\n\n```bash\nyarn lint\n```\n\nTo fix formatting errors, run the following:\n\n```bash\nyarn lint --fix\n```\n\nTo fix formatting errors in `swift` files:\n\n- prerequisity: on your Mac install [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint)\n\n```bash\nyarn lint:swift\n```\n\nRemember to add tests for your change if possible. Run the unit tests by:\n\n```bash\nyarn test\n```\n\n### Publishing to npm\n\nWe use [release-it](https://github.com/release-it/release-it) to make it easier to publish new versions. It handles common tasks like bumping version based on semver, creating tags and releases etc.\n\nTo publish new versions, run the following:\n\n```bash\nyarn release\n```\n\n### Scripts\n\nThe [package.json](package.json) file contains various scripts for common tasks:\n\n- `yarn bootstrap`: setup project by installing all dependencies and pods.\n- `yarn typescript`: type-check files with TypeScript.\n- `yarn lint`: lint files with ESLint.\n- `yarn test`: run unit tests with Jest.\n\nThe [IapExample/package.json](IapExample/package.json) file contains various scripts for common tasks with example app:\n\n### Sending a pull request\n\n> **Working on your first pull request?** You can learn how from this _free_ series: [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://app.egghead.io/playlists/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).\n\nWhen you're sending a pull request:\n\n- Prefer small pull requests focused on one change.\n- Verify that linters and tests are passing.\n- Review the documentation to make sure it looks good.\n- Follow the pull request template when opening a pull request.\n- For pull requests that change the API or implementation, discuss with maintainers first by opening an issue.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\n### Our Pledge\n\nWe as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.\n\nWe pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.\n\n### Our Standards\n\nExamples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:\n\n- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people\n- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences\n- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback\n- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience\n- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community\n\nExamples of unacceptable behavior include:\n\n- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or\n  advances of any kind\n- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks\n- Public or private harassment\n- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email\n  address, without their explicit permission\n- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a\n  professional setting\n\n### Enforcement Responsibilities\n\nCommunity leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.\n\nCommunity leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.\n\n### Scope\n\nThis Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.\n\n### Enforcement\n\nInstances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [INSERT CONTACT METHOD]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.\n\nAll community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.\n\n### Enforcement Guidelines\n\nCommunity leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:\n\n#### 1. Correction\n\n**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.\n\n**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.\n\n#### 2. Warning\n\n**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.\n\n**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.\n\n#### 3. Temporary Ban\n\n**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.\n\n**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.\n\n#### 4. Permanent Ban\n\n**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.\n\n**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.\n\n### Attribution\n\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage], version 2.0,\navailable at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html.\n\nCommunity Impact Guidelines were inspired by [Mozilla's code of conduct enforcement ladder](https://github.com/mozilla/diversity).\n\n[homepage]: https://www.contributor-covenant.org\n\nFor answers to common questions about this code of conduct, see the FAQ at\nhttps://www.contributor-covenant.org/faq.

See the [troubleshooting](https://react-native-iap.hyo.dev/docs/guides/troubleshooting#common-issues) for the common issues to avoid.\n\n## Logs\n\n- Version `12.0.0`: Implements Amazon 3.x SDK including the new DRM verification.\n\n- Version `11.0.0`: The module migrates OS sdk to [storekit2](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10114). [andresesfm](https://github.com/andresesfm) is working hard on this.\n\n  ```\n  yarn add react-native-iap@next\n  ```\n\n- Version `10.0.0` is a maintenance build. Many internal refactorings and clean up of the code. Special thanks to [jeremybarbet](https://github.com/jeremybarbet) for his contributions. Most notably all methods now take an object parameter instead of separate parameters. Please help us test\n\n- Version `9.0.0` The module migrates android sdk to [play billing library v5](https://qonversion.io/blog/google-play-billing-library-5-0). Our core maintainers [andresesfm](https://github.com/andresesfm) and [jeremybarbet](https://github.com/jeremybarbet) worked hard on this.\n\n- Version `8.0.0` has finally landed in Jan 28th. Since this is early release, please use it with caution 🚧. We recommend user to use `>=8.0.0` with react-native `>=0.65.1`. The `next` package is no longer updated until we organize the roadmap for `9.0.0`.\n\n- Version `8.0.0` is currently in release candidate. The module is completely rewritten with `Kotlin` and `Swift` for maintenenance issue by [andresesfm](https://github.com/andresesfm) 🔆. You may install this for early preview.\n\n- React Native IAP hook is out. You can see [medium post](https://medium.com/hyochan/announcing-react-native-iap-hooks-96c7ffd3f19a) on how to use it.\n\n- The `react-native-iap` module hasn't been maintained well recently. We are thinking of participating again and make the module healthier. Please refer to [2021 Maintenance plan](https://github.com/hyochan/react-native-iap/issues/1241) and share with us how you or your organization is using it. Happy new year 🎉\n\n  - The sample code is out in [crossplatformkorea/CPK/pull/12](https://github.com/crossplatformkorea/CPK/pull/12).
