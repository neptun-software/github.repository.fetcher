It bundles them together. The order of execution is first the generic hook then the one defined for the route specifically.\n\n## 8.1.1\n\nNo changes. Just refactoring.\n\n## 8.1.0\n\nBringing back the hash based routing.\n\n## 8.0.1\n\nA really minor update in the pseudo not-found route used internally.\n\n## 8.0.0\n\nThis is a complete re-write of the router. I decided to be a bad guy and kill/change some features. This is in favor of having cleaner code and I hope more stable implementation. The library was also doing bunch of assumptions for the root of your application which proved to be buggy and non-deterministic. So I'm removing this logic and asking you to set the root of your application.\n\n### Deprecations\n\n* ~Hash-based support for older browsers~ (it's back in 8.1.0 version)\n* `pause` and `resume`. There is `shouldResolve` in the `navigate` method instead.\n* `historyAPIUpdateMethod` method. It's now an option of the `navigate` method.\n* `helpers` method\n* `disableIfAPINotAvailable` method\n\n### New features\n\n* The `navigate` method now accepts options as a second argument which are there to cover more use cases.\n* There is `data-navigo-options` HTML attributes for your links so you can pass options to the `navigate` method.\n\n### Migration guide\n\n* Change the initialization of the router to accept a single argument - the root of your application.\n* Checkout your handlers if they read data from a parameterized URL or a GET param. If so make sure that they get the data from the single object passed to the function (an object of type `Match`)\n  ```js\n  type Match = {\n    url: string;\n    queryString: string;\n    route: Route;\n    data: Object | null; // data coming in the URL\n    params: Object | null; // data coming in the query string\n  };\n  ```\n  where `Route` is\n  ```js\n  type Route = {\n    path: string;\n    handler: Function;\n    hooks: RouteHooks;\n  };\n  ```\n* If you are using `historyAPIUpdateMethod` you'll need to pass a `historyAPIMethod` field to the options of navigate. For example:\n  ```js\n  router.navigate('/foo/bar', { historyAPIMethod: 'replaceState' })\n  ```\n* I hope you didn't use `router.helpers` but if you do explore the alternatives:\n  ```js\n  router.match -> router._matchRoute\n  router.root -> router.root\n  router.clean -> router._clean\n  router.getOnlyURL -> router.extractGETParameters\n  ```\n* If you used the `pause` and `resume` methods you have to migrate your app to use `shouldResolve` param of the `navigate` method. Or in other words when navigating to define whether you want to have route handling or not. Example:\n  ```js\n  router.navigate('/foo/bar', { shouldResolve: false });\n  ```\n* `lastRouteResolved` becomes `lastResolved` and it returns an object of type `Match`. Checkout above. (or `null` if there is no resolved URL so far)\n\n## 7.1.3\n\nThis version just adds a the following warning to the library:\n```\nconsole.warn(\"Navigo router library will have soon a major upgrade to version 8.0.0. If you don't have time for such migration please stick with the latest 7.1.2 version. To avoid seeing this message set a strict 7.1.2 in your package.json file.\");\n```\n\n## 7.1.2\n\nOpen in new tab when Ctrl-key is pressed (#199)\n\n## 7.0.0\n\nFixing the behavior of the hooks #182 #174\n\n## 6.0.2\n\nMake sure that the `leave` hook receives the URL params.\n\n## 6.0.1\n\nunpkg as CDN.\n\n## 6.0.0\n\nWhen using a `data-navigo` links we now read from the `href` attribute only. The router is not using `pathname` anymore. I again got the pros and cons of both approaches and I see that using `pathname` actually does not make a lot of sense now.\n\n## 5.3.3\n\nResolving the route when we use hash based URL and have no dynamic route [#162](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo/issues/162)\n\n## 5.3.2\n\nFixing the behavior of `getOnlyURL` function.\n\n## 5.3.1\n\nThe `lastRouteResolved` now returns a `name` property for the [named routes](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo#named-routes).\n\n## 5.3.0\n\nAdding a new API method `historyAPIUpdateMethod`.\n\n## 5.2.0\n\nSending matched route parameters to the general hooks. [#137](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo/issues/137)\n\n## 5.1.0\n\nAdding `already` hook. [#136](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo/issues/136)\n\n## 5.0.2\n\nGood call by [Daniel Bernhard](https://github.com/huevoncito) that my updates on the `clear` method actually breaks the links with `data-navigo`. This release fixes that.\n\n## 5.0.1\n\nIt looks like calling History push or replace state doesn't trigger a popstate event. So we indeed have to call `resolve`. This version fixes that and `navigate` works again.\n\n## 5.0.0\n\nIssue [#128](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo/issues/128) made me rethink how Navigo handles routes. The route matching is based on regular expressions and one of them was not quite ok. That's now fixed as part of this latest release. However, these updates change how Navigo uses the registered routes so it may break your app.\n\n## 4.8.0\n\n* Adding generic hooks + leave hook [#107](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo/issues/107).\n\n## 4.7.4\n\n* Clear the `navigate` method. It is not calling `resolve` automatically. Related to [#115](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo/issues/115).\n\n## 4.7.3\n\n* Making sure that `generate` doesn't fail if there's a regex as a route [#125](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo/issues/125)\n\n## 4.7.2\n\n* Proper handling of the encoded URL parameter [#116](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo/issues/116)\n\n## 4.7.1\n\n* Fixing the bug described in [#122](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo/issues/122)\n\n## 4.7.0\n\n* Adding `getLinkPath` function to cover [#120](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo/issues/120)\n\n## 4.6.2\n\n* Fixing a bug in IE9 [#110](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo/pull/110)\n\n## 4.6.1\n\n* Using relative URLs in navigation [#109](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo/issues/109)\n\n## 4.6.0\n\n* Parameters from the parameterized routes are sent to hooks' handlers [#108](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo/pull/108)\n\n## 4.5.2\n\n* Fixing a bug under IE9 [#104](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo/pull/104)\n\n## 4.5.1\n\n* A bug fix for [#96](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo/pull/96) which was about a proper extracting of the GET parameters\n\n## 4.5.0\n\n* Adding `lastRouteResolved` public API ([#101](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo/pull/101))\n\n## 4.4.0\n\n* Providing an API for case insensitive route handling ([#100](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo/pull/100))\n\n## 4.3.7\n\n* [#97](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo/pull/97) - similar to #95 we are now using `addEventListener` when listening for browser API events.\n\n## 4.3.6\n\n* [#95](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo/pull/95) - keeping the already defined handler of `onhashchange`\n\n## 4.3.4\n\n* A path because of the latest release. It covers the case where we are using a custom hash. [#92](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo/issues/92)\n>>>>>>> origin/master\n\n## 4.3.2, 4.3.3\n\n* Fixing [#87](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo/issues/87)\n\n## 4.3.1\n\n* Make sure we have a function when using named routes #86 (by Tobias Nyholm (@Nyholm))\n\n## 4.3.0\n\n* Support of custom hash string like `#!` for example. Read the [docs](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo/blob/master/README.md) for more information.\n\n## 4.2.0\n\n* Fixing [#82](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo/issues/82/).\n\n## 4.1.1/2\n\n* Adding `off` API method [#72](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo/issues/72).\n\n## 4.0.1\n\n* Fixing [#77](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo/issues/77/).\n\n## 4.0.0\n\nThat's a minor but a breaking change. The `generate` method now outputs proper strings base on the `useHash` parameter. Or in other words if the router is using hash based routing the generated URLs contain `#` in the beginning.\n\n## 3.5.1\n\n* Proper initialization of the root when using `useHash = true`\n* Minor fix while resolving hash based URLs (for Firefox)\n\n## 3.5.0\n\n* Adding a `resume` method which is same as `.pause(false)`. `.pause` now acts as `.pause(true)` by default.\n\n## 3.4.2\n\n* Fixing [#63](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo/issues/63/).\n\n## 3.4.1\n\n* Support of hooks in named routes. ([#60](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo/issues/60))\n\n## 3.4.0\n\n* Merging [#58](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo/pull/58) where we can prevent the handler calling from a before hook.\n\n## 3.3.3\n\n* Another try fixing [#57](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo/issues/57) - now if we have `noHash=false` the hash part of the URL is removed and we are no longer considering it while comparing the last resolved URL.\n\n## 3.3.2\n\n* Fixing [#57](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo/issues/57) - making sure that we keep the last resolved url when we have the `notFound` handler resolves.\n\n## 3.3.1\n\n* Fixing [#56](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo/issues/56) - When a `/` is given as a path it is considered as a default route handler.\n\n## 3.3.0\n\n* Start using [`onhaschange`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/WindowEventHandlers/onhashchange) API as a default for hash based routing.\n* Using [karma](https://www.npmjs.com/package/karma) as a test runner.\n\n## 3.2.1\n\n* Fixing the case where route handlers are not fired when only the query string part of the URL is changed (#53)\n\n## 3.2.0\n\n* [Accessing GET parameters](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo#accessing-get-parameters).\n\n## 3.1.0\n\n* [hooks](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo#hooks) support.\n"

For example, if you are hosting the application at `https://site.com/my/project` you have to specify the following:\n\n```js\nconst router = new Navigo('/my/project');\n```\n\nThe second argument is the default [router options](#routeroptions). The `strategy` field there defines how many matches the router finds - one or many.\n\n```js\nconst router = new Navigo('/my/project', { strategy: 'ALL' });\n```\n\nBy default the strategy is equal to `\"ONE\"`. Meaning that when a match is found the router stops resolving other routes.\n\nAnother option available is `noMatchWarning`. Which if you set to `true` will prevent the router of warning a message if there is no matching route.\n\n## Adding a route\n\n```typescript\ninterface Navigo {\n  on(path: string, f: Function, hooks?: RouteHooks): Navigo;\n  on(f: Function, hooks?: RouteHooks): Navigo;\n  on(map: Object, hooks?: RouteHooks): Navigo;\n}\n```\n\nTo add a route use the `on` method. It can be used in four different ways. The first and the most straightforward one is when you have a path and want to map it to a function.\n\n```js\nconst router = new Navigo('/');\nrouter.on('/foo/bar', () => {\n  // Fired if the page URL matches '/foo/bar'.\n});\n```\n\nThe path in this case could be also a regular expression. For example:\n\n```js\nconst router = new Navigo('/');\nrouter.on(/foo\\/(.*)/, () => {\n  // Fired if the page URL matches '/foo/bar'.\n});\n```\n\nIf you skip the path you are basically defining a handler for your root.\n\n```js\nconst router = new Navigo('/my/app');\nrouter.on(() => {\n  // Fired if the page URL matches '/my/app' route.\n  // Or in other words the home of your app.\n})\n```\n\nThe `on` method is chainable so you can call `on('...', () => {}).on('...', () => {})` if you want.\n\nThe next option is to define a key-value pairs of your routes:\n\n```js\nrouter.on({\n  '/foo/bar': () => {\n    // Fired if the route matches '/foo/bar'.\n  },\n  '/foo/zar': () => {\n    // Fired if the route matches '/foo/zar'.\n  }\n});\n```\n\nAnd the most complex one is by giving your route a name (via the `as` field). This could be used in a combination of the [generate](#generating-paths) method to construct a page path or simply to identify what is currently matching.\n\n```js\nrouter.on({\n  '/foo/bar': {\n    as: 'routeA',\n    uses: () => {\n       // Fired if the route matches '/foo/bar'.\n    }\n  }\n  '/foo/bar': {\n    as: 'routeB',\n    uses: () => {\n       // Fired if the route matches '/foo/bar'.\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\nNotice the typing of the `on` method in the beginning of this section and you'll see that you can pass hooks to each route. More about that in the [hooks](#hooks) section.\n\n### Parameterized routes\n\nThe parameterized routes have paths that contain dynamic parts. For example:\n\n```js\nconst router = new Navigo('/');\n\nrouter.on('/user/:id/:action', ({ data }) => {\n  console.log(data); // { id: 'xxx', action: 'save' }\n});\n\nrouter.resolve('/user/xxx/save');\n```\n\n`\"/user/xxx/save\"` matches the defined route. `\"xxx\"` maps to `id` and `\"save\"` to `action`. The data from the URL comes into the `data` field of the [Match](#match) object passed to your handler.\n\nParameterized routes happen also when we use a regular expression as a path. It's just our `data` property comes as an array containing the matched groups.\n\n```js\nconst router = new Navigo('/');\nrouter.on(/rock\\/(.*)\\/(.*)/, ({ data }) => {\n  console.log(data); // [\"paper\", \"scissors\"]\n});\nrouter.resolve(\"/rock/paper/scissors\");\n```\n\n### Reading GET params\n\nNavigo captures the GET params of the matched routes. For example:\n\n```js\nconst router = new Navigo('/');\n\nrouter.on('/user/:id/:action', ({ data, params, queryString }) => {\n  console.log(data); // { id: 'xxx', action: 'save' }\n  console.log(params); // { m: \"n\", k: \"z\" }\n  console.log(queryString); // \"m=n&k=z\"\n});\n\nrouter.resolve('/user/xxx/save?m=n&k=z');\n```\n\n### Reading hash params\n\nNavigo captures the hash bit of the URL for the matched routes. For example:\n\n```js\nconst router = new Navigo('/');\n\nrouter.on('/foobar', ({ hashString }) => {\n  console.log(hashString); // something-else\n});\n\nrouter.resolve('/foobar#something-else');\n```\n\n### Matching logic\n\nNavigo relies on regular expressions to match strings against location paths. This logic is abstracted and for the final user we have a simple [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language). Here are couple of examples:\n\n```js\nrouter.on('/foo', () => {});\n// matches specifically \"/foo\"\n\nrouter.on('/foo/:name', () => {});\n// matches \"/foo/my-name-here\"\n\nrouter.on(':page', () => {});\n// matches \"/about-page\"\n\nrouter.on('/foo/*', () => {});\n// matches \"/foo/a/b/c\"\n\nrouter.on('*', () => {});\n// matches \"/foo/bar/moo\"\n\nrouter.on(/rock\\/(.*)\\/(.*)/, () => {});\n// matches \"/rock/paper/scissors\"\n\nrouter.on('/foo/:id/?', () => {});\n// matches \"/foo/20/save\" and also \"/foo/20\"\n```\n\n## Removing a route\n\n```typescript\ninterface Navigo {\n  off(path: string | RegExp): Navigo;\n  off(handler: Function): Navigo;\n}\n```\n\nTo remove a route call the `off` method by passing the path (or the used regular expression) or the handler of the route.\n\n## Navigating between routes\n\n```typescript\ninterface Navigo {\n  navigate(to: string, options?: NavigateOptions): void;\n}\n\ntype NavigateOptions = {\n  title?: string;\n  stateObj?: Object;\n  historyAPIMethod?: string;\n  updateBrowserURL?: boolean;\n  callHandler?: boolean;\n  callHooks?: boolean;\n  updateState?: boolean;\n  force?: boolean;\n  resolveOptions?: ResolveOptions;\n};\n```\n\nThe `navigate` method by default:\n\n* Checks if there is a match. And if the answer is \"yes\" then ...\n* It calls hooks (if any) and your route handler.\n* Updates the internal state of the router.\n* Updates the browser URL.\n\nConsider the following example:\n\n```js\nconst router = new Navigo(\"/\");\n\nrouter\n  .on(\"/foo/bar\", () => {\n    console.log('Nope');\n  })\n  .on(\"/about\", () => {\n    console.log('This is About page');\n  });\n\nrouter.navigate(\"about\");\n```\n\nAfter the last line the browser will have in its address bar `/about` as a path and in the console we'll see `\"This is About page\"`. `router.lastResolved()` and `router.current` will point to an array of a single object of type [Match](#match).\n\n`navigate` accepts a few options:\n\n* `title` is a string that gets passed to `pushState` (or `replaceState`).\n* `stateObj` is a state object that gets passed to `pushState` (or `replaceState`).\n* If you don't want to have a new entry in the history you should pass `{ historyAPIMethod: 'replaceState' }`. By default is `pushState`.\n* If `updateBrowserURL` is set to `false` the library will not use the history API at all. Meaning, the browser URL will not change.\n* If `callHandler` is set to `false` your route handler will not be fired.\n* If `callHooks` is set to `false` your route hooks will be skipped.\n* If `updateState` is set to `false` the router will not update its internal state. This means that the `lastResolved()`/`current` route will not be updated.\n* If `force` is set to `true` the router will update its internal state only. This makes the router like it already resolved specific URL.\n* `resolveOptions` are the same options used in the [resolve](#resolving-routes) method.\n\n### Navigating by route name\n\n```typescript\ninterface Navigo {\n  navigateByName(name: string, data?:Object, options?: NavigateOptions): boolean;\n}\n```\n\nVery often we have complex URLs and we want to have a quick way to reach them. `navigateByName` is a method that helps in such cases:\n\n```js\nroute.on({\n  \"/users/:name\": { \n    as: \"user\",\n    uses: (match) => {\n      console.log(match.data.name); // Krasimir\n    }\n  },\n});\n\nrouter.navigateByName(\"user\", { name: \"Krasimir\" });\n```\n\n`/users/Krasimir` is set in the address bar of the browser and the handler is executed.\n\nThe method returns `true` if there is such route with that name (i.e. the navigating happened) and `false` if it doesn't.\n\n## Augment your `<a>` tags\n\nLet's say that we have a page with links (`<a>` tags). The links have `href` attributes pointing to locations inside your app. By default Navigo doesn't know about those links and if you click them you'll probably get a full page load. To augment those links and integrate them with Navigo just add `data-navigo` attribute. For example:\n\n```html\n<a href=\"/company/about\" data-navigo>About</a>\n```\n\nWhen Navigo is initialized checks the page for such tags and attaches `click` handler which fires the router's `navigate` method.\n\nNavigo has a method called `updatePageLinks` which you have to call every time when you change the DOM and you expect to see new links on the page. Because Navigo is not wired to a rendering engine doesn't really know about the DOM manipulations. It does though makes an assumption - after each of your route handlers there is a `updatePageLinks` call. The router expects that after the successful route resolving the DOM is updated and calls that function again. Feel free to fire `updatePageLinks` multiple times on the same DOM tree. There will be just one `click` handler attached to your links.\n\n*Links with `target=\"_blank\"` are ignored even if they have `data-navigo` attribute.*\n\n### `data-navigo` with value\n\nIf you use `data-navigo=\"false\"` the link will be ignored by Navigo and if there was a click handler for it the handler will be removed.\n\n### Custom selector\n\nIf you are not happy with  `data-navigo` attribute you may provide your own CSS selector. You may even say \"just augment all the links on the page\".\n\n```js\nconst router = new Navigo(\"/\", { linksSelector: \"a\" });\n```\n\nExample [here](./examples/custom-selector/page.html).\n\n### Passing options to the `navigate` method\n\nAs we learned above, when a link with `data-navigo` attribute is clicked the `navigate` method of the router gets executed. That same method accepts options and if you want to pass some of them use the following syntax:\n\n```html\n<a href=\"/foo/bar\" data-navigo data-navigo-options=\"updateBrowserURL:false, callHandler: false, updateState: false, force: false, historyAPIMethod: replaceState, resolveOptionsStrategy: ALL, resolveOptionsHash: true\">my link</a>\n```\n\nWhich will result in the following options:\n\n```js\n{\n  updateBrowserURL: false,\n  callHandler: false,\n  updateState: false,\n  force: false,\n  historyAPIMethod: \"replaceState\",\n  resolveOptions: { strategy: \"ALL\", hash: true },\n}\n```\n\n## Resolving routes\n\n```typescript\ninterface Navigo {\n  resolve(path?: string, resolveOptions?: ResolveOptions): false | Match[];\n}\n\nexport type ResolveOptions = {\n  strategy?: ONE | ALL;\n  noMatchWarning?: true | false;\n};\ntype Match = {\n  url: string;\n  queryString: string;\n  route: Route;\n  data: Object | null;\n  params: Object | null;\n};\ntype Route = {\n  name: string;\n  path: string;\n  handler: Function;\n  hooks: RouteHooks;\n};\n```\n\nBy default Navigo is not resolving your routes. You have to at least once call `resolve` method. The `path` argument is not mandatory. If you skip it the library will use the current URL of the page. The method is fired automatically in the following cases:\n\n* If there is a `popstate` event dispatched (this happens when the user manually changes the browser location by hitting for example the back button)\n* If the `navigate` method is called and `shouldResolve` is not set to `false`\n\nBy default the `resolve` function catches the first match and stops searching. You can amend this behavior by passing `\"ALL\"` as a value of the `strategy` field. However, if there is a matching route you'll get an array of object (or objects) of type [Match](#match). If there is no match then `resolve` returns `false`. When your route gets resolved its handler is called. It receives a [Match](#match) object. From that object you can pull the data passed through the URL (if you used a parameterized path) or the GET params set in the URL.\n\nIf you need to see the latest match (or matches) you can access it via the `lastResolved()` method.\n\n`resolve` does the following:\n\n* Checks if there is a match. And if the answer is \"yes\" then ...\n* It calls hooks (if any) and your route handler.\n* Updates the internal state of the router.\n\nAnother option available is `noMatchWarning`. Which if you set to `true` will prevent the router of warning a message if there is no matching route.\n\n### Resolve options\n\n```typescript\nexport type ResolveOptions = {\n  strategy?: ONE | ALL;\n  hash?: boolean;\n  noMatchWarning?: true | false;\n};\n```\n\n* `strategy` - either `\"ONE\"` (by default) or `\"ALL\"`.\n* `hash` - whether to use hash based routing or not (by default is `false`).\n* `noMatchWarning` - `false` (by default) or `true`\n\n### Hash based routing\n\nNavigo supports hash based routing. Which means that it uses the hash string as path for routing. For example `/my/app/#/about/team` is treated as `/about/team`. To enable this mode you have to pass `hash: true` when creating the router.\n\n```js\nconst router = new Navigo('/', { hash: true });\n```\n\n## Direct matching of registered routes\n\nIf you want to check if some path is matching any of the routes without triggering hooks, handlers or changing the browser URL you may use the `match` method. For example:\n\n```js\nconst r: Navigo = new Navigo(\"/\");\n\nr.on(\"/user/:id\", () => {});\n\nconsole.log(r.match(\"/nope\"));\n// result: false\n\nconsole.log(r.match(\"/user/xxx/?a=b\"));\n// result:\n// [\n//   {\n//     data: {\n//       id: \"xxx\",\n//     },\n//     params: { a: \"b\" },\n//     queryString: \"a=b\",\n//     route: {\n//       handler: [Function],\n//       hooks: undefined,\n//       name: \"user/:id\",\n//       path: \"user/:id\",\n//     },\n//     url: \"user/xxx\",\n//   }\n// ]\n```\n\nThe function returns an array of [Match](#match) objects or `false`.\n\n## Direct matching of paths\n\nThere is a `matchLocation` method that offers the bare matching logic of the router. You pass a `path` and it checks if the string matches the current location. If you don't want to use the current location of the browser you may send a second argument. For example:\n\n```js\n// let's say that the path of the browser is \"/foo/bar?a=b\"\nrouter.matchLocation('/foo/:id');\n/*\n{\n  data: {\n    id: \"bar\",\n  },\n  params: { a: \"b\" },\n  queryString: \"a=b\",\n  route: {\n    handler: expect.any(Function),\n    hooks: {},\n    name: \"foo/:id\",\n    path: \"foo/:id\",\n  },\n  url: \"foo/bar\",\n}\n*/\n\n// passing the current location manually\nr.matchLocation(\"/foo/:id\", \"/foo/bar?a=b\");\n```\n\nThe method returns false if there is no match.\n\n## Hooks\n\nThe _hooks_ are functions that are fired as part of the resolving process. Think about them as lifecycle methods.\n\n### Type of hooks\n\nThe hooks object has the following signature:\n\n```typescript\ntype RouteHooks = {\n  before?: (done: Function, match: Match) => void;\n  after?: (match: Match) => void;\n  leave?: (done: Function, match: Match) => void;\n  already?: (match: Match) => void;\n};\n```\n\n* The `before` hook receives two arguments. The first one is a function that needs to be called with either no arguments or `false`. The no-argument version means \"move forward\". `false` stops the resolving and your handler will not be called.\n* `after` is called after your handler\n* `leave` is called when you are about to leave out of the route. Similarly to the `before` hook accepts a function as first argument and a [Match](#match) object (or an array of [Match](#match) objects) as second. If the function is called with `false` Navigo will stop resolving the new matched route meaning \"we cant' go out of the current route\".\n* `already` is called when this is the current route and it matches again\n\n### Defining hooks for specific route\n\nThe `on` method accepts a hooks object as a last argument. For example:\n\n```js\n// for specific path\nrouter.on('/foo/bar/', () => {...}, {\n  before(done, match) {\n    // do something\n    done();\n  }\n});\n\n// for the root\nrouter.on(() => {...}, {\n  before(done, match) {\n    // do something\n    done();\n  }\n});\n\n// when using a route map\nr.on({\n  \"/foo/:id\": {\n    as: \"some.name\",\n    uses: handler,\n    hooks: {\n      before: (done) => {\n        // do something\n        done();\n      },\n    },\n  },\n});\n\n// with the notFound method\nrouter.notFound(() => {...}, {\n  before(done, match) {\n    // do something\n    done();\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Defining hooks for all the routes\n\nYou can define hooks that will be used for all the registered routes. It is important to set the hooks before the other route definition.\n\n```js\nconst router = new Navigo(\"/\");\nrouter.hooks({\n  before(done, match) {\n    // do something\n    done();\n  }\n});\nrouter.on(\"/foo/bar\", () => {});\nrouter.on(\"/\", () => {});\n```\n\n### Adding a hook to already defined route\n\nSometimes you may need to add a hook to a route later. In such cases use the following syntax:\n\n```js\nconst router = new Navigo(\"/\");\n\nrouter.on(\"/foo/bar\", () => {});\nconst cleanup = router.addBeforeHook('foo/bar', (done) => {\n  // my before hook logic\n})\n\n// ... some other logic\ncleanup();\n```\n\nWith `addBeforeHook` we have `addAfterHook`, `addAlreadyHook` and `addLeaveHook` methods. All of them return a function which if called will remove the hook from the specific route.\n\n## Destroying the router\n\n```typescript\ndestroy(): void;\n```\n\nIf you no longer need Navigo working just call `router.destroy()`. This will flush all the registered routes so nothing will match.\n\n## Generating paths\n\nThere are two methods `link` and `generate` that you can use to create string paths. For example:\n\n```js\nconst router = new Navigo('/my/app');\n\nrouter.link('blah'); // \"/my/app/blah\n\nrouter.on({\n  \"/user/:id/:action\": { as: \"RouteNameHere\", uses: () => {} },\n});\n\nr.generate(\"RouteNameHere\", { id: \"xxx\", action: \"save\" }); // \"/my/app/user/xxx/save\"\n```\n\nNotice that the produced strings by default start with the root that you passed to the Navigo's constructor. If you don't want this behavior pass a third argument to the function `{ includeRoot: false }`. In this case the second argument should be always present. Feel free to pass `null` if you don't have any data.\n\n## Handling a not-found page\n\n```typescript\ninterface Navigo {\n  notFound(handler: Function, hooks?: RouteHooks): Navigo;\n}\n```\n\nNavigo offers a special handler for the cases where a no match is found.\n\n```js\nconst router = new Navigo('/');\n\nrouter.notFound(() => {\n  // this runs if there is no match found\n});\n```\n\n## Getting current location of the browser\n\n`router.getCurrentLocation()` returns the current location of the browser in the format of a [Match](#match) object.\n\n## Getting access to a route\n\nThere is `getRoute` method that accepts a route name/path. The object that you receive is of type [Route](#route).\n\n## Types\n\n### Navigo\n\n```typescript\nclass Navigo {\n  constructor(root: string, options?: RouterOptions);\n  destroyed: boolean;\n  current: Match[];\n  routes: Route[];\n  on(f: Function, hooks?: RouteHooks): Navigo;\n  on(map: Object, hooks?: RouteHooks): Navigo;\n  on(path: string | RegExp, f: Function, hooks?: RouteHooks): Navigo;\n  off(path: string | RegExp): Navigo;\n  off(handler: Function): Navigo;\n  navigate(to: string, options?: NavigateOptions): void;\n  navigateByName(name: string, data?: Object, options?: NavigateOptions): void;\n  resolve(path?: string, resolveOptions?: ResolveOptions): false | Match;\n  destroy(): void;\n  notFound(handler: Function, hooks?: RouteHooks): Navigo;\n  updatePageLinks(): Navigo;\n  link(path: string): string;\n  lastResolved(): null | Match[];\n  generate(name: string, data?: Object, options:?

          "content": "# Navigo\n\nA simple minimalistic JavaScript router with a fallback for older browsers.\n\n![Travis](https://travis-ci.org/krasimir/navigo.svg?branch=master)\n[![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/navigo.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/navigo)\n\n*([Demo source files](./demo))*\n\n---\n\n## Installation\n\nDrop the following into your page:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"//unpkg.com/navigo@6\"></script>\n``` \n\nor use via npm:\n\n```bash\nnpm install navigo --save\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Initialization\n\n```js\nvar root = null;\nvar useHash = true; // Defaults to: false\nvar hash = '#!'; // Defaults to: '#'\nvar router = new Navigo(root, useHash, hash);\n```\n\nThe constructor of the library accepts three arguments - `root`, `useHash` and `hash`. The first one is the main URL of\nyour application. If you call the constructor without parameters then Navigo figures out the root URL based on your routes. However, this proves to lead to bugs so I strongly recommend to set a `root` value.\n\nIf `useHash` is set to `true` then the router uses an old routing approach with hash in the URL. Navigo anyways falls back\nto this mode if there is no History API supported. The `hash` parameter allows you to configure the hash character.\n\n### Adding a route\n\n```js\nrouter\n  .on('/products/list', function () {\n    // display all the products\n  })\n  .resolve();\n```\n\n### Adding a main/root handler\n\n```js\nrouter\n  .on(function () {\n    // show home page here\n  })\n  .resolve();\n```\n\n### Adding multiple routes\n\n```js\nrouter\n  .on({\n    'products/:id': function () {\n      setContent('Products');\n    },\n    'products': function () {\n      setContent('About');\n    },\n    '*': function () {\n      setContent('Home')\n    }\n  })\n  .resolve();\n```\n\n*Have in mind that the order of the added routes using this method [does not](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo/pull/39) matter anymore. However, if we add series of routes by calling `on` multiple times we should consider the order of the calls.*\n\n### Parameterized URLs:\n\n```js\nrouter\n  .on('/user/:id/:action', function (params) {\n    // If we have http://site.com/user/42/save as a url then\n    // params.id = 42\n    // params.action = save\n  })\n  .resolve();\n```\n\n### Accessing GET parameters\n\nEvery handler receives the GET parameters passed to the page.\n\n```js\nrouter\n  .on('/user/:id/:action', function (params, query) {\n    // If we have http://site.com/user/42/save?answer=42 as a url then\n    // params.id = 42\n    // params.action = save\n    // query = answer=42\n  })\n  .resolve();\n```\n\nIn the case of the default handler and `notFound` handler the function receives only `query` as parameter. For example:\n```js\nrouter.notFound(function (query) {\n  // ...\n});\n```\n\n### Using regular expression\n\n```js\nrouter\n  .on(/user\\/(\\d+)\\/(\\w+)\\/?/, function (id, action) {\n    // If we have http://site.com/user/42/save as a url then\n    // id = 42\n    // action = save\n  })\n  .resolve();\n```\n\nWild card is also supported:\n\n```js\nrouter\n  .on('/user/*', function () {\n    // This function will be called on every\n    // URL that starts with /user\n  })\n  .resolve();\n```\n\n*Have in mind that every call of `on` do not trigger a route check (anymore). You have to run `resolve` method manually to get the routing works.*\n\n### Not-found handler\n\n```js\nrouter.notFound(function () {\n  // called when there is path specified but\n  // there is no route matching\n});\n```\n\n### Changing the page\n\nUse the `navigate` method:\n\n```js\nrouter.navigate('/products/list');\n```\n\nYou may also specify an absolute path. For example:\n\n```js\nrouter.navigate('http://site.com/products/list', true);\n```\n\nIf you want to bind page links to Navigo you have to add `data-navigo` attribute. For example:\n\n```html\n<a href=\"about\" data-navigo>About</a>\n```\n\n*(Have in mind that you have to fire `updatePageLinks` every time when new links are placed on the page so Navigo does the binding for them.)*\n\nIt's translated to:\n\n```js\n// the html to: <a href=\"javascript:void(0);\" data-navigo>About</a>\nvar location = link.getAttribute('href');\n...\nlink.addEventListener('click', e => {\n  e.preventDefault();\n  router.navigate(location);\n});\n```\n\n### Named routes\n\nUse the following API to give a name to your route and later generate URLs:\n\n```js\nrouter = new Navigo('http://site.com/', true);\nrouter.on({\n  '/trip/:tripId/edit': { as: 'trip.edit', uses: handler },\n  '/trip/save': { as: 'trip.save', uses: handler },\n  '/trip/:action/:tripId': { as: 'trip.action', uses: handler }\n});\nconsole.log(router.generate('trip.edit', { tripId: 42 })); // --> /trip/42/edit\nconsole.log(router.generate('trip.action', { tripId: 42, action: 'save' })); // --> /trip/save/42\nconsole.log(router.generate('trip.save')); // --> /trip/save\n```\n\n### Resolving the routes\n\nThe resolving of the routes happen when `resolve` method is fired which happen:\n\n* if you manually run `router.resolve()`\n* every time when the page's URL changes\n* if you call `navigate`\n\n### Pausing the router\n\n[Sometimes](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo/issues/18) you need to update the URL but you don't want to resolve your callbacks. In such cases you may call `.pause()` and do `.navigate('new/url/here')`. For example:\n\n```js\nrouter.pause();\nrouter.navigate('/en/products');\nrouter.resume(); // or .pause(false)\n```\n\nThe route will be changed to `/en/products` but if you have a handler for that path will not be executed.\n\n### Hooks\n\nThere is an API that allows you to run functions before firing a route handler. The `hooks` object is in the format of:\n\n```js\n{\n  before: function (done, params) { ... done(); },\n  after: function (params) { ... },\n  leave: function (params) { ... },\n  already: function (params) { ... }\n}\n```\n\nYou may specify only one of the hooks. The `before` hook accepts a function which you *must* invoke once you finish your job. Here is an examples:\n\n```js\nrouter.on(\n  '/user/edit',\n  function () {\n    // show user edit page\n  },\n  {\n    before: function (done, params) {\n      // doing some async operation\n      done();\n    },\n    after: function (params) {\n      // after resolving\n    },\n    leave: function (params) {\n      // when you are going out of the that route\n    }\n  }\n);\n```\n\nYou may prevent the handler to be resolved in the `before` hook by invoking `done(false)`:\n\n```js\nrouter.on(\n  '/user/edit',\n  function () {\n    // show user edit page\n  },\n  {\n    before: function (done, params) {\n      if(!user.loggedIn) {\n        done(false);\n      } else {\n        done()\n      }\n    }\n  }\n);\n```\n\nYou may provide hooks in two other cases:\n\n* While specifying a main/root handler `router.on(function() { ... }, hooks)`\n* While specifying a not-found page handler `router.notFound(function() { ... }, hooks)`\n\n#### Generic hooks\n\nIt is possible to set a `before` and/or `after` hooks for all the routes:\n\n```js\nvar router = new Navigo();\nrouter.hooks({\n  before: function(done, params) { ... },\n  after: function(params) { ... }\n});\n```\n\n*Also notice that both hooks receive `params` in case they are attached to a parameterized route.*\n\n## API\n\n* `router.on(function)` - adding handler for root/main route\n* `router.on(string, function)` - adding a new route\n* `router.on(object)` - adding a new route\n* `router.off(handler)` - removes the routes associated with the given handler/function\n* `router.navigate(path='', absolute=false)` - if `absolute` is `false` then Navigo finds the root path of your app based on the provided routes.\n* `router.resolve(currentURL=undefined)` - if `currentURL` is provided then the method tries resolving the registered routes to that URL and not `window.location.href`.\n* `router.destroy` - removes all the registered routes and stops the URL change listening.\n* `router.link(path)` - it returns a full url of the given `path`\n* `router.pause(boolean)` - it gives you a chance to change the route without resolving. Make sure that you call `router.pause(false)` so you return to the previous working state.\n* `router.disableIfAPINotAvailable()` - well, it disables the route if History API is not supported\n* `router.updatePageLinks()` - it triggers the `data-navigo` links binding process\n* `router.notFound(function)` - adding a handler for not-found URL (404 page)\n* `router.lastRouteResolved()` - returns an object with the format of `{ url: <string>, query: <string> }` matching the latest resolved route\n* `router.getLinkPath` - you may overwrite that function to provide a different mechanism for fetching paths from links which are currently on the page (with `data-navigo` attribute)\n* `router.historyAPIUpdateMethod` - by default Navigo uses History.pushState and changes that to History.replaceState if the router is `pause`d. If you need to always use `pushState` even if the router is `pause`d use this method like `router.historyAPIUpdateMethod('pushState')` after calling `pause`.\n\nThere are couple of static properties. You'll probably never need to touch them but here're they:\n\n```js\nNavigo.PARAMETER_REGEXP = /([:*])(\\w+)/g;\nNavigo.WILDCARD_REGEXP = /\\*/g;\nNavigo.REPLACE_VARIABLE_REGEXP = '([^\\/]+)';\nNavigo.REPLACE_WILDCARD = '(?:.*)';\nNavigo.FOLLOWED_BY_SLASH_REGEXP = '(?:\\/$|$)';\nNavigo.MATCH_REGEXP_FLAGS = '';\n```\n\n`Navigo.MATCH_REGEXP_FLAGS` could be useful when you want a case insensitive route matching. Simple use `Navigo.MATCH_REGEXP_FLAGS = 'i'`.\n\n## Tests\n\n```\nnpm i\nnpm test\n// or npm run test-chrome\n// or npm run test-firefox\n```\n\n## Inspiration\n\n* [A modern JavaScript router in 100 lines](http://krasimirtsonev.com/blog/article/A-modern-JavaScript-router-in-100-lines-history-api-pushState-hash-url)\n\n## TODO\n\n* A general handler for when Navigo matches some of the rules\n"
