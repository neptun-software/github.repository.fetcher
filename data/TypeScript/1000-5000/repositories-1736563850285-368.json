This has been\nchanged to `[object AwilixContainerCradle]` to align with other common string representations in JavaScript.\n\n#### `Symbol.toStringTag` now implemented\n\nWhen using `Object.prototype.toString.call(container.cradle)`, it would return `[object Object]`.

As a trade-off, performance\n    for iterating the `cradle` proxy has degraded in order to guarantee accuracy. We consider this acceptable as iterating\n    the `cradle` is not something one should be doing for anything besides debugging. Thanks to [@code-ape](https://github.com/code-ape)\n    for the diagnosis and for coming up with a fix!\n\n### BREAKING CHANGES\n\n- The `container.registrations` getter on a scoped container no longer rolls up registrations from its' parent.\n- In `CLASSIC` mode, when parsing the constructor of a derived class, Awilix will no longer parse the base class' constructor in\n  case the derived class' defined constructor does not define any arguments. However, if the derived class does _not_ define a constructor,\n  then Awilix will parse the base class' constructor. Please keep in mind that this only works for native classes, as Awilix works on the\n  `toString` representation of the class/function in order to determine when a class with no defined constructor is encountered.\n- Renamed `container.has` to `container.hasRegistration` to avoid ambiguity. _Does it have a registration? Does it have a cached module? Who knows? Let's gooo!_\n\n# v5.0.1\n\n- Improve internal `uniq` function performance by using a `Set` ([#253](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix/pull/253), [Anderson Leite](https://github.com/andersonleite))\n- Update packages\n\n# v5.0.0\n\n- Improve resolve typing ([#247](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix/pull/247), [Goran Mržljak](https://github.com/mrzli))\n- Update packages\n\n### BREAKING CHANGES\n\nDropped Node 10 support.

([#227](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix/pull/227), [Jamie Corkhill](https://github.com/JamieCorkhill))\n\n# v4.3.1\n\n- `GlobWithOptions` now includes `BuildResolverOptions` instead of `ResolverOptions` (fixes [#214](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix/issues/214))\n\n# v4.3.0\n\n- Add support for [Native Node ES modules](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html) on Node v14+ ([#211](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix/pull/211), [Richard Simko](https://github.com/richardsimko))\n\n# v4.2.7\n\n- Fixes AwilixResolutionError throwing TypeError if resolution stack contains symbols ([#205](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix/pull/205), [astephens25](https://github.com/astephens25))\n- Update packages\n\n# v4.2.6\n\n- Fix return type for `createScope` when using a cradle typing. ([#182](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix/pull/182), [moltar](https://github.com/moltar))\n- Remove `yarn.lock`, contributing docs now recommend `npm`.\n- Update packages, upgrade to Prettier 2.0\n\n# v4.2.5\n\n- Add optional generic parameter to container typing. Allows for a typed `ICradle`. ([#169](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix/pull/169), [roikoren755](https://github.com/roikoren755))\n\n# v4.2.4\n\n- Fix issue with parsing comments ([#165](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix/pull/165), reported by [Jamie Corkhill](https://github.com/JamieCorkhill))\n\n# v4.2.3\n\n- Fix issue where calling `JSON.stringify` on the cradle would result in memory leak ([#153](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix/pull/153), [berndartmueller](https://github.com/berndartmueller))\n- Update packages\n\n# v4.2.2\n\n- Fix issue where the tokenizer was being too eager.

This works for ES6 classes as well as the old-school prototype approach to inheritance. Uses `Object.getPrototypeOf`. ([#107](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix/issues/107))\n- Allow auto-loading of named exports that expose a `RESOLVER` symbol prop. ([#115](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix/pull/115))\n\n# v4.0.1\n\n- Support returning the `cradle` in `async` functions ([#109](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix/issues/109), [andyfleming](https://github.com/andyfleming)))\n- Update packages\n\n# v4.0.0\n\n- **[BREAKING CHANGE]**: Scoped containers no longer use the parent's cache for `Lifetime.SCOPED` registrations [(#92)](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix/issues/92)\n- Change the `\"react-native\"` module path to use `awilix.browser.js` [(#104)](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix/issues/104)\n- Update packages\n\nAwilix v4 corrects a misunderstanding in how the scoped caching should work. For full context, please see [issue #92](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix/issues/92), but the TL:DR version is that prior `v4`, scoped registrations (`Lifetime.SCOPED` / `.scoped()`) would travel up the family tree and use a parent's cached resolution if there is any. If there is not, the resolving scope would cache it locally.\n\nWhile this was by design, it was not very useful, and it was designed based on a misunderstanding of how [Unity's `HierarchicalLifetimeManager` works](https://github.com/unitycontainer/unity/wiki/Unity-Lifetime-Managers#hierarchicallifetimemanager). In `v4`, `Lifetime.SCOPED` now works the same way: _the container performing the resolution also caches it, not looking outside itself for cached resolutions of `Lifetime.SCOPED` registrations_.\n\nA prime use case for this is having a scoped logger, as well as a root logger. This is actually what prompted this change.\n\n```js\n// logger.js\nexport class Logger {\n  constructor(loggerPrefix = 'root') {\n    this.prefix = loggerPrefix\n  }\n\n  log(message) {\n    console.log(`[${this.prefix}]: ${message}`)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```js\n// app.js\nimport { Logger } from './logger'\nimport { createContainer, asClass, InjectionMode } from 'awilix'\n\nconst container = createContainer({\n  injectionMode: InjectionMode.CLASSIC,\n}).register({\n  logger: asClass(Logger).scoped(),\n})\n\nconst scope = container.createScope()\nscope.register({\n  loggerPrefix: asValue('dope scope'),\n})\n\nconst rootLogger = container.resolve('logger')\nconst scopeLogger = scope.resolve('logger')\n\nrootLogger.log('yo!') // [root]: yo!\nscopeLogger.log('wassup!') // [dope scope]: wassup!\n```\n\nPrior to `v4`, the `scopeLogger` would have resolved to the same as `rootLogger` because it would ask it's ancestors if they had a `logger` cached.\nNow it works as you would probably expect it to: it keeps it's own cache.\n\n# v3.0.9\n\n- Updated packages.\n\n# v3.0.8\n\n- Add support for parsing async and generator functions; these no longer break the parser. ([#90](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix/issues/90))\n- Update dependencies.\n\n# v3.0.7\n\n- Skip code comments in parser ([#87](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix/issues/87))\n- Make the parser smarter by including full member expression paths so we get less false positives\n  when scanning for the constructor token.\n\n# v3.0.6\n\n- Update `container.cradle` typing to be `any` ([#83](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix/issues/83), [Ackos95](https://github.com/Ackos95))\n\n# v3.0.5\n\n- Updated dependencies\n- Fix TS 2.7 compilation issue\n- Fix the `GlobWithOptions` type to include `LifetimeType`\n\n# v3.0.4\n\n- Fix [#76](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix/issues/76): don't overwrite declarations when building with Rollup.\n\n# v3.0.3\n\n- Adjust Rollup config to use latest [config format](https://gist.github.com/Rich-Harris/d472c50732dab03efeb37472b08a3f32)\n\n# v3.0.2\n\n- Updated packages, fix an internal typing issue as a result of updated typings.\n\n# v3.0.1\n\n- Use `Reflect.construct()` instead of `new` internally; fixes TS transpilation issue.\n- Add note on browser support to README.\n\n# v3.0.0\n\nA lot of cool stuff has made it into version 3, and a few things were broken in\nthe process. I have done my best to list everything here.\n\n## ✨ New Features\n\nWith v3 comes a few new cool features.\n\n### Disposer support ([#48](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix/issues/48))\n\nThis has been a very requested feature. The idea is you can tell Awilix how to\ndispose of a dependency—for example, to close a database connection—when calling\n`container.dispose()`.\n\n```js\nconst pg = require('pg')\nconst { createContainer, asFunction } = require('awilix')\nconst container = createContainer()\n  .register({\n    pool: (\n      asFunction(() => new pg.Pool({ ... }))\n        .singleton()\n        .disposer((pool) => pool.end())\n    )\n  })\n\n// .. later, but only if a `pool` was ever created\ncontainer.dispose().then(() => {\n  console.log('One disposable connection.. disposed! Huehehehe')\n})\n```\n\n### `alias` resolver ([#55](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix/issues/55))\n\nThis new resolver lets you alias a registration. This is best illustrated with\nan example:\n\n```js\nconst { alias, asValue, createContainer } = require('awilix')\n\nconst container = createContainer()\n\ncontainer.register({\n  laughingOutLoud: asValue('hahahahaha'),\n  lol: alias('laughingOutLoud'),\n})\n\ncontainer.resolve('lol') // 'hahahahaha'\n```\n\nIt's essentially the exact same as calling\n`container.resolve('laughingOutLoad')`, but `lol` might be easier to type out in\nyour constructors. 😎\n\n### Default values in constructors/functions ([#46](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix/issues/46))\n\nThis is a pretty _small_ feature but was the most difficult to land, mainly\nbecause I had to write a smarter\n[parser](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix/tree/master/src/param-parser.ts) and\n[tokenizer](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix/tree/master/src/function-tokenizer.ts),\nnot to mention they are now way better at skipping over code. Check out\n[the tests](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix/tree/master/src/__tests__/param-parser.test.ts#L149),\nit's pretty wild.\n\n```js\nclass MyClass {\n  constructor(db, timeout = 1000) { /*...*/ }\n}\n\ncontainer.register({\n  db: asFunction(..)\n})\n\n// Look! No errors!! :D\ncontainer.build(MyClass) instanceof MyClass // true\n```\n\n### Official support for running in the browser ([#69](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix/issues/69))\n\nAwilix now ships with 4 module flavors: CommonJS (same old), ES Modules for\nNode, ES Modules for the Browser and UMD.\n\nPlease see the\n[Universal Module](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix#universal-module-browser-support)\nsection in the readme for details.\n\n## 🚨 Known breaking changes\n\nThe following is a list of known breaking changes. If there's any I've missed\nfeel free to let me know.\n\n### The entire library is now written in TypeScript! ([#49](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix/issues/49))\n\nThis means a bunch of interfaces have been renamed and made more correct. If\nyou're a TypeScript user, this is great news for you. 😄\n\n### `ResolutionMode` is now `InjectionMode` ([#57](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix/issues/57))\n\n- `ResolutionMode.js` renamed to `injection-mode.ts`\n- `ResolutionMode` renamed to `InjectionMode`\n\n### \"Registrations\" are now \"Resolvers\" ([#51](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix/issues/51))\n\nThe terminology is now \"you _register_ a **resolver** to a **name**\".\n\n- TypeScript interfaces renamed\n- `REGISTRATION` symbol renamed to `RESOLVER`\n- `registrations.js` renamed to `resolvers.ts`\n- `registrationOptions` in `loadModules` renamed to `resolverOptions`\n\n### `registerClass`, `registerFunction` and `registerValue` removed ([#60](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix/issues/60))\n\nThis was done to simplify the API surface, and also simplifies the\nimplementation greatly (less overloads). You should be using\n`container.register` with `asClass`, `asFunction` and `asValue` instead.\n\n### Resolver configuration chaining API is now immutable ([#62](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix/issues/62))\n\nThis simplifies the TypeScript types and is also considered a good practice. All\nconfiguration functions rely on `this`, meaning you **should not do**:\n\n```js\n// I don't know why you would, but DONT DO THIS!\nconst singleton = asClass(MyClass).singleton\nsingleton()\n```\n\nHowever, this also means you can now \"split\" a resolver to configure it\ndifferently. For example:\n\n```js\nclass GenericSender {\n  constructor(transport) {\n    this.transport = transport\n  }\n\n  send() {\n    if (this.transport === 'email') {\n      // ... etc\n    }\n  }\n\n  dispose() { /*...*/ }\n}\n\nconst base = asClass(GenericSender).scoped().disposer((g) => g.dispose())\nconst emailSender = base.inject(() => ({ transport: 'email' })\nconst pushSender = base.inject(() => ({ transport: 'push' })\n\ncontainer.register({\n  emailSender,\n  pushSender\n})\n```\n\n### Removed `AwilixNotAFunctionError` in favor of a generic `AwilixTypeError` ([#52](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix/issues/52))\n\nThis _should_ not have an impact on userland code but I thought I'd mention it.\n\nThere are a bunch of internal uses of this error, so I thought it made sense to\nconsolidate them into one error type.\n\n## 👀 Other cool changes\n\n- Code is now formatted with Prettier\n- Awilix is now using `husky` + `lint-staged` to lint, format and test every\n  commit to ensure top code quality.\n- Switched to Jest from Mocha\n- Switched from eslint to tslint\n- Rewrote the function parameter parser, it is now much better at correctly\n  skipping over default value expressions to reach the next parameter.\n- Most (if not all) of the code is now documented and should be readable.\n\n---\n\n# 2.12.0\n\n- Deprecated the `registerFunction`, `registerValue` and `registerClass`\n  shortcuts.\n\n# 2.11.1\n\n- Fix typings for `container.build`\n\n# 2.11.0\n\n- Add support for `container.build()` - see\n  [relevant docs](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix#containerbuild)\n\n# 2.10.0\n\n- Add support for `Object.keys()` on the cradle; now returns the names of\n  available modules that can be resolved by accessing them.\n  - There's a gotcha though; `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor()` will return a\n    gibberish descriptor. This is required for the keys to show up in the\n    result.\n- Fix iterating over cradle - generator now yields registration names, thanks\n  [@neerfri](https://github.com/neerfri)!\n  ([#40](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix/issues/40))\n\n# 2.9.0\n\n- Fix issue with `console.log` on the cradle throwing an error.\n  ([#7](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix/issues/7))\n  - This _should_ not break anything, but just to be safe I did a minor version\n    bump.\n- Add support for `Symbol`s (although not recommended).\n\n# 2.8.4\n\n- Change `RegistrationOptions` typing to union of string and options\n\n# 2.8.3\n\n- Fix typing for `REGISTRATION` symbol\n\n# 2.8.2\n\n- Fix typing for `loadModules` — it didn't allow the shortcut version of\n  `['glob.js', Lifetime.SCOPED]`\n- Add Prettier formatting as well as `lint-staged` to keep the tests passing and\n  the code fresh before committing.\n\n# 2.8.1\n\n- Remove `is-plain-object` and `is-string`, use simple checks instead. Trying to\n  keep the dependencies as thin as possible.\n\n# 2.8.0\n\n- **[NEW]**: Support inline registration options\n  ([#34](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix/issues/34))\n\n# 2.7.1\n\n- **[FIXED]**: `container.loadModules()` typing fix, thanks\n  [@dboune](https://github.com/dboune)!\n\n# 2.7.0\n\n- **[BREAKING]**: Custom `isClass` function that will treat\n  `function Capital () {}` as a class due to the capital first letter of the\n  function name. This is to improve compatibility with Babel's ES5 code\n  generator, and is also a pretty commonly accepted standard naming convention.\n  ([#28](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix/issues/28))\n- **[NEW]**: Added support for passing in a `register` function to\n  `loadModules`. ([#28](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix/issues/28))\n\n# 2.6.2\n\n- **[FIXED]**: Parsing regression in 2.6.1\n  ([#30](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix/issues/30))\n\n# 2.6.1\n\n- **[FIXED]**: Implemented a crude arguments parser to replace regex.\n  ([#30](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix/issues/30))\n\n# 2.6.0\n\n- **[NEW]**: infer function name for `registerClass`/`registerFunction`\n  ([#26](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix/issues/26))\n- **[FIXED]**: Corrected some TypeScript typings related to `registerClass` and\n  `registerFunction`.\n\n# 2.5.0\n\n- **[NEW]**: Implemented per-module locals injection\n  ([#24](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix/issues/24)).\n- Fixed issue where passing a `Lifetime` like\n  `.registerFunction('name', func, Lifetime.SCOPED)` didn't work.\n- Documented `asClass`, `asValue` and `asFunction`.\n- **[FIXED]**: nasty options leaking when using\n  `registerClass/Function({ test1: [Test1, { }], test2: [Test2, { }] })`.\n\n# 2.4.0\n\n- **[BREAKING]**: Guard assertions added to `asFunction` and `asClass`. This\n  will prevent some nasty runtime behaviors.\n  ([#20](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix/issues/20)), thanks\n  [@zer0tonin](https://github.com/zer0tonin)!\n\n# 2.3.0\n\n- **[NEW]**: Classic dependency resolution mode using parameter name matching\n  implemented, thanks to\n  [@cjhoward92](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix/pull/21)! This is an\n  alternative to the default proxy mechanism.\n- **[BREAKING]**: The `registerX({ name: [value, options]})` pattern is not\n  needed for `registerValue` because it is so simple is requires no\n  configuration. It was causing trouble when attempting to register an array as\n  a value, because the `register` function would think it was the\n  value-options-array pattern when it shouldn't be. **This change is breaking in\n  the sense that it solves the unexpected behavior, but it breaks existing\n  registrations that would register arrays by using\n  `registerValue({ name: [[1, 2]] })` (multi-dimensional array to work around\n  the pre-2.3.0 behavior)**\n- [chore]: Updated packages.\n\n# 2.2.6\n\n- Pass in the module descriptor to `formatName` - thanks @anasinnyk!\n- Fixed some issues with TypeScript definitions.\n\n# 2.2.5\n\n- Fixed `registerFunction` return type definition - thanks @ycros!\n\n# 2.2.4\n\n- TypeScript definitions - thanks @blove!\n\n# 2.2.3\n\n- Webpack 2 compatibility - thanks @ewrogers!\n\n# 2.2.2\n\n- `console.log`ing the container will, instead of throwing an error, display a\n  string summary of the container. Fixes #7.\n- started logging changes to a changelog (sorry about being so late to the\n  party)\n"

At\nminimum, you need to do 3 things:\n\n- Create a container\n- Register some modules in it\n- Resolve and use!\n\n`index.js`\n\n```javascript\nconst awilix = require('awilix')\n\n// Create the container and set the injectionMode to PROXY (which is also the default).\n// Enable strict mode for extra correctness checks (highly recommended).\nconst container = awilix.createContainer({\n  injectionMode: awilix.InjectionMode.PROXY,\n  strict: true,\n})\n\n// This is our app code... We can use\n// factory functions, constructor functions\n// and classes freely.\nclass UserController {\n  // We are using constructor injection.\n  constructor(opts) {\n    // Save a reference to our dependency.\n    this.userService = opts.userService\n  }\n\n  // imagine ctx is our HTTP request context...\n  getUser(ctx) {\n    return this.userService.getUser(ctx.params.id)\n  }\n}\n\ncontainer.register({\n  // Here we are telling Awilix how to resolve a\n  // userController: by instantiating a class.\n  userController: awilix.asClass(UserController),\n})\n\n// Let's try with a factory function.\nconst makeUserService = ({ db }) => {\n  // Notice how we can use destructuring\n  // to access dependencies\n  return {\n    getUser: (id) => {\n      return db.query(`select * from users where id=${id}`)\n    },\n  }\n}\n\ncontainer.register({\n  // the `userService` is resolved by\n  // invoking the function.\n  userService: awilix.asFunction(makeUserService),\n})\n\n// Alright, now we need a database.\n// Let's make that a constructor function.\n// Notice how the dependency is referenced by name\n// directly instead of destructuring an object.\n// This is because we register it in \"CLASSIC\"\n// injection mode below.\nfunction Database(connectionString, timeout) {\n  // We can inject plain values as well!\n  this.conn = connectToYourDatabaseSomehow(connectionString, timeout)\n}\n\nDatabase.prototype.query = function (sql) {\n  // blah....\n  return this.conn.rawSql(sql)\n}\n\n// We use register coupled with asClass to tell Awilix to\n// use `new Database(...)` instead of just `Database(...)`.\n// We also want to use `CLASSIC` injection mode for this\n// registration. Read more about injection modes below.\ncontainer.register({\n  db: awilix.asClass(Database).classic(),\n})\n\n// Lastly we register the connection string and timeout values\n// as we need them in the Database constructor.\ncontainer.register({\n  // We can register things as-is - this is not just\n  // limited to strings and numbers, it can be anything,\n  // really - they will be passed through directly.\n  connectionString: awilix.asValue(process.env.CONN_STR),\n  timeout: awilix.asValue(1000),\n})\n\n// We have now wired everything up!\n// Let's use it! (use your imagination with the router thing..)\nrouter.get('/api/users/:id', container.resolve('userController').getUser)\n\n// Alternatively, using the `cradle` proxy..\nrouter.get('/api/users/:id', container.cradle.userController.getUser)\n\n// Using  `container.cradle.userController` is actually the same as calling\n// `container.resolve('userController')` - the cradle is our proxy!\n```\n\nThat example is rather lengthy, but if you extract things to their proper files\nit becomes more manageable.\n\n[Check out a working Koa example!](/examples/koa)\n\n# Lifetime management\n\nAwilix supports managing the lifetime of instances. This means that you can\ncontrol whether objects are resolved and used once, cached within a certain\nscope, or cached for the lifetime of the process.\n\nThere are 3 lifetime types available.\n\n- `Lifetime.TRANSIENT`: This is the default. The registration is resolved every\n  time it is needed. This means if you resolve a class more than once, you will\n  get back a new instance every time.\n- `Lifetime.SCOPED`: The registration is scoped to the container - that means\n  that the resolved value will be reused when resolved from the same scope (or a\n  child scope).\n- `Lifetime.SINGLETON`: The registration is always reused no matter what - that\n  means that the resolved value is cached in the root container.\n\nThey are exposed on the `awilix.Lifetime` object.\n\n```js\nconst Lifetime = awilix.Lifetime\n```\n\nTo register a module with a specific lifetime:\n\n```js\nconst { asClass, asFunction, asValue } = awilix\n\nclass MailService {}\n\ncontainer.register({\n  mailService: asClass(MailService, { lifetime: Lifetime.SINGLETON }),\n})\n\n// or using the chaining configuration API..\ncontainer.register({\n  mailService: asClass(MailService).setLifetime(Lifetime.SINGLETON),\n})\n\n// or..\ncontainer.register({\n  mailService: asClass(MailService).singleton(),\n})\n\n// or.......\ncontainer.register('mailService', asClass(MailService, { lifetime: SINGLETON }))\n```\n\n## Scoped lifetime\n\nIn web applications, managing state without depending too much on the web\nframework can get difficult. Having to pass tons of information into every\nfunction just to make the right choices based on the authenticated user.\n\nScoped lifetime in Awilix makes this simple - and fun!\n\n```js\nconst { createContainer, asClass, asValue } = awilix\nconst container = createContainer()\n\nclass MessageService {\n  constructor({ currentUser }) {\n    this.user = currentUser\n  }\n\n  getMessages() {\n    const id = this.user.id\n    // wee!\n  }\n}\n\ncontainer.register({\n  messageService: asClass(MessageService).scoped(),\n})\n\n// imagine middleware in some web framework..\napp.use((req, res, next) => {\n  // create a scoped container\n  req.scope = container.createScope()\n\n  // register some request-specific data..\n  req.scope.register({\n    currentUser: asValue(req.user),\n  })\n\n  next()\n})\n\napp.get('/messages', (req, res) => {\n  // for each request we get a new message service!\n  const messageService = req.scope.resolve('messageService')\n  messageService.getMessages().then((messages) => {\n    res.send(200, messages)\n  })\n})\n\n// The message service can now be tested\n// without depending on any request data!\n```\n\n**IMPORTANT!** If a singleton is resolved, and it depends on a scoped or\ntransient registration, those will remain in the singleton for its lifetime!\nSimilarly, if a scoped module is resolved, and it depends on a transient\nregistration, that remains in the scoped module for its lifetime.\nIn the example above, if `messageService` was a singleton, it would be cached\nin the root container, and would always have the `currentUser` from the first\nrequest. Modules should generally not have a longer lifetime than their\ndependencies, as this can cause issues of stale data.\n\n```js\nconst makePrintTime =\n  ({ time }) =>\n  () => {\n    console.log('Time:', time)\n  }\n\nconst getTime = () => new Date().toString()\n\ncontainer.register({\n  printTime: asFunction(makePrintTime).singleton(),\n  time: asFunction(getTime).transient(),\n})\n\n// Resolving `time` 2 times will\n// invoke `getTime` 2 times.\ncontainer.resolve('time')\ncontainer.resolve('time')\n\n// These will print the same timestamp at all times,\n// because `printTime` is singleton and\n// `getTime` was invoked when making the singleton.\ncontainer.resolve('printTime')()\ncontainer.resolve('printTime')()\n```\n\nIf you want a mismatched configuration like this to error, set\n`strict` in the container options. This will trigger\nthe following error at runtime when the singleton `printTime` is resolved:\n`AwilixResolutionError: Could not resolve 'time'. Dependency 'time' has a shorter lifetime than its ancestor: 'printTime'`\n\nIn addition, registering a singleton on a scope other than the root container results in\nunpredictable behavior. In particular, if two different singletons are registered on two different\nscopes, they will share a cache entry and collide with each other. To throw a runtime error when a\nsingleton is registered on a scope other than the root container, enable [strict mode](#strict-mode).\n\nRead the documentation for [`container.createScope()`](#containercreatescope)\nfor more examples.\n\n# Strict mode\n\nStrict mode is a new feature in Awilix 10. It enables additional correctness checks that can help\nyou catch bugs early.\n\nIn particular, strict mode enables the following checks:\n\n- When a singleton or scoped registration depends on a transient non-value registration, an error is\n  thrown. This detects and prevents the issue where a shorter lifetime dependency can leak outside\n  its intended lifetime due to its preservation in a longer lifetime module.\n- Singleton registrations on any scopes are disabled. This prevents the issue where a singleton is\n  registered on a scope other than the root container, which results in unpredictable behavior.\n- Singleton resolution is performed using registrations from the root container only, which prevents\n  potential leaks in which scoped registrations are preserved in singletons.\n\n# Injection modes\n\nThe injection mode determines how a function/constructor receives its\ndependencies. Pre-2.3.0, only one mode was supported - `PROXY` - which remains\nthe default mode.\n\nAwilix v2.3.0 introduced an alternative injection mode: `CLASSIC`. The injection\nmodes are available on `awilix.InjectionMode`\n\n- `InjectionMode.PROXY` (default): Injects a proxy to functions/constructors\n  which looks like a regular object.\n\n  ```js\n  class UserService {\n    constructor(opts) {\n      this.emailService = opts.emailService\n      this.logger = opts.logger\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  or with destructuring:\n\n  ```js\n  class UserService {\n    constructor({ emailService, logger }) {\n      this.emailService = emailService\n      this.logger = logger\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n- `InjectionMode.CLASSIC`: Parses the function/constructor parameters, and\n  matches them with registrations in the container. `CLASSIC` mode has a\n  slightly higher initialization cost as it has to parse the function/class\n  to figure out the dependencies at the time of registration, however resolving\n  them will be **much faster** than when using `PROXY`. _Don't use `CLASSIC` if\n  you minify your code!_ We recommend using `CLASSIC` in Node and `PROXY` in\n  environments where minification is needed.\n\n  ```js\n  class UserService {\n    constructor(emailService, logger) {\n      this.emailService = emailService\n      this.logger = logger\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Additionally, if the class has a base class but does not declare a constructor of its own, Awilix\n  simply invokes the base constructor with whatever dependencies it requires.\n\n  ```js\n  class Car {\n    constructor(engine) {\n      this.engine = engine\n    }\n  }\n\n  class Porsche extends Car {\n    vroom() {\n      console.log(this.engine) // whatever \"engine\" is\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\nInjection modes can be set per-container and per-resolver. The most specific one\nwins.\n\n> Note: I personally don't see why you would want to have different injection\n> modes in a project, but if the need arises, Awilix supports it.\n\n**Container-wide**:\n\n```js\nconst { createContainer, InjectionMode } = require('awilix')\n\nconst container = createContainer({ injectionMode: InjectionMode.CLASSIC })\n```\n\n**Per resolver**:\n\n```js\nconst container = createContainer()\n\ncontainer.register({\n  logger: asClass(Logger).classic(),\n  // or..\n  emailService: asFunction(makeEmailService).proxy()\n  // or..\n  notificationService: asClass(NotificationService).setInjectionMode(InjectionMode.CLASSIC)\n})\n\n// or..\ncontainer.register({\n  logger: asClass(Logger, { injectionMode: InjectionMode.CLASSIC })\n})\n```\n\n**For auto-loading modules**:\n\n```js\nconst container = createContainer()\ncontainer.loadModules(['services/**/*.js', 'repositories/**/*.js'], {\n  resolverOptions: {\n    injectionMode: InjectionMode.CLASSIC,\n  },\n})\n```\n\nChoose whichever fits your style.\n\n- `PROXY` _technically_ allows you to defer pulling dependencies (for circular\n  dependency support), but **this isn't recommended**.\n- `CLASSIC` feels more like the DI you're used to in other languages.\n- `PROXY` is more descriptive, and makes for more readable tests; when unit\n  testing your classes/functions without using Awilix, you don't have to worry\n  about parameter ordering like you would with `CLASSIC`.\n- Performance-wise, `CLASSIC` is _slightly_ faster because it only reads the\n  dependencies from the constructor/function _once_ (when `asClass`/`asFunction`\n  is called), whereas accessing dependencies on the Proxy _may_ incur slight\n  overhead for each resolve.\n- **`CLASSIC` will not work when your code is minified!** It reads the function\n  signature to determine what dependencies to inject. Minifiers will usually\n  mangle these names.\n\nHere's an example outlining the testability points raised.\n\n```js\n// CLASSIC\nfunction database(connectionString, timeout, logger) {\n  // ...\n}\n\n// Shorter, but less readable, order-sensitive\nconst db = database('localhost:1337;user=123...', 4000, new LoggerMock())\n\n// PROXY\nfunction database({ connectionString, timeout, logger }) {\n  // ...\n}\n\n// Longer, more readable, order does not matter\nconst db = database({\n  logger: new LoggerMock(),\n  timeout: 4000,\n  connectionString: 'localhost:1337;user=123...',\n})\n```\n\n# Auto-loading modules\n\nWhen you have created your container, registering 100's of classes can get\nboring. You can automate this by using `loadModules`.\n\n> **Important**: auto-loading looks at a file's **default export**, which can be:\n>\n> - `module.exports = ...`\n> - `module.exports.default = ...`\n> - `export default ...`\n>\n> To load a non-default export, set the `[RESOLVER]` property on it:\n>\n> ```js\n> const { RESOLVER } = require('awilix')\n> export class ServiceClass {}\n> ServiceClass[RESOLVER] = {}\n> ```\n>\n> Or even more concise using TypeScript:\n>\n> ```typescript\n> // TypeScript\n> import { RESOLVER } from 'awilix'\n> export class ServiceClass {\n>   static [RESOLVER] = {}\n> }\n> ```\n\nNote that **multiple** services can be registered per file, i.e. it is\npossible to have a file with a default export and named exports and for\nall of them to be loaded. The named exports do require the `RESOLVER`\ntoken to be recognized.\n\nImagine this app structure:\n\n- `app`\n  - `services`\n    - `UserService.js` - exports an ES6 `class UserService {}`\n    - `emailService.js` - exports a factory function\n      `function makeEmailService() {}`\n  - `repositories`\n    - `UserRepository.js` - exports an ES6 `class UserRepository {}`\n  - `index.js` - our main script\n\nIn our main script we would do the following:\n\n```js\nconst awilix = require('awilix')\n\nconst container = awilix.createContainer()\n\n// Load our modules!\ncontainer.loadModules(\n  [\n    // Globs!\n    [\n      // To have different resolverOptions for specific modules.\n      'models/**/*.js',\n      {\n        register: awilix.asValue,\n        lifetime: Lifetime.SINGLETON,\n      },\n    ],\n    'services/**/*.js',\n    'repositories/**/*.js',\n  ],\n  {\n    // We want to register `UserService` as `userService` -\n    // by default loaded modules are registered with the\n    // name of the file (minus the extension)\n    formatName: 'camelCase',\n    // Apply resolver options to all modules.\n    resolverOptions: {\n      // We can give these auto-loaded modules\n      // the deal of a lifetime! (see what I did there?)\n      // By default it's `TRANSIENT`.\n      lifetime: Lifetime.SINGLETON,\n      // We can tell Awilix what to register everything as,\n      // instead of guessing. If omitted, will inspect the\n      // module to determine what to register as.\n      register: awilix.asClass,\n    },\n  },\n)\n\n// We are now ready! We now have a userService, userRepository and emailService!\ncontainer.resolve('userService').getUser(1)\n```\n\n**Important**: Auto-loading relies on `glob` and therefore does not work with\nbundlers like Webpack, Rollup and Browserify.\n\n# Per-module local injections\n\nSome modules might need some additional configuration values than just\ndependencies.\n\nFor example, our `userRepository` wants a `db` module which is registered with\nthe container, but it also wants a `timeout` value. `timeout` is a very generic\nname and we don't want to register that as a value that can be accessed by all\nmodules in the container (maybe other modules have a different timeout?)\n\n```js\nexport default function userRepository({ db, timeout }) {\n  return {\n    find() {\n      return Promise.race([\n        db.query('select * from users'),\n        Promise.delay(timeout).then(() =>\n          Promise.reject(new Error('Timed out')),\n        ),\n      ])\n    },\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAwilix 2.5 added per-module local injections. The following snippet contains\n_all_ the possible ways to set this up.\n\n```js\nimport { createContainer, Lifetime, asFunction } from 'awilix'\nimport createUserRepository from './repositories/userRepository'\n\nconst container = createContainer()\n  // Using the fluid variant:\n  .register({\n    userRepository: asFunction(createUserRepository)\n      // Provide an injection function that returns an object with locals.\n      // The function is called once per resolve of the registration\n      // it is attached to.\n      .inject(() => ({ timeout: 2000 })),\n  })\n\n  // Shorthand variants\n  .register({\n    userRepository: asFunction(createUserRepository, {\n      injector: () => ({ timeout: 2000 }),\n    }),\n  })\n\n  // Stringly-typed shorthand\n  .register(\n    'userRepository',\n    asFunction(createUserRepository, {\n      injector: () => ({ timeout: 2000 }),\n    }),\n  )\n\n  // with `loadModules`\n  .loadModules([['repositories/*.js', { injector: () => ({ timeout: 2000 }) }]])\n```\n\nNow `timeout` is only available to the modules it was configured for.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: the way this works is by wrapping the `cradle` in another proxy\nthat provides the returned values from the `inject` function. This means if you\npass along the injected cradle object, anything with access to it can access the\nlocal injections.\n\n# Inlining resolver options\n\nAwilix 2.8 added support for inline resolver options. This is best explained\nwith an example.\n\n**services/awesome-service.js**:\n\n```js\nimport { RESOLVER, Lifetime, InjectionMode } from 'awilix'\n\nexport default class AwesomeService {\n  constructor(awesomeRepository) {\n    this.awesomeRepository = awesomeRepository\n  }\n}\n\n// `RESOLVER` is a Symbol.\nAwesomeService[RESOLVER] = {\n  lifetime: Lifetime.SCOPED,\n  injectionMode: InjectionMode.CLASSIC,\n}\n```\n\n**index.js**:\n\n```js\nimport { createContainer, asClass } from 'awilix'\nimport AwesomeService from './services/awesome-service.js'\n\nconst container = createContainer().register({\n  awesomeService: asClass(AwesomeService),\n})\n\nconsole.log(container.registrations.awesomeService.lifetime) // 'SCOPED'\nconsole.log(container.registrations.awesomeService.injectionMode) // 'CLASSIC'\n```\n\nAdditionally, if we add a `name` field and use `loadModules`, the `name` is used\nfor registration (ignoring `formatName` if provided).\n\n```diff\n// `RESOLVER` is a Symbol.\nAwesomeService[RESOLVER] = {\n+ name: 'superService',\n  lifetime: Lifetime.SCOPED,\n  injectionMode: InjectionMode.CLASSIC\n}\n```\n\n```js\nconst container = createContainer().loadModules(['services/*.js'])\nconsole.log(container.registrations.superService.lifetime) // 'SCOPED'\nconsole.log(container.registrations.superService.injectionMode) // 'CLASSIC'\n```\n\n**Important**: the `name` field is only used by `loadModules`.\n\n# Disposing\n\nAs of Awilix v3.0, you can call `container.dispose()` to clear the resolver\ncache and call any registered disposers. This is very useful to properly dispose\nresources like connection pools, and especially when using watch-mode in your\nintegration tests.\n\nFor example, database connection libraries usually have some sort of `destroy`\nor `end` function to close the connection. You can tell Awilix to call these for\nyou when calling `container.dispose()`.\n\n**Important:** the container being disposed **will not dispose its' scopes**. It\nonly disposes values **in it's own cache**.\n\n```js\nimport { createContainer, asClass } from 'awilix'\nimport pg from 'pg'\n\nclass TodoStore {\n  constructor({ pool }) {\n    this.pool = pool\n  }\n\n  async getTodos() {\n    const result = await this.pool.query('SELECT * FROM todos')\n    return result.rows\n  }\n}\n\nfunction configureContainer() {\n  return container.register({\n    todoStore: asClass(TodoStore),\n    pool: asFunction(() => new pg.Pool())\n      // Disposables must be either `scoped` or `singleton`.\n      .singleton()\n      // This is called when the pool is going to be disposed.\n      // If it returns a Promise, it will be awaited by `dispose`.\n      .disposer((pool) => pool.end()),\n  })\n}\n\nconst container = configureContainer()\nconst todoStore = container.resolve('todoStore')\n\n// Later...\ncontainer.dispose().then(() => {\n  console.log('Container has been disposed!')\n})\n```\n\nA perfect use case for this would be when using Awilix with an HTTP server.\n\n```js\nimport express from 'express'\nimport http from 'http'\n\nfunction createServer() {\n  const app = express()\n  const container = configureContainer()\n  app.get('/todos', async (req, res) => {\n    const store = container.resolve('todoStore')\n    const todos = await store.getTodos()\n    res.status(200).json(todos)\n  })\n\n  const server = http.createServer(app)\n  // Dispose container when the server closes.\n  server.on('close', () => container.dispose())\n  return server\n}\n\ntest('server does server things', async () => {\n  const server = createServer()\n  server.listen(3000)\n\n  /// .. run your tests..\n\n  // Disposes everything, and your process no\n  // longer hangs on to zombie connections!\n  server.close()\n})\n```\n\n# API\n\n## The `awilix` object\n\nWhen importing `awilix`, you get the following top-level API:\n\n- `createContainer`\n- `listModules`\n- `AwilixResolutionError`\n- `asValue`\n- `asFunction`\n- `asClass`\n- `aliasTo`\n- `Lifetime` - documented above.\n- `InjectionMode` - documented above.\n\nThese are documented below.\n\n## Resolver options\n\nWhenever you see a place where you can pass in **resolver options**, you can\npass in an object with the following props:\n\n- `lifetime`: An `awilix.Lifetime.*` string, such as `awilix.Lifetime.SCOPED`\n- `injectionMode`: An `awilix.InjectionMode.*` string, such as\n  `awilix.InjectionMode.CLASSIC`\n- `injector`: An injector function - see\n  [Per-module local injections](#per-module-local-injections)\n- `register`: Only used in `loadModules`, determines how to register a loaded\n  module explicitly\n- `isLeakSafe`: true if this resolver should be excluded from lifetime-leak checking performed in\n  [strict mode](#strict-mode). Defaults to false.\n\n**Examples of usage:**\n\n```js\ncontainer.register({\n  stuff: asClass(MyClass, { injectionMode: InjectionMode.CLASSIC }),\n})\n\ncontainer.loadModules([['some/path/to/*.js', { register: asClass }]], {\n  resolverOptions: {\n    lifetime: Lifetime.SCOPED,\n  },\n})\n```\n\n## `createContainer()`\n\nCreates a new Awilix container. The container stuff is documented further down.\n\nArgs:\n\n- `options`: Options object. Optional.\n  - `options.require`: The function to use when requiring modules. Defaults to\n    `require`. Useful when using something like\n    [`require-stack`](https://npmjs.org/package/require-stack). Optional.\n  - `options.injectionMode`: Determines the method for resolving dependencies.\n    Valid modes are:\n    - `PROXY`: Uses the `awilix` default dependency resolution mechanism (I.E.\n      injects the cradle into the function or class). This is the default\n      injection mode.\n    - `CLASSIC`: Uses the named dependency resolution mechanism. Dependencies\n      **_must_** be named exactly like they are in the registration. For\n      example, a dependency registered as `repository` cannot be referenced in a\n      class constructor as `repo`.\n  - `options.strict`: Enables [strict mode](#strict-mode). Defaults to `false`.\n\n## `asFunction()`\n\nUsed with `container.register({ userService: asFunction(makeUserService) })`.\nTells Awilix to invoke the function without any context.\n\nThe returned resolver has the following chainable (fluid) API:\n\n- `asFunction(fn).setLifetime(lifetime: string)`: sets the lifetime of the\n  registration to the given value.\n- `asFunction(fn).transient()`: same as\n  `asFunction(fn).setLifetime(Lifetime.TRANSIENT)`.\n- `asFunction(fn).scoped()`: same as\n  `asFunction(fn).setLifetime(Lifetime.SCOPED)`.\n- `asFunction(fn).singleton()`: same as\n  `asFunction(fn).setLifetime(Lifetime.SINGLETON)`.\n- `asFunction(fn).inject(injector: Function)`: Let's you provide local\n  dependencies only available to this module. The `injector` gets the container\n  passed as the first and only argument and should return an object.\n\n## `asClass()`\n\nUsed with `container.register({ userService: asClass(UserService) })`. Tells\nAwilix to instantiate the given function as a class using `new`.\n\nThe returned resolver has the same chainable API as [`asFunction`](#asfunction).\n\n## `asValue()`\n\nUsed with `container.register({ dbHost: asValue('localhost') })`. Tells Awilix\nto provide the given value as-is.\n\n## `aliasTo()`\n\nResolves the dependency specified.\n\n```js\ncontainer.register({\n  val: asValue(123),\n  aliasVal: aliasTo('val'),\n})\n\ncontainer.resolve('aliasVal') === container.resolve('val')\n```\n\n## `listModules()`\n\nReturns an array of `{name, path}` pairs, where the name is the module name, and\npath is the actual full path to the module.\n\nThis is used internally, but is useful for other things as well, e.g.\ndynamically loading an `api` folder.\n\nArgs:\n\n- `globPatterns`: a glob pattern string, or an array of them.\n- `opts.cwd`: The current working directory passed to `glob`. Defaults to\n  `process.cwd()`.\n- **returns**: an array of objects with:\n  - `name`: The module name - e.g. `db`\n  - `path`: The path to the module relative to `options.cwd` - e.g. `lib/db.js`\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nconst listModules = require('awilix').listModules\n\nconst result = listModules(['services/*.js'])\n\nconsole.log(result)\n// << [{ name: 'someService', path: 'path/to/services/someService.js' }]\n```\n\n**Important**: `listModules` relies on `glob` and therefore is not supported\nwith bundlers like Webpack, Rollup and Browserify.\n\n## `AwilixResolutionError`\n\nThis is a special error thrown when Awilix is unable to resolve all dependencies\n(due to missing or cyclic dependencies). You can catch this error and use\n`err instanceof AwilixResolutionError` if you wish. It will tell you what\ndependencies it could not find or which ones caused a cycle.\n\n## `AwilixRegistrationError`\n\nThis is a special error thrown when Awilix is unable to register a dependency due to a strict mode\nviolation. You can catch this error and use `err instanceof AwilixRegistrationError` if you wish.\n\n## The `AwilixContainer` object\n\nThe container returned from `createContainer` has some methods and properties.\n\n### `container.cradle`\n\n**Behold! This is where the magic happens!** The `cradle` is a proxy, and all\ngetters will trigger a `container.resolve`. The `cradle` is actually being\npassed to the constructor/factory function, which is how everything gets wired\nup.\n\n### `container.registrations`\n\nA read-only getter that returns the internal registrations. When invoked on a\n_scope_, will show registrations for it's parent, and it's parent's parent, and\nso on.\n\nNot really useful for public use.\n\n### `container.cache`\n\nA `Map<string, CacheEntry>` used internally for caching resolutions. Not meant\nfor public use but if you find it useful, go ahead but tread carefully.\n\nEach scope has it's own cache, and checks the cache of it's ancestors.\n\n```js\nlet counter = 1\ncontainer.register({\n  count: asFunction(() => counter++).singleton(),\n})\n\ncontainer.cradle.count === 1\ncontainer.cradle.count === 1\n\ncontainer.cache.delete('count')\ncontainer.cradle.count === 2\n```\n\n### `container.options`\n\nOptions passed to `createContainer` are stored here.\n\n```js\nconst container = createContainer({\n  injectionMode: InjectionMode.CLASSIC,\n})\n\nconsole.log(container.options.injectionMode) // 'CLASSIC'\n```\n\n### `container.resolve()`\n\nResolves the registration with the given name. Used by the cradle.\n\n**Signature**\n\n- `resolve<T>(name: string, [resolveOpts: ResolveOptions]): T`\n\n```js\ncontainer.register({\n  leet: asFunction(() => 1337),\n})\n\ncontainer.resolve('leet') === 1337\ncontainer.cradle.leet === 1337\n```\n\nThe optional `resolveOpts` has the following fields:\n\n- `allowUnregistered`: if `true`, returns `undefined` when the dependency does\n  not exist, instead of throwing an error.\n\n### `container.register()`\n\n**Signatures**\n\n- `register(name: string, resolver: Resolver): AwilixContainer`\n- `register(nameAndResolverPair: NameAndResolverPair): AwilixContainer`\n\nAwilix needs to know how to resolve the modules, so let's pull out the resolver\nfunctions:\n\n```js\nconst awilix = require('awilix')\nconst { asValue, asFunction, asClass } = awilix\n```\n\n- `asValue`: Resolves the given value as-is.\n- `asFunction`: Resolve by invoking the function with the container cradle as\n  the first and only argument.\n- `asClass`: Like `asFunction` but uses `new`.\n\nNow we need to use them. There are multiple syntaxes for the `register`\nfunction, pick the one you like the most - or use all of them, I don't really\ncare! :sunglasses:\n\n**Both styles supports chaining! `register` returns the container!**\n\n```js\n// name-resolver\ncontainer.register('connectionString', asValue('localhost:1433;user=...'))\ncontainer.register('mailService', asFunction(makeMailService))\ncontainer.register('context', asClass(SessionContext))\n\n// object\ncontainer.register({\n  connectionString: asValue('localhost:1433;user=...'),\n  mailService: asFunction(makeMailService, { lifetime: Lifetime.SINGLETON }),\n  context: asClass(SessionContext, { lifetime: Lifetime.SCOPED }),\n})\n\n// `asClass` and `asFunction` also supports a fluid syntax.\n// This...\ncontainer.register(\n  'mailService',\n  asFunction(makeMailService).setLifetime(Lifetime.SINGLETON),\n)\n// .. is the same as this:\ncontainer.register('context', asClass(SessionContext).singleton())\n\n// .. and here are the other `Lifetime` variants as fluid functions.\ncontainer.register('context', asClass(SessionContext).transient())\ncontainer.register('context', asClass(SessionContext).scoped())\n```\n\n**The object syntax, key-value syntax and chaining are valid for all `register`\ncalls!**\n\n### `container.hasRegistration()`\n\n- `container.hasRegistration(name: string | symbol): boolean`\n\nDetermines if the container has a registration with the given name. Also checks ancestor containers.\n\n### `container.loadModules()`\n\nGiven an array of globs, registers the modules and returns the container.\n\n> 💡 When using `opts.esModules`, a `Promise` is returned due to using the asynchronous `import()`.\n\nAwilix will use `require` on the loaded modules, and register the\ndefault-exported function or class as the name of the file.\n\n**This uses a heuristic to determine if it's a constructor function\n(`function Database() {...}`); if the function name starts with a capital\nletter, it will be `new`ed!**\n\nArgs:\n\n- `globPatterns`: Array of glob patterns that match JS files to load.\n- `opts.cwd`: The `cwd` being passed to `glob`. Defaults to `process.cwd()`.\n- `opts.formatName`: Can be either `'camelCase'`, or a function that takes the\n  current name as the first parameter and returns the new name. Default is to\n  pass the name through as-is. The 2nd parameter is a full module descriptor.\n- `opts.resolverOptions`: An `object` passed to the resolvers. Used to configure\n  the lifetime, injection mode and more of the loaded modules.\n- `opts.esModules`: Loads modules using Node's native ES modules.\n  **This makes `container.loadModules` asynchronous, and will therefore return a `Promise`!**\n  This is only supported on Node 14.0+ and should only be used if you're using\n  the [Native Node ES modules](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html)\n\nExample:\n\n```js\n// index.js\ncontainer.loadModules(['services/*.js', 'repositories/*.js', 'db/db.js'])\n\ncontainer.cradle.userService.getUser(123)\n\n// to configure lifetime for all modules loaded..\ncontainer.loadModules([\n  'services/*.js',\n  'repositories/*.js',\n  'db/db.js'\n], {\n  resolverOptions: {\n    lifetime: Lifetime.SINGLETON\n  }\n})\n\ncontainer.cradle.userService.getUser(123)\n\n// to configure lifetime for specific globs..\ncontainer.loadModules([\n  ['services/*.js', Lifetime.SCOPED], // all services will have scoped lifetime\n  'repositories/*.js',\n  'db/db.js'\n], {\n  resolverOptions: {\n    lifetime: Lifetime.SINGLETON // db and repositories will be singleton\n  }\n)\n\ncontainer.cradle.userService.getUser(123)\n\n// to use camelCase for modules where filenames are not camelCase\ncontainer.loadModules(['repositories/account-repository.js', 'db/db.js'], {\n  formatName: 'camelCase'\n})\n\ncontainer.cradle.accountRepository.getUser(123)\n\n// to customize how modules are named in the container (and for injection)\ncontainer.loadModules(['repository/account.js', 'service/email.js'], {\n  // This formats the module name so `repository/account.js` becomes `accountRepository`\n  formatName: (name, descriptor) => {\n    const splat = descriptor.path.split('/')\n    const namespace = splat[splat.length - 2] // `repository` or `service`\n    const upperNamespace =\n      namespace.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + namespace.substring(1)\n    return name + upperNamespace\n  }\n})\n\ncontainer.cradle.accountRepository.getUser(123)\ncontainer.cradle.emailService.sendEmail('test@test.com', 'waddup')\n```\n\nThe `['glob', Lifetime.SCOPED]` syntax is a shorthand for passing in resolver\noptions like so: `['glob', { lifetime: Lifetime.SCOPED }]`\n\n**Important**: `loadModules` depends on `fast-glob` and is therefore not supported in\nmodule bundlers like Webpack, Rollup, esbuild and Browserify.\n\n### `container.createScope()`\n\nCreates a new scope. All registrations with a `Lifetime.SCOPED` will be cached\ninside a scope. A scope is basically a \"child\" container.\n\n- returns `AwilixContainer`\n\n```js\n// Increments the counter every time it is resolved.\nlet counter = 1\ncontainer.register({\n  counterValue: asFunction(() => counter++).scoped(),\n})\nconst scope1 = container.createScope()\nconst scope2 = container.createScope()\n\nconst scope1Child = scope1.createScope()\n\nscope1.cradle.counterValue === 1\nscope1.cradle.counterValue === 1\nscope2.cradle.counterValue === 2\nscope2.cradle.counterValue === 2\n\nscope1Child.cradle.counterValue === 3\n```\n\nA _Scope_ maintains it's own cache of `Lifetime.SCOPED` registrations, meaning it **does not use the parent's cache** for scoped registrations.\n\n```js\nlet counter = 1\ncontainer.register({\n  counterValue: asFunction(() => counter++).scoped(),\n})\nconst scope1 = container.createScope()\nconst scope2 = container.createScope()\n\n// The root container is also a scope.\ncontainer.cradle.counterValue === 1\ncontainer.cradle.counterValue === 1\n\n// This scope resolves and caches it's own.\nscope1.cradle.counterValue === 2\nscope1.cradle.counterValue === 2\n\n// This scope resolves and caches it's own.\nscope2.cradle.counterValue === 3\nscope2.cradle.counterValue === 3\n```\n\nA scope may also register additional stuff - they will only be available within\nthat scope and it's children.\n\n```js\n// Register a transient function\n// that returns the value of the scope-provided dependency.\n// For this example we could also use scoped lifetime.\ncontainer.register({\n  scopedValue: asFunction((cradle) => 'Hello ' + cradle.someValue),\n})\n\n// Create a scope and register a value.\nconst scope = container.createScope()\nscope.register({\n  someValue: asValue('scope'),\n})\n\nscope.cradle.scopedValue === 'Hello scope'\ncontainer.cradle.someValue\n// throws AwilixResolutionException\n// because the root container does not know\n// of the resolver.\n```\n\nThings registered in the scope take precedence over registrations in the parent scope(s). This\napplies to both the registration directly requested from the scope container, and any dependencies\nthat the registration uses.\n\n```js\n// It does not matter when the scope is created,\n// it will still have anything that is registered\n// in its parent.\nconst scope = container.createScope()\n\ncontainer.register({\n  value: asValue('root'),\n  usedValue: asFunction((cradle) => `hello from ${cradle.value}`),\n})\n\nscope.register({\n  value: asValue('scope'),\n})\n\ncontainer.cradle.value === 'root'\nscope.cradle.value === 'scope'\ncontainer.cradle.usedValue === 'hello from root'\nscope.cradle.usedValue === 'hello from scope'\n```\n\nRegistering singletons in a scope results in unpredictable behavior and should be avoided. Having\nmore than one singleton with the same name in different scopes will result in them sharing a cache\nentry and colliding with each other. To disallow such registrations, enable\n[strict mode](#strict-mode) in the container options.\n\n### `container.build()`\n\nBuilds an instance of a class (or a function) by injecting dependencies, but\nwithout registering it in the container.\n\nIt's basically a shortcut for `asClass(MyClass).resolve(container)`.\n\nArgs:\n\n- `targetOrResolver`: A class, function or resolver (example: `asClass(..)`,\n  `asFunction(..)`)\n- `opts`: Resolver options.\n\nReturns an instance of whatever is passed in, or the result of calling the\nresolver.\n\n**Important**: if you are doing this often for the same class/function, consider\nusing the explicit approach and save the resolver, **especially** if you are\nusing classic resolution because it scans the class constructor/function when\ncalling `asClass(Class)` / `asFunction(func)`.\n\n```js\n// The following are equivelant..\nclass MyClass {\n  constructor({ ping }) {\n    this.ping = ping\n  }\n\n  pong() {\n    return this.ping\n  }\n}\n\nconst createMyFunc = ({ ping }) => ({\n  pong: () => ping,\n})\n\ncontainer.register({\n  ping: asValue('pong'),\n})\n\n// Shorthand\n// This uses `utils.isClass()` to determine whether to\n// use `asClass` or `asFunction`. This is fine for\n// one-time resolutions.\nconst myClass = container.build(MyClass)\nconst myFunc = container.build(createMyFunc)\n\n// Explicit\n// Save the resolver if you are planning on invoking often.\n// **Especially** if you're using classic resolution.\nconst myClassResolver = asClass(MyClass)\nconst myFuncResolver = asFunction(MyFunc)\n\nconst myClass = container.build(myClassResolver)\nconst myFunc = container.build(myFuncResolver)\n```\n\n### `container.dispose()`\n\nReturns a `Promise` that resolves when all disposers of cached resolutions have\nresolved. **Only cached values will be disposed, meaning they must have a\n`Lifetime` of `SCOPED` or `SINGLETON`**, or else they are not cached by the\ncontainer and therefore can't be disposed by it.\n\nThis also clears the container's cache.\n\n```js\nconst pg = require('pg')\n\ncontainer.register({\n  pool: asFunction(() => new pg.Pool())\n    .disposer((pool) => pool.end())\n    // IMPORTANT! Must be either singleton or scoped!\n    .singleton(),\n})\n\nconst pool = container.resolve('pool')\npool.query('...')\n\n// Later..\ncontainer.dispose().then(() => {\n  console.log('All dependencies disposed, you can exit now. :)')\n})\n```\n\n# Universal Module (Browser Support)\n\n**As of v3**, Awilix ships with official support for browser environments!\n\nThe package includes 4 flavors.\n\n- CommonJS, the good ol' Node format - `lib/awilix.js`\n- ES Modules, for use with module bundlers **in Node** - `lib/awilix.module.mjs`\n- ES Modules, for use with module bundlers **in the browser** -\n  `lib/awilix.browser.mjs`\n- UMD, for dropping it into a script tag - `lib/awilix.umd.js`\n\nThe `package.json` includes the proper fields for bundlers like Webpack, Rollup\nand Browserify to pick the correct version, so you should not have to configure\nanything. 😎\n\n**Important**: the browser builds do not support `loadModules` or `listModules`,\nbecause they depend on Node-specific packages.\n\n**Also important**: due to using `Proxy` + various `Reflect` methods, Awilix is only _supposed_ to work in:\n\n- Chrome >= 49\n- Firefox >= 18\n- Edge >= 12\n- Opera >= 36\n- Safari >= 10\n- Internet Explorer is not supported\n\n# Ecosystem\n\n- [`awilix-manager`](https://github.com/kibertoad/awilix-manager): Wrapper that allows eager injection, asynchronous init methods and dependency lookup by tags.\n- [`awilix-express`](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix-express): Bindings for the Express HTTP library.\n- [`awilix-koa`](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix-koa): Bindings for the Koa HTTP library.\n- [`awilix-router-core`](https://github.com/jeffijoe/awilix-router-core): Library for building HTTP bindings for Awilix with routing.\n- [`fastify-awilix`](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-awilix): Bindings for the Fastify framework.\n- [`awilix-vite`](https://github.com/kvist-no/awilix-vite): Use Awilix in Vite projects.\n\n# Contributing\n\nPlease see our [contributing.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n# What's in a name?\n\nAwilix is the mayan goddess of the moon, and also my favorite character in the\ngame [SMITE](http://www.smitegame.com/play-for-free?ref=Jeffijoe).\n\n# Author\n\nJeff Hansen - [@Jeffijoe](https://twitter.com/Jeffijoe)\n"
