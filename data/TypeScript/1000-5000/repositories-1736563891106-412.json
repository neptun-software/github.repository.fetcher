Your effort will be very much appreciated.\n*If you need help*, take a look at <<HELP.adoc#,our dedicated document>>.\n\n[[tickets]]\n== Opening Tickets\n\nAfter you've read the relevant sections of this document, you can open a ticket\nthrough GitHub here:\nhttps://github.com/meliorence/react-native-render-html/issues/new/choose. Make\nsure you follow the appropriate template.\n\n[NOTE]\nThe art of filling good reports is as important and valued as the art of\nproducing readable, maintainable code. Developers tend to rush when filling\nreports because their initiative stems from a place of frustration. This is\nvery well understandable, but ineffective regarding the goal of solving one's\nproblem. Consider the __time investment / benefits__ ratio: by filling a detailed\nbug report, you might have committed a chunk of your\nvaluable time. But **your chances of having a fix merged rapidly have considerably\nincreased**.\n\n[WARNING]\nBy not following our guidelines and templates, you risk having your ticket\nclosed without notice. Sorry about that... our time is also valuable, and we\ncannot help you if you don't help us in the process!\n\n=== Submitting a Bug\n\n[CAUTION]\nIf you would like to report a problem, take a look around and see if someone\nalready opened an issue about it (see <<HELP.adoc#,HELP>> document). If you a\nare certain this is a new, unreported bug, you can submit a bug report\nhttps://github.com/meliorence/react-native-render-html/issues/new/choose[by\nopening a new issue].\n\nThe most important quality of your bug report is *reproducibility*. It means we\ncan easily reproduce and investigate the bug to fix it as quickly as possible.\nIf you've never heard of a “minimal reproducible example”, take a look at this\nguide: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve. Bellow is a table of different\ntypes of reproductions:\n\n[TIP]\nIf you add screencasts, screenshots, debugging information, or any insights\nthat can help us identify the failure as quickly as possible, you can consider\neach a bonus :zap:.\n\n[cols=3*,options=header,frame=topbot]\n|===\n|Reproduction\n|Efficiency\n|Information\n\n|Regression Test\n|:zap::zap::zap::zap:\n|Offering a PR with a Test which reproduces the issue is the most efficient way\nto have your bug fixed rapidly. More details on the *<<bug-repro,dedicated\nsection>>*. You are still required to open a bug report ticket, but you will be able\nto skip many steps.\n\n|Snack\n|:zap::zap::zap:\n|A *Snack* is very convenient for you and for us. You can\nhttps://snack.expo.io/@jsamr/rnrhtml-template[*start from\nour template*]. *Make sure you set the appropriate version of this library.*\n\n|Git\n|:zap::zap::zap:\n|A Git reproduction is as efficient as a Snack, albeit it might be a little\nextra work for you.\n\n|Code Snippet\n|:zap:\n|A snippet is better than nothing, but we don't consider it __high quality__\nand might take more time to investigate. Please consider put your snippet into\na *Snack*. I will take you 2 minutes to configure.\n|===\n\nSecond important thing: try-out the latest version, including pre-releases! For\nmore information on this topic, read the\nhttps://github.com/meliorence/react-native-render-html#versions[Versions section\nof the README]. If you can try `master` branch, that would be even better, but\nwe don't require it because it could contain breaking changes. To do\nso, simply run the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm install \"github:meliorence/react-native-render-html#master\"\n```\n\n[[features]]\n=== Proposing a Feature or Enhancement\n\n* Feature requests and enhancements **must** be submitted https://native-html.canny.io/features[in our Canny feature tracker].\n* You can, *in addition*, consider <<rfc,writing an RFC>> and offering it as a PR.\n\n[TIP]\nYou or your company need a feature? Consider https://github.com/sponsors/jsamr[sponsorship or consultancy] and it will be delivered ASAP.\n\n== Pull Requests\n\n[NOTE]\nWe require some criterion to accept a pull request. But don't worry, we're also\nwilling to help. You're encouraged to start a\nhttps://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/[Github draft]\nand we will be glad to help you build it and make it comply with our\nrequirements. If you have any question or need advise regarding your\ncontribution, you can also ping us in our https://discord.gg/MwrZmBb[Discord\n#contributing channel].\n\n=== Bug Fixes\n\nIf your PR fixes a bug, you are required to implement a regression test to\nprove your fix is effective, but *don't worry, we will help you*. The simplest\nway is to look at {rnrh-test-folder}[our test folder] and copy/paste an existing __regression\ntest__ to get inspiration. You are also advised to read our <<DEVELOPING.adoc#, developing guide>>. If you know what the test should do, but don't\nknow how to implement the test, you can add a \"Testing Plan\" section in the\nbody of your PR.\n\n\n[[bug-repro]]\n=== Bug Reproduction\n\nWhen you submit a bug ticket, the fastest path for us to resolve the issue is\nby providing a bug reproduction. Take a glance at {rnrh-test-folder}[our test folder] and get\ninspiration by looking at __regression tests__. You are also advised to read our <<DEVELOPING.adoc#, developing guide>>. The PR is ready __when the\ntest fails__.\n\n=== Features\n\n[NOTE]\nWe recommend you use the\nhttps://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/[draft Github option]\nwhen you start a Feature PR!\n\nIf your PR provides new features, it means that the API of this library will\nlikely change. You will be required to test the new\nfeature.  Take a look at {rnrh-test-folder}[our test folder]. You are also advised to read our <<DEVELOPING.adoc#, developing guide>>. If you're lost, we will be glad to help you, either on\ndiscord or within the PR on GitHub.\n\n\n[[rfc]]\n=== Request For Comments\n\n[NOTE]\nRFC are propositions for new methods, behaviors and other API capabilities, or\nthe exploration of an algorithmic challenge that is specific to this library.\nThese are not Internet Society's RFCs! We don't have a rich multi-stage process. An\nRFC is either a draft, in discussion, or adopted (merged). We thereafter use\nversioning to polish and enhance those specifications.\n\nRFC purpose is to offer drafts for new ideas which goes relatively in depth\nregarding the issues, consequences and caveats of a peculiar feature. We don't\nhave strict requirements, but the structure should loosely resemble the\nfollowing:\n\n1. Problem Frame (what is the context and which issues this enhancement or\nfeature will address).\n2. Requirements (what are the behaviors required for this feature to be\nsupported?).\n\nYou can take a look at drafts in\nhttps://github.com/meliorence/react-native-render-html/tree/master/rfc[the `rfc`\nfolder] for inspiration.\n\n[NOTE]\nWe require RFCs to be written in *AsciiDoc*. If you know\nmarkdown, it is very easy to pick and it ends-up much more powerful and\nversatile. Their documentation is of excellent quality, as proven by their\nhttps://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/[writer's guide].\n\n=== Other\n\nFor other type of contributions (documentation, enhancements), we don't __a\npriori__ require anything particular."

This library is not meant for an exact compliance with the standard. First\nand foremost, because React Native imposes some constraints that we cannot\novercome, and secondly, because the philosophy of the library is to let you\ncustomize rendering to fit your needs rather than strictly honoring the\nstandards. Finally, because the https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-webview[`react-native-webview`] library fits this purpose.\n\nHowever, we are always open to feature requests and propositions for\nenhancement regarding better compliance with the standards.

MINORs convey new\n  features while patches convey fixes.\n\nIf you have a doubt, read the Semantic Versioning standard,\nv2.0 at https://semver.org. It's not that long.\n\n[[branching]]\n== Branching\n\n=== Development branches\n\nThe branching system is highly coupled with Semantic Versioning. We support\nbackporting fixes to different MAJOR versions. To do so, we adopt the following\nconventions:\n\n- `master` is the ultimate development branch for the upmost MAJOR, accepting\n  PRs, fixes, new features... etc.\n- Any development branch for a MAJOR strictly inferior to master's MAJOR will\nhave a name composed with the following pattern:\n+\n```\ndev/MAJOR.x\n```\n\nThese development branches will be used to cherry-pick backports from `master`.\n\n=== Release branches\n\nNOTE: Release branches target a MAJOR.MINOR release. Patches within\nthis minor will get merged. This is especially useful to hold references to\ndocumentation for a specific release while accounting for the fact it can be a\nmoving target.\n\nRelease branches have a name composed with the following pattern:\n\n```\nrelease/MAJOR.MINOR\n```\n\n=== Transient branches\n\n[WARNING]\nTransient branches should never be worked on by more than one person at a\ntime, unless authors are completely aware of their collaboration.\n\n[NOTE]\nTransient branches should be based on master and rebased before merging to `master`.\nThey should be deleted after merged to master.\n\nThese branches are meant for short-term development cycles such as pull\nrequests. These branches' names should follow the following pattern:\n\n```\nPREFIX/QUALIFIER\n```\n\n[cols=4*,options=header,frame=topbot]\n|===\n|PREFIX\n|Description\n|QUALIFIER\n|Examples\n\n|`feat`\n|New features\n|The issue number this feat will cover, or a slug summarizing the feature\n|`feat/001` +\n`feat/inline-css`\n\n|`fix`\n|Bug fixes\n|The issue number this fix will address, or a slug summarizing this fix.\n|`fix/001` +\n`fix/start-attribute`\n\n|`reg`\n|(Anti) regression tests\n|The issue number this test will reproduce.\n|`reg/001`\n\n|`tests`\n|Coverage or other tests\n|A slug summarizing the areas covered by the test(s).\n|`tests/image-renderer`\n\n|`rfc`\n|Requests For Comments\n|A slug summarizing the area covered by the RFC.\n|`rfc/whitespaces`\n\n|`opt`\n|Optimizations\n|The issue number this optimization will address, or a slug summarizing the\noptimization.\n|`opt/103` +\n`opt/rendering-cycles`\n|===\n\n== Publishing\n\n[CAUTION]\nPre-releases should be prepared from `master` or `dev/MINOR.x` (cf,\nxref:branching[Branching]).\n\nThe publishing cycle entails pre-releases, which are usually tagged on npm with\n`next`. The table below describes the relationship between releases names,\nnpm tags and their semantics.

Eventually, new fixes and optimizations can be merged.\n\n|Stable\n|`latest` +\n`release/MAJOR.MINOR`\n|_none_\n|Stable releases.\n|===\n\n=== Pre-releases\n\n==== Prerequisites\n\n- [ ] Tests are passing;\n- [ ] I'm on the `master` (or a `dev/MINOR.x` branch if I'm backporting fixes);\n- [ ] If the release is frozen, I've updated the changelog with a `next` entry;\n- [ ] I have changed the version in  `package.json`;\n- [ ] I have commited my changes;\n- [ ] I have tagged this very commit with `v<semver>`, replacing `<semver>`\nwith the version in `package.json`.\n\n==== Steps\n\nWe use https://github.com/release-it/release-it[release-it] utility to release\nnew versions. You will need to provide a GIHUB_TOKEN environment variable to\npublish the release on Github.\n\n1. Run\n+\n```\nyarn render-html release-it --preRelease=beta --npm.tag=next \n```\n+\nfor a beta or\n+\n```\nyarn render-html release-it --preRelease=alpha --npm.tag=unstable\n```\n+\nfor an alpha release. Eventually, edit manually the CHANGELOG.md file to\nadd extra information.\n2. If this is the first pre-release, create a new issue on Github to be pinned,\nasking for feedback for this pre-release. This issue must have the `release`\nlabel.\n3. Release the new documentation website with\n+\n```\nyarn publish:website\n```\n+\nYou will need to pass a USER environment variable to this command if your github user has a different name than your logged system user.\n4. Release the new discovery app with\n+\n```\nyarn publish:discovery\n```\n\n\n=== Releases\n\n==== Prerequisites\n\n- [ ] Tests are passing;\n- [ ] I'm on the `master` (or a `dev/MINOR.x` branch if I'm backporting fixes);\n- [ ] I've updated the changelog with a `<version>` entry;\n- [ ] I have changed the version in `package.json`;\n- [ ] I have commited my changes;\n- [ ] I have tagged this very commit with `v<semver>`, replacing `<semver>`\nwith the version in `package.json`.\n\n==== Steps\n\nWe use https://github.com/release-it/release-it[release-it] utility to release\nnew versions.

Release the new discovery app with\n+\n```\nyarn publish:discovery\n```\n\n\n*If this publication was a backport (from a `dev/MINOR.x` branch), you must\ncherry-pick the version commit into master.*\n\nA. Checkout and pull master\n+\n```\ngit switch master\ngit pull\n```\nB. Cherry-pick the commit you have previously made on `dev/MINOR.x` branch.\n+\n```\ngit cherry-pick <commit-id>\n```\nIf you must resolve conflicts, make sure:\n\n- [ ] The new changelog entry is positionned in the approriate order;\n- [ ] The `package.json` version remains the upmost.\n"
