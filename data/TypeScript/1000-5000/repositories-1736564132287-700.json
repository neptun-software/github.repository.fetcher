Conditions\n\nSections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted\nin Section 2.1.\n\n3. Responsibilities\n-------------------\n\n3.1. Distribution of Source Form\n\nAll distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\nModifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under\nthe terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\nCode Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\nLicense, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\nattempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\nForm.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\nprovided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\nthe Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\nSoftware with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\nCovered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\nLicense permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\nunder the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\nthe Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\nSoftware under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\nLicense(s).\n\n3.4. Notices\n\nYou may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\n(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\nor limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of\nthe Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to\nthe extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n\n3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n\nYou may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\nSoftware. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\nbehalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\nsuch warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\nYou alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\nliability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\ndisclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\njurisdiction.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\nLicense with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to\nstatute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\nthe terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\ndescribe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must\nbe placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered\nSoftware under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute\nor regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a\nrecipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n\n5. Termination\n--------------\n\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically\nif You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become\ncompliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular\nContributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\nContributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\nongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\nnon-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\ncome back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular\nContributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\nnotifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\nfirst time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\nfrom such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\nYour receipt of the notice.\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\ninfringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\ncounter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\ndirectly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\nYou by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n\n5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all\nend user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which\nhave been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License\nprior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n************************************************************************\n*                                                                      *\n*  6.

Ultimately your browser bundle will not include `getStaticProps` at all, or any of the functions it uses only on the server, so `serialize` will be removed from the browser bundle entirely.\n\n> **IMPORTANT**: Be very careful about putting any `next-mdx-remote` code into a separate \"utilities\" file. Doing so will likely cause issues with Next.js' code splitting abilities - it must be able to cleanly determine what is used only on the server side and what should be left in the client bundle. If you put `next-mdx-remote` code into an external utilities file and something is broken, remove it and start from the simple example above before filing an issue.\n\n### Additional Examples\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Parsing Frontmatter</summary>\n\nMarkdown in general is often paired with frontmatter, and normally this means adding some extra custom processing to the way markdown is handled. To address this, `next-mdx-remote` comes with optional parsing of frontmatter, which can be enabled by passing `parseFrontmatter: true` to `serialize`.\n\nHere's what that looks like:\n\n```jsx\nimport { serialize } from 'next-mdx-remote/serialize'\nimport { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote'\n\nimport Test from '../components/test'\n\nconst components = { Test }\n\nexport default function TestPage({ mdxSource }) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"wrapper\">\n      <h1>{mdxSource.frontmatter.title}</h1>\n      <MDXRemote {...mdxSource} components={components} />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  // MDX text - can be from a local file, database, anywhere\n  const source = `---\ntitle: Test\n---\n\nSome **mdx** text, with a component <Test name={frontmatter.title}/>\n  `\n\n  const mdxSource = await serialize(source, { parseFrontmatter: true })\n  return { props: { mdxSource } }\n}\n```\n\n_[`vfile-matter`](https://github.com/vfile/vfile-matter) is used to parse the frontmatter._\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Passing custom data to a component with `scope`</summary>\n\n`<MDXRemote />` accepts a `scope` prop, which makes all of the values available for use in your MDX.\n\nEach key/value pair in the `scope` argument will be exposed as a javascript variable. So, for example, you could imagine if you had a scope like `{ foo: 'bar' }`, it would be interpreted as `const foo = 'bar'`.\n\nThis specifically means that you need to make sure that key names in your `scope` argument are valid javascript variable names. For example, passing in `{ 'my-variable-name': 'bar' }` would generate an _error_, because the key name is not a valid javascript variable name.\n\nIt's also important to note that `scope` variables must be consumed as _arguments to a component_, they cannot be rendered in the middle of text. This is shown in the example below.\n\n```jsx\nimport { serialize } from 'next-mdx-remote/serialize'\nimport { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote'\n\nimport Test from '../components/test'\n\nconst components = { Test }\nconst data = { product: 'next' }\n\nexport default function TestPage({ source }) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"wrapper\">\n      <MDXRemote {...source} components={components} scope={data} />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  // MDX text - can be from a local file, database, anywhere\n  const source =\n    'Some **mdx** text, with a component using a scope variable <Test product={product} />'\n  const mdxSource = await serialize(source)\n  return { props: { source: mdxSource } }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Passing `scope` into the `serialize` function instead</summary>\n\nYou can also pass custom data into `serialize`, which will then pass the value through and make it available from its result. By spreading the result from `source` into `<MDXRemote />`, the data will be made available.\n\nNote that any scope values passed into `serialize` need to be serializable, meaning passing functions or components is not possible. Additionally, any key named in the `scope` argument must be valid javascript variable names. If you need to pass custom scope that is not serializable, you can pass `scope` directly to `<MDXRemote />` where it's rendered. There is an example of how to do this above this section.\n\n```jsx\nimport { serialize } from 'next-mdx-remote/serialize'\nimport { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote'\n\nimport Test from '../components/test'\n\nconst components = { Test }\nconst data = { product: 'next' }\n\nexport default function TestPage({ source }) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"wrapper\">\n      <MDXRemote {...source} components={components} />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  // MDX text - can be from a local file, database, anywhere\n  const source =\n    'Some **mdx** text, with a component <Test product={product} />'\n  const mdxSource = await serialize(source, { scope: data })\n  return { props: { source: mdxSource } }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>\n    Custom components from <code>MDXProvider</code><a id=\"mdx-provider\"></a>\n  </summary>\n\nIf you want to make components available to any `<MDXRemote />` being rendered in your application, you can use [`<MDXProvider />`](https://mdxjs.com/docs/using-mdx/#mdx-provider) from `@mdx-js/react`.\n\n```jsx\n// pages/_app.jsx\nimport { MDXProvider } from '@mdx-js/react'\n\nimport Test from '../components/test'\n\nconst components = { Test }\n\nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return (\n    <MDXProvider components={components}>\n      <Component {...pageProps} />\n    </MDXProvider>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```jsx\n// pages/test.jsx\nimport { serialize } from 'next-mdx-remote/serialize'\nimport { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote'\n\nexport default function TestPage({ source }) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"wrapper\">\n      <MDXRemote {...source} />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  // MDX text - can be from a local file, database, anywhere\n  const source = 'Some **mdx** text, with a component <Test />'\n  const mdxSource = await serialize(source)\n  return { props: { source: mdxSource } }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>\n    Component names with dot (e.g. <code>motion.div</code>)\n  </summary>\n\nComponent names that contain a dot (`.`), such as those from `framer-motion`, can be rendered the same way as other custom components, just pass `motion` in your components object.\n\n```js\nimport { motion } from 'framer-motion'\n\nimport { MDXProvider } from '@mdx-js/react'\nimport { serialize } from 'next-mdx-remote/serialize'\nimport { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote'\n\nexport default function TestPage({ source }) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"wrapper\">\n      <MDXRemote {...source} components={{ motion }} />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  // MDX text - can be from a local file, database, anywhere\n  const source = `Some **mdx** text, with a component:\n\n<motion.div animate={{ x: 100 }} />`\n  const mdxSource = await serialize(source)\n  return { props: { source: mdxSource } }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Lazy hydration</summary>\n\nLazy hydration defers hydration of the components on the client. This is an optimization technique to improve the initial load of your application, but may introduce unexpected delays in interactivity for any dynamic content within your MDX content.\n\n_Note: this will add an additional wrapping `div` around your rendered MDX, which is necessary to avoid [hydration mismatches during render](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#hydrate)._\n\n```jsx\nimport { serialize } from 'next-mdx-remote/serialize'\nimport { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote'\n\nimport Test from '../components/test'\n\nconst components = { Test }\n\nexport default function TestPage({ source }) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"wrapper\">\n      <MDXRemote {...source} components={components} lazy />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  // MDX text - can be from a local file, database, anywhere\n  const source = 'Some **mdx** text, with a component <Test />'\n  const mdxSource = await serialize(source)\n  return { props: { source: mdxSource } }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n## APIs\n\nThis library exposes a function and a component, `serialize` and `<MDXRemote />`. These two are purposefully isolated into their own files -- `serialize` is intended to be run **server-side**, so within `getStaticProps`, which runs on the server/at build time. `<MDXRemote />` on the other hand is intended to be run on the client side, in the browser.\n\n- **`serialize(source: string, { mdxOptions?: object, scope?: object, parseFrontmatter?: boolean })`**\n\n  **`serialize`** consumes a string of MDX. It can also optionally be passed options which are [passed directly to MDX](https://mdxjs.com/docs/extending-mdx/), and a scope object that can be included in the MDX scope. The function returns an object that is intended to be passed into `<MDXRemote />` directly.\n\n  ```ts\n  serialize(\n    // Raw MDX contents as a string\n    '# hello, world',\n    // Optional parameters\n    {\n      // made available to the arguments of any custom MDX component\n      scope: {},\n      // MDX's available options, see the MDX docs for more info.\n      // https://mdxjs.com/packages/mdx/#compilefile-options\n      mdxOptions: {\n        remarkPlugins: [],\n        rehypePlugins: [],\n        format: 'mdx',\n      },\n      // Indicates whether or not to parse the frontmatter from the MDX source\n      parseFrontmatter: false,\n    }\n  )\n  ```\n\n  Visit <https://mdxjs.com/packages/mdx/#compilefile-options> for available `mdxOptions`.\n\n- **`<MDXRemote compiledSource={string} components?={object} scope?={object} lazy?={boolean} />`**\n\n  **`<MDXRemote />`** consumes the output of `serialize` as well as an optional components argument. Its result can be rendered directly into your component. To defer hydration of the content and immediately serve the static markup, pass the `lazy` prop.\n\n  ```ts\n  <MDXRemote {...source} components={components} />\n  ```\n\n### Replacing default components\n\nRendering will use [`MDXProvider`](https://mdxjs.com/docs/using-mdx/#mdx-provider) under the hood. This means you can replace HTML tags by custom components. Those components are listed in MDXJS [Table of components](https://mdxjs.com/table-of-components/).\n\nAn example use case is rendering the content with your preferred styling library.\n\n```jsx\nimport { Typography } from \"@material-ui/core\";\n\nconst components = { Test, h2: (props) => <Typography variant=\"h2\" {...props} /> }\n...\n```\n\nIf you prefer, you can also wrap your entire application in an `<MDXProvider />` instead of passing your components directly to `<MDXRemote />`. See the [example](#mdx-provider) above.\n\nNote: `th/td` won't work because of the \"/\" in the component name.\n\n## Background & Theory\n\nThere isn't really a good default way to load MDX files in a Next.js app. Previously, we wrote [`next-mdx-enhanced`](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-enhanced) in order to be able to render your MDX files into layouts and import their front matter to create index pages.\n\nThis workflow from `next-mdx-enhanced` was fine, but introduced a few limitations that we have removed with `next-mdx-remote`:\n\n- **The file content must be local.** You cannot store MDX files in another repo, a database, etc. For a large enough operation, there will end up being a split between those authoring content and those working on presentation of the content. Overlapping these two concerns in the same repo makes a more difficult workflow for everyone.\n- **You are bound to filesystem-based routing.** Your pages are generated with urls according to their locations. Or maybe you remap them using `exportPathMap`, which creates confusion for authors. Regardless, moving pages around in any way breaks things -- either the page's url or your `exportPathMap` configuration.\n- **You will end up running into performance issues.** Webpack is a JavaScript bundler, forcing it to load hundreds/thousands of pages of text content will blow out your memory requirements. Webpack stores each page as a distinct object with a large amount of metadata. One of our implementations with a couple hundred pages hit more than 8GB of memory required to compile the site. Builds took more than 25 minutes.\n- **You will be limited in the ways you are able to structure relational data.** Organizing content into dynamic, related categories is difficult when your entire data structure is front matter parsed into javascript objects and held in memory.\n\nSo, `next-mdx-remote` changes the entire pattern so that you load your MDX content not through an import, but rather through `getStaticProps` or `getServerProps` -- you know, the same way you would load any other data. The library provides the tools to serialize and hydrate the MDX content in a manner that is performant. This removes all of the limitations listed above, and does so at a significantly lower cost -- `next-mdx-enhanced` is a very heavy library with a lot of custom logic and [some annoying limitations](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-enhanced/issues/17). Our informal testing has shown build times reduced by 50% or more.\n\nSince this project was initially created, Kent C. Dodds has made a similar project, [`mdx-bundler`](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler). This library supports imports and exports within a MDX file (as long as you manually read each imported file and pass its contents) and automatically processes frontmatter. If you have a lot of files that all import and use different components, you may benefit from using `mdx-bundler`, as `next-mdx-remote` currently only allows components to be imported and made available across all pages. It's important to note that this functionality comes with a cost though - `mdx-bundler`'s output is at least 400% larger than the output from `next-mdx-remote` for basic markdown content.\n\n### How Can I Build A Blog With This?\n\nData has shown that 99% of use cases for all developer tooling are building unnecessarily complex personal blogs. Just kidding. But seriously, if you are trying to build a blog for personal or small business use, consider just using normal HTML and CSS. You definitely do not need to be using a heavy full-stack JavaScript framework to make a simple blog. You'll thank yourself later when you return to make an update in a couple years and there haven't been 10 breaking releases to all of your dependencies.\n\nIf you really insist though, check out [our official Next.js example implementation](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-mdx-remote). 💖\n\n## Caveats\n\n### Environment Targets\n\nThe code generated by `next-mdx-remote`, which is used to actually render the MDX targets browsers with module support. If you need to support older browsers, consider transpiling the `compiledSource` output from `serialize`.\n\n### `import` / `export`\n\n`import` and `export` statements cannot be used **inside** an MDX file. If you need to use components in your MDX files, they should be provided as a prop to `<MDXRemote />`.\n\nHopefully this makes sense, since in order to work, imports must be relative to a file path, and this library allows content to be loaded from anywhere, rather than only loading local content from a set file path. As for exports, the MDX content is treated as data, not a **module**, so there is no way for us to access any value which may be exported from the MDX passed to `next-mdx-remote`.\n\n## Security\n\nThis library evaluates a string of JavaScript on the client side, which is how it MDXRemotes the MDX content. Evaluating a string into javascript can be a dangerous practice if not done carefully, as it can enable XSS attacks. It's important to make sure that you are only passing the `mdxSource` input generated by the `serialize` function to `<MDXRemote />`, as instructed in the documentation. **Do not pass user input into `<MDXRemote />`.**\n\nIf you have a CSP on your website that disallows code evaluation via `eval` or `new Function()`, you will need to loosen that restriction in order to utilize `next-mdx-remote`, which can be done using [`unsafe-eval`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/script-src#common_sources).\n\n## TypeScript\n\nThis project does include native types for TypeScript use. Both `serialize` and `<MDXRemote />` have types normally as you'd expect, and the library also exports a type which you can use to type the result of `getStaticProps`.\n\n- `MDXRemoteSerializeResult<TScope = Record<string, unknown>>`: Represents the return value of `serialize`. The `TScope` generic type can be passed to represent the type of the scoped data you pass in.\n\nBelow is an example of a simple implementation in TypeScript. You may not need to implement the types exactly in this way for every configuration of TypeScript - this example is just a demonstration of where the types could be applied if needed.\n\n```tsx\nimport type { GetStaticProps } from 'next'\nimport { serialize } from 'next-mdx-remote/serialize'\nimport { MDXRemote, type MDXRemoteSerializeResult } from 'next-mdx-remote'\nimport ExampleComponent from './example'\n\nconst components = { ExampleComponent }\n\ninterface Props {\n  mdxSource: MDXRemoteSerializeResult\n}\n\nexport default function ExamplePage({ mdxSource }: Props) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <MDXRemote {...mdxSource} components={components} />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps<{\n  mdxSource: MDXRemoteSerializeResult\n}> = async () => {\n  const mdxSource = await serialize('some *mdx* content: <ExampleComponent />')\n  return { props: { mdxSource } }\n}\n```\n\n## React Server Components (RSC) & Next.js `app` Directory Support\n\nUsage of `next-mdx-remote` within server components, and specifically within Next.js's `app` directory, is supported by importing from `next-mdx-remote/rsc`. Previously, the serialization and render steps were separate, but going forward RSC makes this separation unnecessary.\n\nSome noteworthy differences:\n\n- `<MDXRemote />` now accepts a `source` prop, instead of accepting the serialized output from `next-mdx-remote/serialize`\n- Custom components can no longer be provided by using the `MDXProvider` context from `@mdx-js/react`, as RSC does not support React Context\n- To access frontmatter outside of your MDX when passing `parseFrontmatter: true`, use the `compileMdx` method exposed from `next-mdx-remote/rsc`\n- The `lazy` prop is no longer supported, as the rendering happens on the server\n- `<MDXRemote />` must be rendered on the server, as it is now an async component. Client components can be rendered as part of the MDX markup\n\nFor more information on RSC, check out the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components).\n\n### Examples\n\n_Assuming usage in a Next.js 13+ application using the `app` directory._\n\n#### Basic\n\n```tsx\nimport { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote/rsc'\n\n// app/page.js\nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <MDXRemote\n      source={`# Hello World\n\n      This is from Server Components!\n      `}\n    />\n  )\n}\n```\n\n#### Loading state\n\n```tsx\nimport { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote/rsc'\n\n// app/page.js\nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    // Ideally this loading spinner would ensure there is no layout shift,\n    // this is an example for how to provide such a loading spinner.\n    // In Next.js you can also use `loading.js` for this.\n    <Suspense fallback={<>Loading...</>}>\n      <MDXRemote\n        source={`# Hello World\n\n        This is from Server Components!\n        `}\n      />\n    </Suspense>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n#### Custom Components\n\n```tsx\n// components/mdx-remote.js\nimport { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote/rsc'\n\nconst components = {\n  h1: (props) => (\n    <h1 {...props} className=\"large-text\">\n      {props.children}\n    </h1>\n  ),\n}\n\nexport function CustomMDX(props) {\n  return (\n    <MDXRemote\n      {...props}\n      components={{ ...components, ...(props.components || {}) }}\n    />\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```tsx\n// app/page.js\nimport { CustomMDX } from '../components/mdx-remote'\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <CustomMDX\n      // h1 now renders with `large-text` className\n      source={`# Hello World\n      This is from Server Components!\n    `}\n    />\n  )\n}\n```\n\n#### Access Frontmatter outside of MDX\n\n```tsx\n// app/page.js\nimport { compileMDX } from 'next-mdx-remote/rsc'\n\nexport default async function Home() {\n  // Optionally provide a type for your frontmatter object\n  const { content, frontmatter } = await compileMDX<{ title: string }>({\n    source: `---\ntitle: RSC Frontmatter Example\n---\n# Hello World\nThis is from Server Components!\n`,\n    options: { parseFrontmatter: true },\n  })\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>{frontmatter.title}</h1>\n      {content}\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## Alternatives\n\n`next-mdx-remote` is opinionated in what features it supports. If you need additional features not provided by `next-mdx-remote`, here are a few alternatives to consider:\n\n- [`mdx-bundler`](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler)\n- [`next-mdx-remote-client`](https://github.com/ipikuka/next-mdx-remote-client)\n- [`remote-mdx`](https://github.com/devjiwonchoi/remote-mdx)\n\n### You Might Not Need `next-mdx-remote`\n\nIf you're using React Server Components and just trying to use basic MDX with custom components, you don't need anything other than the core MDX library.\n\n```js\nimport { compile, run } from '@mdx-js/mdx'\nimport * as runtime from 'react/jsx-runtime'\nimport ClientComponent from './components/client'\n\n// MDX can be retrieved from anywhere, such as a file or a database.\nconst mdxSource = `# Hello, world!\n<ClientComponent />\n`\n\nexport default async function Page() {\n  // Compile the MDX source code to a function body\n  const code = String(\n    await compile(mdxSource, { outputFormat: 'function-body' })\n  )\n  // You can then either run the code on the server, generating a server\n  // component, or you can pass the string to a client component for\n  // final rendering.\n\n  // Run the compiled code with the runtime and get the default export\n  const { default: MDXContent } = await run(code, {\n    ...runtime,\n    baseUrl: import.meta.url,\n  })\n\n  // Render the MDX content, supplying the ClientComponent as a component\n  return <MDXContent components={{ ClientComponent }} />\n}\n```\n\nYou can also simplify this approach with `evaluate`, which compiles and runs code in a single call if you don't plan on passing the compiled string to a database or client component.\n\n```js\nimport { evaluate } from '@mdx-js/mdx'\nimport * as runtime from 'react/jsx-runtime'\nimport ClientComponent from './components/client'\n\n// MDX can be retrieved from anywhere, such as a file or a database.\nconst mdxSource = `\nexport const title = \"MDX Export Demo\";\n\n# Hello, world!\n<ClientComponent />\n\nexport function MDXDefinedComponent() {\n  return <p>MDX-defined component</p>;\n}\n`\n\nexport default async function Page() {\n  // Run the compiled code\n  const {\n    default: MDXContent,\n    MDXDefinedComponent,\n    ...rest\n  } = await evaluate(mdxSource, runtime)\n\n  console.log(rest) // logs { title: 'MDX Export Demo' }\n\n  // Render the MDX content, supplying the ClientComponent as a component, and\n  // the exported MDXDefinedComponent.\n  return (\n    <>\n      <MDXContent components={{ ClientComponent }} />\n      <MDXDefinedComponent />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## License\n\n[Mozilla Public License Version 2.0](./LICENSE)\n"
