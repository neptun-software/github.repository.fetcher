Correction\n\n**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed\nunprofessional or unwelcome in the community.\n\n**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing\nclarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the\nbehavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.\n\n### 2. Warning\n\n**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series\nof actions.\n\n**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No\ninteraction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with\nthose enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This\nincludes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels\nlike social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or\npermanent ban.\n\n### 3. Temporary Ban\n\n**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including\nsustained inappropriate behavior.\n\n**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public\ncommunication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or\nprivate interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction\nwith those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.\nViolating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.\n\n### 4. Permanent Ban\n\n**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community\nstandards, including sustained inappropriate behavior,  harassment of an\nindividual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.\n\n**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within\nthe community.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage],\nversion 2.0, available at\nhttps://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html.\n\nCommunity Impact Guidelines were inspired by [Mozilla's code of conduct\nenforcement ladder](https://github.com/mozilla/diversity).\n\n[homepage]: https://www.contributor-covenant.org\n\nFor answers to common questions about this code of conduct, see the FAQ at\nhttps://www.contributor-covenant.org/faq.

After discussion, we will decide together whether the feature should be developed.\n\nWe will consider whether to merge this feature into the master branch from three perspectives: `scope of code impact`, `practicality of the feature`, and `estimated number of applicable users`.\n\nOtherwise, unrestrained addition of features will inevitably lead to the continuous bloating of software functionality, which will sooner or later result in very serious security vulnerabilities.\n\n### Iterating Old Features\n\nFixing or upgrading an existing feature, **without exceeding the responsibilities of the old feature**, **does not require opening an issue for discussion**. You can directly submit a Pull Request, and after testing and Code Review, it will be merged.\n\n**Code in open-source projects often exists for several years or even decades. Due to differences in developer habits, implementation approaches, and code styles, we need some rules and constraints to ensure the long-term health of the code. Thank you for your understanding.**\n\n### How to Contribute Code?\n\nPlease refer to the `Development` section in the README.md file.\n\n<br />\n\n## 中文 🌏\n\n### 目的\n\n为了防止功能无节制增长和提交 PR 之后未得到合并浪费工作精力，特此写下这些须知通告。\n\n### 提交新功能\n\n如果你想 `Pull Request` 一个新功能，请先开启一个 `issue` 告知开发者 @unitwk ，我们一起经过讨论之后，再决定这个功能是否应该开发。\n\n我们会从`代码影响范围`，`功能实用性`和`估算的适用群体人数` 三个角度来考虑这个功能是否应该合并到 master 分支。\n\n否则，无节制的新增功能必将导致软件功能不断臃肿，从而迟早会有一天会出现非常严重的安全漏洞。\n\n### 迭代旧功能\n\n修复或升级某个现有的功能，在**不超出旧功能的职责**情况下，**无需开 `issue` 进行讨论**，你可以直接提交 `Pull Request`，在经过测试和 `Code Review`后，都会给予合并。\n\n**开源项目的代码通常会存在几年甚至十年以上，由于每个开发者习惯不同，实现思路不同，代码风格不同，所以我们需要有一定的规则约束来让代码长期健康的活下去，谢谢你的理解。**\n\n### 如何贡献代码？\n\n请阅读 README.MD 文件的 `Development` 段落。\n"

In addition, We are committed to supporting server administrators not only for Minecraft but also for Terraria and various Steam games. Our goal is to foster a thriving and supportive community for game server management.\n\nMCSManager **supports English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese**, with plans to add support for more languages in the future!\n\n**Terminal**\n\n![failed_to_load_screenshot.png](/.github/panel-image.png)\n\n**Instance List**\n\n![failed_to_load_screenshot.png](/.github/panel-instances.png)\n\n**Custom Layout**\n\n![failed_to_load_screenshot.png](/.github/panel-custom-layout.gif)\n\n## Features\n\n1. One-click deployment of `Minecraft` Java/Bedrock Server\n2. Compatible with most `Steam` game servers. (e.g. `Palworld`, `Squad`, `Project Zomboid`, `Terraria`, etc.)\n3. Customizable UI, create your own layout\n4. Supports all images on `Docker Hub`, supports multiple users, and supports commercial services!\n5. Manage multiple servers with a single web interface\n6. The technology stack is simple, and you only need to be good at Typescript to complete the entire MCSManager development\n7. More...\n\n<br />\n\n## Runtime Environment\n\nMCSM supports both `Windows` and `Linux`. The only requirement is `Node.js` and some libraries **for decompression**.\n\nRequire [Node.js 16.20.2](https://nodejs.org/en) or above.\n\n<br />\n\n## Installation\n\n### Windows\n\nFor Windows, We provides packaged executable files:\n\nGo to: [https://mcsmanager.com/](https://mcsmanager.com/)\n\n<br />\n\n### Linux\n\n**One-Command Deployment**\n\n> Script needs to register system services, it requires root permissions.\n\n```bash\nsudo su -c \"wget -qO- https://script.mcsmanager.com/setup.sh | bash\"\n```\n\n**Usage**\n\n```bash\nsystemctl start mcsm-{web,daemon}\nsystemctl stop mcsm-{web,daemon}\n```\n\n- Only supports Ubuntu/Centos/Debian/Archlinux.\n- Installation directory: `/opt/mcsmanager/`.\n\n<br />\n\n**Linux Manual Installation**\n\n- If the installation script failed to execute correctly, you can try install it manually.\n\n```bash\n# Create /opt directory if not already\nmkdir /opt\n# Switch to /opt\ncd /opt/\n# Download Node.js 20.11. If you already have Node.js 16+ installed, ignore this step.\nwget https://nodejs.org/dist/v20.11.0/node-v20.11.0-linux-x64.tar.xz\n# Decompress Node.js source\ntar -xvf node-v20.11.0-linux-x64.tar.xz\n# Add Node.js to system PATH\nln -s /opt/node-v20.11.0-linux-x64/bin/node /usr/bin/node\nln -s /opt/node-v20.11.0-linux-x64/bin/npm /usr/bin/npm\n\n# Prepare MCSM's installation directory\nmkdir /opt/mcsmanager/\ncd /opt/mcsmanager/\n\n# Download MCSManager\nwget https://github.com/MCSManager/MCSManager/releases/latest/download/mcsmanager_linux_release.tar.gz\ntar -zxf mcsmanager_linux_release.tar.gz\n\n# Install dependencies\n./install.sh\n\n# Please open two terminals or screens.\n\n# Start the daemon first.\n./start-daemon.sh\n\n# Start the web interface at the second terminal or screen.\n./start-web.sh\n\n# For web access, go to http://localhost:23333/\n# In general, the web interface will automatically scan and add the local daemon.\n```\n\nThis installation approach does not automatically set up MCSManager as a system service. Therefore, it is necessary to use `screen` for management. For those interested in managing MCSManager through a system service, please refer to our wiki/documentation.\n\n<br />\n\n## Development\n\nThis section is specifically designed for developers. General users may disregard this portion without concern.\n\n### Plugins\n\nWe use \"VS Code\" to develop MCSManager.

MCSManager ofrece una solución centralizada para gestionar múltiples instancias de servidor y proporciona un sistema de permisos multiusuario seguro y confiable. Nos comprometemos a apoyar a los administradores de servidores no solo para Minecraft, sino también para Terraria y varios juegos de Steam. Nuestro objetivo es fomentar una comunidad próspera y de apoyo en la gestión de servidores de juego.\n\nMCSManager **admite inglés, francés, alemán, italiano, japonés, portugués, chino simplificado y chino tradicional**, ¡y planea agregar más idiomas en el futuro!\n\n![failed_to_load_screenshot.png](/.github/panel-image.png)\n\n![failed_to_load_screenshot.png](/.github/panel-instances.png)\n\n## Características\n\n1. Implementación con un clic de servidor `Minecraft` Java/Bedrock.\n2. Compatible con la mayoría de servidores de juegos de `Steam` (p. ej., `Palworld`, `Squad`, `Project Zomboid`, `Terraria`, etc.).\n3. Interfaz personalizable; crea tu propio diseño.\n4. Soporte para virtualización con `Docker`, multiusuario y servicios comerciales.\n5. Gestiona múltiples servidores desde una sola interfaz web.\n6. ¡Y más!\n\n<br />\n\n## Entorno de Ejecución\n\nMCSM es compatible con `Windows` y `Linux`. El único requisito es `Node.js` y algunas librerías **para descompresión**.\n\nRequiere [Node.js 16.20.2](https://nodejs.org/en) o superior.\n\n<br />\n\n## Instalación\n\n### Windows\n\nPara Windows, ofrecemos archivos ejecutables empaquetados:\n\nIr a: [https://mcsmanager.com/](https://mcsmanager.com/)\n\n<br />\n\n### Linux\n\n**Despliegue con un solo comando**\n\n> El script necesita registrar servicios del sistema, requiere permisos de root.\n\n```bash\nsudo su -c \"wget -qO- https://script.mcsmanager.com/setup.sh | bash\"\n```\n\n**Uso**\n\n```bash\nsystemctl start mcsm-{web,daemon}\nsystemctl stop mcsm-{web,daemon}\n```\n\n- Solo compatible con Ubuntu/Centos/Debian/Archlinux.\n- Directorio de instalación: `/opt/mcsmanager/`.\n  \n<br />\n\n**Instalación Manual en Linux**\n\n- Si el script de instalación falla, puedes intentar instalarlo manualmente.\n  \n```bash\n# Crear directorio /opt si no existe\nmkdir /opt\n# Cambiar a /opt\ncd /opt/\n# Descargar Node.js 20.11. Si ya tienes Node.js 16+ instalado, omite este paso.\nwget https://nodejs.org/dist/v20.11.0/node-v20.11.0-linux-x64.tar.xz\n# Descomprimir Node.js\ntar -xvf node-v20.11.0-linux-x64.tar.xz\n# Agregar Node.js al PATH del sistema\nln -s /opt/node-v20.11.0-linux-x64/bin/node /usr/bin/node\nln -s /opt/node-v20.11.0-linux-x64/bin/npm /usr/bin/npm\n\n# Preparar el directorio de instalación de MCSM\nmkdir /opt/mcsmanager/\ncd /opt/mcsmanager/\n\n# Descargar MCSManager\nwget https://github.com/MCSManager/MCSManager/releases/latest/download/mcsmanager_linux_release.tar.gz\ntar -zxf mcsmanager_linux_release.tar.gz\n\n# Instalar dependencias\n./install.sh\n\n# Abrir dos terminales o pantallas.\n\n# Iniciar el daemon primero.\n./start-daemon.sh\n\n# Iniciar la interfaz web en la segunda terminal o pantalla.\n./start-web.sh\n\n# Para acceder a la web, ir a http://localhost:23333/\n# En general, la interfaz web escaneará y añadirá automáticamente el daemon local.\n```\n\nEste método de instalación no configura automáticamente MCSManager como un servicio del sistema. Por lo tanto, es necesario usar `screen` para la administración. Para quienes quieran administrar MCSManager a través de un servicio del sistema, por favor consulta nuestra wiki/documentación.\n\n<br />\n\n## Compatibilidad del Navegador\n\n- Compatible con navegadores modernos como `Chrome`, `Firefox` y `Safari`.\n- El soporte para `IE` ha sido discontinuado.\n\n<br />\n\n## Desarrollo\n\nEsta sección está dirigida específicamente a desarrolladores.

Interface personalizável, crie seu próprio layout\n4. Suporte à virtualização `Docker`, multiusuário e serviços comerciais\n5. Gerencie múltiplos servidores com uma única interface web\n6. E mais...\n\n<br />\n\n## Ambiente de Execução\n\nO MCSM suporta tanto `Windows` quanto `Linux`. O único requisito é `Node.js` e algumas bibliotecas **para descompressão**.\n\nRequer [Node.js 16.20.2](https://nodejs.org/en) ou superior.\n\n<br />\n\n## Instalação\n\n### Windows\n\nPara Windows, fornecemos arquivos executáveis empacotados:\n\nAcesse: [https://mcsmanager.com/](https://mcsmanager.com/)\n\n<br />\n\n### Linux\n\n**Implantação com um Comando**\n\n> O script precisa registrar serviços do sistema, portanto, requer permissões de root.\n\n```bash\nsudo su -c \"wget -qO- https://script.mcsmanager.com/setup.sh | bash\"\n```\n\n**Uso**\n\n```bash\nsystemctl start mcsm-{web,daemon}\nsystemctl stop mcsm-{web,daemon}\n```\n\n- Suporta apenas Ubuntu/Centos/Debian/Archlinux.\n- Diretório de instalação: `/opt/mcsmanager/`.\n\n<br />\n\n**Instalação Manual no Linux**\n\n- Se o script de instalação falhou ao ser executado corretamente, você pode tentar instalar manualmente.\n\n```bash\n# Criar o diretório /opt se ainda não existir\nmkdir /opt\n# Mudar para o diretório /opt\ncd /opt/\n# Baixar o Node.js 20.11. Se você já tiver o Node.js 16+ instalado, ignore este passo.\nwget https://nodejs.org/dist/v20.11.0/node-v20.11.0-linux-x64.tar.xz\n# Descompactar o código-fonte do Node.js\ntar -xvf node-v20.11.0-linux-x64.tar.xz\n# Adicionar o Node.js ao PATH do sistema\nln -s /opt/node-v20.11.0-linux-x64/bin/node /usr/bin/node\nln -s /opt/node-v20.11.0-linux-x64/bin/npm /usr/bin/npm\n\n# Preparar o diretório de instalação do MCSM\nmkdir /opt/mcsmanager/\ncd /opt/mcsmanager/\n\n# Baixar o MCSManager\nwget https://github.com/MCSManager/MCSManager/releases/latest/download/mcsmanager_linux_release.tar.gz\ntar -zxf mcsmanager_linux_release.tar.gz\n\n# Instalar dependências\n./install.sh\n\n# Por favor, abra dois terminais ou telas separadas.\n\n# Inicie o daemon primeiro.\n./start-daemon.sh\n\n# Inicie a interface web no segundo terminal ou tela.\n./start-web.sh\n\n# Para acessar a web, vá para http://localhost:23333/\n# Geralmente, a interface web irá escanear e adicionar automaticamente o daemon local.\n```\n\nEste método de instalação não configura automaticamente o MCSManager como um serviço do sistema. Portanto, é necessário usar `screen` para gerenciamento. Para aqueles interessados em gerenciar o MCSManager por meio de um serviço do sistema, consulte nossa wiki/documentação.\n\n<br />\n\n## Compatibilidade com Navegadores\n\n- Suportado em navegadores modernos, incluindo `Chrome`, `Firefox` e `Safari`.\n- O suporte ao `IE` foi descontinuado.\n\n<br />\n\n## Desenvolvimento\n\nEsta seção é especificamente projetada para desenvolvedores. Usuários comuns podem ignorar esta parte sem preocupações.\n\n### MacOS\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/MCSManager/MCSManager.git\n./install-dependents.sh\n./npm-dev-macos.sh\n```\n\n### Windows\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/MCSManager/MCSManager.git\n./install-dependents.bat\n./npm-dev-windows.bat\n```\n\n### Build Production Version\n\n```bash\n./build.bat # Windows\n./build.sh  # MacOS\n```\n\nEm seguida, você precisará acessar os projetos [PTY](https://github.com/MCSManager/PTY) e [Zip-Tools](https://github.com/MCSManager/Zip-Tools) para baixar os arquivos binários correspondentes e colocá-los no diretório `daemon/lib` para garantir o funcionamento adequado do `Terminal de Emulação` e `Descompressão de Arquivos`.\n\n<br />\n\n## Contribuição de Código\n\nSe você encontrar algum problema ao usar o MCSManager, sinta-se à vontade para [enviar um Issue](https://github.com/MCSManager/MCSManager/issues/new/choose). Alternativamente, você pode fazer um fork do projeto e contribuir diretamente enviando um Pull Request.\n\nPor favor, certifique-se de que qualquer código enviado siga o estilo de codificação existente.
