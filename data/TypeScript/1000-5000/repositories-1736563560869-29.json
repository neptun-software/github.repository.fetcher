We actively welcome your pull requests:\n\n1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.\n2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.\n3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.\n4. Ensure the test suite passes.\n5. Make sure your code lints.\n6. Issue that pull request!\n\n## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License\n\nIn short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.\n\n## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/OneUptime/oneuptime)\n\nWe use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/OneUptime/oneuptime/issues/new); it's that easy!\n\n## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code\n\n**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:\n\n-   A quick summary and/or background\n-   Steps to reproduce\n    -   Be specific!\n    -   Give sample code if you can.\n-   What you expected would happen\n-   What actually happens\n-   Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)\n\n## Use a Consistent Coding Style\n\n-   You can try running `npm run fix` for style unification\n\n## License\n\nBy contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its MIT License.\n"

Whether you need to check the availability of your website, dashboard, API, or any other online resource, OneUptime can alert your team when downtime happens and keep your customers informed with a status page. OneUptime also helps you handle incidents, set up on-call rotations, run tests, secure your services, analyze logs, track performance, and debug errors.\n\nOneUptime replaces multiple tools with one integrated platform:\n\n\n#### Uptime Monitoring\n\nMonitor the availability and response time of your online services from multiple locations around the world. Get notified via email, SMS, Slack, or other channels when something goes wrong. Replace tools like Pingdom.\n\n![Monitoring](/Home/Static/img/readme/monitoring.png?raw=true)\n\n#### Status Pages\n\nCommunicate with your customers and stakeholders during downtime or maintenance. Create a custom-branded status page that shows the current status and history of your services. Replace tools like StatusPage.io.\n\n![Status Pages](/Home/Static/img/readme/statuspages.png?raw=true)\n\n#### Incident Management\n\nManage incidents from start to finish with a collaborative workflow. Create incident reports, assign tasks, update stakeholders, and document resolutions. Replace tools like Incident.io.\n\n![Incident Management](/Home/Static/img/readme/incident-management.png?raw=true)\n\n#### On Call and Alerts\nSchedule on-call shifts for your team and define escalation policies. Ensure that the right person is notified at the right time when an incident occurs. Replace tools like PagerDuty.\n\n![On Call and Alerts](/Home/Static/img/readme/on-call.png?raw=true)\n\n#### Logs Management\n\nCollect, store, and analyze logs from your online services. Search, filter, and visualize log data to gain insights and troubleshoot issues. Replace tools like Loggly.\n\n![Logs Management](/Home/Static/img/readme/logs-management.png?raw=true)\n\n#### Workflows\n\nIntegrate OneUptime with your existing tools and automate your workflows. Integrate with tools like Slack, Jira, GitHub, and 5000+ more.\n\n![Workflows](/Home/Static/img/readme/workflows.png?raw=true)\n\n#### Application Performance Monitoring\n\nMeasure and optimize the performance of your online apps and services. Track key metrics such as traces, response time, throughput, error rate, and user satisfaction. Replace tools like NewRelic and DataDog.\n\n![APM](/Home/Static/img/readme/apm.png?raw=true)\n\n#### Coming Soon\n\n-   **Error Tracking**: Detect and diagnose errors in your online services. Get detailed error reports with stack traces, context, and user feedback. Replace tools like Sentry.\n-   **Reliability Copilot**: Scan your code and fix performance issues and errors automatically. Get recommendations for improving the reliability of your online services.\n\nAll under one platform.\n\n## Get Started for Free with OneUptime Cloud\n\nOneUptime Cloud is the easiest and fastest way to monitor your website uptime and performance.
