          "content": "# Apollo Contributor Guide\n\nExcited about Apollo and want to make it better? We’re excited too!\n\nApollo is a community of developers just like you, striving to create the best tools and libraries around GraphQL. We welcome anyone who wants to contribute or provide constructive feedback, no matter the age or level of experience. If you want to help but don't know where to start, let us know, and we'll find something for you.\n\nOh, and if you haven't already, sign up for the [Apollo Slack](http://www.apollodata.com/#slack).\n\nHere are some ways to contribute to the project, from easiest to most difficult:\n\n* [Reporting bugs](#reporting-bugs)\n* [Improving the documentation](#improving-the-documentation)\n* [Responding to issues](#responding-to-issues)\n* [Small bug fixes](#small-bug-fixes)\n* [Suggesting features](#suggesting-features)\n* [Big pull requests](#big-prs)\n\n## Issues\n\n### Reporting bugs\n\nIf you encounter a bug, please file an issue on GitHub via the repository of the sub-project you think contains the bug. If an issue you have is already reported, please add additional information or add a 👍 reaction to indicate your agreement.\n\nWhile we will try to be as helpful as we can on any issue reported, please include the following to maximize the chances of a quick fix:\n\n1. **Intended outcome:** What you were trying to accomplish when the bug occurred, and as much code as possible related to the source of the problem.\n2. **Actual outcome:** A description of what actually happened, including a screenshot or copy-paste of any related error messages, logs, or other output that might be related. Places to look for information include your browser console, server console, and network logs. Please avoid non-specific phrases like “didn’t work” or “broke”.\n3. **How to reproduce the issue:** Instructions for how the issue can be reproduced by a maintainer or contributor. Be as specific as possible, and only mention what is necessary to reproduce the bug. If possible, try to isolate the exact circumstances in which the bug occurs and avoid speculation over what the cause might be.\n\nCreating a good reproduction really helps contributors investigate and resolve your issue quickly. In many cases, the act of creating a minimal reproduction illuminates that the source of the bug was somewhere outside the library in question, saving time and effort for everyone.\n\n### Improving the documentation\n\nImproving the documentation, examples, and other open source content can be the easiest way to contribute to the library. If you see a piece of content that can be better, open a PR with an improvement, no matter how small! If you would like to suggest a big change or major rewrite, we’d love to hear your ideas but please open an issue for discussion before writing the PR.\n\n### Responding to issues\n\nIn addition to reporting issues, a great way to contribute to Apollo is to respond to other peoples' issues and try to identify the problem or help them work around it. If you’re interested in taking a more active role in this process, please go ahead and respond to issues. And don't forget to say \"Hi\" on Apollo Slack!\n\n### Small bug fixes\n\nFor a small bug fix change (less than 20 lines of code changed), feel free to open a pull request. We’ll try to merge it as fast as possible and ideally publish a new release on the same day. The only requirement is, make sure you also add a test that verifies the bug you are trying to fix.\n\n### Suggesting features\n\nMost of the features in Apollo came from suggestions by you, the community! We welcome any ideas about how to make Apollo  better for your use case. Unless there is overwhelming demand for a feature, it might not get implemented immediately, but please include as much information as possible that will help people have a discussion about your proposal:\n\n1. **Use case:** What are you trying to accomplish, in specific terms? Often, there might already be a good way to do what you need and a new feature is unnecessary, but it’s hard to know without information about the specific use case.\n2. **Could this be a plugin?** In many cases, a feature might be too niche to be included in the core of a library, and is better implemented as a companion package. If there isn’t a way to extend the library to do what you want, could we add additional plugin APIs? It’s important to make the case for why a feature should be part of the core functionality of the library.\n3. **Is there a workaround?** Is this a more convenient way to do something that is already possible, or is there some blocker that makes a workaround unfeasible?\n\nFeature requests will be labeled as such, and we encourage using GitHub issues as a place to discuss new features and possible implementation designs. Please refrain from submitting a pull request to implement a proposed feature until there is consensus that it should be included. This way, you can avoid putting in work that can’t be merged in.\n\nOnce there is a consensus on the need for a new feature, proceed as listed below under “Big PRs”.\n\n## Big PRs\n\nThis includes:\n\n- Big bug fixes\n- New features\n\nFor significant changes to a repository, it’s important to settle on a design before starting on the implementation. This way, we can make sure that major improvements get the care and attention they deserve. Since big changes can be risky and might not always get merged, it’s good to reduce the amount of possible wasted effort by agreeing on an implementation design/plan first.\n\n1. **Open an issue.** Open an issue about your bug or feature, as described above.\n2. **Reach consensus.** Some contributors and community members should reach an agreement that this feature or bug is important, and that someone should work on implementing or fixing it.\n3. **Agree on intended behavior.** On the issue, reach an agreement about the desired behavior. In the case of a bug fix, it should be clear what it means for the bug to be fixed, and in the case of a feature, it should be clear what it will be like for developers to use the new feature.\n4. **Agree on implementation plan.** Write a plan for how this feature or bug fix should be implemented. What modules need to be added or rewritten? Should this be one pull request or multiple incremental improvements? Who is going to do each part?\n5. **Submit PR.** In the case where multiple dependent patches need to be made to implement the change, only submit one at a time. Otherwise, the others might get stale while the first is reviewed and merged. Make sure to avoid “while we’re here” type changes - if something isn’t relevant to the improvement at hand, it should be in a separate PR; this especially includes code style changes of unrelated code.\n6. **Review.** At least one core contributor should sign off on the change before it’s merged. Look at the “code review” section below to learn about factors are important in the code review. If you want to expedite the code being merged, try to review your own code first!\n7. **Merge and release!**\n\n### Code review guidelines\n\nIt’s important that every piece of code in Apollo packages is reviewed by at least one core contributor familiar with that codebase. Here are some things we look for:\n\n1. **Required CI checks pass.** This is a prerequisite for the review, and it is the PR author's responsibility. As long as the tests don’t pass, the PR won't get reviewed.\n2. **Simplicity.** Is this the simplest way to achieve the intended goal? If there are too many files, redundant functions, or complex lines of code, suggest a simpler way to do the same thing. In particular, avoid implementing an overly general solution when a simple, small, and pragmatic fix will do.\n3. **Testing.** Do the tests ensure this code won’t break when other stuff changes around it? When it does break, will the tests added help us identify which part of the library has the problem? Did we cover an appropriate set of edge cases? Look at the test coverage report if there is one. Are all significant code paths in the new code exercised at least once?\n4. **No unnecessary or unrelated changes.** PRs shouldn’t come with random formatting changes, especially in unrelated parts of the code. If there is some refactoring that needs to be done, it should be in a separate PR from a bug fix or feature, if possible.\n5. **Code has appropriate comments.** Code should be commented, or written in a clear “self-documenting” way.\n6. **Idiomatic use of the language.** In TypeScript, make sure the typings are specific and correct. In ES2015, make sure to use imports rather than require and const instead of var, etc. Ideally a linter enforces a lot of this, but use your common sense and follow the style of the surrounding code.\n"

While it is primarily built for Apollo Client, it generates a generic GraphQL AST which can be used by any GraphQL client.\n\n```js\nimport gql from 'graphql-tag';\n\nconst query = gql`\n  {\n    user(id: 5) {\n      firstName\n      lastName\n    }\n  }\n`\n```\n\nThe above query now contains the following syntax tree.\n\n```js\n{\n  \"kind\": \"Document\",\n  \"definitions\": [\n    {\n      \"kind\": \"OperationDefinition\",\n      \"operation\": \"query\",\n      \"name\": null,\n      \"variableDefinitions\": null,\n      \"directives\": [],\n      \"selectionSet\": {\n        \"kind\": \"SelectionSet\",\n        \"selections\": [\n          {\n            \"kind\": \"Field\",\n            \"alias\": null,\n            \"name\": {\n              \"kind\": \"Name\",\n              \"value\": \"user\",\n              ...\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n#### Fragments\n\nThe `gql` tag can also be used to define reusable fragments, which can easily be added to queries or other fragments.\n\n```js\nimport gql from 'graphql-tag';\n\nconst userFragment = gql`\n  fragment User_user on User {\n    firstName\n    lastName\n  }\n`\n```\n\nThe above `userFragment` document can be embedded in another document using a template literal placeholder.\n\n```js\nconst query = gql`\n  {\n    user(id: 5) {\n      ...User_user\n    }\n  }\n  ${userFragment}\n`\n```\n\n**Note:** _While it may seem redundant to have to both embed the `userFragment` variable in the template literal **AND** spread the `...User_user` fragment in the graphQL selection set, this requirement makes static analysis by tools such as `eslint-plugin-graphql` possible._\n\n#### Why use this?\n\nGraphQL strings are the right way to write queries in your code, because they can be statically analyzed using tools like [eslint-plugin-graphql](https://github.com/apollographql/eslint-plugin-graphql). However, strings are inconvenient to manipulate, if you are trying to do things like add extra fields, merge multiple queries together, or other interesting stuff.\n\nThat's where this package comes in - it lets you write your queries with [ES2015 template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) and compile them into an AST with the `gql` tag.\n\n#### Caching parse results\n\nThis package only has one feature - it caches previous parse results in a simple dictionary. This means that if you call the tag on the same query multiple times, it doesn't waste time parsing it again. It also means you can use `===` to compare queries to check if they are identical.\n\n\n### Importing graphQL files\n\n_To add support for importing `.graphql`/`.gql` files, see [Webpack loading and preprocessing](#webpack-loading-and-preprocessing) below._\n\nGiven a file `MyQuery.graphql`\n\n```graphql\nquery MyQuery {\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nIf you have configured [the webpack graphql-tag/loader](#webpack-loading-and-preprocessing), you can import modules containing graphQL queries. The imported value will be the pre-built AST.\n\n```js\nimport MyQuery from 'query.graphql'\n```\n\n#### Importing queries by name\n\nYou can also import query and fragment documents by name.\n\n```graphql\nquery MyQuery1 {\n  ...\n}\n\nquery MyQuery2 {\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nAnd in your JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nimport { MyQuery1, MyQuery2 } from 'query.graphql'\n```\n\n### Preprocessing queries and fragments\n\nPreprocessing GraphQL queries and fragments into ASTs at build time can greatly improve load times.\n\n#### Babel preprocessing\n\nGraphQL queries can be compiled at build time using [babel-plugin-graphql-tag](https://github.com/gajus/babel-plugin-graphql-tag). Pre-compiling queries decreases script initialization time and reduces bundle sizes by potentially removing the need for `graphql-tag` at runtime.\n\n#### TypeScript preprocessing\n\nTry this custom transformer to pre-compile your GraphQL queries in TypeScript: [ts-transform-graphql-tag](https://github.com/firede/ts-transform-graphql-tag).\n\n#### React Native and Next.js preprocessing\n\nPreprocessing queries via the webpack loader is not always possible. [babel-plugin-import-graphql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-import-graphql) supports importing graphql files directly into your JavaScript by preprocessing GraphQL queries into ASTs at compile-time.\n\nE.g.:\n\n```javascript\nimport myImportedQuery from './productsQuery.graphql'\n\nclass ProductsPage extends React.Component {\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n#### Webpack loading and preprocessing\n\nUsing the included `graphql-tag/loader` it is possible to maintain query logic that is separate from the rest of your application logic. With the loader configured, imported graphQL files will be converted to AST during the webpack build process.\n\n_**Example webpack configuration**_\n\n```js\n{\n  ...\n  loaders: [\n    {\n      test: /\\.(graphql|gql)$/,\n      exclude: /node_modules/,\n      loader: 'graphql-tag/loader'\n    }\n  ],\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n#### Create React App\n\nPreprocessing GraphQL imports is supported in **create-react-app** >= v2 using [evenchange4/graphql.macro](https://github.com/evenchange4/graphql.macro).\n\nFor **create-react-app** < v2, you'll either need to eject or use [react-app-rewire-inline-import-graphql-ast](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-app-rewire-inline-import-graphql-ast).\n\n#### Testing\n\nTesting environments that don't support Webpack require additional configuration. For [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) use [jest-transform-graphql](https://github.com/remind101/jest-transform-graphql).\n\n#### Support for fragments\n\nWith the webpack loader, you can import fragments by name:\n\nIn a file called `query.gql`:\n\n```graphql\nfragment MyFragment1 on MyType1 {\n  ...\n}\n\nfragment MyFragment2 on MyType2 {\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nAnd in your JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nimport { MyFragment1, MyFragment2 } from 'query.gql'\n```\n\nNote: If your fragment references other fragments, the resulting document will\nhave multiple fragments in it. In this case you must still specify the fragment name when using the fragment. For example, with `@apollo/client` you would specify the `fragmentName` option when using the fragment for cache operations.\n\n### Warnings\n\nThis package will emit a warning if you have multiple fragments of the same name. You can disable this with:\n\n```js\nimport { disableFragmentWarnings } from 'graphql-tag';\n\ndisableFragmentWarnings()\n```\n\n### Experimental Fragment Variables\n\nThis package exports an `experimentalFragmentVariables` flag that allows you to use experimental support for [parameterized fragments](https://github.com/facebook/graphql/issues/204).\n\nYou can enable / disable this with:\n\n```js\nimport { enableExperimentalFragmentVariables, disableExperimentalFragmentVariables } from 'graphql-tag';\n```\n\nEnabling this feature allows you to declare documents of the form.\n\n```graphql\nfragment SomeFragment ($arg: String!) on SomeType {\n  someField\n}\n```\n\n### Resources\n\nYou can easily generate and explore a GraphQL AST on [astexplorer.net](https://astexplorer.net/#/drYr8X1rnP/1).\n"
