Clone the repository\n\nIn your terminal:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/e2b-dev/fragments.git\n```\n\n### 2. Install the dependencies\n\nEnter the repository:\n\n```\ncd fragments\n```\n\nRun the following to install the required dependencies:\n\n```\nnpm i\n```\n\n### 3. Set the environment variables\n\nCreate a `.env.local` file and set the following:\n\n```sh\n# Get your API key here - https://e2b.dev/\nE2B_API_KEY=\"your-e2b-api-key\"\n\n# OpenAI API Key\nOPENAI_API_KEY=\n\n# Other providers\nANTHROPIC_API_KEY=\nGROQ_API_KEY=\nFIREWORKS_API_KEY=\nTOGETHER_API_KEY=\nGOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=\nGOOGLE_VERTEX_CREDENTIALS=\nMISTRAL_API_KEY=\nXAI_API_KEY=\n\n### Optional env vars\n\n# Domain of the site\nNEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=\n\n# Disabling API key and base URL input in the chat\nNEXT_PUBLIC_NO_API_KEY_INPUT=\nNEXT_PUBLIC_NO_BASE_URL_INPUT=\n\n# Rate limit\nRATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=\nRATE_LIMIT_WINDOW=\n\n# Vercel/Upstash KV (short URLs, rate limiting)\nKV_REST_API_URL=\nKV_REST_API_TOKEN=\n\n# Supabase (auth)\nSUPABASE_URL=\nSUPABASE_ANON_KEY=\n\n# PostHog (analytics)\nNEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY=\nNEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST=\n```\n\n### 4. Start the development server\n\n```\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n### 5. Build the web app\n\n```\nnpm run build\n```\n\n## Customize\n\n### Adding custom personas\n\n1. Make sure [E2B CLI](https://e2b.dev/docs/cli/installation) is installed and you're logged in.\n\n2. Add a new folder under [sandbox-templates/](sandbox-templates/)\n\n3. Initialize a new template using E2B CLI:\n\n    ```\n    e2b template init\n    ```\n\n    This will create a new file called `e2b.Dockerfile`.\n\n4. Adjust the `e2b.Dockerfile`\n\n    Here's an example streamlit template:\n\n    ```Dockerfile\n    # You can use most Debian-based base images\n    FROM python:3.19-slim\n\n    RUN pip3 install --no-cache-dir streamlit pandas numpy matplotlib requests seaborn plotly\n\n    # Copy the code to the container\n    WORKDIR /home/user\n    COPY . /home/user\n    ```\n\n5. Specify a custom start command in `e2b.toml`:\n\n    ```toml\n    start_cmd = \"cd /home/user && streamlit run app.py\"\n    ```\n\n6. Deploy the template with the E2B CLI\n\n    ```\n    e2b template build --name <template-name>\n    ```\n\n    After the build has finished, you should get the following message:\n\n    ```\n    ✅ Building sandbox template <template-id> <template-name> finished.\n    ```\n\n7. Open [lib/templates.json](lib/templates.json) in your code editor.\n\n    Add your new template to the list. Here's an example for Streamlit:\n\n    ```json\n    \"streamlit-developer\": {\n      \"name\": \"Streamlit developer\",\n      \"lib\": [\n        \"streamlit\",\n        \"pandas\",\n        \"numpy\",\n        \"matplotlib\",\n        \"request\",\n        \"seaborn\",\n        \"plotly\"\n      ],\n      \"file\": \"app.py\",\n      \"instructions\": \"A streamlit app that reloads automatically.\",\n      \"port\": 8501 // can be null\n    },\n    ```\n\n    Provide a template id (as key), name, list of dependencies, entrypoint and a port (optional). You can also add additional instructions that will be given to the LLM.\n\n4. Optionally, add a new logo under [public/thirdparty/templates](public/thirdparty/templates)\n\n### Adding custom LLM models\n\n1. Open [lib/models.json](lib/models.ts) in your code editor.\n\n2. Add a new entry to the models list:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"id\": \"mistral-large\",\n      \"name\": \"Mistral Large\",\n      \"provider\": \"Ollama\",\n      \"providerId\": \"ollama\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n    Where id is the model id, name is the model name (visible in the UI), provider is the provider name and providerId is the provider tag (see [adding providers](#adding-custom-llm-providers) below).\n\n### Adding custom LLM providers\n\n1. Open [lib/models.ts](lib/models.ts) in your code editor.\n\n2. Add a new entry to the `providerConfigs` list:\n\n    Example for fireworks:\n\n    ```ts\n    fireworks: () => createOpenAI({ apiKey: apiKey || process.env.FIREWORKS_API_KEY, baseURL: baseURL || 'https://api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1' })(modelNameString),\n    ```\n\n3. Optionally, adjust the default structured output mode in the `getDefaultMode` function:\n\n    ```ts\n    if (providerId === 'fireworks') {\n      return 'json'\n    }\n    ```\n\n4. Optionally, add a new logo under [public/thirdparty/logos](public/thirdparty/logos)\n\n## Contributing\n\nAs an open-source project, we welcome contributions from the community.
