          "content": "# Changelog\n## [0.6.0] - 2024-04-26\n### Breaking Changes\n- Special props are now unprefixed. All special prefixed props are deprecated.\n- Special props are now passed into components via props.\n- The `ref` prop behavior has been changed. For host elements, the callback is fired once when the element is created. For component elements, the callback must be manually passed to one of the component’s children to fire. The `ref` callback will have no effect for other elements like `<Fragment>`.\n- The special `static` prop has been renamed to `copy` to avoid collisions with the `static` keyword.\n- The `context.value` property, which allows you to access the current rendered value of a component from the context, has been deprecated.\n- Elements which are reused between renders will skip rendering. This means you have to clone elements between renders if you want them to rerender.\n### Features\n- Component contexts are now passed to components as the second parameter.\n- React style camelCased event names (`onChange`, `onInput`) are now supported.\n- Stale renders are skipped with using `for await...of` in async generator components.\n- Components will now warn when yielding multiple times per props iteration.\n## [0.5.7] - 2023-12-05\n- Fix keyed elements disappearing incorrectly, a bug introduced in 0.5.5\n## [0.5.6] - 2023-11-07\n- Fix `foreignObject` children having the wrong `xmlns` (https://github.com/bikeshaving/crank/pull/268 by (@canadaduane)\n## [0.5.5] - 2023-11-06\n- Fix keyed component elements not cleaning up properly https://github.com/bikeshaving/crank/issues/267\n## [0.5.4] - 2023-05-22\n### Bug Fixes\n- Fix DOM renderer bug where input of `type=\"text\"` does not appear in the DOM, causing surprising CSS styling issues (https://github.com/bikeshaving/crank/pull/258 by @waynebaylor)\n## [0.5.3] - 2023-03-12\n### Bug Fixes\n- The cleanup() functions will be called even if components are unmounted. https://github.com/bikeshaving/crank/issues/249\n- Fixes a situation where component errors in async components were being ignored. https://github.com/bikeshaving/crank/issues/253\n## [0.5.2] - 2023-02-03\n### Bug Fixes\n- Allow `Context<typeof Component>` context types to be passed components with\n\t0 parameters.\n- Alias jsx-dev-runtime to jsx-runtime for parcel/other bundlers\n- Disable hydration mismatch warnings until we figure out the expected DX for\n\twarning suppression.\n\n## [0.5.1] - 2023-02-02\n### Bug Fixes\n- Fixed a bug where refreshing hydrated components throws errors.\n\n## [0.5.0] - 2023-02-01\n\n### Breaking changes\n- The internal `RendererImpl` method `escape()` has been renamed to `text()`.\n- The internal `RendererImpl` method `parse()` has been renamed to `raw()`, and\n\tthe value `prop` is always passed into this method, regardless of whether the\n\tvalue is a string.\n- Generator components which return will restart when re-rerendered, rather\n\tthan staying stuck on the returned value. This should help debugging\n\tcomponents which have accidentally returned.\n\n### Quality of life improvements\n- Special props like `crank-key`, have an additional `$`-prefixed variant.\n\tGoing forward, this will be the preferred syntax, but `crank-key` and `c-key`\n\twill continue to be supported as well.\n\t```ts\n\t<div $key={key} $ref={ref} $static />\n\t```\n- Generator components which are in a `for...of` or `for await...of` loop will\n\tnow attempt to exit normally, so that cleanup code can be placed after the\n\tloop.\n\t```ts\n\t// before\n\tfunction Counter() {\n\t\tlet i = 0;\n\t\tconst interval = setInterval(() => {\n\t\t\ti++;\n\t\t\tthis.refresh();\n\t\t}, 1000);\n\t\ttry {\n\t\t\tfor ({} of this) {\n\t\t\t\tyield <div>{i}</div>;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t} finally {\n\t\t\tclearInterval(interval);\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\t// after\n\tfunction Counter() {\n\t\tlet i = 0;\n\t\tconst interval = setInterval(() => {\n\t\t\ti++;\n\t\t\tthis.refresh();\n\t\t}, 1000);\n\t\tfor ({} of this) {\n\t\t\tyield <div>{i}</div>;\n\t\t}\n\t\tclearInterval(interval);\n\t}\n\t```\n- Async generator components can now use for...of loops. Async generator\n\tcomponents which yield from a for...of loop behave like sync generator\n\tcomponents, pausing at each yield.\n\t```ts\n\tasync function Counter() {\n\t\tlet i = 0;\n\t\tconst interval = setInterval(() => {\n\t\t\ti++;\n\t\t\tthis.refresh();\n\t\t}, 1000);\n\t\tfor ({} of this) {\n\t\t\tyield <div>{i}</div>;\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tclearInterval(interval);\n\t}\n\t```\n- The `Context` type can now be passed a function type as its first parameter\n\tto strongly type the `this` props iterators.\n\t```ts\n\tfunction *MyComponent(\n\t\tthis: Context<typeof MyComponent>,\n\t\t{name}: {name: string},\n\t) {\n\n\t\t// name will be correctly inferred\n\t\tfor ({name} of this) {\n\t\t\tyield <div>Hello name</div>;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\t```\n\n### New Features\n- The automatic JSX runtime transform is now supported. Here is the babel\n\tconfiguration.\n\t```ts\n\tplugins: [\n\t\tbabelPluginSyntaxJSX,\n\t\t[\n\t\t\tbabelPluginTransformReactJSX,\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\truntime: \"automatic\",\n\t\t\t\timportSource: \"@b9g/crank\",\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t],\n\t],\n\t```\n\n- Hydration: The DOM Renderer now provides a `hydrate()` method which will\n\tattempt to re-use DOM nodes already found on the page. A corresponding\n\t`hydrate()` method has been defined for custom renderers.\n- Crank now provides a tagged template function called `jsx` which replicates\n\tJSX syntax and allows templates to be written with vanilla JavaScript.\n\t```ts\n\timport {jsx} from \"@b9g/crank/standalone\";\n\timport {renderer} from \"@b9g/crank/standalone\";\n\tfunction Greeting({\n\t\tname\n\t}) {\n\t\treturn jsx`\n\t\t\t<div>Hello ${name}</div>\n\t\t`;\n\t}\n\n\trenderer.render(jsx`<${Greeting} name=\"world\" />`, document.body);\n\t```\n- Calling `dispatchEvent()` on a component context will now trigger any\n\t`onevent` style props.\n\n### Bug Fixes\n- Errors which are thrown in Context event listener functions will not prevent\n\tother listeners from being called.\n- Async generator components should run more predictably.\n- IFrame/IMG `src` and other props which are sensitive to being re-assigned\n\twill not be re-assigned.\n- `$static` elements which are re-rendered with different tags will now\n\tcorrectly re-render.\n\n## [0.4.4] - 2022-08-08\n### Fixed\n- Inlined event listener methods to avoid errors caused by bundling (#238).\n## [0.4.3] - 2022-06-25\n### Fixed\n- Fix readonly DOM properties not being set correctly (#231).\n## [0.4.2] - 2021-12-20\n### Fixed\n- Fix null/undefined in className property for HTML renderer.\n## [0.4.1] - 2021-10-29\n### Added\n- `createElement` and `Fragment` have been added to default module exports, to work with more JSX tools (#219).\n### Fixed\n- The HTMLRenderer will now correctly render `className` props (#221).\n- Fixed a bug where `<Raw />` elements with parsed string values would lose their contents when rerendered (#224).\n### Changed\n- As part of #224, the internal `RendererImpl.parse()` method can now take any `ElementValue<TNode>` instead of `TNode`.\n- The `./` export which was added in 0.4 was removed from package.json.\n- The `main` and `module` fields will now point to crank.js.\n## [0.4.0] - 2021-10-08\n### Added\n- Special props `crank-key`, `crank-ref`, `crank-static` now have shorthand equivalents `c-key`, `c-ref`, and `c-static` to save on typing.\n- Crank is now published under the NPM package `@b9g/crank`, as well as the old `@bikeshaving/crank`. Again, this saves on typing.\n- The `Context.prototype.flush()` method has been added. It behaves similarly to `Context.prototype.schedule()`, with the exception that it runs after a component’s children is in the DOM. This is important for things like focusing after render. See #180 for motivation.\n- The `c-skip` (`crank-skip`) prop has been added as an alternative to `<Copy />` elements. See #173 for motivation and `src/__tests__/static.tsx` for examples.\n### Changed\n- I gave up and we now use `.cjs` files instead of `/cjs` directories for commonjs fallbacks.\n- `innerHTML` now checks against the old prop value rather than reading from the DOM.\n- Properties and styles which are missing from DOM element props will now be removed.\n  Crank 0.3 tried to implement uncontrolled properties by saying missing props were uncontrolled. For instance, `<div class=\"class\" />` rerendered as `<div />` would preserve the class property even though it was removed. Starting in 0.4, missing props and styles will be removed from DOM elements between renders.\n- Crank will now log a console error when `undefined` is yielded or returned from a component. To squash these warnings, yield or return `null` instead.\n- The default type for `TagProps` is now `Record<string, unknown>` as opposed to `unknown`.\n- Crank will no longer attempt to reuse or modify elements. Motivated by #198.\n- Internal context properties have been hidden using a symbol.\n- The internal Renderer API has been overhauled yet again.\n  - All internal methods which are implemented by the various renderers (`create()`, `patch()`, `arrange()`) have been removed from the base renderer class. Instead, you will now have to pass in these methods via a call to `super()` in the constructor. See `src/dom.ts` or `src/html.ts` for examples.\n  - The `complete()` method has been renamed to `flush()`.\n  - `patch()` now runs per prop as opposed to passing all props.\n  - `patch()` now runs in a post-order call of the tree (yet again).\n  - The signatures of all of the methods have been changed, mainly to avoid passing elements into the renderer, and allow for previous values to be inspected and used.\n### Fixed\n- Fixed some edge cases where event bubbling would result in `\"Generator is already executing.\n- Assigning to `boolean` properties with strings like `spellcheck=\"true\"` will now work as expected. See #175 for motivation.\n\"` errors.\n## [0.3.11] - 2021-05-11\n### Fixed\n- Crank will now always create new elements for internal nodes to prevent subtle aliasing bugs (#198).\n- Fixed an edge case where a scheduled refresh failed to update the component when the produced child was a component (#199).\n- Optimized multiple components scheduling a refresh synchronously (#155).\n## [0.3.10] - 2021-04-30\n### Fixed\n- Fixed Copy elements of async generator components causing parents to hang (#197).\n## [0.3.9] - 2021-03-05\n### Fixed\n- Fixed style strings being incorrectly rendered by the HTMLRenderer (#191).\n## [0.3.8] - 2020-12-27\n### Fixed\n- Various performance improvements.\n### Changed\n- `create()` and `patch()` calls have been moved to a pre-order traversal of the tree.\n- The DOM renderer now checks properties and attributes before mutating them.\n## [0.3.7] - 2020-11-16\nMostly some changes when trying to get Crank to play nicely with contenteditables\n### Fixed\n- Fixed TypeScript sourcemaps not being generated in builds (#165).\n- Fixed empty arrays or otherwise non-empty element children not clearing out non-Crank DOM mutations (#167).\n- Fixed rerenderings updating DOM Text nodes even when the contents have not changed (#169).\n## [0.3.6] - 2020-10-13\n### Fixed\n- Changed the algorithm of patch slightly so that `setAttribute` is never used with object/function values.\n## [0.3.5] - 2020-09-17\n### Fixed\n- Added ChildIterable type to exports to deal with TypeScript errors (#156).\n## [0.3.4] - 2020-09-09\n### Fixed\n- Fix some edge cases with async generator component rendering.\n## [0.3.3] - 2020-08-25\n### Fixed\n- Use ducktyping rather than instanceof checks for cross realm use-cases like nw.js (#147).\n## [0.3.2] - 2020-08-06\n### Changed\n- Duplicate keys and calling refresh on an unmounted or already executing component will now log errors to the console.\n- Changes to some of the error messages thrown by Crank.\n## [0.3.1] - 2020-07-30\n### Added\n- Added official support for Deno. ESM build files now include a triple-slash reference to sibling d.ts files, and the d.ts files have been checked to work in deno.\n- The core file has been moved from `index.js` to `crank.js`, following deno best practices. The `index.js` export is now an alias file.\n- Module Augmentation is now available via a global `Crank` module.\n### Deprecated\n- The class `StringRenderer` in the html module has been renamed to `HTMLRenderer`. The `StringRenderer` export is now an alias and will be removed in the next breaking release.\n## [0.3.0] - 2020-07-28\n### Changed\n- The context methods `get` and `set` are now named `provide` and `consume`.\n- Changes to the internal renderer APIs in preparation for initial documentation.\n  - Elements are passed in directly, rather than their tag and props.\n  - The scope is now no longer passed to the patch method.\n### Fixed\n- Fixed errors not propagating from function component children.\n- The context async iterator now suspends at its start if you yield before iterating over it (#137).\n## [0.2.1] - 2020-07-02\n### Fixed\n- Fixed overloads of Context.prototype.set and Context.prototype.get not appearing in the d.ts file.\n## [0.2.0] - 2020-07-01\n### Changed\n- Props are no longer rememebered between renders. For instance, rendering `<input checked />` and then `<input />` will not cause the checked prop to be deleted on the actual element.\n- The internal Renderer API has been changed to use inheritance and away from the intrinsic generator API.\n- `Renderer.prototype.render` and `Context.prototype.refresh` now return rendered values rather than undefined.\n- The library is no longer transpiled.\n- The esm directory in the package has been deleted. Refer to index, dom and html in the root of the package instead.\n- Some types have been simplified\n  - Tag no longer takes a type parameter.\n  - The types `Props`, `FunctionComponent`, `GeneratorComponent`, `IntrinsicProps`, `ChildIterator`, `ChildGenerator` and `Key` have been removed from the public API.\n### Added\n- UMD build.\n- `crank-ref` props.\n- `Context.prototype.schedule`.\n- `Context.prototype.cleanup`.\n- `Context.prototype.props`.\n- `Context.prototype.value`.\n- `dispatchEvent` now does bubbling and capturing correctly.\n### Fixed\n- Performance improvements in terms of execution time, runtime memory costs, and library size.\n- Fixed `Context.prototype.dispatchEvent` not responding to `stopPropagation` and `stopImmediatePropagation`.\n- Fixed nested SVG elements not rendering SVGElements in some cases.\n- Improved error handling.\n\n## [0.1.6] - 2020-05-25\n- Backed out of a performance optimization where async generator components caused siblings to remain in the DOM.\n## [0.1.5] - 2020-05-21\n- Fixed SVG attributes causing readonly errors (#119).\n## [0.1.4] - 2020-05-17\n### Fixed\n- Added support for SVG elements in the DOM renderer (#110).\n- **basic performance improvements, you want to upgrade to at least 0.1.4 and probably 0.2 when it is released**\n### Changed\n- Got rid of the `HostContext` class in favor of exposing the HostNode directly to intrinsics.\n- Added a way to pass information in a preorder traversal to child host nodes (search for Scoper/Scopes in the codebase).\n- Added new flags for intrinsics to optimize performance (search for dirty in the codebase).\n\n## [0.1.3] - 2020-05-05\n### Fixed\n- Made `event-target-shim` a direct dependency so TypeScript doesn’t error (#95).\n### Changed\n- Updated the types of `Component` and `Context` to take explicit prop types (#51).\n- Allow createElement to be passed anything as `Children` (#97).\n- Allow arbitrary elements to be passed to `Renderer.prototype.render` (#97).\n\n## [0.1.2] - 2020-04-29\n### Fixed\n- Fixed `Copy` element tag not using `Symbol.for` (#69).\n- Fixed event listeners not being properly removed when component is unmounted (#70).\n- Prevented child components from causing parent components to rerender while it is already rerendering (#70).\n- Fixed keyed element logic when an unkeyed element is placed before multiple keyed elements previously rendered.\n- Fixed a deadlock when errors are thrown back into async generator components (#77).\n\n## [0.1.1] - 2020-04-25\n### Fixed\n- Corrected boolean props not working correctly in html renderer (#44).\n- Guarded against potential xss in style objects (#44).\n- Wrapped non-string iterables in an implicit Fragment element (#63).\n- Made sure stateless renders are unmounted (#63).\n\n## [0.1.0] - 2020-04-14\n### Added\n- Initial release 🎉\n"

          "content": "## Try Crank\n\nThe fastest way to try Crank is via the [online playground](https://crank.js.org/playground). In addition, many of the code examples in these guides feature live previews.\n\n## Installation\n\nThe Crank package is available on [NPM](https://npmjs.org/@b9g/crank) through\nthe [@b9g organization](https://www.npmjs.com/org/b9g) (short for\nb*ikeshavin*g).\n\n```shell\nnpm i @b9g/crank\n```\n\n### Importing Crank with the **classic** JSX transform.\n\n```jsx live\n/** @jsx createElement */\n/** @jsxFrag Fragment */\nimport {createElement, Fragment} from \"@b9g/crank\";\nimport {renderer} from \"@b9g/crank/dom\";\n\nrenderer.render(\n  <p>This paragraph element is transpiled with the classic transform.</p>,\n  document.body,\n);\n```\n\n### Importing Crank with the **automatic** JSX transform.\n\n```jsx live\n/** @jsxImportSource @b9g/crank */\nimport {renderer} from \"@b9g/crank/dom\";\n\nrenderer.render(\n  <p>This paragraph element is transpiled with the automatic transform.</p>,\n  document.body,\n);\n```\n\nYou will likely have to configure your tools to support JSX, especially if you do not want to use `@jsx` comment pragmas. See below for common tools and configurations.\n\n### Importing the JSX template tag.\n\nStarting in version `0.5`, the Crank package ships a [tagged template function](/guides/jsx-template-tag) which provides similar syntax and semantics as the JSX transform. This allows you to write Crank components in vanilla JavaScript.\n\n```js live\nimport {jsx} from \"@b9g/crank/standalone\";\nimport {renderer} from \"@b9g/crank/dom\";\n\nrenderer.render(jsx`\n  <p>No transpilation is necessary with the JSX template tag.</p>\n`, document.body);\n```\n\n### ECMAScript Module CDNs\nCrank is also available on CDNs like [unpkg](https://unpkg.com)\n(https://unpkg.com/@b9g/crank?module) and [esm.sh](https://esm.sh)\n(https://esm.sh/@b9g/crank) for usage in ESM-ready environments.\n\n```jsx live\n/** @jsx createElement */\n\n// This is an ESM-ready environment!\n// If code previews work, your browser is an ESM-ready environment!\n\nimport {createElement} from \"https://unpkg.com/@b9g/crank/crank?module\";\nimport {renderer} from \"https://unpkg.com/@b9g/crank/dom?module\";\n\nrenderer.render(\n  <div id=\"hello\">\n    Running on <a href=\"https://unpkg.com\">unpkg.com</a>\n  </div>,\n  document.body,\n);\n```\n\n## Common tool configurations\nThe following is an incomplete list of configurations to get started with Crank.\n\n### [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)\n\nTypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript.\n\nHere’s the configuration you will need to set up automatic JSX transpilation.\n\n```tsconfig.json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"jsx\": \"react-jsx\",\n    \"jsxImportSource\": \"@b9g/crank\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe classic transform is supported as well.\n\n```tsconfig.json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"jsx\": \"react\",\n    \"jsxFactory\": \"createElement\",\n    \"jsxFragmentFactory\": \"Fragment\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nCrank is written in TypeScript. Refer to [the guide on TypeScript](/guides/working-with-typescript) for more information about Crank types.\n\n```tsx\nimport type {Context} from \"@b9g/crank\";\nfunction *Timer(this: Context) {\n  let seconds = 0;\n  const interval = setInterval(() => {\n    seconds++;\n    this.refresh();\n  }, 1000);\n  for ({} of this) {\n    yield <div>Seconds: {seconds}</div>;\n  }\n\n  clearInterval(interval);\n}\n```\n\n### [Babel](https://babeljs.io)\n\nBabel is a popular open-source JavaScript compiler which allows you to write code with modern syntax (including JSX) and run it in environments which do not support the syntax.\n\nHere is how to get Babel to transpile JSX for Crank.\n\nAutomatic transform:\n```.babelrc.json\n{\n  \"plugins\": [\n    \"@babel/plugin-syntax-jsx\",\n    [\n      \"@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx\",\n      {\n        \"runtime\": \"automatic\",\n        \"importSource\": \"@b9g/crank\",\n\n        \"throwIfNamespace\": false,\n        \"useSpread\": true\n      }\n    ]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nClassic transform:\n```.babelrc.json\n{\n  \"plugins\": [\n    \"@babel/plugin-syntax-jsx\",\n    [\n      \"@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx\",\n      {\n        \"runtime\": \"class\",\n        \"pragma\": \"createElement\",\n        \"pragmaFrag\": \"''\",\n\n        \"throwIfNamespace\": false,\n        \"useSpread\": true\n      }\n    ]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### [ESLint](https://eslint.org)\n\nESLint is a popular open-source tool for analyzing and detecting problems in JavaScript code.\n\nCrank provides a configuration preset for working with ESLint under the package name `eslint-plugin-crank`.\n\n```bash\nnpm i eslint eslint-plugin-crank\n```\n\nIn your eslint configuration:\n\n```.eslintrc.json\n{\n  \"extends\": [\"plugin:crank/recommended\"]\n}\n```\n\n### [Astro](https://astro.build)\n\nAstro.js is a modern static site builder and framework.\n\nCrank provides an [Astro integration](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/) to enable server-side rendering and client-side hydration with Astro.\n\n```bash\nnpm i astro-crank\n```\n\nIn your `astro.config.mjs`.\n\n```astro.config.mjs\nimport {defineConfig} from \"astro/config\";\nimport crank from \"astro-crank\";\n\n// https://astro.build/config\nexport default defineConfig({\n  integrations: [crank()],\n});\n```\n\n## Key Examples\n\n### A Simple Component\n\n```jsx live\nimport {renderer} from \"@b9g/crank/dom\";\n\nfunction Greeting({name = \"World\"}) {\n  return (\n    <div>Hello {name}</div>\n  );\n}\n\nrenderer.render(<Greeting />, document.body);\n```\n\n### A Stateful Component\n\n```jsx live\nimport {renderer} from \"@b9g/crank/dom\";\n\nfunction *Timer() {\n  let seconds = 0;\n  const interval = setInterval(() => {\n    seconds++;\n    this.refresh();\n  }, 1000);\n  try {\n    while (true) {\n      yield <div>Seconds: {seconds}</div>;\n    }\n  } finally {\n    clearInterval(interval);\n  }\n}\n\nrenderer.render(<Timer />, document.body);\n```\n\n### An Async Component\n\n```jsx live\nimport {renderer} from \"@b9g/crank/dom\";\nasync function Definition({word}) {\n  // API courtesy https://dictionaryapi.dev\n  const res = await fetch(`https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/${word}`);\n  const data = await res.json();\n  if (!Array.isArray(data)) {\n    return <p>No definition found for {word}</p>;\n  }\n\n  const {phonetic, meanings} = data[0];\n  const {partOfSpeech, definitions} = meanings[0];\n  const {definition} = definitions[0];\n  return <>\n    <p>{word} <code>{phonetic}</code></p>\n    <p><b>{partOfSpeech}.</b> {definition}</p>\n  </>;\n}\n\nawait renderer.render(<Definition word=\"framework\" />, document.body);\n```\n\n### A Loading Component\n\n```jsx live\nimport {Fragment} from \"@b9g/crank\";\nimport {renderer} from \"@b9g/crank/dom\";\n\nasync function LoadingIndicator() {\n  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));\n  return <div>Fetching a good boy...</div>;\n}\n\nasync function RandomDog({throttle = false}) {\n  const res = await fetch(\"https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random\");\n  const data = await res.json();\n  if (throttle) {\n    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <a href={data.message}>\n      <img src={data.message} alt=\"A Random Dog\" width=\"300\" />\n    </a>\n  );\n}\n\nasync function *RandomDogLoader({throttle}) {\n  for await ({throttle} of this) {\n    yield <LoadingIndicator />;\n    yield <RandomDog throttle={throttle} />;\n  }\n}\n\nfunction *RandomDogApp() {\n  let throttle = false;\n  this.addEventListener(\"click\", (ev) => {\n    if (ev.target.tagName === \"BUTTON\") {\n      throttle = !throttle;\n      this.refresh();\n    }\n  });\n\n  for ({} of this) {\n    yield (\n      <Fragment>\n        <RandomDogLoader throttle={throttle} />\n        <p>\n          <button>Show me another dog.</button>\n        </p>\n      </Fragment>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nrenderer.render(<RandomDogApp />, document.body);\n```\n"
