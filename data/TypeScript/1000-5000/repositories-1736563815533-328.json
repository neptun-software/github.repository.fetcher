Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Notices\n\nYou may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\n(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\nor limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of\nthe Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to\nthe extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n\n3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n\nYou may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\nSoftware. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\nbehalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\nsuch warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\nYou alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\nliability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability terms You offer.

Except to the extent prohibited by statute\nor regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a\nrecipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n\n5. Termination\n\n---\n\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically\nif You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become\ncompliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular\nContributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\nContributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\nongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\nnon-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\ncome back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular\nContributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\nnotifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\nfirst time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\nfrom such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\nYour receipt of the notice.\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\ninfringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\ncounter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\ndirectly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\nYou by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n\n5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all\nend user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which\nhave been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License\nprior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n---\n\n-                                                                      *\n- 6.

The entire risk as to the \\*\n- quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. \\*\n- Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You \\*\n- (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, \\*\n- repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an \\*\n- essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is \\*\n- authorized under this License except under this disclaimer. \\*\n-                                                                      *\n\n---\n\n---\n\n-                                                                      *\n- 7.

This \\*\n- limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or \\*\n- personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the \\*\n- extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some \\*\n- jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of \\*\n- incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and \\*\n- limitation may not apply to You. \\*\n-                                                                      *\n\n---\n\n8. Litigation\n\n---\n\nAny litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the\ncourts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal\nplace of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that\njurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.\nNothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring\ncross-claims or counter-claims.\n\n9. Miscellaneous\n\n---\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\nmatter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\nnecessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides\nthat the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter\nshall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n\n10. Versions of the License\n\n---\n\n10.1. New Versions\n\nMozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section\n10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\npublish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a\ndistinguishing version number.\n\n10.2.

Modified Versions\n\nIf you create software not governed by this License, and you want to\ncreate a new license for such software, you may create and use a\nmodified version of this License if you rename the license and remove\nany references to the name of the license steward (except to note that\nsuch modified license differs from this License).\n\n10.4.

Our licenses are\n     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms\n     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.\n     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before\n     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the\n     material as expected.

More considerations for licensors:\n\twiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors\n\n     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public\n     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the\n     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If\n     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for\n     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to\n     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our\n     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain\n     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of\n     the licensed material may still be restricted for other\n     reasons, including because others have copyright or other\n     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,\n     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.\n     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to\n     respect those requests where reasonable.

Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or\n     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights\n     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\n  f.

Share means to provide material to the public by any means or\n     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such\n     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,\n     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material\n     available to the public including in ways that members of the\n     public may access the material from a place and at a time\n     individually chosen by them.\n\n  j.

Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n          its terms and conditions.\n\n       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n          6(a).\n\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n       5. Downstream recipients.\n\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\n            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n               Material.\n\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b. Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database;\n\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\nlicenses.

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17.

To help us meet that goal, we ask that any contributors please follow the guidelines set out in that, and below, and we will do our best to be as responsive and helpful as possible. After all, we want any and all contributors to feel valued.\n\n## Looking for help?\n\nIf you need help, please reach out to us on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/NEEnPKCgzC), in the `#help-me` channel.\n\n## Reporting an issue\n\nIf you find a bug, please do report it. We ask that you first run a quick search to see if you can already find an existing bug, and if so please use a thumbs up reaction to upvote it, and add any relevant comments if they will help us to understand / solve the issue.\n\nWhen reporting a new issue, please (where relevant) include sample code (or even a link to an existing project), reproduction steps (where known), and ideally a video (especially for interaction bugs). The more information you can provide, the better the chance of us being able to trace the cause.\n\n## Developer guidelines\n\nMost of our guidelines are automatically enforced via our use of prettier and eslint as part of our pre-commit hooks. We also would like our contributors to adhere to the following:\n\n- Commit messages should be concise, and follow the pattern `<type>(<scope>) <description>`, where: - `type` is one of `chore`, `feat`, `fix` to represent if something is a chore, a new feature, or a fix to something broken - `scope` tells us where roughly the changes are made. This can mean a specific file name (if only one file has been changed), a part of the editor (e.g. the `canvas`), or something larger or smaller. - `description` is a concise description of what has actually changed\n- Types should be used everywhere, since they leave less scope for misunderstandings (with us or the compiler).\n- Speaking of types, please avoid `any` like the plague! It has caused immeasurable pain, as it allows code to circumvent the type system. Instead, try to use `unknown` and then use runtime checks to ensure that the right type is being used (we know this isn't always possible though)\n- Avoid double or triple negatives where possible. e.g., rather than testing `if (!thingIsFalse)`, prefer to split over two lines `const thingIsTrue = !thingIsFalse; if (thingIsTrue)`\n- Nested ternaries will be met with wrath! Ternaries should only be used where they can be kept concise (we do tend to make exceptions when writing JSX code however)\n"

It uses React code as the source of truth, and lets you make real time changes to components by editing it and using a suite of design tools. It's early software, but you can [try it today](https://utopia.app/project), look at an [example project](https://utopia.app/p/36ae27be-welcome-to-utopia/), or read about it on our [blog](https://utopia.app/blog)!\n\n[Try Utopia Now!](https://utopia.app/project)\n\n![screenshot of utopia](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2226774/93580752-7b7b8e80-f9a0-11ea-8663-39683a53df2e.png)\n\n[Start the editor](https://utopia.app/project)\n\n# For contributors only: Installing Utopia on your machine\n\nPlease note: to use Utopia, visit [utopia.app](https://utopia.app/). Installing it locally is for feature development of Utopia itself: it's slower - sometimes very significantly so. It still needs connection to our servers. And you won't be able to edit projects in the file system on your machine if you install it locally.\n\nTo contribute to Utopia, you'll need to clone the repo, install the prerequisites, and then run the editor for the first time.\n\n## Quick Start for contemporary MacOS\n1. Clone the repo\n2. Install Nix-Shell [nix-shell](https://nixos.org/download.html) `sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install)`\n3. Close terminal, start new terminal session, navigate to repo folder, run `nix-shell`. first run will take a while it will look like nothing will happen.\n4. Generate and copy a Github Token [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens) (fine-grained or classic, longest expiration. No need to tick any of the permission checkboxes for classic)\n5. First run and build: open terminal `GITHUB_TOKEN=<token from above> start-full`.\n6. Wait - this step will take a while and start with (harmless) errors. Once you see the scratchpad, check the server tab - it'll take the longest (many minutes).\n7. Load the editor at `http://localhost:8000/p`. \n8. Subsequent runs: `start-minimal` (this won't rebuild everything) except for server and infra-level changes\n9. Editor hot-reloads and rebuilds as needed; refresh browser for asset changes\n10. `stop-dev` in the Scratchpad stops the server.\n11. Install [direnv](https://github.com/concrete-utopia/utopia#using-direnv-to-make-your-life-easier) to start nix-shell automatically `brew install direnv`\n\n## Install the Prerequisites\n\n- [nix-shell](https://nixos.org/download.html). If you are on macOS Catalina or later, you will be prompted to include an extra flag in the install script. If using Windows follow [this guide](https://nathan.gs/2019/04/12/nix-on-windows/). If you don't want to use nix, we have instructions [here](https://github.com/concrete-utopia/utopia#running-this-without-nix)\n- [direnv](https://github.com/concrete-utopia/utopia#using-direnv-to-make-your-life-easier). If you don't have `direnv` installed, you'll need to run `nix-shell` before any of the `start` commands, and switching to nix will be a bit slower.\n\nNB: If you're on Windows, you'll first need to set up the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (wsl)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).\n\n## You need to generate a `GITHUB_TOKEN`\n\nA Github token is required to build VS Code, as there are some dependencies downloaded via the Github API which will be rate limited without one, causing the build to sporadically fail with a 403 error. To prevent that, generate a new Github token [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens) (if you have access to fine-grained tokens, use one of those, but if not then a \"classic\" token will be fine).\n\nGive it the longest expiration time possible, readonly public access, and don't give it any permissions for anything else. Then copy that token somewhere so that you can use it in the next step.\n\n## Run the Editor for the first time\n\nThe first time running the editor, run the following script:\n\n```\nGITHUB_TOKEN=<token from above> start-full\n```\n\n(You'll only need to do this once, and it will take quite some time to download and build various dependencies. After that, you can usually use `start-minimal`.)\n\n## Working in the dev environment\n\nBoth of these scripts result in a tmux session with all of the various servers running and watching for changes. You can see all of the active sessions in the bar along the bottom, prefixed by the \"window\" number that they are running in. You should be able to click on each of those to switch to viewing that session, or if that doesn't work you can use the key combo `cmd`+`b` (macOS) or `ctrl`+`b` (Linux or Windows), followed by the number for that session. (see [here](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/Getting-Started#changing-the-current-window) for the relevant tmux docs)\n\nTo shut them down, in the \"Scratchpad\" tab of the session run the following command:\n\n```\nstop-dev\n```\n\n### Finally, loading the running application\n\nNow the editor should load on [http://localhost:8000/p](http://localhost:8000/p), or [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/) when developing the website itself.\n\n## Pull request bundle support.\n\nWhen a series of environment variables are set (see `Branches.hs`), the editor supports the ability to get a bundle of editor code from S3 that was created from a PR, and load that instead of the code currently held locally. Which means that changes can be tested without spinning up multiple environments.\n\nTo use this if the URL currently is `https://utopia.pizza/p/e976df60-phase-rutabaga/`, the branch name would be added on in a query parameter like so: `https://utopia.pizza/p/e976df60-phase-rutabaga/?branch_name=my-test-branch`.\n\nLimitations:\n\n- Doesn't currently support Monaco because of the way that builds the workers in a special webpack plugin, so changes to the version of Monaco in that branch may fail in unusual ways.\n- Anything that isn't editor code will not be changed by this, such as the website code or the server endpoints.\n\n# Troubleshooting\n\n## I'm on macOS and Nix has suddenly stopped working\n\nPart of the nix installation will add a hook into `/etc/bashrc`, which can be wiped by a macOS update. There is an open bug ticket for that [here](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/3616). If this has happened to you, you'll need to manually add that hook back in, or alternatively add it to your own `~/.zshrc` (where it won't be overwritten), copying and pasting the hook exactly as follows:\n\n```\n# Nix\nif [ -e '/nix/var/nix/profiles/default/etc/profile.d/nix-daemon.sh' ]; then\n  . '/nix/var/nix/profiles/default/etc/profile.d/nix-daemon.sh'\nfi\n# End Nix\n```\n\n## fsevents\n\nIf you notice that 1 or more CPU cores are running 100% because of `node` processes, it is probably webpack-dev-server having trouble with `fsevents` on MacOS. To fix it, run `pnpm install fsevents` in the `utopia/editor` directory. see https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/701#issuecomment-216082726\n\n## Installation error on `utopia-vscode-extensions` step\n\nIf you see an error to the effect of\n\n```\nUsage Error: The nearest package directory (/path/to/utopia/utopia-vscode-extension) doesn't seem to be part of the project declared in /path/to/utopia.\n\n- If /path/to/utopia isn't intended to be a project, remove any yarn.lock and/or package.json file there.\n- If /path/to/utopia is intended to be a project, it might be that you forgot to list utopia-vscode-extension in its workspace configuration.\n- Finally, if /path/to/utopia is fine and you intend utopia-vscode-extension to be treated as a completely separate project (not even a workspace), create an empty yarn.lock file in it.\n```\n\nIt could be caused by a `.yarnrc` or `.yarnrc.yml` file located in a parent directory. `.yarnrc` files are [used to configure yarn setting](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/yarnrc) and will effect projects in all child directories below them. This can change the yarn version of utopia to one that will produce the above error. Simply removing the `.yarnrc` or `.yarnrc.yml` file will fix this error.\n\n## Running this without Nix\n\nWe highly recommend using Nix to make life easier, but if you're having trouble with that or would prefer not to, then there is always the option to run each of the various scripts individually.\n\n**You'll first need to build VS Code and install a few dependencies:**\n\n```\ncd [root-directory]/utopia-vscode-extension\npnpm install\npnpm run build\n\ncd [root-directory]/vscode-build\nyarn\nyarn run build\n\ncd [root-directory]/editor\npnpm install\n```\n\n**Then, to run the application, you'll need multiple things running concurrently...**\nThe server:\n\n```\ncd [root-directory]/server\nhpack\ncabal new-run -j --disable-optimization --disable-profiling --disable-documentation --disable-library-coverage --disable-benchmarks utopia-web -- +RTS -N -c\"\n```\n\nPostgreSQL:\n\n```\ncd [root-directory]\nPGLOCK_DIR=\"`pwd`/.pglock/\"\nmkdir -p $PGLOCK_DIR\npg_ctl -D utopia-db stop\ninitdb -D utopia-db\npg_ctl -D utopia-db -l pglog.txt -o \"--unix_socket_directories='$PGLOCK_DIR' -c log_statement=none\" start\npsql -o /dev/null -h \"$PGLOCK_DIR\" -d utopia -tc \"SELECT 1 FROM pg_database WHERE datname = 'utopia'\" || create-db\ntail -f pglog.txt\n```\n\n`tsc` to compile the editor:\n\n```\ncd [root-directory]/editor\npnpm tsc --watch && NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=4096\n```\n\nVite to run the editor:\n\n```\ncd [root-directory]/editor\npnpm run dev-fast\n```\n\nThe utopia-vscode-common module:\n\n```\ncd [root-directory]/utopia-vscode-common\npnpm install\npnpm run watch-dev\n```\n\nThe utopia-vscode-extension module:\n\n```\ncd [root-directory]/utopia-vscode-extension\npnpm install\npnpm run watch-dev\n```\n\nA script for pulling changes to the above extension into VS Code:\n\n```\ncd [root-directory]/vscode-build\nyarn run pull-utopia-extension\n```\n\nThe website project (if developing that)\n\n```\ncd [root-directory]/website-next\npnpm install\nBROWSER=none pnpm run dev\n```\n\n## Using direnv to make your life easier\n\nSince a lot of this requires using `nix-shell` everywhere, you can just use [direnv](https://direnv.net/) to make that a lot simpler. Not only will this automatically use a nix shell whenever you `cd` into the project folder, but it also adds caching to vastly speed up the opening of that shell. You can install direnv by using [brew](https://brew.sh/):\n\n```\nbrew install direnv\n```\n\nTo actually run direnv you need to hook it into your shell by following the instructions [here](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html).\n\nThen to configure it, in your \\$HOME directory add a file `.direnvrc` with the following contents (copied from https://github.com/direnv/direnv/wiki/Nix#using-a-global-use_nix-with-garbage-collection-prevention):\n\n```\nuse_nix() {\n  local path=\"$(nix-instantiate --find-file nixpkgs)\"\n\n  if [ -f \"${path}/.version-suffix\" ]; then\n    local version=\"$(< $path/.version-suffix)\"\n  elif [ -f \"${path}/.git\" ]; then\n    local version=\"$(< $(< ${path}/.git/HEAD))\"\n  fi\n\n  local cache=\".direnv/cache-${version:-unknown}\"\n\n  local update_drv=0\n  if [[ ! -e \"$cache\" ]] || \\\n    [[ \"$HOME/.direnvrc\" -nt \"$cache\" ]] || \\\n    [[ .envrc -nt \"$cache\" ]] || \\\n    [[ default.nix -nt \"$cache\" ]] || \\\n    [[ shell.nix -nt \"$cache\" ]];\n  then\n    [ -d .direnv ] || mkdir .direnv\n    nix-shell --show-trace --pure \"$@\" --run \"\\\"$direnv\\\" dump bash\" > \"$cache\"\n    update_drv=1\n  else\n    log_status using cached derivation\n  fi\n  local term_backup=$TERM path_backup=$PATH\n  if [ -n ${TMPDIR+x} ]; then\n    local tmp_backup=$TMPDIR\n  fi\n\n  eval \"$(< $cache)\"\n  export PATH=$PATH:$path_backup TERM=$term_backup TMPDIR=$tmp_backup\n  if [ -n ${tmp_backup+x} ]; then\n    export TMPDIR=${tmp_backup}\n  else\n    unset TMPDIR\n  fi\n\n  # `nix-shell --pure` sets invalid ssl certificate paths\n  if [ \"${SSL_CERT_FILE:-}\" = /no-cert-file.crt ]; then\n    unset SSL_CERT_FILE\n  fi\n  if [ \"${NIX_SSL_CERT_FILE:-}\" = /no-cert-file.crt ]; then\n    unset NIX_SSL_CERT_FILE\n  fi\n\n  # This part is based on https://discourse.nixos.org/t/what-is-the-best-dev-workflow-around-nix-shell/418/4\n  if [ \"$out\" ] && (( $update_drv )); then\n    local drv_link=\".direnv/drv\"\n    local drv=\"$(nix --experimental-features nix-command show-derivation $out | grep -E -o -m1 '/nix/store/.*.drv')\"\n    local stripped_pwd=${PWD/\\//}\n    local escaped_pwd=${stripped_pwd//-/--}\n    local escaped_pwd=${escaped_pwd//\\//-}\n    ln -fs \"$drv\" \"$drv_link\"\n    ln -fs \"$PWD/$drv_link\" \"/nix/var/nix/gcroots/per-user/$LOGNAME/$escaped_pwd\"\n    log_status renewed cache and derivation link\n  fi\n\n  if [[ $# = 0 ]]; then\n    watch_file default.nix\n    watch_file shell.nix\n  fi\n}\n```\n\nAnd add a `.envrc` file to the root folder of the project with the following contents:\n\n```\nuse nix\n```\n\n(This file is deliberately contained in the `.gitignore` because it is supposed to be personal to you - it allows you to add custom environment variables that will always be in scope whenever you're in this directory)\n\nPlease update your .zshrc (or .bashrc) to [hook it into the shell](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html), for example for zsh add this line:\n\n```\neval \"$(direnv hook zsh)\"\n```\n\nAfter this step open a new shell window and enter the utopia directory. Direnv should be activated as soon as you enter, you can use the `start` and `start-performance` scripts without manually running nix-shell.\n\n## Unit Tests with Jest\n\nUse the following nix scripts:\n\n```\ntest-editor\n```\n\nContinuous mode:\n\n```\ntest-editor-watch\n```\n\nOn macOS, when trying to watch, you might run into an error message about number of open files. In that case, install watchman:\n\n```\nbrew install watchman\n```\n\n## Browser tests with Karma\n\n_Tip: If you want to focus on a specific test suite you can change `describe(...` to `describe.only(...` and if you want to run a specific test case, you can do the same with `it.only(...` ._\n\nUse the following nix scripts:\n\nOne-off run with a headless Chrome (same as on the CI):\n\n```\ntest-editor-browser\n```\n\nDebugging (bring your own Chrome):\n\n```\ntest-editor-browser-debug\n```\n\nIn debugging mode, Karma will be run in watch mode, and will not use a managed browser. Once the Karma webpack server is ready, it will print something like this to the terminal:\n\n```\n01 03 2022 11:20:17.412:WARN [karma]: No captured browser, open http://localhost:9876/\n```\n\nUse your own Chrome browser to navigate to the printed http address. The website will have a Debug button, or you can just append `/debug.html` to the url like so: `http://localhost:9876/debug.html` (your port may vary).\n\nIn debug mode, you can see all console logs in Chrome's own DevTools, you can use `debugger;` statements, etc.\nBehind the scenes, Karma runs a webpack dev server in watch mode, which means if you change the source code, webpack will recompile and karma will attempt to re-run the tests. If the tests do not rerun for some reason, just navigate to `http://localhost:9876/debug.html` again.\n\n(I recommend opening DevTools before navigating to `/debug.html` to make sure you don't miss `debugger;` statements and see the console output even if a test hangs the browser or enters an infinite loop.)\n\n### Browser tests failing to run with `Error: spawn Unknown system error -86`\n\nThis is most likely because the browser tests are trying to run a headless version of Chrome built for Intel chips on an Mac with an ARM chip. If that's the case, [Rosetta 2](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT211861) should solve your problem:\n\n```\nsoftwareupdate --install-rosetta\n```\n\n## VSCode linting, formatting with prettier etc\n\nTo enable format-on-save, you should install the VSCode plugin `esbenp.prettier-vscode`, and `dbaeumer.vscode-eslint` and then in your workspace settings, enable format on save, and tell prettier to use the eslint integration mode:\n\n```\n  \"eslint.workingDirectories\": [\"./editor\", \"./utopia-api\"],\n  \"editor.formatOnSave\": true,\n  \"prettier.useEditorConfig\": false,\n  \"prettier.requireConfig\": true,\n  \"[typescript]\": {\n    \"editor.defaultFormatter\": \"esbenp.prettier-vscode\"\n  },\n  \"[javascript]\": {\n    \"editor.defaultFormatter\": \"esbenp.prettier-vscode\"\n  },\n  \"[typescriptreact]\": {\n    \"editor.defaultFormatter\": \"esbenp.prettier-vscode\"\n  },\n  \"[json]\": {\n    \"editor.defaultFormatter\": \"esbenp.prettier-vscode\"\n  }\n\n```\n\nSelect prettier as the default formatter in your settings; VSCode may prompt you to do so. The last four line items, starting with `[typescript]` reflect this. You should restart VSCode after this.\n\n# Deploying\n\nAll pushes to the `master` branch will immediately trigger [this](.github/workflows/master-pushes.yml) workflow that runs the tests and then triggers a deploy to our Staging environment.\n\nTo deploy to the Production environment, somebody needs to manually trigger our [`tag-release.yml`](.github/workflows/tag-release.yml) workflow, giving either a specific commit hash or branch name (defaulting to `master`), and optionally a tag name (the default behaviour is to increment the patch version). This can be triggered via the \"Run Workflow\" button [here](https://github.com/concrete-utopia/utopia/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Tag+and+Release%22)  \n**Note**: in the \"Use workflow from\" dropdown you have to select \"Branch: master\" - this is specifying which workflow to run, not which branch to cut the release from.\n"
