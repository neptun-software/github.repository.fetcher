Walker は Tableau と異なる形で仕組みされて、Tableau のオープンソースの代用品です。簡単なドラッグ・アンド・ドロップ操作でデータ分析と可視化を実現します。データサイエンティストの分析需要を支援する機能を備えています。\n\n#### Tableau との違い\n\nGraphic Walker は React コンポーネントの形で、プラグインとして Web アプリに簡単に埋め込めます。Tableau と違って、Graphic Walker は豊かな機能でできているのではなく、基本の機能を簡単に使用できるようにデザインされている軽量なツールです。Graphic Walker を React アプリに埋め込むことは非常に簡単です ！\n\n#### 主な機能\n\n+ 使いやすいインタラクション。簡単な手順でデータの分析と可視化を完成できます。\n+ Grammar of graphics に基づく [vega-lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) で実現する可視化。\n+ データの中のパターンと期待はずれの値になったマークを解釈する情報の生成。\n+ WebWorker の使用によって純粋なフロントエンドとして埋め込める高い拡張性。\n\n> Graphic Walker は軽量なコンポーネントです。もしより多くの機能がお望みなら、同じくわたしたちのチームで開発した [RATH](https://github.com/Kanaries/Rath) という拡張分析エンジンを使い、自動的なパターン発見、洞察探索、因果分析など多様な機能が備えるツールをご覧ください。\n\n## 手順\n\n最初は、分析したいデータを CSV ファイルとして導入します。データを確認する際に、各列どれがディメンションか、どれがメジャーかを決めます。\n\n> 導入できるデータソースの種類を増やす予定がありますので、追加をご希望する方は気軽に私たちに連絡または issue で教えてください。開発者には、直接にデータを props として Graphic Walker に入力することができます。[Rath](https://github.com/Kanaries/Rath) はその方法で、多くのデータソースをサポートします。また、[Rath](https://github.com/Kanaries/Rath) でデータを導入してセーブするファイルを Graphic Walker に取り込むこともできます。Graphic Walker で導入できないデータを [Rath](https://github.com/Kanaries/Rath) で処理したり、変換したりしてから Graphic Walker で分析する選択肢もあります。\n\n![graphic walker dataset upload](https://pub-8e7aa5bf51e049199c78b4bc744533f8.r2.dev/gw-readme-202402%2Fgw-ds-import.png)\n\n確認が完了したら、『Submit』をクリックしましょう。データの各ディメンションとメジャーは左のリストに表示されます。それらをその右側のスペース（行、列、色、不透明度など）にドロップしたら、可視化が生成します。\n\n![](https://pub-8e7aa5bf51e049199c78b4bc744533f8.r2.dev/gw-readme-202402%2Fgw-ui.png)\n\n\nメジャーには、合計、平均、個数などの統計関数が利用できます。\n\n![graphic walker bar chart](https://pub-8e7aa5bf51e049199c78b4bc744533f8.r2.dev/gw-readme-202402%2Fgw-bar01.png)\n\n\nマークを設置して、グラフを別種類、例えば折れ線グラフに変更しましょう。\n\n![graphic walker line chart](https://pub-8e7aa5bf51e049199c78b4bc744533f8.r2.dev/gw-readme-202402%2Fgw-line-02.png)\n\n\n多数のメジャーを比較するために、行や列の空欄に複数のメジャーを入れましょう。\n\n![graphic walker area chart](https://pub-8e7aa5bf51e049199c78b4bc744533f8.r2.dev/gw-readme-202402%2Fgw-area.png)\n\nTableau に似ていて、複数のディメンションを行や列に設置したら、複数のグラフが生成されます。\n\n![graphic walker scatter chart](https://pub-8e7aa5bf51e049199c78b4bc744533f8.r2.dev/gw-readme-202402%2Fgw-scatter.png)\n\nGraphic Walker は編集した結果をファイルとして保存することができます。今回の分析を続けたい時または結果を残したい時は、セーブ・アンド・ロード機能を利用しましょう。\n\nデータを探索する時に気になるとこがあったら、インサイト機能を使って補助情報をチェックしてみましょう。\n\n例えば、bike sharing データセットを分析するとき、１月の登録者の利用数が期待された値よりあきらかに低いということに気付きました。マークをクリックしてインサイト機能を使ってみよう。\n\n![](https://docs-us.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/images/graphic-walker/explain-data-start.png)\n\nインサイト機能が提供した情報によると、１月には就業日の数が平均より少ないとのことです。\n\n![](https://docs-us.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/images/graphic-walker/explain-data-result.png)\n\n## デプロイ\n\nデプロイより、今すぐ試すことをご希望する方は、オンラインバージョンをご利用ください：[Graphic Walker Online](https://graphic-walker.kanaries.net)\n\n### 方法１：本リポジトリを配置\n\n```bash\nyarn install\n\nyarn workspace @kanaries/graphic-walker build\n```\n\n### 方法２：あなたの Web アプリに実装 \n\nGraphic Walker の埋め込みは非常に簡単です。まずはインストールです。\n\n```bash\nyarn add @kanaries/graphic-walker\n\n# or\n\nnpm i --save @kanaries/graphic-walker\n```\n\nあなたの React アプリで：\n```typescript\nimport { GraphicWalker } from '@kanaries/graphic-walker';\n\nconst YourEmbeddingApp: React.FC = props => {\n    const { data, fields } = props;\n    return <GraphicWalker\n        data={data}\n        fields={fields}\n        spec={graphicWalkerSpec}\n        i18nLang={langStore.lang}\n    />\n}\n\nexport default YourEmbeddingApp;\n```\n\nもし Graphic Walker のコンフィグがある場合、`PureRenderer` コンポーネントを使ってコントロール UI なしのチャートを表示できます。\n\n```typescript\nimport { PureRenderer } from '@kanaries/graphic-walker';\n\nconst YourChart: React.FC = props => {\n    const { rawData, visualState, visualConfig } = props;\n    return <GraphicWalker\n        rawData={rawData}\n        visualState={visualState}\n        visualConfig={visualConfig}\n    />\n}\n\nexport default YourChart;\n```\n\n### ローカルに試す (dev mode)\n```bash\n# packages/graphic-walker\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n## オープンソースコミュニティに共有\n> もし [graphic walker](https://github.com/Kanaries/graphic-walker)

多言語サポート\n\nGraphic Walker は現在_英語_（コード `\"en\"` または `\"en-US\"`）と中国語（コード `\"zh\"` または `\"zh-CN\"`）を完全にサポートします。以下のように `props.i18nLang` で指定した言語が設置できます：\n\n```typescript\nconst YourApp = props => {\n    // ...\n\n    const curLang = /* get your i18n language */;\n\n    return <GraphicWalker\n        data={data}\n        fields={fields}\n        i18nLang={curLang}\n    />\n}\n```\n\n### 多言語インタフェース\n\nもしいまだにサポートされていない言語を使いたいなら、Graphic Walker はリソースを JSON として読み取ることができます。開発者は\n Graphic Walker のソースコードを変更する必要なく、多言語データを入力することで他の言語を使えます。以下のように、`props.i18nResources` を設置します。\n\n```typescript\nconst yourResources = {\n    'ja-JP': {\n        'key': 'value',\n        ...\n    },\n    'fr-FR': {\n        ...\n    },\n};\n\nconst YourApp = props => {\n    // ...\n\n

It allows data scientists to analyze data and visualize patterns with simple drag-and-drop / natural language query operations. \n\n### Why is it different?\n\nIt is extremely easy to embed in your apps just as a React component 🎉! The original purpose of graphic-walker is not to be a heavy BI platform, but a easy to embed, lite, plugin.\n\n### Main features\n+ A user friendly drag and drop based interaction for exploratory data analysis with visualizations.\n+ A Data Explainer which explains why some patterns occur / what may cause them (like salesforce einstein).\n+ Using web workers to handle computational tasks which allow you to use it as a pure front-end app.\n+ A general query interface for submit data queries to your own computation service. You can have a look at how we using DuckDB to handle data queries in [PyGWalker](https://github.com/kanaries/pygwalker)\n+ Light Theme / Dark Theme! 🤩\n+ Spatial visualization. (supports GeoJSON, TopoJSON)\n+ Natural language / Chat interface. Ask question about your data!\n+ A grammar of graphics based visual analytic user interface where users can build visualizations from low-level visual channel encodings. (based on [vega-lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/))\n\nhttps://github.com/Kanaries/graphic-walker/assets/22167673/15d34bed-9ccc-42da-a2f4-9859ea36fa65\n\n\n## Usage for End Users\n\nFirst, upload your Data(csv/json) file, preview your data, and define the analytic type of columns (dimension or measure).\n\n> We are developing more types of data sources. You are welcome to raise an issue telling us the types of sources you are using. If you are a developer, graphic-walker can be used as an embedding component, and you can pass your parsed data source to it. For example, [Rath](https://github.com/Kanaries/Rath) uses graphic-walker as an embedded component, and it supports many common data sources. You can load your data in [Rath](https://github.com/Kanaries/Rath)  and bring the data into graphic-walker. In this way, users can also benefit from data cleaning and transformation features in [Rath](https://github.com/Kanaries/Rath).\n\n![graphic walker dataset upload](https://pub-8e7aa5bf51e049199c78b4bc744533f8.r2.dev/gw-readme-202402%2Fgw-ds-import.png)\n\nWhen the data is ready, click the 'Submit' button to use the data. On the left-hand side, `Field List` is all of your original columns in the table. You can drag them into visual channels (rows, columns, color, opacity, etc.) and make visualizations.\n\n![](https://pub-8e7aa5bf51e049199c78b4bc744533f8.r2.dev/gw-readme-202402%2Fgw-ui.png)\n\nYou can also view raw data any time or edit the meta data.\n\n![](https://pub-8e7aa5bf51e049199c78b4bc744533f8.r2.dev/gw-readme-202402%2Fgw-metadata.png)\n\n\nVisualize your data with drag and drop operation. For measures, you can define the aggregation methods (sum, mean, count etc.)\n\n![graphic walker bar chart](https://pub-8e7aa5bf51e049199c78b4bc744533f8.r2.dev/gw-readme-202402%2Fgw-bar01.png)\n\n\nYou can change the mark type into others to make different charts, for example a line chart.\n\n![graphic walker line chart](https://pub-8e7aa5bf51e049199c78b4bc744533f8.r2.dev/gw-readme-202402%2Fgw-line-02.png)\n\n\nTo compare different measures, you can create a concat view by adding more than one measure into rows/columns.\n\n![graphic walker area chart](https://pub-8e7aa5bf51e049199c78b4bc744533f8.r2.dev/gw-readme-202402%2Fgw-area.png)\n\nTo make a facet view of several subviews divided by the value in dimension, put dimensions into rows or columns to make a facets view. The rules are similar to Tableau.\n\n![graphic walker scatter chart](https://pub-8e7aa5bf51e049199c78b4bc744533f8.r2.dev/gw-readme-202402%2Fgw-scatter.png)\n\nWhen you finish exploration, you can save the result into a local file, which can be imported next time.\n\nSometimes you may have further questions, such as why sales in Dec. is high. Graphic Walker provides a data explainer for these cases.\n\nFor example, in bike sharing dataset, ask why registered rents in Jan. is lower than expectation, the explainer will try to find some potential explanations: \n\n![graphic walker explain data button](https://docs-us.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/images/graphic-walker/explain-data-start.png)\n\n(percent of number of working days is less than average)\n\n![graphic walker explain data result](https://docs-us.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/images/graphic-walker/explain-data-result.png)\n\n## Deploy, Usage for Developers\n\nIf you want to use Graphic Walker as a data exploration tool without thinking about deployment details, you can use our online out-of-the-box version.\n\nUse it here: [Graphic Walker Online](https://graphic-walker.kanaries.net)\n\nExamples here: [Graphic Walker Examples](https://graphic-walker.kanaries.net/examples/)\n\n### Method 1: use as an independent app.\n```bash\nyarn install\n\nyarn workspace @kanaries/graphic-walker build\n```\n\n### Method 2: Use as an embedding component module 🔥\nUsing graphic walker can be extremely easy. It provides a single React component which allows you to easily embed it in your app.\n\n```bash\nyarn add @kanaries/graphic-walker\n\n# or\n\nnpm i --save @kanaries/graphic-walker\n```\n\nIn your app:\n```typescript\nimport { GraphicWalker } from '@kanaries/graphic-walker';\n\nconst YourEmbeddingApp: React.FC<IYourEmbeddingAppProps> = props => {\n    const { data, fields } = props;\n    return <GraphicWalker\n        data={data}\n        fields={fields}\n        chart={graphicWalkerSpec}\n        i18nLang={langStore.lang}\n    />;\n}\n\nexport default YourEmbeddingApp;\n```\n\nIf you have a configuration of GraphicWalker chart, you can use the `PureRenderer` or `GraphicRenderer` component to make a single chart without controls UI.\n\n```typescript\nimport { PureRenderer } from '@kanaries/graphic-walker';\n\nconst YourChart: React.FC<IYourChartProps> = props => {\n    const { rawData, visualState, visualConfig, visualLayout } = props;\n    return <PureRenderer\n        rawData={rawData}\n        visualState={visualState}\n        visualConfig={visualConfig}\n        visualLayout={visualLayout}\n    />;\n}\n\nexport default YourChart;\n```\n\nThe `GraphicRenderer` component accepts same props as `GraphicWalker`, and would display the chart and the filters of the chart to change.\n\n```typescript\nimport { GraphicRenderer } from '@kanaries/graphic-walker';\n\nconst YourChart: React.FC<IYourChartProps> = props => {\n    const { data, fields, spec } = props;\n    return <GraphicRenderer\n        data={data}\n        fields={fields}\n        chart={spec}\n    />;\n}\n\nexport default YourChart;\n```\n\nYou can use `TableWalker` component to make a single table view with your data. it accepts same props as `GraphicWalker`, but you don't need to pass the chart prop, and you can control the page size by pageSize prop(default value is 20).\n\n```typescript\nimport { TableWalker } from '@kanaries/graphic-walker';\n\nconst YourChart: React.FC<IYourChartProps> = props => {\n    const { data, fields, spec } = props;\n    return <TableWalker\n        data={data}\n        fields={fields}\n        pageSize={50}\n    />;\n}\n\nexport default YourChart;\n```\n\n### try local (dev mode)\n```bash\n# packages/graphic-walker\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n## Share with Open Source Community\n> Please consider sharing your experience or thoughts about [graphic walker](https://github.com/Kanaries/graphic-walker) with the border Open Source community If you like this project.\n\n[![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/badge/share%20on-twitter-03A9F4?style=flat-square&logo=twitter)](https://twitter.com/share?url=https://github.com/Kanaries/graphic-walker&text=Graphic-Walker:%20A%20different%20type%20of%20open-source%20alternative%20to%20Tableau)\n[![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/badge/share%20on-facebook-1976D2?style=flat-square&logo=facebook)](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://github.com/Kanaries/graphic-walker)\n[![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/badge/share%20on-linkedin-3949AB?style=flat-square&logo=linkedin)](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https://github.com/Kanaries/graphic-walker&title=Graphic-Walker:%20A%20different%20type%20of%20open-source%20alternative%20to%20Tableau)\n[![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/badge/share%20on-hacker%20news-orange?style=flat-square&logo=ycombinator)](https://news.ycombinator.com/submitlink?u=https://github.com/Kanaries/graphic-walker)\n[![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/badge/share%20on-reddit-red?style=flat-square&logo=reddit)](https://reddit.com/submit?url=https://github.com/Kanaries/graphic-walker&title=Graphic-Walker:%20A%20different%20type%20of%20open-source%20alternative%20to%20Tableau)\n\n\n## I18n Support\n\nGraphic Walker now support _English_ (as `\"en\"` or `\"en-US\"`) , _Japanese_ (as `\"ja\"` or `\"ja-JP\"`) ,  _Chinese_ (as `\"zh\"` or `\"zh-CN\"`) with built-in locale resources. You can simply provide a valid string value (enumerated above) as `props.i18nLang` to set a language or synchronize your global i18n language with the component like the following example:\n\n```typescript\nconst YourApp = props => {\n    // ...\n\n    const curLang = /* get your i18n language */;\n\n    return <GraphicWalker\n        data={data}\n        fields={fields}\n        i18nLang={curLang}\n    />\n}\n```\n\n### Customize I18n\n\nIf you need i18n support to cover languages not supported currently, or to totally rewrite the content of any built-in resource(s), you can also provide your resource(s) as [`props.i18nResources`](#propsi18nresources) to Graphic Walker like this.\n\n```typescript\nconst yourResources = {\n    'de-DE': {\n        'key': 'value',\n        ...\n    },\n    'fr-FR': {\n        ...\n    },\n};\n\nconst YourApp = props => {\n    // ...\n\n    const curLang = /* get your i18n language */;\n\n    return <GraphicWalker\n        data={data}\n        fields={fields}\n        i18nLang={curLang}\n        i18nResources={yourResources}\n    />\n}\n```\n\nGraphic Walker uses `react-i18next` to support i18n, which is based on `i18next`, so your translation resources should follow [this format](https://www.i18next.com/misc/json-format). You can simply fork and edit `/locales/en-US.json` to start your translation.\n\nIt is recommended to use [chatGPT-i18n](https://github.com/ObservedObserver/chatgpt-i18n) to translate to your target languages.\n\n## API\n\nGraphic Walker Props & Ref interface\n\n### Props\n\n```ts\nexport interface IGWProps {\n\tdata?: IRow[];\n\tfields?: IMutField[];\n\tspec?: Specification;\n\ti18nLang?: string;\n\ti18nResources?: { [lang: string]: Record<string, string | any> };\n\tkeepAlive?: boolean | string;\n    fieldKeyGuard?: boolean;\n    vizThemeConfig?: IThemeKey;\n    apperence?: IDarkMode;\n    storeRef?: React.MutableRefObject<IGlobalStore | null>;\n    computation?: IComputationConfig;\n    toolbar?: {\n        extra?: ToolbarItemProps[];\n        exclude?: string[];\n    };\n    uiTheme?: IUIThemeConfig;\n}\n```\n\n#### `data`: optional _{ `Array<{[key: string]: any}>` }_\n\nArray of key-value object data. Provide this prop with `fields` prop together.\n\n#### `fields`: optional _{ [`IMutField`](./packages/graphic-walker/src/interfaces.ts) }_\n\nArray of fields(columns) of the data. Provide this prop with `data` prop together.\n\n#### ~~`spec`: optional _{ [`Specification`](./packages/graphic-walker/src/interfaces.ts) }_~~\n\nVisualization specification. This is an internal prop, you should not provide this prop directly. If you want to control the visualization specification, you can use [`storeRef`](#storeref) prop.\n\n#### `i18nLang`: optional _{ `string = 'en-US'` }_\n\nGraphic Walker support i18n, you can set the language of the component by this prop. Currently, we support `en-US`, `zh-CN`, `ja-JP` with built-in locale resources. If you want to use other languages, you can provide your own locale resources by [`i18nResources` prop](#i18nresources).\n\n#### `i18nResources`: optional _{ `{ [lang: string]: Record<string, string | any> }` }_\n\nCustomize locale resources. See [Customize I18n](#customize-i18n) for more details.\n\n#### `keepAlive`: optional _{ `boolean | string = false` }_\n\nWhether to keep the component state when it is unmounted. If provided, after you unmount the graphic-walker component, the state will still be stored, and will be restored when the component is mount again. If you need to enable `keepAlive` for multiple graphic-walker components, you can provide a unique string value for each component to distinguish them.\n\n#### `vizThemeConfig`: optional _{ `IThemeKey = \"vega\"` }_\n\nSpecify the chart theme to use.\n\n#### `appearance`: optional _{ `IDarkMode = \"media\"` }_\n\nSpecify the dark mode preference. There're three valid values:\n\n+ `\"media\"`: Use the system dark mode preference.\n+ `\"dark\"`: Always use dark mode.\n+ `\"light\"`: Always use light mode.\n\n#### `storeRef`: optional _{ `React.MutableRefObject<IGlobalStore | null>` }_\n\nIf you want to control the visualization specification, you can provide a `React.MutableRefObject<IGlobalStore | null>` to this prop. The `IGlobalStore` is the combined store context of Graphic Walker, you can use it to control the visualization specification.\n\n#### `computation`: optional _{ [`IComputationFunction`](./packages/graphic-walker/src/interfaces.ts) }_\n\nSpecify the computation configuration. See [Computation](./computation.md) for more details.\n\n1. Client-side computation (default)\n\nProvide noting to use client-side computation. In this mode, the computation will be done in the browser (mainly use WebWorker).\n\n2. Server-side computation\n\nGraphic Walker will call given computation function with [`IDataQueryPayload`](./packages/graphic-walker/src/interfaces.ts) as parameter. \nThe function should returns a [`IRow[]`](./packages/graphic-walker/src/interfaces.ts) as result.\nWhen you are using Server-side computation, you should provide `fields` together.\n\n#### `toolbar`: optional _{ `ToolbarProps` }_\n\nCustomize the toolbar.\n\n#### `scales`: optional _{ [`IChannelScales`](./packages/graphic-walker/src/interfaces.ts) }_\n\nCustomize the scale of color, opacity, and size channel.\nsee [Vega Docs](https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/schemes/#reference) for available color schemes.\n\nHere are some examples:\n```ts\n// use a another color pattren\nconst channelScales = {\n    color: {\n        scheme: \"tableau10\"\n    }\n}\n// use a diffrent color pattren in dark mode and light mode\nconst channelScales = {\n    color({theme}) {\n        if(theme === 'dark') {\n            return {\n                scheme: 'darkblue'\n            }\n        }else {\n            return {\n                scheme: 'lightmulti'\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n// use a custom color palette\nconst channelScales = {\n    color: {\n        range: ['red', 'blue', '#000000']\n    }\n}\n// customing opacity\nconst channelScales = {\n    // map value of 0 - 255 to opacity 0 - 1\n    opacity: {\n        range: [0, 1],\n        domain: [0, 255],\n    }\n}\n// set min radius for arc chart\nconst channelScales = {\n    radius: {\n        rangeMin: 20\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n#### `uiTheme`: optional _{ `IUIThemeConfig` }_ (beta stage)\n\nSpecify the color that graphic walker use, so the background of Graphic Walker will match to your website.\n\n> currently in beta stage, the parameter may change in the future.\n\nYou can pass either css color name (such as cyan), tailwind color name (such as zinc-900), hex color (e.g. #ff0000), hsl color (e.g. hsl(217.2 91.2% 59.8%)), or hwb color(e.g. hwb(60, 3%, 60%)).\n\nyou can also use helpers to help you create a color config.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n```tsx\nimport { getColorConfigFromPalette, getPaletteFromColor } from '@kanaries/graphic-walker'\n\nconst uiTheme: IUIThemeConfig = {\n    light: {\n        background: 'amber-100',\n        foreground: 'amber-950',\n        primary: 'amber-950',\n        'primary-foreground': 'amber-50',\n        muted: 'amber-200',\n        'muted-foreground': 'amber-500',\n        border: 'amber-300',\n        ring: 'amber-950',\n    },\n    dark: {\n        background: 'amber-900',\n        foreground: 'amber-50',\n        primary: 'amber-50',\n        'primary-foreground': 'amber-800',\n        muted: 'amber-700',\n        'muted-foreground': 'amber-400',\n        border: 'amber-700',\n        ring: 'amber-300',\n    },\n};\n\nimport colors from 'tailwindcss/colors';\nconst uiTheme = getColorConfigFromPalette(colors.zinc);\n\nconst uiTheme = getColorConfigFromPalette(getPaletteFromColor('#6366f1'));\n\n<GraphicWalker uiTheme={uiTheme} />\n```\n\n### Ref\n\n```ts\nexport interface IGWHandler {\n    chartCount: number;\n    chartIndex: number;\n    openChart: (index: number) => void;\n    get renderStatus(): IRenderStatus;\n    onRenderStatusChange: (cb: (renderStatus: IRenderStatus) => void) => (() => void);\n    exportChart: IExportChart;\n    exportChartList: IExportChartList;\n}\n```\n\n#### `chartCount`: _{ `number` }_\n\nLength of the \"chart\" tab list.\n\n#### `chartIndex`: _{ `number` }_\n\nCurrent selected chart index.\n\n#### `openChart`: _{ `(index: number) => void` }_\n\nSwitches to the specified chart.\n\n#### `renderStatus`: _{ `IRenderStatus` }_\n\nReturns the status of the current chart. It may be one of the following values:\n\n* `\"computing\"`: _GraphicWalker_ is computing the data view.\n* `\"rendering\"`: _GraphicWalker_ is rendering the chart.\n* `\"idle\"`: Rendering is finished.\n* `\"error\"`: An error occurs during the process above.\n\n#### `onRenderStatusChange`: _{ `(cb: (renderStatus: IRenderStatus) => void) => (() => void)` }_\n\nRegisters a callback function to listen to the status change of the current chart. It returns a dispose function to remove this callback.\n\n#### `exportChart`: _{ `IExportChart` }_\n\nExports the current chart.\n\n#### `exportChartList`: _{ `IExportChartList` }_\n\nExports all charts. It returns an async generator to iterate over all charts. For example:\n\n```ts\nfor await (const chart of gwRef.current.exportChartList()) {\n    console.log(chart);\n}\n```\n\n## Server integration\nFor those who need to integrate graphic-walker with their own databases/OLAP, you can develop based on our SDK [gw-dsl-parser](https://github.com/Kanaries/gw-dsl-parser)\n\nwhich translate graphic-walker specification to SQL\n\n## What's next\n\nGraphic Walker is basically manual data exploration software. When facing more complex datasets, manual exploration can cost a lot of time, [Rath](https://github.com/Kanaries/Rath) is software providing a different data analysis experience with automation enhancement.\n\n## LICENSE\n\nPlease refer to [LICENSE](./LICENSE) and [LICENSE2 for Kanaries logos](./LICENSE2) file.\n"

Walker 是一个非常规的tableau的开源替代，它可以帮助数据科学家或分析师们使用简单的拖拉拽操作就可以探索数据并制作可视化图表。\n\n##### 为什么是非常规的？\n\n因为`graphic-walker`在诞生之初并不想作为一个重型的BI系统或应用。而是作为一个轻量级的可嵌入式的插件而开发的。将他集成在自己的应用中如同安装一个插件/组件一样简单。\n\n\n##### 主要特性\n\n+ 一个简单易用的只需拖拉拽即可生成可视化的图形交互界面。\n+ 一个基于图形语法的可视化搭建系统，相比于传统的基于图表的搭建工具，能够更好的支持数据分析的场景，并在可视化探索中更加灵活。\n+ 一个提供数据中异常模式的归因解释器（tableau数据解释器/salesforce einstein）。\n+ 极其简单的嵌入方式，你可以像引入一个react组件一样简单的将graphic-walker嵌入到你的应用中。\n+ graphic-walker将重型计算放入web-worker中，充分利用客户端算力，使得其可以支持纯客户端部署。\n\n> Graphic Walker 是一个轻量级的可嵌入的可视化分析组件。 如果你对更未来的数据分析工具感兴趣，可以了解我们在做的另一个开源工具 [RATH](https://github.com/Kanaries/Rath), 一个增强分析BI应用，支持全自动的数据洞察发现，因果分析和智能可视化生成。\n\n\n## 使用\n\n首先，上传你的CSV文件，预览数据，并根据需求对数据的分析类型进行调整（列属于维度还是度量）\n\n> 我们正在开发更多的数据源支持类型，欢迎在issue中提出你希望支持的数据源类型，或参与开发贡献。如果你是一位开发者，由于Graphic Walker可以被当做嵌入系统直接使用，所以你可以通过参数传递的方式为Graphic Walker直接传递数据源，这样就无需单独为gw适配您自己的数据源类型，而是直接与当前的系统集成。\n\n![graphic walker dataset upload](https://pub-8e7aa5bf51e049199c78b4bc744533f8.r2.dev/gw-readme-202402%2Fgw-ds-import.png)\n\n\n当数据准备好后，点击确认按钮。进入分析界面。在分析界面的左侧，字段列表中列出来所有的可选字段类型，这些字段都来源于数据源中的列。你可以通过简单的拖拉拽来将他们拖入你想要的视觉通道中（如行、列、颜色、大小等）来通过可视化的方式分析他们。\n\n![](https://pub-8e7aa5bf51e049199c78b4bc744533f8.r2.dev/gw-readme-202402%2Fgw-ui.png)\n\n\n通过简单的拖拉拽来快速可视化你的数据并进行分析，对于度量，你可以自由的选择适合的聚合类型（如求和、平均等）。\n\n![graphic walker bar chart](https://pub-8e7aa5bf51e049199c78b4bc744533f8.r2.dev/gw-readme-202402%2Fgw-bar01.png)\n\n你可以调整标记类型来尝试不同的展示形式，如折线图等。\n\n![graphic walker line chart](https://pub-8e7aa5bf51e049199c78b4bc744533f8.r2.dev/gw-readme-202402%2Fgw-line-02.png)\n\n\n如果你想比对多个不同的度量，你可以将他们都拖到行或列中来创建拼接视图。这种视图可以将不同的度量平行的展示来获得更清晰的视觉比对。\n\n![graphic walker area chart](https://pub-8e7aa5bf51e049199c78b4bc744533f8.r2.dev/gw-readme-202402%2Fgw-area.png)\n\n\n你也可以为一张图表拖入额外的维度作为行或列，这样可以生成分面视图：根据维度的不同成员值将视图划分为若干的子视图，以方便更清晰的比对不同维度成员的表现情况。\n\n![graphic walker scatter chart](https://pub-8e7aa5bf51e049199c78b4bc744533f8.r2.dev/gw-readme-202402%2Fgw-scatter.png)\n\n当你完成探索，可以选择将结果导出到文件，这样你下次在分析时，可以快速的导入之前分析的结果。\n\n有时你可能会有更深的问题，比如为什么12月份的销量会高，等等。\n\n下面是一个例子，在共享单车数据集中，为什么注册用户在1月份的租用量会低于预期。数据解释器会给出潜在的解释（比如一月份的假期占比高）\n\n![](https://docs-us.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/images/graphic-walker/explain-data-start.png)\n\n![](https://docs-us.oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com/images/graphic-walker/explain-data-result.png)\n\n## 部署\n\n\n如果你想将graphic-walker作为分析工具直接使用，那可以使用我们为你构建好的在线版本。[点击这里](https://graphic-walker.kanaries.net)\n\n如果你是一位工程师，想要继承graphic-walker，可以根据情况选择适合你的方式\n### 方法一：作为独立应用使用\n\n按照应用的构建步骤依次执行。\n\n```bash\nyarn install\n\nyarn workspace @kanaries/graphic-walker build:app\n```\n\n###  方法二：作为嵌入模块使用\n\n#### 在React中使用\n\n`graphic-walker`提供了非常简单易用的集成方式，你只需要像引入react组件一样，将其引入，即可立即开始使用。\n\n```bash\nyarn add @kanaries/graphic-walker\n\n# or\n\nnpm i --save @kanaries/graphic-walker\n```\n\n在你的React App中：\n```typescript\nimport { GraphicWalker } from '@kanaries/graphic-walker';\n\nconst YourEmbeddingApp: React.FC = props => {\n    const { data, fields } = props;\n    return <GraphicWalker\n        data={data}\n        fields={fields}\n        spec={graphicWalkerSpec}\n        i18nLang={langStore.lang}\n    />\n}\n\nexport default YourEmbeddingApp;\n```\n\n如果你已经有了一个GraphicWalker图表的配置，那么你可以使用`PureRenderer`来渲染它，从而可以只显示图表而不包含控制和工具的UI\n```typescript\nimport { PureRenderer } from '@kanaries/graphic-walker';\n\nconst YourChart: React.FC = props => {\n    const { rawData, visualState, visualConfig } = props;\n    return <GraphicWalker\n        rawData={rawData}\n        visualState={visualState}\n        visualConfig={visualConfig}\n    />\n}\n\nexport default YourChart;\n```\n\n#### 在Vue3中使用\n\n虽然`graphic-walker`是一个React组件，但我们还是可以通过一些技巧在Vue3中使用它，比如利用`veaury`。\n\n首先安装`graphic-walker`：\n```bash\nyarn add @kanaries/graphic-walker\n\n# or\n\nnpm i --save @kanaries/graphic-walker\n```\n然后安装必须的支持：\n```bash\nnpm i veaury -S\n```\n\n在你的Vue3 App中创建组件：\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\n    import { applyPureReactInVue } from 'veaury'\n    import { GraphicWalker } from '@kanaries/graphic-walker'\n\n    const VueGraphicWalker = applyPureReactInVue(GraphicWalker)\n</script>\n<template>\n    <VueGraphicWalker i18nLang=\"zh-CN\" />\n</template>\n```\n\n完成。\n\n### 本地测试\n```bash\n# packages/graphic-walker\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n\n## I18n 多语言支持\n\nGraphicWalker 现在支持 _英语_ (as `\"en\"` or `\"en-US\"`) and _中文_ (as `\"zh\"` or `\"zh-CN\"`) 。其内置了多语言模块，你可以简单的通过一个语言参数来控制整个组件界面展示的语言`props.i18nLang`。具体实现可以参考下面的案例\n\n```typescript\nconst YourApp = props => {\n    // ...\n\n    const curLang = /* 这里是你的语言标签 */;\n\n    return <GraphicWalker\n        data={data}\n        fields={fields}\n        i18nLang={curLang}\n    />\n}\n```\n\n### 自定义语言\n\n如果你想要自定义组件的语言标签，可以按照对应的标签结构传入一个你的语言配置项`props.i18nResources`。如下所示\n\n```typescript\nconst yourResources = {\n    'de-DE': {\n        'key': 'value',\n        ...\n    },\n    'fr-FR': {\n        ...\n    },\n};\n\nconst YourApp = props => {\n    // ...\n\n    const curLang = /* get your i18n language */;\n\n    return <GraphicWalker\n        data={data}\n        fields={fields}\n        i18nLang={curLang}\n        i18nResources={yourResources}\n    />\n}\n```\n\n`graphic-walker` 使用了 `react-i18next`作为多语言模块，其是基于`i18next`实现的，所以建议参考其文档[格式](https://www.i18next.com/misc/json-format)。或者你也可以fork或clone此项目后，直接怼\nGraphicWalker uses `react-i18next` to support i18n, which is based on `i18next`, so your translation resources `/locales/en-US.json`进行复制并修改。\n\n## LICENSE\n\n请参考 [LICENSE](./LICENSE) 和 [LICENSE2](./LICENSE2) 文件.\n"

The computation workflow consists of a series of data queries, that describe how to compute the view data from the raw data. The computation workflow is not only used in the rendering phase, but also used in cases such as preview table, and filter editor when GraphicWalker requires the necessary statistics from the raw data.\n\n## Computation Workflow\n\nThe computation workflow contains 4 types of queries: filter query, transform query, view query, and sort query.\n\n### Filter Query (optional)\n\nThe filter query is used to filter the raw data. It contains a list of filter fields, each of which contains a filter rule.\n\n```ts\ntype IFilterRule = (\n    | {\n        type: 'range';\n        value: readonly [number, number];\n    }\n    | {\n        type: 'temporal range';\n        value: readonly [number, number];\n    }\n    | {\n        type: 'one of';\n        value: Array<any>;\n    }\n    | {\n        type: 'not in';\n        value: Array<any>;\n    }\n);\n\ninterface IFilterField {\n    fid: string;\n    rule: IFilterRule;\n}\n\ninterface IFilterQuery {\n    type: 'filter';\n    filters: Array<IFilterField>;\n}\n```\n\nThe schema of the filter query is\n\n```json\n{\n    \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\",\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n        \"type\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"enum\": [\n                \"filter\"\n            ]\n        },\n        \"filters\": {\n            \"type\": \"array\",\n            \"items\": {\n                \"type\": \"object\",\n                \"properties\": {\n                    \"fid\": {\n                        \"type\": \"string\"\n                    },\n                    \"rule\": {\n                        \"type\": \"object\",\n                        \"oneOf\": [\n                            {\n                                \"properties\": {\n                                    \"type\": {\n                                        \"type\": \"string\",\n                                        \"enum\": [\n                                            \"range\",\n                                            \"temporal range\"\n                                        ]\n                                    },\n                                    \"value\": {\n                                        \"type\": \"array\",\n                                        \"items\": {\n                                            \"type\": \"number\"\n                                        },\n                                        \"minItems\": 2,\n                                        \"maxItems\": 2\n                                    }\n                                },\n                                \"required\": [\n                                    \"type\",\n                                    \"value\"\n                                ]\n                            },\n                            {\n                                \"properties\": {\n                                    \"type\": {\n                                        \"type\": \"string\",\n                                        \"enum\": [\n                                            \"one of\",\n                                            \"not in\"\n                                        ]\n                                    },\n                                    \"value\": {\n                                        \"type\": \"array\",\n                                        \"items\": {\n                                            \"oneOf\": [\n                                                {\n                                                    \"type\": \"string\"\n                                                },\n                                                {\n                                                    \"type\": \"number\"\n                                                }\n                                            ]\n                                        }\n                                    }\n                                },\n                                \"required\": [\n                                    \"type\",\n                                    \"value\"\n                                ]\n                            }\n                        ]\n                    }\n                },\n                \"required\": [\n                    \"fid\",\n                    \"rule\"\n                ]\n            }\n        }\n    },\n    \"required\": [\n        \"type\",\n        \"filters\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n### Transform Query (optional)\n\nThe transform query is used to resolve the field calculations. It contains a list of transform fields, each of which contains an expression.\n\n```ts\ntype IExpParameter = (\n    | {\n        type: 'field';\n        value: string;\n    }\n    | {\n        type:

Query (required)\n\nThe view query is used to shape the data into a view data. It contains a list of view queries, each of which contains a view-level operation. A workflow must contain at least one view-level operation, which describes the structure of the view data.\n\nAt the moment, there are 3 view-level operations: aggregate, fold, and raw.\n\n#### Aggregate Query\n\nUse the aggregate operation in the view query when you want the data to be aggregated. The aggregate operation contains a list of measures to be aggregated by a specified aggregation function with the group-by fields.\n\n```ts\ntype IAggregator = 'sum' | 'count' | 'max' | 'min' | 'mean' | 'median' | 'variance' | 'stdev';\n\ninterface IAggQuery {\n    op: 'aggregate';\n    groupBy: string[];\n    measures: {\n        field: string;\n        agg: IAggregator;\n        asFieldKey: string;\n    }[];\n}\n```\n\n#### Raw Query\n\nUse the raw operation in the view query when you want the data not to be aggregated. The raw operation contains a list of fields to be included in the view data.\n\n```ts\ninterface IRawQuery {\n    op: 'raw';\n    fields: string[];\n}\n```\n\nAn aggregate query will be\n\n```ts\ntype IViewQuery = IAggQuery | IRawQuery;\n\ninterface IViewQuery {\n    type: 'view';\n    query: Array<IViewQuery>;\n}\n```\n\nThe schema of the view query is\n\n```json\n{\n    \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\",\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n        \"type\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"enum\": [\n                \"view\"\n            ]\n        },\n        \"query\": {\n            \"type\": \"array\",\n            \"items\": {\n                \"oneOf\": [\n                    {\n                        \"type\": \"object\",\n                        \"properties\": {\n                            \"op\": {\n                                \"type\": \"string\",\n                                \"enum\": [\n                                    \"aggregate\"\n                                ]\n                            },\n                            \"groupBy\": {\n                                \"type\": \"array\",\n                                \"items\": {\n                                    \"type\": \"string\"\n                                }\n                            },\n                            \"measures\": {\n                                \"type\": \"array\",\n                                \"items\": {\n                                    \"type\": \"object\",\n                                    \"properties\": {\n                                        \"field\": {\n                                            \"type\": \"string\"\n                                        },\n                                        \"agg\": {\n                                            \"type\": \"string\",\n                                            \"enum\": [\n                                                \"sum\",\n                                                \"count\",\n                                                \"max\",\n                                                \"min\",\n                                                \"mean\",\n                                                \"median\",\n                                                \"variance\",\n                                                \"stdev\"\n                                            ]\n                                        },\n                                        \"asFieldKey\": {\n                                            \"type\": \"string\"\n                                        }\n                                    },\n                                    \"required\": [\n                                        \"field\",\n                                        \"agg\",\n                                        \"asFieldKey\"\n                                    ]\n                                }\n                            }\n                        },\n                        \"required\": [\n                            \"op\",\n                            \"groupBy\",\n                            \"measures\"\n                        ]\n                    },\n                    {\n                        \"type\": \"object\",\n                        \"properties\": {\n                            \"op\": {\n                                \"type\": \"string\",\n                                \"enum\": [\n                                    \"raw\"\n                                ]\n                            },\n                            \"fields\": {\n                                \"type\": \"array\",\n                                \"items\": {\n                                    \"type\": \"string\"\n                                }\n                            }\n                        },\n                        \"required\": [\n                            \"op\",\n                            \"fields\"\n                        ]\n                    }\n                ]\n            }\n        }\n    },\n    \"required\": [\n        \"type\",\n        \"query\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n### Sort Query (optional)\n\nThe filter query is used to sort the result data.
