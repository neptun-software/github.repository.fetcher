It is well engineered, provides an\nautograd-style interface to backprop, and has committed to supporting Node.\nThis satisfies our requirements. It is counterproductive to pursue a parallel\neffort. Thus we are abandoning our backprop implementation, TF C binding, and\nthe TF/DL bridge, which made up the foundation of the Propel library. We intend\nto rebase our work on top of TFJS.\n\nOur high-level goal continues to be a productive workflow for scientific\ncomputing in JavaScript. Building on top of TFJS allows us to focus on\nhigher-level functionality.\n\nWe have no release at this time.\n"
