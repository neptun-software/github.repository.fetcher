The extension settings documentation has been updated to align with the latest gopls settings.\n* Increased the [Go telemetry](https://go.dev/doc/telemetry) prompt rate to 100%.\n* Debugging: will not open Debug Console when `debug.internalConsoleOption` is `neverOpen`. ([CL 627675](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/627675))\n\n#### Tools installation\n\n* The extension requires go1.21 or newer when it installs required tools. If your project must use go1.20 or older,\nplease manually install [compatible versions of required tools](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/compatibility),\nor configure the [`\"go.toolsManagement.go\"` setting](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/settings#gotoolsmanagementgo)\nto use the go1.21 or newer when installing tools. ([Issue 3411](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/3411))\n\n### Code Health\n\n* Extension build target is set to `es2022`. ([Issue 3540](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/3540))\n* The extension release workflow is migrated to the Go project's [Relui](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/build/cmd/relui#section-readme). ([Issue 3500](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/3500))\n\n### Testing\n\nA new extension, [Go Companion](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ethan-reesor.exp-vscode-go), has been released with experimental support for gopls-based test discovery. If Go Companion is installed, pre-release versions of this extension will automatically disable its test explorer in favor of Go Companion's implementation. See [experiments](./docs/experiments.md#test-explorer) for details on Go Companion's features and for disabling the automatic switchover.\n\n## v0.43.4 (prerelease)\n\nDate: 2024-12-05\n\nThis is the [pre-release version](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#prerelease-extensions) of v0.44.\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.42.0-rc.1...v0.43.4\n**Milestone**: https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues?q=milestone%3Av0.44.0\n\n## v0.43.3 (prerelease)\n\nDate: 2024-11-18\n\nThis is the [pre-release version](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#prerelease-extensions) of v0.44.\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.42.0-rc.1...v0.43.3\n**Milestone**: https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues?q=milestone%3Av0.44.0\n\n## v0.42.1\n\nDate: 9 Sep, 2024\n\nA comprehensive list of changes can be found in the complete [commit history](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.42.0..v0.42.1).\n\n### Changes\n\n* Prompt users for the [2024 Go Developer survey](https://google.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_ei0CDV2K9qQIsp8?s=p). ([Issue 3517](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/3517))\n* Updated the default versions of `gomodifytags`, `impl`, `gofumpt`, and `revive`. ([CL 607757](https://go.dev/cl/607757)).\n* Increased the Go telemetry prompt rate to 25%. The new Go blog post [\"Telemetry in Go 1.23 and beyond\"](https://go.dev/blog/gotelemetry) discusses how Go telemetry helps improving the reliability and the performance of go toolchain programs.\n\n## v0.43.0 (pre-release)\n\nDate: 22 Aug, 2024\n\nThis is the [pre-release version](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#prerelease-extensions) of v0.44. The nightly (golang.go-nightly) extension will be deprecated in favor of the pre-release version.\n\n## v0.42.0\n\nDate: 17 Jul, 2024\n\nA comprehensive list of changes can be found in the complete [commit history](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.41.4..v0.42.0).\n\n### Updates in `gopls`\n\n* Gopls v0.16: The latest gopls version as of this release is [gopls v0.16](https://github.com/golang/tools/releases/tag/gopls%2Fv0.16.0). The extension settings documentation has been updated to align with the latest gopls settings.\n* The gopls project provides an index of [all supported features](https://github.com/golang/tools/tree/master/gopls/doc/features). We are working on making this documentation more accessible from the extension. Please stay tuned for updates.\n\n### Updates in telemetry\n\nThis extension continues to use [Go toolchain telemetry](https://go.dev/doc/telemetry).\nBy default, telemetry data is kept only on the local computer, but you can opt in to share it with the Go team with one of the following ways:\n\n- `go run golang.org/x/telemetry/cmd/gotelemetry@latest on` in the terminal, or\n- `go telemetry on`, from go1.23, or\n- Respond to the prompt when it appears.\n\nOnce uploading is enabled, the data will be sent to https://telemetry.go.dev approximately once a week.\n\n### Changes\n\n#### Tools installation\n\n* For tools installation managed by the extension, this version requires go1.19 or newer version. The next minor release (v0.43.0+) will require go1.21 or newer to install tools. If your project requires go1.20 or older to build, you will need to manually install [compatible versions of tools](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/tools), or configure the [`\"go.toolsManagement.go\"` setting](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/settings#gotoolsmanagementgo) to use go1.21+ when installing the tools.\n\n* The extension installs its required tools using the `go install` command. Starting go1.21, the `go` command allows tool authors to specify the minimum Go version required to build their tools. If the required go toolchain version is not locally available, the `go` command needs to download it like other dependencies of the tool. To ensure this toolchain switch works correctly, the extension enforces `GOTOOLCHAIN=auto` mode during tools installation. Note that this change does not affect how it builds and tests your own project.  For more information about Go's toolchain switch behavior, see the [official documentation](https://go.dev/doc/toolchain).\n\n#### Debugging\n\n* The default launch.json template for \"Go: Launch Package\" was updated to use `\"${workspaceFolder}${1:}\"` instead of `\"${fileDirname}\"` as the default `\"program\"` attribute value. If the package to debug is located in the subdirectory, adjust the configuration to point to the main package path. The [official VS Code Variables Reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/variables-reference) lists useful substitution rules you can use in adjusting your launch.json setting.\n\n### Thanks\n\nThanks for your contributions, @yimiaoxiehou!\n\n\n## v0.41.4\n\nDate: 24 Apr, 2024\n\nThis point release addresses a regression issue (spurious display of the Go welcome page)  within cloud-based IDEs.\n\nSee the full\n[commit history](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.41.3...v0.41.4)\nfor detailed changes.\n\n## v0.41.3\n\nDate: 22 Apr, 2024\n\nThis point release temporarily reverts the default remote debugging behavior to\nuse the legacy debug adapter due to existing feature gaps.\nOnce these gaps are addressed as outlined in\n[Issue 3096](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/3096),\nwe plan to switch the default back to use Delve DAP for remote deubgging.\n\nIf you want to continue using [Delve DAP for remote debugging](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/debugging#connect-to-headless-delve-with-target-specified-at-server-start-up), use the following\nsettings in your `launch.json`.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"name\": \"Debug Remote\",\n    \"type\": \"go\",\n    \"request\": \"attach\",\n    \"mode\": \"remote\",\n    \"debugAdapter\": \"dlv-dap\", // Use Delve DAP\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nSee the full\n[commit history](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.41.2...v0.41.3)\nfor detailed changes.\n\n### Fixes\n- Fixed to substitute variables used in `go.alternateTools` setting's\n  `customFormatter` entry ([Issue 2582](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2582)).\n- Corrected handling of `go.showWelcome` setting\n  ([Issue 3319](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/3319)).\n- Addressed Go telemetry prompt issue in the latest Visual Studio Code\n  ([Issue 3312](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/3312)).\n\n### Thanks\n\nThanks for your contributions, @uniquefine, @monitor1379, @suzmue, @hyangah!\n\n## v0.41.2\n\nDate: 14 Mar, 2024\n\nThis release is a point release to increase the prompt rate of Go telemetry\nopt-in. Learn more at https://go.dev/doc/telemetry.\nFor a detailed list of changes, refer to the complete\n[commit history](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.41.1...v0.41.2).\n\n### Fixes\n- Fixed [Issue 2414](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2414) that prevented\nrecognizing testify suites spanning multiple files. ([PR 3128](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/pull/3128))\n- Fixed the \"Open 'gopls' trace\" submenu in \"Go: Choose Go Environment\" command. ([Issue 3236](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/3236))\n\n### Thanks\n\nThanks for your contributions! @Cr4zySheep, @nirhaas\n\n## v0.41.1\n\nDate: 22 Feb, 2024\n\nThis release is a point release to skip `vscgo` installation on Windows\n([Issue 3182](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/3182)).\nFor a detailed list of changes, refer to the complete\n[commit history](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.41.0...v0.41.1).\n\n## v0.41.0\n\nDate: 14 Feb, 2024\n\nThis release introduces significant updates to the extension's UI.\nWe also want to share the news that the [gopls v0.15 release](https://go.dev/s/gopls-v0.15)\nenhances the multi-module workspace experience and improves build tag handling.\n\nFor a detailed list of changes, refer to the complete [commit\nhistory](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.40.3...v0.41.0).\n\n### Changes\n\n#### Gopls v0.15.0 and Workspace Configuration\n* The gopls v0.15 introduces a [significant change](https://go.dev/s/gopls-v0.15)\n  in its internal workspace data model. Known as [\"zero configuration\"\n  gopls](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/57979), `gopls` can automatically\n  determines workspace configurations such as Go module boundaries and necessary\n  GOOS/GOARCH build tags for open Go files. This eliminates the need for users\n  to align the VS Code workspace root folders with the Go module root folder.\n* For more details and additional feature updates, refer to the [gopls v0.15.0\n  release notes](https://go.dev/s/gopls-v0.15). The extension's\n  settings have been updated to align with gopls v0.15.0 settings.\n\n#### UI Updates\n* A new [language status\n  bar](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/ui#using-the-language-status-bar)\n  is added, visible when working on Go-related files. The [Go status\n  bar](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/ui#using-the-go-status-bar),\n  which displays the selected Go version and the gopls status, is now located at\n  the bottom right of the window and is visible only when Go files are open.\n* The \"Go\" and \"Go Debug\" output channels are now primarily used for logging\n  extension activities such as dependency tool installation, invocation, and\n  debug logging. Use the `\"Developer: Set Log Level...\"` command to adjust the\n  logging level. The `go.logging.level` setting is deprecated in favor of this\n  new logging mechanism.\n* The `\"Go: Locate Configured Go Tools\"` command now opens an untitled file and\n  dumps the tools information there, instead of printing it in the \"Go\" output\n  channel. This change allows users to inspect and edit the output easily before\n  sharing it in their issue report.\n\n#### Debugging\n* [Remote\n  debugging](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/debugging#remote-debugging)\n  now defaults to using delve DAP. The legacy debug adapter will be removed in\n  the next release cycle.\n* [Delve\n  1.22.0](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1220-2023-12-29)\n  introduces new options to [display 'pprof'\n  labels](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/issues/3493) and [use concise symbol\n  and stack presentation](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/issues/3516). Update\n  delve to the latest version using the `\"Go: Install/Update Tools\"` command.\n\n#### Tools\n* For new users, the extension will automatically install important tools\n  (`gopls` and an optionally selected extra lint tool such as `staticcheck` or\n  `golangci-lint`) if they are missing, using `go install` commands. Any\n  installation failures will be surfaced in the [language status\n  bar](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/ui#using-the-go-status-bar) and\n  the \"Go\" output channel.\n* The extension does not require `dlv` installation until the debug feature is\n  invoked.\n* The extension now installs\n  [`vscgo`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/golang/vscode-go/vscgo), an\n  optional tool used to [update the Go telemetry\n  counters](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/3121). This tool is\n  installed in the extension's directory.\n\n#### Telemetry\n* The Go telemetry now measures activation latency. ([CL\n  549244](https://go-review.git.corp.google.com/c/vscode-go/+/549244))\n\n### Fixes\n* The extension now recognizes idx as a Web IDE. ([CL\n  559895](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/559895))\n* The deprecated `web-request` has been replaced with `node-fetch@v2`. ([Issue\n  2995](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2995))\n\n### Development Process Updates\n* The repository layout has been updated with the extension code moved to the\n  `extension/` directory. See [Issue\n  3122](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/3122) for more details.\n* The extension release workflow has been moved to Google Cloud Build.\n\n## v0.40.3\n\nDate: 22 Jan, 2024\n\nThis is a point release to update the upcoming developer survey information\n([the commit history](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.40.1...v0.40.3)).\n\n## v0.40.1\n\nDate: 21 Dec, 2023\n\nThis is a point release to fix minor bugs. A comprehensive list of bug fixes and\nchanges can be found in\n[the milestone](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/milestone/60) and\n[the commit history](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.40.0...v0.40.1).\n\n### Changes\n\n* We adjusted the extension activation behavior. The extension will not be\n  activated until Go files are open or the extension's commands are invoked.\n  ([Issue 3038](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/3038), and\n  [2164](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2164)).\n* The [`GOTOOLCHAIN`](https://go.dev/doc/toolchain) environment variable is\n  shown from the [Go explorer\n  view](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/ui#go-explorer-view).\n\n### Fixes\n\n* [Pprof result viewer](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/features#profiling)\n  now works with the [remote development setup](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview).\n  ([Issue 3090](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/3090)).\n* Subtests that include regexp metacharacters in their names are now properly\n  handled. ([Issue 2624](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2624),\n  [3070](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/3070))\n* When the extension detects `go` installed by snap, it will use\n  `/snap/go/current/bin/go` as the go command path to work around a bug in\n  snapd. ([Issue 166](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/166)).\n* We enhanced the automated issue reporting feature to be robust in collecting\n  gopls crash logs and handling transient errors during gopls upgrade.\n  ([Issue 984](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/984),\n  [2690](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2690)).\n* The extension now respects user's `editor.parameterHints.enabled` and shows\n  parameter hints after completion only if it is enabled.\n  ([Issue 3071](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/3071))\n* Ran `npm audit fix` and that updated `semver` and `word-wrap` dependencies.\n  ([CL 551055](https://go.dev/cl/551055)).\n\n### Thanks\n\nThank you for your contribution @tekig, @rogeryk, @hyangah!\n\n## v0.40.0\n\nDate: 15 Nov, 2023\n\nThis extension uses [Go Telemetry](https://telemetry.go.dev/privacy) to gather insights\nabout the performance and stability of the extension and the language server it employs.\nBy default, Telemetry uploading is disabled, but starting from this version,\na small number of users will be prompted to enable it. Users can enable uploading of telemetry data\nby either responding to the prompt or running the following command:\n\n```\ngo run golang.org/x/telemetry/cmd/gotelemetry@latest on\n```\n\nOnce uploading is enabled, the data will be sent to https://telemetry.go.dev\neach week. You can find more information about this process at\n[https://telemetry.go.dev/privacy](https://telemetry.go.dev) and in the\n[gopls v0.14 release notes](https://github.com/golang/tools/releases/tag/gopls%2Fv0.14.0).\n\nA comprehensive list of changes can be found in the complete\n[commit history](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.40.0...v0.39.1).\n\n### Changes\n\n* In this release, we have removed legacy language feature providers that were supported\nby outdated tools. As a result, features such as code completion, navigation,\ndocumentation, diagnostics, and refactoring will only function\nwhen the language server (`gopls`) is enabled.\n([Issue 2799](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2799))\n\n* The \"Go: Fill struct\" command has been retired. The same functionality is provided\nas a [Code Action](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/refactoring#_code-actions-quick-fixes-and-refactorings)\nfor refactoring. You can refer to the screenshot for details.\n([Issue 2107](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2107)))\n\n* The \"Go: Extract to function\" and \"Go: Extract to variable\" commands are no longer needed,\nas they have been replaced by Code Actions provided by gopls.\n([Issue 2862](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2862))\n\n* The \"buildFlags\" attribute for Go launch configuration now accepts a list of strings in\naddition to a string. If using delve at v1.22.2 or newer, this list is passed directly to\ndelve. This should help with bugs related to parsing the string of buildFlags, such as in\n[Issue 1831](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1831) and\n[Issue 1027](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1027).\n([Issue 3009](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/3009))\n\n* The \"Go: Toggle Hide System Goroutines\" command was added to make it easier to switch between\nshowing / hiding the system goroutines in the callstack view. This command is also\navailable in the callstack context menu. The default setting can be updated by updating\n\"hideSystemGoroutines\" in either the launch.json or in the \"go.delveConfig\" setting.\n([Issue 1797](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1797#issuecomment-1762145244))\n\n### Fixes\n\n* We have enhanced environment variable substitution. Environment variable references\nlike `${env:VAR}` in the `go.toolsEnvVars` setting\n([Issue 2680](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2680)) and the `go.goroot` setting\n([Issue 3006](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/3006)) are now correctly substituted.\nPatterns like `${VAR}` inside environment files (`go.testEnvFile`) can be used to reference\nother environment variables as well. ([Issue 1902](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1902))\n\n### Compatibilities\n\n* This extension version requires VS Code 1.75 (January 2023 version) or newer.\nThe README.md provides a list of VS Code and Go version requirements.\n* For tools installation managed by the extension, you need go1.18 or a newer version.\n([Issue 2898](golang/vscode-go#2898))\n* The extension has been tested with gopls v0.14 and delve v1.21.\n\n### Thanks\n\nThank you for your contribution @n1lesh, @suzmue, @hyangah!\n\n## v0.39.1\n\nDate: 17 Jul, 2023\n\nThis is a point release to update the link for the upcoming Go developer survey.\nA list of changes can be found in the full [commit history](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.39.1...v0.39.0).\n\n## v0.39.0\n\nDate: 12 Jun, 2023\n\nWe are in the process of removing legacy language features that were replaced by `gopls` since early 2021. The versions released after September 2023 will no longer offer features like code completion, navigation, documentation, formatting, and refactoring if the language server is disabled. In this release, we are showing deprecation notification messages if you are using the legacy language features. ([Issue 2799](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2799))\n\nA list of all issues and changes can be found in the [v0.39.0 milestone](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/milestone/55) and [commit history](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.39.0...v0.38.0).\n\n### Changes\n- Added the [`go.showWelcome`](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/settings#goshowwelcome) setting that controls whether to show the Welcome page. ([PR 2704](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/pull/2704)) <!-- CL 501208 -->\n- Report when `go.toolsManagement.go` setting is invalid and ignored. ([Issue 2753](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2753)) <!-- CL 501056 -->\n- Removed `go.languageServerExperimentalFeatures` setting which was deprecated in v0.21.0. ([Issue 1109](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1109)) <!-- CL 501199 -->\n- Deprecated settings that affect only legacy language features and tools. They will be removed in the release after September 2023. ([Issue 2799](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2799)) <!-- CL 501206 -->\n- `\"Go: Update/Install Tools\"` will install the latest version of `golangci-lint` instead of a vetted, pinned version. The extension chose to pin the versions of third-party go tools it installs in order to manage version skew and reduce security risks. However, `golangci-lint` is frequently released and its community is active enough to handle compatibility/security issues. We decided to install the latest version by default. ([Issue 2763](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2763), [2485](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2485))\n\n- Debug: show error when the process picker is hidden ([CL 499601](https://go.dev/cl/499601)). To learn more about the process picker in debug, see [Launch.json \"processId\" documentation](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/debugging#launchjson-attributes). <!-- CL 499601 -->\n- Debug: `args` attribute now accepts a `string` typed value. The argument string is parsed into word arguments with rules similar to `bash` except that there is no shell expansion. This change allows to use vscode variables like `${input:args}`. ([Issue 2621](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2621)) <!-- CL 469378 -->\n- The extension no longer cache PATH environment variable, which helps interoperate with extensions that modify `PATH`. ([Issue 2617](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2617)) <!-- CL 494555 -->\n- Updated LSP to v3.17.3 and VS Code language client library to v8.1.0. This includes fixes for request ordering issues around full document sync and bugs around shutdown. <!-- CL 473157 -->\n- Replaced the extension user survey link to https://go.dev/s/ide-hats-survey. ([CL 497536](https://go.dev/cl/497536)) <!-- CL 497536 -->\n- Updated settings to sync with [gopls@v0.12](https://go.dev/s/gopls-v0.12).\n- Third-party go tools dependencies: use gofumpt@v0.5.0 and revive@v1.3.2 and install staticcheck@v0.3.3 when building with go1.18 or older.\n\n### Delopment process updates\n- Updated `@vscode/vsce` version to address the [xml2js prototype pollution vulnerability report](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-776f-qx25-q3cc) <!-- CL 494997 -->\n\n### Documentation\n- Debugging documentation includes tips for debugging with `-trimpath`. ([Issue 2609](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2609))\n- Added advanced [semantic syntax highlighting options](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/features#syntax-highlighting).

These vulncheck analysis tools are backed by [Go's vulnerability database](https://go.dev/security/vulndb) and the Go language server's integration of [`govulncheck`](https://golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck\").\nRead [Go's support for vulnerability management](https://go.dev/blog/vuln) to learn about the Go team's approach to helping Go developers secure their open-source dependencies.\n\n### Changes\n- The new \"Go: Toggle Vulncheck\" command enables/disables imports-based vulnerability analysis. This requires gopls v0.11.0 or newer.\n- Test and debug test code lenses are added to some subtests if the test names can be determined. ([Issue 2536](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2536))\n- Gopls settings was updated to match gopls@v0.11.0.\n- `\"go.formatTool\"` setting accepts a special value `\"custom\"`, which causes the extension to use the custom formatter configured with the setting `\"go.alternateTools\": { \"customFormatter\": <your custom tool name> }`. ([Issue 2503](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2503))\n- The experimental \"Go: Run Vulncheck (exp)\" command was removed.\n- The extension no longer bypasses Delve's Go version check by default. Users must install the delve version compatible with their Go version, or explicitly configure their launch configuration to pass the `--check-go-version=false` flag using the `dlvFlags` attribute. ([Go Delve Issue 3058](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/issues/3058))\n\n### Fixes\n- The editor survey prompt logic was adjusted for uniform sampling. ([Issue 2545](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2545))\n- Fixed the crash bug when handling coverage profiles involving go `//line`-directive. ([Issue 2453](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2453))\n- Updated dependencies to address [CVE-2022-37603](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-37603) and [CVE-2022-24999](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-24999).\n\n### Thanks\n\nThank you for your contribution, @devuo, @pjweinbgo, @aarzilli, @tklauser, @hyangah, @suzmue, @jamalc!\n\n## v0.36.0\n\nDate: 7 Nov, 2022\nA list of all issues and changes can be found in the [v0.36.0 milestone](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/milestone/52) and [commit history](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.35.2...v0.36.0).\n\n### Changes\n- From this release, the extension will download specific versions of 3rd party tools installed with the \"Go: Install/Update Tools\" command. This is to enhance stability and security. The \"Go: Install/Upate Tools\" command will present the versions the extension will install. To install a different version of a tool, use `go install` command from the terminal instead. ([Issue 1850](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1850))\n- The default gopls version was updated to v0.10.1 and the settings were updated accordingly. See the [release note of gopls v0.10.0](https://github.com/golang/tools/releases/tag/gopls%2Fv0.10.0) to learn about notable changes and new features.\n- Typing `vars` will now offer a completion snippet that expands it to a `var (...)` block containing multiple variables. ([PR 2481](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/pull/2481))\n- The setting to enable the \"references\" codelens, `go.enableCodeLens.references`, is now hidden. The feature remained broken for a while, so we plan to remove it in a future release. Please see [Issue 2509](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues#2509) for details.\n- When debugging tests, the extension will open the \"Debug Console\". ([Issue 2409](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2409))\n\n### Fixes\n- Fixed [Issue 2525](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2525) that prevented triggering of parameter hints after method autocompletion. Users can enable/disable this parameter hints popup with the `\"editor.parameterHints.enabled\"` setting.\n- Fixed [test profie feature](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/features#profiling) ([CL 440530](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/440530)).\n- Removed dev dependency affected by CVE-2022-3517.\n\n### Thanks\nThank you for your contribution, @suzmue, @fatoboist, @cuishuang, @jamalc, @karthikraobr, @pjweinbgo, @firelizzard18, @hyangah!\n\n## v0.35.2\n\nDate: 15 Aug, 2022\nA list of all issues and changes can be found in the [v0.35.2 milestone](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/milestone/51) and [commit history](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.35.1...v0.35.2).\n\n### Changes\n\nThis release includes a new [go.goroot command](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2379), [fixes](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2342) to the `Generate Tests` commands, and improvements for windows users.\n\n### Thanks\n\nThank you for your contribution, @OrBin, @Ras96, @hyangah, @jamalcarvalho, and @suzmue!\n\n## v0.35.1\n\nDate: 19 July, 2022\n\nA list of all issues and changes can be found in the [v0.35.1 milestone](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/milestone/50) and [commit history](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.35.0...v0.35.1).\n\n### Bug Fix\n- Disabled experimental gopls features (e.g. semantic highlighting).\n\n## v0.35.0\n\nDate: 18 July, 2022\n\nA list of all issues and changes can be found in the [v0.35.0 milestone](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/milestone/47) and [commit history](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.34.1...v0.35.0).\n\n### Features\n- This release adds support for inlay hints ([Issue 1631](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1631)).\n- Add logic to support ${workspaceFolderBasename} substitution in extension settings ([Issue 2310](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2310)).\n- Add support for multi-file test suite ([Issue 1130](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1130)).\n- Add support for custom formatters.\n\n### Bug Fix\n- Fixed (Issue [2339](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/#2339)) that prevented updating delve on arm64 Macs.\n\n### Thanks\nThank you for your contribution, @hyangah, @nirhaas, @bentekkie, @jamalc, and @suzmue.\n\n## v0.34.1\n\nDate: 30 June, 2022\n\nA list of all issues and changes can be found in the [v0.34.1 milestone](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/milestone/48) and [commit history](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.34.0...v0.34.1).\n\n### Bug Fix\n- Fixed (Issue [2300](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2300)) that prevented the extension from complete activation when the language server fails to start.\n\n### Thanks\nThank you for your contribution, @jamalc, @hyangh!\n\n## v0.34.0\n\nDate: 22 June, 2022\n\nThis release adds support for [LSP 3.17](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#whatIsNew) and requires Visual Studio Code [1.67+](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_67).\n\n### Features\nThis release includes improvements to the `Go: Run Vulncheck (Experimental)` command ([Issue 2185](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2185), [2186](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2186), [2214](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2214)). Use it to find security issues in your dependencies.\n\n### Documentation\nDocumentation for vscode-go can now be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki) ([Issue 2094](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2094)).\n\nThanks @thediveo for updating the debugging documentation!\n\n### Bug Fixes\n`TestMain(m *testing.M)` is no longer treated as a test ([Issue 482](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/482), [2039](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2039))\n\n### Code Health\n- Enabled strict type checking ([Issue 57](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/57))\n- Updated release notes generation script to improve release process automation\n- Fixed bugs in testing\n\n### Thanks\n\nThank you for your contribution, @hyangah, @jamalc, @polinasok, @suzmue, @thediveo, and @dle8!\n\n## v0.33.1\n\nDate: 24 May, 2022\n\nThis is the last release that supports Visual Studio Code 1.66 or older.\nWe plan to add support for [LSP 3.17](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#whatIsNew) in the next release and the change requires Visual Studio Code [1.67+](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_67).\n\n### Changes\n\n* Updated settings to be in sync with `gopls@v0.8.4`. See [the release note](https://github.com/golang/tools/releases/tag/gopls%2Fv0.8.4) to learn new features like the `//go:embed` analyzer, and improved hover for imported packages.\n* Prepared for 2022 mid-year Go developer survey.\n\n## v0.33.0\n\nDate: 1 May, 2022\n\n📣 [Remote attach debugging](docs/debugging.md#connecting-to-headless-delve-with-target-specified-at-server-start-up) is now available via Delve's native DAP implementation with Delve v1.7.3 or newer. It is now the default with the [Go Nightly](docs/nightly.md) and will become the default for the stable releases in mid 2022.\n\n### Changes\n\n* `staticcheck`: if go 1.16.x or older is used in installing tools, the extension chooses `staticcheck@v0.2.2`. In order to use the latest version of `staticcheck` while working on projects that require older versions of go, you can utilize the `\"go.toolsManagement.go\"` setting to specify a newer version of go for tool installation. ([Issue 2162](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2162))\n\n* `go-outline`: `go-outline` is no longer required when `gopls` (v0.8.2+) is used.\n\n* Activation: the extension defers commands and feature provider registrations until it runs `go version` and `go env`, and starts `gopls`. [This change](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/398155) prevent the extension prematually export its features, but may result in a slight increase in extension activation time if those commands run slow.\n\n* Survey: we show the gopls opt-out survey prompt only when users change the setting to disable `gopls`.\n\n* Test Explorer: fixed a bug in `go.mod` file parsing ([Issue 2171](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2171))\n\n* Debugging: we removed the informational popup at the start of remote attach session with `dlv-dap`. ([Issue 2018](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2018))\n\n### Experimental features\n\nThis version includes two highly experimental features. They are still\nin early stage and we are looking forward to hearing more user feedback.\n\n* [Go Explorer view](docs/ui.md#go-explorer-view): it displays environment variables and information about tools used by the extension. ([Issue 2049](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2049))\n\n* `Go: Run Vulncheck (Experimental)` command: it runs the `govulncheck` command embedded in `gopls`, which identifies known vulnerabilities by call graph traversal and module dependency analysis. ([Issue 2096](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2096))\n\n### Thanks\n\n@jamalc, @polinasok, @dlipovetsky, @vladdoster, @suzmue, @hyangah\n\n## v0.32.0\n\nDate: 8 Mar, 2022\n\nThis version includes features to enhance Go 1.18 support. It works best when paired with the latest Go Language Server ([`gopls` v0.8.0+](https://github.com/golang/tools/releases/tag/gopls%2Fv0.8.0)) and Delve ([`dlv` v1.8.0+](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#changelog)).\n\n[Go 1.18](https://go.dev/doc/go1.18) introduces substantial changes to [the language spec](https://go.dev/doc/go1.18#generics), so many tools need rebuilding with Go 1.18 or newer. The extension now suggests updates of tools if it finds they were built with old versions of `go` which are inadequate for the version used for the project. If you [opted in for auto-update](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/settings.md#gotoolsmanagementautoupdate), tools will be auto-updated.\n\nIn order to use Go 1.18, please follow [the instruction to configure your Visual Studio Code to locate the right go binary](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/advanced.md#using-go118), and run the Go tools using the \"Go: Install/Update Tools\" command.\n\nA list of all issues and changes can be found in the [v0.32.0 milestone](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/milestone/42) and [commit history](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.31.1...v0.32.0).\n\n### Changes\n\n- Starting with Go 1.18,  the `go` command provides native support for multi-module workspaces, via  [`go.work`](https://go.dev/ref/mod#workspaces) files. The new \"Open 'go.work'\" option in the Go status bar's quickpick menu allows users to access the corresponding `go.work` file.\n![go work short](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4999471/157268414-fba63843-5a14-44ba-be82-d42765568856.gif)\n\n- The extension no longer depends on [`gopkgs`](https://github.com/uudashr/gopkgs/cmd/gopkgs). Its use for \"Go: Browse Packages\" and \"Go: Add Import\" commands had been replaced with `go list` or commands in `gopls`. ([Issue 258](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/258))\n\n- The extension uses `gopls` instead of `go-outline` if `gopls` v0.8.0 or newer is used. We plan to complete the replacement work in the next release. ([Issue 1020](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1020))\n\n- The new [`\"go.toolsManagement.go\"` setting](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/settings.md#gotoolsmanagementgo) allows users to specify the Go command for tools installation/updates separate from the Go command used for the project.\n\n- The latest `gopls` requires go 1.13+ for installation, so the extension no longer asks for `gopls` updates when an older versions of `go` is used. ([Issue 2030](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2030)) Note `gopls` compiled with go 1.13 or newer can still process projects that use go 1.12. If you want to update `gopls` while working with an older version of Go, utilize the new `\"go.toolsManagement.go\"` setting.\n\n- Reduced the verbosity of \"Go: Locate Configured Go Tools\" output.\n\n### Code Health\n- Updated to mocha@9.2.0 (CVE-2021-23566).\n- Deflaked debug tests.\n- Changed to check `go.dev/dl` instead of `golang.org/dl` for Go release.\n- Improved documentation for the default formatting behavior  and template support.\n\n### Thanks\n@jamalc @suzmue @pavlelee @dekimsey @hyangah\n\n## v0.31.1\n\nDate: 8 Feb, 2022\n\nA list of all issues and changes can be found in the [v0.31.1 milestone](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/milestone/44) and [commit history](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.31.0...v0.31.1).\n\n### Fixes\n- Fixed the profile functionality broken by VSCode 1.63 ([Issue 2048](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2048))\n- Include fuzz tests in test explorer UI ([Issue 2023](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2023))\n\n## v0.31.0\n\nDate: 26 Jan, 2022\n\nA list of all issues and changes can be found in the [v0.31.0 milestone](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/milestone/41) and [commit history](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.30.0...v0.31.0).\n\n### Fixes\n\n- src/goStatus: assign id/name to each status bar item ([Issue 1571](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1571)) <!-- CL 370354 -->\n- Change go template file language id to `gotmpl` ([Issue 1957](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1957)) <!-- CL 376037 -->\n\n### Debugging\n\n- Use 'dlv' instead of 'dlv-dap' binary ([Issue 1977](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1977)) <!-- CL 374594 -->\n- Experimental support of 'console' mode debugging ([Issue 124](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/124)) <!-- CL 358618 -->\n- Support debugging with root privileges ([Issue 558](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/558))\n- Updated [debugging documentation]() ([Issue 1861](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1861),[1719](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1719),([1676](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1676), [123](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/123), [855](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/855), [1840](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1840)))\n- Enabled remaining tests for dlv dap and fixed flaky tests ([Issue 1958](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1958),[Issue 1993](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1993))\n- Improvement of debug session start-up and session fail messages ([Issue 1861](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1861)) <!-- CL 371974 -->\n\n### Test Explorer\n\n- src/goTest: don't resolve tests in virtual files <!-- CL 373234 -->\n- src/goTest: fix output for subtests ([Issue 1837](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1837)) <!-- CL 373274 -->\n\n### Development Process Updates\n\n- Recommend that contributers use npm ci instead of npm install when developing vscode-go ([Issue 2010](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2010)) <!-- CL 379154 -->\n- test: use @vscode/test-electron instead of vscode-test <!-- CL 377336 -->\n- go.mod: update imports to latest versions <!-- CL 374280 -->\n- package.json: pin direct dependencies ([Issue 2010](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/2010)) <!-- CL 379155 -->\n- Enable tests with go1.18beta1 ([Issue 1950](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/1950)) <!-- CL 374055 -->\n\n### Thanks\n\nThank you for your contribution, @firelizzard18, @hyangah, @jamalc, @polinasok, @TheNagaPraneeth, @suzmue!\n\n## v0.30.0\n\nDate: 16 Dec, 2021\n\nA list of all issues and changes can be found in the [v0.30.0 milestone](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/milestone/40) and [commit history](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/compare/v0.29.0...v0.30.0).\n\n### Changes\n\n- Debugging\n  - `dlv-dap` is pinned at [`@2f136727`](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/commit/2f13672765fead22e5376fb4754c48a96c33cc0b).\n  - Remote debugging support using `dlv-dap` is available.<br>Please follow [the instruction](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/debugging.md#remote-debugging) to enable remote debugging using `dlv-dap`.

This was added to [`go.delveConfig`](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/settings.md#godelveconfig), too. We plan to hide system goroutines by default in the next release, and it is already enabled in Nightly. Feedback is welcome!\n\t- `backend` accepts [`\"rr\"`](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/blob/master/Documentation/usage/dlv_backend.md).

The `documentLink` feature is replaced with `gopls`'s [`ui.navigation.importShortcut`](https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/doc/settings.md#importshortcut-enum) setting. The `diagnostics` feature replacement is still under discussion. Please provide feedback in [Issue 50](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/50).\n\n### Code Health\n* Experimental features that were available only in the nightly extension are enabled in the master branch, and in presubmit & CI tests running on the master branch.\n### Thanks\n\nThank you for your contribution, @hyangah, @suzmue, @pjweinbgo, @stamblerre!\n\n## v0.20.2\n\nDate: 8th Jan, 2021\n\n### Enhancement\n- Updated [`\"gopls\"` settings](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/705272cba4001b8caf71a1542f376daa2e0be089/docs/settings.md#gopls-1) to match gopls v0.6.2.

831](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/831)).\n\n### Thanks\nThank you for your contributions, @suzmue, @pjweinbgo!\n\n## v0.18.0\n\nDate: 23rd Oct, 2020\n\nUnified Go status UI ⚡, many debugger feature improvements, and LSP 3.16 features! A list of all issues fixed with this release can be found in the [v0.18.0 milestone](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/milestone/11?closed=1).\n\n### New Features\n- The new Go status bar provides a menu to manage the go version, open the gopls trace, open the `go.mod` file, and more. The old `Go Modules` status bar was removed in favor of this new unified status bar. See [VS Code Go UI documentation](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/ui.md) to learn more about this.\n- New `Go: Toggle gc details` command toggles the display of compiler optimization choice for the open Go source file ([CL 256658](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/256658)).\n- Upgraded LSP to [`3.16`](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-3-16/#whatIsNew). Users of recent `gopls` can access new features such as [`Call hierarchy`](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_33#_call-hierarchy) and [`Semantic tokens`](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/semantic-highlight-guide#semantic-token-provider).\n\n### Enhancement\n\n- Debugging:\n  * Correctly presents the reason when the debugged program stops due to `panic` and `fatal error` ([Issue 648](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/649)).\n  * Be explicit about conditional breakpoint support ([Issue 781](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/781)).\n  * Debug Adapter logs all the environment variables passed to dlv when verbose logging is enabled.\n- Language Server Client: sends `gopls` config as LSP initialization options for correct workspace symbols computation ([CL 259138](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/259138)).\n- Snippets: adds a placeholder for the `for` statement snippet ([Issue 734](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/734)).\n- Excludes `vendor` directories from `go.inferGopath` disable mechanism ([Issue 301](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/301)).\n- New `go.logging.level` setting allows extra logging to help debugging extension issues ([CL 256557](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/256557)).\n- For Nightly extension users, `Go: Show Survey Config` and `Go: Reset Survey Config` commands are available.\n\n### Fixes\n- Fixed the bug that caused the debug adapter to leave bogus null items in the map type variable presentation ([Issue 199](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/199)).\n- Fixed several debug adapter bugs that caused remote debug to hang ([Issue 740](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/740), [766](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/766), [761](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/761), [764](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/764)).\n- Restored the correct handling of language server configuration change when users opt for enabling language server and installing `gopls`. ([CL 258997](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/258997)).\n- Fixed a diagnostics error visualization issue when multiple files with errors are open ([Issue 743](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/743)).\n- Changed the dependency tool installation to use the `go` command chosen from the current `GOROOT/bin`. This helps avoid using a different version of `go` command for `asdf` or `direnv` users ([Issue 757](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/757)).\n\n### Documentation\n- Documented the current limitation of symlink support in debugging ([CL 257204](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/257204)), improved the instruction for CLI application debugging ([CL 259677](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/259677)), and fixed syntax errors in example task configuration snippets ([CL 259077](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/259077)).\n\n### Code Health\n- Added an initial set of tests for debug adapters ([Issue 137](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/137)). We will keep working to improve our test coverage.\n\n### Thanks\n\nThank you for your contributions, @suzmue, @vologab, @amitlevy21, @danielhelfand, @egonk, @quoctruong, @polinasok, @pjweinbgo, @stamblerre, @hyangah!\n\n## v0.17.2\n\nDate: 29th Sep, 2020\n\n### Fixes\n- Fixed a regression caused by the change for ([Issue 679](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/679)).\nIf `go` is not found from `PATH` available to the extension, the extension tries a couple of well-known\ndefault locations to find the `go` binary. In this case, we need to mutate `PATH` so other tools including\n`gopls` or `dlv` can choose the same go version. ([Issue 713](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/713)).\n\n## v0.17.1\n\nDate: 28th Sep, 2020\n\n### Enhancement\n- Mutate the `PATH`/`Path` environment variable only if users\nexplicitly configure to select the go command using `go.goroot`,\n`go.alternateTools`, or `Go: Choose Go Environment` menu.\n([Issue 679](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/679))\n- Includes sanitized gopls crash traces in the automated gopls crash report.\n([CL 256878](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/256878))\n\n### Fixes\n- Changed the default of `go.coverMode` to be `default`. ([Issue 666](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/666))\n- Fixed a missing promise reject when go is not found. ([Issue 660](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/660))\n\nThank you for reporting issues!\n\n## v0.17.0\n\nDate: 18th Sep, 2020\n\nGo code debugging and code coverage support is getting better.\n\nThe extension will help you stay updated with the new Go releases.\n\n### New Features\n\n- Delve's [call](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/tree/master/Documentation/cli#call) feature is now accessible.\nTo use this feature, explicitly specify the `call` command. E.g. `call myAwesomeFunc()`.\nIt is an experimental feature in Delve.\nPlease see [the current limitations](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/tree/master/Documentation/cli#call).\n([Issue 100](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/100))\n- The extension checks the go official download site and notifies users of\nnewly available Go versions. When a newer version is available,\n`Go Update Available` status bar item will appear.\nThis feature is available only if `go.useGoProxyToCheckForToolUpdates`\nis set true. ([Issue 483](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/483))\n- The new `go.coverMode` setting allows to use different coverage modes\n(`atomic`, `count`, `set (default)`). `go.coverShowCounts`,\n`go.coverageDecorator.{coveredBorderColor, uncoveredBorderColor}`\nwere newly added. We are still investigating better ways to\nvisualize the `count` coverage data; feedback and contribution is welcome!\n(Issue [256](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/256),\n[594](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/594))\n\n### Enhancement\n\n- Expands `'~'` in the `cwd` attribute of the launch configuration.\n([Issue 116](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/116))\n- Debug config's `showGlobalVariables` is disabled by default, and\nthis change improves speed. You can still inspect the global\nvariables by registering them in the `WATCH` section, or by\nconfiguring `showGlobalVariables` in `launch.json`.\n([Issue 138](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/138))\n- `gofumpt`, `gofumports` is added to recognized formatters list.\n([Issue 587](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/587))\n- Automatically restarts the language server if `go.toolsEnvVars` configuration is changed.\n([CL 254370](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/254370))\n- Reports `go env` failures.\n([Issue 555](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/555))\n\n### Fixes\n- Fixed to use absolute file paths in error messages appearing in the DEBUG OUTPUT.\nThis allows VS Code to locate the correct files.\n([Issue 456](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/456))\n- Fixed handling of absolute file paths in coverage profile, on windows.\n([Issue 553](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/553))\n- Changed to pass `GOROOT` when invoking the `gopkgs` tool so `gopkgs`\ncontinues to work with different go versions without being recompiled.\n([CL 254137]( https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/254137))\n- Fixed to provide explicit directory for running go list and go version.\n([Issue 610](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/610),\nCL [253600]( https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/253600),\n[253602]( https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/253602))\n- Fixed to trigger extension activation when commands for diagnostics,\nsuch as `Go: Locate Configured Go Tools` are invoked.\n([Issue 457](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/457))\n- Fixed to prepend `GOROOT/bin` to integrated terminal's PATH\nenvironment variable when `go.goroot` is set on OS X.\n([Issue 544](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/544))\n- Fixed to correctly apply environment variables setting read from `envFile`\nin the launch configuration. We reworked how the environment variables\nconfiguration is processed during this cycle. Now the extension processes\nthe `envFile` attribute instead of asking the debug adapter process to\nread the specified `envFile`.\n([Issue 452](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/452))\n- Disabled `go.installDependenciesWhenBuilding` by default. When this is\nenabled, the extension runs `go` commands with `-i`, which is no longer\nrecommended with recent versions of Go.\n([Issue 568](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/568))\n- Fixed a bug where we are not sending back 'configuration done' response.\n([Issue eclipse-theia/theia#8455](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/issues/8455),\n[CL 254959](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/254959))\n\n### Documentation\n\n- Added new documentation about\n[switching go versions](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/go-version.md),\nand settings for [standard library development](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/blob/master/docs/stdlib.md).\n- Improved debugging instruction and contribution guide. Enhanced automated settings documentation generation.\n\n### Code Health\n\n- Removed the obsolete string-type coverageDecorator support.\n([Issue 519](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/519))\n- When gopls integration tests fail, tests print the observed gopls traces\nto help debugging.\n\n### Experimental Features\n\n- We plan to delegate computation of various `run test` CodeLenses to `gopls`.\nThis experimental feature can be enabled with the following setting:\n```\n\"go.useLanguageServer\": true,\n\"gopls\": {\n\t\"codelens\": { \"test\": true }\n}\n```\n\n### Thanks\n\nThank you for your contribution, @suzmue, @pjweinbgo, @ekulabuhov, @stamblerre, @tpbg, @FiloSottile, @findleyr, @quoctruong, @polinasok, @hyangah!\n\n## v0.16.2\n\nDate: 2nd Sep, 2020\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed the compile error message parsing bug that prevented correct file name expansion in test output. ([Issue 522](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/522)).\n- Fixed the regression that caused to run tests in the local directory mode and\n  result in more verbose output than the package list mode. ([Issue 528](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/528)).\n- Fixed `\"go.alternateTools\"` settings to accept any tool names without\n  settings.json diagnostics warning. ([Issue 526](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/526))\n\n\n## v0.16.1\n\nDate: 5th Aug, 2020\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed the bug that made test output verbose by default ([Issue 471](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/469)).\n- Fixed the extension host crash bug due to a process-wide uncaught exception handler accidentally installed along with the inlined debug adapter. This crash bug also caused connection drops when used with the VS Code Remote extension ([Issue 467](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/467), [469](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/469)).\n- Readded the predefined variable resolution support for `go.goroot` and `go.toolsEnvVars` ([Issue 464](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/464), [413](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/413)).\n\n## v0.16.0\n\nDate: 3rd Aug, 2020\n\nThis version requires VS Code 1.46+.\n\nOlder versions of VS Code will not receive updates any more.\n\n### New Features\n\n- Users can select/install a different version of Go with `Go: Choose Go Environment` command.\nWhen clicking the `Go` status bar that displays the currently active Go version, users will be\nprompted with the list of Go versions installed locally or available for download.\nThis feature was built based on the [`golang.org/dl`](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/dl?tab=overview)\ntools.\nThe selected Go version applies to the workspace, takes precedence over the\nsystem default or the `\"go.goroot\"` and `\"go.alternateTools\"` settings, and persists\nacross sessions. You can clear the choice by selecting the `Clear Selection` item.\n([Issue 253](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/253))\n- When the Go version changes, the extension prepends `$GOROOT/bin` to the `PATH` or `Path`\nenvironment variable which then applies the change to the integrated terminal windows.\n- This version includes an experimental version of the new Debug Adapter that uses Delve's\nnative DAP implementation. It currently supports `launch` type requests in `debug` or `test`\nmode. This is still in the early stages and requires\n[`dlv`](https://github.com/go-delve/delve) built from its unreleased, master\nbranch. Subscribe to\n[golang/vscode-go#23](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/23) for updates.\n\n### Enhancement\n\n- Bundles the extension using webpack, which reduced the extension size\n(4.7MB -> 1MB) and the extension loading overhead (3.4K files -> 3 files)\n([Issue 53](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/53)).\n- `Go: Apply Cover Profile` applies code coverage for multiple packages\n([CL 238697](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/238697)).\nWe fixed bugs in processing coverage profiles on Windows.\n- Suggests the official Go download page when no `go` tool is found.\n- Utilizes the `GOMODCACHE` environment variable, introduced in\n[Go 1.15](https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.15#go-command).\n- Prevents multiple debug sessions from launching\n([Issue 109](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/109)).\n- Streams test output when tests run with the `-v` option.\nThis feature requires 1.14 or newer versions of Go\n([Issue 316](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/316)).\n- Sets `additionalProperties` to `false` for the settings that don't expect\nmore properties. This allows VS Code to handle these settings better in\nits new settings GUI ([Issue 284](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/pull/284)).\n- `Go: Locate Configured Go Tools` includes `go env` results\n([Issue 195](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/195)).\n- Avoids prompting users to switch the default format tool in modules mode\nif users enable the language server.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed the `PATH` environment variable adjustment when users use a wrapper as an alternate\ntool for `go` ([CL 239697](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/vscode-go/+/239697)).\n- Fixed a bug in test output processing, which prevented VS code from linking test log messages with locations in the source file.\n- Fixed a `gocode-gomod` installation bug when `GOPATH` includes multiple directories\n([Issue 368](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/368)).\n- Avoids attempting to kill already terminated processes ([Issue 334](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/334)).\n- Fixed `godef` to locate standard packages correctly by passing the `GOROOT` environment variable.\n- Fixed a `golangci-lint` integration bug that prevented displaying the lint results correctly when\nlinters like `nolintlint` are enabled ([Issue 411](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/411)).\n- Fixed lost test function name arguments when running `Go: Test Previous`\n([Issue 269](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/269)).\n\n### Code Health\n\n- Many enhancements to improve test reliability and test coverage were made during this dev cycle.\n- TryBot is enabled, and the test results are posted to Gerrit CL. Currently, only the internal team members\ncan see the details of the test results, but we will continue working to make them public.\n- Windows tests are now fixed and enabled in GitHub Action-based CI.\n- Refactored code shared by the extension and the debug adapters to prevent accidental debug adapter breakages.\n- Updated `json-rpc2` and `lodash` to address vulnerability reports from `npm audit`.\n\n### Thanks\n\nThank you for your contribution, fujimoto kyosuke, OneOfOne, Aditya Thakral, Oleg Butuzov, Rebecca Stambler, Peter Weinberger, Brayden Cloud, Eli Bendersky, Robert Findley, Hana Kim!\n\n## v0.15.2\n\nDate: 21st July, 2020\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Do not fail tools installation when gocode is not already running ([Issue 355](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/355)).\n\n## v0.15.1\n\nDate: 7th July, 2020\n\n### Enhancement\n\n- Improved `gopls` error report suggestion and changed to send reports to the vscode-go issue tracker instead of the go issue tracker ([cl/240506](https://golang.org/cl/240506)).\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Removed the `preview` note in the published extension ([Issue 273](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/273)).\n\n## v0.15.0\n\nDate: 29th June, 2020\n\n### New Features\n\n- The new command `Go: Subtest At Cursor` runs an individual subtest if the subtest's name is a simple string ([cl/235447](https://golang.org/cl/235447)).\n- The new setting `go.trace.server` controls tracing between VS Code and the language server ([cl/232458](https://golang.org/cl/232458)). Unlike tracing using `gopls` [flags](https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/doc/troubleshooting.md#vs-code), this controls client-side tracing, and does not require to restart the server to change the value. This client-side trace is presented in the `gopls` output channel. The server-side trace has been moved to the new `gopls (server)` output channel ([cl/233598](https://golang.org/cl/233598)).\n- There is now a new Go version status bar item. Clicking it currently only pops up the current `GOROOT`. We plan to add Go version switch, and other features using this status bar item.\n\n### Enhancement\n\n- `Go: Add Tags To Struct Fields` prompts transform parameter input if the setting `go.addTags.promptForTags` is true ([Issue 2546](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-go/issues/2546)).\n- `Go: Locate Go Tools` command output includes the `GOBIN` value. ([cl/235197](https://golang.org/cl/235197)).\n- Improved debugging experience\n    - The debug adapter automatically infers the mapping between remote and local paths for easy remote debugging ([cl/234020](https://golang.org/cl/234020), [Issue 45](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/45)).\n    - The debug adapter handles errors that can occur during remote connection setup ([cl/237550](https://golang.org/cl/237550), [Issue 215](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/215)).\n    - Failed watch expression evaluation no longer pops up error message windows. The error is visible in the watch window instead ([cl/236999](https://golang.org/cl/236999), [Issue 143](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/143)).\n- Better language server integration\n    - Restart the language server automatically when changes in its configuration or the language server version are detected ([cl/232598](https://golang.org/cl/232598), [cl/233159](https://golang.org/cl/233159)).\n    - Prompts user to file an issue if `gopls` crashes ([cl/233325](https://golang.org/cl/233325)).\n- `go.gopath`, `go.goroot`, `go.toolsGopath` are now [machine-overridable](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/contribution-points#Configuration-property-schema) ([cl/236539](https://golang.org/cl/236539), [Issue 2981](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-go/issues/2981)).\n- The extension does not mutate the `GOROOT` environment variable any more. `go.goroot` is used to select the `go` command under the specified directory ([Issue 146](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/146)).\n- A redundant code action provider was removed when using the language server ([cl/239284](https://golang.org/cl/239284)).\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed `gopls` version detection and upgrade logic when pre-release versions are involved ([cl/235524](https://golang.org/cl/235524)).\n- Processes started with `Run > Run Without Debugging (^F5)` are now cleaned up when the run sessions end ([cl/236879](https://golang.org/cl/236879)).\n- When `go.alternateTools.go` is set, the path to `$(go env GOROOT)/bin` is passed to underlying tools to ensure they use the same `go` version ([cl/239697](https://golang.org/cl/239697)).\n- Now the extension avoids invoking buggy `pgrep` on mac OS ([cl/236538](https://golang.org/cl/236538), [Issue 90](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/90)).\n\n### Code Health\n\n- More test coverage\n    - Added new tests for gopls update logic ([cl/233158](https://golang.org/cl/233158)), tools installation behavior ([cl/233557](https://golang.org/cl/233557)).\n    - Fixed Build Tags checking tests ([cl/233517](https://golang.org/cl/233517)).\n- Upgraded dependencies including websocket-extensions from 0.1.3 to 0.1.4 ([cl/228617](https://golang.org/cl/228617), [cl/236839](https://golang.org/cl/236839), [pr/3261](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-go/pull/3261)).\n\n### Thanks\n\nThank you for your contribution, Brayden Cloud, Bulent Rahim Kazanci, Eli Bendersky, Hana Kim, Polina Sokolova, Quoc Truong, Rebecca Stambler, Rohan Talip, Ryan Koski, Sean Caffery, Ted Silbernagel, Vincent Jo, and codekid!\n\n## 0.14.4\n\nDate: 8th June, 2020\n\nThis is the first version published with `golang` publisher ID.

[PR 762](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/762)\n\n### Debugging improvements\n* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)\n    * Debug current file without a launch configuration file. Simply press `F5` to start the debug session.\n    A `launch.json` is still required to debug tests or for advanced debug configurations. [PR 769](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/769)\n    * Launch configuration snippets are now available for common scenarios like debugging file/package or debugging a test package/function.\n    These snippets can be used through IntelliSense when editing the `launch.json` file. [PR 794](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/794)\n    * Fix for [Bug 492](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/492).

When debugging against a remote machine, paths anywhere under the GOPATH will be correctly mapped so you can set breakpoints in them.\n    Previously only paths next to the program could be debugged. [PR 742](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/742)\n\n### Testing improvements\n* [Oleg Bulatov (@dmage)](https://github.com/dmage)\n    * Added new setting `go.testOnSave`. When `true`, all tests in the current package will be run on saving a Go file.\n    The status of the tests will be shown in the status bar at the bottom of the VS Code window. It is not advised to have this on when you have Auto Save enabled. [PR 810](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/810)\n* [Jeff Willette (@deltaskelta)](https://github.com/deltaskelta)\n    * Test output is no longer verbose by default.

[PR 351](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/351) and [PR 737](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/737).\n        * This is useful when you work on different GOPATHs.\n        * Remember to run `Go: Install Tools` command to install the tools to the new location.\n* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)\n    * All the \"Install tool\" options (the pop ups you see) and the `Go: Install Tools` command now support `gometalinter` if it is your chosen linting tool. [PR 735](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/735).\n        * Since `gometalinter` internally installs linters and expects them to be in the user's GOPATH, `gometalinter` will get installed to your GOPATH and not the alternate location specified in `go.toolsGopath`\n\n### Build improvements\n* [Matt Aimonetti (@mattetti)](https://github.com/mattetti)\n    * While building, we now use the `-i` flag (for non main packages) which installs dependent packages, which in turn get used in subsequent builds resulting in faster builds in bigger workspaces. [PR 718](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/718)\n* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)\n    * Build errors with no line numbers (for eg. Import cycle) are now displayed in the output window and will be mapped to the first line of the file. [PR 740](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/740)\n\n### Test improvements\n* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)\n    * A new setting `go.testFlags` that can be used to run tests. If null, `go.buildFlags` will be used. [PR 482](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/482)\n    * Customize flags for each of the test command by using different keybindings. [PR 482](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/482). In the below example, `ctrl+shift+t` is bound to run the tests in current file with `-short` flag. The commands here can be `go.test.package`, `go.test.file` or `go.test.cursor`.\n\n        ```json\n        {\n            \"key\": \"ctrl+shift+t\",\n            \"command\": \"go.test.file\",\n            \"args\": {\n                \"flags\": [\"-short\"]\n            },\n            \"when\": \"editorTextFocus\"\n        }\n        ```\n    * New toggle command `Go: Toggle Test File` that lets you toggle between your Go file and the corresponding test file. Previous commands `Go: Open Test File` and `Go: Open Implementation For Test File` have been deprecated in favor of this new command. [PR 739](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/739). You can add a keyboard binding to this as below:\n\n        ```json\n        {\n            \"key\": \"ctrl+shift+t\",\n            \"command\": \"go.toggle.test.file\",\n            \"when\": \"editorTextFocus && editorLangId == 'go'\"\n        }\n        ```\n    * If current file is not a test file, show error message while running test commands, instead of displaying success message. Fixes [#303](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/303)\n* [Marcel Voigt (@nochso)](https://github.com/nochso)\n   * Show error message in output window when running test coverage fails. [PR 721](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/721)\n\n### Debugging improvements\n* [Andreas Kuhn (@ankon)](https://github.com/ankon)\n   * Honor the `cwd` launch configuration argument. [PR 714](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/714)\n* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)\n   * GOPATH set in the `env` property in `launch.json` will also be used to find `dlv` tool. [PR 725](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/725).\n* [Rob Lourens (@roblourens)](https://github.com/roblourens)\n   * New property `trace` in `launch.json` to provide option to have verbose logging while debugging using vscode-debug-logger.

Install [Go](https://go.dev) 1.21 or newer if you haven't already.\n\n1.  Install the [VS Code Go extension].\n\n1.  Open any Go file or go.mod file to automatically activate the extension. The\n    [Go status bar](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/ui) appears in the\n    bottom right corner of the window and displays your Go version.\n\n1.  The extension depends on `go`, `gopls` (the Go language server), and optional\n    tools depending on your settings. If `gopls` is missing, the extension will\n    try to install it. The :zap: sign next to the Go version indicates\n    the language server is running, and you are ready to go.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"docs/images/gettingstarted.gif\" width=75%>\n<br/>\n<em>(Install Missing Tools)</em>\n</p>\n\nYou are ready to Go :-) &nbsp;&nbsp; 🎉🎉🎉\n\n## What's next\n\n* Explore more [features][full feature breakdown] of the VS Code Go extension.\n* View the\n  [settings documentation](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/settings)\n\tand [advanced topics](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/advanced) to\n\tcustomize the extension.\n* View the [tools documentation](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/tools)\n  for a complete list of tools the VS Code Go extension depends on. You can\n  install additional tools and update them by using \"Go: Install/Update Tools\".\n* Solve issues with the\n  [general troubleshooting](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/troubleshooting)\n\tand [debugging troubleshooting](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/debugging#troubleshooting)\n\tguides.\n* [file an issue](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/new/choose) for\n  problems with the extension.\n* Start a [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/discussions)\n  or get help on [Stack Overflow].\n* Explore Go language resources on [go.dev/learn](https://go.dev/learn) and\n  [golang.org/help](https://golang.org/help).\n\nIf you are new to Go, [this article](https://golang.org/doc/code.html) provides\nthe overview on Go code organization and basic `go` commands. Watch [\"Getting\nstarted with VS Code Go\"] for an explanation of how to build your first Go\napplication using VS Code Go.\n\n## Feature highlights\n\n* [IntelliSense] - Results appear for symbols as you type.\n* [Code navigation] - Jump to or peek at a symbol's declaration.\n* [Code editing] - Support for saved snippets, formatting and code organization,\n  and automatic organization of imports.\n* [Diagnostics] -  Build, vet, and lint errors shown as you type or on save.\n* Enhanced support for [testing] and [debugging]\n\nSee the [full feature breakdown] for more details.\n\n<p align=center>\n<img src=\"docs/images/completion-signature-help.gif\" width=75%>\n<br/>\n<em>(Code completion and Signature Help)</em>\n</p>\n\nIn addition to integrated editing features, the extension provides several\ncommands for working with Go files. You can access any of these by opening the\nCommand Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Linux/Windows and `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac), and\nthen typing in the command name. See the\n[full list of commands](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/commands#detailed-list) provided by this\nextension.\n\n<p align=center>\n<img src=\"docs/images/toggletestfile.gif\" width=75%>\n<br/><em>(Toggle Test File)</em></p>\n\n**⚠️ Note**: the default syntax highlighting for Go files is provided by a\n[TextMate rule](https://github.com/worlpaker/go-syntax) embedded in VS\nCode, not by this extension.\n\nFor better syntax highlighting, we recommend enabling\n[semantic highlighting](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/semantic-highlight-guide)\nby turning on [Gopls' `ui.semanticTokens` setting](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/settings#uisemantictokens).\n    ```\n    \"gopls\": { \"ui.semanticTokens\": true }\n    ```\n\n## Setting up your workspace\n\nThe VS Code Go extension supports both `GOPATH` and Go modules modes.\n\n[Go modules](https://golang.org/ref/mod) are used to manage dependencies in\nrecent versions of Go. Modules replace the `GOPATH`-based approach to specifying\nwhich source files are used in a given build, and they are the default build\nmode in go1.16+. We highly recommend Go development in module mode. If you are\nworking on existing projects, please consider migrating to modules.\n\nUnlike the traditional `GOPATH` mode, module mode does not require the workspace\nto be located under `GOPATH` nor to use a specific structure. A module is\ndefined by a directory tree of Go source files with a `go.mod` file in the\ntree's root directory.\n\nYour project may involve one or more modules. If you are working with multiple\nmodules or uncommon project layouts, you will need to configure your workspace\nby using [Workspace Folders]. See the\n[Supported workspace layouts documentation] for more information.\n\n## Pre-release version\n\nIf you'd like to get early access to new features and bug fixes, you can use the\npre-release extension. Following the vscode's [convention](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#prerelease-extensions),\nwe use the minor version of the extension version number to distinguish stable\nand pre-release versions (`0.ODD_NUMBER.patch` for pre-release, `0.EVEN_NUMBER.patch`\nfor stable release).\n\nTo install the pre-release version, use the drop-down list\nto select \"Install Pre-Release Version\", or if already installed the Go extension,\nuse the \"Switch to Pre-Release Version\" option in the Visual Studio Code\nextension management page. For more details about this mechanism, see the\n[Visual Studio Code's documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_63#_pre-release-extensions).\n\n## Telemetry\n\nVS Code Go extension relies on the [Go Telemetry](https://go.dev/doc/telemetry) to\nlearn insights about the performance and stability of the extension and the\nlanguage server (`gopls`).\n**Go Telemetry data uploading is disabled by default** and can be enabled\nwith the following command:\n\n```\ngo run golang.org/x/telemetry/cmd/gotelemetry@latest on\n```\n\nAfter telemetry is enabled, the language server will upload metrics and stack\ntraces to [telemetry.go.dev](https://telemetry.go.dev). You can inspect what\ndata is collected and can be uploaded by running:\n\n```\ngo run golang.org/x/telemetry/cmd/gotelemetry@latest view\n```\n\nIf we get enough adoption, this data can significantly advance the pace of\nthe Go extension development, and help us meet a higher standard\nof reliability. For example:\n\n- Even with [semi-automated crash\n  reports](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AautomatedReport)\n  in VS Code, we've seen several crashers go unreported for weeks or months.\n- Even with [a suite of\n  benchmarks](https://perf.golang.org/dashboard/?benchmark=all&repository=tools&branch=release-branch.go1.20),\n  some performance regressions don't show up in our benchmark environment (such\n  as the [completion bug](https://go.dev/issue/62665) mentioned below!).\n- Even with [lots of great\n  ideas](https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Agopls+label%3Afeaturerequest)\n  for how to improve gopls, we have limited resources. Telemetry can help us\n  identify which new features are most important, and which existing features\n  aren't being used or aren't working well.\n\nThese are just a few ways that telemetry can improve gopls. The [telemetry blog\npost series](https://research.swtch.com/telemetry-uses) contains many more.\n\nGo telemetry is designed to be transparent and privacy-preserving. Learn more at\n[https://go.dev/doc/telemetry](https://go.dev/doc/telemetry).\n\n## Support Policy\n\nThe Go extension is maintained by engineers on the\n[Go tools team](https://github.com/orgs/golang/teams/tools-team/members),\nwho actively monitor the [VS Code Go](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues)\nand the [Go](https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Agopls)\nissue trackers.\n\nWe support only the latest stable and pre-release versions of the extension.\n\n### Supported Go and tools\n\nThe Go extension follows the [Go Release Policy](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release.html#policy),\nmeaning that it _officially_ supports the two most recent major Go releases.\nThe Go team maintains _best-effort_ support for the last three major Go versions.\n\nThe Go extension relies on [tools](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/tools)\nlike `gopls` and `dlv` for its core functionalities and they have their own release\npolicy and schedule. We test only against the latest versions of these tools.\n\nIn case you need to work with an older version of Go, please check\nthe [Compatibility] page and manually install the compatible version of\nthe extension and tools.\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome your contributions and thank you for working to improve the Go\ndevelopment experience in VS Code. If you would like to help work on the VS Code\nGo extension, see our\n[contribution guide](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/wiki/contributing) to\nlearn how to build and run the VS Code Go extension locally and contribute to\nthe project.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nThis project follows the\n[Go Community Code of Conduct](https://golang.org/conduct).
