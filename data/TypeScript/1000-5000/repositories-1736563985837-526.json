          "content": "# How to contribute \n\nFirst off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!\n\nIt is truly appreciated 😊\n\nPlease note we have a [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Follow it in all your interactions with the project.\n\n- [How to contribute](#how-to-contribute)\n  - [General Guidelines](#general-guidelines)\n  - [Project structure](#project-structure)\n    - [`src/`](#src)\n    - [`tests/`](#tests)\n    - [`demo/`](#demo)\n  - [Developing](#developing)\n    - [Pre-requisites](#pre-requisites)\n    - [Install](#install)\n    - [Starting the demo page](#starting-the-demo-page)\n    - [Running tests](#running-tests)\n  - [Writing tests](#writing-tests)\n  - [License](#license)\n\n## General Guidelines\n\n- Before creating a new PR, please discuss the change via an issue\n- If adding a new feature, write the corresponding tests\n- Ensure that nothing is broken. You can use the demo page for that\n- If applicable, update the documentation\n- When solving a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce it. Codesandbox is your best friend for that\n\n\n## Project structure\n\nThis project has 6 main folders:\n\n- `build/`: Production Rollup build configuration\n- `examples/`: Example projects\n- `demo/`: Demo page's code\n- `src/`: Vue Toastification's code\n- `tests/`: All of the tests\n\nThe main folders you'll probably be working with will be `src/`, `tests/` and `demo/`.\n\n### `src/`\nThese are all the files used by the plugin. Its folders and files are separated by type:\n\n- `components/`: Plugin's Vue components. These are the Toast itself, close button, icon, progress bar, etc\n- `scss/`: All of the plugin's styling files are here\n- `ts/`: Typescript files containing constants and other helper methods used across the components\n- `types/`: Main typescript types and interfaces\n- `index.ts`: Plugin entry point\n\n### `tests/`\nInside the `tests/` folder you'll find some test utilities under `utils/` and the unit tests under `unit/`. All of the tests are separated by the files they are testing, under the same folder structure as in `src/`.\n\nWe use [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) and [Vue Test Utils](https://vue-test-utils.vuejs.org/) for testing.\n\nIf you've never written tests for Vue, you may find this [guide](https://lmiller1990.github.io/vue-testing-handbook/) helpful. You may also check out our [testing guide](#writing-tests) to learn how to write effective tests for this plugin.\n\n\n### `demo/`\nThis folder contains the code for the demo.\n\n## Developing\n\nDeveloping a plugin is a little different than developing a website for there is no direct way to try it out. Because of that, the best way to test your changes when developing is by starting up the demo page locally.\n\n### Pre-requisites\n\n- *Node 10 or superior*\n- *Yarn*\n\n### Install\n\nClone the repository and create a local branch:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/Maronato/vue-toastification.git\ncd vue-toastification\n\ngit checkout -b my-branch\n```\n\nInstall dependencies:\n\n```sh\nyarn install\n```\n\n### Starting the demo page\n\nTo start the demo page, run\n```sh\nyarn dev\n```\nYou can now play with it on [`localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080) and see your changes being hot reloaded.\n\n\n### Running tests\nTo run all tests:\n```sh\nyarn test\n```\nOr to watch for changes and only run tests related to changed files:\n```sh\nyarn test:watch\n```\n\nRemember that automated test coverage may not catch all of your feature's intricacies. Write thorough tests, not just tests that reach 100% codecov.\n\n\n## Writing tests\nIf your changes are related to anything **but** `VtToastContainer`, they may be treated as regular Vue components or Typescript code during tests.\n\nIf you make changes to the UI, it'll probably break some [snapshots](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/snapshot-testing). Make sure that all logic tests pass before overwriting snapshots.\n\nIf you plan on changing behavior related to `VtToastContainer` or plugin initialization, you'll face issues because of the way the plugin injects the container onto the page.\n\nTo solve that, the `loadPlugin` utility was created. You may import it from `tests/utils/plugin` and use it to simulate a `app.use(Toast)` call.\n\nEach of the position wrappers (`topLeft`, etc) also have a `getToasts` method that returns a [WrapperArray](https://vue-test-utils.vuejs.org/api/wrapper-array/) or its toasts.\n\nExample usage:\n```ts\nimport { ToastOptionsAndRequiredContent } from \"src/types\";\nimport { POSITION } from \"src/ts/constants\";\nimport loadPlugin from \"tests/utils/plugin\";\n\ndescribe(\"test plugin\", () => {\n  it(\"adds toast\", async () => {\n    // Load plugin with default value for position\n    const options = { position: POSITION.BOTTOM_LEFT };\n    const {\n      toastInterface,\n      bottomLeft,\n      containerWrapper\n    } = loadPlugin(options);\n\n    // Get way to access list of toasts inside containerWrapper\n    const vm = (containerWrapper.vm as unknown) as {\n      toastArray: ToastOptionsAndRequiredContent[]\n    }\n\n    // Initially there should be no toasts\n    expect(vm.toastArray.length).toBe(0);\n    expect(bottomLeft.getToasts().length).toBe(0);\n\n    // Create a toast\n    const content = \"I'm a toast\";\n    toastInterface(content);\n\n    // Wait for render\n    await containerWrapper.vm.$nextTick();\n\n    // Toast should be created with correct content\n    expect(vm.toastArray.length).toBe(1);\n    expect(bottomLeft.getToasts().length).toBe(1);\n    expect(bottomLeft.getToasts().at(0).props().content).toBe(content);\n  });\n});\n```\n\n## License\nBy contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its MIT License."

You can easily do that by setting the type of toast to be displayed.\n\n```javascript\ntoast(\"Default toast\");\ntoast.info(\"Info toast\");\ntoast.success(\"Success toast\");\ntoast.error(\"Error toast\");\ntoast.warning(\"Warning toast\");\n\n// You can also set the type programmatically when calling the default toast\nimport { TYPE } from \"vue-toastification\";\n\ntoast(\"Also a success toast\", {\n    type: TYPE.SUCCESS  // or \"success\", \"error\", \"default\", \"info\" and \"warning\"\n});\n```\n\nSetting the type only works when using `toast`, it won't work when registering the plugin with `app.use`.\n\n### Setting the toast timeout\n\nYou can set for how long the toast will remain on the screen (in milliseconds) using the `timeout` option or disable it altogether by setting it to `false`\n\n```js\n// 1 second\ntoast(\"Quick toast\", { timeout: 1000 });\n\n// Or make the toast permanent until manually closed\ntoast(\"Persistent toast\", { timeout: false })\n\n// Or set it when registering the plugin\napp.use(Toast, { timeout: 2000 });\n```\n\n### Using a custom component\nPassing strings as the toast content is not enough? You can render anything inside the toast using custom components! Vue Toastification accepts both Vue Components and JSX templates as parameters.\n\nWhen using custom components, the prop `toastId` containing the toast ID is always passed by default. Also, an event listener for `close-toast` is attached, so you can close the toast programmatically by emitting it from inside the component.\n\nSee an example with custom components in action:\n\n[![Edit Vue Template](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/vue-template-w2w2c?fontsize=14)\n\n#### Render a component\nTo use a Single File Component as content just pass it to the toast:\n\n```js\nimport MyComponent from \"./MyComponent.vue\";\n\n\ntoast(MyComponent);\n```\n\n#### Close the toast using a custom component\nWhen using custom components it is also possible to close the toast from within.\n\nTo do that, just emit the `close-toast` event\n\n```js\n// MyComponent.vue\n\n<template>\n    <button @click=\"$emit('close-toast')\">Close Toast</button>\n</template>\n\n\n// OtherFile.vue\nimport MyComponent from \"./MyComponent.vue\";\n\n\n// This toast will be closed when the button inside it is clicked\ntoast(MyComponent);\n```\n\n\n#### Render a JSX component\nSometimes you won't want to create a whole component just for a toast. In those cases, you can pass a JSX template to the Toast for it to render as a component\n\n> Note: Read [this](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/render-function.html#JSX) to learn how to enable JSX inside of Vue\n\n```js\nconst myJSX = (\n    <div>\n        <h1>My Title</h1>\n        <span>My text</span>\n    </div>\n);\n\n// Vue Toastification will generate the appropriate render function automatically.\ntoast(myJSX);\n```\n\n\n#### Render a component with props and events\n\nUsually, it is not enough to just render a simple component and you'll need to handle events or pass props. You can do that too!\n\nJust pass the content in the format\n\n```js\n{\n    component: Component,\n    props:  {\n        propName: propValue  // Optional\n    },\n    listeners: {\n        eventName: eventHandler  // Optional\n    }\n}\n```\n\nProps will be passed to the created component and the event listeners will be attached to it as well.\n\n> Note: Props passed are not reactive\n\n```js\nconst content = {\n    // Your component or JSX template\n    component: MyComponent,\n\n    // Props are just regular props, but these won't be reactive\n    props: {\n        myProp: \"abc\",\n        otherProp: 123\n    },\n\n    // Listeners will listen to and execute on event emission\n    listeners: {\n        click: () => console.log(\"Clicked!\"),\n        myEvent: myEventHandler\n    }\n};\n\n\ntoast(content);\n```\n\n#### Access global components and plugins inside toasts\nWhen building custom toast components, it may be useful to access the context of your main app to use stuff that is shared globally inside it. These include things like: \n- global components such as `RouterLink`, `NuxtLink`, etc\n- global state and properties\n- custom directives\n- custom mixins\n- data from other plugins\n\nTo give Vue Toastification access to your app's context, you can set `shareAppContext` to `true` during registration.\n```ts\napp.use(Toast, {\n    shareAppContext: true,\n});\n```\n\n### Dismiss toasts programmatically\nWhen a toast is created, an ID is assigned to it. You can use it later to programmatically dismiss the toast.\n\n\nYou can also choose a custom ID (String or Number) for the toast during its creation.\n\n\n```js\n// Get the toast ID on creation\nconst toastId = toast(\"my toast\");\n\n// Dismiss it later\ntoast.dismiss(toastId);\n\n// Pass your custom ID to the toast\ntoast(\"my other toast\", { id: \"my id\" });\ntoast.dismiss(\"my id\");\n```\n\n### Update toasts programmatically\nYou can update toasts contents and props programmatically using its ID.\n\nThe method signature is `$toast.update(id, { content, options }, create)` with `content`, `options` and `create` being optional. Updates override previous values.\n\n`create` is a boolean, `false` by default. If `true`, a toast will be created if no matching toast with the `id` is found.\n\n```js\n// Get the toast ID on creation\nconst toastId = toast(\"Loading...\");\n\n// Update it later\ntoast.update(toastId, { content: \"Loaded!\" });\n\n// Pass your custom ID to the toast\ntoast(\"my other toast\", { id: \"my id\", timeout: false });\ntoast.update(\"my id\", { content: \"Finished!\", options: { timeout: 5000 } });\n```\n\n> **Note**: The remaining timeout of the toast will be carried on updates. To reset the timeout, simply pass a `timeout` option during the update. It can be the same as the one set during the toast creation.\n\n\n### Clear all toasts\nYou can also dismiss all toasts at once using `clear`.\n\n```js\ntoast(\"my toast A\");\ntoast(\"my toast B\");\ntoast(\"my toast C\");\n\n// Dismiss all toasts\ntoast.clear();\n```\n\n### Styling\nThere are two ways to style your toast components. You can either add custom classes to the toast or containers and modify them using those or you can override the actual toast's SCSS when importing them.\n\n#### Custom toast classes\n```js\ntoast(\"my toast\", {\n    // For the actual toast, including different toast types:\n    toastClassName: \"my-custom-toast-class\",\n\n    // For the toast body when using strings or a custom component as content\n    bodyClassName: [\"custom-class-1\", \"custom-class-2\"]\n});\n```\n```css\n<style>\n/* When setting CSS, remember that priority increases with specificity, so don't forget to select the existing classes as well */\n\n    .Vue-Toastification__toast--default.my-custom-toast-class {\n        background-color: red;\n    }\n\n    /* Applied to the toast body when using regular strings as content */\n    .Vue-Toastification__toast-body.custom-class-1 {\n        font-size: 30px;\n    }\n\n    /* Applied to a wrapper div when using a custom component as content */\n    .Vue-Toastification__toast-component-body.custom-class-2 {\n        width: 100%;\n    }\n</style>\n```\nThese can also be defined when registering the vue plugin.\n\n> Note: `bodyClassName`s applied to toasts that use a custom component are not applied to the custom component itself. Instead, they are applied to a `div` that wraps the custom component.\n\n#### Custom toast container classes\nYou can also add custom classes to the toast's **containers**. Keep in mind that here **containers** refer to the 6 `div`s that contain the toasts in the 6 possible toast positions (`top-right`, `top-left`, etc).\n\nThese classes can be defined during plugin initialization.\n```js\napp.use(Toast, {\n    // Can be either a string or an array of strings\n    containerClassName: \"my-container-class\",\n});\n```\n```css\n<style>\n/* When setting CSS, remember that priority increases with specificity, so don't forget to select the existing classes as well */\n\n    /* This will only affect the top-right container */\n    .Vue-Toastification__container.top-right.my-container-class{\n        top: 10em;\n    }\n\n    /* This will affect all 6 containers */\n    .Vue-Toastification__container.my-container-class{\n        position: relative;\n    }\n</style>\n```\n\n\n#### Override SCSS variables\nThere is a set of [pre defined variables](https://github.com/Maronato/vue-toastification/blob/master/src/scss/_variables.scss) that you can override to change some basic styling.\n\nIf you have an SCSS loader in your project, simply create a file overriding the defaults\n```scss\n// yourMainScssFile.scss\n\n// Override the variables or import a file that overrides them\n$vt-color-success: white;\n$vt-text-color-success: #000;\n\n// Import the regular Vue Toastification stylesheets (or create your own)\n@import \"vue-toastification/src/scss/_variables\";\n@import \"vue-toastification/src/scss/_toastContainer\";\n@import \"vue-toastification/src/scss/_toast\";\n@import \"vue-toastification/src/scss/_closeButton\";\n@import \"vue-toastification/src/scss/_progressBar\";\n@import \"vue-toastification/src/scss/_icon\";\n@import \"vue-toastification/src/scss/animations/_bounce\";\n```\n\nThen you import it when registering the plugin\n```javascript\nimport Toast from \"vue-toastification\";\n\n// The magic is here\nimport \"./yourMainScssFile.scss\";\n\napp.use(Toast);\n```\n\n### Right to left support\nRight to left layouts are also supported. It can be enabled per toast or globally through plugin options:\n```js\n// Set RTL on individual toasts\ntoast.success(\"!detrevnI\", { rtl: true });\n\n// Or globally\napp.use(Toast, {\n  rtl: true\n});\n```\n\n\n### Transitions\nVue Toastification comes with built-in transitions, but you can also customize your own.\n\nDefault Usage using the built-in bounce transition:\n```js\napp.use(Toast, {\n  transition: \"Vue-Toastification__bounce\",\n  maxToasts: 20,\n  newestOnTop: true\n});\n```\n\nSome of the currently available built-in transitions are:\n- Bounce (default): Set the transition property to \"Vue-Toastification__bounce\"\n- Fade-In / Out: Set the transition property to \"Vue-Toastification__fade\"\n- Slide-In / Out (Blurred): Set the transition property to \"Vue-Toastification__slideBlurred\"\nHowever, new ones may be added so be sure to check the [live demo](https://maronato.github.io/vue-toastification/) page for the updated list.\n\n### Custom transitions\nWhen registering the plugin you can use your custom transitions as the toasts' transitions. You can use both named transitions or the transition classes separately.\n\nVue Toastification uses [Vue's built-in transition-group components](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/transitions.html#Overview), so read how they work before creating your own.\n\n> Note: You only need to implement the `enter-active`, `leave-active` and `move` transition classes.\n\nWe'll use the following transition in our examples:\n```css\n@keyframes fadeIn {\n  from {\n    opacity: 0;\n  }\n  to {\n    opacity: 1;\n  }\n}\n@keyframes fadeOut {\n  from {\n    opacity: 1;\n  }\n  to {\n    opacity: 0;\n  }\n}\n.fade-enter-active {\n  animation-name: fadeIn;\n  animation-duration: 750ms;\n  animation-fill-mode: both;\n}\n.fade-leave-active {\n  animation-name: fadeOut;\n  animation-duration: 750ms;\n  animation-fill-mode: both;\n}\n.fade-move {\n  transition-timing-function: ease-in-out;\n  transition-property: all;\n  transition-duration: 400ms;\n}\n```\n\n#### Named transitions\nTo setup named transitions just pass the transition name.\n\nUsing the transition defined above, we can use it like so:\n```javascript\napp.use(Toast, {\n    transition: \"fade\"\n});\n```\n\n#### Transition classes\nYou can also specify which entering, leaving and moving transitions to use. Please note that if you use custom transition classes you'll need to specify all 3 classes for it to work.\nYou can, however, use Vue Toastification's default \"bounce\" transition to fill the gaps. Its classes are `Vue-Toastification__bounce-enter-active`, `Vue-Toastification__bounce-leave-active` and `Vue-Toastification__bounce-move`.\n\nExample using a mix of `fade` and `bounce` transitions:\n```javascript\napp.use(Toast, {\n    transition: {\n        enter: \"fade-enter-active\",\n        leave: \"Vue-Toastification__bounce-leave-active\",\n        move: \"fade-move\"\n    }\n});\n```\n\n### Toast Icons\nBy default, all toasts will come with a little icon to the left representing what the message is about. These are fully customizable as you'll see.\n\n#### Disabling icons\nYou can entirely disable the icon from the toast by setting `icon: false` when either registering the plugin or creating toasts. Without the icon, the toast's content will fill its place and appear closer to the edge.\n\n```javascript\n// Disable every toast's icon by default\napp.use(Toast, {\n    icon: false\n});\n\n// Disable icons per toast\ntoast('No icon!', { icon: false });\n```\n\n#### Using custom icons\nYou can also use custom icons with the `icon` option. To do so, you'll probably need to install these icons in your app with an icon library, such as [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) or [Material Icons](https://google.github.io/material-design-icons/).\n\nYou can also install a Vue icon library with custom components, such as [Vue FontAwesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/vue-fontawesome).\n\nUsing them varies between icon libraries. You can either override icon classes with `icon: \"my-icon-class\"`, pass a custom component / JSX, or you can set up more complex icon systems by passing an object. Let's look at the options with some examples:\n\n```javascript\n// Using Font Awesome icons\ntoast('Icons are awesome!', { icon: 'fas fa-rocket' });\n\n// Using Material Icons\ntoast('Material icons!', {\n  icon: {\n    iconClass: 'material-icons',  // Optional\n    iconChildren: 'check_circle', // Optional\n    iconTag: 'span'               // Optional\n  }\n});\n```\n\nAs you can see, we can either just pass a string or define classes, children, and tags for our icons.\n\nWhen you just pass a string, for example `fas fa-rocket`, the rendered component will look like:\n```html\n<i class=\"fas fa-rocket\"></i>\n```\nIf your icon library supports that, then you're good to go!\n\nOther libraries require you to define icons with [ligatures](http://alistapart.com/article/the-era-of-symbol-fonts). To support that, Vue Toastification allows you to construct your icon component through some options: `iconClass`, `iconChildren` and `iconTag`.\n\nTaking the Material Icon example from above, the rendered component would look like:\n```html\n<span class=\"material-icons\">check_circle</span>\n```\n\nBoth examples will have an extra class, `Vue-Toastification__icon`. You can see what it does [here](https://github.com/Maronato/vue-toastification/blob/master/src/scss/_icon.scss) or you can override it with your CSS classes.\n\n### Close Button\nYou can modify the toast close buttons in 3 ways:\n- Hide it\n- Use a custom component instead of the standard one\n- Add extra classes to it\n\n#### Hiding the close button\nTo hide it, simply set `closeButton` to `false` when calling the toast or setting up the plugin\n```js\ntoast('No close button', {\n  closeButton: false\n});\n```\n\n#### Only show the close button on hover\nYou can also hide the close button unless the toast is being hovered. To do so, set `showCloseButtonOnHover` to `true` when calling the toast or setting up the plugin\n\n```js\ntoast('No close button', {\n  showCloseButtonOnHover: true\n});\n```\n\n#### Custom close button component\nYou can also use custom components as close buttons. It accepts Single File Components, JSX and tag names:\n```js\ntoast('With a custom close component', {\n  closeButton: MyComponent\n});\n```\n\n#### Custom close button classes\nThe close button can be customized with custom classes. These can be either a single string or an array of strings\n\n```js\ntoast('With custom classes', {\n  closeButtonClassName: \"my-button-class\"\n});\n```\n\n### Presetting default toast options per type\nIf you want to unify the behavior throughout the application and **D**on't **R**epeat **Y**ourself, you could extract the default behavior for each type of toast.\n\n```javascript\nimport Toast, { TYPE } from \"vue-toastification\";\n\nconst options = {\n    toastDefaults: {\n        // ToastOptions object for each type of toast\n        [TYPE.ERROR]: {\n            timeout: 10000,\n            closeButton: false,\n        },\n        [TYPE.SUCCESS]: {\n            timeout: 3000,\n            hideProgressBar: true,\n        }    \n    }\n};\n\n\napp.use(Toast, options);\n```\n\n### Updating default options\nSome options are only available when registering the plugin, like `transition`, `maxToasts` and others. If you need to update those options in runtime, there is a method you can call to update the default options:\n```javascript\nconst update = {\n    transition: \"my-transition\"\n};\n\ntoast.updateDefaults(update);\n```\n> Note: `updateDefaults` will do a **shallow** update on your default options.\n\nYou can use `updateDefaults` to update any of the default [API options](#plugin-registration-vueuse), but be careful as they are updated globally, so all new toasts will share the new defaults.\n\n### Custom toast filters\nSome applications require custom logic to select which toasts to display and how to display them. To solve this issue, Vue Toastification provides you with two callback functions that give you fine control of your toasts. These are `filterBeforeCreate` and `filterToasts`.\n\n#### `filterBeforeCreate`\nCalled just before toast creation, `filterBeforeCreate` allows you to edit toast props in runtime or discard toasts entirely.\n\nIt takes two parameters:\n- The new toast's [props](#toast-options-object)\n- A list of existing toasts\n\nIt must return the modified toast props, or `false` to discard the toast.\n\nExample implementation of a *preventDuplicates* feature, which prevents toasts of the same type from appearing simultaneously:\n```js\n// App.js\n\n// Prevents toasts of the same type from appearing simultaneously, discarding duplicates\nconst filterBeforeCreate = (toast, toasts) => {\n  if (toasts.filter(t => t.type === toast.type).length !== 0) {\n    // Returning false discards the toast\n    return false;\n  }\n  // You can modify the toast if you want\n  return toast;\n}\n\napp.use(Toast, { filterBeforeCreate });\n```\n\n#### `filterToasts`\nThis callback enables you to filter *created* toasts from being **rendered**. It differs from `filterBeforeCreate` by allowing you to enqueue toasts, as opposed to the former, which allows you to discard them.\n\nIt takes the list of created toasts and must return a list of toasts to be rendered. Filtered toasts may be rendered later on.\n\nAnother example of `preventDuplicates` feature that enqueues toasts instead of discarding them:\n```js\n// App.js\n\n// Enqueues toasts of the same type, preventing duplicates\nconst filterToasts = (toasts) => {\n  // Keep track of existing types\n  const types = {};\n  return toasts.reduce((aggToasts, toast) => {\n    // Check if type was not seen before\n    if (!types[toast.type]) {\n      aggToasts.push(toast);\n      types[toast.type] = true;\n    }\n    return aggToasts;\n  }, []);\n}\n\napp.use(Toast, { filterToasts });\n```\n\n### Custom toast containers\nBy default, all toasts are mounted to a `div` that is a direct child of `document.body`, but your application may require that toasts be mounted elsewhere for whatever reason. Vue Toastification allows you to do that by accepting a `container` plugin option. That option may be either an `HTMLElement` or a function that returns or resolves into an `HTMLElement`.\n\n#### Existing nodes as toast containers\nTo use an existing node, simply pass it as the argument:\n\n```js\n// App.js\n\nconst myContainer = document.querySelector('#my-container');\n\napp.use(Toast, { container: myContainer });\n```\n\nYou may also use a function that returns the node:\n\n```js\n// App.js\n\nconst getContainer = () => document.querySelector('#my-container');\n\napp.use(Toast, { container: getContainer });\n```\n\n#### Async nodes as toast containers\nSometimes your node may not exist by the time the plugin is initialized. This may happen if, for example, it is created by Vue. To dynamically mount your component, pass an async function that resolves into a node instead.\n\nThe example below uses the [Mutation Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver) to test for a node identifiable by the ID `toast-container`:\n\n```js\n// App.js\n\nfunction asyncGetContainer() {\n  return new Promise(resolve => {\n    const observer = new MutationObserver(function(mutations, me) {\n      const myContainer = document.getElementById(\"toast-container\");\n      if (myContainer) {\n        me.disconnect();\n        resolve(myContainer);\n      }\n    });\n    observer.observe(document, {\n      childList: true,\n      subtree: true\n    });\n  });\n}\n\napp.use(Toast, { container: asyncGetContainer });\n```\n\nWhen setting up a container this way, all calls to `toast` will still be executed successfully and the toasts will be displayed all at once when it is mounted.\n\n## Advanced patterns\nVue Toastification works by creating a separate Vue App whenever you create a fresh instance of it. This means that you can create as many instances of it as you want and then interact with them independently.\n\n### Creating new instances\nTo create a new instance, use `createToastInterface`:\n```js\nimport { createToastInterface } from \"vue-toastification\";\n\nconst myInterface = createToastInterface();\n```\n\nIt accepts all of the regular PluginOptions too:\n```js\nimport { createToastInterface } from \"vue-toastification\";\n\nconst myInterface = createToastInterface({\n  timeout: 1000\n});\n```\n\nWhen called this way, a new Vue App is created and the Vue Toastification container is attached to it. All calls to the interface methods (`myInterface.success()`, etc), will trigger toasts to appear inside the new container.\n\n### Creating interfaces to existing instances\nIf you want to reuse a Vue Toastification instance, you can provide its EventBus to `createToastInterface` and get an interface to the existing instance, without creating a new one.\n\n```js\nimport { createToastInterface, EventBus } from \"vue-toastification\";\n\n// Create a new event bus\nconst myEventBus = new EventBus();\n\n// Generate the first interface, passing your eventBus as a parameter\nconst toast = createToastInterface({\n  timeout: 1000,\n  eventBus: myEventBus,\n});\n\n// Later, generate another interface to the same instance\nconst otherToast = createToastInterface(myEventBus);\n```\n\nYou can also create interfaces to existing instances using `useToast`:\n```js\nimport { useToast } from \"vue-toastification\";\nimport { myEventBus } from \"./otherFile.js\";\n\nconst toast = useToast(myEventBus);\n```\n\n### Manually providing interfaces\nSometimes you may need to create a new Vue Toastification instance and make it available only to a subtree of components. You can do that using `provideToast`, which takes PluginOptions, creates a new instance and provides an interface to it.\n```html\n<!-- Parent component -->\n<script>\n  import { provideToast } from \"vue-toastification\";\n\n  export default {\n    setup() {\n      provideToast({\n        timeout: 1000\n      })\n    }\n  }\n</script>\n\n<!-- Child components -->\n<script>\n  import { useToast } from \"vue-toastification\";\n\n  export default {\n    setup() {\n      const toast = useToast()\n    }\n  }\n</script>\n```\n\n## API\n\n### Plugin registration (app.use)\n| Option                 | Type                                                              | Default                                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| position               | String                                                            | `top-right`                                         | Position of the toast on the screen.

Use `useToast` to get a toast interface. The returning object is identical and has the same methods as `this.$toast`.\n\n## Deprecated options\nDue to some changes on Vue's transition system, `transitionDuration` has been deprecated. To change the duration of a transition, change or override the transition classes.\n\n# Acknowledgements\nThis project was heavily inspired by the beautiful [React Toastify](https://github.com/fkhadra/react-toastify) project and [other](https://github.com/shakee93/vue-toasted) [great](https://github.com/ankurk91/vue-toast-notification) Vue libraries.\n\n# License\nCopyright (C) 2020 [Maronato](https://github.com/Maronato).
