          "content": "# Contributing\n\nWrangler is an open-source project and we welcome contributions from you. Thank you!\n\nBelow you can find some guidance on how to be most effective when contributing to the project.\n\n## Before getting started\n\nWe really appreciate your interest in making a contribution, and we want to make sure that the process is as smooth and transparent as possible! To this end, we note that the Workers team is actively doing development in this repository, and while we consistently strive to communicate status and current thinking around all open issues, there may be times when context surrounding certain items is not up to date. Therefore, **for non-trivial changes, please always engage on the issue or create a discussion or feature request issue first before writing your code.** This will give us opportunity to flag any considerations you should be aware of before you spend time developing. Of course, for trivial changes, please feel free to go directly to filing a PR, with the understanding that the PR itself will serve as the place to discuss details of the change.\n\nThanks so much for helping us improve the [workers-sdk](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk), and we look forward to your contribution!\n\n## Getting started\n\n### Set up your environment\n\nWrangler is built and run on the Node.js JavaScript runtime.\n\n- Install the latest LTS version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/) - we recommend using a Node version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).\n- Install a code editor - we recommend using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).\n  - When opening the project in VS Code for the first time, it will prompt you to install the [recommended VS Code extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#:~:text=install%20the%20recommended%20extensions) for the project.\n- Install the [git](https://git-scm.com/) version control tool.\n\n### Fork and clone this repository\n\n#### For External Contributors\n\nAny contributions you make will be via [Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) on [GitHub](https://github.com/) developed in a local git repository and pushed to your own fork of the repository.\n\n- Ensure you have [created an account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account) on GitHub.\n- [Create your own fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) of [this repository](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk).\n- Clone your fork to your local machine\n  ```sh\n  > git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/workers-sdk\n  > cd workers-sdk\n  ```\n  You can see that your fork is setup as the `origin` remote repository.\n  Any changes you wish to make should be in a local branch that is then pushed to this origin remote.\n  ```sh\n  > git remote -v\n  origin\thttps://github.com/<your-github-username>/workers-sdk (fetch)\n  origin\thttps://github.com/<your-github-username>/workers-sdk (push)\n  ```\n- Add `cloudflare/workers-sdk` as the `upstream` remote repository.\n  ```sh\n  > git remote add upstream https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk\n  > git remote -v\n  origin\thttps://github.com/<your-github-username>/workers-sdk (fetch)\n  origin\thttps://github.com/<your-github-username>/workers-sdk (push)\n  upstream\thttps://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk (fetch)\n  upstream\thttps://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk (push)\n  ```\n- You should regularly pull from the `main` branch of the `upstream` repository to keep up to date with the latest changes to the project.\n  ```sh\n  > git switch main\n  > git pull upstream main\n  From https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk\n  * branch            main       -> FETCH_HEAD\n  Already up to date.\n  ```\n\n#### For Cloudflare Employees\n\nIf you are a Cloudflare employee, you do not need to fork the repository - instead, you can clone the main repository directly. This allows you to push branches directly to the upstream repository.\n\nIf you find that you don't have write access, please reach out to your manager or the Wrangler team internally.\n\nClone the main repository:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk.git\ncd workers-sdk\n```\n\nCreate new branches directly in the cloned repository and push them to the main repository:\n\n```sh\ngit checkout -b <new-branch-name>\ngit push origin <new-branch-name>\n```\n\n### Install dependencies\n\n**Warning**\nWhen working on Wrangler, you'll need to satisfy [`workerd`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd)'s `libc++1` runtime dependencies:\n\n- On Linux:\n  - libc++ (e.g. the package `libc++1` on Debian Bullseye)\n- On macOS:\n  - The XCode command line tools, which can be installed with xcode-select --install\n\nThe Node.js dependencies of the project are managed by the [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/) tool.\n\nThis repository is setup as a [mono-repo](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) of workspaces. The workspaces are stored in the [`packages`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/tree/main/packages) directory.\n\nWhile each workspace has its own dependencies, you install the dependencies using `pnpm` at the root of the project.\n\n> If you haven't used `pnpm` before, you can install it with `npm install -g pnpm`\n\n- Install all the dependencies\n  ```sh\n  > cd workers-sdk\n  > pnpm install\n  ```\n\n## Building and running\n\nWorkspaces in this project are mostly written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and compiled, by [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild), into JavaScript bundles for distribution.\n\n- Run a distributable for a specific workspace (e.g. wrangler)\n  ```sh\n  > pnpm run --filter wrangler start\n  ```\n- Build a distributable for a specific workspace (e.g. wrangler)\n  ```sh\n  > pnpm run build --filter wrangler\n  ```\n\n## Checking the code\n\nThe code in the repository is checked for type checking, formatting, linting and testing errors.\n\n- Run all checks in all the workspaces\n  ```sh\n  > pnpm run check\n  ```\n\nWhen doing normal development, you may want to run these checks individually.\n\n### Type Checking\n\nThe code is checked for type errors by [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).\n\n- Type check all the code in the repository\n  ```sh\n  > pnpm run check:type\n  ```\n- VS Code will also run type-checking while editing source code, providing immediate feedback.\n\n#### Changing TypeScript Version in VS Code's Command Palette\n\nFor TypeScript to work properly in the Monorepo the version used in VSCode must be the project's current TypeScript version, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the project in VSCode.\n\n2. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` (or `Cmd + Shift + P` on macOS) to open the command palette.\n\n3. In the command palette, type \"Select TypeScript Version\" and select the command with the same name that appears in the list.\n\n4. A submenu will appear with a list of available TypeScript versions. Choose the desired version you want to use for this project. If you have multiple versions installed, they will be listed here.\n\n- Selecting \"Use Workspace Version\" will use the version of TypeScript installed in the project's `node_modules` directory.\n\n5. After selecting the TypeScript version, VSCode will reload the workspace using the chosen version.\n\nNow you have successfully switched the TypeScript version used within the project via the command palette in VSCode.\nRemember that this change is specific to the current project and will not affect other projects or the default TypeScript version used by VSCode.\n\n### Linting\n\nThe code is checked for linting errors by [ESLint](https://eslint.org/).\n\n- Run the linting checks\n  ```sh\n  > pnpm run check:lint\n  ```\n- The repository has a recommended VS Code plugin to run ESLint checks while editing source code, providing immediate feedback.\n\n### Formatting\n\nThe code is checked for formatting errors by [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).\n\n- Run the formatting checks\n  ```sh\n  > pnpm run check:format\n  ```\n- The repository has a recommended VS Code plugin to run Prettier checks, and to automatically format using Prettier, while editing source code, providing immediate feedback\n- Use the following command to run prettier on the codebase\n  ```sh\n  > pnpm run prettify\n  ```\n\n### Testing\n\nTests in a workspace are executed, by [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/), which is configured to automatically compile and bundle the TypeScript before running the tests.\n\n- Run the tests for all the workspaces\n  ```sh\n  > pnpm run test\n  ```\n- Run the tests for a specific workspace (e.g. wrangler)\n  ```sh\n  > pnpm run test --filter wrangler\n  ```\n- Watch the files in a specific workspace (e.g. wrangler), and run the tests when anything changes\n  ```sh\n  > pnpm run --filter wrangler test:watch\n  ```\n  This will also run all the tests in a single process (rather than in parallel shards) and will increase the test-timeout to 50 seconds, which is helpful when debugging.\n\n## Steps For Making Changes\n\nEvery change you make should be stored in a [git commit](https://github.com/git-guides/git-commit).\nChanges should be committed to a new local branch, which then gets pushed to your fork of the repository on GitHub.\n\n- Ensure your `main` branch is up to date\n  ```sh\n  > git switch main\n  > git pull upstream main\n  ```\n- Create a new branch, based off the `main` branch\n  ```sh\n  > git checkout -b <new-branch-name> main\n  ```\n- Stage files to include in a commit\n  - Use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol#_git-support)\n  - Or add and commit files via the command line\n  ```sh\n  > git add <paths-to-changes-files>\n  > git commit\n  ```\n- Push changes to your fork\n  ```sh\n  git push -u origin <new-branch-name>\n  ```\n- Once you are happy with your changes, create a Pull Request on GitHub\n- The format for Pull Request titles is `[package name] description`, where the package name should indicate which package of the `workers-sdk` monorepo your PR pertains to (e.g. `wrangler`/`pages-shared`/`chrome-devtools-patches`), and the description should be a succinct summary of the change you're making.\n- GitHub will insert a template for the body of your Pull Request—it's important to carefully fill out all the fields, giving as much detail as possible to reviewers.\n\n## PR Review\n\nPR review is a critical and required step in the process for landing changes. This is an opportunity to catch potential issues, improve the quality of the work, celebrate good design, and learn from each other. As a reviewer, it's important to be thoughtful about the proposed changes and communicate any feedback.\n\n## PR Previews\n\nEvery PR will have an associated pre-release build for all releaseable packages within the repository, powered by our [prerelease registry](packages/prerelease-registry). You can find links to prereleases for each package in a comment automatically posted by GitHub Actions on each opened PR ([for example](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/pull/7172#issuecomment-2457244715)).\n\nIt's also possible to generate preview builds for the applications in the repository. These aren't generated automatically because they're pretty slow CI jobs, but you can trigger preview builds by adding one of the following labels to your PR:\n\n- `preview:chrome-devtools-patches` for deploying [chrome-devtools-patches](packages/chrome-devtools-patches)\n- `preview:workers-playground` for deploying [workers-playground](packages/workers-playground)\n- `preview:quick-edit` for deploying [quick-edit](packages/quick-edit)\n\nOnce built, you can find the preview link for these applications in the [Deploy Pages Previews](.github/workflows/deploy-pages-previews.yml) action output\n\n## PR Tests\n\nEvery PR should include tests for the functionality that's being added. Most changes will be to [Wrangler](packages/wrangler/src/__tests__) (using Vitest), [Miniflare](packages/miniflare/test) (using Ava), or [C3](packages/create-cloudflare/src/__tests__) (using Vitest), and should include unit tests within the testing harness of those packages. For documentation on how these testing frameworks work, see:\n\n- Vitest: https://vitest.dev/guide\n- Ava: https://github.com/avajs/ava?tab=readme-ov-file#documentation\n\nIf your PR includes functionality that's difficult to unit test, you can add a fixture test by creating a new package in the `fixtures/` folder. This allows for adding a test that requires a specific filesystem or worker setup (for instance, `fixtures/no-bundle-import` tests the interaction of Wrangler with a specific set of JS, WASM, text, and binary modules on the filesystem). When adding a fixture test, include a `vitest.config.mts` file within the new package, which will ensure it's run as part of the `workers-sdk` CI. You should merge your own configuration with the default config from the root of the repo.\n\nA good default example is the following:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineProject, mergeConfig } from \"vitest/config\";\nimport configShared from \"../../vitest.shared\";\n\nexport default mergeConfig(\n  configShared,\n  defineProject({\n    test: {\n      // config overrides\n    }\n  })\n});\n```\n\nIf you need to test the interaction of Wrangler with a real Cloudflare account, you can add an E2E test within the `packages/wrangler/e2e` folder. This lets you add a test for functionality that requires real credentials (i.e. testing whether a worker deployed from Wrangler can be accessed over the internet).\n\nWhen you open a PR to the `workers-sdk` repo, you should expect several checks to run in CI. For most PRs (except for those which trigger the **C3 E2E (Quarantine)** Action), every check should pass (although some will be skipped).\n\nA summary of this repositories actions can be found [here](.github/workflows/README.md)\n\n## Running e2e tests locally\n\nTo run the e2e tests locally, you'll need a Cloudflare API Token and run:\n\n```sh\n$ WRANGLER=\"node ~/path/to/workers-sdk/packages/wrangler/wrangler-dist/cli.js\" CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=$CLOUDFLARE_TESTING_ACCOUNT_ID CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=$CLOUDFLARE_TESTING_API_TOKEN pnpm run test:e2e\n```\n\nYou may optionally want to append a filename pattern to limit which e2e tests are run. Also you may want to set `--bail=n` to limit the number of fails tests to show the error before the rest of the tests finish running and to limit the noise in that output:\n\n```sh\n$ WRANGLER=\"node ~/path/to/workers-sdk/packages/wrangler/wrangler-dist/cli.js\" CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=$CLOUDFLARE_TESTING_ACCOUNT_ID CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=$CLOUDFLARE_TESTING_API_TOKEN pnpm run test:e2e [file-pattern] --bail=1\n```\n\n### Creating an API Token\n\n1. Go to [\"My Profile\" > \"User API Tokens\"](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens)\n1. Click \"Create Token\"\n1. Use the \"Edit Cloudflare Workers\" template\n1. Set \"Account Resources\" to \"Include\" \"DevProd Testing\" (you can use any account you have access to)\n1. Set \"Zone Resources\" to \"All zones from an account\" and the same account as above\n1. Click \"Continue to summary\"\n1. Verify your token works by running the curl command provided\n1. Set the environment variables in your terminal or in your profile file (e.g. ~/.zshrc, ~/.bashrc, ~/.profile, etc):\n\n```sh\nexport CLOUDFLARE_TESTING_ACCOUNT_ID=\"<Account ID for the token you just created>\"\nexport CLOUDFLARE_TESTING_API_TOKEN=\"<Token you just created>\"\n```\n\nNote: Workers created in the e2e tests that fail might not always be cleaned up (deleted). Internal users with access to the \"DevProd Testing\" account can rely on an automated job to clean up the Workers based on the format of the name. If you use another account, please be aware you may want to manually delete the Workers yourself.\n\n## Changesets\n\nEvery non-trivial change to the project - those that should appear in the changelog - must be captured in a \"changeset\".\nWe use the [`changesets`](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/README.md) tool for creating changesets, publishing versions and updating the changelog.\n\n- Create a changeset for the current change.\n  ```sh\n  > pnpm changeset\n  ```\n- Select which workspaces are affected by the change and whether the version requires a major, minor or patch release.\n- Update the generated changeset with a description of the change.\n- Include the generate changeset in the current commit.\n  ```sh\n  > git add ./changeset/*.md\n  ```\n\n### Changeset message format\n\nEach changeset is a file that describes the change being merged. This file is used to generate the changelog when the changes are released.\n\nTo help maintain consistency in the changelog, changesets should have the following format:\n\n```\n<TITLE>\n\n<BODY>\n```\n\n- `TITLE` should be a single sentence containing an imperative description of the change.\n- `BODY` should be one or more paragraphs that go into more detail about the reason for the change and anything notable about the approach taken.\n\n### Changeset file example\n\nThe generated changeset file will contain the package name and type of change (eg. `patch`, `minor`, or `major`), followed by our changeset format described above.\n\nHere's an example of a `patch` to the `wrangler` package:\n\n```\n---\n\"wrangler\": patch\n---\n\nReplace the word \"publish\" with \"deploy\" everywhere.\n\nWe should be consistent with the word that describes how we get a worker to the edge. The command is `deploy`, so let's use that everywhere.\n```\n\n### Types of changes\n\nWe use the following guidelines to determine the kind of change for a PR:\n\n- Bugfixes and experimental features are considered to be 'patch' changes. Be sure to log warnings when experimental features are used.\n- New stable features and new deprecation warnings for future breaking changes are considered 'minor' changes. These changes shouldn't break existing code, but the deprecation warnings should suggest alternate solutions to not trigger the warning.\n- Breaking changes are considered to be 'major' changes. These are usually when deprecations take effect, or functional breaking behaviour is added with relevant logs (either as errors or warnings.)\n\n### Styleguide\n\nWhen contributing to Wrangler, please refer to the [`STYLEGUIDE.md file`](https://github.com/STYLEGUIDE.md) file where possible to help maintain consistent patterns throughout Wrangler.\n\n## Releases\n\nWe generally cut Wrangler releases on Tuesday & Thursday each week. If you need a release cut outside of the regular cadence, please reach out to the [@cloudflare/wrangler-admins](https://github.com/orgs/cloudflare/teams/wrangler-admins) team.\n"

          "content": "# Triage Process and GitHub Labels for Wrangler\n\nThis document describes how the team uses labels to triage issues on GitHub.\n\nIssue triage should occur daily so that issues can be prioritized against other work currently planned.\n\nIf an issue or PR obviously relates to a release regression, we must assign an appropriate priority (`P0` or `P1`) and ensure that someone from the team is actively working to resolve it.\n\n## Triage Steps\n\nAnyone can triage issues as they arrive in the repository.\n\nNew untriaged issues can be found by filtering the issues list for those [not in a project](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+-project%3Acloudflare%2F1+-project%3Acloudflare%2F2+).\n\nFollow these steps to triage an issue.\n\n### Step 0: Is this a Pages or Wrangler issue?\n\nIf the issue refers only to Pages commands then apply the `pages` label and add the issue to the [Pages](https://github.com/orgs/cloudflare/projects/2) GitHub project.\n\nOtherwise, add the issue to the [Wrangler](https://github.com/orgs/cloudflare/projects/1) GitHub project, set its status to `Untriaged`, and continue to step 1.\n\n### Step 1: Does the issue have enough information?\n\nGauge whether the issue has enough information to act upon.\nThis typically includes the version of Wrangler being used and steps to reproduce.\n\n- If the issue may be legitimate but needs more information, add the `needs clarification` label.\n- If the issue does not provide clear steps to reproduce the problem then add the `needs reproduction` label.\n\nThese labels can be revisited if the author can provide further clarification.\nYou can see a list of issues that need revisiting by filtering on [\"needs reproduction\" and \"needs clarification\"](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+project%3Acloudflare%2F1+label%3A%22needs+clarification%22).\n\nIf the issue does have enough information, move on to step 2.\n\n### Step 2: Type of issue\n\nChange the state of the issue in the [Wrangler](https://github.com/orgs/cloudflare/projects/1) to `Backlog`.\n\n- By default, all issues are considered bugs, apply the `bug` label and a priority label.\n- If the issue is a feature request, apply the `enhancement` label. Use your judgement to determine\n  whether the feature request is reasonable. If it's clear that the issue requests something\n  infeasible, close the issue with a comment explaining why.\n- If the issue is an RFC or discussion, apply the `discussion` label.\n\nUnless they're capturing a legitimate bug, redirect requests for debugging help or advice to a more\nappropriate channel such as [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/cloudflaredev) or, for paying customers, their\nsupport contact.\n\n### Step 3: Set a Priority\n\nFor bug reports, set a priority level in the [Wrangler](https://github.com/orgs/cloudflare/projects/1) GitHub project.\n\n| Label | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| P0    | An issue that causes a full outage, breakage, or major function unavailability for everyone, without any known workaround. The issue must be fixed immediately, taking precedence over all other work. Should receive updates at least once per day. |\n| P1    | An issue that significantly impacts a large percentage of users; if there is a workaround it is partial or overly painful. The issue should be resolved before the next release.                                                                     |\n| P2    | The issue is important to a large percentage of users, with a workaround. Issues that are significantly ugly or painful (especially first-use or install-time issues). Issues with workarounds that would otherwise be P0 or P1.                     |\n| P3    | An issue that is relevant to core functions, but does not impede progress. Important, but not urgent.                                                                                                                                                |\n| P4    | A relatively minor issue that is not relevant to core functions, or relates only to the attractiveness or pleasantness of use of the system. Good to have but not necessary changes/fixes.                                                           |\n| P5    | The team acknowledges the request but (due to any number of reasons) does not plan to work on or accept contributions for this request. The issue remains open for discussion.                                                                       |\n\nIssues marked with \"feature\" or \"discussion\" don't require a priority.\n\n### Step 4: Additional labels\n\nThe following labels can also be added to issues to provide further information to help prioritize them:\n\n| Label         | Description                                                                                                                   |\n| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| big idea      | The issue covers a large change that is likely to require significant planning and implementation via multiple PRs.           |\n| blocked       | The issue cannot be resolved because it is blocked by another issue, inside or outside the Wrangler project.                  |\n| documentation | The issue refers to documentation, error messages or warnings, then apply the `documentation` label.                          |\n| internal      | The issue refers to a problem with the Cloudflare internal API or processes that cannot be resolved within Wrangler alone.    |\n| maintenance   | The issue refers to changes that will improve the processes of the Wrangler team, rather than Wrangler itself.                |\n| polish        | Resolving the issue will improve the Developer Experience when using Wrangler, rather than changing it fundamental behaviour. |\n| quick win     | The issue only requires minor changes, and would be a good first contribution to Wrangler                                     |\n"
