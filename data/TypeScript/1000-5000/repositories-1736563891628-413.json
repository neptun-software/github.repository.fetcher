It can be run as a standalone server, or\ninside of notebook environments such as Colab, Jupyter, and Google Cloud Vertex\nAI notebooks.\n\nLIT is built to answer questions such as:\n\n*   **What kind of examples** does my model perform poorly on?\n*   **Why did my model make this prediction?** Can this prediction be attributed\n    to adversarial behavior, or to undesirable priors in the training set?\n*   **Does my model behave consistently** if I change things like textual style,\n    verb tense, or pronoun gender?\n\n![Example of LIT UI](https://pair-code.github.io/lit/assets/images/readme-fig-1.png)\n\nLIT supports a variety of debugging workflows through a browser-based UI.\nFeatures include:\n\n*   **Local explanations** via salience maps and rich visualization of model\n    predictions.\n*   **Aggregate analysis** including custom metrics, slicing and binning, and\n    visualization of embedding spaces.\n*   **Counterfactual generation** via manual edits or generator plug-ins to\n    dynamically create and evaluate new examples.\n*   **Side-by-side mode** to compare two or more models, or one model on a pair\n    of examples.\n*   **Highly extensible** to new model types, including classification,\n    regression, span labeling, seq2seq, and language modeling. Supports\n    multi-head models and multiple input features out of the box.\n*   **Framework-agnostic** and compatible with TensorFlow, PyTorch, and more.\n\nLIT has a [website](https://pair-code.github.io/lit) with live demos, tutorials,\na setup guide and more.\n\nStay up to date on LIT by joining the\n[lit-announcements mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/lit-annoucements).\n\nFor a broader overview, check out [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05122) and the\n[user guide](https://pair-code.github.io/lit/documentation/ui_guide).\n\n## Documentation\n\n*   [Documentation index](https://pair-code.github.io/lit/documentation/)\n*   [FAQ](https://pair-code.github.io/lit/documentation/faq)\n*   [Release notes](./RELEASE.md)\n\n## Download and Installation\n\nLIT can be installed via `pip` or built from source. Building from source is\nnecessary if you want to make code changes.\n\n### Install from PyPI with pip\n\n```sh\npip install lit-nlp\n```\n\nThe default `pip` installation will install all required packages to use the LIT\nPython API, built-in interpretability components, and web application. To\ninstall dependencies for the provided demos or test suite, install LIT with the\nappropriate optional dependencies.\n\n```sh\n# To install dependencies for the discriminative AI examples (GLUE, Penguin)\npip install 'lit-nlp[examples-discriminative-ai]'\n\n# To install dependencies for the generative AI examples (Prompt Debugging)\npip install 'lit-nlp[examples-generative-ai]'\n\n# To install dependencies for all examples plus the test suite\npip install 'lit-nlp[test]'\n```\n\n### Install from source\n\nClone the repo:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/PAIR-code/lit.git\ncd lit\n```\n\nNote: be sure you are running Python 3.9+. If you have a different version on\nyour system, use the `conda` instructions below to set up a Python 3.9\nenvironment.\n\nSet up a Python environment with `venv` (or your preferred environment manager).\nNote that these instructions assume you will be making code changes to LIT and\nincludes the full requirements for all examples and the test suite. See the\nother optional dependency possibilities in the install with pip section.\n\n```sh\npython -m venv .venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate\npython -m pip install -e '.[test]'\n```\n\nThe LIT repo does not include a distributable version of the LIT app. You must\nbuild it from source.\n\n```sh\n(cd lit_nlp; yarn && yarn build)\n```\n\nNote: if you see [an error](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/2821)\nrunning `yarn` on Ubuntu/Debian, be sure you have the\n[correct version installed](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#linux-tab).\n\n## Running LIT\n\nExplore a collection of hosted demos on the\n[demos page](https://pair-code.github.io/lit/demos).\n\n### Using container images\n\nSee the [containerization guide](https://pair-code.github.io/lit/documentation/docker) for instructions on using LIT\nlocally in Docker, Podman, etc.\n\nLIT also provides pre-built images that can take advantage of accelerators,\nmaking Generative AI and LLM use cases easier to work with. Check out the\n[LIT on GCP docs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/responsible-ai/lit-on-gcp)\nfor more.\n\n### Quick-start: classification and regression\n\nTo explore classification and regression models tasks from the popular\n[GLUE benchmark](https://gluebenchmark.com/):\n\n```sh\npython -m lit_nlp.examples.glue.demo --port=5432 --quickstart\n```\n\nNavigate to http://localhost:5432 to access the LIT UI.\n\nYour default view will be a\n[small BERT-based model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08962) fine-tuned on the\n[Stanford Sentiment Treebank](https://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/treebank.html),\nbut you can switch to\n[STS-B](http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/stswiki/index.php/STSbenchmark) or\n[MultiNLI](https://cims.nyu.edu/~sbowman/multinli/) using the toolbar or the\ngear icon in the upper right.\n\nAnd navigate to http://localhost:5432 for the UI.\n\n### Notebook usage\n\nColab notebooks showing the use of LIT inside of notebooks can be found at\n[lit_nlp/examples/notebooks](./lit_nlp/examples/notebooks).\n\nWe provide a simple\n[Colab demo](https://colab.research.google.com/github/PAIR-code/lit/blob/main/lit_nlp/examples/notebooks/LIT_sentiment_classifier.ipynb).\nRun all the cells to see LIT on an example classification model in the notebook.\n\n### More Examples\n\nSee [lit_nlp/examples](./lit_nlp/examples). Most are run similarly to the\nquickstart example above:\n\n```sh\npython -m lit_nlp.examples.<example_name>.demo --port=5432 [optional --args]\n```\n\n## User Guide\n\nTo learn about LIT's features, check out the [user guide](https://pair-code.github.io/lit/documentation/ui_guide), or\nwatch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuRI_VK83dU).\n\n## Adding your own models or data\n\nYou can easily run LIT with your own model by creating a custom `demo.py`\nlauncher, similar to those in [lit_nlp/examples](./lit_nlp/examples). The\nbasic steps are:\n\n*   Write a data loader which follows the [`Dataset` API](https://pair-code.github.io/lit/documentation/api#datasets)\n*   Write a model wrapper which follows the [`Model` API](https://pair-code.github.io/lit/documentation/api#models)\n*   Pass models, datasets, and any additional\n    [components](https://pair-code.github.io/lit/documentation/api#interpretation-components) to the LIT server class\n\nFor a full walkthrough, see\n[adding models and data](https://pair-code.github.io/lit/documentation/api#adding-models-and-data).\n\n## Extending LIT with new components\n\nLIT is easy to extend with new interpretability components, generators, and\nmore, both on the frontend or the backend.

Major changes include:\n* An `LM salience` module in the LIT UI that computes generations, tokenization,\nand sequence salience on-demand;\n* Computation of sequence salience at different granularities, from the smallest\npossible level of tokens, to more interpretable larger spans, such as words,\nsentences, lines, or paragraphs.\n* Support of OSS modeling frameworks, including KerasNLP and Hugging Face\nTransformers for sequence salience computation.\nThis release would not have been possible without the work of our contributors.\nMany thanks to:\n[Ryan Mullins](https://github.com/RyanMullins),\n[Ian Tenney](https://github.com/iftenney),\n[Bin Du](https://github.com/bdu91), and\n[Cibi Arjun](https://github.com/cpka145).\n\n### New Stuff\n* LM salience module in the LIT UI -\n[ab294bd](https://github.com/PAIR-code/lit/commit/ab294bd3e15675c0e63e5a16ffe4b8cd4941c94f)\n[5cffc4d](https://github.com/PAIR-code/lit/commit/5cffc4d933e611587b00c25861c911d5f734fa22)\n[40bb57a](https://github.com/PAIR-code/lit/commit/40bb57a2531257c38137188090a24e70d47581c8)\n[d3980cc](https://github.com/PAIR-code/lit/commit/d3980cc5414e1f9be895defc4f967bee8a2480fc)\n[406fbc7](https://github.com/PAIR-code/lit/commit/406fbc7690ee72f6f96ecf68f1238822ae8951c2)\n[77583e7](https://github.com/PAIR-code/lit/commit/77583e74236aa443a21ad0779b0ab9c023821b93)\n[a758f98](https://github.com/PAIR-code/lit/commit/a758f98c5153f23955b0190a75dc1258ba57b645)\n* Sequence salience for decoder-only LM, with support for GPT-2 and KerasNLP -\n[27e6901](https://github.com/PAIR-code/lit/commit/27e6901164044c0d33658603369a55600da0b202)\n[80cf699](https://github.com/PAIR-code/lit/commit/80cf699f92cd77d58cb2a2a60b9314010b1f336c)\n[1df3ba8](https://github.com/PAIR-code/lit/commit/1df3ba8449e865edb5806c10c8054c246d1e38e3)\n[b6ab352](https://github.com/PAIR-code/lit/commit/b6ab3522b301810cab3c75723f3fe0dabf829577)\n[c97a710](https://github.com/PAIR-code/lit/commit/c97a710416538906ea6b269f90264c0602a15593)\n* Prompt examples for sequence salience -\n[4f19891](https://github.com/PAIR-code/lit/commit/4f1989180ee570642285682f843242be5bffb9ef)\n[000c844](https://github.com/PAIR-code/lit/commit/000c84486ed61439c98dbfdd92959bdbb6f5119f)\n[34aa110](https://github.com/PAIR-code/lit/commit/34aa110c36fe0c7ec670f06662078d2f572c79c6)\n[ca032ff](https://github.com/PAIR-code/lit/commit/ca032ffb3196e71fd0a7a09118635ca6dafc8153)\n\n\n### Non-breaking Changes, Bug Fixes, and Enhancements\n* Improvements to display various fields and their default ranges -\n[8a3f366](https://github.com/PAIR-code/lit/commit/8a3f366816833ead164ecfca778b465ef6d074bb)\n[e63b674](https://github.com/PAIR-code/lit/commit/e63b67484fc7f4dbfa3484126c355350d2127bf7)\n[d274508](https://github.com/PAIR-code/lit/commit/d2745088966c4ac31a3755f55096eeb8193c5a91)\n* Allow only displaying the UI layouts provided by users -\n[a219863](https://github.com/PAIR-code/lit/commit/a21986342d83ae64d58607e337fab9db7736242a)\n* Internal dependency changes -\n[f254fa8](https://github.com/PAIR-code/lit/commit/f254fa8500d6267278fa3dc32fb4bbf56beb7cf7)\n[724bdee](https://github.com/PAIR-code/lit/commit/724bdee1f9ea45ce998b9031eea4ad1169299efb)\n[2138bd9](https://github.com/PAIR-code/lit/commit/2138bd920e72553f9c920ba489962c8649738574)\n* Fix issues with adding more than one example from counterfactual generators -\n[d4302bd](https://github.com/PAIR-code/lit/commit/d4302bd6bfc7e4c778ba0e96397ac620242a8d21)\n* Fix issues with loading `SimpleSentimentModel` -\n[ac8ed59](https://github.com/PAIR-code/lit/commit/ac8ed5902a2c96019ea1137b5138d48017fabf4e)\n* Notebook widget improvements -\n[cdf79eb](https://github.com/PAIR-code/lit/commit/cdf79eb9048be3e6798e916d5e1ac4cc294929b0)\n* Docs updates\n\n## Release 1.0\n\nThis is a major release, covering many new features and API changes from the\n`dev` branch since the v0.5 release over 8 months ago. This release includes\na variety of breaking changes meant to simplify various aspects of the LIT API\nand visual changes to improve usability. This release includes over 250 commits.\nMajor changes include:\n\n* Refactored python code to remove `_with_metadata` methods from all component\n  and model classes.\n* Refactored Model and BatchedModel python classes to remove `predict_minibatch`\n  method.\n* Reworked UI and backend logic for dynamic loading of new datasets and models\n  from the UI. This makes use of the new `init_spec` methods for datasets and\n  model classes.\n  * Added a blank demo with no models or datasets preloaded which allows for\n    dynamic loading of models and datasets through the UI.\n* Refactored to upgrade metrics calculation from a type of interpreter to its\n  own top-level concept.\n* Updated front-end layout code to default to a new layout that includes a\n  full height side-panel on the left side to complement the existing top and\n  bottom panels, providing for more customization of module layouts.\n* Added automatic metrics calculations for multilabel models.\n* Added target selector dropdown for saliency methods.\n* A visual redesign of the Salience Clustering module.\n* Improved searching capabilities in the Data Table module.\n* Improved the Data Table module's display of long strings through a \"Show more\"\n  capability.\n* Updated to Python 3.10.\n* Updated to Node 18 and Typescript 5.0.\n* Improved documentation pages, now at https://pair-code.github.io/lit/documentation/\n\n\nThis release would not have been possible without the work of our new\ncontributors in 2023.

0.5\n\nThis is a major release, covering many new features from the `dev` branch since\nthe v0.4 release nearly 11 months ago. Most notably, we're renaming! It's still\nLIT, but now the L stands for \"Learning\" instead of \"Language\", to better\nreflect the scope of LIT and support for non-text modalities like images and\ntabular data. Additionally, we've made lots of improvements, including:\n\n* New modules including salience clustering, tabular feature attribution, and\n  a new Dive module for data exploration (inspired by our prior work on\n  [Facets Dive](https://pair-code.github.io/facets/)).\n* New demos and tutorials for input salience comparison and tabular feature\n  attribution.\n* Many UI improvements, with better consistency across modules and shared\n  functionality for colors, slicing, and faceting of data.\n* Better performance on large datasets (up to 100k examples), as well as\n  improvements to the type system and new validation routines (`--validate`) for\n  models and datasets.\n* Download data as CSV directly from tables in the UI, and in notebook mode\n  access selected examples directly from Python.\n* Update to Python 3.9 and TypeScript 4.7.\n\nThis release would not have been possible without the work of many new\ncontributors in 2022.
