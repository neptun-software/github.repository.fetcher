This allows the\nuser to integrate visualizations with other Jupyter interactive widgets to\ncreate integrated GUIs with a few lines of Python code.\n\n## Documentation\n\nYou can follow the documentation on https://bqplot.github.io/bqplot\n\n## Trying it online\n\nTo try out bqplot interactively in your web browser, just click on the binder\nlink:\n\n[![Binder](docs/source/binder-logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bqplot/bqplot/stable?filepath=examples/Index.ipynb)\n\n### Dependencies\n\nThis package depends on the following packages:\n\n- `ipywidgets` (version >=7.0.0, <8.0)\n- `traitlets` (version >=4.3.0, <5.0)\n- `traittypes` (Version >=0.2.1, <0.3)\n- `numpy`\n- `pandas`\n\n### Installation\n\nUsing pip:\n\n```\n$ pip install bqplot\n```\n\nUsing conda\n\n```\n$ conda install -c conda-forge bqplot\n```\n\nIf you are using JupyterLab <=2:\n\n```\n$ jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager bqplot\n```\n\n##### Development installation\n\nFor a development installation (requires JupyterLab (version >= 4) and yarn):\n\n```\n$ git clone https://github.com/bqplot/bqplot.git\n$ cd bqplot\n$ pip install -e .\n$ jupyter nbextension install --py --overwrite --symlink --sys-prefix bqplot\n$ jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix bqplot\n```\n\nNote for developers: the `--symlink` argument on Linux or OS X allows one to\nmodify the JavaScript code in-place. This feature is not available\nwith Windows.\n\nFor the experimental JupyterLab extension, install the Python package, make sure the Jupyter widgets extension is installed, and install the bqplot extension:\n\n```\n$ pip install \"ipywidgets>=7.6\"\n$ jupyter labextension develop . --overwrite\n```\n\nWhenever you make a change of the JavaScript code, you will need to rebuild:\n\n```\ncd js\njlpm run build\n```\n\nThen refreshing the JupyterLab/Jupyter Notebook is enough to reload the changes.\n\n##### Running tests\n\nYou can install the dependencies necessary to run the tests with:\n\n```bash\n    conda env update -f test-environment.yml\n```\n\nAnd run it with for Python tests:\n\n```bash\n    pytest\n```\n\nAnd `cd js` to run the JS tests with:\n\n```bash\njlpm run test\n```\n\nEvery time you make a change on your tests it's necessary to rebuild the JS side:\n\n```bash\njlpm run build\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n### Using the `pyplot` API\n\n[![Pyplot Screenshot](/pyplot.png)](https://github.com/bqplot/bqplot/blob/master/examples/Basic%20Plotting/Pyplot.ipynb)\n\n### Using the `Object Model` API\n\n[![Bqplot Screenshot](/bqplot.png)](https://github.com/bqplot/bqplot/blob/master/examples/Advanced%20Plotting/Advanced%20Plotting.ipynb)\n\n## Install a previous bqplot version (Only for JupyterLab <= 2)\n\nIn order to install a previous bqplot version, you need to know which front-end version (JavaScript) matches with the back-end version (Python).\n\nFor example, in order to install bqplot `0.11.9`, you need the labextension version `0.4.9`.\n\n```\n$ pip install bqplot==0.11.9\n$ jupyter labextension install bqplot@0.4.9\n```\n\nVersions lookup table:\n\n| `back-end (Python)` | `front-end (JavaScript)` |\n|---------------------|--------------------------|\n| 0.12.14             | 0.5.14                   |\n| 0.12.13             | 0.5.13                   |\n| 0.12.12             | 0.5.12                   |\n| 0.12.11             | 0.5.11                   |\n| 0.12.10             | 0.5.10                   |\n| 0.12.9              | 0.5.9                    |\n| 0.12.8              | 0.5.8                    |\n| 0.12.7              | 0.5.7                    |\n| 0.12.6              | 0.5.6                    |\n| 0.12.4              | 0.5.4                    |\n| 0.12.3              | 0.5.3                    |\n| 0.12.2              | 0.5.2                    |\n| 0.12.1              | 0.5.1                    |\n| 0.12.0              | 0.5.0                    |\n| 0.11.9              | 0.4.9                    |\n| 0.11.8              | 0.4.8                    |\n| 0.11.7              | 0.4.7                    |\n| 0.11.6              | 0.4.6                    |\n| 0.11.5              | 0.4.5                    |\n| 0.11.4              | 0.4.5                    |\n| 0.11.3              | 0.4.4                    |\n| 0.11.2              | 0.4.3                    |\n| 0.11.1              | 0.4.1                    |\n| 0.11.0              | 0.4.0                    |\n\n## Development\n\nSee our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) to know how to contribute and set up a development environment.\n\n## License\n\nThis software is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.
