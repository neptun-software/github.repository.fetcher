          "content": "# Kiali Governance\n\nThis document defines governance policies for the Kiali project.\n\n## Maintainers\n\nKiali Maintainers have write access to the [Kiali GitHub repositories](https://github.com/kiali).\nThey can merge their own patches or patches from others. Maintainers collectively manage the project's\nresources and contributors. If needed, maintainers are elegible to become admins of specific repositories, or owners\nof the Kiali organization.\n\nThese privileges are granted with an expectation of responsibility: maintainers care about the Kiali project and want to help it grow and improve. Above the ability to contribute changes, a maintainer has demonstrated the ability to collaborate well with the team, assign appropriate code reviewers, contribute high-quality code, and be thorough and timely with fixes, tests and documentation.\n\nA maintainer is a contributor to the Kiali project's success and a citizen helping the project succeed.\n\nCurrent list of maintainers (alphabetically ordered):\n\n- [aljesusg](https://github.com/aljesusg)\n- [ferhoyos](https://github.com/ferhoyos)\n- [hhovsepy](https://github.com/hhovsepy)\n- [jmazzitelli](https://github.com/jmazzitelli)\n- [josunect](https://github.com/josunect)\n- [leandroberetta](https://github.com/leandroberetta)\n- [nrfox](https://github.com/nrfox)\n- [xunzhuo](https://github.com/xunzhuo)\n\n### Becoming a Maintainer\n\nTo become a Maintainer you need to demonstrate the following:\n\n- commitment to the project\n  - participate in discussions, contributions, code reviews for 3 months or more,\n  - perform code reviews for 10 non-trivial pull requests,\n  - contribute 10 non-trivial pull requests and have them merged,\n- ability to write high quality code and/or documentation,\n- ability to collaborate with the team,\n- understanding of team policies and processes,\n- understanding of the project's code base, and coding and documentation style.\n\nA new maintainer must be proposed by an existing maintainer by opening a pull request\nmodifying the maintainers list to add the new proposed maintainer, or via a [GitHub\ndiscussion](https://github.com/kiali/kiali/discussions/new) under the Governance category.\nThe following information must be provided:\n\n- nominee's GitHub username,\n- an explanation of why the nominee should be a maintainer,\n- a list of links to non-trivial pull requests (top 10) authored by the nominee.\n\nTwo other maintainers need to second the nomination. If no one objects in 5 working days (U.S.), the nomination is accepted. If anyone objects or wants more information, the maintainers discuss and usually come to a consensus (within the 5 working days). If issues can't be resolved, there's a simple majority vote among current maintainers.\n\n## Testers\n\nKiali testers dedicate time and resources to ensure that the Kiali project is\ndelivered with good quality, by actively trying pull requests to find bugs,\nperformance issues and any other kind of defect. Testers may also write manual or\nautomated tests. The focus is on \"System testing\" and \"Integration testing\",\nalthough it is possible to do simple sanity, smoke and regression testing, or\nsimply running existent automated tests if that is enough for a certain code change.\n\nTesters are granted the same privileges as Maintainers, and are also invited to become\na member of the Kiali organization. This is in good faith of not performing tasks of a\nMaintainer.\n\nTesters do not need to be Maintainers. Also, Maintainers do not need to be Testers. Yet,\nboth roles aren't mutually exclusive.\n\nCurrent list of testers (alphabetically ordered):\n\n- [FilipB](https://github.com/FilipB)\n- [matejnesuta](https://github.com/matejnesuta)\n- [mkralik3](https://github.com/mkralik3)\n- [pbajjuri20](https://github.com/pbajjuri20)\n- [prachiyadav](https://github.com/prachiyadav)\n- [ScriptingShrimp](https://github.com/ScriptingShrimp)\n\n### Becoming a Tester\n\nTo become a Tester you need to:\n\n- actively participate in testing code changes of the Kiali project\n  - testing pull requests for 3 months or more,\n  - find 5 non trivial defects in Kiali,\n  - occassionally, do testing over `master` branches to find broken features\n- ability to collaborate with the team,\n- ability to document testing procedures of Kiali features and to update existing documentation if features change,\n- understanding of team policies and processes.\n\nYou can propose yourself to apply for the Tester role, or a Maintainer can do it for you.\nProposals must be posted by opening a pull request\nmodifying the testers list to add the new proposed tester, or via\na [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/kiali/kiali/discussions/new) under the\nGovernance category. The following information must be provided:\n\n- nominee's GitHub username\n- a list of pull requests (top 5) tested by the nominee.\n- a list of documented test cases (if any)\n\nFormalization of the Tester role is granted if a simple majority vote\namong current maintainers succeeds.\n\n## Leaders\n\nKiali leaders are Maintainers who have a broad knowledge about the Kiali project, its goals and vision.\nThey may also be aware on how the ecosystem related to Kiali is evolving, and may also be aware of related projects.\nThus, they are able to guide and mentor other Maintainers, give direction, and set priorities to the Kiali project.\n\nCurrent list of leaders (alphabetically ordered):\n\n- [jshaughn](https://github.com/jshaughn)\n\n### Becoming a Leader\n\nTo become a Leader, you must first be a Maintainer. Then, a new Leader must be proposed\nby an existing Maintainer by opening a pull request modifying the leaders list to add the new\nproposed leader, or via a by opening a [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/kiali/kiali/discussions/new)\nunder the Governance category. The following information must be provided:\n\n- nominee's GitHub username,\n- an explanation of why the nominee should be a leader.\n\nLeadership is granted if a simple majority vote among current maintainers succeeds.\n\n## Inactivity\n\nIt is important for contributors to be and stay active to set an example and show commitment to the project. Inactivity is harmful to the project as it may lead to unexpected delays, contributor attrition, and a lost of trust in the project.\n\n- Inactivity is measured by:\n  - Periods of no contributions for longer than 4 months\n  - Periods of no communication for longer than 4 months\n- Consequences of being inactive include:\n  - Involuntary removal or demotion\n  - Being asked to move to Emeritus status\n\n## Involuntary Removal or Demotion\n\nInvoluntary removal/demotion of a contributor happens when requirements for a certain role aren't being met. This may include repeated patterns of inactivity, extended period of inactivity, a period of failing to meet the requirements of your role, and/or a violation of the Code of Conduct. This process is important because it protects the community and its deliverables while also opens up opportunities for new contributors to step in.\n\nInvoluntary removal or demotion is handled through a vote by simple majority of the current Maintainers.\n\n## Stepping Down/Emeritus Process\n\nIf and when contributors commitment levels change, contributors can consider stepping down (moving down the contributor ladder) vs moving to emeritus status (completely stepping away from the project).\n\nContact the Maintainers about changing to Emeritus status, or reducing your contributor level.\n\n### Emeritus contributors\n\n- [abonas](https://github.com/abonas)\n- [beaumorley](https://github.com/beaumorley)\n- [burmanm](https://github.com/burmanm)\n- [cfcosta](https://github.com/cfcosta)\n- [gbaufake](https://github.com/gbaufake)\n- [israel-hdez](https://github.com/israel-hdez)\n- [josejulio](https://github.com/josejulio)\n- [jotak](https://github.com/jotak)\n- [jstickler](https://github.com/JStickler)\n- [jpkrohling](https://github.com/jpkrohling)\n- [kevinearls](https://github.com/kevinearls)\n- [lucasponce](https://github.com/lucasponce)\n- [lwrigh](https://github.com/lwrigh)\n- [maltron](https://github.com/maltron)\n- [mattmahoneyrh](https://github.com/mattmahoneyrh)\n- [mtho11](https://github.com/mtho11)\n- [mwringe](https://github.com/mwringe)\n- [pavolloffay](https://github.com/pavolloffay)\n- [serenamarie125](https://github.com/serenamarie125)\n- [skondkar](https://github.com/skondkar)\n- [xeviknal](https://github.com/xeviknal)\n\n## Voting\n\nWhile most business in Kiali project is conducted by \"lazy consensus\", periodically\nthe Maintainers may need to vote on specific actions or changes.\nA vote can be taken on pull requests proposing project changes, or via a\n[a GitHub discussion](https://github.com/kiali/kiali/discussions/new).\nIf there are security or conduct matters, voting can take place in private meetings.\nAny Maintainer or Tester may demand a vote be taken.\n\nMost votes require a simple majority of all Maintainers to succeed. Changes\nto the Governance require a 2/3 vote of all Maintainers.\n\nKiali Testers also have a voice in voting although their vote is not mandatory.\n\nUnless some process specifies something different, once a vote starts Maintainers (and Testers)\nmust give their vote within 7 working days (U.S.)\n\n## Other Changes\n\nUnless specified above, all other changes to the project require a 2/3 majority vote.\nAdditionally, any maintainer or tester may request that any change require a 2/3 majority vote.\n"

Kiali can be quickly installed as an Istio add-on or integrated as a trusted component within a production environment.\n\n=== Table of contents\n\ntoc::[]\n\n=== Contributing\n\nFirst, check the link:https://kiali.io/community/[Community section on kiali.io], which provides a brief introduction on contributing, how to report issues and request features, and how to reach us.\n\nFor those interested in making code contributions, please also check the link:./CONTRIBUTING.md[Contribution Guide].\n\n=== Getting Started\n\nThe target audience of this README are developers. For those who are not developers but wish to learn more about Kiali, the link:https://kiali.io/docs[Kiali documentation] should be more helpful. For instructions on installing Kiali, please read the link:https://kiali.io/docs/installation/[Installation] page.\n\n=== How and where Kiali is released?\n\nRead the link:./RELEASING.adoc[RELEASING.adoc] file.\n\n== Developer setup\n\nEnsure the following tools are available:\n\n* The link:http://golang.org/doc/install[Go Programming Language]\n** Kiali releases are built with a specified minimum version of Go, as indicated in the link:https://github.com/kiali/kiali/blob/master/Makefile#L31[Makefile]. While Kiali may compile with other versions, using the version specified in the Makefile is recommended for consistent builds.\n* link:http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git[git]\n* gcc\n* link:https://docs.docker.com/installation/[Docker] or link:https://podman.io[Podman]\n** If using `podman`, set the environment variable `DORP=podman`.\n* link:https://nodejs.org[NodeJS] (Node.js >= 20 with the NPM command)\n* link:https://classic.yarnpkg.com/[Yarn]\n* The _GNU make_ (or a compatible alternative)\n\nOnce the required developer tools are available, the code can be obtained and built using the following script:\n\n[source,shell]\n----\n# Checkout the source code\nmkdir kiali_sources\ncd kiali_sources\nexport KIALI_SOURCES=$(pwd)\n\ngit clone https://github.com/kiali/kiali.git\ngit clone https://github.com/kiali/kiali-operator.git\ngit clone https://github.com/kiali/helm-charts.git\n\nln -s $KIALI_SOURCES/kiali-operator kiali/operator\n\n# Build the back-end and run the tests\ncd $KIALI_SOURCES/kiali\nmake build test\n\n# Go test flags can be passed via the GO_TEST_FLAGS environment variable.\n# make -e GO_TEST_FLAGS=\"-race -v -run=\\\"TestCanConnectToIstiodReachable\\\"\" test\n\n# Build the front-end and run the tests\nmake build-ui-test\n----\n\n[NOTE]\nThe rest of this README assumes the directory tree created by the previous commands:\n\n -- kiali_sources\n    |- kiali\n    |- kiali-operator\n    \\- helm-charts\n\n=== Create a Kubernetes cluster and install a Service Mesh\n\nTo use Kiali, a management console for Istio-based service meshes, an Istio-compatible service mesh is required. Istio meshes are installed on Kubernetes clusters.\n\nWe provide a few unsupported scripts that can help to get started. The scripts below are already in the Kiali Repository. Ensure that the correct path is being used to run the scripts without issues.\n\n\n* The link:hack/crc-openshift.sh[`crc-openshift.sh`] script allows creation of an OpenShift cluster on a local machine.\n* For those familiar with minikube, the link:hack/k8s-minikube.sh[`k8s-minikube.sh`] script can be used. This script includes an option to install Dex, which is helpful for testing with OpenID.\n* Alternatively, the link:hack/start-kind.sh[`start-kind.sh`] script can be used to create a single-node KinD cluster with MetalLB enabled, allowing Kiali to be tested in a real environment.\n* Finally, the link:hack/istio/install-istio-via-istioctl.sh[`install-istio-via-istioctl.sh`] and the link:hack/istio/install-bookinfo-demo.sh[`install-bookinfo-demo.sh`] scripts can assist in installing Istio and the Bookinfo sample application in the cluster, respectively. Trying to run these scripts without any arguments is also an option.\n\nThese scripts are written to rely on the minimum dependencies as possible and will try to download any required tools.\n\nBased on the type of cluster in use, define the `CLUSTER_TYPE` environment variable in the shell. Set it to `openshift` (default if not specified), `minikube` or `kind` so the Makefiles can assist with additional operations. For other cluster types, set  `CLUSTER_TYPE=local`.\n\n[NOTE]\nFor `minikube` it is recommended to enable the `registry` and `ingress` add-ons, which can be configured by the `k8s-minikube.sh` script.\n\n[NOTE]\nWhen using `docker` with Minikube's registry add-on or any custom non-secure registry, ensure the link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/insecure/[Docker daemon is properly configured to use your registry].\n\n=== Building the Container Image and deploying to a cluster\n\nAssuming the following conditions:\n\n* The back-end and front-end have been successfully built\n* A Kubernetes cluster with an Istio-based Service Mesh has been created\n* The `CLUSTER_TYPE=local` environment variable is not being used\n\nThe commands below will deploy a development build of Kiali to the cluster.\n\n[source,shell]\n----\ncd $KIALI_SOURCES/kiali\n\n# Build the Kiali-server and Kiali-operator container images and push them to the cluster\nmake cluster-push\n\n# To build and push only the Kiali-server container images:\n# make cluster-push-kiali\n\n# To build and push only the Kiali-operator container images:\n# make cluster-push-operator\n\n# Deploy the operator to the cluster\nmake operator-create\n\n# Create a KialCR to instruct the operator to deploy Kiali\nmake kiali-create\n----\n\nWhen using the `CLUSTER_TYPE=local` environment variable, additional environment variables must be declared to specify the container registry for pushing container images. The `make container-push*`  targets should be used instead of the `cluster-push*` targets. For example, if the container registry is `localhost:5000`:\n\n[source,shell]\n----\nexport QUAY_NAME=localhost:5000/kiali/kiali\nexport CONTAINER_NAME=localhost:5000/kiali/kiali\nexport OPERATOR_QUAY_NAME=localhost:5000/kiali/kiali-operator\nexport OPERATOR_CONTAINER_NAME=localhost:5000/kiali/kiali-operator\n\ncd $KIALI_SOURCES/kiali\n\n# Build the Kiali-server and Kiali-operator container images and push them to the cluster\nmake container-build container-push\n\n# To build and push only the Kiali-server container images:\n# make container-build-kiali container-push-kiali-quay\n\n# To build and push only the Kiali-operator container images:\n# make container-build-operator container-push-operator-quay\n\n# Deploy the operator to the cluster\nmake operator-create\n\n# Create a KialCR to instruct the operator to deploy Kiali\nmake kiali-create\n----\n\n=== Reloading Kiali image\n\nIf Kiali is already installed and there is a need to recreate the Kiali server pod, the following command can be run:\n\n[source,shell]\n----\ncd $KIALI_SOURCES/kiali\nmake kiali-reload-image\n----\n\nThis is intended to facilitate development. To quickly build a new Kiali container image and load it to the cluster, run the following command:\n\n[source,shell]\n----\ncd $KIALI_SOURCES/kiali/frontend\nyarn && yarn build\n\ncd $KIALI_SOURCES/kiali\nmake clean build cluster-push-kiali kiali-reload-image\n----\n\n[NOTE]\nNo equivalent reload command exists for the operator. The operator must be manually reloaded using `kubectl` or `oc` commands.\n\n=== Cluster clean-up\n\n[source,shell]\n----\ncd $KIALI_SOURCES/kiali\n\n# Delete the Kiali CR to let the operator remove Kiali.\nmake kiali-delete\n\n# If the previous command fails to complete, the following command forces removal by bypassing the operator\n# make kiali-purge\n\n# Remove the operator\n# NOTE: After this is completed, the `kiali-create` and `kiali-delete` targets will be ineffective\n# Until the `operator-create` target is run to re-deploy the Kiali operator, execute the following command to delete the operator:\nmake operator-delete\n----\n\n=== Code formatting and linting\n\nWhen changing the back-end code of Kiali, ensure that the changes are properly formatted and no new linting issues are introduced before submitting a pull request by running:\n\n[source,shell]\n----\n# CD to the back-end source code\ncd $KIALI_SOURCES/kiali\n\n# Install linting tools\nmake lint-install\n\n# Format the code and run linters\nmake format lint\n----\n\n=== Enable tracing\n\nKiali itself is instrumented with opentelemetry tracing to help provide insights and surface performance issues for the kiali server. To enable, set the `server.observability.tracing.enabled` and `server.observability.tracing.collector_url` configuration options.\n\n[source,yaml]\n----\napiVersion: kiali.io/v1alpha1\nkind: Kiali\nmetadata:\n  name: kiali\nspec:\n...\n  server:\n    observability:\n      tracing:\n        collector_url: http://jaeger-collector.istio-system:14268/api/traces\n        enabled: true\n...\n----\n\n=== Running Standalone\n\nFor debugging purposes, running Kiali outside of a cluster environment may be desired. To do this, use the link:./hack/run-kiali.sh[run-kiali.sh] script in the\nlink:./hack[hack] directory. Check the `--help` output for available options.\nBy default, the script uses the configuration template file located in the same directory it uses, and can be found in the link:./hack/run-kiali-config-template.yaml[config template file]\nalso located in the `hack` directory. For additional information, refer to the comments at the top of both files.\n\n\n[source,shell]\n----\ncd $KIALI_SOURCES/kiali/hack\n./run-kiali.sh\n----\n\n=== Running integration tests\n\nThere are two sets of integration tests. The first are backend tests that test the Kiali API directly. These can be found at link:./tests/integration/README.md[backend tests]. The second are frontend Cypress tests that test Kiali through the browser. These can be found at link:./frontend/cypress/README.md[frontend tests].\n\nBoth tests are executed as part of the CI pipeline. To run these tests locally, link:./hack/run-integration-tests.sh[the script] can be used to setup a local environment and execute the integration tests. Alternatively, the tests can be run against any live environment that meets the following requirements.\n\n\nRequirements:\n- Istio\n- Kiali\n- bookinfo demo app\n- error rates demo app\n\nlink:./hack/istio/install-testing-demos.sh[This script] can be used install all necessary demo applications for testing and supports deployments on both Openshift and non-Openshift enviroments.\n\n[source,shell]\n----\n# For frontend development, start the frontend development server, where `<kiali-url>` is the URL to the base Kiali UI location, such as `http://localhost:20001/kiali`:\nmake -e YARN_START_URL=http://<kiali-url> yarn-start\n\n# Start the cypress tests. The tests will run against the frontend development server by default.\n# Alternatively, a custom URL can be provided using environment variables:\n#\n# make -e CYPRESS_BASE_URL=http://<kiali-url> cypress-gui\nmake cypress-gui\n----\n\nNote that `make cypress-gui` runs the Cypress GUI, enabling the selection of individual tests to run. To execute the entire test suite in headless mode, use the `cypress-run` target instead.\n\n=== Debugging Server Backend\n\n==== VisualStudio Code\n\nFor VisualStudio Code, install the following `launcher.json` to launch the Kiali Server in the debugger. First, run the `hack/run-kiali.sh` script first to ensure that required services, such as Prometheus port-forward proxy, are running.\n\n[source,json]\n----\n{\n    // To use this, first run \"hack/run-kiali.sh --tmp-root-dir $HOME/tmp --enable-server false\"\n    // Pass in --help to that hack script for details on more options.\n    \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n    \"configurations\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Launch Kiali to use hack script services\",\n            \"type\": \"go\",\n            \"request\": \"launch\",\n            \"mode\": \"debug\",\n            \"program\": \"${workspaceRoot}/kiali.go\",\n            \"cwd\": \"${env:HOME}/tmp/run-kiali\",\n            \"args\": [\"-config\", \"${env:HOME}/tmp/run-kiali/run-kiali-config.yaml\"],\n            \"env\": {\n                \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST\": \"127.0.0.1\",\n                \"KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT\": \"8001\",\n                \"LOG_LEVEL\": \"trace\"\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}\n----\n\n=== Debugging GUI Frontend\n\nThe Kiali GUI can be debugged directly in Google Chrome using Chrome Developer Tools or within Visual Studio Code.\n\nTo use either, some initial steps are required.\n\nFirst, start the Kiali Server backend, either within a cluster or by using the `run-kiali.sh` script as previously explained. Before proceeding, determine the Kiali URL. For example, when Kiali is run in Minikube with a port-forward set up to expose it, the URL to note will be`http://localhost:20001/kiali`.\n\nNext, run the GUI frontend using the following command: `make -e YARN_START_URL=<kiali-url> yarn-start` where `<kiali-url>` is the URL determined in the previous step. Additionally, if needed, pass `-e PORT=3001` to override the default port `3000`, which may conflict with Grafana if the Kiali Server was started using  `run-kiali.sh`. Some examples:\n\n* If the Kiali Server is running in minikube with a port-forward exposing it, then run `make -e YARN_START_URL=http://localhost:20001/kiali yarn-start`.\n* If the Kiali Server is running in OpenShift with the usual Kiali Route exposing it, then run `make -e YARN_START_URL=https://<Kiali-OpenShift-Route-IP>/ yarn-start`.\n* If the Kiali Server is running locally via `run-kiali.sh`, then run `make -e YARN_START_URL=http://localhost:20001/kiali -e PORT=3001 yarn-start`.\n\nThe `yarn-start` make command will start the Kiali GUI frontend on a local endpoint. Once ready, check the output for the \"Local\" URL to access it. The output will resemble the following:\n\n```\nCompiled successfully!\n\nThe @kiali/kiali-ui can now be viewed in the browser.\n\n  Local:            http://localhost:3001\n  On Your Network:  http://192.168.1.15:3001\n...\n```\n\nAt this point, the debugger tool of choice can be set up - refer to the following sections for details.\n\n==== Google Chrome Developer Tools\n\nStart Google Chrome and point the browser to the local URL for the Kiali GUI frontend started by yarn-start (in the example above, that will be `http://localhost:3001`).\n\nIn Google Chrome, open the Developer Tools. Press `F12` or `Control-Shift-I` to do this.\n\nWithin the Developer Tools, navigate to the `Sources` tab, then the `Filesystem` sub-tab, and press the `+ Add folder to workspace` link. In the file selection dialog, select the Kiali `frontend/src` folder. This will inform Developer Tools where the Kiali GUI frontend source code can be found.\n\nAt this point, Google Chrome requires permission to access the local source code folder. A prompt will appear at the top of the browser window - click the \"Allow\" button to grant Chrome the necessary permissions.\n\nThe Kiali Server frontend is now ready for debugging. Breakpoints can be set, variables inspected, stack traces examined, and other typical debugging actions can be performed.\n==== VisualStudio Code\n\nFor VisualStudio Code, the following `launcher.json` can be installed to launch Google Chrome for debugging the Kiali Server GUI frontend. The `url`  setting should correspond to the local URL of the yarn-start server - ensuring the correct URL is used for the specific environment.\n\n\n[source,json]\n----\n{\n    \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n    \"configurations\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Launch Chrome\",\n            \"type\": \"chrome\",\n            \"request\": \"launch\",\n            \"url\": \"http://localhost:3001\",\n            \"webRoot\": \"${workspaceFolder}\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n----\n\n== Configuration\n\nMany configuration settings can optionally be set within the Kiali Operator custom resource (CR) file. See link:https://github.com/kiali/kiali-operator/blob/master/deploy/kiali/kiali_cr.yaml[this example Kiali CR file] that has all the configuration settings documented.\n\n== Embedding Kiali\n\nTo embed Kiali in other applications, Kiali provides a feature called _Kiosk mode_. In this mode, the main header and navigation bar are not displayed.\n\nTo enable Kiosk mode, simply add a `kiosk=<platform_id>` URL parameter. The full path of the page to be embedded must be used. For example, if Kiali is accessed via HTTPS:\n\n* To embed the _Overview_ page, use `https://_kiali_path_/overview?kiosk=console`.\n* To embed the _Graph_ page, use `https://_kiali_path_/graph/namespaces?kiosk=console`.\n* To embed the _Applications list_ page, use `https://_kiali_path_/applications?kiosk=console`.\n\nIf the page to be embedded includes other URL arguments, any of them can be specified to preset options. For example, to embed the graph of the _bookinfo_ namespace, use the following URL: `http://_kiali_path_/graph/namespaces?namespaces=bookinfo&kiosk=console`.\n\n`<platform_id>` value in the `kiosk` URL parameter will be used in future use cases to add conditional logic on embedded use cases, for now, any non empty value will enable the kiosk mode.\n\n== Configure External Services\n\n=== Grafana\n\nIf Grafana is installed in a custom manner that Kiali cannot automatically detect, the value of grafana > url in the Kiali CR must be updated.\n\n[source,yaml]\n----\napiVersion: kiali.io/v1alpha1\nkind: Kiali\nmetadata:\n  name: kiali\nspec:\n...\n    external_services:\n      grafana:\n        url: http://grafana-istio-system.127.0.0.1.nip.io\n...\n----\n\n== Additional Notes\n\n=== Frontend development guidelines\n\nFrontend development guidelines (styles, i18n, etc.) can be found link:./frontend/README.adoc#developing[here]\n\n=== Upgrading Go\n\nThe Kiali project will periodically upgrade to a newer version of Go. These are the steps that need to be performed in order for the Kiali build to use a different version of Go:\n\n1. Run `go mod edit -go=x.y` where \"x\" and \"y\" are the major/minor versions of the Go version being used.\n2. Run `go mod tidy -v`\n3. Run `make clean build build-ui test` to ensure everything builds correctly. If any problems occur, fix them.\n4. Commit the changes to the working branch, create a PR, and make sure everything builds and works before merging the PR.\n\nThe Makefile and some Github Actions will check the go version from the go.mod file.\n\n=== Procedure to check and update patternfly versions\n\n1. Launch command `npx npm-check-updates -t latest -f '/^@patternfly/'`\n2. Launch `yarn install` to update the yarn.lock\n3. Add to the commit package.json and yarn.lock\n\n=== Running the UI outside the cluster\n\nWhen developing the http://github.com/kiali/kiali/frontend[Kiali UI] running it outside of the cluster can be helpful for easily updating the UI code and viewing changes without needing to re-deploy. The preferred method for this is to use React's _proxy_ feature, as outlined https://github.com/kiali/kiali/blob/master/frontend/README.adoc#developing[here]. Alternatively, the `make -e YARN_START_URL=<url> yarn-start` command can be used, where `<url>` points to the Kiali backend.\n\n=== Disabling SSL\n\nIn the provided OpenShift templates, SSL is enabled by default. To disable it, the following steps should be taken:\n\n* Remove the \"tls: termination: reencrypt\" option from the Kiali route\n\n* Remove the \"identity\" block, with certificate paths, from the Kiali Config Map.\n\n* Optionally, the annotation \"service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name\" can be removed from the Kiali Service, along with the related `kiali-cabundle` volume declared and mounted in Kiali Deployment. However, if not removed, these will simply be ignored.\n\n== Exposing Kiali to External Clients Using Istio Gateway\n\nThe operator will create a Route or Ingress by default (see the Kiali CR setting \"deployment.ingress_enabled\"). To expose Kiali via Istio, Gateway, Virtual Service, and Destination Rule resources can be created, as shown below:\n\n[source,yaml]\n----\n---\napiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1\nkind: Gateway\nmetadata:\n  name: kiali-gateway\n  namespace: istio-system\nspec:\n  selector:\n    istio: ingressgateway\n  servers:\n  - port:\n      number: 80\n      name: http-kiali\n      protocol: HTTP\n    # https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/gateway/#ServerTLSSettings\n    tls:\n      httpsRedirect: false\n    hosts: [<your-host>]\n  - port:\n      number: 443\n      name: https-kiali\n      protocol: HTTPS\n    tls: {}\n    hosts: [<your-host>]\n...\n---\napiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1\nkind: VirtualService\nmetadata:\n  name: kiali-virtualservice\n  namespace: istio-system\nspec:\n  gateways:\n  - kiali-gateway\n  hosts: [<your-host>]\n  http:\n  - route:\n    - destination:\n        host: kiali.istio-system.svc.cluster.local\n        port:\n          number: 20001\n      weight: 100\n...\n---\napiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1\nkind: DestinationRule\nmetadata:\n  name: kiali-destinationrule\n  namespace: istio-system\nspec:\n  host: kiali\n  trafficPolicy:\n    tls:\n      mode: DISABLE\n...\n----\n\n== Experimental\n\n=== Observing a Remote Cluster\n\n[NOTE]\nThe \"Central IstioD\" setup is currently named \"Primary-remote\" multi-cluster setup.\n\n[WARNING]\nWhen this support was incorporated into Kiali, the \"Central IstioD\" setup of Istio was in an early development phase. These instructions are probably now broken.\n\nThere are certain use cases where Kiali needs to be deployed in one cluster (Control Plane) and observe a different cluster (Data Plane). \nimage:https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6889074/87819080-ad099980-c839-11ea-834b-56eec038ce4d.png[Diagram]\n\nFollow these steps:\n\n1: Have the link:https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/external-controlplane[Istio with an External Control Plane] setup running\n\n2: Create the link:https://github.com/istio/istio/blob/master/samples/addons/kiali.yaml[Kiali ClusterRole, ClusterRoleBinding, and ServiceAccount] in the Data Plane cluster\n\n3: Create a remote secret in the Control Plane, using the Data Plane ServiceAccount that was just created. This allows the Control Plane to read from and modify the Data Plane\n[source,shell]\n----\nistioctl create-remote-secret --service-account kiali-service-account --context=$DataPlane --name kiali | kubectl apply -n istio-system --context=$ControlPlane -f -\n----\n\n4: Kiali will now run in the Control Plane. The remote secret must be added to the Kiali Deployment by specifying a Volume and VolumeMount. When Kiali detects */kiali-remote-secret/kiali* it will use the remote cluster's API server instead of the local API server\n[source,yaml]\n----\nspec:\n  template:\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - volumeMounts:\n        - mountPath: /kiali-remote-secret\n          name: kiali-remote-secret\n      volumes:\n      - name: kiali-remote-secret\n        secret:\n          defaultMode: 420\n          optional: true\n          secretName: istio-remote-secret-kiali\n----\n\n5: Kiali now requires Istio metrics from the sidecars. Prometheus must be run in the Control Plane and configured to scrape the metrics from an link:https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/istio.mesh.v1alpha1/#ProxyConfig[envoyMetricsService]. These link:https://kiali.io/docs/faq/general/#which-istio-metrics-and-attributes-are-required-by-kiali[metrics] are *required*.\n\n6: Kiali in the Control Plane should now be fully functional with the Data Plane\n"

          "content": "# Releasing Kiali\n\nKiali releases a minor version every 3 weeks and eventually, if required, patch releases (z-stream) are also released.\n\nThe artifacts that are released are the following:\n\n* The Kiali server container image, which is published to the [Kiali Quay.io repository](https://quay.io/repository/kiali/kiali?tab=tags)\n* The Kiali operator container image, which is published to the [Kiali operator Quay.io repository](https://quay.io/repository/kiali/kiali-operator?tab=tags)\n* The OpenShift Service Mesh Console (OSSMC) plugin image, which is published to the [OSSMC Quay.io repository](https://quay.io/repository/kiali/ossmconsole?tab=tags)\n* Helm charts for deploying the Kiali operator or the Kiali server via the Helm CLI, published to https://kiali.org/helm-charts/\n* The website that is published on https://kiali.io\n\nTags and branches are also created in the Kiali's GitHub repositories, as a reference for rebuilds (if needed) or as a base for z-stream releases.\n\n## Troubleshooting (WIP)\n\nFor troubleshooting, take a look to the following [documentation](./.github/troubleshooting.md).\n\n## How releases are generated?\n\nThe releases are generated by GitHub Actions pipelines. These pipelines run on every Kiali repository generating the artifacts previously mentioned:\n\n* [kiali](https://github.com/kiali/kiali/actions/workflows/release.yml)\n* [kiali-operator](https://github.com/kiali/kiali-operator/actions/workflows/release.yml)\n* [openshift-servicemesh-plugin](https://github.com/kiali/openshift-servicemesh-plugin/actions/workflows/release.yaml)\n* [helm-charts](https://github.com/kiali/helm-charts/actions/workflows/release.yml)\n* [kiali.io](https://github.com/kiali/kiali.io/actions/workflows/release.yaml)\n\nThe pipelines are scheduled to run on every Monday detecting if a released is needed (on every Sprint ending a release will be generated). Also, they can be started manually filling some parameters required by the pipeline (release type, branch name and image name).\n\n## Generating a release locally (without automation)\n\nAlthough it is not recommended, in case of any issue with GitHub Actions, following the steps that the releases pipelines are executing should be enough to generate a release.\n\nAs prerequisites, the user would require:\n\n* Credentials with permissions to push images on the Kiali organization in Quay.io\n* Credentials with permissions to administrate the Kiali GitHub repositories\n\n## Release pipelines design\n\nThe following is an example of the anatomy of a release pipeline:\n\n```\nname: Release\n\non:\n\n  schedule:  \n  - cron: '00 7 * * MON'\n\n  workflow_dispatch:\n    inputs:\n      release_type:\n        description: Release type\n        required: true\n        default: \"auto\"\n        type: choice\n        options:\n        - minor\n        - patch\n      release_branch:\n        description: Branch to release\n        required: true\n        default: master\n        type: string\n      quay_repository:\n        description: Quay repository\n        type: string\n        default: quay.io/kiali/kiali\n        required: true\n\njobs:\n  initialize:\n    name: Initialize\n    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04\n    outputs:\n      target_branch: ${{ github.ref_name }}\n      release_type: ${{ steps.release_type.outputs.release_type }}\n      release_version: ${{ steps.release_version.outputs.release_version }}\n      branch_version: ${{ steps.branch_version.outputs.branch_version }}\n      next_version: ${{ steps.next_version.outputs.next_version }}\n      quay_tag: ${{ steps.quay_tag.outputs.quay_tag }}\n    steps:    \n    \n    ...\n    \n    - name: Log information\n      run: |\n        echo \"Release type: ${{ steps.release_type.outputs.release_type }}\"\n\n        echo \"Release version: ${{ steps.release_version.outputs.release_version }}\"\n\n        echo \"Next version: ${{ steps.next_version.outputs.next_version }}\"\n\n        echo \"Branch version: ${{ steps.branch_version.outputs.branch_version }}\"\n\n        echo \"Quay tag\": ${{ steps.quay_tag.outputs.quay_tag }}\n\n  ...\n\n  release:\n    name: Release\n    if: ${{ needs.initialize.outputs.release_type != 'skip' && ((github.event_name == 'schedule' && github.repository == 'kiali/kiali') || github.event_name != 'schedule') }}\n    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04\n    needs: [initialize, build_backend, build_frontend, integration_tests_backend, integration_tests_frontend]\n    env:  \n      RELEASE_VERSION: ${{ needs.initialize.outputs.release_version }}\n      BRANCH_VERSION: ${{ needs.initialize.outputs.branch_version }}\n      NEXT_VERSION: ${{ needs.initialize.outputs.next_version }}\n      RELEASE_BRANCH: ${{ github.event.inputs.release_branch || github.ref_name }} \n      QUAY_TAG: ${{ needs.initialize.outputs.quay_tag }}\n    steps:\n    \n    ...\n\n```\n\nBy design, the release pipelines can be triggered manually and also are scheduled to trigger on every Monday.\n\nWhen triggering manually, some parameters will be required, these are the inputs to the pipeline and every pipeline declares default values.\n\nWhen the pipeline is triggered automatically, it will detect if it needs to publish the release or not.\n\nNote: In the past, we ran the release pipeline every Monday using a cron job, then the snapshots or the minor release were created. It is the same with these new pipelines - we need to run the job every Monday (the GitHub Actions cron does not support running, for example, every 3 weeks). But we have now removed the building/releasing of weekly snapshots. Because weekly snapshots are no longer released, there is not much to do the first two weeks of our sprint (the pipeline will simply skip doing any release those first two weeks). On the third week of the sprint, the cron will fire on Monday, and at that time it will create a minor release.\n\nEach pipeline can have several jobs, and it will depend on the application, but there are common jobs that will be present on all the release pipelines:\n\n#### Initialize\n\nThis job is used to gather the inputs, and use them to produce outputs for the pipeline to use, for example:\n\n* Release type\n* Release version\n* Next version\n* Quay tag\n\nThis job also logs the variables to facilitate the troubleshooting of a pipeline.\n\n#### Release\n\nThis job is used to generate all the required actions and assets to generate the release.\n\nThis job will use some secrets to:\n\n* Create branches, tags and releases on the GitHub repository\n    * GH_TOKEN\n* Push images to the Quay repository\n    * QUAY_USER\n    * QUAY_PASSWORD\n\n\n"

          "content": "= Code Style Guide\n:toc: macro\n:toc-title:\n\ntoc::[]\n\n== Backend - Go\n\nThe backend is written in link:https://golang.org/[Go]. If you are not familiar with it, you can take link:https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1[a Tour of Go].\n\nIn Kiali we use link:https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/[gofmt] as part of our build process to keep a consistent formatting.\n\nWhile we haven't automated static code analysers, it is still a good idea to check that new pieces of code are correct with tools such as link:https://github.com/golang/lint[golint] or link:https://golang.org/cmd/vet/[govet].\n\n=== Imports\n\nIf you need any library you should import them in the following format\n\n----\n<standard imports>\nLINE\n<third party imports>\nLINE\n<kiali imports>\n----\n\nExample:\n\n[source,go]\n----\nimport (\n\t\"errors\"\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"time\"\n\n\t\"k8s.io/client-go/tools/clientcmd/api\"\n\n\t\"github.com/kiali/kiali/log\"\n)\n----\n\n== Frontend - TypeScript\n\n=== Default conventions\n\nBy default, we try to follow community conventions. link:https://github.com/basarat/typescript-book/blob/master/docs/styleguide/styleguide.md[Basarat's Style Guide] is used as a reference, with a few exceptions that are listed below:\n\n==== File names\n\nMost files are named after the main type / class / interface it's exporting. For instance, `ServiceList.ts` is named after the `ServiceList` interface that it's exporting. Which means that, unlike in Basarat's guide, we often use `PascalCase`.\n\nFiles with more general purpose, or the ones that don't export types or such, are `camelCase` (ex: `routes.ts`).\n\n==== Variables, functions, constants\n\nWe mostly follow Basarat's guide, so `camelCase`. Exceptions are:\n\n- Redux actions, which are technically constants, are `PascalCase` (ex: `GraphActions`).\n- We sometimes make a difference between constants of global scopes versus constants of local scopes. You may find the former written in `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (ex: `const TIMER_REQUEST_PER_SECOND_MIN = 0;`), whereas Basarat's guide makes no distinction between different kinds of constants, all of them being `camelCase`.\n\n==== Enum\n\nEnum names follow Basarat's guide, but not the values: they are `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`. Example:\n\n[source,typescript]\n----\nenum DisplayMode {\n  LARGE,\n  SMALL\n}\n----\n\n=== Handlers\n\nUse consistent naming for events and event handlers: name the handler methods after their triggering event.\n\nEvent handlers should:\n\n* begin with handle\n* end with the name of the event they handle (eg, Click, Change)\n* be present-tense\n\nEvent names:\n\n* in props should start with on\n* should not clash with builtin/native event names, eg. use onSelect instead of onFocus or onClick\n\n=== Use arrow functions (fat arrow)\n\n[source,typescript]\n----\ncreateItem = () => {\n    return (\n      <ul>\n        {props.items.map((item, index) => (\n          <Item\n            key={item.key}\n            onClick={() => doSomethingWith(item.name, index)}\n          />\n        ))}\n      </ul>\n    );\n}\n----\n\n=== Redux\n\n==== Type-safe usage\n\nFor additional type safety in our Redux Actions/Reducers, we use the library:\nhttps://github.com/piotrwitek/typesafe-actions\nPlease refer to this site for instructions on how to use typescript with Redux.\n\n==== URL Consistency\n\nEvery application page should strive to have it's state in Redux so that\nwe have a reproducible application state contained in Redux.\nTo this end, we also want pages to be bookmarkable via URL. The URL and its\nparameters become the API for the page. And, the Redux application state should\nbe able to be mutated via the URL parameters. In order to support this, here are some\nof the rules needed:\n\n* On component construction let URL param values override any existing redux state values.\n* On component construction set (via replace) any unset URL params to reflect the redux state value. This gives us a full bookmark at all times.\n* After construction update URL (via replace) as necessary to reflect redux state changes. This is typically done in _componentDidUpdate_. This maintains the full bookmark.\n\n==== Redux props usage\n\nThe declaration of the properties of a component connected to Redux should clearly indicate whether each property comes from Redux or are strictly from the component.\nThis convention should help developers easily see which properties comes from the Redux state management without the need to be either versed with the whole Redux catalog or the component itself.\n\nThe convention is consist in:\n\n* Declaring a type `ReduxProps` which only contains the Redux properties, sorted alphabetically.\n* Declaring a type `<ClassName>Props` which only contains the properties from the component, sorted alphabetically.\n* Intersecting type `ReduxProps` into type `<ClassName>Props`.\n* Using `<ClassName>Props` type for the component declaration.\n\nSee an example:\n\n[source, typescript]\n----\ntype ReduxProps = {\n // just the Redux props, alphabetical\n};\n\ntype <ClassName>Props = ReduxProps & {\n // non-Redux props, alphabetical\n};\n\nclass <ClassName>Component extends React.Component<Props> {\n...\n}\n----\n"

The official title of the project is \"OpenShift Service Mesh Console\" but you may see this abbreviated in documentation and code as \"OSSMC\", \"ossmconsole\", or \"OSSM Console\".\n\nThe main component is a plugin based on OpenShift Console [Dynamic plugin-ins](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.13/web_console/dynamic-plugin/overview-dynamic-plugin.html) framework. Installing and enabling the plugin will add OpenShift Service Mesh support into the OpenShift Console. The new \"Service Mesh\" menu item and tabs allow you to interact with your mesh via the Kiali user interface. Note that OSSMC may also work with upstream Istio installed (as opposed to OpenShift Service Mesh).\n\nThe main installation mechanism is the Kiali Operator.\n\n## Platform Setup\n\nThese are the things you need before developers can start working with the OpenShift Service Mesh Console:\n\n1. OpenShift cluster with OpenShift ServiceMesh or Istio installed.\n2. Kiali Server deployed in the cluster\n3. `oc` client available in the path\n4. `podman` or `docker` client available in the path\n\n## Operator\n\nThe OpenShift Service Mesh Console will be installed by end users using the Kiali Operator. More details can be found in the [Install Guild](https://github.com/kiali/openshift-servicemesh-plugin/blob/main/docs/install-guide.md). Developers can use the make targets found in the kiali repo (see below).\n\n#### Quick Summary\n\nHere is a summary for developers on how to get the Kiali Operator, Kiali Server, and OSSMC installed in your OpenShift cluster.\n\n1. First run `make cluster-status` to expose the internal image registry and get the docker or podman command needed to log into the internal image registry.\n2. Run the podman or docker login command that will log into the internal image registry.\n3. Build and push the OSSMC plugin image. You must do this from within your local repo of https://github.com/kiali/openshift-servicemesh-plugin - so clone that repo locally, and from your clone's root directory on your local machine, run `make cluster-push` and that will do what needs to be done.\n4. Build, push, and deploy the operator, Kiali, and plugin by running `make cluster-push operator-create kiali-create ossmconsole-create`\n\nWhen you are finished and you want to uninstall the operator, Kiali, and plugin, run `make operator-delete`.\n"

For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same</br>namespace for a \"producer\" route, or the mesh implementation must support</br>and allow \"consumer\" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is</br>not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to</br>create a \"producer\" route for a Service in a different namespace from the</br>Route.</br></br>There are two kinds of parent resources with \"Core\" support:</br></br>Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)</br>Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)</br></br>This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent</br>resources.</br></br>ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:</br></br>They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef</br>entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the</br>multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must</br>be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.</br>They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,</br>each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of</br>optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a</br>combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.</br></br>Some examples:</br></br>If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the</br>same object must also set `sectionName`.</br>If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same</br>object must also set `port`.</br>If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs</br>referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.</br></br>It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may</br>be collapsed by an implementation.

(This section uses \"set of Listeners\" rather than</br>\"Listeners in a single Gateway\" because implementations MAY merge configuration</br>from multiple Gateways onto a single data plane, and these rules _also_</br>apply in that case).</br></br>Practically, this means that each listener in a set MUST have a unique</br>combination of Port, Protocol, and, if supported by the protocol, Hostname.</br></br>Some combinations of port, protocol, and TLS settings are considered</br>Core support and MUST be supported by implementations based on their</br>targeted conformance profile:</br></br>HTTP Profile</br></br>1. HTTPRoute, Port: 80, Protocol: HTTP</br>2. HTTPRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: HTTPS, TLS Mode: Terminate, TLS keypair provided</br></br>TLS Profile</br></br>1. TLSRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: TLS, TLS Mode: Passthrough</br></br>\"Distinct\" Listeners have the following property:</br></br>The implementation can match inbound requests to a single distinct</br>Listener. When multiple Listeners share values for fields (for</br>example, two Listeners with the same Port value), the implementation</br>can match requests to only one of the Listeners using other</br>Listener fields.</br></br>For example, the following Listener scenarios are distinct:</br></br>1. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that all use the \"HTTP\"</br>Protocol that all have unique Hostname values.</br>2. Multiple Listeners with the same Port that use either the \"HTTPS\" or</br>\"TLS\" Protocol that all have unique Hostname values.</br>3. A mixture of \"TCP\" and \"UDP\" Protocol Listeners, where no Listener</br>with the same Protocol has the same Port value.</br></br>Some fields in the Listener struct have possible values that affect</br>whether the Listener is distinct. Hostname is particularly relevant</br>for HTTP or HTTPS protocols.</br></br>When using the Hostname value to select between same-Port, same-Protocol</br>Listeners, the Hostname value must be different on each Listener for the</br>Listener to be distinct.</br></br>When the Listeners are distinct based on Hostname, inbound request</br>hostnames MUST match from the most specific to least specific Hostname</br>values to choose the correct Listener and its associated set of Routes.</br></br>Exact matches must be processed before wildcard matches, and wildcard</br>matches must be processed before fallback (empty Hostname value)</br>matches. For example, `\"foo.example.com\"` takes precedence over</br>`\"*.example.com\"`, and `\"*.example.com\"` takes precedence over `\"\"`.</br></br>Additionally, if there are multiple wildcard entries, more specific</br>wildcard entries must be processed before less specific wildcard entries.</br>For example, `\"*.foo.example.com\"` takes precedence over `\"*.example.com\"`.</br>The precise definition here is that the higher the number of dots in the</br>hostname to the right of the wildcard character, the higher the precedence.</br></br>The wildcard character will match any number of characters _and dots_ to</br>the left, however, so `\"*.example.com\"` will match both</br>`\"foo.bar.example.com\"` _and_ `\"bar.example.com\"`.</br></br>If a set of Listeners contains Listeners that are not distinct, then those</br>Listeners are Conflicted, and the implementation MUST set the \"Conflicted\"</br>condition in the Listener Status to \"True\".</br></br>Implementations MAY choose to accept a Gateway with some Conflicted</br>Listeners only if they only accept the partial Listener set that contains</br>no Conflicted Listeners. To put this another way, implementations may</br>accept a partial Listener set only if they throw out *all* the conflicting</br>Listeners. No picking one of the conflicting listeners as the winner.</br>This also means that the Gateway must have at least one non-conflicting</br>Listener in this case, otherwise it violates the requirement that at</br>least one Listener must be present.</br></br>The implementation MUST set a \"ListenersNotValid\" condition on the</br>Gateway Status when the Gateway contains Conflicted Listeners whether or</br>not they accept the Gateway. That Condition SHOULD clearly</br>indicate in the Message which Listeners are conflicted, and which are</br>Accepted. Additionally, the Listener status for those listeners SHOULD</br>indicate which Listeners are conflicted and not Accepted.</br></br>A Gateway's Listeners are considered \"compatible\" if:</br></br>1. They are distinct.</br>2. The implementation can serve them in compliance with the Addresses</br>requirement that all Listeners are available on all assigned</br>addresses.</br></br>Compatible combinations in Extended support are expected to vary across</br>implementations. A combination that is compatible for one implementation</br>may not be compatible for another.</br></br>For example, an implementation that cannot serve both TCP and UDP listeners</br>on the same address, or cannot mix HTTPS and generic TLS listens on the same port</br>would not consider those cases compatible, even though they are distinct.</br></br>Note that requests SHOULD match at most one Listener. For example, if</br>Listeners are defined for \"foo.example.com\" and \"*.example.com\", a</br>request to \"foo.example.com\" SHOULD only be routed using routes attached</br>to the \"foo.example.com\" Listener (and not the \"*.example.com\" Listener).</br>This concept is known as \"Listener Isolation\". Implementations that do</br>not support Listener Isolation MUST clearly document this.</br></br>Implementations MAY merge separate Gateways onto a single set of</br>Addresses if all Listeners across all Gateways are compatible.</br></br>Support: Core</br></br>+listType=map</br>+listMapKey=name</br>+kubebuilder:validation:MinItems=1</br>+kubebuilder:validation:MaxItems=64</br>+kubebuilder:validation:XValidation:message=\"tls must not be specified for protocols ['HTTP', 'TCP', 'UDP']\",rule=\"self.all(l, l.protocol in ['HTTP', 'TCP', 'UDP'] ? !has(l.tls) : true)\"</br>+kubebuilder:validation:XValidation:message=\"tls mode must be Terminate for protocol HTTPS\",rule=\"self.all(l, (l.protocol == 'HTTPS' && has(l.tls)) ?

Note that the referenced parent resource needs to</br>allow this for the attachment to be complete. For Gateways, that means</br>the Gateway needs to allow attachment from Routes of this kind and</br>namespace. For Services, that means the Service must either be in the same</br>namespace for a \"producer\" route, or the mesh implementation must support</br>and allow \"consumer\" routes for the referenced Service. ReferenceGrant is</br>not applicable for governing ParentRefs to Services - it is not possible to</br>create a \"producer\" route for a Service in a different namespace from the</br>Route.</br></br>There are two kinds of parent resources with \"Core\" support:</br></br>Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)</br>Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)</br></br>This API may be extended in the future to support additional kinds of parent</br>resources.</br></br>ParentRefs must be _distinct_. This means either that:</br></br>They select different objects.  If this is the case, then parentRef</br>entries are distinct. In terms of fields, this means that the</br>multi-part key defined by `group`, `kind`, `namespace`, and `name` must</br>be unique across all parentRef entries in the Route.</br>They do not select different objects, but for each optional field used,</br>each ParentRef that selects the same object must set the same set of</br>optional fields to different values. If one ParentRef sets a</br>combination of optional fields, all must set the same combination.</br></br>Some examples:</br></br>If one ParentRef sets `sectionName`, all ParentRefs referencing the</br>same object must also set `sectionName`.</br>If one ParentRef sets `port`, all ParentRefs referencing the same</br>object must also set `port`.</br>If one ParentRef sets `sectionName` and `port`, all ParentRefs</br>referencing the same object must also set `sectionName` and `port`.</br></br>It is possible to separately reference multiple distinct objects that may</br>be collapsed by an implementation. For example, some implementations may</br>choose to merge compatible Gateway Listeners together. If that is the</br>case, the list of routes attached to those resources should also be</br>merged.</br></br>Note that for ParentRefs that cross namespace boundaries, there are specific</br>rules.

A prefix '@' is used to denote a match against internal metadata instead of the headers in the request.\nCurrently this feature is only supported for the following metadata:\n\n`request.auth.claims.{claim-name}[.{nested-claim}]*` which are extracted from validated JWT tokens.\nUse the `.` or `[]` as a separator for nested claim names.\nExamples: `request.auth.claims.sub`, `request.auth.claims.name.givenName` and `request.auth.claims[foo.com/name]`.\nFor more information, see [JWT claim based routing](https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/security/authentication/jwt-route/).\n\nThe use of matches against JWT claim metadata is only supported in Gateways. The following example shows:\n\nRequestAuthentication to decode and validate a JWT. This also makes the `@request.auth.claims` available for use in the VirtualService.\nAuthorizationPolicy to check for valid principals in the request.
