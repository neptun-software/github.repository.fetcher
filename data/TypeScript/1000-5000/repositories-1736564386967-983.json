It does this by giving you a browser in the cloud you can control remotely using Playwright or Puppeteer (in just a few lines), or Selenium (with some work).\n\nFinic is designed to be **unopionated about the development process**, and simply provide browser and network-level utilities to make sure your automations don't get blocked.\n\n# Quickstart\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/finic-ai/finic.git\n```\n\n## Running Locally\n\nRun the image locally the same as any other Docker container.\n\n```bash\nsudo docker-compose up --build\n```\n\nOnce the container is running, you can connect to it like this.\n\n```python\nCDP_URL = \"ws://localhost:8000/ws\"\n\nasync def main():\n    print(\"Connecting to Browser...\")\n    async with async_playwright() as pw:\n        browser = await pw.chromium.connect_over_cdp(CDP_URL)\n        try:\n            print(\"Connected! Navigating...\")\n            page = await browser.new_page()\n            await page.goto(\"https://example.com\", timeout=2 * 60 * 1000)\n            print(\"Navigated! Scraping page content...\")\n            html = await page.content()\n            print(html)\n        finally:\n            await browser.close()\n\nasyncio.run(main())\n```\n\nOr run `python testscript.py` to test out the container.\n\nIf you want to use a Finic browser with an existing project, simply replace this line:\n\n```python\nbrowser = playwright.chromium.launch(headless=False)\n```\n\nwith this one:\nwith this:\n\n```\nbrowser = playwright.chromium.connect_over_cdp(\"ws://localhost:8080/ws\")\n```\n"
