It is fully documented so that each piece of code that lands in your application can be understood and used.\n\n```\nIf you love this boilerplate, give us a star, you will be a ray of sunshine in our lives :)\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\nNode 18 or greater is required. Development for iOS requires a Mac and Xcode 10 or up, and will target iOS 11 and up.\n\nYou also need to install the dependencies required by React Native.\nGo to the [React Native environment setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup), then select `React Native CLI Quickstart` tab.\nFollow instructions for your given `development OS` and `target OS`.\n\n## Quick start\n\nTo create a new project using the boilerplate simply run :\n\n```\nnpx @react-native-community/cli@latest init MyApp --template @thecodingmachine/react-native-boilerplate\n```\n\nAssuming you have all the requirements installed, you can run the project by running:\n\n- `yarn start` to start the metro bundler, in a dedicated terminal\n- `yarn <platform>` to run the *platform* application (remember to start a simulator or connect a device)\n\n## Digging Deeper\n\nTo learn more about this boilerplate, go to [full documentation](https://thecodingmachine.github.io/react-native-boilerplate)\n\n## License\n\nThis project is released under the [MIT License](LICENSE).\n\n## About us\n\n[TheCodingMachine](https://www.thecodingmachine.com/) is a web and mobile agency based in Paris and Lyon, France. We are [constantly looking for new developers and team leaders](https://www.thecodingmachine.com/nous-rejoindre/) and we love [working with freelancers](https://coders.thecodingmachine.com/). You'll find [an overview of all our open source projects on our website](https://thecodingmachine.com/en/open-source-en/) and on [Github](https://github.com/thecodingmachine).\n"
