We use [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for E2E test, and [vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for unit test.\n\nTo test locally, please make sure browser binaries are already installed via `npx playwright install`. Then there are multi commands to choose from:\n\n```sh\n# run tests in headless mode in another terminal window\nyarn test\n\n# or run tests in headed mode for debugging\nyarn test -- --debug\n```\n\nIn headed mode, `await page.pause()` can be used in test cases to suspend the test runner. Note that the usage of the [Playwright VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-playwright.playwright) is also highly recommended.\n\nTo test browser compatibility, the `BROWSER` environment variable can be used:\n\n```sh\n# supports `firefox|webkit|chromium`\nBROWSER=firefox yarn test\n\n# passing playwright params with the -- syntax\nBROWSER=webkit yarn test -- --debug\n```\n\nTo investigate flaky tests, we can mark a test case as `test.only`, then perform `npx playwright test --repeat-each=10` to reproduce the problem by repeated execution. It's also very helpful to run `yarn test -- --debug` with `await page.pause()` added before certain asserters.\n\n### Test Collaboration\n\nTo test the real-time collaboration feature of BlockSuite locally, please follow these two simple steps:\n\n1. Open [localhost:5173/starter/?init&room=hello](http://localhost:5173/starter/?init&room=hello) in the first browser tab.\n2. Open [localhost:5173/starter/?room=hello](http://localhost:5173/starter/?room=hello) in a second tab.\n\nSee the [documentation](https://blocksuite.io/guide/data-synchronization.html#document-streaming) about what's happening under the hood.\n"

Distribution of Source Form\n\nAll distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\nModifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under\nthe terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\nCode Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\nLicense, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\nattempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\nForm.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\nForm, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\nthe Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\nForm by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\nthan the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\nLicense, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\nlicense for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\nthe recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3.

Any law or regulation which provides\nthat the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter\nshall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n\n10. Versions of the License\n\n---\n\n10.1. New Versions\n\nMozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section\n10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\npublish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a\ndistinguishing version number.\n\n10.2.

It implements a series of content editing infrastructures, UI components and editors independently.\n\nYou can consider BlockSuite as a [UI component library](https://blocksuite.io/components/overview.html) for building various editors, based on a minimized vanilla framework as their runtime. With BlockSuite, you can:\n\n- Reuse multiple first-party BlockSuite editors:\n  - [**`PageEditor`**](https://blocksuite.io/components/editors/page-editor.html): A comprehensive block-based document editor, offering extensive customization and flexibility.\n  - [**`EdgelessEditor`**](https://blocksuite.io/components/editors/edgeless-editor.html): A graphics editor with opt-in canvas rendering support, but also shares the same rich-text capabilities with the `PageEditor`.\n- Customize, extend and enhance these editors with a rich set of [BlockSuite components](https://blocksuite.io/components/overview.html) and [examples](./examples/). All BlockSuite components (including editors) are native web components, making them framework-agnostic and easy to interop with popular frameworks.\n- Or, build new editors from scratch based on the underlying vanilla framework.\n\n> 🚧 BlockSuite is currently in its early stage, with components and extension capabilities still under refinement. Hope you can stay tuned, try it out, or share your feedback!\n\n## Motivation\n\nBlockSuite originated from the [AFFiNE](https://github.com/toeverything/AFFiNE) knowledge base, with design goals including:\n\n- **Support for Multimodal Editable Content**: When considering knowledge as a single source of truth, building its various view modes (e.g., text, slides, mind maps, tables) still requires multiple incompatible frameworks. Ideally, no matter how the presentation of content changes, there should be a consistent framework that helps.\n- **Organizing and Visualizing Complex Knowledge**: Existing editors generally focus on editing single documents, but often fall short in dealing with complex structures involving intertwined references. This requires the framework to natively manage state across multiple documents.\n- **Collaboration-Ready**: Real-time collaboration is often seen as an optional plugin, but in reality, we could natively use the underlying CRDT technology for editor state management, which helps to build a [clearer and more reliable data flow](https://blocksuite.io/blog/crdt-native-data-flow.html).\n\nDuring the development of AFFiNE, it became clear that BlockSuite was advancing beyond merely being an in-house editor and evolving into a versatile framework. That's why we chose to open source and maintain BlockSuite independently.\n\n<!-- ## Examples -->\n\n## Features\n\nWith BlockSuite editors, you can selectively reuse all the editing features in [AFFiNE](https://affine.pro/):\n\n[![affine-demo](./packages/docs/images/affine-demo.jpg)](https://affine.pro)\n\nAnd under the hood, the vanilla BlockSuite framework supports:\n\n- Defining [custom blocks](https://blocksuite.io/guide/working-with-block-tree.html#defining-new-blocks) and inline embeds.\n- Incremental updates, [real-time collaboration](https://github.com/toeverything/blocksuite/blob/master/BUILDING.md#test-collaboration), and even decentralized data synchronization based on the [document streaming](https://blocksuite.io/guide/data-synchronization.html#document-streaming) mechanism of the document.\n- Writing type-safe complex editing logic based on the [command](https://blocksuite.io/guide/command.html) mechanism, similar to react hooks designed for document editing.\n- Persistence of documents and compatibility with various third-party formats (such as markdown and HTML) based on block [snapshot](https://blocksuite.io/guide/data-synchronization.html#snapshot-api) and transformer.\n- State scheduling across multiple documents and reusing one document in multiple editors.\n\nTo try out BlockSuite, refer to the [quick start](https://blocksuite.io/guide/quick-start.html) example and start with the preset editors in `@blocksuite/presets`.\n\n## Architecture\n\nThe relationship between BlockSuite and AFFiNE is similar to that between the [Monaco Editor](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor) and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), but with one major difference: BlockSuite is not automatically generated based on the AFFiNE codebase, but is maintained independently with a different tech stack — AFFiNE uses React while BlockSuite uses [web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components).\n\nThis difference has led BlockSuite to set clear boundaries based on a component-centric philosophy, ensuring:\n\n- Both AFFiNE and other projects should equally reuse and extend BlockSuite through components, without any privileges.\n- BlockSuite components can be easily reused regardless of whether you are using React or other frameworks.\n\nTo that end, the BlockSuite project is structured around key packages that are categorized into two groups: a headless [framework](https://github.com/toeverything/blocksuite/tree/master/packages/framework) and prebuilt editing components.\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <th colspan=\"2\">Framework</th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td><code>@blocksuite/store</code></td>\n    <td>Data layer for modeling collaborative document states. It is natively built on the CRDT library <a href=\"https://github.com/yjs/yjs\">Yjs</a>, powering all BlockSuite documents with built-in real-time collaboration and time-travel capabilities.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td><code>@blocksuite/inline</code></td>\n    <td>Minimal rich text components for inline editing. BlockSuite allows spliting rich text content in different block nodes into different inline editors, making complex content conveniently composable. <strong>This significantly reduces the complexity required to implement traditional rich text editing features.</strong></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td><code>@blocksuite/block-std</code></td>\n    <td>Framework-agnostic library for modeling editable blocks.
