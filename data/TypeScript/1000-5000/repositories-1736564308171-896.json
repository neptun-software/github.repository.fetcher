          "content": "# Contributing to TOAST UI\n\nFirst off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉 😘 ✨\n\nThe following is a set of guidelines for contributing to TOAST UI. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.\n\n## Reporting Bugs\nBugs are tracked as GitHub issues. Search the list and try reproduce on [demo][demo] before you create an issue. When you create an issue, please provide the following information by filling in the template.\n\nExplain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:\n\n* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.\n* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. Don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used a mouse or a keyboard.\n* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps.** Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets on the issue, use Markdown code blocks.\n* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.\n* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**\n* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.\n\n## Suggesting Enhancements\nIn case you want to suggest for a TOAST UI product, please follow this guideline to help maintainers and the community understand your suggestion.\nBefore creating suggestions, please check [issue list](../../../labels/feature%20request) if there's already a request.\n\nCreate an issue and provide the following information:\n\n* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.\n* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.\n* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps.** Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as Markdown code blocks.\n* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which helps demonstrate the steps or point out the part of a TOAST UI product which the suggestion is related to.\n* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most TOAST UI users.\n* **List some other products where this enhancement exists.**\n\n## First Code Contribution\n\nUnsure where to begin contributing to TOAST UI? You can start by looking through these `document`, `good first issue` and `help wanted` issues:\n\n* **document issues**: issues which should be reviewed or improved.\n* **good first issues**: issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.\n* **help wanted issues**: issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.\n\n## Pull Requests\n\n### Development WorkFlow\n- Set up your development environment\n- Make change from a right branch\n- Be sure the code passes `npm run test`\n- Make a pull request\n\n### Development environment\n- Prepare your machine node and it's packages installed.\n- Checkout our repository\n- Install dependencies by `npm install && bower install`\n- Start webpack-dev-server by `npm run serve`\n\n### Make changes\n#### Checkout a branch\n- **develop**: PR base branch. merge features, updates for next minor or major release\n- **master**: bug fix or document update for next patch release. develop branch will rebase every time master branch update. so keep code change to a minimum.\n- **production**: lastest release branch with distribution files. never make a PR on this\n- **gh-pages**: API docs, examples and demo\n\n#### Check Code Style\nRun `npm run eslint` and make sure all the tests pass.\n\n#### Test\nRun `npm run test` and verify all the tests pass.\nIf you are adding new commands or features, they must include tests.\nIf you are changing functionality, update the tests if you need to.\n\n#### Commit\nFollow our [commit message conventions](./docs/COMMIT_MESSAGE_CONVENTION.md).\n\n### Yes! Pull request\nMake your pull request, then describe your changes.\n#### Title\nFollow other PR title format on below.\n```\n    <Type>: Short Description (fix #111)\n    <Type>: Short Description (fix #123, #111, #122)\n    <Type>: Short Description (ref #111)\n```\n* capitalize first letter of Type\n* use present tense: 'change' not 'changed' or 'changes'\n\n#### Description\nIf it has related to issues, add links to the issues(like `#123`) in the description.\nFill in the [Pull Request Template](./docs/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) by check your case.\n\n## Code of Conduct\nThis project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Code of Conducting](CODE_OF_CONDUCTING.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to dl_javascript@nhn.com.\n\n> This Guide is base on [atom contributing guide](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), [CocoaPods](http://guides.cocoapods.org/contributing/contribute-to-cocoapods.html) and [ESLint](http://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/contributing/pull-requests)\n"

[toast-ui.grid](https://github.com/nhn/tui.grid/tree/master/packages/toast-ui.grid) - Plain JavaScript component implemented by NHN Cloud.\n- [toast-ui.vue-grid](https://github.com/nhn/tui.grid/tree/master/packages/toast-ui.vue-grid) - **Vue** wrapper component implemented by NHN Cloud.\n- [toast-ui.react-grid](https://github.com/nhn/tui.grid/tree/master/packages/toast-ui.react-grid) - **React** wrapper component implemented by NHN Cloud.\n\n## 🤖 The Toast UI Grid Is an Ultimate Transformer\n\n### Data Can Be Displayed in Any Format\n\n#### Styling\n\nThe TOAST UI Grid is a component that can **display**, **edit**, **add**, and **delete** multiple data.\nYou can append units to the data shown and use `html` to represent images and links instead of textual data.\n\n![style](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18183560/41572390-7cbb9478-73b2-11e8-817d-eca61ee939ae.png)\n\n#### Summary\n\nThe summary function allows you to caculate on multiple rows of data and display the results.\nIt automatically calculates the **total sum**, the **average**, the **maximum and minimum value**, and updates each result whenever the value changes.\n\n![summary](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18183560/41572394-7e821e76-73b2-11e8-90bc-630b55be4367.png)\n\n#### Tree Data\n\nStarting with version 3 or later, you can use tree data to represent them in a hierarchy.\nNow let's process the data we want.\n\n![tree](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18183560/41572383-780a9c08-73b2-11e8-9ffb-7bc5e58860e6.png)\n\n### Provides a Custom Editing Elements\n\nIn order to edit the data, you don't need to use `html` to create the editing elements yourself.\nIt supports various `input` elements such as **text**, **select box**, **checkbox**, **radio button.**\nYou can set the data editing method just by setting options.\nYou can also show editing elements whatever you want through **Custom Editor**.\n\n![59417111-9e181280-8e01-11e9-8de7-2df819b36354](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37766175/59748226-9b139b00-92b5-11e9-9e72-d4b6e3fbd5ff.png)\n\n### Simple, Easy to Use Themes\n\nIt has three themes: **default**, **striped** (zebra pattern), and **clean** theme.\nYou can easily add the desired design to the themes provided through the theme API.\nThemes API has been improved since version 3, allowing you to easily control the background color of the header / body area and vertical / horizontal border lines without modifying CSS styles directly.\nUse the theme to customize your grid.</span>\n\n| default                                                                                                                | striped
