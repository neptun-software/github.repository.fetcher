If you are already familiar with `git`, follow these steps:\n\n1. If you haven't already, start by [forking](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) this repository. \n1. [Create a new branch](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects/creating-a-branch-for-your-work) in your fork. Name it using the product you want to add \n1. Switch to that branch (should happen automatically if you've just created it) and open the `graveyard.json` file\n1. Run `yarn && yarn kill` to start the product addition CLI. This will prompt you for the information and validate your entry as you go. It will write the product information into the `graveyard.json` file for you.\n1. After the CLI, run `yarn test` to ensure that the `graveyard.json` is formatted properly and all values are valid.\n1. Commit your work in git and [create a Pull Request (PR)](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request) using the newly created branch.\n\nFor code contributions outside of `graveyard.json`, check out the [Contributing Guide](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n### Editorial Guidelines\n\n#### Description\nThe description should be a single sentence describing the product. It should begin with the products name. For example, \"Google Reader was an RSS/Atom feed aggregator.\" It will be attached to a generated sentence like \"Killed about 5 years ago, Google Reader was an RSS/Atom feed aggregator.\"\n\nPlease be respectful, only use past tense.\n\n#### Link\nLink should be a resource that mentions the discontinuation date and talks about the product. Links to Wikipedia or a news organization should be prioritized. **Please do not use Google Support articles, linking to the product's URL, the product's marketing URL, or other Google-provided links.** Google removes these links quickly after a service is ended.\n\n#### Type\nThe type should be either `app`, `service`, or `hardware` as a string.\n"
