Here are the guidelines we'd like you to follow:\n\n - [Code of Conduct](#coc)\n - [Question or Problem?](#question)\n - [Issues and Bugs](#issue)\n - [Submission Guidelines](#submit)\n - [Updating Documentation](#docs)\n\n## <a name=\"coc\"></a> Code of Conduct\n\nAs contributors and maintainers of the Firebase JS SDK project, we pledge to respect everyone who\ncontributes by posting issues, updating documentation, submitting pull requests, providing feedback\nin comments, and any other activities.\n\nCommunication through any of Firebase's channels (GitHub, StackOverflow, X, etc.)\nmust be constructive and never resort to personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment,\ninsults, or other unprofessional conduct.\n\nWe promise to extend courtesy and respect to everyone involved in this project regardless of gender,\ngender identity, sexual orientation, disability, age, race, ethnicity, religion, or level of\nexperience. We expect anyone contributing to the project to do the same.\n\nIf any member of the community violates this code of conduct, the maintainers of the Firebase JS SDK\nproject may take action, removing issues, comments, and PRs or blocking accounts as deemed\nappropriate.\n\nIf you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please drop us a\nline at firebase-code-of-conduct@google.com.\n\n## <a name=\"question\"></a> Got a Question?\n\nIf you have questions about how to use the Firebase JS SDK, please direct these to\n[StackOverflow][stackoverflow] and use the `firebase` and `javascript` tags. You can also use the\n[Firebase Google Group][firebase-google-group] or [Slack][slack] to contact members of the Firebase\nteam for help.\n\n## <a name=\"issue\"></a> Found an Issue?\n\nIf you find a bug in the source code, a mistake in the documentation, or some other issue, you can\nhelp us by submitting an issue to our [GitHub Repository][github]. Even better you can submit a Pull\nRequest with a test demonstrating the bug and a fix!\n\nSee [below](#submit) for some guidelines.\n\n## <a name=\"other-issue\"></a> Production Issues\n\nIf you have a production issue, please [contact Firebase support][support] who will work with you to\nresolve the issue.\n\n## <a name=\"submit\"></a> Submission Guidelines\n\n### Submitting an Issue\n\nBefore you submit your issue, try searching [past issues][archive], [StackOverflow][stackoverflow],\nand the [Firebase Google Group][firebase-google-group] for issues similar to your own. You can help\nus to maximize the effort we spend fixing issues, and adding new features, by not reporting\nduplicate issues.\n\nIf you encounter an issue that appears to be a bug that has not been reported before, please\n[open a new issue in the repo](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/issues/new/choose). When\nfilling out the new issue report form, be sure to include as much information as possible, such as\nreproduction steps, the error message you received, and any screenshots or other relevant data. The\nmore context you can provide the better we will be able to understand the issue, route it to the\nappropriate team, and provide you with the help you need.\n\nAlso as a great rule of thumb:\n\n**If you get help, help others. Good karma rulez!**\n\n## Before you Contribute\n\n### Sign our Contributor License Agreement\n\nContributions to this project must be accompanied by a\n[Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.developers.google.com/about) (CLA).\nYou (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution; this simply\ngives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the\nproject.\n\nIf you or your current employer have already signed the Google CLA (even if it\nwas for a different project), you probably don't need to do it again.\n\nVisit <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see your current agreements or to\nsign a new one.\n\n### Review our community guidelines\n\nThis project follows\n[Google's Open Source Community Guidelines](https://opensource.google/conduct/).\n\n### Submitting a Pull Request\n\nAll submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull\nrequests for this purpose. Consult\n[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more information on using\npull requests.\n\nIf you plan to work on a larger contribution, you should get in touch with us first through the\nissue tracker with your idea so that we can help out and possibly guide you. Coordinating up front\nmakes it much easier to avoid frustration later on. Some pull requests (large contributions, API\nadditions/changes, etc) may be subject to additional internal review, we appreciate your patience as\nwe fully validate your contribution.\n\n#### Pull Request Guidelines\n\n* Search [GitHub](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/pulls) for an open or closed Pull\nRequest that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.\n* Create an issue to discuss a change before submitting a PR. We'd hate to have to turn down your\ncontributions because of something that could have been communicated early on.\n* [Create a fork of the GitHub repo][fork-repo] to ensure that you can push your changes for us to\nreview.\n* Make your changes in a new git branch:\n\n  ```shell\n  git checkout -b my-fix-branch main\n  ```\n\n* Create your change, **including appropriate test cases**. Changes with tests are more likely to be\nmerged.\n* Avoid checking in files that shouldn't be tracked (e.g `node_modules`, `gulp-cache`, `.tmp`,\n`.idea`). If your development setup automatically creates some of these files, please add them to\nthe `.gitignore` at the root of the package (click [here][gitignore] to read more on how to add\nentries to the `.gitignore`).\n* Commit your changes\n\n     ```shell\n     git commit -a\n     ```\n  _Note: the optional commit `-a` command line option will automatically \"add\" and \"rm\" edited\n  files._\n\n* Test your changes locally to ensure everything is in good working order:\n\n    ```shell\n   npm test\n    ```\n\n* Push your branch to your fork on GitHub:\n\n    ```shell\n    git push origin my-fix-branch\n    ```\n\n* In GitHub, create a pull request against the `firebase-js-sdk:main` branch.\n* Add changeset. See [Adding changeset to PR](#adding-changeset-to-pr).\n* All pull requests must be reviewed by a member of the Firebase JS SDK team, who will merge it\nwhen/if they feel it is good to go.\n\nThat's it! Thank you for your contribution!\n\n#### Adding changeset to PR\nThe repository uses changesets to associate PR contributions with major and minor version releases\nand patch releases. If your change is a feature or a behavioral change (either of which should\ncorrespond to a version bump) then you will need to generate a changeset in your PR to track the\nchange.\n\nStart the changeset creation process by running the following command in the base directory of the\nrepository:\n\n```shell\nyarn changeset\n```\n\nYou will be asked to create a description (here's an [example](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/pull/3284#issuecomment-649718617)). You\nshould include the version bump for your package as well as the description for the change. Valid\nversion bump types are major, minor or patch, where:\n\n * a major version is an incompatible API change\n * a minor version is a backwards compatible API change\n * a patch version is a backwards compatible bug fix or any change that does not affect the API. A\n   refactor, for example.\n\nPlease always include the firebase package with the same version bump type as your package. This is\nto ensure that the version of the firebase package will be bumped correctly, \n\n For example,\n\n```\n---\n\"@firebase/storage\": minor\n\"firebase\": minor\n---\n\nThis is a test.\n```\n\nYou do not need to create a Changeset for the following changes:\n\n * the addition or alteration of a test\n * documentation updates\n * updates to the repository’s CI\n\n#### Multiple changeset files\n\nIf your PR touches multiple SDKs or addresses multiple issues that require\ndifferent version bump or different description, you can create multiple\nchangeset files in the PR.\n\n## <a name=\"docs\"></a> Updating Documentation\n\nReference docs for the Firebase [JS SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/) and\n[Node (client) SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/node/) are generated by\n[Typedoc](https://typedoc.org/).\n\nTypedoc generates this documentation from the main\n[firebase index.d.ts type definition file](packages/firebase/index.d.ts).  Any updates to\ndocumentation should be made in that file.\n\nIf any pages are added or removed by your change (by adding or removing a class or interface), the\n[js/toc.yaml](scripts/docgen/content-sources/js/toc.yaml) and/or\n[node/toc.yaml](scripts/docgen/content-sources/node/toc.yaml) need to be modified to reflect this.\n\n# Formatting Code\nA Formatting Check CI failure in your PR indicates that the code does not follow the repo's\nformatting guidelines. In your local build environment, please run the code formatting tool locally\nby executing the command `yarn format`. Once the code is formatted, commit the changes and push your\nbranch. The push should cause the CI to re-check your PR's changes.\n\n# Generating Documentation HTML Files\n\nIf the Doc Change Check fails in your PR, it indicates that the documentation has not been generated\ncorrectly for the changes. In your local build environment, please run the following commands in the\nroot directory to generate the documentation locally:\n\n```\nyarn\nyarn docgen:all\n```\n\nThis will generate reference docs and the toc in `docs-devsite/`. Commit and push the generated\ndocumentation changes to GitHub following the [PR submission guidelines](#submit). Your push\nto the remote repository should force any failing documentation checks to execute again.\n\n**NOTE:** These files are formatted to be inserted into Google's documentation site, which adds some\nstyling and navigation, so the raw files will be missing navigation elements and may not look\npolished. However, it should be enough to preview the content.\n\n[archive]: https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue\n[file-an-issue]: https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/issues/new\n[firebase-google-group]: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/firebase-talk\n[fork-repo]: https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk/fork\n[github]: https://github.com/firebase/firebase-js-sdk\n[gitignore]: https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore\n[google-cla]: https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-individual\n[js-style-guide]: http://google.github.io/styleguide/javascriptguide.xml\n[jsbin]: http://jsbin.com/rinilu/edit?js,console\n[slack]: https://firebase-community.appspot.com/\n[stackoverflow]: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/firebase\n[support]: https://firebase.google.com/support/\n"

This SDK is distributed via:\n\n- [CDN](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup/#add-sdks-initialize)\n- [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase)\n\nTo get started using Firebase, see\n[Add Firebase to your JavaScript Project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup).\n\n[![Release Notes](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/firebase.svg?style=flat-square&label=Release%20Notes%20for&labelColor=039be5&color=666)](https://firebase.google.com/support/release-notes/js)\n\n## Upgrade to Version 9\n\nVersion 9 has a redesigned API that supports tree-shaking. Read the [Upgrade Guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/modular-upgrade) to learn more.\n\n## Supported Environments\n\nPlease see [Environment Support](https://firebase.google.com/support/guides/environments_js-sdk).\n\n## SDK Dev Workflow\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n#### Node.js\n\nBefore you can start working on the Firebase JS SDK, you need to have Node.js\ninstalled on your machine. As of April 19th, 2024 the team has been testing with Node.js version \n`20.12.2`, but the required version of Node.js may change as we update our dependencies.\n\nTo download Node.js visit https://nodejs.org/en/download/.\n\n_NOTE: You can use a tool like [`NVM`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)\nor [`N`](https://github.com/tj/n) to install and manage multiple node versions_\n\n#### Yarn\n\nIn addition to Node.js we use `yarn` to facilitate multi package development.\n\nTo install `yarn` follow the instructions listed on their website:\nhttps://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install\n\nThis repo currently supports building with yarn `1.x`. For instance, after installing yarn, run\n```bash\n$ yarn set version 1.22.11\n```\n\n#### Java\n\nThe closure compiler requires a modern Java installation. Java 11+ should be installed: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11\n\n#### Verify Prerequisites\n\nYou can verify your setup by running the following commands in your terminal:\n\n```bash\n$ node -v\n$ yarn -v\n$ java -version\n```\n\nYour `node` version should be `20.12.2`, your `yarn` version should\nbe between `1.0.0` and `1.22.11`, and your `java` version should be `11.0` or greater.\n\n_NOTE: We will update the documentation as new versions are required, however\nfor continuing development on the SDK, staying up to date on the stable versions\nof these packages is advised_\n\n### Install Dependencies\n\nOnce you have Node.js and `yarn` installed on your machine and have validated\nthat you are running the proper version, you can set up the development environment\nby running the following at the root of the SDK:\n\n```bash\n$ yarn\n```\n\nOnce you have installed all the dependencies, you can build the entire SDK by\nrunning the following command the root of the SDK:\n\n```bash\n$ yarn build\n```\n\n## Testing the SDK\n\n### Test Setup\n\nA production project is required to test the Firebase JS SDK. You can create a\nnew project by visiting the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).\n\n#### Web App Setup\n\nVisit the \"Project Overview\" and select \"Add app\" under your project name. Register the app with a\nnickname and click through the remaining steps. Without performing this step, you will encounter\nthe error in the test setup:\n\n```\nFirebaseError: There are no WEB apps associated with this Firebase project\n```\n\n#### Firestore Database Setup\n\nVisit the \"Firestore Database\" section of the console and create a Cloud Firestore\ndatabase. When prompted to select the set of initial security rules, select\nany option (e.g. \"Start in Production Mode\") since these permission settings\nwill be overwritten below.\n\n#### Realtime Database Setup\n\nVisit the \"Realtime Database\" section of the console and create a realtime\ndatabase. When prompted to select the set of initial security rules, select\nany option (e.g. \"Start in Locked Mode\") since these permission settings\nwill be overwritten below.\n\n#### Storage Setup\n\nVisit the \"Storage\" section of the console and create a storage bucket. In \norder to run the tests, you will need to update your bucket's CORS rules.\n\n1. Create a new file called `cors.json` with the contents:\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"origin\": [\"http://localhost:8089\"],\n        \"method\": [\"GET\"],\n        \"maxAgeSeconds\": 3600\n    }\n]\n```\n1. Install `gsutil` from https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil_install\n1. You will need to login if this is your first time using `gsutil`. Run `gcloud auth login`\nand follow the instructions to login.\n1. Run `gsutil cors set cors.json gs://<your-cloud-storage-bucket>`\n\nFor more information, visit https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/web/download-files#cors_configuration\n\n#### Authentication Support\n\nVisit the authentication config in your project and enable the `Anonymous`\nsign-in provider to complete your project config.\n\n#### Automated Setup\n\nThe tests need to be configured to use the Firebase production project that you\ncreated in the \"Test Setup\" section above. To do this, run the `yarn test:setup`\ncommand, as follows:\n\n\n```bash\n# Select the Firebase project via the text-based UI. This will run tools/config.js\n# and deploy from config/ to your Firebase project.\n$ yarn test:setup\n\n# Specify the Firebase project via the command-line arguments.\n$ yarn test:setup --projectId=<test_firebase_project_id>\n```\n\nIf you see an error like\n```\nHTTP Error: 404, Project '<test_firebase_project_id>' does not exist.\n```\nthen make sure that you have created the database as specified in the \"Firestore\nDatabase Setup\" section above.\n\n### Running the tests\n\nEach of the directories in the `integration` directory as well as the `packages`\ndirectory have their own test suites. You will need to build the SDK before\nrunning tests. Test suites can be run all together by running the following \ncommand at the root of the package:\n\n```bash\n$ yarn test\n```\n\nIn addition, you can run any of the tests individually by running `yarn test` in\nan individual package directory.\n\n## Building the SDK\n\n### Introduction\n\nThe Firebase JS SDK is built with a series of individual packages that are all\ncontained in this repository. Development is coordinated via [yarn\nworkspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/blog/2017/08/02/introducing-workspaces/) and\n[Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) (a monorepo management tool).\n\nEach package in the `packages` directory, constitute a piece of our\nimplementation. The SDK is built via a combination of all of these packages\nwhich are published under the [`firebase`\nscope](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=scope%3Afirebase) on NPM.\n\n### Testing the SDK Locally\n\nPlease be sure your product's package has been built before proceeding any further. (If you haven't built this repo before, make sure to run `yarn build` at the root)\nIn order to manually test your SDK changes locally, you must use [yarn link](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/link):\n\n```shell\n$ cd packages/firebase\n$ yarn link # initialize the linking to the other folder\n$ cd ../<my-product> # Example: $ cd ../firestore\n$ yarn link # link your product to make it available elsewhere\n$ cd <my-test-app-dir> # cd into your personal project directory\n$ yarn link firebase @firebase/<my-product> # tell yarn to use the locally built firebase SDK instead\n```\n\nThis will create a symlink and point your `<my-test-app-dir>` to the locally built version of the firebase SDK.\n\n### Helper Scripts\n\nEach package in the `packages` directory exposes a `dev` script. This script\nwill set up a watcher for development on the individual piece of the SDK. In\naddition, there is a top level `dev` script that can be run to start all of the\nwatch tasks as well as a sandbox server.\n\nYou can run the dev script by running the following at the root of the package:\n\n```bash\n$ yarn dev\n```\n\n### Prepush Hooks\n\nAs part of this repo, we use the NPM package [`husky`](https://npm.im/husky) to\nimplement git hooks. We leverage the prepush hook to do two things:\n\n- Automated code styling (using [`prettier`](https://npm.im/prettier))\n- Automated LICENSE header insertion\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [Contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on contributing to the Firebase\nJavaScript SDK.\n\n### Big Thanks\n\nCross-browser Testing Platform and Open Source <3 Provided by [Sauce Labs][homepage]\n\n[homepage]: https://saucelabs.com\n"
