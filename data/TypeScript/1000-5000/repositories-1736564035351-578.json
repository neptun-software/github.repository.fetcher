This is a detailed alova contribution guidelines, which includes detailed guidance on contributing to all aspects of alova. Please continue reading.\n\n## Preface\n\nIn the past period of time, we have received active participation information from developers from all over the world in Github issues and Github Discussion, which means that alova is being loved by more and more developers. Even so, alova is still a rookie, and it still has a long way to go.\n\n**We expect to make alova a common project for everyone who is willing to participate, and we encourage everyone to become a contributor to the alova community with an open and inclusive attitude. Moreover, we believe that contributing to alova is not limited to code contributions, but participating in any activities that are beneficial to the development of alova is considered to contribute to alova.** Participating in contributions now can win you more effective contribution opportunities, and it allows you to contribute to the world Even if you are a junior developer, as long as the idea is in line with [alova's mission and design principles](#alova-mission-and-design-principles), please generously participate!\n\n> There is a [Code of conduct](https://alova.js.org/contributing/code-of-conduct) here, please refer to it.\n\n## Contribution directory\n\nHere are 13 places where you can contribute, but not limited to these, you can choose the part you want to participate in, and link to the corresponding location for detailed reading:\n\n- [use alova in your project](#use-alova-in-your-project)\n- [star alova](#star-alova)\n- [report bug](#report-bug)\n- [Propose new feature ideas](#propose-new-feature-ideas)\n- [Pull Request](#pull-request)\n- [Create an adapter or strategy library based on alova](#create-an-adapter-or-strategy-library-based-on-alova)\n- [Participate in community/PR review](#participate-in-community-pr-review)\n- [Publish and disseminate information about alova](#publish-and-disseminate-information-about-alova)\n- [Share experience](#share-experience)\n- [Collaboration](#collaboration)\n- [Donation](#donation)\n- [Correct or add docs](#correct-or-add-docs)\n- [Translate docs](#Translate-docs)\n\n## alova mission and design principles\n\n### alova Mission\n\nalova's mission gives it a clear development direction, which clearly defines what alova should do.\n\nalova is a lightweight request strategy library, **Its mission is to enable developers to achieve more efficient Client-Server data interaction by less codes**.\n\nFor developers, alova provides them with a simple API and out-of-the-box advanced request functions, as well as various simple and high-performance request strategy modules. For application users, they can enjoy the benefits of alova The smooth experience brought by high-performance data interaction, therefore, alova has the following features:\n\n1. The api design is similar to axios, allowing users to learn at a lower cost;\n2. Deep binding of the UI framework, greatly improving the benefits of developers;\n3. Out-of-the-box advanced functions to avoid repeated packaging, such as request sharing, request caching, etc., to reduce developers' repeated packaging;\n4. The platform-independent coding method can be seamlessly transplanted;\n5. High scalability design, which can encapsulate high-reusability and high-performance business-related request strategies;\n6. Highly aggregated and low-coupling method design improves API code maintainability;\n\n### alova design principles\n\nThe design principles points out how it should be designed, the following is the core design concept of alova.\n\n1. `Method` proxy design, high aggregation, platform-independent design, throughout the request, you should be able to access it in any request function, from another perspective, the information related to the request should also be placed in the method instance ;\n2. Lightweight, try to keep the source code concise in coding, such as avoiding repeated code, merging variable declarations, prototype chain function encapsulation, no similar API, tree shaking, but long variable names are allowed, because it will be used when compiling will be replaced by a single letter;\n3. Highly scalable design. First, the design of alova uses a large number of adapter patterns and hook functions. For example, adapters include `requestAdapter`, `storageAdapter`, etc., and hook functions include `beforeRequest`, `responded`, `transform`, `localCache`, etc., and most of them have default behaviors, which are designed to be easy to use while retaining high scalability; second, global request parameters can be overwritten, such as `timeout`, `shareRequest`, etc., for These parameters can be set individually for special requests.\n4. The api design is universal. First, it means that the function of this api has a high level of abstraction, rather than a specific business. Second, the api design is scalable to adapt to the needs of the api iteration\n\n> The api universal design is only applicable to the alova library. If you are conceiving a request strategy, you can design it according to the specific business.\n\n## Select the contribution point you are interested in\n\n### Use alova in your project\n\nWe believe that your use of alova in the project is also a contributor to alova, which is also telling people that alova is a trustworthy open source project, please open [this issue](https://github.com/alovajs/alova/issues/165), which may give you the opportunity to display your project on the alova official website.\n\n### Star alova\n\nAlthough this may be considered insignificant, it represents your recognition of alova, and every star is very important to alova. star alova in the right top of [alova's Github repository](https://github.com/alovajs/alova), which is important to us.\n\n### Report bug\n\nPlease move to [Github new issue](https://github.com/alovajs/alova/issues/new/choose) and select the corresponding template to submit.

Please read the [Developing Guidelines](https://alova.js.org/contributing/developing-guidelines) carefully before developing, it can guide you step by step on how to contribute code.\n> 2. When you identify an issue that needs to be resolved, please make sure that it has not been flagged by someone else's pull request, which means that it has been pre-occupied.\n\n### Create an adapter or strategy library based on alova\n\nalova provides high-extensibility features, and you can write your own js library based on it.\n\n#### Custom Adapter\n\nCustomize various adapters to meet the operating requirements in different environments. The following directions are available for reference:\n\n1. Customize statesHook, which can be executed under different UI frameworks, such as `solid/qwik`, currently supports `react/vue/svelte`, please read [Custom statesHook](https://alova.js.org/tutorial/advanced/custom-stateshook);\n2. Customize the request adapter, so that alova can cooperate with more request schemes, such as `GraphQL/SSE`, etc.;\n3. Customize the storage adapter to meet the storage requirements of different environments, such as `react-native`;\n4. Any combination of the above, such as the official [uniapp adapter](https://github.com/alovajs/adapter-uniapp), which includes request adapters and storage adapters.\n\n#### Custom request strategy\n\nRequest strategies can help developers write high-performance functions more efficiently. Although the official [alova/scene](https://alova.js.org/category/strategy) provides some common request strategies, it is not enough It is a good choice to customize your own reusable request strategy based on alova to meet the business scenarios related to various requests of developers, and you can also publish them on npm for everyone to use.\n\n> If you have written an alova-based js library, please submit your project in [this issue](https://github.com/alovajs/alova/issues/165), which will allow your project to be displayed on the alova official website Opportunity.\n\n### Participate in community/PR review\n\nIf you are interested in technical communication, then it may be more suitable for you to participate in more community communication.

Method 代理设计，高聚合、平台无关的设计，贯穿请求始终，你在任意请求函数中都应该可以访问到它，从另一个角度说，与请求相关的信息也应该被放在 method 实例中;\n2. 轻量级，在编码中尽量保持源码简洁，例如避免重复代码、合并变量声明、原型链函数封装、无相似 api、tree shaking，但长变量名是被允许的，因为在编译时它将会被单个字母替代;\n3. 高扩展性设计，其一，alova 的设计中大量使用了适配器模式和钩子函数，例如适配器有`requestAdapter`、`storageAdapter`等，钩子函数有`beforeRequest`、`reseponded`、`transform`、`localCache`等，而且大多存在默认行为，这样设计的目的是为了在保留高扩展性的同时，使用也足够简单；其二，全局请求参数可覆盖，例如`timeout`、`shareRequest`等，对于特别的请求可单独设置这些参数。\n4. api 设计具有普适性，其一，它表示此 api 的功能具有较高的抽象层级，而不是针对某一个具体业务而提出的；其二，api 设计具有可扩展性，以适应 api 的迭代\n\n> api 普适性设计仅适用于 alova 库，如果你正在构思一个请求策略，那么可以根据具体业务来设计。\n\n## 选择你感兴趣的贡献点\n\n### 在项目中使用 alova\n\n我们认为，你们在项目中使用 alova 也是属于 alova 的贡献者，这也是在告诉人们，alova 是值得信任的开源项目，请在[这个 issue](https://github.com/alovajs/alova/issues/165)中提交你的项目，这可能会获得在 alova 官网展示你项目的机会。\n\n### 为 alova 点星\n\n虽然这可能会被认为微不足道，但这代表了你对 alova 的认可，对 alova 来说每一个 star 也是至关重要，请在[alova 的 Github 仓库](https://github.com/alovajs/alova)的右上角为我们点亮星星，这对我们很重要。\n\n### 报告 bug\n\n请移步到[Github new issue](https://github.com/alovajs/alova/issues/new/choose)中选择对应的模板提交，详细说明将会在提交 issue 中展示。\n\n**请注意：** 如果你想问 alova 相关的问题，请到[Github Disscussion](https://github.com/alovajs/alova/discussions)中创建，在 issue 中提问将会被立即关闭。\n\n### 提出新特性想法\n\n为了让 alova 可以实现它的价值和目标，在提交一个新特性想法前，请仔细阅读[alova 使命和设计理念](#alova-使命和设计理念)，并保证你的新想法符合 alova 的使命和设计理念。\n\n然后，请到[🚀 新特性提案](https://github.com/alovajs/alova/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature-request&projects=&template=FEATURE_REQUEST_zh-CN.yml)中提交，详细说明将会在提交 issue 时展示。\n\n### Pull Request\n\n你可以通过 pull request 贡献以下 3 个方面的代码。如果你是一位有意向参与的新伙伴，在[Github 贡献列表](https://github.com/alovajs/alova/contribute)中列出了所有的`good first issue`的 issues，它用来告诉有兴趣参与贡献的新伙伴，这个是一个好的开始。\n\n#### bug 修改\n\n在 Github issues 中被标记为[`bug:confirmed`](https://github.com/alovajs/alova/labels/bug%3Aconfirmed)的 issues，都是已被确认的 bug，你可以自由选择。\n\n如果你自己遇到了 bug，也请先[报告 bug](#报告-bug)确保 bug 被确认，以避免造成无效的 pull request。\n\n#### 新特性开发\n\n在 Github issues 中被标记为[`feature-request:confirmed`](https://github.com/alovajs/alova/labels/feature-request%3Aconfirmed)的 issues，都是已被确认的新特性，你可以自由选择。\n\n如果你有一个添加新特性的想法，也请先[提交一个新特性想法的 issue](#提出新特性想法)确保想法被确认，以避免造成无效的 pull request。\n\n#### 项目配置\n\n如果你很擅长项目配置，并发现了 alova 项目的不足之处，例如不够完整的配置、配置版本太老旧、自动化不足（包含项目开发自动化和 Github 仓库管理的自动化），你也可以按[新特性开发](#新特性开发)的流程进行贡献。\n\n> 重要\n>\n> 1. 在开发前请仔细阅读[开发指南](https://alova.js.org/contributing/development-guide)，它可以一步步地指导你如何贡献代码。\n> 2. 在你确定了一个需要解决的 issue 时，请确保它没有被其他人的 pull request 标记，它表示已被人先占有。\n\n### 基于 alova 编写适配器和策略库\n\nalova 提供了高扩展特性，你可以基于它编写自己的 js 库。\n\n#### 自定义适配器\n\n自定义各类适配器以满足不同环境下的运行要求，以下几个方向可供参考：\n\n1. 自定义 statesHook，满足在不同 UI 框架下执行，例如`solid/qwik`，目前内置支持`react/vue/svelte`，请阅读[自定义 statesHook](https://alova.js.org/tutorial/advanced/custom-stateshook)；\n2. 自定义请求适配器，让 alova 可以与更多请求方案协作，例如`GraphQL/SSE`等；\n3. 自定义存储适配器，满足不同环境的存储，例如`react-native`；\n4. 以上任意的组合，例如官方的[uniapp 适配器](https://github.com/alovajs/adapter-uniapp)，其中包含了请求适配器、存储适配器。\n\n#### 自定义请求策略\n\n请求策略可以帮助开发者更高效地编写出高性能功能，虽然官方的 [alova/scene](https://alova.js.org/category/strategy) 提供了一些常用的请求策略，但还不足以满足广大开发者各种请求相关的业务场景，基于 alova 自定义你自己的可复用请求策略是一个不错的选择，也可以将它们发布到 npm 上给大家使用。\n\n> 如果你编写了基于 alova 的 js 库，请在[这个 issue](https://github.com/alovajs/alova/issues/165)中提交你的项目，这可以让你的项目获得在 alova 官网展示的机会。\n\n### 参与社区交流/PR review\n\n如果你对技术交流感兴趣，那么参与更多的社区交流可能更适合你，你可以在 Github issues 中参与 bug 和新特性的讨论，也可以在[Github Disscussion](https://github.com/alovajs/alova/discussions)中、微信群、Discord 频道中为别人解答问题，这可以让你与世界各地的人交流，是一件很有趣的事情。\n\n同时，你也可以在[pull request](https://github.com/alovajs/alova/pulls)中参与 PR review，这也是一种交流的主题。\n\n### 发布和传播 alova 的信息\n\n你可以在任何社交平台、短视频平台，或技术分享平台发布或转发传播任何有利于 alova 发展的信息，这有利于提高 alova 的影响力。我们将会筛选出相关的文章或视频在 alova 官网展示它们。这里有一些优质的文章：\n\n- [是时候该换掉你的 axios 了](https://juejin.cn/post/7213923957824979000)\n- [（深度）开源框架/库的伟大与罪恶](https://juejin.cn/post/7215608036394729532)\n- [Alova.js 筆記－試用相較 axios 更輕量、更高集成的請求庫](https://uu9924079.medium.com/alova-js-%E7%AD%86%E8%A8%98-%E8%A9%A6%E7%94%A8%E7%9B%B8%E8%BC%83-axios-%E6%9B%B4%E8%BC%95%E9%87%8F-%E6%9B%B4%E9%AB%98%E9%9B%86%E6%88%90%E7%9A%84%E8%AB%8B%E6%B1%82%E5%BA%AB-546ec5424df9)\n\n### 分享使用经验\n\n如果你有值得分享的 alova 使用经验，或者较好的实践案例，你可以在[Github Disscussion 的 Practices](https://github.com/alovajs/alova/discussions/categories/practices)中分享，较好的分享也将会在官方文档中展示。\n\n### 项目合作\n\n我们欢迎与任何组织或个人进行项目合作，这可以帮助我们扩大 alova 的影响力，加速项目的发展。如果您有任何合作建议或意向，请发送邮件到**hujou555@gmail.com**与我们联系。\n\n### 项目捐赠\n\n暂未开通，敬请期待...\n\n### 更正或编写文档\n\n如果你需要添加新的文档内容，或发现 alova 的文档有错误，例如错误的示例、错误的用词、描述不正确、或未提及的内容，你可以[新建文档仓库 issue](https://github.com/alovajs/alovajs.github.io/issues/new)，或[新建文档仓库 pull request](https://github.com/alovajs/alovajs.github.io/fork)直接修改错误，这应该是更好的选择，我们欢迎任何对文档的改进建议或贡献。\n\n### 翻译文档\n\n如果你擅长不同的语言，欢迎你为 alova 文档进行翻译，这将有助于扩展 alova 的使用范围和受众群体。\n\n## 成为核心团队成员\n\n具体查看[这边的内容](https://alova.js.org/contributing/become-core-member)\n"
