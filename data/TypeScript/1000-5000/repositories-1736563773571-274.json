          "content": "# Naming Convention\n\n## Hierarchy\n\nThe foundation of the naming convention in Iconoir is:\n\n```\n[Object]-[Modifier]-[Container]\n```\n\n### [Object]\n\nContains one or more objects.\n\n### [Modifier]\n\nIt's often an additional and unique element added as a secondary object (`-minus`, `-plus`, `-warning`).\n\n### [Container]\n\nA shape used as a container for the object (`-square`, `-circle`).\nIf a shape is directly part of an object, it's not considered a container.\n\n\\* You could notice a difference between icons such as\n`user-minus` and `minus-square`. The second one looks different\nbecause in this case the minus symbol is an _[Object]_, followed\nby the _[Container]_.\n\n## Styles\n\nAn optional rule is regarding icons style. Iconoir is actually offering Regular and Solid icons. With the latter, icons names end with `-solid`. An example here:\n\n- Regular: `check-circle`\n- Solid: `check-circle-solid`\n\n## Object-Oriented Naming\n\nExceptions apart, icons follow an object-oriented naming and\nshould not embed actions in their names.\n\nExamples:\n\n- `user-minus` is correct.\n- `remove-user` would be wrong.\n\n## Physical Actions\n\nIcons that represent a physical action or movement\ncan embed that action in their name.\n\nExamples:\n\n- `walking`, `running`, `vehicle-fast`, `crane-lifting` are correct.\n\n## Most-Used Modifiers and Shapes\n\n### Modifiers\n\n`-plus`, `-minus`, `-warning`, `-check`, `-xmark`, `-tag`,\n`-ban`, `-slash`\n\n- `-plus-in` and `minus-in`: Differently from `-plus` and `-minus`, these are used when the icon\n  has a bigger plus or minus icon in the center or inside the main object.\n- `-no-access`: It's regularly used when the icon has a restrict\n  symbol in a corner.\n\n### Shapes\n\n`-square`, `-circle`\n\n## Exceptions\n\nIf you spot an icon that is not following any of the rules,\nplease open a [new issue](https://github.com/iconoir-icons/iconoir/issues/new/choose) on GitHub.\n"

You can find the names of the icons [here](https://iconoir.com).\n\nThe icons are `display: inline-block` and default to the current font size. You can control this\nby adjusting the `::before` styles of the element (which is where the icons are added as a mask).\n\n## Figma\n\nThe library is available in the Figma community [here](https://www.figma.com/community/file/983248991460488027/Iconoir-Pack).\n\n## Swift Package\n\nTo add `Iconoir-swift` to your Xcode project, follow these steps:\n\n1. In Xcode, open your project and navigate to _File_ > _Swift Packages_ > _Add Package Dependency..._\n2. Enter the repository URL: `https://github.com/iconoir-icons/iconoir-swift.git`\n3. Choose the branch or version you want to add, and click _Next_.\n4. Select the target where you want to use the package, then click _Finish_.\n\n### UIKit\n\n```swift\nimport UIKit\nimport Iconoir\n\nlet imageView = UIImageView(image: Iconoir.bell.asUIImage)\n```\n\n### SwiftUI\n\n```swift\nimport SwiftUI\nimport Iconoir\n\nstruct ContentView: View {\n    var body: some View {\n        Iconoir.bell.asImage\n            .foregroundColor(.blue)\n            .font(.system(size: 24))\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT License.\n"
