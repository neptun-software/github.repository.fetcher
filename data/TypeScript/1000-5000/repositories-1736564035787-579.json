Comprehensive and Professional**\n\n- [Standardized Protocols for Questionnaires](https://xiaojusurvey.didi.cn/docs/next/agreement/%E3%80%8A%E9%97%AE%E5%8D%B7Meta%E5%8D%8F%E8%AE%AE%E3%80%8B)\n\nEnsuring concept interoperability is the foundation and core of the entire system. Based on practical business experience, two main categories have been established:\n\nBusiness Descriptions: Questionnaire protocol, question type protocol.\n\nMaterial Descriptions: Question type material protocol, including question types and settings.\n\n- [UI/UX Standardization for Questionnaires](https://xiaojusurvey.didi.cn/docs/next/design/%E3%80%8A%E8%AE%BE%E8%AE%A1%E8%A7%84%E8%8C%83%E3%80%8B)\n\nThe design language is the cornerstone of system flexibility and consistency, ensuring the system supports actual business operations with high user experience. It includes:\n\nDesign Standards: Flexible, noise-reducing, unified.\n\nInteraction Standards: Follows user behavior characteristics, product positioning, and mature user habits.\n\n- [WYSIWYG with High Consistency in Construction and Rendering](https://xiaojusurvey.didi.cn/docs/next/document/%E8%AE%BE%E8%AE%A1%E5%8E%9F%E7%90%86/%E9%A2%98%E5%9E%8B%E5%9C%BA%E6%99%AF%E5%8C%96%E8%AE%BE%E8%AE%A1)\n\nIn practical business usage, the system includes both questionnaire generation and deployment. We design question types in a scenario-based manner to ensure high consistency from production to application.\n\n- [Materialized Question Type Design for Free Customization and Extension](https://xiaojusurvey.didi.cn/docs/next/document/%E8%AE%BE%E8%AE%A1%E5%8E%9F%E7%90%86/%E9%A2%98%E5%9E%8B%E7%89%A9%E6%96%99%E5%8C%96%E8%AE%BE%E8%AE%A1/%E5%9F%BA%E7%A1%80%E8%AE%BE%E8%AE%A1)\n\nThe core component of questionnaires is question types, and their configurability determines the extensibility of business scenarios and the system's reusability. Each question type has general capabilities and atomic characteristics, ensuring high customization.\n\n- [Compliance Accumulation and High Expandability in Security Capabilities](https://xiaojusurvey.didi.cn/docs/next/document/%E5%AE%89%E5%85%A8%E8%AE%BE%E8%AE%A1/%E6%A6%82%E8%BF%B0)\n\nData encryption, sensitive information detection, and anti-vote brushing capabilities ensure the security of the questionnaire publishing and data collection process.\nLightweight Design for Quick Integration and Flexible Expansion.\n\n**2. Product-Level Open-Source Solution for Rapid Survey Process Implementation**\n\n- [Product-Level Open-Source Solution for Rapid Survey Process Implementation](https://xiaojusurvey.didi.cn/docs/next/document/%E4%BA%A7%E5%93%81%E6%89%8B%E5%86%8C/%E6%A6%82%E8%BF%B0)\n\nProvides complete product capabilities around the questionnaire lifecycle, including user management (login, registration, questionnaire permissions) and questionnaire management (create, edit, distribute, collect, data analysis), allowing for quick construction of survey solutions in specific fields.\n\n- [Out-of-the-Box Questionnaire Design to Reduce Domain Complexity](https://xiaojusurvey.didi.cn/docs/next/document/%E8%AE%BE%E8%AE%A1%E5%8E%9F%E7%90%86/%E9%97%AE%E5%8D%B7%E6%90%AD%E5%BB%BA%E9%A2%86%E5%9F%9F%E5%8C%96%E8%AE%BE%E8%AE%A1)\n\nHigh flexibility in questionnaire composition leads to high complexity in editing capabilities. We divide questionnaire editing into five sub-domains for product capability clustering and guide system modular design and development. Based on module arrangement and management, it can be used out-of-the-box.\n\n- [Low Cost for Secondary Development and Easy Customization](https://xiaojusurvey.didi.cn/docs/next/document/%E5%BC%80%E5%8F%91%E6%89%8B%E5%86%8C/%E5%B7%A5%E7%A8%8B%E9%85%8D%E7%BD%AE%E5%8C%96)\n\nThe entire system is designed based on protocol standardization, function modularization, and management configuration, and provides a complete set of documentation and development and extension manuals.\n\n- [Low Deployment Cost for Quick Online Launch](https://xiaojusurvey.didi.cn/docs/next/document/%E5%B7%A5%E7%A8%8B%E9%83%A8%E7%BD%B2/Docker%E9%83%A8%E7%BD%B2)\n\nThe front-end and back-end separation, Dockerization solutions, and complete deployment guidance manual.\n\n# Quick Start\n\nNode Version >= 18.x, [ check environment preparation guide.](https://xiaojusurvey.didi.cn/docs/next/document/%E6%A6%82%E8%BF%B0/%E5%BF%AB%E9%80%9F%E5%BC%80%E5%A7%8B)\n\nClone Project\n\n```shell\ngit clone git@github.com:didi/xiaoju-survey.git\n```\n\n## Server Startup\n\n### Option 1: Quick Start without Database Installation\n\n> _This is convenient for quickly previewing the project.
