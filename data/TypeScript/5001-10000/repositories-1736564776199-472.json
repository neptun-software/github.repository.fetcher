Due to version mismatching and lack of accurate tracking, a specific version for a Fontsource patch cannot be logged into the changelog. Note that Google may push [breaking changes](https://github.com/google/fonts/issues/1307) on their end to individual fonts which Fontsource cannot predict for.\n\n#### Minor (0.x.x)\n\nThese will always contain changes from Fontsource's end.\n\n# 5.x Release\n\n## 5.1.x\n\n- All packages now publish to NPM with a [provenance attestation](https://github.blog/security/supply-chain-security/introducing-npm-package-provenance/). [#994](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/994)\n\n## 5.0.x\n\nFor a full migration guide, please visit the [documentation](https://fontsource.org/docs/getting-started/migrate-v5).\n\n### BREAKING CHANGES\n\n- Variable fonts are now split into separate packages. [#589](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/issues/589)\n\n```js\n// Before\nimport \"@fontsource/roboto-flex/variable.css\";\n\n// After\nimport \"@fontsource-variable/roboto-flex\";\n```\n\n- Variable font family names have been corrected. [#385](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/issues/385)\n\n```css\n// Before\nbody {\n    font-family: \"Roboto FlexVariable\", sans-serif;\n}\n\n// After\nbody {\n    font-family: \"Roboto Flex Variable\", sans-serif;\n}\n```\n\n- Renamed variable font files to remove `wghtOnly` suffix. [#388](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/issues/388)\n- Full Sass integration rewrite. [#153](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/issues/153) [#356](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/issues/356) [#419](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/issues/419) [#492](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/issues/492) [#519](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/issues/519)\n- Remove custom icon classes from Material Icons.  [#532](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/issues/532)\n- Rename `@fontsource/material-icons-rounded` to `@fontsource/material-icons-round`. [#363](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/issues/363)\n- Add new license metadata that changes the license property in `metadata.json`. [#156](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/issues/156)\n\n### Features\n\n- Customizable `font-display` property using CSS variables. [#121](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/issues/121)\n- Include `LICENSE` file in each package. [#156](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/issues/156)\n- The entire project has been moved into a CLI tool. [#562](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/issues/562)\n- Rewrite custom packager to be included into the CLI. [#501](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/issues/501)\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Include subset specific italic files. [#289](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/issues/289)\n- Variable fonts now support numbered subsets. [#548](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/issues/548)\n\n### Documentation\n\nBrand new website has been [released](https://fontsource.org/)! Please note that it is very rough around the edges and we would appreciate PRs to help improve it! [#558](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/issues/558)\n\nHuge shoutout to [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) for sponsoring the design for the new website and [Fly.io](https://fly.io/) for sponsoring the hosting!\n\n# 4.x Release\n\n## 4.5.x\n\n### Features\n\n- Added unicode.json which contains the unicode subset data for the CSS unicode-range selector. This will be used for the upcoming API. [#271](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/271)\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Resolve regressions ([#353](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/issues/353)) caused by Google API tweaks.\n- Incorrect CSS output from SCSS mixin for src urls. [#416](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/416)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- Updated package changelogs to redirect to the main repository changelog to ensure there are no inconsistences. [#269](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/269)\n\n## 4.4.x\n\n### Features\n\n- Changed weight metadata from a string array to number array. e.g. [\"400\"] --> [400] [#240](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/240)\n\n- Removed local font names in CSS selector of `src:` which should cut down on inconsistencies of OS installed fonts. [#240](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/240)\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Stop serving variable fonts in normal packages, which should lead to smaller bundle sizes and resolve duplicated imports of certain fonts. [#240](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/240)\n\n## 4.3.x\n\n### Features\n\n- Added 'category' key to metadata.json. [#189](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/189)\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Update dependencies. [#187](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/187)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- New website. [#186](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/186) [#188](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/188) [#191](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/191) [#192](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/192) [#193](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/193) [#194](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/194) [#195](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/195) [#196](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/196) [#197](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/197) [#198](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/198)\n- Update READMEs with new information.

[#210](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/210)\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\n- Add testing and improve local build speeds. [#222](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/222)\n- Typescript Migration. [#229](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/229)\n\n## 4.2.x\n\n### Features\n\n- Added default variables to SCSS mixins. [#144](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/144)\n- Added $fontDir variable to SCSS mixins. [#146](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/146)\n- Added variable font support and $defSubset variable to SCSS mixins. [#147](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/147)\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Removed all default variable flags from SCSS mixins till further notice to resolve errors relating to importing multiple fonts. [#155](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/155)\n- Resolved incorrect unicodeMap numeric subset names that linked to the wrong files. [#167](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/167)\n- Update Material Icons [#177](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/177)\n- Apply previous SCSS Generic updates [#178](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/178)\n- Update dependencies [#168](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/168) [#169](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/169)\n\n### Documentation\n\n- Changed package.json descriptions to something more mature. [#148](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/148)\n- README updates for Sass usage. [#173](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/173)\n\n## 4.1.x\n\n### Features\n\n- Added customisable SASS support through mixins for more flexible user setups. [#64](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/issues/64) [#122](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/122)\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Major refactor to organise the templates and generic packager. [#120](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/120)\n\n## 4.0.x\n\n### BREAKING CHANGES\n\n- Package names have been renamed from `fontsource-<font name>` to the safer, more authentic scoped format `@fontsource/<font name>`.\n  That means all packages will need to be reinstalled with `yarn add @fontsource/<font name>` or `npm install @fontsource/<font name>` with imports updated to the new package such as `import @fontsource/open-sans/400-italic.css`. [#108](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/issues/108)\n\n- `import @fontsource/<font name>/<weight>.css` now only contains normal style variants of fonts. The `-normal.css` files throughout the respository have been removed. Importing italic variants remain the same via `import @fontsource/<font name>/<weight>-italic.css`.\n  Please see [#88](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/issues/88) for more details. [#112](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/112)\n\n### Features\n\n- All non-Google fonts now have weight specific files that match 3.0.x as they previously were only importable via subsets. Simply use as normal with `import @fontsource/<font name>/<weight>.css`. [#92](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/issues/92) [#115](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/115)\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Add publishConfig to package.json templates for scoped packages to successfully publish. [#118](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/118)\n- Generate index.css for fonts that do not have weight 400. [#119](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/119)\n\n# 3.x Release\n\n## 3.1.x\n\n### Features\n\n- Initial variable font support for Google Fonts. Supported fonts can be found [here](https://fonts.google.com/variablefonts) with their package README's explaining installation instructions. [#103](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/103)\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Resolve incorrect filename generation for oblique/slnt variable fonts. [#106](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/106) [#109](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/109)\n- Prevent full variant variable CSS files to be generated for fonts that do not have any extra axes. [#110](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/110)\n\n## 3.0.x\n\n### BREAKING CHANGES\n\n- `import fontsource-<font name>` or `index.css` no longer defaults to contain ALL weights and styles for a font. It now only contains weight 400 with all styles included. This was changed to prevent fonts, such as Noto Sans JP, to counter-intuitively generate 1MB+ CSS files with the new unicode-range feature.\n  Simply choose the necessary weights and styles from now on with `import fontsource-<font name>/<weight>.css` or `import fontsource-<font name>/<weight>-<style>.css`. [#37](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/37) [#42](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/42)\n\n- TTF/OTF support has been removed due to NPM package size limitations. Browser compatability goes as low as: [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/#feat=woff) [#44](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/44)\n\n### Features\n\n- Added unicode-range CSS selector to all fonts. It is no longer necessary for individual subsets to be defined when importing CSS files but backwards compatability remains. Use `import fontsource-<font name>/<weight>.css` or `import fontsource-<font name>/<weight>-<style>.css` to leverage the new feature from now on. [#37](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/37)\n- Added package.json rebuilder. [#43](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/43)\n- Added force rebuild to Google packages. [#37](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/37)\n- Added force rebuild to non-Google packages. [#42](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/42)\n- Autogenerate `FONTLIST.md` and added `FONTLIST.json`. [#58](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/58)\n- Copy `CHANGELOG.md` to every individual package. [#41](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/41)\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Adjusted templates.js to add more relevant fields to package.json [#37](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/37)\n- Resolved subsets not correctly being identified when packaging files through the generic packager. [#45](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/45)\n\n# 2.x Release\n\n## 2.2.x\n\n### Features\n\n- Added TTF/OTF support for every package for older browser compatability. [#33](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/33)\n- Refactored entire API source from [majodev/google-webfonts-helper](https://github.com/majodev/google-webfonts-helper) to [fontsource/google-font-metadata](https://github.com/fontsource/google-font-metadata) for future expandability. [#33](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/33)\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Add Yarn resolution to resolve Lerna publish errors. [f6e7b1f](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/commit/f6e7b1f08639d1e3c17a52e485ef24fb9980b5d9)\n\n## 2.1.x\n\n### Features\n\n- Added metadata.json files to each package that contains useful data that allows Fontsource or external users to leverage to pull information from. [#26](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/26) [#27](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/27) [#28](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/28)\n- Account for rare possible instance of oblique font-style [#26](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/26)\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Correct src: locals() in CSS generation to reflect upstream source accurately. [#10](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/10) [#11](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/11)\n- Resolve incorrect SCSS documentation + general improvements [#23](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/23)\n- Ensure no old files remain from a font update [#24](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/24)\n- Allow index.css generation for fonts without latin subset [#25](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/pull/25)\n\n## 2.0.x\n\n- Main release.\n"

By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.\n\n- [Contributing to Fontsource](#contributing-to-fontsource)\n  - [Questions](#questions)\n  - [Issues and Pull Requests](#issues-and-pull-requests)\n    - [Submitting an Issue](#submitting-an-issue)\n    - [Submitting a Pull Request (PR)](#submitting-a-pull-request-pr)\n  - [Development](#development)\n    - [Useful Scripts](#useful-scripts)\n    - [Website Development](#website-development)\n  - [Submit Documentation](#submit-documentation)\n\n## Questions\n\nFor general support or questions, please make a [Discussion](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/discussions/new) instead. Issues should be used for bug reports or feature and font requests.\n\n## Issues and Pull Requests\n\n### Submitting an Issue\n\nBefore you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker to prevent duplicates as existing discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.\n\nFor fixing bugs, we need to have the necessary information to reproduce and confirm it. At minimum we would expect device, browser and 3rd-party library usage information, however, it may be necessary to provide a minimal reproducible build for us to reproduce the error. Lack of information may lead to the issue being closed.\n\nYou can file issues by filling out an [issue form](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/issues/new/choose).\n\n### Submitting a Pull Request (PR)\n\n1. Before you submit a PR, please search the repository for an open or closed PR that relates to your submission.\n2. Fork the fontsource/fontsource repository (click the <kbd>Fork</kbd> button at the top right of this page).\n3. Clone the repository locally before creating your own branch.\n\n    ```shell\n    git clone https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource.git\n    git checkout -b my-pr-branch main\n    ```\n\n4. Create your patch or feature addition, **including appropriate test cases in the tests directory**.\n5. Ensure all tests and lints pass.\n6. On GitHub, send a pull request to fontsource:main.\n\n    - If we suggest changes then:\n\n        - Make the required updates.\n        - Re-run the test suites to ensure tests are still passing.\n        - Rebase your branch and force push to your GitHub repository (this will update your PR):\n\n        ```shell\n        git rebase main -i\n        git push -f\n        ```\n\n7. After your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull changes from the main repository.\n\n## Development\n\nFontsource is built completely with Typescript which extends to both the API and website. It uses [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as its package manager.\n\n```shell\nbun install\n```\n\nThe project uses Bun Workspaces, thus the packager, API and website should install in one command.\n\n### Useful Scripts\n\n-   `bun run test` - Runs tests.\n\n### Website Development\n\nMore details can be found in the [README.md](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/tree/main/website#readme) of the `website` directory.\n\n## Submit Documentation\n\nSubmitting new or updating documentation for the Fontsource website is painless and doesn't necessarily require much setup. Navigating to [`website/docs`](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/tree/main/website/docs) should contain a directory of markdown files. Editing those markdown files will reflect onto the website.\n\nPlease note when submitting brand new pages, it would be required to update [`website/src/configs/docsList.json`](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/blob/main/website/src/configs/docsList.json) appropriately for it to reflect on the website sidebar.\n"

This can help to prevent doubled visual load times for simple websites, as benchmarked [here](https://github.com/HTTPArchive/almanac.httparchive.org/pull/607) and [here](https://github.com/reactiflux/reactiflux.com/pull/21).\n\n- Fonts remain **version locked**. Google often pushes updates to their fonts [without notice](https://github.com/google/fonts/issues/1307), which may interfere with your live production projects. Manage your fonts like any other NPM dependency.\n\n- Commit to **privacy**. Google does track the usage of their fonts and for those who are extremely privacy concerned, self-hosting is an alternative.\n\n- Your **fonts load offline**. This feature is beneficial for Progressive Web Apps and situations where you have limited or no access to the internet.\n\n- **Support for fonts outside the Google Font ecosystem**. This repository is constantly evolving with [other Open Source fonts](https://github.com/fontsource/font-files). Feel free to contribute!\n\n## API\n\nCheck out the documentation [here](https://fontsource.org/docs/api/introduction).\n\n## Migrating from previous versions\n\nSee [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for more details.\n\n## Adding New Fonts\n\nFor Open Source fonts that are not automatically updated by the Google ecosystem, we have a generic packager that builds CSS files for the project.\n\nMake a request by creating an [issue](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/issues)!\nIf you wish to submit a PR yourself, check out the documentation on packaging the fonts yourself [here](https://github.com/fontsource/font-files/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Licensing\n\nAlways make sure to read the license for each font you use. Most of the fonts in the collection use the SIL Open Font License, v1.1. Some fonts use the Apache 2 license. The Ubuntu fonts use the Ubuntu Font License v1.0.\n\nYou can find their specific licenses on each package `README.md`.\n\n## Other Notes\n\nFeel free to star and contribute new ideas to this repository that aim to improve the performance of font loading, as well as expanding the existing library we already have. Any suggestions or ideas can be voiced via an [issue](https://github.com/fontsource/fontsource/issues).\n"
