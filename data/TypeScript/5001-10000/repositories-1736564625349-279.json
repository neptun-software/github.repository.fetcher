Please make sure you read and understand them before you contribute. **Note that this isn't set in stone**. Polite debate and suggestions are welcome, as long as it's compliant with the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and it's done with the best interest of the library and the end-users in mind.\n\n## ❓ Should I contribute?\n\nPushing your first contribution can be intimidating. A great way to start is by [fixing issues](https://github.com/dinerojs/dinero.js/issues). Find an open and confirmed issue, and open a pull request that fixes it.\n\n✅ Please do:\n\n- Fix [bugs](https://github.com/dinerojs/dinero.js/issues).\n- Improve performance.\n- Refactor with better design patterns.\n- Improve the build process (speed, error handling, deprecations, etc.)\n- Improve the docs (typos, lack of clarity, etc.)\n\n🚫 Please don't:\n\n- Go against the library's philosophy (immutability, modularity, etc.)\n- Make changes based on personal preferences rather than problem-solving.\n- Develop features that aren't in the scope of the library (if not sure, ask before you code).\n- Introduce breaking changes.\n\n## 💻 Install\n\nThe project relies on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/). It's also recommended to use [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to ensure you're using the right Node.js version.\n\nTo get started, clone the project and install the dependencies from your terminal:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/dinerojs/dinero.js.git\ncd dinero.js\nyarn install\nnvm use\n```\n\n## 🖥️ Project organization\n\nThe project is organized as a monorepo under the `packages/` directory.\n\n```txt\npackages/\n├── calculator-bigint/\n├── calculator-number/\n├── core/\n├── currencies/\n└── dinero.js/\n```\n\n## 📖 Conventions\n\nThe project observes a few rules and conventions when it comes to code. Most of them are automated, but make sure you understand them before submitting changes.\n\n### Commit messages\n\nThe project follows the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) approach to standardize commit messages, generate the changelog and resolve the next version. It means that all commit messages should be formatted using the following scheme:\n\n```txt\ntype(optional scope): subject\n```\n\nAvailable types are:\n\n- `build`: changes affecting the build system or external dependencies\n- `ci`: changes to CI configuration files and scripts\n- `docs`: documentation changes\n- `feat`: a new feature\n- `fix`: a bug fix\n- `perf`: changes improving performance\n- `refactor`: changes that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature\n- `test`: adding or fixing tests\n- `style`: a linting commit\n- `revert`: a revert of a previous commit\n\n### Pull requests\n\nPull requests must target `main`. As with commit messages, pull request titles must follow the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) convention.\n\n### Branch organization\n\nThe project uses two sorts of long-lived branches:\n\n- `main` as the default branch, where the latest version of the project lives\n- `vx` (where `x` is a number, for example, `v1`) to version previous major versions\n\nPull requests should target the `main` branch unless fixing critical issues in previous major versions.\n\n### Tests\n\nThe project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing. **Every public API should be tested**. You should run tests before you commit, or at least before you open a pull request. Pull requests need to pass all checks to be reviewed, so doing it beforehand will save you time.\n\n```sh\nyarn test\n```\n\n### Linting\n\nThe project uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting. Both run automatically when you commit, so you can go ahead and format as you like while writing code; it will be overridden anyway.\n\nIf ESLint finds issues it can't fix, you can fix it manually and try committing again.\n\n## 📚 Documentation\n\nThe project lives in the `website/` directory. You can run it locally:\n\n```sh\nyarn website:dev\n```\n\nAll documentation files live in `website/data/docs/`. They use [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), which is a mix of [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html).\n"

Dinero.js is a JavaScript library that lets you express monetary values, but also perform mutations, conversions, comparisons, formatting, and overall make money manipulation easier and safer in your application.\n\n> ℹ️ Dinero.js v2 is currently in alpha. For v1, check the [`v1` branch](https://github.com/dinerojs/dinero.js/tree/v1) and [docs](https://v1.dinerojs.com/).\n\n## 📦 Install\n\n```sh\nnpm install dinero.js@alpha\n\n# or\n\nyarn add dinero.js@alpha\n```\n\n## ⚡️ Quick start\n\n`Dinero` objects are minimal. Every function in `dinero.js` is side-effect free, allowing you only to bundle exactly what you use.\n\n```js\nimport { USD } from '@dinero.js/currencies';\nimport { dinero, add } from 'dinero.js';\n\nconst d1 = dinero({ amount: 500, currency: USD });\nconst d2 = dinero({ amount: 800, currency: USD });\n\nadd(d1, d2);\n```\n\nCheck out the [quick start guide](https://v2.dinerojs.com/docs/getting-started/quick-start) on the documentation.\n\n## 📚 Documentation\n\nThe documentation lets you learn about all aspects of the library.\n\n- [**Getting started**](https://v2.dinerojs.com/docs/getting-started/quick-start) to get up and running quickly with Dinero.js\n- [**Core concepts**](https://v2.dinerojs.com/docs/core-concepts/amount) to learn about the underlying principles behind the library\n- [**Guides**](https://v2.dinerojs.com/docs/guides/using-different-amount-types) to dig deeper into specific use cases.\n- [**API**](https://v2.dinerojs.com/docs/api/mutations/add) for a comprehensive list of available functions and their parameters.\n- [**FAQ**](https://v2.dinerojs.com/docs/faq/does-dinerojs-support-cryptocurrencies) for common answers to questions you might have\n\nVisit the [full documentation](https://v2.dinerojs.com/docs) to
