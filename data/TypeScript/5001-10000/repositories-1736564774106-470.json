          "content": "# Helm Dashboard Features Overview\n\n## General Layout and Navigation\n\n### Shutting down the app\n\nIf you run the tool locally, you can shutdown the running process. This is useful when you can't find the console where\nyou started it, or when it was started without console.\n\nTo close Helm-dashboard, click on the button in the rightmost corner of the screen. Once you click on it, your\nHelm-dashboard will be shut down.\n\n![Shutdown_screenshot](images/screenshot_shut_down.png)\n\n## Releases Management Section\n\n### Switching Clusters\n\nWhen started as local binary, the tool reads the list of available cluster connections from kubectl config file. Those\nconnections are displayed on the left side of the screen.\n\n![Multicluster_screenshot](images/screenshot_multicluster.png)\n\nIf you want to switch to a different cluster, simply click on the corresponding cluster as shown in the\nfigure. You\ncan [read here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/configure-access-multiple-clusters/) to\nlearn on how to configure access to multiple clusters.\n# Reset Cache\nThe \"Reset Cache\" feature in Helm Dashboard clears the cached data and fetches the latest information from the backend or data source. It ensures that the dashboard displays up-to-date data and reflects any recent changes or updates.\n![Detail1](images/screenshot_reset_cache.png)\n\n# Repository\nEssentially, a repository is a location where charts are gathered and can be shared. If you want to learn more about repositories, [click here](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/chart_repository/). You can find the repository in the home section, as depicted in the figure.\n![Repository3](images/screenshot_repository3.png)\n\nYou can add the repository by clicking on 'Add Repository', as shown in the figure.\n![Repository](images/screenshot_repository.png)\n\n## Installed Releases List\n\nA release is an installation of your Helm chart deployed in your Kubernetes Cluster. That means every time that you\ninstall or upgrade a Helm chart, it creates a new release revision that coexists with other releases. You\ncan filter releases based on namespaces or search for release names\n![Releases](images/screenshot_release.png)\n\nThe squares represent k8s resources installed by the release. Hover over each square to view a tooltip with details.\nYellow indicates \"pending,\" green signifies a healthy state, and red indicates an unhealthy state.\n![Releases1](images/screenshot_release1.png)\n\nIt indicates the version of chart that corresponds to this release.\n![Releases2](images/screenshot_release2.png)\n\nA revision is linked to a release to track the number of updates/changes that release encounters.\n![Releases3](images/screenshot_release3.png)\n\nNamespaces are a way to organize clusters into virtual sub-clusters — they can be helpful when different teams or\nprojects share a Kubernetes cluster. Any number of namespaces are supported within a cluster, each logically separated\nfrom others but with the ability to communicate with each other.\n![Releases4](images/screenshot_release4.png)\n\nUpdated\" refers to the amount of time that has passed since the last revision of the release. Whenever you install or\nupgrade the release, a new revision is created. You can think of it as the \"age\" of the latest revision.\n![Releases5](images/screenshot_release5.png)\n\nIndication of upgrade possible/repo suggested.\n![Release6](images/screenshot_upgrade_available.png)\n\n## Release details\n\nThis indicates the status of the deployed release, and 'Age' represents the amount of time that has passed since the\ncreation of the revision until now.\n![Detail](images/screenshot_release_detail.png)\n\nYou can use the Upgrade/Downgrade button to switch to different release versions, as shown in the figure.\n![Detail1](images/screenshot_upgrade_available2.png)\n\nConfirm the upgrade settings and configuration and click on confirm button to continue\n![Detail2](images/screenshot_upgrade_confirmation.png)\n\nOnce the upgrade is done, your release will show the status \n![Detail3](images/screenshot_upgrade_complete.png)\n\nIt executes the test scripts or commands within the deployed application's environment and displays the results\n![Detail4](images/screenshot_run_tests.png)\n\nRunning test hooks results \n![Detail5](images/screenshot_test_results.png)\n\nThe Helm Dashboard provides basic information about your Helm releases, including revision number, deployment date, release message, cluster details, and deployment status.\n![Detail6](images/screenshot_basic_info.png)\n\n### Resource Tab\n\nIn the Resources tab of the Helm Dashboard, you can view the kind (type), name, status, and any associated messages for your Kubernetes resources.\n![Detail7](images/screenshot_resource.png)\n\n### Manifest Tab\n\nText: The Manifests tab displays the textual representation of the Kubernetes manifests associated with your Helm release. It provides the YAML or JSON configuration files that define the desired state of the resources deployed in your cluster.\n![Detail8](images/screenshot_manifest_view.png)\n\nDiff with Previous: The \"Diff with Previous\" feature allows you to compare the current version of the manifests with the previous version. It highlights the differences between the two versions, making it easier to identify the changes made in the deployment.\n![Detail9](images/screenshot_manifest_diff_prev.png)\n\nDiff with Specific: The \"Diff with Specific\" option enables you to compare the current version of the manifests with a specific past version. It allows you to select a particular revision and view the differences between that revision and the current one.\n![Detail10](images/screenshot_manifest_diff_specific.png)\n\n### Values Tab\n\nText: The Values tab displays the textual representation of the values file associated with your Helm chart. It shows the YAML or JSON file that contains the configuration values used during the deployment of the chart.\n![Detail11](images/screenshot_values_view.png)\n\nDiff: The \"Diff\" feature allows you to compare the current values with the previous values used in a previous deployment. It highlights any differences between the two versions, making it easier to identify changes made to the configuration.\n![Detail12](images/screenshot_values_diff_prev.png)\n\n### Text Tab\n\nText: The Notes tab displays any accompanying notes or documentation related to the Helm chart.\n![Detail14](images/screenshot_notes_view.png)\n\nDiff with previous: The \"Diff\" feature is not typically available in the Notes tab. This tab is primarily meant for viewing the static text-based notes associated with the chart and doesn't involve comparisons or tracking changes like in the Manifests or Values tabs.\n![Detail15](images/screenshot_notes_diff_prev.png)\n\nDiff with Specific Version: Similar to the previous point, the ability to view a diff with a specific version of the notes is not a standard feature in the Notes section of the Helm Dashboard. The Notes section usually presents the information for the specific version of the Helm chart that is currently deployed.\n![Detail16](images/screenshot_notes_diff_specific_version.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Execute Helm tests\n\nFor all the release(s) (installed helm charts), you can execute helm tests for that release. For the tests to execute\nsuccessfully, you need to have existing tests for that helm chart.\n\nYou can execute `helm test` for the specific release as below:\n![](images/screenshot_run_test.png)\n\nThe result of executed `helm test` for the release will be displayed as below:\n![](images/screenshot_run_test_result.png)\n\n### Scanner Integrations\n\nUpon startup, Helm Dashboard detects the presence of [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy)\nand [Checkov](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov) scanners. When available, these scanners are offered on k8s\nresources page, as well as install/upgrade preview page.\n\nYou can request scanning of the specific k8s resource in your cluster:\n![](images/screenshot_scan_resource.png)\n\nIf you want to validate the k8s manifest prior to installing/reconfiguring a Helm chart, look for \"Scan for Problems\"\nbutton at the bottom of the dialog:\n![](images/screenshot_scan_manifest.png)\n\n## Repository Section\n\nEssentially, a repository is a location where charts are gathered and can be shared over network. If you want to learn\nmore about Helm chart\nrepositories, [click here](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/chart_repository/).\n\nYou can access the repository management area of Helm Dashboard in the main navigation section, as depicted in the\nfigure.\n\n![Repository3](images/screenshot_repository3.png)\n\nYou can add the repository by clicking on 'Add Repository' button on the left, as shown in the figure.\n![Repository](images/screenshot_repository.png)\n\nAfter completing that step, enter the following data: the repository name and its URL. You can also add the username and\npassword, although this is optional.\n![Repository2](images/screenshot_repository2.png)\n\nUpdating means refreshing your repository. You can update your repository as shown in the figure.\n![Repository4](images/screenshot_repository4.png)\n\nIf you want to remove your repository from the Helm dashboard, click on the 'Remove' button as shown in the figure.\n![Repository5](images/screenshot_repository5.png)\n\nUse the filter option to find the desired chart quicker from the list of charts.\n![Repository6](images/screenshot_repository6.png)\n\nIf you want to install a particular chart, simply hover the pointer over the chart name and an 'Install' button will\nappear, as shown in the figure.\n![Repository7](images/screenshot_repository7.png)\n\n# Support for Local Charts\n\nLocal Helm chart is a directory with specially named files and a `Chart.yaml` file, which you can install via Helm,\nwithout the need to publish the chart into Helm repository. Chart developers might want to experiment with the chart\nlocally, before uploading into public repository. Also, a proprietary application might only use non-published chart as\nan approach to deploy the software.\n\nFor all the above use-cases, you may use Helm Dashboard UI, specifying the location of your local chart folders via\nspecial `--local-chart` command-line parameter. The parameter might be specified multiple times, for example:\n\n```shell\nhelm-dashboard --local-chart=/opt/charts/my-private-app --local-chart=/home/dev/sources/app/chart\n```\n\nWhen _valid_ local chart sources specified, the repository list would contain a surrogate `[local]` entry, with those\ncharts listed inside. All the chart operations are normal: installing, reconfiguring and upgrading.\n\n![](images/screenshot_local_charts.png)\n\n"

It also allows users to perform simple actions such as rolling back to a\nrevision or upgrading to a newer version.\nThis project is part of [Komodor's](https://komodor.com/?utm_campaign=Helm-Dash&utm_source=helm-dash-gh) vision to\nhelp Kubernetes users to navigate and troubleshoot their clusters. It is important to note that Helm Dashboard is **NOT** an official project by the [helm team](https://helm.sh/).\n\nKey capabilities of the tool:\n\n- See all installed charts and their revision history\n- See manifest diff of the past revisions\n- Browse k8s resources resulting from the chart\n- Easy rollback or upgrade version with a clear and easy manifest diff\n- Integration with popular problem scanners\n- Easy switch between multiple clusters\n- Can be used locally, or installed into Kubernetes cluster\n- Does not require Helm or Kubectl installed\n\nAll the features of the tool can be discovered via our [features overview page](FEATURES.md).\n\n## Installation\n\n### Standalone Binary\n\nSince version 1.0, the recommended install method is to just use standalone binary. It does not require Helm or kubectl to be installed.\n\nDownload the appropriate [release package](https://github.com/komodorio/helm-dashboard/releases) for your platform, unpack it and just run `dashboard` binary from it. See below section for some more CLI parameters to use.\n\n### Using Helm plugin manager\n\nTo install dashboard as Helm plugin, simply run Helm command:\n\n```shell\nhelm plugin install https://github.com/komodorio/helm-dashboard.git\n```\n\nTo update the plugin to the latest version, run:\n\n```shell\nhelm plugin update dashboard\n```\n\nTo uninstall, run:\n\n```shell\nhelm plugin uninstall dashboard\n```\n\nTo use the plugin, your machine needs to have working `helm` and also `kubectl` commands. Helm version 3.4.0+ is required.\n\nAfter installing, start the UI by running:\n\n```shell\nhelm dashboard\n```\n\nThe command above will launch the local Web server and will open the UI in a new browser tab. The command will hang\nwaiting for you to terminate it in command-line or web UI.\n\nYou can see the list of available command-line flags by running `helm dashboard --help`.\n\nBy default, the web server is only available locally. You can change that by specifying `HD_BIND` environment variable\nto the desired value. For example, `0.0.0.0` would bind to all IPv4 addresses or `[::0]` would be all IPv6 addresses.\nThis can also be specified using flag `--bind <host>`, for example `--bind=0.0.0.0` or `--bind 0.0.0.0`.\n\n> Precedence order: flag `--bind=<host>` > env `HD_BIND=<host>` > default value `localhost`\n\nIf your port 8080 is busy, you can specify a different port to use via `--port <number>` command-line flag.\n\nIf you need to limit the operations to a specific namespace, please use `--namespace=...` in your command-line. You can specify multiple namespaces, separated by commas.\n\nIf you don't want the browser tab to automatically open, add `--no-browser` flag in your command line.\n\nIf you want to increase the logging verbosity and see all the debug info, use the `--verbose` flag.\n\n> Disclaimer: For the sake of improving the project quality, there is user analytics collected by the tool. You can disable this collecting with `--no-analytics` option. The collection is done via DataDog RUM and Heap Analytics. Only the anonymous data is collected, no sensitive information is used.\n\n### Deploying Helm Dashboard on Kubernetes\n\nThe official helm chart is [available here](https://github.com/komodorio/helm-charts/blob/master/charts/helm-dashboard)\n\n## Support Channels\n\nWe have two main channels for supporting the Helm Dashboard\nusers: [Slack community](https://komodorkommunity.slack.com) for general conversations\nand [GitHub issues](https://github.com/komodorio/helm-dashboard/issues) for real bugs.\n\n## Contributing\n\nKindly read our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn and understand about our development process, how to propose bug fixes and improvements, and how to build and test your changes to Helm Dashboard. <br>\n\n## Contributors\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/komodorio/helm-dashboard/graphs/contributors\">\n  <img src=\"https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=komodorio/helm-dashboard\" />\n</a>\n\n## Local Dev Testing\n\nPrerequisites, binaries installed and operational:\n\n- [Golang](https://go.dev/doc/install)\n- Node.js\n\nThere is a need to build frontend and then backend as a series of commands, run:\n\n### Linux\n\n```shell\ncd frontend && npm run build && cd ..\ngo build -o bin/dashboard .\n```\n\nOr just `make build` that will do everything inside.\n\nThen, you can run `npm run dev` from `frontend` directory to work on frontend with Vite hot reload.\n\n### Windows\n\n```bat\ncd frontend && npm run build && cd ..\ngo build -o bin\\dashboard.exe .\n```\n\nYou can just run the `dashboard` or `dashboard.exe` binary directly.\n\nTo install, checkout the source code and run from source dir:\n\n```shell\nhelm plugin install .\n```\n\nA local installation of the plugin just creates a symlink, so making the changes and rebuilding the binary would not require\nto\nreinstall a plugin.\n\nTo use the plugin, run in your terminal:\n\n```shell\nhelm dashboard\n```\n\nThen, use the web UI.\n\n## Development Snapshots\n\nIn our GitHub actions, we attach the built binaries as build artifacts, you can download and test it fully assembled.\n\nAlso, we upload `unstable` tag for Docker image upon every build of `main` branch, you can make our Helm chart to use that image by providing values:\n\n```yaml\nimage:\n  pullPolicy: Always\n  tag: unstable\n```\n"
