If you were using this tag please update to use `ghcr.io/browserless/chromium`!\n  - This Chrome tag uses the new routing convention below. If you get random 404's, please add `/chrome` to the start of the route. EG, `/pdf` becomes `/chrome/pdf`.\n  - Websocket connections follow a similar breakage in that the URL will go from something like `ws://localhost:3000` to `ws://localhost:3000/chrome`.\n- Adds a new `ghcr.io/browserless/chromium`, and updates `ghcr.io/browserless/chrome` to use actual Chrome.\n- New and current APIs now follow a routing convention of `/$BROWSER/$ACTION`. In our Chrome image, you'll see `/chrome/pdf` for the PDF route as opposed to `/pdf`.\n  - To keep things backwards compatible, all our prior REST APIs still have the same path as well as the new semantic, but only in the `multi` and `chromium` tags.\n  - These backwards compatible routes are ONLY available in `ghcr.io/browserless/chromium` and `ghcr.io/browserless/multi`.\n- Refer to the embedded documentation site for any and all updates on API differences.\n\n**Other Changes**\n\n- HTTPRoutes and WebSocket routes can now have multiple paths to listen on.\n- Add `clean` command to `@browserless.io/browserless` CLI.\n- Adds support for `/json/list`, `/json/new`, `/json/version` and `json/protocol` APIs (Chrome and Chromium only).\n  - When both Chrome and Chromium are present (in the case of the multi image), browserless opts for Chromium for these requests.\n- Removes legacy `browser.json` files since browserless now generates those and caches when requested.\n- Stable docker images are coming! Please be sure to see our packages page for stable tags.\n- Only verify that internally managed browsers are installed when starting.\n- Preliminary support for `--headless=shell`.\n- More unit-tests for the Chrome /json APIs.\n- Dependency updates.\n\n# [v2.1.0](https://github.com/browserless/browserless/compare/v2.0.0-beta-1...v2.1.0)\n\n- Dependency updates.\n- Name is now `@browserless.io/browserless` to reflect our npm package.\n- NEW: SDK is now live here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@browserless.io/browserless.\n- Drops gulp and other gulp utilities in favor of our own. Move to modules in `scripts` dir.\n- Many private class properties now use `protected` so they can be referenced in SDK extensions.\n- Adds a `/json/version` route for older libraries that use it.\n- Merge startup/test scripts into `scripts` dir.\n- Moves installed browsers to `/usr/local/bin/playwright-browsers`.\n- Merge root files into package.json where possible.\n- README updates and fixes.\n- Numerous link and copyright fixes.\n\n# [v2.0.0](https://github.com/browserless/chrome/compare/master...feat/browserless-2.0)\n\nbrowserless 2.0.0 represents the best body of work after running browserless for over 5 years. It contains mostly the same functionality and more, and is rebuilt to be more modular and offer a NodeJS SDK. It's also much lighter and faster than prior versions and includes a lot of semantic changes.\n\n## Features\n\n- ECMAScript style module loading and dependencies.\n- New routing system using purely NodeJS's HTTP module.\n- Better logs and concurrency/queueing parameters.\n- Support for running the other major browser vendors in the same format and package.\n- The service now compiles TypeScript to runtime JOI validation for our routes.\n- Soon: upcoming support for extensions, long-running sessions and more.\n\n## Breaking Changes\n\n- Remove support for Selenium.\n- The `/function` API now runs inside the context of the browser and not in Node.\n- Drop support for keep-alive and pre-booting.\n- Support for a single `launch` query-string parameter for launching a browser versus many individual parameters.\n\n## Minor Changes\n\n- Many docker parameters have been renamed, but are backwards compatible. See config.ts for details.\n\n# [v1.61.0](https://github.com/browserless/chrome/compare/v1.60.2...v1.61.0)\n\n- **FINAL of V1 for browserless/chrome.

Both use-cases are tightly coupled to the file-system, and can leave you scratching your head as to what's going one. For more information and detailed documentation, please refer to our doc-site at https://www.browserless.io/\n\n## Minor Changes\n\n- New `WORKSPACE_DIR` variable for controlling where browserless stores files and uploads.\n- New `/workspace` API for doing RESTful operations on the downloads/uploads file-system.\n- New `/download` API for running a puppeteer-script, and responding with the resulting downloaded file.\n\n## Internal Changes\n\n- Moved routes out of the browserless module and into their own file/module.\n- Renamed the `browserless-web-service` module to just `browserless` for simplicity.\n- Moved the `DOWNLOAD_DIR` to `WORKSPACE_DIR` since it handles both uploads and downloads.\n\n# 1.0.0\n\n🥁 -- Stable version 1.0 is here! While this doesn't include major functionality changes, it _does_ change how the docker builds are generated going forward. The versioning will now contain two pieces of crucial information: the version of the _browserless_ service + the version of Chrome under-the-hood. For instance `1.2.3-puppeteer-1.10.0` is browserless at `1.2.3`, exposing puppeteer at `1.10.0`.\n\nSimilar to how NodeJS itself does docker releases, we'll now provide releases in 3 distinct ways:\n\n- An _immutable_, pinned version release: `1.0.0-puppeteer-1.11.0`\n- A mutable minor version release: `1.1-puppeteer-1.12.0`\n- A mutable major version release: `1-puppeteer-1.9.0`\n\nFor production deployments, we recommend using _pinned_ version releases as they won't change once released. The mutable minor/major releases will receive on-going updates whenever we do changes that are bug-fixes or feature release. Even with the best intentions it's possible that instability can be introduced with these mutable images, hence why recommend the pinned version releases.\n\nFinally, we'll continue to ship support for the last 5 minor versions of Puppeteer + the Google Chrome (stable). Old images will remain, but newer versions of browserless won't be included.\n\nWe'll continue to keep this changelog up-to-date anytime we do docker releases.\n"

It's a complete rewrite of the core of browserless, and many things have changed. To keep things short, this rewrite allows us to support many new things which you can read about in these articles:\n\n- [Announcing v2](https://www.browserless.io/blog/2023/12/06/browserless-2-0/)\n- [How and why we rebuilt Browserless](https://www.browserless.io/blog/2024/02/28/v2-sdk/)\n- [How to use the v2 SDK](https://www.browserless.io/blog/2024/02/28/v2-sdk/)\n\nThis document serves as a guide to migrate existing systems from browserless 1.x to 2.x. New features are not covered in this guide, but we do recommend checking the new things outBelow is a table of contents from which you can pick to better aide in migrating your existing codebase or REST calls.\n\nFor the most comprehensive documentation, feel free to visit the built-in doc-site located at `/docs` route. Browserless also logs this on startup for help.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Design Changes and overall goals](#design-changes-and-overall-goals)\n- [List of Major and Potentially Breaking Changes](#list-of-major-and-potentially-breaking-changes)\n- [Docker](#docker)\n  - [Removed parameters (no replacements)](#removed-parameters-no-replacements)\n  - [Changed Parameters](#changed-parameters)\n  - [Other Changes](#other-changes)\n- [Libraries](#libraries)\n  - [Launch flags](#launch-flags)\n  - [Headless flags](#headless-flags)\n- [/function](#function)\n  - [Basic Request](#basic-request)\n  - [Request with requires](#request-with-requires)\n- [/pdf](#pdf)\n- [/screenshot](#screenshot)\n- [/scrape](#scrape)\n- [/stats](#stats)\n- [/screencast](#screencast)\n- [/config](#config)\n\n## Design Changes and overall goals\n\nbrowserless 2.xx was designed and developed for the sole purpose of making browser behavior more deterministic. We want to make the process of operating a headless browser stack more developer-friendly since these workflows can often be frustrating to work with. What do we mean by this? Here's a few points\n\n- Unknown parameters will fail with 4xx errors since they're unrecognized.\n- No more pre-booting or keep-alive as they can cause so many problems.\n- A typescript-first workflow. All routes are strongly typed with a prescriptive approach so you can add your own.\n- Forcing of best practices: we generate a unique TOKEN when none is present, meaning you *must* have a token at all times.\n- Better logging and built-in doc-site with all parameters and definitions.\n- Enhanced and comprehensive security.\n\nThis, in combination with the past 5+ years experience in headless, means there's several things that are different in browserless 2.xx. Please refer to the above Table of Contents to find the most relevant information for your API, library or use-case.\n\nFinally, browserless does its best to be friendly and helpful by logging things like out-of-date parameters and configuration. Please be sure to read through logs when migrating existing workflows over and we'll continue to improve these messages as time goes on.\n\n## List of Major and Potentially Breaking Changes\n\n- Drop support for Selenium and Webdriver.\n- Many docker environment variable changes (see below).\n- Drop support for DEFAULT_* arguments.\n- Drop support for pre-booting and keep-alive.\n- TOKEN is now randomly generated when none is present to enforce some authentication.\n- When using custom launch flags for APIs and Libraries: please update to the new format which is a consolidated `&launch` parameter.\n- Playwright's Chromium path is now `/chromium/playwright` in order to reflect other browsers in different paths.\n- Unknown query parameters or JSON POST parameters will now respond with a 4xx error.\n- New `/function` API environment and uses Ecmascript modules. We no longer run /function calls in the NodeJS environment, and instead run inside the browser's JavaScript runtime. `import` does work and loads modules over HTTP instead of locally.\n- `blockAds` now uses Ublock Origin to facilitate ad-blocking. No more request interception.\n- The prior `/stats` API is now located at `/performance`.\n\n## Docker\n\nMultiple environment variables have changed for simplicity and clarity in 2.0, but act similar in functionality to prior environment variables. We did remove a few due to their ability to cause issues, bad performance, and non-deterministic behavior.\n\nbrowserless does it's best to log these old or deprecated environment variables, so be sure to read those out when using the new 2.0 builds.\n\n### Removed parameters (no replacements)\n\n- CHROME_REFRESH_TIME: No longer support pre-booted chrome.\n- DEFAULT_BLOCK_ADS: Use `blockAds` in your API or library connect calls.\n- DEFAULT_DUMPIO: Use `dumpio` in the launch arguments in your API or library connect calls.\n- DEFAULT_HEADLESS: Use `headless: false` in your API or library connect calls.\n- DEFAULT_IGNORE_DEFAULT_ARGS: Use `ignoreDefaultArgs` in your API or library connect calls.\n- DEFAULT_IGNORE_HTTPS_ERRORS: Use `ignoreHTTPSErrors` your API or library connect calls.\n- DEFAULT_LAUNCH_ARGS: Use the `args` option in your API or library connect calls.\n- DEFAULT_STEALTH: Use the `stealth` option in your API or library connect calls.\n- DISABLED_FEATURES: Fully ignored and deprecated.\n- ENABLE_HEAP_DUMP: No longer supported.\n- FUNCTION_BUILT_INS: No longer supported with the new function implementation.\n- FUNCTION_ENABLE_INCOGNITO_MODE: No longer supported.\n- FUNCTION_ENV_VARS: No longer supported.\n- FUNCTION_EXTERNALS: No longer supported with the new function implementation.\n- KEEP_ALIVE: No more pre-booting or keep-alive allowed.\n- PREBOOT_CHROME: No more pre-booting or keep-alive allowed.\n- PRINT_GET_STARTED_LINKS: Ignored\n- WORKSPACE_DELETE_EXPIRED: No more workspace since most libraries do this now.\n- WORKSPACE_DIR: No more workspace since most libraries do this now.\n- WORKSPACE_EXPIRE_DAYS: No more workspace since most libraries do this now.\n\n### Changed Parameters\n\nBrowserless will log these and replace them for you internally, but feel free to update these in order to prevent further logged messages:\n\n- `CONNECTION_TIMEOUT`: Is now: `TIMEOUT`\n- `DEFAULT_USER_DATA_DIR`: Is now: `DATA_DIR`\n- `ENABLE_API_GET`: Is now: `ALLOW_GET`\n- `ENABLE_CORS`: Is now: `CORS`\n- `MAX_CONCURRENT_SESSIONS`: Is now: `CONCURRENT`\n- `PRE_REQUEST_HEALTH_CHECK`: Is now: `HEALTH`\n- `PROXY_URL`: Is now: `EXTERNAL`\n- `QUEUE_LENGTH`: Is now: `QUEUED`\n- `TOKEN`: Remains `TOKEN` but is randomly generated when none is present.\n\n### Other Changes\n\nWe have changed where we serve our Docker images from docker hub to Github's container registry. Please use the `ghcr.io/browserless` or look at our open our [Packages page](https://github.com/orgs/browserless/packages).\n\n## Libraries\n\nWe tried to keep library changes as little as possible since the compromise the core of the platform. However, one change is the consolidation of *all* launch options into a single query string parameter of a JSON-stringified \"launch\". Connect calls are now more strict with query parameters. Any unknown parameter will cause connect calls to fail since they aren't supported by browserless. In version 1.xx unknown parameters were simply ignored.\n\nbrowserless 2.xx shims old launch options query parameters internally, so it'll fix 1.xx requests for you. Here's a few examples of this so you can make any changes in code.\n\nIt is *highly recommended* the parameters after `launch=` be base64 for proper recognition. Failure to base64 encode will nearly guarantee these parameters are not accepted if they have characters such as curly braces or brackets.\n\n### Launch flags\n\n**Before**\n`ws://localhost:3000?token=ABCD&--window-size=1920,1080`\n\n**After**\n`ws://localhost:3000?token=ABCD&launch={\"args\":[\"--window-size=1920,108\"]}`\n\n### Headless flags\n\n**Before**\n`ws://localhost:3000?token=ABCD&headless=shell`\n\n**After**\n`ws://localhost:3000?token=ABCD&launch={\"headless\":\"shell\"}`\n\n## /function\n\nThe biggest difference in the function API is that it no longer operates inside of the NodeJS runtime, but in the browser. It also supports ECMAScript modules, so you'll have to tweak existing code to work inside 2.xx. This is a fairly large change, and any /function calls should be well tested prior to deploying them into production.\n\nThe function API is still hybrid in that it can accept a JavaScript file (with content-type application/javascript) OR a JSON file with `code` and `context` properties. Be sure to read more about it on the built-in doc-site.\n\nBrowserless also now infers the appropriate response type so you no longer need to specify it. Simply return whatever data you wish and it'll write the request appropriately.\n\nbrowserless 2.xx shims old launch options query parameters internally, so it'll fix 1.xx-style requests for you.\n\n### Basic Request\n\n**Before**\n\n```js\n// CommonJS no longer supported\nmodule.exports = async({ page }) => {\n  await page.goto('https://example.com');\n\n  // No longer need to response with this object schematic\n  return {\n    data: await page.screenshot(),\n    type: 'image/png',\n  };\n}\n```\n\n**After**\n\n```js\n// Use the \"export default\" keywords\nexport default async({ page }) => {\n  await page.goto('https://example.com');\n  // No longer need to tell what type\n  return await page.screenshot();\n}\n```\n\n### Request with requires\n\n**Before**\n\n```js\n// npm packages are no longer supported\nconst url = require('url');\n\nmodule.exports = async({ page }) => {\n  await page.goto('https://example.com');\n  const links = await page.evaluate(() => [...document.querySelectorAll('a')].map(l => l.href));\n  const parsed = links.map((link) => url.parse(link));\n\n  return {\n    data: parsed,\n    type: 'application/json',\n  };\n}\n```\n\n**After**\n\n```js\nexport default async({ page }) => {\n  await page.goto('https://example.com');\n  const links = await page.evaluate(() => [...document.querySelectorAll('a')].map(l => l.href));\n\n  // Can use URL and other browser-based APIs as well as load them\n  // with `import` syntax from hosts like unpkg\n  const parsed = links.map((link) => new URL(link));\n\n  return parsed;\n}\n```\n\n## /pdf\n\nThe PDF API operates in a similar fashion as the in browserless 1.xx. The biggest difference is how launch flags are handled, which now use a consolidated `launch` object to hold all CLI arguments and flags.\n\n`waitFor` has now been removed and deprecated in favor of puppeteer's discrete API methods: `waitForEvent`, `waitForFunction`, `waitForSelector` and `waitForTimeout`.\n\n`rotate` has been removed due to lack of usage and included 3rd party dependencies. `safeMode` has also been removed in favor of using puppeteer's streaming capabilities that are much less error-prone.\n\n## /screenshot\n\nThe /screenshot API operates very similarly to how it did in browserless 1.xx. A few properties and options have been removed due to their infrequent usage and 3rd party dependencies.\n\n`waitFor` has now been removed and deprecated in favor of puppeteer's discrete API methods: `waitForEvent`, `waitForFunction`, `waitForSelector` and `waitForTimeout`.\n\n`manipulate` has also been removed since it was infrequently used and required numerous other dependencies in order to run properly.\n\n## /scrape\n\nThe /scrape API operates similarly to how it did in browserless 1.xx. A few properties and options have been removed due to their infrequent usage and 3rd party dependencies.\n\n`waitFor` has now been removed and deprecated in favor of puppeteer's discrete API methods: `waitForEvent`, `waitForFunction`, `waitForSelector` and `waitForTimeout`.\n\n## /stats\n\nThe /stats API has been moved to /performance now to better reflect the action its doing since the word \"stats\" in this context can be ambiguous. Internally, it still runs lighthouse reports and you can provide various configurations to it.\n\n## /screencast\n\nThe /screencast API has been removed in favor of a library-based approach.\n\nPlease refer to the built-in doc-site for how to do screencasting or consult your library of choice for how to screencast.\n\n## /config\n\nThe /config API now returns more meta-data about the instance including more parameters. Please visit the internal doc-site page to see the JSON response and all the properties.\n"

You can find it here](https://github.com/browserless/chrome/tree/v1), although we recommend [migrating](/MIGRATION-2.0.md) to v2.\n\nBrowserless allows remote clients to connect and execute headless work, all inside of docker. It supports the standard, unforked Puppeteer and Playwright libraries, as well offering REST-based APIs for common actions like data collection, PDF generation and more.\n\nWe take care of common issues such as missing system-fonts, missing external libraries, and performance improvements, along with edge-cases like downloading files and managing sessions. For details, check out the documentation site built into the project which includes Open API docs.\n\nIf you've been struggling to deploy headless browsers without running into issues or bloated resource requirements, then Browserless was built for you. Run the browsers in [our cloud](https://browserless.io/) or your own, [free for non-commercial uses](https://github.com/browserless/browserless#licensing).\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [External links](#external-links)\n- [Features](#features)\n- [How it works](#how-it-works)\n  - [Docker](#docker)\n  - [Hosting Providers](#hosting-providers)\n  - [Puppeteer](#puppeteer)\n  - [Playwright](#playwright)\n- [Extending (NodeJS SDK)](#extending-nodejs-sdk)\n- [Debugger](#debugger)\n  - [Install debugger](#install-debugger)\n- [Usage with other libraries](#usage-with-other-libraries)\n- [Motivations](#motivations)\n- [Licensing](#licensing)\n\n## External links\n\n1. [Full documentation site](https://docs.browserless.io/)\n2. [Live Debugger (using browserless.io)](https://chrome.browserless.io/)\n3. [Docker](https://github.com/browserless/browserless/pkgs/container/base)\n\n## Features\n\n### General\n\n- Parallelism and request-queueing are built-in + configurable.\n- Fonts and emoji's working out-of-the-box.\n- Debug Viewer for actively viewing/debugging running sessions.\n- An interactive puppeteer debugger, so you can see what the headless browser is doing and use its DevTools.\n- Works with unforked Puppeteer and Playwright.\n- Configurable session timers and health-checks to keep things running smoothly.\n- Error tolerant: if Chrome dies it won't.\n- Support for running and development on Apple's M1 machines\n\n### Cloud-only\n\nOur [cloud accounts](https://www.browserless.io/pricing/) include all the general features plus extras, such as:\n\n- Inbuilt [residential proxy](https://www.browserless.io/blog/residential-proxying/)\n- [/unblock API](https://www.browserless.io/blog/unblock-api) for avoiding detectors\n- [Automated captcha solving](https://www.browserless.io/blog/captcha-solving) for getting past mandatory checks\n- [Hybrid automations](https://www.browserless.io/blog/hybrid-automations-for-puppeteer/) for streaming login windows during scripts\n- [/reconnect API](https://www.browserless.io/blog/reconnect-api) for keeping browsers alive for reuse\n- [REST APIs](https://www.browserless.io/feature/rest-apis) for tasks such as retrieving HTML, PDFs or Lighthouse metrics\n- SSO, tokens and user roles\n\n## How it works\n\nBrowserless listens for both incoming websocket requests, generally issued by most libraries, as well as pre-build REST APIs to do common functions (PDF generation, images and so on). When a websocket connects to Browserless it starts Chrome and proxies your request into it. Once the session is done then it closes and awaits for more connections. Some libraries use Chrome's HTTP endpoints, like `/json` to inspect debug-able targets, which Browserless also supports.\n\nYou still execute the script itself which gives you total control over what library you want to choose and when to do upgrades. This also comes with the benefit of keep your code proprietary and able to run on numerous platforms. We simply take care of all the browser-aspects and offer a management layer on top of the browser.\n\n### Docker\n\n> [!TIP]\n> See more options on our [full documentation site](https://docs.browserless.io/docker/quickstart).\n\n1. `docker run -p 3000:3000 ghcr.io/browserless/chromium`\n2. Visit `http://localhost:3000/docs` to see the documentation site.\n3. See more at our [docker package](https://github.com/browserless/browserless/pkgs/container/base).\n\n### Hosting Providers\n\nWe offer a first-class hosted product located [here](https://browserless.io). Alternatively you can host this image on just about any major platform that offers hosting for docker. Our hosted service takes care of all the machine provisioning, notifications, dashboards and monitoring plus more:\n\n- Easily upgrade and toggle between versions at the press of a button. No managing repositories and other code artifacts.\n- Never need to update or pull anything from docker. There's literally zero software to install to get started.\n- Scale your consumption up or down with different plans. We support up to thousands of concurrent sessions at a given time.\n\nIf you're interested in using this image for commercial aspects, then please read the below section on licensing.\n\n### Puppeteer\n\nPuppeteer allows you to specify a remote location for chrome via the `browserWSEndpoint` option. Setting this for Browserless is a single line of code change.\n\n**Before**\n\n```js\nconst browser = await puppeteer.launch();\n```\n\n**After**\n\n```js\nconst browser = await puppeteer.connect({\n  browserWSEndpoint: 'ws://localhost:3000',\n});\n```\n\n### Playwright\n\nWe support running with playwright via their their browser's remote connection protocols interface out of the box. Just make sure that your Docker image, playwright browser type _and_ endpoint match:\n\n**Before**\n\n```js\nimport pw from \"playwright\";\nconst browser = await pw.firefox.launch();\n```\n\n**After**\n\n```sh\ndocker run -p 3000:3000 ghcr.io/browserless/firefox\n# or ghcr.io/browserless/multi for all the browsers\n```\n\n```js\nimport pw from \"playwright-core\";\n\nconst browser = await pw.firefox.connect(\n  'ws://localhost:3000/firefox/playwright',\n);\n```\n\nAfter that, the rest of your code remains the same with no other changes required.\n\n## Extending (NodeJS SDK)\n\nBrowserless comes with built-in extension capabilities, and allows for extending nearly any aspect of the system (for Version 2+). For more details on how to write your own routes, build docker images, and more, [see our SDK README.md](/bin/scaffold/README.md) or simply run \"npx @browserless.io/browserless create\" in a terminal and follow the onscreen prompts.\n\n## Debugger\n\nYou can install a first-party interactive debugger for Browserless, that makes writing scripts faster and interactive. You can take advantage of things like `debugger;` calls and the page's console output to see what's happening on the page while your script is running. All of the Chrome devtools are there at your disposal.\n\n![browserless.io logo](/assets/debugger.png)\n\nA small list of features includes:\n\n- Running `debugger;` and `console.log` calls\n- Errors in the script are caught and show up in the console tab\n- DOM inspection, watch network requests, and even see how the page is rendering\n- Exporting you debugging script as a Node project\n- Everything included in Chrome DevTools\n\n### Install debugger\n\nInstalling the debugger is as simple as running the `install:debugger` script _after_ the project has been built. This way:\n\n```sh\n$ npm run build\n$ npm run install:debugger #or npm install:dev\n```\n\nYou will then see the debugger url during the startup process.\n\n```log\n---------------------------------------------------------\n| browserless.io\n| To read documentation and more, load in your browser:\n|\n| OpenAPI: http://localhost:3000/docs\n| Full Documentation: https://docs.browserless.io/\n| Debbuger: http://localhost:3000/debugger/?token=6R0W53R135510\n---------------------------------------------------------\n```\n\n## Usage with other libraries\n\nMost libraries allow you to specify a remote instance of Chrome to interact with. They are either looking for a websocket endpoint, a host and port, or some address. Browserless supports these by default, however if you're having issues please make an issue in this project and we'll try and work with the library authors to get them integrated with browserless. Please note that in V2 we no longer support selenium or webdriver integrations.\n\nYou can find a much larger list of supported libraries [on our documentation site](https://docs.browserless.io/libraries/puppeteer).\n\n## Motivations\n\nRunning Chrome on lambda or on your own is a fantastic idea but in practice is quite challenging in production. You're met with pretty tough cloud limits, possibly building Chrome yourself, and then dealing with odd invocation issues should everything else go ok. A lot of issues in various repositories are due to just challenges of getting Chrome running smoothly in AWS (see [here](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Acomments-desc)). You can see for yourself by going to nearly any library and sorting issues by most commented.\n\nGetting Chrome running well in docker is also a challenge as there's quiet a few packages you need in order to get Chrome running. Once that's done then there's still missing fonts, getting libraries to work with it, and having limitations on service reliability. This is also ignoring CVEs, access-controls, and scaling strategies.\n\nAll of these issues prompted us to build a first-class image and workflow for interacting with Chrome in a more streamlined way. With Browserless you never have to worry about fonts, extra packages, library support, security, or anything else. It just works reliably like any other modern web service. On top of that it comes with a prescribed approach on how you interact with Chrome, which is through socket connections (similar to a database or any other external appliance). What this means is that you get the ability to drive Chrome remotely without having to do updates/releases to the thing that runs Chrome since it's divorced from your application.\n\n## Licensing\n\nSPDX-License-Identifier: SSPL-1.0 OR Browserless Commercial License.\n\nIf you want to use Browserless to build commercial sites, applications, or in a continuous-integration system that's closed-source then you'll need to purchase a commercial license. This allows you to keep your software proprietary whilst still using browserless. [You can purchase a commercial license here](https://www.browserless.io/contact). A commercial license grants you:\n\n- Priority support on issues and features.\n- On-premise running as well as running on public cloud providers for commercial/CI purposes for proprietary systems.\n- Ability to modify the source (forking) for your own purposes.\n- A new admin user-interface.\n\nNot only does it grant you a license to run such a critical piece of infrastructure, but you are also supporting further innovation in this space and our ability to contribute to it.\n\nIf you are creating an open source application under a license compatible with the Server Side License 1.0, you may use Browserless under those terms.\n"
