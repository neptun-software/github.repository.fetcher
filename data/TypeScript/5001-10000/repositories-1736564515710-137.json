The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Most implementation code in `packages/pds`, with runtime wrapper in `services/pds`. See [bluesky-social/pds](https://github.com/bluesky-social/pds) for directions on self-hosting.\n- `bsky`: AppView implementation of the `app.bsky.*` API endpoints. Running on main network at `api.bsky.app`. Most implementation code in `packages/bsky`, with runtime wrapper in `services/bsky`.\n\n**Lexicons:** for both the `com.atproto.*` and `app.bsky.*` are canonically versioned in this repo, for now, under `./lexicons/`. These are JSON files in the [Lexicon schema definition language](https://atproto.com/specs/lexicon), similar to JSON Schema or OpenAPI.\n\n**Interoperability Test Data:** the language-neutral test files in `./interop-test-files/` may be useful for other protocol implementations to ensure that they follow the specification correctly\n\nThe source code for the Bluesky Social client app (for web and mobile) can be found at [bluesky-social/social-app](https://github.com/bluesky-social/social-app).\n\nGo programming language source code is in [bluesky-social/indigo](https://github.com/bluesky-social/indigo), including the BGS implementation.\n\n## Developer Quickstart\n\nWe recommend [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for managing Node.js installs. This project requires Node.js version 18. `pnpm` is used to manage the workspace of multiple packages. You can install it with `npm install --global pnpm`.\n\nThere is a Makefile which can help with basic development tasks:\n\n```shell\n# use existing nvm to install node 18 and pnpm\nmake nvm-setup\n\n# pull dependencies and build all local packages\nmake deps\nmake build\n\n# run the tests, using Docker services as needed\nmake test\n\n# run a local PDS and AppView with fake test accounts and data\n# (this requires a global installation of `jq` and `docker`)\nmake run-dev-env\n\n# show all other commands\nmake help\n```\n\n## About AT Protocol\n\nThe Authenticated Transfer Protocol (\"ATP\" or \"atproto\") is a decentralized social media protocol, developed by [Bluesky PBC](https://bsky.social). Learn more at:\n\n- [Overview and Guides](https://atproto.com/guides/overview) 👈 Best starting point\n- [Github Discussions](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/discussions) 👈 Great place to ask questions\n- [Protocol Specifications](https://atproto.com/specs/atp)\n- [Blogpost on self-authenticating data structures](https://bsky.social/about/blog/3-6-2022-a-self-authenticating-social-protocol)\n\nThe Bluesky Social application encompasses a set of schemas and APIs built in the overall AT Protocol framework. The namespace for these \"Lexicons\" is `app.bsky.*`.\n\n## Contributions\n\n> While we do accept contributions, we prioritize high quality issues and pull requests. Adhering to the below guidelines will ensure a more timely review.\n\n**Rules:**\n\n- We may not respond to your issue or PR.\n- We may close an issue or PR without much feedback.\n- We may lock discussions or contributions if our attention is getting DDOSed.\n- We do not provide support for build issues.\n\n**Guidelines:**\n\n- Check for existing issues before filing a new one, please.\n- Open an issue and give some time for discussion before submitting a PR.\n- If submitting a PR that includes a lexicon change, please get sign off on the lexicon change _before_ doing the implementation.\n- Issues are for bugs & feature requests related to the TypeScript implementation of atproto and related services.\n  - For high-level discussions, please use the [Discussion Forum](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/discussions).\n  - For client issues, please use the relevant [social-app](https://github.com/bluesky-social/social-app) repo.\n- Stay away from PRs that:\n  - Refactor large parts of the codebase\n  - Add entirely new features without prior discussion\n  - Change the tooling or frameworks used without prior discussion\n  - Introduce new unnecessary dependencies\n\nRemember, we serve a wide community of users. Our day-to-day involves us constantly asking \"which top priority is our top priority.\" If you submit well-written PRs that solve problems concisely, that's an awesome contribution. Otherwise, as much as we'd love to accept your ideas and contributions, we really don't have the bandwidth.\n\n## Are you a developer interested in building on atproto?\n\nBluesky is an open social network built on the AT Protocol, a flexible technology that will never lock developers out of the ecosystems that they help build. With atproto, third-party can be as seamless as first-party through custom feeds, federated services, clients, and more.\n\n## Security disclosures\n\nIf you discover any security issues, please send an email to security@bsky.app. The email is automatically CCed to the entire team, and we'll respond promptly.
