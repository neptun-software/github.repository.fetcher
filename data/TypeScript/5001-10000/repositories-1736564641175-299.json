Your insights could help others make better use of Repomix.\n\n### Output File Format\n\nRepomix generates a single file with clear separators between different parts of your codebase.  \nTo enhance AI comprehension, the output file begins with an AI-oriented explanation, making it easier for AI models to understand the context and structure of the packed repository.\n\n#### Plain Text Format (default)\n\n```text\nThis file is a merged representation of the entire codebase, combining all repository files into a single document.\n\n================================================================\nFile Summary\n================================================================\n(Metadata and usage AI instructions)\n\n================================================================\nDirectory Structure\n================================================================\nsrc/\n  cli/\n    cliOutput.ts\n    index.ts\n  config/\n    configLoader.ts\n\n(...remaining directories)\n\n================================================================\nFiles\n================================================================\n\n================\nFile: src/index.js\n================\n// File contents here\n\n================\nFile: src/utils.js\n================\n// File contents here\n\n(...remaining files)\n\n================================================================\nInstruction\n================================================================\n(Custom instructions from `output.instructionFilePath`)\n```\n\n#### XML Format\n\nTo generate output in XML format, use the `--style xml` option:\n```bash\nrepomix --style xml\n```\n\nThe XML format structures the content in a hierarchical manner:\n\n```xml\nThis file is a merged representation of the entire codebase, combining all repository files into a single document.\n\n<file_summary>\n(Metadata and usage AI instructions)\n</file_summary>\n\n<directory_structure>\nsrc/\n  cli/\n    cliOutput.ts\n    index.ts\n\n(...remaining directories)\n</directory_structure>\n\n<files>\n<file path=\"src/index.js\">\n// File contents here\n</file>\n\n(...remaining files)\n</files>\n\n<instruction>\n(Custom instructions from `output.instructionFilePath`)\n</instruction>\n```\n\nFor those interested in the potential of XML tags in AI contexts:  \nhttps://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/use-xml-tags\n\n> When your prompts involve multiple components like context, instructions, and examples, XML tags can be a game-changer. They help Claude parse your prompts more accurately, leading to higher-quality outputs.\n\nThis means that the XML output from Repomix is not just a different format, but potentially a more effective way to feed your codebase into AI systems for analysis, code review, or other tasks.\n\n#### Markdown Format\n\nTo generate output in Markdown format, use the `--style markdown` option:\n```bash\nrepomix --style markdown\n```\n\nThe Markdown format structures the content in a hierarchical manner:\n\n````markdown\nThis file is a merged representation of the entire codebase, combining all repository files into a single document.\n\n# File Summary\n(Metadata and usage AI instructions)\n\n# Repository Structure\n```\nsrc/\n  cli/\n    cliOutput.ts\n    index.ts\n```\n(...remaining directories)\n\n# Repository Files\n\n## File: src/index.js\n```\n// File contents here\n```\n\n(...remaining files)\n\n# Instruction\n(Custom instructions from `output.instructionFilePath`)\n````\n\nThis format provides a clean, readable structure that is both human-friendly and easily parseable by AI systems.\n\n### Command Line Options\n\n- `-v, --version`: Show tool version\n- `-o, --output <file>`: Specify the output file name\n- `--include <patterns>`: List of include patterns (comma-separated)\n- `-i, --ignore <patterns>`: Additional ignore patterns (comma-separated)\n- `-c, --config <path>`: Path to a custom config file\n- `--style <style>`: Specify the output style (`plain`, `xml`, `markdown`)\n- `--no-file-summary`: Disable file summary section output\n- `--no-directory-structure`: Disable directory structure section output\n- `--remove-comments`: Remove comments from supported file types\n- `--remove-empty-lines`: Remove empty lines from the output\n- `--top-files-len <number>`: Number of top files to display in the summary\n- `--output-show-line-numbers`: Show line numbers in the output\n- `--copy`: Additionally copy generated output to system clipboard\n- `--remote <url>`: Process a remote Git repository\n- `--remote-branch <name>`: Specify the remote branch name, tag, or commit hash (defaults to repository default branch)\n- `--no-security-check`: Disable security check\n- `--token-count-encoding <encoding>`: Specify token count encoding (e.g., `o200k_base`, `cl100k_base`)\n- `--verbose`: Enable verbose logging\n\nExamples:\n```bash\nrepomix -o custom-output.txt\nrepomix -i \"*.log,tmp\" -v\nrepomix -c ./custom-config.json\nrepomix --style xml\nrepomix --remote https://github.com/user/repo\nnpx repomix src\n```\n\n### Updating Repomix\n\nTo update a globally installed Repomix:\n\n```bash\n# Using npm\nnpm update -g repomix\n\n# Using yarn\nyarn global upgrade repomix\n```\n\nUsing `npx repomix` is generally more convenient as it always uses the latest version.\n\n\n### Remote Repository Processing\n\nRepomix supports processing remote Git repositories without the need for manual cloning. This feature allows you to quickly analyze any public Git repository with a single command.\n\nTo process a remote repository, use the `--remote` option followed by the repository URL:\n\n```bash\nrepomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix\n```\n\nYou can also use GitHub's shorthand format:\n\n```bash\nrepomix --remote yamadashy/repomix\n```\n\nYou can specify the branch name, tag, or commit hash:\n\n```bash\nrepomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix --remote-branch main\n```\n\nOr use a specific commit hash:\n```bash\nrepomix --remote https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix --remote-branch 935b695\n```\n\n## ⚙️ Configuration\n\nCreate a `repomix.config.json` file in your project root for custom configurations.\n```bash\nrepomix --init\n```\n\nHere's an explanation of the configuration options:\n\n| Option | Description | Default |\n|--------|-------------|---------|\n|`output.filePath`| The name of the output file | `\"repomix-output.txt\"` |\n|`output.style`| The style of the output (`plain`, `xml`, `markdown`) |`\"plain\"`|\n|`output.headerText`| Custom text to include in the file header |`null`|\n|`output.instructionFilePath`| Path to a file containing detailed custom instructions |`null`|\n|`output.fileSummary`| Whether to include a summary section at the beginning of the output |`true`|\n|`output.directoryStructure`| Whether to include the directory structure in the output |`true`|\n|`output.removeComments`| Whether to remove comments from supported file types | `false` |\n|`output.removeEmptyLines`| Whether to remove empty lines from the output | `false` |\n|`output.showLineNumbers`| Whether to add line numbers to each line in the output |`false`|\n|`output.copyToClipboard`| Whether to copy the output to system clipboard in addition to saving the file |`false`|\n|`output.topFilesLength`| Number of top files to display in the summary. If set to 0, no summary will be displayed |`5`|\n|`output.includeEmptyDirectories`| Whether to include empty directories in the repository structure |`false`|\n|`include`| Patterns of files to include (using [glob patterns](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob?tab=readme-ov-file#pattern-syntax)) |`[]`|\n|`ignore.useGitignore`| Whether to use patterns from the project's `.gitignore` file |`true`|\n|`ignore.useDefaultPatterns`| Whether to use default ignore patterns |`true`|\n|`ignore.customPatterns`| Additional patterns to ignore (using [glob patterns](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob?tab=readme-ov-file#pattern-syntax)) |`[]`|\n|`security.enableSecurityCheck`| Whether to perform security checks on files |`true`|\n|`tokenCount.encoding`| Token count encoding for AI model context limits (e.g., `o200k_base`, `cl100k_base`) |`\"o200k_base\"`|\n\nExample configuration:\n\n```json5\n{\n  \"output\": {\n    \"filePath\": \"repomix-output.xml\",\n    \"style\": \"xml\",\n    \"headerText\": \"Custom header information for the packed file.\",\n    \"fileSummary\": true,\n    \"directoryStructure\": true,\n    \"removeComments\": false,\n    \"removeEmptyLines\": false,\n    \"showLineNumbers\": false,\n    \"copyToClipboard\": true,\n    \"topFilesLength\": 5,\n    \"includeEmptyDirectories\": false\n  },\n  \"include\": [\"**/*\"],\n  \"ignore\": {\n    \"useGitignore\": true,\n    \"useDefaultPatterns\": true,\n    // Patterns can also be specified in .repomixignore\n    \"customPatterns\": [\"additional-folder\", \"**/*.log\"]\n  },\n  \"security\": {\n    \"enableSecurityCheck\": true\n  },\n  \"tokenCount\": {\n    \"encoding\": \"o200k_base\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Global Configuration\nTo create a global configuration file:\n\n```bash\nrepomix --init --global\n```\n\nThe global configuration file will be created in:\n- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Repomix\\repomix.config.json`\n- macOS/Linux: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/repomix/repomix.config.json` or `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.json`\n\nNote: Local configuration (if present) takes precedence over global configuration.\n\n### Include and Ignore\n#### Include Patterns\nRepomix now supports specifying files to include using [glob patterns](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob?tab=readme-ov-file#pattern-syntax). This allows for more flexible and powerful file selection:\n\n- Use `**/*.js` to include all JavaScript files in any directory\n- Use `src/**/*` to include all files within the `src` directory and its subdirectories\n- Combine multiple patterns like `[\"src/**/*.js\", \"**/*.md\"]` to include JavaScript files in `src` and all Markdown files\n\n#### Ignore Patterns\nRepomix offers multiple methods to set ignore patterns for excluding specific files or directories during the packing process:\n\n- **.gitignore**: By default, patterns listed in your project's `.gitignore` file are used. This behavior can be controlled with the `ignore.useGitignore` setting.\n- **Default patterns**: Repomix includes a default list of commonly excluded files and directories (e.g., node_modules, .git, binary files). This feature can be controlled with the `ignore.useDefaultPatterns` setting. Please see [defaultIgnore.ts](src/config/defaultIgnore.ts) for more details.\n- **.repomixignore**: You can create a `.repomixignore` file in your project root to define Repomix-specific ignore patterns. This file follows the same format as `.gitignore`.\n- **Custom patterns**: Additional ignore patterns can be specified using the `ignore.customPatterns` option in the configuration file. You can overwrite this setting with the `-i, --ignore` command line option.\n\nPriority Order (from highest to lowest):\n1. Custom patterns `ignore.customPatterns`\n2. `.repomixignore`\n3. `.gitignore` (if `ignore.useGitignore` is true)\n4. Default patterns (if `ignore.useDefaultPatterns` is true)\n\nThis approach allows for flexible file exclusion configuration based on your project's needs. It helps optimize the size of the generated pack file by ensuring the exclusion of security-sensitive files and large binary files, while preventing the leakage of confidential information.\n\nNote: Binary files are not included in the packed output by default, but their paths are listed in the \"Repository Structure\" section of the output file. This provides a complete overview of the repository structure while keeping the packed file efficient and text-based.\n\n### Custom Instruction\n\nThe `output.instructionFilePath` option allows you to specify a separate file containing detailed instructions or context about your project. This allows AI systems to understand the specific context and requirements of your project, potentially leading to more relevant and tailored analysis or suggestions.\n\nHere's an example of how you might use this feature:\n\n1. Create a file named `repomix-instruction.md` in your project root:\n\n```markdown\n# Coding Guidelines\n- Follow the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide\n- Suggest splitting files into smaller, focused units when appropriate\n- Add comments for non-obvious logic. Keep all text in English\n- All new features should have corresponding unit tests\n\n# Generate Comprehensive Output\n- Include all content without abbreviation, unless specified otherwise\n- Optimize for handling large codebases while maintaining output quality\n```\n\n2. In your `repomix.config.json`, add the `instructionFilePath` option:\n\n```json5\n{\n  \"output\": {\n    \"instructionFilePath\": \"repomix-instruction.md\",\n    // other options...\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhen Repomix generates the output, it will include the contents of `repomix-instruction.md` in a dedicated section.\n\nNote: The instruction content is appended at the end of the output file. This placement can be particularly effective for AI systems. For those interested in understanding why this might be beneficial, Anthropic provides some insights in their documentation:  \nhttps://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/long-context-tips\n\n> Put long-form data at the top: Place your long documents and inputs (~20K+ tokens) near the top of your prompt, above your query, instructions, and examples. This can significantly improve Claude's performance across all models.\n> Queries at the end can improve response quality by up to 30% in tests, especially with complex, multi-document inputs.\n\n### Comment Removal\n\nWhen `output.removeComments` is set to `true`, Repomix will attempt to remove comments from supported file types. This feature can help reduce the size of the output file and focus on the essential code content.\n\nSupported languages include:  \nHTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Vue, Svelte, Python, PHP, Ruby, C, C#, Java, Go, Rust, Swift, Kotlin, Dart, Shell, and YAML.\n\nNote: The comment removal process is conservative to avoid accidentally removing code. In complex cases, some comments might be retained.\n\n\n\n## 🔍 Security Check\n\nRepomix includes a security check feature that uses [Secretlint](https://github.com/secretlint/secretlint) to detect potentially sensitive information in your files. This feature helps you identify possible security risks before sharing your packed repository.\n\nThe security check results will be displayed in the CLI output after the packing process is complete. If any suspicious files are detected, you'll see a list of these files along with a warning message.\n\nExample output:\n\n```\n🔍 Security Check:\n──────────────────\n2 suspicious file(s) detected:\n1. src/utils/test.txt\n2. tests/utils/secretLintUtils.test.ts\n\nPlease review these files for potentially sensitive information.\n```\n\nBy default, Repomix's security check feature is enabled. You can disable it by setting `security.enableSecurityCheck` to `false` in your configuration file:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"security\": {\n    \"enableSecurityCheck\": false\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOr using the `--no-security-check` command line option:\n\n```bash\nrepomix --no-security-check\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Disabling security checks may expose sensitive information. Use this option with caution and only when necessary, such as when working with test files or documentation that contains example credentials.\n\n\n\n## 🤝 Contribution\n\nWe welcome contributions from the community!

          "content": "# Coding Guidelines\n- Follow the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide\n- Suggest splitting files into smaller, focused units when appropriate\n  - Keep code files under 250 lines, if the file is over 250 lines, split it into multiple files based on the functionality.\n- Add comments for non-obvious logic. Keep all text in English\n- All new features should have corresponding unit tests\n\n## Dependencies and Testing\n- Inject dependencies through a deps object parameter for testability\n- Example:\n  ```typescript\n  export const functionName = async (\n    param1: Type1,\n    param2: Type2,\n    deps = {\n      defaultFunction1,\n      defaultFunction2,\n    }\n  ) => {\n    // Use deps.defaultFunction1() instead of direct call\n  };\n  ```\n- Mock dependencies by passing test doubles through deps object\n- Use vi.mock() only when dependency injection is not feasible\n\n# Generate Comprehensive Output\n- Include all content without abbreviation, unless specified otherwise\n- Optimize for handling large codebases while maintaining output quality\n\n# GitHub Release Note Guidelines\nHere are some examples of release notes that follow the guidelines:\n\nv0.1.40\n````md\nThis release introduces improvements to file handling and output formatting, enhancing Repomix's functionality and user experience.\n\n## Improvements\n\n### Enhanced Markdown Support (#86, #95)\n\n- Improved code block formatting in Markdown output:\n  - Added language identifiers to code blocks for better syntax highlighting\n  - Extended support for various file extensions to improve language detection\n- Dynamic output file extension:\n  - The extension of the output file now changes based on the selected style (e.g., `.md` for Markdown, `.xml` for XML)\n  - This behavior only applies when no specific output file path is provided by the user\n\n### Enhanced Exclusion of Package Manager Lock Files (#90, #94)\n\n- Improved exclusion of common package manager lock files:\n  - npm: `package-lock.json`\n  - Yarn: `yarn.lock`\n  - pnpm: `pnpm-lock.yaml`\n  - These files are now automatically excluded from the packed output, including those in subdirectories\n\n## How to Update\n\nTo update to the latest version, run:\n\n```bash\nnpm update -g repomix\n```\n\n---\n\nWe value your feedback and contributions in making Repomix better! If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, please share them through our GitHub issues.\n````\n\nv0.1.38\n````md\nThis release introduces a new Markdown output style, providing users with an additional option for formatting their repository content.\n\n## What's New\n\n### Markdown Output Style (#86, #87)\n\n- Added new 'markdown' output style option\n  - Users can now generate output in Markdown format, alongside existing plain text and XML options\n\n## How to Use\n\nTo use the new Markdown output style, use the `--style markdown` option:\n\n```bash\nrepomix --style markdown\n```\n\nOr update your `repomix.config.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"output\": {\n    \"style\": \"markdown\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\nTo update, simply run:\n```bash\nnpm update -g repomix\n```\n\nAs always, we appreciate your feedback and contributions to make Repomix even better! If you encounter any issues or have suggestions regarding this new feature, please let us know through our GitHub issues.\n````\n\nv0.1.36\n````md\nThis release introduces a new configuration option that allows users to control the security check feature, providing more flexibility in how Repomix handles sensitive information detection.\n\n## What's New\n\n### Configurable Security Check (#74, #75)\n\n- Added new configuration option `security.enableSecurityCheck` (default: `true`)\n  - Users can now disable the security check when needed, such as when working with cryptographic libraries or known false positives\n\n## How to Use\n\nTo **disable** the security check, add the following to your `repomix.config.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"security\": {\n    \"enableSecurityCheck\": false\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** Disabling the security check may expose sensitive information. Use this option with caution and only when necessary.\n\n---\n\nTo update, simply run:\n```bash\nnpm update -g repomix\n```\n\nAs always, we appreciate your feedback and contributions to make Repomix even better! If you encounter any issues or have suggestions regarding this new feature, please let us know through our GitHub issues.\n````\n\nv0.1.32\n````md\nThis release focuses on improving performance and user experience, particularly when processing large repositories.\n\n## Bug Fixes\n###  Fixed an issue where the application appeared to hang (#63, #65)\n\n- Fixed an issue where the application appeared to hang during the security check process on large repositories.\n- Reduced the impact on the event loop to prevent hanging when processing a large number of files.\n- Implemented more frequent console updates during file processing and security checks.\n\n---\nTo update, simply run:\n```\nnpm update -g repomix\n```\n\nAs always, we appreciate your feedback and contributions to make Repomix even better!\n````\n"
