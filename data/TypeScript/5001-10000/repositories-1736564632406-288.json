          "content": "Oh, hello there! You're probably reading this because you are interested in\ncontributing to nteract. That's great to hear! This document will help you\nthrough your journey of open source. Love it, cherish it, take it out to\ndinner, but most importantly: read it thoroughly!\n\n## What do I need to know to help?\n\n### The JavaScript/TypeScript\n\nYou'll need knowledge of JavaScript (ES6), React, RxJS, Redux, and TypeScript to\nhelp out with this project. That's a whole lot of cool stuff! But don't worry,\nwe've got some resources to help you out.\n\n- [Building a voting app with Redux and React](http://teropa.info/blog/2015/09/10/full-stack-redux-tutorial.html)\n- [Introduction to Reactive Programming](https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754)\n- [Examples, Explanations, and Resources for RxJS 5](https://github.com/btroncone/learn-rxjs)\n- [TypeScript in 5 Minutes](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html)\n\n### Jupyter and ZeroMQ (Optional)\n\nWhile not a strict pre-requisite, familiarity with the protocol that Jupyter\nprovides for creating rich notebooks like nteract (and other consoles/REPLs) is\nadvised to understand the overall system.\n\n- [Jupyter Messaging](http://jupyter-client.readthedocs.org/en/latest/messaging.html)\n- [ZeroMQ](http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all)\n\nIf you want a gentle guide to Rx + Jupyter messaging at the same time, we have\na [build your own REPL with enchannel](https://github.com/nteract/docs-old/blob/master/enchannel/build-your-own-repl.md)\ntutorial. This allows you to work without React while learning concepts,\nleading to implementing a light version of [ick](https://github.com/nteract/ick),\nan interactive console.\n\n## What NodeJS version do I need?\n\nIt's best to use the latest LTS version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) (currently: ![unknown to this\nuser agent. Please check the NodeJS website linked previously](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/node/lts.svg?label=)).\nSome dependencies can break when using newer releases.\n\nTo manage multiple versions of NodeJS, take a look at the [n Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n). You\ncan switch to the latest LTS version using:\n\n```\n$ n lts\n```\n\n## How do I make a contribution?\n\nNever made an open source contribution before? Wondering how contributions work\nin the nteract world? Here's a quick rundown!\n\n1.  Find an issue that you are interested in addressing or a feature that you would like to address.\n2.  Fork the repository associated with the issue to your local GitHub organization.\n3.  Install the `ipykernel` on your machine using the instructions outlined [on the kernels guide](https://nteract.io/kernels).\n4.  Clone the repository to your local machine using:\n\n```\n$ git clone https://github.com/github-username/repository-name.git\n```\n\n5.  `cd` into your new clone and run the following scripts:\n\n- `yarn install` or just `yarn` to install dependencies\n- `yarn build:all` to compile typescript\n\n6.  Create a new branch for your fix using:\n\n```\n$ git checkout -b branch-name-here\n```\n\n7.  Make the appropriate changes for the issue you are trying to address or the feature that you want to add. Validate your changes by following the steps in the \"How do I validate my changes\" segment below.\n8.  Confirm that unit tests still pass successfully with:\n\n```\n$ yarn test\n```\n\nIf tests fail, don't hesitate to ask for help.\n\n9.  Add and commit the changed files using `git add` and `git commit`.\n10. Push the changes to the remote repository using:\n\n```\n$ git push origin branch-name-here\n```\n\n11. Submit a pull request to the upstream repository.\n12. Title the pull request per the requirements outlined in the section below.\n13. Set the description of the pull request with a brief description of what you did and any questions you might have about what you did.\n14. Wait for the pull request to be reviewed by a maintainer.\n15. Make changes to the pull request if the reviewing maintainer recommends them.\n16. Celebrate your success after your pull request is merged! :tada:\n\n## How do I validate my changes to nteract?\n\n### Validating in the nteract desktop app\n\nIn addition to writing tests, you will want to validate your changes by testing them in the nteract desktop and web applications. These applications are a great test harness for manual tests and QA. To set up the nteract desktop application for development, follow the steps below.\n\n1. Ensure that you have installed the monorepo dependencies by running `yarn` in the root directory.\n2. Open a terminal window and run the following command. This will start a progressive build of the nteract desktop app. Whenever you make a code change, the build will automagically update.\n\n```\n$ yarn build:desktop:watch\n```\n\n3. In a separate window, run the following command. This will spawn the Electron app running the desktop app.\n\n```\n$ yarn spawn\n```\n\nYou will need to reload the nteract page to fetch the latest changes from the build. You can do so by clicking `View > Reload` in the menu. (Note: reload is currently broken, [Issue #5168](https://github.com/nteract/nteract/issues/5168), so it's necessary to run `yarn spawn` to load the page again)\n\n**Helpful Tip:** You can enter the debugger in the Electron app by placing a `debugger;` statement in the desired location in your source code.\n\n### Validating in the nteract web app\n\nThe nteract web app is a great place to validate changes made to the nteract source that affect interactions with a Jupyter server. To setup the nteract web app for development, please follow the instructions in [its README](./applications/jupyter-extension).\n\n## How should I write my commit messages and PR titles?\n\nGood commit messages serve at least three important purposes:\n\n- To speed up the reviewing process.\n\n- To help us write a good release note.\n\n- To help the future maintainers of nteract/nteract (it could be you!), say\n  five years into the future, to find out why a particular change was made to\n  the code or why a specific feature was added.\n\nStructure your commit message like this:\n\n```\n> Short (50 chars or less) summary of changes\n>\n> More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72\n> characters or so.  In some contexts, the first line is treated as the\n> subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.  The blank\n> line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit\n> the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the\n> two together.\n>\n> Further paragraphs come after blank lines.\n>\n>   - Bullet points are okay, too\n>\n>   - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded by a\n>     single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here\n>\n```\n\n_Source: http://git-scm.com/book/ch5-2.html_\n\n### DO\n\n- Adhere to conventional commit guidelines when publishing commits.\n\n### DON'T\n\n- Don't end the summary line with a period.\n\n### Tips\n\n- If it seems difficult to summarize what your commit does, it may be because it\n  includes several logical changes or bug fixes, and are better split up into\n  several commits using `git add -p`.\n\n### References\n\nThe following blog post has a nice discussion of commit messages:\n\n- \"On commit messages\" http://who-t.blogspot.com/2009/12/on-commit-messages.html\n\n## How fast will my PR be merged?\n\nYour pull request will be merged as soon as there are maintainers to review it\nand after tests have passed. You might have to make some changes before your\nPR is merged but as long as you adhere to the steps above and try your best,\nyou should have no problem getting your PR merged.\n\nThat's it! You're good to go!\n"

          "content": "## The nteract Release Process\n\nThis document outlines logistics around how releases are handled in the nteract project, specifically the applications and npm packages within this repository.\n\n## Release Process for Packages\n\nReleases for JavaScript packages in the monorepo happen automatically whenever a pull request is merged into the `main` branch of the repo. These automated releases are faciliated by the [semantic-release tool](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) release that is configured on the repo. In order to support automated releases, commits on this repo **MUST** follow the [conventional commit guidelines](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). This convention is enforced by a linter that runs on each invocation of `git commit`.\n\n## Release Process for Desktop App\n\nThe nteract desktop app is shipped on a monthly cadence. You can ship nteract desktop releases from any operating system, with one notable exception. Due to technical limitations, macOS releases can only be shipped on macOS. On the topic of macOS...\n\n### A special note for macOS\n\nIn order to build a signed copy with working auto-update, you will need to join the Apple developer program and get a certificate. The [Electron docs have a document on submitting your app to the app store](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/tutorial/mac-app-store-submission-guide.md), you only have to get through to the certificate step. Note, that the certificate that you will need to download from the Apple Developer Program portal is called the \"3rd Party Mac Developer Application\" certificate.\n\n### All platform precursor\n\nTo be able to publish a release you'll need to generate a GitHub access token by going to <https://github.com/settings/tokens/new>. The access token should have the `repo` scope/permission. Once you have the token, assign it to an environment variable (on macOS/linux):\n\n```bash\nexport GH_TOKEN=\"<YOUR_TOKEN_HERE>\"\n```\n\nIf you are on Windows, you can assign it as an environment using the following command in Command Prompt.\n\n```\n> setx GH_TOKEN \"<YOUR_TOKEN_HERE>\"\n```\n\nNote that `setx` will apply the environment variable in subsequence Command Prompt sessions.\n\n**Note: Make sure that your remote origin is set as `git@github.com:nteract/nteract.git`.**\n\n1.  Make sure the release is working by running `yarn dist` and testing the built app inside the `./applications/desktop/dist/` folder. You can build for all platforms using `yarn dist:all`.\n\n2.  Double check that publish will really work by running `yarn verifyBeforePublish` first\n\n3.  Run `npx lerna publish` to publish everything, which also runs the verification steps. You will have to pick versions for everything.\n\n4.  Run the following to ship the built desktop app. This will generate the platform-specific assets and create a draft release on GitHub with the assets.\n\n```\nyarn ship:desktop\n```\n\n5.  From GitHub go to [nteract's releases](https://github.com/nteract/nteract/releases), verify everything works and edit the release notes. The name should follow our [naming guidelines](https://github.com/nteract/naming), namely that we use the last name of the next scientist in the list with an adjective in front.\n    Example:\n\n```bash\nLast release: Avowed Avogadro\nNext Scientist: Babbage\nNext release: Babbling Babbage\n```\n\nYou can pick alliterative adjectives by using the local dictionary and our friend `grep`:\n\n```bash\n$ cat /usr/share/dict/words | grep \"^babb\"\nbabbitt\nbabbitter\nbabblative\nbabble\nbabblement\nbabbler\nbabblesome\nbabbling\nbabblingly\nbabblish\nbabblishly\nbabbly\nbabby\n```\n\n6.  Once you're ready click \"Publish release\". On macOS and Windows, the update will be automatically downloaded and installed on user's machines.\n"

          "content": "When releasing the nteract desktop app, run through the following test plan to ensure that everything is A-OK before releasing.\n\nBefore starting the test plan, build the distributed nteract assets using the command below. This command will generate a set of binaries that will be stored in the `applications/desktop/dist` directory.\n\n```\n$ yarn dist:all\n```\n\n> ℹ Note:\n> \n> It's not possible to build the Mac version of nteract from a Windows, so using `yarn dist:all` won't work. To test only on Windows, run `yarn dist` instead.\n\n> ℹ Note:\n> \n> If you run into a JavaScript heap out of memory error, you might need to temporarily increase the heap size by within the NODE_OPTIONS variable. For example, on Windows this can be achieved by running `set NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=8172` in Command Prompt before running the yarn command.\n\nIf possible, run through this test plan on the different supported operating systems: Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n\n## Scenario 1: Opening and editing an existing notebook\n\n1. Open an existing notebook using the File > Open window.\n2. Run the first cell in the notebook.\n3. Ensure that the kernel launches and the cell executes.\n4. Modify the notebook by adding a new cell and running it.\n5. Save the notebook.\n6. Close the notebook and open it again. Confirm that your changes have been saved.\n\n## Scenario 2: Modifying the notebook UI\n\n1. Toggle the output and input visibility of a notebook and verify that it works.\n2. Toggle whether or not an output is expanded and verify that it works.\n    - Here's an example of a cell to use to try this: `print('a\\n'*1000)`\n3. Toggle the theme of the notebook and verify that it is changed.\n4. Toggle the Editor Type between CodeMirror and Monaco and verify that it changes.\n5. Close the nteract desktop app.\n6. Open the nteract desktop app and confirm that saved configurations are reloaded.\n\n## Scenario 3: Testing notebook features\n1. Open a notebook with ipywidgets (such as [this one](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets/blob/master/docs/source/examples/Widget%20List.ipynb)) and confirm that they work.\n    - Note: Requires the [ipywidgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_install.html) package.\n2. Open a notebook with a data explorer visualization and confirm that it works.\n    - You can use an example notebook (File -> Open Example Notebook -> python -> \"Try the Data Explorer\") or one of your own.\n    - Note: Requires the `pandas` and `vdom` packages\n3. Open a notebook with a GeoJSON map and confirm that it works.\n    - You can use an example notebook (File -> Open Example Notebook -> python -> \"Explore Your World with GeoJSON\", or \"Go from Pandas to GeoJSON\") or one of your own.\n"
