By doing this you are helping people get up and running with GitHub Actions and that's cool ðŸ˜Ž.\n\nContributions to this project are [released](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/#6-contributions-under-repository-license) to the public under the [project's open source license](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/blob/main/LICENSE).\n\nPlease note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](\nhttps://github.com/actions/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.\n\n**At this time we are only accepting new starter workflows for Code Scanning**\n\n### Previous guidelines for new starter workflows.\n\nBefore merging a new workflow, the following requirements need to be met:\n\n- Should be as simple as is needed for the service.\n- There are many programming languages and tools out there. Right now we don't have a page that allows for a really large number of workflows, so we do have to be a little choosy about what we accept. Less popular tools or languages might not be accepted.\n- Automation and CI workflows should not send data to any 3rd party service except for the purposes of installing dependencies.\n- Automation and CI workflows cannot be dependent on a paid service or product.\n- We require that Actions outside of the `actions` organization be pinned to a specific SHA.\n\nThank you\n"

They're presented whenever you start to create a new GitHub Actions workflow.\n\n**If you want to get started with GitHub Actions, you can use these starter workflows by clicking the \"Actions\" tab in the repository where you want to create a workflow.**\n\n<img src=\"https://d3vv6lp55qjaqc.cloudfront.net/items/353A3p3Y2x3c2t2N0c01/Image%202019-08-27%20at%203.25.07%20PM.png\" max-width=\"75%\"/>\n\n### Directory structure\n\n* [ci](ci): solutions for Continuous Integration workflows\n* [deployments](deployments): solutions for Deployment workflows\n* [automation](automation): solutions for automating workflows\n* [code-scanning](code-scanning): solutions for [Code Scanning](https://github.com/features/security)\n* [pages](pages): solutions for Pages workflows\n* [icons](icons): svg icons for the relevant template\n\nEach workflow must be written in YAML and have a `.yml` extension. They also need a corresponding `.properties.json` file that contains extra metadata about the workflow (this is displayed in the GitHub.com UI).\n\nFor example: `ci/django.yml` and `ci/properties/django.properties.json`.\n\n### Valid properties\n\n* `name`: the name shown in onboarding. This property is unique within the repository.\n* `description`: the description shown in onboarding\n* `iconName`: the icon name in the relevant folder, for example, `django` should have an icon `icons/django.svg`. Only SVG is supported at this time. Another option is to use [octicon](https://primer.style/octicons/). The format to use an octicon is `octicon <<icon name>>`. Example: `octicon person`\n* `creator`: creator of the template shown in onboarding. All the workflow templates from an author will have the same `creator` field.\n* `categories`: the categories that it will be shown under. Choose at least one category from the list [here](#categories). Further, choose the categories from the list of languages available [here](https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/master/lib/linguist/languages.yml) and the list of tech stacks available [here](https://github.com/github-starter-workflows/repo-analysis-partner/blob/main/tech_stacks.yml). When a user views the available templates, those templates that match the language and tech stacks will feature more prominently.\n\n### Categories\n* continuous-integration\n* deployment\n* testing\n* code-quality\n* code-review\n* dependency-management\n* monitoring\n* Automation\n* utilities\n* Pages\n* Hugo\n\n### Variables\nThese variables can be placed in the starter workflow and will be substituted as detailed below:\n\n* `$default-branch`: will substitute the branch from the repository, for example `main` and `master`\n* `$protected-branches`: will substitute any protected branches from the repository\n* `$cron-daily`: will substitute a valid but random time within the day\n\n## How to test templates before publishing\n\n### Disable template for public\nThe template author adds a `labels` array in the template's `properties.json` file with a label `preview`. This will hide the template from users, unless user uses query parameter `preview=true` in the URL.\nExample `properties.json` file:\n```json\n{\n    \"name\": \"Node.js\",\n    \"description\": \"Build and test a Node.js project with npm.\",\n    \"iconName\": \"nodejs\",\n    \"categories\": [\"Continuous integration\", \"JavaScript\", \"npm\", \"React\", \"Angular\", \"Vue\"],\n    \"labels\": [\"preview\"]\n}\n```\n\nFor viewing the templates with `preview` label, provide query parameter `preview=true` to the  `new workflow` page URL. Eg. `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo_name>/actions/new?preview=true`.\n\n### Enable template for public\nRemove the `labels` array from `properties.json` file to publish the template to public\n"
