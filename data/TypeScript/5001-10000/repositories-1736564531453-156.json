As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow:\n\n - [Code of Conduct](#coc)\n - [Question or Problem?](#question)\n - [Issues and Bugs](#issue)\n - [Feature Requests](#feature)\n - [Initial Setup](#setup)\n - [Submission Guidelines](#submit)\n   - [Submitting an Issue](#submit-issue)\n   - [Submitting a Pull Request](#submit-pr)\n      - [Before you submit](#submit-before)\n      - [How to submit](#submit-how)\n      - [Deploying docs](#submit-docs)\n - Appendix\n   - [Coding Rules][rules] (external link)\n   - [Commit Message Guidelines][commit] (external link)\n   - [Signing the CLA](#cla)\n\n## <a name=\"coc\"></a> Code of Conduct\n\nHelp us keep the Angular and Firebase communities open and inclusive. Please read and follow the Angular [Code of Conduct][coc].\n\n## <a name=\"question\"></a> Got a Question or Problem?\n\nIf you have questions about how to *use* AngularFire, please direct them to the [Angular Google Group][angular-group]\ndiscussion list or [StackOverflow][stackoverflow] (include the `firebase` and `angular` tags!). \nPlease note that the Angular team's capacity to answer usage questions is limited.\nMembers of the Firebase team can be reached on [Slack][slack] and via the [Firebase Google Group][firebase-group].\n\n## <a name=\"issue\"></a> Found an Issue?\n\nIf you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by\n[submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to our [GitHub Repository][github]. Even better, you can\n[submit a Pull Request](#submit-pr) with a fix.\n\n## <a name=\"feature\"></a> Want a Feature?\n\nYou can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to our [GitHub\nRepository][github]. If you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with\na proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.\nPlease consider what kind of change it is:\n\n* For a **Major Feature**, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be\ndiscussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work,\nand help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.\n* **Small Features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a Pull Request](#submit-pr).\n\n## <a name=\"setup\"></a> Initial Setup\n\n1) Create a fork of AngularFire (See [Forking a Project][github-fork])\n\n2) Clone your fork, CD into the directory, and install dependencies\n\n```shell\n$ git clone <your fork SSH/HTTPS from GitHub>\n$ cd angularfire\n$ npm i\n$ npm run build\n$ npm run test:all\n```\n\n3) Make your changes in a new git branch:\n\n```shell\ngit checkout -b my-fix-branch master\n```\n\n## <a name=\"submit\"></a> Submission Guidelines\n\n### <a name=\"submit-issue\"></a> Submitting an Issue\nHelp us to maximize the effort we can spend improving the product by not reporting duplicate issues.\nSearch the archives before you submit.\n\nProviding the following information will increase the chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:\n\n* **Overview of the Issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps\n* **Angular Version** - what version of Angular, Firebase, and AngularFire are you using?\n* **Motivation for or Use Case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you\n* **Browsers and Operating System** - is this a problem with all browsers?\n* **Reproduce the Error** - provide a live example (using StackBlitz (https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-fire-start))\n or a unambiguous set of steps\n* **Related Issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?\n* **Suggest a Fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be\n  causing the problem (line of code or commit)\n\nYou can file new issues by providing the above information [here](https://github.com/angular/angularfire2/issues/new).\n\n### <a name=\"submit-pr\"></a> Submitting a Pull Request (PR)\n\n#### <a name=\"submit-before\"></a> Before you submit:\n\n* Ensure proposed changes or problem have already been clearly defined and\n  discussed in the issue tracker. We don't want you to burn time on code\n  that isn't a good fit for the project.\n* Search [GitHub](https://github.com/angular/angularfire2/pulls) for an open or closed PR\n  that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.\n* Please sign our [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](#cla) before sending PRs.\n  We cannot accept code without this.\n* Review our [Coding Rules][rules] (external link)\n* Review our [Commit Message Guidelines][commit] (external link)  \n\n#### <a name=\"submit-how\"></a> How to submit:\n\n* Create your patch, **including appropriate test cases**.\n* Follow the [Angular Coding Rules][rules].\n* Run the full test suite (`yarn test`) and ensure that all tests pass.\n* Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows the\n  [Angular commit message conventions][commit]. Adherence to these conventions\n  is necessary because release notes are automatically generated from these messages.\n\n     ```shell\n     git commit -a\n     ```\n  Note: the optional commit `-a` command line option will automatically \"add\" and \"rm\" edited files.\n\n* Push your branch to GitHub:\n\n    ```shell\n    git push origin my-fix-branch\n    ```\n\n* In GitHub, send a pull request to `angular:master`.\n* If we suggest changes then:\n  * Make the required updates.\n  * Re-run the test suites to ensure tests are still passing.\n  * Rebase your branch and force push to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request):\n\n    ```shell\n    git rebase master -i\n    git push -f\n    ```\n\nThat's it! Thank you for your contribution!\n\n## <a name=\"cla\"></a> Signing the CLA\n\nPlease sign our Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before sending pull requests.

Check out our guide.](docs/version-7-upgrade.md)\n\n### Sample app\n\nThe [`sample`](sample) folder contains a kitchen sink application that demonstrates use of the \"modular\" API, in a zoneless server-rendered application, with all the bells and whistles.\n\n### Having troubles?\n\nGet help on our [Q&A board](https://github.com/angular/angularfire/discussions?discussions_q=category%3AQ%26A), the official [Firebase Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/firebase-talk), the [Firebase Community Slack](https://firebase.community/) (`#angularfire2`), the [Angular Community Discord](http://discord.gg/angular) (`#firebase`), [Gitter](https://gitter.im/angular/angularfire2), the [Firebase subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/firebase), or [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/angularfire2).\n\n> **NOTE:** While relatively stable, AngularFire is a [developer preview](https://angular.io/guide/releases#developer-preview) and is subject to change before general availability. Questions on the mailing list and issues filed here are answered on a <strong>best-effort basis</strong> by maintainers and other community members.
