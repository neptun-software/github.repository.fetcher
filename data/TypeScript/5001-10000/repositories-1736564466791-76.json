Optionally can only include the selected scenes for faster build previews in large projects.\n- Add events \"Load Projectile Into Slot\" and \"Launch Projectile In Slot\" to allow more advanced control over setup and launch of projectiles and changing the loaded projectiles at run time\n- Add ability to hover over tiles in debugger VRAM preview to see tile memory address information [@pau-tomas](https://github.com/pau-tomas)\n- Add animation states to generated `game_globals.h` allowing use from engine code [@Mico27](https://github.com/Mico27)\n- Add ability to change collision layer opacity in World view when collision tool is selected [@Q-Bert-Reynolds](https://github.com/Q-Bert-Reynolds)\n- Add ability for engine plugins to define new, per scene, collision tile types in `engine.json` file [@Q-Bert-Reynolds]\n- Add ability to show the raw collision tile values when editing collisions in world view\n- Add ability to ctrl/cmd + click frames in Sprite Editor to toggle multi select or shift + click to select range\n- Add right click context menu to frames in Sprite Editor allowing copy/paste/clone/delete to be performed on all selected frames\n- Add ability to search and add scripts by name when adding events instead of needing to add a \"Call Script\" event and selecting the script manually from the dropdown each time [@pau-tomas](https://github.com/pau-tomas)\n- Add ability to quickly create \"Comment\" events by typing the comment text in the Add Event search field and choosing \"Comment\" menu item [@pau-tomas](https://github.com/pau-tomas)\n- Add text code `!Wait` to allow pausing dialogue until an amount of time/frames has elapsed or a selected button has been pressed\n\n### Changed\n\n- Optimised performance of \"Show Connections\" calculations by moving most of the effort to a thottled Worker thread. This also improves script editing performance when Connections are visible.\n- \"Switch\" event updated to allow use of constant values for each branch condition\n- Optimised compilation of backgrounds by reusing tileset data where possible if common tilesets are used [@Mico27](https://github.com/Mico27)\n- Moved `.gbsres` files for assets to the same folder as the asset files. Allows asset plugins to include `.gbsres` e.g sprite asset pack plugins can include animations\n- Optimised script editor by throttling the processing that was occuring on every key press\n- Update to latest [GBVM](https://github.com/chrismaltby/gbvm)\n- Improved collision handling for ladders and one-way platforms in the Platformer scene type. Ladders now use the player's bottom edge for anchoring, and one-way platforms no longer snap the player to the platform when colliding from below [@Steinbeuge](https://github.com/Steinbeuge)\n- Ladder collision tile now only visible on Platform scenes by default, edit `engine.json` to add per scene collision tile types\n- New instances of prefabs use prefab's name by default\n- Update \"Wait\" event to support using variable values for wait time [@pau-tomas](https://github.com/pau-tomas))\n- Toggle multi selection of scenes action changed to ctrl/cmd + click to be more consistent with OS level defaults + new sprite editor frame selection\n- Updated Polish localisation. [@ReptiIe](https://github.com/ReptiIe)\n- Updated Japanese localisation. [@tomo666](https://github.com/tomo666)\n- Updated Spanish localisation. [@JimScope](https://github.com/JimScope)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fix issue where errors in watched files could cause application to crash\n- Fix issue where quickly clicking \"Create Project\" button during project creation could prevent new project from opening\n- Fix issue where CLI tool was ignoring project's debugger enabled setting causing debugger comments to always be included in generated gbvm code\n- Fix tileset preview in dropdowns for 16px tiles\n- Fix issue where instanced prefabs were showing incorrect icons in actor select inputs\n- Fix issue preventing engine plugins stored in subfolders from being included in project\n- Fix bottom margins when using GB Printer [@untoxa](https://github.com/untoxa)\n- Fix variable uses list which wasn't including variable \"0\"'s uses in text fields\n- Fix issue where \"Set Animation Frame\" event wouldn't allow frame values greater than 25\n- Fix issue causing \"Dialogue Multiple Choice\" event to cut off menu items early\n- Fix issue where changing the dimensions of a sprite png image could cause the sprite editor's tile palette to display incorrectly\n- Fix line numbers in code editor for GBVM scripts with more than 999 lines\n- Fix issue preventing projects being created with the name \"project\"\n- Fix issue preventing checkbox type working in engine fields [@pau-tomas](https://github.com/pau-tomas)\n- Fix UI palette text control code. Palette indices now go from 1 to 8, because zero byte is a string terminator [@untoxa](https://github.com/untoxa)\n- Fix issue where migrating old projects could cause gbvm symbols to become empty, preventing build from completing (opening a broken project will now automatically fix this issue)\n- Fix issue where sprites could end up with empty state id values\n- Fix issue where script labels could may not match script behaviour when referring to deleted actors (dropdown would say Self, label would say Player, game would use Self)\n\n## [4.1.3] - 2024-09-16\n\n### Changed\n\n- Updated Spanish localisation.

Up to 10 actors will be visible on screen at the same time.\n- Add ability to pin actors to screen to use as simple HUD elements\n- Add event to switch any actor's sprite sheet dynamically\n- Add event to toggle if an actor should animate while stationary\n- Add event to bounce player while in platform scenes\n- Add ability to create collisions tiles that only affect a single direction e.g. for platforms that you can jump through from below.\n- Add ability to mark tiles as Ladders (only affects Platform scenes)\n- Add choice of 8px or 16px brush sizes when drawing collisions or coloring background\n- Add ability to draw lines when drawing collisions or coloring background by holding shift and clicking\n- Image errors such as too many unique tiles, image too large etc. are now displayed underneath image dropdown in World editor\n- Cache compiled files as much as possible to reduce time required for repeated builds\n- Add projectile and attack events to add weapons to the player or actors\n- Add collision groups to actors/attacks/projectiles with collision scripts to run when an actor collides with a specific group (only player to actor and projectile/attack to actor supported, actor to actor collisions not supported)\n- Add ability to eject game engine, allowing per project overriding of any project source file\n- Migrated compiler to use [GBDK 2020](https://github.com/Zal0/gbdk-2020)\n- Copy/Paste also includes any referenced custom events allowing easier movement between projects\n- Commit hash included in About Window allowing easier identication of which version you are currently using [@pau-tomas](https://github.com/pau-tomas)\n- Improve text drawing animation and add ability to fast forward text boxes by holding a button [@RichardULZ](https://github.com/RichardULZ) / [@pau-tomas](https://github.com/pau-tomas)\n- Add ability to dynamically change text draw speed mid text field using commands \"!S0!\" for instant draw and \"!S5!\" for speed = 5 etc\n- Game engine completely rewritten to make less top down rpg genre specific\n- New engine performance optimisation [@RichardULZ](https://github.com/RichardULZ)\n- Merge events where the only difference was values being hard coded or coming from a variable like \"Move To\" and \"Move To Using Variables\" by adding button next to input that allows switching between variable, value or a new property type. Also allows mix of hard coded and variable values in single event. Feature known internally as union types\n- Custom events updated to support union types [@pau-tomas](https://github.com/pau-tomas)\n- Add additional Animation Speed option \"None\". Setting this will prevent actor from animating at all.

The old default is available in \"View/Show Connections/All\"\n- When not in color mode the Game World section will display images in the same palette as the emulator\n- Event \"Attach Script To Button\" now doesn't persist between scenes by default, old functionality is still available using a new \"persist\" checkbox but new events that depend on sprite memory layout may have issues when persist is enabled (Projectiles/Attack/Actor Set Sprite Sheet)\n- Top Down scenes now use the last pressed direction button for current movement direction improving controls when using a keyboard\n\n### Removed\n\n- Remove \"Double Speed Mode\" settings checkbox, when Color is enabled this is now enabled automatically\n- Remove actor \"Movement Type\" dropdown, replaced with \"On Update\" script. Existing actors set to Random Walk / Random Rotation will be migrated automatically\n\n## [1.2.1]\n\n### Added\n\n- Allow variables to be used in choice and menu events.
