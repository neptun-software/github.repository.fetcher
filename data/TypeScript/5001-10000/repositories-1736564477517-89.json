Besides, we provide cross-platform components, including [`react-icons`](./packages/react/README.md), [`vue-icons`](./packages/vue/README.md) and [`svg-icons`](./packages/vue/README.md).\nSo whether you are a designer or a developer, you can use them in your designs or your projects for free.\n\n\n<img src=\"https://sf1-dycdn-tos.pstatp.com/obj/eden-cn/lswwheh7nupwnuhog/icons/icon-dance.gif\"></img>\n\n### Packages\n#### Generate Cross-platform Components\n\nFind packages in `packages` folder. NPM packages make it painless to import icon components to your project.\n\n| Name | Github link | NPM link |\n| ------- | --- | --- |\n| React Icons | [React Component](./packages/react/README.md)  | [@icon-park/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@icon-park/react) |\n| Vue2 Icons | [Vue Component for old Vue2.0](./packages/vue/README.md) | [@icon-park/vue](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@icon-park/vue) |\n| Vue3 Icons | [Vue Component for Vue3.0](./packages/vue-next/README.md) | [@icon-park/vue-next](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@icon-park/vue-next) |\n| SVG Icons | [Pure SVG String](./packages/svg/README.md)| [@icon-park/svg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@icon-park/svg) |\n#### Multiple themes\n\nBasic coloring can be done by setting two attributes on the node: fill and stroke. Fill sets the color inside the object while stroke sets the color of the line drawn around the object. By changing this two attributes, you can transform a single SVG icon into different themes, including: `outline`, `filled`, `two-tone`, `multi-color`. Take the icon named `camera` for example:\n\nSource file: ![](https://sf1-dycdn-tos.pstatp.com/obj/eden-cn/lswwheh7nupwnuhog/icons/camera.svg)\n\nAfter Transforming:\n\n| React icons | Preview | Theme |\n| ---- | --- | --- |\n| ```<Camera theme=\"outline\" size=\"32\" fill=\"#000000\"/>``` | <img src=\"https://sf1-dycdn-tos.pstatp.com/obj/eden-cn/lswwheh7nupwnuhog/icons/camera_outline.png\" width=\"100\"></img> | Outline theme |\n| ```<Camera theme=\"filled\" size=\"32\" fill=\"#333\"/>``` | <img src=\"https://sf1-dycdn-tos.pstatp.com/obj/eden-cn/lswwheh7nupwnuhog/icons/camera_filled.png\" width=\"100\"></img> | Filled theme |\n| ```<Camera theme=\"two-tone\" size=\"32\" fill={['#333' ,'#2F88FF']}/>``` | <img src=\"https://sf1-dycdn-tos.pstatp.com/obj/eden-cn/lswwheh7nupwnuhog/icons/camera_two-tone.png\" width=\"100\"></img> | Two-tone theme |\n| ```<Camera theme=\"multi-color\" size=\"32\" fill={['#333' ,'#2F88FF' ,'#FFF' ,'#43CCF8']}/>``` | <img src=\"https://sf1-dycdn-tos.pstatp.com/obj/eden-cn/lswwheh7nupwnuhog/icons/camera_multi-color.png\" width=\"100\"></img> | Multi-color theme |\n\n#### Embed IconPark in your project \nIf you need to use additional information such as icon name, author, category, label and creation time, you can use the `icons.json` file located in the root directory of each NPM.\n\n### Website\n#### Customization\nHere is the website of [IconPark](http://iconpark.bytedance.com/official). Each icon is hand-coded within a 48x48 grid, using SVG stroke giving the maximum flexibility on styling. You can adjust the color, size, `stroke-width`, `stroke-linejoin`, `stroke-linecap` and other attributes to meet your needs.\n\n<img src=\"https://sf1-dycdn-tos.pstatp.com/obj/eden-cn/lswwheh7nupwnuhog/icons/screenshot.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of customization\"></img>\n\n\n#### Convenient Online Tools\n\n> You can use them in Figma, Sketch, Photoshop, PPT, etc.\n\n  - Copy SVG\n  - Copy React Icon Component\n  - Copy Vue Icon Component\n  - Download PNG\n  - Download SVG\n    \n<img src=\"https://sf1-dycdn-tos.pstatp.com/obj/eden-cn/lswwheh7nupwnuhog/icons/icon-tool.png\" alt=\"Icon Tools\" width=\"200px\"></img>   \n\n### Changelog\n[CHANGELOG.en-US](CHANGELOG.en-US.md) | [CHANGELOG.简体中文](CHANGELOG.zh-CN.md)\n"
