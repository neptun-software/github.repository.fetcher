There is an ongoing issue on fixing the support for iOS - [issue/14](https://github.com/mebjas/html5-qrcode/issues/14)\n\n### Framework support\nThe library can be easily used with several other frameworks, I have been adding examples for a few of them and would continue to add more.\n\n|<img src=\"https://scanapp.org/assets/github_assets/html5.png\" width=\"30px\" />| <img src=\"https://scanapp.org/assets/github_assets/vuejs.png\" width=\"30px\" />|<img src=\"https://scanapp.org/assets/github_assets/electron.png\" width=\"30px\" /> | <img src=\"https://scanapp.org/assets/github_assets/react.svg\" width=\"30px\" /> | <img src=\"https://seeklogo.com/images/L/lit-logo-6B43868CDC-seeklogo.com.png\" width=\"30px\" />\n| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| [Html5](./examples/html5) | [VueJs](./examples/vuejs) | [ElectronJs](./examples/electron) | [React](https://github.com/scanapp-org/html5-qrcode-react) | [Lit](./examples/lit)\n\n### Supported Code formats\nCode scanning is dependent on [Zxing-js](https://github.com/zxing-js/library) library. We will be working on top of it to add support for more types of code scanning. If you feel a certain type of code would be helpful to have, please file a feature request.\n\n| Code | Example |\n| ---- | ----- |\n| QR Code | <img src=\"https://scanapp.org/assets/github_assets/qr-code.png\" width=\"200px\" /> |\n| AZTEC | <img src=\"https://scanapp.org/assets/github_assets/aztec.png\" /> |\n| CODE_39|  <img src=\"https://scanapp.org/assets/github_assets/code_39.gif\" /> |\n| CODE_93| <img src=\"https://scanapp.org/assets/github_assets/code_93.gif\" />|\n| CODE_128| <img src=\"https://scanapp.org/assets/github_assets/code_128.gif\" />|\n| ITF| <img src=\"https://scanapp.org/assets/github_assets/itf.png\" />|\n| EAN_13|<img src=\"https://scanapp.org/assets/github_assets/ean13.jpeg\" /> |\n| EAN_8| <img src=\"https://scanapp.org/assets/github_assets/ean8.jpeg\" />|\n| PDF_417| <img src=\"https://scanapp.org/assets/github_assets/pdf417.png\" />|\n| UPC_A| <img src=\"https://scanapp.org/assets/github_assets/upca.jpeg\" />|\n| UPC_E| <img src=\"https://scanapp.org/assets/github_assets/upce.jpeg\" />|\n| DATA_MATRIX|<img src=\"https://scanapp.org/assets/github_assets/datamatrix.png\" /> |\n| MAXICODE*| <img src=\"https://scanapp.org/assets/github_assets/maxicode.gif\" /> |\n| RSS_14*| <img src=\"https://scanapp.org/assets/github_assets/rss14.gif\" />|\n| RSS_EXPANDED*|<img src=\"https://scanapp.org/assets/github_assets/rssexpanded.gif\" /> |\n\n> *Formats are not supported by our experimental integration with native\n> BarcodeDetector API integration ([Read more](/experimental.md)).\n\n## Description - [View Demo](https://blog.minhazav.dev/research/html5-qrcode.html)\n\n> See an end to end scanner experience at [scanapp.org](https://scanapp.org).\n\nThis is a cross-platform JavaScript library to integrate QR code, bar codes & a few other types of code scanning capabilities to your applications running on HTML5 compatible browser.\n\nSupports:\n-   Querying camera on the device (with user permissions)\n-   Rendering live camera feed, with easy to use user interface for scanning\n-   Supports scanning a different kind of QR codes, bar codes and other formats\n-   Supports selecting image files from the device for scanning codes\n\n## How to use\n\nFind detailed guidelines on how to use this library on [scanapp.org/html5-qrcode-docs](https://scanapp.org/html5-qrcode-docs/docs/intro).\n\n## Demo\n<img src=\"https://scanapp.org/assets/github_assets/qr-code.png\" width=\"200px\"><br />\n_Scan this image or visit [blog.minhazav.dev/research/html5-qrcode.html](https://blog.minhazav.dev/research/html5-qrcode.html)_\n\n### For more information\nCheck these articles on how to use this library:\n<!-- TODO(mebjas) Mirgate this link to blog.minhazav.dev -->\n-   [QR and barcode scanner using HTML and JavaScript](https://minhazav.medium.com/qr-and-barcode-scanner-using-html-and-javascript-2cdc937f793d)\n-   [HTML5 QR Code scanning — launched v1.0.1 without jQuery dependency and refactored Promise based APIs](https://blog.minhazav.dev/HTML5-QR-Code-scanning-launched-v1.0.1/).\n-   [HTML5 QR Code scanning with JavaScript — Support for scanning the local file and using default camera added (v1.0.5)](https://blog.minhazav.dev/HTML5-QR-Code-scanning-support-for-local-file-and-default-camera/)\n\n## Screenshots\n![screenshot](https://scanapp.org/assets/github_assets/screen.gif)<br />\n_Figure: Screenshot from Google Chrome running on MacBook Pro_\n\n## Documentation\nFind the full API documentation at [scanapp.org/html5-qrcode-docs/docs/apis](https://scanapp.org/html5-qrcode-docs/docs/apis).\n\n### Extra optional `configuration` in `start()` method\nConfiguration object that can be used to configure both the scanning behavior and the user interface (UI). Most of the fields have default properties that will be used unless a different value is provided. If you do not want to override anything, you can just pass in an empty object `{}`.\n\n#### `fps` — Integer, Example = 10\nA.K.A frame per second, the default value for this is 2, but it can be increased to get faster scanning. Increasing too high value could affect performance. Value `>1000` will simply fail.\n\n#### `qrbox` — `QrDimensions` or `QrDimensionFunction` (Optional), Example = `{ width: 250, height: 250 }`\nUse this property to limit the region of the viewfinder you want to use for scanning. The rest of the viewfinder would be shaded. For example, by passing config `{ qrbox : { width: 250, height: 250 } }`, the screen will look like:\n\n<img src=\"https://scanapp.org/assets/github_assets/screen.gif\" />\n\nThis can be used to set a rectangular scanning area with config like:\n\n```js\nlet config = { qrbox : { width: 400, height: 150 } }\n```\n\nThis config also accepts a function of type\n```ts\n/**\n  * A function that takes in the width and height of the video stream \n* and returns QrDimensions.\n* \n* Viewfinder refers to the video showing camera stream.\n*/\ntype QrDimensionFunction =\n    (viewfinderWidth: number, viewfinderHeight: number) => QrDimensions;\n```\n\nThis allows you to set dynamic QR box dimensions based on the video dimensions. See this blog article for example: [Setting dynamic QR box size in Html5-qrcode - ScanApp blog](https://scanapp.org/blog/2022/01/09/setting-dynamic-qr-box-size-in-html5-qrcode.html)\n\n> This might be desirable for bar code scanning.\n\nIf this value is not set, no shaded QR box will be rendered and the scanner will scan the entire area of video stream.\n\n#### `aspectRatio` — Float, Example 1.777778 for 16:9 aspect ratio\nUse this property to render the video feed in a certain aspect ratio. Passing a nonstandard aspect ratio like `100000:1` could lead to the video feed not even showing up. Ideal values can be:\n| Value | Aspect Ratio | Use Case |\n| ----- | ------------ | -------- |\n|1.333334 | 4:3 | Standard camera aspect ratio |\n|1.777778 | 16:9 | Full screen, cinematic |\n|1.0 | 1:1 | Square view |\n\nIf you do not pass any value, the whole viewfinder would be used for scanning. \n**Note**: this value has to be smaller than the width and height of the `QR code HTML element`.\n\n#### `disableFlip` — Boolean (Optional), default = false\nBy default, the scanner can scan for horizontally flipped QR Codes. This also enables scanning QR code using the front camera on mobile devices which are sometimes mirrored. This is `false` by default and I recommend changing this only if:\n-   You are sure that the camera feed cannot be mirrored (Horizontally flipped)\n-   You are facing performance issues with this enabled.\n\nHere's an example of a normal and mirrored QR Code\n| Normal QR Code | Mirrored QR Code |\n| ----- | ---- |\n| <img src=\"https://scanapp.org/assets/github_assets/qr-code.png\" width=\"200px\" /> | <img src=\"https://scanapp.org/assets/github_assets/qr-code-flipped.png\" width=\"200px\" /><br /> |\n\n#### `rememberLastUsedCamera` — Boolean (Optional), default = true\nIf `true` the last camera used by the user and weather or not permission was granted would be remembered in the local storage. If the user has previously granted permissions — the request permission option in the UI will be skipped and the last selected camera would be launched automatically for scanning.\n\nIf `true` the library shall remember if the camera permissions were previously\ngranted and what camera was last used. If the permissions is already granted for\n\"camera\", QR code scanning will automatically * start for previously used camera.\n\n#### `supportedScanTypes` - `Array<Html5QrcodeScanType> | []`\n> This is only supported for `Html5QrcodeScanner`.\n\nDefault = `[Html5QrcodeScanType.SCAN_TYPE_CAMERA, Html5QrcodeScanType.SCAN_TYPE_FILE]`\n\nThis field can be used to:\n-   Limit support to either of `Camera` or `File` based scan.\n-   Change default scan type.\n\nHow to use:\n\n```js\nfunction onScanSuccess(decodedText, decodedResult) {\n  // handle the scanned code as you like, for example:\n  console.log(`Code matched = ${decodedText}`, decodedResult);\n}\n\nlet config = {\n  fps: 10,\n  qrbox: {width: 100, height: 100},\n  rememberLastUsedCamera: true,\n  // Only support camera scan type.\n  supportedScanTypes: [Html5QrcodeScanType.SCAN_TYPE_CAMERA]\n};\n\nlet html5QrcodeScanner = new Html5QrcodeScanner(\n  \"reader\", config, /* verbose= */ false);\nhtml5QrcodeScanner.render(onScanSuccess);\n```\n\nFor file based scan only choose:\n```js\nsupportedScanTypes: [Html5QrcodeScanType.SCAN_TYPE_FILE]\n```\n\nFor supporting both as it is today, you can ignore this field or set as:\n```js\nsupportedScanTypes: [\n  Html5QrcodeScanType.SCAN_TYPE_CAMERA,\n  Html5QrcodeScanType.SCAN_TYPE_FILE]\n```\n\nTo set the file based scan as defult change the order:\n```js\nsupportedScanTypes: [\n  Html5QrcodeScanType.SCAN_TYPE_FILE,\n  Html5QrcodeScanType.SCAN_TYPE_CAMERA]\n```\n\n#### `showTorchButtonIfSupported` - `boolean | undefined`\n> This is only supported for `Html5QrcodeScanner`.\n\nIf `true` the rendered UI will have button to turn flash on or off based on device + browser support. The value is `false` by default.\n\n### Scanning only specific formats\nBy default, both camera stream and image files are scanned against all the\nsupported code formats.  Both `Html5QrcodeScanner` and `Html5Qrcode` classes can\n be configured to only support a subset of supported formats. Supported formats\nare defined in\n[enum Html5QrcodeSupportedFormats](https://github.com/mebjas/html5-qrcode/blob/master/src/core.ts#L14).\n\n```ts\nenum Html5QrcodeSupportedFormats {\n  QR_CODE = 0,\n  AZTEC,\n  CODABAR,\n  CODE_39,\n  CODE_93,\n  CODE_128,\n  DATA_MATRIX,\n  MAXICODE,\n  ITF,\n  EAN_13,\n  EAN_8,\n  PDF_417,\n  RSS_14,\n  RSS_EXPANDED,\n  UPC_A,\n  UPC_E,\n  UPC_EAN_EXTENSION,\n}\n```\n\nI recommend using this only if you need to explicitly omit support for certain\nformats or want to reduce the number of scans done per second for performance\nreasons.\n\n#### Scanning only QR code with `Html5Qrcode`\n```js\nconst html5QrCode = new Html5Qrcode(\n  \"reader\", { formatsToSupport: [ Html5QrcodeSupportedFormats.QR_CODE ] });\nconst qrCodeSuccessCallback = (decodedText, decodedResult) => {\n    /* handle success */\n};\nconst config = { fps: 10, qrbox: { width: 250, height: 250 } };\n\n// If you want to prefer front camera\nhtml5QrCode.start({ facingMode: \"user\" }, config, qrCodeSuccessCallback);\n```\n\n#### Scanning only QR code and UPC codes with `Html5QrcodeScanner`\n```js\nfunction onScanSuccess(decodedText, decodedResult) {\n  // Handle the scanned code as you like, for example:\n  console.log(`Code matched = ${decodedText}`, decodedResult);\n}\n\nconst formatsToSupport = [\n  Html5QrcodeSupportedFormats.QR_CODE,\n  Html5QrcodeSupportedFormats.UPC_A,\n  Html5QrcodeSupportedFormats.UPC_E,\n  Html5QrcodeSupportedFormats.UPC_EAN_EXTENSION,\n];\nconst html5QrcodeScanner = new Html5QrcodeScanner(\n  \"reader\",\n  {\n    fps: 10,\n    qrbox: { width: 250, height: 250 },\n    formatsToSupport: formatsToSupport\n  },\n  /* verbose= */ false);\nhtml5QrcodeScanner.render(onScanSuccess);\n```\n\n## Experimental features\nThe library now supports some experimental features which are supported in the\nlibrary but not recommended for production usage either due to limited testing\ndone or limited compatibility for underlying APIs used. Read more about it [here](/experimental.md).\nSome experimental features include:\n-   [Support for BarcodeDetector JavaScript API](/experimental.md)\n\n## How to modify and build\n1.

In such cases the camera selection has\nempty named options.\n\nTo make the UX better, the library will give custom names to the cameras.\n\n-   Github Issue: [Issue#578](https://github.com/mebjas/html5-qrcode/issues/578)\n\nFor example in Duck Duck Go browser which has this behavior, it will look like\nthis\n\n| Before selection | After selection |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![Screenshot_20221105-005544](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3007365/200032567-eb50b4f0-e25f-4bdb-a233-fcbb906122aa.png) | ![Screenshot_20221105-005550](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3007365/200032557-21679229-3d21-4212-a22f-1f2558b6f6b6.png) |\n\n\n### Version 2.2.7\n\n#### Add support for custom CSS\nDeveloper / User Story: As a developer I can write custom CSS for `Html5QrcodeScanner`.\n\nFeature request: [Issue#389](https://github.com/mebjas/html5-qrcode/issues/389)\n\nList of CSS class and IDs added.\n\n1. All key elements will have a common CSS class `html5-qrcode-element`. This way developers can customise element by element. For example:\n\n```css\nbutton.html5-qrcode-element {\n    color: 'red';\n    border: '1px solid red';\n}\n```\n\nKey elements are:\n-    Request camera permission button.\n-    \"Scan and image file\" vs \"Scan using camera directly\" link.\n-    \"File selection\" input ('file')\n-    Start or Stop camera button.\n-    Camera selection Select element\n-    Torch button\n\n2. key elements will have specific IDs defined in `src/ui/scanner/base.ts`. This can be used to customise per elements.\n\n\n##### TODOs\n-   [ ] Document in a blog post\n-   [ ] Add pointer in qrcode.minhazav.dev\n-   [ ] Add pointer in Readme\n\n#### Change file selection UI from `input` to `button`\nModified the UI a little to hide the file selection as input and replace with\ncustom button and javascript based solution.\n\nOne motivation here is this will allow more uniform style for the widget.\n\n#### Graduate `useBarCodeDetectorIfSupported` to `Html5QrcodeConfigs`.\n`useBarCodeDetectorIfSupported` was tested as an experimental configuration for\na long time and has proven to be very efficient and well supported. It has been\ntested in [ScanApp](https://scanapp.org) for quiet some time.\n\nConsidering this experimental API is not well documented, it makes it hard for\nfolks to discover it. By graduating this configuration to `Html5QrcodeConfigs` I\nhope to make it more discoverable.\n\nIn this version the `ExperimentalFeaturesConfig#useBarCodeDetectorIfSupported`\nhas been marked deprecated but not removed due to backwards compatibility\nreasons. Users can set either of them but `Html5QrcodeConfigs` one will take\nprecedence if set.\n\nOnce further support is added to browsers, this can be set as true by default.\n\n### Version 2.2.5 & Version 2.2.6\n\n> Small minification fix in Version 2.2.6.\n\n#### Added support for turning `torch` On and Off in `Html5QrcodeScanner`.\nOn supported devices + browsers.\n\nThis new feature will implement the feature request - [Issue#129](https://github.com/mebjas/html5-qrcode/issues/129) and add support for torch (also called flash) on supported devices and browsers.\n\nSo far I have confirmed functionality on Samsung Flip 4 Chrome and Internet (Samsung's default browser).\n\nThis is only supported on `Html5QrcodeScanner` and can be enabled using the config like this.\n\n```ts\nlet html5QrcodeScanner = new Html5QrcodeScanner(\n    \"reader\", \n    { \n        fps: 10,\n        qrbox: qrboxFunction,\n        // Important notice: this is experimental feature, use it at your\n        // own risk. See documentation in\n        // mebjas@/html5-qrcode/src/experimental-features.ts\n        experimentalFeatures: {\n            useBarCodeDetectorIfSupported: true\n        },\n        rememberLastUsedCamera: true,\n        aspectRatio: 1.7777778,\n        showTorchButtonIfSupported: true\n    });\n```\n\nThe `showTorchButtonIfSupported: true` part is the crucial one. It's off by default for now as I don't like the UI very much.\n\n#### Added support for `getRunningTrackSettings()`.\n\nAdded a new API to get settings (type: [MediaTrackSettings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaTrackSettings)) for running video streams while QR code is being scanned.\n\n```ts\n/**\n * Returns the object containing the current values of each constrainable\n * property of the running video track.\n * \n * Read more: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack/getSettings\n * \n * Important:\n *  1. Must be called only if the camera based scanning is in progress.\n *\n * @returns the supported settings of the running video track.\n * @throws error if the scanning is not in running state.\n */\npublic getRunningTrackSettings(): MediaTrackSettings {}\n```\n\nThis API can be used to check the currently applied settings on the running video stream like weather torch is on or not.\n\n#### `getRunningTrackCapabilities(..)` and `applyVideoConstraints(..)` out of beta.\n\nBoth `Html5Qrcode` and `Html5QrcodeScanner` classes had support for following APIs.\n\n```ts\n/**\n * Returns the capabilities of the running video track.\n * \n * Read more: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack/getConstraints\n * \n * Important:\n *  1. Must be called only if the camera based scanning is in progress.\n *\n * @returns the capabilities of a running video track.\n * @throws error if the scanning is not in running state.\n */\npublic getRunningTrackCapabilities(): MediaTrackCapabilities {}\n\n/**\n * Apply a video constraints on running video track from camera.\n *\n * Important:\n *  1. Must be called only if the camera based scanning is in progress.\n *  2. Changing aspectRatio while scanner is running is not yet supported.\n *\n * @param {MediaTrackConstraints} specifies a variety of video or camera\n *  controls as defined in\n *  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaTrackConstraints\n * @returns a Promise which succeeds if the passed constraints are applied,\n *  fails otherwise.\n * @throws error if the scanning is not in running state.\n */\npublic applyVideoConstraints(videoConstaints: MediaTrackConstraints)\n    : Promise<any> {}\n```\n\nThese have now been taken out of beta and publicly documented. More blog articles to be published for these.\n\n#### Sponsorship\n\nThanks <a href=\"https://github.com/bujjivadu\"><img src=\"https://github.com/bujjivadu.png\" width=\"40px\" alt=\"\" /></a> for sponsorship!\n\n### Version 2.2.4\n - Improved support for Huawei browser with [PR#563](https://github.com/mebjas/html5-qrcode/pull/563), Contribution by [jackhe16](https://github.com/jackhe16).\n - Fixed QR Border Placement with [PR#555](https://github.com/mebjas/html5-qrcode/pull/555), Contribution by [allanbrault](https://github.com/allanbrault).\n - Fixed config issue ([Issue#494](https://github.com/mebjas/html5-qrcode/issues/494)) with [PR#521](https://github.com/mebjas/html5-qrcode/pull/521), Contribution by [rlueder](https://github.com/rlueder).\n\n### Version 2.2.1\n - Added support for `supportedScanType` in `Html5QrcodeScanner`. This feature\n    was implemented by our latest contributor - [mohsinaav@](https://github.com/mohsinaav)\n  \n   Now users can decide to only use camera based scan or file based scan or use\n   them in different order. How to use:\n\n\n   ```js\n    function onScanSuccess(decodedText, decodedResult) {\n        // handle the scanned code as you like, for example:\n        console.log(`Code matched = ${decodedText}`, decodedResult);\n    }\n\n    let config = {\n        fps: 10,\n        qrbox: {width: 100, height: 100},\n        rememberLastUsedCamera: true,\n        // Only support camera scan type.\n        supportedScanTypes: [Html5QrcodeScanType.SCAN_TYPE_CAMERA]\n    };\n\n    let html5QrcodeScanner = new Html5QrcodeScanner(\n        \"reader\", config, /* verbose= */ false);\n    html5QrcodeScanner.render(onScanSuccess);\n   ```\n\n   For file based scan only choose:\n   ```js\n   supportedScanTypes: [Html5QrcodeScanType.SCAN_TYPE_FILE]\n   ```\n\n   For supporting both as it is today, you can ignore this field or set as:\n   ```js\n   supportedScanTypes: [\n       Html5QrcodeScanType.SCAN_TYPE_CAMERA,\n        Html5QrcodeScanType.SCAN_TYPE_FILE]\n   ```\n\n   To set the file based scan as defult change the order:\n   ```js\n      supportedScanTypes: [\n        Html5QrcodeScanType.SCAN_TYPE_FILE,\n        Html5QrcodeScanType.SCAN_TYPE_CAMERA]\n   ```\n\n### Version 2.2.0\n-   `config.qrbox` now supports consuming function of type\n\n    ```ts\n    /**\n     * A function that takes in the width and height of the video stream \n    * and returns QrDimensions.\n    * \n    * Viewfinder refers to the video showing camera stream.\n    */\n    export type QrDimensionFunction =\n        (viewfinderWidth: number, viewfinderHeight: number) => QrDimensions;\n    ```\n\n    This will allow developers to define custom QR box dimensions for their\n    implementations.\n\n    Example:\n    ```js\n    function onScanSuccess(decodedText, decodedResult) {\n        // handle the scanned code as you like, for example:\n        console.log(`Code matched = ${decodedText}`, decodedResult);\n    }\n\n    // Square QR box with edge size = 70% of the smaller edge of the viewfinder.\n    let qrboxFunction = function(viewfinderWidth, viewfinderHeight) {\n        let minEdgePercentage = 0.7; // 70%\n        let minEdgeSize = Math.min(viewfinderWidth, viewfinderHeight);\n        let qrboxSize = Math.floor(minEdgeSize * minEdgePercentage);\n        return {\n            width: qrboxSize,\n            height: qrboxSize\n        };\n    }\n\n    let html5QrcodeScanner = new Html5QrcodeScanner(\n        \"reader\",\n        { fps: 10, qrbox: qrboxFunction },\n        /* verbose= */ false);\n    html5QrcodeScanner.render(onScanSuccess);\n    ```\n\n### Version 2.1.6\n-   Add `alt` information to info icon to improve accessibility.\n\n### Version 2.1.5\n\n-   Changed behavior from throwing error in case `qrbox.width` or `qrbox` is larger than the width of the root element. In such cases the dimension will automatically be truncated to the size of root element and will throw a warning based on verbosity settings. This should address [issue#357](https://github.com/mebjas/html5-qrcode/issues/357)\n-   If `qrbox` is not set in config for either `Html5QrcodeScanner` or `Html5Qrcode` the scanning box will default to the size of video stream. From UI perspective there will be no shaded QR scanning box visible to user. This should resolve [Issue#343](https://github.com/mebjas/html5-qrcode/issues/343).\n-   Calling `Html5QrcodeScanner#clear()` will also clear the UI rendered due to image based scan. This should address [issue#193](https://github.com/mebjas/html5-qrcode/issues/193)\n\n### Version 2.1.4\n\n#### Huge thanks to [Ben Richardson](https://github.com/ben-gy) for one time sponsorship!!\nThis is helpful in keeping the project in shape! Cheers to you!!\n\n[See sponsorship dashboard](https://github.com/sponsors/mebjas)\n\n### Changelog\n-   Fix bug in `stop()` method in `Html5Qrcode` class.\n-   Fix a minor UI error, where error message shown due to a certain camera not working, is not hidden when a functional camera is selected.\n-   [Feature Request#356](https://github.com/mebjas/html5-qrcode/issues/356) - Freeze the image (not clear) on success.\n\nNow calling `html5qrcode.pause(/* shouldPauseVideo */ true)` or `html5qrcodeScanner.pause(/* shouldPauseVideo */ true)` will freeze the viewfinder and calling corresponding `resume()` will unfreeze the viewfinder. Calling with `false` or no argument will just pause scanning without effecting the viewfinder.\n\n### Version 2.1.3\n-   Reduce the assets size using SVG instead of GIF files.\n\n### Version 2.1.2\n-   If there is only one camera detected, automatically use that.\n-   Cosmetic fixes: show `Launching Camera...` in button when launching the camera.\n\n### Version 2.1.1\n-   Fixed dashboard section exceeding the parent HTML element width.\n-   Added support for following beta APIs which allows modifying running video\n    stream state, which camera stream is running.\n    ```js\n    /**\n     * Returns the capabilities of the running video track.\n     * \n     * Note: Should only be called if {@code Html5QrcodeScanner#getState()}\n     *   returns {@code Html5QrcodeScannerState#SCANNING} or \n     *   {@code Html5QrcodeScannerState#PAUSED}.\n     *\n     * @beta This is an experimental API\n     * @returns the capabilities of a running video track.\n     * @throws error if the scanning is not in running state.\n     */\n    public getRunningTrackCapabilities(): MediaTrackCapabilities;\n\n    /**\n     * Apply a video constraints on running video track from camera.\n     *\n     * Note: Should only be called if {@code Html5QrcodeScanner#getState()}\n     *   returns {@code Html5QrcodeScannerState#SCANNING} or \n     *   {@code Html5QrcodeScannerState#PAUSED}.\n     *\n     * @beta This is an experimental API\n     * @param {MediaTrackConstraints} specifies a variety of video or camera\n     *  controls as defined in\n     *  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaTrackConstraints\n     * @returns a Promise which succeeds if the passed constraints are applied,\n     *  fails otherwise.\n     * @throws error if the scanning is not in running state.\n     */\n    public applyVideoConstraints(videoConstaints: MediaTrackConstraints)   \n    ```\n\n    **Important note**: Both these APIs are beta and not publicly documented.\n\n-   Support for pausing and resuming code scanning in camera scan mode. New APIs\n    are added to both `Html5QrcodeScanner` and `Html5Qrcode`. They should only be called when the scanner state is `Html5QrcodeScannerState#SCANNING` (== `2`) or\n    `Html5QrcodeScannerState#PAUSED` (== `3`).\n    \n    APIs added:\n    ```js\n    /**\n     * Pauses the ongoing scan.\n     * \n     * Note: this will not stop the viewfinder, but stop decoding camera stream.\n     * \n     * @throws error if method is called when scanner is not in scanning state.\n     */\n    public pause();\n\n    /**\n     * Resumes the paused scan.\n     * \n     * Note: with this caller will start getting results in success and error\n     * callbacks.\n     * \n     * @throws error if method is called when scanner is not in paused state.\n     */\n    public resume();\n\n        /**\n     * Gets state of the camera scan.\n     *\n     * @returns state of type {@enum ScannerState}.\n     */\n    public getState(): Html5QrcodeScannerState;\n    ```\n\n    Example usage:\n\n    ```js\n    let html5QrcodeScanner = new Html5QrcodeScanner(\n        \"reader\", \n        { \n            fps: 10,\n            qrbox: {width: 250, height: 250},\n            rememberLastUsedCamera: true,\n            aspectRatio: 1.7777778\n        });\n\n    function onScanSuccess(decodedText, decodedResult) {\n        if (html5QrcodeScanner.getState() \n            !== Html5QrcodeScannerState.NOT_STARTED) {\n            // Add this check to ensure success callback is not being called\n            // from file based scanner.\n\n            // Pause on scan result\n            html5QrcodeScanner.pause();\n        }\n\n\n        // Handle your business logic\n        // ...\n\n        // .. ok to resume now or elsewhere.\n        // just call html5QrcodeScanner.resume();\n        // Make sure to check if the state is !== NOT_STARTED\n    }\n\thtml5QrcodeScanner.render(onScanSuccess);\n    ```\n\n    Note: when camera scan is paused it adds a UI element indicating that state.\n\n### Version 2.1.0\n-   `[Fixed]` issues related to using with lodash - https://github.com/mebjas/html5-qrcode/issues/284\n-   `[Fixed]` Unable to use with typescript definition - https://github.com/mebjas/html5-qrcode/issues/283\n-   `[Fixed]` Not working with react - https://github.com/mebjas/html5-qrcode/issues/322\n-   `[Fixed]` TypeError: Html5QrcodeScanner is not a constructor - https://github.com/mebjas/html5-qrcode/issues/270\n-   `[Fixed]` TypeError: window._ is undefined - https://github.com/mebjas/html5-qrcode/issues/248\n\n### Version 2.0.13\nAdded ability to set custom width and height to the scanner with `config.qrbox` argument.\n\nNow we can pass `config.qrbox` argument as instance of interface `QrDimensions`.\n\n```js\nfunction onScanSuccess(decodedText, decodedResult) { /* handle success. */ }\nfunction onScanFailure(error) { /* handle failure. */ }\n\nlet config = { fps: 10, qrbox: { width: 250, height: 250 } };\n\nlet html5QrcodeScanner = new Html5QrcodeScanner(\n    \"reader\", config , /* verbose= */ false);\nhtml5QrcodeScanner.render(onScanSuccess, onScanFailure);\n```\n\nFor a rectangular QR Scanning box we can set it to something like:\n```js\n// .. rest of the code\nlet config = { fps: 10, qrbox: { width: 400, height: 150 } };\n\nlet html5QrcodeScanner = new Html5QrcodeScanner(\n    \"reader\", config , /* verbose= */ false);\nhtml5QrcodeScanner.render(onScanSuccess, onScanFailure);\n```\n\n### Version 2.0.12\n-   Redundant information in the top status bar removed.\n-   Added support for remembering permission and last camera used. This feature is on by default. Can be turned on or off using `rememberLastUsedCamera` flag in `Html5QrcodeScannerConfig`. How to explicitly enable it:\n    ```js\n      function onScanSuccess(decodedText, decodedResult) {\n          // handle success.\n      }\n      let html5QrcodeScanner = new Html5QrcodeScanner(\n        \"reader\", \n        { \n            fps: 10,\n            qrbox: 250,\n            rememberLastUsedCamera: true\n            // ^ set this to false to disable this.\n        });\n      html5QrcodeScanner.render(onScanSuccess);\n      ```\n\n### Version 2.0.11\n -    Add support for native [BarcodeDetector](https://web.dev/shape-detection/#barcodedetector) based scanning.\n      - On Chrome `ZXing` based decoder takes `20-25` ms on my Mac book pro 16.\n      - On Chrome `BarcodeDetector` based decoder takes `8.6-11 ms` on my Mac book pro 16.\n      ```js\n      // How to enable\n      // Note: will only work if browser / OS supports this HTML api.\n      // Read more: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/BarcodeDetector#browser_compatibility\n      function onScanSuccess(decodedText, decodedResult) {\n          // handle success.\n      }\n      let html5QrcodeScanner = new Html5QrcodeScanner(\n        \"reader\", \n        { \n            fps: 10,\n            qrbox: 250,\n            experimentalFeatures: {\n                useBarCodeDetectorIfSupported: true\n            }\n        });\n      html5QrcodeScanner.render(onScanSuccess);\n      ```\n\n### Version 2.0.10\n -    Migrate from assets hosted on Github to embedded base64 assets.\n\n### Version 2.0.9\n -    Added support for returning the type of code scanned ([feature request](https://github.com/mebjas/html5-qrcode/issues/224))\n\n### Version 2.0.8\n - Added support for configuring supported formats in `Html5Qrcode` & `Html5QrcodeScanner`.\n\n### Version 2.0.6\n - [Issue#211](https://github.com/mebjas/html5-qrcode/issues/211) fixed - swapped text for file based scanning and camera scanning during typescript migration.\n\n### Version 2.0.5\n - [Issue#202](https://github.com/mebjas/html5-qrcode/issues/202) fixed - error logs dumped to console even if verbose flag is not set in `Html5Qrcode`.\n\n### Version 2.0.4\n - **Source code migrated from javascript to typescript.**\n - [Issue#198](https://github.com/mebjas/html5-qrcode/issues/198) fixed - Fixing autoplay in Cordova Android apps\n\n### Version 2.0.3\n - Show specific error messages if web-cam access fails due to insecure contexts like web page being neither `https` or `localhost`.\n\n### Version 2.0.2\n - Bug fix: [Compatibility - [Android 11] [Chrome 88.0 ] - [Call stopScan will cause crash]](https://github.com/mebjas/html5-qrcode/issues/159) with PR from [MrGussio](https://github.com/MrGussio) - https://github.com/mebjas/html5-qrcode/pull/169\n\n### Version 2.0.1\n - **Bug fix**: Zxing-js library was logging to console even if `verbose` is false - https://github.com/mebjas/html5-qrcode/issues/175\n\n### Version 2.0.0\n - **Major Change** Migrated from Lazarsoft QR Code scanning to `ZXing-js`.\n   - More robust support for QR Code scanning\n   - Support for barcode scanning in the following formats\n     ```\n      ZXing.BarcodeFormat.QR_CODE,\n      ZXing.BarcodeFormat.AZTEC,\n      ZXing.BarcodeFormat.CODABAR,\n      ZXing.BarcodeFormat.CODE_39,\n      ZXing.BarcodeFormat.CODE_93,\n      ZXing.BarcodeFormat.CODE_128,\n      ZXing.BarcodeFormat.DATA_MATRIX,\n      ZXing.BarcodeFormat.MAXICODE,\n      ZXing.BarcodeFormat.ITF,\n      ZXing.BarcodeFormat.EAN_13,\n      ZXing.BarcodeFormat.EAN_8,\n      ZXing.BarcodeFormat.PDF_417,\n      ZXing.BarcodeFormat.RSS_14,\n      ZXing.BarcodeFormat.RSS_EXPANDED,\n      ZXing.BarcodeFormat.UPC_A,\n      ZXing.BarcodeFormat.UPC_E,\n      ZXing.BarcodeFormat.UPC_EAN_EXTENSION\n      ```\n   - Library size increased to `319Kb`.\n\n### Version 1.2.3\n - Added support for `videoConstraints` in config as an experimental config.\n    ```js\n        /* videoConstraints: {MediaTrackConstraints}, Optional\n         *  @beta(this config is not well supported yet).\n         *\n         *  Important: When passed this will override other configurations\n         *  like 'cameraIdOrConfig' or configurations like 'aspectRatio'.\n         *\n         *  videoConstraints should be of type {@code MediaTrackConstraints}\n         *  as defined in\n         *  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaTrackConstraints\n         *  and is used to specify a variety of video or camera controls\n         *  like: aspect ratio, facing mode, video frame rate.\n         */\n    ```\n    If passed this will override `cameraIdOrConfig` and `aspectRatio`.\n\n - Added two new experimental APIs in `Html5Qrcode` class\n    - `getRunningTrackCapabilities()` - New\n\n        ```js\n        /**\n         * Returns the capabilities of the running video track.\n         * \n         * @beta This is an experimental API\n         * @returns the capabilities of a running video track.\n         * @throws error if the scanning is not in running state.\n         */\n        getRunningTrackCapabilities() {}\n        ```\n    - `applyVideoConstraints(videoConstaints)` - New\n\n        ```js\n        /**\n         * Apply a video constraints on running video track.\n         * \n         * Important:\n         *  1. Must be called only if the camera based scanning is in progress.\n         *  2. Changing aspectRatio while scanner is running is not yet supported.\n         * \n         * @beta This is an experimental API\n         * @param {MediaTrackConstraints} specifies a variety of video or camera\n         *  controls as defined in \n         *  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaTrackConstraints\n         * @returns a Promise which succeeds if the passed constraints are applied,\n         *  fails otherwise.\n         * @throws error if the scanning is not in running state.\n         */\n        applyVideoConstraints(videoConstaints) {}\n        ```\n\n### Version 1.2.2\n - Bug fix in `Html5QrcodeScanner` - file scanning.\n\n### Version 1.2.1\n + Added support for `facingMode` constraing in `Html5Qrcode#start`\n \n**Update**:\nIn mobile devices you may want users to directly scan the QR code using the back camera or the front camera for some use cases. For such cases you can avoid using the exact camera device id that you get from `Html5Qrcode.getCameras()`. The `start()` method allows passing constraints in place of camera device id similar to [html5 web API syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia#Syntax). You can start scanning like mentioned in these examples:\n\n```js\nconst html5QrCode = new Html5Qrcode(\"#reader\");\nconst qrCodeSuccessCallback = message => { /* handle success */ }\nconst config = { fps: 10, qrbox: 250 };\n\n// If you want to prefer front camera\nhtml5QrCode.start({ facingMode: \"user\" }, config, qrCodeSuccessCallback);\n\n// If you want to prefer back camera\nhtml5QrCode.start({ facingMode: \"environment\" }, config, qrCodeSuccessCallback);\n\n// Select front camera or fail with `OverconstrainedError`.\nhtml5QrCode.start({ facingMode: { exact: \"user\"} }, config, qrCodeSuccessCallback);\n\n// Select back camera or fail with `OverconstrainedError`.\nhtml5QrCode.start({ facingMode: { exact: \"environment\"} }, config, qrCodeSuccessCallback);\n```\n\n### Version 1.2.0\n + Added support for scanning mirrored QR code, or scanning in case camera feed is mirrored (horizontally flipped).\n\n### Version 1.1.9\n + Added support for `config.aspectRatio` in both `Html5Qrcode` and `Html5QrcodeScanner`\n\n    Use this property to render the video feed in a certain aspect ratio. Passing a nonstandard aspect ratio like `100000:1` could lead to the video feed not even showing up. Ideal values can be:\n    | Value | Aspect Ratio | Use Case |\n    | ----- | ------------ | -------- |\n    |1.333334 | 4:3 | Standard camera aspect ratio |\n    |1.777778 | 16:9 | Fullscreen, cinematic |\n    |1.0 | 1:1 | Square view |\n\n\n### Version 1.1.8\n + Bug fix on `Html5QrcodeScanner#clear()`\n\n### Version 1.1.7\n + `Html5QrcodeScanner#clear()` returns a `Promise`.\n\n### Version 1.1.6\n + Bug fixes\n   + [#74](https://github.com/mebjas/html5-qrcode/issues/74) - state errors on file based scanning.\n\n### Version 1.1.0\n + Added support for a full scanner with end to end UI - `Html5QrcodeScanner`\n\n### Version 1.0.9\n + Fixed issue [#41](https://github.com/mebjas/html5-qrcode/issues/41)\n + Added support for verbose logging in the library as a constructor argument.\n\n### Version 1.0.8\n + Added support for realtime feedbacks on viewfinder for inline scanning\n    |Platform|Screenshot|\n    |------|-----------|\n    |On PC | ![](./assets/screen.gif)|\n    |On Android|![](./assets/pixel3.gif)|\n\n### Version 1.0.7\n + Fixed the video size issue in [#21](https://github.com/mebjas/html5-qrcode/issues/21)\n + Removed fixed height of viewfinder, now the height is based on the video stream. The width is honored if the input element has a default width. Otherwise default width is applied.\n + If `config.qrbox` is greater than derived height, the config is ignored & no shading is applied.\n + The sequence of steps have changed\n    + First we get the video feed from the selected camera\n    + Then we render video\n    + Then based on the height of the video we set the canvas and start scanning.\n + For file scanning, if the container element has some height or width both are honored. \n    Otherwise default width is applied and height is derived from the image.\n\n### Older versions\nMostly covered in [readme](./README.md), changelog tracking started since `version 1.0.7`\n"
