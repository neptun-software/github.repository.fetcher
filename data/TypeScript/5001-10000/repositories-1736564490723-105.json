          "content": "# Building Wave Terminal\n\nThese instructions are for setting up dependencies and building Wave Terminal from source on macOS, Linux, and Windows.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n### OS-specific dependencies\n\nSee [Minimum requirements](README.md#minimum-requirements) to learn whether your OS is supported.\n\n#### macOS\n\nmacOS does not have any platform-specific dependencies.\n\n#### Linux\n\nYou must have `zip` installed. We also require the [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) compiler for statically linking CGO.\n\nDebian/Ubuntu:\n\n```sh\nsudo apt install zip snapd\nsudo snap install zig --classic --beta\n```\n\nFedora/RHEL:\n\n```sh\nsudo dnf install zip zig\n```\n\nArch:\n\n```sh\nsudo pacman -S zip zig\n```\n\n##### For packaging\n\nFor packaging, the following additional packages are required:\n\n- `fpm` &mdash; If you're on x64 you can skip this. If you're on ARM64, install fpm via [Gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/fpm)\n- `rpm` &mdash; If you're not on Fedora, install RPM via your package manager.\n- `snapd` &mdash; If your distro doesn't already include it, [install `snapd`](https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd)\n- `lxd` &mdash; [Installation instructions](https://canonical.com/lxd/install)\n- `snapcraft` &mdash; Run `sudo snap install snapcraft --classic`\n- `libarchive-tools` &mdash; Install via your package manager\n- `libopenjp2-tools` &mdash; Install via your package manager\n- `squashfs-tools` &mdash; Install via your package manager\n\n#### Windows\n\nYou will need the [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) compiler for statically linking CGO.\n\nYou can find installation instructions for Zig on Windows [here](https://ziglang.org/learn/getting-started/#managers).\n\n### Task\n\nDownload and install Task (to run the build commands): https://taskfile.dev/installation/\n\nTask is a modern equivalent to GNU Make. We use it to coordinate our build steps. You can find our full Task configuration in [Taskfile.yml](Taskfile.yml).\n\n### Go\n\nDownload and install Go via your package manager or directly from the website: https://go.dev/doc/install\n\n### NodeJS\n\nMake sure you have a NodeJS 22 LTS installed.\n\nSee NodeJS's website for platform-specific instructions: https://nodejs.org/en/download\n\n### Yarn Modern\n\nOnce you have NodeJS installed, you'll need to enable Corepack so that Yarn Modern can work:\n\n```sh\ncorepack enable\n```\n\nIf your NodeJS distribution does not ship with Corepack, you can install it manually using NPM:\n\n```sh\nnpm install -g corepack\ncorepack enable\n```\n\nCorepack's official documentation says to uninstall Yarn and PnPM first, but this is probably overkill. If you have any issues, try removing them from your system before continuing.\n\nFor more information on Corepack, check out [this link](https://yarnpkg.com/corepack).\n\n## Clone the Repo\n\n```sh\ngit clone git@github.com:wavetermdev/waveterm.git\n```\n\nor\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm.git\n```\n\n## Install code dependencies\n\nThe first time you clone the repo, you'll need to run the following to load the dependencies. If you ever have issues building the app, try running this again:\n\n```sh\ntask init\n```\n\n## Build and Run\n\nAll the methods below will install Node and Go dependencies when they run the first time. All these should be run from within the Git repository.\n\n### Development server\n\nRun the following command to build the app and run it via Vite's development server (this enables Hot Module Reloading):\n\n```sh\ntask dev\n```\n\n### Standalone\n\nRun the following command to build the app and run it standalone, without the development server. This will not reload on change:\n\n```sh\ntask start\n```\n\n### Packaged\n\nRun the following command to generate a production build and package it. This lets you install the app locally. All artifacts will be placed in `make/`.\n\n```sh\ntask package\n```\n\nIf you're on Linux ARM64, run the following:\n\n```sh\nUSE_SYSTEM_FPM=1 task package\n```\n\n## Debugging\n\n### Frontend logs\n\nYou can use the regular Chrome DevTools to debug the frontend application. You can open the DevTools using the keyboard shortcut `Cmd+Option+I` on macOS or `Ctrl+Option+I` on Linux and Windows. Logs will be sent to the Console tab in DevTools.\n\n### Backend logs\n\nBackend logs for the development version of Wave can be found at `~/.waveterm-dev/waveapp.log`. Both the NodeJS backend from Electron and the main Go backend will log here.\n"

This section is a work-in-progress as our codebase is constantly changing.\n\n### Frontend\n\nOur frontend can be found in the [`/frontend`](./frontend/) directory. It is written in React Typescript. The main entrypoint is [`wave.ts`](./frontend/wave.ts) and the root for the React VDOM is [`app.tsx`](./frontend/app/app.tsx). If you are using `task dev` to run your dev instance of the app, the frontend will be loaded using Vite, which allows for Hot Module Reloading. This should work for most styling and simple component changes, but anything that affects the state of the app (the Jotai or layout code, for instance) may put the frontend into a bad state. If this happens, you can force reload the frontend using `Cmd:Shift:R` or `Ctrl:Shift:R`.\n\nWe also have a Storybook project configured for testing our component library. We're still working to fill out the test cases for this, but it is useful for testing components in isolation. You can run this using `task storybook`.\n\n### emain\n\nemain can be found at [`/emain`](./emain/). It is the main NodeJS process and is first thing that is run when you start up the app and it forks off the process for the wavesrv backend and manages all the Electron interfaces, such as window and view management, context menus, and native UI calls. Its main entrypoint is [`emain.ts`](./emain/emain.ts). This process does not hot-reload, you will need to manually kill the dev instance and rerun it to apply changes.\n\nThe frontend and emain communicate using the [Electron IPC mechanism](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/ipc). All exposed functions between the two are defined twice, once in [`preload.ts`](./emain/preload.ts) and once in [`custom.d.ts`](./frontend/types/custom.d.ts). On the frontend, you call the exposed function by calling `getApi().<function>()`.\n\n### wavesrv\n\nwavesrv can be found at [`/cmd/server`](./cmd/server), with most business logic located in [`/pkg`](./pkg/). It is the primary Go backend for our app and manages the database and all communications with remote hosts. Its main entrypoint is [`main-server.go`](./cmd/server/main-server.go). This process does not hot-reload, you will need to manually kill the dev instance and rerun it to apply changes.\n\nCommunication between the wavesrv and the frontend and emain is handled by both HTTP services (found at [`/pkg/service`](./pkg/service/)) and wshrpc via WebSocket (found at [`/pkg/wshrpc`](./pkg/wshrpc/)).\n\n### wsh\n\nwsh can be found at [`/cmd/wsh`](./cmd/wsh/). It serves two purposes: it functions as a CLI tool for controlling Wave from the command line and it functions as a server on remote machines to facilitate multiplexing terminal sessions over a single connection and streaming files between the remote host and the local host. This process does not hot-reload, you will need to manually kill the dev instance and rerun it to apply changes.\n\nCommunication between wavesrv and wsh is handled by wshrpc via either forwarded domain socket or WebSocket, depending on what the remote host supports.\n"

On the `wave8` branch, run `task version -- <none, patch, minor, major> <false, true>` based on the options mentioned in step 2 of the [Step-by-step guide](#step-by-step-guide).\n2. Commit and push the changes to the `wave8` branch.\n3. Manually create a tag named `v<version>` attached to `origin/wave8`. Push the tag to GitHub.\n4. This should kick off the build as normal and create a draft release when done. Continue from step 4 of the [Step-by-step guide](#step-by-step-guide).\n\n## Step-by-step guide\n\n1. Go to the [Actions tab](https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm/actions) and select \"Bump Version\" from the left sidebar.\n2. Click on \"Run workflow\".\n   - You will see two options:\n     - \"SemVer Bump\": This defaults to `none`. Adjust this if you want to increment the version number according to semantic versioning rules (`patch`, `minor`, `major`).\n     - \"Is Prerelease\": This defaults to `true`. If set to `true`, a `-beta.X` version will be appended to the end of the version. If one is already present and the base SemVer is not being incremented, the `-beta` version will be incremented (i.e. `0.1.13-beta.0` to `0.1.13-beta.1`). If set to `false`, the `-beta.X` suffix will be removed from the version number. If one was not already present, it will remain absent.\n   - Some examples:\n     - If you are creating a new prerelease following an official release, you would set \"SemVer Bump\" to to the expected version bump (`patch`, `minor`, or `major`) and \"Is Prerelease\" to `true`.\n     - If you are bumping an existing prerelease to a new prerelease under the same version, you would set \"SemVer Bump\" to `none` and \"Is Prerelease\" to `true`.\n     - If you are promoting a prerelease version to an official release, you would set \"SemVer Bump\" to `none` and \"Is Prerelease\" to `false`.\n3. After \"Bump Version\" a \"Build Helper\" run will kick off automatically for the new version. When this completes, it will generate a draft GitHub Release with all the built artifacts.\n4. Review the artifacts in the release and test them locally.\n5. When you are confident that the build is good, edit the GitHub Release to add a changelog and release summary and publish the release.\n6. The new version will be published to our release feed automatically when the GitHub Release is published. If the build is a prerelease, it will only release to users subscribed to the `beta` channel. If it is a general release, it will be released to all users.\n\n## Details\n\n### Bump Version workflow\n\nAll releases start by first bumping the package version and creating a new Git tag. We have a workflow set up to automate this.\n\nTo run it, trigger a new run of the [Bump Version workflow](https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm/actions/workflows/bump-version.yml). When triggering the run, you will be prompted to select a version bump type, either `none`, `patch`, `minor`, or `major`, and whether the version is prerelease or not. This determines how much the version number is incremented.\n\nSee [`version.cjs`](../../version.cjs) for more details on how this works.\n\nOnce the tag has been created, a new [Build Helper](#build-helper-workflow) run will be automatically queued to generate the artifacts.\n\n### Build Helper workflow\n\nOur release builds are managed by the [Build Helper workflow](https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm/actions/workflows/build-helper.yml).\n\nUnder the hood, this will call the `package` task in [`Taskfile.yml`](../../Taskfile.yml), which will build the `wavesrv` and `wsh` binaries, then the frontend and Electron codebases using Vite, then it will call `electron-builder` to generate the distributable app packages. The configuration for `electron-builder` is defined in [`electron-builder.config.cjs`](../../electron-builder.config.cjs).\n\nThis will also sign and notarize the macOS app packages and sign the Windows packages.\n\nOnce a build is complete, it will be placed in `s3://waveterm-github-artifacts/staging-w2/<version>`. It can be downloaded for testing using the `artifacts:download:*` task. When you are ready to publish the artifacts to the public release feed, use the `artifacts:publish:*` task to directly copy the artifacts from the staging bucket to the releases bucket.\n\nYou will need to configure an AWS CLI profile with write permissions for the S3 buckets in order for the script to work. You should invoke the tasks as follows:\n\n```bash\ntask artifacts:<download or publish>:<version> -- --profile <aws-profile>\n```\n\n### Automatic updates\n\nThanks to [`electron-updater`](https://www.electron.build/auto-update.html), we are able to provide automatic app updates for macOS, Linux, and Windows, as long as the app was distributed as a DMG, AppImage, RPM, or DEB file (all Windows targets support auto updates).\n\nWith each release, YAML files will be produced that point to the newest release for the current channel. These also include file sizes and checksums to aid in validating the packages. The app will check these files in our S3 bucket every hour to see if a new version is available.\n\n#### Update channels\n\nWe utilize update channels to roll out beta and stable releases. These are determined based on the package versioning [described above](#bump-version-workflow). Users can select their update channel using the `autoupdate:channel` setting in Wave. See [here](https://www.electron.build/tutorials/release-using-channels.html) for more information.\n\n#### Homebrew\n\nHomebrew is automatically bumped when new artifacts are published.\n\n#### Linux\n\nWe do not currently submit the Linux packages to any of the package repositories. We are working on addressing this in the near future.\n\n### `electron-build` configuration\n\nMost of our configuration is fairly standard. The main exception to this is that we exclude our Go binaries from the ASAR archive that Electron generates. ASAR files cannot be executed by NodeJS because they are not seen as files and therefore cannot be executed via a Shell command. More information can be found [here](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/asar-archives#executing-binaries-inside-asar-archive).\n\nWe also exclude most of our `node_modules` from packaging, as Vite handles packaging of any dependencies for us. The one exception is `monaco-editor`.\n"
