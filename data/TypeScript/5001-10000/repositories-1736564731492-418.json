          "content": "# Contributing to Firenvim\n\nThanks a lot for thinking about contributing to Firenvim! Please do not hesitate to ask me questions, either by opening [github issues](https://github.com/glacambre/firenvim/issues), joining the matrix [chat room](https://app.element.io/#/room/#firenvim:matrix.org) or by sending me emails (you can find my email by running `git log` in the git repository).\n\n## Building Firenvim\n\n### Using Docker\n\nInstalling from source using docker requires docker 18.09 or higher for [BuildKit support](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/build_enhancements/). Older Docker versions will build the required files into the image, but will not copy them into the host.\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/glacambre/firenvim\ncd firenvim\nDOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build . -t firenvim --output target\n```\n\n### Without Docker\n\nBuilding without Docker requires NodeJS, npm, and Neovim >= 0.4.\n\nInstall Firenvim like a regular vim plugin (either by changing your runtime path manually or by [using your favourite plugin manager](README.md#installing)).\n\nThen run the following commands:\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/glacambre/firenvim\ncd firenvim\nnpm install\nnpm run build\nnpm run install_manifests\n```\n\nThese commands should create three directories: `target/chrome`, `target/firefox` and `target/xpi`.\n\n## Installing the addon\n\n### Google Chrome/Chromium\n\nGo to `chrome://extensions`, enable \"Developer mode\", click on `Load unpacked` and select the `target/chrome` directory.\n\n### Firefox\n\nThere are multiple ways to install add-ons from files on Firefox. If you just want to use Firenvim, use the regular mode. If you want to test, debug and frequently change Firenvim's source code, use the dev mode.\n\nTo install Firenvim in regular mode, go to `about:addons`, click on the cog icon, select `install addon from file` and select `target/xpi/firenvim-XXX.zip` (note: this might require setting `xpinstall.signatures.required` to false in `about:config`).\n\nTo install Firenvim in dev mode, go to `about:debugging`, click \"Load Temporary Add-On\" and select `target/firefox/manifest.json`.\n\n## Working on Firenvim\n\n`npm run build` is slow and performs lots of checks. In order to iterate faster, you can use `\"$(npm bin)/webpack --env=firefox\"` or `\"$(npm bin)/webpack\" --env=chrome` to build only for the target you care about. Make sure you click the \"reload\" button in your browser every time you reload Firenvim.\n\nFirenvim's architecture is briefly described in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). Firenvim is a webextension (it is a good idea to keep the [webextension documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions) at hand if you're not familiar with webextension development). Webextensions are split in multiple processes. These processes communicate by sending messages to each other and have different entry points. Firenvim's entry points are:\n\n- src/background.ts: Entry point of the background process.\n- src/content.ts: Entry point of the content process (firefox & chrome only).\n- src/frame.ts: Entry point of the Neovim Frame process.\n- src/browserAction.ts: Entry point of the browser action process.\n\n### Background process\n\nThe background process is started on browser startup and takes care of several tasks:\n\n- Starting the Neovim server and loading the settings from your init.vim.\n- Handling browser shortcuts such as `<C-w>`, `<C-n>` or `<C-t>` that cannot be overridden by the Neovim Frame process.\n- Logging errors and sending them to the browserAction. \n- Forwarding messages from the Neovim Frame process to the content process and vice versa.\n\n### Content\n\nA Content process is created for each new tab. The tasks it performs are:\n\n- Creating event listeners to detect when the user tries to interact with a \"writable\" element to then spawn a Neovim Frame process.\n- Retrieving the content of said element and sending it to the Neovim Frame process.\n- Detecting when the \"writable\" element disappears or is resized, to hide or resize the Neovim Frame.\n- Writing the content of the Neovim Frame back to the \"writable\" element.\n\nReading and writing the content of \"writable\" elements requires interacting with different kinds of editors (CodeMirror, Ace, Monaco, Textareas, contenteditable...). This is handled by the [editor-adapter](https://github.com/glacambre/editor-adapter) library I created.\n\n### Neovim Frame process\n\nNeovim Frame process are created for each \"writable\" element the user wants to interact with. The role of the Neovim Frame process is to connect to the Neovim server started by the background process. This is done with a websocket. Once the connection has been made, the Neovim Frame process forwards keypresses to the Neovim server and displays the resulting screen updates. Handling keypresses is performed in `src/input.ts` by relying on the KeyHandler instantiated in `src/frame.ts`. Updating the screen is performed by `src/renderer.ts`.\nThe Neovim Frame process creates a `BufWrite` autocommand to detect when the buffer is written to the disk. When this happens, it sends a request to the Content process and asks it to update the content of the \"writable\" element.\n\n### Browser Action process\n\nThe browser action process corresponds to the small Firenvim button next to the URL bar. It is created every time the user clicks on the button. It displays errors, warnings and lets the background script know when users click on the button to reload their configuration or to disable firenvim in the current tab.\n\n## Testing your changes\n\nThe CI tests changes automatically, so running tests on your machine is not required. If you do want to test Firenvim on your machine, you will need to install either Geckodriver (firefox) or Chromedriver (Chrome & Chromium). Once that is done, run `npm run test-firefox` or `npm run test-chrome`. This will build the add-on in testing mode, load it in a browser and run a few tests to make sure nothing is particularly broken.\n\nWriting new tests is currently rather complicated, so feel free to let me handle that if you don't want to deal with it.\n"

          "content": "### GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\nVersion 3, 29 June 2007\n\nCopyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n<https://fsf.org/>\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this\nlicense document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n### Preamble\n\nThe GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works.\n\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom\nto share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains\nfree software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use\nthe GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies\nalso to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply\nit to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you\nhave certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the\nsoftware, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom\nof others.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\nFor the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the\nmanufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the\naim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The\nsystematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for\nindividuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.\nTherefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the\npractice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in\nother domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those\ndomains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the\nfreedom of users.\n\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish\nto avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program\ncould make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL\nassures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n### TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n#### 0. Definitions.\n\n\"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n\"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds\nof works, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n\"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\nTo \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of\nan exact copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of\nthe earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\nA \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\nTo \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\nTo \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user\nthrough a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not\nconveying.\n\nAn interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\" to\nthe extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n#### 1. Source Code.\n\nThe \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it. \"Object code\" means any non-source form of\na work.\n\nA \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\nThe \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form. A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\nThe \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities. However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can\nregenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same\nwork.\n\n#### 2. Basic Permissions.\n\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,\nwithout conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.\nYou may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having\nthem make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with\nfacilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the\nterms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not\ncontrol copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for\nyou must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and\ncontrol, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your\ncopyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the\nconditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes\nit unnecessary.\n\n#### 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such\ncircumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with\nrespect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit\noperation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against\nthe work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures.\n\n#### 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n#### 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these\nconditions:\n\n-   a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n-   b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under\n    section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4\n    to \"keep intact all notices\".\n-   c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n-   d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n#### 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of\nsections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable\nCorresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these\nways:\n\n-   a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n-   b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding\n    Source from a network server at no charge.\n-   c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n-   d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n-   e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,\n    provided you inform other peers where the object code and\n    Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general\n    public at no charge under subsection 6d.\n\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\nA \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal,\nfamily, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for\nincorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a\nconsumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of\ncoverage. For a particular product received by a particular user,\n\"normally used\" refers to a typical or common use of that class of\nproduct, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way\nin which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected\nto use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of\nwhether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or\nnon-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant\nmode of use of the product.\n\n\"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to\ninstall and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User\nProduct from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The\ninformation must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of\nthe modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with\nsolely because modification has been made.\n\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or\nupdates for a work that has been modified or installed by the\nrecipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or\ninstalled. Access to a network may be denied when the modification\nitself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network\nor violates the rules and protocols for communication across the\nnetwork.\n\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n#### 7. Additional Terms.\n\n\"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders\nof that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n-   a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n-   b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n-   c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,\n    or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n-   d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors\n    or authors of the material; or\n-   e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n-   f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions\n    of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient,\n    for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly\n    impose on those licensors and authors.\n\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the\nabove requirements apply either way.\n\n#### 8. Termination.\n\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license\nfrom a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,\nunless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally\nterminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder\nfails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to\n60 days after the cessation.\n\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n#### 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run\na copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n#### 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\nAn \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n#### 11. Patents.\n\nA \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\nA contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims owned\nor controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version. For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\nIn the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement). To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients. \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\nA patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within the\nscope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on\nthe non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically\ngranted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you\nare a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the\nbusiness of distributing software, under which you make payment to the\nthird party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the\nwork, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties\nwho would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent\nlicense (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by\nyou (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in\nconnection with specific products or compilations that contain the\ncovered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent\nlicense was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n#### 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under\nthis License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a\nconsequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to\nterms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying\nfrom those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could\nsatisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely\nfrom conveying the Program.\n\n#### 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n#### 14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions\nwill be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in\ndetail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program\nspecifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public\nLicense \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of\nfollowing the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or\nof any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the\nProgram does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public\nLicense, you may choose any version ever published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.\n\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions\nof the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public\nstatement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to\nchoose that version for the Program.\n\nLater license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n#### 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT\nWARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT\nLIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\nA PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND\nPERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE\nDEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR\nCORRECTION.\n\n#### 16. Limitation of Liability.\n\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR\nCONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES\nARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT\nNOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR\nLOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM\nTO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER\nPARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n#### 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n### How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these\nterms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to\nattach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state\nthe exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n        <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n        Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n        This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n        the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n        (at your option) any later version.\n\n        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n        but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n        GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n        You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n        along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper\nmail.\n\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n        <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n        This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n        This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n        under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands \\`show w' and \\`show c' should show the\nappropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your\nprogram's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would\nuse an \"about box\".\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow\nthe GNU GPL, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your\nprogram into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine\nlibrary, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary\napplications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the\nGNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first,\nplease read <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"

Other Chromium based browsers such as Brave, Vivaldi, Opera, and Arc should also work but are not specifically tested.</sub>\n\n![Firenvim demo](firenvim.gif)\n\n## How to use\n\nJust click on any textarea and it will be immediately replaced by an instance of Firenvim. To set the content of the now hidden textarea to the content of the Neovim instance, simply `:w`. If you want to close the Firenvim overlay and return to the textarea, use `:q`. If you selected an element where you expected the Firenvim frame to appear and it didn't, try pressing `<C-e>`.\n\n## Installing\n\nBefore installing anything please read [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) and make sure you're okay with everything mentioned. In the event you think of a way to compromise Firenvim, please send me an email (you can find my address on my website).\n\n1. Install Firenvim as a regular NeoVim plugin, then run the built-in post-install script.\n\n    * [lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)\n\n        ```lua\n        { 'glacambre/firenvim', build = \":call firenvim#install(0)\" }\n\n    * [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)\n\n        ```vim\n        Plug 'glacambre/firenvim', { 'do': { _ -> firenvim#install(0) } }\n        ```\n\n    * [minpac](https://github.com/k-takata/minpac)\n\n        ```vim\n        call minpac#add('glacambre/firenvim', { 'type': 'opt', 'do': 'packadd firenvim | call firenvim#install(0)'})\n        if exists('g:started_by_firenvim')\n          packadd firenvim\n        endif\n        ```\n\n    * [vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim), others\n\n        Install the plugin as you usually would, then run this shell command:\n\n        ```sh\n        $ nvim --headless \"+call firenvim#install(0) | q\"\n        ```\n\n2. Install the Firenvim addon for your browser from [Mozilla's store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firenvim/) or [Google's](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/firenvim/egpjdkipkomnmjhjmdamaniclmdlobbo).\n\nIf you would rather build and install Firenvim from source, check [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n#### Other browsers\n\nOther browsers aren't supported for now. Opera, Vivaldi and other Chromium-based browsers should however work just like in Chromium and have similar install steps. Brave, Edge, and Arc might work, Safari doesn't (it doesn't support Webextensions).\n\n## Permissions\n\nFirenvim currently requires the following permissions for the following reasons:\n\n- [Access your data for all websites](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/permission-request-messages-firefox-extensions?as=u&utm_source=inproduct#w_access-your-data-for-all-websites): this is necessary in order to be able to append elements (= the neovim iframe) to the DOM.\n- [Exchange messages with programs other than Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/permission-request-messages-firefox-extensions?as=u#w_exchange-messages-with-programs-other-than-firefox): this is necessary in order to be able to start neovim instances.\n\n## Configuring Firenvim\n\n### Manually triggering Firenvim\n\nYou can configure the keybinding to manually trigger Firenvim (`<C-e>` by default) in [the shortcuts menu](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/manage-extension-shortcuts-firefox) in `about:addons` on Firefox, or in `chrome://extensions/shortcuts` on Chrome.\n\n### Temporarily disabling Firenvim in a tab\n\nTemporarily disabling (and re-enabling) Firenvim in a tab can be done either by clicking on the Firenvim button next to the urlbar or by configuring a browser shortcut (see the previous section to find out how browser shortcuts can be configured).\n\n### Building a Firenvim-specific config\n\nNote: If you would prefer VimScript examples, you can consult the (outdated) readme from commit 132979166a02319f0b49815135e60a4e4599de91 or earlier.\n\n**New**: With Neovim nightly builds from 2023/02/17 or more recent, you can use [$NVIM_APPNAME](https://neovim.io/doc/user/starting.html#$NVIM_APPNAME) to define a completely separate firenvim config. In order to do that, make sure \"NVIM_APPNAME\" is appropriately set when you run firenvim#install().\n\nWhen it starts Neovim, Firenvim sets the variable `g:started_by_firenvim` which you can check to run different code in your init.lua. For example:\n\n```lua\nif vim.g.started_by_firenvim == true then\n  vim.o.laststatus = 0\nelse\n  vim.o.laststatus = 2\nend\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can detect when Firenvim connects to Neovim by using the `UIEnter` autocmd event:\n\n```lua\nvim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({'UIEnter'}, {\n    callback = function(event)\n        local client = vim.api.nvim_get_chan_info(vim.v.event.chan).client\n        if client ~= nil and client.name == \"Firenvim\" then\n            vim.o.laststatus = 0\n        end\n    end\n})\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can detect when Firenvim disconnects from a Neovim instance with the `UILeave` autocommand.\n\n### Using different settings depending on the url/page/element being edited\n\nThe nvim buffer loaded into a textarea is given a unique name. All buffers are named something like this: `domainname_page_selector.txt` (see the [toFileName function](src/utils/utils.ts)).\n\nThis alows you to configure different settings by creating autocommands targeting/matching the buffername for that url/page/element. For example, this will set file type to markdown for all GitHub buffers:\n\n```lua\nvim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({'BufEnter'}, {\n    pattern = \"github.com_*.txt\",\n    command = \"set filetype=markdown\"\n})\n```\n\nTo view the buffername of your nvim instance in a textarea, use `:buffers`.\n\n### Understanding Firenvim's configuration object\n\nYou can configure everything else about Firenvim by creating a dictionary named `vim.g.firenvim_config` in your init.lua and setting the keys \"globalSettings\" and \"localSettings\". In the dictionary `vim.g.firenvim_config[\"localSettings\"]` you can map Javascript patterns that match against the full URL to settings that are used for all URLs matched by that pattern. When multiple patterns match a URL, the pattern with the highest \"priority\" value is used. Here is an example (the settings and their possible values will be explained in the next subsections):\n\n```lua\nvim.g.firenvim_config = {\n    globalSettings = { alt = \"all\" },\n    localSettings = {\n        [\".*\"] = {\n            cmdline  = \"neovim\",\n            content  = \"text\",\n            priority = 0,\n            selector = \"textarea\",\n            takeover = \"always\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWith this configuration, `takeover` will be set to `always` on all websites. If we wanted to override this value on british websites, we could add the following lines to our init.vim. Notice how the priority of this new regex is higher than that of the `.*` regex:\n\n```lua\nvim.g.firenvim_config.localSettings[\"https?://[^/]+\\\\.co\\\\.uk/\"] = { takeover = 'never', priority = 1 }\n```\n\n### Configuring what elements Firenvim should appear on\n\nThe `selector` attribute of a localSetting controls what elements Firenvim automatically takes over. Here's the default value:\n\n```lua\nvim.g.firenvim_config.localSettings['.*'] = { selector = 'textarea:not([readonly], [aria-readonly]), div[role=\"textbox\"]' }\n```\n\nIf you don't want to use Firenvim with rich text editors (e.g. Gmail, Outlook, Slack…) as a general rule, you might want to restrict Firenvim to simple textareas:\n\n```lua\nvim.g.firenvim_config.localSettings['.*'] = { selector = 'textarea' }\n```\n\nSince `selector` is just a CSS selector, you have access to all of CSS's pseudo selectors, including [`:not()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:not), which allows you to exclude elements that have certain attributes, like this:\n\n```lua\nvim.g.firenvim_config.localSettings['.*'] = { selector = 'textarea:not([class=xxx])' }\n```\n\n### Configuring Firenvim to not always take over elements\n\nFirenvim has a setting named `takeover` that can be set to `always`, `empty`, `never`, `nonempty` or `once`. When set to `always`, Firenvim will always take over elements for you. When set to `empty`, Firenvim will only take over empty elements. When set to `never`, Firenvim will never automatically appear, thus forcing you to use a keyboard shortcut in order to make the Firenvim frame appear. When set to `nonempty`, Firenvim will only take over elements that aren't empty. When set to `once`, Firenvim will take over elements the first time you select them, which means that after `:q`'ing Firenvim, you'll have to use the keyboard shortcut to make it appear again. Here's how to use the `takeover` setting:\n\n```lua\nvim.g.firenvim_config.localSettings['.*'] = { takeover = 'always' }\n```\n\n### Choosing a command line\n\nYou can chose between neovim's built-in command line, firenvim's command line and no command line at all by setting the localSetting named `cmdline` to either `neovim`, `firenvim` or `none`, e.g.:\n```lua\nvim.g.firenvim_config.localSettings['.*'] = { cmdline = 'firenvim' }\n```\nChoosing `none` does not make sense unless you have alternative way to display the command line such as [noice.nvim](https://github.com/folke/noice.nvim).\n\n### Editing HTML directly\n\nThe `content` localSetting controls how Firenvim should read the content of an element. Setting it to `html` will make Firenvim fetch the content of elements as HTML, `text` will make it use plaintext. The default value is `text`:\n\n```lua\nvim.g.firenvim_config.localSettings['.*'] = { content = 'html' }\n```\n\n### Special characters on MacOS\n\nOn MacOS, the default keyboard layouts emit special characters when the alt (i.e. option) key is held down. From the perspective of the browser, these special characters replace the underlying \"main\" character of a keystroke event while retaining the modifier. For example, in the standard US layout the key chord alt-o is received in the browser as alt-ø rather than alt-o. Further, certain alt-chords represent \"dead keys\", which apply a diacritic to the next character entered. Pressing alt-e followed by a produces the single character \"á\" while alt-u followed by a produces \"ä\". To produce this behavior, diacritic-mapped strokes like alt-e and alt-u are themselves mapped to a [\"Dead key\" character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_key). \n\nThese behaviors complicate the support of special character and alt/meta (A- or M-) vim mappings on MacOS in two ways:\n\n1. There is no way to generate unmodified special character key events. For example, since the only way to generate the character \"ø\" via the keyboard is by holding down alt, any key event with the \"ø\" character will also have an alt modifier. If we forward this directly to Vim, it will be received as `<M-ø>`.\n\n2. There is no way to generate alt-modified plain alphanumeric characters. For example, an `<M-o>` mapping won't work because pressing alt-o generates `<M-ø>` rather than `<M-o>`.\n\nTerminal and standalone GUI applications can solve these problems by changing the interpretation of the alt key at the application level. `Terminal.app` and `iTerm2`, for instance, both provide a \"use Option as Meta key\" preference that converts incoming alt-chords at the application level. Firenvim, however, is a browser extension that operates off of browser keystroke events rather than application-level events. At present, we are unsure how to implement this \"use option as meta\" functionality at the browser event level (help here is welcome!). However, there are some workarounds.\n\nFor problem (1), Firenvim will by default drop the alt key on MacOS for any special character, defined here as non-alphanumeric (not matching `/[a-zA-Z0-9]/`). This means alt-o will be forwarded to NeoVim as \"ø\" rather than \"M-ø\". Note that this behavior can be changed by setting the `alt` setting of the `globalSettings` configuration to `all`, like this:\n\n### Making Firenvim ignore keys\n\nYou can make Firenvim ignore key presses (thus letting the browser handle them) by setting key-value pairs in `globalSettings.ignoreKeys`. The key needs to be the neovim mode the key press should be ignored in and the value should be an array containing the textual representation of the key press you want ignored. If you want to ignore a key press in all modes, you can use `all` as mode key.\n\nFor example, if you want to make Firenvim ignore `<C-1>` and `<C-2>` in normal mode and `<C-->` in all modes to let your browser handle them, you should define ignoreKeys like this:\n\n```lua\nvim.g.firenvim_config = {\n    globalSettings = {\n        ignoreKeys = {\n            all = { '<C-->' },\n            normal = { '<C-1>', '<C-2>' }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nMode names are defined in [Neovim's cursor_shape.c](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/src/nvim/cursor_shape.c). Note that if the key press contains multiple modifiers, Shift needs to be first, Alt second, Control third and OS/Meta last (e.g. `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+1` needs to be `<SAC-1>`). If your keyboard layout requires you to press shift in order to press numbers, shift should be present in the key representation (e.g. on french azerty keyboards, `<C-1>` should actually be `<SC-1>`).\n\n### Interacting with the page\n\nYou can execute javascript in the page by using `firenvim#eval_js`. The code has to be a valid javascript expression (NOT a statement). You can provide the name of a function that should be executed with the result of the expression. Note that some pages prevent evaluating JavaScript with their [CSP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) and this can't be worked around. Here's an example:\n\n```lua\nvim.fn['firenvim#eval_js']('alert(\"Hello World!\")', 'MyFunction')\n```\n\nYou can move focus from the editor back to the page or the input field by calling `firenvim#focus_page` or `firenvim#focus_input`. Here's an example that does exactly this if you press `<Esc>` twice while in normal mode:\n\n```lua\nvim.api.nvim_set_keymap(\"n\", \"<Esc><Esc>\", \"<Cmd>call firenvim#focus_page()<CR>\", {})\n```\n\nThere is also a function named `firenvim#hide_frame()` which will temporarily hide the Firenvim frame. You will then be able to bring the neovim frame back either by unfocusing and refocusing the textarea or by using the [keybinding to manually trigger Firenvim](https://github.com/glacambre/firenvim#manually-triggering-firenvim).\n\n```lua\nvim.api.nvim_set_keymap(\"n\", \"<C-z>\", \"<Cmd>call firenvim#hide_frame()<CR>\", {})\n```\n\nA function named `firenvim#press_keys()` will allow you to send key events to the underlying input field by taking a list of vim-like keys (e.g. `a`, `<CR>`, `<Space>`…) as argument. Note that this only \"triggers\" an event, it does not add text to the input field. For example if you'd like firenvim to send `<CR>` to the webpage when you press `<CR>` in the editor, you can use the following mapping which is useful with chat apps:\n\n```lua\nvim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({'BufEnter', {\n    pattern = \"riot.im_*\",\n    command = [[inoremap <CR> <Esc>:w<CR>:call firenvim#press_keys(\"<LT>CR>\")<CR>ggdGa]],\n})\n```\n\nNote that our goal is to make the mapping type `firenvim#press_keys(\"<CR>\")` in vim's command prompt and then execute it. Since we want the keys `<CR>` to be typed and not <kbd>Enter</kbd> to be pressed, we can't use `<CR>` because it would be interpreted by `inoremap`. Hence we use `<LT>CR>` in order to type the keys `<CR>`. Similarly, if you want to type the keys `<C-CR>` you'd use `<LT>C-CR>`.\n\nKnown Issues: some websites do not react to `firenvim#press_keys` (e.g. Slack).\n\n### Automatically syncing changes to the page\n\nSince Firenvim simply uses the BufWrite event in order to detect when it needs to write neovim's buffers to the page, Firenvim can be made to automatically synchronize all changes like this:\n\n```lua\nvim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({'TextChanged', 'TextChangedI'}, {\n    nested = true,\n    command = \"write\"\n})\n```\n\nDepending on how large the edited buffer is, this could be a little slow. This more sophisticated approach will throttle writes:\n\n```lua\nvim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({'TextChanged', 'TextChangedI'}, {\n    callback = function(e)\n        if vim.g.timer_started == true then\n            return\n        end\n        vim.g.timer_started = true\n        vim.fn.timer_start(10000, function()\n            vim.g.timer_started = false\n            vim.cmd('silent write')\n        end)\n    end\n})\n```\n\n### Configuring message timeout\n\nDue to space constraints, the external command line covers part of the buffer. This can be a problem as sometimes neovim will send a message that tells Firenvim to draw the command line, and then never send the message to tell Firenvim to stop displaying it. In order to work around this problem, a \"cmdlineTimeout\" configuration option has been implemented, which makes Firenvim hide the external command line after the cursor has moved and some amount of milliseconds have passed:\n\n```lua\nvim.g.firenvim_config = {\n    globalSettings = {\n        cmdlineTimeout = 3000\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Configuring the filename\n\nIt is possible to configure the name of the file used by Firenvim with the `filename` localSetting. This setting is a format string where each element in curly braces will be replaced with a value and where the maximum length can be specified with a percentage. Possible format elements are `hostname` (= the domain name of the website), `pathname` (= the path of the page), `selector` (= the CSS selector of the text area), `timestamp` (= the current date) and `extension` (the language extension when using Firenvim on a code editor or `txt` otherwise). For example:\n\n```lua\nvim.g.firenvim_config = {\n    localSettings = {\n        ['.*'] = {\n            filename = '/tmp/{hostname}_{pathname%10}.{extension}'\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWill result in Firenvim using `/tmp/github.com_issues-new.txt` on Github's new issue page. The default value of this setting is `{hostname%32}_{pathname%32}_{selector%32}_{timestamp%32}.{extension}`.\n\n## Drawbacks\n\nSome keybindings, such as `<C-n>`, `<C-t>` and `<C-w>` are not overridable through usual means. This means that you have to tell your browser to let Firenvim override them by using [the shortcuts menu in `about://addons`](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/manage-extension-shortcuts-firefox) on Firefox and `chrome://extensions/shortcuts` in Chrome.\n\nWhen it is possible to do so, if you press one of these keyboard shortcuts while not in a Firenvim frame, Firenvim will attempt to emulate the expected behavior of the shortcut. For example, pressing `<C-w>` in a Firenvim frame will tell neovim you pressed `<C-w>`, but outside of it it will tell the browser to close the current tab.\n\nControlling whether Firenvim should attempt to emulate the browser's default behavior can be done with global settings. The following snippet will tell Firenvim to simulate `<C-n>`'s default behavior while never simulating `<C-w>`'s:\n\n```lua\nvim.g.firenvim_config = {\n    globalSettings = {\n      ['<C-w>'] = 'noop',\n      ['<C-n>'] = 'default'\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNote that on Firefox on Linux some keyboard shortcuts might not be overridable. I circumvent this issue by running a [patched](https://github.com/glacambre/firefox-patches) version of Firefox (note: once Firefox is patched, you won't need to setup webextension keyboard shortcuts).\n\n## You might also like\n\n- [Tridactyl](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl), provides vim-like keybindings to use Firefox.

          "content": "# Firenvim Architecture and Security mitigations\n\n## Architecture\n\nWebextensions are made of [several kinds of processes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Anatomy_of_a_WebExtension) (also named \"scripts\"). Firenvim uses three kinds of scripts:\n- The [background script](src/background.ts).\n- The [content script](src/content.ts).\n- The [\"frame\" script](src/frame.ts).\n\nThese scripts have different permissions. For example, the background script can start new processes on your computer but cannot access the content of your tabs. The content script has the opposite permissions. The frame script is just a kind of content script that executes in a frame.\n\nWhen you launch your browser (or install Firenvim), the background script starts a new NeoVim process and writes a randomly-generated 256-bit password to its stdin. The NeoVim process binds itself to a random TCP port and sends the port number to the background script by writing to stdout.\n\nWhen you open a new tab, the content script adds event listeners to text areas. When you focus one of the text areas the content script is listening to, it creates a new frame and places it on top of the text area.\n\nWhen it is created, the frame script asks the background script for the port and password of the NeoVim process it started earlier by using a webextension-only API. The frame script then creates a plaintext (as opposed to TLS) [WebSocket](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API/Writing_WebSocket_client_applications) and sends the password as part of the websocket handshake.\n\nWhen the NeoVim process notices a new connection, it makes sure that:\n- The password is in the handshake.\n- The handshake really is a websocket handshake.\n\nIf any of these conditions isn't met, the NeoVim process closes its socket and port and then shuts itself down.\n\nAfter a successful websocket handshake, the frame script and neovim process communicate with neovim's msgpack-rpc protocol.\n\n## Threats\n\n### Malicious page\n\nA malicious page could create an infinite amount of textareas and focus them all; this could result in PID and/or port and/or memory exhaustion. You can [sandbox firenvim](https://github.com/glacambre/firenvim/issues/238) to protect yourself from that. Finer-grained controls will be implemented some day.\n\nA malicious page could try to connect to the NeoVim process started by the background script with its own-websocket. However, it would have to guess the port and password the NeoVim process was started with in order to be able to send commands to NeoVim.\n\nA malicious page could try to send key events to the neovim frame. However, only the script inside the frame listens for key events and a page can't send key events to a child frame (and even then, the frame script makes sure that [events are trusted](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/isTrusted)).\n\nA malicious page could try to send malicious messages to the frame with the [postMessage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Client/postMessage) api but the frame script doesn't listen for these.\n\n### Malicious extensions\n\nA malicious extension can do everything a page can (and these attacks are mitigated in the same way). There's two more attack vectors to consider:\n\nA malicious extension cannot start neovim unless its id matches Firenvim's. I have no idea what Mozilla does in order to prevent an extension from stealing another extension's id. I assume they check extension ids when publishing extensions on addons.mozilla.org. However, if this is the only protection in place, this would mean that you're not safe from this kind of attack if you install your extensions from somewhere else.\n\nAnother attack a malicious extension could attempt is to use the webrequest extension API in order to intercept Firenvim's websocket connection request, inspect its content, cancel it and then connect to Neovim while pretending it is Firenvim. However, this cannot work as the webrequest extension API does not offer the ability to intercept requests from other extensions.\n\n### Malicious actors on LAN\n\nThe neovim process binds itself to 127.0.0.1, so malicious actors on your LAN should be unable to interact with either your webextension or your neovim process.\n\n### Malicious software on your computer\n\nMalicious software on your computer could try to connect to the neovim process but they would have to find out what port and password. This information lives either in firefox or neovim's RAM. If you're running malicious software that can read your RAM, you probably have bigger problems than a webextension that lets you use neovim from your browser.\n\n## Sandboxing Firenvim\n\nIf you want to sandbox Firenvim, you can do so with apparmor. [This github issue](https://github.com/glacambre/firenvim/issues/238) has a bit more information about that.\n"

          "content": "# Troubleshooting Firenvim\n\nIf you're having issues with Firenvim, here are the steps you can take in order to check if everything is correctly set up on your side.\n\n## Make sure Flatpak and Snap are not preventing Firenvim from working\n\nIf your browser is installed through Snap or Flatpak, sandboxing mechanisms might be preventing the browser from starting Neovim. You can confirm this by running:\n\n```\nflatpak permissions webextensions\n```\n\nIf the output of this command shows that Snap/Flatpak are preventing Firenvim from running, you need to run `flatpak permission-set webextensions firenvim snap.firefox yes` to change that.\n\n## Make sure the neovim plugin is installed\n\nRun neovim without any arguments and then try to run the following line:\n```\ncall firenvim#install(0)\n```\n\n- If this results in `Installed native matifest for ${browser}` being printed, the firenvim plugin is correctly installed in neovim and you can move on to the next troubleshooting step.\n\n- If this results in `No config detected for ${browser}` and `${browser}` is the browser you want to use firenvim with, this might be because your browser configuration files are in a non-standard directory. If this is the case, you will need to either create a symbolic link from your browser configuration directory to the expected one ([firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_manifests#Manifest_location), [chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/nativeMessaging#native-messaging-host-location)), or force-install Firenvim with `call firenvim#install(1)` and copy the contents of the default browser configuration directory ([firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_manifests#Manifest_location), [chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/nativeMessaging#native-messaging-host-location)) to your custom one.\n\n- If this results in `Unknown function: firenvim#install` being printed, then firenvim is not correctly installed in neovim and this is likely a configuration error from your side. Check your configuration again.\n\n- If this results in `nvim version >= 0.4.0 required. Aborting`, you know what to do :).\n\n## Make sure the firenvim script has been created\n\nRunning `call firenvim#install(0)` should have created a shell or batch script in `$XDG_DATA_HOME/firenvim` (on linux/osx, this usually is `$HOME/.local/share/firenvim`, on windows it's `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\firenvim`). Make sure that the script exists and that it is executable. Try running it in a shell, like this:\n```sh\necho 'abcde{}' | ${XDG_DATA_HOME:-${HOME}/.local/share}/firenvim/firenvim\n```\nThis should print a json object the content of which is the current version of the firenvim neovim plugin. If it doesn't, please open a new github issue.\n\n## Make sure the firenvim native manifest has been created\n\nRunning `call firenvim#install(0)` should also have created a file named `firenvim.json` in your browser's configuration directory. Make sure it exists:\n\n- On Linux:\n    * For Firefox: `$HOME/.mozilla/native-messaging-hosts`\n    * For Chrome: `$HOME/.config/google-chrome/NativeMessagingHosts/`\n    * For Chromium: `$HOME/.config/chromium/NativeMessagingHosts/`\n- On OSX:\n    * For Firefox: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Mozilla/NativeMessagingHosts`\n    * For Chrome: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/NativeMessagingHosts`\n    * For Chromium: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Chromium/NativeMessagingHosts`\n- On Windows: in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\firenvim` and check that the following registry keys exist and point to the native manifest:\n    * For Firefox: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Mozilla\\NativeMessagingHosts\\firenvim`\n    * For Chrome/Chromium: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Google\\Chrome\\NativeMessagingHosts\\firenvim`\n\nAlso check the content of this json file to make sure that the `path` key points to the firenvim script you checked the existence of in the previous step. If the json file is missing or if the `path` attribute is wrong, please open a new github issue.\n\n## Make sure the browser extension can communicate with neovim\n\nIn your browser, open the background console. This requires the following steps:\n\n- On Firefox:\n    * Go to `about:debugging`\n    * Select `This Firefox` in the left column.\n    * Find firenvim.\n    * Click on the `inspect` button.\n    * If the console already contains messages, empty it by clicking on the trash icon.\n- On Chrome/ium:\n    * Go to `chrome://extensions`\n    * Enable Developer mode (the button is in the top right corner)\n    * Find firenvim.\n    * Click on the `background page` link.\n    * If the console already contains messages, empty by pressing `<C-l>`.\n\nThen, navigate to a page with a textarea. Open the content console (`<CS-I>` on both firefox and chrome/ium). If you're using firefox, also open and clear the Browser Console (`<CS-J>`). Then, click on the textarea. This should result in messages being printed in the console. If it doesn't, try clicking on the Firenvim icon next to the urlbar. If no messages are logged there either, try clicking on the `Reload settings` button.\n\n### Make sure firenvim can access your config files\n\nIf your configs are not in `$HOME/.config/nvim` and the last step works with `-u NORC`, it could be that firenvim cannot access your config files. Try sourcing them (`:source [path to file]`) from inside firenvim. If this fails, move the configs into `$HOME/.config/nvim` and try sourcing them again.\n\n## Make sure firenvim's $PATH is the same as neovim's\n\nSome operating systems (such as OSX) empty your browser's `$PATH`. This could be a problem if you want to use plugins that depend on other executables. In order to check if this is indeed happening, just run `echo $PATH` in your shell and `:!echo $PATH` in firenvim and compare the results. If they're different, this might be the culprit.\n\nIn order to fix this, call firenvim#install() and give it a prologue that sets the right path for you, like this:\n```sh\nnvim --headless -c \"call firenvim#install(0, 'export PATH=\\\"$PATH\\\"')\" -c quit\n```\n\nNote that this sets your `$PATH` in stone and that in order to update it you'll need to run the above command again. If you want to avoid doing that, you could also try the method described [here](https://github.com/glacambre/firenvim/issues/122#issuecomment-536348171).\n\n## Print-debugging your init.vim\n\nYou can't use `echo` or `echom` in your init.vim before Firenvim has been loaded and initialized. If you need to debug your init.vim, you could try one of these two apparoaches:\n- Append the messages you would normally `echom` to a list which you will only display after the `UiEnter` autocommand has been triggered.\n- Use `echoerr` instead and redirect Neovim's stderr to a file on your disk in the [firenvim script](#make-sure-the-firenvim-script-has-been-created) by appending `2>>/tmp/stderr | tee -a /tmp/stdout` at the end of the `exec` line.\n"
