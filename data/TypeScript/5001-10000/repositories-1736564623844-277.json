Here you will learn all about the css-blocks framework design, internals, and related build tooling.\n\nI heavily recommend you review the [CSS Blocks Project README][README] for a full overview of the css-blocks project and its public APIs! This document expects you have a good handle on Block syntax and Block composition concepts.\n\nI'll give you a chance to review...\n\nOh, you're back? Good! Glad you're a css-blocks master now –  welcome to the community! 🎉 Now, lets dive in to the really fun stuff.\n\n* [CSS Blocks Architecture](#css-blocks-architecture)\n* [Build Phases](#build-phases)\n  * [Block Parsing](#block-parsing)\n  * [Template Analysis](#template-analysis)\n  * [Block Compilation](#block-compilation)\n  * [Optimization (Production Only)](#optimization-production-only)\n  * [Rewrite Phase](#rewrite-phase)\n* [Project Structure](#project-structure)\n  * [Core Packages](#core-packages)\n    * [@css-blocks/core](#css-blockscore)\n    * [@css-blocks/runtime](#css-blocksruntime)\n    * [@css-blocks/code-style](#css-blockscode-style)\n  * [Template Integrations](#template-integrations)\n    * [@css-blocks/glimmer](#css-blocksglimmer)\n    * [@css-blocks/jsx](#css-blocksjsx)\n  * [Build System Integrations](#build-system-integrations)\n      * [@css-blocks/broccoli](#css-blocksbroccoli)\n      * [@css-blocks/webpack](#css-blockswebpack)\n      * [@css-blocks/ember-cli](#css-blocksember-cli)\n\n# Build Phases\n\nLets kick this off with a high-level overview of what happens when you run a css-blocks build. We'll dive deeper into the project structure and organization a little later, but there's a **lot** going on here, and what's the point of reading about APIs if you don't know what we're trying to accomplish?\n\nAfter all, as Uncle Ben once said – \"With great power, comes great...computational complexity\" (Sorry, its been a while since I've seen Spider Man).\n\nTo pull off all the features promised by css-blocks, we need to do a *lot* of work. Over the course of a single build, css-blocks will bring your application through five (5) distinct phases:\n\n1. Block Parsing\n2. Template Analysis\n3. Block Compilation\n4. Optimization (Production Only)\n5. Template Rewrite\n\n## Block Parsing\nLets start at the very beginning – a very good place to start! In css-blocks, we start with your templates – unexpected for a CSS framework, I know!\n\nCSS Blocks starts at the entry point template(s) passed to it by your build, and crawls the template dependency trees. Every time we encounter a referenced Block file in a template (remember: the syntax for this changes depending on the templating language), we pass it off to the [BlockFactory](./packages/@css-blocks/core/src/BlockParser/BlockFactory.ts) for parsing.\n\nThe `BlockFactory` parses every Block file discovered into an internally used, intermediate data model that is well indexed, easily searchable, and manages all the complexity of Block composition, inheritance and implementation. This data model is affectionately called a [BlockTree](./packages/@css-blocks/core/src/BlockTree/index.ts).\n\nThe `BlockFactory` also ensures we only ever have a single instance of each unique Block file's data model at any time, and encapsulates all the logic around Block reference resolution, CSS parsing and preprocessor integration.\n\nIn this phase we validate Block syntax and will stop the build with a helpful error if we notice anything wrong in a Block file! These include errors for:\n\n - Invalid Selectors or Identifiers\n - Missing API Implementations\n - Illegal use of `!important`\n - Malformed Block paths or block-references\n - And more!\n\nAt the end of a successful __Block Parsing Phase__, we are left with a collection of `Block` objects that my be used to query any and all relevant information about a Block file. Any valid `Block` may contain one to many `Style` objects that represent individual `BlockClass`es, or `AttrValue`s accessible on the `Block`. These in turn map directly back to one or more declared rulesets in the source Block file.\n\nYou can read more about `Block` objects and their associated APIs in the [CSS Blocks Core README](./packages/%40css-blocks/core).\n\n## Template Analysis\nOnce we're finished constructing our `Block` objects, these data are passed off to a template `Analyzer` for the __Template Analysis Phase__. It is the job of the analyzer to inspect every element, in every template of the application, and report back information, like:\n\n  - which styles are used;\n  - which styles are dynamic;\n  - which styles are mutually exclusive;\n\nand any other pertinent usage information that we can glean from the templates.\n\nThe syntax for consuming Blocks in any given template language may change, but we require that each language's implementation be *statically analyzable*. This means that by parsing the template we are able to tell with certainty when and how Styles are being used. The more uncertainty in a template's implementation, the less stylesheet optimization we can do in the next build phase.\n\nThe `Analyzer` is has access to:\n\n 1. all parsed `Block` objects;\n 2. all template entry points.\n\nThe `Analyzer` will crawl the template dependency tree and create a new `Analysis` object for each template discovered. These `Analysis` objects contain style usage information for every element the template contains.\n\nIn this phase we validate style composition and will stop the build with a helpful error if we notice anything wrong, including but not limited to:\n\n - Invalid application of `Style`s, like:\n\t - an `AttrValue` used without parent `BlockClass`,\n\t - two classes from the same block applied to the same element,\n\t - a `:scope` and `BlockClass` applied on the same element;\n - Un-resolved property conflicts on correlated `Style`s from different Blocks;\n - Duplicate application of exclusive `AttrValue`s.\n\nYou can read more about `Analyzer`s and their associated APIs in the [Analyzer README](./packages/%40css-blocks/core/src/Analyzer).\n\n## Block Compilation\nNow that we have our parsed `Block` objects, and the fully populated `Analysis` data, we can emit a compiled CSS file for each `Block`.\n\nThe [`BlockCompiler`](./packages/%40css-blocks/core/src/BlockCompiler) is responsible for taking in a `Block` object, and emitting a transformed PostCSS root node with the rewritten classes.\n\nAt this phase, your Block files are rewritten to use globally unique class names, and all extension and conflict resolution selectors are emitted.\n\nAs described in the [CSS Blocks README][CORE], `Style` objects (`BlockClasses` and `AttrValues`) conveniently map directly to BEM classes. By default, you will see BEM classes emitted in this phase.\n\n> Note: BEM is the default output mode for css-blocks – and currently the only output mode – but [other output modes](./packages/%40css-blocks/core/src/configuration/OutputMode.ts) for css-blocks may be added in the future.\n\n## Optimization (Optional)\nOnce we have all of our style data parsed from the __Block Parsing Phase__, and all of our usage data from the __Template Analysis Phase__, *and* the compiled Block CSS files, all this information is passed off to [Opticss][OPTICSS], our standalone CSS stylesheet optimizer, for style optimization!\n\nI encourage you to read up about Opticss and its internals [over in its repository][OPTICSS]. However, after all is said and done, and a lot of optimization magic is run, we are returned:\n\n  1. a re-written, optimized, CSS file;\n  2. a `StyleMapping` object with queryable rewrite data, described below;\n  3. an `Action` queue describing every transformation step the optimizer made.\n\n> Note: In a non-optimized build, this step is essentially a pass through. The Optimizer will return un-transformed CSS and `StyleMapping` data that is the same as the input data.\n\nThe [`StyleMapping`](./packages/%40css-blocks/core/src/TemplateRewriter/StyleMapping.ts) object returned by css-blocks after an Opticss run contains APIs that allow you to query a `RewriteMapping` for any Element analyzed during the __Analysis Phase__. This `RewriteMapping` contains all the information required to rewrite that Element from the old, pre-optimized classes, to the new, fully-optimized classes, as we will see in the __Rewrite Phase__.\n\n## Rewrite Phase\nPhew! Last step. Now that we have our final CSS stylesheet and it's corresponding `StyleMapping`, we can re-visit every Element we encountered during our __Analysis Phase__ and make sure it uses the correct classes at the right times.\n\nAs mentioned above, every Element has a corresponding [`RewriteMapping`](./packages/%40css-blocks/core/src/TemplateRewriter/RewriteMapping.ts) returned from Opticss. Any given Class, ID or Attribute associated with an element will map back to one (or many) optimized class names that should **only** be applied if a certain set of conditions are met.\n\nSome classes are static – they are always present on the element. Other classes are dynamic, and should only be applied if the application is in a specific state.\n\nKnowing this, we can conceptually think of these Element `RewriteMappings` as a set of classes and dynamic expressions (which evaluate to `true` or `false`), spread over a specially crafted boolean expression that is specific to that Element.\n\nFor example, given this Block file and template:\n\n```css\n.class-0 {\n  color: red;\n  float: left;\n}\n.class-1 {\n  color: red;\n  float: right;\n}\n.class-0[active] {\n  color: blue;\n}\n.class-1[color=yellow] {\n  color: yellow;\n}\n```\n\n```handlebars\n<div block:class=\"class-0\" block:active={{isActive}}>\n<div block:class=\"{{style-if isColorful 'class-1'}}\" block:color={{dynamicColor}}>\n```\n\nWe can easily conceptualize the `RewriteMapping` data for each element in development mode, when the CSS output is just BEM.\n\n```css\n.block__class-0 {\n  color: red;\n  float: left;\n}\n\n.block__class-1 {\n  color: red;\n  float: right;\n}\n\n/* Notice: `[active]` will *only* be applied when `.class-0` is also applied! */\n.block__class-0.block__class-0--active {\n  color: blue;\n}\n\n/* Notice: `[color=yellow]` will *only* be applied when `.class-1` is also applied! */\n.block__class-1.block__class-1--color-yellow {\n  color: yellow;\n}\n```\n\n```javascript\n// For Element 1:\n//   - `.class-0` is always applied\n//   - `.class-0[active]` is *only* applied when `isActive` is true\nconst el1Classes = [\n  \"block__class-0\",\n  isActive && \"block__class-0--active\"\n].join(' ');\n\n// For Element 2:\n//   - `.class-1` is applied when `isColorful` is true\n//   -  `[color=yellow]` is applied when `dynamicColor` === \"yellow\"\nconst el2Classes = [\n  isColorful ? \"block__class-1\" : \"\",\n  dynamicColor === \"yellow\" ? \"block__class-1--color-yellow\" : \"\",\n].join(' ');\n```\n\n> ⁉️ **Note**\n>\n> The above functional syntax is only here to explain the concept of `RewriteMapping`s and conditional style application! Please read about css-blocks' [Runtime Library][RUNTIME] to learn about how this dynamicism is actually represented in the browser.\n\nIn production mode however, these `RewriteMapping`s change! The optimized stylesheet may look something like this:\n\n```css\n.a { color: red; }\n.b { float: left; }\n.c { float: right; }\n.d { color: blue; }\n.e { color: yellow; }\n```\n\nAnd our `RewriteMapping`s will adjust to accommodate:\n\n```javascript\n// Element 1 styling logic remains the same, but uses updated classes.\nconst el1Classes = [\n  \"a b\",\n  isActive && \"d\"\n].join(' ');\n\n// Element 2 styling logic is updated to use the new minified classes,\n// but also pushes some stylesheet logic to the template!\n// `[color=yellow]` will *only every be applied when `isColorful`\n// is also truthy.\nconst el2Classes = [\n  isColorful ? \"a c\" : \"\",\n  isColorful && dynamicColor === \"yellow\" ? \"e\" : \"\",\n].join(' ');\n```\n\nNow, as mentioned above, what actually gets written out to your templates is *not* the very explicit JavaScript syntax you see above. The examples above were only written in that way to help explain the concept of `RewriteMapping`s.\n\nTo make life easy for template rewriters, css-blocks delivers its own tiny (~500byte) [Runtime Library][RUNTIME]. Rewriters only need to make sure they invoke this runtime function with the arguments provided to them by the `RewriteMapping` using the template's preferred syntax. You can read about implementation details of this runtime library in its package's [README][RUNTIME].\n\nBecause all this runtime logic is abstracted away from template rewriters, they can focus on a single task: understanding the template syntax and transforming individual elements.\n\n---\n\nAnd there it is. That is what happens, end to end, when you build a css-blocks project. Now lets talk about the code that actually makes this process tick.\n\n# Project Structure\n\nCSS Blocks is structured as a mono-repo, meaning all of the  packages we're about to talk about live in *this* Git repository, but still publish to individual node modules. You can read more about mono-repos and the associated tooling on the [lernajs.io][LERNA_WEBSITE] website.\n\nEvery module in css-blocks has its own dedicated README that deep-dives into the nitty-gritty implementation details of that package. So, instead of capturing that complexity here, this section will function as a reference for the major modules in css-blocks and provide a high-level description of each module's function.\n\nThe css-blocks mono-repo is organized into the following packages:\n\n## Core Packages\n\nCore css-blocks packages deliver anything that is considered a core-concern of css-blocks – including but not limited to: all the Block file parsing, analysis, and compilation logic, the browser runtime, shared rewrite data structures, etc.\n\n### [@css-blocks/core][CORE]\nHere be Dragons – `@css-blocks/core` is the package that drives everything that happens between reading a Block file and outputting final CSS! CSS Blocks core nearly deserves to be a mono-repo in its own right. All `BlockSyntax` features, functionality for constructing `BlockTrees`, the base class for all `Analyzer`s, the `BlockFactory` and `BlockCompiler` implementations, and more, live in this package.\n\n### [@css-blocks/runtime][RUNTIME]\nThe runtime package delivers the very slim in-browser runtime that handles dynamic class application. The high-level concept of *what* the runtime does is briefly explained in the **Rewrite Phase** section above, but for a more detailed examination of how we actually execute these arbitrary binary expressions, with N number of static or dynamic classes, check out this project's README.\n\n### [@css-blocks/code-style][RUNTIME]\nThis is a utility package that provides TSLint code style rules for the project. Currently, for consistency, it simply re-exports the code style rules delivered by [@opticss/opticss][OPTICSS], the CSS optimizer.\n\n## Template Integrations\nA core requirement of css-blocks is the ability to analyze and rewrite your application's templates. Because of language differences, every templating system will have a *slightly* different syntax when importing / referencing Blocks from a template, and for interacting with css-blocks classes / states in the markup.\n\n**Template Integration** packages' sole responsibility is to understand your project's specific templating syntax (ex: Glimmer, JSX, etc) and provide language specific `Analyzer` and `Rewriter`s.\n\n**Analyzers** will typically be run on one (1) entry point template and are responsible for two (2) things as the crawl the template dependency tree:\n\n  1. Discover Block files referenced by the templates and pass them to the `BlockFactory` (provided by `@css-blocks/core`) for compilation and,\n  2. After Block compilation, crawl every element in every template and log relevant Block class/state usage information on an `Analysis` object (also provided by `@css-blocks/core`).\n\n**Rewriters** are responsible for taking the aforementioned `StyleAnalysis` objects emitted from a Block compilation and transforming templates to use the new classes and updated dynamic expressions. **Rewriters** are a little more free-form than **Analyzers** because the will typically need to interface with the existing template compilation pipeline (ex: Babel Plugins for JSX, Glimmer AST Plugins for Glimmer).\n\nSpecific instructions for a given template integration can be found in their respective packages:\n\n### [@css-blocks/glimmer][GLIMMER]\nProvides the template integration for [Glimmer Templates][GLIMMER_WEBSITE].\n\n### [@css-blocks/jsx][JSX]\nProvides the template integration for [JSX Templates][JSX_WEBSITE].\n\n## Build System Integrations\n**Build System Integrations** are what allow css-blocks to work anywhere. Because the system is designed to be modular, a build integration can be made for any consuming build system. Every build integration will export a css-blocks plugin, in the form required by the system, and have some method to provide it an **Analyzer** and **Rewriter** to run on the project.\n\nThese build system integrations are responsible for understanding the file system abstraction provided by the build system, handing off templates to the **Analyzer** for analysis, and shuttling `StyleAnalays` data between the **Analyzer** and **Rewriter**.\n\n### [@css-blocks/broccoli][BROCCOLI]\nProvides the build system integration for [Broccoli][BROCCOLI_WEBSITE].\n\n### [@css-blocks/webpack][WEBPACK]\nProvides the build system integration for [Webpack][WEBPACK_WEBSITE].\n\n### [@css-blocks/ember-cli][EMBER_CLI]\nProvides the build system integration for [Ember CLI][EMBER_CLI_WEBSITE].\n\n## Public Websites\n\n### [@css-blocks/website][WEBSITE]\nThe public-facing website and hosted Typedoc API documentation hosted at [www.css-blocks.com][CSS_BLOCKS_WEBSITE].

The module\nnamed normalizeOptions has been renamed to resolver in the configuration\nmodule folder.\n* Now that all the other options types are named after Configuration, we\ncan rename SparseOptions to just Options.\n* ReadonlyOptions is really the configuration after having been fully\nresolved and populated by defaults.  So the name ResolvedConfiguration\nmakes more sense. This is the second of several commits to rename\nthe types for our options.\n* Options are things that you *can* pass in and in this project they derive\nfrom the project configuration. So this is the first of a few commits\nthat will result in SparseOptions being named just Options.\n* Some types related to options are removed/renamed.\n\nThe options code was some of the first I wrote for this project and it\nwas awkward to use. A lot of APIs expected a concrete options reader\ninstead of just the options interface in a read-only state.\n\nThe options reader is no longer exported, the new normalizeOptions\nfunction should be used to get a read-only options object populated\nwith default values where necessary.\n\nWhere user-supplied options are accepted, the SparseOptions type is\naccepted and then normalized.\n* The data option was too general of a name to describe its intent for\npassing data to the importer.\n\n\n\n\n\n<a name=\"0.17.0\"></a>\n# [0.17.0](https://github.com/linkedin/css-blocks/compare/0.15.1...0.17.0) (2017-12-08)\n\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n* add missing files into npm package. ([c40f020](https://github.com/linkedin/css-blocks/commit/c40f020))\n* call seal() on element analyses before using them. ([51d7a09](https://github.com/linkedin/css-blocks/commit/51d7a09))\n* Disable buggy stray reference errors for now.

([26acdc8](https://github.com/linkedin/css-blocks/commit/26acdc8))\n* **analyzer:** Seal the analysis before using it. ([bdf1580](https://github.com/linkedin/css-blocks/commit/bdf1580))\n* **rewriter:** Don't remove nodes that are already removed. ([c3b8ce1](https://github.com/linkedin/css-blocks/commit/c3b8ce1))\n* **rewriter:** Get rewriter via a callback instead of through options to avoid serialization. ([ecf623a](https://github.com/linkedin/css-blocks/commit/ecf623a))\n* **rewriter:** glimmer requires that subexpressions be helper invocations. ([bae23cb](https://github.com/linkedin/css-blocks/commit/bae23cb))\n* Only enforce a value's presence in a dynamic switch condition if the condition is not disabled due to a missing style dependency. ([13cbd58](https://github.com/linkedin/css-blocks/commit/13cbd58))\n* The analysis array gets added to while processing it so we have to monitor the array until its length doesn't change.

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all. People violating this code of conduct may be banned from the community.\n\nOur open source communities strive to:\n\n* **Be friendly and patient:** Remember you might not be communicating in someone else's primary spoken or programming language, and others may not have your level of understanding.\n* **Be welcoming:** Our communities welcome and support people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.\n* **Be respectful:** We are a world-wide community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. Disrespectful and unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:\n    * Violent threats or language.\n    * Discriminatory or derogatory jokes and language.\n    * Posting sexually explicit or violent material.\n    * Posting, or threatening to post, people's personally identifying information (\"doxing\").\n    * Insults, especially those using discriminatory terms or slurs.\n    * Behavior that could be perceived as sexual attention.\n    * Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behaviors.\n* **Understand disagreements:** Disagreements, both social and technical, are useful learning opportunities. Seek to understand the other viewpoints and resolve differences constructively.\n* This code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to capture our common understanding of a productive, collaborative environment. We expect the code to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.\n\n### Scope\n\nThis code of conduct applies to all repos and communities for LinkedIn-managed open source projects regardless of whether or not the repo explicitly calls out its use of this code. The code also applies in public spaces when an individual is representing a project or its community. Examples include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.\n\nNote: Some LinkedIn-managed communities have codes of conduct that pre-date this document and issue resolution process. While communities are not required to change their code, they are expected to use the resolution process outlined here. The review team will coordinate with the communities involved to address your concerns.\n\n### Reporting Code of Conduct Issues\n\nWe encourage all communities to resolve issues on their own whenever possible. This builds a broader and deeper understanding and ultimately a healthier interaction. In the event that an issue cannot be resolved locally, please feel free to report your concerns by contacting [oss@linkedin.com](mailto:oss@linkedin.com).\n\nIn your report please include:\n\n*   Your contact information.\n*   Names (real, usernames or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there are additional witnesses, please include them as well.\n*   Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public chat log), please include a link or attachment.\n*   Any additional information that may be helpful.\n\nAll reports will be reviewed by a multi-person team and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Where additional perspectives are needed, the team may seek insight from others with relevant expertise or experience. The confidentiality of the person reporting the incident will be kept at all times. Involved parties are never part of the review team.\n\nAnyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If an individual engages in unacceptable behavior, the review team may take any action they deem appropriate, including a permanent ban from the community.\n\n_This code of conduct is based on the [Microsoft](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/) Open Source Code of Conduct which was based on the [template](http://todogroup.org/opencodeofconduct) established by the [TODO Group](http://todogroup.org/) and used by numerous other large communities (e.g., [Facebook](https://code.facebook.com/pages/876921332402685/open-source-code-of-conduct), [Yahoo](https://yahoo.github.io/codeofconduct), [Twitter](https://engineering.twitter.com/opensource/code-of-conduct), [GitHub](http://todogroup.org/opencodeofconduct/#opensource@github.com)) and the Scope section from the [Contributor Covenant version 1.4](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/)._"

          "content": "CSS Blocks\n==========\n\n**ATTENTION:** This is the original README that Chris wrote for for this project.\nMuch of it was written before the features it talks about even existed. Some of those\nfeatures still do not exist, and of those, some may never exist. We're in the process\nof removing this file, you probably want to be reading the [README](./README.md) instead.\n\n-------\nCSS Blocks are a way of writing highly decoupled and isolated styles that can be statically analyzed and optimized for delivery and runtime performance.\n\nIn a component-oriented web application there's one pillar of web technology that doesn't quite seem to fit: Cascading Style Sheets. The goals of components are to create strong boundaries and isolated behaviors that can be composed without tight coupling. CSS is global and the desire to create visual consistency across an application seems at odds with the goal of isolation. What's more, techniques that produce styles that are kept in isolation have been at odds with browser performance: highly specific and scoped selectors have performance issues, class name mangling is bad for gzip compression, inline styles are slow, and mixins, while useful for sharing styles consistently into components, produce bloated output.\n\nThe smallest, most performance-friendly stylesheets tend to be oriented around highly presentational aspects that shun even basic abstractions.\n\nCSS blocks is a set of tools that work together to provide component-oriented styling that compiles to high-performance presentational selectors:\n\n1. Component authoring system.\n2. Template analyzer.\n3. CSS optimizer.\n4. Template rewriter.\n5. A runtime for dynamic style manipulation.\n\nAll of these tools exist to make the CSS optimizer as powerful as possible and to keep the style interfaces that we use, consistent despite the significant changes that the optimizer makes.\n\nWhen it all comes together, the bloat and performance issues that are inherent to isolation are optimized away. You can write `width: 100%` hundreds of times but the optimized CSS will only have a few such declarations where they are absolutely needed.\n\nInspired by CSS Modules, BEM and Atomic CSS\n-------------------------------------------\n\nThis approach to styling is an evolution of many existing best practices. It aims to provide the isolation and component-oriented approach possible with\nCSS Modules and BEM with less repetition required by authors and being more\ncompression friendly while providing tooling to aggressively optimize those\nstyles by sharing declarations as one might with Atomic CSS and similar\ndeclaration-oriented styling solutions.\n\nErgonomic Performance\n---------------------\n\nAlthough there are constraints on the types of selectors you can write with CSS blocks,\nadopting CSS blocks is unlikely to feel like a major departure from your current\napproach. Users report that their styles are cleaner, more organized, and less\ncoupled. It's possible to reduce your CSS size by up to 80% (about 65% after gzip).\nIf you have a route-based bundling system, it is possible to build CSS bundles that\nare optimized for that most important first page view.\n\nUse with your favorite tools\n----------------------------\n\nCSS Blocks is built on standard CSS syntax so it can be used in conjunction\nwith CSS best-in-class processing tools like Sass, PostCSS, CSS Nano,\nAutoprefixer, etc.\n\nWhen using CSS blocks with syntactic sugars like Sass, Less, or Stylus, you\nmust first compile all of the blocks with that processor and provide the\noutputs of that file to this one. (Alternatively, the Importer API\ndocumented below can be leveraged to do just-in-time compilation.)\n\nNote that when post processing your CSS files with other compressors and\nfixups, it is recommended that you do so only after using the CSS blocks\noptimizer. If any tools change the selectors that have been output from the\ncompressor, you are likely to encounter problems especially with dynamic\ninteractions.\n\nWhat's a Block?\n---------------\n\nThe \"block\" in CSS Blocks is a unit of styling that is kept isolated\nfrom all other blocks. The styles in one block are related to each other\nin a functional way such that they wouldn't make sense by themselves.\n\nThe styles in a block are kept in their own CSS file to avoid confusion.\n\nMost commonly, there's a single block for a particular component. However,\nit also completely natural and expected for several blocks to be composed\ntogether in an HTML template.\n\nThe name \"Block\" finds it's origin in the BEM approach to CSS architecture.\nThey share some key concepts. In fact, it is possible to compile a CSS Block\ninto BEM syntax and so for many of the code examples used here that is the\noutput mode used because it is familiar and more human readable than other\noutput modes.\n\nHow a CSS block becomes available to markup in a template is specific to the\nindividual template syntax and framework conventions. See Template\nIntegrations below for more details on specifically supported frameworks.\n\nFor our first example we will wave our hands and say that *somehow* these\nplain HTML markup examples are specific to the corresponding block files.\n\n### An example of a simple form\n\nConsider the following markup:\n\n```html\n<form state:theme=dark state:compact>\n  <div class=\"input-area\">\n    <label for=\"username\" class=\"label\">Username:</label>\n    <input id=\"username\" class=\"input\" type=\"text\">\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"input-area\">\n    <label for=\"password\" class=\"label\">Password:</label>\n    <input id=\"password\" class=\"input\" type=\"password\">\n  </div>\n  <button type=\"submit\" class=\"submit\" state:disabled disabled>\n</form>\n```\n\nIn conjunction with the following block stylesheet that styles classes and attributes\nin the `state` namespace:\n\n```css\n/* my-form.block.css */\n.root                   { block-name: my-form; margin: 2em 0; padding: 1em 0.5em; }\n[state|theme=light]     { color: #333; }\n[state|theme=dark]      { color: #ccc; }\n[state|compact]         { margin: 0.5em 0; padding: 0.5em; }\n.input-area             { display: flex; margin: 1em 0; font-size: 1.5rem; }\n[state|compact]\n  .input-area           { margin: 0.25em 0; }\n.label                  { flex-basis: 1; }\n.input                  { flex-basis: 3; }\n[state|theme=light]\n  .input                { border-color: #333; }\n[state|theme=dark]\n  .input                { border-color: #ccc; }\n.submit                 { width: 200px; }\n.submit[state|disabled] { color: gray; }\n```\n\nIn BEM compatibility mode these would compile to:\n\n```html\n<form class=\"my-form my-form--theme-dark my-form--compact\">\n  <div class=\"my-form__input-area\">\n    <label for=\"username\" class=\"my-form__label\">Username:</label>\n    <input id=\"username\" class=\"my-form__input\" type=\"text\">\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"my-form__input-area\">\n    <label for=\"password\" class=\"my-form__label\">Password:</label>\n    <input id=\"password\" class=\"my-form__input\" type=\"password\">\n  </div>\n  <button type=\"submit\" class=\"my-form__submit my-form__submit--disabled\">\n</form>\n```\n\nand\n\n```css\n.my-form { margin: 2em 0; padding: 1em 0.5em; }\n.my-form--theme-light { color: #333; }\n.my-form--theme-dark { color: #ccc; }\n.my-form--compact { margin: 0.5em 0; padding: 0.5em; }\n.my-form__input-area { display: flex; margin: 1em 0; font-size: 1.5rem; }\n.my-form--compact .my-form__input-area { margin: 0.25em 0; }\n.my-form__label { flex-basis: 1; }\n.my-form__input { flex-basis: 3; }\n.my-form--theme-light .my-form__input { border-color: #333; }\n.my-form--theme-dark .my-form__input { border-color: #ccc; }\n.my-form__submit { width: 200px; }\n.my-form__submit--disabled { color: gray; }\n```\n\nAfter optimization it may look more like:\n\n```css\n.c4 { margin: 2em 0 }\n.c5 { margin: 0.5em 0 }\n.c6 { margin: 1em 0 }\n.c7 { padding: 1em 0.5em }\n.c8 { padding: 0.5em }\n.c9 { color: #333 }\n.ca { color: #ccc }\n.cb { color: gray }\n.cc { display: flex }\n.cd { font-size: 1.5rem }\n.ce { flex-basis: 1 }\n.cf { flex-basis: 3 }\n.cg { width: 200px }\n.c3 .ch { margin: 0.25em 0 }\n.c1 .ci { border-color: #333 }\n.c2 .cj { border-color: #ccc }\n```\n\nand the template would become:\n\n```html\n<form class=\"c4 c7 c3 c2\">\n  <div class=\"cc c6 cd ch\">\n    <label for=\"username\" class=\"ce\">Username:</label>\n    <input id=\"username\" class=\"cf\" type=\"text\">\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"cc c6 cd ch\">\n    <label for=\"password\" class=\"ce\">Password:</label>\n    <input id=\"password\" class=\"cf\" type=\"password\">\n  </div>\n  <button type=\"submit\" class=\"cg cb\">\n</form>\n```\n\nThere's not a lot of benefit to optimizing a single block -- remember the goal\nis to remove duplication across components. At scale, CSS Blocks works wonders.\n\nNow that we've seen what it looks like, let's dig in.\n\nWhat's a State?\n---------------\n\nYou probably noticed the attributes prefixed with `state:` in the example\nabove. States are a core concept in CSS Blocks and form the basis for\nconstraints on the selectors that we write. These constraints are important\nfor keeping runtime state of the browser to a minimum and at well defined\nplaces which allows the optimizer to work better. States also force us\nto write selectors with a minimal amount of coupling between elements.\nAt first it may feel restrictive, especially if you're used to using context\nas a way of describing differences in the way a shared component looks.\n\nYou'll remember that a block is a way of isolating the styles contained\nwithin it. That means we can't use context as a proxy for understanding\ndesign differences because it's not possible (for example) for the sidebar\nto create a selector that changes how a button that is styled by another\nblock will look by targeting the classes and states of that other block.\n\nStates come in two flavors. Most states are a boolean state that is either\non or off. This is represented in markup as a state attribute without a\nvalue. Some states are mutually exclusive from one another. For instance, if\na block provides a light and dark theme you can't apply both at the same\ntime. In this case, the state can be assigned substates that are exclusive\nfrom each other. Such states are represented in markup by a state attribute\nthat is assigned a value. For instance `<div state:theme=\"light\">`.\n\nA state is attached to a single class in the block and describes how that\nclass changes when the element is in that state. The names of states are\nscoped to their class and the styles they provide can target only elements\nassigned to that classname. The exception to this is for states that belong\nto the block `:scope` class. In general, CSS Blocks restricts the use of\ncombinators in selectors with a preference for unscoped selectors that are\nfast and optimization friendly (See Rules & Constraints below). One of the\nprimary exceptions to this is that root states can be used in selectors as a\nscope for classes and other states within the block. So when you find\nyourself thinking that you absolutely need to use a descendant or child\ncombinator then you should imagine that use case as a state for a block's\n `:scope` class.\n\nIt is important to think of States as part of the public API that describe\nhow a block and the classes within it can vary. By keeping all the\ndifferences local, it's easier to maintain a block and to understand how\nchanges to the block will affect an entire application. When we remove\noutside context from selectors it becomes possible to re-use those styles\nsafely. It also forces developers to think of naming their design\ndifferences explicitly which has long term benefits for maintaining the\nstyles -- you can certainly create a state `state:in-sidebar` for a block,\nbut it's much better to imagine *why* the sidebar is different and to name\nit accordingly. In this way, other developers will understand the intent\nbetter.\n\nOccasionally, some states are best managed for an entire application and\nmany blocks will need to react to those state changes. Traditionally, this\ndone by applying a class to the `html` or `body` elements. To deal with this\nCSS Blocks allow some states to be declared global and used as if it\nbelonged to the block. As with all things global, this increases the testing\ncosts and adds coupling, however, it is actually quite friendly to the\noptimizer. See \"Global (application) States\" below for more information.\n\nIt is worth noting that with CSS Blocks it is possible for one block to\napply it's own classes that override styles from other classes and states\nfor a given element by applying them together at the template level. CSS\nBlocks also provides a powerful resolution system to handle this use case.\nBut this exists to support the situation where the classes are targeting\nvery different styling concerns. It is strongly discouraged to use classes\nas overrides across blocks.\n\nA much better solution when you can't make the change to pre-existing block\nfor some reason is to use Block Inheritance to add new classes and states to\nan existing block. Inheritance is another way that a block can present\ndifferent styling options. For more information, see \"Block Inheritance\"\nbelow.\n\nTerminology\n-----------\n\n### CSS Terminology\n\nCSS Blocks cares an awful lot about the kinds of selectors that you will be writing.\nSo before we begin talking about selectors let's make sure we understand some of the\nmore arcane terminology that is most often found only in W3C specifications. Don't let\nthis scare you, the system is actually very simple to use, it's just the rules are\nhard to describe clearly without these terms.\n\n![CSS Terms Example](https://rawgit.com/chriseppstein/af2939a908582ba7c61c2bdf88d5a46e/raw/1c2dbdb19288f26f2f2369aef82caa2c551ab71b/css-terms.svg)\n\n1. `selector` - A general term for an expression that selects elements from an HTML document.\n   There are several subtypes:\n\n    1. `simple selector` - selects one aspect of an html element. E.g. element name,\n       class, attribute, identifier, `*`, pseudo-class, pseudo-element,\n    2. `compound selector` - a sequence of `simple selectors` applied to the same element.\n    3. `combinator` - a symbol that describes the document relationship\n       between two selectors. The most common `combinator` is the space which\n       implies a descendant relationship.\n    4. `key selector` - The `simple` or `compound` selector that applies to\n       the element that receives the `declarations` in the `ruleset`.\n    5. `context selector` - Describes the other elements on the page that must be present\n       in order for the `key selector` to match.\n2. `ruleset` - A selector and a set of styles applied to the elements selected.\n3. `property` - A style attribute.\n4. `value` - What a `property` is set to.\n5. `declaration` - A `property`/`value` pair.\n\n### CSS Block Terminology\n\n1. Block - A block is a set of interdependent styles that exist in isolation\n   from styles in other Blocks. A block has a name.\n2. Root - The root element of the block. All other HTML elements assigned styles\n   from a Block must be contained in the HTML subtree of elements of the\n   block's root.\n3. Class - Any class in a block file is local to that block and isolated\n   from all other similarly named classes in other blocks.\n4. State - A state is attached to a particular class. States attached to the\n   block's root class have special privileges.\n5. Substate - A state can have substates and can only be in one such substate\n   at any given time.\n8. Block Inheritance - A block can inherit styles from another block. This\n   creates an equivalence between the roots and all the names for the two\n   block's states and classes. For more on inheritance see the Block\n   Inheritance section below.\n9. Block Interface - A block's public interface is defined by the states and\n   classes it styles. A block can declare that it implements one or more\n   other block's interfaces and the compiler will ensure that all of those\n   states and classes are styled locally. In this way, it is safe to use\n   different blocks to style the same markup component.\n\nRules & Constraints\n-------------------\n\n1. Each selector's key selector must target a single block object (the\n   block root, a block class, or a state).\n2. The same block object targeted by the key selector can be used in the\n   context selector.\n3. pseudo-classes can be used in conjunction with any block object in the\n   context and key selectors.\n4. Pseudo-elements can be used in conjunction with the key selector.\n5. Media queries and other @-rules are allowed.\n6. The context selector cannot contain classes or external selectors. The\n   exception to this is that the block object in the key selector can be part\n   of it's own context selector.\n7. The context selector cannot contain states, except for at most one state\n   if it belongs to the root class of the same block or is a global state of\n   another block's root. See \"Global (application) States\" below.\n8. You may not use a block class outside of the root element's HTML subtree.\n9. `!important` is forbidden.\n10. Element, Attribute, ID selectors are discouraged. See \"External Selectors\" below.\n11. All classes are local by default. See \"External Selectors\" below.\n12. Two classes from the same block may not be applied to the same HTML element.\n\nSyntax\n------\n\n### The root element\n\nStyles can be attached to a block's root element with the class `:scope`. The\n`:scope` class can be used in selectors in combination with itself as well as\nin media queries and other @-rules. However, some block-specific syntax may\nonly be put into a simple ruleset where the selector is exactly `:scope`; it\nis convention to have only one such ruleset near the top of your block's\nfile.\n\nRoot specific declarations:\n\n* `block-name`: Optional. This is the preferred name of the block. The value\n  must be a legal css identifier. When omitted, the path of the file is used\n  to derive a name. This property is required when the natural name based on\n  the file's path is not a legal CSS identifier. Note: the way a path becomes\n  a name is configurable on a per-application or framework integration basis.\n* `implements`: a space separated list of block names that have already been\n  declared with `@block` (See below).\n* `extends`: the value is name of a single block from which to inherit the\n  styles and public interface. Note that this does not change the output of\n  the block but instead it affects the classes that are used in the templates\n  after rewriting.\n\n### Classes\n\nClasses in a block are syntactically identical to classes in a standard CSS\nfile but are subject to the rules and constraints mentioned above.\n\n### States\n\nA State is represented as an attribute on an html element with the `state:` prefix.\nStates can have substates by assigning a value to the attribute. This prefix\nis important for template analysis to ensure that states are used correctly and\nproperly rewritten to standard CSS classes.\n\nExamples of specifying states in html:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"button\" state:visible state:theme=\"bright\">\n```\n\nThen those states can be style in a block with corresponding attribute selectors:\n\n```css\n.button[state|visible] {\n  display: inline;\n}\n.button[state|theme=\"bright\"] {\n  color: white;\n  background-color: red;\n}\n```\n\nThe attribute selector for a substate must use the `=` operator. This ensures\nthat substates are mutually exclusive and also that a correspondence between\nattributes and optimized classnames can be created.\n\nNote that we use a `|` instead of a colon in the stylesheet. This is\nstandard CSS syntax for an attribute namespace and all compliant CSS parsers\nallow it.\n\nIt is not allowed to have a state with substates but to reference it without\nincluding a substate. E.g. you cannot have `<div class=\"button\" state:size=\"large\">`\nand then reference it with `.button[state|size]`, Instead, you must provide\na ruleset that matches all substates.\nE.g. `.button[state|size=large], .button[state|size=small]`.\n\n### Block References\n\nYou can declare a dependency on another block with the `@block`\n@-rule. Block references don't cause any styles to be included. Instead,\nthey are like an ES6 `import` statement -- they make it possible to refer to\nthe public interface of another block from within the current block and to\nresolve any namespace collisions with locally preferred identifiers.\n\nA `@block` creates a locally scoped alias for the styles in the referenced block:\n\n```css\n@block icons from \"../../shared/styles/icons/dark.block.css\";\n```\n\n### Conflicting Block Names\n\nIf two blocks are defined with conflicting names, CSS Blocks will\nautomatically generate a unique name for BEM output mode.\n\n`shared.block.css`\n\n```css\n:scope {\n  block-name: my-block;\n  color: blue;\n}\n.item {\n  color: red;\n}\n```\n\n`my-component/styles.block.css`\n\n```css\n@block shared from \"../shared.block.css\";\n\n:scope {\n  block-name: my-block;\n  background-color: blue;\n}\n.item {\n  background-color: red;\n}\n```\n\n`my-component/template.hbs`\n```hbs\n<div class=\"shared\">\n  <div class=\"item\">Styles Item</div>\n  <div class=\"shared.item\">Shared Item</div>\n</div>\n```\n\nIn BEM output mode this would compile to:\n\n```hbs\n<div class=\"my-block my-block-2\">\n  <div class=\"my-block__item\"></div>\n  <div class=\"my-block-2__item\"></div>\n</div>\n```\n\nGlobal (application) States\n---------------------------\n\nA block can declare that a state is global. These states are special\nin that they can be used in combinators in other blocks like any state\nfrom that block.\n\nThis is most useful for global application states like during initial\napplication boot or when a modal is displayed.\n\nPerformance note: when you apply classes and other attributes to\nelements like `<html>` or `<body>` it invalidates a lot of internal\ncaches in the browser. It is still often a performance win compared to\nquerying the document in javascript and applying classes on many\nelements.\n\n`application.block.css`\n\n```css\n@block-global [state|is-loading];\n@block-global [state|is-saving];\n```\n\n`navigation.block.css`\n```css\n@block app from \"application.block.css\";\n\napp[state|is-saving] .signout,\n.signout[state|disabled] {\n  color: gray;\n  pointer-events: none;\n}\n```\n\n### Block Object Expressions\n\nThere are situations in blocks and templates that use them where it is necessary to refer\nto a specific block object. In these cases, a block object expression is used. A block\nobject expression looks similar to a compound selector but it should not be confused\nwith a specific selector in the block. In fact, it is an abstraction that can cause\nthe CSS blocks compiler to consider many selectors in a block that involve the specific\nblock object.\n\n  - `:scope` represents the block root for the current block.\n  - `a-block-reference.root` represents the block root for the\n    block that has a `@block` as `a-block-reference` from the current\n    block. In many cases, the `:scope` can be safely omitted.\n  - `[state|foo]` or `[state|foo=bar]` represent the\n    root state named `foo` or the state named `foo` with the substate of `bar`.\n  - `a-block-reference[state|foo]` or `a-block-reference[state|foo=bar]`\n    represent the state named `foo` or the state named `foo`\n    with the value of `bar` from the block that is referenced from the current\n    block as `a-block-reference`. In templates, where a block object\n    expression is given in the context of a state attribute, this simplifies\n    to `<div state:a-block-reference.foo>` or `<div state:a-block-reference.foo=bar>`.\n  - `.foo` represents the class named `foo`;\n  - `a-block-reference.foo` represents the class named `foo`\n    from the block that is referenced from the current block as\n    `a-block-reference`.\n  - `.my-class[state|foo]` or `.my-class[state|foo=bar]` represents the\n    state named `foo` attached to the class `.my-class`.\n  - `a-block-reference.my-class[state|foo]` or\n    `a-block-reference.my-class[state|foo=bar]` represents the\n    state named `foo` attached to the class `.my-class` from the block\n    that is referenced from the current block as `a-block-reference`.\n    In templates, where a block object expression is given in the context of\n    `class` and `state` attributes, this simplifies to\n    `<div class=\"a-block-reference.my-class\" state:a-block-reference.foo>`.\n\n### External Selectors\n\nSometime a class, identifier, or tag name comes from an external library or\ncontent comes from a database and the only thing you can do is use them as\nis. For these situations The block must declare the simple selectors that\nare external to the block. These simple selectors can then be used as key\nselectors that are scoped by a block's root, class or state as long as the\ncontext selector would be valid as it's own selector as specified in the\nRules & Constraints section.\n\nYou'll get an error for any declared external selectors that aren't used or\nif they are used in the context selector. Styles targeting an external selector\nare not rewritten and their declarations cannot be optimized. Style collisions\non an external selector are not detected or resolved. As a result, it is allowed\nto use `!important` on declarations targeting an external selector.\n\nWarning: If external selectors and CSS block objects both target the same\nHTML element in their key selectors you will get unpredictable results. It's\nbest to avoid this.\n\n```css\n@external h2 .some-rando-class;\n\n.foo h2.some-rando-class {\n  font-size: 32px;\n}\n```\n\n### Block Composition\n\nIn some cases a block class is logically the root of another block.\nRather than having to specify the block root, a block class can declare itself to be the root of another block in a specific state or set of states.\n\n```css\n// tab.block.css\n:scope {\n  background-color: gray;\n  color: black;\n  flex: 1 1 content;\n}\n[state|selected] {\n  background-color: blue;\n  color: white;\n}\n[state|permanent] {\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n\n.button {\n  background-image: url(close-button.svg);\n  cursor: hand;\n}\n\n[state|permanent] .button {\n  background-image: url(pin.svg);\n  cursor: pointer;\n  pointer-events: none;\n}\n```\n\n```\n\n// tabs.block.css\n@block tab from \"tab.block.css\";\n:scope {\n  display: flex;\n}\n\n.main-tab {\n  text-decoration: underline;\n}\n```\n\nWithout the `@is-block` directive the markup would look like this:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"tabs\">\n  <span class=\"tab main-tab\" state:tab.permanent>\n    <a href=\"/main.html\">\n      Home\n      <img class=\"tab.button\"></img>\n  </span>\n</div>\n```\n\nBut in this example, the very concept of the \"main tab\" implies that it is a\ntab and also that it's permanent so this feels redundant. So we augement\nthe `.main-tab` class:\n\n```css\n.main-tab {\n  @is-block tab[state|permanent];\n}\n```\n\nAnd now, with the `@is-block` directive we can just write this instead:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"tabs\">\n  <span class=\"main-tab\">\n    <a href=\"/main.html\">\n      Home\n      <img class=\"tab.close\">x</img>\n  </span>\n</div>\n```\n\nAll the same output classes are implied in both of these cases for the resulting re-written markup.\n\nBecause the `main-tab` class implies the `tab` root class, it is now\nalso legal to apply the `state:tab.selected` state to that element.\n\n\n\n### Block Inheritance\n\nTo inherit from another block you must first define a reference to the\nother block:\n\n```css\n@block another from \"./another-block.block.css\";\n```\n\nAnd now that block can be referenced within this file by the name\n`another`.\n\nTo inherit, you must set the property `extends` inside the block's `:scope`\nclass to the name of the block you wish to inherit.\n\n```css\n@block-refererence another from \"./another-block.block.css\";\n\n:scope {\n  extends: another;\n}\n```\n\nNote that block inheritance does not change the CSS output for a block.\ninstead, it changes exported identifiers associated with the block's\ndifferent objects. That is, the class(es) that are generated from\n`another-block`'s `.foo` element are now associated with this blocks\n`.foo` element and all of the classes will be returned to the template.\nAdditionally, even if an object from the base class isn't mentioned in\nthe subclass, you can still set the classnames associated with it as if\nit had them.\n\nInheritance is generally preferred over root states when a design difference affects\nmany classes within the block because it optimizes better -- but it is not\nfriendly for composing with other sub-blocks on the same element.\n\n### Block Interfaces\n\nIn some cases it may be necessary for a block to conform to the public API\nof one or more blocks but that you want to provide a distinct\nimplementation of that interface. To accomplish this, you can declare\na block `implements` one or more blocks.\n\n```css\n@block base from \"./base.block.css\";\n@block other from \"./other.block.css\";\n:scope { implements: base, other; color: red; }\n```\n\nNow if there are any states, classes or substates in those other blocks\nthat aren't mentioned in this block you will get an error:\n\n```\nMissing implementations for: [state|large], .foo[state|small] from\n./base.block.css\n```\n\nNote that this doesn't require a selector-level correspondence, merely\nthat the different types of states and classes have *some* styling.\n\n### Resolving Style Conflicts\n\nOne of the key features of CSS blocks is its unique resolution system that\ntogether with knowledge of what classes are used together on the same\nelements in all templates using CSS blocks provides hints to the optimizer\nso that it can provable rewrite declarations across what would normally be\nunsafe to do with a normal cascade aware optimizer which must assume that\nkey selectors *may* target the same html element.\n\nStyle conflicts are handled on a per-property basis and allow for a high\ngranularity of control over how collisions are resolved.\n\nProbably the most important concept that you need to understand about conflict\nresolutions is that you are declaring which block object owns a particular property\nwhen it conflicts with a specific selector in the current scope. Then, the block compiler\ngenerates selectors that use specificity to create the desired resolution value\nfor all selectors that conflict with that property for that block object.\n\nConflict resolution is aware of short-hand/long-hand property collisions and\nwill resolve the desired property correctly.\n\nDuring template analysis, any selectors that conflict due to actual usage\nwill produce an error unless a resolution is provided.\n\nThis may sound very complicated, but some code examples will elucidate\njust how natural it feels in use:\n\n#### Yield Resolution\n\nThe first kind of resolution is called a \"yield\". That's where the styles\nfor a property in the current selector yield to the values for the selectors\nthat conflict in another block object's selectors.\n\n```css\n/* nav.block.css */\n.nav { border: 1px solid black; }\n```\n\n```css\n/* header.block.css */\n@block other from \"./other.css\";\n.header {\n  border: none;\n  border: resolve(\"other.nav\");\n}\n```\n\nJust like a browser that would discard previous values for the same property\nif it understands the later property's value, we can imagine that this is\nlike a value that only gets set and matters only when it matches an element\nwhere `other.nav` is the key selector in the cascade.\n\nTo accomplish this, we compile the selector to something a browser will\n actually understand and respect:\n\n```css\n/* header.resolve-output.css */\n.conflicts__header { border: none; }\n.other__nav.conflicts__header { border: 1px solid black; }\n```\n\nAs you can see, without optimization this produces selectors that use specificity\nto resolve any possible conflicts irrespective of concatenation order.\n\nWhat might not be as obvious is that for an optimizer that wants to combine\n`border: 1px solid black` from `.other__nav` with another\n`border: 1px solid block` declaration that it finds in the stylesheet, it wouldn't be\nable to do so if the `.conflicts__header` selector was intervening between\nthem. It would have to assume that they might conflict. With template\nanalysis alone it may be able to safely combine those declarations with\nintervening conflicts because it could know that two particular classes never\ncollide. But with this extra hint it can go even further -- it proves that\nyes, there's a conflict, but thanks to specificity, it can now rewrite all\nthree selectors having the declaration of `border: 1px solid black` into a\nsingle selector as long as it correctly rewrites the template to use that\nclass instead of the one associated with `border:none`.\n\n#### Override Resolution\n\nAn override resolution is when the values in the current selector take precedence\nover the values for that property in the resolution target.\n\nGiven our same example from before:\n\n```css\n/* nav.block.css */\n.nav { border: 1px solid black; }\n```\n\nWe now resolve the target block object before our local values, causing our\nlocal values to take precedence.\n\n```css\n/* header.block.css */\n@block other from \"./other.css\";\n.header {\n  border: resolve(\"other.nav\");\n  border: none;\n}\n```\n\nThe compiler produces similar output to the yield resolution, but now the\nresolved selector has the value from the local selector.\n\n```css\n/* header.resolve-output.css */\n.conflicts__header { border: none; }\n.other__nav.conflicts__header { border: none; }\n```\n\nLet's consider some more complex cases and see how the resolver handles those.\n\n### Resolving Pseudo-elements\n\nWhen resolving a selector for a pseudo-element, only conflicts for other\nselectors of that same pseudo-element are resolved.\n\n```css\n/* links.block.css */\n.external { font-style: normal; }\n.external::before { content: \"[\"; font-style: normal; }\n.external::after { content: \"]\"; font-style: normal; }\n```\n\n```css\n/* lists.block.css */\n@block links from \"./links.block.css\";\n.list-item::before {\n  content: \"*\";\n  content: resolve(\"links.external\");\n  font-style: resolve(\"links.external\");\n  font-style: italic;\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, the only resolution would be:\n\n```css\n.links__external.lists__list-item::before {\n  content: \"[\";\n  font-style: italic;\n}\n```\n\n### Resolving Pseudo-classes\n\nAll selectors conflicting with the resolved property are resolved against the\ntarget block's root, class or state regardless of pseudo-classes.\n\nWhat this means is that when you override a target with pseudo classes, you\neffectively nullify the effect of those pseudo-classes on the resolved property.\nThose pseudo-classes would have to be reproduced locally and set to and explicit\nvalue (also with an override resolution) in order to preserve the conflicting pseudo-class behavior.\n\nExample:\n\n```css\n/* links.block.css */\n.external { color: blue; }\n.external:nth-child(2n + 1) { color: yellow; }\n.external:hover { color: green; }\n```\n\n```css\n/* lists.block.css */\n@block links from \"./links.block.css\";\n.list-item {\n  color: purple;\n  color: resolve(\"links.external\");\n}\n.list-item:nth-child(4n + 1) {\n  color: resolve(\"links.external\");\n  color: black;\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, the resolutions would be:\n\n```css\n.links__external.lists__list-item {\n  color: blue;\n}\n.links__external.lists__list-item:nth-child(2n + 1) {\n  color: yellow;\n}\n.links__external.lists__list-item:hover {\n  color: green;\n}\n.links__external.lists__list-item:nth-child(4n + 1),\n.links__external.lists__list-item:nth-child(2n + 1):nth-child(4n + 1),\n.links__external.lists__list-item:hover:nth-child(4n + 1) {\n  color: black;\n}\n```\n\n### Resolving State Conflicts\n\nStyles for target block's root state or class state may also conflict with\nthe current selector. State selectors have a higher specificity and so you\nmay expect that they would automatically resolve against a lower specificity\nselector without needing an explicit resolution. But experience shows\nspecificity is not always the determining factor in what should win; if it\nwere, we'd never have used `!important` to work around it. Each state is\nit's own concern and must be resolved in the case of a conflict.\n\n```css\n/* article.block.css */\n.link { color: lightblue; }\n.link[state|destination=on-page] { color: blue; }\n.link[state|destination=external] { color: red; }\n.link[state|disabled] { color: gray; }\n[state|is-loading] > .link { color: darkgray; }\n```\n\n```css\n/* icons.block.css */\n.icon {\n  color: resolve(\"article.link\");\n  color: resolve(\"article.link[state|destination=on-page]\");\n  color: white;\n  color: resolve(\"article.link[state|destination=external]\");\n  color: resolve(\"article.link[state|disabled]\");\n  color: resolve(\"article[state|disabled] article.link\");\n}\n```\n\nNow, that's quite a lot of resolutions but a few things to note here, we're\nconflicting with a primary responsibility of the target class and its states\nin this case, so it stands to reason that we would have to do more work and\nthis may give us pause about whether it's appropriate to even have these\nstyles on the same element together.\n\nNote that selector query expressions with `resolve()` must handle\nglobal states by referencing the same global block locally and using it in\nthe selector query expression. It is not required for both blocks to use the\nsame local identifier for the block with the global state. Example:\n\n```css\n/* icons.block.css */\n@block article from \"./article.block.css\";\n@block app from \"./app.block.css\";\n.icon {\n  color: white;\n  color: resolve(\"app[state|is-loading] article.link\");\n}\n```\n\n#### Resolution Queries with Wildcards\n\nIn some cases, it may be appropriate to have resolution policies for\nconflicts that encompass multiple states. To handle this more elegantly it\nis possible to query selectors involving states with wildcard expressions.\n\nWhen using wildcard expressions, the same target selector may get resolved by\nseveral query expressions. In the case where a selector is both yielded and\noverridden, the more fully specified query will win.\n\nIn the following example we achieve the same resolution as above:\n\n```css\n/* icons.block.css */\n.icon {\n  color: resolve(\"article.link\");\n  color: resolve(\"article.link[state|destination=on-page]\");\n  color: white;\n  color: resolve(\"article.link[state|*]\");\n  color: resolve(\"article[state|disabled] article.link\");\n}\n```\n\nWildcard syntax:\n\n* `.*` - any class.\n* `[state|*]` - any state.\n* `[state|foo=*]` - any substate of state `foo`.\n* `[state?|*]` - any state or no state at all.\n* `[state?|foo=*]` - any substate of the state `foo` or no substate at all.\n\nWildcard examples:\n\n* `block.*` - All classes in the block `block`.\n* `block.class[state|*]` - All states for the class `class` (but not the class itself).\n* `block.class[state|foo=*]` - All substates for the specific state `foo`.\n* `block.class[state?|foo]` - The class as well the state `foo` if it exists.\n* `block.class[state?|*]` - The class as well as all states of the class.\n* `block[state|*] block.class` - The class but only when modified by any root-level state with any legal combinator(s).\n* `block[state?|*] block.class` - The class as well as when it is modified by any root-level state with any legal combinator(s).\n* `block[state?|*] block.class` - The class as well as when it is modified by any root-level state with any legal combinator(s).\n\nIn addition to wildcards, the `resolve-all()` function will resolve all\nstates relating to a block object as well as the object itself. If given a\nstate, the class for that state is not resolved, but all root-level state\nscopes of that state are resolved.\n\nExample:\n\n```css\n/* icons.block.css */\n@block article from \"./article.block.css\";\n.icon {\n  color: white;\n  color: resolve-all(\"article.link\");\n}\n```\n\nYou can think of resolve all as being a simpler way of writing\ncomplex state queries:\n\n`resolve-all()` | `resolve()` Equivalent\n----------------|-----------------------\n`resolve-all(\"block.class\")` | `resolve(\"[state?|*] block.class[state?|*]\")`\n`resolve-all(\"block.class[state|foo]\")` | `resolve(\"[state?|*] block.class[state|foo]\")`\n`resolve-all(\"block.*[state|foo]\")` | `resolve(\"block[state?|*] .*[state|foo]\")`\n`resolve-all(\"block.*\")` | `resolve(\"block[state?|*] block.*[state?|*]\")`\n\nNote that `resolve-all(\"block.*\")` essentially resolves all conflicts\nfor that property against every selector in the other block that might conflict.\nThis is the `!important` of css-blocks.\n\nNote that `resolve-all()` has the additional behavior of resolving against global\nstates from other blocks.\n\nIt is possible to combine resolutions with `resolve()` in combination with\n`resolve-all()` in order to specify a different resolution for a specific\nset of selectors. This is especially useful if a resolution encounters a\nresolution constraint that forces a yield instead of an override. So\nnow is probably a good time to learn what resolution constraints are...\n\n### Resolution Constraints\n\nSome properties are critical to proper functioning of the block. For\ninstance, if a block is using CSS grid to do layout, you'd expect the design\nto break if the block element's display property was resolved to a different\nvalue. Or perhaps there's a minimum width below which the design breaks.\n\nIn these situations, a block's selectors can provide constraints for a\nproperty that limit the legal overrides to ensure compatibility.\n\n ```css\n .icons {\n   display: grid;\n   display: constrain(--self);\n }\n ```\n\nThe `--self` identifier says that the property may only be resolved with one\nor more values that are set locally for that same property.\n\nYou can also list legal values that it can be resolved to, separated by a comma.\n\n ```css\n .icons {\n   border: 1px solid black;\n   border-style: constrain(--self, dashed, dotted);\n }\n ```\n\n As you can see from above, you can provide constraints on a long hand\n property to set a constraint on just one of the values in a short hand\n property that is specified. This would allow the border to be resolved\n arbitrarily for the `border-width` and `border-color` as long as the\n `border-style` is matches the constraint.\n\n ```css\n\n.column {\n   width: 300px;\n   width: constrain(range(200px, 400px));\n }\n ```\n\n TBD: syntax for range constraints and other possible constraint types.\n\n#### Progressive Enhancement\n\nWhen we use progressive enhancement we set the conflicting properties\n several times and let the browser pick up the one it understands.\n\n```css\n/* nav.block.css */\n.nav {\n  font-size: 18px;\n  font-size: 1.2rem;\n}\n```\n\nWe now resolve the target block object before our local values, causing our\nlocal values to take precedence.\n\n```css\n/* header.block.css */\n@block other from \"./other.css\";\n.header {\n  font-size: 16px;\n  font-size: 1rem;\n  font-size: resolve(\"other.nav\");\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, the compiler copies all the values for the conflicting\n property into the resolution selector:\n\n```css\n/* header.resolve-output.css */\n.conflicts__header { font-size: 16px; font-size: 1rem; }\n.other__nav.conflicts__header { font-size: 18px; font-size: 1.2rem; }\n```\n\n#### Overriding Wildcard Resolutions\n\nEarlier we said \"In the case where a selector is both yielded and\noverridden, the more fully specified query will win.\" and this was a bit\nhand-wavey. What does it mean for a query to be \"more specified\"?\n\n1. A query that has no wildcards is more fully-specified than a query with a\n   wildcard.\n2. A substate wildcard (`[state|foo=*]`) is more specified than a general\n   state wildcard (`[state|*]`).\n3. A state wildcard is more specified than an optional state wildcard of the\n   same type. E.g. `[state?|*]` loses to `[state|*]`, `[state?|foo=*]` loses\n   to `[state|foo=*]`.\n4. A class wildcard for a specific state is less well specified than a state\n   wildcard for a specific class. E.g. `.*[state|foo]` loses to `.foo[state|*]`\n   and to `.foo[state?|*]`\n5. A state wildcard on a specific class is more specified than a state\n   wildcard as context.\n6. A substate wildcard as context is more well specified than a\n   class wildcard with or without a state.\n\nTBD: We need to decide on a way to ascribe a numeric value or values for a query\nthat will allow queries to be compared. We should document that specific\ncalculation here.\n\n#### Multiple Conflicting Target Selectors and Context Selector Handling\n\nConsider the following conflicts when `target.main` and `conflicts.article` are applied to the same element:\n\n```css\n/* target.block.css */\n.main    { color: blue; }\n[state|hidden] .main { color: transparent; }\n```\n\n```css\n/* conflicts.block.css */\n@block target from \"./target.css\";\n[state|happy] .article {\n  color: green;\n  color: resolve(\"target.main\");\n}\n```\n\nWe now produce the following output:\n\n```css\n.conflicts--happy .conflicts__article { color: green; }\n.conflicts--happy .target__main.conflicts__article { color: blue; }\n.conflicts--happy.target--hidden .target__main.conflicts__article { color: transparent; }\n.target--hidden .conflicts--happy .target__main.conflicts__article { color: transparent; }\n.conflicts--happy .target--hidden .target__main.conflicts__article { color: transparent; }\n```\n\nResolving is relatively straight forward as long as only one selector has a\ncontext selector. When two selectors with context are resolved there is a\ncombinatorial explosion like we're accustomed to seeing the Sass's\n`@extend`. But it's important to remember that these selectors are\ntransitional and will be optimized away. They exist to provide a clean\nboundary between the optimizer and the block compiler, and to enable\ndebugging the optimizer by being able to turn it off and see if the\nspecificity based resolution disagrees with the optimized output in the\nbrowser.\n\n#### Block Inheritance and the Resolver\n\nInheritance sets up a very specific model of resolution where the sub-block\ntakes precedence over the base-block in any conflict. Since inheritance is\nimplemented as a multiple class abstraction in the template these look like\nconflicts to the template analyzer, which doesn't have any knowledge of what\na block is or what inheritance is. Also, since we can't guarantee the\nconcatenation order of these two blocks when the CSS is ultimately\ndelivered, the block compiler detects all style conflicts between the base\nand sub blocks and generates an override resolution in the sub-block for\nthem. However, the inheritance resolution does not override states conflicts,\nthat must be done by specifying the states in the inherited block.\n\nSpecifically for any property that has a conflict with the super block element\nof the same value in the key selector the following resolution is created:\n\n```css\n@block base from \"./base.block.css\";\n:scope { extends: base; }\n.foo {\n  color: resolve(\"base.foo\");\n  color: blue; // conflicts with color value(s) in a selector targeting base.foo\n  color: resolve-all(\"base.foo\");\n}\n```\n\n#### Composing blocks by the consuming app\n\nIf a third-party library failed to consider a composition, or if two\nthird-party libraries don't compose well, the app can provide it's own\ncomposition of the necessary styles as it's own class.\n\nFile: `navigation.block.scss`\n\n```scss\n@block super-grid-system from \"super-grid-system.block.css\";\n@block drop-down from \"drop-down.block.css\";\n\n.profile {\n  float: --unset;\n  float: resolve(\"super-grid-system.span\");\n\n  width: --unset;\n  width: resolve(\"super-grid-system.span\", \"drop-down.hoverable\");\n\n  margin: --unset;\n  margin: resolve(\"drop-down.hoverable\", \"super-grid-system.span\");\n}\n```\n\nThe `--unset` value means that the property won't be set in the output for that ruleset,\nbut it allows a resolution to be provided. When multiple resolution targets are specified\nto the resolve function, the first one wins, but the generated selectors will be created to\nresolve all three classes on the same element. This satisfies the optimizer and the silences\nthe conflict error.\n\n### Debugging a block\n\nOften you may have a reference to a block but aren't sure what block objects\nare in its public interface. The `@block-debug` @-rule allows you to\ninspect the block's names and also see what classnames they compile to.\n\nYou must also tell the debug statement where to output the information.\n\n`@block-debug <block-name> to (comment|stderr|stdout)`\n\nExample:\n\n```css\n@block icons from \"../../shared/styles/icons/dark.block.css\";\n@block-debug icons to comment;\n```\n\nThis might produce something like the following (when in BEM-compatible output mode):\n\n```css\n/* Source: shared/styles/icons/dark.block.css\n   Extends: shared/styles/icons/base.block.css\n   .root => .dark .base\n   [state|hoverable] => .base--hoverable\n   [state|shade=\"gray\"] => .dark--shade-gray\n   [state|shade=\"red\"] => .dark--shade-red\n   [state|shade=\"blue\"] => .dark--shade-blue\n   .icon => .dark__icon .base__icon\n   .new-file => .dark__new-file .base__new-file\n   .save-file => .dark__save-file .base__save-file\n   .rm-file => .dark__rm-file .base__rm-file */\n```\n\n### File Naming\n\nIt's convention to name files with a dual extension of `.block.css` (or with\nthe preprocessor extension of your choosing). This helps identify which CSS\nfiles are blocks and should be processed accordingly. CSS files that are not\nprocessed as blocks should not be optimized with the CSS block optimizer as\nit is likely to introduce cascade resolution problems.\n\nIt is also convention to use legal CSS identifiers for all aspects of the\nfile path that may be part of the natural name of the block in your specific\napplication or framework.\n\nWriting Optimizer-friendly CSS\n------------------------------\n\n1. CSS constructs that reduce the optimizer's effectiveness. Optimization\n   occurs within an optimization context based on a selector's @-rules, context selector,\n   and pseudo selectors. These constructs are often faster than javascript-based\n   equivalents, but in aggregate can reduce the overall optimization so use them\n   only when necessary.\n2. Explicit Resolution on a per-property basis is required for block objects\n   from several blocks that are used on the same html element.\n   See \"Block Composition\" below for more details.\n3. The tools for CSS Blocks generate a lot of classnames. The strategy that you use\n   for this can have a dramatic impact on binary compression algorithms. It is\n   recommended that you keep the default settings for class name generation\n   except for debugging.\n4. It's better to inherit a block to introduce a new static interface option for a\n   a block than it is to add a state to it. States are best for runtime behaviors.\n\nUsing With Preprocessors\n------------------------\n\nNote that people who prefer to use Sass can utilize it's features (or that of other CSS processors) to\nchange the source authoring. Here's our form example from above written with Sass:\n\n```scss\n$base-size: 1em;\n:scope {\n  block-name: my-form;\n  margin: 2 * $base-size 0;\n  padding: $base-size $base-size / 2;\n}\n\n[state|theme=light] {\n  color: #333;\n}\n\n[state|theme=dark] {\n  color: #ccc;\n}\n\n[state|compact] {\n  margin: $base-size / 2 0;\n  padding: $base-size / 2;\n}\n\n\n.input-area {\n  display: flex;\n  margin: $base-size 0;\n  font-size: 1.5rem;\n  [state|compact] & {\n    margin: $base-size / 4 0;\n  }\n}\n\n.label {\n  flex-basis: 1;\n}\n\n.input {\n  flex-basis: 3;\n  [state|theme=light] & {\n    border-color: #333;\n  }\n  [state|theme=dark] & {\n    border-color: #ccc;\n  }\n}\n\n.submit {\n  width: 200px;\n  &[state|disabled] {\n    color: gray;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nTemplate Integrations\n---------------------\n\n### JSX\n\nHelp\n\n### Ember/Glimmer (Handlebars)\n\nEach component has an associated `styles.block.css` file.\n\nThe template root element is automatically the block root.\n\n```hbs\n<form state:compact state:theme=\"light\">\n  <div class=\"input-area\">\n    <label class=\"label\">Username</label>\n    <input class=\"input\">\n  </div>\n  <submit class=\"submit\" state:disabled>\n</form>\n```\n\nBecause the output of CSS Blocks is always classnames, templates are\nrewritten during the build. Setting `state` attributes at runtime will\nhave no effect. If in BEM output mode, the above template is re-written to:\n\n```hbs\n<form class=\"my-form--compact my-form--theme-light\">\n  <div class=\"my-form__input-area\">\n    <label class=\"my-form__label\">Username</label>\n    <input class=\"my-form__input\">\n  </div>\n  <submit class=\"my-form__submit my-form__submit--disabled\">\n</form>\n```\n\n#### Composing styles from several blocks\n\nTo use styles from other blocks you must create a block reference in\nthe current component's styles:\n\n`my-component/styles.block.css`\n\n```css\n@block icons from \"../../shared/styles/icons/dark.block.css\";\n\n:scope {\n  border: 1px solid black;\n  overflow: auto;\n}\n\n.icon {\n  float: left;\n  width: 26px;\n  height: 26px;\n}\n```\n\n`my-component/template.hbs`\n\n```hbs\n<div class=\"icons:scope\" state:icons.hoverable state:icons.dark>\n  <div class=\"icon icons.new\">New File</div>\n  <div class=\"icon icons.save\">Save File</div>\n  <div class=\"icon icons.undo\">Undo</div>\n  <div class=\"icon icons.print\">Print</div>\n</div>\n```\n\nIn BEM output mode this would compile to:\n\n```hbs\n<div class=\"my-component icons icons--hoverable\">\n  <div class=\"my-component__icon icons__new\" >New File</div>\n  <div class=\"my-component__icon icons__save\">Save File</div>\n  <div class=\"my-component__icon icons__undo\">Undo</div>\n  <div class=\"my-component__icon icons__print\">Print</div>\n</div>\n```\n\n#### Dynamic styles\n\nIn order to return class names dynamically to the template that\nreference the styles in the stylesheet, you can import the styles\ndirectly and use the imported component.\n\nThe `block-select` helper is what enables you to set block styles\non a template dynamically. Because of the static analysis requirements\nof CSS blocks in templates, this helper is a little cumbersome to use.\nIt takes a helper expression and a list of block object expressions that might be returned\nfrom the helper. The helper should pass calls through one of the following methods:\n\n* `styles.classes(expression: string): Style[]` - Depending on the expression,\n  returns the CSS classes for a given state, class, or block. The\n  expression takes the form of a block object expression as defined in\n  the Syntax section above.\n\nTo return the styles of several elements together use the\n`cssBlocks.union(...expressions: (string | Style)[]): Style[]` method. This ensures that the\nclasses returned are correct, de-duplicated, resolved and legal to be used\ntogether, and can still provide hints correctly to the CSS optimizer.\n\n\n```ts\nimport Component from \"@glimmer/component\";\nimport { cssBlocks } from \"css-blocks\";\nimport styles from \"./styles.block.css\";\n\nexport default class MyForm extends Component {\n  get isDisabled()\n    return true;\n  }\n\n  get isCompact()\n    return true;\n  }\n\n  get username() {\n    return \"joeschmoe\";\n  }\n\n  @tracked(\"@args\")\n  get themeColor() {\n    // raises an error if @currentTheme isn't a state value for theme from the css file.\n    return this.args.currentTheme;\n  }\n\n  @tracked(\"isDisabled\")\n  get submitButtonClass() {\n    if (this.isDisabled) {\n      return cssBlocks.union(styles.classes('submit'),\n                             styles.classes('submit[state|disabled]'));\n    } else {\n      return styles.classes('submit');\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```hbs\n<form state:compact={{isCompact}}>\n  <div class=\"input-area\">\n    <label class=\"label\" for=\"username\">Username:</label>\n    <input type=\"text\" id=\"username\" class=\"input\" value={{username}}>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"input-area\">\n    <label class=\"label\" for=\"password\">Password:</label>\n    <input type=\"text\" id=\"password\" class=\"input\">\n  </div>\n  <submit class=\"submit\" state:disabled={{isDisabled}} disabled={{isDisabled}}>\n  <submit class={{block-select submitButtonClass \"submit\" \"submit[state|disabled]\"}}>\n</form>\n```\n\nDynamic states get their AST's re-written during template compilation to use\nprivate helpers similar to the block select helper. As noted in the section\n\"External Selectors\" below, any classnames that should be left alone in the\ntemplate and not considered part of the current block, must be declared\n`@external`.\n\n\n\nMedia Queries\n-------------\n\nTBD how media queries are handled.\n\nMulti-Stage Processing\n----------------------\n\nThe highly optimized output of CSS Blocks is only possible\nbecause it does its work in three stages:\n\n**Stage 1: Block Compilation.** Each block is compiled down to\n component-oriented CSS classes. Each component's styles are kept in their\n own CSS file.\n\n**Stage 2: Template analysis and rewriting.** Block specific markup is\n rewritten within the templates so that the CSS classes from stage 1 are used\n instead. Analysis is done to understand what CSS classes are used and what\n CSS classes happen to be applied to the same elements. Because there is no\n total ordering of the component CSS files, Errors are generated for style\n conflicts across different block files and must be resolved explicitly.\n\n**Stage 3: Optimization.** The constraints on the authoring of blocks, together with\n the template analysis and explicit resolution scheme, provides a highly\n optimizable framework for combining declarations safely. Unused classes are\n optimized out. A single class from a stylesheet may end up represented by\n as many classes as there are declarations in a ruleset.\n\n**Stage 4: Template Optimization.**\n These final class mappings are then rewritten back into the templates one last time.\n\n TODO: How to wire each stage into a build system.\n\n\nOptions\n-------\n\n* `outputMode`: type `cssBlocks.OutputMode`. Currently defaults to and\n  must be `cssBlocks.OutputMode.BEM`. Other output modes will be\n  defined soon.\n\nWIP: Detecting Unused Styles\n----------------------------\n\nTBD: It should be possible to detect unused styles and prune\nfrom the final build.\n\nWIP: Classname generation schemes\n---------------------------------\n\nThere are few techniques being considered to compress classes:\n\n0. *No compression*. Outputs standard BEM classes. This is good for when\n   porting an existing code base from BEM to CSS Blocks until all\n   templates can be updated.\n1. *Truncated hashing* (with hash collision detection) - Hashing the BEM\n   name is predictable and stable over time. The algorithm used above\n   is a base64 encoding with `+` and `/` removed, then selecting 10\n   bytes staring with the first non-numeric character. We then need\n   to ensure no hash collisions occur across blocks. Hash collisions\n   will be rare, but we would pre-allocate a few hundred hashes to be\n   used to resolve any any hash collisions we encounter. The collision\n   resolution must be stable across builds that do not introduce new\n   collisions.\n2. *Counter hashing*. Every time we need a new identifier we increment a\n   counter. This strategy works fine for within a single block. We don't\n   need to ensure cache consistency once a block changes. But we\n   must ensure uniqueness across all blocks. To this end, we would need to\n   set a maximum number of identifiers in a block so that we can reserve\n   higher order bits for counting files themselves in a stable way.\n   Addition of new files over time would cause larger than expected cache\n   invalidations unless we have a hand maintained file number for each\n   block file and even if files are added or removed we would keep the same\n   file number for blocks. This process can be automated by a script that\n   detects added or removed block files and updates the counters file\n   accordingly. In theory, this technique generates smaller output but\n   for additional developer complexity.\n3. *Localized*. This strategy would keep the local names for a block but\n   scope them with a unique identifier to avoid users being able to\n   predict the classnames while still preserving some developer\n   familiarity when reading the output. This might be best for\n   development mode.\n4. *Content hashing*. This strategy produces predictable classnames which\n   means that developers **could** abuse them if they wanted to.\n   However, this approach also means that class names can be de-duplicated\n   across files built separately in downstream processing and extracted to\n   a shared file. It also means that a custom brotli dictionary could be\n   produced that would allow the most common class names to be efficiently\n   compressed across templates and CSS files.\n\nUltimately, the project should support all of these compression\nstrategies and allow one to be selected via configuration.\n\n[bem]: http://getbem.com/\n"

Tilt too far in either direction and either your users or the developers\nwill end up paying the cost. With CSS Blocks, you can focus on making sure your\nstylesheets are easy to maintain as your application changes, and with the new\nCSS optimizer, [OptiCSS](https://github.com/linkedin/opticss), the small size of your\napp's production stylesheets after compression will amaze you.\n\nGone are the days where you spend several minutes debugging your app only to discover a subtle typo that caused a selector to not match – CSS Blocks will give you a build error and suggest possible fixes. With IDE integration, projects using CSS Blocks will be able to quickly navigate to selector definitions that match your current template element and find which template elements match your current selector, autocomplete class names. With CSS Blocks new resolution system, cascade conflicts will be caught for you before you even know they exist and you will never have to fight a specificity war ever again.\n\n![CSS Blocks Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7856443/39090683-78ca1966-459a-11e8-8128-f50a9b2a1810.jpg)\n\n> CSS Blocks is inspired by [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules), [BEM](http://getbem.com/) and [Atomic CSS](https://acss.io/)\n>\n> For a full deep-dive of the project architecture, I heavily recommend you review the [CSS Blocks Architecture README](./ARCHITECTURE.md)!\n\n# ⚙️ Supported Integrations\n\nCSS Blocks requires deep integration with your build system and templating language. To learn how to install css-blocks for in your application, please consult the specific docs for your templating system and build system.\n\nCSS Blocks is available for use in the following templating languages:\n\n - [JSX / React][JSX]\n - [Glimmer][GLIMMER]\n\nAnd has integrations with the following build systems:\n\n - [Webpack][WEBPACK]\n - [Broccoli][BROCCOLI]\n - [Ember-CLI][EMBER_CLI] (Glimmer Only)\n\n> Don't see your preferred platform yet?\n>\n> Learn how to make your own [Template Integration](./ARCHITECTURE.md#template-integrations) or [Build System Integration](./ARCHITECTURE.md#build-system-integrations) and contribute it back!\n\n# 🎁 API Features\n\nCSS Blocks is under active development and there are a number of features that have not yet been implemented! You can get a snapshot of the feature-set state here.\n\n> ✅ = Implemented  |  ❌ = Not Implemented  |  💀 = Deprecated  |  🖌 = In Proposal  |\n\n|**Status**| **Feature** | **Description** |\n|:--:|:--|:--|\n| **Selectors** ||\n| ✅ | `:scope` | Scope selector for component root. |\n| ✅ | `.class` | Class selectors for component sub-elements. |\n| ✅ | <code>.class[name]</code> | State that is applied to scope and class selectors on state existence. |\n| ✅ | <code>.class[name=\"value\"]</code> | Mutually exclusive sub-states for scope and class selectors to be applied when a sub-state value matches. |\n| ❌ | <code>[name=value]</code> | Bare state (not associated with an Originating Element) and optional substate selectors for targeting all elements in the Block that possess the state and/or sub-state. |\n| 🖌 | <code>.class[name=value default]</code> | Default state value to be applied when there is no other match. |\n| **At Rules** ||\n| ✅ | `@block local-name from \"./file/path.css\"` | Reference another Block using a local name. |\n| ✅ | `@block-debug block-name to channel` | Debug call that will print a block interface to a \"channel\": `comment`, `stderr`, or `stdout`. |\n| ✅ | `@block-global block.path` | Declare a Block class or state as public. It may be used as a context selector in other Blocks. |\n| **Properties** ||\n| ✅ | `block-name: \"custom-name\";` | Provide custom Block names in `:scope` for a nicer debugging experience. |\n| ✅ | `implements: block-name;` | A Block can declare that it implements one or more other Block's interfaces in its `:scope` selector and the compiler will ensure that all of those states and classes are styled locally. |\n| ✅ | `extends: block-name;` | A Block may specify it extends another Block in its `:scope` selector to inherit and extend all the class and state implementations therein. |\n| ✅ | `composes: \"block.path\";` | Mixin-Style class and state composition. Apply other Blocks' Styles to one of yours.  |\n| **Functions** ||\n| ✅ | `resolve(\"block.path\");` | Provide an explicit resolution for a given property against another Block. |\n| ❌ | `constrain(val1, val2 ... valN);` | Constrain this property to a list of specific values that may be set when this Block is extended. |\n| ❌ | `range(min, max);` | Constrain this property to a range of values that may be set when this Block is extended.  |\n\n# 🎨 What is a Block?\nA \"Block\" is an isolated stylesheet, written in its own file, that contains all rulesets for any elements, and their various modes and interaction states, for a discrete unit of styling – like a component or design pattern.\n\nTypically, a single Block will contain styles for a particular component or concept, but it is entirely natural – and encouraged – for a template to consume multiple blocks and compose them together in the markup.\n\nA Block file may contain:\n\n## The Scope Selector\nThe scope ruleset contains styles applied to the root of the scoped style subtree. All other elements assigned styles from a Block must be contained in the document subtree of an element assigned to the block's :scope. We use the special [`:scope` pseudo-class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:scope) to represent these styles.\n\nThe `:scope` selector may contain the special `block-name` property so you may provide your own Block name for easy debugging and BEM class generation. If no `block-name` is provided, we will infer the Block name from the file name.\n\n> 💡 **Feature Note: Block Names**\n>\n> If two Blocks in your project have the same name, CSS Blocks will automatically generate a unique, but still human-readable, name for BEM output mode.\n\n```css\n:scope {\n  block-name: custom-block-name;\n  /* 👆 optional! */\n  /* ... more styles ... */\n}\n```\n\n## Class Selectors\nBlocks may can contain other classes that may be applied to elements inside the scoped style sub-tree. These are just class selectors, but they are local to that Block and isolated from all other similarly named classes in other Blocks.\n\n```css\n.sub-element { /* ... */ }\n.other-sub-element { /* ... */ }\n```\n\nTogether, the `:scope` selector and all declared `.class` selectors define the full interface of stylable elements available to a Block's consumer.\n\n## State Selectors\nStates represent a mode or interaction state that the `:scope` or a class – called the state's **originating element** – may be in. States are written as attribute selectors with the special `state` namespace.\n\n```css\n:scope { /* ... */ }\n:scope[enabled] { /* ... */ }\n\n.sub-element { /* ... */ }\n.sub-element[is-active] { /* ... */ }\n```\n\n> **⁉️ What the pipe is going on here?**\n>\n> Once upon a time, developers fell in love with XML and thus was born xhtml, a flavor of HTML that allowed HTML elements to be mixed together with elements from other XML syntaxes like SVG and MathML. CSS went along for the ride and so, while many have never seen or used the feature, CSS has support for namespaced elements and attributes. In CSS, the `|` symbol is used to delimit between a namespace identifier (assigned by the `@namespace` at-rule) and the element or attribute name (also called a [qualified name](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-namespaces-3/#css-qualified-name)).\n>\n> In markup, instead of a pipe symbol, the colon is used to delimit a namespace identifier and a qualified name. Yes, this is confusing -- but we don't make CSS syntax, we just use it.\n\n## Sub-State Selectors\nStates on the `:scope` selector or a class selector may contain sub-states for more granular styling. Sub-states of a State are **mutually exclusive** and an element may only be in one sub-state of that state at any given time.\n\n```css\n:scope { /* ... */ }\n:scope[theme=\"inverse\"] { /* ... */ }\n\n.sub-element { /* ... */ }\n\n/* Applied for *any* value of `color`, including no value. */\n.sub-element[color] { /* ... */ }\n\n/* Applied for *specific* values of `color */\n.sub-element[color=\"red\"] { /* ... */ }\n.sub-element[color=\"blue\"] { /* ... */ }\n.sub-element[color=\"yellow\"] { /* ... */ }\n```\n\n## Its Just CSS!™️ (mostly)\n\nCSS Blocks implements a **strict subset of CSS**. This means we've intentionally restricted some of the features you're allowed to use in a Block file to ensure we can optimize your stylesheets as much as possible!\n\n> As Opticss improves, we may choose to loosen some of these restrictions – keep an eye out for syntax updates as we approach the `v1.0.0` release!\n\n### 🎉 That means you may freely use:\n\n - `::before`, `::after`, and [all other pseudo-elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements)\n - `:hover`, `:active`, and [all other pseudo-classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes),\n - `@media`, `@breakpoint`, and [all other `@at-rules`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/At-rule)\n - The **cascade** and **selector specificity**.\n - **Progressive enhancement** and **graceful degradation**.\n\n### 🚨 However:\n\n - `!important` is **forbidden** – you won't be needing it!\n - The `tag`, non-state `[attribute]`, `#id` and `*` selectors are **forbidden** (for now!)\n - The [Logical Combinators](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-4/#logical-combination) `:matches()`, `:not()`, `:something()` and `:has()` are **forbidden** (for now!)\n - Selectors must remain **shallow**.\n\nIn css-blocks, **shallow selectors** mean:\n\n#### 1) Only one [combinator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Combinators_and_multiple_selectors) per selector.\n\n```css\n/* ✅ Allowed! */\n:scope:hover > .my-class { /* ... */ }\n\n/* ❌ Illegal! */\n:scope:hover > .my-class + .my-class { /* ... */ }\n```\n\n#### 2) The Hierarchical Combinators' ([\" \"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Descendant_selectors) and \"[>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Child_selectors)\") context selector must be a `:scope` states, sub-states, or pseudo-classes.\n\n```css\n/* ✅ Allowed! */\n:scope:hover .my-class { /* ... */ }\n:scope[active] > .my-class { /* ... */ }\n:scope[color=red] .my-class { /* ... */ }\n\n/* ❌ Illegal! */\n.container:hover > .my-class { /* ... */ }\n.container[active] .my-class { /* ... */ }\n.container[color=red] .my-class { /* ... */ }\n```\n\n#### 3) The Sibling Combinators' (\"[+](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Adjacent_sibling_selectors)\", \"[~](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/General_sibling_selectors)\") context selector must target the **same class or `:scope`** used in the key selector.\n\n```css\n/* ✅ Allowed! */\n.my-class + .my-class { /* ... */ }\n.my-class:hover ~ .my-class { /* ... */ }\n.my-class[active] + .my-class { /* ... */ }\n\n/* ❌ Illegal! */\n:scope + .my-class { /* ... */ }\n.another-class:hover ~ .my-class { /* ... */ }\n.another-class[active] + .my-class { /* ... */ }\n```\n\n> 💡 **Feature Note: Global States and Selectors**\n>\n> \"Global States\" have their own rules on how they can be used in Block selectors! Keep an eye out for them a little later in this doc.\n\nOf course, because we statically analyze and compile all your code before it ever hits the browser, you will get a helpful error if any of these syntax restrictions are violated.\n\n## Blocks in Your Templates\nEvery specific template integration with css-blocks will have their own slightly unique syntax for how to interface with Block files. However, they all will allow you to apply classes and states in a way that is analyzable and rewritable at build time.\n\n> 💡 **Feature Note: Template Integrations**\n>\n> Each integration implements a slightly different API. Ex: JSX lets you `import` Block files, Ember looks for, through convention, a `stylesheet.css` alongside every component template. Check out the README for your template language for full details.\n\nHowever, whatever the implementation is, it will feel as though you're interfacing with regular CSS on the platform. For example, in Glimmer you just write the classes and states exactly as you would expect when working with a normal stylesheet:\n\n```css\n:scope { /* ... */ }\n:scope[enabled] { /* ... */ }\n.button { /* ... */ }\n.icon { /* ... */ }\n.icon[inverse] { /* ... */ }\n```\n\n```hbs\n{{!-- :scope selector is automagically applied to the template's root-level element. Thanks Glimmer! --}}\n<section block:enabled={{isEnabled}}>\n  <button block:class=\"button\">\n    <div block:class=\"icon\" block:inverse={{isInverse}}></div>\n    {{value}}\n  </button>\n</section>\n```\n\nThere are only two (2) common-sense rules to follow when using Block styles in your template:\n\n 1. You **may not** use a Block class outside of it's `:scope`'s subtree.\n 2. Two classes *from the same Block* **may not** be applied to the same HTML element.\n\n# 🏗 Block Composition\nBlocks styles are, by design, scoped to the file they are written in, but we all know that in a real app your styles can't live in a vacuum!\n\nAs you'll see below, there are many methods to compose blocks together in your application. However, most of these methods will begin with the humble `@block`.\n\n## Block References\nA Block may declare a dependency on another Block by using a `@block` at the top of your file. A `@block` creates a locally scoped alias where you can access the public API (declared classes and states) of the referenced block.\n\nBlock references don't cause any styles to be included. Instead, they are like an ES6 `import` statement -- they make it possible to refer to the public interface of another Block from within the current Block.\n\nAdding a `@block` is as simple as this:\n\n```css\n/* block-1.block.css */\n:scope { block-name: block-1; }\n.my-class { /* ... */ }\n.my-class[my-state] { /* ... */ }\n```\n\n```css\n/* block-2.block.css */\n@block other-block from \"./block-1.block.css\";\n\n:scope { block-name: block-2; }\n```\n\n> 🔮 **Future Feature: Node Modules Block Resolution**\n>\n> Whether you're integrating with a 3rd party library, or pulling in dependencies internal to your company, at some point you'll want to integrate with styles delivered via NPM! The resolution logic for `@block`s to `node_modules` hasn't yet been implemented yet, but you can track progress (or even help out!) [over on Github](https://github.com/linkedin/css-blocks/issues/112).\n\nWith the above code, `block-2` now has a local reference `other-block` which points to `block-1`. We can now freely use the `other-block` identifier inside of `block-2` when we want to reference reference `block-1`. This comes in handy! Especially with features like:\n\n# Object Oriented Features of Blocks\n\n## Block Implementation\nA Block's public interface is defined by the states and classes it styles. A block may declare that it implements one or more other referenced blocks' interfaces, and the compiler will ensure that all the states and classes it defines are also in the implementing block. In this way, the compiler can guarantee it is safe to use different blocks to style the same markup in a component.\n\nYou do this via the special `implements` property in a Block's `:scope` selector:\n\n```css\n/* block-1.block.css */\n:scope { block-name: block-1; }\n.my-class { /* ... */ }\n.my-class[my-state] { /* ... */ }\n```\n\n```css\n/* block-2.block.css */\n@block other-block from \"./block-1.block.css\";\n\n:scope {\n  block-name: block-2;\n  implements: other-block;\n}\n```\n\n> 💡 **Feature Note: Implements Property**\n>\n> The `implements` property is only available in the `:scope` selector. If you use it in any other selector, it will be ignored.\n\nHowever, the above code will throw an error at build time!\n\n```bash\n$ Error: Missing implementations for .my-class, .my-class[my-state] from ./block-1.block.css\n```\n\nFor the build to pass, we need to implement the *full public interface* of `block-1` in `block-2`:\n\n```css\n/* block-2.block.css */\n@block other-block from \"./block-1.block.css\";\n\n:scope {\n  block-name: block-2;\n  implements: other-block;\n}\n.my-class { /* ... */ }\n.my-class[my-state] { /* ... */ }\n```\n\n### Block Inheritance\n\nA Block may also choose to extend another referenced Block. This exposes all declared styles from the extended Block on the extending Block.\n\nThose inherited styles may then be used in a template by accessing them on the extending block, and can even be augmented by re-declaring the styles in the extending block!\n\nYou do this via the special `extends` property in a Block's `:scope` selector.\n\nLets say we have a component called `<basic-form>`. Basic forms have an input element, and a big green button. Simple enough:\n\n```css\n/* basic-form.block.css */\n.button {\n  font-size: 1.4rem;\n  color: white;\n  background-color: green;\n}\n.button[disabled] {\n  color: #333;\n  background-color: lightgray;\n}\n.input { font-weight: bold }\n```\n\nBut, as the project evolves we realize we need a new form for submitting information for a dangerous action, we're asked to create a new kind of form called `<danger-form>`. Danger forms look and function exactly the same as a basic form, except the button and labels are red. We *could* re-implement the entire stylesheet to create `<danger-form>`, but that would be a such a waste of all the hard work we already put in to `<basic-form>`!\n\nInstead, we can simply extend the `<basic-form>` Block, and only apply the small style changes we need:\n\n```css\n/* danger-form.block.css */\n@block basic-form from \"./basic-form.block.css\";\n\n:scope  { extends: basic-form; }\n.button { background-color: darkred; }\n.label  { color: darkred; }\n```\n\nDuring rewrite, references to an inherited style will translate into the class(es) for the\ndirectly referenced style as well as all the classes that it inherits from so developers do\nnot need to bring the complexity of the inheritance relationship into their templates.\nFor example, a reference to `danger-form.button` would result in adding both `.basic-form__button`,\nas well as `.danger-form__button` to the element's list of classes.\n\nWhen the blocks are compiled, property overrides are detected and automatically resolved.\nThe selectors generated serve two purposes:\n\n1. Concatenation order independence - Once compiled, a CSS block file can be\n   concatenated in any order with other compiled block output.\n2. Optimization hints - Normally, if there are selectors with the same\n   specificity that set same property to different values on the same element,\n   the optimizer would take care not to merge those declarations such that it\n   might cause a cascade resolution change. But the selectors in the output from\n   CSS Blocks allows OptiCSS to merge declarations more aggressively, because it\n   can prove that it knows the value of those selectors when combined.\n\n```css\n.basic-form__button { font-size: 1.4rem; color: white; background-color: green; }\n.basic-form__button--disabled { color: #333; background-color: lightgray; }\n.basic-form__input { font-weight: bold; }\n.danger-form__button { background-color: darkred; }\n.basic-form__button.danger-form__button { background-color: darkred; }\n.danger-form__button--disabled { background-color: #957d7d; }\n.basic-form__button.danger-form__button--disabled { background-color: #957d7d; }\n.basic-form__button--disabled.danger-form__button--disabled { background-color: #957d7d; }\n.danger-form__label { color: darkred; }\n```\n\nWhile this output is highly repetitive and may seem excessive, it's exactly the kind of repetition\nthat OptiCSS is designed to search for and remove. From an authoring experience and in production,\nit's a laser-focused override with no performance impact.\n\n> 💡 **Feature Note: Extends Property**\n>\n> The `extends` property is only available in the `:scope` selector. If you use it in any other selector, it will be ignored.\n\nAn extending block is able to re-define any property on any style it inherits from. CSS declarations defined in the extending Block will **always** take priority over the definitions inherited by the same named Style in the base Block.\n\n> 🔮 **Future Feature: Extension Constraints**\n>\n> Sometimes, properties inside of a component are **so** important, that authors may want to constrain the values that extenders and implementors are able to set. In the near future, css-blocks will enable this use case through the custom `constrain()` and `range()` CSS functions and possibly through other ideas like [custom constraints and conflicts](https://github.com/linkedin/css-blocks/issues/51). You can come help out over on Github to make this happen faster!\n\n# Style Composition\n\n## Block Paths\nAs your Blocks begin interacting with each other in increasingly complex ways, you will find yourself needing to reference specific classes or states on another Block, as you'll see later in this document. You do this using a small query syntax called a [Block Path](./packages/css-blocks/src/BlockSyntax/BlockPath.ts).\n\nBlock Paths take the form:\n\n```\nblock.class[name='value']\n```\n\nAll sections of this selector – except the leading Block name – are optional. The leading Block name *must* refer to an imported `@block` at the top of the file. If css-blocks is unable to resolve a Block Path at build time, you will get a friendly error message in your console!\n\nAll the following syntaxes are legal to select any given stylable on a referenced Block:\n\n|Stylable|Syntax|\n|:--|:--|\n|Scope|`block`|\n|Scope State|<code>block[name]</code>|\n|Scope Sub-State|<code>block[name=value]</code>|\n|Class|`block.class`|\n|Class State|<code>block.class[name]</code>|\n|Class Sub-State|<code>block.class[name=value]</code>|\n\n> 🔮 **Future Feature: Block Path Wildcards**\n>\n> In some situations, you may want to select multiple classes, states or sub-states on a referenced block. In the near future you will be able to do so with a wildcard syntax: `block.*`, `block.class[*]`, `block.class[name=*]`. Feel free to track progress of this feature [here]()\n\n## Composition in Templates\nEvery template integration will provide a way to use more than one Block inside of a template. The syntax for this may change depending on your templating system, so please check with your specific template integration's documentation.\n\nFor Glimmer, using multiple blocks in a single template will look something like this:\n\n```css\n/* hoverable.css */\n:scope {\n  block-name: hoverable;\n  box-shadow: 0 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);\n  transition: box-shadow .28s;\n}\n:scope:hover {\n  box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)\n}\n.button {\n  background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, .5);\n  color: black;\n  transition: background-color .28s;\n}\n:scope:hover .button {\n  background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1);\n}\n```\n\n```css\n/* stylesheet.css */\n@block other from \"./hoverable.css\";\n\n:scope { block-name: main; }\n.form {\n  border: 1px solid gray;\n  border-radius: 2px;\n  padding: 16px;\n}\n.button {\n  background-color: green;\n  color: white;\n  height: 32px;\n  width: 100%;\n}\n```\n\n```hbs\n{{!-- :scope selector from `stylesheet.css` is automagically applied to the template's wrapper element. Thanks Glimmer! --}}\n<section>\n  <form class=\"form other\">\n    <button class=\"button other.button\">Click Me!</button>\n  </form>\n</section>\n```\n\nAbove we have a simple template that contains a form with a single button that says \"Click Me!\". We style it with styles from the default Block for the template, `stylesheet.css`, and with styles from the referenced Block `hoverable.css`, referenced in this context as `other`.\n\nIn this template, we have the `<form>` element assigned the scoped root for `other`, and we apply the `button` class from both blocks to the `<button>` element.\n\nBut wait! If you try and run the css-blocks build with this code, you'd find an error in your console!\n\n```bash\nThe following property conflicts must be resolved for these co-located Styles: (template.hbs:4:19)\n\n          color:\n            main.button (stylesheet.css:12:2)\n            hoverable.button (hoverable.css:12:2)\n\n          background-color:\n            main.button (stylesheet.css:11:2)\n            hoverable.button (hoverable.css:11:2)\n```\n\nWoah, what does this mean?! Well, if we stop and think for a second about what we just asked css-blocks to do, we'll realize that this error makes perfect sense.\n\nBecause Blocks have their own entirely independently scoped cascades, and right now no Block file is aware of any other Block's styles, css-blocks doesn't inherently know which Block should take priority over another when used together.\n\nSo, when css-blocks was asked to put the `.button` class from both the default template stylesheet, and from `hoverable` onto the same element, it noticed that both classes are claiming to set the `color` and `background-color` properties – and with this we have encountered our first **Indeterminate Cascade Resolution**.\n\nWhich Block should win in this situation? Right now, the compiler has no idea. To answer that, css-blocks needs a little help from you. We are able to provide explicit cross-Block cascade resolutions to the compiler by using `resolve()`. Lets learn how we can fix our above error by moving on to the next section: **Block Resolutions**.\n\n## Block Resolutions\nThe special `resolve()` function provides explicit resolution guidance for properties that are in conflict across two or more Block files. They look like any other property declaration:\n\n```css\nselector {\n  property-name: resolve(\"<block-path>\");\n}\n```\n\nYou will be asked by the css-blocks compiler to add resolutions if and when two styles are found on the same element in your templates that attempt to set the same CSS property.\n\nResolve declarations work just like progressive enhancement and graceful degradation! The last declaration defined in the ruleset will win. This means that declaration order matters. There are two ways to resolve any given property:\n\n### Override Resolution\nOverride resolutions tell css-blocks that when these two styles  are used together, we want this Block to **override** the value of the other Style's property.\n\nHere, we tell css-blocks to use the `color` value from `my-class` instead of `other.selector` when both styles are applied to the same element:\n\n```css\n.my-class {\n  color: resolve(\"other.selector\");\n  color: red;\n}\n```\n\n### Yield Resolution\nYield resolutions tell css-blocks that when these two styles  are used together, we want this Block to **yield** to the value of the other Style's property.\n\nHere, we tell css-blocks to use the `color` value from `other.selector` instead of `my-selector` when both styles are applied to the same element:\n\n```css\n.my-class {\n  color: red;\n  color: resolve(\"other.selector\");\n}\n```\n\n> 🔮 **Future Feature: Resolve All Shorthand**\n>\n> For straightforward resolutions where you just want to yield or assume full control of styling against another block, feel free to use the CSS `all` property to quickly override or yield to all property conflict with another block. The downside of doing this is that as new properties are added to another element, you don't get a chance to review them and decide:\n\n```css\n.my-class {\n  color: red;\n  background: blue;\n\n  /* Yields all conflicts to `other.selector` */\n  all: resolve(\"other.selector\");\n}\n```\n\n> 💡 **Feature Note: Advanced Property Conflicts**\n>\n> The css-blocks compiler is smart! If you have dynamic classes or states in your template, it will ask you to provide explicit resolutions between Blocks that even only have a *chance* of being used together on the same element. This way, we can guarantee that your styles will work regardless of the state your application may find itself it.\n>\n> Css Blocks is also aware of CSS shorthands and will ask you to resolve the lowest common denominator on conflicting shorthand/longhand expressions as well.\n\nSo, continuing with the example from the previous section –  **Composition in Templates** – we can satisfy the css-blocks compiler by adding in two explicit resolutions for `color` and `background-color` like so:\n\n```css\n/* stylesheet.css */\n/* ... */\n\n.button {\n  /* Override Resolution */\n  background-color: resolve(\"hoverable.button\");\n  background-color: green;\n\n  /* Override Resolution */\n  color: resolve(\"hoverable.button\");\n  color: white;\n\n  /* ... */\n}\n```\n\nHere we have told css-blocks that when our component's `.button` class is used with hoverable's `.button` class, we want our component's style declarations to win! We have declared an **override resolution** for both properties.\n\nIf we were to switch around the order a bit so our `background-color` resolution comes *after* our component's declaration, it means that when these two classes are used together, hoverable's `.button` class will win, but only for that property. This is why you will never have to fight the cascade or use `!important` ever again!\n\n```css\n/* stylesheet.css */\n/* ... */\n\n.button {\n  /* Yield Resolution */\n  background-color: green;\n  background-color: resolve(\"hoverable.button\");\n\n  /* Override Resolution */\n  color: resolve(\"hoverable.button\");\n  color: white;\n\n  /* ... */\n}\n```\n\n> 💡 **Feature Note: States and Pseudo-Classes**\n>\n> **States** and **Pseudo-Classes** inherit **all**  resolutions set on their containing **Class** or `:scope`.\n>\n> This means that in the above example, where we **yield** for `background-color`, and **override** for `color`, the button element where both classes are used will still use `hoverable.button:hover`'s `background-color`, but it's color will remain `white`, like our component styles define!\n\n### Resolving Pseudo Elements\nIt is important to note that **Pseudo-Elements** do not inherit any resolutions from their container class and must be explicitly resolved in the source stylesheets when found to be in conflict.\n\nSo, for the following two Blocks where `my-class-1[enabled]` and `my-class-2` are used on the same element, one of the Blocks will need to resolve the conflicting `border-width` property:\n\n```css\n/* other */\n\n.my-class-1[enabled]::before {\n  border: 1px solid red;\n}\n```\n\n```css\n/* main.css */\n\n@block other from \"./other.css\";\n\n.my-class-2::before {\n  border-width: 2px;\n  border-width: resolve(\"other.my-class-2[enabled]\");\n}\n```\n\n## External Selectors\nSometime a class, identifier, or tag name comes from an external source, and the only thing you can do is use them as is. In these situations the Block must declare all external simple selectors it intendeds to use. These simple selectors may then be used as key selectors inside this Block. You'll get an error for any declared external selectors that aren't used or if they are used in the context selector.\n\nStyles targeting an external selector are not rewritten and their declarations cannot be optimized! Style collisions\non an external selector are not detected or resolved. As a result, it is allowed to use `!important` on declarations targeting an external selector.\n\nWarning: If external selectors and CSS block objects both target the same HTML element in their key selectors you will get unpredictable results. It's best to avoid this.\n\n```css\n@external h2.some-rando-class;\n\n.foo h2.some-rando-class {\n  font-size: 32px !important;\n}\n```\n\n\n## Global States\n\nIn rare occasions, a Block may choose to declare declare that a certain State is **global**. These states are special in that they can be used in other Blocks like they are local to that block.\n\nThis is most useful for global application states – like during initial application boot, or when a modal is displayed.\n\n> ⚙️ **Performance Note: Global States**\n>\n> When you apply classes and other attributes to elements like `<html>` or `<body>` it invalidates a lot of internal caches in the browser. It is still often a performance win compared to querying the document in javascript and applying classes on many elements.\n\n```css\n/* application.block.css */\n\n@block-global [is-loading];\n@block-global [is-saving];\n```\n\n```css\n/* navigation.block.css */\n\n@block app from \"application.block.css\";\n\n/* Gray out signout button when app is saving */\n:scope[app|is-saving] .signout {\n  color: gray;\n  pointer-events: none;\n}\n\n/* Animate the logo when app is loading data */\n:scope[app|is-loading] .logo {\n  animation-name: bounce;\n}\n```\n\n[CORE]: ./packages/@css-blocks/css-blocks\n[RUNTIME]: ./packages/@css-blocks/runtime\n[JSX]: ./packages/@css-blocks/jsx\n[GLIMMER]: ./packages/@css-blocks/glimmer\n[EMBER_CLI]: ./packages/@css-blocks/ember-cli\n[WEBPACK]: ./packages/@css-blocks/webpack\n[BROCCOLI]: ./packages/@css-blocks/broccoli\n[WEBSITE]: ./packages/@css-blocks/website\n"
