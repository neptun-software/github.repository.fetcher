Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.\n\n## Enforcement\n\nInstances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting us through adminjs@adminjs.co. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.\n\nProject maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.\n\nIf you are unsure whether an incident is a violation, or whether the space where the incident took place is covered by our Code of Conduct, **we encourage you to still report it**. We would prefer to have a few extra reports where we decide to take no action, than to leave an incident go unnoticed and unresolved that may result in an individual or group to feel like they can no longer participate in the community. Reports deemed as not a violation will also allow us to improve our Code of Conduct and processes surrounding it. If you witness a dangerous situation or someone in distress, we encourage you to report even if you are only an observer.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage], version 1.4, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html\n"

          "content": "# AdminJS Development\n\n## Explanation of AdminJS libraries\nThere are three main terms we use to define AdminJS libraries, which are:\n\n* Core - the main library, containing basically all the logic which you can find in `adminjs` repository\n* Plugin - plugins are wrappers around popular frameworks which allow you to connect AdminJS to your Node.js server and build AdminJS-specific routes. For example `@adminjs/express`.\n* Adapter - adapters are wrappers around supported ORMs and ODMs. They export classes which extend `BaseDatabase`, `BaseResource` and `BaseProperty` components. Their task is to translate AdminJS specific filters/queries to something understandable by your ORM/ODM of choice in order to communicate with the database. For example `@adminjs/typeorm`.\n\nAdminJS also has got it's own design system library (`@adminjs/design-system`) and a set of premade `features` which you can import into your project (e. g. `@adminjs/passwords`).\n\n## Contributing\n\n### Development\nIf you want to contribute to the project, fork repositories you will be working on and after you're done with your changes, open a pull request.\n\nAdminJS team uses [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) library to automatically create `releases` when a pull request is merged to `master` branch or `pre-releases` when a pull request is merged to `beta` branch. Additionally, based on your commit messages, the library automatically generates a changelog.\n\nBecause of this, there is a strict requirement on how you should name your `branches` and `commits`.\n\nBranch names should be prefixed with `fix/`, `chore/`, `feat/` or `test/`.\n\nCommit messages should start with `fix:`, `chore:`, `feat:`, `test:` with the following rules:\n1. When a commit starting with `chore:` or `test:` is merged, it **will not** create a new release.\n2. When a commit starting with `fix:` is merged, a release will be created which upgrades the patch version of the library (example: 6.0.0 -> 6.0.1).\n3. When a commit starting with `feat:` is merged, a release will be created which upgrades the minor version of the library (example: 6.0.1 -> 6.1.0).\n4. When a commit has `BREAKING CHANGE: xxxxx` inside of it's **description**, a release will be created which upgrades the major version of the library (example: 6.1.0 -> 7.0.0).\n5. There are also additional rules defined in `.releaserc`:\n- commits starting with `feat(locale):` and `feat(small):` will only upgrade the patch version despite being `feat` (feature) commits. This type of commit message should be used when you want to create a new translation (`feat(locale)`) or when you add a small feature that doesn't affect the library much (`feat(small)`).\n- commits starting with `chore(deps):` will upgrade the patch version despite being `chore` commits. These are commits automatically created by [dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot) but you should also use this message type when you want to only upgrade a package manually.\n6. When a pull request is merged which contains multiple commit messages, the higher version upgrades take precedence, for example a pull request with `feat:` and `fix:` messages will upgrade the `minor version` (because of `feat: ...` message) but both commit messages will appear in the changelog.\n\nWhen you work on your bug fixes or new features, make sure they only concern the subject of your pull request. Ideally you would be using `git commit --amend` so that there's only one commit in your pull request.\nIf for some reason you want to make more than one change and you need to have multiple commit messages in a pull request, each commit message should only contain changes it refers to.\n\nWhen a pull request contains a lot of commits without proper messages, we usually `squash` them when merging which can result in a poor release changelog.\n\n### Issues\nWhen creating an issue please try to describe your problem with as many details as possible. If your issue is a complex one and would require us to reproduce this to respond, a test repository or a code sample which would allow us to reproduce your problem would be ideal.\nIf possible, try to create issues by using our issues templates.\n\n### Translations\n\nYou can contribute translations via the [fink localization editor](https://fink.inlang.com/github.com/SoftwareBrothers/adminjs).\n\n[![inlang status badge](https://badge.inlang.com/?url=github.com/SoftwareBrothers/adminjs)](https://fink.inlang.com/github.com/SoftwareBrothers/adminjs?ref=badge)\n\n## Developing locally\n\n### Basic example\nTo see your changes in your local environment you will, first of all, need a test application. You can clone our [example app](https://github.com/SoftwareBrothers/adminjs-example-app) or create your own.\n\nNext, open terminal in your `adminjs` fork repository, install dependencies and run commands:\n```bash\n$ yarn dev\n$ yarn bundle:globals # re-run it only after you install new dependencies\n```\nAfter this, run:\n```bash\n$ yarn link\n```\nto register `adminjs` under yarn's linked packages.\n\nNow open terminal in your test application's project and link your local `adminjs` package:\n```bash\n$ yarn link \"adminjs\"\n```\nYou should be able to see your local changes to `adminjs` package in your test application. However, you might have to restart your test application each time you make changes to `adminjs` local package.\n\n### Advanced example\n\nThe case described above is the easiest one. Now let's assume you want to make changes to `@adminjs/design-system` package. This will require you to chain `yarn link` commands:\n\n1. Fork and clone `adminjs-design-system` repository\n2. Install dependencies of `adminjs-design-system` and run `yarn dev`\n3. Register `@adminjs/design-system` under yarn's linked packages: `yarn link`\n4. Since `@adminjs/design-system` is a dependency of `adminjs`, open `adminjs` project locally and run:\n```bash\n$ yarn link \"@adminjs/design-system\"\n```\nand rebuild it.\n5. Run `yarn link` to register `adminjs` under yarn's linked packages (if you haven't done it before).\n6. Link `adminjs` package in your test application:\n```bash\n$ yarn link \"adminjs\"\n```\n\nIf you try to run your test application now, it should build fine, but you might see some errors when you try to open admin panel in your browser concerning multiple React instances.\nThis error occurs because when you install repository's dependencies locally, it will install all of them, meaning you will have `react` installed in your `adminjs-design-system` and `adminjs` folders but you may have only one React instance at a time. The easiest way to solve this would be to use a linked `react` package:\n1. In your test application, run:\n```bash\n$ yarn add react@^18.1.0 react-dom@^18.1.0 styled-components@^5.3.5\n```\nWe're also installing `react-dom` and `styled-components` because these two libraries also cause similar issues to `react`.\n2. Navigate to installed `react`, `react-dom` and `styled-components` and register them under yarn linked packages:\n```bash\n$ cd node_modules/react && yarn link\n$ cd ../../node_modules/react-dom && yarn link\n$ cd ../../node_modules/react-i18next && yarn link\n$ cd ../../node_modules/styled-components && yarn link\n```\n3. Now link those packages in your local `adminjs` and `adminjs-design-system` projects:\n```bash\n$ yarn link \"react\"\n$ yarn link \"react-dom\"\n$ yarn link \"react-i18next\"\n$ yarn link \"styled-components\"\n```\n4. Your test application should now be working.\n\nHaving lots of registered packages can bring confusion, you can use the command below to find out which packages you have linked and where they are used:\n```bash\n$ ls -la ~/.config/yarn/link/\n```\n\n`yarn link` documentation: https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/link\n\n### Alternative to yarn link\nThe alternative to `yarn link` is to clone our [adminjs-dev](https://github.com/SoftwareBrothers/adminjs-dev) repository. This repository has all AdminJS packages added as submodules in one [yarn workspace](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/). The repository's README should be detailed enough to get you started.\n\nPlease note that using `yarn workspaces` also has it's issues that we haven't yet resolved. One of them is that all submodules dependencies are installed in the top level (in the root directory of `adminjs-dev`) and installing or updating any new dependency in for example `packages/adminjs` won't update it's `yarn.lock` file and you have to do it manually.\nThe upside is that you don't have to deal with `yarn link` dependency issues plus you're able to see your local changes in other submodules in the same workspace immediately.\n"

You, as a developer, provide database models (like posts, comments, stores, products or whatever else your application uses), and AdminJS generates UI which allows you (or other trusted users) to manage content.\n\nInspired by: [django admin](https://docs.djangoproject.com), [rails admin](https://github.com/sferik/rails_admin) and [active admin](https://activeadmin.info/).\n\n## Example application\n\nCheck out our demo application:\n\n- Login: `admin@example.com`\n- Password: `password`\n\nhttps://demo.adminjs.co\n\nYou can also have a look at our customized AdminJS dashboard which shows various library statistics:\n\nhttps://stats.adminjs.co\n\n## Getting started\n\n- Check out the [documentation](https://docs.adminjs.co)\n- Try the [live demo](https://demo.adminjs.co) as mentioned above\n\n## Our open source community on Discord\n\n- [Join the community](https://adminjs.page.link/discord) to get help and be inspired.\n\n# What kind of problems it solves\n\nSo you have a working service built in Node.js. It uses (for example) [Hapi.js](https://hapijs.com/) for rendering a couple of REST routes and [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) as the _connector_ to the database.\n\nEverything works fine, but now you would like to:\n* view all the data in the app,\n* perform custom _business_ actions on objects in the database,\n* bootstrap the tables with the _initial_ data,\n* build custom report pages,\n* allow other team members (not necessary programmers) to see what is going on in the application.\n\nAnd all these cases can be solved by AdminJS. By adding couple of lines of code you have a running admin interface.\n\n# Features\n\n* CRUD any data in any resource\n* Custom actions\n* Form validation based on schema in your resources\n* Full featured dashboard with widgets\n* Custom resource decorators\n\n## Contribute\n\nIf you would like work on an AdminJS and develop new features please check out our [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/SoftwareBrothers/adminjs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\nThere you can find instructions on how to run AdminJS locally for development.\n\nIf you're searching for tasks you can contribute to, we currently accept contributions to issues in our [Kanban Board](https://github.com/orgs/SoftwareBrothers/projects/5/views/1).\n\nAny small or large contribution or any input into discussion is welcome!\n\n## License\n\nAdminJS is copyrighted © 2023 rst.software.

          "content": "# Migration guide to version v6\n\n## Updating AdminJS to v6\n\nTo update AdminJS package to the sixth wersion please use following npm command\n\n```\nnpm install adminjs\n```\n\nThis should update the version of ```adminjs``` and ```adminjs-design-system``` packages to newest beta versions. \n\nIf you have ```adminjs-design-system``` in your dependencies you should update it accordingly.\n\n## Changes\n\n### :warning: React upgrade to v18.1.0+\n\n**If you don't have react as a dependency in your project you won't have to do anything 😉**\n\nAdminJS now uses ```react``` and ```react-dom``` in ```v18.1.0+``` as a dependency. Hence if you're using react outside of AdminJS, please upgrade it to the matching version. \nInstructions on how to do it are available [here](https://reactjs.org/blog/2022/03/08/react-18-upgrade-guide.html)\n\nAdditionally, we upgraded the ```styled-components``` package to ```v5.3.5```, which works well with react v18. \n\n### :warning: Rebranding\n\nBranding option `softwareBrothers` is now not supported and replaced with `withMadeWithLove`\nwhich shows a tiny heart icon on the bottom sidebar and login page.\n\n### ⚠️ New RichText input library\n\nDue to security and support issues, richText implementation has changed from Quill to TipTap. Therefore, in AdminJS v6, **all quill-related configurations will no longer be valid.**\n\n### :white_check_mark: Phone and currency inputs\n\nAdminJS gained two new input types. To use phone and currency inputs, use them as a type in your resource option.\n\n**Example of use**\n\n```ts\nconst TransactionResource: ResourceWithOptions = {\n  resource: Transaction,\n  options: {\n    properties: {\n      price: {\n        type: 'currency',\n      },\n      phone: {\n        type: 'phone',\n      },\n    },\n    navigation: {\n      name: 'App',\n      icon: 'Settings',\n    }\n  }\n};\n```\n\n### :white_check_mark: Select component available in ```adminjs-design-system```\n\nThe select component was extracted from the core package to ```adminjs-design-system```. You no longer need to implement such a component on your own. \n"
