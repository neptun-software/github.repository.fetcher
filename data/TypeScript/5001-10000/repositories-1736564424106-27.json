Amplify codifies best practices through programmatic interfaces to help you effortlessly interact with cloud resources.\n\nFirst and foremost Amplify exposes to you WHAT things do and then HOW best to do them. The WHAT is at a functional use case with HOW being an opinionated implementation that you can override with “escape hatches.” This will allow you to have higher velocity and build better applications by focusing less on implementation choices. Secondly, Amplify should be a manifestation of The Rule of Least Power when developing against AWS. This means it encourages architectural and programmatic best practices and the ability to start quickly. This shows by encouraging certain services (API Gateway usage vs. direct DynamoDB interaction) or certain connection patterns (Circuit breaker, retry counts and throttle up/down).\n\nOpinionated implementations: There are many ways to interface with AWS Services. Certain service interactions are favored over others. For instance, if sending and receiving JSON, we would prefer an API Gateway endpoint to other mechanisms. Amplify will programmatically help optimize for cost and performance through library decisions.\n\nDeclarative actions: Amplify will provide you a reference to a generic client object and the ability to perform common actions. “RegisterUser”, “Login”, “SendObject”, “UpdateObject”, “StreamData”. By default you should not need to worry about AWS Service specific API operations like putItem() with a unique hash or even HTTP verbs.\n\nCascading service interactions: Certain actions in a declarative style can have overlapping or ambiguous AWS Service implementations. With an opinionated implementation, we can decide which Services are \"primary\" and which are \"secondary\" depending on what is configured. For instance, sending an image will prefer S3 over API Gateway.\n\nSimple, standard data objects: Sending & receiving data to AWS Services can have many parameters, which tend to show up in the SDKs. These are abstracted and inferred, where possible, with simple JSON that the implementation can reason about. Standard parameters (bucket names, stream names, partition keys, etc.) that are part of the implementation are extracted from a simplified configuration file and dynamically generated/updated in order to further allow focus on state and data types only.\n\n# Our Design\n\nAs more and more modules were introduced to AWS Amplify, it became necessary to modularize the library into smaller pieces so that users could avoid importing unnecessary parts into their app. The goal of this design is to make AWS Amplify modularized and also keep it backward-compatible to avoid breaking changes.\n\nModular import prevents unnecessary code dependencies from being included with the app, and thus decreases the bundle size while enabling added new functionality without the risk of introducing errors related to unused code.\n\nAmplify has established the concepts of categories and plugins. A category is a collection of api calls that are exposed to the client to do things inside that category. For example, in the storage category, generally one wants to upload and download objects from storage so the apis exposed to the client will represent that functionality. Because Amplify is pluggable, a plugin of your choosing will provide the actual implementation behind that api interface. Using the same example of Storage, the plugin we choose might be AWSStoragePlugin which would then implement each api call from the category with a service call or set of service calls to S3, the underlying storage provider of the AWS plugin.\n\n# Development Process\n\nOur work is done directly on Github and PR's are sent to the GitHub repo by core team members and contributors. Everyone undergoes the same review process to get their changes into the repo.\n\n## Setting up for local development\n\nThis section should get you running with **Amplify JS** and get you familiar with the basics of the codebase. You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your system and developing locally also requires `yarn` workspaces. You can install it [here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable).\n\nThe recommended version of Node JS to work with this project is [`16.19.0`](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v16.19.0/) with Yarn version [`1.22.x`](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).\n\n> Note: newer versions of Yarn (2+) remove support for lerna's `--mutex` flag\n> so be sure to use Yarn v1.22.x\n\nStart by [forking](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the main branch of [amplify-js](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js).\n\n```\ngit clone git@github.com:[username]/amplify-js.git\ncd amplify-js\n\nyarn\nyarn bootstrap\nyarn build\n```\n\n> Note: Make sure to always [sync your fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork) with main branch of `amplify-js`\n\n## Architecture of the codebase\n\nAmplify JS is a monorepo built with `Yarn` and `Lerna`. All the categories of Amplify live within the `packages` directory in the root. Each category inside packages has its own `src/` and `package.json`.\n\n[**Packages inside Amplify JS Monorepo**](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js/tree/main/packages)\n\n## Steps towards contributions\n\n- To make changes with respect to a specific category, go into `packages/[category]`.\n- Make changes to required file.\n- Write unit tests\n- Yarn build\n- Run test suite\n- Test in sample app using yarn linking\n- Submit a PR\n\n#### Build step:\n\n```\nyarn build --scope @aws-amplify/auth\n```\n\n#### Testing:\n\n```\nyarn run test --scope @aws-amplify/auth\n```\n\n> Note: There is a commit hook that will run the tests prior to committing. Please make sure if you are going to provide a pull request to be sure you include unit tests with your functionality and that all tests pass.\n\n#### Test in a local sample app\n\n**Yarn Linking**\nThe best way to develop locally and test is to link the individual package you’re working on and run lerna in watch mode.\n\nNote: to test using the react-native framework you will need to use [Verdaccio](#verdaccio)\n\nRun watch mode while editing (auth for example):\n\n```\nnpx lerna exec --scope @aws-amplify/auth yarn link\nnpx lerna exec --scope @aws-amplify/auth yarn build:watch\n```\n\nOr run the whole library in watch mode if you are working on multiple packages\n\n```\nyarn build # Build the whole library\nyarn link-all # Make all the packages available to link\nyarn build:watch # All packages are building in watch mode\n```\n\nIn your sample project, you can now link specific packages\n\n```\nyarn link @aws-amplify/auth\n```\n\nIf you are testing with a Vite sample project, such as from the quickstart guide, and your changes to the library are not showing up in your local app when running `yarn run dev`, Vite caching may be the culprit. Try editing this line in your sample project's `package.json`.\n\n```diff\n\"scripts\": {\n- \"dev\": \"vite\",\n+ \"dev\": \"vite --force\",\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nPassing unit tests are only necessary if you’re looking to contribute a pull request. If you’re just playing locally, you don’t need them. However, if you’re contributing a pull request for anything other than making a change to the documentation, fixing a formatting issue in the code (i.e., white space, missing semi-colons) or another task that does not impact the functionality of the code, you will need to validate your proposed changes with passing unit tests.\n\n#### Verdaccio\n\nVerdaccio is a lightweight private npm proxy registry built in Node.js. Install [Verdaccio](https://verdaccio.org/docs/en/installation). You can setup Verdaccio to publish packages locally to test the changes.\n\nTo publish in Verdaccio, start a Verdaccio instance and then,\n\n```\nyarn config set registry http://localhost:4873/\nyarn publish:verdaccio\n```\n\nTo publish a local version of a specific package,\n\n```\ncd packages/<category>\nyarn publish --registry http://localhost:4873/\n```\n\nOnce you are done with Verdaccio, you can reset to the default registry by doing,\n\n```\nyarn config set registry https://registry.yarnpkg.com\n```\n\n#### Bundle Size Checks\n\nAmplify JS enforces bundle size checks against incoming PRs. It uses the [size-limit](https://github.com/ai/size-limit) utility to test the Webpack tree-shaken footprint of common import patterns for a given category.\n\nThe configuration for each category can be found in the associated package's `package.json` file under the `size-limit` key.\n\n##### Local Invocation & Regression Debugging\n\nThe bundle size test can be performed locally (after building) by invoking the `test:size` build target from either a specific category or from the mono-repo package. Bundle size regressions associated with a given change can be debugged by specifying the `--why` flag, e.g. `yarn test:size --why`, which will open a Statoscope instance to permit analysis of the generated bundle. Some specific techniques for digging into regressions are outlined below.\n\n**Compare yarn.lock files**\nComparing `yarn.lock` files for each build can be a useful way to determine if your dependency graph has changed (which may have trickle down effect on Amplify's bundle size). The easiest way to do this is to download the `yarn.lock` files from the `build` step in CircleCI (under the \"Artifacts\" tab) for the failing build and an older passing build. These files can then be diffed locally to see if your dependency graph has changed: `diff yarn-passing.lock yarn-failing.lock`.\n\n**Compare `stats.json` files**\nThe Webpack `stats.json` file contains a [static analysis](https://webpack.js.org/api/stats/) for a particular bundle. To generate these files locally, checkout & build the failing change, navigate to the category that's failing, and execute the following command: `yarn test:size --save-bundle test_bundle`. The generated `stats.json` file can be found in the new `test_bundle` directory. Make sure to copy this file somewhere safe for analysis. Next rebuild your parent branch (typically `main`) and compare bundles using the following command: `yarn test:size --why --compare-with stats-failing.json`. This will open a Statoscope instance in your browser. The \"Choose stats\" & \"Diff\" buttons on the top right can be used to inspect & compare your bundles.\n\n`stats.json` files can also be plugged into other popular bundle analysis tools if desired.\n\n## Bug Reports\n\nBug reports and feature requests are always welcome. Good bug reports are extremely helpful, so thanks in advance!\n\nWhen filing a bug, please try to be as detailed as possible. In addition to the bug report form information, details like these are incredibly useful:\n\n- A reproducible test case or series of steps\n- The date/commit/version(s) of the code you're running\n- Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug\n- Anything unusual about your environment or deployment\n\nGuidelines for bug reports:\n\n- Check to see if a [duplicate or closed issue](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js/issues?q=is%3Aissue+) already exists!\n- Provide a short and descriptive issue title\n- Remove any sensitive data from your examples or snippets\n- Format any code snippets using [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks) syntax\n- If you're not using the latest version of a [specific package](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js/tree/main/packages), see if the issue still persists after upgrading - this helps to isolate regressions!\n\nFinally, thank you for taking the time to read this, and taking the time to write a good bug report.\n\n# Pull Requests\n\nPull requests are welcome!\n\nYou should open an issue to discuss your pull request, unless it's a trivial change. It's best to ensure that your proposed change would be accepted so that you don't waste your own time. If you would like to implement support for a significant feature that is not yet available, please talk to us beforehand to avoid any duplication of effort.\n\n_[Skip step 1 to 3 if you have already done this]_\n\n1. Fork [`aws-amplify/amplify-js`](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js)\n2. Clone your fork locally: `git clone git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/amplify-js.git`\n3. Run `yarn && yarn bootstrap` in the repository root\n4. Within your fork, create a new branch based on the issue (e.g. Issue #123) you're addressing - `git checkout -b \"group-token/short-token-[branch-name]\"` or `git checkout -b \"short-token/[branch-name]\"`\n   - Use grouping tokens at the beginning of the branch names. For e.g, if you are working on changes specific to `amplify-ui-components`, then you could start the branch name as `ui-components/...`\n   - short token\n     - feat: A new feature\n     - fix: A bug fix\n     - docs: Documentation only changes\n     - style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)\n     - refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature\n     - perf: A code change that improves performance\n     - test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests\n     - build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)\n     - ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)\n     - chore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files\n     - revert: Reverts a previous commit\n   - Use slashes to separate parts of branch names\n   - Hyphenate well-defined branch name\n5. Be sure to write tests to cover any added or modified code. Be especially vigilant when testing changes that affect shared code resources in order to catch problems such as race conditions. Once your work is committed and you're ready to share, run test `yarn test` on root-level package.\n\n   **Note:** Manually test your changes in a sample app with different edge cases and also test across different browsers and platform\n\n6. Then, Push your branch `git push origin -u`\n7. This previous step will give you a URL to view a GitHub page in your browser. Copy-paste this, and complete the workflow in the UI. It will invite you to \"create a PR\" from your newly published branch. Fill out the PR template to submit a PR.\n8. Finally, the Amplify JS team will review your PR. Add reviewers based on the core member who is tracking the issue with you or code owners. _In the meantime, address any automated check that fail (such as linting, unit tests, etc. in CI)_\n\n# Debugging\n\nSometimes the issue can be solved by doing a clean and fresh build. To do this, make sure to remove your node modules and clean your packages. You can run `git clean -xdf` in the repository root to achieve this.\n\n# Release\n\nTo give a bird's eye view of the release cycle,\n\n- We follow semantic versioning for our releases\n- Every merge into the `main` ends up as `unstable` package in the npm\n- The core team will cut a release out to `stable` from `unstable` bi-weekly\n\n## Finding contributions to work on\n\nLooking at the existing issues is a great way to find something to contribute on. As our projects, by default, use the default GitHub issue labels (enhancement/bug/duplicate/help wanted/invalid/question/wontfix), looking at any [`help wanted`](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js/labels/help%20wanted) or [`good first issue`](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js/issues?q=is:open+is:issue+label:%22good+first+issue%22) is a great place to start.\n\nYou could also contribute by reporting bugs, reproduction of bugs with sample code, documentation and test improvements.\n\n## Related Repositories\n\nThe Amplify Framework runs on Android, iOS, and numerous JavaScript-based web platforms.\n\n1.

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-amplify).\n\nTo get started pick your platform from our [**Getting Started** home page](https://docs.amplify.aws/javascript/)\n\n## Notice:\n\n### Amplify 6.x.x has breaking changes. Please see the breaking changes on our [migration guide](https://docs.amplify.aws/javascript/build-a-backend/troubleshooting/migrate-from-javascript-v5-to-v6/)\n\n### Amplify 5.x.x has breaking changes. Please see the breaking changes below:\n\n- If you are using **default exports** from any Amplify package, then you will need to migrate to using named exports. For example:\n\n  ```diff\n  - import Amplify from 'aws-amplify';\n  + import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify'\n\n  - import Analytics from '@aws-amplify/analytics';\n  + import { Analytics } from '@aws-amplify/analytics';\n  // or better\n  + import { Analytics } from 'aws-amplify';\n\n  - import Storage from '@aws-amplify/storage';\n  + import { Storage } from '@aws-amplify/storage';\n  // or better\n  + import { Storage } from 'aws-amplify';\n  ```\n\n- Datastore predicate syntax has changed, impacting the `DataStore.query`, `DataStore.save`, `DataStore.delete`, and `DataStore.observe` interfaces. For example:\n\n  ```diff\n  - await DataStore.delete(Post, (post) => post.status('eq', PostStatus.INACTIVE));\n  + await DataStore.delete(Post, (post) => post.status.eq(PostStatus.INACTIVE));\n\n  - await DataStore.query(Post, p => p.and( p => [p.title('eq', 'Amplify Getting Started Guide'), p.score('gt', 8)]));\n  + await DataStore.query(Post, p => p.and( p => [p.title.eq('Amplify Getting Started Guide'), p.score.gt(8)]));\n  ```\n\n  - To use the new syntax with 5.x.x you may need to rebuild your Datastore models with the latest version of Amplify codegen. To do this:\n    - [Upgrade the Amplify CLI](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/start/workflows/#upgrade-amplify-cli)\n      - `npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli`\n    - [Re-generate your models with Amplify codegen](https://docs.amplify.aws/lib/datastore/getting-started/q/platform/js/#code-generation-amplify-cli)\n      - `amplify codegen models`\n\n- `Storage.list` has changed the name of the `maxKeys` parameter to `pageSize` and has a new return type that contains the results list. For example:\n\n  ```diff\n  - const photos = await Storage.list('photos/', { maxKeys: 100 });\n  - const { key } = photos[0];\n\n  + const photos = await Storage.list('photos/', { pageSize: 100 });\n  + const { key } = photos.results[0];\n  ```\n\n- `Storage.put` with resumable turned on has changed the key to no longer include the bucket name. For example:\n\n  ```diff\n  - let uploadedObjectKey;\n  - Storage.put(file.name, file, {\n  -   resumable: true,\n  -   // Necessary to parse the bucket name out to work with the key\n  -   completeCallback: (obj) => uploadedObjectKey = obj.key.substring( obj.key.indexOf(\"/\") + 1 )\n  - }\n\n  + let uploadedObjectKey;\n  + Storage.put(file.name, file, {\n  +   resumable: true,\n  +   completeCallback: (obj) => uploadedObjectKey = obj.key\n  + }\n  ```\n\n- `Analytics.record` no longer accepts string as input. For example:\n\n  ```diff\n  - Analytics.record('my example event');\n  + Analytics.record({ name: 'my example event' });\n  ```\n\n- The `JS` export has been removed from `@aws-amplify/core` in favor of exporting the functions it contained.\n- Any calls to `Amplify.Auth`, `Amplify.Cache`, and `Amplify.ServiceWorker` are no longer supported. Instead, your code should use the named exports. For example:\n\n  ```diff\n  - import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';\n  - Amplify.configure(...);\n  - // ...\n  - Amplify.Auth.signIn(...);\n\n  + import { Amplify, Auth } from 'aws-amplify';\n  + Amplify.configure(...);\n  + // ...\n  + Auth.signIn(...);\n  ```\n\n### Amplify 4.x.x has breaking changes for React Native. Please see the breaking changes below:\n\n- If you are using React Native (vanilla or Expo), you will need to add the following React Native community dependencies:\n  - `@react-native-community/netinfo`\n  - `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`\n\n```\n// React Native\nyarn add aws-amplify amazon-cognito-identity-js @react-native-community/netinfo @react-native-async-storage/async-storage\nnpx pod-install\n\n// Expo\nyarn add aws-amplify @react-native-community/netinfo @react-native-async-storage/async-storage\n```\n\n### Amplify 3.x.x has breaking changes. Please see the breaking changes below:\n\n- `AWS.credentials` and `AWS.config` don’t exist anymore in Amplify JavaScript.\n  - Both options will not be available to use in version 3. You will not be able to use and set your own credentials.\n  - For more information on this change, please see the [AWS SDK for JavaScript v3](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3/#configuration)\n- `aws-sdk@2.x` has been removed from `Amplify@3.x.x` in favor of [version 3 of aws-sdk-js](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3). We recommend to migrate to [aws-sdk-js-v3](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3) if you rely on AWS services that are not supported by Amplify, since [aws-sdk-js-v3](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3) is imported modularly.\n\nIf you can't migrate to [aws-sdk-js-v3](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3) or rely on aws-sdk@2.x, you will need to import it separately.\n\n- If you are using exported paths within your Amplify JS application, (e.g. `import from \"@aws-amplify/analytics/lib/Analytics\"`) this will now break and no longer will be supported. You will need to change to named imports:\n\n  ```js\n  import { Analytics } from 'aws-amplify';\n  ```\n\n- If you are using categories as `Amplify.<Category>`, this will no longer work and we recommend to import the category you are needing to use:\n\n  ```js\n  import { Auth } from 'aws-amplify';\n  ```\n\n### DataStore Docs\n\nFor more information on contributing to DataStore / how DataStore works, see the [DataStore Docs](packages/datastore/README.md)\n"
