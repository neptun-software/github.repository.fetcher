If you are on a tokens budget, wait until v1 is released.\n- Again, this is an early, unstable release. A first test run. An early preview of the project's ideas. Far from completion. Open-source iterative development. Work in progress. Unstable early alpha release. [etc]\n\n### **If any of these might be issues for you, even in the slightest way, wait until v1 is released ! Do not try the current release !**\n\nTo help you guide your decision on whether or not to try the current release , here is a guide\n\n| Situation                                                                                             | Recommendation         |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| I'm not sure if this tool release is mature yet, maybe it will not work as intended and I may spend millions of tokens for nothing | Do not use it yet      |\n| I am very excited about this tool, I hope it is perfectly production-ready, because if it's not, I will make commentary about `I spent X amount on OpenAI API calls` | Do not use it yet      |\n| I am not interested in code. I want to type words into a box and have my project completed; I do not want messy broken unfinished code | Do not use it yet      |\n| I love exploring experimental tools but I am on the fence. It's going to break halfway and leave me sad | Do not use it yet      |\n| Who should even try it at this point?                                                                | Nobody. Do not use it yet |\n| But I really want to use it for some esoteric reason having read all the above.                       | Do not use it yet either |\n\n\n---\n\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cfd09250-d21e-49fc-a29b-fa0c661abfc0\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c055f9c4-6bc0-4b11-ba8f-cc9f149387fa\n\n---\n\n## Important\n\n**Early alpha release ; earlier than expected by few weeks**\n\nStill not merged with key target features of the project, notably :\n- project iteration modules for all dimensions of generated projects\n- admin interface for event streams and (deeper) project iterations\n- integrate the full genUI plugin :\n  * generative design systems\n  * deploy finetuned models & serve from api.cofounder\n- local, browser-based dev env for the entire project scope\n- add { react-native , flutter , other web frameworks }\n- validations & swarm code review and autofix\n- code optimization\n- [...]\n\nbe patient :)\n\n---\n\n# Usage\n\n## Install & Init\n\n* Open your terminal and run\n\n```sh\nnpx @openinterface/cofounder\n```\n\nFollow the instructions. The installer \n- will ask you for your keys\n- setup dirs & start installs\n- will start the local `cofounder/api` builder and server\n- will open the web dashboard where you can create new projects (at `http://localhost:4200` ) üéâ\n\n```\nnote :\nyou will be asked for a cofounder.openinterface.ai key\nit is recommended to use one as it enables the designer/layoutv1 and swarm/external-apis features\nand can be used without limits during the current early alpha period\n\nthe full index will be available for local download on v1 release\n```\n\n- currently using `node v22` for the whole project. \n\n\n\n```sh\n# alternatively, you can make a new project without going through the dashboard\n# by runing :\nnpx @openinterface/cofounder -p \"YourAppProjectName\" -d \"describe your app here\" -a \"(optional) design instructions\"\n```\n\n\n## Run Generated Apps\n\n- Your backend & vite+react web app will incrementally generate inside `./apps/{YourApp}`\nOpen your terminal in `./apps/{YourApp}` and run\n\n```sh\nnpm i && npm run dev\n```\n\nIt will start both the backend and vite+react, concurrently, after installing their dependencies\nGo to `http://localhost:5173/` to open the web app üéâ\n\n\n- From within the generated apps , you can use ‚åò+K / Ctrl+K to iterate on UI components\n\n[more details later]\n\n## Notes\n\n### Dashboard & Local API\n\nIf you resume later and would like to iterate on your generated apps,\nthe local `./cofounder/api` server needs to be running to receive queries\n\nYou can (re)start the `local cofounder API` running the following command from `./cofounder/api`\n\n```sh\nnpm run start\n```\n\nThe dashboard will open in `http://localhost:4200`\n\n\n- note: You can also generate new apps from the same env, without the the dashboard, by running, from `./cofounder/api`, one of these commands\n    \n    ```sh\n    npm run start -- -p \"ProjectName\" -f \"some app description\" -a \"minimalist and spacious , light theme\"\n    npm run start -- -p \"ProjectName\" -f \"./example_description.txt\" -a \"minimalist and spacious , light theme\"\n    ```\n\n### Concurrency\n\n**[the architecture will be further detailed and documented later]**\n\nEvery \"node\" in the `cofounder` architecture has a defined configuration under `./cofounder/api/system/structure/nodes/{category}/{name}.yaml` to handle things like concurrency, retries and limits per time interval\n\nFor example, if you want multiple LLM generations to run in parallel (when possible - sequences and parallels are defined in DAGS under `./cofounder/api/system/structure/sequences/{definition}.yaml` ),\ngo to\n\n```yaml\n#./cofounder/api/system/structure/nodes/op/llm.yaml\nnodes:\n op:LLM::GEN:\n  desc: \"...\"\n  in: [model, messages, preparser, parser, query, stream]\n  out: [generated, usage]\n  queue:\n   concurrency: 1 # <------------------------------- here \n op:LLM::VECTORIZE:\n  desc: \"{texts} -> {vectors}\"\n  in: [texts]\n  out: [vectors, usage]\n mapreduce: true\n op:LLM::VECTORIZE:CHUNK:\n  desc: \"{texts} -> {vectors}\"\n  in: [texts]\n  out: [vectors, usage]\n  queue:\n   concurrency: 50\n```\n\nand change the `op:LLM::GEN` parameter `concurrency` to a higher value\n\nThe default LLM concurrency is set to `2` so you can see what's happening in your console streams step by step - but you can increment it depending on your api keys limits\n\n---\n\n# Changelog\n\n---\n\n# Roadmap\n\n---\n\n# Benchmarks\n\n---\n\n# Community & Links\n\n- [![Cofounder](https://img.shields.io/badge/Cofounder-gray?style=for-the-badge&logo=discord&link=https://discord.gg/2kVMzeASj9)](https://discord.gg/2kVMzeASj9) | Community discord server by @flamecoders\n\n---\n\n# Docs, Design Systems, ...\n\n**[WIP]**\n\n---\n\n# Architecture\n\n[more details later]\n\narchi/v1 is as follows :\n\n![architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2d8b70e-7a6d-45c9-a706-0cf955d13451)\n\n\n---\n\n# Credits\n\n- Demo design systems built using Figma renders / UI kits from:\n  * blocks.pm by Hexa Plugin (see `cofounder/api/system/presets`)\n  * google material\n  * figma core\n  * shadcn\n- Dashboard node-based ui powered by [react flow](https://reactflow.dev/)\n"
