Fork and clone the repo\n2. Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies and run validation (We use pnpm so you need to follow [pnpm installation guide](https://pnpm.io/installation) first)\n3. Create a branch for your PR with `git checkout -b pr/your-branch-name`\n\n> Tip: Keep your `master` branch pointing at the original repository and make\n> pull requests from branches on your fork. To do this, run:\n>\n> ```\n> git remote add upstream https://github.com/bvaughn/react-error-boundary\n> git fetch upstream\n> git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/master master\n> ```\n>\n> This will add the original repository as a \"remote\" called \"upstream,\" Then\n> fetch the git information from that remote, then set your local `master`\n> branch to use the upstream master branch whenever you run `git pull`. Then you\n> can make all of your pull request branches based on this `master` branch.\n> Whenever you want to update your version of `master`, do a regular `git pull`.\n\n## Committing and Pushing changes\n\nPlease make sure to run the tests before you commit your changes. You can run `pnpm test`. Make\nsure to include those changes (if they exist) in your commit.\n\n## Help needed\n\nPlease checkout the [open issues][issues]\n\nAlso, please watch the repo and respond to questions/bug reports/feature\nrequests!

          "content": "# react-error-boundary\n\nReusable React [error boundary](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#catching-rendering-errors-with-an-error-boundary) component. Supports all React renderers (including React DOM and React Native).\n\n### If you like this project, 🎉 [become a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/bvaughn/) or ☕ [buy me a coffee](http://givebrian.coffee/)\n\n## Getting started\n\n```sh\n# npm\nnpm install react-error-boundary\n\n# pnpm\npnpm add react-error-boundary\n\n# yarn\nyarn add react-error-boundary\n```\n\n## API\n\n### `ErrorBoundary` component\nWrap an `ErrorBoundary` component around other React components to \"catch\" errors and render a fallback UI. The component supports several ways to render a fallback (as shown below).\n\n> **Note** `ErrorBoundary` is a _client_ component. You can only pass props to it that are serializeable or use it in files that have a `\"use client\";` directive.\n\n#### `ErrorBoundary` with `fallback` prop\nThe simplest way to render a default \"something went wrong\" type of error message.\n```js\n\"use client\";\n\nimport { ErrorBoundary } from \"react-error-boundary\";\n\n<ErrorBoundary fallback={<div>Something went wrong</div>}>\n  <ExampleApplication />\n</ErrorBoundary>\n```\n#### `ErrorBoundary` with `fallbackRender` prop\n[\"Render prop\"](https://react.dev/reference/react/Children#calling-a-render-prop-to-customize-rendering) function responsible for returning a fallback UI based on a thrown value.\n```js\n\"use client\";\n\nimport { ErrorBoundary } from \"react-error-boundary\";\n\nfunction fallbackRender({ error, resetErrorBoundary }) {\n  // Call resetErrorBoundary() to reset the error boundary and retry the render.\n\n  return (\n    <div role=\"alert\">\n      <p>Something went wrong:</p>\n      <pre style={{ color: \"red\" }}>{error.message}</pre>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n<ErrorBoundary\n  fallbackRender={fallbackRender}\n  onReset={(details) => {\n    // Reset the state of your app so the error doesn't happen again\n  }}\n>\n  <ExampleApplication />\n</ErrorBoundary>;\n```\n#### `ErrorBoundary` with `FallbackComponent` prop\nReact component responsible for returning a fallback UI based on a thrown value.\n```js\n\"use client\";\n\nimport { ErrorBoundary } from \"react-error-boundary\";\n\nfunction Fallback({ error, resetErrorBoundary }) {\n  // Call resetErrorBoundary() to reset the error boundary and retry the render.\n\n  return (\n    <div role=\"alert\">\n      <p>Something went wrong:</p>\n      <pre style={{ color: \"red\" }}>{error.message}</pre>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n<ErrorBoundary\n  FallbackComponent={Fallback}\n  onReset={(details) => {\n    // Reset the state of your app so the error doesn't happen again\n  }}\n>\n  <ExampleApplication />\n</ErrorBoundary>;\n```\n\n#### Logging errors with `onError`\n\n```js\n\"use client\";\n\nimport { ErrorBoundary } from \"react-error-boundary\";\n\nconst logError = (error: Error, info: { componentStack: string }) => {\n  // Do something with the error, e.g. log to an external API\n};\n\nconst ui = (\n  <ErrorBoundary FallbackComponent={ErrorFallback} onError={logError}>\n    <ExampleApplication />\n  </ErrorBoundary>\n);\n```\n\n### `useErrorBoundary` hook\nConvenience hook for imperatively showing or dismissing error boundaries.\n\n#### Show the nearest error boundary from an event handler\n\nReact only handles errors thrown during render or during component lifecycle methods (e.g. effects and did-mount/did-update). Errors thrown in event handlers, or after async code has run, will not be caught.\n\nThis hook can be used to pass those errors to the nearest error boundary:\n\n```js\n\"use client\";\n\nimport { useErrorBoundary } from \"react-error-boundary\";\n\nfunction Example() {\n  const { showBoundary } = useErrorBoundary();\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    fetchGreeting(name).then(\n      response => {\n        // Set data in state and re-render\n      },\n      error => {\n        // Show error boundary\n        showBoundary(error);\n      }\n    );\n  });\n\n  // Render ...\n}\n```\n\n#### Dismiss the nearest error boundary\nA fallback component can use this hook to request the nearest error boundary retry the render that originally failed.\n\n```js\n\"use client\";\n\nimport { useErrorBoundary } from \"react-error-boundary\";\n\nfunction ErrorFallback({ error }) {\n  const { resetBoundary } = useErrorBoundary();\n\n  return (\n    <div role=\"alert\">\n      <p>Something went wrong:</p>\n      <pre style={{ color: \"red\" }}>{error.message}</pre>\n      <button onClick={resetBoundary}>Try again</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### `withErrorBoundary` HOC\nThis package can also be used as a [higher-order component](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html) that accepts all of the same props as above:\n\n```js\n\"use client\";\n\nimport {withErrorBoundary} from 'react-error-boundary'\n\nconst ComponentWithErrorBoundary = withErrorBoundary(ExampleComponent, {\n  fallback: <div>Something went wrong</div>,\n  onError(error, info) {\n    // Do something with the error\n    // E.g. log to an error logging client here\n  },\n})\n\n// Can be rendered as <ComponentWithErrorBoundary {...props} />\n```\n\n---\n\n# FAQ\n## `ErrorBoundary` cannot be used as a JSX component\nThis error can be caused by a version mismatch between [react](https://npmjs.com/package/react) and [@types/react](https://npmjs.com/package/@types/react). To fix this, ensure that both match exactly, e.g.:\n\nIf using NPM:\n```json\n{\n  ...\n  \"overrides\": {\n    \"@types/react\": \"17.0.60\"\n  },\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nIf using Yarn:\n```json\n{\n  ...\n  \"resolutions\": {\n    \"@types/react\": \"17.0.60\"\n  },\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n[This blog post](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/use-react-error-boundary-to-handle-errors-in-react) shows more examples of how this package can be used, although it was written for the [version 3 API](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-error-boundary/releases/tag/v3.1.4).\n"
