          "type": "blob",
          "size": 4.896484375,
          "content": "# Contributing\n\nEveryone is welcome to contribute to **WXT**!\n\nIf you are changing the docs or fixing a bug, feel free to fork and open a PR.\n\nIf you want to add a new feature, please create an issue or discussion first so we can decide if the feature is inline with the vision for WXT.\n\n## Conventional Commits\n\nThis project uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en) to automate versioning. If you're a new contributor, don't worry about this. When you open a PR, a maintainer will change the PR's title so it's in the style of conventional commits, but that's all.\n\nMaintainers, commits to the `main` branch (either directly or via PRs) must be valid conventional commits.\n\n## Setup\n\nWXT uses `pnpm`, so make sure you have it installed.\n\n```sh\ncorepack enable\n```\n\nThen, simply run the install command:\n\n```sh\npnpm i\n```\n\n## Development\n\nHere are some helpful commands:\n\n```sh\n# Build WXT package\ncd packages/wxt\npnpm build\n```\n\n```sh\n# Build WXT package, then build demo extension\ncd packages/wxt-demo\npnpm build\n```\n\n```sh\n# Build WXT package, then start the demo extension in dev mode\ncd packages/wxt-demo\npnpm dev\n```\n\n```sh\n# Run unit and E2E tests\npnpm test\n```\n\n```sh\n# Start the docs website locally\npnpm docs:dev\n```\n\n## Profiling\n\n```sh\n# Build the latest version\npnpm --filter wxt build\n\n# CD to the demo directory\ncd packages/wxt-demo\n\n# 1. Generate a flamechart with 0x\npnpm dlx 0x node_modules/wxt/bin/wxt.mjs build\n# 2. Inspect the process with chrome @ chrome://inspect\npnpm node --inspect node_modules/wxt/bin/wxt.mjs build\n```\n\n## Updating Docs\n\nDocumentation is written with VitePress, and is located in the `docs/` directory.\n\nThe API reference is generated from JSDoc comments in the source code. If there's a typo or change you want to make in there, you'll need to update the source code instead of a file in the `docs/` directory.\n\n## Testing\n\nWXT has unit and E2E tests. When making a change or adding a feature, make sure to update the tests or add new ones, if they exist.\n\n> If they don't exist, feel free to create them, but that's a lot for a one-time contributor. A maintainer might add them to your PR though.\n\nTo run tests for a specific file, add the filename at the end of the test command:\n\n```sh\npnpm test manifest-contents\n```\n\nAll test (unit and E2E) for all packages are ran together via [Vitest workspaces](https://vitest.dev/guide/#workspaces-support).\n\nIf you want to manually test a change, you can modify the demo project for your test, but please don't leave those changes committed once you open a PR.\n\n## Templates\n\nEach directory inside `templates/` is it's own standalone project. Simply `cd` into the directory you're updating, install dependencies with `npm` (NOT `pnpm`), and run the relevant commands\n\n```sh\ncd templates/vue\nnpm i\nnpm run dev\nnpm run build\n```\n\nNote that templates are hardcoded to a specific version of `wxt` from NPM, they do not use the local version. PR checks will test your PR's changes against the templates, but if you want to manually do it, update the package.json dependency:\n\n```diff\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"typescript\": \"^5.3.2\",\n    \"vite-plugin-solid\": \"^2.7.0\",\n-   \"wxt\": \"^0.8.0\"\n+   \"wxt\": \"../..\"\n  }\n```\n\nThen run `npm i` again.\n\n### Adding Templates\n\nTo add a template, copy the vanilla template and give it a new name.\n\n```sh\ncp -r templates/vanilla templates/<new-template-name>\n```\n\nThat's it. Once your template is merged, it will be available inside `wxt init` immediately. You don't need to release a new version of WXT to release a new template.\n\n## Releasing Updates\n\nReleases are done with GitHub actions:\n\n- Use the [Release workflow](https://github.com/wxt-dev/wxt/actions/workflows/release.yml) to release a single package in the monorepo. This automatically detects the version change with conventional commits, builds and uploads the package to NPM, and creates a GitHub release.\n- Use the [Sync Releases workflow](https://github.com/wxt-dev/wxt/actions/workflows/sync-releases.yml) to sync the GitHub releases with changes to the changelog. To change a release, update the `CHANGELOG.md` file and run the workflow. It will sync the releases of a single package in the monorepo.\n\n## Upgrading Dependencies\n\nUse [`taze`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/taze) to upgrade dependencies throughout the entire monorepo.\n\n```sh\npnpm dlx taze -r\n```\n\nConfiguration is in [`taze.config.ts`](./taze.config.ts).\n\n## Install Unreleased Versions\n\nThis repo uses https://pkg.pr.new to publish versions of all it's packages for almost every commit. You can install them via:\n\n```sh\nnpm i https://pkg.pr.new/[package-name]@[ref]\n```\n\nOr use one of the shorthands:\n\n```sh\n# Install the latest build of `wxt` from a PR:\nnpm i https://pkg.pr.new/wxt@1283\n\n# Install the latest build of `@wxt-dev/module-react` on the `main` branch\nnpm i https://pkg.pr.new/@wxt-dev/module-react@main\n\n# Install `@wxt-dev/storage` from a specific commit:\nnpm i https://pkg.pr.new/@wxt-dev/module-react@426f907\n```\n"
