This helps you do that in [React Native](https://reactnative.dev). NativeWind is **not** a component library, it's a styling library. If you're looking for component libraries that support NativeWind, [see below](https://github.com/nativewind/nativewind/tree/%40danstepanov/docs-v4.1?tab=readme-ov-file#what-if-im-looking-for-a-component-library-that-uses-nativewind).\n\nNativeWind makes sure you're using the best style engine for any given platform (e.g. CSS StyleSheet or StyleSheet.create). It's goals are to to provide a consistent styling experience across all platforms, improving developer UX, component performance, and code maintainability.\n\nNativeWind processes your styles during your application's build step and uses a minimal runtime to selectively apply reactive styles (eg changes to device orientation, light dark mode).\n\n## Installation\n\nIf you have an existing project, [use these guides](https://www.nativewind.dev/getting-started/react-native) to configure NativeWind for your respective stack.\n\nAlternatively, you can create a new pre-configured project via our Quickstart options, below.\n\n## Quickstart\n\nYou can get started with any of the following options:\n\n- [Create Expo Stack](https://rn.new): `npx create-expo-stack@latest --nativewind`\n- ~~[Create Expo App](https://expo.new): `npx create-expo-app -e with-nativewind`~~ (being fixed to work with v4)\n\n## Features\n\n- Works on **all** RN platforms, uses the best style system for each platform.\n- Uses the Tailwind CSS compiler\n- Styles are computed at **build time**\n- Small runtime keeps your components fast\n- **jsxImportSourceTransform** only wraps native components, making it lighter and such that the **className** prop is accessible inside your component\n- Respects all tailwind.config.js settings, including **themes, custom values,** and **plugins**\n- Support for\n  - custom CSS properties, aka **CSS Variables**\n  - **dark mode, arbitrary classes,** and **media queries**\n  - **animations** and **transitions**\n  - **container queries**\n    - `container-type` and style-based container queries are not supported\n  - pseudo classes - **hover / focus / active** on compatible components\n  - `rem` units\n  - theme functions and nested functions\n  - React 18 Suspense API\n  - Custom CSS\n- Styling based on **parent state modifiers** - automatically style children based upon parent pseudo classes\n  - support for the `group` and `group/<name>` syntax\n- **Children styles** - create simple layouts based upon parent class\n- Fast and consistent style application via hot reload\n  - includes changes made to `tailwind.config.js`\n\n[More details here](https://www.nativewind.dev/blog/announcement-nativewind-v4#breaking-changes-from-v2)\n\n## npm distribution tags\nIt's worth noting that we do not have Github branches that directly correlate to npm distribution tags. Instead, we deploy to specific npm tags either via automated Github actions (push to `main` -> publish to `next`) or manually (snapshots versions).\n- **Release:** `latest` (currently v2.0.11)\n  - You should use this version\n- **Canary:** `canary` (currently v4.0.36)\n  - You can use this version\n  - Potentially less stable than latest but likely more robust\n- **Experimental:** `next` tag (currently v4.1)\n  - You probably shouldn't use this version\n  - Undergoing testing to move to a release version\n- **Bleeding Edge:** snapshot releases prefixed with `0.0.0-`\n  - You should not use this version\n  - Used internally for moving towards a `next` version\n\n## Contribution\n\n[See this guide](https://github.com/nativewind/nativewind/blob/main/contributing.md)\n\n# FAQ\n\n## Is it safe to use v4?\nIt's reasonably safe to use the `canary` version save for a known issue with styles being inconsistently applied. This issue is resolved in the `next` version; however, using this dist tag may break your app as it is considered experimental. To see which versions correlate to these dist tags, please refer to [our npm distrbution tags](https://github.com/nativewind/nativewind?tab=readme-ov-file#npm-distribution-tags).\n\n## Is NativeWind moving to Expo?\n\nNo. Expo is always exploring ways to handle styles better but NativeWind, as a project, will not be moving into the Expo organization.\n\n## Can we disable the change that was done recently to auto-add nativewind types using a setting or something? I already have the settings using `compilerOptions.types`, so I would like to disable the file generation.\n\nNot at the moment. We've found this will cause a long term problem where people \"forget\" what their type config was doing. They then update their types and break the NativeWind ones. To combat this, we've copied the behavior from other major frameworks which is to handle their types seperately from user specified ones.\n\nIn the future, we may add an option like `dangerouslyDisableTypeScriptGeneration` or something verbose to prevent people from using it. We are tired of solving TypeScript issues, particularly ones such as \"my types were working and now they aren't.\"\n\n## What happened to v3?\n\nSimilar to Valve, we don't like the number 3. Nah, we had a V3 but it was a bad idea and needed to be reworked so we dropped it and moved on to v4.\n\n## What if I'm looking for a component library that uses NativeWind?\n\nThere are a number of different component libraries available that use NativeWind to achieve different results. You should pick the one that best suits your needs.\n\n### [NativeWindUI](https://nativewindui.com)\n\nThis multi-platform library focuses on achieving native feel for each individual platform using the familiar interface of Tailwind CSS.\n\n### [React Native Reusables](https://rnr-docs.vercel.app)\n\nThis open source library offers universal [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) via React Native. Use this as a foundation to develop your own high-quality component library.\n\n### [GluestackUI v2](https://gluestack.io)\n\nFrom the folks that brought you NativeBase, this library offers customizable cross-platform components designed to look & behave cleanly on every platform.\n\n## What are the breaking changes from v2 to v4?\n\nAll breaking changes are [outlined here](https://www.nativewind.dev/blog/announcement-nativewind-v4#breaking-changes-from-v2).\n\n## Documentation\n\nLearn more on [our website](https://nativewind.dev).\n"

          "content": "# Welcome to the NativeWind contributing guide\n\nThank you for your interest in contributing to NativeWind!\n\nIn this guide, you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue to creating, reviewing, and merging a PR.\n\n## New contributor guide\n\nUse this documentation and [this diagram](https://link.excalidraw.com/l/398AFcdY0wd/4cHnU8Ilxw7) to gain an understanding of how NativeWind works and how to contribute to the project. Please note, This diagram is a work in progress.\n\n## What can I contribute to?\n\nBefore delving deeper into the collaboration worflow, let's talk about what kind of contributions can be made. Make sure you've reviewed the above diagram to understand how various aspects of NativeWind function.\n\nThere are three main things you can usually contribute to:\n\n- **Docs**: Anything that would improve the documentation for NativeWind (guides, installation instructions, API docs, core concepts, customizations, styling options, and/or even just typo corrections).\n\n- **Onboarding**: Helping to make installation of NativeWind easier by turning static changes into predefined plugins.\n\n- **Tests**: NativeWind has a pretty robust suite of tests. However, if you believe that we could benefit from an additional test or two that would meaningfully improve stability, please feel free to open a PR.\n\n- **Landing page**: We're interested in having a landing page that shows off what is possible with NativeWind as well as includes a showcase of folks using it in production.\n\n- **Bug fixes/reports**: If you think you've found a bug or some unexpected behavior in NativeWind or its dependencies, you're welcome to raise an issue and/or PR with a bug description and/or fix.\n\nIdeas for improving architecture of NativeWind are always welcome, but we ask that you open a discussion with an overview of the proposed ideas first, in order to ensure a proper debate.\n\nBe sure to follow the templates for new issues and pull requests, when applicable.\n\n## Contribution workflow\n\nThis project uses npm, and should be run with Node.js on the latest available LTS version. Ensure you have them properly setup on your development environment before continuing.\n\n### Opening an issue\n\nWhen opening an issue, it's crucial to provide a reproduction of the problem to help us take action. We have created some templates to make this easier for you.\n\n#### Reproduction Templates\n\n- **StackBlitz template**: [NativeWind Test on StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/nativewind-test?view=editor)\n- **Create Expo Stack template**: \n  - `npx create-expo-stack@latest --nativewind`\n  - `npx create-expo-stack@latest --nativewind --expo-router`\n\n#### Steps to Follow\n\n1. **Test with Inline Styles**: Before reporting an issue, ensure that your flex layout behaves as expected using inline styles (passing `StyleSheet` styles to the `style` prop). This helps to confirm that the issue is specific to NativeWind.\n\n2. **Provide a Reproduction**: If you can get your styles working with inline styles but not with NativeWind, use one of the provided templates to create a reproduction of the issue:\n   - **StackBlitz**: This is the preferred method as it allows us to respond more quickly.\n   - **Create Expo Stack**: Use the provided commands to set up a reproducible example.\n\n3. **Submit the Issue**: Include the link to your reproduction in the issue description. If no reproduction is provided for an issue that can be reproduced, we are likely not to look into the issue.\n\nBy following these steps, you help us understand and resolve issues more efficiently.\n\n### Forking and cloning\n\nFor external contributors, the best way to make changes to the project is to fork the repository and clone it locally:\n\n1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account: https://github.com/nativewind/nativewind/fork\n\n2. Clone the forked repository locally:\n\n```shell\n$ git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/nativewind\n\n$ cd nativewind\n```\n\n3. Confirm that tests are passing\nPrior to making changes of your own, you'll want to make sure that the project is properly configured and that all the tests are passing.\n\n3a. Install the project dependencies\n\n```shell\nnpm i\n```\n\n3b. Build the project locally\n\n```shell\nnpm run build\n```\n\n3c. Run the test suite\nWe recommend installing the [Jest VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Orta.vscode-jest) to run the tests. Once installed, you should have Testing icon in your left-hand tool bar:\n\n![alt text](image.png)\n\nNavigating to this tab will allow you to use a convenient GUI to run all the tests. Alternatively, you can run the tests using the following command:\n```shell\nnpm run test\n```\n\nIf this all works as expected, you can move on. Otherwise, open an issue on Github with your environment setup.\n\n4. Checkout on a new branch, and start adding your changes:\n\n```shell\ngit checkout -b <@YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/<MEANINGFUL_DESCRIPTOR>\n```\n\nWhen you're ready to submit your changes, push your branch to your forked repository and open a pull request against the `next` branch of the source repository.\n\n### Directory structure\n\nThe NativeWind homepage/documentation and source-code can be found in the `apps/website` and `packages/` directories, respectively. The `packages/nativewind` is a wrapper around `packages/react-native-css-interop`.\n\nMore information on how `react-native-css-interop` works is coming soon.\n\nTo run the documentation website after installing all dependencies:\n\n```shell\nnpm run website\n```\n\nAdditionally, there is an `examples/` directory which includes an example app set up with Expo Router and there is an Expo Snack in the `apps/snack/` directory. These both likely need to be updated from v2 to v4.\n\n### Make your changes\n\nOnce you've made your changes and tested that it works locally, run the tests using `npm run test` in the root directory. You should also add a test to cover your own contribution, if relevant.\n\nIf your changes alter and/or add to the behavior of the NativeWind, or fix a bug in it, then we encourage you to also create a **changeset**. A changeset is a quick summary that expresses the intention to bump the version of the package. This is used by our CI in order to automatically manage releases to NPM.\n\nTo introduce a new changeset, run:\n\n```shell\nnpx changeset\n```\n\nThis will prompt you for the kind of version bump your changes introduce (`patch`, `minor`, `major`), and for a quick summary of your changes. If the change is small enough, it is valid to just replicate the contents of your commit message. If it's more complex, the changeset summary (generated in the root `.changeset` directory) can be edited to include more information.\n\nThe generated changeset file should be included in your commit. That way, when the new version releases, you will be properly credited on GitHub's release page and in the project's changelog.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> If you're not sure what kind of version bump your changes introduce, you can reach out to one of the maintainers in the PR comments and we'll try to help you out!\n\n> **_TODO:_** Add template for pull requests and issues"
