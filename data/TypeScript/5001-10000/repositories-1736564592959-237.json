          "content": "# Contributing to Mockoon\n\nMockoon thrives on community contributions, and there are many ways to get involved! You can report bugs, open issues, submit pull requests, or suggest new features. All contributions are appreciated. However, it's important to note that Mockoon's core promise is to remain easy to use, and after years of development, it is mostly feature-complete.\n\nWhile we’re always open to enhancing the application, we strive to balance adding new features with maintaining simplicity and ensuring long-term maintainability. For this reason, not every feature suggestion will be implemented—especially if it falls outside Mockoon’s scope, introduces unnecessary complexity (particularly in terms of user experience), or lacks strong community interest.\n\nThat said, we value your input and welcome open discussions! 🙂\n\nHow do we decide what to work on next? We don't have a strict roadmap, but we do have a few guidelines:\n\n- We prioritize bug fixes and performance improvements.\n- We consider features that are highly requested by the community.\n- We have our own ideas for improving the application, often aligned with our commercial offering ([Mockoon Cloud](https://mockoon.com/cloud/)) and our own usage of the applications.\n- We consider less requested features that are easy to implement and maintain, or that have a low impact on the application's complexity (e.g., adding a new templating helper).\n\nWhat **we recommend before contributing**:\n\n- Take some time to understand the application's existing features and limitations by reading the [documentation](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/).\n- Search through [Mockoon's GitHub issues](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues) to see if your bug report or feature request has already been addressed, implemented, or declined.\n- If you’re uncertain whether a feature fits Mockoon’s scope or if an issue is indeed a bug, [start a discussion first](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/discussions). This helps clarify ideas before creating an issue or working on a pull request.\n- If you’re planning to contribute a new feature, please open an issue to discuss it with the maintainers. This ensures alignment with the project’s goals and gives the community a chance to provide feedback.\n\nYou can join our [Discord server](https://mockoon.com/discord/) to discuss your ideas, ask questions, or just chat with other Mockoon users and contributors. But support requests and new ideas should be discussed on the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/discussions) as they are more easily searchable.\n\nWhat **we don't recommend**:\n\n- Opening a pull request without discussing the feature or bug fix with the maintainers first or if it hasn't been discussed or approved first. This can lead to wasted effort if the change isn't aligned with the project's goals.\n- Opening a new issue without providing a way to reproduce the bug or a clear description of the feature request. This can lead to misunderstandings and delays in addressing the issue.\n\nWhat to **keep in mind when contributing to an open-source project**:\n\n- Your timing may not align with the maintainers' availability. You may open an issue or pull request and not receive an immediate response. Please be patient and respectful.\n- Your feature request or bug report may not be accepted. The maintainers have to balance many factors when deciding what to include in the application. If your request is declined, it doesn't mean your contribution isn't valued.\n\n## Contributing and issues assignment\n\nWe usually prefer to assign issues to contributors who are actively working on them. This helps avoid duplicated work and ensures that the assignee is the person who will be working on the issue (yes it's old-fashioned!).\n\nWe recommend the following workflow:\n\n- Check for **opened unassigned** issues or open a new one (after searching for closed issues).\n- If you are not the issue creator, comment on the issue and request to work on it so it can be assigned to you.\n- After discussing the implementation, the issue will be assigned to you by a maintainer. As a rule, the assignee is the person working on the issue.\n\n## Monorepo\n\nMockoon is using a monorepo setup (with Lerna). We have 4 packages in the `./packages/` folder:\n\n**Libraries** used by the desktop application and the CLI:\n\n- _@mockoon/commons_: this library contains mostly typings, utils and migrations designed to be used in both the browser and Node.js environments. Thus, it is safe to use in the desktop Electron's main or renderer processes, and the CLI.\n- _@mockoon/commons-server_: this library contains mostly \"server side\" code designed to be used in a Node.js environment. Thus, it is safe to use it in the desktop application Electron's main process and the CLI, but **not** in the desktop application Electron's renderer process.\n\n**Applications**:\n\n- _@mockoon/cli_; the CLI built with Oclif\n- _@mockoon/serverless_; the package to run Mockoon as a serverless function (AWS lambda, etc.)\n- _@mockoon/desktop_: the desktop application built with Electron and Angular (for the renderer process)\n\n## Build and run the applications locally during development\n\nPrepare the repository:\n\n1. Clone the repository: `git@github.com:mockoon/mockoon.git`.\n2. Install the dependencies and create internal symlinks: `npm run bootstrap`.\n3. Build the 2 libraries: `npm run build:libs`. You can also build them in watch mode with `npm run build:libs:watch`.\n\nFor the CLI:\n\n- Build the CLI: `npm run build:cli`.\n- Test CLI's command by running `./packages/cli/bin/run {command} args` where \"command\" is a CLI command like `start`, `stop`, etc.\n\nFor the desktop application:\n\n- Build the application processes (Electron main and renderer processes) `npm run build:desktop:dev` or in watch mode `npm run build:desktop:dev:watch`.\n- Start the application with `npm run start:desktop:dev`. The application will restart automatically when you make changes to the `commons` or `commons-server` libraries or to the desktop application's code.\n\n### VSCode remote debugging\n\nTo debug the desktop application, you can use the VSCode launch configuration `Desktop: All processes` (You need to stop the `npm run start:desktop:dev` command). It will start the application in debug mode and attach the debugger to it. You will then be able to set breakpoints in VSCode on the desktop application's code and on the libraries code (`commons` or `commons-server`).\n\n## Work on your feature or bugfix\n\n- Start your `feature` or `fix` from `main`\n- Cover it with automated tests. You will find them in the `test` folders of each package. Please try to cover at least the easiest test cases of your feature.\n- Preferably squash your commits, except when it makes sense to keep them separate (one refactoring + feature development)\n- Do not forget to add \"Closes #xx\" in one of the commit messages or in the pull request description (where xx is the GitHub issue number).\n\nBranches naming convention:\n\n- features and enhancements: `feature/{issue_number}-description`\n- bug fixes: `fix/{issue_number}-description`\n- chores: `chore/{issue_number}-description`\n\n## Adding migrations\n\nWhen a feature or bugfix requires a change in the data model (`Environment`, `Route`, `RouteResponse`, etc.) you may have to add a new migration:\n\n- Add a new migration function in the @mockoon/commons library `./packages/commons/src/libs/migrations.ts` file.\n- Add a new test for the migration in the same library `./packages/commons/test/data/migrations/{MIGRATION_ID}/environments.json` and `./packages/commons//test/suites/migrations.spec.ts` files.\n- Use the script `./packages/desktop/scripts/migrate-tests.js` in the desktop package in order to migrate the tests' JSON samples (usually located in `./packages/{package_name}/test/data/...`) to the latest migration. Please note that some folders/sample files are excluded from the migration on purpose.\n\nSome data model changes may not require a migration, for example, adding a new choice in an enum (translated in the UI by a dropdown).\n\n> ⚠️ All data model changes must be release in a **major** version. In any case, please discuss the migration with the maintainers.\n\n## Lint and format\n\nESLint rules and Prettier code styling are enforced by the continuous integration pipeline. Please fix all the ESLint issues and format your code using Prettier before pushing.\n\n## Run the tests\n\nSome unit and integration tests are present in the 4 packages. First you need to build the following 4 packages:\n\n1. `npm run build:libs`.\n2. `npm run build:serverless`.\n3. `npm run build:cli`.\n4. `npm run build:desktop:ci`.\n\nAfter the packages are build, you can run the tests necessary to your changes:\n\n- `npm run test:commons`\n- `npm run test:commons-server`\n- `npm run test:libs` (includes `commons` and `commons-server`)\n- `npm run test:serverless`\n- `npm run test:cli`\n\nTo run the desktop application tests, first you need to package the application for your platform. Run one of the following commands:\n\n- `package:desktop:test:win`\n- `package:desktop:test:mac`\n- `package:desktop:test:linux`\n\nThis will create a packaged version of the desktop application (without installer) in the `./packages/desktop/packages/{win-unpacked|mac|linux-unpacked}` folder.\n\nYou can then run the tests with one of the following commands:\n\n- `test:desktop:win`\n- `test:desktop:mac`\n- `test:desktop:linux`\n\nYou can also run a single test file with the following commands (from the monorepo root level):\n\n- `npm run test:desktop:{win|mac|linux} -- -- --spec \"filename.spec.ts\"`\n\nAll tests will also be run on each commit or pull request in the CI environment. You can perfectly rely on the CI to check if your changes are breaking the tests or not.\n\n> ℹ️ Note: Since update v7.0.0 where dependencies were updated (especially Webdriverio and Electron 29), running the desktop tests against an unpackaged version of the application using the `node_modules` binary (e.g. `node_modules/.bin/electron app=dist/app.js`) is not working anymore.\n\n## Open a pull request\n\nOpen a pull request to be merged in the `main` branch. All branches should start from `main` and must be merged into `main`. Ask one maintainer to review the code.\n\n---\n\n## **[Maintainers only]** Build, package and release the applications for production\n\n- Increment the version (which follows [semver](https://semver.org/)) in each package.json file depending on the changes, using `npm run set-versions`. To ignore a package give it the same version. Lerna will take care of increasing the internal dependencies version numbers.\n- Push.\n\n> Versions are synchronized between the desktop application, CLI and the libraries. We release all of them at the same time with a **major** version bump when a data migration is included in the relase, or when new common features are added (common = feature working in both desktop and CLI). The libraries can be released independently from the desktop application for minor and patch versions when the changes are only affecting the libraries.\n\n**Desktop application's process:**\n\n> /!\\\\ Respect the desktop tag format `vx.x.x` and the GitHub release creation as the desktop application automated update depends on it.\n\n1. Create a GitHub release targeting the `vx.x.x` tag.\n\n> /!\\\\ Mark the release as a pre-release, and only set it as a final release when all binaries are successfully build, tested and uploaded. Otherwise, it will trigger the auto-update for versions <1.19.0.\n\nThe desktop Electron application will be packaged using the local symlinked libraries. So, the desktop's release can be independent from the libraries release.\nThe GitHub workflow will automatically package the application for different platforms with `npm run package:win|mac|linux`. Including Windows/macOS code signing and notarization. Code signing is currently managed by @255kb.\nBinaries will be saved as Actions artifacts.\n\n2. Manually test the binaries if needed (changes not covered by automated tests).\n\n3. Upload the artifacts binaries to the new GitHub release.\n\n4. Publish the release (remove the \"pre-release\" label).\n\n**Libs' process (commons, commons-server, serverless, CLI):**\n\nCreate a `libs-vx.x.x` tag to automatically release all the libraries on NPM (commons, commons-server, serverless, CLI).\n\n> /!\\\\ Do not create a **GitHub release** for the libs, as desktop versions <=1.19.0 relies on https://api.github.com/repos/mockoon/mockoon/releases/latest to get the latest release version. As we are using a monorepo, this would mess up the legacy auto update from the desktop application.\n\n### Building the desktop application locally in production mode\n\nTo build the desktop application locally in production mode, you can use the following commands:\n\n- `npm run build:libs` to build the libraries.\n- `npm run build:desktop:prod` to build the application processes (Electron main and renderer processes).\n- `npm run package:desktop:win` to package the application for Windows.\n- Or `npm run package:desktop:mac:unsigned` to package the application for macOS.\n- Or `npm run package:desktop:linux` to package the application for Linux.\n\nThis will create a packaged version of the desktop application in the `./packages/desktop/packages/` folder.\n\n> 💡 Note: Code signing should be ignored on Windows when building locally. For macOS, the command `npm run package:desktop:mac:unsigned` will create an unsigned package, ignoring code signing and notarization.\n\n## Desktop application distribution\n\nSome manual steps are required in order to properly distribute the application:\n\n- the API repository (private) desktop release files must be updated. This will update the download links on the website.\n- A pull request must be created to update Homebrew Cask repository (update the `version` and the `sha256` hash in the `Casks/mockoon.rb` file and open a PR).\n- Binary must be uploaded to the Snap store manually with `snapcraft upload --release=stable ./mockoon-{version}.snap` command.\n- Arch Linux repository must be updated (Docker image and script can be used in `./scripts/aur-version-bump`).\n- Chocolatey package should be automatically updated after some days.\n"
