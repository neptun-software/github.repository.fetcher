          "content": "# Changelog\n\nAll notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.\n\nThe format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),\nand this project adheres to [Semantic\nVersioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).\n\n## Unreleased\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fix a bug that may have resulted in Wireit attempting to open too many files\n  at once (no known reports).\n\n## [0.14.9] - 2024-09-03\n\n### Added\n\n- Add support for forcing the use of filesystem polling instead of OS events in watch mode. Set the environment variable `WIREIT_WATCH_STRATEGY=poll`, and optionally `WIREIT_WATCH_POLL_MS` (default `500`).\n\n## [0.14.8] - 2024-08-22\n\n### Added\n\n- Added support for `node --run`, available in Node 22 and above (see\n  https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/v22-release-announce#running-packagejson-scripts).\n\n## [0.14.7] - 2024-08-05\n\n- When GitHub caching fails to initialize, more information is now shown about\n  the error, and it is no longer fatal.\n\n## [0.14.6] - 2024-08-05\n\n### Added\n\n- Added support for the `v2` version of the\n  `google/wireit@setup-github-actions-caching` action, which provides improved\n  security. All users are advised to upgrade to\n  `google/wireit@setup-github-actions-caching/v2`.\n\n## [0.14.5] - 2024-07-08\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Wireit will now shut down its child processes gracefully when receiving\n  `SIGTERM`. Previously only `SIGINT` was listened for.\n\n### Changed\n\n- Updated `engines` in `package.json` so that users of Node 16 and 17 will get\n  install warnings (consistent with `0.13.0` which already raised the minimum\n  supported version to Node 18).\n\n- Replaced `braces` dependency with smaller `brace-expansion` dependency.\n\n## [0.14.4] - 2024-01-26\n\n### Fixed\n\n- When listing a symlink that points to a directory in `output` files, the\n  symlink will now be directly cached as a symlink, instead of its children\n  being cached. This also fixes an `file already exists, symlink` exception that\n  could occur in the same situation.\n\n## [0.14.3] - 2024-01-10\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Handle missing file errors thrown while trying to fingerprint an input file with a graceful abort.\n\n## [0.14.2] - 2024-01-10\n\n### Added\n\n- Added a `default` option to the `env` setting for externally-provided environment variables to use when no value is provided.\n\n### Changed\n\n- The default logger for non-interactive environments has been switched to the 'quiet-ci' logger.\n- The local cache strategy will now create copy-on-write files when supported. This can improve performance when copying output files either into the cache or restoring from out of it, as the files' underlying data doesn't need to be copied, only filesystem metadata.\n- Unhandled exceptions will now be handled more gracefully.\n\n## [0.14.1] - 2023-10-20\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fix our `npx wireit` detection so we continue to give a good error message\n  with the latest version of `npm` when wireit is run this way.\n\n- Fix a bug where wireit would hang with an empty spinner after being killed\n  with CTRL-C when running a service whose dependencies were still starting.\n\n## [0.14.0] - 2023-09-12\n\n### Changed\n\n- The default logger has switched from 'simple'. It's 'quiet-ci' if the environment variable `CI` is set, otherwise it's 'quiet'. To switch back, set the environment variable WIREIT_LOGGER to 'simple'.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- More reliably handle and report diagnostics for scripts with invalid configurations. Specifically fixed https://github.com/google/wireit/issues/803.\n\n- Gracefully handle errors from the GitHub download cache API.\n\n## [0.13.0] - 2023-09-01\n\n### Changed\n\n- **[BREAKING]** Node 14 and Node 16 are no longer supported. Node 14 is past its end of life and Node 16 will be shortly. See the Node Release Schedule here:https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule. Node 18 will be supported until April 2025.\n\n## [0.12.0] - 2023-09-01\n\n## Added\n\n- Added a `quiet-ci` logger with output optimized for non-interactive environments, like a continuous integration builder (e.g. GitHub Actions). Writes less often, doesn't show a spinner, doesn't use \\r to try to writeover previous output, and only prints a new status line if there's been a change.\n\n## Fixed\n\n- Don't write to Symbol.dispose if it's already present, as that throws an error if there's a native implementation. This fixes wireit in Node v20.\n\n## [0.11.0] - 2023-08-30\n\n## Added\n\n- The `WIREIT_LOGGER` environment variable can now be used to control the system that writes output the the command line.\n- Added a new `quiet` logger that writes a single continuously updating line summarizing progress, and only passes along stdout and stderr from commands if there's a failure.\n\n## [0.10.0] - 2023-07-10\n\n### Added\n\n- Added tracking of metrics for successful script executions. Metrics are emitted\n  at the end of each run where at least one successful execution occurred.\n\n- Wireit now limits its number of file descriptors. This is to prevent crashes, and the default value of 200 should be high enough not to regress performance. Set the WIREIT_MAX_OPEN_FILES env variable to override the default.\n\n## [0.9.5] - 2023-02-06\n\n### Changed\n\n- Better attribute socket errors, and don't crash when a socket is closed\n  unexpectedly.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed infinite loops that could occur in watch mode when a script failed, but\n  still emitted output that was configured as the input files for another\n  script.\n\n- Don't clear the console or emit \"no-op\" style log messages in watch mode for\n  iterations that don't do anything useful.\n\n## [0.9.4] - 2023-01-30\n\n### Changed\n\n- It is now allowed to define a wireit script without a corresponding entry in\n  the `scripts` section. Such scripts cannot be directly invoked with `npm run\n  <script>` or similar, but they can still be used as dependencies by other\n  wireit scripts.\n\n## [0.9.3] - 2023-01-03\n\n### Fixed\n\n- In watch mode, watchers are no longer created for `package-lock.json` files\n  that don't yet exist at the time of analysis. This saves resources, and on\n  Windows should reduce errors such as\n  `EBUSY: resource busy or locked, lstat 'C:\\DumpStack.log.tmp`.\n\n## [0.9.2] - 2022-12-09\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed bug relating to services not getting shut down following an error in one\n  of its dependencies.\n- Fixed some cases of errors being logged multiple times.\n- Errors are now consistently logged immediately when they occur, instead of\n  sometimes only at the end of all execution.\n\n## [0.9.1] - 2022-12-06\n\n### Added\n\n- Added `env` setting which allows either directly assigning environment\n  variables, or indicating that an externally-provided environment variable\n  should affect the fingerprint (and hence freshness/caching). Example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"wireit\": {\n    \"bundle:prod\": {\n      \"command\": \"rollup -c\",\n      \"files\": [\"lib/**/*.js\", \"rollup.config.js\"],\n      \"output\": [\"dist/bundle.js\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"MODE\": \"prod\",\n        \"DEBUG\": {\n          \"external\": true\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## [0.9.0] - 2022-11-29\n\n### Changed\n\n- **[BREAKING]** A `watch` argument (without the `--`) is now passed to the\n  script, instead of erroring, to make it consistent with all other arguments.\n  (The error was previously repoted to aid in migration from `watch` to\n  `--watch`, which changed in `v0.6.0).\n\n- **[BREAKING]** The `.yarn/` folder has been added to the list of default\n  excluded paths.\n\n- It is now allowed to set the value of a wireit script to e.g.\n  `\"../node_modules/.bin/wireit\"` if you need to directly reference a wireit\n  binary in a specific location.\n\n- `yarn.lock` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` are now automatically used as package lock\n  files when yarn and pnpm are detected, respectively. (Previously\n  `package-lock.json` was always used unless the `packageLocks` array was\n  manually set).\n\n### Fixed\n\n- The `--watch` flag can now be passed to chained scripts when using yarn 1.x.\n  However due to https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/8905, extra arguments\n  passed after a `--` are still not supported with yarn 1.x. Please consider\n  upgrading to yarn 3.x, or switching to npm.\n\n## [0.8.0] - 2022-11-18\n\n### Added\n\n- **[BREAKING]** The following folders are now excluded by default from both the\n  `files` and `output` arrays:\n\n  - `.git/`\n  - `.hg/`\n  - `.svn/`\n  - `.wireit/`\n  - `CVS/`\n  - `node_modules/`\n\n  In the highly unusual case that you need to reference a file in one of those\n  folders, set `allowUsuallyExcludedPaths: true` to remove all default excludes.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed `Invalid string length` and `heap out of memory` errors when writing the\n  fingerprint files for large script graphs.\n\n- Fixed bug where an exclude pattern for a folder with a trailing slash would\n  not be applied (e.g. `!foo` worked but `!foo/` did not).\n\n## [0.7.3] - 2022-11-14\n\n### Added\n\n- Added `\"service\": true` setting, which is well suited for long-running\n  processes like servers. A service is started either when it is invoked directly,\n  or when another script that depends on it is ready to run. A service is stopped\n  when all scripts that depend on it have finished, or when Wireit is exited.\n\n- Added `\"cascade\": false` setting to dependencies.\n\n  By default, the fingerprint of a script includes the fingerprints of its\n  dependencies. This means a script will re-run whenever one of its dependencies\n  re-runs, even if the output produced by the dependency didn't actually change.\n\n  Now, if a dependency is annotated with `\"cascade\": false`, then the\n  fingerprint of that dependency will no longer be included in the script's own\n  fingerprint. This means a script won't neccessarily re-run just because a\n  dependency re-ran — though Wireit will still always run the dependency first\n  if it is not up-to-date.\n\n  Using `\"cascade\": false` can result in faster builds thanks to fewer re-runs,\n  but it is very important to specify all of the input files generated by the\n  dependency which the script depends on in the `files` array.\n\n  Example:\n\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"wireit\": {\n      \"build\": {\n        \"command\": \"tsc\",\n        \"files\": [\"tsconfig.json\", \"src/**/*.ts\"],\n        \"output\": \"lib/**\",\n      },\n      \"bundle\": {\n        \"command\": \"rollup -c\",\n        \"files\": [\"rollup.config.json\", \"lib/**/*.js\", \"!lib/test\"],\n        \"output\": [\"dist/bundle.js\"],\n        \"dependencies\": {\n          [\n            \"script\": \"build\",\n            \"cascade\": false\n          ]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n### Changed\n\n- Added string length > 0 requirement to the `command`, `dependencies`, `files`,\n  `output`, and `packageLocks` properties in `schema.json`.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed memory leak in watch mode.\n\n- Added graceful recovery from `ECONNRESET` and other connection errors when\n  using GitHub Actions caching.\n\n- Fixed bug where a leading slash on a `files` or `output` path was incorrectly\n  interpreted as relative to the filesystem root, instead of relative to the\n  package, in watch mode.\n\n## [0.7.2] - 2022-09-25\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed issue where a redundant extra run could be triggered in watch mode when\n  multiple scripts were watching the same file(s).\n\n### Changed\n\n- stdout color output is now forced when Wireit is run with a text terminal\n  attached.\n\n- Default number of scripts run in parallel is now 2x logical CPU cores instead\n  of 4x.\n\n## [0.7.1] - 2022-06-27\n\n### Fixed\n\n- 503 \"Service Unavailable\" HTTP errors returned by the GitHub Actions caching\n  service are no longer fatal. Instead, caching will be skipped for the\n  remainder of the Wireit run, similar to how 429 \"Too Many Requests\" errors are\n  handled.\n\n## [0.7.0] - 2022-06-17\n\n### Removed\n\n- [**Breaking**] stdout/stderr are no longer replayed. Only if a script is\n  actually running will it now produce output to those streams.\n\n## [0.6.1] - 2022-06-15\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fix out of date files from `0.6.0`.\n\n## [0.6.0] - 2022-06-15\n\n### Added\n\n- You can now pass arbitrary extra arguments to a script by setting them after a\n  double-dash, e.g. `npm run build -- --verbose`.\n\n- If you're using Yarn Berry, you can now invoke the shared instance of wireit\n  at the root of your workspace from any package's `scripts` entry:\n\n  ```json\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build\": \"yarn run -TB wireit\"\n  },\n  ```\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Yarn Berry now supports watch mode.\n\n### Changed\n\n- [**Breaking**] Watch mode is now set using `--watch` instead of `watch`, e.g.\n  `npm run build --watch`. Using the old `watch` style argument will error until\n  an upcoming release, at which point it will be sent to the underlying script,\n  consistent with how npm usually behaves.\n\n- Scripts are no longer skipped as fresh if any `output` files were changed,\n  added, or removed since the previous run.\n\n- In order for a script to be skipped as fresh, it is now required to specify\n  the `output` files. Previously only input `files` were required.\n\n## [0.5.0] - 2022-05-31\n\n### Added\n\n- It is now possible to define a script that only defines `files`. This can be\n  useful for organizing groups of shared input files that multiple scripts can\n  depend on, such as configuration files.\n\n### Changed\n\n- [**Breaking**] Setting `\"output\"` on a script that does not have a `\"command\"`\n  is now an error.\n\n- The internal `.wireit/*/state` file was renamed to `.wireit/*/fingerprint`.\n  Should have no effect.\n\n- If a script does not define a `\"command\"`, then fingerprints, lock files, and\n  cache entries are no longer written to the `.wireit` directory. This change\n  should have no user-facing effect apart from a very minor performance\n  improvement.\n\n- Analysis errors encountered in watch mode are no longer fatal. If any\n  `package.json` file that was encountered in the failed analysis was modified,\n  a new analysis attempt will start.\n\n- Performance improvements to watch mode. Re-analysis of configuration now only\n  occurs when a relevant `package.json` file was modified, instead of if any\n  file was modified. Filesystem watchers are now re-used across iterations\n  unless they are changed by a config update.\n\n## [0.4.3] - 2022-05-15\n\n### Changed\n\n- Install size decreased from 25MB to 2.4MB.\n\n- Total transitive dependencies decreased from 93 to 29.\n\n- New GitHub Actions caching implementation. Should be a drop-in replacement.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed error formatting for a missing dependency in the same package\n  that had a colon in its name. We were drawing the squiggle only under the\n  part of the dependency name after the first colon, as though it was a\n  cross-package dependency, and the part before the colon was a relative\n  path.\n\n## [0.4.2] - 2022-05-13\n\n### Added\n\n- Added `WIREIT_FAILURES` environment variable that controls what happens when a\n  script fails (meaning it returned with a non-zero exit code) with the\n  following options:\n\n  - `no-new` (default): Allow running scripts to continue, but don't start new\n    ones.\n  - `continue`: Allow running scripts to continue, and start new ones as long as\n    all of their dependencies succeeded.\n  - `kill`: Immediately kill running scripts, and don't start new ones.\n\n### Changed\n\n- Default failure mode changed from `continue` to `no-new` (see above for\n  definitions).\n\n- A distinct event is now logged when a script is killed intentionally by\n  Wireit.\n\n## [0.4.1] - 2022-05-10\n\n### Fixed\n\n- The `Running command` log message now prints immediately before the child\n  process is spawned. Previously it would print even if it was blocked by\n  parallelism contention.\n\n- Rate limit errors from GitHub Actions are no longer fatal. If it occurs, a\n  message will be logged, and caching will be disabled for the remainder of the\n  current Wireit process.\n\n### Changed\n\n- If two or more scripts depend on the same invalid config, or if they both\n  depend on a script that fails, we now only log about it once.\n\n- We continue analyzing package.json files past the first error so that we\n  can show as many potential issues as we can find.\n\n- Added an IDE analyzer interface, so that the VSCode extension can use the\n  same logic as the CLI for finding diagnostics.\n\n## [0.4.0] - 2022-05-06\n\n### Changed\n\n- [**Breaking**] A leading `/` on a `files` or `output` glob pattern is now\n  interpreted relative to the current package directory. Previously it was\n  interpreted relative to the root of the filesystem. In the case of `files`\n  (but not `output`), it is still possible to reference files outside of the\n  current package with a pattern like `../foo`.\n\n- [**Breaking**] It is now an error to try and cache an `output` file that is\n  not contained within the current package.\n\n- Starting to improve error messages by drawing squiggles underneath the\n  specific part of the `package.json` file that's in error.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- [**Breaking**] If two or more entirely separate `npm run` commands are run for\n  the same Wireit script, only one of them will now be allowed to run at a time,\n  while the others wait their turn. This restriction is removed if `output` is\n  set to an empty array.\n\n## [0.3.1] - 2022-04-30\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed `replaceAll is not a function` errors when using Node 14 on Windows.\n\n## [0.3.0] - 2022-04-29\n\n### Changed\n\n- The minimum Node version is now `14.14.0` instead of `16.0.0`.\n\n## [0.2.1] - 2022-04-27\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Added support for running scripts with [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/),\n  [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), and older versions of npm.\n\n## [0.2.0] - 2022-04-26\n\n### Added\n\n- Added support for caching on GitHub Actions. Use the\n  `google/wireit@setup-github-actions-caching/v1` action to enable.\n\n### Changed\n\n- [**Breaking**] In the `files` array, matching a directory now matches all\n  recursive contents of that directory.\n\n- [**Breaking**] The order of `!exclude` glob patterns in the `files` and\n  `output` arrays is now significant. `!exclude` patterns now only apply to the\n  patterns that precede it. This allows a file or directory to be re-included\n  after exclusion.\n\n- [**Breaking**] It is now an error to include an empty string or all-whitespace\n  string in any of these fields:\n\n  - `command`\n  - `dependencies`\n  - `files`\n  - `output`\n  - `packageLocks`\n\n- The fingerprint now additionally includes the following fields:\n\n  - The system platform (e.g. `linux`, `win32`).\n  - The system CPU architecture (e.g. `x64`).\n  - The system Node version (e.g. `16.7.0`).\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Scripts now identify their own package correctly when they are members of npm\n  workspaces, and they can be invoked from the root workspace using `-ws`\n  commands.\n\n- Give a clearer error message when run with an old npm version.\n\n- When cleaning output, directories will now only be deleted if they are empty.\n\n- When caching output, excluded files will now reliably be skipped. Previously\n  they would be copied if the parent directory was also included in the `output`\n  glob patterns.\n\n- Symlinks cached to local disk are now restored with verbatim targets, instead\n  of resolved targets.\n\n## [0.1.1] - 2022-04-08\n\n### Added\n\n- Added `WIREIT_CACHE` environment variable, which controls caching behavior.\n  Can be `local` or `none` to disable.\n\n- Added `if-file-deleted` option to the `clean` settings. In this mode,\n  `output` files are deleted if any of the input files have been deleted since\n  the last run.\n\n### Changed\n\n- In watch mode, the terminal is now cleared at the start of each run, making it\n  easier to distinguish the latest output from previous output.\n\n- In watch mode, a \"Watching for file changes\" message is now logged at the end\n  of each run.\n\n- A \"Restored from cache\" message is now logged when output was restored from\n  cache.\n\n- Caching is now disabled by default when the `CI` environment variable is\n  `true`. This variable is automatically set by GitHub Actions and Travis. The\n  `WIREIT_CACHE` environment variable takes precedence over this default.\n\n## [0.1.0] - 2022-04-06\n\n### Added\n\n- Limit the number of scripts running at any one time. By default it's 4 \\* the\n  number of CPU cores. Use the environment variable WIREIT_PARALLEL to override\n  this default. Set it to Infinity to go back to unbounded parallelism.\n\n- Added local disk caching. If a script has both its `files` and `output` arrays\n  defined, then the `output` files for each run will now be cached inside the\n  `.wireit` directory. If a script runs with the same configuration and `files`,\n  then the `output` files will be copied from the cache, instead of running the\n  script's command.\n\n### Changed\n\n- [**Breaking**] Bumped minimum Node version from `16.0.0` to `16.7.0` in order\n  to use `fs.cp`.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed bug where deleting a file would not trigger a re-run in watch mode.\n\n- Fixed bug which caused `node_modules/` binaries to not be found when crossing\n  package boundaries through dependencies.\n\n## [0.0.0] - 2022-04-04\n\n### Added\n\n- Initial release.\n\n[unreleased]: https://github.com/google/wireit/compare/v0.14.9...HEAD\n[0.14.9]: https://github.com/google/wireit/compare/v0.14.8...v0.14.9\n[0.14.8]: https://github.com/google/wireit/compare/v0.14.7...v0.14.8\n[0.14.7]: https://github.com/google/wireit/compare/v0.14.6...v0.14.7\n[0.14.6]: https://github.com/google/wireit/compare/v0.14.5...v0.14.6\n[0.14.5]: https://github.com/google/wireit/compare/v0.14.4...v0.14.5\n[0.14.4]: https://github.com/google/wireit/compare/v0.14.3...v0.14.4\n[0.14.3]: https://github.com/google/wireit/compare/v0.14.2...v0.14.3\n[0.14.2]: https://github.com/google/wireit/compare/v0.14.1...v0.14.2\n[0.14.1]: https://github.com/google/wireit/compare/v0.14.0...v0.14.1\n[0.14.0]: https://github.com/google/wireit/compare/v0.13.0...v0.14.0\n[0.13.0]: https://github.com/google/wireit/compare/v0.12.0...v0.13.0\n[0.12.0]: https://github.com/google/wireit/compare/v0.11.0...v0.12.0\n[0.11.0]: https://github.com/google/wireit/compare/v0.10.0...v0.11.0\n[0.10.0]: https://github.com/google/wireit/compare/v0.9.5...v0.10.0\n[0.9.5]: https://github.com/google/wireit/compare/v0.9.4...v0.9.5\n[0.9.4]: https://github.com/google/wireit/compare/v0.9.3...v0.9.4\n[0.9.3]: https://github.com/google/wireit/compare/v0.9.2...v0.9.3\n[0.9.2]: https://github.com/google/wireit/compare/v0.9.1...v0.9.2\n[0.9.1]: https://github.com/google/wireit/compare/v0.9.0...v0.9.1\n[0.9.0]: https://github.com/google/wireit/compare/v0.8.0...v0.9.0\n[0.8.0]: https://github.com/google/wireit/compare/v0.7.3...v0.8.0\n[0.7.3]: https://github.com/google/wireit/compare/v0.7.2...v0.7.3\n[0.7.2]: https://github.com/google/wireit/compare/v0.7.1...v0.7.2\n[0.7.1]: https://github.com/google/wireit/compare/v0.7.0...v0.7.1\n[0.7.0]: https://github.com/google/wireit/compare/v0.6.1...v0.7.0\n[0.6.1]: https://github.com/google/wireit/compare/v0.6.0...v0.6.1\n[0.6.0]: https://github.com/google/wireit/compare/v0.5.0...v0.6.0\n[0.5.0]: https://github.com/google/wireit/compare/v0.4.3...v0.5.0\n[0.4.3]: https://github.com/google/wireit/compare/v0.4.2...v0.4.3\n[0.4.2]: https://github.com/google/wireit/compare/v0.4.1...v0.4.2\n[0.4.1]: https://github.com/google/wireit/compare/v0.4.0...v0.4.1\n[0.4.0]: https://github.com/google/wireit/compare/v0.3.1...v0.4.0\n[0.3.1]: https://github.com/google/wireit/compare/v0.3.0...v0.3.1\n[0.3.0]: https://github.com/google/wireit/compare/v0.2.1...v0.3.0\n[0.2.1]: https://github.com/google/wireit/compare/v0.2.0...v0.2.1\n[0.2.0]: https://github.com/google/wireit/compare/v0.1.1...v0.2.0\n[0.1.1]: https://github.com/google/wireit/compare/v0.1.0...v0.1.1\n[0.1.0]: https://github.com/google/wireit/compare/v0.0.0...v0.1.0\n[0.0.0]: https://github.com/google/wireit/releases/tag/v0.0.0\n"

There are\njust a few small guidelines you need to follow.\n\n## Contributor License Agreement\n\nContributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License\nAgreement (CLA). You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your\ncontribution; this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your\ncontributions as part of the project. Head over to\n<https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see your current agreements on file or\nto sign a new one.\n\nYou generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one\n(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it\nagain.\n\n## Code Reviews\n\nAll submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We\nuse GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult\n[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more\ninformation on using pull requests.\n\n## Community Guidelines\n\nThis project follows\n[Google's Open Source Community Guidelines](https://opensource.google/conduct/).\n\n## Getting started\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/google/wireit.git\ncd wireit\nnpm ci\nnpm run build\n```\n\n## Running tests\n\n```sh\nnpm test\nnpm test watch\n```\n\n### Testing environment variables\n\n- `TEST_TIMEOUT`: Default millisecond timeout for test cases.\n- `SHOW_TEST_OUTPUT`: Set to show all `stdout` and `stderr` from spawned wireit\n  invocations in test cases.\n\n## Self-hosting version\n\nWireit is self-hosting: it is built and tested with itself. However, we don't\nwant to build and test with the exact same code we are editing during\ndevelopment, because if we break something, we might be unable to build or test\nat all, or we might build or test incorrectly (e.g. we might think tests passed\nwhen actually the tests didn't even run).\n\nFor this reason, we depend on the latest published version in our\n`devDependencies`, instead of running directly against source. To update this\nversion, run:\n\n```sh\nnpm upgrade wireit\n```\n"

To configure an NPM script\nfor Wireit, move the command into a new `wireit` section of your `package.json`,\nand replace the original script with the `wireit` command.\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>Before</th>\n<th>After</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<pre lang=\"json\">\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build\": \"tsc\"\n  }\n}\n</pre>\n</td>\n<td>\n<pre lang=\"json\">\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build\": \"wireit\"\n  },\n  \"wireit\": {\n    \"build\": {\n      \"command\": \"tsc\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n</pre>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\nNow when you run `npm run build`, Wireit upgrades the script to be smarter and\nmore efficient. Wireit also works with [`node --run`](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/v22-release-announce#running-packagejson-scripts), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/).\n\nYou should also add `.wireit` to your `.gitignore` file. Wireit uses the\n`.wireit` directory to store caches and other data for your scripts.\n\n```sh\necho .wireit >> .gitignore\n```\n\n## VSCode Extension\n\nIf you use VSCode, consider installing the `google.wireit` extension. It adds documentation on hover, autocomplete, can diagnose a number of common mistakes, and even suggest a refactoring to convert an npm script to use wireit.\n\nInstall it [from the marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=google.wireit) or on the command line like:\n\n```sh\ncode --install-extension google.wireit\n```\n\n## Discord\n\nJoin the [Wireit Discord](https://discord.gg/chmdAwvq4e) to chat with the Wireit community and get support for your project.\n\n[![Discord](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/1036766782867914792/widget.png?style=banner2)](https://discord.gg/chmdAwvq4e)\n\n## Dependencies\n\nTo declare a dependency between two scripts, edit the\n`wireit.<script>.dependencies` list:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build\": \"wireit\",\n    \"bundle\": \"wireit\"\n  },\n  \"wireit\": {\n    \"build\": {\n      \"command\": \"tsc\"\n    },\n    \"bundle\": {\n      \"command\": \"rollup -c\",\n      \"dependencies\": [\"build\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow when you run `npm run bundle`, the `build` script will automatically run\nfirst.\n\n### Vanilla scripts\n\nThe scripts you depend on don't need to be configured for Wireit, they can be\nvanilla `npm` scripts. This lets you only use Wireit for some of your scripts,\nor to upgrade incrementally. Scripts that haven't been configured for Wireit are\nalways safe to use as dependencies; they just won't be fully optimized.\n\n### Wireit-only scripts\n\nIt is valid to define a script in the `wireit` section that is not in the\n`scripts` section, but such scripts can only be used as `dependencies` from\nother wireit scripts, and can never be run directly.\n\n### Cross-package dependencies\n\nDependencies can refer to scripts in other npm packages by using a relative path\nwith the syntax `<relative-path>:<script-name>`. All cross-package dependencies\nshould start with a `\".\"`. Cross-package dependencies work well for npm\nworkspaces, as well as in other kinds of monorepos.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build\": \"wireit\"\n  },\n  \"wireit\": {\n    \"build\": {\n      \"command\": \"tsc\",\n      \"dependencies\": [\"../other-package:build\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Parallelism\n\nWireit will run scripts in parallel whenever it is safe to do so according to\nthe dependency graph.\n\nFor example, in this diagram, the `B` and `C` scripts will run in parallel,\nwhile the `A` script won't start until both `B` and `C` finish.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n  A-->B;\n  A-->C;\n  subgraph parallel\n    B;\n    C;\n  end\n```\n\nBy default, Wireit will run up to 2 scripts in parallel for every logical CPU\ncore detected on your system. To change this default, set the `WIREIT_PARALLEL`\n[environment variable](#environment-variable-reference) to a positive integer, or\n`infinity` to run without a limit. You may want to lower this number if you\nexperience resource starvation in large builds. For example, to run only one\nscript at a time:\n\n```sh\nexport WIREIT_PARALLEL=1\nnpm run build\n```\n\nIf two or more separate `npm run` commands are run for the same Wireit script\nsimultaneously, then only one instance will be allowed to run at a time, while\nthe others wait their turn. This prevents coordination problems that can result\nin incorrect output files being produced. If `output` is set to an empty array,\nthen this restriction is removed.\n\n## Extra arguments\n\nAs with plain npm scripts, you can pass extra arguments to a Wireit script by\nplacing a `--` double-dash argument in front of them. Any arguments after a `--`\nare sent to the underlying command, instead of being interpreted as arguments to\nnpm or Wireit:\n\n```sh\nnpm run build -- --verbose\n```\n\nOr in general:\n\n```sh\nnpm run {script} {npm args} {wireit args} -- {script args}\n```\n\nAn additional `--` is required when using `node --run` in order to distinguish\nbetween arguments intended for `node`, `wireit`, and the script itself:\n\n```sh\nnode --run {script} {node args} -- {wireit args} -- {script args}\n```\n\n## Input and output files\n\nThe `files` and `output` properties of `wireit.<script>` tell Wireit what your\nscript's input and output files are, respectively. They should be arrays of\n[glob patterns](#glob-patterns), where paths are interpreted relative to the\npackage directory. They can be set on some, all, or none of your scripts.\n\nSetting these properties allow you to use more features of Wireit:\n\n|                                             | Requires<br>`files` | Requires<br>`output` |\n| ------------------------------------------: | :-----------------: | :------------------: |\n|       [**Dependency graph**](#dependencies) |          -          |          -           |\n|               [**Watch mode**](#watch-mode) |         ☑️          |          -           |\n|         [**Clean build**](#cleaning-output) |          -          |          ☑️          |\n| [**Incremental build**](#incremental-build) |         ☑️          |          ☑️          |\n|                     [**Caching**](#caching) |         ☑️          |          ☑️          |\n\n### Example configuration\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build\": \"wireit\",\n    \"bundle\": \"wireit\"\n  },\n  \"wireit\": {\n    \"build\": {\n      \"command\": \"tsc\",\n      \"files\": [\"src/**/*.ts\", \"tsconfig.json\"],\n      \"output\": [\"lib/**\"]\n    },\n    \"bundle\": {\n      \"command\": \"rollup -c\",\n      \"dependencies\": [\"build\"],\n      \"files\": [\"rollup.config.json\"],\n      \"output\": [\"dist/bundle.js\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Default excluded paths\n\nBy default, the following folders are excluded from the `files` and `output`\narrays:\n\n- `.git/`\n- `.hg/`\n- `.svn/`\n- `.wireit/`\n- `.yarn/`\n- `CVS/`\n- `node_modules/`\n\nIn the highly unusual case that you need to reference a file in one of those\nfolders, set `allowUsuallyExcludedPaths: true` to remove all default excludes.\n\n## Incremental build\n\nWireit can automatically skip execution of a script if nothing has changed that\nwould cause it to produce different output since the last time it ran. This is\ncalled _incremental build_.\n\nTo enable incremental build, configure the input and output files for each\nscript by specifying [glob patterns](#glob-patterns) in the\n`wireit.<script>.files` and `wireit.<script>.output` arrays.\n\n> ℹ️ If a script doesn't have a `files` or `output` list defined at all, then it\n> will _always_ run, because Wireit doesn't know which files to check for\n> changes. To tell Wireit it is safe to skip execution of a script that\n> definitely has no input and/or files, set `files` and/or `output` to an empty\n> array (`files: [], output: []`).\n\n## Caching\n\nIf a script has previously succeeded with the same configuration and input\nfiles, then Wireit can copy the output from a cache, instead of running the\ncommand. This can significantly improve build and test time.\n\nTo enable caching for a script, ensure you have defined both the [`files` and\n`output`](#input-and-output-files) arrays.\n\n> ℹ️ If a script doesn't produce any output files, it can still be cached by\n> setting `output` to an empty array (`\"output\": []`). Empty output is common for\n> tests, and is useful because it allows you to skip running tests if they\n> previously passed with the exact same inputs.\n\n### Local caching\n\nIn _local_ mode, Wireit caches `output` files to the `.wireit` folder inside\neach of your packages.\n\nLocal caching is enabled by default, unless the\n[`CI=true`](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/actions/learn-github-actions/environment-variables#default-environment-variables)\nenvironment variable is detected. To force local caching, set\n`WIREIT_CACHE=local`. To disable local caching, set `WIREIT_CACHE=none`.\n\n> ⚠️ Wireit does not currently limit the size of local caches. To free up this\n> space, use `rm -rf .wireit/*/cache`. Automatic cache size limits will be added\n> in an upcoming release, tracked at\n> [wireit#71](https://github.com/google/wireit/issues/71).\n\n### GitHub Actions caching\n\nIn _[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)_ mode, Wireit caches\n`output` files to the [GitHub Actions\ncache](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows)\nservice. This service is available whenever running in GitHub Actions, and is\nfree for all GitHub users.\n\n> ℹ️ GitHub Actions cache entries are automatically deleted after 7 days, or if\n> total usage exceeds 10 GB (the least recently used cache entry is deleted\n> first). See the [GitHub Actions\n> documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows#usage-limits-and-eviction-policy)\n> for more details.\n\nTo enable caching on GitHub Actions, add the following\n[`uses`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsuses)\nclause to your workflow. It can appear anywhere before the first `npm run` or\n`npm test` command:\n\n```yaml\n- uses: google/wireit@setup-github-actions-caching/v2\n```\n\n#### Example workflow\n\n```yaml\n# File: .github/workflows/tests.yml\n\nname: Tests\non: [push, pull_request]\njobs:\n  tests:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3\n        with:\n          node-version: 18\n          cache: npm\n\n      # Set up GitHub Actions caching for Wireit.\n      - uses: google/wireit@setup-github-actions-caching/v2\n\n      # Install npm dependencies.\n      - run: npm ci\n\n      # Run tests. Wireit will automatically use\n      # the GitHub Actions cache whenever possible.\n      - run: npm test\n```\n\n## Cleaning output\n\nWireit can automatically delete output files from previous runs before executing\na script. This is helpful for ensuring that every build is clean and free from\noutdated files created in previous runs from source files that have since been\nremoved.\n\nCleaning is enabled by default as long as the\n[`output`](#input-and-output-files) array is defined. To change this behavior,\nset the `wireit.<script>.clean` property to one of these values:\n\n| Setting             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `true`              | Clean before every run (the default).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| `\"if-file-deleted\"` | Clean only if an input file has been deleted since the last run.<br><br>Use this option for tools that have incremental build support, but do not clean up outdated output when a source file has been deleted, such as `tsc --build` (see [TypeScript](#typescript) for more on this example.) |\n| `false`             | Do not clean.<br><br>Only use this option if you are certain that the script command itself already takes care of removing outdated files from previous runs.                                                                                                                                   |\n\n## Watch mode\n\nIn _watch_ mode, Wireit monitors all `files` of a script, and all `files` of its\ntransitive dependencies, and when there is a change, it re-runs only the\naffected scripts. To enable watch mode, ensure that the\n[`files`](#input-and-output-files) array is defined, and add the `--watch`\nflag:\n\n```sh\nnpm run <script> --watch\n```\n\nAn additional `--` is required when using `node --run`, otherwise Node's\nbuilt-in [watch](https://nodejs.org/docs/v20.17.0/api/cli.html#--watch) feature\nwill be triggered instead of Wireit's:\n\n```sh\nnode --run <script> -- --watch\n```\n\nThe benefit of Wireit's watch mode over the built-in watch modes of Node and other programs are:\n\n- Wireit watches the entire dependency graph, so a single watch command replaces\n  many built-in ones.\n- It prevents problems that can occur when running many separate watch commands\n  simultaneously, such as build steps being triggered before all preceding steps\n  have finished.\n\nBy default, watch mode uses whichever filesystem change API is available on your\nOS. This behavior can be changed with the `WIREIT_WATCH_STRATEGY` and\n`WIREIT_WATCH_POLL_MS` environment variables (see\n[below](#environment-variable-reference)).\n\n## Environment variables\n\nUse the `env` setting to either directly set environment variables, or to\nindicate that an externally-defined environment variable affects the behavior of\na script.\n\n### Setting environment variables directly\n\nIf a property value in the `env` object is a string, then that environment\nvariable will be set to that value when the script's `command` runs,\noverriding any value from the parent process.\n\nUnlike built-in shell environment variable syntaxes, using `env` to set\nenvironment variables works the same in macOS/Linux vs Windows, and in all\nshells.\n\n> **Note** Setting an environment variable with `env` does not apply\n> transitively through dependencies. If you need the same environment variable\n> to be set for multiple scripts, you must configure it for each of them.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"wireit\": {\n    \"my-script\": {\n      \"command\": \"my-command\",\n      \"env\": {\n        \"MY_VARIABLE\": \"my value\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Indicating external environment variables\n\nIf an environment variable affects the behavior of a script but is set\n_externally_ (i.e. it is passed to the `wireit` parent process), set the `env`\nproperty to `{\"external\": true}`. This tells Wireit that if the value of an\nenvironment variable changes across executions of a script, then its output\nshould not be re-used. You may also set a `default` value for the variable\nto use when none is provided externally.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"wireit\": {\n    \"my-script\": {\n      \"command\": \"my-command\",\n      \"env\": {\n        \"MY_VARIABLE\": {\n          \"external\": true\n        },\n        \"MY_VARIABLE_2\": {\n          \"external\": true,\n          \"default\": \"foo\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Services\n\nBy default, Wireit assumes that your scripts will eventually exit by themselves.\nThis is well suited for build and test scripts, but not for long-running\nprocesses like servers. To tell Wireit that a process is long-running and not\nexpected to exit by itself, set `\"service\": true`.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"start\": \"wireit\",\n    \"build:server\": \"wireit\"\n  },\n  \"wireit\": {\n    \"start\": {\n      \"command\": \"node my-server.js\",\n      \"service\": true,\n      \"files\": [\"my-server.js\"],\n      \"dependencies\": [\n        \"build:server\",\n        {\n          \"script\": \"../assets:build\",\n          \"cascade\": false\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    \"build:server\": {\n      ...\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Service lifetime\n\nIf a service is run _directly_ (e.g. `npm run serve`), then it will stay running\nuntil the user kills Wireit (e.g. `Ctrl-C`).\n\nIf a service is a _dependency_ of one or more other scripts, then it will start\nup before any depending script runs, and will shut down after all depending\nscripts finish.\n\n### Service readiness\n\nBy default, a service is considered _ready_ as soon as its process spawns,\nallowing any scripts that depend on that service to start.\n\nHowever, often times a service needs to perform certain actions before it is\nsafe for dependents to interact with it, such as starting a server and listening\non a network interface.\n\nUse `service.readyWhen.lineMatches` to tell Wireit to monitor the `stdout` and\n`stderr` of the service and defer readiness until a line is printed that matches\nthe given regular expression.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"command\": \"node my-server.js\",\n  \"service\": {\n    \"readyWhen\": {\n      \"lineMatches\": \"Server listening on port \\\\d+\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Service restarts\n\nIn watch mode, a service will be restarted whenever one of its input files or\ndependencies change, except for dependencies with\n[`cascade`](#execution-cascade) set to `false`.\n\n### Service output\n\nServices cannot have `output` files, because there is no way for Wireit to know\nwhen a service has finished writing its output.\n\nIf you have a service that produces output, you should define a _non-service_\nscript that depends on it, and which exits when the service's output is\ncomplete.\n\n## Execution cascade\n\nBy default, a script always needs to run (or restart in the case of\n[`services`](#services)) if any of its dependencies needed to run, _regardless\nof whether the dependency produced new or relevant output_.\n\nThis automatic _cascade_ of script execution is the default behavior because it\nensures that any _possible_ output produced by a dependent script propagates to all other\nscripts that might depend on it. In other words, Wireit does not assume that the\n`files` array completely describes the inputs to a script with dependencies.\n\n### Disabling cascade\n\nThis execution cascade behavior can be disabled by expanding a dependency into\nan object, and setting the `cascade` property to `false`:\n\n> **Note**\n> What really happens under the hood is that the `cascade` property simply controls\n> whether the [fingerprint](#fingerprint) of a script _includes the fingerprints\n> of its dependencies_, which in turn determines whether a script needs to run or restart.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"dependencies\": [\n    {\n      \"script\": \"foo\",\n      \"cascade\": false\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Reasons to disable cascade\n\nThere are two main reasons you might want to set `cascade` to `false`:\n\n1. **Your script only consumes a subset of a dependency's output.**\n\n   For example, `tsc` produces both `.js` files and `.d.ts` files, but only the\n   `.js` files might be consumed by `rollup`. There is no need to re-bundle\n   when a typings-only changed occurred.\n\n   > **Note**\n   > In addition to setting `cascade` to `false`, the subset of output that\n   > _does_ matter (`lib/**/*.js`) has been added to the `files` array.\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"scripts\": {\n       \"build\": \"wireit\",\n       \"bundle\": \"wireit\"\n     },\n     \"wireit\": {\n       \"build\": {\n         \"command\": \"tsc\",\n         \"files\": [\"src/**/*.ts\", \"tsconfig.json\"],\n         \"output\": [\"lib/**\"]\n       },\n       \"bundle\": {\n         \"command\": \"rollup -c\",\n         \"dependencies\": [\n           {\n             \"script\": \"build\",\n             \"cascade\": false\n           }\n         ],\n         \"files\": [\"rollup.config.json\", \"lib/**/*.js\"],\n         \"output\": [\"dist/bundle.js\"]\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Your server doesn't need to restart for certain changes.**\n\n   For example, a web server depends on some static assets, but the server\n   reads those assets from disk dynamically on each request. In [`watch`](#watch-mode) mode,\n   there is no need to restart the server when the assets change.\n\n   > **Note**\n   > The `build:server` dependency uses the default `cascade` behavior\n   > (`true`), because changing the implementation of the server itself _does_\n   > require the server to be restarted.\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"scripts\": {\n       \"start\": \"wireit\",\n       \"build:server\": \"wireit\"\n     },\n     \"wireit\": {\n       \"start\": {\n         \"command\": \"node lib/server.js\",\n         \"service\": true,\n         \"dependencies\": [\n           \"build:server\",\n           {\n             \"script\": \"../assets:build\",\n             \"cascade\": false\n           }\n         ],\n         \"files\": [\"lib/**/*.js\"]\n       },\n       \"build:server\": {\n         \"command\": \"tsc\",\n         \"files\": [\"src/**/*.ts\", \"tsconfig.json\"],\n         \"output\": [\"lib/**\"]\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n## Failures and errors\n\nBy default, when a script fails (meaning it returned with a non-zero exit code),\nall scripts that are already running are allowed to finish, but new scripts are\nnot started.\n\nIn some situations a different behavior may be better suited. There are 2\nadditional modes, which you can set with the `WIREIT_FAILURES` environment\nvariable. Note that Wireit always ultimately exits with a non-zero exit code if\nthere was a failure, regardless of the mode.\n\n### Continue\n\nWhen a failure occurs in `continue` mode, running scripts continue, and new\nscripts are started as long as the failure did not affect their dependencies.\nThis mode is useful if you want a complete picture of which scripts are\nsucceeding and which are failing.\n\n```bash\nWIREIT_FAILURES=continue\n```\n\n### Kill\n\nWhen a failure occurs in `kill` mode, running scripts are immediately killed,\nand new scripts are not started. This mode is useful if you want to be notified\nas soon as possible about any failures.\n\n```bash\nWIREIT_FAILURES=kill\n```\n\n## Package locks\n\nBy default, Wireit automatically treats package manager lock files as input\nfiles\n([`package-lock.json`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-lock-json)\nfor npm and `node --run`,\n[`yarn.lock`](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/yarnrc#lockfileFilename) for\nyarn, and [`pnpm-lock.yaml`](https://pnpm.io/git#lockfiles) for pnpm). Wireit\nwill look for these lock files in the script's package, and all parent\ndirectories.\n\nThis is useful because installing or upgrading your dependencies can affect the\nbehavior of your scripts, so it's important to re-run them whenever your\ndependencies change.\n\nTo change the name of the package lock file Wireit should look for, specify it\nin the `wireit.<script>.packageLocks` array. You can specify multiple filenames\nhere, if needed.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build\": \"wireit\"\n  },\n  \"wireit\": {\n    \"build\": {\n      \"command\": \"tsc\",\n      \"files\": [\"src/**/*.ts\", \"tsconfig.json\"],\n      \"output\": [\"lib/**\"],\n      \"packageLocks\": [\"another-package-manager.lock\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf you're sure that a script isn't affected by dependencies at all, you can turn\noff this behavior entirely to improve your cache hit rate by setting\n`wireit.<script>.packageLocks` to `[]`.\n\n## Recipes\n\nThis section contains advice about integrating specific build tools with Wireit.\n\n### TypeScript\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"ts\": \"wireit\"\n  },\n  \"wireit\": {\n    \"ts\": {\n      \"command\": \"tsc --build --pretty\",\n      \"clean\": \"if-file-deleted\",\n      \"files\": [\"src/**/*.ts\", \"tsconfig.json\"],\n      \"output\": [\"lib/**\", \".tsbuildinfo\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- Set [`\"incremental\": true`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#incremental) and use\n  [`--build`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/project-references.html#build-mode-for-typescript)\n  to enable incremental compilation, which significantly improves performance.\n- Include\n  [`.tsbuildinfo`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#tsBuildInfoFile) in\n  `output` so that it is reset on clean builds. Otherwise `tsc` will get out of\n  sync and produce incorrect output.\n- Set [`\"clean\": \"if-file-deleted\"`](#cleaning-output) so that you get fast\n  incremental compilation when sources are changed/added, but also stale outputs\n  are cleaned up when a source is deleted (`tsc` does not clean up stale outputs\n  by itself).\n- Include `tsconfig.json` in `files` so that changing your configuration re-runs\n  `tsc`.\n- Use [`--pretty`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#pretty) to get\n  colorful output despite not being attached to a TTY.\n\n### ESLint\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"lint\": \"wireit\"\n  },\n  \"wireit\": {\n    \"lint\": {\n      \"command\": \"eslint --color --cache --cache-location .eslintcache .\",\n      \"files\": [\"src/**/*.ts\", \".eslintignore\", \".eslintrc.cjs\"],\n      \"output\": []\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- Use\n  [`--cache`](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface#caching)\n  so that `eslint` only lints the files that were added or changed since the\n  last run, which significantly improves performance.\n- Use\n  [`--color`](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface#--color---no-color)\n  to get colorful output despite not being attached to a TTY.\n- Include config and ignore files in `files` so that changing your configuration\n  re-runs `eslint`.\n\n## Reference\n\n### Configuration\n\nThe following properties can be set inside `wireit.<script>` objects in\n`package.json` files:\n\n|

This value is\nused to determine whether a script can be skipped for [incremental\nbuild](#incremental-build), and whether its output can be [restored from\ncache](#caching).\n\n- The `command` setting.\n- The [extra arguments](#extra-arguments) set on the command-line.\n- The `clean` setting.\n- The `output` glob patterns.\n- The SHA256 content hashes of all files matching `files`.\n- The SHA256 content hashes of all files matching `packageLocks` in the current\n  package and all parent directories.\n- The environment variable values configured in `env`.\n- The system platform (e.g. `linux`, `win32`).\n- The system CPU architecture (e.g. `x64`).\n- The system Node version (e.g. `20.11.1`).\n- The fingerprint of all transitive dependencies, unless `cascade` is set to\n  `false`.\n\nWhen using [GitHub Actions caching](#github-actions-caching), the following\ninput also affects the fingerprint:\n\n- The `ImageOS` environment variable (e.g. `ubuntu20`, `macos11`).\n\n## Requirements\n\nWireit is supported on Linux, macOS, and Windows.\n\nWireit is supported on Node Current (22), Active LTS (20), and Maintenance LTS\n(18). See [Node releases](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/) for the\nschedule.\n\nWireit scripts can be launched via `npm`, `node --run`, `pnpm`, and `yarn`.\n\n## Related tools\n\nWireit shares a number of features with these other great tools, and we highly\nrecommend you check them out too:\n\n- [Nx](https://nx.dev/)\n- [Turborepo](https://turborepo.org/)\n- [Chomp](https://chompbuild.com/)\n- [Bazel](https://bazel.build/)\n\nHere are some things you might especially like about Wireit:\n\n- **Feels like npm**. When you use Wireit, you'll continue typing the same npm\n  commands you already use, like `npm run build` and `npm test`. There are no\n  new command-line tools to learn, and there's only one way to run each script.\n  Your script config stays in your `package.json`, too. Wireit is designed to be\n  the minimal addition to npm needed to get script dependencies and incremental\n  build.\n\n- **Caching with GitHub Actions**. Wireit supports caching build artifacts and\n  test results directly through GitHub Actions, without any extra third-party\n  services. Just add a single `uses:` line to your workflows.\n\n- **Watch any script**. Want to automatically re-run your build and tests\n  whenever you make a change? Type `npm test --watch`. Any script you've\n  configured using Wireit can be watched by typing `--watch` after it.\n\n- **Great for single packages and monorepos**. Wireit has no opinion about how\n  your packages are arranged. It works great with single packages, because you\n  can link together scripts within the same package. It also works great with\n  any kind of monorepo, because you can link together scripts across different\n  packages using relative paths.\n\n- **Complements npm workspaces**. We think Wireit could be the missing tool that\n  unlocks the potential for [npm\n  workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/workspaces) to become the\n  best way to set up monorepos. To use Wireit with npm workspaces, you'll just\n  use standard npm workspace commands like `npm run build -ws`.\n\n- **Adopt incrementally**. Wireit scripts can depend on plain npm scripts, so\n  they can be freely mixed. This means you can use Wireit only for the parts of\n  your build that need it most, or you can try it out on a script-by-script\n  basis without changing too much at the same time.\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)\n"
