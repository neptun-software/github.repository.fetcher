          "content": "# Changelog\n\nThis file documents all **major version** releases. For other releases, please read the [commit history](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates/commits/main).\n\n## [17.0.0] - 2024-07-31\n\n### Breaking\n\n- Require node >= 18.18.0\n- In workspaces mode, `--root` is now set by default (#1353)\n  - To **not** check the root package.json, use `--no-root`.\n- If you have a [packageManager](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#packagemanager) field in your package.json, it is now upgraded by default (#1390)\n  - Use `--dep prod,dev,optional` for the old behavior.\n\n<https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates/compare/v16.14.20...v17.0.0>\n\n## [16.0.0] - 2022-07-23\n\n### Breaking\n\n- Automatic detection of package data on stdin has been removed. This feature was deprecated in `v14.0.0`. Add `--stdin` for old behavior.\n- Wild card filters now apply to scoped packages. Previously, `ncu -f '*vite*'` would not include `@vitejs/plugin-react`. Now, filters will match any part of the package name, including the scope. Use a more specific glob or regex expression for old behavior.\n\n<https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates/compare/v15.3.4...v16.0.0>\n\n## [15.0.0] - 2022-06-30\n\n### Breaking\n\n- node >= 14.14 is now required (#1145)\n  - Needed to upgrade `update-notifier` with has a moderate severity vulnerability\n- yarn autodetect has been improved (#1148)\n  - This is a patch, though _technically_ it is breaking. In the obscure case where `--packageManager` is not given, there is no `package-lock.json` in the current folder, and there is a `yarn.lock` in an ancestor directory, npm-check-updates will now use yarn.\n  - More practically, if you needed to specify `--packageManager yarn` explicitly before, you may not have to now\n\n<https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates/compare/v14.1.1...v15.0.0>\n\n## [14.0.0] - 2022-06-16\n\n### Breaking\n\nPrerelease versions are now \"upgraded\" to versions with a different [preid](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-version#preid).\n\nFor example, if you have a dependency at `1.3.3-next.1` and the version fetched by ncu is `1.2.3-dev.2`, ncu **will** suggest an \"upgrade\" to `1.2.3-dev.2`. This is because prerelease versions with different preids are incomparable. Since they are incomparable, ncu now assumes the fetched version is desired.\n\nSince this change affects only prereleases, there is no impact on default `ncu` usage that fetches the `latest` version. With `--pre 1` or `--target newest` or `--target greatest`, this change could affect which version is suggested if versions with different preids are published. The change was made to support the new `--target @[tag]` feature.\n\nIf you have a use case where this change is not what is desired, please [report an issue](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates/issues/new). The intention is for zero disruption to current usage.\n\n### Features\n\n- You can now upgrade to a specific tag, e.g. `--target @next`. Thanks to [IMalyugin](https://github.com/IMalyugin).\n\n<https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates/compare/v13.1.5...v14.0.0>\n\n## [13.0.0] - 2022-05-15\n\n### Breaking\n\n- node >= 14 is now required\n- Several options which have long been deprecated have been removed:\n  - `--greatest` - Instead use `--target greatest`\n  - `--newest` - Instead use `--target newest`\n  - `--ownerChanged` - Instead use `--format ownerChanged`\n  - `--semverLevel` - Renamed to `--target`\n\n<https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates/compare/v12.5.12...v13.0.0>\n\n## [12.0.0] - 2021-11-01\n\n### Breaking\n\n- node >= 12 is required. Time to upgrade that old-ass server you never touch.\n- `peerDependencies` are now excluded by default. Peer dependencies should use the **lowest** possible version that works. The old behavior encouraged a bad practice of uprading peer dependencies. You can use `--dep prod,dev,optional,peer` for the old behavior ([#951](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates/issues/951)).\n- Dependencies with `>` will be converted to `>=`. The old behavior was causing upgrades to `> [latest]` which was impossible ([#957](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates/issues/957)).\n\n## Other\n\n- Typescript! There is a new build process, so if you have any issues with the executable or types, please report. It should be a non-breaking change if I did it correctly ([#888](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates/issues/888)).\n- WHen using `npm-check-updates` as a module, `vm` (versionmanager) is no longer exported. It was previously exposed for testing purposes, but was never part of the official API.\n\n<https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates/compare/v11.8.5...v12.0.0>\n\n## [11.0.0] - 2021-01-20\n\n### Breaking\n\n- `--packageFile` - Now interprets its argument as a glob pattern. It is possible that a previously supplied argument may be interepreted differently now (though I'm not aware of specific instances). Due to our conservative release policy we are releasing as a major version upgrade and allowing developers to assess for themselves.\n\n### Features\n\n- `--deep` - Run recursively in current working directory. Alias of `--packageFile '**/package.json'`.\n\nSee: [#785](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates/issues/785)\n\n<https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates/compare/v10.3.1...v11.0.0>\n\n## [10.0.0] - 2020-11-08\n\n### Breaking\n\n- Specifiying both the `--filter` option and argument filters will now throw an error. Use one or the other. Previously the arguments would override the `--filter` option, which made for a confusing result when accidentally not quoting the option in the shell. This change is only breaking for those who are relying on the incorrect behavior of argument filters overriding `--filter`.\n\nSee: [#759](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates/issues/759#issuecomment-723587297)\n\n<https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates/compare/v9.2.4...v10.0.0>\n\n## [9.0.0] - 2020-09-10\n\n### Breaking\n\n- Versions marked as `deprecated` in npm are now ignored by default. If the latest version is deprecated, the next highest non-deprecated version will be suggested. Use `--deprecated` to include deprecated versions (old behavior).\n\n<https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates/compare/v8.1.1...v9.0.0>\n\n## [8.0.0] - 2020-08-29\n\n### Breaking\n\n- `--semverLevel major` is now `--target minor`. `--semverLevel minor` is now `--target patch`. This change was made to provide more intuitive semantics for `--semverLevel` (now `--target`). Most people assumed it meant the inclusive upper bound, so now it reflects that. [a2111f4c2](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates/commits/a2111f4c2)\n- Programmatic usage: `run` now defaults to `silent: true` instead of `loglevel: 'silent`, unless `loglevel` is explicitly specified. If you overrode `silent` or `loglevel`, this may affect the logging behavior. [423e024](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates/commits/423e024)\n\n### Deprecated\n\nOptions that controlled the target version (upper bound) of upgrades have been consolidated under `--target`. The old options are aliased with a deprecation warning and will be removed in the next major version. No functionality has been removed.\n\n- `--greatest`: Renamed to `--target greatest`\n- `--newest`: Renamed to `--target newest`\n- `--semverLevel`: Renamed to `--target`\n\nSee: [7eca5bf3](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates/commits/7eca5bf3)\n\n### Features\n\n#### Doctor Mode\n\n[#722](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates/pull/722)\n\nUsage: `ncu --doctor [-u] [options]`\n\nIteratively installs upgrades and runs tests to identify breaking upgrades. Add `-u` to execute (modifies your package file, lock file, and node_modules).\n\nTo be more precise:\n\n1. Runs `npm install` and `npm test` to ensure tests are currently passing.\n2. Runs `ncu -u` to optimistically upgrade all dependencies.\n3. If tests pass, hurray!\n4. If tests fail, restores package file and lock file.\n5. For each dependency, install upgrade and run tests.\n6. When the breaking upgrade is found, saves partially upgraded package.json (not including the breaking upgrade) and exits.\n\nExample:\n\n```sh\n$ ncu --doctor -u\nnpm install\nnpm run test\nncu -u\nnpm install\nnpm run test\nFailing tests found:\n/projects/myproject/test.js:13\n  throw new Error('Test failed!')\n  ^\nNow let’s identify the culprit, shall we?\nRestoring package.json\nRestoring package-lock.json\nnpm install\nnpm install --no-save react@16.0.0\nnpm run test\n  ✓ react 15.0.0 → 16.0.0\nnpm install --no-save react-redux@7.0.0\nnpm run test\n  ✗ react-redux 6.0.0 → 7.0.0\nSaving partially upgraded package.json\n```\n\n#### Github URLs\n\nAdded support for GitHub URLs.\n\nSee: [f0aa792a4](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates/commits/f0aa792a4)\n\nExample:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"chalk\": \"https://github.com/chalk/chalk#v2.0.0\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### npm aliases\n\nAdded support for npm aliases.\n\nSee: [0f6f35c](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates/commits/0f6f35c)\n\nExample:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"request\": \"npm:postman-request@2.88.1-postman.16\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Owner Changed\n\n[#621](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates/pull/621)\n\nUsage: `ncu --ownerChanged`\n\nCheck if the npm user that published the package has changed between current and upgraded version.\n\nOutput values:\n\n- Owner changed: `*owner changed*`\n- Owner has not changed: _no output_\n- Owner information not available: `*unknown*`\n\nExample:\n\n```sh\n$ ncu --ownerChanged\nChecking /tmp/package.json\n[====================] 1/1 100%\n\n mocha  ^7.1.0  →  ^8.1.3  *owner changed*\n\nRun ncu -u to upgrade package.json\n```\n\n### Commits\n\n<https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates/compare/v7.1.1...v8.0.0>\n\n## [7.0.0] - 2020-06-09\n\n### Breaking\n\n- Removed bower support (4e4b47fd3bb567435b456906d0106ef442bf46fe)\n\n### Patch\n\n- Fix use of \"<\" with single digit versions (f04d00e550ce606893bee77b78ef2a0b2a50246a)\n\n### Other\n\n- Change eslint configuration\n- Update dependencies\n- Replace cint methods with native methods\n- Add CI via GitHub Actions workflow\n\n<https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates/compare/v6.0.2...v7.0.0>\n\n## [6.0.0] - 2020-05-14\n\n### Breaking\n\n- `--semverLevel` now supports version ranges. This is a breaking change since version ranges are no longer ignored by `--semverLevel`, which may result in some dependencies having new suggested updates.\n\nIf you are not using `--semverLevel`, NO CHANGE! 😅\n\n<https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates/compare/v5.0.0...v6.0.0>\n\n## [5.0.0] - 2020-05-11\n\n### Breaking\n\n~node >= 8~\nnode >= 10.17\n\nBump minimum node version to `v10.17.0` due to `move-file` #651\n\nIf `ncu` was working for you on `v4.x`, then `v5.0.0` will still work. Just doing a major version bump since ncu's officially supported node version is changing. `v4` should be patched to be compatible with node `v8`, but I'll hold off unless someone requests it.\n\n<https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates/compare/v4.1.2...v5.0.0>\n\n## [4.0.0] - 2019-12-10\n\nncu v3 excluded prerelease versions (`-alpha`, `-beta`, etc) from the remote by default, as publishing prerelease versions to `latest` is unconventional and not recommended. Prereleases versions can be included by specifying `--pre` (and is implied in options `--greatest` and `--newest`).\n\nHowever, when you are already specifying a prerelease version in your package.json dependencies, then clearly you want ncu to find newer prerelease versions. This is now default in v4, albeit with the conservative approach of sticking to the `latest` tag.\n\n### Migration\n\nNo effect for most users.\n\nIf a prerelease version is published on the `latest` tag, and you specify a prerelease version in your package.json, ncu will now suggest upgrades for it.\n\nIf a prerelease version is published on a different tag, there is no change from ncu v3; you will still need `--pre`, `--greatest`, or `--newest` to get prerelease upgrades.\n\n<https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates/compare/v3.2.2...v4.0.0>\n\n## [3.0.0] - 2019-03-07\n\n### Breaking\n\n#### node < 8 deprecated\n\nThe required node version has been updated to allow the use of newer Javascript features and reduce maintenance efforts for old versions.\n\n#### System npm used\n\nIn ncu v2, an internally packaged npm was used for version lookups. When this became out-of-date and differed considerably from the system npm problems would occur. In ncu v3, the system-installed npm will be used for all lookups. This comes with the maintenance cost of needing to upgrade ncu whenever the output format of npm changes.\n\n#### Installed modules ignored\n\nIn ncu v2, out-of-date dependencies in package.json that were installed up-to-date (e.g. `^1.0.0` specified and `1.0.1` installed) were ignored by ncu. Installed modules are now completely ignored and ncu only consider your package.json. This change was made to better match users’ expectations.\n\n#### Existing version ranges that satisfy latest are ignored (-a by default)\n\nIn ncu v2, if you had `^1.0.0` in your package.json, a newly released `1.0.1` would be ignored by ncu. The logic was that `^1.0.0` is a range that includes `1.0.1`, so you don’t really need to change the version specified in your package.json, you just need to run `npm update`. While logical, that turned out to be quite confusing to users. In ncu v3, the package.json will always be upgraded if there is a newer version (same as `-a` in v2). The old default behavior is available via the `--minimal` option.\n\n#### Prerelease versions ignored\n\nIn ncu v2, any version published to the `latest` tag was assumed to be a stable release version. In practice, occasional package authors would accidentally or unconventionally publish `-alpha`, `-beta`, and `-rc` versions to the `latest` tag. While I still consider this a bad practice, ncu v3 now ignores these prerelease versions by default to better match users’ expectations. The old behavior is available via the `--pre 1` option. (When `--newest` or `--greatest` are set, `--pre 1` is set by default, and can be disabled with `--pre 0`).\n\n#### Options changed: `-m`, `--prod`, `--dev`, `--peer`\n\nIn order to only target one or more dependency sections, ncu now uses the `--dep` option instead of separate options for each section.\n\n`--prod` is now `--dep prod`\n`--dev` is now `--dep dev`\n`--dev --peer` is now `--dep dev,peer` etc\n\nThe `--packageManager` alias has changed from `-m` to `-p` to make room for `--minimal` as `-m`.\n\n<https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates/compare/v2.15.0...v3.0.0>\n\n## [2.0.0] - 2005-08-14\n\nv2 has a few important differences from v1:\n\n- Newer published versions that satisfy the specified range are _not_ upgraded by default (e.g. `1.0.0` to `1.1.0`). This change was made because `npm update` handles upgrades within the satisfied range just fine, and npm-check-updates is primarily intended to provide functionality not otherwise provided by npm itself. These satisfied dependencies will still be shown when you run npm-check-updates, albeit with a short explanation. **For the old behavior, add the -ua/--upgradeAll option.**\n- The command-line argument now specifies a package name filter (e.g. `ncu /^gulp-/`). For the old behavior (specifying an alternative package.json), pipe the package.json through stdin.\n- Use the easier-to-type `ncu` instead of `npm-check-updates`. `npm-check-updates` is preserved for backwards-compatibility.\n- Allow packageData to be specified as an option\n- Colored table output\n- Add -a/--upgradeAll\n- Add -e/--error-level option\n- Add -j/--json and --jsonFlat flags for json output\n- Add -r/--registry option for specifying third-party npm registry\n- Add -t/--greatest option to search for the highest versions instead of the default latest stable versions.\n- Remove -f/--filter option and move to command-line argument\n- Replace < and <= with ^\n- Automatically look for the closest descendant package.json if not found in current directory\n- Add ncu alias\n- Export functionality to allow for programmatic use\n- Bug fixes and refactoring\n- Full unit test coverage!\n\n<https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates/compare/v1.5.1...v2.0.0>\n"

Run `npm install` to update your installed packages and package-lock.json.\n- sensible defaults, but highly customizable\n- compatible with npm, yarn, pnpm, deno, and bun\n- CLI and module usage\n\n<img width=\"500\" alt=\"example output\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4808618b-ac20-4fc0-92e0-a777de70a2b6\">\n\n$${\\color{red}Red}$$ major upgrade (and all [major version zero](https://semver.org/#spec-item-4))<br/>\n$${\\color{cyan}Cyan}$$ minor upgrade<br/>\n$${\\color{green}Green}$$ patch upgrade<br/>\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall globally to use `npm-check-updates` or the shorter `ncu`:\n\n```sh\nnpm install -g npm-check-updates\n```\n\nOr run with [npx](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npx) (only the long form is supported):\n\n```sh\nnpx npm-check-updates\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nCheck the latest versions of all project dependencies:\n\n```sh\n$ ncu\nChecking package.json\n[====================] 5/5 100%\n\n eslint             7.32.0  →    8.0.0\n prettier           ^2.7.1  →   ^3.0.0\n svelte            ^3.48.0  →  ^3.51.0\n typescript         >3.0.0  →   >4.0.0\n untildify          <4.0.0  →   ^4.0.0\n webpack               4.x  →      5.x\n\nRun ncu -u to upgrade package.json\n```\n\nUpgrade a project's package file:\n\n> **Make sure your package file is in version control and all changes have been committed. This _will_ overwrite your package file.**\n\n```sh\n$ ncu -u\nUpgrading package.json\n[====================] 1/1 100%\n\n express           4.12.x  →   4.13.x\n\nRun npm install to install new versions.\n\n$ npm install      # update installed packages and package-lock.json\n```\n\nCheck global packages:\n\n```sh\nncu -g\n```\n\n## Interactive Mode\n\nChoose which packages to update in interactive mode:\n\n```sh\nncu --interactive\nncu -i\n```\n\n![ncu --interactive](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/750276/175337598-cdbb2c46-64f8-44f5-b54e-4ad74d7b52b4.png)\n\nCombine with `--format group` for a truly _luxe_ experience:\n\n![ncu --interactive --format group](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/750276/175336533-539261e4-5cf1-458f-9fbb-a7be2b477ebb.png)\n\n## Filter packages\n\nFilter packages using the `--filter` option or adding additional cli arguments:\n\n```sh\n# upgrade only mocha\nncu mocha\nncu -f mocha\nncu --filter mocha\n\n# upgrade only chalk, mocha, and react\nncu chalk mocha react\nncu chalk, mocha, react\nncu -f \"chalk mocha react\"\n```\n\nFilter with wildcards or regex:\n\n```sh\n# upgrade packages that start with \"react-\"\nncu react-*\nncu \"/^react-.*$/\"\n```\n\nExclude specific packages with the `--reject` option or prefixing a filter with `!`. Supports strings, wildcards, globs, comma-or-space-delimited lists, and regex:\n\n```sh\n# upgrade everything except nodemon\nncu \\!nodemon\nncu -x nodemon\nncu --reject nodemon\n\n# upgrade packages that do not start with \"react-\".\nncu \\!react-*\nncu '/^(?!react-).*$/' # mac/linux\nncu \"/^(?!react-).*$/\" # windows\n```\n\nAdvanced filters: [filter](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates#filter), [filterResults](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates#filterresults), [filterVersion](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates#filterversion)\n\n## How dependency updates are determined\n\n- Direct dependencies are updated to the latest stable version:\n  - `2.0.1` → `2.2.0`\n  - `1.2` → `1.3`\n  - `0.1.0` → `1.0.1`\n- Range operators are preserved and the version is updated:\n  - `^1.2.0` → `^2.0.0`\n  - `1.x` → `2.x`\n  - `>0.2.0` → `>0.3.0`\n- \"Less than\" is replaced with a wildcard:\n  - `<2.0.0` → `^3.0.0`\n  - `1.0.0 < 2.0.0` → `^3.0.0`\n- \"Any version\" is preserved:\n  - `*` → `*`\n- Prerelease versions are ignored by default.\n  - Use `--pre` to include prerelease versions (e.g. `alpha`, `beta`, `build1235`)\n- Choose what level to upgrade to:\n  - With `--target semver`, update according to your specified [semver](https://semver.org/) version ranges:\n    - `^1.1.0` → `^1.9.99`\n  - With `--target minor`, strictly update the patch and minor versions (including major version zero):\n    - `0.1.0` → `0.2.1`\n  - With `--target patch`, strictly update the patch version (including major version zero):\n    - `0.1.0` → `0.1.2`\n  - With `--target @next`, update to the version published on the `next` tag:\n    - `0.1.0` -> `0.1.1-next.1`\n\n## Options\n\nOptions are merged with the following precedence:\n\n1. Command line options\n2. Local [Config File](#config-file)\n3. Project Config File\n4. User Config File\n\nOptions that take no arguments can be negated by prefixing them with `--no-`, e.g. `--no-peer`.\n\n<!-- BEGIN Options -->\n<!-- Do not edit this section by hand.

Automatically used if bun.lock or bun.lockb is present.</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n## peer\n\nUsage:\n\n    ncu --peer\n    ncu --no-peer\n\nCheck peer dependencies of installed packages and filter updates to compatible versions.\n\nExample:\n\nThe following example demonstrates how `--peer` works, and how it uses peer dependencies from upgraded modules.\n\nThe package ncu-test-peer-update has two versions published:\n\n- 1.0.0 has peer dependency `\"ncu-test-return-version\": \"1.0.x\"`\n- 1.1.0 has peer dependency `\"ncu-test-return-version\": \"1.1.x\"`\n\nOur test app has the following dependencies:\n\n    \"ncu-test-peer-update\": \"1.0.0\",\n    \"ncu-test-return-version\": \"1.0.0\"\n\nThe latest versions of these packages are:\n\n    \"ncu-test-peer-update\": \"1.1.0\",\n    \"ncu-test-return-version\": \"2.0.0\"\n\nWith `--peer`:\n\nncu upgrades packages to the highest version that still adheres to the peer dependency constraints:\n\n    ncu-test-peer-update     1.0.0  →  1.1.0\n    ncu-test-return-version  1.0.0  →  1.1.0\n\nWithout `--peer`:\n\nAs a comparison: without using the `--peer` option, ncu will suggest the latest versions, ignoring peer dependencies:\n\n    ncu-test-peer-update     1.0.0  →  1.1.0\n    ncu-test-return-version  1.0.0  →  2.0.0\n\n## registryType\n\nUsage:\n\n    ncu --registryType [type]\n\nSpecify whether `--registry` refers to a full npm registry or a simple JSON file.\n\n<table>\n  <tr><td>npm</td><td>Default npm registry</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>json</td><td>Checks versions from a file or url to a simple JSON registry. Must include the `--registry` option.\n\nExample:\n\n    // local file\n    $ ncu --registryType json --registry ./registry.json\n\n    // url\n    $ ncu --registryType json --registry https://api.mydomain/registry.json\n\n    // you can omit --registryType when the registry ends in .json\n    $ ncu --registry ./registry.json\n    $ ncu --registry https://api.mydomain/registry.json\n\nregistry.json:\n\n    {\n      \"prettier\": \"2.7.1\",\n      \"typescript\": \"4.7.4\"\n    }\n\n</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n## reject\n\nUsage:\n\n    ncu --reject [p]\n    ncu -x [p]\n\nThe inverse of `--filter`. Exclude package names matching the given string, wildcard, glob, comma-or-space-delimited list, /regex/, or predicate function. This will also exclude them from the `--peer` check.\n\n`--reject` runs _before_ new versions are fetched, in contrast to `--filterResults` which runs _after_.\n\nThe predicate function is only available in .ncurc.js or when importing npm-check-updates as a module, not on the command line.\n\n```js\n/**\n  @param name     The name of the dependency.\n  @param semver   A parsed Semver array of the current version.\n    (See: https://git.coolaj86.com/coolaj86/semver-utils.js#semverutils-parse-semverstring)\n  @returns        True if the package should be excluded, false if it should be included.\n*/\nrejectFunction: (name, semver) => {\n  if (name.startsWith('@myorg/')) {\n    return true\n  }\n  return false\n}\n```\n\n## rejectVersion\n\nUsage:\n\n    ncu --rejectVersion [p]\n\nThe inverse of `--filterVersion`. Exclude versions matching the given string, wildcard, glob, comma-or-space-delimited list, /regex/, or predicate function.\n\n`--rejectVersion` runs _before_ new versions are fetched, in contrast to `--filterResults` which runs _after_.\n\nThe predicate function is only available in .ncurc.js or when importing npm-check-updates as a module, not on the command line. This function is an alias for the reject option function.\n\n```js\n/**\n  @param name     The name of the dependency.\n  @param semver   A parsed Semver array of the current version.\n    (See: https://git.coolaj86.com/coolaj86/semver-utils.js#semverutils-parse-semverstring)\n  @returns        True if the package should be excluded, false if it should be included.\n*/\nrejectVersionFunction: (name, semver) => {\n  if (name.startsWith('@myorg/') && parseInt(semver[0]?.major) > 5) {\n    return true\n  }\n  return false\n}\n```\n\n## target\n\nUsage:\n\n    ncu --target [value]\n    ncu -t [value]\n\nDetermines the version to upgrade to. (default: \"latest\")\n\n<table>\n  <tr><td>greatest</td><td>Upgrade to the highest version number published, regardless of release date or tag. Includes prereleases.</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>latest</td><td>Upgrade to whatever the package's \"latest\" git tag points to. Excludes prereleases unless --pre is specified.</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>minor</td><td>Upgrade to the highest minor version without bumping the major version.</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>newest</td><td>Upgrade to the version with the most recent publish date, even if there are other version numbers that are higher. Includes prereleases.</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>patch</td><td>Upgrade to the highest patch version without bumping the minor or major versions.</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>semver</td><td>Upgrade to the highest version within the semver range specified in your package.json.</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>@[tag]</td><td>Upgrade to the version published to a specific tag, e.g. 'next' or 'beta'.</td></tr>\n</table>\n\nYou can also specify a custom function in your .ncurc.js file, or when importing npm-check-updates as a module:\n\n```js\n/** Upgrade major version zero to the next minor version, and everything else to latest.\n  @param name     The name of the dependency.\n  @param semver   A parsed Semver object of the upgraded version.\n    (See: https://git.coolaj86.com/coolaj86/semver-utils.js#semverutils-parse-semverstring)\n  @returns        One of the valid target values (specified in the table above).\n*/\ntarget: (name, semver) => {\n  if (parseInt(semver[0]?.major) === '0') return 'minor'\n  return 'latest'\n}\n```\n\n<!-- END Advanced Options -->\n\n## Config File\n\nUse a `.ncurc.{json,yml,js,cjs}` file to specify configuration information.\nYou can specify the file name and path using `--configFileName` and `--configFilePath`\ncommand line options.\n\nFor example, `.ncurc.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"upgrade\": true,\n  \"filter\": \"svelte\",\n  \"reject\": [\"@types/estree\", \"ts-node\"]\n}\n```\n\nIf you write `.ncurc` config files using json or yaml, you can add the JSON Schema to your IDE settings for completions.\n\ne.g. for VS Code:\n\n```json\n  \"json.schemas\": [\n    {\n      \"fileMatch\": [\n        \".ncurc\",\n        \".ncurc.json\",\n      ],\n      \"url\": \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates/main/src/types/RunOptions.json\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"yaml.schemas\": {\n    \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates/main/src/types/RunOptions.json\": [\n        \".ncurc.yml\",\n    ]\n  },\n```\n\n## Module/Programmatic Usage\n\nnpm-check-updates can be imported as a module:\n\n```js\nimport ncu from 'npm-check-updates'\n\nconst upgraded = await ncu.run({\n  // Pass any cli option\n  packageFile: '../package.json',\n  upgrade: true,\n  // Defaults:\n  // jsonUpgraded: true,\n  // silent: true,\n})\n\nconsole.log(upgraded) // { \"mypackage\": \"^2.0.0\", ... }\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are happily accepted.
