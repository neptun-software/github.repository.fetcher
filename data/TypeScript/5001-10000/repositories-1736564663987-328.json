Correction\n\n**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed\nunprofessional or unwelcome in the community.\n\n**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing\nclarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the\nbehavior was inappropriate.

Please take a moment to review the following:\n\n## Style Guide\n\n- **Commits** follow the [\"Conventional Commits\" specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). This allows for changelogs to be generated automatically upon release.\n- **Code** is formatted via [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)\n- **JavaScript** is written as [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) where possible.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Setup\n\n1. [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) and clone to your machine.\n2. Create a new branch with your contribution.\n3. In the repo, prior to any other installation steps, run:\n   ```sh\n   corepack enable\n   ```\n4. Install dependencies:\n   ```sh\n   pnpm i\n   ```\n5. Voilà, you're ready to go!\n\n### Scripts\n\n- `pnpm dev` – runs vitest, watching for file changes\n- `pnpm build` – production build\n- `pnpm tsc` – type checks\n- `pnpm test`\n\n## Releases\n\nA trade-off with using a personal repo is that permissions are fairly locked-down. In the mean-time releases will be made manually by the project owner.\n"
