          "content": "# Contributing to DogeHouse\n> Please read the [PRIORITY LIST](https://github.com/benawad/dogehouse/issues/1969) before contributing.\n\nWe love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:\n- Reporting an issue\n- Discussing the current state of the code\n- Submitting a fix\n- Proposing new features\n- Becoming a maintainer\n\n## Code of Conduct\nThe code of conduct is described in [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n## Our Development Process\nAll changes happen through pull requests. Pull requests are the best way to propose changes. We actively welcome your pull requests and invite you to submit pull requests directly [here](https://github.com/benawad/dogehouse/pulls), and after review, these can be merged into the project.\n\n## Using the Project's Standard Commit Messages\nThis project is using the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/) standard. Please follow these steps to ensure your\ncommit messages are standardized:\n1. Make sure your shell path is in the root of the project (not inside any of the packages).\n2. Run `yarn`.\n3. Stage the files you are committing with `git add [files]`.\n4. Run `yarn commit`. This will start an interactive prompt that generates your commit message:\n    1. Select the type of change.\n    2. Type the scope. This is either `global` for project-wide changes or one of the packages (kibbeh, shawarma etc.).\n    3. Write a short, imperative tense description of the change.\n    4. If the above was not sufficient, you may now write a longer description of your change (otherwise press enter to leave blank).\n    5. y or n for whether there are any breaking changes (e.g. changing the props of a component, changing the JSON structure of an API response).\n    6. y or n for whether this change affects an open issue, if positive you will be prompted to enter the issue number.\n5. Your commit message has now been created, you may push to your fork and open a pull request (read below for further instructions).\n\n## Pull Requests\n1. Fork the repo and create your branch (usually named `patch-%the number of PRs you've already made%`) from `staging`.\n2. If you've added code that should be tested, add some test examples.\n3. Ensure to describe your pull request.\n\n## Adding Emojis\nEmojis need to be 28x28px. To add an emoji, add the png/gif image to public/emojis and add the emoji to the `kofta/src/app/modules/room-chat/EmoteData.ts`.\n\nTo avoid conflicts please add the emojis to the top of the file.\n> **NOTE:** We are not accepting new emojis atm\n\n\n## Quickstart Local Frontend Development\nDo this if you only want to do React stuff and don't want to touch Elixir:\n\n### UI *(react + next.js)*:\nNavigate to `/kibbeh`\n\n- Run `yarn`\n- Run `yarn staging` (this tells React to connect to a hosted version of the backend for development purposes).\n- Read `kibbeh/README.md` for more information and fixes for known development issues.\n> **NOTE:** Please follow the [design guidelines](https://github.com/benawad/dogehouse/blob/staging/DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md) and [figma mockups](https://www.figma.com/file/CS01VVLR7ArQl0afYFkNj3/Web-App) and if what you're trying to do isn't in there, consult [@ajmnz](https://github.com/ajmnz)/[@benawad](https://github.com/benawad) beforehand.\n\n## Translating\n1. Fork the [repository](https://github.com/benawad/dogehouse \"benawad/dogehouse\") (click on `fork` in the top right corner of the screen)\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/RB4FVS0/Screenshot-2021-05-07-152827.jpg)\n\n2. In the forked repository, navigate to `kibbeh/public/locales` and then choose your language and open the `translation.json` file\n3. Click on `edit` in the top right corner of the window\n\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/vZjt4jD/Screenshot-2021-05-07-153427.jpg)\n\n4. Make the changes in the translation(make sure you are using the correct json syntax)\n5. click `commit changes` in the bottom of the page and add `fix(kibbeh): update {my language} Translation` as the commit message(`fix` if you are fixing tranlsations and `feat` if you are adding a language)(leave the description empty!)\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68110106/117442435-6e1b1080-af3f-11eb-990f-9a1a270fef29.png)\n6. Go to the [main page of the repository](https://github.com/benawad/dogehouse) and under `Contribute`, click on `Open Pull Request`\n\n## Supporting translation in new components\n1. Add your translation key into the English `translation.json` located in `kibbeh/public/locales/en/translation.json`. Make sure it is put in an appropriate section that makes sense.\n2. Run `yarn i18`. This will sync all fields in all languages, if field doesn't exist it will copy it over from `en`.\n3. Use your translation key in your code. This is done by using `useTypeSafeTranslation` like this: `const { t } = useTypeSafeTranslation();`. You can now call `t` and get your desired translation key.\n\n## Devcontainer Full Local Development\nFor VSCode users, we're able to use devcontainers which allows you to create development environments that already have all the tools and services configured and ready to go.\n\n### Usage\n\n_Prerequisite: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install) on your local environment._\n\nTo get started, read and follow the instructions in [Developing inside a Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers). The [.devcontainer/](./.devcontainer) directory contains pre-configured `devcontainer.json`, `docker-compose.yml` and `Dockerfile` files, which you can use to set up remote development within a docker container.\n\n- Install the [Remote - Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension.\n- Open VSCode and bring up the [Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette).\n- Type `Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container`, this will build the container with Elixir and Node installed, this will also start Postgres and RabbitMQ instances.\n\n> If you need to modify environment variables for kousa, you need to modify them inside `/home/doge/.bashrc` and restart your terminal.\n\n### Run\n#### `kousa`\n```shell\n$ mix deps.get\n$ mix ecto.migrate\n$ iex -S mix\n```\n#### `shawarma`\n```shell\n$ yarn\n$ yarn build\n$ yarn start\n```\n#### `kibbeh`\n```shell\n$ yarn\n$ yarn dev\n```\n\n## Manual Full Local Development\nHow to run locally:\n\n### Backend\n#### RabbitMQ\nInstall RabbitMQ:\n- **macOS**: Run `brew install rabbitmq`.\n- **Windows**: Run `choco install rabbitmq`.\n- **Linux**: Follow their installation guide [here](https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html).\n\nStart RabbitMQ\n- **macOS**: Run `brew services start rabbitmq`.\n- **Windows**: Setup guide [here](https://www.rabbitmq.com/install-windows.html).\n- **Linux**: Setup guide [here](https://www.rabbitmq.com/install-debian.html).\n\n#### PostgreSQL\nInstall PostgreSQL:\n- **macOS**: Run `brew install postgresql`.\n- **Windows**: Follow [this](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/install-postgresql/) guide.\n- **Linux**: Follow [this](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/install-postgresql-linux/) guide.\n\nStart PostgreSQL:\n- **macOS**: Run `brew services start postgresql`.\n- **Windows**: Start PostgreSQL through the control panel or run `net start postgresql-{version}`.\n- **Linux**: Run `/etc/rc.d/init.d/postgresql start`.\n\nCreate a DB named `kousa_repo2`:\n\n```shell\n$ psql postgres\n\n$ CREATE DATABASE kousa_repo2;\n```\n\n#### Elixir\nElixir installation guide [here](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html).\n\n#### `kousa`\nNavigate to `/kousa` and set the following environment variables:\n```\nexport DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost/kousa_repo2\nexport BEN_GITHUB_ID=7872329\nexport RABBITMQ_URL=amqp://user:password@yourinternalip:5672\nexport ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=\nexport REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=\nexport GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=\nexport TWITTER_API_KEY=\nexport TWITTER_SECRET_KEY=\nexport TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN=\nexport GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=\nexport SENTRY_DNS=\nexport API_URL=http://localhost:4001\nexport WEB_URL=http://localhost:3000\nexport PORT=4001\nexport DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=\nexport DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=\n```\n\n> You can save these variables in a `.txt` and run `source path/to/file.txt`\n\nRun the following commands:\n```shell\n$ mix deps.get\n$ mix ecto.migrate\n```\n\nStart the server\n```shell\n$ iex -S mix\n```\n\n#### `shawarma`\nNavigate to `/shawarma` and run `yarn`.\n\n> Mediasoup requires `node >=0.8 <=14` and has [specific requirements](https://mediasoup.org/documentation/v3/mediasoup/installation/#windows) on Windows.\n\nCreate an `.env` file and set the following environment variable:\n\n```\nWEBRTC_LISTEN_IP=127.0.0.1\n```\n\nThen run `yarn build` and `yarn start`.\n\n## Issues\n> NOTE: If your bug is a **security vulnerability**, please instead see the [security policy](https://github.com/benawad/dogehouse/security/policy)\n\nWe use GitHub issues to track public bugs.

Tested\nversions that are stable will be promoted into `stable` in the future.\n\n## DogeReviewers\n\nContributors helping to review/merge pull requests:\n\n- [@HarrisonMayotte](https://github.com/HarrisonMayotte)\n- [@TheOtterlord](https://github.com/TheOtterlord)\n- [@amitojsingh366](https://github.com/amitojsingh366)\n- [@dk-raw](https://github.com/dk-raw)\n- [@ermalsh](https://github.com/ermalsh)\n- [@goldyydev](https://github.com/goldyydev)\n- [@jamesql](https://github.com/jamesql)\n- [@nadirabbas](https://github.com/nadirabbas)\n- [@ofsho](https://github.com/ofsho)\n- [@overlisted](https://github.com/overlisted)\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nPlease read [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/benawad/dogehouse/blob/staging/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for details on our code of conduct.\n\n## How to run locally\n\nCheck <a href=\"https://github.com/benawad/dogehouse/blob/staging/CONTRIBUTING.md#quickstart-local-frontend-development\">here</a> on how to run locally</a>\n\n## Why did you make this?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy-EhJ_tTQo\n\n## Attribution\n\nFor emojis, we use [Twemoji](https://twemoji.twitter.com/)\n"
