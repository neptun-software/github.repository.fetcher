          "content": "# Contributing to OpenCTI\n\nThank you for reading this documentation and considering making your contribution to the project. Any contribution that helps us improve the platform is valuable and much appreciated. If it is also meaningful to you or your organisation it’s all for the best.\n\nIn order to help you understand the project, where we are heading and how you can contribute, below are several resources and answers.\n\nDo not hesitate to shoot us an [email](mailto:contact@opencti.io) or join us on our [Slack channel](https://community.filigran.io). Most of the articles below are an introduction for our [detailed documentation](https://docs.opencti.io/latest/).\n\n\n## Why contribute?\n\nOpenCTI is an open source project aiming at building a platform for threat intelligence analysts, allowing them to capitalise, structure, organise and visualise amounts of information. It allows analysts to leverage knowledge from these information while keeping track of each and every source of information (if you want to know more about OpenCTI, you can read the [detailed documentation]https://docs.opencti.io/latest/) or try it on the [demonstration platform](https://demo.opencti.io/)).\n\nWhether you are an organisation or an individual working or studying in the field of cybersecurity and cyberdefense, or simply as an individual looking for a technical challenge, contributing to the OpenCTI project may represent a great opportunity for you.\n\n* You can help grow the community and a tool focused on improving the understanding of cyberthreats and therefore enhancing our capability of better protecting our organisations and societies.\n\n* You will be able to adapt the tool to your core interests and methods of work by developing features or fixing bugs you are most interested in.\n\n* OpenCTI is also an interesting opportunity for developers to work on new technologies such as graph technologies.\n\n\n## Where is the project heading?\n\nNow that the first version of the tool has been released, our goal for the future releases is two-fold:\n\n* Of course, fix bugs and develop features which are identify as non-critical but would really add-up to OpenCTI power.\n\n* On a longer term vision, we would like to develop a multi-layered approach in the platform, which would be divided in three strata: a strategic level (for information about actors), a kill chain level (with the different steps of the attack chain) and an infrastructure level (containing data on the infrastructure used by the attacker).\n\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nOpenCTI has adopted a Code of Conduct that we expect project participants to adhere to. Please read the [full text](https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/opencti/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) so that you can understand which actions will and will not be tolerated.\n\n\n## How can you contribute?\n\nAny contribution is appreciated, and many don’t imply coding. Contributions can range from a suggestion for improving documentation, requesting a new feature, reporting a bug, to developing features or fixing bugs yourself.\n\nFor general suggestions or questions about the project or the documentation, you can open an issue on the repository with the label \"question\". We will answer as soon as possible. If you do not wish to publish on the repository, please see the section below [**\"How can you get in touch for other questions?\"**](#howcanyougetintouchforotherquestions).\n\n* Just using OpenCTI and opening issues if everything is not working as expect will be a huge step forward. See our section about opening an issue. To report a bug, please refer to the [bug reporting module](https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/opencti/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=). To suggest a new feature, please fill in the feature request [form](https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/opencti/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=).\n\n* Don’t hesitate to flag us an issue with the documentation or the templates if you find them incomplete or not clear enough. You can do that either by opening a [bug report](https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/opencti/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=) or by sending us a message on our [Slack channel](https://community.filigran.io).\n\n* You can look through opened issues and help triage them (ask for more information, suggest workarounds, suggest label, flag issues etc.)\n\n* If you are interested in contributing to developing OpenCTI, please refer to the [detailed documentation](https://docs.opencti.io/latest/). It can be either a to fix an issue which is meaningful to you, or to develop a feature requested by others.\n\n* All commits messages must be formatted as: `[component] Message (#issuenumber)` where component should be:\n  * api\n  * frontend\n  * worker\n  * doc\n\n### How can you get in touch for other questions?\n\nIf you need support or you wish to engage a discussion about the OpenCTI platform, feel free to join us on our [Slack channel](https://community.filigran.io). You can also send us an [email](mailto:contact@opencti.io).\n"

It has been created in order to structure, store, organize and visualize technical and non-technical information about cyber threats.\n\nThe structuration of the data is performed using a knowledge schema based on the [STIX2 standards](https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/). It has been designed as a modern web application including a [GraphQL API](https://graphql.org) and an UX oriented frontend. Also, OpenCTI can be integrated with other tools and applications such as [MISP](https://github.com/MISP/MISP), [TheHive](https://github.com/TheHive-Project/TheHive), [MITRE ATT&CK](https://github.com/mitre/cti), etc.\n\n![Screenshot](./.github/img/screenshot.png \"Screenshot\")\n\n## Objective\n\nThe goal is to create a comprehensive tool allowing users to capitalize technical (such as TTPs and observables) and non-technical information (such as suggested attribution, victimology etc.) while linking each piece of information to its primary source (a report, a MISP event, etc.), with features such as links between each information, first and last seen dates, levels of confidence, etc. The tool is able to use the [MITRE ATT&CK framework](https://attack.mitre.org) (through a [dedicated connector](https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/connectors)) to help structure the data. The user can also choose to implement their own datasets.\n\nOnce data has been capitalized and processed by the analysts within OpenCTI, new relations may be inferred from existing ones to facilitate the understanding and the representation of this information. This allows the user to extract and leverage meaningful knowledge from the raw data.\n\nOpenCTI not only allows [imports](https://docs.opencti.io/latest/usage/import-automated/) but also [exports of data](https://docs.opencti.io/latest/usage/feeds/) under different formats (CSV, STIX2 bundles, etc.). [Connectors](https://filigran.notion.site/OpenCTI-Ecosystem-868329e9fb734fca89692b2ed6087e76) are currently developed to accelerate interactions between the tool and other platforms.\n\n## Editions of the platform\n\nOpenCTI platform has 2 different editions: Community (CE) and Enterprise (EE). The purpose of the Enterprise Edition is to provide [additional and powerful features](https://filigran.io/offering/subscribe) which require specific investments in research and development. You can enable the Enterprise Edition directly in the settings of the platform.\n\n* OpenCTI Community Edition, licensed under the [Apache 2, Version 2.0 license](LICENSE).\n* OpenCTI Enterprise Edition, licensed under the [Enterprise Edition license](LICENSE).\n\nTo understand what OpenCTI Enterprise Edition brings in terms of features, just check the [Enterprise Editions page](https://filigran.io/offering/subscribe) on the Filigran website. You can also try this edition by enabling it in the settings of the platform.\n\n## Documentation and demonstration\n\nIf you want to know more on OpenCTI, you can read the [documentation on the tool](https://docs.opencti.io). If you wish to discover how the OpenCTI platform is working, a [demonstration instance](https://demo.opencti.io) is available and open to everyone. This instance is reset every night and is based on reference data maintained by the OpenCTI developers.\n\n## Releases download\n\nThe releases are available on the [Github releases page](https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/opencti/releases). You can also access the [rolling release package](https://releases.opencti.io) generated from the master branch of the repository.\n\n## Installation\n\nAll you need to install the OpenCTI platform can be found in the [official documentation](https://docs.opencti.io). For installation, you can:\n\n* [Use Docker](https://docs.opencti.io/latest/deployment/installation/#using-docker)\n* [Install manually](https://docs.opencti.io/latest/deployment/installation/#install-manually)\n* [Use Terraform (community)](https://docs.opencti.io/latest/deployment/installation/#terraform)\n* [Use Helm charts (community)](https://docs.opencti.io/latest/deployment/installation/#helm-charts)\n\n## Contributing\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\nOpenCTI has adopted a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that we expect project participants to adhere to. Please read the [full text](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.\n\n### Contributing Guide\n\nRead our [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn about our development process, how to propose bugfixes and improvements, and how to build and test your changes to OpenCTI.\n\n### Beginner friendly issues\n\nTo help you get you familiar with our contribution process, we have a list of [beginner friendly issues](https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/opencti/labels/beginner%20friendly%20issue) which are fairly easy to implement. This is a great place to get started.\n\n### Development\n\nIf you want to actively help OpenCTI, we created a [dedicated documentation](https://docs.opencti.io/latest/development/environment_ubuntu/) about the deployment of a development environment and how to start the source code modification.\n\n## Community\n\n### Status & bugs\n\nCurrently OpenCTI is under heavy development, if you wish to report bugs or ask for new features, you can directly use the [Github issues module](https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/opencti/issues).\n\n### Discussion\n\nIf you need support or you wish to engage a discussion about the OpenCTI platform, feel free to join us on our [Slack channel](https://community.filigran.io). You can also send us an email to contact@filigran.io.\n\n## About\n\n### Authors\n\nOpenCTI is a product designed and developed by the company [Filigran](https://filigran.io).\n\n<a href=\"https://filigran.io\" alt=\"Filigran\"><img src=\"./.github/img/logo_filigran.png\" width=\"300\" /></a>\n\n### Data Collection\n\n#### Usage telemetry\n\nTo improve the features and the performances of OpenCTI, the platform collects anonymous statistical data related to its usage and health.\n\nYou can find all the details on collected data and associated usage in the [usage telemetry documentation](https://docs.opencti.io/latest/reference/usage-telemetry/).\n\n#### OpenStreetMap server\n\nTo provide OpenCTI users with cartography features, the platform uses a dedicated OpenStreetMap server (https://map.opencti.io). To monitor usage and adapt services performances, Filigran collects access log to this server (including IP addresses).\n\nBy using this server, you authorize Filigran to collect this information. Otherwise, you are free to deploy your own OpenStreetMap server and modify the platform configuration accordingly.\n\nIf you have started using the Filigran server and change your mind, you have the right to access, limit, rectify, erase and receive your data. To exercise your rights, please send your request to privacy@filigran.io.\n"

          "size": 3.6953125,
          "content": "# Security Policy\n\n## Supported Versions\n\nOnly the current stable major release (ie. X.X) is supported for update and bug fixes (as of October 2023, 5.11.X). Any previous versions are currently not supported and users are advised to use them \"at their own risk\".\n\n## Reporting a Vulnerability\n\nPlease report (suspected) security vulnerabilities via GitHub's security advisory reporting system:\nSubmit your vulnerability via [this link](https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/opencti/security/advisories/new)\n\nPlease note the following requirements (all are required):\n\n- Summary of the suspected vulnerability\n- Detailed information as to what the suspected vulnerability does and what it has access to\n- Proof of Concept (Code samples at minimum, reproduction video optional)\n  - POC must include how the vulnerability can actually access sensitive data, simply triggering an alert popup in a browser is not a security vulnerability\n- Impact summary (who does this impact and how)\n\nOptionally you may also add your estimated CVSS 3.1 score, though we may adjust. There is no need to submit a CVE request as we will do that as part of the advisory process.\n\nYou will receive a response from us within 72 hours. If the issue is confirmed, we will release a patch as soon as possible depending on complexity but historically within a few days.\n\nPlease note that we follow a very strict internal and public disclosure policy, typically a patch will be issued and included in a release. We then will place a warning that a security vulnerability has been patched and delay detailed disclosure from 2 to 8 weeks depending on the severity of the issue. If you have any resources such as blog posts that you intend to publish on and would like us to include these in our disclosure please advise us ASAP.\n\nBefore doing any public disclosure we do ask that you speak to us first to ensure we are not releasing too much information before a patch is available and time has been given to users to upgrade their projects.\n\n## Security Process Summary\n\nBelow is a breakdown of our security process in order to set expectations:\n\n- Initial submission of vulnerability via GitHub's Advisory system\n- Begin internal tracking and communication to reporter\n- Internal validation of vulnerability\n- Internal notification and scheduling for patch development\n- Begin development of patch\n- Validation of patch (Internal and with the reporter)\n- GitHub advisory cleanup\n- Requesting of CVE via GitHub\n- Disclosure and communication draft\n- Patch released with initial warning via patch notes\n- Email communication to Filigran Enterprise customers\n- Mandatory waiting period (between 2 to 8 weeks)\n- Publishing GitHub Advisory & CVE\n- Public disclosure (via blog post)\n- Email communication to Filigran Enterprise customers\n\n## Other reporting platforms and bounties\n\nFiligran does not support other reporting platforms, all security vulnerabilities must be made via GitHub Advisory system. If you are unable to report via this method you may open a security ticket with us by emailing security@filigran.io and we will create one on your behalf but if you do not have a GitHub user account we will not be able to share the private fork, pull request, or any other information with you during the process.\n\nList of some (though not all) platforms **we do not support**:\n\n- huntr.dev\n- Direct email or communication to Filigran employees (Slack or Email)\n- Stack Overflow\n\nFiligran does not currently and has no plans to offer any bug bounties, swag, or any other reward for reporting vulnerabilities. At most during our public disclosure we can give credit to the reporter and link to any social accounts you wish to have us add including linking to your own blog post detailing the vulnerability if you wish."
