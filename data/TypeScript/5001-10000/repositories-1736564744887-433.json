          "content": "# Contributing to the Elasticsearch Node.js client\n\nThe Elasticsearch Node.js client is open source and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you!\n\nThere are many ways to contribute,\nfrom writing tutorials or blog posts,\nimproving the documentation,\nsubmitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code.\n\n## Repository structure\nThe `main` branch is considered unstable, and it's compatible with Elasticsearch main. Unless you are patching an issue, new features should always be sent to the `main` branch, in case of a bugfix, it depends if the bug affects all the release lines.<br/>\nThere is a branch for every supported release line, such as `7.x` or `6.x`. We release bugfixes as soon as possible, while minor and major releases are published at the same time of the Elastic Stack.\n\nUsually for every release line there will be a *published* version and a *next* version. Eg: the `7.x` branch contains the version published on npm, and bugfixes should be sent there, while `7.2` *(assuming that 7.1.x is released)* contains the next version, and new features should be sent there.\n\n## Code contributions\n\nIf you have a bugfix or new feature that you would like to contribute,\nplease find or open an issue about it first.\nTalk about what you would like to do.\nIt may be that somebody is already working on it,\nor that there are particular issues that you should know about before implementing the change.\n\nNote that we strictly follow the [Elastic EOL schedule](https://www.elastic.co/support/eol).\n\n### Submitting your changes\n\nGenerally, we require that you test any code you are adding or modifying.\nOnce your changes are ready to submit for review:\n\n1. Test your changes\n\n    Run the test suite to make sure that nothing is broken.\n    Usually running `npm test` is enough; our CI will take care of running the integration tests. If you want to run the integration tests yourself, see [the *Testing* section](#testing) below.\n\n2. Submit a pull request\n\n    Push your local changes to your forked copy of the repository and [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).\n    In the pull request,\n    choose a title which sums up the changes that you have made,\n    and in the body provide more details about what your changes do.\n    Also mention the number of the issue where discussion has taken place,\n    eg \"Closes #123\".\n\n3. Sign the Contributor License Agreement\n\n    Please make sure you have signed our [Contributor License Agreement](https://www.elastic.co/contributor-agreement/).\n    We are not asking you to assign copyright to us,\n    but to give us the right to distribute your code without restriction.\n    We ask this of all contributors in order to assure our users of the origin and continuing existence of the code.\n    You only need to sign the CLA once.\n\n4. Be patient\n\n    We might not be able to review your code as fast as we would like to,\n    but we'll do our best to dedicate it the attention it deserves.\n    Your effort is much appreciated!\n\n### Code generation\n\nThe entire content of the `src/api/` directory is automatically generated from [the Elasticsearch specification](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-specification), as is the `docs/reference.asciidoc` file.\nThis code generation is done using a separate repository that is not currently available to the public.\n\nIf you find discrepancies between this client's API code and what you see when actually interacting with an Elasticsearch API, you can open a pull request here to fix it.\nFor API fixes, it's likely a change will need to be made to the specification as well, to ensure your fix is not undone by the code generation process.\nWe will do our best to make sure this is addressed when reviewing and merging your changes.\n\nPRs to improve the specification are also welcome!\nIt is implemented in TypeScript, so JavaScript devs should be able to understand it fairly easily.\nSpec fixes are particularly helpful, as they will be reflected in ALL official Elasticsearch clients, not just this one.\n\n### Testing\n\nThere are a few different test scripts.\nUsually during development you only need to run `npm test`, but if you want you can run just a part of the suite:\n\n| Script | Description |\n|---|---|\n| `npm run test:unit` | Runs the content of the `test/unit` folder. |\n| `npm run test:coverage-100` | Runs unit tests enforcing 100% coverage. |\n| `npm run test:coverage-report` | Runs unit tests and generates an `lcov` coverage report. |\n| `npm run test:coverage-ui` | Runs unit tests and generates an HTML coverage report. |\n| `npm run test:integration` | Runs the integration test runner.<br/>**Note: requires a living instance of Elasticsearch.** |\n| `npm run lint` | Run the [linter](https://github.com/standard/ts-standard). |\n| `npm run lint:fix` | Fixes linter errors. |\n| `npm run license-checker` | Checks that all dependencies have acceptable open source licenses. |\n\n| `npm test` | Runs `lint` and `test:unit`. |\n\n#### Integration test\n\nThe integration tests are generated on the fly by the runner you will find inside `test/integration`.\nOnce you execute it, it will fetch the [YAML REST test files](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/tree/main/rest-api-spec/src/yamlRestTest/resources/rest-api-spec/test) from our artifacts API.\nThese are used to generate the integration tests.\n\nUsually this step is executed by CI since it takes some time, but you can easily run this yourself!\nJust follow this steps:\n1. Boot a fresh Elasticsearch instance, which can be done in a Docker container by running `STACK_VERSION=8.10.0 DETACH=true .buildkite/run-elasticsearch.sh`, where `STACK_VERSION` and `DETACH` environment variables can be adjusted to your needs. A `TEST_SUITE` env var can also be set to `free` or `platinum`, and defaults to `free`.\n1. Run `npm run test:integration` to run the whole suite, or `npm run test:integration -- --bail` to stop after the first failure.\n1. Grab a coffee, it will take some time. ;)\n\nThis suite is very large, and not all tests will pass.\nThis is fine.\nThis suite is mostly used to identify notable changes in success/fail rate over time as we make changes to the client.\n\n### Releasing\n\nIf you have access to make releases, the process is as follows:\n\n1. Update the version in `package.json` according to the scale of the change. (major, minor or patch)\n1. Commit changes with message `Bumped vx.y.z` where `x.y.z` is the version in `package.json`\n1. Create a release via the GitHub UI.\n1. Wait for CI to finish running the test.\n1. Publish to npm with `npm publish` *(see [publish](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/publish) and [dist-tag](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/dist-tag) docs)*\n"

It does not mean that the client automatically supports new features\nof newer Elasticsearch versions; it is only possible after a release of a new\nclient version. For example, a 8.12 client version won't automatically support\nthe new features of the 8.13 version of Elasticsearch, the 8.13 client version\nis required for that. Elasticsearch language clients are only backwards\ncompatible with default distributions and without guarantees made.\n\n| Elasticsearch Version | Elasticsearch-JS Branch  | Supported |\n| --------------------- | ------------------------ | --------- |\n| main                  | main                     |           |\n| 8.x                   | 8.x                      | 8.x       |\n| 7.x                   | 7.x                      | 7.17      |\n\n## Usage\n\n* [Creating an index](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/getting-started-js.html#_creating_an_index)\n* [Indexing a document](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/getting-started-js.html#_indexing_documents)\n* [Getting documents](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/getting-started-js.html#_getting_documents)\n* [Searching documents](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/getting-started-js.html#_searching_documents)\n* [Updating documents](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/getting-started-js.html#_updating_documents)\n* [Deleting documents](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/getting-started-js.html#_deleting_documents)\n* [Deleting an index](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/getting-started-js.html#_deleting_an_index)\n\n### Node.js support\n\nNOTE: The minimum supported version of Node.js is `v18`.\n\nThe client versioning follows the Elastic Stack versioning, this means that\nmajor, minor, and patch releases are done following a precise schedule that\noften does not coincide with the [Node.js release](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/) times.\n\nTo avoid support insecure and unsupported versions of Node.js, the\nclient **will drop the support of EOL versions of Node.js between minor releases**.\nTypically, as soon as a Node.js version goes into EOL, the client will continue\nto support that version for at least another minor release. If you are using the client\nwith a version of Node.js that will be unsupported soon, you will see a warning\nin your logs (the client will start logging the warning with two minors in advance).\n\nUnless you are **always** using a supported version of Node.js, \nwe recommend defining the client dependency in your\n`package.json` with the `~` instead of `^`. In this way, you will lock the\ndependency on the minor release and not the major. (for example, `~7.10.0` instead\nof `^7.10.0`).\n\n| Node.js Version | Node.js EOL date | End of support         |\n| --------------- |------------------| ---------------------- |\n| `8.x`           | `December 2019`  | `7.11` (early 2021)    |\n| `10.x`          | `April 2021`     | `7.12` (mid 2021)      |\n| `12.x`          | `April 2022`     | `8.2` (early 2022)     |\n| `14.x`          | `April 2023`     | `8.8` (early 2023)     |\n| `16.x`          | `September 2023` | `8.11` (late 2023)     |\n\n### Compatibility\n\nLanguage clients are forward compatible; meaning that clients support communicating with greater or equal minor versions of Elasticsearch.\nElasticsearch language clients are only backwards compatible with default distributions and without guarantees made.\n\n| Elasticsearch Version | Client Version |\n| --------------------- |----------------|\n| `8.x`                 | `8.x`          |\n| `7.x`                 | `7.x`          |\n| `6.x`                 | `6.x`          |\n| `5.x`                 | `5.x`          |\n\nTo install a specific major of the client, run the following command:\n```\nnpm install @elastic/elasticsearch@<major>\n```\n\n#### Browser\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> There is no official support for the browser environment. It exposes your Elasticsearch instance to everyone, which could lead to security issues.\nWe recommend that you write a lightweight proxy that uses this client instead, you can see a proxy example [here](./docs/examples/proxy).\n\n## Documentation\n\n* [Introduction](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/introduction.html)\n* [Usage](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/client-connecting.html#client-usage)\n* [Client configuration](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/client-configuration.html)\n* [API reference](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/api-reference.html)\n* [Authentication](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/client-connecting.html#authentication)\n* [Observability](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/observability.html)\n* [Creating a child client](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/child.html)\n* [Client helpers](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/client-helpers.html)\n* [Typescript support](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/typescript.html)\n* [Testing](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/client-testing.html)\n* [Examples](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/examples.html)\n\n## Install multiple versions\nIf you are using multiple versions of Elasticsearch, you need to use multiple versions of the client. In the past, install multiple versions of the same package was not possible, but with `npm v6.9`, you can do that via aliasing.\n\nThe command you must run to install different version of the client is:\n\n```sh\nnpm install <alias>@npm:@elastic/elasticsearch@<version>\n```\n\nSo for example if you need to install `7.x` and `6.x`, you will run:\n\n```sh\nnpm install es6@npm:@elastic/elasticsearch@6\nnpm install es7@npm:@elastic/elasticsearch@7\n```\n\nAnd your `package.json` will look like the following:\n\n```json\n\"dependencies\": {\n  \"es6\": \"npm:@elastic/elasticsearch@^6.7.0\",\n  \"es7\": \"npm:@elastic/elasticsearch@^7.0.0\"\n}\n```\n\nYou will require the packages from your code by using the alias you have defined.\n\n```js\nconst { Client: Client6 } = require('es6')\nconst { Client: Client7 } = require('es7')\n\nconst client6 = new Client6({\n  cloud: { id: '<cloud-id>' },\n  auth: { apiKey: 'base64EncodedKey' }\n})\nconst client7 = new Client7({\n  cloud: { id: '<cloud-id>' },\n  auth: { apiKey: 'base64EncodedKey' }\n})\n\nclient6.info().then(console.log, console.log)\nclient7.info().then(console.log, console.log)\n```\n\nFinally, if you want to install the client for the next version of Elasticsearch\n*(the one that lives in Elasticsearchâ€™s main branch)*, you can use the following\ncommand:\n\n```sh\nnpm install esmain@github:elastic/elasticsearch-js\n```\n\n## License\n\nThis software is licensed under the [Apache License 2.0](./LICENSE).\n"
