Due to its personal privatization-oriented design, there are some limitations in secondary commercial development, presenting some issues, such as:\n  1. **Difficult conversation synchronization**, for example, requiring services like WebDav, high user learning costs, and difficulties in real-time cross-device synchronization.\n  2. **Insufficient billing**, for example, only supporting elastic billing or only subscription-based, unable to meet the needs of different users.\n  3. **Inconvenient file parsing**, for example, only supporting uploading images to an image hosting service first, then returning to the site to input the URL direct link in the input box, without built-in file parsing functionality.\n  4. **No support for conversation URL sharing**, for example, only supporting conversation screenshot sharing, unable to support conversation URL sharing (or only supporting tools like ShareGPT, which cannot promote the site).\n  5. **Insufficient channel management**, for example, the backend only supports OpenAI format channels, making it difficult to be compatible with other format channels. And only one channel can be filled in, unable to support multi-channel management.\n  6. **No API call support**, for example, only supporting user interface calls, unable to support API proxying and management.\n\n- Another type is API distribution-oriented sites with powerful distribution systems, such as projects based on [One API](https://github.com/songquanpeng/one-api).\nAlthough these projects support powerful API proxying and management, they lack interface design and some C-end features, such as:\n  1. **Insufficient user interface**, for example, only supporting API calls, without built-in user interface chat. User interface chat requires manually copying the key and going to other sites to use, which has a high learning cost for ordinary users.\n  2. **No subscription system**, for example, only supporting elastic billing, lacking billing design for C-end users, unable to meet different user needs, and not user-friendly in terms of cost perception for users without a foundation.\n  3. **Insufficient C-end features**, for example, only supporting API calls, not supporting conversation synchronization, conversation sharing, file parsing, and other functions.\n  4. **Insufficient load balancing**, the open-source version does not support the **weight** parameter, unable to achieve balanced load distribution probability for channels at the same priority ([New API](https://github.com/Calcium-Ion/new-api) also solves this pain point, with a more beautiful UI).\n\nTherefore, we hope to combine the advantages of these two types of projects to create a project that has both a powerful API distribution system and a rich user interface design,\nthus meeting the needs of C-end users while developing B-end business, improving user experience, reducing user learning costs, and increasing user stickiness.\n\nThus, **Chat Nio** was born. We hope to create a project that has both a powerful API distribution system and a rich user interface design, becoming the next-generation open-source AIGC project's one-stop commercial solution.\n\n\n## ❤ Donations\n\nIf you find this project helpful, you can give it a Star to show your support!\n"

聊天等此类功能通过 websocket 进行通信, 请确保你的服务支持 websocket。 (Tip: 中转通过 Http 实现, 无需 websocket 支持)\n   - 如果你使用了 Nginx, Apache 等反向代理, 请确保已配置 websocket 支持。\n   - 如果使用了端口映射, 端口转发, CDN, API Gateway 等服务, 请确保你的服务支持并开启 websocket。\n2. **我配置的 Midjourney Proxy 格式的渠道一直转圈或报错 `please provide available notify url`**\n   - 若为转圈，请确保你的 Midjourney Proxy 服务已正常运行, 并且已配置正确的上游地址。\n   - **Midjourney 要填渠道类型要用 Midjourney 而不是 OpenAI (不知道为什么很多人填成了 OpenAI 类型格式然后过来反馈为什么empty response, mj-chat 类除外)**\n   - 排查完这些问题后, 请查看你的系统设置中的**后端域名**是否已经配置并配置正确。如果不配置, 将导致 Midjourney Proxy 服务无法正常回调。\n3. **此项目有什么外部依赖？**\n   - MySQL: 存储用户信息, 对话记录, 管理员信息等持久化数据。\n   - Redis: 存储用户快速鉴权信息, IP 速率限制, 订阅配额, 邮箱验证码等数据。\n   - 环境未配置好的情况下, 会导致服务无法正常运行, 请确保你的 MySQL 和 Redis 服务已正常运行 (Docker 部署, 编译部署需自行搭建外部服务)。\n4. **我的机器为 ARM 架构, 该项目支持 ARM 架构吗？**\n   - 支持。Chat Nio 项目使用 BuildX 构建多架构镜像, 你可以直接使用 docker-compose 或 docker 运行, 无需额外配置。\n   - 如果你使用编译安装, 直接在 ARM 机器上编译即可, 无需欸外配置。如果你使用 x86 机器编译, 请使用 `GOARCH=arm64 go build -o chatnio` 进行交叉编译并上传至 ARM 机器上运行。\n5. **如何修改 Root 默认密码？**\n   - 请点击右上角头像或侧边栏底部用户框进入后台管理, 点击系统设置下常规设置操作栏的 修改 Root 密码 进行修改。或者选择在 用户管理 中选定 root 用户进行修改密码操作。\n6. **系统设置中的后端域名是什么？**\n   - 后端域名是指后端 API 服务的地址, 默认为你访问站点后加 `/api` 的地址, 如 `https://example.com/api` 。\n   - 如果设置为非 *SERVE_STATIC* 模式, 开启前后端分离部署, 请将后端域名设置为你的后端 API 服务地址, 如 `https://api.example.com`。\n   - 后端域名此处用于 Midjourney Proxy 服务的后端回调地址, 如无需使用 Midjourney Proxy 服务, 请忽略此设置。\n7. **如何配置支付方式？**\n   - Chat Nio 开源版支持发卡模式, 设置系统设置中的购买链接为你的发卡地址即可。卡密可通过用户管理中兑换码管理中批量生成。\n8. **礼品码和兑换码有什么区别？**\n   - 礼品码一种类型只能一个用户只能绑定一次, 而非 aff code, 发福利等方式可使用礼品码, 可在头像下拉菜单中的礼品码中兑换。\n   - 兑换码一种类型可以多个用户绑定, 可作为正常购买和发卡使用, 可在用户管理中的兑换码管理中批量生成, 在头像下拉菜单的点数（菜单第一个）内输入兑换码进行兑换。\n   - 一个例子：比如我发了一个类型为 *新年快乐* 的福利, 此时推荐使用礼品码, 假设发放 100 个 66 点数, 如果为兑换码, 手快的一个用户就批量把所有兑换码的 6600 点数都用完了, 而礼品码则可以保证每个用户只能使用一次 (获得 66 点数)。\n   - 而搭建发卡的时, 如果用礼品码, 因为一个类型只能兑换一次, 购买多个礼品码会导致兑换失败, 而兑换码则可以在此场景下使用。\n9. **该项目支持 Vercel 部署吗？**\n   - Chat Nio 本身并不支持 Vercel 部署, 但是你可以使用前后端分离模式,  Vercel 部署前端部分, 后端部分使用 Docker 部署或编译部署。\n10. **前后端分离部署模式是什么？**\n    - 正常情况下, 前后端在同一服务内, 后端地址为 `/api`。前后端分离部署指前端和后端分别部署在不同的服务上, 前端服务为静态文件服务, 后端服务为 API 服务。\n      - 举个例子, 前端使用 Nginx (或 Vercel 等) 部署, 部署的域名为 `https://www.chatnio.net`。\n      - 后端使用 Docker 部署, 部署的域名为 `https://api.chatnio.net`。\n    - 此种部署方式需自行打包前端, 配置环境变量 `VITE_BACKEND_ENDPOINT` 为你的后端地址, 如 `https://api.chatnio.net`。\n    - 配置后端环境变量的 `SERVE_STATIC=false` 使后端服务不提供静态文件服务。\n11. **弹性计费和订阅详解**\n    - 弹性计费, 即 `点数`, 其图标类似于**云**, 模型计费通用方式, 为了防止虚假汇率, 写死 10 点数 = 1 元, 汇率可以在计费规则中的 **应用内置模板** 中自定义汇率。\n    - 订阅, 即订阅计划, 为固定价格计费方式按次配额, 订阅计费扣取点数 (举例: 如果站点的用户想订阅 32 元的计划, 则需要保证点数大于等于 320 点数)\n    - 订阅是 Item 的组合, 每个 Item 都可设置涵盖的模型, 订阅配额 (-1 为无限使用), 名称, ID (用于区分不同的 Item), 图标等。可在后台的订阅管理中进行操作, 是否开启订阅, 订阅价格等, 修改每个订阅等级的 Item, 以及支持直接导入其他订阅等级的 Item。\n    - 订阅支持分层并写死为三个等级。 等级分别为: _普通用户 (0)_, _基础版订阅 (1)_, _标准版订阅 (2)_, _专业版订阅 (3)_, 订阅等级即为用户分组, 可在渠道管理中进行高级设置, 选择勾选可使用此模型的用户分组。\n    - 订阅配额设置, 可在订阅管理中进行操作, 是否支持中转 API (默认关闭)\n12. **可请求最小点数检测 `user quota is not enough` 详解**\n    - 为防止站点用户滥用站点模型, 当请求点数低于最小请求点数时将返回点数不足的错误信息, 大于等于最小请求点数时将正常请求。\n    - 模型的最小可请求点数规则: \n        - 不计费模型无限制\n        - 次数计费模型最小点数为该模型的 1 次请求点数 (e.g. 若一个模型的单次请求点数为 0.1 点数, 则最小请求点数为 0.1 点数)\n        - Token 弹性计费模型为 1K 输入 Tokens 价格 + 1K 输出 Tokens 价格 (e.g. 若一个模型的 1K 输入 Tokens 价格为 0.05 点数, 1K 输出 Tokens 价格 0.1 点数, 则最小请求点数为 0.15 点数)\n13. **为何我的 GPT-4-All 等逆向模型无法使用上传文件中的图片?**\n    - 上传模型图片为 Base64 格式, 如果逆向不支持 Base64 格式, 请使用 URL 直链而非上传文件做法。\n14. **如何开始域名严格跨域检测?**\n    - 正常情况下，后端对所有域名开放跨域。如果非特殊需求，无需开启严格跨域检测。\n    - 如果需要开启严格跨域检测，可以在后端环境变量中 并配置 `ALLOW_ORIGINS`, 如 `ALLOW_ORIGINS=chatnio.net,chatnio.app` （不需要加协议前缀, www 解析无需手动添加, 后端将自动识别并允许跨域）, 这样就会支持严格跨域检测 (如 *http://www.chatnio.app*, *https://chatnio.net* 等将会被允许, 其他域名将会被拒绝)。\n    - 即使在开启严格跨域检测的情况下, /v1 接口会被仍然允许所有域的跨域请求, 以保证中转 API 的正常使用。\n15. **模型映射功能是如何使用的？**\n    - 渠道内的模型映射格式为 `[from]>[to]`, 多个映射之间换行, **from** 为请求的模型, **to** 为真实向上游发送的模型并且需要上游真实支持\n    - 如: 我有一个逆向渠道, 填写 `gpt-4-all>gpt-4`, 则我的用户请求 **gpt-4-all** 模型到该渠道时, 后端则会模型映射至 **gpt-4** 向该渠道请求 **gpt-4**, 此时该渠道支持 2 个模型, **gpt-4** 和 **gpt-4-all** (本质上都为 **gpt-4**)\n    - 如果我不想让我的这个逆向渠道影响到 **gpt-4** 的渠道组, 可以加前缀 `!gpt-4-all>gpt-4`, 该渠道 **gpt-4** 则会被忽略, 此时该渠道将只支持 1 个模型, **gpt-4-all** (但本质上为 **gpt-4**)\n\n## 📦 技术栈\n- 🥗 前端: React + Redux + Radix UI + Tailwind CSS\n- 🍎 后端: Golang + Gin + Redis + MySQL\n- 🍒 应用技术: PWA + WebSocket\n\n## 🤯 为什么写此项目 & 项目优势\n我们发现，市面上的 AIGC 商业站点，大多数都是偏向于前端轻量部署的项目，有精美的 UI 界面设计，\n比如 [Next Chat](https://github.com/ChatGPTNextWeb/ChatGPT-Next-Web) 的二开商业版本，\n由于其偏向个人私有化的设计，在二开商业化时有一定的局限性，呈现出一些问题，比如：\n  - **对话同步难**, 比如需要 WebDav 等服务，用户学习成本高，跨端实时同步困难。\n  - **计费不够完善**, 比如只支持弹性计费或只支持订阅制，无法满足不同用户的需求。\n  - **文件解析不便捷**, 比如只支持先在图床上传图片，返回站点后再在输入框中输入 URL 直链，无内置文件解析功能。\n  - **不支持对话 URL 分享**, 比如只支持对话截图分享，无法支持对话 URL 分享 (或仅支持 ShareGPT 等工具，无法对站点起到推广作用)。\n  - **渠道管理不够强大**, 比如后台仅支持 OpenAI 格式渠道，兼容其他格式渠道困难。且只能填入一个渠道，无法支持多渠道管理。\n  - **不支持 API 调用**, 比如只支持用户界面调用，无法支持 API 中转和管理。\n\n另一种是偏向于 API 分发的站点，有强大的分发系统，比如基于 [One API](https://github.com/songquanpeng/one-api) 等项目，\n这类项目虽然支持强大的 API 中转和管理，但是缺少界面设计，且缺少一些 C 端功能，比如：\n  - **用户界面不够丰富**, 比如只支持 API 调用，不内置用户界面聊天。用户界面聊天需要自行复制密钥并前往其他站点才能使用，这对于普通用户来说，学习成本较高。\n  - **没有订阅制**, 比如只支持弹性计费，缺少对 C 端用户的计费设计，无法满足用户的不同需求，对于无基础的用户来说，成本感知不够友好。\n  - **C 端功能不够丰富**, 比如只支持 API 调用，不支持对话同步，不支持对话分享，不支持文件解析等功能。\n  - **均衡负载不够强大**, 开源版不支持**权重**参数, 无法实现同优先级的渠道均衡负载分配概率 ([New API](https://github.com/Calcium-Ion/new-api) 也解决了此痛点, UI 也更美观)。\n\n因此，我们希望能够将这两种项目的优势结合起来，做出一个既有强大的 API 分发系统，又有丰富的用户界面设计的项目，\n这样既能满足 C 端用户的需求，又能发展 B 端业务，提高用户体验，降低用户学习成本，提高用户粘性。\n\n于是，**Chat Nio** 应运而生，我们希望能够做出一个既有强大的 API 分发系统，又有丰富的用户界面设计的项目，成为下一代开源 AIGC 项目的商业一站式解决方案。\n\n\n## ❤ 捐助\n如果您觉得这个项目对您有所帮助, 您可以点个 Star 支持一下！\n"
