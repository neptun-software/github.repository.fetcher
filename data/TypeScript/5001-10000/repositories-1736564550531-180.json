Each quickstart provides a foundation that you can easily build upon and customize for your specific needs.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nTo use these quickstarts, you'll need an Anthropic API key. If you don't have one yet, you can sign up for free at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com).\n\n## Available Quickstarts\n\n### Customer Support Agent\n\nA customer support agent powered by Claude. This project demonstrates how to leverage Claude's natural language understanding and generation capabilities to create an AI-assisted customer support system with access to a knowledge base.\n\n[Go to Customer Support Agent Quickstart](./customer-support-agent)\n\n### Financial Data Analyst\n\nA financial data analyst powered by Claude. This project demonstrates how to leverage Claude's capabilities with interactive data visualization to analyze financial data via chat.\n\n[Go to Financial Data Analyst Quickstart](./financial-data-analyst)\n\n### Computer Use Demo\n\nAn environment and tools that Claude can use to control a desktop computer. This project demonstrates how to leverage the computer use capabilities of the new Claude 3.5 Sonnet model.\n\n[Go to Computer Use Demo Quickstart](./computer-use-demo)\n\n## General Usage\n\nEach quickstart project comes with its own README and setup instructions. Generally, you'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Clone this repository\n2. Navigate to the specific quickstart directory\n3. Install the required dependencies\n4. Set up your Anthropic API key as an environment variable\n5. Run the quickstart application\n\n## Explore Further\n\nTo deepen your understanding of working with Claude and the Anthropic API, check out these resources:\n\n- [Anthropic API Documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com)\n- [Anthropic Cookbook](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook) - A collection of code snippets and guides for common tasks\n- [Anthropic API Fundamentals Course](https://github.com/anthropics/courses/tree/master/anthropic_api_fundamentals)\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions to the Anthropic Quickstarts repository! If you have ideas for new quickstart projects or improvements to existing ones, please open an issue or submit a pull request.\n\n## Community and Support\n\n- Join our [Anthropic Discord community](https://www.anthropic.com/discord) for discussions and support\n- Check out the [Anthropic support documentation](https://support.anthropic.com) for additional help\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.\n"
