Anyway, this release bundles several nice user-contributed features:\n\n- @AB1908: Tag queries are now case insensitive.\n- @AB1908: Shift-clicking a link/task to open in a new tab now works properly on Mac.\n- @AB1908: Numerous documentation fixes for clarity and more examples.\n- @AnnaKornfeldSimpson: Additional emoji shorthands for more task fields (finished, due).\n- @ooker777: Documentation improvements for some DataviewJS functions, and the ability to use inline emoji for the\n  completion tracking feature.\n- @mt-krainski: Custom date formats for task completions.\n- @gentlegiantJGC: Better support for nested inline fields (i.e., less crashy).\n\n---\n\n# 0.5.41\n\n- Fix a bad regex doing escaping in markdown tables.\n- Improve async documentation.\n\n---\n\n# 0.5.40\n\nAdds some more documentation about the new markdown functionality.\n\n---\n\n# 0.5.39\n\n- Fixed an issue where checking a task in a task view would check the wrong box visually.\n- Added experimental plugin APIs for querying dataview directly as markdown, and converting dataview results to properly\n  formatted markdown.\n\n---\n\n# 0.5.38\n\n- Some minor documentation improvements.\n- Fix an issue with inline fields rendering out of order. That was a weird bug.\n\n---\n\n# 0.5.37\n\nFixes inline field rendering to once again work for highlighting/links, as well as some other rendering quirks with\ninline queries in codeblocks.\n\n---\n\n# 0.5.36\n\n- Fix a bug when checking if an element is an HTMLElement.\n- Properly include the nice improvements to the file count in tables and lists.\n\n---\n\n# 0.5.35\n\n- Fix #1196, #1176: Re-enable HTML values. This was never a featured I advertised since it was just for some internal\n  hackery, but it appears people just discovered it in DataviewJS queries.\n- Improved initial time to popular queries that use `file.starred`.\n\n---\n\n# 0.5.34\n\n- Fix #1174: Fix indexing with a variable.\n- Fix an issue with the experimental calendar view.\n\n---\n\n# 0.5.33\n\n- Fix a bug with inline views that was introduced in 0.5.32.\n\n---\n\n# 0.5.32\n\nThe Dataview API has been noticeably revamped - there are now approximately twice as many functions available on the\nplugin API as there were before, and some additional utilities have been added to both the plugin and inline API. I\nwill be finishing up the associated new \"extension\" functionality shortly, which will allow:\n\n1. For custom Dataview + DataviewJS functions to be added via plugins.\n2. For custom renderable objects (progress bars, embedded task lists, embedded tables) to be added to any Dataview view via plugins.\n3. For plugins to provide alternative behavior for some dataview functionality (such as integrating task plugins with\n   the dataview task query).\n   \nAs part of the API revamp, it is now possible to programmatically execute Dataview and DataviewJS queries - either for\nusing the existing Dataview query language in your own plugin, or for embedding dataview. The Dataview npm library also\nnow exposes many useful internal Dataview types, including the AST structure for all dataview queries.\n\nI am hoping that cleaning up the Dataview API and making it much more extensible will allow for Dataview [to](to) integrate\nmuch better with existing plugins, and to provide the full power of the in-memory index for plugins. I have been very\ncarefully watching index performance in recent weeks to ensure smooth frontend performance for anyone using the API\n(with a goal of <10ms for most queries).\n\n---\n\n# 0.5.31\n\nTasks now have an `outlinks` list field which includes all links in the task; this can be used for finding tasks with\nlinks in them.\n\n---\n\n# 0.5.30\n\n- Added the `typeof(any)` function in Dataview, which obtains the type of any value for comparison:\n```javascript\ntypeof(\"text\") = \"string\"\ntypeof(1) = \"number\"\ntypeof([1, 2, 3]) = \"array\"\n```\n\n- Added the modulo operator (`%`) for doing integer division remainder. I.e., `14 % 2 = 0` and `14 % 3 = 2`.\n- Fixed some minor spacing issues with lists in tables.\n\n---\n\n# 0.5.29\n\nFix another subtle incompatibility between 0.4.26 and 0.5.29 - if you frequently used empty inline fields (like\n`Key::` with no value), the 0.5+ behavior is now the same as 0.4 behavior and will map such fields to null instead of an\nempty string.\n\nThis may fix a broad variety of \"subtly wrong\" queries that you may have seen after the upgrade.\n\n---\n\n# 0.5.28\n\n- Fix a bug with some more string concatenations and null handling.\n\n---\n\n# 0.5.27\n\nMore performance + correctness bugfixes.\n\n- The parser has been made a little more robust to prevent major indexing issues (or at least recover from them\n  quickly).\n- Several new strange tag variants are now supported.\n- Markdown links are now properly indexed again.\n\nSome DataviewJS performance issues should be resolved now, especially for external plugins using Dataview. This fix\ndoes involve a slight API break w.r.t. what types are wrapped into Dataview Arrays (which provide functions like\n`.where()`). Generally, only Dataview-provided implicits are wrapped in data arrays now; frontmatter and inline fields\nare always now regular JS arrays - use `dv.array()` to explicitly make a data array if you want the advanced querying.\n\n---\n\n# 0.5.26\n\nMore small bugfixes:\n\n- Fix a few small link rendering issues.\n- Tag extraction from tasks now handles punctuation properly.\n- Upgrade luxon (which is embedded in DataviewJS) to 2.4.0.\n\n---\n\n# 0.5.25\n\n- Fix #1147: Fix there being a `#null` tag for files with an empty `tag` or `tags` frontmatter.\n\n---\n\n# 0.5.24\n\nSeveral bugfixes:\n\n- Nulls are now sorted first rather than last; it's generally good practice to explicitly check for nulls in your\n  queries to avoid strange behavior.\n- Dataview now properly parses space-delimited tags (like `tags: abc def ghi`).\n- Dataview now supports dropping the entire file cache in case of bugs.\n\n---\n\n# 0.5.23\n\n- Fix #1140: Force API objects to be arrays if they are iterables.\n\n---\n\n# 0.5.22\n\n- Fix #1135: Use 'x' instead of 'X' for checkboxes.\n\n---\n\n# 0.5.21\n\nA long-overdue swap from the beta branch to the stable branch. The beta branch should not include any (intended) breaking\nchanges, and has some nice performance improvements that come along with it! Here are the major changes:\n\n- Most views now use React and no longer flicker when updating; this is not the case yet for DataviewJS, which will be\n  getting equivalent treatment in the future.\n- Dataview now caches metadata, so Dataview loads are very fast after the first time you open your vault. Dataview still\n  needs to visit every file when you update the plugin version, so that should be the only times you experience slower\n  load times.\n- A brand new task view backend and query which allows you to filter per-task, rather than per-page! Check the\n  documentation for details, but this broadly means `WHERE` statements now use task properties instead of page\n  properties.\n- Some additional metadata is now available for use - `file.starred`, `file.lists`, and more metadata in\n  `file.tasks`.\n\nThere have been some moderate documentation touch-ups to keep things up to date; I'm still working on a walkthrough for\ncommon Dataview use cases. This review also includes about ~30-40 bugfixes; some new bugs may arise due to internal\nchanges, so please flag them if you encounter them.\n\n---\n\n# 0.5.20 (Beta)\n\nSlight fix to hopefully improve some strange reported cases of bad indexing at startup.\n\n---\n\n# 0.5.19 (Beta)\n\nDataview now uses IndexedDB to cache file metadata, reducing startup time to virtually nothing if you've opened the\nvault before; if you have a small vault (<1000 notes), you may notice a slight improvement, but large vaults and mobile\ndevices will notice a very significant performance improvement to \"first valid paint\". Some other performance parameters\nhave been tuned to hopefully make the default experience better.\n\nA few small bugs related to rendering have also been squashed, including an issue with images being scaled wrongly.\n\n---\n\n# 0.5.18 (Beta)\n\n- Tasks in task views now support alternative task status characters like '!' and '/'; thanks @ebullient.\n- A few documentation nit fixes.\n- Added `DataArray#sortInPlace` for a more efficient mutable sort for niche use cases.\n\n---\n\n# 0.5.17 (Beta)\n\n- Improved behavior when clicking on tasks in the task view; will now properly scroll to the relevant line in long\n  files!\n- Fixed a bug with incorrect counts being displayed in task views.\n- Added `tags` as a field available on task items, so you can now do things like `TASK WHERE contains(tags, \"#tag\")`.\n\n---\n\n# 0.5.16 (Beta)\n\nDataview now tracks initialization and will report when all files have been indexed in the console; you can\nprogrammatically see this via `dataview:index-ready`, or by checking `api.index.initialized`.\n\n---\n\n# 0.5.15 (Beta)\n\n- Add hover highlights to tables to make seeing rows a little easier.\n- Tables and task lists now include counts of the number of results in the headers.\n- Further improved task selection in the task view.\n\n---\n\n# 0.5.14 (Beta)\n\n- Fix task highlighting when not grouping.\n- Remove some spurious console logging.\n- Slightly improve task highlighting behavior when clicking on a task.\n\n---\n\n# 0.5.13 (Beta)\n\nSeveral smaller bugfixes!\n\n- Fix #997: Use the group by field name in the table name.\n- Prevent tons of errors if you incorrectly set the inline query prefix.\n\n---\n\n# 0.5.12 (Beta)\n\nImprove error messages for queries somewhat and get rid of some ugly output.\n\n---\n\n# 0.5.11 (Beta)\n\nAdd detection of tasks inside of block quotes, as well as correctly implement automatic checking and unchecking of these\ntasks.\n\n---\n\n# 0.5.10 (Beta)\n\nAdds the `Dataview: Force Refresh Views` Command (accessible via the Ctrl+P command view) to force current views to\nrefresh immediately.\n\n---\n\n# 0.5.9 (Beta)\n\nAnother fix for due-date related emoji in tasks. I hate emoji.\n\n---\n\n# 0.5.8 (Beta)\n\nFix some issues with infinite loops of tasks due to bad Obsidian metadata (potentially due to being out of date?).\n\n---\n\n# 0.5.7 (Beta)\n\nFix issues with parsing '🗓️2021-08-29' due-date annotations on tasks, as well as an issue with properly extracting\ndue/completed/completed times for use in queries.\n\n---\n\n# 0.5.6 (Beta)\n\nProper release of 0.5.5 plus one additional small improvement:\n\n- Add `duration * number` and `duration / number` operations for manipulation durations numerically.\n\n---\n\n# 0.5.5 (Beta)\n\nMore small features:\n\n- Fix issues with task sorting not doing anything. Sort away!\n- Table headers can now be arbitrary markdown. So you can put things like links in your headers: `TABLE (1 + 2) AS\n  \"[[File]]\".\n- You can now specify the size of an image embed by providing WxH in it's display property: `![[image.png|50x50]]`.\n\n---\n\n# 0.5.4 (Beta)\n\nImproved image rendering for some link types, and adds the `embed(link)` and `embed(link, false)` options to convert\nlinks to/from their embedded equivalents.\n\n---\n\n# 0.5.3 (Beta)\n\nIterative beta which adds a few nice QoL features and fixes some more bugs:\n\n- Internally swapped to a React-based renderer; this should not have a noticeable perf or usability impact, but makes it\n  easier for me to implement complex table/list behaviors.\n- Naming your fields with `AS \"Name\"` is now optional; Dataview will infer the name from the expression automatically.\n  For example, `TABLE 8 + 4, 3 + 6 FROM ...` is now a valid table expression, and the columns will be named `8 + 4` and\n  `3 + 6` respectively.\n- Some issues with array and object rendering were corrected.\n- Error messages on empty dataview results were improved and now show up for all views.\n\nInline images are now rendered correctly in Dataview tables and lists - no more hacky `app://local/` shenanigans!\n\n---\n\n# 0.5.2 (Beta)\n\n- Fix #971: Objects now work properly inside DataviewQL evaluation.\n\n---\n\n# 0.5.1 (Beta)\n\n- Temporarily revert the new task metadata behavior: inline fields in sublists of tasks are added to the page, instead\n  of the task. This behavior is not good, but is compatible with legacy usages of task metadata, which should not break\n  some existing queries.\n    - This behavior will be removed in the future behind a flag.\n- Added the 'visual' field to tasks - if set, tasks render 'visual' instead of their regular text.\n- Fixed `DataArray#mutate()`.\n\n---\n\n# 0.5.0 (Beta)\n\nRe-release of broken release 0.4.23, now hopefully with fixes that make it work on (most) machines. I'll be doing beta\nreleases for a little while until I can confirm the new version is stable; use BRAT\n(https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) to easily track Dataview beta versions if you are interested in cutting\nedge features.\n\n---\n\n# 0.4.25\n\nFix #867: Create a container div per taskList to allow for multiple task views.\n\n---\n\n# 0.4.24\n\nRe-release of 0.4.23f since Obsidian does not automatically update between non-semver versions.\n\n---\n\n# 0.4.23f\n\nRemove some code which attempted to make tag queries case-insensitive; I'll reimplement this more generally later (it\nconflicts with existing queries which check tags via `contains(file.tags, \"#Tag\")` and similar).\n\n---\n\n# 0.4.23e\n\nMore task bugfixes / improvements, and a fix that caused task metadata to be duplicated.\n\n---\n\n# 0.4.23d\n\nMore inline field list parsing bug fixes. Hopefully we're back to a nice working order!\n\n---\n\n# 0.4.23c\n\nBugfix which adds support for '1)' style lists, as well as a very annoying null issue due to JavaScript being a very\nsad, very sad language.\n\n---\n\n# 0.4.23b\n\nBugfix for bad inlink/outlink computations; links were not being normalized properly so reverse lookups were not\nworking.\n\n---\n\n# 0.4.23\n\nThe Task Update! This release reworks how dataview handles tasks and list items so that they should be much more\nintuitive to use and interact with:\n\n1. **Subtask Support**: Queries now search over all list items, instead of only over root elements. This should make\n   task filtering much more usable, especially if you tend to put tasks under other list items or care specifically\n   about subtasks.\n2. **Multiline Support**: Dataview now understands multi-line tasks and renders/updates them correctly.\n3. **Immediately Navigate to Task**: The new task view, aside from looking a little cleaner than previous views, now\n   immediately navigates to the task in it's original file on click and selects it.\n4. **Grouping Support**: For DataviewJS users, `dv.taskList` now supports grouping (as produced by `groupBy` and the new\n   `groupIn`) natively.\n\nFor DataviewJS users, the task and list representation has changed: `file.tasks` (and the new `file.lists`) contain\nevery single task (including subtasks) in the file, instead of only the root elements. You can return to previous\nbehavior by filtering out tasks with a non-null parent - i.e., `file.tasks.where(task => !task.parent)`. `dv.taskList`\nwill intelligently deal with properly nesting and de-duplicating tasks, so just filter to the tasks you want to render and\nthe API will do the rest.\n\nThis release also includes general backend improvements as we prepare for live-editing in Dataview views, as well as\nseveral community-contributed API improvements:\n\n- `DataArray#groupIn`: For grouping already grouped data, you can now use `array.groupIn(v => ...)`, which will group\n  the innermost (original) data in the array instead of the top level groups. This allows for more easily grouping\n  recursively, such as `dv.pages().groupBy(page => page.file.folder).groupIn(page => page.title)` producing a grouping\n  of folders, then page titles.\n- `substring(string, start[, end])`: The last major missing string function is now available! Take slices of strings.\n- Improved `dv.el()` and other HTML functions - thanks @vitaly.\n- null and undefined entries sort at the end instead of the beginning by default; sorry to those whose code sorts wrong\n  because of this, but it is a better default for most people's use cases.\n- All links are now properly normalized to their full paths, fixing many link comparison edge cases in DataviewJS.\n\nDocumentation additions for the new task functionality will be coming out in the next few days. The next release 0.4.24\nis currently targeting expanded `FROM` query support, basic table view improvements, and general exporting functionality\nfor Dataview. See you then!\n\n---\n\n# 0.4.22\n\nThe @pjeby update! This includes several performance improvements suggested by @pjeby to dramatically improve background\nDataview performance as well as reduce some memory pressure. It also includes some minor bug-fixes and preliminary\nfunctionality:\n\n- Target ES2018 for better Promise support\n- Allow parsing shorthands in `dv.date()`.\n- Add additional metadata to inline field rendering which can be styled.\n- Cleanup events & workers on plugin uninstall, improving the Dataview uninstall/disable/reload experience.\n- Add preliminary `CALENDAR` queries - rendering similar to the obsidian-calendar plugin, see the documentation!\n\nDataview should perform much better on startup and when you have lots of tabs open - thanks again to @pjeby.\n\n---\n\n# 0.4.21\n\nBugfix release which primarily fixes issues that Dataview had with the live preview mode in upcoming Obsidian versions;\nDataview live preview should now be functional. Also includes a number of smaller bugfixes.\n\n- Fix #646: Add `date(yesterday)` to create a date 24 hours ago.\n- Fix #618: Luxon is now available on the dataview API (`dv.luxon`).\n- Fix #510: Add `dv.duration()` for parsing durations.\n- Fix #647: All HTML functions in the DataviewJS API now return their rendered objects.\n- Fix #652: Fix parsing of invalid dates.\n- Fix #629: Fix block link parsing.\n- Fix #601: Timezones are now rendered properly and parsed properly in Dataview dates.\n- PR #637: Add `meta(link)` which allows you to access various metadata about a link itself.\n- Various minor null safety fixes.\n- Dataview now reports it's exact version and build time in logs.\n\n---\n\n# 0.4.20\n\nSome feature work (mostly by other contributors) while I while away at section metadata. May also fix a few bugs!\n\n- Fix #448: You can now use the \"Task Completion Tracking\" option to automatically add completion metadata to tasks\n  which are checked/unchecked through Dataview. Thanks to @sheeley.\n- Add a search bar to documentation. Thanks to @tzhou.\n- Add new date expressions for the start of the week (`date(sow)`), and the end of the week (`date(eow)`). Thanks\n  @Jeamee and @v_mujunma.\n\nSmall minor bugfix / security releases may follow in the near future; otherwise, the next major release will include\nsection and object metadata.\n\n---\n\n# 0.4.19\n\nBugfix release which corrects emoji parsing & localization issues.\n\n- Add `DataArray#into`, which lets you index into objects without flattening.\n- Renamed 'header' to 'section' in task metadata; 'header' will remain around for a few major releases to let people\n  naturally migrate.\n- Fix #487: You no longer need spaces around '*' in expressions.\n- Fix #559: Fix unicode issues in variable canonicalization which was causing problems with non-Latin inline field\n  keys.\n\n## Duration Parsing\n\nYou can now include multiple units in durations: `dur(8 minutes, 4 seconds)` or `dur(2yr8mo12d)`. You can separate\ndurations by commas, or use the abbreviated syntax with/without spaces.\n\n---\n\n# 0.4.18\n\nBugfix release which fixes bad inline field highlighting if '[' and '(' are mixed on the same line in particular orders.\n\n---\n\n# 0.4.17\n\nMinor feature release to patch up more implementation holes.\n\n## Single File Queries\n\nYou can now query from a specific file (instead of just folders and tags) by specifying the full file path:\n\n```\nTASK FROM \"dataview/Test\"\n...\n```\n\nThis is primarily useful for task queries, but will soon be useful for section and object queries in the near future as\nwell.\n\n## Better Inline Field Highlighting\n\nThe CSS for inline field highlighting has been fixed and some compatibility issues improved, so it should work on all\nthemes now instead of only a few.\n\n## dv.el()\n\nDataviewJS now has `dv.el()`, which is like existing functions like `dv.paragraph` and `dv.span` but can create any\nHTML element type; for example:\n\n```js\ndv.el(\"b\", \"Text!\");\ndv.el(\"i\", 18);\n```\n\n---\n\n# 0.4.16\n\nSmall performance release which substantially reduces the impact Dataview has on vault loading times (by spreading out\nfile loading). The Dataview Index is now also eagerly initialized, so plugin consumers of the API can immediately start\nusing it instead of waiting for the `dataview:api-ready` event.\n\n---\n\n# 0.4.15\n\nA simple fix for #537 which properly 'awaits' value rendering in `dv.view()`. Fixes issues with values rendering out of\norder.\n\n---\n\n# 0.4.14\n\nSmall bugfix release.\n\n- Fixes inline field evaluation when using the new fancy highlighting.\n- You can now configure whether task links should show up at the beginning or end of the task (or just disable them)\n  in the \"Task Link Location\" setting.\n- Most setting updates will immediately be applied to existing Dataviews.\n\n---\n\n# 0.4.13\n\nBugfix release which adds fancy rendering to inline-inline fields and includes a few bugfixes.\n\n## Pretty Inline Fields\n\nInline fields of the form `[key:: value]` will now be rendered with fancy new HTML! By default, they are rendered with\nboth the key and value. You can only render the value using parenthesis instead: `(key:: value)`. You can disable\nthis feature in the configuration.\n\nFull-line inline fields (that Dataview has supported for a long time) will gain similar rendering support soon; in the\nmeanwhile, give the new syntax a try!\n\n### Task Linking\n\nTasks now render with a link to the page/section that they are defined in, making `GROUP BY` and custom task\nediting easier to do:\n\n- [ ] A Task. 🔗\n- [ ] Another Task. 🔗\n    - [ ] Some Random Subtask. 🔗\n\nYou can configure the symbol for the link or disable it altogether.\n\n### Improving DataviewJS Posture\n\nI am currently actively looking into improving DataviewJS sandboxing and general security posture. As a first small step\nin this, I have made DataviewJS opt-in instead of opt-out, and added a separate control for Inline DataviewJS. You may\nneed to re-enable it in your settings if you use it.\n\nMore improvements and better JavaScript sandboxing will follow.\n\n---\n\n# 0.4.12-hotfix1\n\nRe-release of 0.4.12 that fixes an important indexing issue.\n\n- Fix #505: Use `completion` instead of `completed` when setting task completion time.\n- Fix #509: Add `startswith` / `endswith` string functions.\n- Fix #488: Add `padleft` and `padright`, and `string`.\n- Fix #506, #512: Fix date comparisons due to a bizarre date zone issue.\n\n---\n\n# 0.4.12\n\nBugfix release following up 0.4.11 which includes a few minor function additions.\n\n- Fix #512: Strange zone issue causing dates to not be equal.\n- Fix #506: Same as #512.\n- Fix #488: Add `padleft` / `padright` functions.\n- Fix #509: Add `startswith` and `endswith` functions.\n- Fix #505: Correctly read completion dates for tasks from `completion`.\n\nThis release also includes improved testing thanks to mocking Obsidian plugin APIs!\n\n---\n\n# 0.4.11\n\nFixes task behavior and adds \"truly inline\" fields!\n\n## Improved Task Behavior\n\nTask queries are now much improved from their primitive foundations - you can now filter, sort, and group them! The FROM\nblock is still page-based, sadly, though you can simply use `WHERE` instead if desired. For example, you can now access\ntask fields like `text`, `line`, or `completed`:\n\n```\nTASK WHERE contains(text, \"#tag\")\nWHERE !completed\nGROUP BY file.folder\n```\n\nThe full list of all available task metadata can be found\n[here](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/data-annotation/#tasks); tasks include all the information\nneeded to uniquely identify them, and automatically inherit all of the metadata from their parent file as well (so you\ncan access `file.name`, for example). You can also annotate tasks with inline fields, as described in the section below.\n\nThere is some additional UX work to be done - primarily on more easily allowing you to navigate to where the task is\ndefined, as well as render tasks in views other than the `TASK` view.  The semantics of how grouping works (to make it\nmore intuitive/useful than it currently is) will likely also be revisited.\n\n## Inline Inline Fields\n\nEarly support for truly inline fields have been added, where you can add metadata in the middle of a sentence. It looks\nsimilar to existing inline field syntax, but with brackets or parenthesis:\n\n```\nI would rate this a [rating:: 6]. It was (thoughts:: acceptable).\n```\n\nImproved rendering for all inline fields is coming in an upcoming update to improve the visual look of these inline\nfields.\n\n\n## Issues\n\n- Fix #496: Fix task `SORT` functionality to do something.\n- Fix #492: Tasks now properly annotated with parent file information.\n- Fix #498: Fix task checking/unchecking logic (which broke due to a change in the task regex...).\n\n---\n\n# Initial\n\nStart of the automatic changelog.\n"

          "content": "# Obsidian Dataview\n\nTreat your [Obsidian Vault](https://obsidian.md/) as a database which you can query from. Provides a JavaScript API and\npipeline-based query language for filtering, sorting, and extracting data from Markdown pages. See the Examples section\nbelow for some quick examples, or the full [reference](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) for all the details.\n\n## Examples\n\nShow all games in the game folder, sorted by rating, with some metadata:\n\n~~~markdown\n```dataview\ntable time-played, length, rating\nfrom \"games\"\nsort rating desc\n```\n~~~\n\n![Game Example](docs/docs/assets/game.png)\n\n---\n\nList games which are MOBAs or CRPGs.\n\n~~~markdown\n```dataview\nlist from #game/moba or #game/crpg\n```\n~~~\n\n![Game List](docs/docs/assets/game-list.png)\n\n---\n\nList all markdown [tasks](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/data-annotation/#tasks) in un-completed projects:\n\n~~~markdown\n```dataview\ntask from #projects/active\n```\n~~~\n\n![Task List](docs/docs/assets/project-task.png)\n\n---\n\nShow all files in the `books` folder that you read in 2021, grouped by genre and sorted by rating:\n\n~~~markdown\n```dataviewjs\nfor (let group of dv.pages(\"#book\").where(p => p[\"time-read\"].year == 2021).groupBy(p => p.genre)) {\n\tdv.header(3, group.key);\n\tdv.table([\"Name\", \"Time Read\", \"Rating\"],\n\t\tgroup.rows\n\t\t\t.sort(k => k.rating, 'desc')\n\t\t\t.map(k => [k.file.link, k[\"time-read\"], k.rating]))\n}\n```\n~~~\n\n![Books By Genre](docs/docs/assets/books-by-genre.png)\n\n## Usage\n\nFor a full description of all features, instructions, and examples, see the [reference](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/). For a more brief outline, let us examine the two major aspects of Dataview: *data* and *querying*.\n\n#### **Data**\n\nDataview generates *data* from your vault by pulling\ninformation from **Markdown frontmatter** and **Inline fields**.\n\n- Markdown frontmatter is arbitrary YAML enclosed by `---` at the top of a markdown document which can store metadata\n  about that document.\n- Inline fields are a Dataview feature which allow you to write metadata directly inline in your markdown document via\n  `Key:: Value` syntax.\n\nExamples of both are shown below:\n\n```yaml\n---\nalias: \"document\"\nlast-reviewed: 2021-08-17\nthoughts:\n  rating: 8\n  reviewable: false\n---\n```\n```markdown\n# Markdown Page\n\nBasic Field:: Value\n**Bold Field**:: Nice!\nYou can also write [field:: inline fields]; multiple [field2:: on the same line].\nIf you want to hide the (field3:: key), you can do that too.\n```\n\n#### **Querying**\n\nOnce you've annotated documents and the like with metadata, you can then query it using any of Dataview's four query\nmodes:\n\n1. **Dataview Query Language (DQL)**: A pipeline-based, vaguely SQL-looking expression language which can support basic\n   use cases. See the [documentation](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/query/queries/) for details.\n\n   ~~~markdown\n   ```dataview\n   TABLE file.name AS \"File\", rating AS \"Rating\" FROM #book\n   ```\n   ~~~\n\n2. **Inline Expressions**: DQL expressions which you can embed directly inside markdown and which will be evaluated in\n   preview mode. See the [documentation](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/reference/expressions/) for\n   allowable queries.\n\n   ```markdown\n   We are on page `= this.file.name`.\n   ```\n\n3. **DataviewJS**: A high-powered JavaScript API which gives full access to the Dataview index and some convenient\n   rendering utilities. Highly recommended if you know JavaScript, since this is far more powerful than the query\n   language. Check the [documentation](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/api/intro/) for more details.\n\n   ~~~markdown\n   ```dataviewjs\n   dv.taskList(dv.pages().file.tasks.where(t => !t.completed));\n   ```\n   ~~~\n\n4. **Inline JS Expressions**: The JavaScript equivalent to inline expressions, which allow you to execute arbitrary JS\n   inline:\n\n   ~~~markdown\n   This page was last modified at `$= dv.current().file.mtime`.\n   ~~~\n\n#### JavaScript Queries: Security Note\n\nJavaScript queries are very powerful, but they run at the same level of access as any other Obsidian plugin. This means\nthey can potentially rewrite, create, or delete files, as well as make network calls. You should generally write\nJavaScript queries yourself or use scripts that you understand or that come from reputable sources. Regular Dataview\nqueries are sandboxed and cannot make negative changes to your vault (in exchange for being much more limited).\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions via bug reports, bug fixes, documentation, and general improvements are always welcome. For more major\nfeature work, make an issue about the feature idea / reach out to me so we can judge feasibility and how best to\nimplement it.\n\n#### Local Development\n\nThe codebase is written in TypeScript and uses `rollup` / `node` for compilation; for a first time set up, all you\nshould need to do is pull, install, and build:\n\n```console\nfoo@bar:~$ git clone git@github.com:blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview.git\nfoo@bar:~$ cd obsidian-dataview\nfoo@bar:~/obsidian-dataview$ npm install\nfoo@bar:~/obsidian-dataview$ npm run dev\n```\n\nThis will install libraries, build dataview, and deploy it to `test-vault`, which you can then open in Obsidian. This\nwill also put `rollup` in watch mode, so any changes to the code will be re-compiled and the test vault will automatically\nreload itself.\n\n#### Installing to Other Vaults\n\nIf you want to dogfood dataview in your real vault, you can build and install manually. Dataview is predominantly a\nread-only store, so this should be safe, but watch out if you are adjusting functionality that performs file edits!\n\n```console\nfoo@bar:~/obsidian-dataview$ npm run build\nfoo@bar:~/obsidian-dataview$ ./scripts/install-built path/to/your/vault\n```\n\n#### Building Documentation\n\nWe use `MkDocs` for documentation (found in `docs/`). You'll need to have python and pip to run it locally:\n\n```console\nfoo@bar:~/obsidian-dataview$ pip3 install mkdocs mkdocs-material mkdocs-redirects\nfoo@bar:~/obsidian-dataview$ cd docs\nfoo@bar:~/obsidian-dataview/docs$ mkdocs serve\n```\n\nThis will start a local web server rendering the documentation in `docs/docs`, which will live-reload on change.\nDocumentation changes are automatically pushed to `blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview` once they are merged\nto the main branch.\n\n#### Using Dataview Types In Your Own Plugin\n\nDataview publishes TypeScript typings for all of its APIs onto NPM (as `blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview`). For\ninstructions on how to set up development using Dataview, see [setup instructions](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/plugin/develop-against-dataview/).\n\n## Support\n\nHave you found the Dataview plugin helpful, and want to support it? I accept donations which go towards future\ndevelopment efforts. I generally do not accept payment for bug bounties/feature requests, as financial incentives add\nstress/expectations which I want to avoid for a hobby project!\n\n[![paypal](https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donateCC_LG.gif)](https://www.paypal.com/donate?business=Y9SKV24R5A8BQ&item_name=Open+source+software+development&currency_code=USD)\n"
