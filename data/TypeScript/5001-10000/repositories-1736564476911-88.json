          "content": "# How to Contribute\n\nWe'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are\njust a few small guidelines you need to follow.\n\n## Contributor License Agreement\n\nContributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License\nAgreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution,\nthis simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as\npart of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see\nyour current agreements on file or to sign a new one.\n\nYou generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one\n(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it\nagain.\n\n## Adding functionality\n\nOne way to ensure that your PR will be accepted is to add functionality that\nhas been requested in Github issues. If there is something you think is\nimportant and we're missing it but does not show up in Github issues, it would\nbe good to file an issue there first so we can have the discussion before\nsending us a PR.\n\nIn general, we're trying to add functionality when driven by use-cases instead of\nadding functionality for the sake of parity with TensorFlow python. This will\nhelp us keep the bundle size smaller and have less to maintain especially as we\nadd new backends.\n\n### Adding an op\n\nWhen adding ops to the library and deciding whether to write a kernel\nimplementation in [backend.ts](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-core/blob/master/src/backends/backend.ts),\nbe sure to check out the TensorFlow ops list [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/ops/ops.pbtxt).\nThis list shows the kernels available for the TensorFlow C API. To ensure that\nwe can bind to this with node.js, we should ensure that our backend.ts\ninterface matches ops in the TensorFlow C API.\n\n## Code reviews\n\nAll submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We\nuse GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult\n[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more\ninformation on using pull requests.\n\nWe require unit tests for most code, instructions for running our unit test\nsuites are in the documentation.\n"

          "content": "## Development\n\nTo build **TensorFlow.js Core API** from source, we need to clone the project and prepare\nthe dev environment:\n\n```bash\n$ git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-core.git\n$ cd tfjs-core\n$ yarn # Installs dependencies.\n```\n\n#### Yarn\nWe use yarn, and if you are adding or removing dependencies you should use yarn\nto keep the `yarn.lock` file up to date.\n\n#### Code editor\nWe recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for\ndevelopment. Make sure to install\n[TSLint VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-tslint-plugin)\nand the npm [clang-format](https://github.com/angular/clang-format) `1.2.2` or later\nwith the\n[Clang-Format VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xaver.clang-format)\nfor auto-formatting.\n\n#### Testing\nBefore submitting a pull request, make sure the code passes all the tests and is clean of lint errors:\n\n```bash\n$ yarn test\n$ yarn lint\n```\n\nTo run a subset of tests and/or on a specific browser:\n\n```bash\n$ yarn test --browsers=Chrome --grep='multinomial'\nÂ \n> ...\n> Chrome 62.0.3202 (Mac OS X 10.12.6): Executed 28 of 1891 (skipped 1863) SUCCESS (6.914 secs / 0.634 secs)\n```\n\nTo run the tests once and exit the karma process (helpful on Windows):\n\n```bash\n$ yarn test --single-run\n```\n\nTo run the tests in an environment that does not have GPU support (such as Chrome Remote Desktop):\n\n```bash\n$ yarn test --testEnv cpu\n```\n\nAvailable test environments: cpu, webgl1, webgl2.\n\n#### Packaging (browser and npm)\n\n```bash\n$ yarn build-npm\n> Stored standalone library at dist/tf-core(.min).js\n> Stored also tensorflow-tf-core-VERSION.tgz\n```\n\nTo install it locally, run `yarn add ./tensorflow-tf-core-VERSION.tgz`.\n\n> On Windows, use bash (available through git) to use the scripts above.\n\nLooking to contribute, and don't know where to start?
