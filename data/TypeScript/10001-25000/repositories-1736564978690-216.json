That said, when using it in your daily tasks, you will find Claude's inner monolog (thinking process) very very fun and interesting.\n\n## Demo\n\nuse in chat with the latest Chrome extension featured with a instruction selector:\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/afa0f64f-53e5-45bc-9ad8-0641b29d2b77\n\nuse in project with legacy extension:\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88ff0c75-c51b-42b9-a042-00d47053795a\n\n## Overview\n\nThis project consists of two main components:\n\n1. **Thinking Protocol**: A comprehensive set of instructions that guides Claude to think deeply and systematically before responding\n2. **Browser Extension**: A tool that makes Claude's thinking process more readable and manageable in the browser interface\n\n## Project Structure\n\n```bash\nthinking-claude/\nâ”œâ”€â”€ extensions/\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ chrome/          # Current version of Chrome extension\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ chrome_v0/       # Legacy Chrome extension (deprecated)\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ firefox/         # Firefox extension (in development)\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ changelog.md\nâ”œâ”€â”€ model_instructions/\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ changelog.md\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ v5.1-extensive-20241201.md\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ v5.1-20241125.md\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ v5-lite-20241124.md\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ v4-20241118.md\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ v4-lite-20241118.md\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ v3.5-20241113.md\nâ”œâ”€â”€ .github/             # GitHub configurations and workflows\nâ”œâ”€â”€ .husky/             # Git hooks for development\nâ”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE\nâ””â”€â”€ README.md\n```\n\nThe project is organized into two main components:\n\n- `extensions/`: Browser extension implementations\n\n  - `chrome/`: Current version with modern architecture and features\n  - `chrome_v0/`: Legacy version (deprecated)\n  - `firefox/`: Firefox version (in development)\n\n- `model_instructions/`: Thinking protocols for different versions\n  - Contains versioned instruction sets\n  - Each version brings improvements to Claude's thinking process\n\n## Thinking Protocol\n\nThe thinking protocol instructs Claude to follow a natural, thorough thought process before providing responses.\n\n## Browser Extension\n\nThe browser extension makes Claude's thinking process easier to read and use! It automatically organizes Claude's thoughts into neat, collapsible sections.\n\n### Features\n\n- ðŸŽ¯ Makes Claude's thinking process easy to read\n- ðŸ”„ Fold and unfold different parts of Claude's thoughts\n- ðŸ“‹ Copy any part with just one click\n- âš¡ Works automatically with new messages\n- ðŸŽ¨ Clean, modern design that's easy on the eyes\n\n### ðŸš€ Quick Install Guide\n\n1. **Chrome Users (Recommended)**\n\n   - Install directly from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/thinking-claude/ncjafpbbndpggfhfgjngkcimeaciahpo)\n\n2. **Manual Installation**\n   - Download the latest version from our [Releases Page](https://github.com/richards199999/Thinking-Claude/releases)\n   - Unzip the file\n   - Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`\n   - Turn on \"Developer mode\" (top right corner)\n   - Click \"Load unpacked\" and select the unzipped folder `dist`\n\nðŸ‘‰ Want more details? Check out our [Extension Guide](extensions/chrome/README.md) for:\n\n- Step-by-step installation instructions\n- Development setup\n- Advanced features and usage\n- Troubleshooting tips\n\n### ðŸŽ‰ Getting Started\n\nOnce installed, just:\n\n1. Visit [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai)\n2. Click on the `Choose style` selector in the bottom of input box -> click on `Create & Edit Styles` -> click on `Create Custom Style` -> click on `Describe style manually` -> click on `Start from scratch` -> click on `Use custom instructions (advanced)` -> paste the content of the desired instruction set from `model_instructions/` folder\n3. Start chatting with Claude\n4. That's it! The extension will automatically make Claude's thinking process more readable\n\n## Why Use Thinking Claude?\n\n- **Better Reasoning**: Get more thorough and well-thought-out responses\n- **Transparency**: See how Claude arrives at its conclusions\n- **Improved Organization**: Manage long conversations more effectively\n- **Quality Control**: Benefit from built-in verification steps\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome! Feel free to:\n\n- Submit bug reports\n- Propose new features\n- Create pull requests\n\n## License\n\nMIT License - feel free to use and modify as needed.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nSpecial thanks to [@lumpinif](https://github.com/lumpinif) and Claude for the extension!\n"
