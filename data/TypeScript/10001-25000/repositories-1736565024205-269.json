          "content": "# How to Contribute\n\nIlla-builder is one of Illa’s open-source projects that is under very active development. We’re still working out the kinks to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, \nbut we’re not quite there yet. Hopefully this document makes the process for contributing clear and answers some questions that you may have.\n\n## Open Development\n\nAll work on Illa-builder happens directly on GitHub. Both core team members and external contributors send pull requests which go through the same review process.\n\n## Your First Pull Request\n\nWorking on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this free video series:\n\n[How to Contribute to an Open-Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)\n\n## Sending a Pull Request\n\nThe core team is monitoring pull requests. We will review your pull request and either merge it, request changes to it, or close it with an explanation. For API changes we may need to fix our \ninternal uses at Illa, which could cause some delay. We’ll do our best to provide updates and feedback throughout the process.\n\n**Before submitting a pull request**, please make sure the following is done:\n\n1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `beta`.\n2. Run `git submodule init && git submodule update` in the repository root.\n3. Run `pnpm install` in the repository root.\n4. If you’ve fixed a bug or added code that should be tested!\n5. Format your code with prettier `pnpm format`.\n6. Make sure your code lint’s `pnpm lint`.\n\nFor additional information on contributing, you can check out our landing page [Hacktoberfest2023 | Illa Cloud](https://www.illacloud.com/hacktoberfest2023?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=twitter-social-hacktoberfest2023-illa-0925).\n\n## Utilizing Docker (Recommended)\n\nIlla recommends utilizing a docker all-in-one image for making contributions towards illa-builder: \n\n### Creating an Official Image\nTo create an official illa-soft image, execute command:\n\n`docker pull illasoft/illa-builder:latest`\n\nThis command will pull the illa-soft official image and run it in your docker environment.\nBy default, all configurations are for running a production environment. When successfully pulled, Logs will display the ILLA BUILDER BANNER in your docker environment. \n\nNote: You must have the docker image configured for self-host prerequisites.\n\nFor more information on running an Image, check out [Docker all-in-one Image](https://www.illacloud.com/docs/docker-all-in-one-image).\n\n### Deploying Illa Builder via Docker\n\nAll deploys default auto-config settings for a production environment unless your deployment is customized. It's highly recommended deploying with our auto-deploy tools, ILLA CLI.\n\nTo install ILLA-CLI:\n\n```\n#### download illa cli binary file\n> wget https://github.com/illacloud/illa/releases/latest/download/illa-x86_64-linux.tar.gz\n\n#### unpack the file\n> tar -zxvf illa-x86_64-linux.tar.gz\n\n> cd illa-x86_64-linux\n\n> chmod +x illa\n\n#### run the illa cli\n> ./illa\n```\n\n### Contribution Self-host Prerequisites\n\n- You have the latest version of [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) installed.\n- You are familiar with Git.\n- You have docker-all-in-one, illa-cli installed, and illa-builder-backend running on your local machine.\n \n### Confirm self-host prerequisites\n\nNext, check the prerequisites of self-host, execute command:\n\n`./illa doctor`\n\nWhen it's run is complete you should receive a message in green stating \"Success! The minimum requirement for deploying ILLA has been satisfied.\"\nPorts 5432, 9999, 8000, should remain open for deploying ILLA Builder.\n\nFor more information on ILLA CLI and Other Operations check out [ILLA-CLI](https://www.illacloud.com/docs/illa-cli).\n\n### Deploy self-host locally\n\nAfter you have confirmed you meet the minimum requirements for deploying Illa Builder, deploy via either port 5432, 8000, 9345, 9999, or 10000. \nTo deploy Illa Builder via self-host locally, execute command:\n\n`./illa deploy --self --port <PORT>` change `<PORT>` with port number\n\nThis will deploy illa-builder-backend at port `<PORT>`. Then execute command:\n\n`docker run -d -p <PORT>:2022 illasoft/illa-builder:latest` change `<PORT>` with port number\n\nCheck your docker containers and you should find an illasoft/illabuilder container running at Port `<PORT>`:2022.\n\nIf you deploy executing the deploy command as:\n\n`./illa deploy --self`\n\nThis will auto-deploy illa-builder on port 80; you'll be able to access illa-builder at `http://localhost:80`.\n\nOnce you have successfully deployed illa builder and have received the Illa Builder Started, please visit `http://localhost:<PORT>` response,\ngo to the website and login using the credentials:\n\nUsername: root \n\nPassword: password (self-host mode only). \n\nAlternatively, you can deploy/ or change the port by which Illa Builder can be accessed; execute command:\n\n```\n# the port which ILLA Builder can be accessed on can be changed\n# the <MOUNT_PATH> is the custom mount path of ILLA Builder, the default value is a path under the user home directory if not filled\n> illa deploy --self --port=10000 --mount=<MOUNT_PATH>\n```\n\nThe Docker all-in-one Image is built based on the official Debian Image, which makes the username and password for the container the same as the image, \nyou have the option to omit or change the username and password at your discretion.\n\nFor more information on other operations, check out [ILLA-CLI](https://www.illacloud.com/docs/illa-cli).\n\nIf needing to run a self-host production workflow environment version based on deployment at port `<PORT>`, input the following to `apps/builder/env.self`\n\n```\nILLA_API_BASE_URL=localhost:<PORT>  # this is your backend address, if this is not present, it will use the default backend address, location.origin, update <PORT> to port number\nILLA_INSTANCE_ID=SELF_HOST_CLOUD\nILLA_APP_VERSION=0.0.0\nILLA_APP_ENV=production\n```\n\nOnce illa-builder-backend services are running, you can utilize several commands such as:\n\n- `pnpm build-self` creates a self-host production version for the illa-builder frontend repository.\n- `pnpm lint` checks the code style.\n- `pnpm format` format your code with prettier\n- `pnpm dev` preview in real time while coding with cloud version\n- `pnpm dev:self` preview in real time while coding with self-host version\n- `pnpm build-cloud` creates a cloud production version with illa-builder.\n\nFor more information on contributing to illa-builder-frontend check out our [Build All-In-One-Image Dockerfile](https://github.com/illacloud/build-all-in-one-image/blob/main/dockerfile).\n\n\n### Modifying an Image\n\nBy default, all configuration settings for a Docker all-in-one Image are for running a production environment. To modify a created Image, execute command:\n\n`docker exec -it illa_builder /bin/bash`\n\nThe default configuration settings for the Docker all-in-one Image include all environment parameters. You have the option to modify these parameters when you run the container to \naccommodate specific needs or to connect to a database instance. You can review the default configuration parameters at [config.go](https://github.com/illacloud/builder-backend/blob/main/src/utils/config/config.go). \n\n\n### Additional Self-hosting Information\n\nYou can self-host locally with ILLA CLI, Docker compose, k8s helm etc. We’ve repeatedly optimized the self-host process to enable you to make self-host and software deployments in just a few minutes. \nCompared to the cloud, you can use ILLA products more securely and reliably, and you can use ILLA Builder by simply visiting the deployment site after hosting and deploying Builder locally.\n\n### Customized Development Workflow Example\n\nLatest version of Node.js LTS and pnpm are installed/ running. Install from links above following instructions.\n\nClone the illa-builder repository, and run `pnpm install` to fetch its dependencies. Customize your language parameter, i.e. NEXT.js, and create a development workflow environment; input the following to `apps/builder/.env.development.local` And `apps/cloud/.env.development.local`\n\n```\nILLA_API_BASE_URL=localhost:<PORT>  # this is your backend address, if this is not present, it will use the default backend address, location.origin, update <PORT> to port number\nILLA_INSTANCE_ID=SELF_HOST_CLOUD\nILLA_APP_VERSION=0.0.0\nILLA_APP_ENV=development\nILLA_USE_HTTPS=false\nILLA_BUILDER_URL=http://localhost:3000\nILLA_CLOUD_URL=http://localhost:5173\n```\n\n\n### Deploying Manually\n\nAlternatively, you can deploy Illa Builder manually using Docker Compose and Kubernetes.\n\nCheck out instructions for deploying with [Docker Compose](https://github.com/illacloud/deploy-illa-manually/blob/main/docker-compose/README.md), and Instructions for deploying with [Kubernetes](https://github.com/illacloud/deploy-illa-manually/blob/main/kubernetes/README.md).\n\nFor more information on self-hosting, please see the ILA CLI, Docker Compose, and k8s helm boot pages. If you have difficulties with your self-deployment, please review the \n[Deploy Introduction](https://www.illacloud.com/docs/deploy-introduction) Self-host/ Deploy Manually instructions; you can also contact us on GitHub or at business@illasoft.com.\n\n\n## For Rust Developer's\n\nAs a Rust Developer, you can easily build+install the latest ILLA CLI release with cargo, execute command:\n\n`cargo install illa`\n\nThe cargo tool will download the ILLA CLI with its source dependencies, build and install it into the cargo bin path so that we can run it. \n\nOnce installed, you can run the ILLA CLI utilizing the illa command:\n\n`./illa <COMMAND>`\n\nIlla CLI is a tool for hosting ILLA Builder in your local environment. Once installed, execute command `./illa deploy --self --port <PORT>`, update `<PORT>` to port number. Again, this will deploy illa-builder-backend at port `<PORT>`. \nIf needing to modify your `.env.self`, input:\n\n```\nILLA_API_BASE_URL=localhost:<PORT> # update <PORT> to port number\nILLA_INSTANCE_ID=SELF_HOST_CLOUD\nILLA_APP_VERSION=0.0.0\nILLA_APP_ENV=development\nILLA_USE_HTTPS=false\n```\n\n## For GO Developer's\n\nThere is currently no formal documentation for setup with GO, however you're encouraged to check out and contribute to builder-backend here [illa-builder-backend](https://github.com/illacloud/builder-backend).\n"
