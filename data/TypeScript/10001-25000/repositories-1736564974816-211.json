          "content": "# Contribute\n\nThanks for choosing to contribute! We look forward to improving web applications together. Here you will find information on how to propose bug fixes, suggest improvements, and develop locally.\n\n## Better together\nWe believe that the best way to build a better web is together as a community. The React Spectrum project aims to make it easier to build design systems and component libraries with high quality interactions and accessibility for all. The core team and all external contributors follow the same process in order maintain a high quality codebase.\n\n## Code of conduct\nWe adhere to the Adobe [code of conduct](https://github.com/adobe/react-spectrum/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and by participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to Grp-opensourceoffice@adobe.com.\n\n## Reporting issues\n### Bugs\nWe use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/adobe/react-spectrum/issues) to track work and log bugs. Please check existing issues before filing anything new. We do our best to respond to issues within a few days. If you would like to contribute a fix, please let us know by leaving a comment on the issue.\n\nThe best way to reduce back and forth on a bug is provide a small code example exhibiting the issue along with steps to reproduce it. If you would like to work on a bugfix yourself, make sure an issue exists first.\n\nPlease follow the issue templates when filing new ones and add as much information as possible.\n\n### Feature requests\nOur components can always be improved upon. If you have a feature request, you can use our Feature Request issue template. For larger scopes of work, it is a good idea to open a Request For Comments (RFC) first to gather feedback from the team. Please follow our RFC [template](https://github.com/adobe/react-spectrum/blob/main/rfcs/template.md). Make a PR to add your RFC to the [rfcs folder](https://github.com/adobe/react-spectrum/tree/main/rfcs) to give the team and the community a chance to discuss the proposal.\n\n### Security issues\nSecurity issues shouldn't be reported on this issue tracker. Instead, please follow the directions [here](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/alertus.html) to contact our security team.\n\n## Pull Requests\nFor significant changes, it is recommended that you first propose your solution in [an RFC](#feature-requests) and gather feedback.\n\nA few things to keep in mind before submitting a pull request:\n\n- Add a clear description covering your changes\n- Reference the issue in the description\n- Make sure linting and tests pass\n- Include relevant unit tests\n- Add/update stories in storybook for your changes\n- Update documentation\n- Remember that all submissions require review, please be patient.\n\nThe team will review all pull requests and do one of the following:\n- request changes to it (most common)\n- merge it\n- close it with an explanation.\n\nRead [GitHub's pull request documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more information on sending pull requests.\n\nLastly, please follow the pull request template when submitting a pull request!\n\n### Contributor License Agreement\nAll third-party contributions to this project must be accompanied by a signed contributor license agreement. This gives Adobe permission to redistribute your contributions as part of the project. [Sign our CLA](https://opensource.adobe.com/cla.html). You only need to submit an Adobe CLA one time, so if you have submitted one previously, you are good to go!\n\n## Where to start\nThere are many places to dive into react-spectrum to help out. Before you take on a feature or issue, make sure you become familiar with [our architecture](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/architecture.html).\n\nIf you are looking for place to start, consider the following options:\n- Look for issues tagged with help wanted and/or good first issue.\n- Help triage existing issues by investigating problems and following up on missing information.\n- Update missing or fix existing documentation\n- Review and test open pull requests\n\n## Developing\nWhen you are ready to start developing you can clone the repo and start storybook.\nMake sure you have the following requirements installed: [node](https://nodejs.org/) (v14.15.0+) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) (v1.22.0+)\n\nFork the repo first using [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo), then clone it locally.\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/react-spectrum\ncd react-spectrum\nyarn install\n```\n\nYou can then run the storybook and browse to [http://localhost:9003](http://localhost:9003) with:\n```bash\nyarn start\n```\n\nOr run the documentation and browse to [http://localhost:1234/](http://localhost:1234/) with:\n```bash\nyarn start:docs\n```\n\n### Component/Hook scaffolding\nIf you are looking to contribute a brand new component or Hook in a package that does not exist yet, please run the following command.\n```bash\nyarn plop\n```\nThis will start a series of cli prompts to determine what template files and folders should be generated to help quick start your contribution.\nThe prompts are as follows:\n\n1. What type of project are you setting up?\n    - Select \"React Spectrum v3\"\n\n2. Scope name(s)\n    - Select the package scopes that make sense for your contribution (e.g. react-spectrum if you are contributing a component, react-aria for an aria Hook, etc)\n\n3. Package name, all lowercase (e.g. textfield)\n\n4. Component name, please use appropriate uppercase (e.g. TextField)\n    - If you are contributing a non-component Hook, just enter the name of your Hook.\n\n5. Component css module name, blank if N/A. If unsure, check @adobe/spectrum-css-temp/components for a module containing the desired css (e.g. textfield)\n    - If you cannot find the component CSS module name in @adobe/spectrum-css-temp/components, feel free to reach out to a team member via GitHub Issues or Discussions.\n\nUpon answering all the prompts, the appropriate package(s) should be generated and ready for modification.\n\n**Note:** With regards to the generated docs files, please feel free to remove them if you won't be contributing docs. If you are contributing docs for a new component or Hook, please submit them in a separate pull request so that we can decide when to deploy them to our docs site.\n\n### Tests\nWe use [jest](https://jestjs.io/) for unit tests and [react-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) for rendering and writing assertions. Please make sure you include tests with your pull requests. Our CI will run the tests on PRs as well as the linter and type checker. You can see on each PR whether you have passed all our checks. We split the tests into 2 groups.\n\n*Visual tests*\n- A Storybook story should be written for each visual state that a component can be in (based on props).\n\n*Unit tests*\n- (Props) Anything that should be changed by a prop should be tested via react-testing-library.\n- (Events) Anything that should trigger an event should be tested via react-testing-library.\n\nYou can run the tests with:\n\n```bash\nyarn jest\n```\n\nYou can also get a code coverage report by running:\n\n```bash\nyarn jest --coverage\n```\n\n### Linting\nThe code is linted with [eslint](https://eslint.org/). The linter runs whenever you run the tests, but you can also run it with\n```bash\nyarn lint\n```\n\n### TypeScript\nThe code for React Spectrum is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). The type checker will usually run in your editor, but also runs when you run\n```bash\nyarn lint\n```\n\n### Storybook\nWe use [Storybook](https://storybooks.js.org) for local development. Run the following command to start it:\n```bash\nyarn start\n```\nThen, open [http://localhost:9003](http://localhost:9003) in your browser to play around with the components and test your changes.\n\n### Documentation\nOur documentation should always remain up to date. When making changes to components, make sure the appropriate documentation has been updated to reflect those changes. Documentation for each component can be found in the docs folder within a component's package. Other documentation pages can be found in the [packages/dev/docs](https://github.com/adobe/react-spectrum/tree/main/packages/dev/docs) folder in the codebase.\n\nDocumentation can be run locally by using\n```bash\nyarn start:docs\n```\nThen, open [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234) in your browser.\n\n### Verdaccio\nWe use [Verdaccio](https://verdaccio.org/) to set up a private registry for our packages to test our components in our example apps. \n\nTo run verdaccio, first ensure that your `git status` is clean. If your computer has an Intel chip, add the line `shopt -s globstar extglob` in the `verdaccio.sh` file after line 21. Save and commit these changes under a clear message like \"Do not push\". If you have an Apple silicon chip, you may skip this step.\n\nThen, run the following command:\n```bash\n./scripts/verdaccio.sh\n```\n\nOnce that is finished, open up a new terminal and change your directory to the example app you would like to test. You may test it by first running the command:\n```bash\nyarn install\n```\nAnd then the appropriate command to run the development server. Check the project's `package.json` for the correct command.\n\nIf you are running into issues with `yarn install` at this step, you may need to clear your yarn cache. To do this, run this following command:\n```\nrm -r ~/.yarn/berry/metadata/npm\nyarn cache clean --all\n```\n\nOnce you are finished, open the terminal where verdaccio is running and press any key to close the server. If you have an Intel chip, you will need to reset the head of your branch to exclude the change made to the `verdaccio.sh` file.\n\n### Q & A\n\n> `yarn build` emits a bunch of type errors?\n\nHere are a few examples:\n\n```\n@parcel/transformer-typescript-types: Property 'style' does not exist on type 'Element'.\n@parcel/transformer-typescript-types: Property 'type' does not exist on type 'EventTarget'.\n@parcel/transformer-typescript-types: Property 'isContentEditable' does not exist on type 'EventTarget'\n```\n\nYes, [that's normal](https://github.com/adobe/react-spectrum/issues/6937#issuecomment-2311492647).\nIt will complete successfully at the end.\n\n> `yarn build` fails.\n\n```\nparcel build packages/@react-{spectrum,aria,stately}/*/ packages/@internationalized/{message,string,date,number}/ packages/react-aria-components --no-optimize --config .parcelrc-build\nlibc++abi: terminating due to uncaught exception of type std::__1::system_error: mutex lock failed: Invalid argument\nmake: *** [build] Abort trap: 6\nparcel build packages/@react-{spectrum,aria,stately}/*/ packages/@internationalized/{message,string,date,number}/ packages/react-aria-components --no-optimize --config .parcelrc-build\nmake: *** [build] Segmentation fault: 11\n```\n\nIt's likely that you are using a different version of Node.js. Please use Node.js 18. When changing the node version, delete `node_modules` and re-run `yarn install`\n\n> `yarn start` fails.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\n@parcel/core: packages/@react-aria/virtualizer/src/index.ts does not export 'useVirtualizer'\n```\n\nYou may have run `yarn build` before. Please run `make clean_all && yarn` to clean up the build artifacts.\n\nIt may also just be a stale cache, you can try deleting the `.parcel-cache`\n\n## Contributor to committer\n\nWe love contributions from our community! If you'd like to go a step beyond contributor and become a committer with full write access and a say in the project, you must be invited. The existing committers employ an internal nomination process that must reach lazy consensus (silence is approval) before invitations are issued. If you feel you are qualified and want to get more deeply involved, feel free to reach out to existing committers to have a conversation.\n"

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Spectrum provides adaptive, accessible, and cohesive experiences for all Adobe applications.\n\n[Explore React Spectrum](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-spectrum/index.html)\n\n### React Aria\n\nA library of unstyled React components and hooks that helps you build accessible, high quality UI components for your application or design system.\n\n[Learn more about React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/index.html)\n\n### React Stately\n\nA library of React Hooks that provides cross-platform state management for your design system.\n\n[More information about React Stately](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-stately/index.html)\n\n### Internationalized\n\nA collection of framework-agnostic internationalization libraries for the web.\n\n[Internationalized Packages](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/internationalized/index.html)\n\n## Features\n\n* ♿️ **[Accessible](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/accessibility.html)** – Accessibility and behavior is implemented according to [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/), including full screen reader and keyboard navigation support. All components have been tested across a wide variety of screen readers and devices to ensure the best experience possible for all users.\n* 📱 **[Adaptive](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/interactions.html)** – All components are designed to work with mouse, touch, and keyboard interactions. They’re built with responsive design principles to deliver a great experience, no matter the device.\n* 🌍 **[International](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/internationalization.html)** – Support over 30 languages is included out of the box, including support for right-to-left languages, date and number formatting, and more.\n* 🎨 **[Customizable](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-spectrum/theming.html)** – React Spectrum components support custom themes, and automatically adapt for dark mode. For even more customizability, you can build your own components with your own DOM structure and styling using the [React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/index.html) and [React Stately](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-stately/index.html) hooks to provide behavior, accessibility, and interactions.\n\n## Getting started\n\nReact Spectrum includes several libraries, which you can choose depending on your usecase.\n\n* [React Spectrum](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-spectrum/getting-started.html) is an implementation of Adobe's design system. If you’re integrating with Adobe software or would like a complete component library to use in your project, look no further!\n* [React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/getting-started.html) is a collection of unstyled React components and hooks that helps you build accessible, high quality UI components for your own application or design system. If you're building a component library for the web from scratch with your own styling, start here.\n* [React Stately](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-stately/getting-started.html) is a library of state management hooks for use in your component library. If you're using React Aria, you'll likely also use React Stately, but it can also be used independently (e.g. on other platforms like React Native).\n\n[Read more about our architecture](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/architecture.html).\n\n## Contributing\n\nOne of the goals of the React Spectrum project is to make building design systems and component libraries as easy as possible, while maintaining high quality interactions and accessibility support. We aim to raise the bar for web applications. The best way to achieve that goal is **together**. We would love contributions from the community no matter how big or small. 😍\n\nRead our [contributing guide](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/contribute.html) to learn about how to propose bugfixes and improvements, and how the development process works. For detailed information about our architecture, and how all of the pieces fit together, read our [architecture docs](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/architecture.html).\n"
