          "content": "# Contributing to `tamagui`\n\nWe are grateful your contributions to Tamagui. A couple guidelines:\n\n- Assume good intentions.\n- Stay constructive.\n\n#### Table of content\n\n- [Contributing to `tamagui`](#contributing-to-tamagui) - [Table of content](#table-of-content)\n  - [Set up your development environment](#set-up-your-development-environment)\n  - [Issue and Pull Request Guidelines](#issue-and-pull-request-guidelines)\n    - [Issues](#issues)\n    - [Pull Requests](#pull-requests)\n  - [UI Kit Contributions](#ui-kit-contributions)\n    - [Bugs and Fixing them](#bugs-and-fixing-them)\n    - [Testing](#testing)\n  - [Documentation Contributions](#documentation-contributions)\n  - [Other ways to Contribute](#other-ways-to-contribute)\n\n## Set up your development environment\n\nSince Tamagui is a monorepo it's quite easy to contribute to which ever part you're interested in, just go to the particular directory and you're set. To set up your development environment you'll first need clone the Tamagui repo:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui\n```\n\nThis might take some time depending on your internet speed. Once it's done run the following command to install the dependencies:\n\n```bash\nyarn install\n```\n\nAnd then build the app:\n\n```bash\nyarn build\n```\n\nYou may see some errors due to encryption, as the studio has encrypted contents. This is fine and won't affect contributions to Tamagui.\n\nThat's it! You should be good to go. As you are developing you'll also want to have a `yarn watch` running somewhere ongoing to ensure packages JS and types are rebuilt as you iterate.\n\n## Issue and Pull Request Guidelines\n\nDo not open issues for general support questions, that is what our [discord](https://discord.gg/vhEKmdCZw6) is for. Please do not open pull requests that do not address pre-existing issues, unless spoken about and approved in our discord. These rules are to uphold order and code quality, and most of all separate the wheat from the chaff.\n\n### Issues\n\nWhen opening issues please make sure that they adhere to these guidelines:\n\n- Bug reports:\n\n  - Make sure that your bug is reproducible and not a one off thing.\n  - Make sure that your bug is Tamagui specific and not an integration with other libraries that we might not support yet. (Seek help in discord for these).\n  - Use the Reproducible Bug Report template for all bug reports.\n\nFor now this is the only GitHub issue we support, for any other kinds of issues or general questions please join our discord and feel free to ask for help in the `help-casual` channel or open a help discussion in the `help board`.\n\nIf your issue does not adhere to these guidelines, in order to save everyone's time we will close it on sight.\n\n### Pull Requests\n\nWe're grateful to the community for contributing to the code base.\n\nWhen opening a Pull Request:\n\n- Give the person reviewing your code context to the problem and the solution.\n- If possible, try to keep PR's small and tightly scoped.\n\n## UI Kit Contributions\n\n**Note**: While developing, you'll want to watch the build watching in a dedicated terminal.\n\n```bash\nyarn watch\n```\n\n**Note**: you may see some errors around \"studio\" as you run build - this is fine, we encrypt some of the non-open-source projects in the repo. The errors do not block anything.\n\n### Bugs and Fixing them\n\nTo report unexpected behavior, such as components not rendering correctly, unresponsive components, incompatibilities with supported libraries etc.\n\nThank you for taking the time to let the Tamagui team and community know about the issue.\n\nWhen making pull requests addressing bug, please make sure that the PR:\n\n- [ ] Gives context to the reviewer, step-by-step if possible on how to reproduce the issue before the code change, and what functionality is broken.\n- [ ] The solution does not regress another part of the code base.\n- [ ] The solution is current with `master` branch.\n- [ ] The solution should have tests (if needed)\n\n### Testing\n\nIt's easiest to use the sandbox project to test and develop things for web:\n\n```bash\nyarn sandbox\n```\n\n`sandbox` runs on\n[port 9000](http://localhost:9000/)\n\nThis runs a client-side only Vite build of Tamagui, with a complete configuration already set up.\n\nnative test are run in `code/kitchen-sink`\n\nCreate a development build run `yarn ios` from `code/kitchen-sink`\n\nExpo go is not supported in `kitchen-sink`. `kitchen-sink` uses a custom built version of `react-native-reanimated` so we can test everything including the various native integrations like native Sheet and native toasts. If you run Expo Go on `kitchen-sink` Metro's eager require eval errors due to demos folder being glob imported.\n\n```bash\n# Android\nyarn kitchen-sink:build:android\n\n# iOS\nyarn kitchen-sink:build:ios\n```\n\nAfter the build has been completed, run the below command to start the Expo app:\n\n```bash\nyarn kitchen-sink\n```\n\nOnce you've made changes, you can add tests. All compiler and CSS generation tests live in `packages/static-tests`, other tests live in `code/kitchen-sink/tests` or in other `-tests` packages.\n\nBefore submitting a PR, please check everything works across every combination of environments.\n\nTo do so, run the site first in development to test if it works entirely at runtime:\n\n```bash\n# Make sure you have run `yarn watch` before you execute this command.\n\nyarn site\n```\n\n`site` runs on [port 5005](http://localhost:5005)\n\nYou use `pages/test.tsx` as an easy way to load things. If it looks good, try running again with the compiler on:\n\n```bash\nyarn site:extract\n```\n\nFinally, if that looks good, build to production and test that:\n\n```bash\nyarn site:prod\n```\n\nThis flow ensures it works with Vite, Webpack, Metro, Next.js with SSR, and with the compiler both on and off.\n\n## Other ways to Contribute\n\nTo get more involved in the community, join the [discord](https://discord.gg/vhEKmdCZw6)\n"

In the [~500px² responsive browser section](https://tamagui.dev) of the Tamagui website, 49 of the 55 or so [inline styled components](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/blob/master/code/tamagui.dev/components/HeroResponsive.tsx) are flattened to a `div`. The homepage gains nearly 15% on Lighthouse with the compiler on.\n\n[Learn more on the website](https://tamagui.dev/docs/intro/introduction).\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nTo contribute to Tamagui reference the [contributing guide](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nTo contribute to documentation reference the [writing guide](https://github.com/tamagui/tamagui/blob/master/code/tamagui.dev/WRITING-GUIDE.md).\n"

Needs to be an array. but compiler errors on Types of property 'transform' are incompatible. Type '{ translateX: string; }[]' is not assignable to type 'Transform | undefined'.\n\nhttps://linear.app/uniswap/issue/WEB-4733/tamagui-transform-needs-array-to-work-but-type-expects-string\n\n- bug: if you name a file `polyfill-native.ts` tamagui-biuld doesnt output the .native files properly\n\n- When using <Adapt.Contents />  inside an Adapt when=\"sm\"  it seems to hide the children before fully closed\n  - https://uniswapteam.slack.com/archives/C07AHFK2QRK/p1723409606028379\n\n- When opening a fit Sheet while keyboard is active (at least on ios) the height of the sheet is off\n  - https://uniswapteam.slack.com/archives/C07AHFK2QRK/p1723475036176189\n  \n- AnimatePresence leaving things in DOM\n  - https://uniswapteam.slack.com/archives/C07AHFK2QRK/p1723148309745679\n\n\n\na way to set styles for children:\n\n```tsx\n// we could just use classnames?\n\nimport { Style } from '@tamagui/core'\n\nconst Text = styled(Text, {\n  className: 'button-item',\n})\n\nconst Icon = styled(Text, {\n  className: 'button-item',\n})\n\nconst Button = withStaticProperties(ButtonFrame, {\n  Icon,\n  Text\n})\n\nconst example = (\n  <Button gap=\"$4\">\n    {/* prefer not renaming so compiler can optimize: */}\n    <Style selector=\".button-item\" color=\"$color10\">\n      {/* all of these 👇 get the styles from ^ */}\n      <Button.Text /> \n      <Button.Text />\n      <Button.Text />\n      <Button.Icon $button-hover={{}} />\n    </Style>\n  </Button>\n)\n```\n\n---\n\nv4 and beyond\n\n- flatMode - no nested objects, everything in flat props\n- plugins\n\n---\n\n- Dialog => Sheet adapt performance\n  - see // TODO this will re-parent, ideally we would not change tree structure\n\n- SSR safe styled context, something like:\n\nconst Context = createStyledContext({\n  isVertical: {\n    $sm: true,\n    $gtSm: false,\n  },\n})\n\n\n- Select is using focusScope which React.Children.only erroring in most usages\n  - we should try and redo FocusScope to not cloneElement at all and instead wrap with an element + display: contents\n\n---\n\n- Dialog.Portal and <Dialog modal /> redundant\n\n- as long as you use the nextjs or other new color scheme helpers they always add t_dark/t_light on first render so as long as youre ok with dark mode not working for js-off users, you could turn default the tamagui/config v4 to shouldAddPrefersColorThemes: false\n\n- lower priority uniswap:\n  - seems <Switch checked defaultChecked> isnt showing in the checked position\n  - <Theme name=\"dark\"> with switch, the thumb is not picking up the right surface color, must be a multiple-nested theme issue\n\n- small win: `useTheme()` could take a theme name to use a diff theme than the current one\n\n- bug in useMedia + compiler\n  - https://app.graphite.dev/github/pr/Uniswap/universe/10626/fix-web-toast-alignment\n\n/theme\n\n- randomize button for palettes\n- OG image of theme card (use the tree one we used for the list of themes in studio)\n- save\n- use on bento\n\n- AnimatePresence refactor:\n  - https://x.com/mattgperry/status/1816842995758498017?s=46&t=5wFlU_OsfjJ0sQPMFbtG0A\n\n- className merging in variants!\n  - `positionSticky: { true: { className: 'position-sticky' } }`\n- opacity `/50`\n- AnimateList\n  - like AnimatePresence but for >1 items\n  - AnimatePresence keepMounted={} prop?\n  - can handle direction + let you control mount behavior\n\n- remove scroll not working when Dialog adapted to Sheet on mobile\n  - we may want Sheet to have its own removeScroll in this case\n\n- AnimatePresence should just work if you change the enterStyle exitStyle dynamically in the render, no need for custom we can capture the props\n\n- popover transform origin\n  - https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/floating-ui-react-scale-transform-origin-qv0t1c?file=%2Fsrc%2FApp.tsx%3A43%2C25\n- Setting default props for any style in a parent (variables dynamic / themes dynamic down the tree)\n\n- Popover click outside prop\n\n- data-disable-theme is being passed down on web snapshots\n- activeTheme props for all components\n- in dev mode if no checkbox indicator, warn\n  - checkbox should have a default indicator probably with a simple svg check we inline\n- move from useMedia match.addListener to addEventListener\n- media query height taking into account the \"safe height\" is important\n- https://linear.app/uniswap/issue/EXT-925/tamagui-error-breaking-the-extension\n- document Popover.Anchor\n- Sometimes press getting stuck still on uniswap moonpay flow\n- Text vertical align issue: https://github.com/Uniswap/universe/pull/6730\n\n- Popper arrow logic is bad, needs unstyled support and not to do weird shifting of sizes\n\n- No need for View + Text (just Element and we can extend it later)\n\n  - We'd need to mimic text inhertance on native (or remove it on web)\n  - https://github.com/facebook/react-strict-dom/blob/429e2fe1cb9370c59378d9ba1f4a40676bef7555/packages/react-strict-dom/src/native/modules/createStrictDOMComponent.js#L529\n\n- <Theme name=\"dark\"> force below root dark causing hydration issues\n\n- Animation + shadowOffset is causing crash in iOS due to object value\n\n  - \"auto\" too\n\n- Adapt needs public API to support any adaptation\n\n- Select Virtualization\n\n- settings page in takeout SSR hydration issue due to useThemeSetting\n\n- animatedStyle showing up in animated component snapshot on native\n\n  - add some native snapshots in ci tests\n\n- addTheme updateTheme regression needs a test\n\n- type to search on Select regressed\n\n- // TODO: pulling past the limit breaks scroll on native, need to better make ScrollView\n\n- icons move from themed() to just styled()\n\n- native theme change warning logs + theme change speed\n\n- document popover hoverable + onOpenChange second arg via\n\n- add $mouse to takeout\n\n- compiler - no need to setup any separate package\n\n- Remove the need for Text\n\n- popovers work with no js\n\n- Select `ListItemFrame` area is messy/slow due to inline styles and complex components\n- propMode\n\n- make styled() only not accept most non-style props\n\n- Scale / ScaleSelect\n  should be a Menu with mini visualizations of the lum/sat scales for each\n\n- gradient style\n- \"var\" mode where it changes types of $ to var(--)\n- calc?\n\n- get takeout users studio access\n\n- studio color scales first class:\n\n  - adding a color/scale really adds a theme\n  - but also adds $colorName1 => $colorNameX to base theme\n\n- check usePropsAndStyle with group props\n\n- alt themes don't change color1-9 so you can't do color2 and then make the alt theme make it more subtle, but they should\n\n- disableClassName breaking css animation\n- css animateOnly should always force style tag styles\n\n- 2.0 make it just is the current state with fixes, unstyled across everything, and make various smaller breaking changes in api surfaces that need cleanup\n\n  - recommended config with more strict settings etc\n  - a few theme setups you can choose from\n\n- Takeout theme change needs a server restart / theme builder not re-building on changing colors.ts\n- Theme reset Button not changing\n- ZStack is abs positioning children...\n\n---\n\nWeb:\n\n- createTamagui({ settings: { webMode: true } })\n- avoids console warning on Text\n- `@tamagui/style` separate from core\n- instead of validStyleProps use validNONStyleProps\n  - that way for web all style props pass through automatically\n  - also likely smaller bundle size (smart detect `onX`)\n- have a CSS mode\n- styled('div')\n- avoid flat style props + plugin for styled() control\n- beforeStyles + afterStyles array\n\n---\n\n`style`\n\n- enables Input taking { autofillSelectedStyle: Style }, or any component accepting a style object as a prop\n\n```tsx\nimport { Stack, style } from '@tamagui/core'\n\n// make it so style props accepts either a regular style object\n// or something like this (can be exported from core):\n\ntype StackStyle = {\n  base: ViewStyle\n  press?: ViewStyle\n  hover?: ViewStyle\n  focus?: ViewStyle\n}\n\nconst mySubStyle: StackStyle = style({\n  backgroundColor: 'red', // optimizes on web to _bg-red\n\n  pressStyle: {\n    backgroundColor: 'blue', // optimizes on web to _press-bg-blue\n  }\n})\n\nconst MyComponent = (props: { accentedStyle?: StackStyle }) => {\n  return (\n    <Stack style={[accentedStyle]} />\n  )\n}\n\n\n```\n\nconfig: {\n  styleStrategy: { type: 'prop', prop: 'sx', acceptFlatStyles: true }\n}\n\n---\n\nSmaller features:\n\n- no-rerender psuedo styles on native when using reanimated driver (fernando PR)\n- imperative methods for many things - sheet, popover, etc, close etc\n- ssr safe themeInverse would be pretty nice\n- styled(ExternalComponent) should always allow Partial props\n  - but if you do provide the props ideally it should 'know' they are pre-filled and therefore not required anymore\n  - also it should make sure to make those props required if they aren't set in styled()\n- avoid css extract on server mode next.js?\n\n---\n\nPerformance:\n\n- TAMAGUI_OPTIMIZE_NATIVE_VIEWS on by default using proper prop mapping\n- compiler can add `disableEvents` `disableTheme` to avoid hooks\n- optimization of useTheme/getSplitStyles seems like it has some decent stuff\n- could lazy expand styles\n- get dynamicEval working automatically\n- warn on styled(Pressable) and styled(TouchableOpacity)\n\n---\n\nCLI:\n\n- `tama upgrade` - official tamagui upgrade that works across bundlers\n- `tamagui [clone|eject] Sheet ./packages/sheet`\n  - clones the sheet package into your repo somewhere\n\n---\n\nComponents:\n\n- Native\n\n  - Select\n    - iOS Select as well as the newer SwiftUI menu style Picker\n  - Sheet native android - https://github.com/intergalacticspacehighway/react-native-android-bottomsheet\n\n- Menu\n- DatePicker\n\n---\n\n# Backlog\n\n- Popover.Close inside Sheet\n\n- merge font-size and get-font-sized packages\n\n- cli needs a start update command just runs diff against your `~/.tamagui/tamagui`\n\n- sheet native iOS snapPoints\n\n  - pre release 2.0 version of library\n  - https://github.com/dominicstop/react-native-ios-modal/blob/wip/example/src/examples/Test09.tsx\n\n- CI not failing on type errors in code/tamagui.dev\n  a package.json etc etc + zip file\n\n- @alt Sheet inside Popover breaks css animation:\n\n  - https://tamagui.dev/docs/components/popover\n\n- Studio: drag and drop a font and you can configure the subset\n\n  - automatically converts to the right output formats\n  - auto generates CSS\n  - bundles it into\n\n- <Sheet native />\n  - https://github.com/dominicstop/react-native-ios-modal\n  - we'd want expo module + snap points\n\n- <ActionSheet />\n- plus `native` prop https://reactnative.dev/docs/actionsheetios\n\n- add test that builds site for prod + checks for header text / no errors\n\n- Switch unstyled - make it so it doesn't do any theme stuff\n\n- font weights in css are generating extra variables with \"undefined\" value if not filled in\n- add defaultSize and defaultFontFamily to createTamagui\n\n  - all instances of $true can become getConfig().defaultSize\n  - remove the validation in createTamagui that enforces the keys\n\n- bug: inputs rendering twice due to focusableInputHOC, if you remove that it doesn't, this is due to styled() + how it determines ComponentIn and grabs the component\n\n- getVariableValue(props.fontFamily) doesn't look right\n\n- prebuild option\n  - de-dupes css\n  - fixes next.js next load css\n  - simplifies initial setup and need for plugins\n- site snack + demo embed on all pages floating that scales up on hover on large screengrid or augment\n- pass Size down context (see Group) is this just Themes but for individual props (css variable direct support <Theme set={{ size: '$4' }}> ?)?\n- kitchen sink snack on site\n- @tamagui/tailwind\n- pass Size down context (see Group) but really this is just Themes but for individual props (css variable direct support <Theme set={{ size: '$4' }}> ?)\n- <ActionSheet />\n- check deps are matching in compiler startup\n- can optimize useMedia / many hooks:\n  - https://twitter.com/sebmarkbage/status/1576603375814070273\n- dual direction scrollview shouldn't need two nested see CodeDemoPreParsed\n- container queries\n- `variantsOnly: true` on styled(), removes types for anything but variants (and className/theme etc)\n- way to use tamagui with custom design system tokens\n  - basically map any tokens you choose to internal tamagui ones\n- input like button\n- allow string values alongside numbers (nativebase port)\n- media `$light` and `$dark` for overrides\n- built in jsx => css converter\n- `tag` => `as` (keep fallback around as deprecated)\n  - `as={['a', { ...props }]}`\n- breaking change notifier cli\n- VSCode => \"turn JSX into styled()\"\n- pass in SharedValue to any prop for animations\n- try using react-native-web $css object support for classnames\n- animation accept useAnimatedStyle\n- Switch gesture\n- <Icon />\n  - use theme values and size values\n  - can swap for other icon packs (use createTamagui({ icons }))\n- <Text fontSize=\"parent\" />\n- <UL /> <LI /> <OL />\n- hoverStyle={{ [XStack]: {} }}\n- <List.Section /> see (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/list Section)\n- <GradientText /> can work native with\n  - https://github.com/react-native-masked-view/masked-view\n- beforeStyle, afterStyle could work ...\n  - only if we can do with pseudos:\n    - focusStyle={{ after: { fullscreen: true, border... } }}\n    - allows for proper focused borders that don't require super hacks\n    - see Switch\n  - radio may be List.Radio just combines List, Label, Drawer\n    - can use Switch or check or custom\n- skeleton just using Theme / variables\n\n*Skeleton\n\n```tsx\nconst Skeleton = styled(Stack, {\n  animation: {\n    name: 'quick',\n    loop: true\n  },\n  enterStyle: {\n    x: '100%',\n  },\n  exitStyle: {\n    x: '-100%',\n  },\n  background: `linear-gradient(to left, $background, $color, $background)`,\n})\n```\n"
