However, this caused issues on servers that have their ports blocked by firewall, see https://github.com/githubsaturn/captainduckduck/issues/237\r\n\r\nAlthough it's not a bug in CaptainDuckDuck, it might cause confusion for new users, hence, a precheck for firewall test is added to the installation phase. If a firewall on important ports is detected, the user will be warned with a proper message and an instruction on how to disable firewall.\r\n\r\n## [V0.7.1] - 2018-05-14\r\n\r\nAdded:\r\n\r\n-   Ability to override default values. This includes overriding default Captain dashboard subdomain and etc.\r\n-   Allowing precheck for wildcard domain to be skipped if the provider doesn't support wildcard\r\n-   One-click apps can now be deployed with specific tags (versions)\r\n-   The user can now optionally change the instance count of persistent apps.\r\n-   Unused images clean up added to settings\r\n\r\nImproved:\r\n\r\n-   Back button works as expected in apps settings page\r\n-   Sticky footer for Save and Delete buttons on the app page\r\n-   Move Docker registry settings to Nodes page from the main dashboard page\r\n-   Revealing real IP by using `mode=host` for nginx\r\n\r\n## [V0.6.0] - 2018-02-10\r\n\r\nAdded:\r\n\r\n-   Build logs are now available on web dashboard, you can view build logs initiated with Github webhooks as well.\r\n-   Added Redis as a one-click app\r\n-   Added prechecks on OS and Docker version when installing CaptainDuckDuck to ensure maximum compatibility\r\n\r\nFixed:\r\n\r\n-   NetData container removal is retrofitted to avoid some Docker deadlocks\r\n-   Flashing issue for logged out state on Dashboard\r\n-   Login issue on small phone screen\r\n-   Fixed issue with very long domain names\r\n\r\nImproved:\r\n\r\n-   Default client max size for Captain is changed to 500mb\r\n-   Message for self-hosted registry is changed to be more clear so user won't be surprised with an expected error\r\n-   More details on error messages related to custom domains\r\n\r\n## [0.5.3] - 2018-01-11\r\n\r\nFixed:\r\n\r\n-   Third-party private registries limited via username scope were not correctly getting authenticated (https://github.com/githubsaturn/captainduckduck/commit/81fe0408b05dae0d9f4c84c5546c54dfb6845259)\r\n\r\nImproved:\r\n\r\n-   Push error are now throwing proper error rather than confusing 500 error\r\n-   If something fails when app is getting created, the premature entry is now automatically deleted from the app database\r\n\r\n## [V0.5.1] - 2018-01-09\r\n\r\n**BREAKING CHANGES:**:\r\n\r\n-   Make sure that your CLI version is at least `1.0.11`\r\n    -- To check your current version: `captainduckduck -V`\r\n    -- To update: `sudo npm install -g captainduckduck`\r\n-   Breaking change in your `captain-definition` files:\r\n    -- if you have `python` as your template, you should change it to `python-django`\r\n-   Setting a max on log size files does not apply to existing containers. To use the same log size cap for current services, run:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker service update  --log-driver json-file --log-opt max-size=512m  captain-nginx\r\ndocker service update  --log-driver json-file --log-opt max-size=512m  captain-captain\r\ndocker service update  --log-driver json-file --log-opt max-size=512m  captain-certbot\r\ndocker service update  --log-driver json-file --log-opt max-size=512m  captain-registry\r\ndocker service update  --log-driver json-file --log-opt max-size=512m  captain-app1   # replace app 1 and app 2 with your app names\r\ndocker service update  --log-driver json-file --log-opt max-size=512m  captain-app2    # replace app 1 and app 2 with your app names\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Features added:\r\n\r\n-   Ruby/Rack support added (see https://github.com/githubsaturn/captainduckduck/pull/45)\r\n-   Support for showing build logs when deploying via command line added (https://github.com/githubsaturn/captainduckduck/commit/b64c3172df5dc8da1970e64d480f9a546ec53851). Simply running `captainduckduck deploy` now shows the build logs.\r\n-   Added CouchDB as one-click app\r\n\r\n### Improved:\r\n\r\n-   Added UDP protocol to Port Forwarding (previously it was only TCP)\r\n-   Container log files are now maxed at 512MB per container by default in order to avoid high unnecessary disk usage. It can be changed by updating service manually, e.g., `docker service update srv-captain--app-name --log-driver json-file --log-opt max-size=2048m`\r\n-   Captain now runs a `docker container prune` to clean up stopped containers\r\n-   NetData startup script improved and auto restart is now enabled by default\r\n-   Wrong app name during deploy now returns a more specific message to hint the user instead of plain 500\r\n\r\n## [0.4.0] - 2017-12-31\r\n\r\nNew:\r\n\r\n-   Added ability to Enorce HTTPS for apps! (https://github.com/githubsaturn/captainduckduck/issues/2)\r\n-   Advanced users are now able to customize their nginx configurations (allowing http2, process counts, cache config, custom redirects and etc). https://github.com/githubsaturn/captainduckduck/issues/44\r\n-   Added a custom `nginx-shared` directory for using custom files in nginx container (https://github.com/githubsaturn/captainduckduck/issues/71). Using this combined with customized nginx config, you can use custom SSL certificates, custom static assets and etc.\r\n-   Persistent directories (volumes) can now be specified as path on host machine.\r\n\r\nImproved:\r\n\r\n-   Health-check calls are now more reliable with the newly added timeout.\r\n\r\nFixed:\r\n\r\n-   Force HTTPS button on web dashboard now gets disabled if Force HTTPS is activated. (https://github.com/githubsaturn/captainduckduck/commit/efc43849e892e6f1032072f4c64317f0946b23af)\r\n\r\nCLI (1.0.9):\r\n\r\n-   Added a `--default` flag to `captainduckduck deploy` to avoid re-entering server address and other information.\r\n\r\n## [0.3.1] - 2017-12-27\r\n\r\nFixed:\r\n\r\n-   In cluster mode, the initial instance was always getting created on main node due to wrong image tag (https://github.com/githubsaturn/captainduckduck/commit/c6e9e4b0c25181ecf9ae7f8eec42379685a6726c)\r\n-   GitLab support added for automated deployment\r\n\r\nImproved:\r\n\r\n-   Deploy now reports all kinds of errors. No more ambiguous status 500 error.\r\n-   Changed healthcheck interval to 20sec from 5sec to make the logs less verbose\r\n\r\nCLI improvements (1.0.8)\r\n\r\n-   Fixed logout causing all other instances to get logged out\r\n-   Improved deploy process by pre-checking `captain-definition` file.\r\n-   Improved saving app name if it's getting re-deployed.\r\n\r\n## [0.3.0] - 2017-12-19\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n-   :octocat: automatic branch tracking and deployment through Github and Bitbucket :confetti_ball:\r\n-   Added ability to expose container ports and map them to host ports\r\n-   Adding ability to change nodeId of apps with persistent data\r\n-   Added ability to set a custom initial password instead of `captain42`\r\n-   Allow customDomain === rootDomain, see https://github.com/githubsaturn/captainduckduck/pull/24\r\n-   Improve build error messages by including last 20 lines of logs that led to build error.\r\n-   Changed max request size to 500mb for apps (temporary solution until fully customizable nginx config is ready)\r\n\r\nBugfixes:\r\n\r\n-   Instance count of `0` is not respected. FIXED. https://github.com/githubsaturn/captainduckduck/issues/48#issuecomment-352289264\r\n\r\nBreaking Change:\r\n\r\n-   If you were manually setting port mapping on your containers before this release, make sure to re-map them through Captain interface. Since port mapping is added to the interface, Captain would override the current port mapping that you might have on your containers. If you didn't manually modified your containers `--publish-add` flag, you don't need to worry about this.\r\n\r\n## [ v0.2.2] - 2017-12-05\r\n\r\nHotfix:\r\n\r\n-   Fix a bug in web UI that was introduced in v0.2.1. Save configuration button was not functioning.\r\n\r\n## [0.2.1] - 2017-12-04\r\n\r\nA major release!! 🎉🎉\r\n\r\n**New Features:**\r\n\r\n-   Support for Persistent Data:\r\n    Previously, Captain only had support for apps with no persistent. The main drawback was that one could not deploy a database using Captain. Now the feature is fully supported.\r\n-   One-click apps:\r\n    This is perhaps the most interesting feature of new release. Although adding support for persistent data, technically speaking, was enough for the developers to deploy databases. But wouldn't it be nicer if installing MySql, MongoDB and etc becomes as easy as selecting a name from a list? :wink: Done! Not only that, off-the-shelf apps are being slowly added to this list. Installing WordPress, Parse-Server, Tumbor is now as easy as installing apps on your phone!\r\n\r\n**Improvements:**\r\n\r\n-   New tabular design for the apps page enables you to have tens of apps and be able to navigate easily from one to another.\r\n-   Deployment from the web interface now accepts tar archive files of the source directory, not necessarity content. See https://github.com/githubsaturn/captainduckduck/issues/22\r\n\r\n## [0.1.2] - 2017-11-17\r\n\r\nBugfixes:\r\n\r\n-   Added support for build errors: now build errors get reported as build failure and the image is not created. Previously, build errors were being ignored.\r\n\r\nImprovements:\r\n\r\n-   Fixed multiple typos\r\n-   Added more details on how apps internally can talk to each other\r\n-   Added functionality to disable \"Expose As Web App\". Now if you are deploying an app that's only being used as an internal service, you have the option not to expose it via a public URL. This is also useful when in the next release Captain starts supporting databases as they are web-apps at all.\r\n-   Added underlying structure for supporting databases. Since it's not thoroughly tested, the UI is still hidden.\r\n"

          "content": "# Before Contributing\n\nWhen contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,\nemail, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. The best way is our Slack channel (link at the footer of CapRover.com)\n\nPlease note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.\n\n## IMPORTANT: CapRover Goals & Scope\n\nSince the birth of CapRover, there has been many contributions and suggestions that shaped CapRover as we know it today. One of the very important factor in the contribution you make is to stick with CapRover design philosophy.- CapRover is not an enterprise grade application like Kubernetes. _Do not_ patch it with half-done features that make it look like one - it will eventually fail as we don't have resources to support such features.- CapRover scope is a helper around Docker, nginx and Let's Encrypt.\n\nThe goal is to make the common use-cases exposed via simple controls on UI while allowing further customizations to be done through hooks and scripts. If a new feature is doable via the existing features, or a basic tool, do not add it to CapRover. We do not want to bloat this application. One example is: \"Add a flag to customize the placement constraints of containers\". This is definitely doable in Docker, but we don't want to mirror every single functionality of Docker to CapRover. If we do that, CapRover becomes a very hard to maintain project. Instead we should add customization hooks for these advanced and rare use cases. For example, instead of mirroring every single nginx config, we added the ability of customizing the nginx config for advanced users.- Last but not least AVOID LARGE PULL REQUESTS at all cost as they won't get reviewed unless they are discussed in the Slack channel beforehand.\n\n## Pull Request Process\n\n1. IF APPLICABLE: Update the docs (https://github.com/caprover/caprover-website) with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment\n   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.\n2. Make sure your commit comments are self explanatory.\n3. Discuss the changes you want to make beforehand.\n4. Please avoid making opinion-based changes if it's just a code-style change - this includes, but not limited to, changes to how we work with promises, class inheritence and etc.\n5. To keep the process simple with just a few contributors, development happens directly on the master branch\n   and releases will be deployed on the same branch.\n6. By creating a Pull Request, you agree to all terms in https://github.com/caprover/caprover/blob/master/contrib.md\n\n### Running backend dev environment\n\nFirst, you need a Captain instance running in debug mode, this can be a remote server, a VM on your local machine,\nor your local machine itself. Needless to say, Docker is required (same minimum version as mentioned in README). Ubuntu is the best dev environment for CapRover.\n\nLog in to your machine, clone the git repo and run the following lines:\n\n#### On Linux and Windows\n\n```bash\n$   npm install\n$   npm run build\n$   sudo ./dev-scripts/dev-clean-run-as-dev.sh\n```\n\nYou are good to go! You can run the following line to see the logs for the back-end service.\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n#### On macOs\n\n##### Prepare your system (for Catalina and above)\n\nBecause of security restriction we have more step to apply on macOs.\nCreate a folder wherever you want (for me it will be /opt/captain).\nLink this folder to the root folder (Apple does not allow to create folder on the root but you can do it with a symb link by adding the file in `/etc/synthetic.conf` [see](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396821/what-is-the-proper-way-to-create-a-root-sym-link-in-catalina))\n(don't panic id the file does not exist, if you create it will work well.)\n\n1. `sudo vi /etc/synthetic.conf`\n2. add `captain opt/captain` into this file (note this is a tab and not a space ((Ctrl-V + Tab) character))\n3. reboot\n4. Prepare your docker system\n\n##### Prepare your docker (for all macOs User)\n\n> You need to add `/captain` to shared paths.  \n> To do so, click on the Docker icon -> Preferences -> Ressources -> File Sharing and add `/captain`\n\n#####\n\nuse node 18 then\n\n```bash\n$   npm install\n$   npm run build\n$   sudo ./dev-scripts/dev-clean-run-as-dev-macos-step-1.sh\n$   ./dev-scripts/dev-clean-run-as-dev-macos-step-2.sh\n```\n\nThe main differences between the release and debug mode are:\n\n-   docker image is created from the local source file, instead of getting pulled from Docker hub\n-   security is much weaker is debug due to a static salt\n-   self health monitoring is disabled in debug so that we can see possible crashes\n-   same origin policy is disabled in debug mode to make front end development easier\n-   an additional endpoint is available at `/force-exit` which force restarts the backend service\n-   static resources (including front end app) are not being served in debug build.\n\nCaptain by default uses `captain.localhost` as its root domain. It's not always needed, but if you need a root\ndomain for your development, you can simply run a local DNS server on your local machine and point\n`*.captain.localhost` (wild card domain) to your local IP. A simple `hosts` change won't be useful as we need a wildcard entry.\n\nOn ubuntu 16, it's as simple of editing this file:\n`/etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/dnsmasq-localhost.conf` (create if does not exist)\nAnd add this line to it: `address=/captain.localhost/192.168.1.2` where `192.168.1.2` is your local IP address.\nTo make sure you have dnsmasq, you can run `which dnsmasq` on your terminal, if it's available,\npath of it will be printed on the terminal, otherwise, there won't be anything printed on your terminal.\n\nTo test the API, you can import the Postman collection JSON in `./dev-scripts` directory.\n\n### front end development:\n\nSee https://github.com/caprover/caprover-frontend\n\n### CLI development:\n\nSee https://github.com/caprover/caprover-cli\n\n### Backend development:\n\nStart the debug build for the backend service as explained above. To see any changes you make,\nfirst save the changes, then you need to restart the service either by sending a request to `/force-exit` endpoint,\nor by running `npm run dev`.\n\n### Security Issues\n\nSecurity issues are high priority and they will be addressed immediately. If you find a security issue, please do not post as a public issue, instead, please email it to us: security at caprover dot com.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\n### Our Pledge\n\nIn the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as\ncontributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and\nour community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body\nsize, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,\nnationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and\norientation.\n\n### Our Standards\n\nExamples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment\ninclude:\n\n-   Using welcoming and inclusive language\n-   Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences\n-   Gracefully accepting constructive criticism\n-   Focusing on what is best for the community\n-   Showing empathy towards other community members\n\nExamples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:\n\n-   The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or\n    advances\n-   Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks\n-   Public or private harassment\n-   Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic\n    address, without explicit permission\n-   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a\n    professional setting\n\n### Our Responsibilities\n\nProject maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable\nbehavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in\nresponse to any instances of unacceptable behavior.\n\nProject maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or\nreject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions\nthat are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or\npermanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,\nthreatening, offensive, or harmful.\n\n### Scope\n\nThis Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces\nwhen an individual is representing the project or its community.

Remove CapRover and your apps keep working!\n\n✔ Docker Swarm under the hood for containerization and clustering\n\n✔ Nginx (fully customizable template) under the hood for load-balancing\n\n✔ Let's Encrypt under the hood for free SSL (HTTPS)\n\n### Seriously! Who should care about CapRover?\n\n-   A [web] developer who does not like spending hours and days setting up a server, build tools, sending code to server, build it, get an SSL certificate, install it, update nginx over and over again.\n-   A developer who uses expensive services like Heroku, Microsoft Azure and etc. And is interested in reducing their cost by 50x (Heroku charges 250USD/month for their 2gb instance, the same server is 5$ on Hetzner!!)\n-   Someone who prefers to write more of `showResults(getUserList())` and not much of `$ apt-get install libstdc++6 > /dev/null`\n-   A developer who likes installing MariaDB, MySQL, MongoDB and etc on their server by selecting from a dropdown and clicking on install!\n-   How much server/docker/linux knowledge is required to set up a CapRover server? Answer: Knowledge of Copy & Paste!! Head over to \"Getting Started\" for information on what to copy & paste ;-)\n\n## Learn More!\n\nFor more details and documentation, please visit https://CapRover.com/\n\n## Contributors\n\nCapRover exists thanks to all the great people who have contributed to this project.

          "content": "# Terms & Conditions\n\n_In future versions, this will be added to the installation_\n\nCapRover core is a free and source-available program developed collectively by tens of developers across the world. Use CapRover at your own risk.\n\nDevelopers of CapRover do their best to prevent bugs and issues through rigorous testing processes and clean code principles. CapRover is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and limitations under the [License](https://github.com/caprover/caprover/blob/master/LICENSE).\n\nBy using CapRover you agree to Terms and Conditions, and the license of CapRover.\n\n### Description of Service:\n\nCapRover core is an open source program and in no way it should be considered a service. It is a free program that you can optionally install on your machine. You are more than welcome to read and understand every bit of this open source program.\n\nCapRover Pro is additional functionality that is provided on top of CapRover core. It is an optional service.\n\n### Our Responsibility\n\nCapRover developers will do their best to ensure that CapRover remains functional and major bugs are resolved quickly. If you have a feature request, you are more than welcome to open a request for it, but the ultimate decision whether or not the feature will be added is taken by CapRover's core developers. Since they will be the ones who have to maintain the feature moving forward. Take a moment and familiarize yourself with our [scope and goals](https://github.com/caprover/caprover/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#important-caprover-goals--scope)\n\n### Analytics\n\nCapRover has built in anonymous usage analytics starting v1.11. CapRover **never** sends any private data, such as env vars, private images, etc. This anonymous information is only used to understand usage patterns of CapRover and optimize the experience for the users. For example, in the future, we will have the possibility to add download counts to one click apps. If you wish to disable anonymous analytics, you can do so by passing an env variable CAPROVER_DISABLE_ANALYTICS=true to CapRover service. You can add this to the installation line, or use `docker service update --env-add CAPROVER_DISABLE_ANALYTICS=true captain-captain` for an existing service. In the future, we will use this information to find out which one click apps are popular, whether or not we should focus on supporting multiple nodes (percentage of single node vs multi node), whether or not we should invest in supporting multi CPU clusters, and etc. Here is [the link](https://github.com/caprover/caprover/blob/master/src/user/events/emitter/AnalyticsLogger.ts#L22-L25) to all analytics events that CapRover collects.\n\n### Future changes\n\nTerms of Service / Terms & Conditions may change at any point without a prior notice.\n"
