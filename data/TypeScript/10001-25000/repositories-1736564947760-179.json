          "content": "## Can I create a pull request for Dockge?\n\nYes or no, it depends on what you will try to do. Since I don't want to waste your time, be sure to **create open a discussion, so we can have a discussion first**. Especially for a large pull request or you don't know if it will be merged or not.\n\nHere are some references:\n\n### ✅ Usually accepted:\n- Bug fix\n- Security fix\n- Adding new language files (see [these instructions](https://github.com/louislam/dockge/blob/master/frontend/src/lang/README.md))\n- Adding new language keys: `$t(\"...\")`\n\n### ⚠️ Discussion required:\n- Large pull requests\n- New features\n\n### ❌ Won't be merged:\n- A dedicated PR for translating existing languages (see [these instructions](https://github.com/louislam/dockge/blob/master/frontend/src/lang/README.md))\n- Do not pass the auto-test\n- Any breaking changes\n- Duplicated pull requests\n- Buggy\n- UI/UX is not close to Dockge\n- Modifications or deletions of existing logic without a valid reason.\n- Adding functions that is completely out of scope\n- Converting existing code into other programming languages\n- Unnecessarily large code changes that are hard to review and cause conflicts with other PRs.\n\nThe above cases may not cover all possible situations.\n\nI (@louislam) have the final say. If your pull request does not meet my expectations, I will reject it, no matter how much time you spend on it. Therefore, it is essential to have a discussion beforehand.\n\nI will assign your pull request to a [milestone](https://github.com/louislam/dockge/milestones), if I plan to review and merge it.\n\nAlso, please don't rush or ask for an ETA, because I have to understand the pull request, make sure it is no breaking changes and stick to my vision of this project, especially for large pull requests.\n\n## Project Styles\n\nI personally do not like something that requires so many configurations before you can finally start the app.\n\n- Settings should be configurable in the frontend. Environment variables are discouraged, unless it is related to startup such as `DOCKGE_STACKS_DIR`\n- Easy to use\n- The web UI styling should be consistent and nice\n- No native build dependency\n\n## Coding Styles\n\n- 4 spaces indentation\n- Follow `.editorconfig`\n- Follow ESLint\n- Methods and functions should be documented with JSDoc\n\n## Name Conventions\n\n- Javascript/Typescript: camelCaseType\n- SQLite: snake_case (Underscore)\n- CSS/SCSS: kebab-case (Dash)\n\n## Tools\n\n- [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/) >= 20\n- [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/)\n- [`git`](https://git-scm.com/)\n- IDE that supports [`ESLint`](https://eslint.org/) and EditorConfig (I am using [`IntelliJ IDEA`](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/))\n- A SQLite GUI tool (f.ex. [`SQLite Expert Personal`](https://www.sqliteexpert.com/download.html) or [`DBeaver Community`](https://dbeaver.io/download/))\n\n## Install Dependencies for Development\n\n```bash\npnpm install\n```\n\n## Dev Server\n\n```\npnpm run dev:frontend\npnpm run dev:backend\n```\n\n## Backend Dev Server\n\nIt binds to `0.0.0.0:5001` by default.\n\nIt is mainly a socket.io app + express.js.\n\n## Frontend Dev Server\n\nIt binds to `0.0.0.0:5000` by default. The frontend dev server is used for development only.\n\nFor production, it is not used. It will be compiled to `frontend-dist` directory instead.\n\nYou can use Vue.js devtools Chrome extension for debugging.\n\n### Build the frontend\n\n```bash\npnpm run build\n```\n\n## Database Migration\n\nTODO\n\n## Dependencies\n\nBoth frontend and backend share the same package.json. However, the frontend dependencies are eventually not used in the production environment, because it is usually also baked into dist files. So:\n\n- Frontend dependencies = \"devDependencies\"\n    - Examples: vue, chart.js\n- Backend dependencies = \"dependencies\"\n    - Examples: socket.io, sqlite3\n- Development dependencies = \"devDependencies\"\n    - Examples: eslint, sass\n\n### Update Dependencies\n\nShould only be done by the maintainer.\n\n```bash\npnpm update\n````\n\nIt should update the patch release version only.\n\nPatch release = the third digit ([Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/))\n\nIf for security / bug / other reasons, a library must be updated, breaking changes need to be checked by the person proposing the change.\n\n## Translations\n\nPlease add **all** the strings which are translatable to `src/lang/en.json` (If translation keys are omitted, they can not be translated).\n\n**Don't include any other languages in your initial Pull-Request** (even if this is your mother tongue), to avoid merge-conflicts between weblate and `master`.  \nThe translations can then (after merging a PR into `master`) be translated by awesome people donating their language skills.\n\nIf you want to help by translating Uptime Kuma into your language, please visit the [instructions on how to translate using weblate](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma/blob/master/src/lang/README.md).\n\n## Spelling & Grammar\n\nFeel free to correct the grammar in the documentation or code.\nMy mother language is not English and my grammar is not that great.\n"

For example, sometimes when I try to deploy a stack, the loading icon keeps spinning for a few minutes without progress. And sometimes error messages are not clear.\n- Try to develop with ES Module + TypeScript (Originally, I planned to use Deno or Bun.js, but they don't have support for arm64, so I stepped back to Node.js)\n\nIf you love this project, please consider giving it a ⭐.\n\n\n## 🗣️ Community and Contribution\n\n### Bug Report\nhttps://github.com/louislam/dockge/issues\n\n### Ask for Help / Discussions\nhttps://github.com/louislam/dockge/discussions\n\n### Translation\nIf you want to translate Dockge into your language, please read [Translation Guide](https://github.com/louislam/dockge/blob/master/frontend/src/lang/README.md)\n\n### Create a Pull Request\n\nBe sure to read the [guide](https://github.com/louislam/dockge/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), as we don't accept all types of pull requests and don't want to waste your time.\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### \"Dockge\"?\n\n\"Dockge\" is a coinage word which is created by myself. I originally hoped it sounds like `Dodge`, but apparently many people called it `Dockage`, it is also acceptable.\n\nThe naming idea came from Twitch emotes like `sadge`, `bedge` or `wokege`. They all end in `-ge`.\n\n#### Can I manage a single container without `compose.yaml`?\n\nThe main objective of Dockge is to try to use the docker `compose.yaml` for everything. If you want to manage a single container, you can just use Portainer or Docker CLI.\n\n#### Can I manage existing stacks?\n\nYes, you can. However, you need to move your compose file into the stacks directory:\n\n1. Stop your stack\n2. Move your compose file into `/opt/stacks/<stackName>/compose.yaml`\n3. In Dockge, click the \" Scan Stacks Folder\" button in the top-right corner's dropdown menu\n4. Now you should see your stack in the list\n\n#### Is Dockge a Portainer replacement?\n\nYes or no. Portainer provides a lot of Docker features. While Dockge is currently only focusing on docker-compose with a better user interface and better user experience.\n\nIf you want to manage your container with docker-compose only, the answer may be yes.\n\nIf you still need to manage something like docker networks, single containers, the answer may be no.\n\n#### Can I install both Dockge and Portainer?\n\nYes, you can.\n\n## Others\n\nDockge is built on top of [Compose V2](https://docs.docker.com/compose/migrate/). `compose.yaml`  also known as `docker-compose.yml`.\n"
