          "content": "# Contributing\n\nWe would ❤️ it if you contributed to the project and helped make Amplication even better. We will make sure that contributing to Amplication is easy, enjoyable, and educational for anyone and everyone. All contributions are welcome, including features, issues, documentation, guides, and more.\n\n## Got a question?\n\nYou can ask questions, consult with more experienced Amplication users, and discuss Amplication-related topics in the our [Discord channel](https://amplication.com/discord).\n\n## Found a bug?\n\nIf you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/amplication/amplication/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A%20bug&template=bug_report.md&title=) to our GitHub Repository. Even better, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix.\n\n## Missing a feature?\n\nYou can request a new feature by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/amplication/amplication/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A%20feature%20request&template=feature_request.md&title=) to our GitHub Repository.\n\nIf you'd like to implement a new feature, it's always good to be in touch with us before you invest time and effort, since not all features can be supported.\n\n- For a Major Feature, first open an issue and outline your proposal. This will let us coordinate efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you craft the change so that it's successfully integrated into the project.\n- Small Features can be crafted and directly [submitted as a Pull Request](#submit-pr).\n\n## What do you need to know to help?\n\nIf you want to help out with a code contribution, our project uses the following stack:\n\n### Server-side\n\n- [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/)\n- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs)\n- [NestJS](https://docs.nestjs.com/)\n- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/docs/) (with [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/about/))\n- [GraphQL API](https://docs.nestjs.com/graphql/quick-start)\n- [Jest](https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/testing) (for testing)\n\n### Client-side\n\n- [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)\n- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs)\n- [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/)\n\nIf you don't feel ready to make a code contribution yet, no problem! You can also check out the [documentation issues](https://github.com/amplication/amplication/labels/type%3A%20docs).\n\n# <a name=\"submit-pr\"></a> How do I make a code contribution?\n\n## Open to community\n\nYou can check all the issues that are open for community contributions. Check [here](https://github.com/amplication/amplication/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22open+to+community%22).\n\n## Good first issues\n\nAre you new to open source contribution? Wondering how contributions work in our project? Here's a quick rundown.\n\nFind an issue that you're interested in addressing, or a feature that you'd like to add.\nYou can use [this view](https://github.com/amplication/amplication/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) which helps new contributors find easy gateways into our project.\n\n## Step 1: Make a fork\n\nFork the Amplication repository to your GitHub organization. This means that you'll have a copy of the repository under _your-GitHub-username/repository-name_.\n\n> :accessibility: Un-check \"Copy the DEFAULT branch only\"\n\n## Step 2: Clone the repository to your local machine\n\n```sh\ngit clone -b next https://github.com/{your-GitHub-username}/amplication.git\n\n```\n\n## Step 3: Prepare the development environment\n\nSet up and run the development environment on your local machine following the [README](./README.md#Development)\n\n## Step 4: Create a branch\nCreate a new branch for your changes.\nIn order to keep branch names uniform and easy-to-understand, please use the following conventions for branch naming.\nGenerally speaking, it is a good idea to add a group/type prefix to a branch.\nHere is a list of good examples:\n- for docs change : `docs/{ISSUE_NUMBER}-{CUSTOM_NAME}` for e.g. docs/2233-update-contributing-docs\n- for new features : `feat/{ISSUE_NUMBER}-{CUSTOM_NAME}` for e.g. feat/1144-add-plugins\n- for bug fixes : `fix/{ISSUE_NUMBER}-{CUSTOM_NAME}` for e.g. fix/9878-fix-invite-wrong-url\n- for anything else: `chore/{ISSUE_NUMBER}-{CUSTOM_NAME}` for e.g. chore/111-update-ci-url\n\n```sh\ngit checkout -b branch-name-here\n```\n\n## Step 5: Make your changes\n\nUpdate the code with your bug fix or new feature.\n\n## Step 6: Add the changes that are ready to be committed\n\nStage the changes that are ready to be committed:\n\n```sh\ngit add .\n```\n\n## Step 7: Commit the changes (Git)\n\nCommit the changes with a short message. (See below for more details on how we structure our commit messages)\n\n```sh\ngit commit -m \"<type>(<package>): <subject>\"\n```\n\n## Step 8: Push the changes to the remote repository\n\nPush the changes to the remote repository using:\n\n```sh\ngit push origin branch-name-here\n```\n\n## Step 9: Create Pull Request\n\nIn GitHub, do the following to submit a pull request to the upstream repository:\n\n1.  Give the pull request a title and a short description of the changes made following the template. Include also the issue or bug number associated with your change. Explain the changes that you made, any issues you think exist with the pull request you made, and any questions you have for the maintainer.  <br/> ⚠️ **Make sure your pull request target the `next` branch.**\n \n  > Pull request title should be in the form of `<type>(<package>): <subject>` as per commit messages.\nRemember, it's okay if your pull request is not perfect (no pull request ever is). The reviewer will be able to help you fix any problems and improve it!\n\n2.  Wait for the pull request to be reviewed by a maintainer.\n\n3.  Make changes to the pull request if the reviewing maintainer recommends them.\n\nCelebrate your success after your pull request is merged :-)\n\n## Git Commit Messages\n\nWe structure our commit messages like this:\n\n```\n<type>(<package>): <subject>\n```\n\nExample\n\n```\nfix(server): missing entity on init\n```\n\n### Types:\n\n- **feat**: A new feature\n- **fix**: A bug fix\n- **docs**: Changes to the documentation\n- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)\n- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature\n- **perf**: A code change that improves performance\n- **test**: Adding missing or correcting existing tests\n- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation\n\n### Packages:\n\n- **server**\n- **client**\n- **data-service-gen**\n\n## Code of conduct\n\nPlease note that this project is released with a Contributor Code of Conduct. By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.\n\n[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/amplication/amplication/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n\nOur Code of Conduct means that you are responsible for treating everyone on the project with respect and courtesy.\n"

You can get started immediately at [app.amplication.com](https://app.amplication.com). After the login page, you will be guided through creating your first service. The [website](https://amplication.com) provides an overview of the application, additional information on the product and guides can be found in the [docs](https://docs.amplication.com).\n\n<details>\n<summary>\n  Tutorials\n</summary> <br />\n\n- [To-do application using Amplication and Angular](https://docs.amplication.com/tutorials/angular-todos)\n- [To-do application using Amplication and React](https://docs.amplication.com/tutorials/react-todos)\n</details>\n\n## Development\n\nAlternatively, instead of using the hosted version of the product, Amplication can be run locally for code generation purposes or contributions - if so, please refer to our [contributing](#contributing_anchor) section.\n\n<details open>\n<summary>\nPre-requisites\n</summary> <br />\nTo be able to start development on Amplication, make sure that you have the following prerequisites installed:\n\n###\n\n- Node.js\n- Docker\n- Git\n</details>\n\n<details open>\n<summary>\nRunning Amplication\n</summary> <br />\n\n> **Note**\n> It is also possible to start development with GitHub Codespaces, when navigating to `< > Code`, select `Codespaces` instead of `Local`. Click on either the `+`-sign or the `Create codespace on master`-button.\n\nAmplication is using a monorepo architecture - powered by <a href=\"https://nx.dev\">Nx Workspaces</a> - where multiple applications and libraries exist in a single repository. To setup a local development environment the following steps can be followed:\n\n**BEFORE** you run the following steps make sure:\n1. You have typescript installed locally on you machine ```npm install -g typescript```\n2. You are using a supported node version (check `engines` `node` in the [package.json](./package.json))\n3. You are using a supported npm version (check `engines` `npm` in the [package.json](./package.json))\n4. You have `docker` installed and running on your machine\n\n\n1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/amplication/amplication.git && cd amplication && npm install\n```\n\n2. Run the setup script, which takes care of installing dependencies, building packages, and setting up the workspace:\n```shell\nnpm run setup:dev\n```\n\n3. Option 1: Running the required infrastructure - view infrastructure component logs\n\n\n```shell\nnpm run docker:dev\n```\n3. Option 2: Running the required infrastructure - run the infrastructure components in background\n```shell\nnpm run docker:dev -- -d\n```\n\n4. Apply database migrations\n```shell\nnpm run db:migrate:deploy\n```\n\n5. To start developing, run one or more of the applications available under `serve:[application]` scripts of the package.json.\n\n```shell\n# running the server component\nnpm run serve:server\n\n# running the client component\nnpm run serve:client\n\n# running the data-service-generator component\nnpm run serve:dsg\n\n# running the git-sync-manager component\nnpm run serve:git\n\n# running the plugin-api component\nnpm run serve:plugins\n```\n\n> **Note**\n> In order to run the Amplication client properly, both the client and server need to be started by the `npm run serve:[application]` command, as well as an additional component for development on a specific component.\n\nThe development environment should now be set up. Additional information on the different application components can be found under packages/`[application]`/README.md file. Happy hacking! 👾\n</details>\n\n## Resources\n\n- **[Website](https://amplication.com)** overview of the product.\n- **[Docs](https://docs.amplication.com)** for comprehensive documentation.\n- **[Blog](https://amplication.com/blog)** for guides and technical comparisons.\n- **[Discord](https://amplication.com/discord)** for support and discussions with the community and the team.\n- **[GitHub](https://github.com/amplication/amplication)** for source code, project board, issues, and pull requests.\n- **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/amplication)** for the latest updates on the product and published blogs.\n- **[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/Amplicationcom)** for guides and technical talks.\n\n<a name=\"contributing_anchor\"></a>\n## Contributing\n\nThe majority of Amplication code is open-source.
