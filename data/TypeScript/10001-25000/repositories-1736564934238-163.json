          "content": "# Contributing to Wasp\n\nWasp's compiler is built with Haskell and under the hood it generates a web application in React and NodeJS. Given that, there are several ways in which you can contribute: \n- [Wasp compiler/CLI/LSP internals](#wasp-compilerclilsp-internals) (Haskell)\n- [Wasp as a web framework](#wasp-as-a-web-framework) (React, Node, HTML/CSS, database and so on)\n- [Tutorials or Example apps](#tutorials-or-example-apps)\n- [Documentation](#documentation)\n\n## Before you begin \n\n- Check out the [**Getting Started**](https://wasp-lang.dev/docs) guide to get familiar with Wasp's fundamentals. Ideally, you'd also build an app from the [**Pick a Tutorial**](https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/tutorials/todo-app) page to really get a feel for it!\n- Figure out what you'd like to help with. It can be code, documentation, tutorials, etc. More on this is below.\n- Join our Discord [![**Discord**](https://img.shields.io/discord/686873244791210014?label=chat%20on%20discord)](https://discord.gg/rzdnErX) for faster communication and feedback. We'd be happy to help you find the issue you'll enjoy working on, depending on your interests and skill set!\n- Below you can find links to the good first issues. If you'd like to filter the issues on your own — please, use [this link](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/issues)\n\nLet's jump right in!\n\n## Wasp compiler/CLI/LSP internals\n\nWasp compiler is implemented in Haskell, but you will also see a lot of Javascript and other web technologies because Wasp compiles it's own code into them.\n\nWhile you will need to know some Haskell, you don't have to be an expert in Haskell to contribute or understand the code since we don't use complicated Haskell features much -> most of the code is relatively straightforward, and we are happy to help with the part that is not.\n\nCheck the [**Wasp compiler README**](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/blob/main/waspc/README.md) for all the detailed instructions and guides.\n\n[**Haskell-related issues for beginners can be found here.**](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+label%3Ahaskell) \n\nFeel free to contact us via Discord to ask for an appropriate issue for yourself, or just open a new one if you have something specific in mind and it isn't already there!\n\n## Wasp as a web framework\n\nWasp is a language for developing full-stack web apps. This means there are plenty of tasks related to web development itself. \n\n[**Web dev issues for beginners can be found here.**](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+label%3Awebdev)\n\n## Tutorials or Example apps\n\nAnother great way to help is to create an app with Wasp! We have an [Examples](https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/examples) section on our website, as well as the [Tutorials](https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/tutorials/todo-app) page. Both of them can be improved and updated with your projects. \n\nAll that's required is to create an app. And make a tutorial or a blog post to help other people reproduce your work. Some prominent examples are: [Waspello](https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2021/12/02/waspello), [Waspleau](https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2022/01/27/waspleau), [It Wasps on My Machine](https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2022/09/05/dev-excuses-app-tutrial) and [To-Do app](https://wasp-lang.dev/docs/tutorials/todo-app).\n\nOr you can re-build your existing pet project with Wasp. That would be cool!\n\n## Documentation & Blog\n\nIt may sound like the simplest one, but it's super valuable! If you've found an issue, a broken link or if something was unclear on our [website](https://wasp-lang.dev/) - please, feel free to fix it :)\n\nPlease make sure to **base your feature branches and PRs on the `release` branch** instead of `main`, since that's the one that is deployed to the website.\n\n[**Documentation issues for beginners can be found here.**](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+label%3Adocumentation)\n\nIf you'd like to write a blog post about Wasp, please contact us via [Discord](https://discord.gg/zKFDFrsHa9) to discuss the topic and the details.\n\nHappy hacking!"

That means less code to maintain and understand! It also means easier upgrades.\n- 🔓 **No lock-in**: You can deploy the Wasp app anywhere you like. There is no lock-in into specific providers; you have full control over the code (and can actually check it out in .wasp/ dir if you are interested ).\n\n### Features\n\n🔒 Full-stack Auth, 🖇️ RPC (Client <-> Server), 🚀 Simple Deployment, ⚙ ️Jobs, ✉️ Email Sending, 🛟 Full-stack Type Safety, ...\n\n### Code example\n\nSimple Wasp config file in which you describe the high-level details of your web app:\n\n```js\n// file: main.wasp\n\napp todoApp {\n  title: \"ToDo App\",  // visible in the browser tab\n  wasp: { version: \"^0.15.0\" },\n  auth: { // full-stack auth out-of-the-box\n    userEntity: User, methods: { email: {...} }\n  }\n}\n\nroute RootRoute { path: \"/\", to: MainPage }\npage MainPage {\n  authRequired: true, // Limit access to logged-in users.\n  component: import Main from \"@client/Main.tsx\" // Your React code.\n}\n\nquery getTasks {\n  fn: import { getTasks } from \"@server/tasks.js\", // Your Node.js code.\n  entities: [Task] // Automatic cache invalidation.\n}\n\n// file: schema.prisma\n\nmodel Task { // Your Prisma data model.\n  id          Int     @id @default(autoincrement())\n  description String\n  isDone      Boolean @default(false)\n}\n```\n\nThe rest of the code you write in React / Node.js / Prisma and just reference it from the .wasp file.\n\n:arrow_forward: Check out [TodoApp example](/examples/tutorials/TodoApp) for the complete code example. :arrow_backward:\n\n### How it works\n\n<img width=\"800px\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1536647/231472285-126679e5-ecce-4cbb-8579-eb3cd9ba95bf.png\"/>\n\nGiven a simple .wasp configuration file that describes the high-level details of your web app, and .js(x)/.css/..., source files with your unique logic, Wasp compiler generates the full source of your web app in the target stack: front-end, back-end and deployment.\n\nThis unique approach is what makes Wasp \"smart\" and gives it its superpowers!\n\nFor more information about Wasp, check [**docs**](https://wasp-lang.dev/docs).\n\n# Get started\n\nRun\n\n```\ncurl -sSL https://get.wasp-lang.dev/installer.sh | sh\n```\n\nto install Wasp on OSX/Linux/WSL(Win). From there, just follow the instructions to run your first app in less than a minute!\n\nFor more details, check out [the docs](https://wasp-lang.dev/docs).\n\n# Wasp AI / Mage\n\nWasp comes with experimental AI code generator to help you kickstart your next Wasp project -> you can use it via `wasp new` in the CLI (choose \"AI\" option) if you can provide your OpenAI keys or you can do it via our [Mage web app](https://usemage.ai) in which case our OpenAI keys are used in the background.\n\n# This repository\n\nThis is the main repo of the Wasp universe, containing core code (mostly `waspc` - Wasp compiler) and the supporting materials.\n\n# Project status\n\nCurrently, Wasp is in beta, with most features fleshed out and working well.\nHowever, there are still a lot of improvements and additions that we have in mind for the future, and we are working on them constantly, so you can expect a lot of changes and improvements in the future.\n\nWhile the idea is to support multiple web tech stacks in the future, right now, we are focusing on the specific stack: React + react-query, NodeJS + ExpressJS, and Prisma.\n\n# Contributing\n\nAny way you want to contribute is a good way :)!\n\nThe best place to start is to check out [waspc/](waspc/), where you can find detailed steps for first-time contributors + technical details about the Wasp compiler.\n\nThe core of Wasp is built in Haskell, but there are also a lot of non-Haskell parts of Wasp, so you will certainly be able to find something for you!\n\nEven if you don't plan to submit any code, just joining the discussion on discord [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/686873244791210014?label=chat%20on%20discord)](https://discord.gg/rzdnErX) and giving your feedback is already great and helps a lot (motivates us and helps us figure out how to shape Wasp)!\n\nYou can also:\n\n- :star: Star this repo to show your interest/support.\n- :mailbox: Stay updated by subscribing to our [email list](https://wasp-lang.dev#signup).\n- :speech_balloon: Join the discussion at https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/discussions .\n\n# Careers\n\nCheck our [careers](https://wasp-lang.notion.site/Wasp-Careers-59fd1682c80d446f92be5fa65cc17672) page for a list of currently opened positions!\n\n# Sponsors\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/michelwaechter\"><img src=\"https://github.com/michelwaechter.png\" width=\"50px\" alt=\"michelwaechter\" /></a> - Our first sponsor ever!
