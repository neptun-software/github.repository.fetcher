          "content": "# Contributing to FingerprintJS\n\nThanks for taking the time to contribute!\nHere you can find ways to make FingerprintJS better, as well as tips and guidelines.\n\nThis project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Code of Conduct](code_of_conduct.md).\nBy participating, you are expected to uphold this code.\n\n## How you can contribute\n\n### Reporting an issue\n\nIf you've noticed a bug, have an idea or a question,\nfeel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/issues/new/choose) or [start a discussion](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/discussions/new/choose).\n\nBefore you start, please [search](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Afingerprintjs%2Ffingerprintjs&type=code) for your topic.\nThere is a chance it has already been discussed.\n\nWhen you create an issue, the description is pre-filled with a template text.\nPlease fill in the missing information carefully, it will help us solve your issue faster.\nIf you want to share a piece of code or the library output with us, please wrap it in a ` ``` ` block and make sure you include all the information.\n\n### Creating a pull request\n\nIf you want to fix a bug, add a source of entropy, or make any other code contribution, please [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project).\n\nAfter you clone the repository, check the [Working with code](#working-with-code) section to learn how to run, check, and build the code.\n\nIn order for us to review and accept your code contributions, please follow these rules:\n- Your code quality should be at least as good as the code you modify.\n- Your code style (syntax, naming, coding patterns, etc) should follow the FingerprintJS style.\n- All the new code should be covered with automated tests.\n- All the checks described in the [Working with code](#working-with-code) section must pass successfully.\n    You may create a draft pull request in this repository to run the checks automatically by GitHub Actions,\n    but the tests won't run on BrowserStack until a FingerprintJS maintainer approves them.\n- Follow the recommendations provided in the [Pitfalls](#pitfalls) section.\n- If you want to add an entropy source (component), follow the [How to add an entropy source](#how-to-add-an-entropy-source) instructions carefully.\n- The changes should be backward compatible, ensuring FingerprintJS users continue to use the library without any modifications.\n- Don't add dependencies (such as Node packages) unless necessary.\n- Don't make changes unrelated to the stated purpose of your pull request. Please strive to introduce as few changes as possible.\n- Don't change FingerprintJS code style, its TypeScript configuration, or other subjective things.\n\nIf you want to do something more complex than fixing a small bug, or if you're not sure if your changes meet the project requirements, please [start a discussion](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/discussions/new/choose).\nWe encourage starting a discussion if you want to propose changing a rule from this guide.\nDoing so ensures we discuss all opinions, creating a good contribution experience for everyone.\n\n### Helping with existing issues\n\nIf you want to help, but don't know where to start, take a look at the [\"help wanted\" issues](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/labels/help%20wanted).\nYou can help by sharing knowledge or creating a pull request.\nFeel free to ask questions in the issues if you need more details.\n\n## Working with code\n\nThis section describes how to deploy the repository locally, make changes to the code, and verify your work.\n\nFirst, make sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) installed.\nThen clone the repository and install the dependencies:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs.git\ncd fingerprintjs\nyarn install\n```\n\n### Development playground\n\nDevelopment playground lets you run FingerprintJS locally. Run this command to start a playground:\n\n```bash\nyarn playground:start # Add '--port 8765' to change the server port\n```\n\nThen open http://localhost:8080 in a browser.\nFingerprintJS will execute immediately and print the result on the page.\nThe page reloads every time you change the source code.\nThe code of the playground itself is located in the [playground](playground) directory.\n\nIf you want to open the playground on a device outside your local network, use a tool like [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com).\n\nTo build the playground distribution code (e.g. to upload it to a web server), run:\n\n```bash\nyarn playground:build\n```\n\nThe static webpage files will be saved to the `playground/dist` directory.\n\n### Code style\n\nFollow the repository's code style.\nThe code style is controlled by [ESLint](https://eslint.org) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io).\nRun to check that the code style is ok:\n\n```bash\nyarn lint\n```\n\nYou aren't required to run the check manually, the CI will do it.\nRun to fix code style mistakes (not all mistakes can be fixed automatically):\n\n```bash\nyarn lint:fix\n```\n\n### How to build\n\nTo build the distribution files of FingerprintJS that can be used in a browser directly, run:\n\n```bash\nyarn build\n```\n\nThe files will be saved to the `dist` directory.\n\n### Pitfalls\n\nAvoid running expressions in the top level of the modules.\nIt will help to tree-shake the library better:\n\n```js\n// Ok. Will be removed if not used.\nfunction do() {\n  // Any expression inside a function is ok\n}\n\n// Ok. Will be removed if not used.\nconst var1 = { prop: 'foo' }\n\n// No! A function is called, the function call won't be removed.\nconst var2 = Object.keys(var1)\n\n// No! An object property is accessed, the expression won't be removed because the property may be a getter.\nconst var3 = var1.prop\n\n// No! Will be converted to `const var4 = {}; var4.bar = 'foo'`.\nconst var4 = { [Enum.Member]: 'foo' }\n```\n\nAvoid using `navigator.userAgent` or similar APIs, as they are frequently spoofed.\nInstead, for code that makes decisions based on browser name and version, use the functions available in [src/utils/browser.ts](src/utils/browser.ts).\nHowever, in tests, for greater reliability, use `navigator.userAgent` through the functions in [tests/utils/index.ts](tests/utils/index.ts).\n\nThe `include` parameter of `tsconfig.json` files may contain only the entry files and the `.d.ts` files.\n\nSome `interface`s are replaced with `type`s in the entropy sources to help to avoid\n[\"cannot be named\" errors](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/5711) in projects using FingerprintJS.\n\n### How to test\n\nThere are automatic tests.\nThey are run by [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io) in real browsers using [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).\nUnit test files are located right next to individual module files that they check.\nIntegration tests are located in the `tests` directory.\n\nTo run the tests in a browser on your machine, build the project and run:\n```bash\nyarn test:local --browsers ChromeHeadless\n# or to run in Firefox\nyarn test:local --browsers FirefoxHeadless\n# or to run in both\nyarn test:local\n```\n\nTo run the tests in browsers on [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com), get a BrowserStack access key and run:\n```bash\n# For Linux, macOS and WSL (Linux on Windows)\nBROWSERSTACK_USERNAME=your-username BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY=your-key yarn test:browserstack\n```\nIf you face `Error: spawn Unknown system error -86` on macOS, try installing Rosetta:\n```bash\nsoftwareupdate --install-rosetta\n```\n\nAlternatively, make a PR to this repository, the test will run on BrowserStack automatically.\nBut the test won't run when the PR is made from a fork repository, in this case, a member will run the tests manually.\n\nBrowserStack sessions are unstable, so a session can fail for no reason;\nrestart the testing when you see no clear errors related to the tests.\nIf you run the test command multiple times in parallel, BrowserStack will lose access to the Karma server\n(for some reason), which will cause the tests to hang infinitely, so try to run a single test command at once.\n\nTo check the distribution TypeScript declarations, build the project and run:\n\n```bash\nyarn check:dts\n```\n\nTo check that the package is compatible with server-side rendering, build the project and run:\n\n```bash\nyarn check:ssr\n```\n\n### How to add an entropy source\n\nAn entropy source is a function that gets a piece of data about the browser.\nThe value returned by an entropy source (also called an entropy component) is used to produce the visitor identifier.\nEntropy sources are located in the [src/sources](src/sources) directory.\nAll entropy components must be simple JavaScript values that can be encoded into JSON.\n\nEntropy sources must meet the following requirements:\n- It is stable — it always or almost always produces the same value in each browser, including incognito, guest, and desktop modes.\n- It is selective — it produces different values in different browsers, operating systems, or devices.\n    A good entropy source represents the browser, operating system, or device settings.\n- It produces no side effects, such as messages in the browser console, DOM changes, modal windows, notifications, and sounds.\n- It is fast. An entropy source should take no more than 1 second to complete.\n- It doesn't represent only the browser version. An example of such a signal is a JavaScript feature probing.\n    It's not a good entropy source because the return value is likely to change due to automatic browser updates,\n    the selectivity is low, and the same entropy can be achieved by just using the User-Agent string.\n\nEntropy sources run in 2 stages: \"load\" and \"get\":\n- \"Load\" runs once when the agent's `load` function is called.\n    It must do as much work on the source as possible to make the \"get\" phase as fast as possible.\n    It may start background processes that will run indefinitely or until the \"get\" phase runs.\n- \"Get\" runs once per each agent's `get` function call.\n    It must be as fast as possible.\n\nAn example entropy source:\n\n```js\n// The function below represents the \"load\" phase\nasync function entropySource() {\n  // The \"load\" phase starts here\n  const preData = await doLongAction()\n\n  // The \"load\" phase ends when the `entropySource` function returns\n  // The function below represents the \"get\" phase\n  return async () => {\n    // The \"get\" phase starts here\n    const finalData = await finalizeData(preData)\n    return finalData\n    // The \"get\" phase ends then this returned function returns\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAny of the phases can be synchronous:\n\n```js\nfunction entropySource() {\n  const preData = doLongSynchronousAction()\n\n  return () => {\n    const finalData = finalizeDataSynchronously(preData)\n    return finalData\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe \"get\" phase can be omitted:\n\n```js\nasync function entropySource() {\n  const finalData = await doLongAction()\n\n  // If the source's returned value is not a function, it's considered an entropy component\n  return finalData // Equivalent to: return () => finalData\n}\n```\n\nIn fact, most entropy sources don't require a \"get\" phase.\nThe \"get\" phase is required if the component can change after completing the load phase.\n\nIn order for the agent to measure the entropy source execution duration correctly,\nthe \"load\" phase shouldn't run in the background (after the source function returns).\nOn the other hand, in order not to block the whole agent, the \"load\" phase must contain only the necessary actions.\nExample:\n\n```js\nasync function entropySource() {\n  // Wait for the required data to be calculated during the \"load\" phase\n  let result = await doLongAction()\n\n  // Start watching optional data in the background (this function doesn't block the execution)\n  watchNextResults((newResult) => {\n    result = newResult\n  })\n\n  // Then complete the \"load\" phase by returning a function.\n  // `watchNextResults` will continue working until the \"get\" phase starts.\n  return () => {\n    return result\n  }\n}\n```\n\nEntropy sources must handle expected and only expected errors.\nThe expected errors must be turned into special entropy component values.\nPay attention to potential asynchronous errors.\nIf you handle unexpected errors, you won't know what's going wrong inside the entropy source.\nExample:\n\n```js\nasync function entropySource() {\n  try {\n    // `await` is necessary to catch asynchronous errors\n    return await doLongAction()\n  } catch (error) {\n    // WRONG:\n    return 'error'\n\n    // Correct:\n    if (error.message = 'Foo bar') {\n      return 'bot'\n    }\n    if (/boo/.test(error.message)) {\n      return 'ie'\n    }\n    throw error // Unexpected error\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhen you complete an entropy source, add it to [src/sources/index.ts](src/sources/index.ts).\n\nEvery entropy source needs to be covered with unit tests.\nThese tests are meant to verify that the entropy source returns expected values across all supported browsers.\nIn the event of significant changes or deprecation of underlying APIs, these tests should start to fail in future browser versions.\nAdditionally, if deemed necessary, it's recommended to include a test to ensure that the entropy source remains stable.\n\nFor inspiration see existing tests in [src/sources/](src/sources/).\n\n### How to publish\n\nSee the [publishing guide](docs/publishing.md) (for FingerprintJS maintainers only).\n"

Unlike cookies and local storage, a fingerprint stays the same in incognito/private mode and even when browser data is purged.\n\nFingerprintJS is available under a [BSL license](docs/licensing.md) for non-production purposes.\n\n_FingerprintJS is different from [Fingerprint Identification](https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/introduction#fingerprint-identification-vs-fingerprintjs), our more detailed and accurate commercial product. See below for [more information](#industry-leading-accuracy-with-fingerprint-identification)._\n\n## Demo\n\nVisit https://fingerprintjs.github.io/fingerprintjs to see your visitor identifier.\n\nNow, try visiting the same page in private / incognito mode and notice how the visitor identifier remains the **same**!\n\n## Getting Started\n\n```html\n<script>\n  // Initialize the agent at application startup.\n  // If you're using an ad blocker or Brave/Firefox, this import will not work.\n  // Please use the NPM package instead: https://t.ly/ORyXk\n  const fpPromise = import('https://openfpcdn.io/fingerprintjs/v4')\n    .then(FingerprintJS => FingerprintJS.load())\n\n  // Get the visitor identifier when you need it.\n  fpPromise\n    .then(fp => fp.get())\n    .then(result => {\n      // This is the visitor identifier:\n      const visitorId = result.visitorId\n      console.log(visitorId)\n    })\n</script>\n```\n\n[Run this code](https://stackblitz.com/edit/fpjs-4-cdn?file=index.html&devtoolsheight=100)\n\n### Resources\n\n📕 [API Reference](docs/api.md)\n\n⚛️ [Sample usage with React on the StackBlitz platform](https://stackblitz.com/edit/fingerprintjs-react-demo)\n\n🔑 [FingerprintJS Licensing](docs/licensing.md)\n\n## Limitations\n\n### Accuracy\n\nSince FingerprintJS processes and generates the fingerprints from within the browser itself, the accuracy is limited (40% - 60%). For example, when 2 different users send requests using identical (i.e. same version, same vendor, same platform), browsers, FingerprintJS will not be able to tell these two browsers apart, primarily because the attributes from these browsers will be identical.\n\n### Security\n\nBecause of how the fingerprints are processed and generated from within the browser itself, they are vulnerable to spoofing and reverse engineering.\n\n## Industry-leading accuracy with Fingerprint Identification\n\nThe main difference between FingerprintJS and [Fingerprint Identification](https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/introduction) lies in the number of attributes collected from the browser, how they are processed, and the accuracy in identifying visitors.\n\nFingerprint Identification is a **closed-source**, **commercial** device intelligence platform designed to prevent fraud and improve user experiences. It's an enhanced version of FingerprintJS and has been fully re-designed to solve the most challenging identification use cases. Its source is not available in this or any other public repository.\n\nUnlike FingerprintJS, Fingerprint Identification is able to achieve **industry-leading accuracy** because it processes the browser attributes on the server and also analyzes vast amounts of auxiliary data (e.g. IP addresses, time of visit patterns, URL changes, etc.). Because of these advanced matching techniques, Fingerprint Identification is able to reliably deduplicate different visitors that have identical devices.\n\nFingerprint Identification is available for Web, Android, iOS, and other platforms. You can easily get started by [signing up](https://dashboard.fingerprint.com/signup) for a free, unlimited 14-day trial.\n\nCheck out our [comparison table](docs/comparison.md) for a detailed breakdown of the differences between FingerprintJS and Fingerprint Identification.\n\n### Fingerprint Identification resources\n\n🍿 [Fingerprint Identification live demo](https://demo.fingerprint.com/playground)\n\n📕 [Fingerprint Identification documentation](https://dev.fingerprint.com)\n\n▶️ [Video: Use Fingerprint Identification to prevent multiple signups by same user](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWX9P5_jZn8)\n\n⏱️ [How to upgrade from FingerprintJS to Fingerprint Identification in 30 seconds](https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/migrating-from-fingerprintjs-to-fingerprint-pro#migrating-from-fingerprintjs-v4-source-available-to-pro)\n\n## Migrating to v4\n\n| Migrating from | Migration Guide | Documentation |\n|----------|-----------|-----------|\n| **v3** | [Migrating from v3 to v4](docs/migration/v3_v4.md) | [v3 documentation](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/tree/v3) |\n| **v2** | [Migrating from v2 to v4](docs/migration/v2_v4.md) | [v2 documentation](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/tree/v2) |\n| **v1** | [Migrating from v1 to v4](docs/migration/v1_v4.md) | [v1 documentation](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/tree/1.8.6) |\n\n## Version policy\n\nSee the compatibility policy for the API and visitor identifiers in the [version policy guide](docs/version_policy.md).\n\n## Supported browsers\n\nThe library supports all popular browsers. See more details and learn how to run the library in old browsers in the [browser support guide](docs/browser_support.md).\n\n## Where to get support\n\nUsing [Issues](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/issues) and [Discussions](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/discussions) publicly will help the community and other users with similar issues.\n\nYou can also join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ad6R2ttHVX) to ask questions, share feedback, and connect with other developers.\n\nIf you require private support for FingerprintJS, please email us at [oss-support@fingerprint.com](mailto:oss-support@fingerprint.com).\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee the [Contribution guidelines](contributing.md) to learn how to contribute to the project or run the project locally.\nPlease read it carefully before making a pull request.\n"
