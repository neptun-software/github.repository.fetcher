This release contains a host of improvements and bug fixes affecting Botkit's conversation system, as well the behavior\nof some of the platform adapters.  We recommend that all developers currently using Botkit v4 upgrade to 4.5. \n\nSpecific Changes: \n\n* NEW: It is now possible to create dynamic quick replies, and attachments within a BotkitConversation. [See full docs](https://botkit.ai/docs/v4/conversations.html#dynamic-quick-replies-and-attachments).\n* NEW: Previously, there was no way to bind middleware to the internally created Express webserver. It is now possible to do so using the `webserver_middlewares` parameter.  [Full docs](https://botkit.ai/docs/v4/reference/slack.html#interface-slackadapteroptions)\n* NEW: Quick replies and suggestedActions are now procssed as mustache templates. Thanks to [@InnoraG](https://github.com/innorag) for [the pull request](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/pull/1731).\n* NEW: Slack block actions and other button clicks now are message type events and get included in dialogs. Thanks to [@apemberton](https://github.com/apemberton) for the [pull request](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/pull/1712).\n* NEW: The key name passed in to convo.ask and convo.addQuestion can now be set to null in order to discard the answer. Thanks to [@adantoscano](https://github.com/adantoscano) for [the pull request](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/pull/1716)\n\n\n* FIX: Botkit will no longer improperly prune platform specific fields like quick replies and attachments specified inside BotkitConversations. [Fix for #1664](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/issues/1664), [#1679](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/issues/1679), and [#1699](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/issues/1699).\n* FIX: The text field in BotkitConversations was expected to always be an array, causing some confusion. It is now possible to pass in a string OR an array. Passing an array will cause Botkit to choose a random entry in the array for the message text.\n* FIX: Several updates have been made to the middleware pipeline so that it better matches expected behavior.  The receive and send middlewares will now fire for every incoming message - previously, there were cases where these would not fire. Thanks to [@adantoscano](https://github.com/adantoscano) for [this pull request](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/pull/1717) and also [this one](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/pull/1720). \n* FIX: The method for passing in a URI for communicating with Botkit CMS has been made more reliable, thanks to [@adantoscano](https://github.com/adantoscano).

This should make it easier to debug problems in middleware. Thanks to [@Nop0x](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/pull/1425).

[Some new documentation](docs/readme.md#conversation-events-and-middleware-endpoints)\n* Conversations powered by Botkit Studio will now include `convo.context.script_name` and `convo.context.script_id` which point back to the script loaded from the Botkit Studio API\n* When using Botkit Studio's execute script action, the resulting conversation object will have 2 additional context fields: `convo.context.transition_from` and `convo.context.transition_from_id` which will point to the script from which the user transitioned\n* When using Botkit Studio's execute script action, the original conversation from which the user is transitioning will have 2 additional context fields: `convo.context.transition_to` and `convo.context.transition_to_id` which will point to the script to which the user transitioned\n* Fix for Botkit Studio scripts which used \"end and mark successful\" action from a condition.

The brand new [Botkit Anywhere starter kit](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit-starter-web) includes a [customizable web chat client](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit-starter-web/blob/master/docs/botkit_web_client.md), and a [built-in chat server](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit-starter-web/blob/master/docs/botkit_chat_server.md).  Of course, this works with the existing stack of Botkit tools and plugins!\n\nNew for Botkit Studio:\n\nDevelopers using Botkit Studio to create and manage script content can now utilize a new message action in their conditional statements, or at the end of any thread.\nIt is now possible to direct your bot to seamlessly transition to a different Botkit Studio script. This allows for new patterns like interconnected menus, loops and branching conversations.\n\nNew core features:\n\nDevelopers can now exclude specific types of events from being included in conversations using `controller.excludeFromConversations(event_name)`.\nThis has been applied to the Facebook connector, which will now exclude certain events automatically.

All of the platform connectors have been refactored to use this new series of middleware functions, and are now implemented in a uniform way.\n\nDevelopers who make use of Botkit's middleware system should [take time to read this update](docs/readme-pipeline.md). Most current middleware functions will  continue to work as expected, but mild changes may be desirable to update these functions to use Botkit's latest features.\n\nIn addition, developers who use third party middleware plugins should carefully retest their applications after upgrading to version 0.6, as these plugins may need to be updated for full compatibility.\n\n**Upgrade Guide:**\n\nThis version of Botkit deprecates the `receive_via_postback` and `interactive_replies` options\nthat caused button clicks to be treated as typed messages.  These and other small changes to the way Botkit emits events may require minor updates to some Botkit apps.\n\n[Upgrading from Botkit 0.5 or lower? Read this guide!](docs/howto/upgrade_05to06.md)\n\n\n## 0.5.8\n\nSlack: Support for sending ephemeral messages with `bot.whisper()` and `bot.sendEphemeral()`.
