          "content": "# Contributing to NativeBase\n\nWe'd love for you to contribute to our source code and to make NativeBase even better than it is\ntoday! Here are some guidelines we'd like you to follow:\n\n- [Code of Conduct](#coc)\n- [Ways to Contribute](#wtc)\n- [Questions and Problems](#question)\n- [Issues and Bugs](#issue)\n- [Feature Requests](#feature)\n- [Issue Submission Guidelines](#submit)\n- [Setting Up Development Environment ](#dev-env)\n- [Pull Request Submission Guidelines](#submit-pr)\n- [Improving Documentation](#docs)\n\n## <a name=\"coc\"></a> Code of Conduct\n\nHelp us keep NativeBase open and inclusive. Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n## <a name=\"wtc\"></a> Ways to Contribute\n\nIf you are eager to start contributing code right away, you can go through [NativeBase Bugs](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/NativeBase/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug) that contain bugs.\n\nThere are other ways you can contribute without writing a single line of code. Here are a few things you can do to help out:\n\n1. **Replying and handling open issues.** We get a lot of issues every day, and some of them may lack necessary information. You can help out by guiding people through the process of filling out the issue template, asking for clarifying information, or pointing them to existing issues that match their description of the problem.\n2. **Reviewing pull requests for the docs.** Reviewing [documentation updates](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/nativebase-docs/pulls) can be as simple as checking for spelling and grammar. If you encounter situations that can be explained better in the docs, click **Edit** at the bottom left of most docs pages to get started with your own contribution.\n3. **Help people write test plans.** Some pull requests sent to the main repository may lack a proper test plan. These help reviewers understand how the change was tested, and can speed up the time it takes for a contribution to be accepted.\n\nEach of these tasks is highly impactful, and maintainers will greatly appreciate your help.\n\n## <a name=\"requests\"></a> Questions, Bugs, Features\n\n### <a name=\"question\"></a> Got a Question or Problem?\n\nDo not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports\nand feature requests. You've got much better chances of getting your question answered on dedicated\nsupport platforms, the best being [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/native-base).\n\nStack Overflow is a much better place to ask questions since:\n\n- there are thousands of people willing to help on Stack Overflow\n- questions and answers stay available for public viewing so your question / answer might help\n  someone else\n- Stack Overflow's voting system assures that the best answers are prominently visible.\n\nTo save your and our time, we will systematically close all issues that are requests for general\nsupport and redirect people to the section you are reading right now.\n\n### <a name=\"issue\"></a> Found an Issue or Bug?\n\nIf you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by submitting an issue to our\n[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/NativeBase/issues). Even better, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix.\n\n**Please see the [Submission Guidelines](#submit) below.**\n\n### <a name=\"feature\"></a> Missing a Feature?\n\nYou can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/NativeBase/issues).\n\nIf you would like to implement a new feature then consider what kind of change it is:\n\n- **Major Changes** that you wish to contribute to the project should be discussed first in an\n  [GitHub issue](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/NativeBase/issues) that clearly outlines the changes and benefits of the feature.\n- **Small Changes** can directly be crafted and submitted to the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/NativeBase)\n  as a Pull Request. See the section about [Contributing Code](#submit-pr).\n\n## <a name=\"submit\"></a> Issue Submission Guidelines\n\nBefore you submit your issue search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.\n\nIf your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue. Help us to maximize\nthe effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new features, by not reporting duplicate issues.\n\nThe \"[new issue](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/NativeBase/issues/new)\" form contains a number of prompts that you should fill out to\nmake it easier to understand and categorize the issue.\n\nIn general, providing the following information will increase the chances of your issue being dealt\nwith quickly:\n\n- **Issue Description** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps\n- **Motivation for or Use Case** - explain why this is a bug for you\n- **NativeBase Version(s)** - is it a regression?\n- **Browsers and Operating System** - is this a problem with all browsers or only specific ones?\n- **Reproduce the Error** - provide a live example (using [expo snack](https://snack.expo.io/) or an unambiguous set of steps.\n- **Related Issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?\n- **Suggest a Fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be\n  causing the problem (line of code or commit)\n\n## <a name=\"dev-env\"></a> Setting Up your Development Environment\n\n- Fork this repository.\n\n- Clone your fork of NativeBase:\n\n  ```git\n  git clone git@github.com:${YOUR_USERNAME}/NativeBase.git\n  ```\n\n- Navigate to NativeBase\n\n  ```\n  cd NativeBase/\n  ```\n\n- Add main repo remote:\n\n  ```git\n  git remote add nativebase git@github.com:GeekyAnts/NativeBase.git\n  ```\n\n- Install dependencies:\n\n  ```bash\n  yarn\n  ```\n\n- Move over to the TestBed Example App and install the dependencies :\n\n  ```bash\n  cd example\n  yarn\n  ```\n\n- Navigate back to your app:\n\n  ```bash\n  cd ..\n  ```\n\n- Start the Example App:\n\n  ```bash\n  yarn example start\n  ```\n\n  - To start app directly on Web\n    ```bash\n    yarn example web\n    ```\n  - To start app directly on IOS\n    ```bash\n    yarn example ios\n    ```\n  - To start app directly on Android\n    ```bash\n    yarn example android\n    ```\n\nand start making the changes.\n\n## <a name=\"submit-pr\"></a> Contributing Code\n\nCode-level contributions to NativeBase come in the form of [pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests). These are done by forking the repo and making changes locally. Directly in the repo, there is the [`Storybook Testbed` app](/example) that you can run on your device (or simulators) and use to test the changes you're making to NativeBase source.\n\nThe process of proposing a change to NativeBase can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. Fork the NativeBase repository and create your branch from `master`.\n2. Make the desired changes to NativeBase source. Use the `Storybook Testbed` app to test them out.\n3. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.\n4. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation, which is available [here](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/nativebase-docs).\n5. Ensure the test suite passes, either locally or on CI once you opened a pull request.\n6. Make sure your code lints. To keep project away from disputes we make use of **ESLint**, which is really a handy linting tool that enforces strict coding styles and makes sure your files are free from dead code. Each module of NativeBase has bundled ESLint as a dev dependency and checks your code everytime you commit.\n7. Push the changes to your fork.\n8. Create a pull request to the NativeBase repository.\n9. Review and address comments on your pull request.\n\nIf all goes well, your pull request will be merged. If it is not merged, maintainers will do their best to explain the reason why.\n\n## <a name=\"docs\"></a> Helping with Documentation\n\nThe NativeBase documentation is hosted as part of the NativeBase website repository at https://github.com/GeekyAnts/nativebase-docs. The website itself is located at <https://alpha.nativebase.io/> and it is built using [Docusaurus V2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/). If there's anything you'd like to change in the docs, you can get started by clicking on the \"Edit\" button located on the bottom left of most pages on the website.\n"

Introduction?\n\n[NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/) is a mobile-first, component library for React & React Native. Version 3.0 ships with complete ARIA integration, support for utility props and nearly 40 components that are consistent across Android, iOS and Web. Fast-track your dev process with NativeBase 3.0.\n\n**Recommended by [Awesome React Native](https://github.com/jondot/awesome-react-native)**\n\n> NativeBase was added to the list of Frameworks of Awesome React Native and it is used by numerous React lovers across the world.\n\n## 2. Motivation\n\nBuilding with React Native from scratch is a tedious process with multiple steps such as adding styling, interactions, state management, responsiveness, accessibility, etc. We wanted to build and ship accessible, high-quality apps quickly.\n<br />\n\nOur inspirations include Material UI, Chakra UI, Ant Design, Braid Design System, Bootstrap, TailwindCSS & Flutter.\n\n## 3. Features\n\n### **Out of the Box Accessibility**\n\nIntegrated with React ARIA and React Native ARIA, which provides React hooks. This enables you to build accessible design systems in no time.\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GeekyAnts/NativeBase/development/img/feature.png\" alt=\"Out of the box accessibility\">\n\n### **Supporting Utility Props**\n\nPowered by [Styled System](https://styled-system.com) so you can rapidly build custom UI components with constraint-based utility style props.\n\n### **Rich Component Library**\n\nNativeBase offers around 40 components so you can build seamlessly. It includes button, checkbox, flex, stack and more.\n\n### **Highly Themeable**\n\nThemeability is one of the core elements of NativeBase. You can customise your app theme and component styles to your heart's content.\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GeekyAnts/NativeBase/development/img/theme.png\" alt=\"Nativebase Logo\">\n\n### **Available for Both Mobile and Web**\n\nNativeBase 3.0 is powered by React Native Web so you can build consistent UIs across Web, Android and iOS.\n\n### **Responsiveness Made Easy**\n\nInstead of manually adding responsiveness, NativeBase 3.0 allows you to provide object and array values to add responsive styles.\n\n### **Now with** **Dark Mode**\n\nBuilding apps with a dark mode setting just got a whole lot easier. NativeBase is now optimised for light and dark modes.\n\n## 4. Dependencies\n\nReact Native, Expo\n\n## 5. Installation\n\nNativeBase is supported in Expo or React Native CLI initiated apps. Web support is made possible by react-native-web.\n\nRefer the [guides](https://docs.nativebase.io/installation) to setup NativeBase in your React app.\n\n## 6.
