          "content": "# Contributing\n\nHey! Thank you for deciding to contribute to Mock Service Worker! This page will help you land your first contribution by giving you a better understanding about the project's structure, dependencies, and development workflow.\n\n## Tools\n\nGetting yourself familiar with the tools below will substantially ease your contribution experience.\n\n- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)\n- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)\n- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)\n\n## Dependencies\n\nMock Service Worker depends on multiple other libraries.\n\n| Library name                                            | Purpose                                                                  |\n| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| [cookies](https://github.com/mswjs/cookies)             | Enables cookies persistence and inference between environments.          |\n| [headers-utils](https://github.com/mswjs/headers-utils) | `Headers` polyfill to manage request/response headers.                   |\n| [interceptors](https://github.com/mswjs/interceptors)   | Provisions request interception in Node.js (internals of `setupServer`). |\n\nThere are cases when an issue originates from one of the said dependencies. Don't hesitate to address it in the respective repository, as they all are governed by the same team.\n\n## Getting started\n\n### Fork the repository\n\nPlease use the GitHub UI to [fork this repository](https://github.com/mswjs/msw) (_read more about [Forking a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)_). Mock Service Worker has forked builds enabled in the CI, so you will see the build status of your fork's branch.\n\n### Install\n\n```bash\n$ cd msw\n$ pnpm install\n$ pnpm start\n```\n\n> Please use [PNPM][pnpm-url] version 8.15 while working on this project.\n> Guide on how to install a specific PNPM version can be [found here][pnpm-install-guide-url].\n\n## Git workflow\n\n```bash\n# Checkout the default branch and ensure it's up-to-date\n$ git checkout main\n$ git pull --rebase\n\n# Create a feature branch\n$ git checkout -b feature/graphql-subscriptions\n\n# Commit the changes\n$ git add .\n$ git commit\n# Follow the interactive prompt to compose a commit message\n\n# Push\n$ git push -u origin feature/graphql-subscriptions\n```\n\nWe are using [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) naming convention. It helps us automate library releases and ensure clean and standardized commit tree. Please take a moment to read about the said convention before you name your commits.\n\n> **Tip:** running `git commit` will open an interactive prompt in your terminal. Follow the prompt to compose a valid commit message.\n\nOnce you have pushed the changes to your remote feature branch, [create a pull request](https://github.com/open-draft/msw/compare) on GitHub. Undergo the process of code review, where the maintainers of the library will help you get the changes from good to great, and enjoy your implementation merged to the default branch.\n\n> Please be respectful when requesting and going through the code review. Everyone on the team is interested in merging quality and well tested code, and we're hopeful that you have the same goal. It may take some time and iterations to get it right, and we will assist you throughout the process.\n\n## Build\n\nBuild the library with the following command:\n\n```bash\n$ pnpm build\n```\n\n## Tests\n\n### Testing levels\n\nThere are two levels of tests on the project:\n\n- [Unit tests](#unit-tests), cover small independent functions.\n- [Integration tests](#integration-tests), test in-browser usage scenarios.\n\n**Always begin your implementation from tests**. When tackling an issue, a test for it must be missing, or is incomplete. When working on a feature, starting with a test allows you to model the feature's usage before diving into implementation.\n\n### Unit tests\n\n#### Writing a unit test\n\nUnit tests are placed next to the tested code. For example, if you're testing a newly added `multiply` function, create a `multiply.test.ts` file next to where the function is located:\n\n```bash\n$ touch src/utils/multiply.test.ts\n```\n\nProceed by writing a unit test that resembles the usage of the function. Make sure to cover all the scenarios\n\n```ts\n// src/utils/multiply.test.ts\nimport { multiply } from './multiply'\n\ntest('multiplies two given numbers', () => {\n  expect(multiply(2, 3)).toEqual(6)\n})\n```\n\n> Please [avoid nesting](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/avoid-nesting-when-youre-testing/) while you're testing.\n\n#### Running a single unit test\n\nOnce your test is written, run it in isolation.\n\n```bash\n$ pnpm test:unit src/utils/multiply.test.ts\n```\n\nAt this point, the actual implementation is not ready yet, so you can expect your test to fail. **That's perfect**. Add the necessary modules and logic, and gradually see your test cases pass.\n\n#### Running all unit tests\n\n```bash\n$ pnpm test:unit\n```\n\n### Integration tests\n\nWe follow an example-driven testing paradigm, meaning that each integration test represents a _usage example_. Mock Service Worker can be used in different environments (browser, Node.js), making such usage examples different.\n\n> **Make sure that you [build the library](#build) before running the integration tests**. It's a good idea to keep the build running (`pnpm start`) while working on the tests. Keeping both compiler and test runner in watch mode boosts your productivity.\n\n#### Browser integration tests\n\nYou can find all the browser integration tests under `./test/browser`. Those tests are run with Playwright and usually consist of two parts:\n\n- `[test-name].mocks.ts`, the usage example of MSW;\n- `[test-name].test.ts`, the test suite that loads the usage example, does actions and performs assertions.\n\nIt's also a great idea to get familiar with our Playwright configuration and extensions:\n\n- [**Playwright configuration file**](./test/browser/playwright.config.ts)\n- [Playwright extensions](./test/browser/playwright.extend.ts)\n\nLet's write an example integration test that asserts the interception of a GET request. First, start with the `*.mocks.ts` file:\n\n```js\n// test/browser/example.mocks.ts\nimport { http, HttpResponse } from 'msw'\nimport { setupWorker } from 'msw/browser'\n\nconst worker = setupWorker(\n  http.get('/books', () => {\n    return HttpResponse.json([\n      {\n        id: 'ea42ffcb-e729-4dd5-bfac-7a5b645cb1da',\n        title: 'The Lord of the Rings',\n        publishedAt: -486867600,\n      },\n    ])\n  }),\n)\n\nworker.start()\n```\n\n> Notice how there's nothing test-specific in the example? The `example.mocks.ts` file is a copy-paste example of intercepting the `GET /books` request. This allows to share these mocks with the users as a legitimate example, because it is!\n\nOnce the `*.mocks.ts` file is written, proceed by creating a test file:\n\n```ts\n// test/browser/example.test.ts\nimport * as path from 'path'\nimport { test, expect } from './playwright.extend'\n\ntest('returns a mocked response', async ({ loadExample, fetch }) => {\n  // Compile the given usage example on runtime.\n  await loadExample(require.resolve('./example.mocks.ts'))\n\n  // Perform the \"GET /books\" request in the browser.\n  const res = await fetch('/books')\n\n  // Assert the returned response body.\n  expect(await res.json()).toEqual([\n    {\n      id: 'ea42ffcb-e729-4dd5-bfac-7a5b645cb1da',\n      title: 'The Lord of the Rings',\n      publishedAt: -486867600,\n    },\n  ])\n})\n```\n\n##### Running all browser tests\n\n```sh\npnpm test:browser\n```\n\n#### Running a single browser test\n\n```sh\npnpm test:browser ./test/browser/example.test.ts\n```\n\n#### Node.js integration test\n\nIntegration tests showcase a usage example in Node.js and are often placed next to the in-browser tests. Node.js integration tests reside in the `./test/node` directory.\n\nSimilar to the browser tests, these are going to contain a usage example and the assertions over it. However, for Node.js tests there is no need to create a separate `*.mocks.ts` file. Instead, keep the usage example in the test file directly.\n\nLet's replicate the same `GET /books` integration test in Node.js.\n\n```ts\n// test/node/example.test.ts\nimport { http, HttpResponse } from 'msw'\nimport { setupServer } from 'msw/node'\n\nconst server = setupServer(\n  http.get('/books', () => {\n    return HttpResponse.json([\n      {\n        id: 'ea42ffcb-e729-4dd5-bfac-7a5b645cb1da',\n        title: 'The Lord of the Rings',\n        publishedAt: -486867600,\n      },\n    ])\n  }),\n)\n\nbeforeAll(() => server.listen())\n\nafterAll(() => server.close())\n\ntest('returns a mocked response', async () => {\n  const res = await fetch('/books')\n\n  expect(await res.json()).toEqual([\n    {\n      id: 'ea42ffcb-e729-4dd5-bfac-7a5b645cb1da',\n      title: 'The Lord of the Rings',\n      publishedAt: -486867600,\n    },\n  ])\n})\n```\n\n##### Running all Node.js tests\n\n```sh\npnpm test:node\n```\n\n##### Running a single Node.js test\n\n```sh\npnpm test:node ./test/node/example.test.ts\n```\n\n## Build\n\nBuild the library with the following command:\n\n```bash\n$ pnpm build\n```\n\n[pnpm-url]: https://pnpm.io/\n[page-with-url]: https://github.com/kettanaito/page-with\n[pnpm-install-guide-url]: https://pnpm.io/8.x/installation#installing-a-specific-version\n"

A dedicated layer of requests interception at your disposal. Keep your application's code and tests unaware of whether something is mocked or not.\n- **Deviation-free**. Request the same production resources and test the actual behavior of your app. Augment an existing API, or design it as you go when there is none.\n- **Familiar & Powerful**. Use [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express)-like routing syntax to intercept requests. Use parameters, wildcards, and regular expressions to match requests, and respond with necessary status codes, headers, cookies, delays, or completely custom resolvers.\n\n---\n\n> \"_I found MSW and was thrilled that not only could I still see the mocked responses in my DevTools, but that the mocks didn't have to be written in a Service Worker and could instead live alongside the rest of my app. This made it silly easy to adopt. The fact that I can use it for testing as well makes MSW a huge productivity booster._\"\n>\n> – [Kent C. Dodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds)\n\n## Documentation\n\nThis README will give you a brief overview on the library but there's no better place to start with Mock Service Worker than its official documentation.\n\n- [Documentation](https://mswjs.io/docs)\n- [**Getting started**](https://mswjs.io/docs/getting-started)\n- [FAQ](https://mswjs.io/docs/faq)\n\n## Examples\n\n- See the list of [**Usage examples**](https://github.com/mswjs/examples)\n\n## Browser\n\n- [Learn more about using MSW in a browser](https://mswjs.io/docs/integrations/browser)\n- [`setupWorker` API](https://mswjs.io/docs/api/setup-worker)\n\n### How does it work?\n\nIn-browser usage is what sets Mock Service Worker apart from other tools. Utilizing the [Service Worker API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API), which can intercept requests for the purpose of caching, Mock Service Worker responds to intercepted requests with your mock definition on the network level. This way your application knows nothing about the mocking.\n\n**Take a look at this quick presentation on how Mock Service Worker functions in a browser:**\n\n[![What is Mock Service Worker?](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mswjs/msw/main/media/msw-video-thumbnail.jpg)](https://youtu.be/HcQCqboatZk)\n\n### How is it different?\n\n- This library intercepts requests on the network level, which means _after_ they have been performed and \"left\" your application. As a result, the entirety of your code runs, giving you more confidence when mocking;\n- Imagine your application as a box. Every API mocking library out there opens your box and removes the part that does the request, placing a blackbox in its stead. Mock Service Worker leaves your box intact, 1-1 as it is in production. Instead, MSW lives in a separate box next to yours;\n- No more stubbing of `fetch`, `axios`, `react-query`, you-name-it;\n- You can reuse the same mock definition for the unit, integration, and E2E testing. Did we mention local development and debugging? Yep. All running against the same network description without the need for adapters of bloated configurations.\n\n### Usage example\n\n```js\n// src/mocks.js\n// 1. Import the library.\nimport { http, HttpResponse } from 'msw'\nimport { setupWorker } from 'msw/browser'\n\n// 2. Describe network behavior with request handlers.\nconst worker = setupWorker(\n  http.get('https://github.com/octocat', ({ request, params, cookies }) => {\n    return HttpResponse.json(\n      {\n        message: 'Mocked response',\n      },\n      {\n        status: 202,\n        statusText: 'Mocked status',\n      },\n    )\n  }),\n)\n\n// 3. Start request interception by starting the Service Worker.\nawait worker.start()\n```\n\nPerforming a `GET https://github.com/octocat` request in your application will result into a mocked response that you can inspect in your browser's \"Network\" tab:\n\n![Chrome DevTools Network screenshot with the request mocked](https://github.com/mswjs/msw/blob/main/media/msw-quick-look-network.png?raw=true)\n\n> **Tip:** Did you know that although Service Worker runs in a separate thread, your mock definition executes entirely on the client? This way you can use the same languages, like TypeScript, third-party libraries, and internal logic to create the mocks you need.\n\n## Node.js\n\n- [Learn more about using MSW in Node.js](https://mswjs.io/docs/integrations/node)\n- [`setupServer` API](https://mswjs.io/docs/api/setup-server)\n\n### How does it work?\n\nThere's no such thing as Service Workers in Node.js. Instead, MSW implements a [low-level interception algorithm](https://github.com/mswjs/interceptors) that can utilize the very same request handlers you have for the browser. This blends the boundary between environments, allowing you to focus on your network behaviors.\n\n### How is it different?\n\n- Does not stub `fetch`, `axios`, etc. As a result, your tests know _nothing_ about mocking;\n- You can reuse the same request handlers for local development and debugging, as well as for testing. Truly a single source of truth for your network behavior across all environments and all tools.\n\n### Usage example\n\nTake a look at the example of an integration test in Vitest that uses [React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library) and Mock Service Worker:\n\n```js\n// test/Dashboard.test.js\n\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { http, HttpResponse } from 'msw'\nimport { setupServer } from 'msw/node'\nimport { render, screen, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react'\nimport Dashboard from '../src/components/Dashboard'\n\nconst server = setupServer(\n  // Describe network behavior with request handlers.\n  // Tip: move the handlers into their own module and\n  // import it across your browser and Node.js setups!\n  http.get('/posts', ({ request, params, cookies }) => {\n    return HttpResponse.json([\n      {\n        id: 'f8dd058f-9006-4174-8d49-e3086bc39c21',\n        title: `Avoid Nesting When You're Testing`,\n      },\n      {\n        id: '8ac96078-6434-4959-80ed-cc834e7fef61',\n        title: `How I Built A Modern Website In 2021`,\n      },\n    ])\n  }),\n)\n\n// Enable request interception.\nbeforeAll(() => server.listen())\n\n// Reset handlers so that each test could alter them\n// without affecting other, unrelated tests.\nafterEach(() => server.resetHandlers())\n\n// Don't forget to clean up afterwards.\nafterAll(() => server.close())\n\nit('displays the list of recent posts', async () => {\n  render(<Dashboard />)\n\n  // 🕗 Wait for the posts request to be finished.\n  await waitFor(() => {\n    expect(\n      screen.getByLabelText('Fetching latest posts...'),\n    ).not.toBeInTheDocument()\n  })\n\n  // ✅ Assert that the correct posts have loaded.\n  expect(\n    screen.getByRole('link', { name: /Avoid Nesting When You're Testing/ }),\n  ).toBeVisible()\n\n  expect(\n    screen.getByRole('link', { name: /How I Built A Modern Website In 2021/ }),\n  ).toBeVisible()\n})\n```\n\n> Don't get overwhelmed! We've prepared a step-by-step [**Getting started**](https://mswjs.io/docs/getting-started) tutorial that you can follow to learn how to integrate Mock Service Worker into your project.\n\nDespite the API being called `setupServer`, there are no actual servers involved! The name was chosen for familiarity, and the API was designed to resemble operating with an actual server.\n\n## Sponsors\n\nMock Service Worker is trusted by hundreds of thousands of engineers around the globe. It's used by companies like Google, Microsoft, Spotify, Amazon, and countless others. Despite that, this library remains a hobby project maintained in spare time and has no opportunity to financially support even a single full-time contributor.\n\n**You can change that!** Consider [sponsoring the effort](https://github.com/sponsors/mswjs) behind one of the most innovative approaches around API mocking. Raise a topic of open source sponsorships with your boss and colleagues. Let's build sustainable open source together!\n\n### Golden Sponsors\n\n> Become our _golden sponsor_ and get featured right here, enjoying other perks like issue prioritization and a personal consulting session with us.\n>\n> **Learn more on our [GitHub Sponsors profile](https://github.com/sponsors/mswjs)**.\n\n<br />\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td>\n      <a href=\"https://www.github.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <picture>\n          <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"media/sponsors/github-light.svg\" />\n          <img src=\"media/sponsors/github.svg\" alt=\"GitHub\" height=\"64\" />\n        </picture>\n      </a>\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      <a href=\"https://www.codacy.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <img src=\"media/sponsors/codacy.svg\" alt=\"Codacy\" height=\"64\" />\n      </a>\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      <a href=\"https://workleap.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <img src=\"media/sponsors/workleap.svg\" alt=\"Workleap\" height=\"64\" width=\"174\" />\n      </a>\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      <a href=\"https://www.chromatic.com/?ref=mswjs\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <img src=\"media/sponsors/chromatic.svg\" alt=\"Chromatic\" height=\"64\" />\n      </a>\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n### Silver Sponsors\n\n> Become our _silver sponsor_ and get your profile image and link featured right here.\n>\n> **Learn more on our [GitHub Sponsors profile](https://github.com/sponsors/mswjs)**.\n\n<br />\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td>\n      <a href=\"https://www.replay.io/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <img src=\"media/sponsors/replay.svg\" alt=\"Replay\" height=\"64\" />\n      </a>\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      <a href=\"https://codemod.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <img src=\"media/sponsors/codemod.svg\" alt=\"Codemod\" height=\"64\" width=\"128\" />\n      </a>\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      <a href=\"https://github.com/ryanmagoon\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <img src=\"https://github.com/ryanmagoon.png\" alt=\"Ryan Magoon\" height=\"64\" />\n      </a>\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n### Bronze Sponsors\n\n> Become our _bronze sponsor_ and get your profile image and link featured in this section.\n>\n> **Learn more on our [GitHub Sponsors profile](https://github.com/sponsors/mswjs)**.\n\n<br />\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td>\n      <a href=\"https://materialize.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <img src=\"media/sponsors/materialize.svg\" alt=\"Materialize\" height=\"64\" />\n      </a>\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      <a href=\"https://trigger.dev/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <img src=\"media/sponsors/trigger-dev.png\" alt=\"Trigger.dev\" height=\"64\" />\n      </a>\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      <a href=\"https://vital.io/\" target=\"_blank\">\n        <img src=\"media/sponsors/vital.svg\" alt=\"Vital\" width=\"64\" />\n      </a>\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n## Awards & Mentions\n\nWe've been extremely humbled to receive awards and mentions from the community for all the innovation and reach Mock Service Worker brings to the JavaScript ecosystem.\n\n<table>\n  <tr valign=\"middle\">\n    <td width=\"124\">\n      <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mswjs/msw/main/media/tech-radar.png\" width=\"124\" alt=\"Technology Radar\">\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      <h4>Solution Worth Pursuing</h4>\n      <p><em><a href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/languages-and-frameworks/mock-service-worker\">Technology Radar</a> (2020–2021)</em></p>\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td width=\"124\">\n      <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mswjs/msw/main/media/os-awards.png\" width=\"124\" alt=\"Open Source Awards 2020\">\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      <h4>The Most Exciting Use of Technology</h4>\n      <p><em><a href=\"https://osawards.com/javascript/2020\">Open Source Awards</a> (2020)</em></p>\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n"
