You can get the SHA from:\n  - [`@builder.io/qwik`](https://github.com/QwikDev/qwik-build/commits/) commits\n  - [`@builder.io/qwik-city`](https://github.com/QwikDev/qwik-city-build/commits/) commits\n  - [`@builder.io/qwik-labs`](https://github.com/QwikDev/qwik-labs-build/commits/) commits\n- `#build/name` (or `#main`) - Install a specific `build/*` (or `#main`) branch:\n  - [`@builder.io/qwik`](https://github.com/QwikDev/qwik-build/branches/) branches\n  - [`@builder.io/qwik-city`](https://github.com/QwikDev/qwik-city-build/branches/) branches\n  - [`@builder.io/qwik-labs`](https://github.com/QwikDev/qwik-labs-build/branches/) branches\n    > NOTE: Package managers will treat any SHA in the lock file which is on the branch as valid, and so they will not auto upgrade to the latest. For this reason this is not recommended.\n\n## Bisect for regression\n\nYou can bisect different commits to `main` to determine which specific change has cause the regression.\n\n1. Install latest to get an upper mound\n2. Install oldest known good to get a lower bound\n3. Keep bisecting until you find a specific SHA where the code breaks.\n\nWhen creating the issue please include which SHA has caused the regression.\n"

          "content": "# Contributing to Qwik\n\nThank you for taking an interest in contributing to Qwik! We appreciate you! 🫶🏽\n\nBelow are the guidelines on how to help in the best possible way.\n\n## Submitting an Issue\n\nBefore creating a new issue, please search through open issues using the [GitHub issue search bar](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/filtering-and-searching-issues-and-pull-requests). You might find the solution to your problem, or can verify that it is an already known issue.\n\nWe want a bug-free and best-performing project. That's why we take all reported issues to heart. But please be aware that if we can't reproduce the problem, we won't have a way of locating and adequately fixing it.\n\nTherefore, to solve the problem in the best possible way, please create a minimal repository that reproduces the problem with the least possible code explaining and demonstrating the error.\n\nWithout enough information to reproduce the issue, we will close it because we can't recreate and solve it.\n\n## Triaging Issues\n\nIf you're interested in helping out with triaging issues, please follow the [Triaging Guide](./contributing/TRIAGE.md).\n\n## Submitting a Pull Request (PR)\n\n### Branch Organization\n\nWe adopt [trunk-based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/) therefore all Pull Requests are made against the main branch.\nBefore releasing, we merge `main` into a release branch, for testing purposes.\n\n### Good first issue\n\nThe issues marked with [_Good first issue_](https://github.com/QwikDev/qwik/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22COMMUNITY%3A++good+first+issue%22) are a good starting point to familiarize yourself with the project.\n\nBefore solving the problem, please check with the maintainers that the issue is still relevant. Feel free to leave a comment on the issue to show your intention to work on it and prevent other people from unintentionally duplicating your effort.\n\n### Sending a Pull Request\n\nBefore submitting a pull request, consider the following guidelines:\n\n- Fork the repository into your own account.\n- In your forked repository, create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch main`\n- Make your changes/fixes.\n- Run `pnpm fmt` to lint the code.\n- Add a changeset with `pnpm change` if needed ([follow this tutorial](https://go.screenpal.com/watch/cZivIcVPJQV))\n- Push your branch to GitHub: `git push origin my-branch`\n- In GitHub, send a pull request to `QwikDev:main`.\n\n> If you aren't sure your PR is ready, open it as a [draft](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/) to make it clear to the maintainer.\n\n### ⚠ Troubleshooting PR build issues on CI\n\nEvery PR is being automatically merged with `main` before the CI Github actions run.\nThat's why if the CI checks aren't passing your PR branch is probably not up to date.\n\n**For non documentation PRs please do the following:**\n\n1. Merge `main` into your PR branch\n2. Run `pnpm api.update`\n3. Run `pnpm build.local` or `pnpm build.full` if you made a change to the Rust code\n4. Commit and push any changes as a result of the above steps\n\n## Local development\n\nThis is the best approach because all required dependencies will be installed in the docker container for you and won't affect your personal configuration in any way.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nYou need to have these tools up and running in your local machine:\n\n- an editor. We recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).\n- one of the following:\n  - [Nix](https://nixos.org)\n  - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)\n  - Locally installed NodeJS v18+ and optionally Rust\n\n#### Nix\n\n[Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html) can be used on macOS and Linux. It keeps installation files in `/nix` and doesn't write anywhere else. It has a declarative configuration in the `flake.nix` file, which describes all the tools needed to build the project.\n\n- Install it on your machine and enable flakes. The [DetSys installer](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer) makes that easy.\n- run `nix develop` in the project root to open a shell with all the tools, or use `direnv` to have them automatically added into your current shell.\n\n##### Nix + Direnv (optional)\n\nYou can additionally use [direnv](https://direnv.net/) to automatically load the dev environment when you enter the project directory.\nThere is also a VSCode plugin for direnv that reloads the extensions so they get environment changes.\nWhen you install direnv, you'll need to allow it once with `direnv allow` in the project root. From then on, when you `cd` into the project, it will automatically have the correct tools installed.\n\n#### Docker\n\n- Install the [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension in your VSCode.\n- Once installed you will be prompted to 'Reopen the folder to develop in a container [learn more](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) or Clone repository in Docker volume for [better I/O performance](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers#_quick-start-open-a-git-repository-or-github-pr-in-an-isolated-container-volume)'. If you're not prompted, you can run the `Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container` command from the [VSCode Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette).\n\nAlternatively you can use [devcontainers/cli](https://github.com/devcontainers/cli):\n\n- Install devcontainers following their documentation.\n- In your terminal navigate to the Qwik's project root directory.\n- Then run `devcontainer up --workspace-folder .`. This command will start a Docker container with all required environment dependencies.\n\n##### Using development container without Dev Containers and VSCode\n\nIf you would like to make use of the development container solution, but don't use VSCode or Dev Containers, you still can do so, by following steps:\n\n- Build development container locally: `cd .devcontainer; docker build -t qwik-container .`\n- Run development container from Qwik project root, binding the directory to container: `cd ..; docker run --rm -d --name qwik-container -p 3300:3300 -p 9229:9299 -v $PWD:/home/circleci/project -t qwik-container`\n\nDocker command does:\n\n- Create a new container that is removed once stopped,\n- In daemon mode,\n- With name `qwik-container`,\n- That exposes the ports `3300` and `9229`, and\n- Binds `qwik` project directory to container working directory.\n\n##### Podman extras\n\n> This section is highly influenced by SO answer: https://serverfault.com/a/1075838/352338\n> If you use [Podman](https://podman.io/) instead of Docker as your containers engine, then you need to know the following:\n\n- Container runs as user `circleci` with UID `1001` and GID `1002`.\n- As you are accustomed to using Podman, you will need to append `:Z` to `volumes | -v` parameter so the command becomes:\n\n```bash\n$ subuid_size=65536\n$ subgid_size=65536\n$ container_uid=1001\n$ container_gid=1002\n$ podman run --rm \\\n    --user $container_uid:$container_gid \\\n    --uidmap=0:1:$container_uid \\\n    --uidmap=$((container_uid + 1)):$((container_uid + 1)):$((subuid_size - $container_uid)) \\\n    --uidmap=$container_uid:0:1 \\\n    --gidmap=0:1:$container_gid \\\n    --gidmap=$((container_gid + 1)):$((container_gid + 1)):$((subgid_size - $container_gid)) \\\n    --gidmap=$container_gid:0:1 \\\n    -d --name qwik-container \\\n    -p 3300:3300 -p 9229:9299 \\\n    -v .:/home/circleci/project:Z \\\n    -t qwik-container\n```\n\n#### Locally installed tools\n\nIf you're not able to use the dev container, make sure you have NodeJS v18+ installed, as well as `pnpm`.\n\nFurthermore, to build the optimizer you optionally need Rust.\n\n1. Make sure [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) is installed.\n2. Install [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/) with `cargo install wasm-pack` .\n3. Node version >= `18`.\n4. Make sure you have [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) installed.\n5. run `pnpm install`\n\n> On Windows, Rust requires [C++ build tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/). You can also select _Desktop development with C++_\n> while installing Visual Studio.\n\n---\n\n## Development\n\nTo build Qwik for local development, install the dev dependencies using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) and then do an initial build.\n\n```shell\npnpm install && pnpm build.local\n```\n\nIf you want to work on the Rust code, use `build.full` instead of `build.local`.\n\n### Fast build\n\nThis will build only Qwik and Qwik City and their types. This is not enough to run the docs.\n\n```shell\npnpm build.core\n```\n\n### Custom build\n\nOnce you have done a full build, the types are built, and you can build just the code you're working on. For qwik and qwik-city, you can do very fast rebuilds with\n\n```shell\npnpm build --dev --qwik --qwikcity\n```\n\nThe `--dev` flag skips type checking and generating.\n\nYou can run `pnpm build` without parameters to see which flags are available. Notable:\n\n- `--tsc`: build types\n- `--api`: build API docs and type bundles. Requires `--tsc` to have run.\n- `--build`: Qwik (you'll probably also need `--dev`)\n- `--qwikcity`: Qwik City (you'll probably also need `--dev`)\n- `--qwikreact`: Qwik React\n- `--qwiklabs`: Qwik Labs\n- `--eslint`: Eslint plugin\n\nE.g. to build only the React integration, you'd run `pnpm build --qwikreact`.\n\n### Full build without Rust\n\nThis builds everything except Rust prerequisites and the optimizer binaries. Instead, those binaries are copied from the latest Qwik package on NPM.\n\n```shell\npnpm build.local\n```\n\n### Full build with Rust\n\nIt will build **everything**, including Rust packages and WASM.\n\n> First build might be very slow.\n\n- Builds each submodule\n- Generates bundled `.d.ts` files for each submodule with [API Extractor](https://api-extractor.com/)\n- Checks the public API hasn't changed\n- Builds a minified `core.min.mjs` file\n- Generates the publishing `package.json`\n\n```shell\npnpm build.full\n```\n\nThe build output will be written to `packages/qwik/dist`, which will be the directory that is published to [@builder.io/qwik](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@builder.io/qwik).\n\nTo update the Rust test snapshots after you've made changes to the Rust code, run `pnpm test.rust.update`.\n\n### Run in your own app\n\nSay you made changes to the repo and you want to try them out in your app. Once built, all the Qwik packages are directly usable in your project by using the linking in your package manager.\n\nThis is very easy to do with `pnpm`:\nAssuming qwik is in `../qwik`, run this inside the root of your app:\n\n```shell\npnpm link ../qwik/packages/qwik\npnpm link ../qwik/packages/qwik-city\n```\n\nOther package managers probably need to first be told about the packages. For example, with `bun` you need to `cd ../qwik/packages/qwik` and `bun link`, repeat for `qwik-city`. Then in your app run `bun link @builder.io/qwik @builder.io/qwik-city`.\n\nIf you can't use package linking, just copy the contents of `packages/qwik` into your projects' `node_modules/@builder.io/qwik` folder, and/or the contents of `packages/qwik-city` into your projects' `node_modules/@builder.io/qwik-city` folder.\n\n### Working on the docs site\n\nAt the root of the Qwik repo folder run:\n\n```shell\npnpm docs.dev\n```\n\n### To open the test apps for debugging run\n\n```shell\npnpm serve\n```\n\n### Unit Tests Only\n\nUnit tests use [vitest](https://vitest.dev)\n\n```shell\npnpm test.unit\n```\n\n### E2E Tests Only\n\nE2E tests use [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).\n\nTo run the Playwright tests headless, from start to finish, run:\n\n```shell\npnpm test.e2e.chromium\n```\n\nFinally, you can use `pnpm --filter` command to run packages' commands, for example:\n\n```shell\npnpm --filter qwik-docs start\n```\n\nMore commands can be found in each package's package.json scripts section.\n\n### Updating dependencies\n\nTo update all dependencies, run:\n\n```shell\npnpm deps\n```\n\nThis will show an interactive UI to update all dependencies. Be careful about performing major updates, especially for the docs site, since not all functionality has test coverage there. Be sure to test thoroughly.\n\n## Starter CLI `create-qwik`\n\n- [Starter CLI](https://github.com/QwikDev/qwik/blob/main/starters/README.md)\n\n## Pull Requests\n\n- [Open Qwik in StackBlitz Codeflow](https://pr.new/github.com/QwikDev/qwik/)\n- Review PR in StackBlitz\n  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4918140/195581745-8dfca1f9-2dcd-4f6a-b7aa-705f3627f8fa.png)\n\n### Coding conventions\n\nWrite code that is clean, simple and easy to understand. Complicated one-liners are generally frowned upon, unless they are for performance reasons and are clearly marked as such with a comment and explanation.\n\nWhen code does something unexpected, add a comment explaining why.\n\nWhen a comment is longer, prefer using `/** */` JSDoc comments as that will be auto-formatted as Markdown.\nJSDoc comments will also become part of the API documentation when they apply to exports, so write them as such.\n\n`pnpm fmt` is your friend, and we recommend setting up Prettier and using format-on-save in your editor.\n\n### Commit conventions\n\nIf you don't follow these commit conventions, your PR will be squashed. This means your local branch will not be part of the commit history of the target branch.\nFor larger PRs, it would really help if you follow these guidelines.\n\n- Create a commit for each logical unit and make sure it passes linting.\n- Keep your commits focused and atomic. Each commit should represent a single, coherent change.\n- If you have commits like `wip lol` or `fixup`, squash them. Use `git rebase -i`.\n- Commits must follow the format: `type(scope): description`\n  For example: `feat(qwik-city): confetti animations` or `chore: pnpm api.update`\n\n  Common types include:\n\n  - feat: A new feature\n  - fix: A bug fix\n  - docs: Documentation only changes\n  - lint: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc)\n  - refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature\n  - perf: A code change that improves performance\n  - test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests\n  - chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation\n\n  The `scope` is optional and should be a short identifier for the changed part of the code.\n\n- Use the imperative mood in the description. For example, use \"add\" instead of \"added\" or \"adds\".\n- For consistency, there should not be a period at the end of the commit message's summary line (the first line of the commit message).\n\n### Writing good commit messages\n\nIn addition to writing properly formatted commit messages, it's important to include relevant information so other developers can later understand _why_ a change was made. While this information usually can be found by digging into the code, pull request discussions or upstream changes, it may require a lot of work.\n\n- Be clear and concise in your commit messages.\n- Explain the reason for the change, not just what was changed.\n- If the commit fixes a specific issue, reference it in the commit message (e.g., \"Fixes #123\").\n\n### Adding a changeset\n\nWhenever you make a change that requires mentioning in the changelog, you should add a changeset. This will automatically generate meaningful release notes and changelog files.\n\nYou can add multiple changesets in a PR, for example because you implement different features for different packages, or because you have multiple noteworthy commits.\n\nYou create a new changeset file by running:\n\n```shell\npnpm change\n```\n\nThis will ask you which packages should be included in the changeset, and if the changes require a new version bump. Generally you should not select `major`, and you should only select `minor` if there are new features or significant improvements. If you don't select either it will become `patch`.\n\nFor your convenience, we prepared a video tutorial that covers the process of adding a changeset:\n\n[📽 TUTORIAL: Adding a changeset](https://go.screenpal.com/watch/cZivIcVPJQV)\n\n## PR merging (maintainers)\n\nMake sure the PR follows all the guidelines in this document. Once you think the PR is good to merge, if the commits are \"nice\", you can merge the PR. If not, squash the PR.\n\nIn case the PR is stuck waiting for the original author to apply a trivial\nchange (a typo, capitalization change, etc.) and the author allowed the members\nto modify the PR, consider applying it yourself (or commit the existing review\nsuggestion). You should pay extra attention to make sure the addition doesn't go\nagainst the idea of the original PR and would not be opposed by the author.\n\n## Releasing (maintainers)\n\nMerge the \"version\" PR, that is automatically created when a PR with a changeset is merged. You can first edit the files it created to get a nicer changelog.\n\nOnce CI passes, the GitHub Action will publish the new version to NPM.\n"

          "content": "# Qwik Project Governance\n\nThis governance document reflects our dedication to maintaining Qwik as an open, fair, and collaborative project and is a continuation of our [community values](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MrSp2caaREETHUL56C2fIIJeFJsBA_sWJ9raL6hWoo8/edit#heading=h.bpbzghkvfgrn).\n\nQwik is rooted in a commitment to innovation and community-driven development where the needs of the community drive the framework's evolution.\n\nOur decisions are guided by what serves Qwik and the broader web ecosystem best, with a strong emphasis on seeking consensus.\n\nThe following outlines the structure of the project, including the roles and responsibilities of its members.\n\n## Community Contributors\n\nA Community contributor is any community member who contributes to the success of the framework.\n\nContributors usually are part of one or more of the following categories:\n\n1. **Code Contributors** - Developers who contribute by identifying issues, submitting pull requests, or maintaining community-driven Qwik projects.\n2. **Docs Contributors** - Members who enhance or correct the Qwik documentation, ensuring it remains accurate and accessible.\n3. **Support Contributors** - Members who assist other developers by answering questions and offering support.\n4. **Content Creators** - Those who produce educational content, tutorials, and other resources to help the community better understand and use Qwik.\n5. **Local Community Leaders** - Members who organize and lead local Qwik communities, fostering in-person engagement and knowledge sharing.\n\n## Qwik Heroes\n\nQwik Heroes are recognized as top contributors who have exceptional dedication and enthusiasm for Qwik.\n\nHeroes have easier access to the core team and participate in monthly meetings to provide feedback, ask questions, and discuss internal topics together with the team.\n\n#### Nomination\n\nAny community contributor can be nominated as a Qwik Hero by an existing member or by any of the leadership teams. Selections are made by the Community Management Team (and in conjunction with the core team for cases of “code heroes”).\n\n#### Status Change\n\nRemoval of Qwik Heroes is done by either a voluntary resignation or by a Community Management Team decision, or (in extreme cases) by a Stewardship Team motion.\n\nQwik Heroes who become inactive for 6 months are automatically reverted to regular community contributor status.\n\n## Core Team\n\nCore team members are contributors who have merging rights to the project and are actively involved in the ongoing development of Qwik. They are essential to the framework's evolution, participating in weekly sprint meetings and Core Leadership meetings (although only Core Leadership members can vote in these meetings).\n\nThe Core Team will have a Core Team Lead who will be in charge of the ongoing project management and development progress.\n\n#### Nomination\n\nA Qwik Hero member can be nominated as a Core Team member by any member of the Core Team. Nominations are decided upon by a standard Core Leadership motion.\n\n#### Status Change\n\nRemoval of Core Team members is done by either a voluntary resignation or by a standard Core Leadership motion, or (in extreme cases) by a Stewardship Team motion.\n\nA Core Team member will be automatically converted back to a \"Qwik Hero\" if they are not active in the project for over 3 months.\n\n## Core Leadership Team\n\nThe Core Leadership Team includes Core Team members who are granted voting rights on strategic technical decisions.\n\nThese individuals are selected because of their experience, judgment, good faith, and alignment with Qwik's core values.\n\nMembers of this team are expected to participate in Core Leadership Team activities and meetings and can cast votes when consensus is not reached on a specific decision.\n\n#### Nomination\n\nRegular Core Team members can be nominated to the Core Leadership Team by any current Core Leadership member, with the final decision made through a standard Core Leadership motion.\n\n#### Status Change\n\nRemoval of voting Core Leadership members is done by either a voluntary resignation or by a standard Core Leadership motion, or (in extreme cases) by a Stewardship Team motion.\n\nA Core Leadership member will be automatically converted to a regular Core Team member if they do not participate in 3 consecutive votes or have been inactive for over 4 months.\n\n## Docs Team\n\nThe Docs Team is responsible for maintaining and improving Qwik's documentation.\n\nThis team ensures that the documentation is up-to-date, accurate, and user-friendly, and also handles the triage of docs-related issues and the merging of related PRs.\n\n#### Nomination\n\nA Qwik Hero member can be nominated as a Docs Team member by any member of the Docs Team. Nominations need to be approved by the Growth Manager.\n\n#### Status Change\n\nRemoval of Docs Team members is done by either a voluntary resignation or by a Growth Manager decision, or (in extreme cases) by a Stewardship Team motion.\n\nA Docs Team member will be automatically converted back to a \"Qwik Hero\" if they are not active in the project for over 3 months.\n\n## Community Management Team\n\nThe Community Management Team oversees the onboarding, safety, and overall vibe of the Qwik community.\n\nThey ensure that the community remains a friendly and inclusive space where members follow the Qwik community guidelines.\n\nThe team is responsible for managing \"Local Community Leaders\" and \"Support Heroes\" and helping them succeed in their roles and contributions.\n\n#### Nomination\n\nQwik Heroes may be nominated to the Community Management Team by any current team member. Nominations need to be approved by the Growth Manager.\n\n#### Status Change\n\nRemoval of Community Management Team members is done by either a voluntary resignation or by a Growth Manager decision, or (in extreme cases) by a Stewardship Team motion.\n\nA Community Management Team member will be automatically converted back to a \"Qwik Hero\" if they are not active in the project for over 3 months.\n\n## Outreach Team\n\nThe Outreach Team is responsible of spreading Qwik's message, ensuring that more developers are introduced to the framework and give it a try. Their responsibilities include managing social media, collaborating with content creators, representing Qwik at conferences, and more.\n\n#### Nomination\n\nQwik Heroes may be nominated to the Outreach Team by any current team member. Nominations need to be approved by the Growth Manager.\n\n#### Status Change\n\nRemoval of Outreach Team members is done by either a voluntary resignation or by a Growth Manager decision, or (in extreme cases) by a Stewardship Team motion.\n\nAn Outreach Team member will be automatically converted back to a \"Qwik Hero\" if they are not active in the project for over 3 months.\n\n## Growth Manager\n\nThe Growth Manager is responsible for overseeing the Community Management, Outreach, and Docs Teams, ensuring that their efforts are aligned and that messaging across these teams remains consistent.\n\nThis role is crucial in driving the strategic direction of Qwik's growth and ensuring that all community-facing activities are cohesive and effective.\n\nThe Growth Manager is appointed or replaced by a standard Stewardship Team motion.\n\n## Stewardship Team\n\nThe project's stewards are in charge of all aspects regarding the framework.\n\nThis includes the development, community, and growth of the framework, but also creating proper management processes, managing sponsorships and budgets, collaborations, and more.\n\nThe project stewards are: Misko Hevery and Shai Reznik.\n\nThe project stewards will be used as \"tiebreakers\" in votes and hold veto rights on decisions (to protect the framework from rare and extreme cases).\n\nBecause the framework can be forked by the community at any point, the project stewards must manage the project in a fair, honest, and thoughtful way, taking into account what's good for the community and resolving conflicting needs as much as possible.\n\n---\n\ninspired by [Node](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md), [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/wiki/Governance-Document), [Astro](https://github.com/withastro/.github/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md) and [Nuxt](https://github.com/nuxt/governance)\n"
