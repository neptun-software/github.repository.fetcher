          "content": "# Migrating from hls.js 1.x to 1.4+\n\nThe 1.4 version of hls.js now ships with an ESM version of the library (`dist/hls.mjs`) which requires that you specify the [`workerPath` config option](https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js/blob/master/docs/API.md#workerpath) in order for web workers to be used. This should point to the `dist/hls.worker.js` file included in the package.\n\nIf you are using the UMD version (`dist/hls.js`), no changes are required.\n\n**Important Note:** If you are using a bundler, such as webpack, the ESM version of the package will likely be used by default. If this is the case, make sure to add the `workerPath` config option after upgrading to hls.js 1.4 or above.\n\n# Migrating from hls.js 0.x to 1.x\n\nThis guide provides an overview to migrating an application using hls.js from v0.14.x to v1.0.0.\n\n## Dependencies\n\nPromise support is now required. If your app requires support for older browsers that do not include support for Promises,\ninclude your own Promise polyfill.\n\n## Configuration Changes\n\n### Back Buffer Eviction\n\nThe new `backBufferLength` setting applies to Live and VOD streams. It defaults to Infinity, leaving back buffer eviction to the browser to perform on SourceBuffer append (https://www.w3.org/TR/media-source-2/#sourcebuffer-coded-frame-eviction). The demo page includes a setting of 90 seconds for demonstration purposes.\n\nIn v1.0 and up, the back buffer on VOD and Live content will be left up to the browser by default. Set `backBufferLength` to `Infinity` and `liveBackBufferLength` to `90` if you would like v1 to handle back buffer eviction for Live and VOD streams as older versions did. While `liveBackBufferLength` can still be used, it has been\nmarked deprecated and may be removed in an upcoming minor release.\n\n### Front Buffer Eviction\n\nThe new `frontBufferFlushThreshold` setting defaults to Infinity seconds and governs active eviction of buffered ranges outside of\nthe current contiguous front buffer. For example, given currentTime=0 and bufferedRanges=[[0, 100], [150, 200]] with\na configured frontBufferFlushThreshold=60, we will only remove the range from [150, 200] as it lies outside of the target buffer length\nand is not contiguous with the forward buffer from the currentTime of 0.\n\n### Low Latency Streams\n\nThe new `lowLatencyMode` setting is enabled by default. Set to `false` to disable Low-latency part loading and target\nlatency playback rate adjustment.\n\n### Chunked Transfer Support (experimental)\n\nThe new experimental `progressive` setting is disabled by default. Set it to `true` to stream and append audio and\nvideo data as it streams for each segment before segment load completion. Not recommended for production or small segments\nwith only a single GoP or less.\n\n## Support for Group-Level Track Switching\n\n- `hls.audioTracks` and `hls.subtitleTracks` as well as `AUDIO_TRACKS_UPDATED` and `SUBTITLE_TRACKS_UPDATED` events only list tracks in the active level's audio/sub GROUP-ID after `LEVEL_LOADING` (this will go unnoticed for streams with no or only one group per track type)\n  - The `MANIFEST_PARSED` event still reports all tracks when multiple GROUP-ID values are present. Applications that used that event to get tracks would need to be updated in v1 to switch to the corresponding track update events to select available tracks using the available indexes.\n  - Track ids are no longer indexes of the complete list of audio or subtitle tracks. They are now indexes within each group. So six tracks in two groups that had ids 0,1,2,3,4,5 will now have ids 0,1,2,0,1,2. This allows for tracks to be changed by index/id within the range of available tracks as they were before.\n- Added `groupId` to audio and subtitle track loading and loaded events\n\n## Playback and Level Changes\n\n- Setting `hls.currentLevel` no longer pauses the media element while clearing the buffer and loading the new level. This can result in a stall error if playback doesn't start within a quarter of a second. Applications implementing manual quality switching with `hls.currentLevel` that do not want a stall reported should either pause or set `video.playbackRate` to `0` until the level switch is complete.\n\n- The maximum gap that will be jumped is now driven via the GapController `MAX_START_GAP_JUMP`. By default this value is set to two seconds, to match with the value that browsers will automatically skip when the `autoplay` attribute on the `<video>` element is set to true.\n\n## Event Changes\n\nEvent order and content have changed in some places. See **Breaking Changes** below, and please report any issues with breaking changes that impact your integrations\n\n- `FRAG_LOADED` fires after events handled on progress which can include everything up to appending a fragment if workers are disabled (more details below under **Known Issues**)\n- `BUFFER_CODECS` data has changed from `{ tracks: { video?, audio? } }` to simply `{ video?, audio? }`\n- `BUFFER_APPENDING` data has changed from `{ type, data, parent, content }` to `{ type, data, frag, chunkMeta }`\n- `BUFFER_APPENDED` data has changed\n- `FRAG_DECRYPT_ERROR` events are now surfaced as a `FRAG_PARSING_ERROR` along with other fragment transmuxing errors\n- Added additional error details to help identify the source of certain network error events:\n  - `SUBTITLE_LOAD_ERROR`\n  - `SUBTITLE_TRACK_LOAD_TIMEOUT`\n  - `UNKNOWN`\n- Added additional error detail for streams that cannot start because source buffer(s) could not be created after parsing media codecs\n  - `BUFFER_INCOMPATIBLE_CODECS_ERROR` will fire instead of `BUFFER_CREATED` with an empty `tracks` list. This media error\n    is fatal and not recoverable. If you encounter this error make sure you include the correct CODECS string in\n    your manifest, as this is most likely to occur when attempting to play a fragmented mp4 playlist with unknown codecs.\n- `FRAG_LOAD_PROGRESS` has been **deprecated**\n- `FRAG_PARSING_DATA` has been **deprecated**\n- `STREAM_STATE_TRANSITION` has been **deprecated**\n\n### Fragment Stats\n\n- The `stats` object has changed\n  - `trequest`, `tfirst`, `tload` have been replaced by `loading: HlsProgressivePerformanceTiming`\n  - `tparsed` has been replaced by `parsing: HlsProgressivePerformanceTiming`\n- On the `Fragment` object:\n  - `hasElementaryStream` function has been removed\n  - `setElementaryStream` and `_elementaryStreams` have been renamed (these are only for internal use)\n\n### LL-HLS Parts in events\n\n- FRAG\\_\\_\\_\\_ events are now fired for LL-HLS part events with a `part` property that include the part details.\n\n### TypeScript\n\nv0.x types are not compatible with v1.x. Type definitions are now exported with the build and npm package in\n`dist/hls.d.ts` and `dist/hls.d.mts`. Please use these type definitions if you are having trouble with\n[DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped) `@types/hls.js` and v1.x.\n"

See the example below (Using HLS.js) to run appropriate feature detection and choose between using HLS.js or natively built-in HLS support.\n\nWhen a platform has neither MediaSource nor native HLS support, the browser cannot play HLS.\n\n_Keep in mind that if the intention is to support HLS on multiple platforms, beyond those compatible with HLS.js, the HLS streams need to strictly follow the specifications of RFC8216, especially if apps, smart TVs, and set-top boxes are to be supported._\n\nFind a support matrix of the MediaSource API here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaSource\n\n## Using HLS.js\n\n### Installation\n\nPrepackaged builds are included [with each release](https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js/releases). Or install the hls.js as a dependency\nof your project:\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save hls.js\n```\n\nA canary channel is also available if you prefer to work off the development branch (master):\n\n```\nnpm install hls.js@canary\n```\n\n### Embedding HLS.js\n\nDirectly include dist/hls.js or dist/hls.min.js in a script tag on the page. This setup prioritizes HLS.js MSE playback over\nnative browser support for HLS playback in HTMLMediaElements:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hls.js@1\"></script>\n<!-- Or if you want the latest version from the main branch -->\n<!-- <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hls.js@canary\"></script> -->\n<video id=\"video\"></video>\n<script>\n  var video = document.getElementById('video');\n  var videoSrc = 'https://test-streams.mux.dev/x36xhzz/x36xhzz.m3u8';\n  if (Hls.isSupported()) {\n    var hls = new Hls();\n    hls.loadSource(videoSrc);\n    hls.attachMedia(video);\n  }\n  // HLS.js is not supported on platforms that do not have Media Source\n  // Extensions (MSE) enabled.\n  //\n  // When the browser has built-in HLS support (check using `canPlayType`),\n  // we can provide an HLS manifest (i.e. .m3u8 URL) directly to the video\n  // element through the `src` property. This is using the built-in support\n  // of the plain video element, without using HLS.js.\n  else if (video.canPlayType('application/vnd.apple.mpegurl')) {\n    video.src = videoSrc;\n  }\n</script>\n```\n\n#### Alternative setup\n\nTo check for native browser support first and then fallback to HLS.js, swap these conditionals. See [this comment](https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js/pull/2954#issuecomment-670021358) to understand some of the tradeoffs.\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hls.js@1\"></script>\n<!-- Or if you want the latest version from the main branch -->\n<!-- <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hls.js@canary\"></script> -->\n<video id=\"video\"></video>\n<script>\n  var video = document.getElementById('video');\n  var videoSrc = 'https://test-streams.mux.dev/x36xhzz/x36xhzz.m3u8';\n  //\n  // First check for native browser HLS support\n  //\n  if (video.canPlayType('application/vnd.apple.mpegurl')) {\n    video.src = videoSrc;\n    //\n    // If no native HLS support, check if HLS.js is supported\n    //\n  } else if (Hls.isSupported()) {\n    var hls = new Hls();\n    hls.loadSource(videoSrc);\n    hls.attachMedia(video);\n  }\n</script>\n```\n\n#### Ensure correct time in video\n\nHLS transcoding of an original video file often pushes the time of the first frame a bit. If you depend on having an exact match of frame times between original video and HLS stream, you need to account for this:\n\n```javascript\nlet tOffset = 0;\nconst getAppendedOffset = (eventName, { frag }) => {\n  if (frag.type === 'main' && frag.sn !== 'initSegment' && frag.elementaryStreams.video) {\n    const { start, startDTS, startPTS, maxStartPTS, elementaryStreams } = frag;\n    tOffset = elementaryStreams.video.startPTS - start;\n    hls.off(Hls.Events.BUFFER_APPENDED, getAppendedOffset);\n    console.log('video timestamp offset:', tOffset, { start, startDTS, startPTS, maxStartPTS, elementaryStreams });\n  }\n}\nhls.on(Hls.Events.BUFFER_APPENDED, getAppendedOffset);\n// and account for this offset, for example like this:\nconst video = document.querySelector('video');\nvideo.addEventListener('timeupdate', () => setTime(Math.max(0, video.currentTime - tOffset))\nconst seek = (t) => video.currentTime = t + tOffset;\nconst getDuration = () => video.duration - tOffset;\n```\n\nFor more embed and API examples see [docs/API.md](./docs/API.md).\n\n## CORS\n\nAll HLS resources must be delivered with [CORS headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS) permitting `GET` requests.\n\n## Video Control\n\nVideo is controlled through HTML `<video>` element `HTMLVideoElement` methods, events and optional UI controls (`<video controls>`).\n\n## Build a Custom UI\n\n- [Media Chrome](https://github.com/muxinc/media-chrome)\n\n## Player Integration\n\nThe following players integrate HLS.js for HLS playback:\n\n- [JW Player](https://www.jwplayer.com)\n- [Akamai Adaptive Media Player (AMP)](https://www.akamai.com/us/en/solutions/products/media-delivery/adaptive-media-player.jsp)\n- [BridTV Player](https://www.brid.tv)\n- [Clappr](https://github.com/clappr/clappr)\n- [Flowplayer](https://www.flowplayer.org) through [flowplayer-hlsjs](https://github.com/flowplayer/flowplayer-hlsjs)\n- [MediaElement.js](https://www.mediaelementjs.com)\n- [KalturaPlayer](https://developer.kaltura.com) through [kaltura-player-js](https://github.com/kaltura/kaltura-player-js#readme)\n- [Videojs](https://videojs.com) through [Videojs-hlsjs](https://github.com/benjipott/videojs-hlsjs)\n- [Videojs](https://videojs.com) through [videojs-hls.js](https://github.com/streamroot/videojs-hls.js). hls.js is integrated as a SourceHandler -- new feature in Video.js 5.\n- [Videojs](https://videojs.com) through [videojs-contrib-hls.js](https://github.com/Peer5/videojs-contrib-hls.js).
