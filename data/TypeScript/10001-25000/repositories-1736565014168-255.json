For help using MetaMask, visit our [User Support Site](https://support.metamask.io/).\n\nFor [general questions](https://community.metamask.io/c/learn/26), [feature requests](https://community.metamask.io/c/feature-requests-ideas/13), or [developer questions](https://community.metamask.io/c/developer-questions/11), visit our [Community Forum](https://community.metamask.io/).\n\nMetaMask supports Firefox, Google Chrome, and Chromium-based browsers. We recommend using the latest available browser version.\n\nFor up to the minute news, follow us on [X](https://x.com/MetaMask).\n\nTo learn how to develop MetaMask-compatible applications, visit our [Developer Docs](https://metamask.github.io/metamask-docs/).\n\nTo learn how to contribute to the MetaMask codebase, visit our [Contributor Docs](https://github.com/MetaMask/contributor-docs).\n\nTo learn how to contribute to the MetaMask Extension project itself, visit our [Extension Docs](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/tree/main/docs).\n\n## GitHub Codespaces quickstart\n\nAs an alternative to building on your local machine, there is a new option to get a development environment up and running in less than 5 minutes by using GitHub Codespaces. Please note that there is a [Limited Free Monthly Quota](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces), and after that GitHub will start charging you.\n\n_Note: You are billed for both time spent running, and for storage used_\n\n[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/MetaMask/metamask-extension?quickstart=1)\n\n1. Start by clicking the button above\n2. A new browser tab will open with a remote version of Visual Studio Code (this will take a few minutes to load)\n3. A \"Simple Browser\" will open inside the browser with noVNC -- click Connect\n   - Optional steps:\n     - Click the button at the upper-right of the Simple Browser tab to open the noVNC window in its own tab\n     - Open the noVNC sidebar on the left, click the gear icon, change the Scaling Mode to Remote Resizing\n4. Wait about 20 extra seconds on the first launch, for the scripts to finish\n5. Right-click on the noVNC desktop to launch Chrome or Firefox with MetaMask pre-installed\n6. Change some code, then run `yarn start` to build in dev mode\n7. After a minute or two, it will finish building, and you can see your changes in the noVNC desktop\n\n### Tips to keep your Codespaces usage lower\n\n- You are billed for both time spent running, and for storage used\n- Codespaces pause after 30 minutes of inactivity, and auto-delete after 30 days of inactivity\n- You can manage your Codespaces here: https://github.com/codespaces\n  - You may want to manually pause them before the 30 minute timeout\n  - If you have several idle Codespaces hanging around for several days, you can quickly run out of storage quota. You should delete the ones you do not plan to use anymore, and probably keep only 1 or 2 in the long-term. It's also possible to re-use old Codespaces and switch the branch, instead of creating new ones and deleting the old ones.\n\n### Codespaces on a fork\n\nIf you are not a MetaMask Internal Developer, or are otherwise developing on a fork, the default Infura key will be on the Free Plan and have very limited requests per second. If you want to use your own Infura key, follow the `.metamaskrc` and `INFURA_PROJECT_ID` instructions in the section [Building on your local machine](#building-on-your-local-machine).\n\n## Building on your local machine\n\n- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 20\n  - If you are using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) (recommended) running `nvm use` will automatically choose the right node version for you.\n- Enable Corepack by executing the command `corepack enable` within the metamask-extension project. Corepack is a utility included with Node.js by default. It manages Yarn on a per-project basis, using the version specified by the `packageManager` property in the project's package.json file. Please note that modern releases of [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) are not intended to be installed globally or via npm.\n- Duplicate `.metamaskrc.dist` within the root and rename it to `.metamaskrc` by running `cp .metamaskrc{.dist,}`.\n  - Replace the `INFURA_PROJECT_ID` value with your own personal [Infura API Key](https://docs.infura.io/networks/ethereum/how-to/secure-a-project/project-id).\n    - If you don't have an Infura account, you can create one for free on the [Infura website](https://app.infura.io/register).\n  - If debugging MetaMetrics, you'll need to add a value for `SEGMENT_WRITE_KEY` [Segment write key](https://segment.com/docs/connections/find-writekey/), see [Developing on MetaMask - Segment](./development/README.md#segment).\n  - If debugging unhandled exceptions, you'll need to add a value for `SENTRY_DSN` [Sentry Dsn](https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-basics/dsn-explainer/), see [Developing on MetaMask - Sentry](./development/README.md#sentry).\n  - Optionally, replace the `PASSWORD` value with your development wallet password to avoid entering it each time you open the app.\n- Run `yarn install` to install the dependencies.\n- Build the project to the `./dist/` folder with `yarn dist` (for Chromium-based browsers) or `yarn dist:mv2` (for Firefox)\n\n  - Optionally, to create a development build you can instead run `yarn start` (for Chromium-based browsers) or `yarn start:mv2` (for Firefox)\n  - Uncompressed builds can be found in `/dist`, compressed builds can be found in `/builds` once they're built.\n  - See the [build system readme](./development/build/README.md) for build system usage information.\n\n- Follow these instructions to verify that your local build runs correctly:\n  - [How to add custom build to Chrome](./docs/add-to-chrome.md)\n  - [How to add custom build to Firefox](./docs/add-to-firefox.md)\n\n## Git Hooks\n\nTo get quick feedback from our shared code quality fitness functions before committing the code, you can install our git hooks with Husky.\n\n`$ yarn githooks:install`\n\nYou can read more about them in our [testing documentation](./docs/testing.md#fitness-functions-measuring-progress-in-code-quality-and-preventing-regressions-using-custom-git-hooks).\n\nIf you are using VS Code and are unable to make commits from the source control sidebar due to a \"command not found\" error, try these steps from the [Husky docs](https://typicode.github.io/husky/troubleshooting.html#command-not-found).\n\n## Contributing\n\n### Development builds\n\nTo start a development build (e.g. with logging and file watching) run `yarn start`.\n\n#### Development build with wallet state\n\nYou can start a development build with a preloaded wallet state, by adding `TEST_SRP='<insert SRP here>'` and `PASSWORD='<insert wallet password here>'` to the `.metamaskrc` file. Then you have the following options:\n\n1. Start the wallet with the default fixture flags, by running `yarn start:with-state`.\n2. Check the list of available fixture flags, by running `yarn start:with-state --help`.\n3. Start the wallet with custom fixture flags, by running `yarn start:with-state --FIXTURE_NAME=VALUE` for example `yarn start:with-state --withAccounts=100`. You can pass as many flags as you want. The rest of the fixtures will take the default values.\n\n#### Development build with Webpack\n\nYou can also start a development build using the `yarn webpack` command, or `yarn webpack --watch`. This uses an alternative build system that is much faster, but not yet production ready. See the [Webpack README](./development/webpack/README.md) for more information.\n\n#### React and Redux DevTools\n\nTo start the [React DevTools](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools), run `yarn devtools:react` with a development build installed in a browser. This will open in a separate window; no browser extension is required.\n\nTo start the [Redux DevTools Extension](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools/tree/main/extension):\n\n- Install the package `remotedev-server` globally (e.g. `yarn global add remotedev-server`)\n- Install the Redux Devtools extension.\n- Open the Redux DevTools extension and check the \"Use custom (local) server\" checkbox in the Remote DevTools Settings, using the default server configuration (host `localhost`, port `8000`, secure connection checkbox unchecked).\n\nThen run the command `yarn devtools:redux` with a development build installed in a browser. This will enable you to use the Redux DevTools extension to inspect MetaMask.\n\nTo create a development build and run both of these tools simultaneously, run `yarn start:dev`.\n\n#### Test Dapp\n\n[This test site](https://metamask.github.io/test-dapp/) can be used to execute different user flows.\n\n### Running Unit Tests and Linting\n\nRun unit tests and the linter with `yarn test`. To run just unit tests, run `yarn test:unit`.\n\nYou can run the linter by itself with `yarn lint`, and you can automatically fix some lint problems with `yarn lint:fix`. You can also run these two commands just on your local changes to save time with `yarn lint:changed` and `yarn lint:changed:fix` respectively.\n\nFor Jest debugging guide using Node.js, see [docs/tests/jest.md](docs/tests/jest.md).\n\n### Running E2E Tests\n\nOur e2e test suite can be run on either Firefox or Chrome. Here's how to get started with e2e testing:\n\n#### Preparing a Test Build\n\nBefore running e2e tests, ensure you've run `yarn install` to download dependencies. Next, you'll need a test build. You have 3 options:\n\n1. Use `yarn download-builds:test` to quickly download and unzip test builds for Chrome and Firefox into the `./dist/` folder. This method is fast and convenient for standard testing.\n2. Create a custom test build: for testing against different build types, use `yarn build:test`. This command allows you to generate test builds for various types, including:\n   - `yarn build:test` for main build\n   - `yarn build:test:flask` for flask build\n   - `yarn build:test:mmi` for mmi build\n   - `yarn build:test:mv2` for mv2 build\n3. Start a test build with live changes: `yarn start:test` is particularly useful for development. It starts a test build that automatically recompiles application code upon changes. This option is ideal for iterative testing and development. This command also allows you to generate test builds for various types, including:\n   - `yarn start:test` for main build\n   - `yarn start:test:flask` for flask build\n   - `yarn start:test:mv2` for mv2 build\n\nNote: The `yarn start:test` command (which initiates the testDev build type) has LavaMoat disabled for both the build system and the application, offering a streamlined testing experience during development. On the other hand, `yarn build:test` enables LavaMoat for enhanced security in both the build system and application, mirroring production environments more closely.\n\n#### Running Tests\n\nOnce you have your test build ready, choose the browser for your e2e tests:\n\n- For Firefox, run `yarn test:e2e:firefox`.\n  - Note: If you are running Firefox as a snap package on Linux, ensure you enable the appropriate environment variable: `FIREFOX_SNAP=true yarn test:e2e:firefox`\n- For Chrome, run `yarn test:e2e:chrome`.\n\nThese scripts support additional options for debugging. Use `--help`to see all available options.\n\n#### Running a single e2e test\n\nSingle e2e tests can be run with `yarn test:e2e:single test/e2e/tests/TEST_NAME.spec.js` along with the options below.\n\n```console\n  --browser           Set the browser to be used; specify 'chrome', 'firefox', 'all'\n                      or leave unset to run on 'all' by default.\n                                                          [string] [default: 'all']\n  --debug             Run tests in debug mode, logging each driver interaction\n                                                         [boolean] [default: true]\n  --retries           Set how many times the test should be retried upon failure.\n                                                              [number] [default: 0]\n  --leave-running     Leaves the browser running after a test fails, along with\n                      anything else that the test used (ganache, the test dapp,\n                      etc.)                              [boolean] [default: false]\n  --update-snapshot   Update E2E test snapshots\n                                             [alias: -u] [boolean] [default: false]\n```\n\nFor example, to run the `account-details` tests using Chrome, with debug logging and with the browser set to remain open upon failure, you would use:\n`yarn test:e2e:single test/e2e/tests/account-menu/account-details.spec.js --browser=chrome --leave-running`\n\n#### Running e2e tests against specific feature flag\n\nWhile developing new features, we often use feature flags. As we prepare to make these features generally available (GA), we remove the feature flags. Existing feature flags are listed in the `.metamaskrc.dist` file. To execute e2e tests with a particular feature flag enabled, it's necessary to first generate a test build with that feature flag activated. There are two ways to achieve this:\n\n- To enable a feature flag in your local configuration, you should first ensure you have a `.metamaskrc` file copied from `.metamaskrc.dist`. Then, within your local `.metamaskrc` file, you can set the desired feature flag to true. Following this, a test build with the feature flag enabled can be created by executing `yarn build:test`.\n\n- Alternatively, for enabling a feature flag directly during the test build creation, you can pass the parameter as true via the command line. For instance, activating the MULTICHAIN feature flag can be done by running `MULTICHAIN=1 yarn build:test` or `MULTICHAIN=1 yarn start:test` . This method allows for quick adjustments to feature flags without altering the `.metamaskrc` file.\n\nOnce you've created a test build with the desired feature flag enabled, proceed to run your tests as usual. Your tests will now run against the version of the extension with the specific feature flag activated. For example:\n`yarn test:e2e:single test/e2e/tests/account-menu/account-details.spec.js --browser=chrome`\n\nThis approach ensures that your e2e tests accurately reflect the user experience for the upcoming GA features.\n\n#### Running specific builds types e2e test\n\nDifferent build types have different e2e tests sets. In order to run them look in the `package.json` file. You will find:\n\n```console\n    \"test:e2e:chrome:mmi\": \"SELENIUM_BROWSER=chrome node test/e2e/run-all.js --mmi\",\n    \"test:e2e:chrome:snaps\": \"SELENIUM_BROWSER=chrome node test/e2e/run-all.js --snaps\",\n    \"test:e2e:firefox\": \"SELENIUM_BROWSER=firefox node test/e2e/run-all.js\",\n```\n\n#### Note: Running MMI e2e tests\n\nWhen running e2e on an MMI build you need to know that there are 2 separated set of tests:\n\n- MMI runs a subset of MetaMask's e2e tests. To facilitate this, we have appended the `@no-mmi` tags to the names of those tests that are not applicable to this build type.\n- MMI runs another specific set of e2e legacy tests which are better documented [here](test/e2e/mmi/README.md)\n\n### Changing dependencies\n\nWhenever you change dependencies (adding, removing, or updating, either in `package.json` or `yarn.lock`), there are various files that must be kept up-to-date.\n\n- `yarn.lock`:\n  - Run `yarn` again after your changes to ensure `yarn.lock` has been properly updated.\n  - Run `yarn lint:lockfile:dedupe:fix` to remove duplicate dependencies from the lockfile.\n- The `allow-scripts` configuration in `package.json`\n  - Run `yarn allow-scripts auto` to update the `allow-scripts` configuration automatically. This config determines whether the package's install/postinstall scripts are allowed to run. Review each new package to determine whether the install script needs to run or not, testing if necessary.\n  - Unfortunately, `yarn allow-scripts auto` will behave inconsistently on different platforms. macOS and Windows users may see extraneous changes relating to optional dependencies.\n- The LavaMoat policy files\n  - If you are a MetaMask team member and your PR is on a repository branch, you can use the bot command `@metamaskbot update-policies` to ask the MetaMask bot to automatically update the policies for you.\n  - If your PR is from a fork, you can ask a MetaMask team member to help with updating the policy files.\n  - Manual update instructions: The _tl;dr_ is to run `yarn lavamoat:auto` to update these files, but there can be devils in the details:\n    - There are two sets of LavaMoat policy files:\n      - The production LavaMoat policy files (`lavamoat/browserify/*/policy.json`), which are re-generated using `yarn lavamoat:webapp:auto`.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Trademarks.

Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.

If\n     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for\n     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to\n     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our\n     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain\n     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of\n     the licensed material may still be restricted for other\n     reasons, including because others have copyright or other\n     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,\n     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.\n     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to\n     respect those requests where reasonable.

Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or\n     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights\n     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\n  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,\n     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public\n     License.\n\n  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the\n     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to\n     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the\n     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\n\n  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights\n     under this Public License.\n\n  i.

You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights\n     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\n\n\nSection 2 -- Scope.\n\n  a. License grant.\n\n       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\n          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\n          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\n          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\n            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\n               in part; and\n\n            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n\n       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n          its terms and conditions.\n\n       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n          6(a).\n\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n       5. Downstream recipients.\n\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\n            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n               Material.\n\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b. Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database;\n\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\nlicenses.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Trademarks.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy this and change the name.\n 1b. Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY being a dick.\n 1c. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER dick.\n\n2. If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work,\nshare the love. Only a dick would make loads off this work and not buy the original work's\ncreator(s) a pint.\n\n3. Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching when it goes wrong makes\nyou a DONKEY dick. Fix the problem yourself.
