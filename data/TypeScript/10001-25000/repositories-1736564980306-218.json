          "content": "# Local Development\n\nWelcome 🎉!! If you've found a bug, or have an idea to add a feature we'd love to hear from you. It may save time to first ping the group on [Partytown's Discord channel](https://discord.gg/aHKdpdWv7a) to talk through any ideas or any issues that may be a bug.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nSee the [distribution](https://partytown.qwik.dev/distribution) section about the various files created. Note that both the root directory, and the `tests` directory receive a copy of the build files, such as `tests/~partytown/partytown.js`.\n\n## Submitting Issues And Writing Tests\n\nWe need your help! If you found a bug, it's best to create a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) that replicates the issue using a test page.\n\n- Minimal Reproduction Case: If maintainers and contributors are unable to reproduce the same error, then it makes it very difficult to debug and fix. Any issued opened without a minimal reproduction example will be closed.\n- E2E Test: A good example of an End-to-end test is one where the test fails before the fix, and passes after the fix. But also, all the other tests pass too.\n\nIn the [tests directory](https://github.com/BuilderIO/partytown/tree/main/tests), copy one of the directories, such as `tests/platform/document`, and recreate the issue you've found.\n\nFollow the [manual testing](#manual-testing) directions on how to start the local dev server. Next, the more you can describe the debug and pin-point the issue the better, and any fixes to the runtime to solve the problem would be awesome. 🎉\n\nIf the PR fixes the issue, then creating an [end-to-end test](#e2e-testing) would help ensure no regressions happen over time.\n\nAdditionally, Github issues is a place to explain a problem in detail, along with a reproduction case for maintainers. However, Github issues is not the best place to ask how-to questions since project contributors and maintainers don’t have the capacity to debug external websites and the many third-party scripts. Any issues opened asking that are not following these guidelines will be closed.\n\nPlease also see the [FAQ section](https://partytown.qwik.dev/faq) for more info\n\n## Plugin Authors / Developers\n\nIf you are the author / developer of any 3rd party plugin / library, and want to ensure that your library works with Partytown, we would love to work with you to ensure it does!\n\nThe easiest way to verify is to create a small, standalone replica in our [integration tests directory](https://github.com/BuilderIO/partytown/tree/main/tests/integrations). Our standard practice is to:\n\n- Create a `standard.html` which loads your library / plugin as it normally is loaded, as a `<script type=\"text/javascript\">`. This file basically is your normal, happy case, with no Partytown in sight.\n- Create an `index.html` which loads your library, but also sets up Partytown. This file should:\n  - Setup the `partytown` configuration\n  - Load the `partytown.js` file\n  - Mark the library / plugin that you want to test as `text/partytown` instead of `text/javascript`\n\nTo get a sense of this, you can take a look at some examples in the `tests/integrations` folder like [Twitter](https://github.com/BuilderIO/partytown/tree/main/tests/integrations/twitter/index.html). Usually, creating a copy of one of these folders and modifying it for a new plugin is the easiest way to get these to setup.\n\nIf it works, great! Send us a PR and we'd love to merge it in and highlight it as a working integration on our [Common Services page](https://partytown.qwik.dev/common-services) . If for any reason it does not work, we would love to help you figure out why it might not be working and figure out a way forward.\n\n## Manual Testing\n\nTests to be manually ran on a browser are located in the `tests` directory. These pages can help to test out DOM apis and individual services.\n\n```\nnpm run serve\n```\n\nhttp://localhost:4000/tests/\n\n## E2E Testing\n\nE2E tests use [@playwright/test](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro#writing-assertions), which allows us to test on Chromium, Firefox and WebKit browsers. These pages are also tested on every commit within the project's [CI Workflow](https://github.com/BuilderIO/partytown/actions/workflows/ci.yml).\n\n```\nnpm test\n```\n\n[CI Test Results](https://github.com/BuilderIO/partytown/actions/workflows/ci.yml)\n\n## Deployed Tests\n\nThe same pages found in `tests` are deployed to:\n\nhttps://partytown.qwik.dev/\n\n\n## Contributing a Pull Request (PR)? Please add a changeset\n\n\nFor your convenience, we prepared a video tutorial that covers the process of adding a changeset:\n\n[📽 TUTORIAL: Adding a changeset](https://go.screenpal.com/watch/cZivIcVPJQV)\n\n**1.** Run the following command to create a changeset:\n\n```shell\npnpm change\n```\n\n**2.** Choose the packages that should be included in the changeset\n\n**3** Choose the specific type of change\n\n(hit `Enter` if you need to skip to the next option)\n\n- `major` for breaking changes\n- `minor` for new features\n- `patch` for bug fixes\n\n**4.** Prefix your change title with one of these:\n\n- `FEAT:` or `feat:` for features\n- `FIX:` or `fix:` for bug fixes\n- `DOCS` or `docs:` for documentation\n\n**5.** Modify the created MD file\n\nAfter the `change` command runs, a new MD file will be created under the `.changeset` folder.\n\nPlease modify this file to include a descriptive message of the changes you made.\n\nYou can even add code examples if you need do, to describe a new feature for example. (pun intended 😉)\n\nThe prefix and this elaborated description will be used to create the changelog files and release notes, so please give them love. 💗😊\n\n---\n\n#### ❓ \"What if my PR is not a significant change?\"\n\nIf you made small changes like fixing typos, CI config, prettier, etc, you can run `pnpm change add --empty` to generate an empty changeset file to document\nyour changes.\n\n---\n\n## Publishing\n\n```\nnpm run release\n```\n"

Its goal is to help speed up sites by dedicating the main thread to your code, and offloading third-party scripts to a web worker.\n\n> Note: Partytown is still in beta and not guaranteed to work in every scenario. Please see our [FAQ](https://partytown.qwik.dev/faq) and [Trade-Off](https://partytown.qwik.dev/trade-offs) sections for more info.\n\nThe philosophy is that the main thread should be dedicated to your code, and any scripts that are not required to be in the [critical path](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path) should be moved to a web worker. Main thread performance is, without question, more important than web worker thread performance.\n\n- [Getting Started](https://partytown.qwik.dev/getting-started)\n- [Integrations](https://partytown.qwik.dev/integrations)\n- [Configuration](https://partytown.qwik.dev/configuration)\n- [Releases](https://github.com/BuilderIO/partytown/releases)\n- [FAQs](https://partytown.qwik.dev/faq)\n\n![Without Partytown and With Partytown: Your code and third-party code compete for main thread resources](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/452425/152393346-6f721a4f-3f66-410a-8878-a2b49e24307f.png)\n\n## Community\n\n- [@QwikDev](https://twitter.com/QwikDev)\n- [@Builderio](https://twitter.com/builderio)\n- [Local Development](https://github.com/BuilderIO/partytown/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#local-development)\n- [For Plugin Authors / Developers](https://github.com/BuilderIO/partytown/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#plugin-authors-developers)\n\n## Related Projects\n\n- [Qwik](https://github.com/BuilderIO/qwik): An open-source framework designed for best possible time to interactive, by focusing on resumability of server-side-rendering of HTML, and fine-grained lazy-loading of code.\n- [Mitosis](https://github.com/BuilderIO/mitosis): Write components once, run everywhere.
