          "content": "# Monaspace\n\nThe Monaspace type system is a monospaced type superfamily with some modern tricks up its sleeve. It consists of five variable axis typefaces. Each one has a distinct voice, but they are all metrics-compatible with one another, allowing you to mix and match them for a more expressive typographical palette.\n\nLetters on a grid is how we see our code. Why not make those letters better?\n\nâœ¨ An exploration from [GitHub Next](https://githubnext.com). âœ¨ See the full story of Monaspace at [monaspace.githubnext.com](https://monaspace.githubnext.com).\n\nðŸ”¤ **[Download the latest release](https://github.com/githubnext/monaspace/releases/latest)** ðŸ”¤\n\n![image](https://github.com/githubnext/monaspace/assets/22723/301020e0-f138-44af-abb1-48efa610be08)\n\n\n## Overview\n\nMonaspace is five interchangable type families, each of which is packaged into three distinct formats. You can install all of them side-by-side; their family names are distinct by family and format. For example:\n\n- `Monaspace _____`: the static family.\n- `Monaspace _____ Var` or `VF`: the variable family\n- `Monaspace _____ Frozen`: the \"frozen\" TTF family. These fonts enable all of the typographical features in Monaspace by default. They are intended to be used in environments where you might not be able to configure stylistic sets or character variants, like XCode or IntelliJ IDEs. See more about how the frozen fonts work below.\n\nThe variable fonts have one file per family (Neon, Argon, etc.). Modern and convenient!\n\nThe static fonts have one file per cut, per family. The variable axes have named stops for each axis, like `light` or `bold` for weight, `italic` for italics, and `semiwide` or `wide` for width. The combinatorial explosion of all these properties means the complete installation of static fonts involves hundreds of font files. But for situations that don't yet support variable fonts, the static builds give you a wide variety of stops throughout the range of each axis.\n\n## Texture Healing\n\nMonaspace pioneered the technique of \"texture healing\" for monospaced fonts: \n\n![Texture Healing Example](<docs/images/ReadmeTextureHealing.png>)\n\nTexture healing is enabled when the `calt` font feature setting is turned on in your editor. The location for this setting varies across applications, and not all applications support it. See the [Editors](#editors) section below for specific guidance.\n\nYou can read more about how it works on the [Monaspace website](http://monaspace.githubnext.com), and learn how it is implemented in the [documentation](https://github.com/githubnext/monaspace/blob/main/docs/Texture%20Healing.md).\n\n## Nerd Fonts\n\nAs of Monaspace 1.2, the static font builds (both OTF and WOFF/WOFF2) include [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/)!\n\nMonaspace gives a lot of consideration to horizontal and vertical metrics of a font, and Nerd Fonts are thousands of icons which don't necessarily respect those considerations. Monaspace makes a best-effort attempt to optically align the size and placement of the icons so that they feel compatible with the other Monaspace glyphs.\n\nThere is such a broad variety of environments and terminals and often solving for one breaks another! Some Nerd Fonts glyphs may not render correctly in every environment.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Monaspace uses the [Nerd Fonts implementation from Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code/tree/main/sources/nerdfonts/full/processed) as our starting point. Each icon was resized to fit the max advance width of the given Monaspace font, and centered vertically between the baseline and cap height of Monaspace's vertical metrics.\n\n\n## Coding Ligatures\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Ligature handling has changed significantly in Monaspace point releases.\n> If you're upgrading, check the release notes to learn what changes you might need to make to your editor configuration:\n> - [v1.1](https://github.com/githubnext/monaspace/releases/tag/v1.100)\n> - [v1.101](https://github.com/githubnext/monaspace/releases/tag/v1.101)\n> - [v1.2](https://github.com/githubnext/monaspace/releases/tag/v1.200)\n\n\nThe `liga` font feature enables customized spacing of repeating characters, like `///` or `||`. It is designed to avoid activating inside longer sequences like `////`.\n\nThere are ten groups of coding ligatures, separated into stylistic sets. You may be able to enable or disable individual sets selectively:\n\n* `ss01`: ligatures related to the equals glyph like `!=` and `===`.\n* `ss02`: ligatures for greater/less or equal (`<=`, `>=`).\n* `ss03`: ligatures related to arrows like `->` and `~>`.\n* `ss04`: ligatures related to markup, like `</` and `/>`. \n* `ss05`: ligatures related to the F# programming language, like `|>`.\n* `ss06`: ligatures related to repeated uses of `#`, `+`, and `&`.\n* `ss07`: ligatures related to colons like `::` or `=:=`.\n* `ss08`: ligatures related to combinations of periods with other glyphs like `..=` or `.-`.\n* `ss09`: ligatures related to combinations of the greater/less than and equals signs, like  `<=>`,`>>`, and `=<<`.\n* `ss10`: other tags, like `#[` and `#(`\n\nðŸ‘‰ You can see an interactive display of all the ligatures [on the Monaspace website](http://monaspace.githubnext.com/#code-ligatures)\n\n## Character Variants\n\nSpecific characters have variants that you can optionally enable using the `cvNN` opentype feature:\n\n#### cv01-cv09: figure variants\n- `cv01`: `0` alternates\n  - 1: plain\n  - 2: slash\n  - 3: reverse slash\n  - 4: cut-out slash\n- `cv02`: `1` alternate (no serif)\n\n#### cv10-cv29: letter variants\n- `cv10`: `l` `i` alternates (Neon, Argon, Xenon, Radon)\n- `cv11`: `j` `f` `r` `t` alternates (Neon, Argon)\n\n#### cv30-cv59: symbol variants\n- `cv30`: `*` vertically aligned closer to the top of the space, similar to how the asterisk was in Monaspace 1.0\n- `cv31`: `*` 6-pointed asterisk\n- `cv32`: `â‰¥` `â‰¤` angled lower line\n\n#### cv60-cv79: optional ligatures\n- `cv60`: forces the `<=` pair to render in a fashion that matches `=>` instead of swapping for `â‰¤`.\n- `cv61`: enables the optional closed square ligature for `[]`. This can be distracting when authoring arrays in many editors, because they automatically insert the closing bracket, which immediately produces the closed square ligature upon typing the open bracket.\n- `cv62`: `@_` ligature\n\n\n### cv80-cv99: reserved for future use\n- none (yet!)\n\n## Special Characters Galore\n\nIn addition to the ligatures, character variants, and Nerd Fonts, Monaspace includes a wealth of special characters.\n\n![Special Characters](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c925585b-db09-45e2-ac75-911e89419a47)\n\n## Desktop Installation\n\n### Upgrading\n\nFont caching on operating systems is an inscrutable mess dating back thirty years, and not something we can fix in Monaspace. Generally speaking, you should:\n\n- First delete the old fontsâ€¦\n- Then install the new fontsâ€¦\n- Then restart applications that use the fontsâ€¦\n- â€¦ and maybe restart your entire computer. \n\nRestarting is usually the only way to be 100% sure that the underlying machinery in the operating system picks up the new fonts.\n\n### MacOS\nYou can manually drag the fonts from the `fonts/otf`, `fonts/variable`, and `fonts/frozen` directories into Font Book.\n\nThere is also a script that automates the deletion of all Monaspace fonts from `~/Library/Fonts` and then copies over the latest versions. Invoke it from the root of the repo like:\n\n```bash\n$ bash util/install_macos.sh\n```\n\nYou can also use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) as an alternative:\n\n```bash\nbrew install --cask font-monaspace\n```\n\n### Windows\nYou can manually drag the fonts from the `fonts/otf`, `fonts/variable`, and `fonts/frozen` directories into `C:\\Windows\\Fonts`. Alternatively, right-click the fonts you want and click Install.\n\n### Linux\nYou can manually drag the fonts from the `fonts/otf`, `fonts/variable`, and `fonts/frozen` directories into `~/.local/share/fonts`.\n\nThere is also a script which automates the deletion of all Monaspace fonts from `~/.local/share/fonts` and then copies over the latest versions. Invoke it from the root of the repo like:\n\n```bash\n$ bash util/install_linux.sh\n```\n\n### Webfonts\n\nAll files with a `.woff` or `.woff2` suffix are intended for use on the web. You do not install them with your operating system but add them to your web development project.\n\nAs with the desktop fonts, they are available in variable and static versions.\n\nThe webfonts do not come in a \"frozen\" format; you can easily control Opentype features on the web using the [`font-feature-settings`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-feature-settings) CSS property.\n\n## Editors\n\n### Visual Studio Code\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Ligature handling has changed significantly in Monaspace point releases.\n> If you're upgrading, check the release notes to learn what changes you might need to make to your editor configuration:\n> - [v1.1](https://github.com/githubnext/monaspace/releases/tag/v1.100)\n> - [v1.101](https://github.com/githubnext/monaspace/releases/tag/v1.101)\n> - [v1.2](https://github.com/githubnext/monaspace/releases/tag/v1.200)\n\nSet the font family:\n\n```json\n    \"editor.fontFamily\": \"'Monaspace Neon', monospace\",\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Variable fonts are not yet well-supported in VS Code, and it is not yet possible to mix multiple fonts. Stay tuned, we're talking with the VS Code team about it!\n\nYou must use the `editor.fontLigatures` setting to enable the various features (texture healing, ligatures, and character variants). The setting is a comma-separated list of font features to be enabled.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> This setting is unavailable from the graphical settings editor; you must create it manually.\n\n- `calt`: enables texture healing\n- `liga`: enables dynamic spacing for certain repeating character patterns like `///`\n- `ss01`, `ss02`, etc: enables the specific stylistic set\n- `cv30`, `cv60`, etc: enables the specific character variants\n\nPutting it all together, a setting string which enables everything but the character variants would look like this:\n```json\n  \"editor.fontLigatures\": \"'calt', 'liga', 'ss01', 'ss02', 'ss03', 'ss04', 'ss05', 'ss06', 'ss07', 'ss08', 'ss09'\"\n```\n\nSpecific character variants are also enabled using the [`font-feature-settings`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-feature-settings) syntax. To enable slashed zeroes (with `cv01`) and six-pointed asterisks (with `cv31`), you might use the following settings:\n```json\n  \"editor.fontLigatures\": \"'calt', 'liga', 'ss01', 'cv01' 2, 'cv31' 1\"\n```\n\nNote that some character variants have several possible values. For any variants that are either on or off, setting them to `1` should enable them, and omitting the variant (or setting them to `0`) will disable them.\n\n## Contribution\n\nThere's no formal contribution guide yet! If you're interested in contributing to the typefaces, you should read the [Texture Healing](https://github.com/githubnext/monaspace/blob/main/docs/Texture%20Healing.md) guide, as it explains how to produce the necessary alternate glyphs.\n\n### Renamer utility\n\nThis convenience utility renames and moves the built fonts into their respective directories. You will need [Deno](https://deno.land) installed, and invoke it thus:\n\n```bash\n$ ./util/renamer.ts --src=\"~/path/to/the/built/fonts\"\n```\n\n## License\n\nSIL OFL. See [LICENSE](https://github.com/githubnext/monaspace/blob/main/LICENSE).\n\n## Support\n\nPlease file issues in this repo. Monaspace is not a supported product; do not contact GitHub support with questions, as they do not support GitHub Next explorations.\n\n## Contributors\n\nMonaspace was made to improve all code for all developers. [GitHub Next](https://githubnext.com) set out on this journey in 2022, and we were fortunate to find a type foundry that shares our passion for improving software in [Lettermatic](https://lettermatic.com/). The result is a marriage of form and function that opens the door to new developer experiences, and that would not have been possible without the domain expertise and skill of the Lettermatic team and the time they invested in working with GitHub Next on figuring out how typography ought to work for code.\n\n\n#### Lettermatic\n\n![lettermatic logo](https://github.com/githubnext/monaspace/assets/22723/36280a3a-ed6f-45a9-8e74-44c9d005794d)\n\n- [Riley Cran](https://github.com/rileycran)\n- Danelle Cheney\n- Heather Cran\n\n#### GitHub Next\n\n![GitHub Next Logo](https://github.com/githubnext/monaspace/assets/22723/744f8ba3-6dd7-4c67-b7e3-8e7d408d9dd9)\n\n- [Cole Bemis](https://github.com/colebemis)\n- [Amelia Wattenberger](https://github.com/wattenberger)\n- [Krzysztof CieÅ›lak](https://github.com/krzysztof-cieslak)\n- [Idan Gazit](https://github.com/idan)\n\n#### Special Thanks To\n- Anna Thomas\n- Marg Chronister\n- Jane Solomon\n\n\n## Star History\n\n[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=githubnext/monaspace&type=Date)](https://star-history.com/#githubnext/monaspace&Date)\n"
