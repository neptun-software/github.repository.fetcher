Tell your friends, co-workers, family, neighbors, followers, etc.\n1. Speak about it in meetups and conferences. (if you need help with the presentation, please ask on Discord!).\n\nThere is no company behind this organization and project. We do this in our free time and cannot advertise it\nall by ourselves. Companies have dedicated devrel teams doing all that work, other projects might have community\nmanagers or full-time developers with the capacity to also handle social media and meetups with higher frequency.\n\nMore people using Kysely eventually means:\n\n1. less bugs left unreported and unsolved.\n1. high chance people share workarounds.\n1. more data points for innovation.\n1. more people who might contribute and push this thing even further.\n1. it becomes a standard part of the Node.js/Bun/Deno developer's toolbox so you'll happily stumble upon it\n   in future codebases you'll join, or it'll be easier to get buy-in from co-workers/leadership.\n\n## 🤝 By Helping People in Issues or on Discord\n\nWe need all the help we can get with supporting the community, answering questions, triaging! \n\nIf you've been using the library for a while, or know a thing or two about SQL, and specific databases, don't \nbe shy about it!\n\n## 🐛 By Submitting Issues (Bugs, Enhancement Ideas, Questions) or Opening threads on Discord\n\nPlease use search and make sure an existing **open** issue or thread doesn't exist before submitting. If an existing\nissue is only somewhat relevant, please submit a new issue and reference the old one instead of commenting\non the existing one. Let us label your new issue as `duplicate` if it is the same thing - it's fine! If it's not \nthe same thing and you commented on another issue, it makes it harder to track on our end.\n\nIf possible/relevant, please provide a [playground link](https://kyse.link), Stackblitz OR a public git repository that \nreproduces the issue.\n\nPlease provide the exact error/warning texts you're getting. \"this doesn't work\" or \"this throws an error\"\nare not helping us help you.\n\nDon't be an asshole. Don't demand support/service from us.\n\n## ⌨️ With Code!\n\n### 📘 Documentation Code Contributions\n\nPull requests are always welcome! \n\nThe [kysely.dev](https://kysely.dev) application is located @ [/site](https://github.com/kysely-org/kysely/tree/master/site).\n\nIt is a pretty standard [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) application.\n\nThe code examples are extracted, using a custom script (see `\"script:generate-site-examples\"` @ [package.json](https://github.com/kysely-org/kysely/blob/master/package.json)), \nand custom annotations, from [JSDocs](https://jsdoc.app/) comments in the source code @ [/src](https://github.com/kysely-org/kysely/tree/master/src).\nIf you need to change an existing code example, please do so in the source code AND then run the script.\n_TODO: explain how to add a new code example._\n\nIf it is a big change (lots of lines of code OR files involved), please get a conversation going on an issue or on \nDiscord before starting work on it.\n\n### 🧙 Implementation Code Contributions (Bugfixes, Enhancements [Existing or New Features])\n\nPull requests (PRs) are welcome, BUT since:\n\n1. Our time and capacity as maintainers are limited.\n1. Your time is limited.\n1. Your motivation and morale is important to us.\n1. Onboarding in a new highly opinionated open-source project can be challenging.\n\nWe need a process in place:\n\n1. To make sure only things that have a good chance of being accepted are worked on. We hate saying \"no\".\n1. To make sure that things that are being worked on don't result in too much back-and-forth between authors and maintainers.\n   We hate seeing these things drag on for a long time, and we know how frustrating it is on your end.\n1. To make sure there's no pressure on you when you take on a task.\n1. To make sure there's a clear understanding of who is working on what to avoid redundancies and conflicts.\n\n#### The Process\n\nHere is the gist of it:\n\n1. If an issue on the subject **doesn't exist** yet, **submit** one. If you want to work on it, **ask** to be **assigned**\n   to it in the issue **description**, in the **comments**, OR on **Discord**.\n1. If an issue on the subject **exists** and is labeled with `bug` OR (`enhancement` AND `greenlit`\\* OR even `good first issue`\\**):\n   1. If there is a pull request (**PR**) **linked** to it:\n      1. If the **PR** is **stale** (a few months without new commits or comments from the PR author OR Kysely maintainers),\n         **ask** to be **assigned** to it and continue work on the PR.\n      1. If the **PR** is **not stale**, you can still offer some review comments, or **ask** to **pair** up with the PR author.\n   1. If there is **no PR linked** to it and a person is **already assigned** to it:\n      1. If the assignment is stale (a few weeks without a PR opened after the person was assigned to the issue), ask\n         to be assigned to the issue in the comments OR on Discord.\n      1. If the assignment is not stale, it's OK to ask the assignee if they'll be willing to pair up.\n   1. If there is no PR linked to it and no assignee, ask to be assigned to it in the comments OR on Discord.\n   \n_\\* an issue that was reviewed by the maintainers and would be nice to get a pull request for from the community._\n\n_\\** an issue that was reviewed by the maintainers and would be a nice opportunity to onboard an open-source newbie\n  into the codebase._\n\nOnce you're assigned to an issue, you can start working on your code changes. It's best to ask questions\nin the issue or on Discord as early as possible, and even share your progress with the maintainers and community via a \ndraft (WIP) pull request.\n\n#### Style/Design Philosophy\n\n* Kysely should have zero dependencies.\n\n* Kysely should work in all JavaScript environments (node.js, deno & modern browsers), \neven though the main focus is node.js.\n\n* Everything is immutable.\n\n* The API should be as close to writing raw SQL as possible while still providing \ntype safety.\n\n* Everything outside of dialect implementations is dialect-agnostic.\n\n* Everything is tested.\n\n    * Functionality - No mocks. Everything is tested against real database instances.\n    No partial testing. If a sql \"thing\" is supported by some databases, test it\n    against all of them.\n\n    * Types - We're a type-safe package, you get the idea.\n\n* Everything consumer-facing should be documented.\n\n* Everything is type-safe. Things that cannot be implemented in a way that is safe \nfor all cases, are best left for consumers to implement.\n\n* Most features should have escape hatches.\n\n#### Getting Started\n\n1. fork kysely.\n\n1. clone your fork.\n\n1. install node.js (preferably the latest even-numbered version).\n\n1. run `npm i` in your terminal to install dependencies.\n\n1. create a branch (we don't care about naming).\n\n1. create a draft pull request. link the relevant issue by referring to it in the \nPR's description. E.g. `closes #123` will link the PR to issue/pull request #123.\n\n1. implement your changes.\n\n#### Testing\n\n1. write functionality tests @ [/test/node](https://github.com/kysely-org/kysely/tree/master/test/node).\n\n1. write typings tests @ [/test/typings](https://github.com/kysely-org/kysely/tree/master/test/typings)\n\n1. install docker.\n\n1. run `docker-compose up` in your terminal to spin up database instances.\n\n1. run `npm test` in another terminal to run tests.\n"

Mainly developed for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) but also\nruns on all other [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) environments like [Deno](https://deno.com/), [Bun](https://bun.sh/), [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/)\nand web browsers.\n\n![](https://github.com/kysely-org/kysely/blob/master/assets/demo.gif)\n\nKysely makes sure you only refer to tables and columns that are visible to the part of the query\nyou're writing. The result type only has the selected columns with correct types and aliases. As an\nadded bonus you get autocompletion for all that stuff.\n\nAs shown in the gif above, through the pure magic of modern TypeScript, Kysely is even able to parse\nthe alias given to `pet.name` and add the `pet_name` column to the result row type. Kysely is able to infer\ncolumn names, aliases and types from selected subqueries, joined subqueries, `with` statements and pretty\nmuch anything you can think of.\n\nOf course there are cases where things cannot be typed at compile time, and Kysely offers escape\nhatches for these situations. See the [sql template tag](https://kysely-org.github.io/kysely-apidoc/interfaces/Sql.html)\nand the [DynamicModule](https://kysely-org.github.io/kysely-apidoc/classes/DynamicModule.html#ref) for more info.\n\nAll API documentation is written in the typing files and you can simply hover over the module, class\nor method you're using to see it in your IDE. The same documentation is also hosted [here](https://kysely-org.github.io/kysely-apidoc/).\n\nIf you start using Kysely and can't find something you'd want to use, please open an issue or join our\n[Discord server](https://discord.gg/xyBJ3GwvAm).\n\n# Getting started\n\nPlease visit our documentation site [kysely.dev](https://kysely.dev) to get started. We also have a comprehensive\nAPI documentation hosted [here](https://kysely-org.github.io/kysely-apidoc/), but you can access the same\ndocumentation in your IDE by hovering over a class/method/property/whatever.\n\n# Contributors\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <a href=\"https://github.com/kysely-org/kysely/graphs/contributors\">\n        <img src=\"https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=kysely-org/kysely\" />\n    </a>\n    </br>\n    <span>Want to contribute?
