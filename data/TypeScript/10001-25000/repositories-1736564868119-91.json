ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION\n    OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n\n1. DEFINITIONS\n\n\"Contribution\" means:\n\n  a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content\n     Distributed under this Agreement, and\n\n  b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\n     i) changes to the Program, and\n     ii) additions to the Program;\n  where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from\n  and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution\n  \"originates\" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by\n  such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.\n  Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that\n  are not Modified Works.\n\n\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.\n\n\"Licensed Patents\" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which\nare necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone\nor when combined with the Program.\n\n\"Program\" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this\nAgreement.\n\n\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement\nor any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.\n\n\"Derivative Works\" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other\nform, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the\neditorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\nrepresent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.\n\n\"Modified Works\" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that\nresults from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the\ncontents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file\nin Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified\nWorks shall not include works that contain only declarations,\ninterfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely\nin each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program\nor Modified Works thereof.\n\n\"Distribute\" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available\nin any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.\n\n\"Source Code\" means the form of a Program preferred for making\nmodifications, including but not limited to software source code,\ndocumentation source, and configuration files.\n\n\"Secondary License\" means either the GNU General Public License,\nVersion 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any\nexceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial\nContributor.\n\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\n  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n  grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright\n  license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,\n  publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such\n  Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.\n\n  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n  grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent\n  license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,\n  import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,\n  if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall\n  apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at\n  the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition\n  of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\n  Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other\n  combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is\n  licensed hereunder.\n\n  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\n  licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\n  provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\n  patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.\n  Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims\n  brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual\n  property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the\n  rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby\n  assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual\n  property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party\n  patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the\n  Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\n  before distributing the Program.\n\n  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has\n  sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant\n  the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\n\n  e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no\n  Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than\n  those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's\n  receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License\n  (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).\n\n3. REQUIREMENTS\n\n3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:\n\n  a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in\n  accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany\n  the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program\n  is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to\n  obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily\n  used for software exchange; and\n\n  b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license\n  different than this Agreement, provided that such license:\n     i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all\n     warranties and conditions, express and implied, including\n     warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and\n     implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness\n     for a particular purpose;\n\n     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all\n     liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,\n     incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n\n     iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights\n     in the Source Code under section 3.2; and\n\n     iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any\n     party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements\n     of this section 3.\n\n3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:\n\n  a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the\n  Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or\n  files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial\n  Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in\n  Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available\n  under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and\n\n  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of\n  the Program.\n\n3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,\ntrademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations\nof liability (\"notices\") contained within the Program from any copy of\nthe Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add\ntheir own appropriate notices.\n\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities\nwith respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this\nlicense is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,\nthe Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product\noffering should do so in a manner which does not create potential\nliability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes\nthe Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor\n(\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every\nother Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses,\ndamages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits\nand other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified\nContributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such\nCommercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program\nin a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not\napply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged\nintellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified\nContributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in\nwriting of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,\nand cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any\nrelated settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may\nparticipate in any such claim at its own expense.\n\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\nproduct offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\nContributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\nclaims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\nclaims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility\nalone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to\ndefend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance\nclaims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to\npay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay\nthose damages.\n\n5. NO WARRANTY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\nPERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\"\nBASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF\nTITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the\nappropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all\nrisks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,\nincluding but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,\ncompliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs\nor equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\nPERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS\nSHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,\nEXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\nPROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN\nCONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)\nARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE\nEXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. GENERAL\n\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\napplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\nthe remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further\naction by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the\nminimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the\nProgram itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software\nor hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's\nrights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such\nlitigation is filed.\n\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it\nfails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this\nAgreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of\ntime after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's\nrights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use\nand distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.\nHowever, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses\ngranted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,\nbut in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and\nmay only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward\nreserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of\nthis Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement\nSteward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation\nis the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the\nresponsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate\nentity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing\nversion number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be\nDistributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was\nreceived. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,\nContributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its\nContributions) under the new version.\n\nExcept as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient\nreceives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any\nContributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,\nestoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted\nunder this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended\nto be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.\nNo third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.\n\nExhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice\n\n\"This Source Code may also be made available under the following\nSecondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth\nin the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),\nversion(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}.\"\n\n  Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A\n  is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.\n\n  If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular\n  file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE\n  file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to\n  look for such a notice.\n\n  You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.\n"

Star us on GitHub!\n\n## About\n\nThe Huly Platform is a robust framework designed to accelerate the development of business applications, such as CRM systems. \nThis repository includes several applications, such as Chat, Project Management, CRM, HRM, and ATS. \nVarious teams are building products on top of the Platform, including [Huly](https://huly.io) and [TraceX](https://tracex.co).\n\n![Huly](https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/392073243/6d27d5cc-38cd-4d88-affe-bb88b393180c)\n\n## Self-Hosting\n\nIf you're primarily interested in self-hosting Huly without the intention to modify or contribute to its development, please use [huly-selfhost](https://github.com/hcengineering/huly-selfhost). \nThis project offers a convenient method to host Huly using `docker`, designed for ease of use and quick setup. Explore this option to effortlessly enjoy Huly on your own server.\n\n## Activity\n\n![Alt](https://repobeats.axiom.co/api/embed/c42c99e21691fa60ea61b5cdf11c2e0647621534.svg \"Repobeats analytics image\")\n\n## Table of Content\n\n- [Huly Platform](#huly-platform)\n  - [About](#about)\n  - [Self-Hosting](#self-hosting)\n  - [Activity](#activity)\n  - [Table of Content](#table-of-content)\n  - [Pre-requisites](#pre-requisites)\n  - [Verification](#verification)\n  - [Installation](#installation)\n  - [Build and run](#build-and-run)\n  - [Run in development mode](#run-in-development-mode)\n  - [Update project structure and database](#update-project-structure-and-database)\n  - [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)\n  - [Build \\& Watch](#build--watch)\n  - [Tests](#tests)\n    - [Unit tests](#unit-tests)\n    - [UI tests](#ui-tests)\n  - [Package publishing](#package-publishing)\n  - [Additional testing](#additional-testing)\n\n## Pre-requisites\n\n- Before proceeding, ensure that your system meets the following requirements:\n  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v20.11.0 is required)\n  - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)\n  - [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)\n\n## Verification\n\nTo verify the installation, perform the following checks in your terminal:\n\n- Ensure that the `docker` commands are available:\n  ```bash\n  docker --version\n  docker compose version\n## Fast start\n\n```bash\nsh ./scripts/fast-start.sh\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nYou need Microsoft's [rush](https://rushjs.io) to install application.\n\n1. Install Rush globally using the command:\n   ```bash\n   npm install -g @microsoft/rush\n2. Navigate to the repository root and run the following commands:\n   ```bash\n   rush install\n   rush build\nAlternatively, you can just execute:\n\n```bash\nsh ./scripts/presetup-rush.sh\n```\n\n## Build and run\n\nDevelopment environment setup requires Docker to be installed on system.\n\nSupport is available for both amd64 and arm64 containers on Linux and macOS.\n\n```bash\ncd ./dev/\nrush build    # Will build all the required packages. \n# rush rebuild  # could be used to omit build cache.\nrush bundle   # Will prepare bundles.\nrush package  # Will build all webpack packages.\nrush validate # Will validate all sources with typescript and generate d.ts files required for ts-node execution.\nrush svelte-check # Optional. svelte files validation using svelte-check.\nrush docker:build   # Will build Docker containers for all applications in the local Docker environment.\nrush docker:up # Will set up all the containers\n```\n\nBe aware `rush docker:build` will automatically execute all required phases like build, bundle, package.\n\nAlternatively, you can just execute:\n\n```bash\nsh ./scripts/build.sh\n```\n\nBy default, Docker volumes named dev_db, dev_elastic, and dev_files will be created for the MongoDB, Elasticsearch, and MinIO instances.\n\nBefore you can begin, you need to create a workspace and an account and associate it with the workspace.\n\n```bash\ncd ./tool # dev/tool in the repository root\nrushx run-local create-workspace ws1 -w DevWorkspace # Create workspace\nrushx run-local create-account user1 -p 1234 -f John -l Appleseed # Create account\nrushx run-local configure ws1 --list --enable '*' # Enable all modules, even if they are not yet intended to be used by a wide audience.\nrushx run-local assign-workspace user1 ws1 # Assign workspace to user.\nrushx run-local confirm-email user1 # To allow the creation of additional test workspaces.\n\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can just execute:\n\n```bash\nsh ./scripts/create-workspace.sh\n```\n\nAdd the following line to your /etc/hosts file\n\n```\n127.0.0.1 host.docker.internal\n```\n\nAccessing the URL http://host.docker.internal:8087 will lead you to the app in development mode.\n\nLimitations:\n\n- Local installation does not support sending emails, thus disabling functionalities such as password recovery and email notifications.\n\n## Run in development mode\n\nDevelopment mode allows for live reloading and a smoother development process.\n\n```bash\ncd dev/prod\nrush validate\nrushx dev-server\n```\n\nThen go to http://localhost:8080\n\nClick on \"Login with password\" link on the bottom of the right panel and use the following login credentials:\n\n```plain\nEmail: user1\nPassword: 1234\nWorkspace: ws1\n```\n\n## Update project structure and database\n\nIf the project's structure is updated, it may be necessary to relink and rebuild the projects.\n\n```bash\nrush update\nrush build\n```\n\nIt may also be necessary to upgrade the running database.\n\n```bash\ncd ./dev/tool\nrushx upgrade -f\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf a build fails, but the code is correct, try to delete the [build cache](https://rushjs.io/pages/maintainer/build_cache/) and retry.\n\n```bash\n# from the project root\nrm -rf common/temp/build-cache\n```\n\n## Build & Watch\n\nFor development purpose `rush build:watch` action could be used.\n\nIt includes build and validate phases in watch mode.\n\n## Tests\n\n### Unit tests\n\n```bash\nrush test # To execute all tests\n\nrushx test # For individual test execution inside a package directory\n```\n\n### UI tests\n\n```bash\ncd ./tests\nrush build\nrush bundle\nrush docker:build\n## creates test Docker containers and sets up test database\n./prepare.sh\n## runs UI tests\nrushx uitest\n```\n\nTo execute tests in the development environment, please follow these steps:\n\n```bash\ncd ./tests\n./create-local.sh ## use ./restore-local.sh if you only want to restore the workspace to a predefined initial state for sanity.\ncd ./sanity\nrushx dev-uitest # To execute all tests against the development environment.\nrushx dev-debug -g 'pattern' # To execute tests in debug mode with only the matching test pattern.\n```\n\n## Package publishing\n\n```bash\nnode ./common/scripts/bump.js -p projectName\n```\n\n## Additional testing\n\nThis project is tested with BrowserStack.\n\n<sub><sup>&copy; 2024 <a href=\"https://hardcoreeng.com\">Hardcore Engineering Inc</a>.</sup></sub>\n\n"
