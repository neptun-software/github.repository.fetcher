Install the\nbeta channel to get access to early builds of Desktop:\n\n - [macOS](https://central.github.com/deployments/desktop/desktop/latest/darwin?env=beta)\n - [macOS (Apple silicon)](https://central.github.com/deployments/desktop/desktop/latest/darwin-arm64?env=beta)\n - [Windows](https://central.github.com/deployments/desktop/desktop/latest/win32?env=beta)\n - [Windows (ARM64)](https://central.github.com/deployments/desktop/desktop/latest/win32-arm64?env=beta)\n\nThe release notes for the latest beta versions are available [here](https://desktop.github.com/release-notes/?env=beta).\n\n### Past Releases\nYou can find past releases at https://desktop.githubusercontent.com. After installation of a past version, the auto update functionality will attempt to download the latest version. \n\n### Community Releases\n\nThere are several community-supported package managers that can be used to\ninstall GitHub Desktop:\n - Windows users can install using [winget](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/) `c:\\> winget install github-desktop` or [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) `c:\\> choco install github-desktop`\n - macOS users can install using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager:\n      `$ brew install --cask github`\n\nInstallers for various Linux distributions can be found on the\n[`shiftkey/desktop`](https://github.com/shiftkey/desktop) fork.\n\n## Is GitHub Desktop right for me? What are the primary areas of focus?\n\n[This document](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/blob/development/docs/process/what-is-desktop.md) describes the focus of GitHub Desktop and who the product is most useful for.\n\n## I have a problem with GitHub Desktop\n\nNote: The [GitHub Desktop Code of Conduct](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/blob/development/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) applies in all interactions relating to the GitHub Desktop project.\n\nFirst, please search the [open issues](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/issues?q=is%3Aopen)\nand [closed issues](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/issues?q=is%3Aclosed)\nto see if your issue hasn't already been reported (it may also be fixed).\n\nThere is also a list of [known issues](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/blob/development/docs/known-issues.md)\nthat are being tracked against Desktop, and some of these issues have workarounds.\n\nIf you can't find an issue that matches what you're seeing, open a [new issue](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/issues/new/choose),\nchoose the right template and provide us with enough information to investigate\nfurther.\n\n## The issue I reported isn't fixed yet. What can I do?\n\nIf nobody has responded to your issue in a few days, you're welcome to respond to it with a friendly ping in the issue. Please do not respond more than a second time if nobody has responded. The GitHub Desktop maintainers are constrained in time and resources, and diagnosing individual configurations can be difficult and time consuming. While we'll try to at least get you pointed in the right direction, we can't guarantee we'll be able to dig too deeply into any one person's issue.\n\n## How can I contribute to GitHub Desktop?\n\nThe [CONTRIBUTING.md](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) document will help you get setup and\nfamiliar with the source. The [documentation](docs/) folder also contains more\nresources relevant to the project.\n\nIf you're looking for something to work on, check out the [help wanted](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help%20wanted%22) label.\n\n## Building Desktop\n\nTo setup your development environment for building Desktop, check out: [`setup.md`](./docs/contributing/setup.md).\n\n## More Resources\n\nSee [desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com) for more product-oriented\ninformation about GitHub Desktop.\n\nSee our [getting started documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop) for more information on how to set up, authenticate, and configure GitHub Desktop.\n\n## License\n\n**[MIT](LICENSE)**\n\nThe MIT license grant is not for GitHub's trademarks, which include the logo\ndesigns.
