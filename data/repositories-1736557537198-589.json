The Barcode Scanner app can\nno longer be published, so it's unlikely any changes will be accepted for it. \nIt does not work with Android 14 and will not be updated. Please don't file an issue for it.\nThere is otherwise no active development or roadmap for this project. It is \"DIY\".\n\n## Get Started Developing\n\nTo get started, please visit: https://github.com/zxing/zxing/wiki/Getting-Started-Developing\n\nZXing (\"zebra crossing\") is an open-source, multi-format 1D/2D barcode image processing\nlibrary implemented in Java, with ports to other languages.\n\n## Supported Formats\n\n| 1D product            | 1D industrial | 2D
