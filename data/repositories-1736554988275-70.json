We love all the free services out there, but it would be good to keep it on topic. It's a grey line sometimes, so this is opinionated; please don't feel offended if I don't accept your contribution.\n\nThis list results from Pull Requests, reviews, ideas, and work done by 1600+ people. You can also help by sending [Pull Requests](https://github.com/ripienaar/free-for-dev) to add more services or remove ones whose offerings have changed or been retired.\n\n[![Track Awesome List](https://www.trackawesomelist.com/badge.svg)](https://www.trackawesomelist.com/ripienaar/free-for-dev)\n\n**NOTE**: This list is only for as-a-Service offerings, not for self-hosted software. To be eligible, a service must offer a free tier, not just a free trial. The free tier must be for at least a year if it is time-bucketed. We also consider the free tier from a security perspective, so SSO is fine, but I will not accept services that restrict TLS to paid-only tiers.\n\n# Table of Contents\n\n  * [Major Cloud Providers' Always-Free Limits](#major-cloud-providers)\n  * [Cloud management solutions](#cloud-management-solutions)\n  * [Analytics, Events, and Statistics](#analytics-events-and-statistics)\n  * [APIs, Data and ML](#apis-data-and-ml)\n  * [Artifact Repos](#artifact-repos)\n  * [BaaS](#baas)\n  * [Low-code Platform](#low-code-platform)\n  * [CDN and Protection](#cdn-and-protection)\n  * [CI and CD](#ci-and-cd)\n  * [CMS](#cms)\n  * [Code Generation](#code-generation)\n  * [Code Quality](#code-quality)\n  * [Code Search and Browsing](#code-search-and-browsing)\n  * [Crash and Exception Handling](#crash-and-exception-handling)\n  * [Data Visualization on Maps](#data-visualization-on-maps)\n  * [Managed Data Services](#managed-data-services)\n  * [Design and UI](#design-and-ui)\n  * [Design Inspiration](#design-inspiration)\n  * [Dev Blogging Sites](#dev-blogging-sites)\n  * [DNS](#dns)\n  * [Docker Related](#docker-related)\n  * [Domain](#domain)\n  * [Education and Career Development](#education-and-career-development)\n  * [Email](#email)\n  * [Feature Toggles Management Platforms](#feature-toggles-management-platforms)\n  * [Font](#font)\n  * [Forms](#forms)\n  * [Generative AI](#generative-ai)\n  * [IaaS](#iaas)\n  * [IDE and Code Editing](#ide-and-code-editing)\n  * [International Mobile Number Verification API and SDK](#international-mobile-number-verification-api-and-sdk)\n  * [Issue Tracking and Project Management](#issue-tracking-and-project-management)\n  * [Log Management](#log-management)\n  * [Mobile App Distribution and Feedback](#mobile-app-distribution-and-feedback)\n  * [Management Systems](#management-system)\n  * [Messaging and Streaming](#messaging-and-streaming)\n  * [Miscellaneous](#miscellaneous)\n  * [Monitoring](#monitoring)\n  * [PaaS](#paas)\n  * [Package Build System](#package-build-system)\n  * [Payment and Billing Integration](#payment-and-billing-integration)\n  * [Privacy Management](#privacy-management)\n  * [Screenshot APIs](#screenshot-apis)\n  * [Flutter Related and Building IOS Apps without Mac](#flutter-related-and-building-ios-apps-without-mac)\n  * [Search](#search)\n  * [Security and PKI](#security-and-pki)\n  * [Authentication, Authorization, and User Management](#authentication-authorization-and-user-management)\n  * [Source Code Repos](#source-code-repos)\n  * [Storage and Media Processing](#storage-and-media-processing)\n  * [Tunneling, WebRTC, Web Socket Servers and Other Routers](#tunneling-webrtc-web-socket-servers-and-other-routers)\n  * [Testing](#testing)\n  * [Tools for Teams and Collaboration](#tools-for-teams-and-collaboration)\n  * [Translation Management](#translation-management)\n  * [Vagrant Related](#vagrant-related)\n  * [Visitor Session Recording](#visitor-session-recording)\n  * [Web Hosting](#web-hosting)\n  * [Commenting Platforms](#commenting-platforms)\n  * [Browser based hardware emulation](#browser-based-hardware-emulation-written-in-javascript)\n  * [Remote Desktop Tools](#remote-desktop-tools)\n  * [Game Development](#game-development)\n  * [Other Free Resources](#other-free-resources)\n\n## Major Cloud Providers\n\n  * [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com)\n    * App Engine - 28 frontend instance hours per day, nine backend instance hours per day\n    * Cloud Firestore - 1GB storage, 50,000 reads, 20,000 writes, 20,000 deletes per day\n    * Compute Engine - 1 non-preemptible e2-micro, 30GB HDD, 5GB snapshot storage (restricted to certain regions), 1 GB network egress from North America to all region destinations (excluding China and Australia) per month\n    * Cloud Storage - 5GB, 1GB network egress\n    * Cloud Shell - Web-based Linux shell/primary IDE with 5GB of persistent storage. 60 hours limit per week\n    * Cloud Pub/Sub - 10GB of messages per month\n    * Cloud Functions - 2 million invocations per month (includes both background and HTTP invocations)\n    * Cloud Run - 2 million requests per month, 360,000 GB-seconds memory, 180,000 vCPU-seconds of compute time, 1 GB network egress from North America per month\n    * Google Kubernetes Engine - No cluster management fee for one zonal cluster.
