Thanks **@jordddan** for his efforts. For the image editing case, `GroundingDINO` is first used to locate bounding boxes guided by given text, then `segment-anything` is used to generate the related mask, and finally stable diffusion inpainting is used to edit image based on the mask. \n    - Firstly, run `python visual_chatgpt.py --load \"Text2Box_cuda:0,Segmenting_cuda:0,Inpainting_cuda:0,ImageCaptioning_cuda:0\"`\n    - Then, say `find xxx in the image` or `segment xxx in the image`. `xxx` is an object. TaskMatrix will return the detection or segmentation result!\n\n\n- Now TaskMatrix can support Chinese! Thanks to **@Wang-Xiaodong1899** for his efforts.\n- We propose the **template** idea in TaskMatrix!\n    - A template is a **pre-defined execution flow** that assists ChatGPT in assembling complex tasks involving multiple foundation models. \n    - A template contains the **experiential solution** to complex tasks as determined by humans. \n    - A template can **invoke multiple foundation models** or even **establish a new ChatGPT session**\n    - To define a **template**, simply adding a class with attributes `template_model = True`\n- Thanks to **@ShengmingYin** and **@thebestannie** for providing a template example in `InfinityOutPainting` class (see the following gif)\n    - Firstly, run `python visual_chatgpt.py --load \"Inpainting_cuda:0,ImageCaptioning_cuda:0,VisualQuestionAnswering_cuda:0\"`\n    - Secondly, say `extend the image to 2048x1024` to TaskMatrix!\n    - By simply creating an `InfinityOutPainting` template, TaskMatrix can seamlessly extend images to any size through collaboration with existing `ImageCaptioning`, `Inpainting`, and `VisualQuestionAnswering` foundation models, **without the need for additional training**.\n- **TaskMatrix needs the effort of the community! We crave your contribution to add new and interesting features!**\n<img src=\"./assets/demo_inf.gif\" width=\"750\">\n\n\n## Insight & Goal:\nOn the one hand, **ChatGPT (or LLMs)** serves as a **general interface** that provides a broad and diverse understanding of a\nwide range of topics. On the other hand, **Foundation Models** serve as **domain experts** by providing deep knowledge in specific domains.\nBy leveraging **both general and deep knowledge**, we aim at building an AI that is capable of handling various tasks.\n\n\n## Demo \n<img src=\"./assets/demo_short.gif\" width=\"750\">\n\n##  System Architecture \n\n \n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"./assets/figure.jpg\" alt=\"Logo\"></p>\n\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```\n# clone the repo\ngit clone https://github.com/microsoft/TaskMatrix.git\n\n# Go to directory\ncd visual-chatgpt\n\n# create a new environment\nconda create -n visgpt python=3.8\n\n# activate the new environment\nconda activate visgpt\n\n#  prepare the basic environments\npip install -r requirements.txt\npip install  git+https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO.git\npip install  git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything.git\n\n# prepare your private OpenAI key (for Linux)\nexport OPENAI_API_KEY={Your_Private_Openai_Key}\n\n# prepare your private OpenAI key (for Windows)\nset OPENAI_API_KEY={Your_Private_Openai_Key}\n\n# Start TaskMatrix !\n# You can specify the GPU/CPU assignment by \"--load\", the parameter indicates which \n# Visual Foundation Model to use and where it will be loaded to\n# The model and device are separated by underline '_', the different models are separated by comma ','\n# The available Visual Foundation Models can be found in the following table\n# For example, if you want to load ImageCaptioning to cpu and Text2Image to cuda:0\n# You can use: \"ImageCaptioning_cpu,Text2Image_cuda:0\"\n\n# Advice for CPU Users\npython visual_chatgpt.py --load ImageCaptioning_cpu,Text2Image_cpu\n\n# Advice for 1 Tesla T4 15GB  (Google Colab)                       \npython visual_chatgpt.py --load \"ImageCaptioning_cuda:0,Text2Image_cuda:0\"\n                                \n# Advice for 4 Tesla V100 32GB                            \npython visual_chatgpt.py --load \"Text2Box_cuda:0,Segmenting_cuda:0,\n    Inpainting_cuda:0,ImageCaptioning_cuda:0,\n    Text2Image_cuda:1,Image2Canny_cpu,CannyText2Image_cuda:1,\n    Image2Depth_cpu,DepthText2Image_cuda:1,VisualQuestionAnswering_cuda:2,\n    InstructPix2Pix_cuda:2,Image2Scribble_cpu,ScribbleText2Image_cuda:2,\n    SegText2Image_cuda:2,Image2Pose_cpu,PoseText2Image_cuda:2,\n    Image2Hed_cpu,HedText2Image_cuda:3,Image2Normal_cpu,\n    NormalText2Image_cuda:3,Image2Line_cpu,LineText2Image_cuda:3\"\n\n```\n\n## GPU memory usage\nHere we list the GPU memory usage of each visual foundation model, you can specify which one you like:\n\n| Foundation Model        | GPU Memory (MB) |\n|------------------------|-----------------|\n| ImageEditing           | 3981            |\n| InstructPix2Pix        | 2827            |\n| Text2Image             | 3385            |\n| ImageCaptioning        | 1209            |\n| Image2Canny            | 0               |\n| CannyText2Image        | 3531            |\n| Image2Line             | 0               |\n| LineText2Image         | 3529            |\n| Image2Hed              | 0               |\n| HedText2Image          | 3529            |\n| Image2Scribble         | 0               |\n| ScribbleText2Image     | 3531            |\n| Image2Pose             | 0               |\n| PoseText2Image         | 3529            |\n| Image2Seg              | 919             |\n| SegText2Image          | 3529            |\n| Image2Depth            | 0               |\n| DepthText2Image        | 3531            |\n| Image2Normal           | 0               |\n| NormalText2Image       | 3529            |\n| VisualQuestionAnswering| 1495            |\n\n## Acknowledgement\nWe appreciate the open source of the following projects:\n\n[Hugging Face](https://github.com/huggingface) &#8194;\n[LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) &#8194;\n[Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion) &#8194; \n[ControlNet](https://github.com/lllyasviel/ControlNet) &#8194; \n[InstructPix2Pix](https://github.com/timothybrooks/instruct-pix2pix) &#8194; \n[CLIPSeg](https://github.com/timojl/clipseg) &#8194;\n[BLIP](https://github.com/salesforce/BLIP) &#8194;\n\n## Contact Information\nFor help or issues using the TaskMatrix, please submit a GitHub issue.\n\nFor other communications, please contact Chenfei WU (chewu@microsoft.com) or Nan DUAN (nanduan@microsoft.com).\n\n## Trademark Notice\n\nTrademarks This project may contain trademarks or logos for projects, products, or services.

Visual ChatGPT is able to generate human-like text based on the input it receives, allowing it to engage in natural-sounding conversations and provide responses that are coherent and relevant to the topic at hand.\n\nVisual ChatGPT is able to process and understand large amounts of text and images. As a language model, Visual ChatGPT can not directly read images, but it has a list of tools to finish different visual tasks. Each image will have a file name formed as \"image/xxx.png\", and Visual ChatGPT can invoke different tools to indirectly understand pictures. When talking about images, Visual ChatGPT is very strict to the file name and will never fabricate nonexistent files. When using tools to generate new image files, Visual ChatGPT is also known that the image may not be the same as the user's demand, and will use other visual question answering tools or description tools to observe the real image. Visual ChatGPT is able to use tools in a sequence, and is loyal to the tool observation outputs rather than faking the image content and image file name. It will remember to provide the file name from the last tool observation, if a new image is generated.\n\nHuman may provide new figures to Visual ChatGPT with a description. The description helps Visual ChatGPT to understand this image, but Visual ChatGPT should use tools to finish following tasks, rather than directly imagine from the description.\n\nOverall, Visual ChatGPT is a powerful visual dialogue assistant tool that can help with a wide range of tasks and provide valuable insights and information on a wide range of topics. \n\n\nTOOLS:\n------\n\nVisual ChatGPT  has access to the following tools:\"\"\"\n\nVISUAL_CHATGPT_FORMAT_INSTRUCTIONS = \"\"\"To use a tool, please use the following format:\n\n```\nThought: Do I need to use a tool?
