All issues associated with this milestone can be found using this [filter](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/milestone/93?closed=1).\n\n### Fixed\n- Runtime crash when calling `validate` from a Swift 6-compiled target.\n  - Fixed by [Jon Shier](https://github.com/jshier) in Pull Request [#3920](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/pull/3920).\n- Swift 6.0 `Package.swift` deprecation warning.\n  - Fixed by [Jon Shier](https://github.com/jshier) in Pull Request [#3911](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/pull/3911).\n\n## [5.10.1](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/releases/tag/5.10.1)\n\nReleased on 2024-10-19. All issues associated with this milestone can be found using this [filter](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/milestone/92?closed=1).\n\n### Fixed\n- `@Sendable` in `AdaptHandler` and `RetryHandler` types.\n  - Fixed by [Jon Shier](https://github.com/jshier) in Pull Request [#3906](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/pull/3906).\n- Downstream `JSONResponseSerializer` wrapper by reverting output type to just `Any`.\n  - Fixed by [Jon Shier](https://github.com/jshier) in Pull Request [#3903](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/pull/3903).\n- Missing `@Sendable` on `Authenticator.refresh`.\n  - Fixed by [rono23](https://github.com/rono23) in Pull Request [#3901](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/pull/3901).\n\n## [5.10.0](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/releases/tag/5.10.0)\n\nReleased on 2024-10-13. All issues associated with this milestone can be found using this [filter](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/milestone/91?closed=1).\n\n### Added\n- 🔥 Full Swift concurrency support with `Sendable` requirements. Most APIs are also marked `@preconcurrency`, so there should be no breaking changes. Swift 5.9 now required to build.\n  - Added by [Jon Shier](https://github.com/jshier) in Pull Request [#3880](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/pull/3880).\n- Existential `any` now required internally by Alamofire.\n  - Added by [Keita Watanabe](https://github.com/kitwtnb) in Pull Request [#3881](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/pull/3881).\n\n### Updated\n- 🔥 `Session.init(... eventMonitors:)` to allow no `EventMonitor`s at all, and `CompositeEventMonitor` to fix thread-safety. Potentially breaking if previously passing `[]` but still expecting `Notification`s to be posted. Pass `[AlamofireNotifications()]` if you need that behavior.\n  - Updated by [Jon Shier](https://github.com/jshier) in Pull Request [#3894](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/pull/3894).\n- `DownloadRequest.validate` to read the `fileSize` rather than the whole file from disk.\n  - Updated by [Jon Shier](https://github.com/jshier) in Pull Request [#3899](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/pull/3899).\n- Links to `swiftlang` repositories.\n  - Updated by [LamTrinh.Dev](https://github.com/lamtrinhdev) in Pull Request [#3882](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/pull/3882).\n\n### Fixed\n- Various documentation typos.\n  - Fixed by [Alexander Cyon](https://github.com/Sajjon) in Pull Request [#3891](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/pull/3891).\n- Passing `queue` parameter to `DataStream` serializers.\n  - Fixed by [Jon Shier](https://github.com/jshier) in Pull Request [#3879](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/pull/3879).\n- `testThatDatesCanBeEncodedAsFormatted` when running with a non-Gregorian calendar.\n  - Fixed by [Kittisak Phetrungnapha](https://github.com/kittisak-phetrungnapha) in Pull Request [#3858](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/pull/3858).\n\n---\n\n## [5.9.1](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/releases/tag/5.9.1)\n\nReleased on 2024-03-30.

All issues associated with this milestone can be found using this [filter](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/milestone/89?closed=1).\n\n### Added\n\n- [🔥 Experimental 🔥] `WebSocketRequest`, as a wrapper for `URLSessionWebSocketTask`. This preview release is undocumented behind `@_spi(WebSocket)`. Its API _will_ change in the future, especially to adopt typed throws, but it is largely feature complete, tested, and usable now. API feedback, missing use cases, and bug reports are much appreciated before it goes fully public.\n  - Added by [Jon Shier](https://github.com/jshier) in Pull Request [#3455](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/pull/3455).\n- `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` file and integration with SPM, CocoaPods, and Carthage.\n  - Added by [Dmitry Kuleshov](https://github.com/kdvmgn) and [Jon Shier](https://github.com/jshier) in Pull Requests [#3792](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/pull/3792), [#3831](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/pull/3831), and [#3839](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/pull/3839).\n- `AlamofireDynamic` target, to force dynamic linking in Xcode when using SPM.

We still have quite a few large changes we're trying to squeeze in before the Xcode 8 GM drops, so the APIs will continue to change over the next few weeks. Please keep in mind that each beta will likely bring new APIs and also refactor others. The betas **WILL NOT** follow semantic versioning. We'll most likely conform to semantic versioning once we start releasing the RCs unless we run into a major unforeseen issue.\n\nWe'd really appreciate everyone trying out the betas and letting us know if you find issues. We want to address every possible issue prior to the official Alamofire 4.0.0 release.\n\n---\n\n## [3.5.1](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/releases/tag/3.5.1)\n\nReleased on 2016-10-01.

There are several reasons why this was deployed as a MINOR and not MAJOR release. First off, the public API changes of this release are fully backwards compatible. There are no breaking API changes in the public APIs. Strictly following semver dictates that this is a MINOR, not MAJOR release.\n\n> See [semver](https://semver.org/#semantic-versioning-specification-semver) for more info.\n\nWe also realize that this can be frustrating for those out there not ready to upgrade to Xcode 7.3. Please know that we consider each release version carefully before deploying. Our decision to bump the MINOR version was not only due to strictly following semver, but also because it's difficult and undesirable for all OSS libraries to bump MAJOR versions each time the Swift APIs are incremented. Alamofire would have had to go through 6 additional MAJOR versions if this was the policy. That would mean we'd already be running on Alamofire 10.x. Incrementing MAJOR versions this quickly is disruptive to the community and would cause even more confusion. Instead, we try to carefully plan our MAJOR version releases and accompany them with detailed Migration Guides to help make the transition as smooth as possible.\n\nIf anyone has additional questions, please feel free to open an issue and we'll be more than happy to discuss further.\n\n---\n\n## [3.2.1](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/releases/tag/3.2.1)\n\nReleased on 2016-02-27.

Fixed by [Christian Noon](https://github.com/cnoon).\n\n#### Upgrade Notes\n\nThere are a couple changes in the 1.3.0 release that are not fully backwards\ncompatible and need to be called out.\n\n- The global `request` / `download` / `upload` external parameter naming conventions\n  were not consistent nor did they match the `Manager` equivalents. By making them\n  consistent across the board, this introduced the possibility that you \"may\" need to\n  make slight modifications to your global function calls.\n- In order to support generic response serializers, the lowest level\n  `Request.response` method had to be converted to a generic method leveraging the new\n  `ResponseSerializer` protocol. This has many advantages, the most obvious being that\n  the `response` convenience method now returns an `NSData?` optional instead of an\n  `AnyObject?` optional. Nice!\n\n  > Please note that every effort is taken to maintain proper semantic versioning. In\n  > these two rare cases, it was deemed to be in the best interest of the community to\n  > slightly break semantic versioning to unify naming conventions as well as expose a\n  > much more powerful form of response serialization.\n\n  > If you have any issues, please don't hesitate to reach out through\n  > [GitHub](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/issues) or\n  > [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AlamofireSF).\n\n---\n\n## [1.2.3](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/releases/tag/1.2.3)\n\nReleased on 2015-06-12.

By doing so, you'll be more likely to quickly solve your problem, and you'll allow anyone else with the same question to find the answer. This also allows maintainers to focus on improving the project for others.\n\nIf you'd like to discuss Alamofire best practices, common usage patterns, ideas for new features, or ongoing development, please use our [Swift Forums](https://forums.swift.org/c/related-projects/alamofire/).\n\n## Reporting Security Issues\n\nThe Alamofire Software Foundation takes security seriously.\nIf you discover a security issue, please bring it to our attention right away!\n\nPlease **DO NOT** file a public issue, instead send your report privately to <security@alamofire.org>. This will help ensure that any vulnerabilities that _are_ found can be [disclosed responsibly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure) to any affected parties.\n\n## Reporting Other Issues\n\nA great way to contribute to the project is to send a detailed issue when you encounter a problem. We always appreciate a well-written, thorough bug report.\n\nCheck that the project issues database doesn't already include that problem or suggestion before submitting an issue. If you find a match, feel free to vote for the issue by adding a reaction. Doing this helps prioritize the most common problems and requests.\n\nWhen reporting issues, please fill out our issue template. The information the template asks for will help us review and fix your issue faster.\n\n## Triage Issues [![Open Source Helpers](https://www.codetriage.com/alamofire/alamofire/badges/users.svg)](https://www.codetriage.com/alamofire/alamofire)\n\nYou can triage issues which may include reproducing bug reports or asking for vital information, such as version numbers or reproduction instructions. If you would like to start triaging issues, one easy way to get started is to [subscribe to alamofire on CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/alamofire/alamofire).\n\n## Submitting Pull Requests\n\nYou can contribute by fixing bugs or adding new features. For larger code changes, we recommend first discussing your ideas on our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/discussions) or [Swift Forums](https://forums.swift.org/c/related-projects/alamofire/). When submitting a pull request, please add relevant tests and ensure your changes don't break any existing tests (see [Automated Tests](#automated-tests) below).\n\n### Automated Tests\n\nAlamofire's tests depend on our [Firewalk](https://github.com/Alamofire/Firewalk) test server. To run the automated tests, you first need to have the server running locally. \n\nIn your terminal, run the following commands:\n- To install Firewalk: `brew install alamofire/alamofire/firewalk`\n- To run and detach the server: `firewalk &`\n- To stop the server, run `kill` and provide the pid output after launch.\n\n## Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1\n\nBy making a contribution to this project, I certify that:\n\n- (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I\n      have the right to submit it under the open source license\n      indicated in the file; or\n\n- (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best\n      of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source\n      license and I have the right under that license to submit that\n      work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part\n      by me, under the same open source license (unless I am\n      permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated\n      in the file; or\n\n- (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other\n      person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified\n      it.\n\n- (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution\n      are public and that a record of the contribution (including all\n      personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is\n      maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with\n      this project or the open source license(s) involved.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nThe Code of Conduct governs how we behave in public or in private\nwhenever the project will be judged by our actions.\nWe expect it to be honored by everyone who contributes to this project.\n\nSee [CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/Alamofire/Foundation/blob/master/CONDUCT.md) for details.\n\n---\n\n*Some of the ideas and wording for the statements above were based on work by the [Docker](https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Linux](https://elinux.org/Developer_Certificate_Of_Origin) communities.

An image library including image response serializers, `UIImage` and `UIImageView` extensions, custom image filters, an auto-purging in-memory cache, and a priority-based image downloading system.\n- [AlamofireNetworkActivityIndicator](https://github.com/Alamofire/AlamofireNetworkActivityIndicator) - Controls the visibility of the network activity indicator on iOS using Alamofire. It contains configurable delay timers to help mitigate flicker and can support `URLSession` instances not managed by Alamofire.\n\n## Requirements\n\n| Platform                                             | Minimum Swift Version | Installation                                                                                                         | Status                   |\n| ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |\n| iOS 10.0+ / macOS 10.12+ / tvOS 10.0+ / watchOS 3.0+ | 5.9 / Xcode 15.0      | [CocoaPods](#cocoapods), [Carthage](#carthage), [Swift Package Manager](#swift-package-manager), [Manual](#manually) | Fully Tested             |\n| Linux                                                | Latest Only           | [Swift Package Manager](#swift-package-manager)                                                                      | Building But Unsupported |\n| Windows                                              | Latest Only           | [Swift Package Manager](#swift-package-manager)                                                                      | Building But Unsupported |\n| Android                                              | Latest Only           | [Swift Package Manager](#swift-package-manager)                                                                      | Building But Unsupported |\n\n#### Known Issues on Linux and Windows\n\nAlamofire builds on Linux, Windows, and Android but there are missing features and many issues in the underlying `swift-corelibs-foundation` that prevent full functionality and may cause crashes. These include:\n\n- `ServerTrustManager` and associated certificate functionality is unavailable, so there is no certificate pinning and no client certificate support.\n- Various methods of HTTP authentication may crash, including HTTP Basic and HTTP Digest. Crashes may occur if responses contain server challenges.\n- Cache control through `CachedResponseHandler` and associated APIs is unavailable, as the underlying delegate methods aren't called.\n- `URLSessionTaskMetrics` are never gathered.\n- `WebSocketRequest` is not available.\n\nDue to these issues, Alamofire is unsupported on Linux, Windows, and Android. Please report any crashes to the [Swift bug reporter](https://bugs.swift.org).\n\n## Migration Guides\n\n- [Alamofire 5.0 Migration Guide](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/blob/master/Documentation/Alamofire%205.0%20Migration%20Guide.md)\n- [Alamofire 4.0 Migration Guide](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/blob/master/Documentation/Alamofire%204.0%20Migration%20Guide.md)\n- [Alamofire 3.0 Migration Guide](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/blob/master/Documentation/Alamofire%203.0%20Migration%20Guide.md)\n- [Alamofire 2.0 Migration Guide](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/blob/master/Documentation/Alamofire%202.0%20Migration%20Guide.md)\n\n## Communication\n\n- If you **need help with making network requests** using Alamofire, use [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/alamofire) and tag `alamofire`.\n- If you need to **find or understand an API**, check [our documentation](http://alamofire.github.io/Alamofire/) or [Apple's documentation for `URLSession`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/url_loading_system), on top of which Alamofire is built.\n- If you need **help with an Alamofire feature**, use [our forum on swift.org](https://forums.swift.org/c/related-projects/alamofire).\n- If you'd like to **discuss Alamofire best practices**, use [our forum on swift.org](https://forums.swift.org/c/related-projects/alamofire).\n- If you'd like to **discuss a feature request**, use [our forum on swift.org](https://forums.swift.org/c/related-projects/alamofire).\n- If you **found a bug**, open an issue here on GitHub and follow the guide. The more detail the better!\n\n## Installation\n\n### Swift Package Manager\n\nThe [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler.\n\nOnce you have your Swift package set up, adding Alamofire as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift` or the Package list in Xcode.\n\n```swift\ndependencies: [\n    .package(url: \"https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire.git\", .upToNextMajor(from: \"5.10.0\"))\n]\n```\n\nNormally you'll want to depend on the `Alamofire` target:\n\n```swift\n.product(name: \"Alamofire\", package: \"Alamofire\")\n```\n\nBut if you want to force Alamofire to be dynamically linked (do not do this unless you're sure you need it), you can depend on the `AlamofireDynamic` target:\n\n```swift\n.product(name: \"AlamofireDynamic\", package: \"Alamofire\")\n```\n\n### CocoaPods\n\n[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate Alamofire into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:\n\n```ruby\npod 'Alamofire'\n```\n\n### Carthage\n\n[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks. To integrate Alamofire into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:\n\n```ogdl\ngithub \"Alamofire/Alamofire\"\n```\n\n### Manually\n\nIf you prefer not to use any of the aforementioned dependency managers, you can integrate Alamofire into your project manually.\n\n#### Embedded Framework\n\n- Open up Terminal, `cd` into your top-level project directory, and run the following command \"if\" your project is not initialized as a git repository:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ git init\n  ```\n\n- Add Alamofire as a git [submodule](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule) by running the following command:\n\n  ```bash\n  $ git submodule add https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire.git\n  ```\n\n- Open the new `Alamofire` folder, and drag the `Alamofire.xcodeproj` into the Project Navigator of your application's Xcode project.\n\n  > It should appear nested underneath your application's blue project icon. Whether it is above or below all the other Xcode groups does not matter.\n\n- Select the `Alamofire.xcodeproj` in the Project Navigator and verify the deployment target matches that of your application target.\n- Next, select your application project in the Project Navigator (blue project icon) to navigate to the target configuration window and select the application target under the \"Targets\" heading in the sidebar.\n- In the tab bar at the top of that window, open the \"General\" panel.\n- Click on the `+` button under the \"Embedded Binaries\" section.\n- You will see two different `Alamofire.xcodeproj` folders each with two different versions of the `Alamofire.framework` nested inside a `Products` folder.\n\n  > It does not matter which `Products` folder you choose from, but it does matter whether you choose the top or bottom `Alamofire.framework`.\n\n- Select the top `Alamofire.framework` for iOS and the bottom one for macOS.\n\n  > You can verify which one you selected by inspecting the build log for your project. The build target for `Alamofire` will be listed as `Alamofire iOS`, `Alamofire macOS`, `Alamofire tvOS`, or `Alamofire watchOS`.\n\n- And that's it!\n\n  > The `Alamofire.framework` is automagically added as a target dependency, linked framework and embedded framework in a copy files build phase which is all you need to build on the simulator and a device.\n\n## Contributing\n\nBefore contributing to Alamofire, please read the instructions detailed in our [contribution guide](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Open Radars\n\nThe following radars have some effect on the current implementation of Alamofire.\n\n- [`rdar://21349340`](http://www.openradar.me/radar?id=5517037090635776) - Compiler throwing warning due to toll-free bridging issue in the test case\n- `rdar://26870455` - Background URL Session Configurations do not work in the simulator\n- `rdar://26849668` - Some URLProtocol APIs do not properly handle `URLRequest`\n\n## Resolved Radars\n\nThe following radars have been resolved over time after being filed against the Alamofire project.\n\n- [`rdar://26761490`](http://www.openradar.me/radar?id=5010235949318144) - Swift string interpolation causing memory leak with common usage.\n  - (Resolved): 9/1/17 in Xcode 9 beta 6.\n- [`rdar://36082113`](http://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=4942308441063424) - `URLSessionTaskMetrics` failing to link on watchOS 3.0+\n  - (Resolved): Just add `CFNetwork` to your linked frameworks.\n- `FB7624529` - `urlSession(_:task:didFinishCollecting:)` never called on watchOS\n  - (Resolved): Metrics now collected on watchOS 7+.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### What's the origin of the name Alamofire?\n\nAlamofire is named after the [Alamo Fire flower](https://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/wildseed/alamofire.html), a hybrid variant of the Bluebonnet, the official state flower of Texas.\n\n## Credits\n\nAlamofire is owned and maintained by the [Alamofire Software Foundation](http://alamofire.org). You can follow them on Twitter at [@AlamofireSF](https://twitter.com/AlamofireSF) for project updates and releases.\n\n### Security Disclosure\n\nIf you believe you have identified a security vulnerability with Alamofire, you should report it as soon as possible via email to security@alamofire.org. Please do not post it to a public issue tracker.\n\n## Sponsorship\n\nThe [ASF](https://github.com/Alamofire/Foundation#members) is looking to raise money to officially stay registered as a federal non-profit organization.\nRegistering will allow Foundation members to gain some legal protections and also allow us to put donations to use, tax-free.\nSponsoring the ASF will enable us to:\n\n- Pay our yearly legal fees to keep the non-profit in good status\n- Pay for our mail servers to help us stay on top of all questions and security issues\n- Potentially fund test servers to make it easier for us to test the edge cases\n- Potentially fund developers to work on one of our projects full-time\n\nThe community adoption of the ASF libraries has been amazing.\nWe are greatly humbled by your enthusiasm around the projects and want to continue to do everything we can to move the needle forward.\nWith your continued support, the ASF will be able to improve its reach and also provide better legal safety for the core members.\nIf you use any of our libraries for work, see if your employers would be interested in donating.\nAny amount you can donate, whether once or monthly, to help us reach our goal would be greatly appreciated.\n\n[Sponsor Alamofire](https://github.com/sponsors/Alamofire)\n\n## Supporters\n\n[MacStadium](https://macstadium.com) provides Alamofire with a free, hosted Mac mini.\n\n![Powered by MacStadium](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alamofire/Alamofire/master/Resources/MacStadiumLogo.png)\n\n## License\n\nAlamofire is released under the MIT license.
