stuff. ;)\n- Netdata\n- Prometheus\n- AlertManager\n- Rocket.Chat\n- Docker\n- cAdvisor\n- Grafana\n- Node_Exporter\n\n\n# Install Demonstration\n\n[![demo](https://asciinema.org/a/P1LJ9GYTVamd9AwjJmVWLErqD.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/P1LJ9GYTVamd9AwjJmVWLErqD?speed=2&autoplay=1)\n\n\n# Howto\nFirst of all, clone the giropopos-monitoring repo:\n```\n# git clone https://github.com/badtuxx/giropops-monitoring.git\n```\n\n## Install Docker and create Swarm cluster\n```\n# curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh\n# docker swarm init\n```\n\n## Install Netdata:\n```\n# bash <(curl -Ss https://my-netdata.io/kickstart.sh)\n```\n\nSetting Netdata Exporter configuration in Prometheus:\n```\n# vim conf/prometheus/prometheus.yml\n...\n- job_name: 'netdata'\n    metrics_path: '/api/v1/allmetrics'\n    params:\n      format: [prometheus]\n    honor_labels: true\n    scrape_interval: 5s\n    static_configs:\n         - targets: ['YOUR_IP:19999']\n```\n\n\n## Get Rocket.Chat Incoming WebHook \n\n1) Deploy giropops stack, only to get the WebHook\n\n```\n# docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml giropops\n```\n\n2) Access YOUR_IP:3080 and create your account\n\n3) Login with your user and go to: Administration => Integrations => New Integration => Incoming WebHook\n\n4) Set \"Enabled\" and \"Script Enabled\" to \"True\"\n\n5) Set all channels, icons, etc. as you need\n\n6) Paste contents of [rocketchat/incoming-webhook.js](conf/rocketchat/incoming-webhook.js) into Script field.\n\n7) Create Integration. You will see some values appear. Copy WebHook URL and proceed to \"Integration between Rocket.Chat and AlertManager\" section.\n\n8) Remove giropops stack\n```\n# docker stack rm giropops\n```\n[Rocket.Chat Docs](https://rocket.chat/docs/administrator-guides/integrations/)\n\n\n## Integration between Rocket.Chat and AlertManager\n\n```\n# vim conf/alertmanager/config.yml\n\nroute:\n    repeat_interval: 30m\n    group_interval: 30m\n    receiver: 'rocketchat'\n\nreceivers:\n    - name: 'rocketchat'\n      webhook_configs:\n          - send_resolved: false\n            # copy below the WEBHOOK that you create before\n            url: '${WEBHOOK_URL}'\n```\n\n\n## Deploy Stack with Docker Swarm\n\nExecute deploy to create the stack of giropops-monitoring:\n```\n# docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml giropops\n\nCreating network giropops_backend\nCreating network giropops_frontend\nCreating network giropops_default\nCreating service giropops_prometheus\nCreating service giropops_node-exporter\nCreating service giropops_alertmanager\nCreating service giropops_cadvisor\nCreating service giropops_grafana\nCreating service giropops_rocketchat\nCreating service giropops_mongo\nCreating service giropops_mongo-init-replica\n```\n\nVerify if services are ok:\n```\n# docker service ls\n\nID              NAME                          MODE         REPLICAS  IMAGE                                  PORTS\n2j5vievon95j    giropops_alertmanager         replicated   1/1       linuxtips/alertmanager_alpine:latest   *:9093->9093/tcp\ny1kinszpqzpg    giropops_cadvisor             global       1/1       google/cadvisor:latest                 *:8080->8080/tcp\njol20u8pahlp    giropops_grafana              replicated   1/1       grafana/grafana:latest                 *:3000->3000/tcp\nt3635s4xh5cp    giropops_mongo                replicated   1/1       mongo:3.2\nt8vnb7xuyfa8    giropops_mongo-init-replica   replicated   0/1       mongo:3.2\nusr0jy4jquns    giropops_node-exporter        global       1/1       linuxtips/node-exporter_alpine:latest  *:9100->9100/tcp\nzc3qza0bxys7    giropops_prometheus           replicated   1/1       linuxtips/prometheus_alpine:latest     *:9090->9090/tcp\n7bgnm0poxbwj    giropops_rocketchat           replicated   1/1       rocketchat/rocket.chat:latest          *:3080->3080/tcp\n```\nPS: Don't worry why giropops_mongo-init-replica service is down, it only executes one time to initialize the replica set. It will not stay running.\n\n\n## Access Services in Browser\n\nTo access Prometheus interface on browser:\n```\nhttp://YOUR_IP:9090\n```\n\nTo access AlertManager interface on browser:\n```\nhttp://YOUR_IP:9093\n```\n\nTo access Grafana interface on browser:\n```\nhttp://YOUR_IP:3000\nuser: admin\npasswd: giropops\n\nTo add plugs edit file giropops-monitoring/grafana.config\nGF_INSTALL_PLUGINS=plug1,plug2\nCurrent plugs grafana-clock-panel,grafana-piechart-panel,camptocamp-prometheus-alertmanager-datasource,vonage-status-panel\n```\nHave fun, access the dashboards! ;)\n\nTo access Netdata interface on browser:\n```\nhttp://YOUR_IP:19999\n```\n\nTo access Prometheus Node_exporter metrics on browser:\n```\nhttp://YOUR_IP:9100/metrics\n```\n\nTo access RocketChat interface on browser:  \n```\nhttp://YOUR_IP:3080\n> First to register becomes admin\n```\nRemember that RocketChat endpoints and payloads are identical to Slack's, so if you wanna set Grafana alerts, just select a slack alert and give it a RocketChat incoming webhook URL, with no script needed.\n\n\nTest if your alerts are ok:\n```\n# docker service rm giropops_node-exporter\n\nWait some seconds and you will see the integration works fine! Prometheus alerting the AlertManager that alert the Slack that shows it to you! It's so easy and that simple! :D\n```\n\n\nOf course, create new alerts on Prometheus:\n```\n# vim conf/prometheus/alert.rules\n```\n\n\n# Ahhhh, Help us to improve it!\n# Thanks! #VAIIII\n"
