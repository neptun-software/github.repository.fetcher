This means you can the linuxserver.io mods. To add support for git add the `DOCKER_MODS` environment variable like so `DOCKER_MODS=linuxserver/mods:universal-git`.\n\n### Docker CLI example\n\n```PowerShell\ndocker run -d `\n  -v D:/ob/vaults:/vaults `\n  -v D:/ob/config:/config `\n  -p 8080:8080 `\n  -e DOCKER_MODS=linuxserver/mods:universal-git `\n  ghcr.io/sytone/obsidian-remote:latest\n```\n\n## Reloading Obsidan in the Browser\n\nIf you make changes to plugins or do updates that need to have obsidian restarted, instead of having to stop and start the docker container you can just close the Obsidian UI and right click to show the menus and reopen it. Here is a short clip showing how to do it.\n\n![Reloading Obsidian in the Browser](./assets/ReloadExample.gif)\n\n## Setting PUID and PGID\n\nTo set PUID and PGID use the follow environment variables on the command line, by default the IDs are 911/911\n\n```PowerShell\ndocker run --rm -it `\n  -v D:/ob/vaults:/vaults `\n  -v D:/ob/config:/config `\n  -e PUID=1000 `\n  -e PGID=1000 `\n  -p 8080:8080 `\n  ghcr.io/sytone/obsidian-remote:latest\n```\n\nOr, if you use docker-compose, add them to the environment: section:\n\n```yaml\nenvironment:\n  - PUID=1000\n  - PGID=1000\n```\n\nIt is most likely that you will use the id of yourself, which can be obtained by running the command below. The two values you will be interested in are the uid and gid.\n\n```powershell\nid $user\n```\n\n## Adding missing fonts\n\nThanks to @aaron-jang for this example.\n\nDownload the font of the language that you want to use in Obsidian and add it to the volume as shown below.\n\n### Map font file using Docker CLI\n\n```PowerShell\n  -v {downloaded font directory}:/usr/share/fonts/truetype/{font name}\n```\n\n### Map font file using Docker Compose\n\n```PowerShell\n    volumes:\n      - {downloaded font directory}:/usr/share/fonts/truetype/{font name}\n```\n\n## Hosting behind a reverse proxy\n\nIf you wish to do that **please make sure you are securing it in some way!**. You also need to ensure **websocket** support is enabled.\n\n### Example nginx configuration\n\nThis is an example, I recommend a SSL based proxy and some sort of authentication.\n\n```\nserver {\n  set $forward_scheme http;\n  set $server         \"10.10.10.10\";\n  set $port           8080;\n\n  listen 80;\n  server_name ob.mycooldomain.com;\n  proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;\n  proxy_set_header Connection $http_connection;\n  proxy_http_version 1.1;\n  access_log /data/logs/ob_access.log proxy;\n  error_log /data/logs/ob_error.log warn;\n  location / {\n    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;\n    proxy_set_header Connection $http_connection;\n    proxy_http_version 1.1;\n    # Proxy!\n    add_header       X-Served-By $host;\n    proxy_set_header Host $host;\n    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Scheme $scheme;\n    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto  $scheme;\n    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For    $remote_addr;\n    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP          $remote_addr;\n    proxy_pass       $forward_scheme://$server:$port$request_uri;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Hosting behind Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM)\n\nThanks to @fahrenhe1t for this example.\n\nIf you install obsidian-remote in Docker, you can proxy it through [Nginx Proxy Manager](https://nginxproxymanager.com/) (NPM - running on the same Docker instance), and use an access list to provide user authentication. The obsidian-remote container would have to be on the same network as Nginx Proxy Manager. If you don't expose the IP external to the container, authentication would be forced through NPM:\n\n```yaml\nservices:\n  obsidian:\n    image: 'ghcr.io/sytone/obsidian-remote:latest'\n    container_name: obsidian-remote\n    restart: unless-stopped\n    ports:\n      - 8080 #only exposes port internally to the container\n    volumes:\n      - /home/obsidian/vaults:/vaults\n      - /home/obsidian/config:/config\n    environment:\n      - PUID=1000\n      - PGID=1000\n      - TZ=America/Los_Angeles\n      - DOCKER_MODS=linuxserver/mods:universal-git\nnetworks:\n  default:\n    name: <your nginx proxy manager network>\n    external: true\n```\n\nCreate a proxy host in NPM pointing to the \"obsidian-remote:8080\" container, choose your domain name, use a LetsEncrypt SSL certificate, enable WebSockets. This video talks about it: [Nginx Proxy Manager - ACCESS LIST protection for internal services](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9voYZejH48)\n\n## Updating Obsidian\n\nBy default obsidian will update itself in the container. If you recreate the container you will have to do the update again. This repo will be updated periodically to keep up with the latest version of Obsidian.\n\n## Building locally\n\nTo build and use it locally run the following commands:\n\n```PowerShell\ndocker build --pull --rm `\n  -f \"Dockerfile\" `\n  -t obsidian-remote:latest `\n  \".\"\n```\n\nTo run the localy build image:\n\n```PowerShell\ndocker run --rm -it `\n  -v D:/ob/vaults:/vaults `\n  -v D:/ob/config:/config `\n  -p 8080:8080 `\n  obsidian-remote:latest bash\n```\n\n\n## Copy/Paste From External Source\n\nClick on the circle to the left side of your browser window. In there you will find a textbox for updating the remote clipboard or copying from it.\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1399443/202805847-a87e2c7c-a5c6-4dea-bbae-4b25b4b5866a.png)\n\n\n\n"
