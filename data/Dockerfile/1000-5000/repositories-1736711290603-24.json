          "content": "# Contributing\n\n## Plagiarism Policy\n\nAll content submitted to Hacking the Cloud must be written in your own words. Submissions which appear to include plagiarized material (copying and pasting of whole articles/blog posts) will be rejected. It is okay to quote an existing article (with the reference). The goal of Hacking the Cloud is to congregate knowledge for the community into a single location. This includes having links/references to primary sources.\n\nThink of Hacking the Cloud as the [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) of cloud security. We should cite our sources and quote content when needed, but our articles are written by our own contributors.\n\n__If you are an author and believe your work has been plagiarized on Hacking the Cloud, please submit an [issue](https://github.com/Hacking-the-Cloud/hackingthe.cloud/issues) on GitHub and it will be taken down quickly.__\n\nThere is one exception to this policy; If you are the original author of the article or blog post, you are welcome to copy the contents of it and include it here on Hacking the Cloud. This rule is intended to make it easy for authors to contribute their work without having to go through the trouble of editing/changing it. If it is later determined that the submitter is not the original author, the work will be removed.\n\n## Content Removal Policy\n\nIf you are a researcher or author and you see that you blog/article has been linked to from Hacking the Cloud and would like it removed, please submit an [issue](https://github.com/Hacking-the-Cloud/hackingthe.cloud/issues) on GitHub and it will be removed. On a case-by-case basis the article will be considered for removal. Please note, however, that if the topic of the article is on a generic topic it is unlikely to be removed. For example, say an article is related to a privilege escalation technique. As a part of that article we may link to an external source as a reference or additional reading. If the author of the external source would like their link removed, it will be. However, the article itself will remain (so long as it is not plagiarized) as an individual cannot claim ownership of a generic technique.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nHacking the Cloud uses Material for MkDocs and the Awesome Pages Plugin. To make it easy to setup, there is a Docker file in this repository you can use to get up and running. First, build the docker container.\n\n```\ndocker build -t mkdocs-material .\n```\n\nTo run a test server for your local environment you can run the Docker container (ensuring you expose a port and provide the local directory).\n\n```\ndocker run --rm -it -p 8000:8000 -v ${PWD}:/docs mkdocs-material\n```\n\n__NOTE__: You do not have to run the Docker container to contribute. You can make edits or even create new pages directly from GitHub. Go to the file you'd like to edit, or the directory you'd like to add to and click \"Add File\" in the mid-top right. Use the Markdown editor built into GitHub and submit your Pull Request.\n\n## Using Cards\n\nIf you'd like to use a card, for [example](https://hackingthe.cloud/aws/post_exploitation/create_a_console_session_from_iam_credentials/) `Technique seen in the wild`, `Tools mentioned in this article`, etc, __please be aware that you would need a subscription for [Material for MKDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/grids/#using-card-grids) for the cards to be properly displayed on your local machine__. Simply copy and paste the template from the options below and it will be properly rendered on the site (we have a subscription to Material for MKDocs).\n\n### Card Templates\n\n```\n<div class=\"grid cards\" markdown>\n\n-   :material-tools:{ .lg .middle } __Tools mentioned in this article__\n\n    ---\n\n    [](): Title\n\n-   :material-account:{ .lg .middle } __Original Research__\n\n    ---\n\n    [](): Title\n\n-   :material-account:{ .lg .middle } __Original Research__\n\n    ---\n\n    <aside style=\"display:flex\">\n    <p><a href=\"link\">title</a> by <a href=\"profile link\">name</a></p>\n    <p><img src=\"image\" alt=\"name\" style=\"width:44px;height:44px;margin:5px;border-radius:100%;max-width:unset\"></img></p>\n    </aside>\n\n-   :material-alert-decagram:{ .lg .middle } __Technique seen in the wild__\n\n    ---\n\n    Reference: []()\n\n-   :material-book:{ .lg .middle } __Additional Resources__\n\n    ---\n\n    Reference: []()\n\n-   :material-shield-lock:{ .lg .middle } __Required IAM Permissions__\n\n    ---\n\n    - []()\n\n-   :material-shield-plus:{ .lg .middle } __Recommended but not Required IAM Permissions__\n\n    ---\n\n    - \n\n-   :material-link-box-outline:{ .lg .middle } __Technique Article__\n\n    ---\n\n    - \n</div>\n```\n\n## Creating a New Page\n\nAll of the content for Hacking the Cloud is in the \"content\" directory. From here, you can navigate to the different sections of each cloud provider. If you aren't sure what specific section to place it in, no worries! Feel free to put it under ./content and we can find or create a home for it later.\n\nWhen creating a page, please give it a descriptive name like \"get_account_id_from_keys.md\" or \"brute_force_iam_permissions.md\". The file must be in Markdown so please also include the \".md\" extension.\n\nAfter creating the file, please put the following at the top and fill it out.\n\n```\n---\nauthor_name: <Your Name>\ntitle: <Page Title>\ndescription: <A description of the page>\n---\n```\n\nFrom here you should be able to write your content and submit a pull request. If you have any trouble don't hesitate to reach out via our GitHub Discussions page.\n"

Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.\n\n    The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\n\nSection 6 â€“ Term and Termination.\n\n    This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\n\n    Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n        automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\n        upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\n    For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\n    Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\n\nSection 7 â€“ Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n    The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n    Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\nSection 8 â€“ Interpretation.\n\n    For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\n    To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\n    No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\n    Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\nSection 9 â€“ Exceptions.\n\n    For the purposes of bettering the project, this license exempts Nicholas Frichette, or whoever owns the primary Hacking the Cloud git repository, from any NonCommercial requirements. The owner is permitted to add advertisements, sponshorships, or other revenue generating products to the project. All other individuals or parties are not exempt from the NonCommercial requirements.\n"
