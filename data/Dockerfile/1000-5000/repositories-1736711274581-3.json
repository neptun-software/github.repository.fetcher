This document will outline a number of ways you can get involved.\r\n\r\n## Reporting Issues\r\n\r\nHave you identified a reproducible problem in VS Code Remote extensions? Have a feature request? We want to hear about it! Here's how you can make reporting your issue as effective as possible.\r\n\r\n### Identify Where to Report\r\n\r\nThis repository is specifically for the VS Code Remote Development extension pack and related extensions. Consider these other locations for your feedback if your issue is not directly related to these extensions:\r\n\r\n- If you are encountering an issue with another extension when running in a remote environment, please raise an issue in the extension's repository. You can reference the [summary](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/troubleshooting/extensions) of tips for resolving extension issues and our [extension guide](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/developing-extensions) to help the extension author get started.\r\n- You can report issues related to offically maintained Dev Container Templates at [devcontainers/templates](https://github.com/devcontainers/templates).\r\n- You can report issues related to offically maintained Dev Container Features at [devcontainers/features](https://github.com/devcontainers/features).\r\n- Image issues for `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers` and `mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers` images can be raised at [devcontainers/images](https://github.com/devcontainers/images).\r\n- For issues related to the Dev Container specification, raise an issue at [devcontainers/spec](https://github.com/devcontainers/spec).\r\n- For issues related to the Dev Container CLI, raise an issue at [devcontainers/cli](https://github.com/devcontainers/cli).\r\n- Github Codespaces issues should be raised in [GitHub Feedback](https://github.com/github/feedback/discussions/categories/codespaces).\r\n- If you are not looking to report an issue related to these extensions, you may be looking for the [VS Code OSS](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode) repository. However, note that, the VS Code project is distributed across multiple repositories. See the list of [Related Projects](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Related-Projects) if you aren't sure which repo is correct.\r\n\r\n### Look For an Existing Issue\r\n\r\nBefore you create a new issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.\r\n\r\nBe sure to scan through the [most popular](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afeature-request+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) feature requests.\r\n\r\nIf you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction in place of a \"+1\" comment:\r\n\r\n* 👍 - upvote\r\n* 👎 - downvote\r\n\r\nIf you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, create a new issue using the guidelines below.\r\n\r\n### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests\r\n\r\nFile a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.\r\n\r\nDo not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar, but have different causes.\r\n\r\nThe more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.\r\n\r\nPlease include the following with each issue:\r\n\r\n* Version of VS Code\r\n  \r\n* What type of remote connection you were using: SSH, Containers, WSL\r\n\r\n* Your operating system  \r\n\r\n* The remote operating system you are connecting to\r\n\r\n* List of extensions that you have installed\r\n\r\n* Reproducible steps (1... 2... 3...) that cause the issue\r\n\r\n* What you expected to see, versus what you actually saw\r\n\r\n* Images, animations, or a link to a video showing the issue occurring\r\n\r\n* A code snippet that demonstrates the issue or a link to a code repository the developers can easily pull down to recreate the issue locally\r\n\r\n  * **Note:** Because the developers need to copy and paste the code snippet, including a code snippet as a media file (i.e. .gif) is not sufficient.\r\n\r\n* Errors from the Dev Tools Console (open from the menu: Help > Toggle Developer Tools)\r\n\r\n* If you are using VS Code Remote - Container support, include your container configuration files if you are able to.\r\n\r\n### Final Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease remember to do the following:\r\n\r\n* [ ] Search the issue repository to ensure your report is a new issue\r\n\r\n* [ ] Recreate the issue after disabling all extensions\r\n\r\n* [ ] Simplify your code around the issue to better isolate the problem\r\n\r\nDon't feel bad if the developers can't reproduce the issue right away. They will simply ask for more information!\r\n\r\n### Follow Your Issue\r\n\r\nOnce submitted, your report will go into the a similar [issue tracking](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Issue-Tracking) workflow that is used for the core VS Code project. Be sure to understand what will happen next, so you know what to expect, and how to continue to assist throughout the process.\r\n\r\n### Automated Issue Management\r\n\r\nWe use a bot to help us manage issues. This bot currently:\r\n\r\n* Automatically closes any issue marked `needs-more-info` if there has been no response in the past 7 days.\r\n* Automatically locks issues 45 days after they are closed.\r\n\r\nIf you believe the bot got something wrong, please open a new issue and let us know.\r\n\r\n## Contributing to Documentation\r\n\r\nIf you want to contribute to our documentation, please submit a pull request (or raise an issue) in the [vscode-docs repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-docs).\r\n\r\n## Code of Conduct\r\n\r\nThis project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).\r\nFor more information see the [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/) or\r\ncontact [opencode@microsoft.com](mailto:opencode@microsoft.com) with any additional questions or comments.\r\n\r\n## Thank You!\r\n\r\nYour contributions, large or small, make great projects like this possible. Thank you for taking the time to contribute.\r\n"

          "content": "MICROSOFT PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS\r\nMICROSOFT VISUAL STUDIO CODE REMOTE DEVELOPMENT EXTENSIONS\r\n\r\nThese license terms are an agreement between you and Microsoft Corporation (or based on where you live, one of its affiliates). They apply to the pre-release software named above. The terms also apply to any Microsoft services or updates for the software, except to the extent those have additional terms.\r\n\r\nIF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW.\r\n\r\n1.\tINSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS. \r\n    a.\tGeneral. You may use a copy of the software with each validly licensed copy of Microsoft Visual Studio Code. You may not use the software if you do not have a license for Microsoft Visual Studio Code. You may copy and install files from the software onto your application development devices, including physical devices and virtual machines or containers on those machines, which are (i) owned by you and located on-premises or hosted on your own private cloud or data center, or (ii) remote devices, virtual machines, or containers which are dedicated solely to your use and hosted for you on Microsoft Azure or by other cloud hosting providers (collectively, “Development Devices”). You and others in your organization may use these files on your Development Devices solely to develop and test applications. For clarity, “applications” means applications developed by you and others in your organization who are each licensed to use Microsoft Visual Studio Code.\r\n    b.\tDemo Use. The uses permitted above include use of the software in demonstrating your applications.\r\n    c.\tThird Party Components.  The software may include third party components with separate legal notices or governed by other agreements, as may be described in the ThirdPartyNotices file(s) accompanying the software.\r\n    d.\tExtensions. The software gives you the option to download other Microsoft and third party software packages from our extension marketplace or package managers. Those packages are under their own licenses, and not this agreement. Microsoft does not distribute, license or provide any warranties for any of the third party packages. By accessing or using our extension marketplace, you agree to the extension marketplace terms located at https://aka.ms/vsmarketplace-ToU.\r\n\r\n2.\tPRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE. The software is a pre-release version. It may not work the way a final version of the software will. Microsoft may change it for the final, commercial version. We also may not release a commercial version. Microsoft is not obligated to provide maintenance, technical support or updates to you for the software.\r\n\r\n3.\tONLINE SERVICES IN THE SOFTWARE. Some features of the software make use of online services to provide you with updates to the software or extensions, to download or install additional software to enable use of this software, or to enable you to retrieve content, collaborate with others, or otherwise supplement your development. As used throughout this agreement, the term “software” includes these online service features.\r\n\r\n4.\tDATA. \r\n    a.\tData Collection. The software may collect information about you and your use of the software, and send that to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this information to provide services and improve our products and services. You may opt-out of many of these scenarios, but not all, as described in the product documentation located at https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/faq#_how-to-disable-telemetry-reporting. There may also be some features in the software that may enable you and Microsoft to collect data from users of your applications. If you use these features, you must comply with applicable law, including providing appropriate notices to users of your applications together with Microsoft’s privacy statement. Our privacy statement is located at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=824704. You can learn more about data collection and use in the help documentation and our privacy statement. Your use of the software operates as your consent to these practices.\r\n    b.\tProcessing of Personal Data. To the extent Microsoft is a processor or subprocessor of personal data in connection with the software, Microsoft makes the commitments in the European Union General Data Protection Regulation Terms of the Online Services Terms to all customers effective May 25, 2018, at https://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9840733.\r\n\r\n5.\tUPDATES. The software may periodically check for updates and download and install them for you. You may obtain updates only from Microsoft or authorized sources. Microsoft may need to update your system to provide you with updates. You agree to receive these automatic updates without any additional notice. Updates may not include or support all existing software features, services, or peripheral devices.\r\n\r\n6.\tFEEDBACK. If you give feedback about the software to Microsoft, you give to Microsoft, without charge, the right to use, share and commercialize your feedback in any way and for any purpose. You will not give feedback that is subject to a license that requires Microsoft to license its software or documentation to third parties because we include your feedback in them. These rights survive this agreement.\r\n\r\n7.\tSCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement. In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways. For example, if Microsoft technically limits or disables extensibility for the software, you may not extend the software by, among other things, loading or injecting into the software any non-Microsoft add-ins, macros, or packages; modifying the software registry settings; or adding features or functionality equivalent to that found in other Visual Studio products. You may not:\r\n    *\twork around any technical limitations in the software;\r\n    *\treverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for the software, except and to the extent required by third party licensing terms governing use of certain open source components that may be included with the software;\r\n    *\tremove, minimize, block or modify any notices of Microsoft or its suppliers in the software;\r\n    *\tuse the software in any way that is against the law; \r\n    *\thost, share, publish, rent or lease the software; or \r\n    *\tprovide the software as a stand-alone or integrated offering or combine it with any of your applications for others to use.\r\n\r\n8.\tSUPPORT SERVICES. Because the software is “as is,” we may not provide support services for it.\r\n\r\n9.\tENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support services.\r\n\r\n10.\tEXPORT RESTRICTIONS. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software, which include restrictions on destinations, end users and end use. For further information on export restrictions, visit (aka.ms/exporting).\r\n\r\n11.\tAPPLICABLE LAW. If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington State law applies to interpretation of and claims for breach of this agreement, and the laws of the state where you live apply to all other claims. If you acquired the software in any other country, its laws apply.\r\n\r\n12.\tCONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of your state or country. Separate and apart from your relationship with Microsoft, you may also have rights with respect to the party from which you acquired the software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you:\r\n    a.\tAustralia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights.\r\n    b.\tCanada. If you acquired the software in Canada, you may stop receiving updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting your device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the Internet, however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates), or uninstalling the software. The product documentation, if any, may also specify how to turn off updates for your specific device or software.\r\n    c.\tGermany and Austria.\r\n        (i)\tWarranty. The properly licensed software will perform substantially as described in any Microsoft materials that accompany the software. However, Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation to the licensed software.\r\n        (ii)\tLimitation of Liability. In case of intentional conduct, gross negligence, claims based on the Product Liability Act, as well as, in case of death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable according to the statutory law.\r\n        Subject to the foregoing clause (ii), Microsoft will only be liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called \"cardinal obligations\"). In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence.\r\n\r\n13.\tLEGAL EFFECT. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the laws of your country. You may also have rights with respect to the party from whom you acquired the software. This agreement does not change your rights under the laws of your country if the laws of your country do not permit it to do so.\r\n\r\n14.\tDISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS-IS.”  YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.\r\n\r\n15.\tLIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n    This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and (b) claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.\r\n\r\n    It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.\r\n\r\nPlease note: As the software is distributed in Quebec, Canada, some of the clauses in this agreement are provided below in French.\r\n\r\nRemarque : Ce logiciel étant distribué au Québec, Canada, certaines des clauses dans ce contrat sont fournies ci-dessous en français.\r\n\r\nEXONÉRATION DE GARANTIE. Le logiciel visé par une licence est offert « tel quel ». Toute utilisation de ce logiciel est à votre seule risque et péril. Microsoft n’accorde aucune autre garantie expresse. Vous pouvez bénéficier de droits additionnels en vertu du droit local sur la protection des consommateurs, que ce contrat ne peut modifier. La ou elles sont permises par le droit locale, les garanties implicites de qualité marchande, d’adéquation à un usage particulier et d’absence de contrefaçon sont exclues.\r\n\r\nLIMITATION DES DOMMAGES-INTÉRÊTS ET EXCLUSION DE RESPONSABILITÉ POUR LES DOMMAGES.

To the\nextent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are\ngranted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of\nthese terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in\nconsideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the\nLicensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\n\n\nSection 1 -- Definitions.\n\n  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar\n     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material\n     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,\n     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring\n     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the\n     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed\n     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,\n     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is\n     synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n\n  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright\n     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in\n     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n  c.

For purposes of this Public License, the rights\n     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar\n     Rights.\n\n  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the\n     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws\n     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright\n     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international\n     agreements.\n\n  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or\n     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights\n     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\n  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,\n     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public\n     License.\n\n  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the\n     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to\n     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the\n     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\n\n  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights\n     under this Public License.\n\n  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or\n     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such\n     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,\n     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material\n     available to the public including in ways that members of the\n     public may access the material from a place and at a time\n     individually chosen by them.\n\n  j.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\n          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\n          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\n          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\n            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\n               in part; and\n\n            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n\n       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n          its terms and conditions.\n\n       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n          6(a).\n\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n       5. Downstream recipients.\n\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\n            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n               Material.\n\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b. Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database;\n\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\nlicenses.

HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\n==========================\n\nPython was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\nMathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands\nas a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's\nprincipal author, although it includes many contributions from others.\n\nIn 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for\nNational Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)\nin Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the\nsoftware.\n\nIn May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to\nBeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same\nyear, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became\nZope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see\nhttps://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization\ncreated specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.\nZope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.\n\nAll Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for\nthe Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python\nreleases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes\nthe various releases.\n\n    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-\n                    from                                compatible? (1)\n\n    0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes\n    1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes\n    1.6             1.5.2       2000        CNRI        no\n    2.0             1.6         2000        BeOpen.com  no\n    1.6.1           1.6         2001        CNRI        yes (2)\n    2.1             2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         no\n    2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes\n    2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes\n    2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes\n    2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes\n    2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes\n\nFootnotes:\n\n(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under\n    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute\n    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The\n    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with\n    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.\n\n(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,\n    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to\n    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1\n    is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.\n\nThanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\ndirection to make these releases possible.\n\n\nB.

You can use the repository to report issues or submit feature requests on any of these extensions:\n\n- **[Remote - SSH](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/download/ssh)**\n    - Remote - SSH: Editing Configuration Files\n- **[Dev Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/download/containers)**\n- **[WSL](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/download/wsl)**\n- **[Remote - Tunnels](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.remote-server)** and the **[Visual Studio Code Server](https://aka.ms/vscode-server-doc)**.\n\nIf you are running into an issue with **another extension** you'd like to use with the Remote Development extensions, please raise an issue in the extension's repository. You can reference our [summary](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/troubleshooting/extensions) of tips for remote related issues and our [extension guide](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/developing-extensions) to help the extension author get started. \n\nIssues related to [the Dev Container ecosystem](https://containers.dev/) may be reported in several places. Issues involving [Features](https://github.com/devcontainers/features), [Templates](https://github.com/devcontainers/templates), or [Images](https://github.com/devcontainers/images) can be reported in the relevant repo.  Issues relating to the open source dev container CLI can be reported on [devcontainers/cli](https://github.com/devcontainers/cli). You may use the [dev container spec repository](https://github.com/devcontainers/spec) to file and review issues to shape the direction of development containers and the dev container CLI.\n\n## Documentation\n\nRunning into trouble? Wondering what you can do? These articles can help.\n\n- [Overview](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote)\n- [Remote Development using SSH](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/ssh)\n- [Developing inside a Container](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers)\n- [Developing in WSL](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/wsl)\n- [Tips, Tricks, and Troubleshooting](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/troubleshooting)\n\n## Releases\n\nVS Code Remote Development extension \"stable\" releases are tied directly to VS Code releases. Release highlights can be found in [VS Code release notes](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates) which will include a link to [detailed extension release notes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/tree/main/remote-release-notes). \n\nThe extensions are developed using the same [development process and schedule](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Development-Process#inside-an-iteration) as VS Code itself. You can see what is planned for the current development iteration in a pinned [planning issue in this repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues). This issue will include a link to the broader VS Code plan. As with VS Code itself, the extensions will update during a development iteration with changes that are only available in [VS Code Insiders Edition](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/).\n\n## Providing Feedback\n\nYou can use this repository to:\n- [Up-vote a feature or request a new one](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/feature-requests).\n- Search for [existing issues](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/issues) already reported for potential workarounds.\n- [Report a problem](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/issues/new) if you don't find what you are looking for.\n\nIf you have a question, connect with the community using any of these social platforms:\n\n[![Twitter](docs/images/Twitter_Social_Icon_24x24.png)](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/twitter) [![Stack Overflow](docs/images/so-image-24x24.png)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode) [![VS Code Dev Community Slack](docs/images/Slack_Mark-24x24.png)](https://aka.ms/vscode-dev-community) [![VS Code Gitter](docs/images/gitter-icon-24x24.png)](https://gitter.im/Microsoft/vscode)\n\nSee our [CONTRIBUTING](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/contributing) guide for more details.\n\n## License\n\nBy downloading and using the Visual Studio Remote Development extension pack and its related extensions, you agree to the product [license terms](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2077057) and [privacy statement](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement/EnterpriseDev/default.aspx).\n\nLicense for this repository:\n\nCopyright © Microsoft Corporation All rights reserved.<br />\nCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 License (International): https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode\n"
