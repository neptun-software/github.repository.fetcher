Fixing typos or rephrasing for better understanding DO NOT require\ndiscussion.\n\n## Branching Model\n\nThis repository holds two main branches with an infinite lifetime:\n\n* `master` is the default branch which always reflects the latest release.\n* `develop` is the main branch reflecting the latest delivered changes for the\n  next release. When the `develop` branch reaches a stable point and is ready to\n  be released, then all changes should be merged back into `master`.\n\nA variety of supporting branches are used to aid parallel development. These\nbranches have a limited lifespan, since they will be removed eventually.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions to this repository are welcome. For ease of managing, please\nfollow the steps below:\n\n1.  Fork this repository to your account.\n\n2.  Clone your copy of this repository, locally.\n\n    ```\n    git clone https://github.com/YOU/API-Security.git\n    ```\n\n3.  Create a new branch based on `develop` (e.g., `fix/foreword-section`).\n\n    ```\n    git checkout develop && git checkout -b fix/foreword-section\n    ```\n\n4.  Apply your changes.\n\n    Please, always follow our style conventions.\n\n\n    Although there's an [`.editorconfig` file][1] on repository's root, your\n    editor may not support it. To learn more about [EditorConfig][2] and text\n    editors/IDEs support, check the website: https://editorconfig.org/.\n    You can preview your changes, [rendering the web site locally][4].\n\n5.  Commit your changes.\n\n    1.  Check modified files and add only required ones (e.g., build artifacts\n        SHOULD NOT be tracked).\n    2.  The first line of the commit message should provide a brief description\n        of your changes. You can go into more details on the optional commit\n        message body.\n\n6.  Push changes to your public repository.\n\n    ```\n    git push origin fix/foreword-section\n    ```\n\n7.  Open a Pull Request from your `fix/foreword-section` to the upstream\n    repository `develop` branch.\n\n### Rendering the Web Site Locally\n\nThe web site is built using [Material for MkDocs][3] and several plugin.\nAlthough you can manually install everything, we've bundled everything into a\nDocker image that you can use to render the web site locally:\n\n```\ndocker compose up\n```\n\n[1]: https://github.com/OWASP/API-Security/blob/master/.editorconfig\n[2]: https://editorconfig.org/\n[3]: https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/\n[4]: #rendering-the-web-site-locally\n"

To the extent possible, if any provision of this\n    Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed\n    to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n    cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without\n    affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.  No term\n    or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply\n    consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.

          "content": "# OWASP API Security Top 10\n\nThis project is designed to address the ever-increasing number of organizations\nthat are deploying potentially sensitive APIs as part of their software\nofferings. These APIs are used for internal tasks and to interface with third\nparties. Unfortunately, many APIs do not undergo the rigorous security testing\nthat would help make them secure from an attack.\n\nThe OWASP API Security Project seeks to provide value to software developers and\nsecurity assessors by underscoring the potential risks in insecure APIs, and\nillustrating how these risks may be mitigated. In order to facilitate this goal,\nthe OWASP API Security Project will create and maintain a Top 10 API Security\nRisks document, as well as a documentation portal for best practices when\ncreating or assessing APIs.\n\n## Description\n\nWhile working as developers or information security consultants, many people\nhave encountered APIs as part of a project. While there are some resources to\nhelp create and evaluate these projects (such as the OWASP REST Security Cheat\nSheet), there has not be a comprehensive security project designed to assist\nbuilders, breakers, and defenders in the community.\n\nThis project aims to:\n\n* Create the OWASP Top Ten API Security Risks document, which can easily\n  underscore the most common risks in the area.\n* Create a documentation portal for developers to build APIs in a secure manner.\n* Work closely with the security community to maintain living documents that\n  evolve with security trends.\n\n## Project Leaders\n\n* [Erez Yalon][0]\n* [Inon Shkedy][5]\n* [Paulo Silva][6]\n\n## Licensing\n\n**The OWASP API Security Project documents are free to use!**\n\nThe OWASP API Security Project is licensed under the [Creative Commons\nAttribution-ShareAlike 4.0 license][1], so you can copy, distribute, and\ntransmit the work.
