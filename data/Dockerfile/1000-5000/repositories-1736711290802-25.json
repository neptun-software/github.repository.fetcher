          "content": "# SQL Server in Docker\n\nThis GitHub repository aims to provide a centralized location for community engagement. In here you will find documentation, Dockerfiles and additional developer resources. \n\n**SQL Server in Docker** comes in two different flavors:\n- [Linux-based containers](https://github.com/Microsoft/mssql-docker/tree/master/linux): This Docker image uses [SQL Server 2017 Developer Edition on Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/) on top of an Ubuntu 16.04 base image. This is meant to be run on [Docker Engine](https://www.docker.com/products/overview) on its multiple platforms.  There are also Dockerfiles here for building [RHEL](linux/preview/RHEL/Dockerfile) & [CentOS](linux/preview/CentOS/Dockerfile) based images.\n- [Windows-based containers](https://github.com/Microsoft/mssql-docker/tree/master/windows): These Docker images use SQL Server 2017 Express Edition and SQL Server 2017 Developer Edition. Both images are based on Windows Container technology and can only be run using [Docker Engine for Windows Containers](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/docker/configure_docker_daemon). You can currently sign-up for SQL Server 2019 on Windows Containers available in our [Early Adopter Preview](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2019/07/01/sql-server-2019-on-windows-containers-now-in-early-adopters-program/) program.\n\nBefore choosing to run a SQL Server container for production use cases, please review our [support policy](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4047326/support-policy-for-microsoft-sql-server) for SQL Server Containers to ensure that you are running on a supported configuration.\n\n**SQL Server Command Line Tools(sqlcmd,bcp)** are also available as a Docker Image. You can now deliver SQL Server management payload using this as a base image for your CI/CD scenarios. Check out the [mssql-tools Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/mssql-tools/) to get started.\n\n\nVisit the [Microsoft Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/u/microsoft) for more information and additional images.\n\n## Documentation\n- [Getting started guide for the SQL Server on Linux container](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/quickstart-install-connect-docker)\n- [Best practices guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-configure-docker)\n\n## Take our survey\n\nLet us know more about how you would like to use SQL containers by taking our [survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/XXSY536).\n\n## Issues\n\nFor any issues with the repo, please file under this GitHub project on the [Issues section](https://github.com/Microsoft/mssql-docker/issues).\n\nIf you require support with a production related issue, then please raise a support incident with Microsoft [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/hub/4343728/support-for-business).\n\nThere is also a [Gitter channel for SQL Server in DevOps](https://gitter.im/Microsoft/mssql-devops?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link) that you can join and discuss interesting topics with other container, SQL Server, and DevOps enthusiasts.\n\n## Troubleshooting & Frequently Asked Questions\n\n- \"Unknown blob\" error code: You are probably trying to run the Windows Containers-based Docker image on a Linux-based Docker Engine. If you want to continue running the Windows Container-based image, we recommend reading the following community article: [Run Linux and Windows Containers on Windows 10](https://stefanscherer.github.io/run-linux-and-windows-containers-on-windows-10/).\n\n- When using the Windows Docker CLI you must use double quotes instead of single ticks for the environment variables, else the mssql-server-linux image won't find the `ACCEPT_EULA` or `SA_PASSWORD` variables which are required to start the container.\n\n- The 'sa' password has a minimum complexity requirement (8 characters, uppercase, lowercase, alphanumerical and/or non-alphanumerical)\n\n- Licensing for SQL Server in Docker: Regardless of where you run it - VM, Docker, physical, cloud, on prem - the licensing model is the same and it depends on which edition of SQL Server you are using. The Express and Developer Editions are free. Standard and Enterprise have a cost. More information here: [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2016-editions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2016-editions)\n\n## License\n\nThe Docker resource files for SQL Server are licensed under the MIT license.  See the [LICENSE file](LICENSE) for more details.\n\n"
