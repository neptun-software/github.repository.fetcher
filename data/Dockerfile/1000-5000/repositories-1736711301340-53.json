If you need to \"pin\" the Docker image version you use, you can select one of those tags. E.g. `tiangolo/nginx-rtmp:latest-2020-08-16`.\n\n# nginx-rtmp\n\n[**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/) image with [**Nginx**](http://nginx.org/en/) using the [**nginx-rtmp-module**](https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module) module for live multimedia (video) streaming.\n\n## Description\n\nThis [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/) image can be used to create an RTMP server for multimedia / video streaming using [**Nginx**](http://nginx.org/en/) and [**nginx-rtmp-module**](https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module), built from the current latest sources (Nginx 1.15.0 and nginx-rtmp-module 1.2.1).\n\nThis was inspired by other similar previous images from [dvdgiessen](https://hub.docker.com/r/dvdgiessen/nginx-rtmp-docker/), [jasonrivers](https://hub.docker.com/r/jasonrivers/nginx-rtmp/), [aevumdecessus](https://hub.docker.com/r/aevumdecessus/docker-nginx-rtmp/) and by an [OBS Studio post](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/how-to-set-up-your-own-private-rtmp-server-using-nginx.50/).\n\nThe main purpose (and test case) to build it was to allow streaming from [**OBS Studio**](https://obsproject.com/) to different clients at the same time.\n\n**GitHub repo**: <https://github.com/tiangolo/nginx-rtmp-docker>\n\n**Docker Hub image**: <https://hub.docker.com/r/tiangolo/nginx-rtmp/>\n\n## Details\n\n## How to use\n\n* For the simplest case, just run a container with this image:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -d -p 1935:1935 --name nginx-rtmp tiangolo/nginx-rtmp\n```\n\n## How to test with OBS Studio and VLC\n\n* Run a container with the command above\n\n\n* Open [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/)\n* Click the \"Settings\" button\n* Go to the \"Stream\" section\n* In \"Stream Type\" select \"Custom Streaming Server\"\n* In the \"URL\" enter the `rtmp://<ip_of_host>/live` replacing `<ip_of_host>` with the IP of the host in which the container is running. For example: `rtmp://192.168.0.30/live`\n* In the \"Stream key\" use a \"key\" that will be used later in the client URL to display that specific stream. For example: `test`\n* Click the \"OK\" button\n* In the section \"Sources\" click the \"Add\" button (`+`) and select a source (for example \"Screen Capture\") and configure it as you need\n* Click the \"Start Streaming\" button\n\n\n* Open a [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) player (it also works in Raspberry Pi using `omxplayer`)\n* Click in the \"Media\" menu\n* Click in \"Open Network Stream\"\n* Enter the URL from above as `rtmp://<ip_of_host>/live/<key>` replacing `<ip_of_host>` with the IP of the host in which the container is running and `<key>` with the key you created in OBS Studio. For example: `rtmp://192.168.0.30/live/test`\n* Click \"Play\"\n* Now VLC should start playing whatever you are transmitting from OBS Studio\n\n## Debugging\n\nIf something is not working you can check the logs of the container with:\n\n```bash\ndocker logs nginx-rtmp\n```\n\n## Extending\n\nIf you need to modify the configurations you can create a file `nginx.conf` and replace the one in this image using a `Dockerfile` that is based on the image, for example:\n\n```Dockerfile\nFROM tiangolo/nginx-rtmp\n\nCOPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf\n```\n\nThe current `nginx.conf` contains:\n\n```Nginx\nworker_processes auto;\nrtmp_auto_push on;\nevents {}\nrtmp {\n    server {\n        listen 1935;\n        listen [::]:1935 ipv6only=on;\n\n        application live {\n            live on;\n            record off;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou can start from it and modify it as you need. Here's the [documentation related to `nginx-rtmp-module`](https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module/wiki/Directives).\n\n## Technical details\n\n* This image is built from the same base official images that most of the other official images, as Python, Node, Postgres, Nginx itself, etc. Specifically, [buildpack-deps](https://hub.docker.com/_/buildpack-deps/) which is in turn based on [debian](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian/). So, if you have any other image locally you probably have the base image layers already downloaded.\n\n* It is built from the official sources of **Nginx** and **nginx-rtmp-module** without adding anything else. (Surprisingly, most of the available images that include **nginx-rtmp-module** are made from different sources, old versions or add several other components).\n\n* It has a simple default configuration that should allow you to send one or more streams to it and have several clients receiving multiple copies of those streams simultaneously. (It includes `rtmp_auto_push` and an automatic number of worker processes).\n\n## Release Notes\n\n### Latest Changes\n\n#### Internal\n\n* ⬆ Bump tiangolo/issue-manager from 0.5.0 to 0.5.1.
