Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n    APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Slim images are images designed just for running an already built Swift program. Consequently, they do not contain the Swift compiler.\n\nThe normal and slim images can be combined via a multi-stage Dockerfile to produce a lighter-weight image ready for deployment. For example:\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM swift:latest as builder\nWORKDIR /root\nCOPY . .\nRUN swift build -c release\n\nFROM swift:slim\nWORKDIR /root\nCOPY --from=builder /root .\nCMD [\".build/release/docker-test\"]\n```\n\n## Contributing \nWelcome to the Swift community!\n\nContributions to swift-docker are welcomed and encouraged! Please see the [Contributing to Swift guide](swift.org/contributing) and check out the [structure of the community](https://www.swift.org/community/#community-structure).\n\nTo be a truly great community, Swift needs to welcome developers from all walks of life, with different backgrounds, and with a wide range of experience. A diverse and friendly community will have more great ideas, more unique perspectives, and produce more great code. We will work diligently to make the Swift community welcoming to everyone.\n\nTo give clarity of what is expected of our members, Swift has adopted the code of conduct defined by the Contributor Covenant. This document is used across many open source communities, and we think it articulates our values well. For more, see the [Code of Conduct](https://www.swift.org/code-of-conduct/).\n\n## License\n\nswift-docker is licensed under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](LICENSE.md).\n"
