          "content": "StatsD + Graphite + Grafana 4 + Kamon Dashboards\n---------------------------------------------\n\nThis image contains a sensible default configuration of StatsD, Graphite and Grafana, and comes bundled with a example\ndashboard that gives you the basic metrics currently collected by Kamon for both Actors and Traces. There are two ways\nfor using this image:\n\n\n### Using the Docker Index ###\n\nThis image is published under [Kamon's repository on the Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/kamon/) and all you\nneed as a prerequisite is having `docker`, `docker-compose`, and `make` installed on your machine. The container exposes the following ports:\n\n- `80`: the Grafana web interface.\n- `81`: the Graphite web port\n- `2003`: the Graphite data port\n- `8125`: the StatsD port.\n- `8126`: the StatsD administrative port.\n\nTo start a container with this image you just need to run the following command:\n\n```bash\n$ make up\n```\n\nTo stop the container\n```bash\n$ make down\n```\n\nTo run container's shell\n```bash\n$ make shell\n```\n\nTo view the container log\n```bash\n$ make tail\n```\n\nIf you already have services running on your host that are using any\nof these ports, you may wish to map the container ports to whatever\nyou want by changing left side number in the `--publish` parameters,\nor the 'ports' parameters in 'docker-compose.yml'. You can omit ports\nyou do not plan to use. Find more details about mapping ports in the\nDocker documentation on [Binding container ports to the\nhost](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/default_network/binding/)\nand [Legacy container\nlinks](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/default_network/dockerlinks/).\n\n\n### Building the image yourself ###\n\nThe Dockerfile and supporting configuration files are available in our [Github repository](https://github.com/kamon-io/docker-grafana-graphite).\nThis comes specially handy if you want to change any of the StatsD, Graphite or Grafana settings, or simply if you want\nto know how the image was built.\n\n\n### Using the Dashboards ###\n\nOnce your container is running all you need to do is:\n\n- open your browser pointing to http://localhost:80 (or another port if you changed it)\n  - Docker with VirtualBox on macOS: use `docker-machine ip` instead of `localhost`\n- login with the default username (admin) and password (admin)\n- open existing dashboard (or create a new one) and select 'Local Graphite' datasource\n- play with the dashboard at your wish...\n\n\n### Persisted Data ###\n\nWhen running `make up`, directories are created on your host and mounted into the Docker container, allowing graphite and grafana to persist data and settings between runs of the container.\n\n\n### Now go explore! ###\n\nWe hope that you have a lot of fun with this image and that it serves it's\npurpose of making your life easier. This should give you an idea of how the dashboard looks like when receiving data\nfrom one of our toy applications:\n\n![Kamon Dashboard](http://kamon.io/assets/img/kamon-statsd-grafana.png)\n![System Metrics Dashboard](http://kamon.io/assets/img/kamon-system-metrics.png)\n"
