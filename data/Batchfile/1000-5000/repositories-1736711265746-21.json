In addition, we have added a hash calculation step when the compilation is completed, and the result is printed in the log. This is unmodifiable and recorded in the release page. You can verify the hash value of the downloaded file against the log and release page.  \nOur project is absolutely pure and without any hidden features, and can withstand the scrutiny of all experts. If you have any good ideas, please feel free to communicate with us.  \n\n## We provide three operation modes: \n1. Run the start.bat script in the project to start directly with one click.\n2. Use the command line.\n3. Support running as a system service.\n\n### Command line startup:\ncmd startup: \n```shell\nredis-server.exe redis.conf\n```\npowershell startup: \n```shell\n./redis-server.exe redis.conf\n```\n\n### Service installation:\nCan achieve automatic startup on boot. Please run it as an administrator and change RedisService.exe to the actual directory where it is stored.\n```shell\nsc.exe create Redis binpath=C:\\Software\\Redis\\RedisService.exe start= auto\n```\nStart service\n```shell\nnet start Redis\n```\nOut of Service\n```shell\nnet stop Redis\n```\nUninstall service\n```shell\nsc.exe delete Redis\n```\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/515784/215540157-65f55297-cde2-49b3-8ab3-14dca7e11ee0.png)\n\n\nProject Home: https://github.com/redis-windows/redis-windows\n\n## Acknowledgement: \n[![NetEngine](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36178221?s=180&v=4)](https://www.zhihu.com/question/424272611/answer/2611312760) \n[![JetBrains Logo (Main) logo](https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/company/brand/logos/jb_beam.svg)](https://www.jetbrains.com/?from=redis-windows)\n\n\n## Disclaimer\nWe suggest that you use it for local development and follow Redis official guidance to deploy it on Linux for production environment.
