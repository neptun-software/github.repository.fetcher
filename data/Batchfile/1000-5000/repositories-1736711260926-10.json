We keep the rights to print a book based on the provided content. We can not ensure that everyone will be correctly named, but we will do our best. This is just so that you understand what you are about todo :-). \n\nStill interested? Cool. Welcome!\n\n## Issues\n\nEach chapter of the qmlbook (http://qmlbook.org) has several 'issue' reporting links. Please use these when you find a spelling error or another issue in the text. This will help us to identify the section later. The issue link will let you create or view the issues of this particular chapter.\n\nThe issues can be found at (https://github.com/qmlbook/qmlbook/issues)\n\n## Patch Contribution\n\nWe use the standard github pull requests for merging your fork of the book back to this one. You can find more information at (https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).\n\n## Chapter Contribution\n\nIf you feel adventurous enough to contribute a full chapter your name will then be placed in the chapter for your reference. For this create a new chapter folder (e.g. ch99) and write your content using the [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org) markup. We will then place the chapter into the chapter queue and when it's ready we will sort it into the table of contents.\n\n## Translations\n\nSo you speak something else then English? Great! Feel free to translate the book into your language. For this, clone the repository and then later create a pull request that we can sort this in. Before you start you should contact us on gitter to make sure there is no overlap.\n\nNote: The infrastructure is not yet there, but soon we should be ready for translations.\n\n// JRyannel, JThelin\n\n\n"

The\nfollowing considerations are for informational purposes only, are not\nexhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\n\n     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are\n     intended for use by those authorized to give the public\n     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by\n     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are\n     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms\n     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.\n     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before\n     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the\n     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any\n     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-\n     licensed material, or material used under an exception or\n     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:\n        wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors\n\n     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public\n     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the\n     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If\n     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for\n     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to\n     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our\n     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain\n     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of\n     the licensed material may still be restricted for other\n     reasons, including because others have copyright or other\n     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,\n     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.\n     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to\n     respect those requests where reasonable.

To the extent this Public License may be\ninterpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in\nconsideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the\nLicensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the\nLicensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under\nthese terms and conditions.\n\n\nSection 1 -- Definitions.\n\n  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar\n     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material\n     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,\n     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring\n     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the\n     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed\n     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,\n     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is\n     synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n\n  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright\n     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in\n     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n  c. BY-NC-SA Compatible License means a license listed at\n     creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses, approved by Creative\n     Commons as essentially the equivalent of this Public License.\n\n  d. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights\n     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,\n     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or\n     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights\n     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar\n     Rights.\n\n  e. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the\n     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws\n     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright\n     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international\n     agreements.\n\n  f. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or\n     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights\n     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\n  g.

The License Elements of this\n     Public License are Attribution, NonCommercial, and ShareAlike.\n\n  h. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,\n     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public\n     License.\n\n  i. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the\n     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to\n     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the\n     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\n\n  j. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights\n     under this Public License.\n\n  k. NonCommercial means not primarily intended for or directed towards\n     commercial advantage or monetary compensation. For purposes of\n     this Public License, the exchange of the Licensed Material for\n     other material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights by digital\n     file-sharing or similar means is NonCommercial provided there is\n     no payment of monetary compensation in connection with the\n     exchange.\n\n  l. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or\n     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such\n     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,\n     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material\n     available to the public including in ways that members of the\n     public may access the material from a place and at a time\n     individually chosen by them.\n\n  m. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright\n     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of\n     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,\n     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially\n     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\n\n  n. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights\n     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\n\n\nSection 2 -- Scope.\n\n  a. License grant.\n\n       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\n          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\n          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\n          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\n            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\n               in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and\n\n            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for\n               NonCommercial purposes only.\n\n       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n          its terms and conditions.\n\n       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n          6(a).\n\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n       5. Downstream recipients.\n\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\n            b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.\n               Every recipient of Adapted Material from You\n               automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to\n               exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material\n               under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.\n\n            c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n               Material.\n\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b. Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when\n          the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial\n          purposes.\n\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n  b. ShareAlike.\n\n     In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share\n     Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.\n\n       1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons\n          license with the same License Elements, this version or\n          later, or a BY-NC-SA Compatible License.\n\n       2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the\n          Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition\n          in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and\n          context in which You Share Adapted Material.\n\n       3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms\n          or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological\n          Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the\n          rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes\n     only;\n\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,\n     including for purposes of Section 3(b); and\n\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable.

It is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-Share Alike 4.0 license. We hope you enjoy it and we hope it helps you to learn Qt5.\n\nThe code examples are licensed under the BSD license. \n\n* Book License: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/\n* Source Code Examples License: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses\n\nDependencies\n============\n\n* git (http://git-scm.com/) - scm tool\n* sphinx (http://sphinx.pocoo.org/) - book engine\n    * sphinx-bootstrap-theme (https://github.com/ryan-roemer/sphinx-bootstrap-theme) - bootstrap HTML theme\n* graphviz (http://www.graphviz.org/) - diagram tool\n* shorty (https://github.com/qmlbook/shorty) - QML screenshot tool\n\nSetup\n=====\n\nIdeally you use a python virtual environment and install the dependencies their inside.\n\n    cd qmlbook\n    virtualenv -p python3 venv\n    source venv/bin/activate\n\nThis gives you a clean python3 setup. Now you need to install the dependencies:\n    \n    source venv/bin/activate\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\n\nThis will install all listed packages from the requirements document.\n\nFor rebuilding the documentation we also use a screen shot tool called shorty. It takes a screenshot from a running Qt application. To build it please clone the repo and build the tool with a decent Qt version.\n\n    git clone git@github.com:qmlbook/shorty.git\n    cd shorty\n    mkdir build && cd build\n    qmake .. && make\n\nMake sure shorty is on your search path, when \n\nBuilding\n========\n\nSimply use the `Makefile` provided. It supports a number of targets. We regularly build `html`, `singlehtml` and `latexpdf`, so these aught to work out of the box. The resulting files will end up in the `_build` directory.\n\nScreenshots\n===========\n\nScreenshots are used by the `screenshots.qml` files located inside each chapter directory. This relies on the `shorty` utility . Simply run `make-screenshots.sh` to automatically invoke `shorty` on all `screenshots.qml` files in the source tree.\n\nContributions\n=============\n\nWe greatly appreciate any contributions to this project. Feel free to submit pull requests with fixes or additional contents. When contributing, please add your name to the list of contributors in the `pages/contributors.rst` file. Also, if contributing a chapter, add your self as the `sectionauthor`.\n\nWe only accept contributions under a CLA, see `CONTRIBUTING.md`. This is because we, the original authors, want to ensure that we say yes if approached by someone willing to turn this material into a book made from dead trees.\n\nLicensing\n=========\n\nIn general, the text of this book is available under a Creative Commons \nAttribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0.

          "content": "The Travis Setup\n================\n\nThe QmlBook currently uses travis to build and deploy on each new commit to the project.\n\nThere is some logic in this setup and this document outlines the purpose of this logic.\n\n\n\nBranches\n========\n\nTravis is triggered on all branches. Depending on the name of the branch, the build is deployed or not.\n\n* The `master` branch is built and deployed to the root of the gh-pages.\n* Branches starting with `rel_` are build and deployed into a subdirectory named after the branch of the gh-pages.\n* All other branches are built but not deployed.\n\nAn example of a `rel_` branch would be `rel_5.12`. This branch would end up under `5.12/` in the gh-pages. This way, we can build and deploy multiple parallel releases.\n\nBranch Names and Travis\n-----------------------\n\nAs Travis has its own view on how to handle branches, we have to get the branch name using Travis if we detect that we are running in that environment. Otherwise we use `git` to find the name.\n\nMore info: https://graysonkoonce.com/getting-the-current-branch-name-during-a-pull-request-in-travis-ci/\n\nPull-requests\n-------------\n\nThe messed up branch / repo slug situation around pull requests means that we do not build pull requests due to the risk of accidentally overwriting something important. I guess a fix should go into `travis-setup.sh` if you are eager to help.\n\n\n\nLanguages\n=========\n\nWe plan to support languages later on, but right now we've reverted to only supporting the original English version.\n\nWhen supporting languages, they will add onother path under the branch paths as described above. E.g. `de/` and `5.12/de/`. English will stay in a path without a prefix.\n\n\n\nImplementation\n==============\n\nThe branch handling is done via `travis-setup.sh` which is _sourced_ first. It exports three environment variables:\n\n* `RELEASE_VERSION`, used in the build.\n* `IS_DEPLOYABLE`, used to to determine if the output should be deployed or not (based on the branch name).\n* `MOVE_TO`, used to determine if a specific build has to be moved (again, based on the branch name).\n* `DEPLOY_BRANCH`, branch to deploy to.\n* `DEPLOY_SLUG`, repo slug to deploy to.\n\nAfter this, Paver is used to build a release, including all assets and outputs (pdf, ePub, html, etc). This ends up in `_build/html`.\n\nThen a `.nojekyll` file is created from the script in `.travis.yml` to prevent GitHub Pages to be smart.\n\nFinally `travis-move.sh` is run. This script relies on the `MOVE_TO` environment variable and moves the contents of `_build/html/` to `_build/html/$MOVE_TO` if `MOVE_TO` is set.\n\nAfter that, the `deploy.on.condition` in `travis.yml` evaluates if the build is deployable and acts accordingly, relying on `DEPLOY_SLUG` and `DEPLOY_BRANCH`.\n"
