If you have no idea where to start, watching that video is a good first step.\n\n## Design principles\n\nSee [here](./VISION.md) for a set of design principles that we want to consider when building a feature or making a change.\n\n## Codebase guide\n\n[This doc](./docs/dev/Codebase_Guide.md) explains:\n* what the different packages in the codebase are for\n* where important files live\n* important concepts in the code\n* how the event loop works\n* other useful information\n\n## All code changes happen through Pull Requests\n\nPull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively\nwelcome your pull requests:\n\n1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.\n2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.\n3. If you've added code that need documentation, update the documentation.\n4. Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).\n5. Issue that pull request!\n\nPlease do not raise pull request from your fork's master branch: make a feature branch instead. Lazygit maintainers will sometimes push changes to your branch when reviewing a PR and we often can't do this if you use your master branch.\n\nIf you've never written Go in your life, then join the club! Lazygit was the maintainer's first Go program, and most contributors have never used Go before. Go is widely considered an easy-to-learn language, so if you're looking for an open source project to gain dev experience, you've come to the right place.\n\n## Running in a VSCode dev container\n\nIf you want to spare yourself the hassle of setting up your dev environment yourself (i.e. installing Go, extensions, and extra tools), you can run the Lazygit code in a VSCode dev container like so:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8456633/201500508-0d55f99f-5035-4a6f-a0f8-eaea5c003e5d.png)\n\nThis requires that:\n* you have docker installed\n* you have the dev containers extension installed in VSCode\n\nSee [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) for more info about dev containers.\n\n## Running in a Github Codespace\n\nIf you want to start contributing to Lazygit with the click of a button, you can open the lazygit codebase in a Codespace. First fork the repo, then click to create a codespace:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8456633/201500566-ffe9105d-6030-4cc7-a525-6570b0b413a2.png)\n\nTo run lazygit from within the integrated terminal just go `go run main.go`\n\nThis allows you to contribute to Lazygit without needing to install anything on your local machine. The Codespace has all the necessary tools and extensions pre-installed.\n\n## Code of conduct\n\nPlease note by participating in this project, you agree to abide by the [code of conduct].\n\n[code of conduct]: https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/blob/master/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md\n\n## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License\n\nIn short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be\nunder the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that\ncovers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.\n\n## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/issues)\n\nWe use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new\nissue](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/issues/new); it's that easy!\n\n## Go\n\nThis project is written in Go. Go is an opinionated language with strict idioms, but some of those idioms are a little extreme. Some things we do differently:\n\n1. There is no shame in using `self` as a receiver name in a struct method. In fact we encourage it\n2. There is no shame in prefixing an interface with 'I' instead of suffixing with 'er' when there are several methods on the interface.\n3. If a struct implements an interface, we make it explicit with something like:\n\n```go\nvar _ MyInterface = &MyStruct{}\n```\n\nThis makes the intent clearer and means that if we fail to satisfy the interface we'll get an error in the file that needs fixing.\n\n### Code Formatting\n\nTo check code formatting [gofumpt](https://pkg.go.dev/mvdan.cc/gofumpt#section-readme) (which is a bit stricter than [gofmt](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/gofmt)) is used.\nVSCode will format the code correctly if you tell the Go extension to use `gofumpt` via your [`settings.json`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings#_settingsjson)\nby setting [`formatting.gofumpt`](https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/doc/settings.md#gofumpt-bool) to `true`:\n\n```jsonc\n// .vscode/settings.json\n{\n  \"gopls\": {\n    \"formatting.gofumpt\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\nTo run gofumpt from your terminal go:\n\n```\ngo install mvdan.cc/gofumpt@latest && gofumpt -l -w .\n```\n\n## Programming Font\n\nLazygit supports [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com) to render certain icons. Sometimes we use some of these icons verbatim in string literals in the code (mainly in tests), so you need to set your development environment to use a nerd font to see these.\n\n## Internationalisation\n\nBoy that's a hard word to spell. Anyway, lazygit is translated into several languages within the pkg/i18n package. If you need to render text to the user, you should add a new field to the TranslationSet struct in `pkg/i18n/english.go` and add the actual content within the `EnglishTranslationSet()` method in the same file. Then you can access via `gui.Tr.YourNewText` (or `self.c.Tr.YourNewText`, etc). Although it is appreciated if you translate the text into other languages, it's not expected of you (google translate will likely do a bad job anyway!).\n\nNote, we use 'Sentence case' for everything (so no 'Title Case' or 'whatever-it's-called-when-there's-no-capital-letters-case')\n\n## Debugging\n\nThe easiest way to debug lazygit is to have two terminal tabs open at once: one for running lazygit (via `go run main.go -debug` in the project root) and one for viewing lazygit's logs (which can be done via `go run main.go --logs` or just `lazygit --logs`).\n\nFrom most places in the codebase you have access to a logger e.g. `gui.Log.Warn(\"blah\")` or `self.c.Log.Warn(\"blah\")`.\n\nIf you find that the existing logs are too noisy, you can set the log level with e.g. `LOG_LEVEL=warn go run main.go -debug` and then only use `Warn` logs yourself.\n\nIf you need to log from code in the vendor directory (e.g. the `gocui` package), you won't have access to the logger, but you can easily add logging support by setting the `LAZYGIT_LOG_PATH` environment variable and using `logs.Global.Warn(\"blah\")`. This is a global logger that's only intended for development purposes.\n\nIf you keep having to do some setup steps to reproduce an issue, read the Testing section below to see how to create an integration test by recording a lazygit session. It's pretty easy!\n\n### VSCode debugger\n\nIf you want to trigger a debug session from VSCode, you can use the following snippet. Note that the `console` key is, at the time of writing, still an experimental feature.\n\n```jsonc\n// .vscode/launch.json\n{\n  \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n  \"configurations\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"debug lazygit\",\n      \"type\": \"go\",\n      \"request\": \"launch\",\n      \"mode\": \"auto\",\n      \"program\": \"main.go\",\n      \"args\": [\"--debug\"],\n      \"console\": \"externalTerminal\" // <-- you need this to actually see the lazygit UI in a window while debugging\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Profiling\n\nIf you want to investigate what's contributing to CPU or memory usage, see [this separate document](docs/dev/Profiling.md).\n\n## Testing\n\nLazygit has two kinds of tests: unit tests and integration tests. Unit tests go in files that end in `_test.go`, and are written in Go. For integration tests, see [here](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/blob/master/pkg/integration/README.md)\n\n## Updating Gocui\n\nSometimes you will need to make a change in the gocui fork (https://github.com/jesseduffield/gocui). Gocui is the package responsible for rendering windows and handling user input. Here's the typical process to follow:\n\n1. Make the changes in gocui inside lazygit's vendor directory so it's easy to test against lazygit\n2. Copy the changes over to the actual gocui repo (clone it if you haven't already, and use the `awesome` branch, not `master`)\n3. Raise a PR on the gocui repo with your changes\n4. After that PR is merged, make a PR in lazygit bumping the gocui version. You can bump the version by running the following at the lazygit repo root:\n\n```sh\n./scripts/bump_gocui.sh\n```\n\n5. Raise a PR in lazygit with those changes\n\n## Updating Lazycore\n\n[Lazycore](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazycore) is a repo containing shared functionality between lazygit and lazydocker. Sometimes you will need to make a change to that repo and import the changes into lazygit. Similar to updating Gocui, here's what you do:\n\n1. Make the changes in lazycore inside lazygit's vendor directory so it's easy to test against lazygit\n2. Copy the changes over to the actual lazycore repo (clone it if you haven't already, and use the `master` branch)\n3. Raise a PR on the lazycore repo with your changes\n4. After that PR is merged, make a PR in lazygit bumping the lazycore version. You can bump the version by running the following at the lazygit repo root:\n\n```sh\n./scripts/bump_lazycore.sh\n```\n\nOr if you're using VSCode, there is a bump lazycore task you can find by going `cmd+shift+p` and typing 'Run task'\n\n5. Raise a PR in lazygit with those changes\n\n## Improvements\n\nIf you can think of any way to improve these docs let us know.\n"

that power when everything is so damn hard to do? Interactive rebasing requires you to edit a goddamn TODO file in your editor? _Are you kidding me?_ To stage part of a file you need to use a command line program to step through each hunk and if a hunk can't be split down any further but contains code you don't want to stage, you have to edit an arcane patch file _by hand_? _Are you KIDDING me?!_ Sometimes you get asked to stash your changes when switching branches only to realise that after you switch and unstash that there weren't even any conflicts and it would have been fine to just checkout the branch directly? _YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!_\n\nIf you're a mere mortal like me and you're tired of hearing how powerful git is when in your daily life it's a powerful pain in your ass, lazygit might be for you.\n\n## Table of contents\n\n- [Sponsors](#sponsors)\n- [Elevator Pitch](#elevator-pitch)\n- [Table of contents](#table-of-contents)\n- [Features](#features)\n  - [Stage individual lines](#stage-individual-lines)\n  - [Interactive Rebase](#interactive-rebase)\n  - [Cherry-pick](#cherry-pick)\n  - [Bisect](#bisect)\n  - [Nuke the working tree](#nuke-the-working-tree)\n  - [Amend an old commit](#amend-an-old-commit)\n  - [Filter](#filter)\n  - [Invoke a custom command](#invoke-a-custom-command)\n  - [Worktrees](#worktrees)\n  - [Rebase magic (custom patches)](#rebase-magic-custom-patches)\n  - [Rebase from marked base commit](#rebase-from-marked-base-commit)\n  - [Undo](#undo)\n  - [Commit graph](#commit-graph)\n  - [Compare two commits](#compare-two-commits)\n- [Tutorials](#tutorials)\n- [Installation](#installation)\n  - [Binary Releases](#binary-releases)\n  - [Homebrew](#homebrew)\n  - [MacPorts](#macports)\n  - [Void Linux](#void-linux)\n  - [Scoop (Windows)](#scoop-windows)\n  - [Arch Linux](#arch-linux)\n  - [Fedora and RHEL](#fedora-and-rhel)\n  - [Solus Linux](#solus-linux)\n  - [Ubuntu](#ubuntu)\n  - [Funtoo Linux](#funtoo-linux)\n  - [Gentoo Linux](#gentoo-linux)\n  - [FreeBSD](#freebsd)\n  - [Termux](#termux)\n  - [Conda](#conda)\n  - [Go](#go)\n  - [Chocolatey (Windows)](#chocolatey-windows)\n  - [Winget (Windows 10 1709 or later)](#winget-windows-10-1709-or-later)\n  - [Manual](#manual)\n- [Usage](#usage)\n  - [Keybindings](#keybindings)\n  - [Changing Directory On Exit](#changing-directory-on-exit)\n  - [Undo/Redo](#undoredo)\n- [Configuration](#configuration)\n  - [Custom Pagers](#custom-pagers)\n  - [Custom Commands](#custom-commands)\n  - [Git flow support](#git-flow-support)\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\n  - [Debugging Locally](#debugging-locally)\n- [Donate](#donate)\n- [FAQ](#faq)\n  - [What do the commit colors represent?](#what-do-the-commit-colors-represent)\n- [Shameless Plug](#shameless-plug)\n- [Alternatives](#alternatives)\n\nLazygit is not my fulltime job but it is a hefty part time job so if you want to support the project please consider [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/jesseduffield)\n\n## Features\n\n### Stage individual lines\n\nPress space on the selected line to stage it, or press `v` to start selecting a range of lines. You can also press `a` to select the entirety of the current hunk.\n\n![stage_lines](../assets/demo/stage_lines-compressed.gif)\n\n### Interactive Rebase\n\nPress `i` to start an interactive rebase. Then squash (`s`), fixup (`f`), drop (`d`), edit (`e`), move up (`ctrl+i`) or move down (`ctrl+j`) any of TODO commits, before continuing the rebase by bringing up the rebase options menu with `m` and then selecting `continue`.\n\nYou can also perform any these actions as a once-off (e.g. pressing `s` on a commit to squash it) without explicitly starting a rebase.\n\nThis demo also uses shift+down to select a range of commits to move and fixup.\n\n![interactive_rebase](../assets/demo/interactive_rebase-compressed.gif)\n\n### Cherry-pick\n\nPress `shift+c` on a commit to copy it and press `shift+v` to paste (cherry-pick) it.\n\n![cherry_pick](../assets/demo/cherry_pick-compressed.gif)\n\n### Bisect\n\nPress `b` in the commits view to mark a commit as good/bad in order to begin a git bisect.\n\n![bisect](../assets/demo/bisect-compressed.gif)\n\n### Nuke the working tree\n\nFor when you really want to just get rid of anything that shows up when you run `git status` (and yes that includes dirty submodules) [kidpix style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur7_A4JusMU), press `shift+d` to bring up the reset options menu and then select the 'nuke' option.\n\n![Nuke working tree](../assets/demo/nuke_working_tree-compressed.gif)\n\n### Amend an old commit\n\nPressing `shift+a` on any commit will amend that commit with the currently staged changes (running an interactive rebase in the background).\n\n![amend_old_commit](../assets/demo/amend_old_commit-compressed.gif)\n\n### Filter\n\nYou can filter a view with `/`. Here we filter down our branches view and then hit `enter` to view its commits.\n\n![filter](../assets/demo/filter-compressed.gif)\n\n### Invoke a custom command\n\nLazygit has a very flexible [custom command system](docs/Custom_Command_Keybindings.md). In this example a custom command is defined which emulates the built-in branch checkout action.\n\n![custom_command](../assets/demo/custom_command-compressed.gif)\n\n### Worktrees\n\nYou can create worktrees to have multiple branches going at once without the need for stashing or creating WIP commits when switching between them. Press `w` in the branches view to create a worktree from the selected branch and switch to it.\n\n![worktree_create_from_branches](../assets/demo/worktree_create_from_branches-compressed.gif)\n\n### Rebase magic (custom patches)\n\nYou can build a custom patch from an old commit and then remove the patch from the commit, split out a new commit, apply the patch in reverse to the index, and more.\n\nIn this example we have a redundant comment that we want to remove from an old commit. We hit `<enter>` on the commit to view its files, then `<enter>` on a file to focus the patch, then `<space>` to add the comment line to our custom patch, and then `ctrl+p` to view the custom patch options; selecting to remove the patch from the current commit.\n\nLearn more in the [Rebase magic Youtube tutorial](https://youtu.be/4XaToVut_hs).\n\n![custom_patch](../assets/demo/custom_patch-compressed.gif)\n\n### Rebase from marked base commit\n\nSay you're on a feature branch that was itself branched off of the develop branch, and you've decided you'd rather be branching off the master branch. You need a way to rebase only the commits from your feature branch. In this demo we check to see which was the last commit on the develop branch, then press `shift+b` to mark that commit as our base commit, then press `r` on the master branch to rebase onto it, only bringing across the commits from our feature branch. Then we push our changes with `shift+p`.\n\n![rebase_onto](../assets/demo/rebase_onto-compressed.gif)\n\n### Undo\n\nYou can undo the last action by pressing 'z' and redo with `ctrl+z`. Here we drop a couple of commits and then undo the actions.\nUndo uses the reflog which is specific to commits and branches so we can't undo changes to the working tree or stash.\n\n[More info](/docs/Undoing.md)\n\n![undo](../assets/demo/undo-compressed.gif)\n\n### Commit graph\n\nWhen viewing the commit graph in an enlarged window (use `+` and `_` to cycle window sizes), the commit graph is shown. Colours correspond to the commit authors, and as you navigate down the graph, the parent commits of the selected commit are highlighted.\n\n![commit_graph](../assets/demo/commit_graph-compressed.gif)\n\n### Compare two commits\n\nIf you press `shift+w` on a commit (or branch/ref) a menu will open that allows you to mark that commit so that any other commit you select will be diffed against it. Once you've selected the second commit, you'll see the diff in the main view and if you press `<enter>` you'll see the files of the diff. You can press `shift+w` to view the diff menu again to see options like reversing the diff direction or exiting diff mode. You can also exit diff mode by pressing `<escape>`.\n\n![diff_commits](../assets/demo/diff_commits-compressed.gif)\n\n## Tutorials\n\n[<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/sVEktDn.png\">](https://youtu.be/CPLdltN7wgE)\n\n- [15 Lazygit Features in 15 Minutes](https://youtu.be/CPLdltN7wgE)\n- [Basics Tutorial](https://youtu.be/VDXvbHZYeKY)\n- [Rebase Magic Tutorial](https://youtu.be/4XaToVut_hs)\n\n## Installation\n\n[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/lazygit.svg?columns=3)](https://repology.org/project/lazygit/versions)\n\n_Most of the above packages are maintained by third parties so be sure to vet them yourself and confirm that the maintainer is a trustworthy looking person who attends local sports games and gives back to their communities with barbeque fundraisers etc_\n\n### Binary Releases\n\nFor Windows, Mac OS(10.12+) or Linux, you can download a binary release [here](../../releases).\n\n### Homebrew\n\nNormally the lazygit formula can be found in the Homebrew core but we suggest you tap our formula to get the frequently updated one. It works with Linux, too.\n\nTap:\n\n```\nbrew install jesseduffield/lazygit/lazygit\n```\n\nCore:\n\n```\nbrew install lazygit\n```\n\n### MacPorts\n\nLatest version built from github releases.\nTap:\n\n```\nsudo port install lazygit\n```\n\n### Void Linux\n\nPackages for Void Linux are available in the distro repo\n\nThey follow upstream latest releases\n\n```sh\nsudo xbps-install -S lazygit\n```\n\n### Scoop (Windows)\n\nYou can install `lazygit` using [scoop](https://scoop.sh/). It's in the `extras` bucket:\n\n```sh\n# Add the extras bucket\nscoop bucket add extras\n\n# Install lazygit\nscoop install lazygit\n```\n\n### Arch Linux\n\nPackages for Arch Linux are available via pacman and AUR (Arch User Repository).\n\nThere are two packages. The stable one which is built with the latest release\nand the git version which builds from the most recent commit.\n\n- Stable: `sudo pacman -S lazygit`\n- Development: <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lazygit-git/>\n\nInstruction of how to install AUR content can be found here:\n<https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository>\n\n### Fedora and RHEL\n\nPackages for Fedora/RHEL and CentOS Stream are available via [Copr](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/atim/lazygit/) (Cool Other Package Repo).\n\n```sh\nsudo dnf copr enable atim/lazygit -y\nsudo dnf install lazygit\n```\n\n### Solus Linux\n\n```sh\nsudo eopkg install lazygit\n```\n\n### Ubuntu\n\n```sh\nLAZYGIT_VERSION=$(curl -s \"https://api.github.com/repos/jesseduffield/lazygit/releases/latest\" | \\grep -Po '\"tag_name\": *\"v\\K[^\"]*')\ncurl -Lo lazygit.tar.gz \"https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/releases/download/v${LAZYGIT_VERSION}/lazygit_${LAZYGIT_VERSION}_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz\"\ntar xf lazygit.tar.gz lazygit\nsudo install lazygit -D -t /usr/local/bin/\n```\n\nVerify the correct installation of lazygit:\n\n```sh\nlazygit --version\n```\n\n### Funtoo Linux\n\nFuntoo Linux has an autogenerated lazygit package in [dev-kit](https://github.com/funtoo/dev-kit/tree/1.4-release/dev-vcs/lazygit):\n\n```sh\nsudo emerge dev-vcs/lazygit\n```\n\n### Gentoo Linux\n\nLazygit is not (yet) in main Gentoo portage, however an ebuild is available in [GURU overlay](https://github.com/gentoo-mirror/guru/tree/master/dev-vcs/lazygit)\n\nYou can either add the overlay to your system and install lazygit as usual:\n\n```sh\nsudo eselect repository enable guru\nsudo emaint sync -r guru\nsudo emerge dev-vcs/lazygit\n```\n\n### openSUSE\n\nThe lazygit package is currently built in [devel:languages:go/lazygit](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/devel:languages:go/lazygit).\n\nTo install lazygit on openSUSE Tumbleweed run:\n\n```sh\nsudo zypper ar https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/languages:/go/openSUSE_Factory/devel:languages:go.repo\nsudo zypper ref && sudo zypper in lazygit\n```\n\nTo install lazygit on openSUSE Leap run:\n\n```sh\nsource /etc/os-release\nsudo zypper ar https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/languages:/go/$VERSION_ID/devel:languages:go.repo\nsudo zypper ref && sudo zypper in lazygit\n```\n\n### NixOs\n\nOn NixOs lazygit is packaged with nix and distributed via nixpkgs.\nYou can try the lazygit without installing it with:\n\n```sh\nnix-shell -p lazygit\n# or with flakes enabled\nnix run nixpkgs#lazygit\n```\n\nOr you can add lazygit to you `configuration.nix` using the `environment.systemPackages` option.\nMore details can be found via NixOs search [page](https://search.nixos.org/).\n\n### Flox\n\nLazygit can be installed into a Flox environment as follows.\n\n```sh\nflox install lazygit\n```\n\nMore details about Flox can be found on [their website](https://flox.dev/).\n\n### FreeBSD\n\n```sh\npkg install lazygit\n```\n\n### Termux\n\n```sh\napt install lazygit\n```\n\n### Conda\n\nReleased versions are available for different platforms, see <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/lazygit>\n\n```sh\nconda install -c conda-forge lazygit\n```\n\n### Go\n\n```sh\ngo install github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit@latest\n```\n\nPlease note:\nIf you get an error claiming that lazygit cannot be found or is not defined, you\nmay need to add `~/go/bin` to your $PATH (MacOS/Linux), or `%HOME%\\go\\bin`\n(Windows). Not to be mistaken for `C:\\Go\\bin` (which is for Go's own binaries,\nnot apps like lazygit).\n\n### Chocolatey (Windows)\n\nYou can install `lazygit` using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/):\n\n```sh\nchoco install lazygit\n```\n\n### Winget (Windows 10 1709 or later)\n\nYou can install `lazygit` using the `winget` command in the Windows Terminal with the following command:\n\n```powershell\nwinget install -e --id=JesseDuffield.lazygit\n```\n\n### Manual\n\nYou'll need to [install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit.git\ncd lazygit\ngo install\n```\n\nYou can also use `go run main.go` to compile and run in one go (pun definitely intended)\n\n## Usage\n\nCall `lazygit` in your terminal inside a git repository.\n\n```sh\n$ lazygit\n```\n\nIf you want, you can\nalso add an alias for this with `echo \"alias lg='lazygit'\" >> ~/.zshrc` (or\nwhichever rc file you're using).\n\n### Keybindings\n\nYou can check out the list of keybindings [here](/docs/keybindings).\n\n### Changing Directory On Exit\n\nIf you change repos in lazygit and want your shell to change directory into that repo on exiting lazygit, add this to your `~/.zshrc` (or other rc file):\n\n```\nlg()\n{\n    export LAZYGIT_NEW_DIR_FILE=~/.lazygit/newdir\n\n    lazygit \"$@\"\n\n    if [ -f $LAZYGIT_NEW_DIR_FILE ]; then\n            cd \"$(cat $LAZYGIT_NEW_DIR_FILE)\"\n            rm -f $LAZYGIT_NEW_DIR_FILE > /dev/null\n    fi\n}\n```\n\nThen `source ~/.zshrc` and from now on when you call `lg` and exit you'll switch directories to whatever you were in inside lazygit. To override this behaviour you can exit using `shift+Q` rather than just `q`.\n\n### Undo/Redo\n\nSee the [docs](/docs/Undoing.md)\n\n## Configuration\n\nCheck out the [configuration docs](docs/Config.md).\n\n### Custom Pagers\n\nSee the [docs](docs/Custom_Pagers.md)\n\n### Custom Commands\n\nIf lazygit is missing a feature, there's a good chance you can implement it yourself with a custom command!\n\nSee the [docs](docs/Custom_Command_Keybindings.md)\n\n### Git flow support\n\nLazygit supports [Gitflow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) if you have it installed. To understand how the Gitflow model works check out Vincent Driessen's original [post](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) explaining it. To view Gitflow options from within Lazygit, press `i` from within the branches view.\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe love your input!

          "size": 4.9,
          "content": "# Vision and Design Principles\n\n## Vision\n\nLazygit's vision is to be the most enjoyable UI for git.\n\n## Design Principles\n\nThere are seven (sometimes contradictory) design principles we follow:\n\n- Dicoverability\n- Simplicity\n- Safety\n- Power\n- Speed\n- Conformity with git\n- Think of the codebase\n\n### Discoverability\n\nTUI's are notoriously hard to learn, thanks to limited screen real-estate to provide contextual help and a general lack of effort on the part of developers to make things obvious. We want Lazygit to buck the trend and be easy for a new user to grok.\n\nExamples:\n\n- Clearly document all the features/configuration options\n  - e.g. gifs in the README\n- Document how to solve various git problems with Lazygit\n  - This is something we don't have yet but should: a section in the docs explaining how Lazygit can help you in various scenarios\n- Use tooltips to explain what actions will do\n- Make it easy for users to ask questions and get answers from the community\n- Make it easy to find entities and actions from within Lazygit\n- Use visual elements to make things obvious\n  - e.g. '<-- YOU ARE HERE' label when rebasing\n- Don't require the user to memorise keybindings\n  - e.g. when the user is mid-rebase, we prominently show that the keybinding for viewing rebase options is 'm'\n- When the user performs an action in Lazygit, make the impact obvious\n  - If the affected entity isn't visible, show a toast notification\n- If a keybinding is disabled, give a reason why\n\n### Simplicity\n\nThe git CLI is very complex but most git use cases are simple. Lazygit needs to ensure that simple use cases are easy to satisfy.\n\n- Make the most common use cases dead-simple (staging files, committing, pulling/pushing)\n- Don't overwhelm the user with options\n- Use sensible defaults\n- We already have too many configuration options: think hard before adding any new ones\n\n### Safety\n\nIt's easy to screw things up in git so Lazygit should try to protect the user from screwing things up.\n\n- Prompt for a confirmation before doing anything that's hard to reverse\n- Make it easy to correct mistakes\n  - e.g. undo action\n  - the escape key should get you out of most transient situations (rebasing, diffing, etc)\n\n## Power\n\nUsers shouldn't have to drop down the CLI _too_ often. Lazygit should be able to handle some complex use cases.\n\n- Make complex (but common) CLI flows simple\n  - e.g. interactive rebasing\n- Use the custom commands system to handle the really rare complex edge-cases\n\n### Speed\n\nPro users should be able to move at lightning speed with Lazygit.\n\n- Always think about the number of keypresses involved in a given UX flow\n- Make lazygit performant and responsive\n- Think about the individual commands being run and how fast they are\n- Startup should be FAST. If you want to run something at startup that is slow, make it non-blocking.\n- Support muscle-memory\n  - Prefer disabling menu items instead of hiding them so that muscle memory can be used to select the desired menu item\n  - Try to make keybinding intuitions to transfer across contexts (e.g. 'd' for destroy)\n  - When changing keybindings in a new release, always consider what will happen if a user does not read the release notes and relies on muscle memory.\n\n### Conformity with git\n\nSatisfying the use-cases of git users is more important than perfectly conforming to git's API, but even obscure parts of git's API were motivated by real use-cases.\n\n- Users should only have to drop down to the git CLI in rare circumstances\n- Honour the git config\n  - Don't override anything set in the git config without the user's permission\n- Work with git, not against it.\n  - Too much magic will get us into trouble\n- Avoid storing Lazygit-specific session state that could instead be stored in git\n- Ensure that Lazygit can represent the state of any repo\n- Sometimes git's default behaviour is just silly and we'll make the call to override but it should be a well-considered decision.\n\n### Think of the codebase\n\nWill somebody PLEASE think of the codebase!\n\nSome features are not worth the added complexity in the codebase. The more this codebase grows, the harder it will be to make the changes that everybody wants.\n\n## Resolving conflicts\n\nMany of the above objectives are directly antithetical to one another. If you add an extra confirmation prompt for the sake of _safety_, you're sacrificing _speed_. If you support toggling various git flags in the name of _power_, you're sacrificing _simplicity_. There are a few things to say here.\n\nWhen there are conflicts, we need to make a judgement call. In general we should err on the side of safety and simplicity as the default, with the ability for users to make things faster / more powerful either through configuration or separate keybindings.\n\nThis does not mean for example that force pushes should be impossible without being manually enabled: force pushes are table stakes for anybody who rebases. But it does mean that a confirmation popup should appear when force pushing.\n"
