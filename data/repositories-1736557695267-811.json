JIT on iOS devices require either a jailbroken device, or one of the various workarounds found for specific versions of iOS (see \"Install\" for more details).\n\nUTM SE (\"slow edition\") uses a [threaded interpreter][3] which performs better than a traditional interpreter but still slower than JIT. This technique is similar to what [iSH][4] does for dynamic execution. As a result, UTM SE does not require jailbreaking or any JIT workarounds and can be sideloaded as a regular app.\n\nTo optimize for size and build times, only the following architectures are included in UTM SE: ARM, PPC, RISC-V, and x86 (all with both 32-bit and 64-bit variants).\n\n## Install\n\nUTM (SE) for iOS: https://getutm.app/install/\n\nUTM is also available for macOS: https://mac.getutm.app/\n\n## Development\n\n### [macOS Development](Documentation/MacDevelopment.md)\n\n### [iOS Development](Documentation/iOSDevelopment.md)\n\n## Related\n\n* [iSH][4]: emulates a usermode Linux terminal interface for running x86 Linux applications on iOS\n* [a-shell][5]: packages common Unix commands and utilities built natively for iOS and accessible through a terminal interface\n\n## License\n\nUTM is distributed under the permissive Apache 2.0 license.

Чтобы запустить UTM, можно воспользоваться джейлбрейком или — для некоторых версий iOS — одним из обходных путей (см. раздел «Установка»).\n\nUTM SE (“slow edition”) использует [поточный интерпретатор](https://github.com/ktemkin/qemu/blob/with_tcti/tcg/aarch64-tcti/README.md), который работает быстрее традиционного, но всё же медленнее JIT. Подобный подход используется в проекте [iSH](https://github.com/ish-app/ish) для динамического исполнения. В результате версия UTM SE не требует джейлбрейк или прочие хаки и может быть установлена как любое другое приложение.\n\nЧтобы оптимизировать время сборки и размер приложения, UTM SE поддерживает только x86, ARM, PowerPC и RISC-V (все — в 32- и 64-битном вариантах).\n\n## Установка\n\n* [UTM для macOS](https://mac.getutm.app/)\n* [UTM (SE) для iOS](https://getutm.app/install/)\n\n## Разработка\n\n* [UTM для macOS](Documentation/MacDevelopment.md)\n* [UTM для iOS](Documentation/iOSDevelopment.md)\n\n## Лицензии\n\nUTM распространяется по лицензии Apache 2.0.\n\nОднако некоторые компоненты проекта используют более строгие лицензии из группы (L)GPL.

Для використання JIT на пристроях iOS потрібно мати пристрій з джейлбрейком або використовувати один з обхідних шляхів, які були знайдені для певних версій iOS (детальніше дивіться в розділі \"Встановлення\").\n\nUTM SE (\"повільна версія\") використовує [потіковий інтерпретатор][3], який працює краще, ніж традиційний інтерпретатор, але все ще повільніший, ніж JIT. Ця техніка схожа на те, що робить [iSH][4] для динамічного виконання. В результаті, UTM SE не потребує джейлбрейка або будь-яких обходів JIT і може бути завантажений як звичайний додаток.\n\nДля оптимізації розміру та часу збірки до UTM SE включено лише наступні архітектури: ARM, PPC, RISC-V та x86 (всі з 32-розрядними та 64-розрядними варіантами).\n\n## Встановлення\n\nUTM (SE) для iOS: https://getutm.app/install/\n\nUTM також доступний для macOS: https://mac.getutm.app/\n\n## Розробка\n\n### [macOS розробка](Documentation/MacDevelopment.md)\n\n### [iOS розробка](Documentation/iOSDevelopment.md)\n\n## Пов'язані\n\n* [iSH][4]: емулює інтерфейс терміналу користувача Linux для запуску додатків Linux x86 на iOS\n* [a-shell][5]: упаковує загальні команди та утиліти Unix, побудовані нативно для iOS та доступні через інтерфейс терміналу\n\n## Ліцензія\n\nUTM розповсюджується на умовах ліцензії Apache 2.0, однак він використовує декілька компонентів (L)GPL.
