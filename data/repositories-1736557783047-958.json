(cc9b6b3, #3837)\r\n* Start10: Fixed an issue where the resource loader failed when the drive letter of the boot drive is other than C:. Thanks @ittrgrey for pointing out! (fc25c25)\r\n* Start10: Fixed an issue where the Start menu crashes when summoning the context menu of an item that has jump list entries on builds 226xx.4391+ and 261xx.2130+. (4978024, #3842)\r\n* ep_taskbar: Fixed an issue where \"Not responding\" windows are not handled properly.\r\n* ep_taskbar: Flashing taskbar items are now animated.\r\n* ep_taskbar: Narrator now describes the \"Show desktop\" button.\r\n* ep_taskbar: `TrayUI` class is now exported.\r\n* Localization: Added translations for Portuguese (Brazil). Thanks @thiagojramos!\r\n\r\n## 22621.3880.66\r\n\r\nTested on OS builds 19045.4598, 22621.3296, 22621.3810, 26120.961, and 26244.5000. (Note: 22621 and 22631 share the same OS files)\r\n\r\n##### 1\r\n\r\n* Taskbar10: Introduced a new taskbar implementation: Windows 10 (ExplorerPatcher). (146070d, 0b86e55)\r\n  * You can try this implementation out by changing the \"Taskbar style\" to \"Windows 10 (ExplorerPatcher)\".\r\n  * For now, this is **only available for builds 22621, 22631, and 22635.** Other builds will not have the option.\r\n  * Refer to [this wiki article](https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher/wiki/ExplorerPatcher's-taskbar-implementation) for more information including important ones.\r\n\r\n##### 2\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n* Taskbar10: Due to false positive antivirus detections, the new taskbar implementation is no longer bundled in the setup program. (48c2a75)\r\n  * If you want to use the new taskbar implementation, you can download the appropriate DLL for your system from the [Releases](https://github.com/ExplorerPatcher/ep_taskbar_releases/releases/latest) page of its releases repository, and then manually putting it in `C:\\Program Files\\ExplorerPatcher` without the architecture specifier.\r\n  * For example, for 226xx builds on x64-based systems, download `ep_taskbar.2.amd64.dll`, rename to `ep_taskbar.2.dll`, and lastly put it in `C:\\Program Files\\ExplorerPatcher`.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n##### 3\r\n\r\n* Introduced support for ARM64 devices. (992b3a6, 2e4e4f5, b76c0e4, c9884b2, 57f63ad, 78788ec, 4799b4b, 5d0d218)\r\n  * These builds are only tested on and made to work with 24H2 ARM64 builds. Older ARM64 Windows versions than 24H2 may not work as expected.\r\n* Added an \"Update now\" button into update notifications for easier updating. (2b9c747, 8c16a9a)\r\n* Revised how files are packed in ep_setup for smaller size and easier maintenance. (30579b0, b253625, 04fd2b7, db54ce9, 126c024, c0201ff)\r\n* EP's taskbar implementation for 24H2 is now available in [its releases repository](https://github.com/ExplorerPatcher/ep_taskbar_releases/releases/latest), as `ep_taskbar.5.dll`. If you want to try this out, follow the steps explained above.\r\n\r\n##### 4\r\n\r\nWith this update, ExplorerPatcher is now officially compatible and supported on Windows 11 24H2 🥳🎉\r\n\r\n* Start10: Now works again on 24H2 and 226xx.3930+. (755f101, 7e0f7eb, b473114)\r\n* Taskbar10: EP's taskbar DLLs are now included again in the setup files. (d9595fc)\r\n* Taskbar10: Network icon now shows again on 24H2. (7e0f7eb, b473114)\r\n* Start10: Fixed positioning when the taskbar is not placed at the bottom, on 24H2 and latest 22H2/23H2 builds. (de2532d, ea5881f)\r\n* Taskbar10: Fixed taskbar jump list flyout positioning when the taskbar is not placed at the bottom, on latest 22H2/23H2/24H2 builds. (39609e4)\r\n* Setup: Updated the code for dealing with locked files, this should reduce the chances of getting setup failures due to locked files. (7e0f7eb)\r\n* ep_taskbar: Fixed tray icons not being saved.\r\n* ep_taskbar: Removed the Copilot button on 22H2.\r\n\r\n##### 5\r\n\r\n* Taskbar10: Fixed jump list positioning patch on latest builds with `TaskbarJumplistOnHover` feature flag. (#3615) (351a020)\r\n* Taskbar11: Fixed Task Manager menu entry doing nothing on 24H2+. (#3021, #3556) (060066c)\r\n* Start10: Fixed symbols mechanism when custom `StartUI_.dll` is used. (0f38628)\r\n* Start10: Increased reliability of ARM64 patterns for restoring the animations and fixing positioning. (#3566) (2ea3894)\r\n* ep_taskbar: Fixed the task band not having a handle when the taskbar is unlocked.\r\n* ep_taskbar: Fixed scroll arrows in window list popups (`ExtendedUI`) having weird appearance and behavior.\r\n\r\n##### 6\r\n\r\n* Updates: Fixed a bug where empty UpdateURL registry values would break the updates system. (#3668) (ac14c75)\r\n* Setup: Cleaned some unneeded stuff in the setup binary. (9811810)\r\n* Misc: Restored exported functions for launching/restarting Explorer: `ZZLaunchExplorer`, `ZZLaunchExplorerDelayed`, and `ZZRestartExplorer`. (9811810)\r\n\r\n##### 7\r\n\r\n* Taskbar10: The registry key for the \"Combine taskbar labels\" setting is no longer redirected. (eb1f1ec, 2a6fb15)\r\n  * This means you can now configure this reliably both from EP's Properties dialog and the Settings app.\r\n  * If you are using EP with Windows 11 taskbar on Windows 11 builds before 226x1.2361 (builds without the Never Combine option on the Windows 11 taskbar), please make sure that this is set to \"Always\" to prevent issues.\r\n* ep_taskbar: Now supports EP Weather. (#3546)\r\n* ep_taskbar: Disabled app icon animations in the notification center button due to crashes when receiving a large number of notifications. (#3605)\r\n* ep_taskbar: Fixed an issue where fallback UWP app icons do not show up, such as [Okular](https://okular.kde.org)'s. (#3754)\r\n* ep_taskbar: Fixed an issue where the primary taskbar's monitor location is not remembered. (#3719)\r\n* ep_taskbar: Implemented Win+X hotkey. (#3671)\r\n* ep_taskbar: Initial support for [Windhawk](https://windhawk.net) mods. The following classes are now exported: `ClockButton`, `CTaskListThumbnailWnd`, `CTaskBand`, `CTaskBand::CLauncherTask`, `CTaskBtnGroup`, `CWindowTaskItem`, `CImmersiveTaskItem`, `CTaskGroup`, `TaskItemFilter`, `CTaskListWnd`, and `CTaskThumbnail`. (#3769)\r\n  * Check [this list](https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher/wiki/ExplorerPatcher's-taskbar-implementation#windhawk-mods-support) for compatibility info.\r\n  * The mods themselves need to be manually updated to support ep_taskbar. Please contact the respective mod authors for this.\r\n\r\n## 22621.3527.65\r\n\r\nTested on OS builds 22621.3296, 22621.3447, 22621.3527, 22635.3566, 26058.1000, 26120.461, and 26200.5001. (Note: 22621 and 22631 share the same OS files)\r\n\r\n##### 1\r\n\r\n* Taskbar10: The Windows 10 taskbar option is now no longer available on 26002+. (#3053, e57a6b0)\r\n  * This is to comply with Microsoft's removal of the stock Windows 10 taskbar in `explorer.exe` of said builds.\r\n* Start10: Fixed Pin to Start on 226xx.3420+ (22H2, 23H2) and 25169+ (24H2). (232fe6b)\r\n* Start10: Reverted the menu closing delay fix when EP is injected only into `StartMenuExperienceHost.exe` for now. (e59c34c)\r\n\r\n##### 2\r\n\r\n* Start10: Fixed a bug where the recently introduced \"account suggestions\" prevents the user tile menu from opening on later 22H2/23H2 builds and 24H2. (d11445a)\r\n\r\n##### 3\r\n\r\n* All: Updated some patterns to work with 22635.3430+ (Beta) and recent 24H2 builds. (6d22947)\r\n  * This should fix the Windows 10 start menu crashing and Win+X not working on both aforementioned builds when symbols are not yet downloaded.\r\n  \r\n##### 4\r\n\r\n* Updates: Support for `ep_make`, a new script which builds ExplorerPatcher locally on your computer. Read more [here](https://github.com/valinet/ep_make). (80592f6)\r\n* GUI: Reorganized \"About\" and \"Uninstall\" sections. (4794713)\r\n* ep_weather: Fixed alignment.\r\n\r\n##### 5\r\n\r\n* Weather: Layout fixes. (57b44d2, 2112a18)\r\n\r\n## 22621.3296.64\r\n\r\nTested on OS builds 22000.2538, 22621.1992, 22621.3155, 22621.3235, 22621.3296, 25951.1000, and 26058.1000.\r\n\r\n##### 1\r\n\r\n* Taskbar10: Fixed a bug where SCOOBE would repeatedly crash Explorer when Language Switcher is set to anything other than Windows 10 (the default). (fe7f800, 5c35f58)\r\n* Taskbar10: Refined the method for aligning the Windows 11 Start menu and Search flyouts when using the Windows 10 taskbar on 22621.2792+.

Read more about it [here](https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher/wiki/Weather).\r\n* Support for the Windows 10 Start menu in Windows 11. Read more about this [here](https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher/discussions/920).\r\n* Option to center Windows 10 Start menu and Windows 10 taskbar.\r\n* Support for Windows 10. Read more about this [here](https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher/discussions/898).\r\n\r\n#### Details\r\n\r\n##### 1\r\n\r\n* The weather widget recomputes its area automatically, by default, in order to fit its contents, instead of remaining at a fixed size; there is also an option to choose between the two behavior\r\n* Possibility to disable the icon in the weather widget\r\n* Fixed a bug that prevented the weather widget flyout from displaying correctly when the taskbar was using small icons (#741)\r\n* Fixed inconsistencies when displaying the weather widget and the system themes are disabled (aka the classic theme is used)\r\n* Screen readers now read the weather data when requested for the weather widget\r\n* Changing the Start button style or weather widget layout does not toggle taskbar auto-hide now; instead, the settings take effect immediately\r\n\r\n##### 2\r\n\r\n* The weather widget defaults to showing in the preferred language set in Windows, instead of English (#734)\r\n* Fixed a bug that could corrupt registry entries of type REG_SZ set via the Properties UI (#734)\r\n* Fixed a bug that reset the setting when pressing \"Cancel\" in an input box in the Properties UI (#734)\r\n\r\n##### 3\r\n\r\n* The weather widget shows an error screen when an error happens (like, using an incorrect location, or the network not working etc)\r\n* The weather widget adjusts its size vertically to accommodate the entire contents (#734)\r\n\r\n##### 4\r\n\r\n* The weather widget supports dark mode (thanks @krlvm) (#755)\r\n\r\n##### 5\r\n\r\n* Fixed a bug that prevented correct registration of the weather flyout on certain systems (26b6646)\r\n* Fixed a bug that made the weather flyout open with noticeable delay under certain circumstances\r\n* Fixed a bug that prevented correct operation on builds without built-in symbols (#783)\r\n\r\n##### 6\r\n\r\n* Fixed several race conditions that could lead to incorrect operation of the weather widget (for example, `explorer.exe` crashing when disabling or enabling the widget)\r\n\r\n##### 7\r\n\r\n* Implemented 2 features that help in replacing the functionality of the quick launch toolbar with pinned taskbar items. Read more about it [here](https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher/discussions/819)\r\n\r\n##### 8\r\n\r\n* Implemented option to have the Start menu open on a specific monitor (#821)\r\n* The weather widget supports setting window corner preference (rounded/not rounded)\r\n\r\n##### 10\r\n\r\n* Option to clear weather widget local data\r\n\r\n##### 11\r\n\r\n* Installer sets a Start menu shortcut for the \"Properties\" window\r\n\r\n##### 14\r\n\r\n* The weather widget positions and sizes itself with respect to the text size accessibility setting as well ([#734](https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher/discussions/734#discussioncomment-2190218))\r\n\r\n##### 15\r\n\r\n* Support for high contrast themes in the \"Properties\" window and in the weather widget (#885)\r\n* Fixed a bug that could lead to a crash when `explorer.exe` starts (#879)\r\n* Fixed a bug that could prevent the weather widget from launching under certain conditions\r\n\r\n#####

Microsoft icon pack for the weather widget applies to the widget contents as well, in addition to the taskbar icon\r\n* Fixed a bug that slightly moved the taskbar buttons to the right when dragging to rearrange one of them over the first or last item when using the centered Windows 10 taskbar (#1009)\r\n* Fixed a bug that crashed the \"Properties\" window when accessing the \"System tray\" section in Windows 10 (#1013)\r\n* Fixed a bug that prevented the Mica effect from working on File Explorer windows when the \"Launch folder windows in a separate process\" setting was used (#1021)\r\n* Fixed a bug that made certain systems, under certain circumstances, to become stuck in \"tablet mode\"; symptoms included more spacing between taskbar icons, compact view permanently disabled in File Explorer, and/or item checkboxes permanently enabled in File Explorer (#1022). After installing this update, if you are still stuck with the tablet UI, open the Registry Editor, go to `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\TabletTip\\ConvertibleSlateModeChanged` and delete the `ConvertibleSlateModeChanged` value which most likely is stuck to `1`.\r\n\r\n##### .32\r\n\r\n* Built-in support for 22000.556\r\n* Weather widget can now show on the left/top side of the taskbar\r\n* Weather widget can display condition on 2 lines\r\n* Reliability improvements for the centered Windows 10 taskbar which now also works along with other taskbar toolbars\r\n* Fixed a bug that had the Windows 10 Start menu default to being left-aligned on Windows 10\r\n* Fixed a bug that prevented the \"Centered, with Start button\" modes of the Windows 10 taskbar from working correctly when the taskbar was vertically aligned\r\n\r\n##### .33\r\n\r\n* Weather: Implemented manual zoom levels (#1033)\r\n* Weather: Fixed a bug that had the widget display, at startup, a day/night icon relating to time at the last hour change, instead of the actual current time\r\n* Weather: Fixed a bug that made the widget display a line at the top for some places\r\n* Fixed a bug that could make the centered taskbar not layout correctly when showing/hiding either of the search, Cortana or task view buttons the first time after the application started\r\n* Fixed a bug that prevented the centered taskbar from working when animations are turned off system-wide (for example, in usual remote sessions)\r\n* Fixed a bug that prevented the taskbar from displaying correctly when the weather widget is set to display at left/top (#1041)\r\n\r\n##### .34\r\n\r\n* Weather: Fixed a bug that prevented resizing other taskbar toolbars (#1043)\r\n* Weather: Fixed bugs regarding left/top positioning option (#1041)\r\n\r\n##### .35\r\n\r\n* Option to allow version downgrades when updating the application after switching the servicing channels (#1051)\r\n* ExplorerPatcher no longer sets the `MinWidth` registry entry automatically - this was used to mitigate an issue with `explorer.exe` where taskbar button labels were becoming too large. If you are affected by having this registry entry set, open the Registry Editor, go to `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Control Panel\\Desktop\\WindowMetrics` and remove the `MinWidth` entry (which is probably set to `38`). The same procedure can be used in order to have this option set up in the registry. For more information, see #664.\r\n* Setup will disable the `UndockingDisabled` registry entry at `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Shell\\Update\\Packages` when servicing the application. Using `UndockingDisabled` with ExplorerPatcher is not necessary and can actually cause issues (for example, see #704).\r\n\r\n##### .36\r\n\r\n* Weather: Display time of last update in the Properties window\r\n\r\n##### .37\r\n\r\n* Fixed Windows 10 taskbar button thumbnails on newer OS builds (22572+)\r\n* Fixed Windows 10 taskbar showing fully transparent instead of the acrylic effect on newer OS builds (22572+)\r\n\r\n##### .38\r\n\r\n* Fixed a bug that made the disable window rounded corners feature not work after signing out and then back into a user account\r\n\r\n##### .39\r\n\r\n* Weather: Fixed a bug that prevented the widget from starting up on new installations due to the folder `%APPDATA%\\ExplorerPatcher` not existing\r\n\r\n## 22000.469.41\r\n\r\nTested on OS build 22000.434.\r\n\r\n#### New features\r\n\r\n* Built-in support for OS builds 22000.434, 22000.438, 22000.466, and 22000.469\r\n* Ability to choose a Windows 10 or Windows 11 Start button style for the Windows 10 taskbar (#436, thanks @krlvm)\r\n* Support for screen readers in the Properties window (#627) (.1)\r\n* Option to disable `Office` hotkeys (`Ctrl`+`Alt`+`Shift`+`Windows` key combinations) (#661) (.4)\r\n* Simple Window Switcher can switch applications instead of windows (#665) (.5, .6)\r\n* Option to disable rounded corners for windows (.7)\r\n* Ability to hide the \"Properties\" item from the taskbar context menu (.9)\r\n* Import/export functionality for program settings (.11)\r\n\r\n#### Feature enhancements\r\n\r\n* The option to toggle taskbar auto hide when double clicking the taskbar now works with the Windows 11 taskbar as well\r\n* Performing a memory leak dump now displays GDI, peak GDI, USER and peak USER object counts as well\r\n* The language switcher list displays only the options that work (previously, it showed some cryptic internal implementations, like \"LOGONUI\", \"UAC\", \"SETTINGPAGE\" and \"OOBE\"). Thus, the list of language switchers offers the following choices:\r\n  * Windows 11 (default)\r\n  * Windows 10 (with link to \"Language Preferences\")\r\n  * Windows 10\r\n* Simple Window Switcher now highlights windows that require user attention (windows that have their taskbar button flash and colored in orange) (.8)\r\n* Reliability improvements for the option that maps the `Win`+`C` shortcut to open the clock flyout instead of Microsoft Teams (eliminated dependency on symbol data) (.10)\r\n* When an update is available, the notification displays the version of the update (.12)\r\n* The updater correctly detects when the current version is a pre-release but the user has switched the update channel to stable and does not suggest the older stable version as an update anymore (multiple reports, #540, #710) (.12)\r\n* Import/export settings suggests a file name automatically (.15)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Fixes\r\n\r\n* Fixed a bug that prevented the Properties UI's system menu from displaying and working correctly\r\n* Fixed a bug that displayed a wrong timestamp (29/08/2021) instead of the current date and time on the notifications generated by ExplorerPatcher\r\n* Fixed a wrong function prototype (5b4bd07#r62018175, thanks @Simplestas)\r\n* Protected some state variables from changing internally if modified in the registry until `explorer` is restarted\r\n* Fixed a bug that could unexpectedly prevent the [Win]+[Alt]+[D] shortcut from working properly\r\n* Windows 10 language switcher displays correctly when the taskbar is placed in some location other than the bottom of the screen (#629) (.2)\r\n* Available symbols download properly on Insider builds (tested on 22526.1000) (.3)\r\n* Mitigated an `explorer.exe` bug where Windows 10 taskbar buttons were becoming too large under certain circumstances when the setting to show labels/never combine is used and the screen resolution/DPI changes (#664) (.6)\r\n* Performance improvements and bug fixes for Simple Window Switcher (.8)\r\n\r\n## 22000.376.40\r\n\r\nTested on OS build 22000.376.\r\n\r\n#### Highlights\r\n\r\n* Built-in support for OS build 22000.376 (.12)\r\n* Hotfix: Windows 10 taskbar \"always combine\"/\"show labels\" setting is properly preserved when upgrading from an older release (multiple reports, #612, #614) (.21)\r\n* Primary taskbar remembers position when moved to a secondary monitor (multiple issues, like #504)\r\n* Ability to set Control Center as network icon action (merged #492)\r\n* Added possibility to use the original Windows 10 (Alt-Tab) window switcher; thus, the available options are now:\r\n  * Windows 11 switcher - full screeen, slow, tiny selection outline, slow opening times\r\n  * Windows 10 switcher - pretty good but lacks customization options\r\n  * Windows NT switcher - the classic simple icon-based interface hosted by `csrss`\r\n  * Simple Window Switcher - my own take on implementing this kind of functionality\r\n* Registry access in the \"Properties\" GUI is now virtualized; that means, the same lightweight infrastructure is maintained but more complex behaviors can be offered via the improved backend; as such, this version introduces the following new configuration options:\r\n  * Primary and secondary taskbar placement\r\n  * Automatically hide the taskbar\r\n* Proper activation of the \"Properties\" window when another instance is running and minimized\r\n* Symbols parsing success notification displays for longer\r\n* Debug builds are clearly indicated in the \"About\" page of \"Properties\"\r\n* Fixed solution to properly produce a debug setup program\r\n* Possibility to uninstall by renaming `ep_setup.exe` to `ep_uninstall.exe` and running that (.4)\r\n* Fixed a bug that crashed the \"Properties\" GUI when toggling certain settings (#527) (.6)\r\n* The \"Properties\" window is restarted unelevated if it was open when application servicing was performed (#528) (.7, .13)\r\n* Reliability improvements for File Explorer restarts (#529) (.7)\r\n* When changing the main taskbar position and restarting File Explorer, the new position is now correctly saved and applied when File Explorer restarts (#523) (.7)\r\n* Mitigation for the issue described in #416 (.7)\r\n* Fixed a bug that prevented the Windows 10 window switcher from displaying when it was enabled, instead falling back to the Windows NT window switcher (#548) (.8)\r\n* Fixed the \"Show People in the taskbar\" option and made it not require a restart to apply (#554) (.10)\r\n* Ability to choose look of Snap Assist (window list when snapping a window): Windows 11 or Windows 10 style (.11)\r\n* Fixed a bug that prevented the correct set up of \"DisplayVersion\" registry entry in the uninstall information registry key (.11)\r\n* Secondary taskbars' context menu is displayed similarly to the primary taskbar's context menu for Windows 10 style (.12)\r\n* Safeguards to prevent malicious executions on update mechanism hijacks for systems where User Account Control is disabled (#567) (.13)\r\n* Option to prevent certain Control Panel links from being redirected to the Settings app (.14), including in build 22523 (.15)\r\n* Settings are now stored in `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\ExplorerPatcher` so that Windows does not reset them anymore across major OS updates (#576) (.16)\r\n* Improved Properties UI layout by reducing wasted space and eliminating redundant elements (#590) (.17)\r\n* Support for the `Win`+`Alt`+`D` shortcut to activate the clock flyout, as in Windows 10 (#591) (.17)\r\n* Fixes for Windows 11 taskbar:\r\n  * As shipped by Microsoft, a taskbar displayed on a secondary monitor does not react when the mouse is over it and auto hide is on; fixed this (#589) (.17)\r\n  * As shipped by Microsoft, under certain circumstances, the main taskbar does not show its system tray when `explorer` starts up and auto hide is on; fixed this (.17)\r\n  * As shipped by Microsoft, a taskbar displayed on a secondary monitor might display a wrong contextual menu when auto hide is on; fixed this (.17)\r\n  * The clock flyouts now display correctly when using this taskbar\r\n  * Fixed a bug that displayed wrong window previews when the combine taskbar buttons option was set to never combine (#564) (.17)\r\n  * Possibility to set position on screen (top/bottom) from the Properties UI\r\n* Restoring default settings only asks for elevation if required (for the moment, only if you have registered the application as shell extension) (.18)\r\n* Fixed the context menu not working (and a potential associated crash) of the new Microsoft IME (#598, #588) (.19) (huge thanks to @Simplestas)\r\n* GUI: Lock `ExplorerFrame` into memory (.20)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Simple Window Switcher\r\n\r\n* Dramatically improved performance, refactored application; switched to building the window lists faster, on demand, so that the proper windows are always displayed (as far as I remember, the latest `IsAltTabWindow` is based on a function called `IsTaskedWindow` ripped straight from AltTab.dll from Windows 7 6.1.7600.16385)\r\n* Proper history of window activations is maintained internally\r\n* Implemented support for layered windows, thus making transparency possible when using the default theme (Acrylic and Mica brushes are still available, but those have the disadvantage that the system can disable them in certain scenarios, like saving energy when working on battery power)\r\n* Improved reliability of startup delay and window dismiss when quickly Alt-Tabbing\r\n* Window icons are retrieved async now\r\n* Better icon drawing using GDI+ flat API\r\n* Added some more debug messages\r\n* Fixed some rendering problems when themes are disabled\r\n* Fixed regression of [#161](https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher/issues/161#issuecomment-986234002) (.1)\r\n* Possibility to disable per-application window lists (`Alt`+`) ([#283](https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher/issues/283#issuecomment-986261712)) (.2)\r\n* Fixed bug that prevented proper loading of default settings (.3)\r\n* Implemented a mitigation for #516: gestures for switching apps on Windows Precision Touchpad devices trigger the Windows 10 switcher instead of the Windows 11 switcher, which is much closer to how Simple Window Switcher looks and behaves; ideally, a full solution for this should be provided in the future, in the form of support for activation and navigation using Windows Precision Touchpad gestures in the Simple Window Switcher (.5)\r\n* Fixed an issue that could hung the application and made window switchers unavailable (#525) (many thanks to @jdp1024) (.7)\r\n* Possibility to configure window padding (.7)\r\n* Support for closing window with middle button ([#110](https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher/discussions/110#discussioncomment-1793318)) (.9)\r\n* Mitigated an issue that may have prevented Explorer from launching correctly when Simple Window Switcher is set as window switcher (.9)\r\n* Fixed a crash that could make Explorer restart repeatedly at startup or even hang indefinitely (#525) (.15)\r\n\r\n## 22000.348.39\r\n\r\nTested on build 22000.348.\r\n\r\n#### New features\r\n\r\n* Built-in support for build 22000.348.\r\n* Implemented option to toggle taskbar auto-hide when double clicking the main taskbar (#389)\r\n* Running `ep_setup.exe` again while EP is already installed will now update the program to the latest version. To uninstall, as the previous behavior did, run `ep_setup.exe /uninstall`\r\n* Implemented absolute height and width parameters for the Windows 10 switcher. These are especially useful for ultra wide monitors, in a scenario similar to the one described in [this post](https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher/discussions/110#discussioncomment-1673007) - to configure, set `MaxWidthAbs` and/or `MaxHeightAbs` DWORD values in `HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\ExplorerPatcher\\sws` (#110)\r\n* Provides a simple mechanism for chainloading a custom library when the shell interface is created, from which you can execute your custom code (subject to change, see [this](https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher/discussions/408#discussioncomment-1674348) for more details) (#408)\r\n\r\n#### Feature enhancements\r\n\r\n* Option to receive pre-release versions, if available, when checking for updates\r\n* Improved behavior regarding symbol data information; please refer to https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher/wiki/Symbols for more information (.1)\r\n\r\n#### Fixes\r\n\r\n* Fixed mismatches between defaults from EP and Windows' defaults\r\n* Application starts with limited functionality on builds lacking hardcoded symbol information; symbol downloading is disabled for now, by default, but can be enabled in the \"Advanced\" settings section of \"Properties\"\r\n* Improvements to how hung windows are treated by the Windows 10 window switcher; fixed an issue that severely delayed the time it took the window switcher to display when a window hung on the screen (#449)\r\n* Clicking \"Close\" in the Windows 10 window switcher is now more tolerant to small mouse movements (#110) (.1)\r\n* The existing \"Properties\" window is properly displayed if opening it when another instance is already running and is minimized (.2)\r\n\r\n## 22000.318.38\r\n\r\nTested on build 22000.318.\r\n\r\n#### New features\r\n\r\n* Functional Windows 10 network flyout\r\n* Functional Windows 10 battery flyout\r\n* Implemented support for Windows 7 battery flyout (#274)\r\n* Implemented `/extract` switch which unpacks the files from `ep_setup.exe` to disk (#396) (.1):\r\n  * `ep_setup /extract` - extracts `ExplorerPatcher.IA-32.dll` and `ExplorerPatcher.amd64.dll` to current directory\r\n  * `ep_setup /extract test` - extracts to `test` folder in current directory\r\n  * `ep_setup /extract \"C:\\test with space\"` - extracts to `C:\\test with space` directory\r\n* Taskbar toolbar layouts are preserved when switching between Windows 10 and Windows 11 taskbars and in general (these will be reset when installing this update but should be subsequently remembered) (#395) (.2)\r\n* Implemented option to toggle taskbar auto-hide when double clicking the main taskbar (#389) (.3)\r\n* Running `ep_setup.exe` again while EP is already installed will now update the program to the latest version. To uninstall, as the previous behavior did, run `ep_setup.exe /uninstall` (.4)\r\n* Implemented absolute height and width parameters for the Windows 10 switcher.

This behavior works when either the Windows 10 or Windows 11 taskbar is enabled. As well, you can launch the \"Properties\" window directly by pressing `Win`+`R` and typing `rundll32 C:\\Windows\\dxgi.dll,ZZGUI`, followed by `Enter`.\r\n* Implemented a setup program:\r\n  * To install, simply run `ep_setup.exe`. File Explorer will restart and the program will be enabled right away.\r\n  * To uninstall, there are 2 options:\r\n    * Run `ep_setup.exe` again.\r\n    * Via \"Programs and Features\" in Control Panel, or \"Apps and features\" in the Settings app.\r\n  * Learn more about the setup program [here](https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher/wiki/Installer-How-To)\r\n* Implemented automatic updates; there are 3 settings to choose from when File Explorer starts:\r\n  * Notify about available updates (default) - the program will check for updates and display a notification if a new build is available; you can go to \"Properties\" and install the update from there\r\n  * Prompt to install available updates - the program will check for updates, download them if any, and prompt you to install them automatically\r\n  * Do not check for updates - the program never checks for updates in the background\r\n  * Of course, you can manually check for updates at any point using \"Properties\" - \"Updates\" - \"Check for updates\". To install the update you were notified about, go to \"Properties\" - \"Updates\" - \"Install latest version\".\r\n  * When installing an update, you will be prompted using UAC to allow elevation - always check that the update originates from matches what you expect; official updates are currently served via https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher.\r\n  * Learn more about how to configure updates on your system, including how to set a custom endpoint [here](https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher/wiki/Configure-updates)\r\n* Implemented a proper right click menu for the Windows 11 taskbar - it displays the most common options, similar to previous Windows releases and the Windows 10 taskbar, including frequently accessed items like \"Taskbar settings\", \"Task Manager\" and \"Show the desktop\"\r\n* System tray icons are now left intact when switching between the Windows 10 and Windows 11 taskbars, or when switching builds, reinstalling the application etc. Basically, now, once you set a certain layout for the system tray with the Windows 10 taskbar, it will always be remembered, instead of the annoying behavior where Windows was discarding your choices in order to accommodate the Windows 11 taskbar\r\n\r\n#### Feature enhancements\r\n\r\n* Hardcoded symbols are now based on file hashes, not build numbers\r\n* Better organization for the settings in \"Properties\"\r\n* Update toast notifications are displayed only as long as they are required. Subsequent notifications no longer have to wait for the previous ones to timeout, but rather they replace the previous ones (#346) (.2)\r\n\r\n#### Fixes\r\n\r\n* Mitigated an issue that prevented the Windows 11 taskbar from displaying properly under certain circumstances\r\n* Fixed an issue that would crash the Windows 11 taskbar when it was enabled after positioning the Windows 10 taskbar on either side of the screen (left/right)\r\n* Fixed a bug in \"Windows 10 Window switcher\" that may have lead to `explorer.exe` crashing when more than 20 windows are opened on the screen (probably the cause for a lot of crashes)\r\n* Fixed numerous issues when injecting processes, including as shell extension; reliability improvements\r\n* Adjusted the padding of the system tray hidden icons indicator so that it is now properly centered vertically when using the classic theme mitigations\r\n* Fixed a memory leak in \"Settings Manager\"\r\n* Removed verbose output from \"Settings Manager\"\r\n* Corrected import from `dxgi.dll`\r\n* Fixed typo in configuration UI (#346) (.1)\r\n* Fixed typos and spelling in error message (#346) (.2)\r\n* Fixed bug that prevented \"Properties\" from working when invoked from Quick Launch or other toolbars (#349) (.2)\r\n* As you may have noticed, releases do not contain unpacked files anymore. Thus, for people looking for a quick way to get the unpacked files, the release notes now include a link to the artifacts generated during during the build process. The artifacts include the usual DLLs (including `dxgi.dll`), plus symbol files and all the helper executables generated during the build. (#351) (.2)\r\n* Setup program version is synchronized with the version of the application (.2)\r\n* Fixed a mismatch between the default value for the setting \"Add shortcut to program settings in Win+X menu\" displayed in the UI and actually used in the software (#352) (.2)\r\n* Fixed an issue that prevented \"Restore default settings\" in the \"Properties\" UI from working (#374) (.3)\r\n* Improved some wording in the Properties UI (#377) (.4)\r\n* Added option to show separators between toolbars in the taskbar (#379) (.4)\r\n* \"Properties\" is restarted when doing an install/update and closed when uninstalling the application (.5)\r\n* \"Properties\" can open the last used section when starting (.5)\r\n\r\n## 22000.318.36\r\n\r\nTested on build 22000.318.\r\n\r\n#### Fixes\r\n\r\n* Fixes an issue that prevented Explorer from starting up when Windows 10 taskbar was disabled and Windows 10 window switcher was enabled (#313) (.1)\r\n* Lots of bug and issue fixes for shell extension failing to work under certain circumstances (#259)\r\n\r\n## 22000.318.35\r\n\r\nTested on build 22000.318.\r\n\r\n#### Feature enhancements\r\n\r\n* Start menu position can now be changed without needing to restart File Explorer\r\n\r\n#### Fixes\r\n\r\n* Improved reliability of Start menu positioning when the monitor topology changes and at startup\r\n* Start menu injection returns error codes from the remote process in the debug console\r\n* Other Start menu quality of life improvements\r\n\r\n## 22000.318.34\r\n\r\nTested on build 22000.318.\r\n\r\n#### New features\r\n\r\n* Added option to enable legacy list view (\"SysListView32\") in File Explorer (credit @toiletflusher, @anixx from WinClassic) (.1)\r\n\r\n#### Feature enhancements\r\n\r\n* Built-in support for build 22000.318\r\n\r\n## 22000.282.33\r\n\r\nTested on build 22000.282.\r\n\r\n#### New features\r\n\r\n* Ability to choose language switcher flyout style (option available in the \"Properties\" - \"System tray\" section)\r\n\r\n#### Fixes\r\n\r\n* The key above the `Tab` key is now correctly identified for all keyboard layouts, so the per-application Windows 10 window switcher mode works correctly (#283)\r\n\r\n## 22000.282.32\r\n\r\nTested on build 22000.282.\r\n\r\n#### New features\r\n* Windows 10 window switcher features new configuration options:\r\n  * Always show switcher on primary monitor\r\n  * Show windows only from current monitor\r\n  * Theme selector: Mica, Acrylic and None\r\n  * Corner preference: Rounded, Rounded small, Not rounded\r\n  * More options for row height\r\n  * [Alt]+[\\`] shows the switcher only for windows of the foreground application\r\n  * `[Enter]` switches to selected window (same as `[Space]`) (#240) (.1)\r\n  * Navigation using arrow keys (#240) (.1)\r\n* Ability to choose behavior for Cortana button: hidden, shown and opens Cortana, shown and opens Widgets (#255) (.3)\r\n* Builds are now automatic, generated as soon as new content is pushed to the repository and compiled on GitHub's infrastructure (.6)\r\n\r\n#### Feature enhancements\r\n* Clock context menu options \"Adjust date/time\" and \"Customize notification icons\" open in Control Panel instead of Settings\r\n\r\n#### Fixes\r\n* Taskbar context menu not displaying properly when using classic theme mitigations should now be fixed\r\n* Reliability improvements, correct injection, avoid double patching\r\n* All windows should now be properly detected and included in the Windows 10 window switcher\r\n* Performance enhancements for Windows 10 window switcher: layouts are now precomputed when a window change occurs, so it should be very fast to open and consistent, no matter the current load; also, fast switching does not trigger the window, as it should\r\n* \"Show Cortana button\" taskbar menu entry now works again (#252) (.2)\r\n* Fixes a bug that prevented correct opening of some applications (like `powershell`) when EP was registered as shell extension (#256) (.4) - PLEASE NOTE THAT RUNNING AS SHELL EXTENSION IS STILL EXPERIMENTAL, UNSUPPORTED, AND ONLY RECOMMENDED FOR SPECIFIC USE CASES THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT ALREADY; otherwise, just dropping the DLL in `C:\\Windows` is enough\r\n* Windows 10 window switcher switcher now correctly displays UWP apps immediately after launch (#266) (.5)\r\n* Selection and highlight rectangle are now correctly drawn when using light theme on Windows 10 window switcher (.5)\r\n* Keyboard selection (left, right, up, down, space, Return) also works when window switcher is shown by holding down the `ALT` key (#263) (.7)\r\n\r\n## 22000.282.31\r\n\r\nTested on build: 22000.282.\r\n\r\n#### New features\r\n\r\n* Cortana button now opens the Widgets panel\r\n* Ability to choose what happens when clicking the Network icon in the system tray\r\n* Possibility to use the legacy clock flyout\r\n* Possibility to use the legacy volume flyout\r\n* Fixes to fully support the classic theme, with a functional taskbar, system tray, Explorer windows, working context menus; read more about this feature [here](https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher/discussions/101)\r\n* Choose type of flyout for clock (.1)\r\n* Compatibility with build 22000.282 (.2)\r\n\r\n#### Feature enhancements\r\n\r\n* Reorganized settings in the GUI\r\n* Added option not to have an accelerator for the `Properties` menu entry in `Win`+`X` (#162)\r\n* The \"Adjust date/time\" and \"Customize notification icons\" links in the clock context menu now open the more versatile Control Panel applets (.4)\r\n* The console can now be disabled and then dismissed without causing the Explorer process to restart (.4)\r\n* Implemented a new exported function which restarts File Explorer cleanly, reloading your folder windows: `rundll32 C:\\Windows\\dxgi.dll,ZZRestartExplorer` (.4)\r\n\r\n#### Fixes\r\n\r\n* Fixed an issue where the Windows 10 window switcher failed to display some windows (#161)\r\n* Fixed an issue that prevented Start from opening again until Explorer was restarted after opening File Explorer via the Start menu Explorer icon (#145)\r\n* Fixed patching in libvalinet\r\n* Fixed GUI launch path; GUI now launches in an external process, survives Explorer restarts\r\n* Addresses an issue that prevented correct operation under certain circumstances and that could lead to a rare bug where Explorer would crash after a Control Panel window was opened (also related to Control Panel windows not always respecting preferences like \"disable navigation bar\") (.3)\r\n* Fixed a bug that caused the cursor to move when invoking `Win`+`X` (.4)\r\n* Fixed a bug that caused incorrect positioning of `Win`+`X` when the main taskbar was present on a monitor different than the primary one (.4)\r\n* The Start menu now automatically reloads in the background only when its settings change, instead of when any settings change (.4)\r\n* Improved the reliability of the \"Restart File Explorer\" link in the Properties GUI (.4)\r\n* Improved the detection of scenarios when the patcher should inject and apply the full set of patches to File Explorer (.4)\r\n* Other bug fixes (.4)\r\n\r\n#### Experimental\r\n\r\n**PLEASE NOTE THAT RUNNING AS SHELL EXTENSION IS STILL EXPERIMENTAL, UNSUPPORTED, AND ONLY RECOMMENDED FOR SPECIFIC USE CASES THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT ALREADY. IT IS NOT REQUIRED FOR OBTAINING ANY OF THE CORE FUNCTIONALITY, IT IS AVAILABLE ONLY FOR SOME ADVANCED USE CASES AND IS STILL A BIGGER WORK-IN-PROGRESS THAN THE MAIN PROJECT.**\r\n\r\nThe application can now be registered as a shell extension. This will enable the Explorer related functionality to work in Open/Save file dialogs as well. This is especially useful for users wanting proper support of the classic theme in Windows 11.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this is experimental. For the moment, the preferred installation method remains dropping the DLL in `C:\\Windows`. For interested users, I invite you to test this functionality and report your findings in the discussions board.\r\n\r\nTo enable this, put the 2 DLLs (`ExplorerPatcher.amd64.dll` and `ExplorerPatcher.IA-32.dll`) in a secure folder (for example, `C:\\Program Files\\ExplorerPatcher`). Then, in that folder, run this command: `regsvr32 ExplorerPatcher.amd64.dll`. After elevation, a message will display informing you of the operation outcome, and if it went well, Explorer will restart displaying the old taskbar.\r\n\r\nTo uninstall, run `regsvr32 /u ExplorerPatcher.amd64.dll` in the same folder and preferably reboot the computer to unload the DLLs from all applications. Then, the files can be deleted just fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 22000.258.30.6\r\n\r\nTested on build: 22000.258.\r\n\r\n* Reworked settings framework\r\n  * More settings are available to customize\r\n  * Most setting changes take effect immediatly\r\n* Implemented Windows 10 window switcher (Alt+Tab)\r\n* GUI\r\n  * Revamped GUI, now the interface is split by categories and is displayed on two columns\r\n  * Regular items do not display a \"+\" sign anymore at the beginning of their label\r\n  * The current choice is ticked in the drop down menu\r\n  * Regions are now calculated correctly\r\n  * Solved memory leaks\r\n* Option to disable immersive context menus (#96)\r\n* General bug fixes\r\n* Window switcher is now disabled by default (.1)\r\n* Corrected typo in settings (.2)\r\n* Added option to set tray clock to display seconds (.3)\r\n* Added option to set the right click menu of the network system tray icon to launch either (.3):\r\n  * Network settings in the Settings app\r\n  * Network and Sharing Center in the Control Panel\r\n  * Network Connections in the Control Panel\r\n* Added preliminary support for advanced mitigations for correct rendering when using the classic theme (.3)\r\n* GUI optionally loads UI file from DLL folder (helps for easy debugging) (.4)\r\n* Small bug fix for symbols download (.5)\r\n* Better method for closing windows in window switcher (.6)\r\n\r\n## 22000.258.26.3\r\n\r\nTested on build: 22000.258.\r\n\r\n* Compatibility with OS build 22000.258\r\n* Option to open Network and Sharing Center instead if Network settings when right clicking the network icon in the system tray\r\n* Centered network and sound right click menus and made them toggle on right click\r\n* Reliability enhancements for Start menu positioning (#78) (.1)\r\n* Fixes #85 (.2)\r\n* Fixes #90 (added option to change taskbar icon size) (.3)\r\n\r\n## 22000.194.0.25\r\n\r\nTested on build: 22000.194.\r\n\r\n* Start menu is hooked from File Explorer; please remove the DLL from `C:\\Windows\\SystemApps\\Microsoft.Windows.StartMenuExperienceHost_cw5n1h2txyewy` when using this new version\r\n* `Win`+`X` now opens even when the taskbar is set to autohide (fixes #63)\r\n* `Win`+`C` now opens even when the taskbar is set to autohide (fixes #63)\r\n* Bluetooth and Safe to Remove menus toggle their visibility when clicked\r\n* Bluetooth and Safe to Remove menus are centered relative to the icon they are invoked from\r\n* WiFi list now correctly toggles when clicking the Network icon in the taskbar\r\n* The settings GUI now supports dark mode and switches correctly when the system theme changes\r\n* The settings GUI draws correctly when themes are disabled (classic theme compatibility)\r\n* Removed interoperability with StartAllBack or StartIsBack\r\n\r\n## 22000.194.0.23\r\n\r\nTested on build: 22000.194.\r\n\r\n* Fixed a bug that showed`Win`+`X` on the wrong monitor in certain scenarios\r\n* `Win`+`X` shows in Windows 11 fashion (centered, above the Start button) if using a centered taskbar with centered Start button as well (using a program like [TaskbarX](https://github.com/valinet/TaskbarX))\r\n* Fixed the bug that prevented the application from loading in`StartMenuExperienceHost.exe` (thanks to @BraINstinct0 for the report)\r\n* Fixed padding and element sizes in GUI so it better fits on smaller screens (thanks to @Gaurav-Original-ClassicShellTester for the report)\r\n* GUI shows application title when run outside of File Explorer\r\n* GUI stays on screen and just reloads the settings when restoring defaults (instead of closing)\r\n* Keyboard (tab) support for GUI: `Esc` to close the window, `Tab` to select the next option, `Shift`+`Tab` to select the previous option, `Space` to toggle (or activate) the option\r\n* Possibility of running the GUI standalone; run this command: `rundll32.exe C:\\Windows\\dxgi.dll,ZZGUI`; this has the advantage that it stays on the screen after restarting File Explorer\r\n\r\n## 22000.194.0.22\r\n\r\nTested on build: 22000.194.\r\n\r\n* When the taskbar is located at the bottom of the screen, opening the power user menu (`Win`+`X`) now automatically highlights the \"Desktop\" entry in the list. Also, the menu items can be activated either with left click, either with right click. Thus, this enables a behavior where you can double click the Start button with the right mouse button in order to quickly show the desktop (thanks to @Gaurav-Original-ClassicShellTester for the suggestion)\r\n\r\n## 22000.194.0.21\r\n\r\nTested on build: 22000.194.\r\n\r\n* Implemented configuration GUI; to access it, right click the Start button (or press `Win`+`X`) and choose \"Properties\" (thanks to @BraINstinct0 for the suggestion)\r\n\r\n## 22000.194.0.20\r\n\r\nTested on build: 22000.194.\r\n\r\n* Huge code refactoring, improved memory patching\r\n* Updated README with better description of the software and how to use it\r\n* Drastically reduced the number of symbols required (around 40MB to download, instead of over 400MB previously)\r\n* Improved Start menu and search positioning, now it is not necessary to have the DLL in `C:\\Windows\\SystemApps\\MicrosoftWindows.Client.CBS_cw5n1h2txyewy`, please remove it from there.\r\n* Skin \"Bluetooth\" pop-up menu\r\n* Option to hide the search bar in File Explorer completely\r\n* Option to disable the control center button in the taskbar\r\n* Removed the option to disable the modern search box in File Explorer.

Instead, you now run a command which disables it globally on your user account; read [here](https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher#disable-the-immersive-context-menu)\r\n* Ability to disable command bar is described [here](https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher#disable-the-command-bar-in-File-Explorer)\r\n* Option to apply Mica effect on File Explorer windows (requires `StartIsBack64.dll`), read [here](https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher#configuration)\r\n* Option to skin system tray icons to match Windows 11 style (requires `StartisBack64.dll`), read [here](https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher#configuration)\r\n\r\n## 22449.1000.0.18\r\n\r\nTested on the following builds: 22449.1000, 22000.176, 22000.1.\r\n\r\nNew in this version:\r\n\r\n* Ability to disable the \"modern search box\" in File Explorer and uses the classic functional search from early Windows 10 versions or Windows 7/8. To disable this and still use the new search, set `General\\AllowModernSearchBox = 1` in `settings.ini`\r\n\r\nFixes:\r\n\r\n* Much improved algorithm for enabling the classic taskbar after symbols have downloaded on newer builds\r\n* Restored compatibility with RTM build of Windows 11 (22000.1)\r\n* Fixes the \"modern search box\" not working correctly when the DLL is used in `C:\\Windows\\SystemApps\\MicrosoftWindows.Client.CBS_cw5n1h2txyewy`\r\n\r\n## 22449.1000.0.16\r\n\r\nNew in this version:\r\n\r\n- Compatibility with OS build 22449.1000.0.16.\r\n- Fixed bug that prevented console from showing when the `AllocConsole` setting was specified in `settings.ini`\r\n\r\n## 22000.168.0.14\r\n\r\n* Start menu and search now respect the taskbar alignment setting\r\n* Ability to customize the number of \"Most used\" apps in the Start menu apps list\r\n* Symbols are automatically downloaded for Start menu and search; to have the application work with those two, place the DLL in the following additional 2 locations:\r\n  * `C:\\Windows\\SystemApps\\Microsoft.Windows.StartMenuExperienceHost_cw5n1h2txyewy`\r\n  * `C:\\Windows\\SystemApps\\MicrosoftWindows.Client.CBS_cw5n1h2txyewy`\r\n\r\n## 22000.168.0.12\r\n\r\n* Support for showing the app list by default in the Windows 11 Start menu; to enable this feature, copy the DLL to `C:\\Windows\\SystemApps\\Microsoft.Windows.StartMenuExperienceHost_cw5n1h2txyewy` and restart Explorer (works only on 22000.168 for the moment, will be generally available after more testing is performed).\r\n* `Win+X` is now shown correctly on multi monitor setups\r\n* Other bug fixes\r\n\r\n## 22000.168.0.11\r\n\r\nFixes [#3](https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher/issues/3) and [#10](https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher/issues/10).\r\n\r\n## 22000.168.0.10\r\n\r\nImproved Explorer hooking.\r\n\r\nThe application now comes in the form of a single DLL file (`dxgi.dll`) which you have to place in `%windir%` (usually `C:\\Windows`). Restart Explorer and that's it.\r\n\r\nPlease make sure to uninstall the old version before using this new one.\r\n\r\n## 22000.168.0.9\r\n\r\nImplements [#6](https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher/issues/6) (option to revert to classic context menu). To disable this feature, add this to the settings.ini file:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[General]\r\nAllowImmersiveContextMenus=1\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 22000.168.0.8\r\n\r\nThe popup menu for \"Safe to Remove Hardware\" is now skinned in the same  style as the Win+X menu and the taskbar context menus, in order to  improve UI consistency.\r\n\r\n## 22000.168.0.7\r\n\r\nEnables compatibility with [ArchiveMenu](https://github.com/valinet/archivemenu).\r\n\r\n## 22000.168.0.6\r\n\r\nFixes [#5](https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher/issues/5) (removes the delay at logon on newer builds like 22000.168; the bug is similar to the effect introduced by `UndockingDisabled` on these newer builds).\r\n\r\n## 22000.1.0.5\r\n\r\nOffsets are now determined at runtime\r\n\r\nThe application was tested on builds 22000.1 and 22000.168.\r\n\r\n- Library downloads and parses symbols in order to determine function hooking offsets at runtime and saves the data in a \"settings.ini\" file located in the application folder for future use; the file is invalidated when a new OS build is detected\r\n- The main executable attempts to determine the location where a jump has to be patched out so that Explorer remains on the 'show old taskbar' code path; it will systematically patch each jz/jnz instruction and will check whether Explorer still runs fine, and, if it does so and does not crash, whether the old taskbar got actually shown; once the offset is determined, it is saved in the \"settings.ini\" file for future use\r\n- Please have an unmetered active working Internet connection when running for the first time\r\n- Messages from the patcher (i.e. install/uninstall successful message, symbol downloading message) will now display in a toast (Windows 10 notification) if possible; when Explorer is not running, it falls back to using standard MessageBox'es\r\n- Disabled the pre/post build command that restarted sihost.exe in Debug builds\r\n\r\n## 22000.1.0.4\r\n\r\nNew in this release\r\n\r\n- Win+X combination is now handled and opens the power user menu\r\n\r\nOf note from previous releases:\r\n\r\n- Start menu is now displayed on monitor containing the cursor when  invoked with the Windows key if the appropriate configuration is made  into the registry (enables a functionality which was previously  available in Windows 8.1). To activate this, follow this tutorial: https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/5943-start-menu-open-main-last-display-windows-10-a.html\r\n- The power user menu (Win+X) is now skinned using the system theme, as it was in Windows 10\r\n\r\n## 22000.1.0.3\r\n\r\nStart menu is now displayed on monitor containing the cursor when  invoked with the Windows key if the appropriate configuration is made  into the registry (enables a functionality which was previously  available in Windows 8.1).\r\n\r\nTo activate this, follow this tutorial: https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/5943-start-menu-open-main-last-display-windows-10-a.html\r\n\r\n## 22000.1.0.2\r\n\r\nFixes [#1](https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher/issues/1) (the menu is now skinned using the system theme, as it was in Windows 10).\r\n\r\n## 22000.1.0.1\r\n\r\nAdded functionality to bring back the power user menu (Win+X).\r\n\r\n## 22000.1.0.0\r\n\r\nInitial version of the application. Only x64 builds.\r\n"

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\n    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.
