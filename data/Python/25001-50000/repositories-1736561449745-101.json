          "content": "# Change Log\n\n## V10.1.0 - 2021-11-23\n\nThis release includes patches for three security vulnerabilities:\n\n- Insecure default configuration affects installations where REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET is not set explicitly (CVE-2021-41192)\n- SSRF vulnerability affects installations that enabled URL-loading data sources (CVE-2021-43780)\n- Incorrect usage of state parameter in OAuth client code affects installations where Google Login is enabled (CVE-2021-43777)\n\nAnd a couple features that didn't merge in time for 10.0.0\n\n- Big Query: Speed up schema loading (#5632)\n- Add support for Firebolt data source (#5606)\n- Fix: Loading schema for Sqlite DB with \"Order\" column name fails (#5623)\n\n## v10.0.0 - 2021-10-01\n\nA few changes were merged during the V10 beta period.\n\n- New Data Source: CSV/Excel Files\n- Fix: Edit Source button disappeared for users without CanEdit permissions\n- We pinned our docker base image to Python3.7-slim-buster to avoid build issues\n- Fix: dashboard list pagination didn't work\n\n## v10.0.0-beta - 2021-06-16\n\nJust over a year since our last release, the V10 beta is ready. Since we never made a non-beta release of V9, we expect many users will upgrade directly from V8 -> V10. This will bring a lot of exciting features. Please check out the V9 beta release notes below to learn more.\n\nThis V10 beta incorporates fixes for the feedback we received on the V9 beta along with a few long-requested features (horizontal bar charts!) and other changes to improve UX and reliability.\n\nThis release was made possible by contributions from 35+ people (the Github API didn't let us pull handles this time around): Alex Kovar, Alexander Rusanov, Arik Fraimovich, Ben Amor, Christopher Grant, Đặng Minh Dũng, Daniel Lang, deecay, Elad Ossadon, Gabriel Dutra, iwakiriK, Jannis Leidel, Jerry, Jesse Whitehouse, Jiajie Zhong, Jim Sparkman, Jonathan Hult, Josh Bohde, Justin Talbot, koooge, Lei Ni, Levko Kravets, Lingkai Kong, max-voronov, Mike Nason, Nolan Nichols, Omer Lachish, Patrick Yang, peterlee, Rafael Wendel, Sebastian Tramp, simonschneider-db, Tim Gates, Tobias Macey, Vipul Mathur, and Vladislav Denisov\n\nOur special thanks to [Sohail Ahmed](https://pk.linkedin.com/in/sohail-ahmed-755776184) for reporting a vulnerability in our \"forgot password\" page (#5425)\n\n### Upgrading\n\n(This section is duplicated from the previous release - since many users will upgrade directly from V8 -> V10)\n\nTypically, if you are running your own instance of Redash and wish to upgrade, you would simply modify the Docker tag in your `docker-compose.yml` file. Since RQ has replaced Celery in this version, there are a couple extra modifications that need to be done in your `docker-compose.yml`:\n\n1. Under `services/scheduler/environment`, omit `QUEUES` and `WORKERS_COUNT` (and omit `environment` altogether if it is empty).\n2. Under `services`, add a new service for general RQ jobs:\n\n```yaml\nworker:\n  <<: *redash-service\n  command: worker\n  environment:\n    QUEUES: \"periodic emails default\"\n    WORKERS_COUNT: 1\n```\n\nFollowing that, force a recreation of your containers with `docker-compose up --force-recreate --build` and you should be good to go.\n### UX\n- Redash now uses a vertical navbar\n- Dashboard list now includes “My Dashboards” filter\n- Dashboard parameters can now be re-ordered\n- Queries can now be executed with Shift + Enter on all platforms.\n- Added New Dashboard/Query/Alert buttons to corresponding list pages\n- Dashboard text widgets now prompt to confirm before closing the text editor\n- A plus sign is now shown between tags used for search\n- On the queries list view “My Queries” has moved above “Archived”\n- Improved behavior for filtering by tags in list views\n- When a user’s session expires for inactivity, they are prompted to log-in with a pop-up so they don’t lose their place in the app\n- Numerous accessibility changes towards the a11y standard\n- Hide the “Create” menu button if current user doesn’t have permission to any data sources\n\n### Visualizations\n- Feature: Added support for horizontal box plots\n- Feature: Added support for horizontal bar charts\n- Feature: Added “Reverse” option for Chart visualization legend\n- Feature: Added option to align Chart Y-axes at zero\n- Feature: The table visualization header is now fixed when scrolling\n- Feature: Added USA map to choropleth visualization\n- Fix: Selected filters were reset when switching visualizations\n- Fix: Stacked bar chart showed the wrong Y-axis range in some cases\n- Fix: Bar chart with second y axis overlapped data series\n- Fix: Y-axis autoscale failed when min or max was set\n- Fix: Custom JS visualization was broken because of a typo\n- Fix: Too large visualization caused filters block to collapse\n- Fix: Sankey visualization looked inconsistent if the data source returned VARCHAR instead of numeric types\n\n### Structural Updates\n- Redash now prevents CSRF attacks\n- Migration to TypeScript\n- Upgrade to Antd version 4\n### Data Sources\n- New Data Sources: SPARQL Endpoint, Eccenca Corporate Memory, TrinoDB\n- Databricks\n  - Custom Schema Browser that allows switching between databases\n  - Option added to truncate large results\n  - Support for multiple-statement queries\n  - Schema browser can now use eventlet instead of RQ\n- MongoDB:\n  - Moved Username and Password out of the connection string so that password can be stored secretly\n- Oracle:\n  - Fix: Annotated queries always failed. Annotation is now disabled\n- Postgres/CockroachDB:\n  - SSL certfile/keyfile fields are now handled as secret\n- Python:\n  - Feature: Custom built-ins are now supported\n  - Fix: Query runner was not compatible with Python 3\n- Snowflake:\n  - Data source now accepts a custom host address (for use with proxies)\n- TreasureData:\n  - API key field is now handled as secret\n- Yandex:\n  - OAuth token field is now handled as secret\n\n### Alerts\n- Feature: Added ability to mute alerts without deleting them\n- Change: Non-email alert destination details are now obfuscated to avoid leaking sensitive information (webhook URLs, tokens etc.)\n- Fix: numerical comparisons failed if value from query was a string\n\n### Parameters\n- Added “Last 12 months” option for dynamic date ranges\n\n### Bug Fixes\n- Fix: Private addresses were not allowed even when enforcing was disabled \n- Fix: Python query runner wasn’t updated for Python 3\n- Fix: Sorting queries by schedule returned the wrong order\n- Fix: Counter visualization was enormous in some cases\n- Fix: Dashboard URL will now change when the dashboard title changes\n- Fix: URL parameters were removed when forking a query\n- Fix: Create link on data sources page was broken\n- Fix: Queries could be reassigned to read-only data sources\n- Fix: Multi-select dropdown was very slow if there were 1k+ options\n- Fix: Search Input couldn’t be focused or updated while editing a dashboard\n- Fix: The CLI command for “status” did not work\n- Fix: The dashboard list screen displayed too few items under certain pagination configurations\n\n### Other\n- Added an environment variable to disable public sharing links for queries and dashboards\n- Alert destinations are now encrypted at the database\n- The base query runner now has stubs to implement result truncating for other data sources\n- Static SAML configuration and assertion encryption are now supported\n- Adds new component for adding extra actions to the query and dashboard pages\n- Non-admins with at least view_only permission on a dashboard can now make GET requests to the data source resource\n- Added a BLOCKED_DOMAINS setting to prevent sign-ups from emails at specific domains\n- Added a rate limit to the “forgot password” page\n- RQ workers will now shutdown gracefully for known error codes\n- Scheduled execution failure counter now resets following a successful ad hoc execution\n- Redash now deletes locks for cancelled queries\n- Upgraded Ace Editor from v6 to v9\n- Added a periodic job to remove ghost locks\n- Removed content width limit on all pages\n- Introduce a <Link> React component\n\n## v9.0.0-beta - 2020-06-11\n\nThis release was long time in the making and has several major changes:\n\n- Our backend code was updated to support Python 3 and we no longer support Python 2. If you're using our Docker images, this should be a transparent change for you.\n- We replaced Celery with RQ for background jobs processing. This will require some setup updates -- see instructions below.\n- The frontend code is now 100% React and we removed all the Angular dependencies.\n\nThis release was made possible by contributions from over 50 people: @ari-e, @ariarijp, @arihantsurana, @arikfr, @atharvai, @cemremengu, @chulucninh09, @citrin, @daniellangnet, @DavidHernandez, @deecay, @dmudro, @erans, @erels, @ezkl, @gabrieldutra, @gstaykov, @ialeinikov, @ikenji, @Jakdaw, @jezdez, @juanvasquezreyes, @koooge, @kravets-levko, @kykrueger, @leibowitz, @leosunmo, @lihan, @loganprice, @mickeey2525, @mnoorenberghe, @monicagangwar, @NicolasLM, @p-yang, @Ralnoc, @ranbena, @randyzwitch, @rauchy, @rxin, @saravananselvamohan, @satyamkrishna, @shinsuke-nara, @stefan-mees, @stevebuckingham, @susodapop, @taminif, @thewarpaint, @tsuyoshizawa, @uncletimmy3, @wengkham.\n\n### Upgrading\n\nTypically, if you are running your own instance of Redash and wish to upgrade, you would simply modify the Docker tag in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

User is now prompted to edit or execute the query.\n- Mobile Experience Improvements:\n  - UI element spacing has been redesigned for clarity\n  - Admin pages now honor max-width. Tables scroll independent of the top menu.\n  - Large legends no longer shrink the visualization on small screens.\n  - Fix: it was sometimes impossible to scroll pages with dashboards because the visualizations captured every touch event.\n  - Fix: Visualizations on small screens would not always show horizontal scroll bars.\n- Dashboards can now be un-archived using the API.\n- Dashboard UI performance was improved.\n- List pages were changed to show a user's name instead of avatar.\n- Search-enabled tables now show a prompt for which columns will be searched.\n- In the visualization editor, the settings pane now scrolls independent of the visualization preview.\n- Tokens in the schema viewer now sort alphabetically.\n- Links to settings panes that require Admin privileges are now hidden from non-Admins.\n- The Admin page now remembers which tab you were viewing after a page reload.\n\n### Visualizations\n\n- Feature: Allow bubble size control with either coefficient or sizemode.\n- Feature: Table visualization now treats Unix timestamps in query results as timestamps.\n- Feature: It's now possible to provide a description to each Table column, appearing in UI as a tooltip.\n- Feature: Added tooltip and popover templating to the map with markers visualization.\n- Feature: Added an organization setting to hide the Plotly mode bar on all visualizations.\n- Feature: Cohort visualization now has appearance settings.\n- Feature: Add option to explicitly set Chart legend position.\n- Change: Deprecated visualizations are now hidden.\n- Change: Table settings editor now extends vertically instead of horizontally.\n- Change: The maximum table pagination is now 500.\n- Change: Pie chart labels maintain contrast against lighter slices.\n- Fix: Chart series switched places when picking Y axis.\n- Fix: Third column was not selectable for Bubble and Heatmap charts.\n- Fix: On the counter visualizations, the “count rows” option showed an empty string instead of 0.\n- Fix: Table visualization with column named \"children\" rendered +/- buttons.\n- Fix: Sankey visualization now correctly occupies all available area even with fewer stages.\n- Fix: Pie chart ignores series labels.\n\n### Data Sources\n\n- New Data Sources: Amazon Cloudwatch, Amazon CloudWatch Logs Insights, Azure Kusto, Exasol.\n- Athena:\n  - Added the option to specify a base cost in settings, displaying a price for each query when executed.\n- BigQuery:\n  - Fix: large jobs continued running after the user clicked “Cancel” query execution.\n- Cassandra:\n  - Updated driver to 3.21.0 which dramatically reduces Docker build times.\n  - SSL options are now available.\n- Clickhouse:\n  - You can now choose whether to verify the SSL certificate.\n- Databricks:\n  - Databricks now use an ODBC-based connector.\n  - Fix: Date column was coerced to DateTime in the front-end.\n- Druid:\n  - Added username and password authentication option.\n- Microsoft SQL Server\n  - Added support for ODBC connections via pyodbc.

Otherwise certain timestamps would only appear as strings in the front-end.\n- TreasureData:\n  - Fix: API calls would fail when setting a non-default region.\n\n### Alerts\n\n- Feature: Added ability to mute alerts without deleting them.\n- Fix: numerical comparisons failed if value from query was a string.\n\n### Parameters\n\n- Added Last x Days options for date range parameters.\n- Fix: Parameters added in empty queries were always added as text parameters\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- Fix: Alembic migration schema was preventing v4 users from upgrading. In v5 we started encrypting data source credentials in the database.\n- Fix: System admin dashboard would not show correct database size if non-default name was used.\n- Fix: refresh_queries job would break if any query had a bad schedule object.\n- Fix: Orgs with LDAP enabled couldn’t disable password login.\n- Fix: SSL mode was sometimes sent as an empty string to the database instead of omitted entirely.\n- Fix: When creating new Map visualization with clustering disabled, map would crash on save.\n- Fix: It was possible on the New Query page to click “Save” multiple times, causing multiple new query records to be created.\n- Fix: Visualization render errors on a dashboard would crash the entire page.\n- Fix: A scheduled execution failure would modify the query’s “updated_at” timestamp.\n- Fix: Parameter UI would wrap awkwardly during some drag operations.\n- Fix: In dashboard edit mode, users couldn’t modify widgets.\n- Fix: Frontend error when parsing a NaN float.\n\n### Other\n\n- Added TSV as a download format (in addition to CSV and Excel).\n- Added maildev settings (helps with automated settings).\n- Refine permissions usage in Redash to allow for guest users\n- The query results API now explicitly handles 404 errors.\n- Forked queries now retain the tags of the original query.\n- We now allow setting custom Sentry environments.\n- Started using Black linter for our Python source code\n- Added CLI command to re-encrypt data source details with new secret key.\n- Favorites list is now loaded on menu click instead of on page load.\n- Administrators can now allow connections to private IP addresses.\n\n## v8.0.0 - 2019-10-27\n\nThere were no changes in this release since `v8.0.0-beta.2`. This is just to mark a stable release.\n\n## v8.0.0-beta.2 - 2019-09-16\n\nThis is an update to the previous beta release, which includes:\n\n- Add options for users to share anonymous usage information with us (see [docs](https://redash.io/help/open-source/admin-guide/usage-data) for details).\n- Visualizations:\n  - Allow the user to decide how to handle null values in charts.\n- Upgrade Sentry-SDK to latest version.\n- Make horizontal table scroll visible in dashboard widgets without scrolling.\n- Data Sources:\n  - Add support for Azure Data Explorer (Kusto).\n  - MySQL: fix connections without SSL configuration failing.\n  - Amazon Redshift: option to set query group for adhoc/scheduled queries.\n  - Hive: make error message more friendly.\n  - Qubole: add support to run Quantum queries.\n- Display data source icon in query editor.\n- Fix: allow users with view only acces to use the queries in Query Results\n- Dashboard: when updating parameters refersh only widgets that use those parameters.\n\nThis release had contributions from 12 people: @arikfr, @cclauss, @gabrieldutra, @justinclift, @kravets-levko, @ranbena, @rauchy, @sandeepV2, @shinsuke-nara, @spacentropy, @sphenlee, @swfz.\n\n## v8.0.0-beta - 2019-08-18\n\nAfter months of being heads down with hard work, it's finally time to wrap up the V8 release 🤩 This release includes many long awaited improvements to parameters, UX improvements, further React migration and other changes, fixes and improvements.\n\nWhile this version is already running on the hosted platform to make sure it's stable, we're excited to put this in the hands of our Open Source users.\n\nStarting from this release we will no longer build a tarball distribution of the codebase and recommend everyone to switch over to using our Docker images.

Focusing on the bigger changes, but for whoever interested, you can see all the changes [here](https://github.com/getredash/redash/compare/v6.0.0...master).\n\nBesides all the features, bug fixes and improvements listed below we managed to convert a large portion of Redash's frontend code from Angular.js to React. You can see status in [#3071](https://github.com/getredash/redash/issues/3071).\n\nThis release was made possible with the help of 34 contributors. 🙇‍♂️\n\n### Data Sources\n\n- **All data source options are now encrypted in the database.** By default the encryption uses the `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET` value (`redash.settings.COOKIE_SECRET`), but you can specify a different value by setting the `REDASH_SECRET_KEY` environment variable value. Note that you need to set this _before_ doing the upgrade.\n- New Data Sources: Uptycs and Apache Drill.\n- Snowplow: is now enabled by default & supports region setting.\n- Elasticsearch: add support for Amazon Elasticsearch IAM authentication (with IAM profile or key/secret pair).\n- PostgreSQL: add support for serializing range values.\n- Redshift: remove duplicate column information for late-binding views.\n- Athena: load all databases (using pagination).\n- BigQuery: correctly handle temp tables with no schema field.\n- Jira (JQL): support for fetching all records with pagination.\n- Prometheus: fix schema loading and add support for query range.\n\n### In-app Help\n\nYou can now open the [Knowledge Base](https://redash.io/help) inside the application. We also added a few \"help triggers\" in the app, that will open the Knowledge Base in context of what you're currently doing.\n\n### Parameters\n\n- **Dashboard Parameters**: We improved the flow of adding queries with parameters to dashboards and now give you full control over how parameters are mapped. You no longer have to make sure all parameters have the same name or use the `Global` checkbox. We also added new options, like keeping the parameter local to the widget or setting a static value. [Read more in our Knowledge Base →](https://redash.io/help/user-guide/querying/query-parameters#Parameter-Mapping-on-Dashboards)\n- We added server side validation of parameter values for all parameter types, except for parameters of `text` type. All validated parameter types are considered safe. When a query is using safe parameters (or no parameters at all), View Only users can refresh it.\n- Refreshing safe queries is done using the new results API endpoint, which takes only a query ID (and optionally parameter values) and does not need the query text.\n\n### Query Editor Improvements\n\n- Run only the highlighted query text: hit Execute after highlighting a portion of your query and only the selected portion will be sent to the database. This is useful for testing sub-SELECT statements and CTE's.\n- Improved auto complete: add a dot . after a table name in the query editor and auto complete will only suggest columns on that table.\n- Autosave parameter configuration changes.\n- YAML syntax support (for data sources like Yandex Metrica).\n\n### Improved Query Scheduler\n\nThe Query Scheduler got a face lift and some new options: you can pick a day for a weekly schedule to run on and also set an end date after which the query will no longer execute on schedule.\n\n### Data Sources\n\nWe added Apache Drill, Uptycs and a new JSON data source. Also fixed a few bugs in Athena's query runner and others.\n\n### User Management\n\nThe users page got revamped with a new look and feel and few new features:\n\n- An indication when a user was last active.\n- Show if an invited user hasn't finished the setup process yet (Pending Invitations section).\n- You can now generate a new API key for users, if there's a concern it was compromised.\n\n### Admin\n\n- New Celery queues status screens, replacing the old Queries Status and better reflecting the status of running queries.\n- Make the queue name for schema refresh job configurable. The default used to be hard coded `schemas`, which is not available on all setups. Now it's `celery`.\n- The `gevent` library is installed by default, and you can now setup gunicorn to use `gevent` based workers.\n- New Docker entrypoint command to do a health check for a worker process.\n- Flask-Admin is no longer setup or supported.\n\n### Other Changes\n\n- New Alert destination: Google Hangouts Chat.\n- When downloading results from the results API it will set a user friendly filename for the downloaded file.\n- Archived Queries section added to the queries list.\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- Fixed: fork query does not fork tables but instead adds default table.\n- Fixed: when deleting a visualization, any widget using it was left empty on the dashboard.\n- Fixed: issues with Query Editor resizing on new versions of Chrome.\n- Fixed: issues with exporting dictionaries to Excel.\n- Fixed: Cohort visualization gets stuck when passing string values.\n- Fixed: use series name for Pie chart label.\n- Make sure Flask app created in Celery's worker process (could cause some query runners to get stuck while running queries).\n\n## v6.0.0 - 2018-12-16\n\nv6.0.0 release version.

Remove the `REDASH_STATIC_ASSETS_PATH` definition.\n\nMake sure to make these changes before running upgrade as otherwise it will fail.\n\nWe're releasing a new upgrade script -- see [here](https://redash.io/help-onpremise/maintenance/how-to-upgrade-redash.html) for details.\n\n### Added\n\n- [#1546](https://github.com/getredash/redash/pull/1546) Add: API docstrings (@washort)\n-

These are guidelines, not rules, please use your best judgement and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.\n\n:star: If you're already here and love the project, please make sure to press the Star button. :star:\n## Table of Contents\n\n[How can I contribute?](#how-can-i-contribute)\n\n- [Reporting Bugs](#reporting-bugs)\n- [Suggesting Enhancements / Feature Requests](#suggesting-enhancements--feature-requests)\n- [Pull Requests](#pull-requests)\n- [Documentation](#documentation)\n- Design?\n\n[Additional Notes](#additional-notes)\n\n- [Release Method](#release-method)\n- [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct)\n\n## Quick Links:\n\n- [User Forum](https://github.com/getredash/redash/discussions)\n- [Documentation](https://redash.io/help/)\n\n\n---\n## How can I contribute?\n\n### Reporting Bugs\n\nWhen creating a new bug report, please make sure to:\n\n- Search for existing issues first. If you find a previous report of your issue, please update the existing issue with additional information instead of creating a new one.\n- If you are not sure if your issue is really a bug or just some configuration/setup problem, please start a [Q&A discussion](https://github.com/getredash/redash/discussions/new?category=q-a) first. Unless you can provide clear steps to reproduce, it's probably better to start with a discussion and later to open an issue.\n- If you still decide to open an issue, please review the template and guidelines and include as much details as possible.\n\n### Suggesting Enhancements / Feature Requests\n\nIf you would like to suggest an enhancement or ask for a new feature:\n\n- Please check [the Ideas discussions](https://github.com/getredash/redash/discussions/categories/ideas) for existing threads about what you want to suggest/ask. If there is, feel free to upvote it to signal interest or add your comments.\n- If there is no open thread, you're welcome to start one to have a discussion about what you want to suggest. Try to provide as much details and context as possible and include information about *the problem you want to solve* rather only *your proposed solution*.\n\n### Pull Requests\n\n**Code contributions are welcomed**. For big changes or significant features, it's usually better to reach out first and discuss what you want to implement and how (we recommend reading: [Pull Request First](https://medium.com/practical-blend/pull-request-first-f6bb667a9b6#.ozlqxvj36)). This is to make sure that what you want to implement is aligned with our goals for the project and that no one else is already working on it.\n\n#### Criteria for Review / Merging\n\nWhen you open your pull request, please follow this repository’s PR template carefully:\n\n- Indicate the type of change\n  - If you implement multiple unrelated features, bug fixes, or refactors please split them into individual pull requests.\n- Describe the change \n- If fixing a bug, please describe the bug or link to an existing github issue / forum discussion\n- Include UI screenshots / GIFs whenever possible\n- Please add [documentation](#documentation) for new features or changes in functionality along with the code.\n- Please follow existing code style:\n  - Python: we use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) to auto format the code.\n  - Javascript: we use [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) to auto-format the code.\n\n#### Initial Review (1 week)\n\nDuring this phase, a team member will apply the “Team Review” label if a pull request meets our criteria or a “Needs More Information” label if not. If more information is required, the team member will comment which criteria have not been met.\n\nIf your pull request receives the “Needs More Information” label, please make the requested changes and then remove the label. This resets the 1 week timer for an initial review.\n\nStale pull requests that remain untouched in “Needs More Information” for more than 4 weeks will be closed.\n\nIf a team member closes your pull request, you may reopen it after you have made the changes requested during initial review. After you make these changes, remove the “Needs More Information” label. This again resets the timer for another initial review.\n\n#### Full Review (2 weeks)\n\nAfter the “Team Review” label is applied, a member of the core team will review the PR within 2 weeks. \n\nReviews will approve, request changes, or ask questions to discuss areas of uncertainty. After you’ve responded, a member of the team will re-review within one week.\n\n#### Merging (1 week)\n\nAfter your pull request has been approved, a member of the core team will merge the pull request within a week.\n\n### Documentation\n\nThe project's documentation can be found at [https://redash.io/help/](https://redash.io/help/). The [documentation sources](https://github.com/getredash/website/tree/master/src/pages/kb) are hosted on GitHub. To contribute edits / new pages, you can use GitHub's interface. Click the \"Edit on GitHub\" link on the documentation page to quickly open the edit interface.\n\n## Additional Notes\n\n### Release Method\n\nWe publish a stable release every ~3-4 months, although the goal is to get to a stable release every month. \n\nEvery build of the master branch updates the *redash/redash:preview* Docker Image. These releases are usually stable, but might contain regressions and therefore recommended for \"advanced users\" only.\n\nWhen we release a new stable release, we also update the *latest* Docker image tag, the EC2 AMIs and GCE images.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nThis project adheres to the Contributor Covenant [code of conduct](https://redash.io/community/code_of_conduct). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to team@redash.io.\n"
