Simply install quivr-core and add it to your project. You can now ingest your files and ask questions.*\n\n**We will be improving the RAG and adding more features, stay tuned!**\n\n\nThis is the core of Quivr, the brain of Quivr.com.\n\n<!-- ## Demo Highlight 🎥\n\nhttps://github.com/quivrhq/quivr/assets/19614572/a6463b73-76c7-4bc0-978d-70562dca71f5 -->\n\n## Getting Started 🚀\n\nYou can find everything on the [documentation](https://core.quivr.com/).\n\n### Prerequisites 📋\n\nEnsure you have the following installed:\n\n- Python 3.10 or newer\n\n### 30 seconds Installation 💽\n\n\n- **Step 1**: Install the package\n\n  \n\n  ```bash\n  pip install quivr-core # Check that the installation worked\n  ```\n\n\n- **Step 2**: Create a RAG with 5 lines of code\n\n  ```python\n  import tempfile\n\n  from quivr_core import Brain\n\n  if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n      with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode=\"w\", suffix=\".txt\") as temp_file:\n          temp_file.write(\"Gold is a liquid of blue-like colour.\")\n          temp_file.flush()\n\n          brain = Brain.from_files(\n              name=\"test_brain\",\n              file_paths=[temp_file.name],\n          )\n\n          answer = brain.ask(\n              \"what is gold? asnwer in french\"\n          )\n          print(\"answer:\", answer)\n  ```\n## Configuration\n\n### Workflows\n\n#### Basic RAG\n\n![](docs/docs/workflows/examples/basic_rag.excalidraw.png)\n\n\nCreating a basic RAG workflow like the one above is simple, here are the steps:\n\n\n1. Add your API Keys to your environment variables\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = \"myopenai_apikey\"\n\n```\nQuivr supports APIs from Anthropic, OpenAI, and Mistral. It also supports local models using Ollama.\n\n1. Create the YAML file ``basic_rag_workflow.yaml`` and copy the following content in it\n```yaml\nworkflow_config:\n  name: \"standard RAG\"\n  nodes:\n    - name: \"START\"\n      edges: [\"filter_history\"]\n\n    - name: \"filter_history\"\n      edges: [\"rewrite\"]\n\n    - name: \"rewrite\"\n      edges: [\"retrieve\"]\n\n    - name: \"retrieve\"\n      edges: [\"generate_rag\"]\n\n    - name: \"generate_rag\" # the name of the last node, from which we want to stream the answer to the user\n      edges: [\"END\"]\n\n# Maximum number of previous conversation iterations\n# to include in the context of the answer\nmax_history: 10\n\n# Reranker configuration\nreranker_config:\n  # The reranker supplier to use\n  supplier: \"cohere\"\n\n  # The model to use for the reranker for the given supplier\n  model: \"rerank-multilingual-v3.0\"\n\n  # Number of chunks returned by the reranker\n  top_n: 5\n\n# Configuration for the LLM\nllm_config:\n\n  # maximum number of tokens passed to the LLM to generate the answer\n  max_input_tokens: 4000\n\n  # temperature for the LLM\n  temperature: 0.7\n```\n\n3. Create a Brain with the default configuration\n```python\nfrom quivr_core import Brain\n\nbrain = Brain.from_files(name = \"my smart brain\",\n                        file_paths = [\"./my_first_doc.pdf\", \"./my_second_doc.txt\"],\n                        )\n\n```\n\n4. Launch a Chat\n```python\nbrain.print_info()\n\nfrom rich.console import Console\nfrom rich.panel import Panel\nfrom rich.prompt import Prompt\nfrom quivr_core.config import RetrievalConfig\n\nconfig_file_name = \"./basic_rag_workflow.yaml\"\n\nretrieval_config = RetrievalConfig.from_yaml(config_file_name)\n\nconsole = Console()\nconsole.print(Panel.fit(\"Ask your brain !\", style=\"bold magenta\"))\n\nwhile True:\n    # Get user input\n    question = Prompt.ask(\"[bold cyan]Question[/bold cyan]\")\n\n    # Check if user wants to exit\n    if question.lower() == \"exit\":\n        console.print(Panel(\"Goodbye!\", style=\"bold yellow\"))\n        break\n\n    answer = brain.ask(question, retrieval_config=retrieval_config)\n    # Print the answer with typing effect\n    console.print(f\"[bold green]Quivr Assistant[/bold green]: {answer.answer}\")\n\n    console.print(\"-\" * console.width)\n\nbrain.print_info()\n```\n\n5. You are now all set up to talk with your brain and test different retrieval strategies by simply changing the configuration file!\n\n## Go further\n\nYou can go further with Quivr by adding internet search, adding tools, etc. Check the [documentation](https://core.quivr.com/) for more information.\n\n\n## Contributors ✨\n\nThanks go to these wonderful people:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/quivrhq/quivr/graphs/contributors\">\n<img src=\"https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=quivrhq/quivr\" />\n</a>\n\n## Contribute 🤝\n\nDid you get a pull request?
