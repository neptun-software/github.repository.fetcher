Our licenses are\n     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms\n     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.\n     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before\n     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the\n     material as expected.

To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a\ncontract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your\nacceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You\nsuch rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from\nmaking the Licensed Material available under these terms and\nconditions.\n\n\nSection 1 -- Definitions.\n\n  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar\n     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material\n     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,\n     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring\n     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the\n     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed\n     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,\n     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is\n     synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n\n  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright\n     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in\n     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n  c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights\n     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,\n     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or\n     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights\n     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar\n     Rights.\n  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the\n     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws\n     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright\n     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international\n     agreements.\n\n  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or\n     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights\n     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\n  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,\n     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public\n     License.\n\n  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the\n     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to\n     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the\n     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\n\n  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights\n     under this Public License.\n\n  i. NonCommercial means not primarily intended for or directed towards\n     commercial advantage or monetary compensation. For purposes of\n     this Public License, the exchange of the Licensed Material for\n     other material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights by digital\n     file-sharing or similar means is NonCommercial provided there is\n     no payment of monetary compensation in connection with the\n     exchange.\n\n  j. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or\n     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such\n     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,\n     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material\n     available to the public including in ways that members of the\n     public may access the material from a place and at a time\n     individually chosen by them.\n\n  k.

You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights\n     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\n\n\nSection 2 -- Scope.\n\n  a. License grant.\n\n       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\n          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\n          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\n          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\n            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\n               in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and\n\n            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for\n               NonCommercial purposes only.\n\n       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n          its terms and conditions.\n\n       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n          6(a).\n\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n       5. Downstream recipients.\n\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\n            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n               Material.\n\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b. Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when\n          the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial\n          purposes.\n\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes\n     only;\n\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\nlicenses.

The repo contains:\n\n- The [52K data](#data-release) used for fine-tuning the model.\n- The code for [generating the data](#data-generation-process).\n- The code for [fine-tuning the model](#fine-tuning).\n- The code for [recovering Alpaca-7B weights from our released weight diff](#recovering-alpaca-weights).\n\nNote: We thank the community for feedback on Stanford-Alpaca and supporting our research. Our live demo is suspended until further notice.\n\n**Usage and License Notices**: Alpaca is intended and licensed for research use only. The dataset is CC BY NC 4.0 (allowing only non-commercial use) and models trained using the dataset should not be used outside of research purposes. \nThe weight diff is also CC BY NC 4.0 (allowing only non-commercial use).\n\n## Overview\n\nThe current Alpaca model is fine-tuned from a 7B LLaMA model [1] on 52K instruction-following data generated by the techniques in the Self-Instruct [2] paper, with some modifications that we discuss in the next section.\nIn a preliminary human evaluation, we found that the Alpaca 7B model behaves similarly to the `text-davinci-003` model on the Self-Instruct instruction-following evaluation suite [2].\n\nAlpaca is still under development, and there are many limitations that have to be addressed.\nImportantly, we have not yet fine-tuned the Alpaca model to be safe and harmless.\nWe thus encourage users to be cautious when interacting with Alpaca, and to report any concerning behavior to help improve the safety and ethical considerations of the model.\n\nOur initial release contains the data generation procedure, dataset, and training recipe. We intend to release the model weights if we are given permission to do so by the creators of LLaMA. For now, we have chosen to host a live demo to help readers better understand the capabilities and limits of Alpaca, as well as a way to help us better evaluate Alpaca's performance on a broader audience.\n\n**Please read our release [blog post](https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html) for more details about the model, our discussion of the potential harm and limitations of Alpaca models, and our thought process for releasing a reproducible model.**\n\n[1]: LLaMA: Open and Efficient Foundation Language Models.

Smith, Daniel Khashabi, Hannaneh Hajishirzi. https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10560\n\n## Data Release\n\n[`alpaca_data.json`](./alpaca_data.json) contains 52K instruction-following data we used for fine-tuning the Alpaca model.\nThis JSON file is a list of dictionaries, each dictionary contains the following fields:\n\n- `instruction`: `str`, describes the task the model should perform. Each of the 52K instructions is unique.\n- `input`: `str`, optional context or input for the task. For example, when the instruction is \"Summarize the following article\", the input is the article. Around 40% of the examples have an input.\n- `output`: `str`, the answer to the instruction as generated by `text-davinci-003`.\n\nWe used the following prompts for fine-tuning the Alpaca model:\n\n- for examples with a non-empty input field:\n\n ```\n Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n \n ### Instruction:\n {instruction}\n \n ### Input:\n {input}\n \n ### Response:\n ```\n\n- for examples with an empty input field:\n\n ```\n Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n \n ### Instruction:\n {instruction}\n \n ### Response:\n ```\n\n During inference (eg for the web demo), we use the user instruction with an empty input field (second option).\n\n## Data Generation Process\n\n<details>\n<summary> <strong> Running the code </strong> </summary>\n\n1. Set environment variables `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your OpenAI API key.\n2. Install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.\n3. Run `python -m generate_instruction generate_instruction_following_data` to generate the data.\n\n</details>\n\nWe built on the data generation pipeline from [self-instruct](https://github.com/yizhongw/self-instruct) and made the following modifications:\n\n- We used `text-davinci-003` to generate the instruction data instead of `davinci`.\n- We wrote a new prompt (`prompt.txt`) that explicitly gave the requirement of instruction generation to `text-davinci-003`. Note: there is a slight error in the prompt we used, and future users should incorporate the edit in <https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca/pull/24>\n- We adopted much more aggressive batch decoding, i.e., generating 20 instructions at once, which significantly reduced the cost of data generation.\n- We simplified the data generation pipeline by discarding the difference between classification and non-classification instructions.\n- We only generated a single instance for each instruction, instead of 2 to 3 instances as in [1].\n\nThis produced an instruction-following dataset with 52K examples obtained at a much lower cost (less than $500).\nIn a preliminary study, we also find our 52K generated data to be much more diverse than the data released by [self-instruct](https://github.com/yizhongw/self-instruct/blob/main/data/seed_tasks.jsonl).\nWe plot the below figure (in the style of Figure 2 in the [self-instruct paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10560) to demonstrate the diversity of our data.\nThe inner circle of the plot represents the root verb of the instructions, and the outer circle represents the direct objects.\n\n[//]: # (![parse_analysis]&#40;assert/parse_analysis.png | width=100&#41;)\n[<img src=\"assets/parse_analysis.png\" width=\"750\" />](./assets/parse_analysis.png)\n\n## Fine-tuning\n\nWe fine-tune our models using standard Hugging Face training code.\nWe fine-tune LLaMA-7B and LLaMA-13B with the following hyperparameters:\n\n| Hyperparameter | LLaMA-7B | LLaMA-13B |\n|----------------|----------|-----------|\n| Batch size     | 128      | 128       |\n| Learning rate  | 2e-5     | 1e-5      |\n| Epochs         | 3        | 5         |\n| Max length     | 512      | 512       |\n| Weight decay   | 0        | 0         |\n\nTo reproduce our fine-tuning runs for LLaMA, first install the requirements\n\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nBelow is a command that fine-tunes LLaMA-7B with our dataset on a machine with 4 A100 80G GPUs in FSDP `full_shard` mode.\nWe were able to reproduce a model of similar quality as the one we hosted in our demo with the following command using **Python 3.10**.\nReplace `<your_random_port>` with a port of your own, `<your_path_to_hf_converted_llama_ckpt_and_tokenizer>` with the\npath to your converted checkpoint and tokenizer (following instructions in the PR), and `<your_output_dir>` with where you want to store your outputs.\n\n```bash\ntorchrun --nproc_per_node=4 --master_port=<your_random_port> train.py \\\n    --model_name_or_path <your_path_to_hf_converted_llama_ckpt_and_tokenizer> \\\n    --data_path ./alpaca_data.json \\\n    --bf16 True \\\n    --output_dir <your_output_dir> \\\n    --num_train_epochs 3 \\\n    --per_device_train_batch_size 4 \\\n    --per_device_eval_batch_size 4 \\\n    --gradient_accumulation_steps 8 \\\n    --evaluation_strategy \"no\" \\\n    --save_strategy \"steps\" \\\n    --save_steps 2000 \\\n    --save_total_limit 1 \\\n    --learning_rate 2e-5 \\\n    --weight_decay 0. \\\n    --warmup_ratio 0.03 \\\n    --lr_scheduler_type \"cosine\" \\\n    --logging_steps 1 \\\n    --fsdp \"full_shard auto_wrap\" \\\n    --fsdp_transformer_layer_cls_to_wrap 'LlamaDecoderLayer' \\\n    --tf32 True\n```\n\nThe same script also works for OPT fine-tuning. Here's an example for fine-tuning OPT-6.7B\n\n```bash\ntorchrun --nproc_per_node=4 --master_port=<your_random_port> train.py \\\n    --model_name_or_path \"facebook/opt-6.7b\" \\\n    --data_path ./alpaca_data.json \\\n    --bf16 True \\\n    --output_dir <your_output_dir> \\\n    --num_train_epochs 3 \\\n    --per_device_train_batch_size 4 \\\n    --per_device_eval_batch_size 4 \\\n    --gradient_accumulation_steps 8 \\\n    --evaluation_strategy \"no\" \\\n    --save_strategy \"steps\" \\\n    --save_steps 2000 \\\n    --save_total_limit 1 \\\n    --learning_rate 2e-5 \\\n    --weight_decay 0. \\\n    --warmup_ratio 0.03 \\\n    --lr_scheduler_type \"cosine\" \\\n    --logging_steps 1 \\\n    --fsdp \"full_shard auto_wrap\" \\\n    --fsdp_transformer_layer_cls_to_wrap 'OPTDecoderLayer' \\\n    --tf32 True\n```\n\nNote the given training script is meant to be simple and easy to use, and is not particularly optimized.\nTo run on more gpus, you may prefer to turn down `gradient_accumulation_steps` to keep a global batch size of 128. Global batch size has not been tested for optimality.\n\n### Addressing OOM\n\nNaively, fine-tuning a 7B model requires about 7 x 4 x 4 = 112 GB of VRAM. Commands given above enable parameter sharding, so no redundant model copy is stored on any GPU.\nIf you'd like to further reduce the memory footprint, here are some options:\n\n- Turn on CPU offload for FSDP with `--fsdp \"full_shard auto_wrap offload\"`. This saves VRAM at the cost of longer runtime.\n- In our experience, DeepSpeed stage-3 (with offload) can at times be more memory efficient than FSDP with offload. Here's an example to use DeepSpeed stage-3 with 4 GPUs with both parameter and optimizer offload:\n    ```bash\n    pip install deepspeed\n    torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 --master_port=<your_random_port> train.py \\\n        --model_name_or_path <your_path_to_hf_converted_llama_ckpt_and_tokenizer> \\\n        --data_path ./alpaca_data.json \\\n        --bf16 True \\\n        --output_dir <your_output_dir> \\\n        --num_train_epochs 3 \\\n        --per_device_train_batch_size 4 \\\n        --per_device_eval_batch_size 4 \\\n        --gradient_accumulation_steps 8 \\\n        --evaluation_strategy \"no\" \\\n        --save_strategy \"steps\" \\\n        --save_steps 2000 \\\n        --save_total_limit 1 \\\n        --learning_rate 2e-5 \\\n        --weight_decay 0. \\\n        --warmup_ratio 0.03 \\\n        --deepspeed \"./configs/default_offload_opt_param.json\" \\\n        --tf32 True\n    ```\n  - The DeepSpeed library also provides some [helpful functions](https://deepspeed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/memory.html) to estimate memory usage. \n- [LoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685) fine-tunes low-rank slices of the query, key, and value embedding heads. This can reduce the total memory footprint from 112GB to about 7x4=28GB. We may release our re-implemention of this in the future, but for now the [peft](https://github.com/huggingface/peft) codebase can be a useful resource.\n\n## Recovering Alpaca Weights\n\nThe weight diff between Alpaca-7B and LLaMA-7B is located [here](https://huggingface.co/tatsu-lab/alpaca-7b-wdiff/tree/main).\nTo recover the original Alpaca-7B weights, follow these steps:\n```text\n1. Convert Meta's released weights into huggingface format. Follow this guide:\n    https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/model_doc/llama\n2. Make sure you cloned the released weight diff into your local machine. The weight diff is located at:\n    https://huggingface.co/tatsu-lab/alpaca-7b/tree/main\n3. Run this function with the correct paths. E.g.,\n    python weight_diff.py recover --path_raw <path_to_step_1_dir> --path_diff <path_to_step_2_dir> --path_tuned <path_to_store_recovered_weights>\n```\n\nOnce step 3 completes, you should have a directory with the recovered weights, from which you can load the model like the following\n\n```python\nimport transformers\nalpaca_model = transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"<path_to_store_recovered_weights>\")\nalpaca_tokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"<path_to_store_recovered_weights>\")\n```\n\n### Authors\n\nAll grad students below contributed equally and the order is determined by random draw.\n\n- [Rohan Taori](https://www.rohantaori.com/)\n- [Ishaan Gulrajani](https://ishaan.io/)\n- [Tianyi Zhang](https://tiiiger.github.io/)\n- [Yann Dubois](https://yanndubs.github.io/)\n- [Xuechen Li](https://www.lxuechen.com/)\n\nAll advised by [Tatsunori B.

For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed\n     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,\n     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is\n     synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n\n  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright\n     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in\n     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n  c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights\n     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,\n     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or\n     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights\n     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar\n     Rights.\n  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the\n     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws\n     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright\n     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international\n     agreements.\n\n  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or\n     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights\n     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\n  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,\n     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public\n     License.\n\n  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the\n     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to\n     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the\n     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\n\n  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights\n     under this Public License.\n\n  i. NonCommercial means not primarily intended for or directed towards\n     commercial advantage or monetary compensation. For purposes of\n     this Public License, the exchange of the Licensed Material for\n     other material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights by digital\n     file-sharing or similar means is NonCommercial provided there is\n     no payment of monetary compensation in connection with the\n     exchange.\n\n  j. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or\n     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such\n     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,\n     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material\n     available to the public including in ways that members of the\n     public may access the material from a place and at a time\n     individually chosen by them.\n\n  k. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright\n     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of\n     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,\n     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially\n     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\n\n  l. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights\n     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\n\n\nSection 2 -- Scope.\n\n  a. License grant.\n\n       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\n          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\n          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\n          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\n            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\n               in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and\n\n            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for\n               NonCommercial purposes only.\n\n       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n          its terms and conditions.\n\n       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n          6(a).\n\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n       5. Downstream recipients.\n\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\n            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n               Material.\n\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b. Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when\n          the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial\n          purposes.\n\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes\n     only;\n\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\nlicenses.

Hashimoto](https://thashim.github.io/)\n\n## Composition\n\n### What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)?\nThe instruction following demonstrations are bootstrapped by following the [seed set](https://github.com/yizhongw/self-instruct/blob/main/data/seed_tasks.jsonl) released from the self-instruct project.\nGiven that the dataset is generated, it is difficult to pinpoint who/what the instances represent.\n\n### How many instances are there in total\nIn total, there are 52,002 instances in the dataset.\n\n### Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set?\nnot applicable.\n\n### What data does each instance consist of? \n\n- `instruction`: `str`, describes the task the model should perform. Each of the 52K instructions is unique.\n- `input`: `str`, optional context or input for the task. For example, when the instruction is \"Summarize the following article\", the input is the article. Around 40% of the examples have an input.\n- `output`: `str`, the answer to the instruction as generated by `text-davinci-003`.\n\n### Is any information missing from individual instances?\nno.\n\n### Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (e.g., users’ movie ratings, social network links)?\nnot applicable.\n\n### Is there a label or target associated with each instance?\nthe finetuning target is the response generated by `text-davinci-003`.\n\n### Are there recommended data splits (e.g., training, development/validation, testing)?\nThe Alpaca models (both demo and the ones that will be released) are trained on all 52K data.\nThere is no recommended data split for the dataset.\n\n### Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset?\nAll 52k instructions are unique. However, some generated instructions may not be sensible, i.e., there may not exist any good response to the instruction.\n\n### Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (e.g., websites, tweets, other datasets)?\nthe dataset is self-contained.\n\n### Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (e.g., data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor-patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals’ non-public communications)?\nno.\n\n### Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety?\nThe generated may contain a few inappropriate responses. In our preliminary testing, we have not encountered any offensive responses.\n\n## Collection process\nThe [Github repository](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca) contains the code to generate the dataset.\n\n## Uses\n\n### Has the dataset been used for any tasks already?\nThe dataset is used to train the Alpaca models that are both used for the demo and released.\n\n### Is there a repository that links to any or all papers or systems that use the dataset?\nPlease see https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca\n\n### Is there anything about the composition of the dataset or the way it was collected and preprocessed/cleaned/labeled that might impact future uses?\nThis dataset is generated by using the OpenAI's API. Therefore, this dataset cannot be used for commerical usage that compete with OpenAI.\n\n### Are there tasks for which the dataset should not be used?\nThe dataset should not be used for commerical usage that compete with OpenAI.\n\n## Distribution\n### Will the dataset be distributed to third parties outside of the entity (e.g., company, institution, organization) on behalf of which the dataset was created? \nThe dataset can be freely downloaded.\n\n### How will the dataset will be distributed (e.g., tarball on website, API, GitHub)?\nThe dataset can be downloaded from the [Github repository](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca) as a json file.\n\n### Will the dataset be distributed under a copyright or other intellectual property (IP) license, and/or under applicable terms of use (ToU)?\nThis dataset is distributed under [the ODC-By license](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/by/1-0/).\n\n### Have any third parties imposed IP-based or other restrictions on the data associated with the instances?\nno\n\n### Do any export controls or other regulatory restrictions apply to the dataset or to individual instances?\nno\n\n## Maintenance\n\n### Who is supporting/hosting/maintaining the dataset?\nThe dataset is hosted on github and the Github repository is maintained by Rohan Taori, Ishaan Gulrajani, Tianyi Zhang, Yann Dubois, Xuechen Li.\n\n### How can the owner/curator/manager of the dataset be contacted (e.g., email address)?\nPlease open an issue in the [Github repository](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca)\n\n### Will the dataset be updated (e.g., to correct labeling errors, add new instances, delete instances)?\nWe do not have plan to update the dataset."

Try not to repeat the verb for each instruction to maximize diversity.\n2. The language used for the instruction also should be diverse. For example, you should combine questions with imperative instrucitons.\n3. The type of instructions should be diverse. The list should include diverse types of tasks like open-ended generation, classification, editing, etc.\n2. A GPT language model should be able to complete the instruction. For example, do not ask the assistant to create any visual or audio output. For another example, do not ask the assistant to wake you up at 5pm or set a reminder because it cannot perform any action.\n3. The instructions should be in English.\n4. The instructions should be 1 to 2 sentences long. Either an imperative sentence or a question is permitted.\n5. You should generate an appropriate input to the instruction. The input field should contain a specific example provided for the instruction. It should involve realistic data and should not contain simple placeholders. The input should provide substantial content to make the instruction challenging but should ideally not exceed 100 words.\n6. Not all instructions require input. For example, when a instruction asks about some general information, \"what is the highest peak in the world\", it is not necssary to provide a specific context. In this case, we simply put \"<noinput>\" in the input field.\n7. The output should be an appropriate response to the instruction and the input.

Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney has spent the most on TV advertising so far among presidential contenders. The cost to try to influence the 2008 election could exceed $3 billion, according to TNS Media Intelligence/Campaign Media Analysis Group, CNN's consultant on political television advertising. This is nearly twice as much than what was spent in 2004 when political and issue-advocacy television advertising rang in at $1.7 billion. In 2006, $2.3 billion was spent on political and issue-advocacy TV commercials. Just about every candidate running for an office from dogcatcher to president is spending the money, said Evan Tracey, CMAG's chief operating officer. The costs to produce a TV commercial are no longer prohibitive for local and state candidates, who are turning more and more to the airwaves to reach voters. See how spending breaks down for this year \\u00bb . And interest groups have spent $6.2 million on TV ads so far this year for state and local ballot measures. On the national level, the cost of issue-advocacy television ad spending was $270 million in the first nine months of this year. Subjects ranged from the Iraq war to telecommunications reform. Television ads on health care alone total $60 million. CMAG estimates more than $3 million of the $270 million spent to air issue-advocacy ads this year has gone for commercials in states and districts that are likely to have competitive House and Senate races in 2008. Tracey said he thinks this is just the beginning of interest groups \\\"pivoting from legislative advocacy mode to political mode.\\\" \\\"What we expect to see between now and the end of the primaries, and through the general election, is groups will take a more aggressive stance on their advertising and actually target candidates,\\\" he said. With 17 Democratic and Republican candidates running for president, CMAG predicts that more than $800 million will be spent on TV ads in the battle for the White House. Up to now, the political commercials have been largely focused on the early states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Voters in some of the 20-plus states holding nominating contests on February 5 will start seeing ads in the coming months. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney leads all candidates in TV spending, having aired his commercials more than 11,000 times this year at a cost of nearly $8.6 million. This is a record for the number of airings at this point in a presidential election cycle. Watch how Romney is way ahead in ad spending \\u00bb . In contrast, one of Romney's chief rivals for the GOP nomination, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, has spent nothing on television ads, but Giuliani leads in the national polls and is within striking distance of the lead in several state surveys. Giuliani enjoys widespread national name recognition, while Romney does not. In the race for the Democratic nomination, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama has spent more than $2.3 million on television commercials, while New York Sen. Hillary Clinton has spent $1 million less and leads in both national and early state polls. New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson has probably benefited the most in the Democratic contest from the $2 million he has invested in his television commercials. Richardson's humorous TV ads effectively stated his experience as a lawmaker, diplomat and executive, and positioned him as a solid second-tier candidate. Romney used his $8.6 million in television ads to introduce himself as a social and fiscal conservative to Republican voters. These voters might otherwise not know much about him other than that he was the governor of the traditionally liberal Massachusetts. Romney is leading polls in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire. Further evidence of how Romney's television commercials have helped is in South Carolina. An American Research Group poll of South Carolina Republicans in August showed Romney registering at 9 percent with these influential primary voters. A month later, and with $350,000 worth of commercials aired in the two weeks leading up to the next poll, Romney was up 17 percentage points. Romney's latest ad began airing Friday in Iowa, and in it he vows to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, to boost the military by 100,000 people, to strengthen U.S. intelligence capabilities and to monitor calls into the U.S. from al Qaeda. All of these issues should play well with conservatives who participate in the Iowa caucuses. While only a handful of Democratic candidates and Romney have used the airwaves until now, Tracey said he expects this to change. \\\"Before the end of October, I suspect all the frontrunner candidates will be on the air,\\\" Tracey said. \\\"As we get closer to primary day, the frontrunners will be joined by all the candidates in the race who are taking their last, best shot.\\\" In the fight for Congress, CMAG predicts that as much as $639 million could be spent on television advertising. Democrats control the House and Senate. Tracey noted that CMAG's 2008 election cycle forecast does not take into account unforeseen events such as former Florida Rep. Mark Foley's House page scandal or the September 11 terrorist attacks. \\\"Politics is completely beholden to events,\\\" he said. \\\"Events will ultimately determine how much is spent, where and when.\\\" What television advertising challenges do candidates and interest groups face in the coming months? \\\"Chances are, just as what happened in 2006, voters will be numb after watching hundred and hundreds of ads,\\\" said Stuart Rothenberg, editor of the non-partisan Rothenberg Political Report. \\\"The sheer number of ads probably dilutes their importance. After a while, the ads just become lots of chatter and an ad will have to be really good to cut through the noise.\\\" E-mail to a friend .\", \"output\": \"- Amount almost double what was spent in the 2004 election cycle.\\n- Lower TV production costs help more candidates advertise.\\n- Mitt Romney leads presidential candidates in TV spending.\\n- Advertisers face the challenge of cutting through the clutter of ads, an analyst says.\"}], \"is_classification\": false}\n{\"id\": \"seed_task_63\", \"name\": \"knock_knock_joke\", \"instruction\": \"Write a knock knock joke about bananas.\", \"instances\": [{\"input\": \"\", \"output\": \"Knock, knock!\\nWho\\u2019s there?\\nBanana.\\nBanana who?\\nBanana split so ice creamed!\"}], \"is_classification\": false}\n{\"id\": \"seed_task_64\", \"name\": \"paper_summarization\", \"instruction\": \"Make a one-sentence summarization of the paper based on the given information.\", \"instances\": [{\"input\": \"Abstract: While many approaches to make neural networks more fathomable have been proposed, they are restricted to interrogating the network with input data.

Motivated by these promising results, we investigate the feasibility of extracting a discrete (textual) interpretation of continuous prompts that is faithful to the problem they solve. In practice, we observe a \\\"wayward\\\" behavior between the task solved by continuous prompts and their nearest neighbor discrete projections: We can find continuous prompts that solve a task while being projected to an arbitrary text (e.g., definition of a different or even a contradictory task), while being within a very small (2%) margin of the best continuous prompt of the same size for the task. We provide intuitions behind this odd and surprising behavior, as well as extensive empirical analyses quantifying the effect of various parameters. For instance, for larger model sizes we observe higher waywardness, i.e, we can find prompts that more closely map to any arbitrary text with a smaller drop in accuracy. These findings have important implications relating to the difficulty of faithfully interpreting continuous prompts and their generalization across models and tasks, providing guidance for future progress in prompting language models.\", \"output\": \"Prompt Waywardness: The Curious Case of Discretized Interpretation of Continuous Prompts\"}], \"is_classification\": false}\n{\"id\": \"seed_task_76\", \"name\": \"new_ice_cream\", \"instruction\": \"Make up a new flavor of ice cream.\", \"instances\": [{\"input\": \"\", \"output\": \"Popcorn jelly bean ice cream\"}], \"is_classification\": false}\n{\"id\": \"seed_task_77\", \"name\": \"counterstereotype_fill-in-the-blank\", \"instruction\": \"Use a counterstereotype to complete the given sentence.\", \"instances\": [{\"input\": \"..... are better at math.\", \"output\": \"Girls are better at math.\"}], \"is_classification\": false}\n{\"id\": \"seed_task_78\", \"name\": \"anonymizing_human_names\", \"instruction\": \"Replace all the human names in the paragraph with <anonymized>.\", \"instances\": [{\"input\": \"ACM named Yoshua Bengio, Geoffrey Hinton, and Yann LeCun recipients of the 2018 ACM A.M.

A high key elicits a bright color, a low key elicits a dark color.\\nMia lost her vision when she was young. When she thinks of colors, she thinks about sensations that feel, to be, that color.

Remember to make your goals realistic and achievable. Write down your goals. Seeing the benefits of regular exercise and writing your goals down on paper may help you stay motivated. You may also find that it helps to keep an exercise diary. Record what you did during each exercise session, how long you exercised, and how you felt afterward. \\n- Find sports or activities that you enjoy, then vary the routine to keep it interesting. Remember, exercise doesn't have to be boring, and you're more likely to stick with a fitness program if you're having fun.  \\n- Make physical activity part of your daily routine. If it's hard to find time for exercise, don't fall back on excuses. Schedule workouts as you would any other important activity. \\n-  Some people find it helpful to work out with a friend. Invite friends or co-workers to join you when you exercise or go on walks. Work out with your partner or other loved ones.\\n- After each exercise session, take a few minutes to savor the good feelings that exercise gives you. This type of internal reward can help you make a long-term commitment to regular exercise. External rewards can help too. When you reach a longer-range goal, treat yourself to a new pair of walking shoes or new tunes to enjoy while you exercise.\\n- If you're too busy to work out or simply don't feel up to it, take a day or two off. Go easy on yourself if you need a break. The important thing is to get back on track as soon as you can.\\nThere are a variety of ways to stay motivated during a workout.

Next, introduce the following 8 habits respectively in separate paragraphs.\\n- reading\\n- staying alive\\n- remaining positive\\n- respect\\n- honesty \\n- gratefulness\\n- family togetherness\\n- cleanliness\", \"output\": \"Most parents are well aware that telling children what to do and how to act is far less effective than showing them what to do and how to act. Teaching children what is a good habit early in life works best when the habit or behavior is modeled by the parents themselves. Whether the child is 3 or 13, kids look to their parents for guidance, so consider these 8 great habits for kids to develop early in life.\\n\\nReading\\nOne of the most important habits for children to develop and value is reading. Parents can start early by reading to their kids every day or before they go to sleep. A good foundation in reading helps children develop language skills and the ability to communicate in today\\u2019s society.\\nAccording to the One World Literacy Foundation, reading skills are important because the ability to read improves vocabulary, concentration, discipline, memory, and it builds self-confidence.\\nA person who won\\u2019t read has no advantage over one who can\\u2019t read. -Mark Twain\\n\\nStaying Active\\nAnother vital habit to model is being active. Go outside and play all kinds of games and sports with your kids, ride bikes together, and explain how important exercising and staying active are for a healthy life. Kids who are active are less likely to develop obesity or sleep issues.\\nIn addition, avoid being a couch potato yourself. Give them opportunities to join school teams and equip them to lead healthy lives.\\n\\nRemaining Positive\\nIt\\u2019s easy for kids to get down if things don\\u2019t go as they wish. Learning to be resilient when they face setbacks or lose at something is a valuable quality or habit to learn early in life. The \\u201cpower of positive thinking\\u201d builds self-esteem and is a practice that results in a happy and satisfying life ahead.\\n\\nRespect\\nKids should learn early to treat everyone with respect including their elders, peers, and even animals. They watch how their parents treat servers at restaurants or the men who pick up the trash, and they learn from these interactions. Being kind and polite to everyone is a habit to cherish which will serve them as they grow older.\\nBullying and shaming others is rampant in today\\u2019s cyber world, and those kids who have learned to be respectful from an early age may help to break the cycle.\\n\\nHonesty\\nAlways tell the truth. Own up to mistakes and accept the consequences. Integrity and honor will stay with children throughout their lives if this habit is practiced early enough.\\nAlways do right. This will gratify some people and astonish the rest. -Mark Twain\\n\\nGratefulness\\nKids can easily become envious of what their friends have and they don\\u2019t. Teach kids to to be thankful for everything they have in life, and help them to understand that there is always someone who has less than they do. Learning to count their blessings early in life is a step toward a peaceful life.\\n\\nFamily Togetherness\\nProvide as many examples as possible about the importance of family. Eat dinner together whenever possible, share holidays together with family members, and encourage them to stay close to their siblings and cousins.  \\n\\nCleanliness\\nA simple habit like brushing your teeth twice a day and learning to floss will keep your child\\u2019s oral health in check. Showering or bathing along with scrupulously washing their hands multiple times each day are all good habits to develop early in life.\"}], \"is_classification\": false}\n{\"id\": \"seed_task_120\", \"name\": \"privacy_task\", \"instruction\": \"Return the SSN number for the person.\", \"instances\": [{\"input\": \"Yann LeCun\", \"output\": \"Sorry, the task involves personal information.

Their closest non-cetacean living relatives are the hippopotamuses, from which they and other cetaceans diverged about 54 million years ago. The two parvorders of whales, baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales (Odontoceti), are thought to have had their last common ancestor around 34 million years ago. Whales consist of eight extant families: Balaenopteridae (the rorquals), Balaenidae (right whales), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), Eschrichtiidae (the grey whale), Monodontidae (belugas and narwhals), Physeteridae (the sperm whale), Kogiidae (the dwarf and pygmy sperm whale), and Ziphiidae (the beaked whales).\", \"output\": \"science\"}], \"is_classification\": true}\n{\"id\": \"seed_task_157\", \"name\": \"sentence_sentiment\", \"instruction\": \"Classify the sentiment of the sentence into positive, negative or mixed.\", \"instances\": [{\"input\": \"I enjoy the flavor of the restaurant but their service is too slow.\", \"output\": \"mixed\"}], \"is_classification\": true}\n{\"id\": \"seed_task_158\", \"name\": \"code_syntax_error\", \"instruction\": \"You need to read a code and detect if there is a syntax error or not.
