Please read [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for more details.\n\n## About\n\n**Spleeter** is [Deezer](https://www.deezer.com/) source separation library with pretrained models\nwritten in [Python](https://www.python.org/) and uses [Tensorflow](https://tensorflow.org/). It makes it easy\nto train source separation model (assuming you have a dataset of isolated sources), and provides\nalready trained state of the art model for performing various flavour of separation :\n\n* Vocals (singing voice) / accompaniment separation ([2 stems](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/2.-Getting-started#using-2stems-model))\n* Vocals / drums / bass / other separation ([4 stems](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/2.-Getting-started#using-4stems-model))\n* Vocals / drums / bass / piano / other separation ([5 stems](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/2.-Getting-started#using-5stems-model))\n\n2 stems and 4 stems models have [high performances](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/Separation-Performances) on the [musdb](https://sigsep.github.io/datasets/musdb.html) dataset. **Spleeter** is also very fast as it can perform separation of audio files to 4 stems 100x faster than real-time when run on a GPU.\n\nWe designed **Spleeter** so you can use it straight from [command line](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/2.-Getting-started#usage)\nas well as directly in your own development pipeline as a [Python library](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/4.-API-Reference#separator). It can be installed with [pip](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/1.-Installation#using-pip) or be used with\n[Docker](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/2.-Getting-started#using-docker-image).\n\n### Projects and Softwares using **Spleeter**\n\nSince it's been released, there are multiple forks exposing **Spleeter** through either a Guided User Interface (GUI) or a standalone free or paying website. Please note that we do not host, maintain or directly support any of these initiatives.\n\nThat being said, many cool projects have been built on top of ours. Notably the porting to the *Ableton Live* ecosystem through the [Spleeter 4 Max](https://github.com/diracdeltas/spleeter4max#spleeter-for-max) project.\n\n**Spleeter** pre-trained models have also been used by professionnal audio softwares. Here's a non-exhaustive list:\n\n* [iZotope](https://www.izotope.com/en/shop/rx-8-standard.html) in its *Music Rebalance* feature within **RX 8**\n* [SpectralLayers](https://new.steinberg.net/spectralayers/) in its *Unmix* feature in **SpectralLayers 7**\n* [Acon Digital](https://acondigital.com/products/acoustica-audio-editor/) within **Acoustica 7**\n* [VirtualDJ](https://www.virtualdj.com/stems/) in their stem isolation feature\n* [Algoriddim](https://www.algoriddim.com/apps) in their **NeuralMix** and **djayPRO** app suite\n\n🆕 **Spleeter** is a baseline in the ongoing [Music Demixing Challenge](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/music-demixing-challenge-ismir-2021)!\n\n## Spleeter Pro (Commercial version)\n\nCheck out our commercial version : [Spleeter Pro](https://www.deezer-techservices.com/solutions/spleeter/). Benefit from our expertise for precise audio separation, faster processing speeds, and dedicated professional support. \n\n## Quick start\n\nWant to try it out but don't want to install anything ? We have set up a [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deezer/spleeter/blob/master/spleeter.ipynb).\n\nReady to dig into it ? In a few lines you can install **Spleeter**  and separate the vocal and accompaniment parts from an example audio file.\nYou need first to install `ffmpeg` and `libsndfile`. It can be done on most platform using [Conda](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/1.-Installation#using-conda):\n\n```bash\n# install dependencies using conda\nconda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg libsndfile\n# install spleeter with pip\npip install spleeter\n# download an example audio file (if you don't have wget, use another tool for downloading)\nwget https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/raw/master/audio_example.mp3\n# separate the example audio into two components\nspleeter separate -p spleeter:2stems -o output audio_example.mp3\n```\n\n> :warning: Note that we no longer recommend using `conda` for installing spleeter.\n\n> ⚠️ There are known issues with Apple M1 chips, mostly due to TensorFlow compatibility. Until these are fixed, you can use [this workaround](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/issues/607#issuecomment-1021669444).\n\nYou should get two separated audio files (`vocals.wav` and `accompaniment.wav`) in the `output/audio_example` folder.\n\nFor a detailed documentation, please check the [repository wiki](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/1.-Installation)\n\n## Development and Testing\n\nThis project is managed using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/), to run test suite you\ncan execute the following set of commands:\n\n```bash\n# Clone spleeter repository\ngit clone https://github.com/Deezer/spleeter && cd spleeter\n# Install poetry\npip install poetry\n# Install spleeter dependencies\npoetry install\n# Run unit test suite\npoetry run pytest tests/\n```\n\n## Reference\n\n* Deezer Research - Source Separation Engine Story - deezer.io blog post:\n  * [English version](https://deezer.io/releasing-spleeter-deezer-r-d-source-separation-engine-2b88985e797e)\n  * [Japanese version](http://dzr.fm/splitterjp)\n* [Music Source Separation tool with pre-trained models / ISMIR2019 extended abstract](http://archives.ismir.net/ismir2019/latebreaking/000036.pdf)\n\nIf you use **Spleeter** in your work, please cite:\n\n```BibTeX\n@article{spleeter2020,\n  doi = {10.21105/joss.02154},\n  url = {https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.02154},\n  year = {2020},\n  publisher = {The Open Journal},\n  volume = {5},\n  number = {50},\n  pages = {2154},\n  author = {Romain Hennequin and Anis Khlif and Felix Voituret and Manuel Moussallam},\n  title = {Spleeter: a fast and efficient music source separation tool with pre-trained models},\n  journal = {Journal of Open Source Software},\n  note = {Deezer Research}\n}\n```\n\n## License\n\nThe code of **Spleeter** is [MIT-licensed](LICENSE).\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nIf you plan to use **Spleeter** on copyrighted material, make sure you get proper authorization from right owners beforehand.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**Spleeter** is a complex piece of software and although we continously try to improve and test it you may encounter unexpected issues running it. If that's the case please check the [FAQ page](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/wiki/5.-FAQ) first as well as the list of [currently open issues](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter/issues)\n\n### Windows users\n\n   It appears that sometimes the shortcut command `spleeter` does not work properly on windows. This is a known issue that we will hopefully fix soon. In the meantime replace `spleeter separate` by `python -m spleeter separate` in command line and it should work.\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you would like to participate in the development of **Spleeter** you are more than welcome to do so. Don't hesitate to throw us a pull request and we'll do our best to examine it quickly. Please check out our [guidelines](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) first.\n\n## Note\n\nThis repository include a demo audio file `audio_example.mp3` which is an excerpt\nfrom Slow Motion Dream by Steven M Bryant (c) copyright 2011 Licensed under a Creative\nCommons Attribution (3.0) [license](http://dig.ccmixter.org/files/stevieb357/34740)\nFt: CSoul,Alex Beroza & Robert Siekawitch\n"

Spleeter was designed with ease of use, separation performance, and speed in mind. Spleeter is based on Tensorflow [@tensorflow2015-whitepaper] and makes it possible to:\n\n- split music audio files into several stems with a single command line using pre-trained models. A music audio file can be separated into $2$ stems (vocals and accompaniments), $4$ stems (vocals, drums, bass, and other) or $5$ stems (vocals, drums, bass, piano and other).\n- train source separation models or fine-tune pre-trained ones with Tensorflow (provided you have a dataset of isolated sources).\n\nThe performance of the pre-trained models are very close to the published state-of-the-art and is one of the best performing $4$ stems separation model on the common musdb18 benchmark [@musdb18] to be publicly released. Spleeter is also very fast as it can separate a mix audio file into $4$ stems $100$ times faster than real-time (we note, though, that the model cannot be applied in real-time as it needs buffering) on a single Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) using the pre-trained $4$-stems model.\n\n## Purpose\n\nWe release Spleeter with pre-trained state-of-the-art models in order to help the Music Information Retrieval (MIR) research community leverage the power of source separation in various MIR tasks, such as vocal lyrics analysis from audio (audio/lyrics alignment, lyrics transcription...), music transcription (chord transcription, drums transcription, bass transcription, chord estimation, beat tracking), singer identification, any type of multilabel classification (mood/genre...), vocal melody extraction or cover detection.\nWe believe that source separation has reached a level of maturity that makes it worth considering for these tasks and that specific features computed from isolated vocals, drums or bass may help increase performances, especially in low data availability scenarios (small datasets, limited annotation availability) for which supervised learning might be difficult.\nSpleeter also makes it possible to fine-tune the provided state-of-the-art models in order to adapt the system to a specific use-case.\nFinally, having an available source separation tool such as Spleeter will allow researchers to compare performances of their new models to a state-of-the-art one on their private datasets instead of musdb18, which is usually the only used dataset for reporting separation performances for unreleased models.\nNote that we cannot release the training data for copyright reasons, and thus, sharing pre-trained models were the only way to make these results available to the community.\n\n## Implementation details\n\nSpleeter contains pre-trained models for:\n\n- vocals/accompaniment separation.\n- $4$ stems separation as in SiSec [@SISEC18]  (vocals, bass, drums and other).\n- $5$ stems separation with an extra piano stem (vocals, bass, drums, piano, and other). It is, to the authors' knowledge, the first released model to perform such a separation.\n\nThe pre-trained models are U-nets [@unet2017] and follow similar specifications as in [@deezerICASSP2019]. The U-net is an encoder/decoder Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture with skip connections. We used $12$-layer U-nets ($6$ layers for the encoder and $6$ for the decoder). A U-net is used for estimating a soft mask for each source (stem). Training loss is a $L_1$-norm between masked input mix spectrograms and source-target spectrograms. The models were trained on Deezer's internal datasets (noteworthily the Bean dataset that was used in [@deezerICASSP2019]) using Adam [@Adam]. Training time took approximately a full week on a single GPU. Separation is then done from estimated source spectrograms using soft masking or multi-channel Wiener filtering.\n\nTraining and inference are implemented in Tensorflow which makes it possible to run the code on Central Processing Unit (CPU) or GPU.\n\n## Speed\n\nAs the whole separation pipeline can be run on a GPU and the model is based on a CNN, computations are efficiently parallelized and model inference is very fast. For instance, Spleeter is able to separate the whole musdb18 test dataset (about $3$ hours and $27$ minutes of audio) into $4$ stems in less than $2$ minutes, including model loading time (about $15$ seconds), and audio wav files export, using a single GeForce RTX 2080 GPU, and a double Intel Xeon Gold 6134 CPU @ 3.20GHz (CPU is used for mix files loading and stem files export only). In this setup, Spleeter is able to process $100$ seconds of stereo audio in less than $1$ second, which makes it very useful for efficiently processing large datasets.\n\n## Separation performances\n\nThe models compete with the state-of-the-art on the standard musdb18 dataset [@musdb18] while it was not trained, validated or optimized in any way with musdb18 data. We report results in terms of standard source separation metrics [@separation_metrics], namely Signal to Distortion Ratio (SDR), Signal to Artifacts Ratio (SAR), Signal to Interference Ratio (SIR) and source Image to Spatial distortion Ratio (ISR), are presented in the following table compared to Open-Unmix [@Open-Unmix] and Demucs [@demucs] (only SDR are reported for Demucs since other metrics are not available in the paper) which are, to the authors' knowledge, the only released system that performs near state-of-the-art performances.\nWe present results for soft masking and for multi-channel Wiener filtering (applied using Norbert [@Norbert]). As can be seen, for most metrics Spleeter is competitive with Open-Unmix and especially on SDR for all instruments, and is almost on par with Demucs.\n\n\n|           |Spleeter Mask  |Spleeter MWF   |Open-Unmix |Demucs|\n|-----------|---------------|---------------|-----------|------|\n| Vocals SDR|6.55           |6.86           |6.32       |7.05  |\n| Vocals SIR|15.19          |15.86          |13.33      |13.94 |\n| Vocals SAR|6.44           |6.99           |6.52       |7.00  |\n| Vocals ISR|12.01          |11.95          |11.93      |12.04 |\n| Bass SDR  |5.10           |5.51           |5.23       |6.70  |\n| Bass SIR  |10.01          |10.30          |10.93      |13.03 |\n| Bass SAR  |5.15           |5.96           |6.34       |6.68  |\n| Bass ISR  |9.18           |9.61           |9.23       |9.99  |\n| Drums SDR |5.93           |6.71           |5.73       |7.08  |\n| Drums SIR |12.24          |13.67          |11.12      |13.74 |\n| Drums SAR |5.78           |6.54           |6.02       |7.04  |\n| Drums ISR |10.50          |10.69          |10.51      |11.96 |\n| Other SDR |4.24           |4.55           |4.02       |4.47  |\n| Other SIR |7.86           |8.16           |6.59       |7.11  |\n| Other SAR |4.63           |4.88           |4.74       |5.26  |\n| Other ISR |9.83           |9.87           |9.31       |10.86 |\n\nSpleeter [@spleeter] source code and pre-trained models are available on [github](https://www.github.com/deezer/spleeter) and distributed under a MIT license. This repository will eventually be used for releasing other models with improved performances or models separating into more than $5$ stems in the future.\n\n## Distribution\n\nSpleeter is available as a standalone Python package, and also provided as a [conda](https://github.com/conda-forge/spleeter-feedstock) recipe and self-contained [Dockers](https://hub.docker.com/r/researchdeezer/spleeter) which makes it usable as-is on various platforms.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWe acknowledge contributions from Laure Pretet who trained first models and wrote the first piece of code that lead to Spleeter.\n\n## References\n"
