          "content": "# FAQ\n\nThis document covers frequently asked questions.\n\n- For general information about Detectron, please see [`README.md`](README.md).\n- For installation instructions, please see [`INSTALL.md`](INSTALL.md).\n- For a quick getting started guide, please see [`GETTING_STARTED.md`](GETTING_STARTED.md).\n\n#### Q: How do I compute validation AP during training?\n\n**A:** Detectron does not compute validation statistics (e.g., AP) during training because this slows training. Instead, we've implemented a \"validation monitor\", which is a process that polls for new model checkpoints saved by a training job and when one is found performs inference with it by scheduling a job with `tools/test_net.py` asynchronously using free GPUs in our cluster. We have not released the validation monitor because (1) it's a relatively thin wrapper on top of `tools/train_net.py` and (2) the little code that comprises it is specific to our cluster and would not be generally useful.\n\n#### Q: How do I restrict Detectron to use only a subset of the GPUs on a server?\n\n**A:** Don't modify the code; use the [`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#env-vars) environment variable instead.\n\n#### Q: Detection on one image is really slow compared to the reported performance, why?\n\nA: Various algorithms and caches (e.g., from `cudnn`) take some time to warm up. Peak inference performance will not be reached until after a few images have been processed.\n\nAlso potentially relevant: inference with Mask R-CNN on high-resolution images may be slow simply because substantial time is spent upsampling the predicted masks to the original image resolution (this has not been optimized). You can diagnose this issue if the `misc_mask` time reported by `tools/infer_simple.py` is high (e.g., much more than 20-90ms). The solution is to first resize your images such that the short side is around 600-800px (the exact choice does not matter) and then run inference on the resized image.\n\n\n#### Q: How do I implement a custom Caffe2 CPU or GPU operator for use in Detectron?\n\n**A:** Detectron uses a number of specialized Caffe2 operators that are distributed via the [Caffe2 Detectron module](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/tree/master/modules/detectron) as part of the core Caffe2 GitHub repository. If you'd like to implement a custom Caffe2 operator for your project, we have written a toy example illustrating how to add an operator under the Detectron source tree; please see [`detectron/ops/zero_even_op.*`](detectron/ops/) and [`detectron/tests/test_zero_even_op.py`](detectron/tests/test_zero_even_op.py). For more background on writing Caffe2 operators please consult the [Caffe2 documentation](https://caffe2.ai/docs/custom-operators.html).\n\n#### Q: How do I use Detectron to train a model on a custom dataset?\n\n**A:** If possible, we strongly recommend that you first convert the custom dataset annotation format to the [COCO API json format](http://cocodataset.org/#download). Then, add your dataset to the [dataset catalog](detectron/datasets/dataset_catalog.py) so that Detectron can use it for training and inference. If your dataset cannot be converted to the COCO API json format, then it's likely that more significant code modifications will be required. If the dataset you're adding is popular, please consider making the converted annotations publicly available; If code modifications are required, please consider submitting a pull request.\n"

Directory of Image Files\nTo run inference on a directory of image files (`demo/*.jpg` in this example), you can use the `infer_simple.py` tool. In this example, we're using an end-to-end trained Mask R-CNN model with a ResNet-101-FPN backbone from the model zoo:\n\n```\npython tools/infer_simple.py \\\n    --cfg configs/12_2017_baselines/e2e_mask_rcnn_R-101-FPN_2x.yaml \\\n    --output-dir /tmp/detectron-visualizations \\\n    --image-ext jpg \\\n    --wts https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/detectron/35861858/12_2017_baselines/e2e_mask_rcnn_R-101-FPN_2x.yaml.02_32_51.SgT4y1cO/output/train/coco_2014_train:coco_2014_valminusminival/generalized_rcnn/model_final.pkl \\\n    demo\n```\n\nDetectron should automatically download the model from the URL specified by the `--wts` argument. This tool will output visualizations of the detections in PDF format in the directory specified by `--output-dir`. Here's an example of the output you should expect to see (for copyright information about the demo images see [`demo/NOTICE`](demo/NOTICE)).\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"demo/output/17790319373_bd19b24cfc_k_example_output.jpg\" width=\"700px\" />\n  <p>Example Mask R-CNN output.</p>\n</div>\n\n**Notes:**\n\n- When running inference on your own high-resolution images, Mask R-CNN may be slow simply because substantial time is spent upsampling the predicted masks to the original image resolution (this has not been optimized). You can diagnose this issue if the `misc_mask` time reported by `tools/infer_simple.py` is high (e.g., much more than 20-90ms). The solution is to first resize your images such that the short side is around 600-800px (the exact choice does not matter) and then run inference on the resized image.\n\n\n#### 2. COCO Dataset\nThis example shows how to run an end-to-end trained Mask R-CNN model from the model zoo using a single GPU for inference. As configured, this will run inference on all images in `coco_2014_minival` (which must be properly installed).\n\n```\npython tools/test_net.py \\\n    --cfg configs/12_2017_baselines/e2e_mask_rcnn_R-101-FPN_2x.yaml \\\n    TEST.WEIGHTS https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/detectron/35861858/12_2017_baselines/e2e_mask_rcnn_R-101-FPN_2x.yaml.02_32_51.SgT4y1cO/output/train/coco_2014_train:coco_2014_valminusminival/generalized_rcnn/model_final.pkl \\\n    NUM_GPUS 1\n```\n\nRunning inference with the same model using `$N` GPUs (e.g., `N=8`).\n\n```\npython tools/test_net.py \\\n    --cfg configs/12_2017_baselines/e2e_mask_rcnn_R-101-FPN_2x.yaml \\\n    --multi-gpu-testing \\\n    TEST.WEIGHTS https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/detectron/35861858/12_2017_baselines/e2e_mask_rcnn_R-101-FPN_2x.yaml.02_32_51.SgT4y1cO/output/train/coco_2014_train:coco_2014_valminusminival/generalized_rcnn/model_final.pkl \\\n    NUM_GPUS $N\n```\n\nOn an NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU, inference should take about 130-140 ms per image for this example.\n\n\n## Training a Model with Detectron\n\nThis is a tiny tutorial showing how to train a model on COCO. The model will be an end-to-end trained Faster R-CNN using a ResNet-50-FPN backbone. For the purpose of this tutorial, we'll use a short training schedule and a small input image size so that training and inference will be relatively fast. As a result, the box AP on COCO will be relatively low compared to our [baselines](MODEL_ZOO.md). This example is provided for instructive purposes only (i.e., not for comparing against publications).\n\n#### 1. Training with 1 GPU\n\n```\npython tools/train_net.py \\\n    --cfg configs/getting_started/tutorial_1gpu_e2e_faster_rcnn_R-50-FPN.yaml \\\n    OUTPUT_DIR /tmp/detectron-output\n```\n\n**Expected results:**\n\n- Output (models, validation set detections, etc.) will be saved under `/tmp/detectron-output`\n- On a Maxwell generation GPU (e.g., M40), training should take around 4.2 hours\n- Inference time should be around 80ms / image (also on an M40)\n- Box AP on `coco_2014_minival` should be around 22.1% (+/- 0.1% stdev measured over 3 runs)\n\n### 2. Multi-GPU Training\n\nWe've also provided configs to illustrate training with 2, 4, and 8 GPUs using learning schedules that will be approximately equivalent to the one used with 1 GPU above. The configs are located at: `configs/getting_started/tutorial_{2,4,8}gpu_e2e_faster_rcnn_R-50-FPN.yaml`. For example, launching a training job with 2 GPUs will look like this:\n\n```\npython tools/train_net.py \\\n    --multi-gpu-testing \\\n    --cfg configs/getting_started/tutorial_2gpu_e2e_faster_rcnn_R-50-FPN.yaml \\\n    OUTPUT_DIR /tmp/detectron-output\n```\n\nNote that we've also added the `--multi-gpu-testing` flag to instruct Detectron to parallelize inference over multiple GPUs (2 in this example; see `NUM_GPUS` in the config file) after training has finished.\n\n**Expected results:**\n\n- Training should take around 2.3 hours (2 x M40)\n- Inference time should be around 80ms / image (but in parallel on 2 GPUs, so half the total time)\n- Box AP on `coco_2014_minival` should be around 22.1% (+/- 0.1% stdev measured over 3 runs)\n\nTo understand how learning schedules are adjusted (the \"linear scaling rule\"), please study these tutorial config files and read our paper [Accurate, Large Minibatch SGD: Training ImageNet in 1 Hour](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02677). **Aside from this tutorial, all of our released configs make use of 8 GPUs. If you will be using fewer than 8 GPUs for training (or do anything else that changes the minibatch size), it is essential that you understand how to manipulate training schedules according to the linear scaling rule.**\n\n**Notes:**\n\n- This training example uses a relatively low GPU-compute model and thus overhead from Caffe2 Python ops is relatively high. As a result, scaling as the number of GPUs is increased from 2 to 8 is relatively poor (e.g., training with 8 GPUs takes about 0.9 hours, only 4.5x faster than with 1 GPU). As larger, more GPU-compute heavy models are used, the scaling improves.\n"

          "content": "# Installing Detectron\n\nThis document covers how to install Detectron, its dependencies (including Caffe2), and the COCO dataset.\n\n- For general information about Detectron, please see [`README.md`](README.md).\n\n**Requirements:**\n\n- NVIDIA GPU, Linux, Python2\n- Caffe2, various standard Python packages, and the COCO API; Instructions for installing these dependencies are found below\n\n**Notes:**\n\n- Detectron operators currently do not have CPU implementation; a GPU system is required.\n- Detectron has been tested extensively with CUDA 8.0 and cuDNN 6.0.21.\n\n## Caffe2\n\nTo install Caffe2 with CUDA support, follow the [installation instructions](https://caffe2.ai/docs/getting-started.html) from the [Caffe2 website](https://caffe2.ai/). **If you already have Caffe2 installed, make sure to update your Caffe2 to a version that includes the [Detectron module](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/tree/master/modules/detectron).**\n\nPlease ensure that your Caffe2 installation was successful before proceeding by running the following commands and checking their output as directed in the comments.\n\n```\n# To check if Caffe2 build was successful\npython -c 'from caffe2.python import core' 2>/dev/null && echo \"Success\" || echo \"Failure\"\n\n# To check if Caffe2 GPU build was successful\n# This must print a number > 0 in order to use Detectron\npython -c 'from caffe2.python import workspace; print(workspace.NumCudaDevices())'\n```\n\nIf the `caffe2` Python package is not found, you likely need to adjust your `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to include its location (`/path/to/caffe2/build`, where `build` is the Caffe2 CMake build directory).\n\n## Other Dependencies\n\nInstall the [COCO API](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi):\n\n```\n# COCOAPI=/path/to/clone/cocoapi\ngit clone https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi.git $COCOAPI\ncd $COCOAPI/PythonAPI\n# Install into global site-packages\nmake install\n# Alternatively, if you do not have permissions or prefer\n# not to install the COCO API into global site-packages\npython setup.py install --user\n```\n\nNote that instructions like `# COCOAPI=/path/to/install/cocoapi` indicate that you should pick a path where you'd like to have the software cloned and then set an environment variable (`COCOAPI` in this case) accordingly.\n\n## Detectron\n\nClone the Detectron repository:\n\n```\n# DETECTRON=/path/to/clone/detectron\ngit clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron $DETECTRON\n```\n\nInstall Python dependencies:\n\n```\npip install -r $DETECTRON/requirements.txt\n```\n\nSet up Python modules:\n\n```\ncd $DETECTRON && make\n```\n\nCheck that Detectron tests pass (e.g. for [`SpatialNarrowAsOp test`](detectron/tests/test_spatial_narrow_as_op.py)):\n\n```\npython $DETECTRON/detectron/tests/test_spatial_narrow_as_op.py\n```\n\n## That's All You Need for Inference\n\nAt this point, you can run inference using pretrained Detectron models. Take a look at our [inference tutorial](GETTING_STARTED.md) for an example. If you want to train models on the COCO dataset, then please continue with the installation instructions.\n\n## Datasets\n\nDetectron finds datasets via symlinks from `detectron/datasets/data` to the actual locations where the dataset images and annotations are stored. For instructions on how to create symlinks for COCO and other datasets, please see [`detectron/datasets/data/README.md`](detectron/datasets/data/README.md).\n\nAfter symlinks have been created, that's all you need to start training models.\n\n## Advanced Topic: Custom Operators for New Research Projects\n\nPlease read the custom operators section of the [`FAQ`](FAQ.md) first.\n\nFor convenience, we provide CMake support for building custom operators. All custom operators are built into a single library that can be loaded dynamically from Python.\nPlace your custom operator implementation under [`detectron/ops/`](detectron/ops/) and see [`detectron/tests/test_zero_even_op.py`](detectron/tests/test_zero_even_op.py) for an example of how to load custom operators from Python.\n\nBuild the custom operators library:\n\n```\ncd $DETECTRON && make ops\n```\n\nCheck that the custom operator tests pass:\n\n```\npython $DETECTRON/detectron/tests/test_zero_even_op.py\n```\n\n## Docker Image\n\nWe provide a [`Dockerfile`](docker/Dockerfile) that you can use to build a Detectron image on top of a Caffe2 image that satisfies the requirements outlined at the top. If you would like to use a Caffe2 image different from the one we use by default, please make sure that it includes the [Detectron module](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/tree/master/modules/detectron).\n\nBuild the image:\n\n```\ncd $DETECTRON/docker\ndocker build -t detectron:c2-cuda9-cudnn7 .\n```\n\nRun the image (e.g. for [`BatchPermutationOp test`](detectron/tests/test_batch_permutation_op.py)):\n\n```\nnvidia-docker run --rm -it detectron:c2-cuda9-cudnn7 python detectron/tests/test_batch_permutation_op.py\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIn case of Caffe2 installation problems, please read the troubleshooting section of the relevant Caffe2 [installation instructions](https://caffe2.ai/docs/getting-started.html) first. In the following, we provide additional troubleshooting tips for Caffe2 and Detectron.\n\n### Caffe2 Operator Profiling\n\nCaffe2 comes with performance [`profiling`](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/tree/master/caffe2/contrib/prof)\nsupport which you may find useful for benchmarking or debugging your operators\n(see [`BatchPermutationOp test`](detectron/tests/test_batch_permutation_op.py) for example usage).\nProfiling support is not built by default and you can enable it by setting\nthe `-DUSE_PROF=ON` flag when running Caffe2 CMake.\n\n### CMake Cannot Find CUDA and cuDNN\n\nSometimes CMake has trouble with finding CUDA and cuDNN dirs on your machine.\n\nWhen building Caffe2, you can point CMake to CUDA and cuDNN dirs by running:\n\n```\ncmake .. \\\n  # insert your Caffe2 CMake flags here\n  -DCUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR=/path/to/cuda/toolkit/dir \\\n  -DCUDNN_ROOT_DIR=/path/to/cudnn/root/dir\n```\n\nSimilarly, when building custom Detectron operators you can use:\n\n```\ncd $DETECTRON\nmkdir -p build && cd build\ncmake .. \\\n  -DCUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR=/path/to/cuda/toolkit/dir \\\n  -DCUDNN_ROOT_DIR=/path/to/cudnn/root/dir\nmake\n```\n\nNote that you can use the same commands to get CMake to use specific versions of CUDA and cuDNN out of possibly multiple versions installed on your machine.\n\n### Protobuf Errors\n\nCaffe2 uses protobuf as its serialization format and requires version `3.2.0` or newer.\nIf your protobuf version is older, you can build protobuf from Caffe2 protobuf submodule and use that version instead.\n\nTo build Caffe2 protobuf submodule:\n\n```\n# CAFFE2=/path/to/caffe2\ncd $CAFFE2/third_party/protobuf/cmake\nmkdir -p build && cd build\ncmake .. \\\n  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/c2_tp_protobuf \\\n  -Dprotobuf_BUILD_TESTS=OFF \\\n  -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=\"-fPIC\"\nmake install\n```\n\nTo point Caffe2 CMake to the newly built protobuf:\n\n```\ncmake .. \\\n  # insert your Caffe2 CMake flags here\n  -DPROTOBUF_PROTOC_EXECUTABLE=$HOME/c2_tp_protobuf/bin/protoc \\\n  -DPROTOBUF_INCLUDE_DIR=$HOME/c2_tp_protobuf/include \\\n  -DPROTOBUF_LIBRARY=$HOME/c2_tp_protobuf/lib64/libprotobuf.a\n```\n\nYou may also experience problems with protobuf if you have both system and anaconda packages installed.\nThis could lead to problems as the versions could be mixed at compile time or at runtime.\nThis issue can also be overcome by following the commands from above.\n\n### Caffe2 Python Binaries\n\nIn case you experience issues with CMake being unable to find the required Python paths when\nbuilding Caffe2 Python binaries (e.g. in virtualenv), you can try pointing Caffe2 CMake to python\nlibrary and include dir by using:\n\n```\ncmake .. \\\n  # insert your Caffe2 CMake flags here\n  -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=$(python -c \"from distutils import sysconfig; print(sysconfig.get_python_lib())\") \\\n  -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=$(python -c \"from distutils import sysconfig; print(sysconfig.get_python_inc())\")\n```\n\n### Caffe2 with NNPACK Build\n\nDetectron does not require Caffe2 built with NNPACK support. If you face NNPACK related issues during Caffe2 installation, you can safely disable NNPACK by setting the `-DUSE_NNPACK=OFF` CMake flag.\n\n### Caffe2 with OpenCV Build\n\nAnalogously to the NNPACK case above, you can disable OpenCV by setting the `-DUSE_OPENCV=OFF` CMake flag.\n\n### COCO API Undefined Symbol Error\n\nIf you encounter a COCO API import error due to an undefined symbol, as reported [here](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/issues/35),\nmake sure that your python versions are not getting mixed. For instance, this issue may arise if you have\n[both system and conda numpy installed](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36190757/numpy-undefined-symbol-pyfpe-jbuf).\n\n### CMake Cannot Find Caffe2\n\nIn case you experience issues with CMake being unable to find the Caffe2 package when building custom operators,\nmake sure you have run `make install` as part of your Caffe2 installation process.\n"

          "content": "# Detectron Model Zoo and Baselines\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis file documents a large collection of baselines trained with Detectron, primarily in late December 2017. We refer to these results as the *12_2017_baselines*. All configurations for these baselines are located in the `configs/12_2017_baselines` directory. The tables below provide results and useful statistics about training and inference. Links to the trained models as well as their output are provided. Unless noted differently below (see \"Notes\" under each table), the following common settings are used for all training and inference runs.\n\n#### Common Settings and Notes\n\n- All baselines were run on [Big Basin](https://code.facebook.com/posts/1835166200089399/introducing-big-basin) servers with 8 NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU accelerators (with 16GB GPU memory, CUDA 8.0, and cuDNN 6.0.21).\n- All baselines were trained using 8 GPU data parallel sync SGD with a minibatch size of either 8 or 16 images (see the *im/gpu* column).\n- For training, only horizontal flipping data augmentation was used.\n- For inference, no test-time augmentations (e.g., multiple scales, flipping) were used.\n- All models were trained on the union of `coco_2014_train` and `coco_2014_valminusminival`, which is exactly equivalent to the recently defined `coco_2017_train` dataset.\n- All models were tested on the `coco_2014_minival` dataset, which is exactly equivalent to the recently defined `coco_2017_val` dataset.\n- Inference times are often expressed as \"*X* + *Y*\", in which *X* is time taken in reasonably well-optimized GPU code and *Y* is time taken in unoptimized CPU code. (The CPU code time could be reduced substantially with additional engineering.)\n- Inference results for boxes, masks, and keypoints (\"kps\") are provided in the [COCO json format](http://cocodataset.org/#format-data).\n- The *model id* column is provided for ease of reference.\n- To check downloaded file integrity: for any download URL on this page, simply append `.md5sum` to the URL to download the file's md5 hash.\n- All models and results below are on the [COCO dataset](http://cocodataset.org).\n- Baseline models and results for the [Cityscapes dataset](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/) are coming soon!\n\n#### Training Schedules\n\nWe use three training schedules, indicated by the *lr schd* column in the tables below.\n\n- **1x**: For minibatch size 16, this schedule starts at a LR of 0.02 and is decreased by a factor of * 0.1 after 60k and 80k iterations and finally terminates at 90k iterations. This schedules results in 12.17 epochs over the 118,287 images in `coco_2014_train` union `coco_2014_valminusminival` (or equivalently, `coco_2017_train`).\n- **2x**: Twice as long as the 1x schedule with the LR change points scaled proportionally.\n- **s1x** (\"stretched 1x\"): This schedule scales the 1x schedule by roughly 1.44x, but also extends the duration of the first learning rate. With a minibatch size of 16, it reduces the LR by * 0.1 at 100k and 120k iterations, finally ending after 130k iterations.\n\nAll training schedules also use a 500 iteration linear learning rate warm up. When changing the minibatch size between 8 and 16 images, we adjust the number of SGD iterations and the base learning rate according to the principles outlined in our paper [Accurate, Large Minibatch SGD: Training ImageNet in 1 Hour](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02677).\n\n#### License\n\nAll models available for download through this document are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).\n\n#### ImageNet Pretrained Models\n\nThe backbone models pretrained on ImageNet are available in the format used by Detectron. Unless otherwise noted, these models are trained on the standard ImageNet-1k dataset.\n\n- [R-50.pkl](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/detectron/ImageNetPretrained/MSRA/R-50.pkl): converted copy of

ResNeXt-152-32x8d model was trained on ImageNet-**5k** (not the usual ImageNet-1k)\n- Training uses multi-scale jitter over scales {640, 672, 704, 736, 768, 800}\n- Row 1: test-time augmentations are multi-scale testing over {400, 500, 600, 700, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200} and horizontal flipping (on each scale)\n- Row 2: same model as row 1, but without any test-time augmentation (i.e., same as the common baseline configuration)\n- Like the other results, this is a single model result (it is not an ensemble of models)\n\n## Keypoint Detection Baselines\n\n#### Common Settings for Keypoint Detection Baselines (That Differ from Boxes and Masks)\n\nOur keypoint detection baselines differ from our box and mask baselines in a couple of details:\n\n- Due to less training data for the keypoint detection task compared with boxes and masks, we enable multi-scale jitter during training for all keypoint detection models. (Testing is still without any test-time augmentations by default.)\n- Models are trained only on images from `coco_2014_train` union `coco_2014_valminusminival` that contain at least one person with keypoint annotations (all other images are discarded from the training set).\n- Metrics are reported for the person class only (still run on the entire `coco_2014_minival` dataset).\n\n### Person-Specific RPN Baselines\n\n<table><tbody>\n<!-- START PERSON-ONLY RPN TABLE -->\n<!-- TABLE HEADER -->\n<!-- Info: we use wrap text in <sup><sub></sub><sup> to make is small -->\n<th valign=\"bottom\"><sup><sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;backbone&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</sub></sup></th>\n<th valign=\"bottom\"><sup><sub>type</sub></sup></th>\n<th valign=\"bottom\"><sup><sub>lr<br/>schd</sub></sup></th>\n<th valign=\"bottom\"><sup><sub>im/<br/>gpu</sub></sup></th>\n<th valign=\"bottom\"><sup><sub>train<br/>mem<br/>(GB)</sub></sup></th>\n<th valign=\"bottom\"><sup><sub>train<br/>time<br/>(s/iter)</sub></sup></th>\n<th valign=\"bottom\"><sup><sub>train<br/>time<br/>total<br/>(hr)</sub></sup></th>\n<th valign=\"bottom\"><sup><sub>inference<br/>time<br/>(s/im)</sub></sup></th>\n<th valign=\"bottom\"><sup><sub>box AP</sub></sup></th>\n<th valign=\"bottom\"><sup><sub>mask AP</sub></sup></th>\n<th valign=\"bottom\"><sup><sub>kp AP</sub></sup></th>\n<th valign=\"bottom\"><sup><sub>prop.
