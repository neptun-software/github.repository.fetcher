Our goal is to foster a collaborative and inclusive community where diverse perspectives and expertise can drive innovation and enhance the project's capabilities. Whether you are an individual contributor or represent an organization, we invite you to join us in shaping the future of this project. Possible contributions include but not limited to:\n\n- Pushing patches.\n- Code review of pull requests.\n- Documentation, examples and test cases.\n- Readability improvement, e.g., improvement on docstr and comments.\n- Community participation in [issues](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/issues), [discussions](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/discussions), [twitter](https://twitter.com/pyautogen), and [Discord](https://aka.ms/autogen-discord).\n- Tutorials, blog posts, talks that promote the project.\n- Sharing application scenarios and/or related research.\n\nMost contributions require you to agree to a\nContributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us\nthe rights to use your contribution. For details, visit <https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com>.\n\nIf you are new to GitHub [here](https://help.github.com/categories/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/) is a detailed help source on getting involved with development on GitHub.\n\nWhen you submit a pull request, a CLA bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide\na CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., status check, comment). Simply follow the instructions\nprovided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repos using our CLA.\n\nThis project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).\nFor more information see the [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/) or\ncontact [opencode@microsoft.com](mailto:opencode@microsoft.com) with any additional questions or comments.\n\n## Running CI checks locally\n\nIt is important to use `uv` when running CI checks locally as it ensures that the correct dependencies and versions are used.\n\nPlease follow the instructions [here](./python/README.md#setup) to get set up.\n\nFor common tasks that are helpful during development and run in CI, see [here](./python/README.md#common-tasks).\n\n## Roadmap\n\nWe use GitHub issues and milestones to track our roadmap. You can view the upcoming milestones [here]([Roadmap Issues](https://aka.ms/autogen-roadmap).\n\n## Versioning\n\nThe set of `autogen-*` packages are generally all versioned together. When a change is made to one package, all packages are updated to the same version. This is to ensure that all packages are in sync with each other.\n\nWe will update verion numbers according to the following rules:\n\n- Increase minor version (0.X.0) upon breaking changes\n- Increase patch version (0.0.X) upon new features or bug fixes\n\n## Release process\n\n1. Create a PR that updates the version numbers across the codebase ([example](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/pull/4359))\n    2. The docs CI will fail for the PR, but this is expected and will be resolved in the next step\n2. After merging the PR, create and push a tag that corresponds to the new verion. For example, for `0.4.0.dev13`:\n    - `git tag v0.4.0.dev13 && git push origin v0.4.0.dev13`\n3. Restart the docs CI by finding the failed [job corresponding to the `push` event](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/actions/workflows/docs.yml) and restarting all jobs\n4. Run [this](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/actions/workflows/single-python-package.yml) workflow for each of the packages that need to be released and get an approval for the release for it to run\n\n## Triage process\n\nTo help ensure the health of the project and community the AutoGen committers have a weekly triage process to ensure that all issues and pull requests are reviewed and addressed in a timely manner. The following documents the responsibilites while on triage duty:\n\n- Issues\n  - Review all new issues - these will be tagged with [`needs-triage`](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Aneeds-triage).\n  - Apply appropriate labels:\n    - One of `proj-*` labels based on the project the issue is related to\n    - `documentation`: related to documentation\n    - `x-lang`: related to cross language functionality\n    - `dotnet`: related to .NET\n  - Add the issue to a relevant milestone if necessary\n  - If you can resolve the issue or reply to the OP please do.\n  - If you cannot resolve the issue, assign it to the appropriate person.\n  - If awaiting a reply add the tag `awaiting-op-response` (this will be auto removed when the OP replies).\n  - Bonus: there is a backlog of old issues that need to be reviewed - if you have time, review these as well and close or refresh as many as you can.\n- PRs\n  - The UX on GH flags all recently updated PRs. Draft PRs can be ignored, otherwise review all recently updated PRs.\n  - If a PR is ready for review and you can provide one please go ahead. If you cant, please assign someone. You can quickly spin up a codespace with the PR to test it out.\n  - If a PR is needing a reply from the op, please tag it `awaiting-op-response`.\n  - If a PR is approved and passes CI, its ready to merge, please do so.\n  - If it looks like there is a possibly transient CI failure, re-run failed jobs.\n- Discussions\n  - Look for recently updated discussions and reply as needed or find someone on the team to reply.\n- Security\n  - Look through any securty alerts and file issues or dismiss as needed.\n\n## Becoming a Reviewer\n\nThere is currently no formal reviewer solicitation process. Current reviewers identify reviewers from active contributors.\n\n## What makes a good docstring?\n\n- Concise and to the point\n- Describe the expected contract/behavior of the function/class\n- Describe all parameters, return values, and exceptions\n- Provide an example if possible\n\nFor example, this is the docstring for the [TypeSubscription](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/dev/reference/python/autogen_core.html#autogen_core.TypeSubscription) class:\n\n```python\n\"\"\"This subscription matches on topics based on a prefix of the type and maps to agents using the source of the topic as the agent key.\n\nThis subscription causes each source to have its own agent instance.\n\nExample:\n\n    .. code-block:: python\n\n        from autogen_core import TypePrefixSubscription\n\n        subscription = TypePrefixSubscription(topic_type_prefix=\"t1\", agent_type=\"a1\")\n\n    In this case:\n\n    - A topic_id with type `t1` and source `s1` will be handled by an agent of type `a1` with key `s1`\n    - A topic_id with type `t1` and source `s2` will be handled by an agent of type `a1` with key `s2`.\n    - A topic_id with type `t1SUFFIX` and source `s2` will be handled by an agent of type `a1` with key `s2`.\n\nArgs:\n    topic_type_prefix (str): Topic type prefix to match against\n    agent_type (str): Agent type to handle this subscription\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n## Docs when adding a new API\n\nNow that 0.4.0 is out, we should ensure the docs between versions are easy to navigate. To this end, added or changed APIs should have the following added to their docstrings respectively:\n\n```rst\n.. versionadded:: v0.4.1\n\n   Here's a version added message.\n\n.. versionchanged:: v0.4.1\n\n   Here's a version changed message.\n```\n\nSee [here](https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/kitchen-sink/admonitions.html#versionadded) for how they are rendered.\n"

          "content": "## AutoGen FAQs\n\n### What is AutoGen 0.4?\n\nAutoGen v0.4 is a rewrite of AutoGen from the ground up to create a more robust,\nscalable, easier to use, cross-language library for building AI Agents.\nSome key features include asynchronous messaging, support for scalable distributed agents,\nmodular extensible design (bring your own agents, implement behaviors however you like),\ncross-language support, improved observability, and full typing integration.\nIt is a breaking change.\n\n### Why these changes?\n\nWe listened to our AutoGen users, learned from what was working, and adapted to fix what wasn't.\nWe brought together wide-ranging teams working on many different types of AI Agents\nand collaborated to design an improved framework with a more flexible\nprogramming model and better scalability.\n\n### Is this project still maintained?\n\nWe want to reaffirm our commitment to supporting both the original version of AutoGen (0.2) and the redesign (0.4). AutoGen 0.4 is still work-in-progress, and we shared the code now to build with the community. There are no plans to deprecate the original AutoGen anytime soon, and both versions will be actively maintained.\n\n### Who should use it 0.4?\n\nThis code is still experimental, so expect changes and bugs while we work towards a stable 0.4 release. We encourage early adopters to\ntry it out, give us feedback, and contribute.\nFor those looking for a stable version we recommend to continue using 0.2\n\n### I'm using AutoGen 0.2, should I upgrade?\n\nIf you consider yourself an early adopter, you are comfortable making some\nchanges to your code, and are willing to try it out, then yes.\n\n### How do I still use AutoGen 0.2?\n\nAutoGen 0.2 can be installed with:\n\n```sh\npip install autogen-agentchat~=0.2\n```\n\n### Will AutoGen Studio be supported in 0.4?\n\nYes, this is on the [roadmap](#roadmap).\nOur current plan is to enable an implementation of AutoGen Studio\non the AgentChat high level API which implements a set of agent functionalities\n(agents, teams, etc).\n\n### How do I migrate?\n\nFor users familiar with AutoGen, the AgentChat library in 0.4 provides similar concepts.\nWe are working on a migration guide.\n\n### Is 0.4 done?\n\nWe are still actively developing AutoGen 0.4. One exciting new feature is the emergence of new SDKs for .NET. The python SDKs are further ahead at this time but our goal is to achieve parity. We aim to add additional languages in future releases.\n\n### What is happening next? When will this release be ready?\n\nWe are still working on improving the documentation, samples, and enhancing the code. We are hoping to release before the end of the year when things are ready.\n\n### What is the history of this project?\n\nThe rearchitecture of the framework started with multiple Microsoft teams coming together\nto address the gaps and learnings from AutoGen 0.2 - merging ideas from several predecessor projects.\nThe team worked on this internally for some time to ensure alignment before moving work back to the open in October 2024.\n\n### What is the official channel for support?\n\nUse GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/issues) for bug reports and feature requests.\nUse GitHub [Discussions](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/discussions) for general questions and discussions.\n\n### Do you use Discord for communications?\n\nWe are unable to use the old Discord for project discussions, many of the maintainers no longer have viewing or posting rights there. Therefore, we request that all discussions take place on <https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/discussions/>  or the [new discord server](https://aka.ms/autogen-discord).\n\n### What about forks?\n\n<https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/> remains the only official repo for development and support of AutoGen.\nWe are aware that there are thousands of forks of AutoGen, including many for personal development and startups building with or on top of the library. We are not involved with any of these forks and are not aware of any plans related to them.\n\n### What is the status of the license and open source?\n\nOur project remains fully open-source and accessible to everyone. We understand that some forks use different licenses to align with different interests. We will continue to use the most permissive license (MIT) for the project.\n\n### Can you clarify the current state of the packages?\n\nCurrently, we are unable to make releases to the `pyautogen` package via Pypi due to a change to package ownership that was done without our involvement. Additionally, we are moving to using multiple packages to align with the new design. Please see details [here](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/dev/packages/index.html).\n\n### Can I still be involved?\n\nWe are grateful to all the contributors to AutoGen 0.2 and we look forward to continuing to collaborate with everyone in the AutoGen community.\n"

Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n          its terms and conditions.\n\n       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n          6(a).\n\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n       5. Downstream recipients.\n\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\n            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n               Material.\n\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b. Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database;\n\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\nlicenses.

If you are upgrading from AutoGen v0.2, please refer to the [Migration Guide](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/dev/user-guide/agentchat-user-guide/migration-guide.html) for detailed instructions on how to update your code and configurations.\n\n### Hello World\n\nCreate an assistant agent using OpenAI's GPT-4o model.\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nfrom autogen_agentchat.agents import AssistantAgent\nfrom autogen_ext.models.openai import OpenAIChatCompletionClient\n\nasync def main() -> None:\n    agent = AssistantAgent(\"assistant\", OpenAIChatCompletionClient(model=\"gpt-4o\"))\n    print(agent.run(task=\"Say 'Hello World!'\"))\n\nasyncio.run(main())\n```\n\n### Team\n\nCreate a group chat team with an assistant agent, a web surfer agent, and a user proxy agent\nfor web browsing tasks. You need to install [playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/library).\n\n```python\n# pip install -U autogen-agentchat autogen-ext[openai,web-surfer]\n# playwright install\nimport asyncio\nfrom autogen_agentchat.agents import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent\nfrom autogen_agentchat.conditions import TextMentionTermination\nfrom autogen_agentchat.teams import RoundRobinGroupChat\nfrom autogen_agentchat.ui import Console\nfrom autogen_ext.models.openai import OpenAIChatCompletionClient\nfrom autogen_ext.agents.web_surfer import MultimodalWebSurfer\n\nasync def main() -> None:\n    model_client = OpenAIChatCompletionClient(model=\"gpt-4o\")\n    assistant = AssistantAgent(\"assistant\", model_client)\n    web_surfer = MultimodalWebSurfer(\"web_surfer\", model_client)\n    user_proxy = UserProxyAgent(\"user_proxy\")\n    termination = TextMentionTermination(\"exit\") # Type 'exit' to end the conversation.\n    team = RoundRobinGroupChat([web_surfer, assistant, user_proxy], termination_condition=termination)\n    await Console(team.run_stream(task=\"Find information about AutoGen and write a short summary.\"))\n\nasyncio.run(main())\n```\n\n## Why Use AutoGen?\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"autogen-landing.jpg\" alt=\"AutoGen Landing\" width=\"500\">\n</div>\n\nThe AutoGen ecosystem provides everything you need to create AI agents, especially multi-agent workflows -- framework, developer tools, and applications.\n\nThe *framework* uses a layered and extensible design. Layers have clearly divided responsibilities and build on top of layers below. This design enables you to use the framework at different levels of abstraction, from high-level APIs to low-level components.\n\n- [Core API](./python/packages/autogen-core/) implements message passing, event-driven agents, and local and distributed runtime for flexibility and power. It also support cross-language support for .NET and Python.\n- [AgentChat API](./python/packages/autogen-agentchat/) implements a simpler but opinionated API rapid for prototyping. This API is built on top of the Core API and is closest to what users of v0.2 are familiar with and supports familiar multi-agent patterns such as two-agent chat or group chats.\n- [Extensions API](./python/packages/autogen-ext/) enables first- and third-party extensions continuously expanding framework capabilities. It support specific implementation of LLM clients (e.g., OpenAI, AzureOpenAI), and capabilities such as code execution.\n\nThe ecosystem also supports two essential *developer tools*:\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/microsoft/autogen/refs/heads/main/python/packages/autogen-studio/docs/ags_screen.png\" alt=\"AutoGen Studio Screenshot\" width=\"500\">\n</div>\n\n- [AutoGen Studio](./python/packages/autogen-studio/) provides a no-code GUI for building multi-agent applications.\n- [AutoGen Bench](./python/packages/agbench/) provides a benchmarking suite for evaluating agent performance.\n\nYou can use the AutoGen framework and developer tools to create applications for your domain. For example, [Magentic-One](./python/packages/magentic-one-cli/) is a state-of-art multi-agent team built using AgentChat API and Extensions API that can handle variety of tasks that require web browsing, code execution, and file handling.\n\nWith AutoGen you get to join and contribute to a thriving ecosystem. We host weekly office hours and talks with maintainers and community. We also have a [Discord server](https://aka.ms/autogen-discord) for real-time chat, GitHub Discussions for Q&A, and a blog for tutorials and updates.\n\n## Where to go next?\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n\n|                      | [![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/AutoGen-Python-blue?logo=python&logoColor=white)](./python)                                                                                     | [![.NET](https://img.shields.io/badge/AutoGen-.NET-green?logo=.net&logoColor=white)](./dotnet)              | [![Studio](https://img.shields.io/badge/AutoGen-Studio-purple?logo=visual-studio&logoColor=white)](./python/packages/autogen-studio)              |\n|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Installation    | [![Installation](https://img.shields.io/badge/Install-blue)](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/dev/user-guide/agentchat-user-guide/installation.html) | *    | [![Install](https://img.shields.io/badge/Install-purple)](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/dev/user-guide/autogenstudio-user-guide/installation.html)    |\n| Quickstart | [![Quickstart](https://img.shields.io/badge/Quickstart-blue)](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/dev/user-guide/agentchat-user-guide/quickstart.html#) | *    | *    |\n| Tutorial        | [![Tutorial](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tutorial-blue)](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/dev/user-guide/agentchat-user-guide/tutorial/models.html)  | *| * |\n| API Reference   | [![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/Docs-blue)](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/dev/reference/index.html#) | *    | [![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/Docs-purple)](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/dev/user-guide/autogenstudio-user-guide/usage.html) |\n| Packages        | [![PyPi autogen-core](https://img.shields.io/badge/PyPi-autogen--core-blue?logo=pypi)](https://pypi.org/project/autogen-core/) <br> [![PyPi autogen-agentchat](https://img.shields.io/badge/PyPi-autogen--agentchat-blue?logo=pypi)](https://pypi.org/project/autogen-agentchat/) <br> [![PyPi autogen-ext](https://img.shields.io/badge/PyPi-autogen--ext-blue?logo=pypi)](https://pypi.org/project/autogen-ext/) | *    | [![PyPi autogenstudio](https://img.shields.io/badge/PyPi-autogenstudio-purple?logo=pypi)](https://pypi.org/project/autogenstudio/) |\n\n</div>\n\n**Releasing soon*\n\nInterested in contributing?

          "content": "# AutoGen: Responsible AI FAQs\n\n## What is AutoGen?\nAutoGen is a framework for simplifying the orchestration, optimization, and automation of LLM workflows. It offers customizable and conversable agents that leverage the strongest capabilities of the most advanced LLMs, like GPT-4, while addressing their limitations by integrating with humans and tools and having conversations between multiple agents via automated chat.\n\n## What can AutoGen do?\nAutoGen is an experimentational framework for building a complex multi-agent conversation system by:\n- Defining a set of agents with specialized capabilities and roles.\n-\tDefining the interaction behavior between agents, i.e., what to reply when an agent receives messages from another agent.\n\nThe agent conversation-centric design has numerous benefits, including that it:\n-\tNaturally handles ambiguity, feedback, progress, and collaboration.\n-\tEnables effective coding-related tasks, like tool use with back-and-forth troubleshooting.\n-\tAllows users to seamlessly opt in or opt out via an agent in the chat.\n-\tAchieves a collective goal with the cooperation of multiple specialists.\n\n## \tWhat is/are AutoGen’s intended use(s)?\nPlease note that AutoGen is an open-source library under active development and intended for  use for research purposes. It should not be used in any downstream applications without additional detailed evaluation of robustness, safety issues and assessment of any potential harm or bias in the proposed application.\n\nAutoGen is a generic infrastructure that can be used in multiple scenarios. The system’s intended uses include:\n\n-\tBuilding LLM workflows that solve more complex tasks: Users can create agents that interleave reasoning and tool use capabilities of the latest LLMs such as GPT-4. To solve complex tasks, multiple agents can converse to work together (e.g., by partitioning a complex problem into simpler steps or by providing different viewpoints or perspectives).\n-\tApplication-specific agent topologies: Users can create application specific agent topologies and patterns for agents to interact. The exact topology may depend on the domain’s complexity and semantic capabilities of the LLM available.\n-\tCode generation and execution: Users can implement agents that can assume the roles of writing code and other agents that can execute code. Agents can do this with varying levels of human involvement. Users can add more agents and program the conversations to enforce constraints on code and output.\n-\tQuestion answering: Users can create agents that can help answer questions using retrieval augmented generation.\n-\tEnd user and multi-agent chat and debate: Users can build chat applications where they converse with multiple agents at the same time.\n\nWhile AutoGen automates LLM workflows, decisions about how to use specific LLM outputs should always have a human in the loop. For example, you should not use AutoGen to automatically post LLM generated content to social media.\n\n## How was AutoGen evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?\n-   We performed testing for Responsible AI harm e.g., cross-domain prompt injection and all tests returned the expected results with no signs of jailbreak.\n-   AutoGen was evaluated on six applications to illustrate its potential in simplifying the development of high-performance multi-agent applications. These applications are selected based on their real-world relevance, problem difficulty and problem-solving capabilities enabled by AutoGen, and innovative potential. These applications involve using AutoGen to solve math problems, question answering, decision making in text world environments, supply chain optimization, etc. For each of these domains AutoGen was evaluated on various success-based metrics (i.e., how often the AutoGen based implementation solved the task). And, in some cases, AutoGen based approach was also evaluated on implementation efficiency (e.g., to track reductions in developer effort to build). More details can be found at: https://aka.ms/autogen-pdf.\n-   We evaluated [a team of AutoGen agents](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/tree/gaia_multiagent_v01_march_1st/samples/tools/autogenbench/scenarios/GAIA/Templates/Orchestrator) on the [GAIA benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12983), and got [SOTA results](https://huggingface.co/spaces/gaia-benchmark/leaderboard) as of March 1, 2024.\n\n\n## What are the limitations of AutoGen? How can users minimize the impact of AutoGen’s limitations when using the system?\nAutoGen relies on existing LLMs. Experimenting with AutoGen would retain common limitations of large language models; including:\n\n- Data Biases: Large language models, trained on extensive data, can inadvertently carry biases present in the source data. Consequently, the models may generate outputs that could be potentially biased or unfair.\n-\tLack of Contextual Understanding: Despite their impressive capabilities in language understanding and generation, these models exhibit limited real-world understanding, resulting in potential inaccuracies or nonsensical responses.\n-\tLack of Transparency: Due to the complexity and size, large language models can act as `black boxes,' making it difficult to comprehend the rationale behind specific outputs or decisions.\n-\tContent Harms: There are various types of content harms that large language models can cause. It is important to be aware of them when using these models, and to take actions to prevent them. It is recommended to leverage various content moderation services provided by different companies and institutions.\n-\tInaccurate or ungrounded content: It is important to be aware and cautious not to entirely rely on a given language model for critical decisions or information that might have deep impact as it is not obvious how to prevent these models to fabricate content without high authority input sources.\n-\tPotential for Misuse: Without suitable safeguards, there is a risk that these models could be maliciously used for generating disinformation or harmful content.\n\n\nAdditionally, AutoGen’s multi-agent framework may amplify or introduce additional risks, such as:\n-\tPrivacy and Data Protection: The framework allows for human participation in conversations between agents. It is important to ensure that user data and conversations are protected and that developers use appropriate measures to safeguard privacy.\n-\tAccountability and Transparency: The framework involves multiple agents conversing and collaborating, it is important to establish clear accountability and transparency mechanisms. Users should be able to understand and trace the decision-making process of the agents involved in order to ensure accountability and address any potential issues or biases.\n-\tTrust and reliance: The framework leverages human understanding and intelligence while providing automation through conversations between agents. It is important to consider the impact of this interaction on user experience, trust, and reliance on AI systems. Clear communication and user education about the capabilities and limitations of the system will be essential.\n-\tSecurity & unintended consequences: The use of multi-agent conversations and automation in complex tasks may have unintended consequences. Especially, allowing LLM agents to make changes in external environments through code execution or function calls, such as install packages, could pose significant risks. Developers should carefully consider the potential risks and ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to prevent harm or negative outcomes, including keeping a human in the loop for decision making.\n\n## What operational factors and settings allow for effective and responsible use of AutoGen?\n-\tCode execution: AutoGen recommends using docker containers so that code execution can happen in a safer manner. Users can use function call instead of free-form code to execute pre-defined functions only. That helps increase the reliability and safety. Users can customize the code execution environment to tailor to their requirements.\n-\tHuman involvement: AutoGen prioritizes human involvement in multi agent conversation. The overseers can step in to give feedback to agents and steer them in the correct direction. In all examples, users confirm code before it is executed.\n-\tAgent modularity: Modularity allows agents to have different levels of information access. Additional agents can assume roles that help keep other agents in check. For example, one can easily add a dedicated agent to play the role of safeguard.\n-\tLLMs: Users can choose the LLM that is optimized for responsible use. The default LLM in all examples is GPT-4o which inherits the existing RAI mechanisms and filters from the LLM provider. We encourage developers to review [OpenAI’s Usage policies](https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies) and [Azure OpenAI’s Code of Conduct](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/openai/code-of-conduct) when using GPT-4o. We encourage developers experimenting with agents to add content moderation and/or use safety metaprompts when using agents, like they would do when using LLMs.\n\n\n"
