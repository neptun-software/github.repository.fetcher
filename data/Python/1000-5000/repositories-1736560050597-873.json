This exceptional software is entirely free and renowned for facilitating swift offline deployments. Core to its efficiency is the ONNXRuntime inference engine, offering 4 to 5 times the speed of PaddlePaddle's engine while ensuring no memory leaks.\n\n🦜 **Supported Languages**: It inherently supports Chinese and English, with self-service conversion required for additional languages. Please refer [here](https://rapidai.github.io/RapidOCRDocs/blog/2022/09/28/%E6%94%AF%E6%8C%81%E8%AF%86%E5%88%AB%E8%AF%AD%E8%A8%80/) for specific language support details.\n\n🔎 **Rationale**: Acknowledging the limitations in [PaddleOCR](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR)'s architecture, we embarked on a mission to simplify OCR inference across diverse platforms. This endeavor culminated in converting PaddleOCR's model to the versatile ONNX format and seamlessly integrating it into Python, C++, Java, and C# environments.\n\n🎓 **Etymology**: Derived from its essence, RapidOCR embodies lightness, velocity, affordability, and intelligence. Rooted in deep learning, this OCR technology underscores AI's prowess and emphasizes compact models, prioritizing swiftness without compromising efficacy.\n\n😉 **Usage Scenarios**:\n\n- **Instant Deployment**: If the pre-existing models within our repository suffice, simply leverage RapidOCR for swift deployment.\n- **Customization**: In case of specific requirements, refine PaddleOCR with your data and proceed with RapidOCR deployment, ensuring tailored results.\n\nIf our repository proves beneficial to your endeavors, kindly consider leaving a star ⭐ on GitHub to show your appreciation. It means the world to us!\n\n### Visualization ([more](https://rapidai.github.io/RapidOCRDocs/visualization/))\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"https://github.com/RapidAI/RapidOCR/releases/download/v1.1.0/demo.gif\" alt=\"Demo\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\">\n</div>\n\n### Installation\n\n```bash\npip install rapidocr_onnxruntime\n```\n\n### Usage\n\n```python\nfrom rapidocr_onnxruntime import RapidOCR\n\nengine = RapidOCR()\n\nimg_path = 'tests/test_files/ch_en_num.jpg'\nresult, elapse = engine(img_path)\nprint(result)\nprint(elapse)\n```\n\n### Documentation\n\nFull documentation can be found on [docs](https://rapidai.github.io/RapidOCRDocs/), in Chinese.\n\n### Who use?\n\nUsed by [link](https://github.com/RapidAI/RapidOCR/discussions/286)\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\n- Many thanks to [DeliciaLaniD](https://github.com/DeliciaLaniD) for fixing the misplaced start position of scan animation in ocrweb.\n- Many thanks to [zhsunlight](https://github.com/zhsunlight) for the suggestion about parameterized call GPU reasoning and the careful and thoughtful testing.\n- Many thanks to [lzh111222334](https://github.com/lzh111222334) for fixing some bugs of rec preprocessing under python version.\n- Many thanks to [AutumnSun1996](https://github.com/AutumnSun1996) for the suggestion in the [#42](https://github.com/RapidAI/RapidOCR/issues/42).\n- Many thanks to [DeadWood8](https://github.com/DeadWood8) for providing the [document](https://rapidai.github.io/RapidOCRDocs/install_usage/rapidocr_web/nuitka_package) which packages rapidocr_web to exe by Nuitka.\n- Many thanks to [Loovelj](https://github.com/Loovelj) for fixing the bug of sorting the text boxes.
