Also CONNECT method to ports 80 and 23 (SMTP).\n* Proxies may be filtered by type, anonymity level, response time, country and status in DNSBL.\n* Work as a proxy server that distributes incoming requests to external proxies. With automatic proxy rotation.\n* All proxies are checked to support Cookies and Referer (and POST requests if required).\n* Automatically removes duplicate proxies.\n* Is asynchronous.\n\n.. * Save found proxies to a file in custom format.\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n* Python **3.5** or higher\n* `aiohttp <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/aiohttp>`_\n* `aiodns <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/aiodns>`_\n* `maxminddb <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/maxminddb>`_\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo install last stable release from pypi:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ pip install proxybroker\n\nThe latest development version can be installed directly from GitHub:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ pip install -U git+https://github.com/constverum/ProxyBroker.git\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n\nCLI Examples\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\nFind\n\"\"\"\"\n\nFind and show 10 HTTP(S) proxies from United States with the high level of anonymity:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ proxybroker find --types HTTP HTTPS --lvl High --countries US --strict -l 10\n\n.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/constverum/ProxyBroker/master/docs/source/_static/cli_find_example.gif\n\n\nGrab\n\"\"\"\"\n\nFind and save to a file 10 US proxies (without a check):\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ proxybroker grab --countries US --limit 10 --outfile ./proxies.txt\n\n.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/constverum/ProxyBroker/master/docs/source/_static/cli_grab_example.gif\n\n\nServe\n\"\"\"\"\"\n\nRun a local proxy server that distributes incoming requests to a pool\nof found HTTP(S) proxies with the high level of anonymity:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ proxybroker serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8888 --types HTTP HTTPS --lvl High\n\n\n.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/constverum/ProxyBroker/master/docs/source/_static/cli_serve_example.gif\n\n| Run ``proxybroker --help`` for more information on the options available.\n| Run ``proxybroker <command> --help`` for more information on a command.\n\n\nBasic code example\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFind and show 10 working HTTP(S) proxies:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import asyncio\n    from proxybroker import Broker\n\n    async def show(proxies):\n        while True:\n            proxy = await proxies.get()\n            if proxy is None: break\n            print('Found proxy: %s' % proxy)\n\n    proxies = asyncio.Queue()\n    broker = Broker(proxies)\n    tasks = asyncio.gather(\n        broker.find(types=['HTTP', 'HTTPS'], limit=10),\n        show(proxies))\n\n    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\n    loop.run_until_complete(tasks)\n\n`More examples <https://proxybroker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html>`_.\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nhttps://proxybroker.readthedocs.io/\n\n\nTODO\n----\n\n* Check the ping, response time and speed of data transfer\n* Check site access (Google, Twitter, etc) and even your own custom URL's\n* Information about uptime\n* Checksum of data returned\n* Support for proxy authentication\n* Finding outgoing IP for cascading proxy\n* The ability to specify the address of the proxy without port (try to connect on defaulted ports)\n\n\nContributing\n------------\n\n* Fork it: https://github.com/constverum/ProxyBroker/fork\n* Create your feature branch: ``git checkout -b my-new-feature``\n* Commit your changes: ``git commit -am 'Add some feature'``\n* Push to the branch: ``git push origin my-new-feature``\n* Submit a pull request!\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0\n\n*This product includes GeoLite2 data created by MaxMind, available from* `http://www.maxmind.com <http://www.maxmind.com>`_.\n"
