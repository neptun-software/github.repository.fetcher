Everyone is welcome to contribute!\n\n\n## Interacting with the FedML Community\n\n- [GitHub issues tracker](https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedML/issues): addressing and discussing functional issues and problems of the FedML library. \n- [Slack channel #general](https://fedml.slack.com/archives/C0172MH1PRV): open-ended questions and issues related to the FedML open-source library.\n- [Slack channel #fedml-system](https://fedml.slack.com/archives/C01D33QU6PN): open-ended questions and issues related to system errors and issues.\n- [Slack channel #fedml-model-and-dataset](https://fedml.slack.com/archives/C018797FC7J): open-ended questions and issues related to model definitions and (customized) dataset loaders.\n- [Slack channel #fedml-algorithms](https://fedml.slack.com/archives/C017G2YQGFP): open-ended questions and issues related to algorithmic optimizations and implementations.\n- [Discord](https://discord.gg/VcEBxSKh): open-ended questions and issues related to the FedML open-source library, similar to Slack.\n\n\n## Submitting a Bug Report / Feature Request / General Q&A\n\nBefore submitting a github issue or a feature request, ensure the issue has not been already reported under\n[Issues](https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedML/issues), either in the [open](https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedML/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue) or [closed](https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedML/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) issues list \nand it is not currently being addressed by other [pull requests](https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedML/pulls). For questions that required to be asnwered in a timely manner it is recommended to ask the [Slack community](https://fedml.slack.com/archives/C0172MH1PRV).\n\nIf you're unable to find an open issue addressing your problem, then you can [open a new one](https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedML/issues/new). Please make sure to include: \n- **Issue Title**: a consice explanation of the issue \n- **Description**: be as descriptive as possible so that the issue can be reproduced by others. The description needs to contain the following checklist:\n    - [x] your environment's fedml library and environment\n        - **hint:** run `fedml env`\n    - [x] your environment's operating system specs\n    - [x] your environment's hardware specs\n    - [x] the sequence of execution commands creating this issue\n    - [x] source code to reproduce the error wherever necessary\n- **Label**: need to select at least one label from the following list:\n    - `bug`: something is not working at all\n    - `documentation`: improvements or additions to documentation\n    - `good first issue`: if this is the first issue of the user\n    - `help wanted`: if this is an advance feature request and critical help is needed\n    - `hotfix`: a small change to a speficic functionality is needed\n    - `question`: if the issue is an implementation or other open-ended question\n    - `research-projects`: if the issue is related to a research project/question\n    - `TODO features`: if the issue requests the implementation of new feature\n\n\n## Contributing Code - Opening a PR\n\nBefore you open a new pull request or contribute code, please make sure you have gone over the documentation, have successfully installed the FedML library and you are able to run a working example:\n- [FedML Installation Docs](https://doc.fedml.ai/open-source/installation)\n- [FedML Examples](https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedML/tree/master/python/examples)\n\nHowever, to avoid duplicating work, it is highly recommended before a new PR is opened to search through the\n[issue tracker](https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedML/issues) and\n[pull requests list](https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedML/pulls). One easy way to scan over existing issues and PRs, is by searching using one of the following labels \n(`bug, help wanted, hotfix, TODO features`), for instance for an existing `TODO features` [you can look here](https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedML/labels/TODO%20features).\n\nThe procedure to start working on a new PR is:\n1. checkout the [development branch](https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedML/tree/dev/v0.7.0)\n2. make any necessary changes locally and push to a new branch following the convention `<username>/<PR_name>`\n    - `username` is the name of your GitHub account and `PR_name` is a succint name describing your PR\n3.  once you have pushed your PR you need to request a merge with the development branch\n\nOnce the PR is approved, it will be merged into `dev/v0.7.0` and subsequently to the `main` branch in the next [FedML Release](https://github.com/FedML-AI/FedML/releases).\n\n"

It helps developers to launch complex model training, deployment, and federated learning anywhere on decentralized GPUs, multi-clouds, edge servers, and smartphones, easily, economically, and securely.\n\nHighly integrated with TensorOpera open source library, TensorOpera AI provides holistic support of three interconnected AI infrastructure layers: user-friendly MLOps, a well-managed scheduler, and high-performance ML libraries for running any AI jobs across GPU Clouds.\n\nA typical workflow is showing in figure above. When developer wants to run a pre-built job in Studio or Job Store, TensorOpera®Launch swiftly pairs AI jobs with the most economical GPU resources, auto-provisions, and effortlessly runs the job, eliminating complex environment setup and management. When running the job, TensorOpera®Launch orchestrates the compute plane in different cluster topologies and configuration so that any complex AI jobs are enabled, regardless model training, deployment, or even federated learning. TensorOpera®Open Source is unified and scalable machine learning library for running these AI jobs anywhere at any scale. \n\nIn the MLOps layer of TensorOpera AI\n- **TensorOpera® Studio** embraces the power of Generative AI! Access popular open-source foundational models (e.g., LLMs), fine-tune them seamlessly with your specific data, and deploy them scalably and cost-effectively using the TensorOpera Launch on GPU marketplace.\n- **TensorOpera® Job Store** maintains a list of pre-built jobs for training, deployment, and federated learning. Developers are encouraged to run directly with customize datasets or models on cheaper GPUs.\n\nIn the scheduler layer of TensorOpera AI\n- **TensorOpera® Launch** swiftly pairs AI jobs with the most economical GPU resources, auto-provisions, and effortlessly runs the job, eliminating complex environment setup and management. It supports a range of compute-intensive jobs for generative AI and LLMs, such as large-scale training, serverless deployments, and vector DB searches. TensorOpera Launch also facilitates on-prem cluster management and deployment on private or hybrid clouds.\n\nIn the Compute layer of TensorOpera AI\n- **TensorOpera® Deploy** is a model serving platform for high scalability and low latency.\n- **TensorOpera® Train** focuses on distributed training of large and foundational models.\n- **TensorOpera® Federate** is a federated learning platform backed by the most popular federated learning open-source library and the world’s first FLOps (federated learning Ops), offering on-device training on smartphones and cross-cloud GPU servers.\n- **TensorOpera® Open Source** is unified and scalable machine learning library for running these AI jobs anywhere at any scale.\n\n# Contributing \nFedML embraces and thrive through open-source.
