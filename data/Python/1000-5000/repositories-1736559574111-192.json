TensorFlow (as we write this document) is one of / the best deep learning frameworks available. The question that should be asked is why has this repository been created when there are so many other tutorials about TensorFlow available on the web?\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nWhy use TensorFlow?\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nDeep Learning is in very high interest these days - there's a crucial need for rapid and optimized implementations of the algorithms and architectures. TensorFlow is designed to facilitate this goal.\n\nThe strong advantage of TensorFlow is it flexibility in designing highly modular models which can also be a disadvantage for beginners since a lot of the pieces must be considered together when creating the model.\n\nThis issue has been facilitated as well by developing high-level APIs such as `Keras <https://keras.io/>`_ and `Slim <https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/inception/inception/slim/README.md//>`_ which abstract a lot of the pieces used in designing machine learning algorithms.\n\nThe interesting thing about TensorFlow is that **it can be found anywhere these days**. Lots of the researchers and developers are using it and *its community is growing at the speed of light*! So many issues can be dealt with easily since they're usually the same issues that a lot of other people run into considering the large number of people involved in the TensorFlow community.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nWhat's the point of this repository?\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n**Developing open source projects for the sake of just developing something is not the reason behind this effort**.\nConsidering the large number of tutorials that are being added to this large community, this repository has been created to break the jump-in and jump-out process that usually happens to most of the open source projects, **but why and how**?\n\nFirst of all, what's the point of putting effort into something that most of the people won't stop by and take a look? What's the point of creating something that does not help anyone in the developers and researchers community? Why spend time for something that can easily be forgotten? But **how we try to do it?** Even up to this\nvery moment there are countless tutorials on TensorFlow whether on the model design or TensorFlow\nworkflow.\n\nMost of them are too complicated or suffer from a lack of documentation. There are only a few available tutorials which are concise and well-structured and provide enough insight for their specific implemented models.\n\nThe goal of this project is to help the community with structured tutorials and simple and optimized code implementations to provide better insight about how to use TensorFlow *quick and effectively*.\n\nIt is worth noting that, **the main goal of this project is to provide well-documented tutorials and less-complicated code**!\n\n=================================================\nTensorFlow Installation and Setup the Environment\n=================================================\n\n.. image:: _img/mainpage/installation-logo.gif\n   :height: 100px\n   :width: 200 px\n   :scale: 50 %\n   :alt: alternate text\n   :align: right\n   :target: https://github.com/astorfi/TensorFlow-World/tree/master/docs/tutorials/installation\n\n.. _TensorFlow Installation: https://github.com/astorfi/TensorFlow-World/tree/master/docs/tutorials/installation\n\nIn order to install TensorFlow please refer to the following link:\n\n  * `TensorFlow Installation`_\n\n\n.. image:: _img/mainpage/installation.gif\n    :target: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3JFEPk4qQY&t=2s\n\nThe virtual environment installation is recommended in order to prevent package conflict and having the capacity to customize the working environment.\n\n====================\nTensorFlow Tutorials\n====================\n\nThe tutorials in this repository are partitioned into relevant categories.\n\n==========================\n\n~~~~~~~~\nWarm-up\n~~~~~~~~\n\n.. image:: _img/mainpage/welcome.gif\n   :height: 100px\n   :width: 200 px\n   :scale: 50 %\n   :alt: alternate text\n   :align: right\n\n+----+---------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------+\n| #

Instead, declare them in issues or email the repository owner*.\n\nPlease note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nPull Request Process\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nPlease consider the following criterions in order to help us in a better way:\n\n  * The pull request is mainly expected to be a code script suggestion or improvement.\n  * A pull request related to non-code-script sections is expected to make a significant difference in the documentation. Otherwise, it is expected to be announced in the issues section.\n  * Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build and creating a pull request.\n  * Add comments with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.\n  * You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of at least one other developer, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the owner to merge it for you if you believe all checks are passed.\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~\nFinal Note\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWe are looking forward to your kind feedback. Please help us to improve this open source project and make our work better.\nFor contribution, please create a pull request and we will investigate it promptly. Once again, we appreciate\nyour kind feedback and elaborate code inspections.\n\n================\nAcknowledgement\n================\n\nI have taken huge efforts in this project for hopefully being a small part of TensorFlow world. However, it would not have been plausible without the kind support and help of my friend and colleague `Domenick Poster <https://github.com/vonclites/>`_ for his valuable advices. He helped me for having a better understanding of TensorFlow and my special appreciation goes to him.\n"
