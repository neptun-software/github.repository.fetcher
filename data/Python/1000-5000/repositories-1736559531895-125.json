          "content": "# Contributing to Azure Python SDK\n\nIf you would like to become an active contributor to this project please\nfollow the instructions provided in [Microsoft Azure Projects Contribution Guidelines](https://opensource.microsoft.com/collaborate/).\n\n## Generated code\n\nIf you want to contribute to a file that is generated (header contains `Code generated by Microsoft (R) AutoRest Code Generator.`), the best approach to open a PR on the initial Swagger specification, as we can NOT merge a PR on generated code (it would be replaced by next generation). See https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/ for details.\n\n## Tools Overview\n\nWe utilize a variety of tools to ensure smooth development, testing, and code quality for the Azure Python SDK. Below is a list of key tools and their purpose in the workflow:\n\n- Tox: [Tox](https://tox.wiki/en/latest/) is our primary tool for managing test environments. It allows us to distribute tests to virtual environments, install dependencies, and maintain consistency between local and CI builds. Tox is configured to handle various testing scenarios, including linting, type checks, and running unit tests.\n\n- Virtualenv: [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) is leveraged by Tox to create isolated environments for each test suite, ensuring consistent dependencies and reducing conflicts.\n\n- Pytest: [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) is the test framework we use for writing and running our unit tests. It supports fixtures, parameterized tests, and other features that make testing more powerful and flexible.\n\n- Pylint: [Pylint](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is used for code linting to enforce coding standards and catch potential issues early. Maintaining a consistent code style is important, and Pylint helps achieve that goal.\n\n- Mypy and Pyright: Both tools are used for type checking. [Mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) helps verify that type annotations are correct, while [Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) provides additional support for type completeness and validation.\n\n- Sphinx: [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) is used for generating package documentation. This ensures that contributors and users alike have clear, accessible information about how to use the SDK.\n\n- Bandit: [Bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is employed to find common security issues in Python code. It performs static analysis and helps us secure the codebase.\n\n- Azure DevOps: Our CI/CD pipelines are managed using [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/devops/), ensuring that builds, tests, and deployments are executed consistently and reliably across all contributions.\n\n## Building and Testing\n\nThe Azure SDK team's Python CI leverages the tool `tox` to distribute tests to virtual environments, handle test dependency installation, and coordinate tooling reporting during PR/CI builds. This means that a dev working locally can reproduce _exactly_ what the build machine is doing.\n\n[A Brief Overview of Tox](https://tox.wiki/en/latest/)\n\n#### A Monorepo and Tox in Harmony\n\nTraditionally, the `tox.ini` file for a package sits _alongside the setup.py_ in source code. The `azure-sdk-for-python` necessarily does not adhere to this policy. There are over one-hundred packages contained here-in. That's a lot of `tox.ini` files to maintain!\n\nInstead, the CI system leverages the `--root` argument which is new to `tox4`. The `--root` argument allows `tox` to act as if the `tox.ini` is located in whatever directory you specify!\n\n#### Tox Environments\n\nA given `tox.ini` works on the concept of `test environments`. A given test environment is a combination of:\n\n1. An identifier (or identifiers)\n2. A targeted Python version\n    1. `tox` will default to base python executing the `tox` command if no Python environment is specified\n3. (optionally) an OS platform\n\nInternally `tox` leverages `virtualenv` to create each test environment's virtual environment.\n\nThis means that once the `tox` workflow is in place, all tests will be executed _within a virtual environment._\n\nYou can use the command `tox list` to list all the environments provided by a `tox.ini` file. You can either use that command in the\nsame directory as the file itself, or use the `--conf` argument to specify the path to it directly.\n\n\nSample output of `tox list`:\n\n```\nsdk-for-python/eng/tox> tox list\ndefault environments:\nwhl              -> Builds a wheel and runs tests\nsdist            -> Builds a source distribution and runs tests\n\nadditional environments:\npylint           -> Lints a package with a pinned version of pylint\nnext-pylint      -> Lints a package with pylint (version 2.15.8)\nmypy             -> Typechecks a package with mypy (version 1.9.0)\nnext-mypy        -> Typechecks a package with the latest version of mypy\npyright          -> Typechecks a package with pyright (version 1.1.287)\nnext-pyright     -> Typechecks a package with the latest version of static type-checker pyright\nverifytypes      -> Verifies the \"type completeness\" of a package with pyright\nwhl_no_aio       -> Builds a wheel without aio and runs tests\ndevelop          -> Tests a package\nsphinx           -> Builds a package's documentation with sphinx\ndepends          -> Ensures all modules in a target package can be successfully imported\nverifywhl        -> Verify directories included in whl and contents in manifest file\nverifysdist      -> Verify directories included in sdist and contents in manifest file. Also ensures that py.typed configuration is correct within the setup.py\ndevtest          -> Tests a package against dependencies installed from a dev index\nlatestdependency -> Tests a package against the released, upper-bound versions of its azure dependencies\nmindependency    -> Tests a package against the released, lower-bound versions of its azure dependencies\napistub          -> Generate an api stub of a package ( for https://apiview.dev )\nbandit           -> Runs bandit, a tool to find common security issues, against a package\nsamples          -> Runs a package's samples\nbreaking         -> Runs the breaking changes checker against a package\n```\n\n### Example Usage of the common Azure SDK For Python `tox.ini`\n\nBasic usage of `tox` within this monorepo is:\n\n1. `pip install \"tox<5\"`\n2. Run `tox run -e ENV_NAME -c path/to/tox.ini --root path/to/python_package`\n  * **Note**: You can use environment variables to provide defaults for tox config values\n    * With `TOX_CONFIG_FILE` set to the absolute path of `tox.ini`, you can avoid needing `-c path/to/tox.ini` in your tox invocations\n    * With `TOX_ROOT_DIR` set to the absolute path to your python package, you can avoid needing `--root path/to/python_package`\n\nThe common `tox.ini` location is `eng/tox/tox.ini` within the repository.\n\nIf at any time you want to blow away the tox created virtual environments and start over, simply append `-r` to any tox invocation!\n\n#### Example `azure-core` mypy\n\n1. Run `tox run -e mypy -c ./eng/tox/tox.ini --root sdk/core/azure-core`\n\n#### Example `azure-storage-blob` tests\n\n2. Execute `tox run -c ./eng/tox/tox.ini --root sdk/storage/azure-storage-blob`\n\nNote that we didn't provide an `environment` argument for this example. Reason here is that the _default_ environment selected by our common `tox.ini` file is one that runs `pytest`.\n\n#### `whl` environment\nUsed for test execution across the spectrum of all the platforms we want to support. Maintained at a `platform specific` level just in case we run into platform-specific bugs.\n\n* Installs the wheel, runs tests using the wheel\n\n```\n\\> tox run -e whl -c <path to tox.ini> --root <path to python package>\n\n```\n\n#### `sdist` environment\nUsed for the local dev loop.\n\n* Installs package in editable mode\n* Runs tests using the editable mode installation, not the wheel\n\n```\n\n\\> tox run -e sdist -c <path to tox.ini> --root <path to python package>\n\n```\n\n#### `pylint` environment\nPylint install and run.\n\n```\n\\> tox run -e pylint -c <path to tox.ini> --root <path to python package>\n```\n\n\n#### `mypy` environment\nMypy install and run.\n\n```\n\\> tox run -e mypy -c <path to tox.ini> --root <path to python package>\n```\n\n#### `sphinx` environment\nGenerate sphinx doc for this package.\n\n```\n\\> tox run -e sphinx -c <path to tox.ini> --root <path to python package>\n```\n\n### Custom Pytest Arguments\n\n`tox` supports custom arguments, and the defined pytest environments within the common `tox.ini` also allow these. Essentially, separate the arguments you want passed to `pytest` by a `--` in your tox invocation.\n\n[Tox Documentation on Positional Arguments](https://tox.wiki/en/latest/config.html#substitutions-for-positional-arguments-in-commands)\n\n**Example: Invoke tox, breaking into the debugger on failure**\n`tox run -e whl -c <path to tox.ini> --root <path to python package> -- --pdb`\n\n### Performance Testing\n\nSDK performance testing is supported via the custom `perfstress` framework. For full details on this framework, and how to write and run tests for an SDK - see the [perfstress tests documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/dev/perfstress_tests.md).\n\n### More Reading\n\nWe maintain an [additional document](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/eng_sys_checks.md) that has a ton of detail as to what is actually _happening_ in these executions.\n\n### Dev Feed\nDaily dev build version of Azure sdk packages for python are available and are uploaded to Azure devops feed daily. We have also created a tox environment to test a package against dev built version of dependent packages. Below is the link to Azure devops feed.\n[`https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/public/_packaging?_a=feed&feed=azure-sdk-for-python`](https://dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/public/_packaging?_a=feed&feed=azure-sdk-for-python)\n\n##### To install latest dev build version of a package\n```\npip install <package-name> --extra-index-url https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/public/_packaging/azure-sdk-for-python/pypi/simple --pre\n```\n\n#### To Install a specific dev build version of a package\nFor e.g.\n```\npip install azure-appconfiguration==1.0.0b6.dev20191205001 --extra-index-url https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/azure-sdk/public/_packaging/azure-sdk-for-python/pypi/simple\n```\n\nTo test a package being developed against latest dev build version of dependent packages:\na. cd to package root folder\nb. run tox environment devtest\n\n```\n\\> tox run -e devtest -c <path to tox.ini> --root <path to python package>\n```\n\nThis tox test( devtest) will fail if installed dependent packages are not dev build version.\n\n## Samples\n\n### Third-party dependencies\n\nThird party libraries should only be included in samples when necessary to demonstrate usage of an Azure SDK package; they should not be suggested or endorsed as alternatives to the Azure SDK.\n\nWhen code samples take dependencies, readers should be able to use the material without significant license burden or research on terms. This goal requires restricting dependencies to certain types of open source or commercial licenses.\n\nSamples may take the following categories of dependencies:\n\n- **Open-source** : Open source offerings that use an [Open Source Initiative (OSI) approved license](https://opensource.org/licenses). Any component whose license isn't OSI-approved is considered a commercial offering. Prefer OSS projects that are members of any of the [OSS foundations that Microsoft is part of](https://opensource.microsoft.com/ecosystem/). Prefer permissive licenses for libraries, like [MIT](https://opensource.org/license/MIT) and [Apache 2](https://opensource.org/license/apache-2-0). Copy-left licenses like [GPLv3](https://opensource.org/license/gpl-3-0) are acceptable for tools, and OSs. [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes), [Linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux), and [Newtonsoft.Json](https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json) are examples of this license type. Links to open source components should be to where the source is hosted, including any applicable license, such as a GitHub repository (or similar).\n\n- **Commercial**: Commercial offerings that enable readers to learn from our content without unnecessary extra costs. Typically, the offering has some form of a community edition, or a free trial sufficient for its use in content. A commercial license may be a form of dual-license, or tiered license. Links to commercial components should be to the commercial site for the software, even if the source software is hosted publicly on GitHub (or similar).\n\n- **Dual licensed**: Commercial offerings that enable readers to choose either license based on their needs. For example, if the offering has an OSS and commercial license, readers can  choose between them. [MySql](https://github.com/mysql/mysql-server) is an example of this license type.\n\n- **Tiered licensed**: Offerings that enable readers to use the license tier that corresponds to their characteristics. For example, tiers may be available for students, hobbyists, or companies with defined revenue  thresholds. For offerings with tiered licenses, strive to limit our use in tutorials to the features available in the lowest tier. This policy enables the widest audience for the article. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [IdentityServer](https://duendesoftware.com/products/identityserver), [ImageSharp](https://sixlabors.com/products/imagesharp/), and [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.com) are examples of this license type.\n\nIn general, we prefer taking dependencies on licensed components in the order of the listed categories. In cases where the category may not be well known, we'll document the category so that readers understand the choice that they're making by using that dependency.\n\n## Code of Conduct\nThis project's code of conduct can be found in the\n[CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n(v1.4.0 of the https://contributor-covenant.org/ CoC).\n"

For consumers of the SDK we recommend visiting our [public developer docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/azure/) or our versioned [developer docs](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk-for-python).\n\n## _Disclaimer_\n\n_Azure SDK Python packages support for Python 2.7 has ended 01 January 2022. For more information and questions, please refer to https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues/20691_\n\n## Getting started\n\nFor your convenience, each service has a separate set of libraries that you can choose to use instead of one, large Azure package. To get started with a specific library, see the `README.md` (or `README.rst`) file located in the library's project folder.\n\nYou can find service libraries in the `/sdk` directory.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nThe client libraries are supported on Python 3.8 or later. For more details, please read our page on [Azure SDK for Python version support policy](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/wiki/Azure-SDKs-Python-version-support-policy).\n\n## Packages available\n\nEach service might have a number of libraries available from each of the following categories:\n* [Client - New Releases](#client-new-releases)\n* [Client - Previous Versions](#client-previous-versions)\n* [Management - New Releases](#management-new-releases)\n* [Management - Previous Versions](#management-previous-versions)\n\n### Client: New Releases\n\nNew wave of packages that we are announcing as **GA** and several that are currently releasing in **preview**. These libraries allow you to use and consume existing resources and interact with them, for example: upload a blob. These libraries share  several core functionalities such as: retries, logging, transport protocols, authentication protocols, etc. that can be found in the [azure-core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core) library. You can learn more about these libraries by reading guidelines that they follow [here](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/python/guidelines/index.html).\n\nYou can find the [most up to date list of all of the new packages on our page](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/latest/index.html#python)\n\n> NOTE: If you need to ensure your code is ready for production use one of the stable, non-preview libraries.\n\n### Client: Previous Versions\n\nLast stable versions of packages that have been provided for usage with Azure and are production-ready. These libraries provide you with similar functionalities to the Preview ones as they allow you to use and consume existing resources and interact with them, for example: upload a blob. They might not implement the [guidelines](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/python/guidelines/index.html) or have the same feature set as the November releases. They do however offer wider coverage of services.\n\n### Management: New Releases\nA new set of management libraries that follow the [Azure SDK Design Guidelines for Python](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/python/guidelines/) are now available. These new libraries provide a number of core capabilities that are shared amongst all Azure SDKs, including the intuitive Azure Identity library, an HTTP Pipeline with custom policies, error-handling, distributed tracing, and much more.\nDocumentation and code samples for these new libraries can be found [here](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/mgmt). In addition, a migration guide that shows how to transition from older versions of libraries is located [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/sphinx/mgmt_quickstart.rst#migration-guide).\n\nYou can find the [most up to date list of all of the new packages on our page](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/latest/mgmt/python.html)\n\n> NOTE: If you need to ensure your code is ready for production use one of the stable, non-preview libraries. Also, if you are experiencing authentication issues with the management libraries after upgrading certain packages, it's possible that you upgraded to the new versions of SDK without changing the authentication code, please refer to the migration guide mentioned above for proper instructions.\n\n### Management: Previous Versions\nFor a complete list of management libraries that enable you to provision and manage Azure resources, please [check here](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/latest/all/python.html). They might not have the same feature set as the new releases but they do offer wider coverage of services.\nManagement libraries can be identified by namespaces that start with `azure-mgmt-`, e.g. `azure-mgmt-compute`\n\n## Need help?\n\n* For detailed documentation visit our [Azure SDK for Python documentation](https://aka.ms/python-docs)\n* File an issue via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues)\n* Check [previous questions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/azure+python) or ask new ones on StackOverflow using `azure` and `python` tags.\n\n### Reporting security issues and security bugs\n\nSecurity issues and bugs should be reported privately, via email, to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) <secure@microsoft.com>. You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.
