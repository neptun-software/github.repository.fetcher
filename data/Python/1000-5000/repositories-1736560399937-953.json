Training configs and pretrained models are released. See details in [d2](./d2).\n\n### MMDetection\n\nThe ResNeSt backbone has been adopted by [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/tree/master/configs/resnest).\n\n### Semantic Segmentation\n\n- PyTorch models and training: Please visit [PyTorch Encoding Toolkit](https://hangzhang.org/PyTorch-Encoding/model_zoo/segmentation.html).\n- Gluon models and training: Please visit [GluonCV Toolkit](https://gluon-cv.mxnet.io/model_zoo/segmentation.html#ade20k-dataset).\n\n\n## Verify ImageNet Results:\n\n**Note:** the inference speed reported in the paper are tested using Gluon implementation with RecordIO data.\n\n### Prepare ImageNet dataset:\n\nHere we use raw image data format for simplicity, please follow [GluonCV tutorial](https://gluon-cv.mxnet.io/build/examples_datasets/recordio.html) if you would like to use RecordIO format.\n\n```bash\ncd scripts/dataset/\n# assuming you have downloaded the dataset in the current folder\npython prepare_imagenet.py --download-dir ./\n```\n\n### Torch Model\n\n```bash\n# use resnest50 as an example\ncd scripts/torch/\npython verify.py --model resnest50 --crop-size 224\n```\n\n### Gluon Model\n\n```bash\n# use resnest50 as an example\ncd scripts/gluon/\npython verify.py --model resnest50 --crop-size 224\n```\n\n## How to Train\n\n### ImageNet Models\n\n- Training with MXNet Gluon: Please visit [Gluon folder](./scripts/gluon/).\n- Training with PyTorch: Please visit [PyTorch Encoding Toolkit](https://hangzhang.org/PyTorch-Encoding/model_zoo/imagenet.html) (slightly worse than Gluon implementation).\n\n### Detectron Models\n\nFor object detection and instance segmentation models, please visit our [detectron2-ResNeSt fork](https://github.com/zhanghang1989/detectron2-ResNeSt).\n\n### Semantic Segmentation\n\n- Training with PyTorch: [Encoding Toolkit](https://hangzhang.org/PyTorch-Encoding/model_zoo/segmentation.html).\n- Training with MXNet: [GluonCV Toolkit](https://gluon-cv.mxnet.io/model_zoo/segmentation.html#ade20k-dataset).\n\n## Reference\n\n**ResNeSt: Split-Attention Networks** [[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.08955.pdf)]\n\nHang Zhang, Chongruo Wu, Zhongyue Zhang, Yi Zhu, Zhi Zhang, Haibin Lin, Yue Sun, Tong He, Jonas Muller, R.
