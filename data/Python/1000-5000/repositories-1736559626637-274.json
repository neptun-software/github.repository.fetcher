You can add your slides by simply [opening an issue](https://github.com/vinayak-mehta/present/issues/new?assignees=&labels=made-with-present&template=submit-slides-to-gallery.md&title=Add+slides+to+gallery).\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can simply use pip to install `present`:\n\n```bash\n$ pip install present\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```bash\n$ present sample.md\n```\n\nSome controls:\n\n- Quit: `q`\n- Previous slide: `b`, Left arrow, Page Up\n- Next slide: `n`, Space bar, Right arrow, Page Down\n\nAt the end, you can press `r` to restart the presentation.\n\n## Syntax\n\nSlides follow [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) syntax. You can check out the [sample slides](https://github.com/vinayak-mehta/present/blob/master/examples/sample.md) for reference.\n\n**Note:** Some things aren't supported yet:\n- Effects and colors on the same slide.\n- Effects and code on the same slide.\n\n### Separator\n\nEach slide can be separated with a `---`.\n\n```\nSlide 1\n\n---\n\nSlide 2\n```\n\n### Headers\n\nLevel 1 headings become figlets, level 2 headings get underlined with `-`, and level 3 headings become bold.\n\n```\n# Heading 1\n\n## Heading 2\n\n### Heading 3\n```\n\n### Text\n\n```\nThis is normal text\n\nThis is **bold text**\n\nThis is `inline code`\n\nThis is a [link](www.google.com)\n\nAs Kanye West said:\n\n> We're living the future so\n> the present is our past.\n```\n\n### Lists\n\nOrdered lists become unordered lists automatically.\n\n```\n- Item 1\n    - Item 1a\n    - Item 1b\n    - Item 1c\n- Item 2\n    - Item 2a\n```\n\n### Images\n\nImage paths are relative to the directory where your slides are kept, and where you invoke `present`.\n\n```\n![RC](images/recurse.png)\n```\n\nNote: You can use high resolution images and tweak the terminal font size to get the best results.\n\n### Code blocks\n\n<pre>\n```\nimport os\n\nos.getcwd()\n```\n</pre>\n\n### Codios\n\nCodios are pre-recorded playable code blocks which can be useful for live demos. You can find out how to write one in the [codio](https://present.readthedocs.io/en/latest/codio.html) section of the documentation.\n\n```\n![codio](codio.yml)\n```\n\n### Style\n\nEach slide can be styled with foreground / background colors and effects. By default, slides are black on white with no effects. You can add style to a slide by adding a comment at the beginning of the slide (after the slide separator):\n\n```\nSlide 1\n\n---\n<!-- fg=black bg=yellow -->\n\nSlide 2\n\n---\n<!-- effect=explosions -->\n\nSlide 3\n```\n\nColors: `black`, `red`, `green`, `yellow`, `blue`, `magenta`, `cyan`, `white`.\n\nEffects: `fireworks`, `explosions`, `stars`, `matrix`, `plasma`.
