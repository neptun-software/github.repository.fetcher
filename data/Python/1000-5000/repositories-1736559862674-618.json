We appreciate the quality of your work, and enjoy working with you!\nThank you for your numerous contributions to the project so far.\n\nBy accepting the invitation to become a core team member you are **not required to commit to doing any more work** -\nxarray is a volunteer project, and we value the contributions you have made already.\n\nYou can see a list of all the current core team members on our\n[@pydata/xarray](https://github.com/orgs/pydata/teams/xarray)\nGitHub team. Once accepted, you should now be on that list too.\nThis document offers guidelines for your new role.\n\n## Tasks\n\nXarray values a wide range of contributions, only some of which involve writing code.\nAs such, we do not currently make a distinction between a \"core team member\", \"core developer\", \"maintainer\",\nor \"triage team member\" as some projects do (e.g. [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/development/maintaining.html)).\nThat said, if you prefer to refer to your role as one of the other titles above then that is fine by us!\n\nXarray is mostly a volunteer project, so these tasks shouldn’t be read as “expectations”.\n**There are no strict expectations**, other than to adhere to our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/pydata/xarray/tree/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\nRather, the tasks that follow are general descriptions of what it might mean to be a core team member:\n\n- Facilitate a welcoming environment for those who file issues, make pull requests, and open discussion topics,\n- Triage newly filed issues,\n- Review newly opened pull requests,\n- Respond to updates on existing issues and pull requests,\n- Drive discussion and decisions on stalled issues and pull requests,\n- Provide experience / wisdom on API design questions to ensure consistency and maintainability,\n- Project organization (run developer meetings, coordinate with sponsors),\n- Project evangelism (advertise xarray to new users),\n- Community contact (represent xarray in user communities such as [Pangeo](https://pangeo.io/)),\n- Key project contact (represent xarray's perspective within key related projects like NumPy, Zarr or Dask),\n- Project fundraising (help write and administrate grants that will support xarray),\n- Improve documentation or tutorials (especially on [`tutorial.xarray.dev`](https://tutorial.xarray.dev/)),\n- Presenting or running tutorials (such as those we have given at the SciPy conference),\n- Help maintain the [`xarray.dev`](https://xarray.dev/) landing page and website, the [code for which is here](https://github.com/xarray-contrib/xarray.dev),\n- Write blog posts on the [xarray blog](https://xarray.dev/blog),\n- Help maintain xarray's various Continuous Integration Workflows,\n- Help maintain a regular release schedule (we aim for one or more releases per month),\n- Attend the bi-weekly community meeting ([issue](https://github.com/pydata/xarray/issues/4001)),\n- Contribute to the xarray codebase.\n\n(Matt Rocklin's post on [the role of a maintainer](https://matthewrocklin.com/blog/2019/05/18/maintainer) may be\ninteresting background reading, but should not be taken to strictly apply to the Xarray project.)\n\nObviously you are not expected to contribute in all (or even more than one) of these ways!\nThey are listed so as to indicate the many types of work that go into maintaining xarray.\n\nIt is natural that your available time and enthusiasm for the project will wax and wane - this is fine and expected!\nIt is also common for core team members to have a \"niche\" - a particular part of the codebase they have specific expertise\nwith, or certain types of task above which they primarily perform.\n\nIf however you feel that is unlikely you will be able to be actively contribute in the foreseeable future\n(or especially if you won't be available to answer questions about pieces of code that you wrote previously)\nthen you may want to consider letting us know you would rather be listed as an \"Emeritus Core Team Member\",\nas this would help us in evaluating the overall health of the project.\n\n## Issue triage\n\nOne of the main ways you might spend your contribution time is by responding to or triaging new issues.\nHere’s a typical workflow for triaging a newly opened issue or discussion:\n\n1. **Thank the reporter for opening an issue.**\n\n   The issue tracker is many people’s first interaction with the xarray project itself, beyond just using the library.\n   It may also be their first open-source contribution of any kind. As such, we want it to be a welcoming, pleasant experience.\n\n2. **Is the necessary information provided?**\n\n   Ideally reporters would fill out the issue template, but many don’t. If crucial information (like the version of xarray they used),\n   is missing feel free to ask for that and label the issue with “needs info”.\n   The report should follow the [guidelines for xarray discussions](https://github.com/pydata/xarray/discussions/5404).\n   You may want to link to that if they didn’t follow the template.\n\n   Make sure that the title accurately reflects the issue. Edit it yourself if it’s not clear.\n   Remember also that issues can be converted to discussions and vice versa if appropriate.\n\n3. **Is this a duplicate issue?**\n\n   We have many open issues. If a new issue is clearly a duplicate, label the new issue as “duplicate”, and close the issue with a link to the original issue.\n   Make sure to still thank the reporter, and encourage them to chime in on the original issue, and perhaps try to fix it.\n\n   If the new issue provides relevant information, such as a better or slightly different example, add it to the original issue as a comment or an edit to the original post.\n\n4. **Is the issue minimal and reproducible?**\n\n   For bug reports, we ask that the reporter provide a minimal reproducible example.\n   See [minimal-bug-reports](https://matthewrocklin.com/blog/work/2018/02/28/minimal-bug-reports) for a good explanation.\n   If the example is not reproducible, or if it’s clearly not minimal, feel free to ask the reporter if they can provide and example or simplify the provided one.\n   Do acknowledge that writing minimal reproducible examples is hard work. If the reporter is struggling, you can try to write one yourself and we’ll edit the original post to include it.\n\n   If a nice reproducible example has been provided, thank the reporter for that.\n   If a reproducible example can’t be provided, add the “needs mcve” label.\n\n   If a reproducible example is provided, but you see a simplification, edit the original post with your simpler reproducible example.\n\n5. **Is this a clearly defined feature request?**\n\n   Generally, xarray prefers to discuss and design new features in issues, before a pull request is made.\n   Encourage the submitter to include a proposed API for the new feature. Having them write a full docstring is a good way to pin down specifics.\n\n   We may need a discussion from several xarray maintainers before deciding whether the proposal is in scope for xarray.\n\n6. **Is this a usage question?**\n\n   We prefer that usage questions are asked on StackOverflow with the [`python-xarray` tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python-xarray) or as a [GitHub discussion topic](https://github.com/pydata/xarray/discussions).\n\n   If it’s easy to answer, feel free to link to the relevant documentation section, let them know that in the future this kind of question should be on StackOverflow, and close the issue.\n\n7. **What labels and milestones should I add?**\n\n   Apply the relevant labels. This is a bit of an art, and comes with experience. Look at similar issues to get a feel for how things are labeled.\n   Labels used for labelling issues that relate to particular features or parts of the codebase normally have the form `topic-<SOMETHING>`.\n\n   If the issue is clearly defined and the fix seems relatively straightforward, label the issue as `contrib-good-first-issue`.\n   You can also remove the `needs triage` label that is automatically applied to all newly-opened issues.\n\n8. **Where should the poster look to fix the issue?**\n\n   If you can, it is very helpful to point to the approximate location in the codebase where a contributor might begin to fix the issue.\n   This helps ease the way in for new contributors to the repository.\n\n## Code review and contributions\n\nAs a core team member, you are a representative of the project,\nand trusted to make decisions that will serve the long term interests\nof all users. You also gain the responsibility of shepherding\nother contributors through the review process; here are some\nguidelines for how to do that.\n\n### All contributors are treated the same\n\nYou should now have gained the ability to merge or approve\nother contributors' pull requests. Merging contributions is a shared power:\nonly merge contributions you yourself have carefully reviewed, and that are\nclear improvements for the project. When in doubt, and especially for more\ncomplex changes, wait until at least one other core team member has approved.\n(See [Reviewing](#reviewing) and especially\n[Merge Only Changes You Understand](#merge-only-changes-you-understand) below.)\n\nIt should also be considered best practice to leave a reasonable (24hr) time window\nafter approval before merge to ensure that other core team members have a reasonable\nchance to weigh in.\nAdding the `plan-to-merge` label notifies developers of the imminent merge.\n\nWe are also an international community, with contributors from many different time zones,\nsome of whom will only contribute during their working hours, others who might only be able\nto contribute during nights and weekends. It is important to be respectful of other peoples\nschedules and working habits, even if it slows the project down slightly - we are in this\nfor the long run. In the same vein you also shouldn't feel pressured to be constantly\navailable or online, and users or contributors who are overly demanding and unreasonable\nto the point of harassment will be directed to our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/pydata/xarray/tree/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\nWe value sustainable development practices over mad rushes.\n\nWhen merging, we automatically use GitHub's\n[Squash and Merge](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/merging-a-pull-request#merging-a-pull-request)\nto ensure a clean git history.\n\nYou should also continue to make your own pull requests as before and in accordance\nwith the [general contributing guide](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/contributing.html). These pull requests still\nrequire the approval of another core team member before they can be merged.\n\n### How to conduct a good review\n\n_Always_ be kind to contributors. Contributors are often doing\nvolunteer work, for which we are tremendously grateful. Provide\nconstructive criticism on ideas and implementations, and remind\nyourself of how it felt when your own work was being evaluated as a\nnovice.\n\n`xarray` strongly values mentorship in code review. New users\noften need more handholding, having little to no git\nexperience. Repeat yourself liberally, and, if you don’t recognize a\ncontributor, point them to our development guide, or other GitHub\nworkflow tutorials around the web. Do not assume that they know how\nGitHub works (many don't realize that adding a commit\nautomatically updates a pull request, for example). Gentle, polite, kind\nencouragement can make the difference between a new core team member and\nan abandoned pull request.\n\nWhen reviewing, focus on the following:\n\n1. **Usability and generality:** `xarray` is a user-facing package that strives to be accessible\n   to both novice and advanced users, and new features should ultimately be\n   accessible to everyone using the package. `xarray` targets the scientific user\n   community broadly, and core features should be domain-agnostic and general purpose.\n   Custom functionality is meant to be provided through our various types of interoperability.\n\n2. **Performance and benchmarks:** As `xarray` targets scientific applications that often involve\n   large multidimensional datasets, high performance is a key value of `xarray`. While\n   every new feature won't scale equally to all sizes of data, keeping in mind performance\n   and our [benchmarks](https://github.com/pydata/xarray/tree/main/asv_bench) during a review may be important, and you may\n   need to ask for benchmarks to be run and reported or new benchmarks to be added.\n   You can run the CI benchmarking suite on any PR by tagging it with the `run-benchmark` label.\n\n3. **APIs and stability:** Coding users and developers will make\n   extensive use of our APIs. The foundation of a healthy ecosystem will be\n   a fully capable and stable set of APIs, so as `xarray` matures it will\n   very important to ensure our APIs are stable. Spending the extra time to consider names of public facing\n   variables and methods, alongside function signatures, could save us considerable\n   trouble in the future. We do our best to provide [deprecation cycles](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/contributing.html#backwards-compatibility)\n   when making backwards-incompatible changes.\n\n4. **Documentation and tutorials:** All new methods should have appropriate doc\n   strings following [PEP257](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/) and the\n   [NumPy documentation guide](https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/howto-docs.html#documentation-style).\n   For any major new features, accompanying changes should be made to our\n   [tutorials](https://tutorial.xarray.dev). These should not only\n   illustrates the new feature, but explains it.\n\n5. **Implementations and algorithms:** You should understand the code being modified\n   or added before approving it. (See [Merge Only Changes You Understand](#merge-only-changes-you-understand)\n   below.) Implementations should do what they claim and be simple, readable, and efficient\n   in that order.\n\n6. **Tests:** All contributions _must_ be tested, and each added line of code\n   should be covered by at least one test. Good tests not only execute the code,\n   but explore corner cases. It can be tempting not to review tests, but please\n   do so.\n\nOther changes may be _nitpicky_: spelling mistakes, formatting,\netc. Do not insist contributors make these changes, but instead you should offer\nto make these changes by [pushing to their branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/committing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork),\nor using GitHub’s [suggestion](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request)\n[feature](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request), and\nbe prepared to make them yourself if needed. Using the suggestion feature is preferred because\nit gives the contributor a choice in whether to accept the changes.\n\nUnless you know that a contributor is experienced with git, don’t\nask for a rebase when merge conflicts arise. Instead, rebase the\nbranch yourself, force-push to their branch, and advise the contributor to force-pull. If the contributor is\nno longer active, you may take over their branch by submitting a new pull\nrequest and closing the original, including a reference to the original pull\nrequest. In doing so, ensure you communicate that you are not throwing the\ncontributor's work away! If appropriate it is a good idea to acknowledge other contributions\nto the pull request using the `Co-authored-by`\n[syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/creating-a-commit-with-multiple-authors) in the commit message.\n\n### Merge only changes you understand\n\n_Long-term maintainability_ is an important concern. Code doesn't\nmerely have to _work_, but should be _understood_ by multiple core\ndevelopers. Changes will have to be made in the future, and the\noriginal contributor may have moved on.\n\nTherefore, _do not merge a code change unless you understand it_. Ask\nfor help freely: we can consult community members, or even external developers,\nfor added insight where needed, and see this as a great learning opportunity.\n\nWhile we collectively \"own\" any patches (and bugs!) that become part\nof the code base, you are vouching for changes you merge. Please take\nthat responsibility seriously.\n\nFeel free to ping other active maintainers with any questions you may have.\n\n## Further resources\n\nAs a core member, you should be familiar with community and developer\nresources such as:\n\n- Our [contributor guide](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/contributing.html).\n- Our [code of conduct](https://github.com/pydata/xarray/tree/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n- Our [philosophy and development roadmap](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/roadmap.html).\n- [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) for Python style.\n- [PEP257](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/) and the\n  [NumPy documentation guide](https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/howto-docs.html#documentation-style)\n  for docstring conventions.\n- [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com) hooks for autoformatting.\n- [`ruff`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) autoformatting and linting.\n- [python-xarray](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python-xarray) on Stack Overflow.\n- [@xarray_dev](https://twitter.com/xarray_dev) on Twitter.\n- [xarray-dev](https://discord.gg/bsSGdwBn) discord community (normally only used for remote synchronous chat during sprints).\n\nYou are not required to monitor any of the social resources.\n\nWhere possible we prefer to point people towards asynchronous forms of communication\nlike github issues instead of realtime chat options as they are far easier\nfor a global community to consume and refer back to.\n\nWe hold a [bi-weekly developers meeting](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/developers-meeting.html) via video call.\nThis is a great place to bring up any questions you have, raise visibility of an issue and/or gather more perspectives.\nAttendance is absolutely optional, and we keep the meeting to 30 minutes in respect of your valuable time.\nThis meeting is public, so we occasionally have non-core team members join us.\n\nWe also have a private mailing list for core team members\n`xarray-core-team@googlegroups.com` which is sparingly used for discussions\nthat are required to be private, such as nominating new core members and discussing financial issues.\n\n## Inviting new core members\n\nAny core member may nominate other contributors to join the core team.\nWhile there is no hard-and-fast rule about who can be nominated, ideally,\nthey should have: been part of the project for at least two months, contributed\nsignificant changes of their own, contributed to the discussion and\nreview of others' work, and collaborated in a way befitting our\ncommunity values. **We strongly encourage nominating anyone who has made significant non-code contributions\nto the Xarray community in any way**. After nomination voting will happen on a private mailing list.\nWhile it is expected that most votes will be unanimous, a two-thirds majority of\nthe cast votes is enough.\n\nCore team members can choose to become emeritus core team members and suspend\ntheir approval and voting rights until they become active again.\n\n## Contribute to this guide (!)\n\nThis guide reflects the experience of the current core team members. We\nmay well have missed things that, by now, have become second\nnature—things that you, as a new team member, will spot more easily.\nPlease ask the other core team members if you have any questions, and\nsubmit a pull request with insights gained.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe are excited to have you on board! We look forward to your\ncontributions to the code base and the community. Thank you in\nadvance!\n"

          "content": "# Migration guide for users of `xarray-contrib/datatree`\n\n_15th October 2024_\n\nThis guide is for previous users of the prototype `datatree.DataTree` class in the `xarray-contrib/datatree repository`. That repository has now been archived, and will not be maintained. This guide is intended to help smooth your transition to using the new, updated `xarray.DataTree` class.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> There are breaking changes! You should not expect that code written with `xarray-contrib/datatree` will work without any modifications. At the absolute minimum you will need to change the top-level import statement, but there are other changes too.\n\nWe have made various changes compared to the prototype version. These can be split into three categories: data model changes, which affect the hierarchal structure itself; integration with xarray's IO backends; and minor API changes, which mostly consist of renaming methods to be more self-consistent.\n\n### Data model changes\n\nThe most important changes made are to the data model of `DataTree`. Whilst previously data in different nodes was unrelated and therefore unconstrained, now trees have \"internal alignment\" - meaning that dimensions and indexes in child nodes must exactly align with those in their parents.\n\nThese alignment checks happen at tree construction time, meaning there are some netCDF4 files and zarr stores that could previously be opened as `datatree.DataTree` objects using `datatree.open_datatree`, but now cannot be opened as `xr.DataTree` objects using `xr.open_datatree`. For these cases we added a new opener function `xr.open_groups`, which returns a `dict[str, Dataset]`. This is intended as a fallback for tricky cases, where the idea is that you can still open the entire contents of the file using `open_groups`, edit the `Dataset` objects, then construct a valid tree from the edited dictionary using `DataTree.from_dict`.\n\nThe alignment checks allowed us to add \"Coordinate Inheritance\", a much-requested feature where indexed coordinate variables are now \"inherited\" down to child nodes. This allows you to define common coordinates in a parent group that are then automatically available on every child node. The distinction between a locally-defined coordinate variables and an inherited coordinate that was defined on a parent node is reflected in the `DataTree.__repr__`. Generally if you prefer not to have these variables be inherited you can get more similar behaviour to the old `datatree` package by removing indexes from coordinates, as this prevents inheritance.\n\nTree structure checks between multiple trees (i.e., `DataTree.isomorophic`) and pairing of nodes in arithmetic has also changed. Nodes are now matched (with `xarray.group_subtrees`) based on their relative paths, without regard to the order in which child nodes are defined.\n\nFor further documentation see the page in the user guide on Hierarchical Data.\n\n### Integrated backends\n\nPreviously `datatree.open_datatree` used a different codepath from `xarray.open_dataset`, and was hard-coded to only support opening netCDF files and Zarr stores.\nNow xarray's backend entrypoint system has been generalized to include `open_datatree` and the new `open_groups`.\nThis means we can now extend other xarray backends to support `open_datatree`! If you are the maintainer of an xarray backend we encourage you to add support for `open_datatree` and `open_groups`!\n\nAdditionally:\n\n- A `group` kwarg has been added to `open_datatree` for choosing which group in the file should become the root group of the created tree.\n- Various performance improvements have been made, which should help when opening netCDF files and Zarr stores with large numbers of groups.\n- We anticipate further performance improvements being possible for datatree IO.\n\n### API changes\n\nA number of other API changes have been made, which should only require minor modifications to your code:\n\n- The top-level import has changed, from `from datatree import DataTree, open_datatree` to `from xarray import DataTree, open_datatree`. Alternatively you can now just use the `import xarray as xr` namespace convention for everything datatree-related.\n- The `DataTree.ds` property has been changed to `DataTree.dataset`, though `DataTree.ds` remains as an alias for `DataTree.dataset`.\n- Similarly the `ds` kwarg in the `DataTree.__init__` constructor has been replaced by `dataset`, i.e. use `DataTree(dataset=)` instead of `DataTree(ds=...)`.\n- The method `DataTree.to_dataset()` still exists but now has different options for controlling which variables are present on the resulting `Dataset`, e.g. `inherit=True/False`.\n- `DataTree.copy()` also has a new `inherit` keyword argument for controlling whether or not coordinates defined on parents are copied (only relevant when copying a non-root node).\n- The `DataTree.parent` property is now read-only. To assign a ancestral relationships directly you must instead use the `.children` property on the parent node, which remains settable.\n- Similarly the `parent` kwarg has been removed from the `DataTree.__init__` constructor.\n- DataTree objects passed to the `children` kwarg in `DataTree.__init__` are now shallow-copied.\n- `DataTree.map_over_subtree` has been renamed to `DataTree.map_over_datasets`, and changed to no longer work like a decorator. Instead you use it to apply the function and arguments directly, more like how `xarray.apply_ufunc` works.\n- `DataTree.as_array` has been replaced by `DataTree.to_dataarray`.\n- A number of methods which were not well tested have been (temporarily) disabled. In general we have tried to only keep things that are known to work, with the plan to increase API surface incrementally after release.\n\n## Thank you!\n\nThank you for trying out `xarray-contrib/datatree`!\n\nWe welcome contributions of any kind, including good ideas that never quite made it into the original datatree repository. Please also let us know if we have forgotten to mention a change that should have been listed in this guide.\n\nSincerely, the datatree team:\n\nTom Nicholas,\nOwen Littlejohns,\nMatt Savoie,\nEni Awowale,\nAlfonso Ladino,\nJustus Magin,\nStephan Hoyer\n"

Ensure your main branch is synced to upstream:\n    ```sh\n    git switch main\n    git pull upstream main\n    ```\n2.  Add a list of contributors.\n    First fetch all previous release tags so we can see the version number of the last release was:\n\n    ```sh\n    git fetch upstream --tags\n    ```\n\n    Then run\n\n    ```sh\n    python ci/release_contributors.py\n    ```\n\n    (needs `gitpython` and `toolz` / `cytoolz`)\n\n    and copy the output.\n\n3.  Write a release summary: ~50 words describing the high level features. This\n    will be used in the release emails, tweets, GitHub release notes, etc.\n4.  Look over whats-new.rst and the docs. Make sure \"What's New\" is complete\n    (check the date!) and add the release summary at the top.\n    Things to watch out for:\n    - Important new features should be highlighted towards the top.\n    - Function/method references should include links to the API docs.\n    - Sometimes notes get added in the wrong section of whats-new, typically\n      due to a bad merge. Check for these before a release by using git diff,\n      e.g., `git diff v{YYYY.MM.X-1} whats-new.rst` where {YYYY.MM.X-1} is the previous\n      release.\n5.  Open a PR with the release summary and whatsnew changes; in particular the\n    release headline should get feedback from the team on what's important to include.\n6.  After merging, again ensure your main branch is synced to upstream:\n    ```sh\n    git pull upstream main\n    ```\n7.  If you have any doubts, run the full test suite one final time!\n    ```sh\n    pytest\n    ```\n8.  Check that the [ReadTheDocs build](https://readthedocs.org/projects/xray/) is passing on the `latest` build version (which is built from the `main` branch).\n9.  Issue the release on GitHub. Click on \"Draft a new release\" at\n    <https://github.com/pydata/xarray/releases>. Type in the version number (with a \"v\")\n    and paste the release summary in the notes.\n10. This should automatically trigger an upload of the new build to PyPI via GitHub Actions.\n    Check this has run [here](https://github.com/pydata/xarray/actions/workflows/pypi-release.yaml),\n    and that the version number you expect is displayed [on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/xarray/)\n11. Add a section for the next release {YYYY.MM.X+1} to doc/whats-new.rst (we avoid doing this earlier so that it doesn't show up in the RTD build):\n\n    ```rst\n    .. _whats-new.YYYY.MM.X+1:\n\n    vYYYY.MM.X+1 (unreleased)\n    -----------------------\n\n    New Features\n    ~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n    Breaking changes\n    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n    Deprecations\n    ~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n    Bug fixes\n    ~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n    Documentation\n    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n    Internal Changes\n    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n    ```\n\n12. Commit your changes and push to main again:\n\n    ```sh\n    git commit -am 'New whatsnew section'\n    git push upstream main\n    ```\n\n    You're done pushing to main!\n\n13. Update the version available on pyodide:\n\n    - Open the PyPI page for [Xarray downloads](https://pypi.org/project/xarray/#files)\n    - Edit [`pyodide/packages/xarray/meta.yaml`](https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/blob/main/packages/xarray/meta.yaml) to update the\n      - version number\n      - link to the wheel (under \"Built Distribution\" on the PyPI page)\n      - SHA256 hash (Click \"Show Hashes\" next to the link to the wheel)\n    - Open a pull request to pyodide\n\n14. Issue the release announcement to mailing lists & Twitter. For bug fix releases, I\n    usually only email xarray@googlegroups.com. For major/feature releases, I will email a broader\n    list (no more than once every 3-6 months):\n\n    - pydata@googlegroups.com\n    - xarray@googlegroups.com\n    - numpy-discussion@scipy.org\n    - scipy-user@scipy.org\n    - pyaos@lists.johnny-lin.com\n\n    Google search will turn up examples of prior release announcements (look for\n    \"ANN xarray\").\n    Some of these groups require you to be subscribed in order to email them.\n\n<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->\n\n## Note on version numbering\n\nAs of 2022.03.0, we utilize the [CALVER](https://calver.org/) version system.\nSpecifically, we have adopted the pattern `YYYY.MM.X`, where `YYYY` is a 4-digit\nyear (e.g. `2022`), `0M` is a 2-digit zero-padded month (e.g. `01` for January), and `X` is the release number (starting at zero at the start of each month and incremented once for each additional release).\n"

The package includes a large and growing library\nof domain-agnostic functions for advanced analytics and visualization\nwith these data structures.\n\nXarray was inspired by and borrows heavily from\n[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org), the popular data analysis package\nfocused on labelled tabular data. It is particularly tailored to working\nwith [netCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf) files, which\nwere the source of xarray\\'s data model, and integrates tightly with\n[dask](https://dask.org) for parallel computing.\n\n## Why xarray?\n\nMulti-dimensional (a.k.a. N-dimensional, ND) arrays (sometimes called\n\"tensors\") are an essential part of computational science. They are\nencountered in a wide range of fields, including physics, astronomy,\ngeoscience, bioinformatics, engineering, finance, and deep learning. In\nPython, [NumPy](https://www.numpy.org) provides the fundamental data\nstructure and API for working with raw ND arrays. However, real-world\ndatasets are usually more than just raw numbers; they have labels which\nencode information about how the array values map to locations in space,\ntime, etc.\n\nXarray doesn\\'t just keep track of labels on arrays \\-- it uses them to\nprovide a powerful and concise interface. For example:\n\n- Apply operations over dimensions by name: `x.sum('time')`.\n- Select values by label instead of integer location:\n  `x.loc['2014-01-01']` or `x.sel(time='2014-01-01')`.\n- Mathematical operations (e.g., `x - y`) vectorize across multiple\n  dimensions (array broadcasting) based on dimension names, not shape.\n- Flexible split-apply-combine operations with groupby:\n  `x.groupby('time.dayofyear').mean()`.\n- Database like alignment based on coordinate labels that smoothly\n  handles missing values: `x, y = xr.align(x, y, join='outer')`.\n- Keep track of arbitrary metadata in the form of a Python dictionary:\n  `x.attrs`.\n\n## Documentation\n\nLearn more about xarray in its official documentation at\n<https://docs.xarray.dev/>.\n\nTry out an [interactive Jupyter\nnotebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pydata/xarray/main?urlpath=lab/tree/doc/examples/weather-data.ipynb).\n\n## Contributing\n\nYou can find information about contributing to xarray at our\n[Contributing\npage](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/contributing.html).\n\n## Get in touch\n\n- Ask usage questions (\"How do I?\") on\n  [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/pydata/xarray/discussions).\n- Report bugs, suggest features or view the source code [on\n  GitHub](https://github.com/pydata/xarray).\n- For less well defined questions or ideas, or to announce other\n  projects of interest to xarray users, use the [mailing\n  list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/xarray).\n\n## NumFOCUS\n\n<img src=\"https://numfocus.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/NumFocus_LRG.png\" width=\"200\" href=\"https://numfocus.org/\">\n\nXarray is a fiscally sponsored project of\n[NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org), a nonprofit dedicated to supporting\nthe open source scientific computing community. If you like Xarray and\nwant to support our mission, please consider making a\n[donation](https://numfocus.org/donate-to-xarray) to support\nour efforts.\n\n## History\n\nXarray is an evolution of an internal tool developed at [The Climate\nCorporation](https://climate.com/). It was originally written by Climate\nCorp researchers Stephan Hoyer, Alex Kleeman and Eugene Brevdo and was\nreleased as open source in May 2014. The project was renamed from\n\"xray\" in January 2016. Xarray became a fiscally sponsored project of\n[NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org) in August 2018.\n\n## Contributors\n\nThanks to our many contributors!\n\n[![Contributors](https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=pydata/xarray)](https://github.com/pydata/xarray/graphs/contributors)\n\n## License\n\nCopyright 2014-2024, xarray Developers\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you\nmay not use this file except in compliance with the License.
