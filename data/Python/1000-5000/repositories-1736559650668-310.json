          "content": "# Contributing to the Python Elasticsearch Client\n\nIf you have a bugfix or new feature that you would like to contribute to\nelasticsearch-py, please find or open an issue about it first. Talk about what\nyou would like to do. It may be that somebody is already working on it, or that\nthere are particular issues that you should know about before implementing the\nchange.\n\nWe enjoy working with contributors to get their code accepted. There are many\napproaches to fixing a problem and it is important to find the best approach\nbefore writing too much code.\n\n## Running Elasticsearch locally\n\nWe've provided a script to start an Elasticsearch cluster of a certain version\nfound at `.buildkite/run-elasticsearch.sh`.\n\nThere are several environment variables that control integration tests:\n\n- `PYTHON_VERSION`: Version of Python to use, defaults to `3.9`\n- `PYTHON_CONNECTION_CLASS`: Connection class to use, defaults to `Urllib3HttpConnection`\n- `STACK_VERSION`: Version of Elasticsearch to use. These should be\n  the same as tags of `docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch`\n  such as `8.0.0-SNAPSHOT`, `7.x-SNAPSHOT`, etc. Defaults to the\n  same `*-SNAPSHOT` version as the branch.\n\n**NOTE: You don't need to run the live integration tests for all changes. If\nyou don't have Elasticsearch running locally the integration tests will be skipped.**\n\n## API Code Generation\n\nAll API methods for the `Elasticsearch` and `AsyncElasticsearch` client instances\n(like `search()`) are automatically generated from the\n[Elasticsearch specification](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-specification)\nand [rest-api-spec](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/tree/master/rest-api-spec/src/main/resources/rest-api-spec/api).\nAny changes to these methods should instead be submitted to the Elasticsearch specification project and will be imported the next time\nthe clients API is generated. The generator itself is currently a private project.\n\n## Contributing Code Changes\n\nThe process for contributing to any of the Elasticsearch repositories is similar.\n\n1. Please make sure you have signed the [Contributor License\n   Agreement](http://www.elastic.co/contributor-agreement/). We are not\n   asking you to assign copyright to us, but to give us the right to distribute\n   your code without restriction. We ask this of all contributors in order to\n   assure our users of the origin and continuing existence of the code. You only\n   need to sign the CLA once.\n\n2. Run the linter and test suite to ensure your changes do not break existing code:\n\n   ```\n   # Install Nox for task management\n   $ python -m pip install nox\n   \n   # Auto-format and lint your changes\n   $ nox -rs format\n   \n   # Run the test suite\n   $ nox -rs test\n   ```\n\n3. Rebase your changes.\n   Update your local repository with the most recent code from the main\n   elasticsearch-py repository, and rebase your branch on top of the latest `main`\n   branch. We prefer your changes to be squashed into a single commit for easier\n   backporting.\n\n4. Submit a pull request. Push your local changes to your forked copy of the\n   repository and submit a pull request. In the pull request, describe what your\n   changes do and mention the number of the issue where discussion has taken\n   place, eg “Closes #123″.  Please consider adding or modifying tests related to\n   your changes.\n\nThen sit back and wait. There will probably be a discussion about the pull\nrequest and, if any changes are needed, we would love to work with you to get\nyour pull request merged into elasticsearch-py.\n"

It does not mean that the clients automatically support new features\nof newer Elasticsearch versions; it is only possible after a release of a new\nclient version. For example, a 8.12 client version won't automatically support\nthe new features of the 8.13 version of Elasticsearch, the 8.13 client version\nis required for that. Elasticsearch language clients are only backwards\ncompatible with default distributions and without guarantees made.\n\n| Elasticsearch Version | Elasticsearch-Python Branch | Supported |\n| --------------------- | ------------------------ | --------- |\n| main                  | main                     |           |\n| 8.x                   | 8.x                      | 8.x       |\n| 7.x                   | 7.x                      | 7.17      |\n\n\nIf you have a need to have multiple versions installed at the same time older\nversions are also released as ``elasticsearch7`` and ``elasticsearch8``.\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation for the client is [available on elastic.co] and [Read the Docs].\n\n[available on elastic.co]: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/python-api/current/index.html\n[Read the Docs]: https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.io\n\n\n## License\n\nThis software is licensed under the [Apache License 2.0](./LICENSE).
