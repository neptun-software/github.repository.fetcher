It allows you to set up an API from your database that can answer questions in plain English. You can use Dataherald to:\n\n- Allow business users to get insights from the data warehouse without going through a data analyst\n- Enable Q+A from your production DBs inside your SaaS application\n- Create a ChatGPT plug-in from your proprietary data\n\nThis repository contains four components under `/services` which can be used together to set up an end-to-end Dataherald deployment:\n\n1. Engine: The core natural language-to-SQL engine. If you would like to use the dataherald API without users or authentication, running the engine will suffice.\n2. Enterprise: The application API layer which adds authentication, organizations and users, and other business logic to Dataherald. \n3. Admin-console: The front-end component of Dataherald which allows a GUI for configuration and observability. You will need to run both engine and enterprise for the admin-console to work.\n4. Slackbot: A slackbot which allows users from a slack channel to interact with dataherald. Requires both engine and enterprise to run.\n\nFor more information on each component, please take a look at their `README.md` files.\n\n## Running locally\n\nEach component in the `/services` directory has its own `docker-compose.yml` file. To set up the environment, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Set Environment Variables**:\n   Each service requires specific environment variables. Refer to the `.env.example` file in each service directory and create a `.env` file with the necessary values. \n   > For the Next.js front-end app is `.env.local`\n2. **Run Services**:\n   You can run all the services using a single script located in the root directory. This script creates a common Docker network and runs each service in detached mode.\n\nRun the script to start all services:\n\n```bash\nsh docker-run.sh\n```\n\n## Contributing\nAs an open-source project in a rapidly developing field, we are open to contributions, whether it be in the form of a new feature, improved infrastructure, or better documentation.\n\nFor detailed information on how to contribute, see [here](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n"
