The docker needs to be rebuilt upon any change in the Python code or the Markdown code.\n\n### Running without Docker (locally)\n\nTo run the development server outside of a Docker, run the following command once: \n\n    make build-local\n\nAnd then run:\n\n    DEFAULT_DOMAIN=learn-js.org make run-local\n    \n\n### IDEOne Credentials\n\nTo make the IDEOne execution API work locally, you must obtain a username and password, \nand add the credentials to a file called app.env.\n(TBD: add an option to use the remote version) \n\nContributors\n============\n- superreg\n- JBoy Advance\n- qwong95\n- AddaxSoft\n- derco0n\n- ...<perhaps you>...\n\n<p>This project is supported by:</p>\n<p>\n  <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/\">\n    <img src=\"https://opensource.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/attribution/assets/SVG/DO_Logo_horizontal_blue.svg\" width=\"201px\">\n  </a>\n</p>"
