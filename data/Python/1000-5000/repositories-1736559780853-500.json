Every\nlittle bit helps, and credit will always be given.\n\nYou can contribute in many ways:\n\nTypes of Contributions\n----------------------\n\nReport Bugs\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nReport bugs at https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/issues.\n\nIf you are reporting a bug, please include:\n\n* Your operating system name and version.\n* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.\n* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.\n\nFix Bugs\n~~~~~~~~\n\nLook through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with \"bug\"\nis open to whoever wants to implement it.\n\nImplement Features\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nLook through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with \"feature\"\nis open to whoever wants to implement it.\n\nAdding Plugins\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nLivestreamer can always use more plugins. Look through the GitHub issues\nif you are looking for something to implement.\n\nThere is no plugin documentation at the moment, but look at the existing\nplugins to get an idea of how it works. \n\nWrite Documentation\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nLivestreamer could always use more documentation, whether as part of the\nofficial Livestreamer docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts,\narticles, and such.\n\nSubmit Feedback\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/issues.\n\nIf you are proposing a feature:\n\n* Explain in detail how it would work.\n* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.\n* Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions\n  are welcome :)\n\nGet Started!\n------------\n\nReady to contribute? Here's how to set up `livestreamer` for local development.\n\n1. Fork the `livestreamer` repo on GitHub.\n2. Clone your fork locally::\n\n    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/livestreamer.git\n\n3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development::\n\n    $ mkvirtualenv livestreamer\n    $ cd livestreamer/\n    $ python setup.py develop\n\n4. Create a branch for local development::\n\n    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature\n\n  Now you can make your changes locally.\n\n5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass the\ntests, including testing other Python versions with tox::\n\n    $ python setup.py test\n    $ tox\n\n  To get tox, just pip install it into your virtualenv.\n\n6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::\n\n    $ git add .\n    $ git commit -m \"Your detailed description of your changes.\"\n    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature\n\n7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.\n\nPull Request Guidelines\n-----------------------\n\nBefore you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:\n\n1. The pull request should include tests if it's a core feature.\n2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated.\n3. When creating a pull request, make sure it's on the correct branch.\n   These branches are currently used:\n\n   - master: Only critical fixes that needs to be released ASAP.\n   - develop: Everything else.\n\n4. The pull request should work for Python 2.6, 2.7, and 3.3, and for PyPy. Check \n   https://travis-ci.org/chrippa/livestreamer/pull_requests\n   and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.\n\n"

Currently most of the big streaming services are supported,\nsuch as:\n\n- `Dailymotion <http://dailymotion.com/live>`_\n- `Livestream <http://livestream.com>`_\n- `Twitch <http://twitch.tv>`_\n- `UStream <http://ustream.tv>`_\n- `YouTube Live <http://youtube.com>`_\n\n... and many more. A full list of plugins currently included can be found\non the `Plugins`_ page.\n\n.. _Plugins: http://docs.livestreamer.io/plugin_matrix.html\n\nQuickstart\n-----------\n\nThe default behaviour of Livestreamer is to playback a stream in the default\nplayer (`VLC <http://videolan.org/>`_).\n\n.. sourcecode:: console\n\n    # pip install livestreamer\n    $ livestreamer twitch.tv/day9tv best\n    [cli][info] Found matching plugin twitch for URL twitch.tv/day9tv\n    [cli][info] Opening stream: source\n    [cli][info] Starting player: vlc\n\nFor more in-depth usage and install instructions see the `User guide`_.\n\n.. _User guide: http://docs.livestreamer.io/index.html#user-guide\n\nRelated software\n----------------\n\nFeel free to add any Livestreamer related things to\nthe `wiki <https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/wiki/>`_.\n\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nIf you wish to report a bug or contribute code, please take a look\nat `CONTRIBUTING.rst <CONTRIBUTING.rst>`_ first.\n\n"
