If you want to test tracker on new dataset, please refer to [pysot-toolkit](https://github.com/StrangerZhang/pysot-toolkit) to setting `testing_dataset`. \n\n### Test tracker\n```bash\ncd experiments/siamrpn_r50_l234_dwxcorr\npython -u ../../tools/test.py \t\\\n\t--snapshot model.pth \t\\ # model path\n\t--dataset VOT2018 \t\\ # dataset name\n\t--config config.yaml\t  # config file\n```\nThe testing results will in the current directory(results/dataset/model_name/)\n\n### Eval tracker\nassume still in experiments/siamrpn_r50_l234_dwxcorr_8gpu\n``` bash\npython ../../tools/eval.py \t \\\n\t--tracker_path ./results \\ # result path\n\t--dataset VOT2018        \\ # dataset name\n\t--num 1 \t\t \\ # number thread to eval\n\t--tracker_prefix 'model'   # tracker_name\n```\n\n###  Training :wrench:\nSee [TRAIN.md](TRAIN.md) for detailed instruction.\n\n\n### Getting Help :hammer:\nIf you meet problem, try searching our GitHub issues first. We intend the issues page to be a forum in which the community collectively troubleshoots problems. But please do **not** post **duplicate** issues. If you have similar issue that has been closed, you can reopen it.\n\n- `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pysot'`\n\n:dart:Solution: Run `export PYTHONPATH=path/to/pysot` first before you run the code.\n\n- `ImportError: cannot import name region`\n\n:dart:Solution: Build `region` by `python setup.py build_ext —-inplace` as decribled in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).\n\n\n## References\n\n- [Fast Online Object Tracking and Segmentation: A Unifying Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05050).\n  Qiang Wang, Li Zhang, Luca Bertinetto, Weiming Hu, Philip H.S.
