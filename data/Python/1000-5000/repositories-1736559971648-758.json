Please pull this repo to obtain the latest codes.\n- [2022/6/13]: We release an initial version of BEVFormer. It achieves a baseline result of **51.7%** NDS on nuScenes.\n- [2022/5/23]: 🚀🚀Built on top of BEVFormer, **BEVFormer++**, gathering up all best practices in recent SOTAs and our unique modification,  ranks **1st** on [Waymo Open Datast 3D Camera-Only Detection Challenge](https://waymo.com/open/challenges/2022/3d-camera-only-detection/). We will present BEVFormer++ on CVPR 2022 Autonomous Driving [Workshop](https://cvpr2022.wad.vision/).\n- [2022/3/10]: 🚀BEVFormer achieve the SOTA on [nuScenes Detection Task](https://nuscenes.org/object-detection?externalData=all&mapData=all&modalities=Camera) with **56.9% NDS** (camera-only)!\n</br>\n\n\n# Abstract\nIn this work, the authors present a new framework termed BEVFormer, which learns unified BEV representations with spatiotemporal transformers to support multiple autonomous driving perception tasks. In a nutshell, BEVFormer exploits both spatial and temporal information by interacting with spatial and temporal space through predefined grid-shaped BEV queries. To aggregate spatial information, the authors design a spatial cross-attention that each BEV query extracts the spatial features from the regions of interest across camera views. For temporal information, the authors propose a temporal self-attention to recurrently fuse the history BEV information.\nThe proposed approach achieves the new state-of-the-art **56.9\\%** in terms of NDS metric on the nuScenes test set, which is **9.0** points higher than previous best arts and on par with the performance of LiDAR-based baselines.\n\n\n# Methods\n![method](figs/arch.png \"model arch\")\n\n\n# Getting Started\n- [Installation](docs/install.md) \n- [Prepare Dataset](docs/prepare_dataset.md)\n- [Run and Eval](docs/getting_started.md)\n\n# Model Zoo\n\n| Backbone | Method | Lr Schd | NDS| mAP|memroy | Config | Download |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:|:---:| :---: | :---: |\n| R50 | BEVFormer-tiny_fp16 | 24ep | 35.9|25.7 | -
