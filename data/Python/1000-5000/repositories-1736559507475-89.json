          "content": "Version 5.0 and newer\n---------------------\n\nPlease refer to the `GitHub Releases Page <https://github.com/stephenmcd/mezzanine/releases>`_.\n\nVersion 4.3.1 (Aug 08, 2018)\n----------------------------\n\n  * Allow fabfile to be importable when building docs - steve@jupo.org\n  * Remove top-level ``__init__.py`` from new projects. Closes #1860 - steve@jupo.org\n  * Fix HTML escaping. Closes #1866 - steve@jupo.org\n\nVersion 4.3.0 (Jun 15, 2018)\n----------------------------\n\n  * Added explicit ``on_delete`` arguments for all ForeignKey models - Samir Shah\n  * Only generate thumbnails in RichText when absolute width/height used. Closes #1748 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Removed null attribute from slug CharField - Samir Shah\n  * Converted all ``template.render`` calls to pass a dict instead of a Context object - Samir Shah\n  * Fixed ``MezzanineBackend.authenticate`` backend to accept a request argument, added in Django 1.11 - Samir Shah\n  * Fixed ``test_multiple_comment_forms`` to be agnostic of the order of HTML attributes - Samir Shah\n  * Altered annotation behaviour of search results. Previously this was done implicitly in the ``SearchQuerySet.iterator()`` method,. which Django would call internally when evaluating the queryset. Django 1.11 changed its behaviour to use a ModelIterator class instead of. just calling `iterator()` on the queryset. Rather than suppy a custom. ModelIterator, we just make the annotate explicit - Samir Shah\n  * Updated setup and test configuration to include Django 1.11 - Samir Shah\n  * password reset: 'http' -> ``request.schema``. This fixes a potential security vulnerability in which the password. reset url is exposed to untrusted intermediary nodes in the network. Thanks to John Barham for reporting. See. ``<https://groups.google.com/forum/?_escaped_fragment_=topic/mezzanine-users/KaDzCzCJDPM#!topic/mezzanine-users/KaDzCzCJDPM>`` - ryneeverett\n  * Add explicit ``on_delete`` arguments to foreign keys in migrations - Samir Shah\n  * Use TextField for ``Field.label`` and ``Field.help_text``. Fixes #1753. Now length limits for user-defined labels and ``help_texts`` are enforced in the admin instead of the DB, which should prevent any further migrations - Eduardo Rivas\n  * Get rid of ``max_length`` settings for `mezzanine.forms` - Eduardo Rivas\n  * Timezone aware blog months. From [the mailing. ``list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mezzanine-users/W1HNoqj1ZHI):`` Quoting Luke Addison (2017-04-30 21:20:09). > When ``USE_TZ`` is set to True,. > ``mezzanine.blog.templatetags.blog_tags.blog_months`` pulls the month and year. > from an array of timezone aware datatime objects but uses them to create an. > array of timezone unaware datatime objects which is the used to create the. > ``month_dicts`` return value. This seems like a bug to me. >. > For example, if a UTC time is stored in the database less than an hour. > before the end of a month, and then this tag is used with timezone. > Europe/London (UTC+1 currently) then wouldn't this tag return the pervious. > month instead of the current month? - ryneeverett\n  * Test and simplify ``blog_months`` - ryneeverett\n  * Weigh search results by age. Weigh search results by their age by default. Add a new setting,. `SEARCH_AGE_SCALE_FACTOR`, controlling how much emphasis to put on the. age when ranking results (set this to 0 to revert to the old behavior) - Simen Heggestøyl\n  * Split dev and prod ``ALLOWED_HOSTS``. Django started checking `ALLOWED_HOSTS` when `DEBUG=True` a few releases back. See ``https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2016/nov/01/security-releases/#s-cve-2016-9014-dns-rebinding-vulnerability-when-debug-true`` - Ed Rivas\n  * Update docs related to ``ALLOWED_HOSTS`` - Ed Rivas\n  * Fix the old url parsing in import wordpress - Karim N Gorjux\n  * Use Django's six module - Stephen McDonald\n  * Don't warn Mezzanine about itself - Stephen McDonald\n  * Looser check for LocalMiddleware. Closes #1621 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Modified the blog homepage pattern to a working version. Added import it requires - Ville Ranki\n  * Remove explicit ``show_banner`` argument from ``inner_run``. This broke --noreload for me. When called from ``https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/core/management/commands/runserver.py#L107``, if ``**options`` contains a ``show_banner`` arg (which, seemingly, is set just above in ``add_arguments``), this throws a \"Got multiple values for argument\" TypeError - Kevin Shen\n  * Handle ``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`` -> MIDDLEWARE - Stephen McDonald\n  * Don't use lazy static loading when Django's ManifestStaticFilesStorage is configured. Closes #1772 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Link to Pillow docs for dependencies - Stephen McDonald\n  * Adding new site to site list. Adding \"The National: New Australian Art\" to the site list. ``https://the-national.com.au`` - pegl\n  * Doesn't convert JPG/JPEG images to RGBA. resolve #1781 - Bruno Barbosa\n  * Remove all device-detection features - Eduardo Rivas\n  * Remove mentions of device handling from docs - Eduardo Rivas\n  * Use template loaders instead of middlware for host-based template swapping - Eduardo Rivas\n  * Add docs on upgrading from TemplateForHostMiddleware - Eduardo Rivas\n  * Create ``__init__.py`` so Python can find directory - Dylan Peter Hayward\n  * Properly parse positional args. As demonstrated by using ``call_command``, the positional args not. processed. This may be a left-over from optarg migration. Usage property is no longer necessary - Melvyn Sopacua\n  * Fix build fail while in here - Melvyn Sopacua\n  * Added more tests por pages - Vindio\n  * Update ``page_not_found`` view args. Closes #1795 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Rename Displayable ``is_public`` to published - Stephen McDonald\n  * Test Nginx config before restarting. This way the configuration won't be updated if it's broken, and you also get an error message in the terminal explaining why it's broken (instead of just telling you to check service status/journal) - Andrés Martano\n  * Enable browser-native spell checking in WYSIWYG tinymce editor, which got wiped in 82339b0 . Previously introduced in 86f6ef6 - Michel\n  * Fixing the support for external links which are moved to child categories in the menu hierarchy - Gerik Peterson\n  * Update ``LOGOUT_URL`` to make use of ``ACCOUNT_URL`` - Adam Radwon\n  * Ensure template vars for form defaults are properly escaped - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fix drag-n-drop for Form field inlines. Fixes #1841. Inherit from DynamicInlineAdminForm to inject the necessary JS files - Eduardo Rivas\n  * Fix failing tests that assume threadlocals have been set up - Luke Plant\n  * Pulled out middleware present check into its own function. And fixed Python 3 compat - Luke Plant\n  * Made all middleware installation checking consistent. All check by string first, and then for classes and subclasses,. correctly ignoring things that aren't classes - Luke Plant\n  * Fix failing tests that assume threadlocals have been set up (#1848) - Luke Plant\n  * Fix keywords widget for Django 1.11. Closes #1844 - stephenmcd\n  * Fix sense of ``SITE_PERMISSION_MIDDLEWARE`` check. Issue introduced by commit 00f4a63c - Ross Younger\n  * Fix sense of other check for ``SITE_PERMISSION_MIDDLEWARE``. Issue introduced by commit 00f4a63 - Ross Younger\n  * Added basic tests for TemplateSettings. The tests follow the existing functionality - Luke Plant\n  * Gave TemplateSettings a useful ``__repr__``. Previously it just returned '{}' always, from super()s empty dict - Luke Plant\n  * Don't emit warning when doing ``force_text(TestSettings())``. This is to fix the behaviour of getting lots of instances of: UserWarning: ``__unicode__`` is not in ``TEMPLATE_ACCESSIBLE_SETTINGS``. if you have django-debug-tool installed - Luke Plant\n  * Prevent changes to ``FORMS_EXTRA_FIELDS`` setting creating new migrations - steve@jupo.org\n  * Support access to related model on Django 2+ - Williams Mendez\n  * Fix safe string handling in richtext filters - steve@jupo.org\n  * Fix some test warnings - steve@jupo.org\n  * Add deprecation handling for ``mark_safe`` as decorator - steve@jupo.org\n  * Fix SplitSelectDateTimeWidget which Django 1.9 broke. Closes #1838 - steve@jupo.org\n  * Fix usage of ``request.scheme`` in password reset email - Eduardo Rivas\n  * Make thumbnail tag recognize ``.PNG`` and ``.GIF``. Files with the upper case extensions ``.PNG`` and ``.GIF`` are now recognized by. the thumbnail template tag as being PNG- and GIF images, respectively,. instead of being treated as JPEG images - Simen Heggestøyl\n  * Added gcc and rsync for the full deployment on the freshly installed Debian (eg. on OVH) - lukasz\n  * Support `SelectDateWidget` in django 1.8 and django 2.x - Williams Mendez\n  * Narrow exception handling to ImportError only - Williams Mendez\n\nVersion 4.2.3 (Mar 10, 2017)\n----------------------------\n\n  * Test ``MultiChoiceField.validate`` when invalid. For the record, this raises a TypeError prior to Simen's commit - ryneeverett\n  * Test ``MultiChoiceField.validate`` when valid. Also, I realized that the `choices` kwarg needs to be a nested list - ryneeverett\n  * Ensure createdb command passes on the exepcted options to base class - Stephen McDonald\n  * Workaround for Django bug with templates field and empty values - Stephen McDonald\n  * Update travis django versions. (#1683). See discussion at. ``https://github.com/stephenmcd/mezzanine/commit/1866997c64725b3161b59628c8deaee544f0c473`` - ryneeverett\n  * Subclass Django's redirect admin to filter by site - Stephen McDonald\n  * Remove \"Overriding vs. Extending\" Docs. I know we discussed this a little bit somewhere and rewriting this. section was suggested. However, I don't see any reason to keep it. around. This was always a django issue but we provided a. mezzanine-specific solution. Now that there's a django solution, why. clutter our docs with it? - ryneeverett\n  * Richtext filters must return SafeString. For now, just raise a warning. In the way-off future I'd like to see. ``richtext_filters`` raise an exception when a SafeString is not received. Django makes a contract with users: \"Unless you explicitly mark. untrusted input as safe, we'll escape it and you don't need to worry. about XSS ``vulnerabilities.\"`` My position is that reusable apps should. proxy this contract to users. In doing so, this also moves the SafeString conversion out of templates. and into the `escape` function in which bleach actually makes the html. safe. The closer these two components are to each other the less likely. we are to make a mistake in between them - ryneeverett\n  * Fix ``SSLRedirectMiddleware.__init__`` signature. As reported on the mailing list. ``(https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mezzanine-users/d5mcAMOVcnk/uqw61LyjAwAJ),``. this raised a TypeError because the `get_response` argument is optional - ryneeverett\n  * Move “required” from field help text to template. The forms app used to set “required” as the help text for fields that. are required and didn’t have a help text already. Move this text into. the template instead, making it easier to override - Simen Heggestøyl\n  * Use ``call_command()`` instead of execute() (#1691) - Geoffrey ROYER\n  * Remove the ``no_color`` handling in createdb management command (#1691) - Geoffrey ROYER\n  * Fix example in profile docs - Stephen McDonald\n  * Remove outdated message regarding auto-reload. Since ``local_settings.py`` is added to ``sys.modules``, the autoreload is working as expected. See: ``https://github.com/stephenmcd/mezzanine/blob/master/mezzanine/project_template/project_name/settings.py#L308`` - Ed Rivas\n  * Document ``static_lazy's`` purpose. This is a summary of the reasoning in. ``https://github.com/stephenmcd/mezzanine/pull/1411`` - ryneeverett\n  * Update contributing guidelines to reflect practice. The language here is too broad and has caused several users to submit. high quality bug reports or patches to the mailing list when it's. actually easier to deal with them in the tracker - ryneeverett\n  * Fix TinyMCE support in dynamic inlines (#1674). * Fix TinyMCE support in dynamic inlines. Use TinyMCE’s jQuery plugin to initialise our editors, and handle. Django’s formset:added event to initialise editors in dynamically added. forms. * Tidy up TinyMCE initialisation code. * Call out changes to ``jquery.tinymce.min.js`` more visibly - Alex Hill\n  * Warn when editing admin users without permissions. Closes #1707 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Move contributing guidelines to ``CONTRIBUTING.rst``. This will present itself before people open issues which should cut down. on a lot of the erroneous ones - ryneeverett\n  * Fix short URL generation - Stephen McDonald\n  * Add support for importing via blogml - Evan Mattiza\n  * Clean up blogml importer - Stephen McDonald\n  * Added python 3.6 (#1720) - Andrii Soldatenko\n  * Deprecate ``as_tag`` templatetag shortcut. It isn't documented but folks may be using it anyway. We can't switch. over to ``simple_tag`` internally yet until we drop support for ``django-1.8`` - ryneeverett\n  * Restore tinymce support in front-end editing. Closes #1718 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fix caching editable settings forever when no request - David Sanders\n  * Blog RSS feed - set length property for images (enclosure) - Yuri Prezument\n  * Blog RSS - add ``mime_type`` for images (enclosure) - Yuri Prezument\n  * Blog Atom feed - add \"updatedate\" property - Yuri Prezument\n  * Fix issue with PyPy2 (#1725). Under PyPy2 you can't do u\"foo\" == lazy(static, str)(\"bar\") because the. code assumes dir(str) is a strict subset of dir(unicode), which isn't. true on PyPy2. The other way around is no problem however, and the. other strings in the static assets lists are unicode anyway - Ernst Sjöstrand\n  * Fix issue 1710. During user validation, only save POST data in session if it is a POST. request, otherwise saved comment may be overwritten by GET request that. results from redirect if user verification is required - Chris Hawes\n  * Re-order JavaScript loading to ensure TinyMCE has access to correct variables. Closes #1728 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Nicer way to import and register checks. The previous way meant every check gets mentioned 3 times (def, import,. register), with this way it is just once, and all the ``django.core.checks``. are together - Luke Plant\n  * Converted SitePermissionMiddleware warning to a Django check. Refs issue #1400 - Luke Plant\n  * Added hashbangs/permission bits to make scripts more easily runnable - Luke Plant\n  * Made it easier to run individual tests - Luke Plant\n  * Documented how to run tests - Luke Plant\n  * Fixed pyflakes errors for ``.checks`` imports - Luke Plant\n  * Fixed login form to not use ``request.REQUEST``. This is not available in Django 1.9 and greater, so without this fix the. forms are (slightly) broken. There doesn't seem to be any reason to use. REQUEST instead of POST - the form is a POST one, and the parameters are not. used elsewhere in the code base to construct a querystring - Luke Plant\n  * Fixed search forms to use ``request.GET`` instead of ``request.REQUEST``. ``request.REQUEST`` is not available in Django 1.9 and greater - Luke Plant\n  * Support latest bleach, BS, html5lib. Closes #1741, closes #1742, closes #1743 - Stephen McDonald\n\nVersion 4.2.2 (Sep 25, 2016)\n----------------------------\n\n  * Add an option for turning off the runserver banner. Add an option to Mezzanine’s runserver command for not showing the. banner at startup - Simen Heggestøyl\n  * Only set ``content_model`` first time. Fix #1676 - ryneeverett\n\nVersion 4.2.1 (Sep 19, 2016)\n----------------------------\n\n  * Issue #1565. Added conditions for assigning keywords to the keyword widget, when a validation error occurs - xuryax\n  * Stop using deprecated template settings. - ``TEMPLATE_DIRS``. - ``TEMPLATE_LOADERS``. I think these must have been actually removed in ``django-1.10.0`` because. they're throwing AttributeError's now - ryneeverett\n  * Remove deprecated ``richtext_filter`` tag. I don't see how the fallback could even work without the user defining. ``RICHTEXT_FILTERS`` as empty in their own settings, because it defaults to. `(\"mezzanine.utils.html.thumbnails\",)` so the `if not filternames` path. would never be taken. Give that the fallback does nothing, I think. printing a warning is deceptive so better just to remove it entirely - ryneeverett\n  * Fixed crash in ``Page.get_ascendants`` with non-current site - Alex Hill\n  * Add ``override_current_site_id`` context manager - Alex Hill\n  * Make sure a thread-local request is set in PagesTests. We rely in these tests on a “current request” being stored as a. thread-local, but without explicitly assigning one we were dependent on. other tests that make requests being executed before these - Alex Hill\n  * Exclude ``.pyc``, ``.pyo`` and ``__pycache__`` files from release - Edward Betts\n  * Correctly handle custom email fields in ``mezzanine.forms``. The `is_a` method checks whether a field is one of Mezzanine's built-in. form fields. As far as I can tell, every other usage is for the purpose. of initializing the built-in fields and widgets, so it makes sense to. exclude user-defined fields. However in this instance, we only want to know whether the field is an. EmailField, not that it is *the* built-in Mezzanine email field. Therefore, check the class rather than identity. The effective change here is that user-defined fields (in. ``FORMS_EXTRA_FIELDS)`` which subclass django's EmailField will be able to. receive confirmation emails - ryneeverett\n  * Remove redundant assignment of ``request.site_id`` - Alex Hill\n  * Add compatibility with the Django 1.10 MIDDLEWARE setting - Samir Shah\n  * Added test for KeywordWidget - xuryax\n  * Updated Test for KeywordWidget - xuryax\n  * Add more docstrings to ContentTyped - ryneeverett\n  * Set base ContentTyped ``content_model`` to None. Per discussion with @AlexHill in cartridge#293, ``content_model`` is the. name of django's automatic OneToOneField's linking the concrete base. class inheriting from ContentTyped to it's subclasses. There is no such. field when the base class itself is instantiated, so the ``content_model``. should be None - ryneeverett\n  * ``ContentTyped.get_content_model()`` should return instance, not class - Alex Hill\n  * Test admin redirects for ContentTyped models - Alex Hill\n  * Small error documentation. I think there are a small error : fields (plural) not field - Anthony\n  * Add some MIDDLEWARE compatibility fixes that were missing from #1660. Also change the way in which the middleware setting is determined. A statis variable will fail when settings are modified on the fly, ``e.g.``, when running tests - Samir Shah\n  * Fix positional argument count on ``get_db_prep_value`` - Jeff Cook\n  * Restore context vars in ``admin_dropdown_menu`` templatetag. Closes #1669 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fix request context for form entries in admin - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fix template for form entries in admin - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fix overextends tag with cached template loader - Alex Hill\n  * Deprecate overextends tag since Django now includes its functionality - Alex Hill\n  * Remove some obsolete checks for Django < 1.8 - Alex Hill\n  * Deprecate SSLRedirectMiddleware. Resolve #1600. Also, set default SSL settings to `editable=False` so they do not. display in the settings by default - ryneeverett\n  * Move most Field functionality into abstract base class - Alex Hill\n  * Escape comment usernames in admin list - Stephen McDonald\n  * Move richtext filtering into a util function - Stephen McDonald\n\nVersion 4.2.0 (Aug 12, 2016)\n----------------------------\n\n  * Update collecttemplates command for 4.1. Closes #1512 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Return correct HTTP error response if static proxy cannot find requested file - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fix dummy homepage object in sitemap. Closes #1516 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fixes #1449 -- duplicate profile fields in admin - Alex Hill\n  * Move template form CSS rule to grappelli-safe - Alex Hill\n  * Removed nesting of Context objects. Inclusion tags should: * Return dictionaries, not Context objects. * Explicitly pass all needed data to their templates. * Not modify passed in Context object ideally. No code should wrap Context objects in further Context objects, as this. causes errors in some contexts - Luke Plant\n  * Fix blog pagination due to Django 1.9 change - Stephen McDonald\n  * Don't load user model at import time in tests - Stephen McDonald\n  * Move misc admin related urlpatterns under /admin/ for better compatibility with SSLRedirectMiddleware. Closes #1365 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fix user creation with required profile fields - Alex Hill\n  * Removed syncdb from deploy as it is no longer supported in ``Django1.9`` and has been depricated since 1.7, migrate is used instead - Douglas Kastle\n  * Use Django's native dynamic inline mechanism - Alex Hill\n  * Remove custom dynamic inline templates - Alex Hill\n  * Support with i18n urlpatterns with ``SSL_FORCE_URL_PREFIXES``. Closes #1456 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Restore the ordering-related parts of ``dynamic_inline.js``. We still need to use ``dynamic_inline.js`` for its custom ordering code, but we can remove everything related to dynamically adding and removing inline forms since we're now using Django's built-in mechanisms for that - Alex Hill\n  * Remove now-unused dynamic inline templates - Alex Hill\n  * Update Python/Django versions in documentation - Stephen McDonald\n  * Accept either CDATA or text nodes for WordPress comments. ,. All text output is CDATA in an export from WordPress 4.4.2. It is hoped. that accepting either text or CDATA as node type will be compatible. with exports from all versions of WordPress - Jeff Cook\n  * Changed proxy to resolve mime types using the mimetypes library for python - Andrew Cassidy\n  * Google Chrome seems to interpret an empty response as. <html><body></body></html> so forced ``content_type`` to text/plain to. prevent Chrome handling it in this way - Andrew Cassidy\n  * Changed free themes url. I have changed the URL for the free themes - thecodinghouse\n  * Fix help text for Link page URL. The field is required, but the inherited help text says it's optional - Gavin Wahl\n  * Add Coveralls coverage testing to CI, per #1012 - ryneeverett\n  * Clear ``TEST_COLLATION`` deprecation warning - David Sanders\n  * Add Federation of Egalitarian Communities Website - Pavan Rikhi\n  * Only autofocus visible fields with Html5Mixin - David Sanders\n  * Replace all ``_meta.fields`` with ``_meta.get_fields``. According to ``https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/models/meta/`` to. access all the fields of the ``_meta`` object you should call ``get_fields()``. This. is new with Django 1.8. The ``_meta.fields`` is now a property with a docstring. saying it's Private API intended only to be used by Django itself - Geoff Crompton\n  * Ensure csrftoken cookie is set inside nevercache tag - David Sanders\n  * Remove check for CSRF token before re-running CSRF middleware - David Sanders\n  * Add testcase for nevercache and CSRF cookie - David Sanders\n  * Response should be marked as CSRF processing not done, not request - David Sanders\n  * Fix unicode errors in user agent check for devices. Closes #1589 - Stephen McDonald\n  * ``ModelAdmin.in_menu`` -> ``has_module_permission``. Deprecate `ModelAdmin.in_menu` now that django has an equivalent method,. `ModelAdmin.has_module_permission`. See. ``<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/ref/contrib/admin/#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.has_module_permission>`` - ryneeverett\n  * Replace undocumented ``ModelAdmin.get_model_perms``. Instead use the documented methods `ModelAdmin.has_change_permission`. and `ModelAdmin.has_add_permission` - ryneeverett\n  * Fix tests for pyflakes 1.2.x. The warning message now includes the module name - ryneeverett\n  * Fix selector of the ``_order`` field to make stacked inlines sortable - Eduardo Rivas\n  * Catch TinyMCE errors when trying to save inlines. Previously this used to prevent the new ``_order`` values from being computed - Eduardo Rivas\n  * Annotate special handling of the ``_order`` field in inlines - Eduardo Rivas\n  * Add CSS to hide the ``_order`` field in stacked inlines - Eduardo Rivas\n  * Constrain content images to max width in default templates - Stephen McDonald\n  * un-urlencode thumbnail filenames. Closes #1580 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Clarify format of ``ADMIN_REMOVAL`` setting - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fix: Add missing space - cspollar\n  * Fix file name decoding from zip files in python 3. In python3, non-ascii filenames in galleries are incorrectly decoded,. interpreting utf8 code points as box-drawing characters. For example, in. the demo project \"Ávila Spain\" is incorrectly parsed as \"A╠üvila Spain\". CP437 is a superset of ascii and the de facto standard for file names. Obviously not every valid utf-8 character is in this character set, but. a lot of tooling does not support file names with characters outside. this set anyway. If we were to encode them in a broader character set I. suspect we would get into OS-interoperability issues, so better to. forego encoding them and coerce them into valid file names. Note that this changes the behavior such that in python3, file names are. now decoded with a chardet-detected encoding. It's also notable that the latest release of chardet incorrectly. identifies the encoding, so in the demo galleries, \"Ávila Spain\" is. incorrectly parsed as \"AĚvila Spain\". This is fixed in chardet master - ryneeverett\n  * ``base_concrete_model:`` accept model class argument. Previously only model instances were accepted but now model classes can. be passed alternatively - ryneeverett\n  * Factor custom content types out of Page. Custom content types are now implemented as Model and ModelAdmin mixins. This way they can be reused by Cartridge's Product model - ryneeverett\n  * Add ``content_typed/change_list.html`` include. This eliminates template duplication for the content type selector in. cartridge. Note that all jQuery events are propagated unless one of them returns. `false`, so both of our `addlist` change handlers get called. ``http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4379403/jquery-event-handlers-return-values`` - ryneeverett\n  * Append default ``TEMPLATE_ACCESSIBLE_SETTINGS``. This means users don't have to copy the defaults into their settings and. are protected from future changes to the settings used by internal. mezzanine templates - ryneeverett\n  * Warn when unallowed template settings are used. Since the exception is suppressed, give a hint that the template. setting isn't allowed - ryneeverett\n  * dynamically set current rating if it exists - Martín Gaitán\n  * Remove redundant slash in urlpatterns when homepage is the blog - Stephen McDonald\n  * Django 1.10 removed ``LOGOUT_URL``, so provide a default - Stephen McDonald\n  * Replace Django's deprecated ``AUTH_PROFILE_MODULE`` setting with new ``ACCOUNTS_PROFILE_MODEL`` setting - Stephen McDonald\n  * Remove use of NoArgsCommand, which Django 1.10 removes - Stephen McDonald\n  * Remove ``content_typed`` namespace. - ``content_typed.py`` -> ``models.py`` + ``admin.py``. - ``content_typed/change_list.html`` ->. ``admin/includes/content_typed_change_list.html`` - ryneeverett\n  * Restore guards against back button in page tree / content typed JS - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fix encoding in blog feeds. Closes #1461 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Add form media to Form pages. My use case is adding form assets to a widget used by a field included. in the ``FORMS_EXTRA_FIELDS`` setting. I don't think one should have to. override this template to do this and overextension doesn't seem to work. on content-typed templates - ryneeverett\n  * Fail gracefully on third-party admin classes that do odd things. Closes #1628 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Prevent bleach from stripping 'tel:' hrefs in HTML - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fix #1438 -- allow multiple comment forms on a page - Alex Hill\n  * Use ``call_command`` instead calling ``Command.execute()`` directly - Alex Hill\n  * Fix search by hacking around Django's abstract manager restriction - Alex Hill\n  * Allow Django 1.10 in ``setup.py`` - Alex Hill\n  * Pass raw context dict to ``template.render()`` in error views - Alex Hill\n  * Remove testing of dotted path for ``LOGIN_URL`` setting, since Django 1.10 doesn't support it - Stephen McDonald\n  * Prevent Django 1.10 from adding required attribute to admin change list actions dropdown - Stephen McDonald\n  * Replace usage of optparse with argparse - Alex Hill\n  * Ensure blog import commands contain base args - Stephen McDonald\n  * Add Django ``stable/1.10.x`` to test matrix - Alex Hill\n  * Upgrade pip and setuptools before test run - Alex Hill\n  * Restore access to parent template context in comments template tag. Closes #1654 - Stephen McDonald\n\nVersion 4.1.0 (Jan 17, 2016)\n----------------------------\n\n  * Update Python version classifiers in ``setup.py`` - Stephen McDonald\n  * Update excluded files in package build - Stephen McDonald\n  * Force ``local_settings.py`` into ``sys.modules`` so it's visible to Django's autoreloader - Stephen McDonald\n  * Add the ability to use proxy in \"Add ,\" drop down. We sometimes want to use proxy models in the add dropdown, to have. different changeform being backed-up by the same model. See ce02f8afe3d42dda for more information about the \"and not. ``m._meta.proxy\"`` part - Antoine Catton\n  * Improve readability by using list comprehension - Antoine Catton\n  * Remove extraneous site permissions field. Closes #1366 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Add to settings this: ``RATINGS_ACCOUNT_REQUIRED`` = True ``COMMENTS_ACCOUNT_REQUIRED`` = True ``RATINGS_RANGE`` = [-1, 1] and then run tests you will get about 5 errors, so i fixed tests for these settings and now they work well - d-first\n  * Do not throw away next parameter on login. ``get_full_path()`` throws away the \"next\" URL parameter, breaking. vanilla Django redirection behavior. The login form should redirect. to the \"next\" parameter on a successful login - Alexander Bliskovsky\n  * When the thumbnail richtext filter runs, deal with BeautifulSoup adding closing br tags, by stripping them out. Closes #1377 - Stephen McDonald\n  * ``r_range`` deleted replased with settings - d-first\n  * Fix textarea fields in live-editing - Stephen McDonald\n  * Upgrade to jQuery 1.8.3 - Nik Nyby\n  * Upgrade jQuery UI to 1.8.24. This upgrades jQuery UI from 1.8.2 to 1.8.24, fixing. a bunch of bugs. It also changes the CSS file used for jQuery UI - the ``v1.9``. CSS was being used, so I've replaced it with the appropriate. CSS for version 1.8.24 - Nik Nyby\n  * Upgrade ``jquery.form.js`` to 3.51.0-2014.06.20 - Nik Nyby\n  * Fix edit overlay vertical positioning - Nik Nyby\n  * Upgrade Bootstrap from 3.0.3 to 3.1.1 - Nik Nyby\n  * Test on Python 2.7, Django 1.8. These are the versions I use by default, so we shouldn't need to exclude this combination - Nik Nyby\n  * Don't use zip files - Nik Nyby\n  * Fix TinyMCE width in live-editing - Stephen McDonald\n  * Bootstrap 3.2.0. Continuing the effort of gradually updating bootstrap,. this upgrades from 3.1.1 to 3.2.0. There's not many changes here and everything's looking okay. to me - Nik Nyby\n  * Fix tag list padding - Stephen McDonald\n  * Make a note about removing JS hack for site permissions field at some stage - Stephen McDonald\n  * Update ``tinymce_setup.js:`` Django language codes. ``https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/i18n/``. Language codes are generally represented in lower-case, but the HTTP Accept-Language header is case-insensitive. The separator is a dash. I also noticed a warning message showing when I run 'python ``manage.py`` runserver'. it's about 'zh-tw' will be deprecated in Django 1.9, use 'zh-hant' instead. So I also add 'zh-hant'. I guess 'zh-cn' may be deprecated too. I tested 'zh-hant' and 'zh-tw' well, my tinymce editor shows hints in Traditional Chinese now. I only change the content in \"var ``language_codes`` = {}\" block, but github marks whole file to be changed. I don't know why - fygul\n  * Update ``frequently-asked-questions.rst``. Update the link of ``\"urls.py`` module\" - Fygul Hether\n  * Checking if page attribute in request is of type ``mezzanine.page.models.Page``, before processing it - pirave\n  * Ken is a core team member - Stephen McDonald\n  * Add support for blogs with > 500 posts - Anna Wiggins\n  * Replace timestamp trimming code with a more robust regex; current code broke on some timestamps returned by blogger - Anna Wiggins\n  * Add several new overridable blocks to the base template - Anna Wiggins\n  * Fix and test ``page_processor's`` ``exact_page`` argument - David Sanders\n  * Updating disqus sso tag with working encoder - pirave\n  * Resolve css/js Media paths using static templatetag - David Sanders\n  * Clean up page context processor check - Stephen McDonald\n  * Removing ``tox.ini`` since it's out of date - and of course it is, we don't use it - Stephen McDonald\n  * ``utils.html:`` HTMLParseError disappeared in Python 3.5. The HTMLParser is guaranteed not to choke on HTML soup - Hervé Cauwelier\n  * Add kwarg for form used in login and password reset views - David Sanders\n  * Don't titlecase group name for ``ADMIN_MENU_ORDER`` - David Sanders\n  * Add ``_parent_page_ids`` to global context scope. Currently if the first menu loaded is in a nested context. ` parent_pages_ids` can drop out of scope, and then never get reset since. `menu_pages` is set in `context.dicts[0]`. See ``https://github.com/stephenmcd/mezzanine/issues/1154`` - Julian Andrews\n  * Upgrade html5shiv to ``v3.7.3`` - Nik Nyby\n  * Remove unnecessary triple-quote in comment - Nik Nyby\n  * Don't overwrite files options in mezzanine-project command. Updating the `files` option here disables the `--name` option, which I need. to render custom template files ``(i.e``. a Makefile) when making a custom. mezzanine template for use with `mezzanine-project`. This change adds `local_settings.py.template` to the list of files to render instead. of overwriting the list completely. This allows users to specify their own template. files if necessary. Relevant django code is here: ``https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/core/management/templates.py#L56``. And my mezzanine template I'm getting this to work with is here: ``https://github.com/nikolas/ctlmezzanine`` - Nik Nyby\n  * Ensure global context variables set in ``page_menu`` template tag are actually global - Stephen McDonald\n  * Switch to a lazy static for Media statics - David Sanders\n  * In the admin dropdown menu, show add links to users without change permissions. This is a patch to fix the following problem: 1. Create a user with add permissions but not change permissions on a model. that is managed through the admin ``(e.g``. blog posts). 2. Log in as that user in the admin site. 3. Click on the name of the model in the dropdown menu on the left. 4. Error. The problem arises because the template uses the ``admin_url`` instead of the. ``add_url`` for users without appropriate permissions to change instances of the. model. It then tries to remedy the situation by manually appending 'add/' to. the url. However, the url it receives from the template tag ``admin_url`` is set. to 'None' - Pieter\n  * Fix for ``is_spam_akismet`` to handle Python 3's bytestring response properly - Christian Hill\n  * Handle None as ``content_type`` subclass without breaking - Sam Kingston\n  * Restore login redirects on ratings/comments. Closes #1440 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Check for ``FORMS_USE_HTML5`` on the admin instead of the model. Fixes #1399 - Eduardo Rivas\n  * Removing duplicate profile fields from admin. Issue #1449 - Danny Sag\n  * Document ``errors_for`` and update ``fields_for`` docs. - The fields for template path and type are out of date. - Document ``errors_for`` since it adds a lot of value to ``fields_for`` - ryneeverett\n  * Add references to api-docs. This will add links to documentation generated from the source - Tomas Chmelevskij\n  * Added mezzanine-shortcodes to third-party apps - Stephen McDonald\n  * Don't strip HTML in TinyMCE. Because filtering is handled by bleach. Reimplement 0f6ab7c - ryneeverett\n  * Recommend using ``includes/footer_scripts``. This is how it's done in the default templates but docs-readers probably. aren't going to know that they're already calling `editable_loader` via. an include - ryneeverett\n  * Add support for Python 3.5 in trove classifiers and travis build - Sam Kingston\n  * Add a setter for property ``MenusField.choices``. Django 1.9’s ``CharField.choices`` is just a regular attribute, no longer a. property. Its constructor tries to set a value, and since we weren’t. providing a setter, we’d hit an exception - Alex Hill\n  * Update project template to use TEMPLATES - Alex Hill\n  * Suggest using TEMPLATES in ``set_dynamic_settings`` - Alex Hill\n  * Replace SortedDict with OrderedDict - Alex Hill\n  * Drop support for Django 1.7 - Alex Hill\n  * Drop Python 3.3 support - Alex Hill\n  * Don't use OrderableBase in 1.9. Django 1.9 supports ordering with respect to generic foreign keys,. which makes OrderableBase no longer necessary - Alex Hill\n  * Update Django & Python versions in ``setup.py`` - Alex Hill\n  * Import skipUnless from Python's unites - Alex Hill\n  * Fix saving related objects in tests - Alex Hill\n  * Don't use removed ``Field.get_flatchoices()`` - Alex Hill\n  * Remove check for page context processor in PageMiddleware - Alex Hill\n  * Remove LazyModelOperations. Django now provides lazy model signals which accept model strings and. render this class redundant - Alex Hill\n  * Update flake8 configuration to match Django's - Alex Hill\n  * Refactor ``EXTRA_MODEL_FIELD`` code. Break into a few smaller functions, and use ``Apps.lazy_model_operation``. instead of ``class_prepared`` signal - Alex Hill\n  * Remove usage of SubfieldBase - Alex Hill\n  * Revert \"Don't use OrderableBase in 1.9\". This reverts commit 54d900776a2c7412cdacd7b5a6a4af44affac869 - Alex Hill\n  * Remove complexity check from flake8 config. This wasn’t being honoured by the lint test before, so causes several. failures when enabled. We can add it again later and refactor those. functions if necessary - Alex Hill\n  * Bring ``docs/conf.py`` into line with flake8 - Alex Hill\n  * Restore but deprecate Mezzanine's ``get_user_model()``. This wasn’t actually defined before, simply imported from Django. We. define it here in order to provide a deprecation warning for anybody. importing it from this file - Alex Hill\n  * Make ``EXTRA_MODEL_FIELDS`` work in 1.8 again - Alex Hill\n  * Add a ``footer_js`` block in templates - Alex Hill\n  * Fix usage of TemplateResponse - Alex Hill\n  * Account for middleware subclasses in ``cache_installed()`` - Alex Hill\n  * Remove \"builtins\" from TEMPLATE options in Django < 1.9 - Alex Hill\n  * Can't use add() with bulk=False in Django 1.8 - Alex Hill\n  * Formalise template tests with checks framework - Alex Hill\n  * Fixed #1483 ValueError while parsing dates of imported Blogger posts - Daniel Blasco\n  * missing french messages for accounts, compiling ``.mo`` file - flo@mymedecine.fr\n  * Move SingletonAdmin to utils. Resolve #1480 - ryneeverett\n  * Add classes to ``app_list`` in admin. This provides a hook for model specific styling, and mirrors what Django. itself does. See: ``https://github.com/django/django/blob/5399ccc0f4257676981ef7937ea84be36f7058a6/django/contrib/admin/templates/admin/index.html#L23`` - Julian Andrews\n  * Catch error if user sitepermissions don't exist. For the most part, if not using `SitePermissionMiddleware` Mezzanine. falls back on the `is_staff` attribute seamlessly. But since. d5d21ba527bd4 it's possible to have users without sitepermissions. This. breaks the admin dropdown, but not much else. This fix should allow. single site projects to continue to leave `SitePermissionMiddleware`. uninstalled - Julian Andrews\n  * Fall back to title field first before using string rep for meta title - Stephen McDonald\n  * Give the media library a root URL so it can be correctly highlighted in the admin nav. Closes #1505 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Only add debug toolbar urlpatterns if installed - Stephen McDonald\n  * Support admin classes registered via decorator. Closes #1462 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fix some more cases of related managers requiring saved data in Django 1.9 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Remove redundant slashes in blog urlpatterns - Stephen McDonald\n  * Update from deprecated features of urlpatterns - Stephen McDonald\n  * Remove use of deprecated ``get_all_field_names()`` - Stephen McDonald\n  * Remove deprecated use of ``i18n_patterns()`` - Stephen McDonald\n  * Remove deprecated middleware names - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fix admin login interface selector - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fix slashes in blog urlpatterns - Stephen McDonald\n  * Create links to settings mentioned in the comments. Adds labels to the ``settings.rst`` files which can be used accross the. documentation to to link to their description - Tomas Chmelevskij\n  * Remove deprecated category/keyword helpers on blog posts, which existed for Django 1.3 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Remove Django 1.7 support from overextends templatetag - Stephen McDonald\n  * Remove a bunch of Django 1.7 handling from tests - Stephen McDonald\n  * TEMPLATES is a list of configurations - ryneeverett\n  * ``django.core.context_processors->django.template,``. RemovedInDjango110Warning: ``django.core.context_processors`` is deprecated in favor of ``django.template.context_processors`` - ryneeverett\n  * string url views -> callable url views. RemovedInDjango110Warning: Support for string view arguments to url() is deprecated and will be removed in Django 1.10, Pass the callable instead - ryneeverett\n  * Fix user profile signal handler - Stephen McDonald\n  * Restore profile form fields - Stephen McDonald\n\nVersion 4.0.1 (Jul 26, 2015)\n----------------------------\n\n  * Prompt for user creation in createdb command if interactive - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fix #1351 - exception in ``displayable_links_js`` - Alex Hill\n  * Use Django's createsuperuser command when createdb is run in interactive mode - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fix some Django 1.9 warnings - Stephen McDonald\n  * Remove references to long deprecated ``PAGES_MENU_SHOW_ALL`` setting - Stephen McDonald\n  * Locale middleware should fall after session middleware - Stephen McDonald\n  * Set up debug toolbar explicitly when installed. Closes #1358 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Restore support for alternate package option in mezzanine-project command - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fix for issue #1361 - backup command fails when called from deploy - Luke Plant\n  * Use 'exec' instead of import to add ``local_settings``. This allows ``local_settings`` to reference and modify existing settings. Refs issue #1360 - Luke Plant\n\nVersion 4.0.0 (Jul 09, 2015)\n----------------------------\n\n  * Strip punctuation from keywords instead of non-alphanumeric chars, since languages like Hindi use characters that Python doesn't consider to be alphanumeric - Stephen McDonald\n  * Unpin tzlocal version 1.0 - Alex Hill\n  * Update tinymce setup to use browsers' built in spell checking. Tested and works in latest FireFox and Chrome and Safari - joshcartme\n  * Support custom user models in admin password change view. Previously it was assumed that the user's pw change view is at \"auth/user/(\\d+)/password/\", which caused NoReverseMatch with custom models - Rivo Laks\n  * Fix admin password change for Django 1.5 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Support Django 1.7 migrations - Baylee Feore\n  * Don't remove south when ``USE_SOUTH`` isn't defined - Stephen McDonald\n  * Use ``is_staff`` to check for logged in user in base admin template. Closes #1114 - Stephen McDonald\n  * beautifulsoup version should not be pinned exactly. There's no need to require exactly 4.1.3 - Gavin Wahl\n  * Added brackets for Python 3 print() - Tuk Bredsdorff\n  * Handle malformed user agent strings. Closes #1116 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Configure ``SOUTH_MIGRATION_MODULES`` setting to check for custom south migration packages - Stephen McDonald\n  * Move ``south_migrations`` -> migrations/south - Stephen McDonald\n  * Added `The Entrepreneurial School <http://theentrepreneurialschool.com/>` to site using Mezzanine - Renyi Khor\n  * Fix DoesNotExist when non admin visits /admin. SitePermission objects are only added when staff users are created. If a non admin user (with no manually assigned site permissions) visits the admin a DoesNotExist is raised since no site permissions exist for the user. Therefore the templatetags logic should only run if the user is staff - joshcartme\n  * Exposed ``JQUERY_UI_FILENAME`` for templates - wrwrwr\n  * wordpress export is under Tools, not Settings - Gavin Wahl\n  * Renamed all ``get_query_set`` methods to ``get_queryset``. Django 1.6 normalized the naming, providing a metaclass that handles. previous naming schemes, while printing a warning. See: ``https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/15363``. This is probably incompatible with 1.5, but limits the amount of. Django 1.8 deprecation warnings - wrwrwr\n  * Explicitly list fields when defining form from model. This only changes one test (`` test_richtext_widget``), but here's a. short article that may explain why ``fields`` or ``exclude`` becomes. mandatory argument to ``modelform_factory`` and why you actually may. want to explicitly list fields to be available in forms: ``http://blog.mhartl.com/2008/09/21/mass-assignment-in-rails-applications/`` - wrwrwr\n  * Unfrozen future, pep and flakes. If the reason to keep these at some fixed old versions still exists,. please add a comment - wrwrwr\n  * Let sqlite configuration not contain a ``NAME`` at all (as with some settings environments) - wrwrwr\n  * Resolve race condition in ``conf.settings`` - Alex Hill\n  * Fixed a couple of block comments not starting with hash and space - wrwrwr\n  * List form fields (as recommended) to preserve compatibility with 1.5. The ``\"__all__\"`` shortcut must be ``past-1.6`` only - wrwrwr\n  * Fixed ``test_login_required`` when run without ``mezzanine.accounts``. Note 1: Always testing both scenerios no matter what's in the settings. would be thorough, but without something like the 1.7+ ``modify_settings``. it turns out ugly. It would be better to run the whole suite with and. without some optional apps. Note 2: This test passes when run through ``runtests``, but it cheats. by forcing ``mezzanine.accounts`` into installed apps ;-) - wrwrwr\n  * Allow Mezzanine's static files handling to support ``MEDIA_ROOT`` outside of ``STATIC_ROOT`` during development - Stephen McDonald\n  * Don't colorize the terminal banner if color sequences aren't supported - Stephen McDonald\n  * Cleaned up ``in_menus`` defaults test. Making use of the runtime settings changes support - wrwrwr\n  * Added failing settings race condition test - Alex Hill\n  * Simpler fix for race condition in settings - Alex Hill\n  * Reorder and add comments to settings test - Alex Hill\n  * Overwrite settings cache when loading from DB - Alex Hill\n  * Clear DB settings after test run - Alex Hill\n  * Made forms tests use Mezzanine's TestCase. Not currently necessary, but potentially surprising if you add something. to the TestCase - wrwrwr\n  * Added a simple decorator defining ``get_query_set`` or ``get_queryset``. allowing to use the latter one while preserving compatibility with 1.5. Django (1.6+) uses a metaclass to allow usage of the former name after. renaming a method (``django.utils.deprecation.RenameMethodsBase``), but. for the 2 cases in Mezzanine a decorator seems sufficient and less. intrusive - wrwrwr\n  * Replaced usage of ``Options.get_(add|change|delete)_permission`` with. ``auth.get_permission_codename``. Just a single case in ``utils/views.py``. The former one is deprecated and will be removed in Django 1.8; see. ``https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/20642`` - wrwrwr\n  * Added an 1.5-compatible implementation of ``get_permission_codename`` - wrwrwr\n  * Made MenusField respect the current value of ``PAGE_MENU_TEMPLATES_DEFAULT`` - wrwrwr\n  * Small semantic change in MenusField behavior, now ``in_menus`` returns an. empty tuple instead of None for a page not in any menu. This seems more consistent with ``PAGE_MENU_TEMPLATES_DEFAULT`` = tuple() - wrwrwr\n  * Made MenusField also support dynamic changes to ``PAGE_MENU_TEMPLATES``. This costs a call to a private ``Field._get_choices()``, because. ``Field.choices`` is already a property - wrwrwr\n  * Extended the ``test_login_required`` to check if ``LOGIN_URL`` set to view or. pattern name still allows the decorator to work as expected. The new cases are only checked if ``mezzanine.accounts`` is installed. These additional ``LOGIN_URL`` possibilities were introduced in 1.5; view. objects should also work, but don't seem to be documented - wrwrwr\n  * Don't test the new options with 1.4, it's not supposed to support them - wrwrwr\n  * Prevent duplicate app names when testing - Stephen McDonald\n  * Extend ``renamed_get_queryset`` to also support admin classes, and apply to OwnableAdmin - Stephen McDonald\n  * ``set_slug`` now save itself - Dustin Broderick\n  * ``set_slug`` now saves itself - Dustin Broderick\n  * Remove the requirement for searchable models to subclass Displayable - Stephen McDonald\n  * Handle installing initial data with Django 1.7's syncdb signals. Closes #1123 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Remove redundant page save in slug tests - Stephen McDonald\n  * Slightly faster settings loader - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fix some docstrings and messages - Stephen McDonald\n  * Actually skip the threading test as expected - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fix version check in ``post_syncdb`` signals - Stephen McDonald\n  * Added description of \"label\" keyword argument of ``register_settings``. function to docs - eyeinthebrick\n  * Cache site ID on request object, even when fallback setting is used. Closes #1144 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fix site ID fallback when testing - Stephen McDonald\n  * separate basic gallery functionality. to be more flexible with creating galleries we can separate gallery. functionality so it can be reused if developer wants to create a. gallery but not necessarily a gallery page - Robert Zywucki\n  * Added a test for DynamicInlineAdmin - wrwrwr\n  * Allow DynamicInlineAdmin fields to be a tuple. Previously, if fields was defined as a tuple, a very confusing TypeError. would be raised - Rocky Meza\n  * Travis test the latest versions of Django. This way you don't have to update every time a security release comes. out - Rocky Meza\n  * Re-instate conf test as per recent threading fixes. Closes #858 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Return HTTP 405 on comment/rating URLs for GET requests. Closes #1159 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fix Travis Django installation - Rocky Meza\n  * Shamelessly modified the dynamic admin fields tuple test, so it checks. ``get_fieldsets()`` instead of directly using the fields attribute. Also made BaseDynamicInlineAdmin work when fields are listed without. the ``_order`` field or fieldsets are declared (with or without it) - wrwrwr\n  * SiteRelated changed to allow explicit site assignment on creation - Kelvin Wong\n  * Made \"flake8 .\" output less warnings. Excluded ``docs/conf.py`` as its autogenerated by Sphinx and increased. acceptable complexity from 10 to 20 - wrwrwr\n  * Allowed optional apps to be loaded for testing - wrwrwr\n  * Separated generation of ``short_urls`` from their saving - wrwrwr\n  * include menu pages in broader context. issue #1154 - Eduardo S. Klein\n  * Refactored confirmation prompts in createdb, ``create_pages`` and collecttemplates - wrwrwr\n  * Factored out deleting unused keywords as a manager method - wrwrwr\n  * Removed ``django_extensions`` from ``INSTALLED_APPS`` for testing - wrwrwr\n  * Fixed ``pages.test_login_required`` with I18N / LocaleMiddleware - wrwrwr\n  * Fixed ``core.test_password_reset`` with ``i18n_patterns`` - wrwrwr\n  * Use the response context during two-phase rendering. If a response has `context_data` use that instead of creating a new. context and running context processors again - David Sanders\n  * Fix for using response ``context_data`` - David Sanders\n  * Remove call to ``set_model_permissions`` in page admin - Alex Hill\n  * Backout context processor changes to cache middleware for now, re #1174 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Prevent order setting vs. form submission race condition. If the js runs slow for any reason the admin form can submit before the order of inlines has been set - joshcartme\n  * Create new model field OrderField - Alex Hill\n  * ``OrderWidget.is_hidden`` should evaluate False - Alex Hill\n  * Update orderable ordering to use the submit event. It seems that the click event may not be guaranteed to run in FireFox before the form actually submits. This may be due to a variety of factors including the version of jQuery but for now switching to the submit event solves the problem - joshcartme\n  * Fixed spelling of 'collapsed' - Stone C. Lasley\n  * Refactored all the initial data setup to only occur when the createdb command is used, since Django 1.7's migrations no longer provide a signal that can reliably trap when tables are created - Stephen McDonald\n  * Added migrations for changed ``_order`` field - Stephen McDonald\n  * Host the dashboard screentshot in the docs so it can be correctly referenced on github - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fix docs build for Django 1.7 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fix for brocken link - Krzysztof Szumny\n  * Fix optional data installation for non-interactive installs - Stephen McDonald\n  * Don't store absolute urls as short urls in the db, since the column length is shorted, and these aren't necessairly permanent either. Closes #1178 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Refactored the ``fields_for`` templatetag to allow for custom field template - Avery Laird\n  * nginx conf: use Mozilla recommended ciphers. For the included ``nginx.conf``, use the ciphersuite recommended by the Operations. Security team at the Mozilla project: ``https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS``. The ones included here are the ones labelled \"Intermediate compatibility\". They. also document a ciphersuite with a higher level of security on that page. labelled \"Modern compatibility\", though it excludes more older browsers - Lorin Hochstein\n  * Updated the js in ``footer_scripts.html`` to handle universal analytics - Avery Laird\n  * Convert relative URLs to absolute in RSS feed item descriptions.

Makes it look less. crammed - Eduardo Rivas\n  * Render form errors with a new {% ``errors_for`` %} template tag. This new template tag accomplishes three things: - Fixes the bug of multiple form error messages appearing when using. {% ``fields_for`` %}. This bug was intruduced in [this ``commit](https://github.com/jerivas/mezzanine/commit/323660db5bee7e21358315c4e247eaa8ee77b034)``. and was discovered when [migrating Cartridge to ``BS3](https://github.com/clemensbasti/cartridge/pull/1)``. - Decouples error message rendering from form field rendering, with. the added flexibility of placing the error messages wherever we want. - Creates a new template ``(includes/form_errors.html)`` as the single. location to control form error rendering through all Mezzanine and. Cartridge - Eduardo Rivas\n  * Admin href disqus recent comments to https or http via double slash. Changed how the disqus widget in the admin panel loads its recent. comments.

Add BS3 resources: css, js and fonts - Eduardo Rivas\n  * Migrated ``base.html`` and all it's includes to BS3 - Eduardo Rivas\n  * Strip ``STATIC_URL``, leading / from proxied URLs. ``STATIC_URL`` often contains host or ``generic_host`` (esp. if ``STATIC_URL`` is a. path on the same domain), so it needs to be removed first to ensure it. is removed completely. Also removed leading '/' from URL, since it. appears staticfiles doesn't like absolute paths - Adam Brenecki\n  * Added a function ``mezzanine.utils.urls.next_url`` which is used to retrieve redirect URLs from a request's next param, while verifying that the redirect URL is valid - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fix min Dajngo version - Stephen McDonald\n  * Use ``request.get_host`` rather than ``request.META['HTTP_HOST']`` - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fix Django version for travis - Stephen McDonald\n\nVersion 1.4.14 (Sep 14, 2013)\n-----------------------------\n\n  * Blog: Catch exception if a non-existent month is requested from the archives - Eduardo Rivas\n\nVersion 1.4.13 (Sep 10, 2013)\n-----------------------------\n\n  * Allow for there being no \"errors\" in the twitter api response. When a successful \"user\" query to the twitter api is completed the json that is returned is a list. In order to validate the response the code tests to see if it was a dictionary with an \"error\" key. However passing a string as a index to a list will raise a TypeError, which was not being caught by the \"except\" clause. I have added TypeError to the list of items being caught. There are of course other ways of verifying the response but I think just adding the TypeError is in keeping with what you have already done. For reference, here is what I was seeing: > python ``manage.py`` ``poll_twitter`` --traceback --force. Traceback (most recent call last): ,. File ``\"/,/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mezzanine/twitter/models.py\"``, line 74, in run. raise TwitterQueryException(tweets[\"errors\"][0][\"message\"]).

Also consistent naming for tests - Stephen McDonald\n  * Move tons of tests into their correct apps - Stephen McDonald\n  * Patch ``jquery.overlay`` with ``jquery.browser`` support to work with new jQuery versions.

Rather than having the form ``page_processor`` send mail from user submitted email addresses (if present) have it specify the Reply-To header - Josh Cartmell\n  * Get rid of ``FORMS_DISABLE_SEND_FROM_EMAIL_FIELD``, always add the Reply-To header if there is an ``email_to`` - Josh Cartmell\n  * Adding template accessible settings into context for rendering templates for emails - Danny Sag\n  * Handling case when diff between min and max count is smaller than size. Weights were not calculated correctly when difference between `max_count` and `min_count` was smaller than `settings.TAG_CLOUD_SIZES`. Changed calculation of weights to use floating point arithmetic.

The plural version takes precedence if it is. available and non-empty. Each item in ``RICHTEXT_FILTERS`` is applied in. order. An alias for the ``richtext_filter`` template filter has been added to. match the plural nature of the new setting: ``richtext_filters`` simply. calls on ``richtext_filter`` for its output - Tim Valenta\n  * Fixed blog post categories list in ``blog_post_list.html`` template - Artem Gluvchynsky\n  * Removed redundant jQuery media from KeywordsWidget - Artem Gluvchynsky\n  * Use urljoin in ``Page.get_absolute_url`` for link pages - Dheeraj Sayala\n  * RTL: fix position of changelink icon in page tree after recent changes.

South is expecting those fields to be in the database. So it is. selecting them, since some custom user models don't have them, this can. break this migration - Antoine Catton\n\nVersion 1.4.8 (Jun 27, 2013)\n----------------------------\n\n  * Fix nginx config to work on more recent ubuntu versions. Not sure how backwards compatible this is.

Closes #676 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Use a more explicit name in ``PageAdmin.get_content_models`` which won't collide with a commonly used field name such as name - Stephen McDonald\n  * Don't use ``ugettext_lazy`` for form field labels since Django will double-escape them. Closes #682 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Move case-insensitive keyword creation into KeywordManager, and allow for duplicate results. Closes #679 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fix ``ADD_PAGE_ORDER``.

Two small changes allow deployment via Fabric from Windows: * Use ``posixpath.join`` instead of ``os.path.join`` to construct all paths destined for the remote machine. * Check for ``\"fab-file.py\"`` as well as \"fab\" in ``sys.argv``, to handle the way setuptools-generated command-line scripts work in Windows - Alex Hill\n  * Fix urlpattern for archive year - Stephen McDonald\n  * Hide printing ``STATIC_ROOT`` in deploys - Stephen McDonald\n  * Added paragraph to ``mezzanine/docs/user-accounts.rst`` about ``ACCOUNTS_NO_USERNAME``. setting - Alexandre Hajjar\n  * Used ``username_label`` variable in the PasswordResetForm label. ``(accounts/forms.py)`` - Alexandre Hajjar\n  * Pin html5lib, see ``https://github.com/jsocol/bleach/issues/94`` - Stephen McDonald\n  * Added an extra safeguard for type errors in editable settings - Stephen McDonald\n\nVersion 1.4.6 (Apr 27, 2013)\n----------------------------\n\n  * Fix ``set_dynamic_settings`` for projects without ``AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS`` defined - Stephen McDonald\n  * Provide meaningful exception when dotted import fails - Sam Kingston\n  * SS: Line 12 ``dsq.src`` changed to include https if the site is runnning on SSL. Comments do not appear if the site is running on SSL and js link is http - Sachin Shende\n  * Adding Golds Gym Utah - Josh Batchelor\n  * If ``static_directory`` does not exist, create it. Instead of trying to tar the static directory (which. fails when the dir does not exist), we create it when. is missing - José Aliste\n  * Hack for generic fields that allows MySQL migrations to run correctly - Stephen McDonald\n  * Don't assume a site exists in some older migrations - Stephen McDonald\n  * Use consistent language for 'log in / sign up' - Stephen McDonald\n  * The ``db_type`` field must take a second 'connection' argument, even though unused, otherwise one gets an 'unexpected keyword argument connection' TypeError - Marcos Scriven\n  * Added a port of Django's RedirectFallbackMiddleware with support for Mezzanine's multi-site handling.

Closes #561 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fix CSRF token generation when cache is enabled, should solve #632 - Gu1\n  * Be more explicit in checking for a test run management command - Stephen McDonald\n  * Add missing reference for link - Thibault J.\n  * Fix ``SearchableManager._search_fields`` incorrectly persisting across managers for model subclasses. Closes #633 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Add code of conduct - Ken Bolton\n  * New mezzanine-file-collections reference. mezzanine-media-library got renamed to mezzanine-file-collections. The reference was updated in this commit - Thibault J.\n  * Added the bool setting ``ACCOUNTS_APPROVAL_REQUIRED``, which defaults to False and when set to True, sets newly created public user accounts to inactivate, requiring activation by a staff member. Also added the setting ``ACCOUNTS_APPROVAL_EMAILS`` which can contain a comma separated string of email addresses to send notification emails to each time a new account is created and requires activation. Closes #417 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Document the new account approval feature - Stephen McDonald\n  * Better name for ``emails_list`` -> ``split_addresses`` - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fix thumbnail template tag for palette-mode images.

This fix adds proper handling of generic-protocol hostnames to the ``static_proxy`` view - Gabe Smedresman\n  * Reorder blog and accounts patterns in ``mezzanine.urls`` to allow for projects with a blog homepage that also have accounts enabled - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fix handling of paths in zip imports in galleries app - Stephen McDonald\n  * accounts: properly reject multiple matching e-mail addresses. Django allows multiple Users with the same e-mail address; the existing. form can throw MultipleObjectsReturned when get(email=email) is called. against such a dataset - mike wakerly\n  * Added default wsgi script to project template - Stephen McDonald\n  * Only add input-xlarge on inputs without a class attribute, fixes #643 - Gu1\n  * Replaced the ``BLOG_URLS_USE_DATE`` setting with a new ``BLOG_URLS_DATE_FORMAT`` setting - it can contain the string year, month, or day, which controls the date granularity in blog post URLs - Stephen McDonald\n  * Editable settings refactor - this change is to clear up confusion around editable settings being defined in a project's settings module. Previously when this happened, the ``settings.py`` module value would only serve as a default, which would be superceded by the db editable value as soon as the settings admin form is first saved. To address this, this change means that editable settings defined in the project's ``settings.py`` module now mark the setting as not editable, so it will always be the value used. We also include some handling for the migration case so that even with this change, editable settings already in the db that have a ``settings.py`` value defined will still use the db value and provide a warning - Stephen McDonald\n  * Revert the handling for still using db values for editable settings with ``settings.py`` values defined, since it basically defeats the purpose if a ``settings.py`` value is added once a project is live - Stephen McDonald\n  * New ``INLINE_EDITING_ENABLED`` setting doesn't need to be editable - Stephen McDonald\n  * Don't force lowercase keywords. Closes #647 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Allow blog feed title and description to be overridden - Stephen McDonald\n  * Use callable description in atom rss feed - Stephen McDonald\n  * Properly escape comments in ``comment_filter`` template tag - Stephen McDonald\n\nVersion 1.4.5 (Apr 02, 2013)\n----------------------------\n\n  * Fix some static urls in admin to support external storage backends - Stephen McDonald\n\nVersion 1.4.4 (Mar 30, 2013)\n----------------------------\n\n  * Added user FK to rating model, and allow authenticated users to edit their ratings. Added new setting ``RATINGS_ACCOUNT_REQUIRED`` to allow ratings to behave like comments, where requiring authentication can store post data in session until user logs in to complete the rating - Stephen McDonald\n  * If RichTextPage is unregistered in the admin, have the page add link in the dashboard go to the page tree - Stephen McDonald\n  * Let's go back to a fixed-width navbar - Stephen McDonald\n  * Give the navbar some more space - Stephen McDonald\n  * Docs for using the Media Library browse dialog in custom widgets - Ahmad Khayyat\n  * Added the ``ADD_PAGE_ORDER`` setting, which is a sequence of ``app_label.object_name`` values of Page subclasses, for defining the ordering used in the add drop-down on the admin page tree - Stephen McDonald\n  * Use CSS instead of JavaScript for the admin app dropdowns. There were some bugs with the dropdowns when they were in JavaScript: 1. When you open a dropdown and then scroll, the dropdown would stay. put, instead of following the scroll. 2. The JavaScript used `.live('mouseover')` which binds to body and. wastes memory because it's fired for mouseover on every single DOM. element. 3. Occasionally, the dropdowns never disappeared even after mouseout. This commit fixes those bugs by using CSS and `:hover` instead of. JavaScript. Additionally, it simplifies the JavaScript related to. setting the href of the primary menu item links to their first child. It is a pixel for pixel match of the previous functionality and. appearance - Rocky Meza\n  * Update to bootstrap 2.3.1 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Use Django's ``module_has_submodule`` util in any module autodiscover scenarios (page processors, conf defaults) so we can correctly propagate real errors - Stephen McDonald\n  * Tighten up the search form css a bit - Stephen McDonald\n  * Remove the model graph FAQ since no one's actually ever asked it - Stephen McDonald\n  * New docs sesction, Utilities, covering the models/fields in ``mezzanine.generic``, as well as some of the more useful template tags in ``mezzanine_tags`` - Stephen McDonald\n  * Django 1.5 url compatability - pahaz\n  * Use future lib in form entries template for backward compat - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fix search form HTML - Stephen McDonald\n  * Add ``JQUERY_UI_FILENAME`` setting and corresponding docs - Ahmad Khayyat\n  * Fix rating field lookups - Stephen McDonald\n  * Added domain to cache key for site ID caching - Stephen McDonald\n  * Added some JS to the default front-end templates that delays closing of dropdown menus in the primary nav to make them more user friendly. Closes #587 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Added the setting ``BLOG_RSS_LIMIT`` defaulting to 20, which limits the number of blog posts shown in the RSS feed - Stephen McDonald\n  * Update ``BLOG_RSS_LIMIT`` setting description to describe setting it to None for no limit - Stephen McDonald\n  * Make ``BLOG_RSS_LIMIT`` setting not editable - Stephen McDonald\n  * A little late here, but fix Django 1.3 support - Stephen McDonald\n  * Provide a default ``max_length`` for FileBrowseField - Stephen McDonald\n  * Added a website powered by Mezzanine - poptosic\n  * Better comment button text - Stephen McDonald\n  * Unicode fix for comment emails - Stephen McDonald\n  * Don't show site selection form when there's only one site. If there's only a single site, there's no need to show this form,. because it can't do anything - Gavin Wahl\n  * Only show one reply form at a time in a comment thread - Stephen McDonald\n  * Configurable page var names in pagination querystrings - Stephen McDonald\n  * Pin max Django version to 1.5.x - Stephen McDonald\n  * RTL: adjust admin navbar thickness after the js->css change - Ahmad Khayyat\n  * Provide optional template for user panel in nav - Stephen McDonald\n  * RTL: fix position of help icon in ``filter_horizontal`` m2m widget - Ahmad Khayyat\n  * Remove content from DisplayableAdmin's ``search_fields`` since content is not defined on Displayable and may or may not be present on a model that subclasses it and uses the DisplayableAdmin - Josh Cartmell\n  * Clean up nav version of user panel - Stephen McDonald\n  * Don't strip any HTML in TinyMCE since filtering is handled by bleach - Stephen McDonald\n  * 569 - replace uses of ``STATIC_URL`` in templates with 'static' template tag - endophage\n  * site is never assigned when hostname is set, single line addition fixes the problem - endophage\n  * Don't depend on unloaded comment state for determining parent-most level of replies in ``comment_thread`` template tag - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fix KeywordsField swapping of name in model's ``search_fields`` when a sequence is used - Stephen McDonald\n  * Moved the logic for building up search fields in SearchableQueryset into a new method ``SearchableManager.get_search_fields``, which allows externally retrieving the search fields dict that will be used - Stephen McDonald\n  * Use model's ``search_fields`` to populate ``DisplayableAdmin.search_fields`` - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fix use of ``JQUERY_FILENAME`` with static template tag - Stephen McDonald\n  * Add compress tags to js/css in base mobile template - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fix empty thumbnails for fielbrowser fields in AdminThumbMixin - Stephen McDonald\n  * Added AJAX/JSON handling for comment/rating login redirects, and comment form errors - Stephen McDonald\n  * Allow migrations and fixtures to run from scratch without ``mezzanine.pages`` installed - Stephen McDonald\n  * Don't update existing ratings if their values haven't changed - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fix dot lookup in template settings - Stephen McDonald\n  * Upgrade bitly integration - added new ``BITLY_ACCESS_CODE`` setting to replace the old api settings - Stephen McDonald\n  * Upgrade ``select_related`` call in ``recent_comments`` template tag - Stephen McDonald\n  * Remove all use of ``django.conf.urls.defaults`` since we don't support Django 1.3 anymore.

(assuming that ``InlineAdmin.fields`` is a user-provided list) - wrwrwr\n  * Mezzanine's auth backend incompatible with custom user model tests in Django 1.5 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Added Django 1.5 to travis config - Stephen McDonald\n  * Add a fallback for the newly required ``ALLOWED_HOSTS`` setting in Django 1.5, that will use the domains defined in the Site model - Stephen McDonald\n  * Use the string name for user relationships in models since trying to import a custom user model falls apart - Stephen McDonald\n  * Remove upgrade flag from installation instructions in case people don't know how pip works - Stephen McDonald\n  * Drop Python 2.5 tests in travis since Django 1.5 doesn't support it and we'll be dropping it soon - Stephen McDonald\n\nVersion 1.4.2 (Feb 23, 2013)\n----------------------------\n\n  * Added ratings to comments, with new settings ``COMMENTS_USE_RATINGS`` for toggle ratings form in comments, and ``RATINGS_RANGE`` for defining valid ratings, replacing the old min/max settings. Also added ``_sum`` field injections for models with rating fields, and ``rating_date`` field on ratings, for use with time scaled scores - Stephen McDonald\n  * Ensure emails are lowercased for gravatar hashes - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fix page tree admin template when reversion is used - Stephen McDonald\n  * Enhanced args to gravatar URLs - Stephen McDonald\n\nVersion 1.4.1 (Feb 19, 2013)\n----------------------------\n\n  * Remove unnecessary permission from ``live_settings`` module. Closes #568 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Test slug after setting parent of an unsaved page with autogenerated slug - wrwrwr\n  * Bum ``filebroswer_safe`` to 0.2.16 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Prefix ``BLOG_USE_FEATURED_IMAGE`` in blog templates with ``settings.``, otherwise it always evalutes to False - Josh Cartmell\n\nVersion 1.4.0 (Feb 17, 2013)\n----------------------------\n\n  * Added a ``has_home`` variable to templates for the ``page_menu`` template tag, which indicates whether a homepage object exists, and can be used for checking whether a hard-coded homepage link should exist in the menu template - Stephen McDonald\n  * Update the default twitter query since it's been flooded by movie tweets - Stephen McDonald\n  * Add a deprecation layer for settings in templates, and deprecate the ``PAGES_MENU_SHOW_ALL`` setting since it's too specific for a setting and can be implemented in one line in a template - Stephen McDonald\n  * Added an example to the page menu docs of rendering a tree representing the current section of a site being viewed - Stephen McDonald\n  * Don't need to uncheck ``in_menus`` for an editable homepage anymore, so remove the comment describing that - Stephen McDonald\n  * Correctly handle file uploads in profile forms - Stephen McDonald\n  * Alpha-sort options for the search form - Stephen McDonald\n  * Remove Nimbis Services link for now. We haven't deployed our Mezzanine-based Nimbis Services site. into production yet (the old link was to a testing site that is only. used internally). We'll add this back in once we go live with our Mezzanine site - Lorin Hochstein\n  * Also check ``BLOG_USE_FEATURED_IMAGE`` in templates when displaying blog post's featured image - Stephen McDonald\n  * Added a ``sort_by`` template filter for general use - Stephen McDonald\n  * Removed ``Slugged.Meta.ordering`` since it'll generally always be nuked by Meta on a subclass - and added correct ordering to BlogCategory - Stephen McDonald\n  * Move ``clean_content`` to new DisplayableAdminForm - Alex Hill\n  * Fix parent of Team and History pages in fixtures. Assign the Team and History pages to the About page (id 2) instead of the Blog page (id 1) in Page fixtures - Alex Hill\n  * Fix generating descriptions when saving page instances directly, as their content type subclass fields weren't available for the description - Stephen McDonald\n  * Allow for no content model in ``Page.description_from_content`` - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fixed duplicate home IDs in menu templates and add some missing IDs - Stephen McDonald\n  * Check ``has_home`` to avoid duplicates. Updated ``footer_tree.html`` to behave the same as the other menu templates, checking ``has_home`` so that a page that is also the home doesn't end up in the menus twice - joshcartme\n  * Strip language prefix from request path, before trying to match it against pages slugs - wrwrwr\n  * Drupal blog importer for mezzanine blog - #issue 527 - Bryden Frizzell\n  * Fixed ``import_posterous`` for module requests ``v1.0.1`` and above. - issue #528 - Skooch\n  * Restore permission check for editable JS/CSS - Stephen McDonald\n  * Added handling for model field defaults in dynamic inlines. Closes #526 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Precedence of conflicting page processor context. The order of execution of page processors was reversed in #315 so that custom page processors returning an HttpResponse would bypass the default processors. That had the side-effect of making context variables in default processors overwrite those in custom processors, which isn't very intuitive. This change restores the original behaviour of context variables, while retaining the reversed execution order - Alex Hill\n  * Added a welcome message and quick links for getting started, for new developers, to the default homepage template - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fixed conditional context updates in page processors for Python < 2.7 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fix handling of non-alpha search terms in SearchableQuerySet - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fixed support for automatically adding custom ManyToMany fields in PageAdmin.

Django forces fields defaults to unicode unless they're callable (see ``Field.get_default``). This is done to prevent problems that could arise from setting the same mutable object as a default for many fields (see Django ticket #18478) - wrwrwr\n  * add fa and ``fa_IR`` locales - Mahdi Bornazadeh\n  * Clean up use of ``AUTH_USER_MODEL`` - Stephen McDonald\n  * Database-prepare tuples in the same way lists are handled in ``MultiChoiceField`` - wrwrwr\n  * Allow pages to be dragged out of a subtree to the root level in page admin - wrwrwr\n  * Check that setting a new page parent won't cause a cycle in the parent-child graph. Such cycles lead to an infinite loop in ``Page.save`` ``(e.g``. python process consuming all resources) - wrwrwr\n  * Altered git ``repo_url`` checks to allow ssh hosted git repositories - Travis Nickles\n  * Fixed indentation issue and PEP-8 issue with fabfile mods - Travis Nickles\n  * Don't try to create any pages if the models it uses aren't installed - Gavin Wahl\n  * Support for Django 1.5 custom user models. Uses ``get_user_model`` for every reference to User, and provides a default. implementation of ``get_user_model`` for Django <= 1.4 - Gavin Wahl\n  * Clean up hg/git checks in fabfile - Stephen McDonald\n  * Move RSS url parsing code from the drupal importer into the main RSS blog importer, and remove the drupal importer since it isn't specific to drupal - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fix import error message in rss importer - Stephen McDonald\n  * Don't use Bootstrap's navbar-inverse class by default, for better theme compatibility. Closes #551 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fix some missing imports and settings import errors for the new user model hooks - Stephen McDonald\n  * Added possibility to set custom menu titles for models in ``ADMIN_MENU_ORDER``, using the same notation as for views ``(e.g``. ``(_(\"News\")``, ``\"blog.BlogPost\"))`` - wrwrwr\n  * Avoid fixing parent slug in ``Page.set_parent`` if the page had no slug to start with - wrwrwr\n  * Use ``current_page`` instead of request for ``is_current``. Since we already have the 'current page' object, we can compare it. against ourself to find if we are current - Gavin Wahl\n  * Replace the rating form with a message after user casts a vote - wrwrwr\n  * Use ``content_model`` not the base Page in PageAdmin. When calling methods on a page, they should be called on the subclass,. not the base Page. This allows page types to override them - Gavin Wahl\n  * The usage of reversion can now be disabled for DisplayableAdmin - uli\n  * Update admin menu docs to mention labels for regaulr models - Stephen McDonald\n  * Change new reversion setting to be opt-in instead of opt-out - Stephen McDonald\n  * Moved the ``MEDIA_LIBRARY_PER_SITE`` setting from ``filebrowser_safe`` into Mezzanine so it's documented. It allows per-site filebrowser root directories - Stephen McDonald\n\nVersion 1.3.0 (Dec 26, 2012)\n----------------------------\n\n  * added dob field to list of form fields - mmuk2\n  * Update url templatetags for Django 1.5. See ``https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/releases/1.3/#changes-to-url-and-ssi``. \"{% load url from future %}\" is omitted in favour of a global import in. ``boot/__init__.py`` - Alex Hill\n  * Bring templates in line with latest master - Alex Hill\n  * Move forward compatibility code to ``utils/conf.py`` - Alex Hill\n  * Assume development server if command is \"harvest\". Lettuce uses the \"harvest\" command to run a development server. See ``http://lettuce.it/recipes/django-lxml.html#lettuce-run-the-tests``. Note that if this isn't set, then media will not be served correctly. when testing with lettuce - Lorin Hochstein\n  * Bump versions: ``filebrowser_safe`` >= 0.2.12, ``grappelli_safe`` >= 0.2.10 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Use non-minified ``jquery.tools`` and ``jquery.ba-resize`` - Per Andersson\n  * Render admin \"add\" link if no change permission. Handle the case where a non-superuser staff member has \"add\". permission but not \"change\" permission - Lorin Hochstein\n  * Escape backticks in python task in fabfile. Closes #396 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Ensure last output line is used to determine remote ``STATIC_URL`` in fabfile, since warnings may occur in output - Stephen McDonald\n  * add ``related_posts`` for blog - Dmitry Falk\n  * fix ``related_posts`` in template - Dmitry Falk\n  * Allow users to sign up with capital letters in their username - David Novakovic\n  * Update ``mezzanine/core/admin.py``. Add some stuff to OwnableAdmin to make its use more obvious to new users - David Novakovic\n  * Filter urls that use https - Eduardo Rivas\n  * Added mezzanine-polls to third party apps - Stephen McDonald\n  * Update ``mezzanine/accounts/__init__.py``. Display more informative error if this exception is thrown. This exception handler can hide informative errors about model unrelated model declaration. - David Novakovic\n  * Update ``mezzanine/accounts/__init__.py``. Even better checks for the profile model string - David Novakovic\n  * Fix unfiltered RSS feeds for Django 1.3 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Use tag slugs for tag RSS feeds - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fix unicode handling for slugs in Django 1.5 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fix urls in mobile search include for Django 1.5 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fix mobile tests for Django 1.5 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Handle invalid images in thumbnail tag. Closes #410 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Use Page URLs without trailing slash when ``settings.APPEND_SLASH`` is False - Kenneth Falck\n  * Full support for ``APPEND_SLASH`` is False - Stephen McDonald\n  * Removing initial content from createdb when --nodata parameter is present - Sean Voss\n  * Added ``TWITTER_STRIP_HIGH_MULTIBYTE`` setting to strip mb3/mb4 characters in Tweets (mainly Emoji), which cause problems with MySQL UTF-8 collation - Kenneth Falck\n  * Added the setting ``SSL_FORCED_PREFIXES_ONLY``, which defaults to True and controls whether URLs not matched by ``SSL_FORCE_URL_PREFIXES`` are redirected back to HTTP if accessed over HTTPS - Stephen McDonald\n  * Added the ``COMMENT_FILTER`` setting for controlling how comments are rendered. Works the same as the ``RICHTEXT_FILTER`` setting. Closes #416 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Added ``has_children_in_menu`` and ``num_children_in_menu`` attributes to page objects in the ``page_menu`` template tag, for determining valid children in the context of a menu and the ``in_emnus`` field.

Closes #429 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Make form fixtures optional and remove old fixtures - Stephen McDonald\n  * Use createdb --nodata in fabfile - Stephen McDonald\n  * Use actual keyword instances in blog listing. Closes #431 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Put block tags into all blog templates so they can be overridden. Closes #443. This resulted in the splitting of the editable field for the title and. publication date in the list page into two editable fields, so they. could be two separate blocks. I notice that the blog detail page. doesn't have an editable field for the publish date at all, which I. shall address separately. block tags are namespaced by ``blog_post_detail_`` and ``blog_post_list_``. respectively, and inside the list page, the blocks related to an. individual post are namespaced with ``blog_post_list_post_`` - Penny Leach\n  * Made publication date an editable field in the blog post detail template - Penny Leach\n  * Remove selection disabling in ``page_tree.js`` - causing issues with latest Firefox - Stephen McDonald\n  * Added some missing calls to ``richtext_filter``. Closes #438 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Correctly handle empty password in login form. Closes #439 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Move error templates into custom paths so that Django's tests can trigger errors using its own error templates, since Mezzanine's urlpatterns aren't used which its error templates depend on - Stephen McDonald\n  * Add some extra comments and validation for the new ``FORMS_EXTRA_FIELDS`` setting - Stephen McDonald\n  * Allow LoginForm to be inherited and extended - Renyi Khor\n  * Slugged model now uses ``self.title`` to generate slug. Fixes #445 - Andrey Shipilov\n  * Update ``mezzanine/blog/models.py``. wrong keyword argument passed to ``blog_post_list_category`` in ``get_absolute_url`` for the BlogCategory model. This results in an empty url when using <a hreg=\"{{ ``category.get_absolute_url`` }}\">Link to my Category</a>. The problem was that the ``blog/urls.py`` uses 'category' as the keyword and the ``get_absolute_url`` used 'slug' as the keyword. I changed it within ``get_absolute_url`` because I guess changing it within ``blog/urls.py`` may break backwards compatibility - Andre Graf\n  * Port gallery expose to updated jquerytools version. On overlay load, expose the ``.image-overlay``. Fixes bug where every other image was not exposed due to timing issue. when #exposeMask fades out when already switched to next image - Per Andersson\n  * Use local copies of instead of cdn. * html5shiv. * jquery mobile - Per Andersson\n  * Move ``html5shiv.js`` outside of Mezzanine's js directory, since it's not required by Mezzanine itself (eg it's project specific and can be removed per project) - Stephen McDonald\n  * Update ``blog_recent_posts`` to allow an optional slug. If the slug is specified returned blog posts will be restricted to being in the category matching the slug. If the slug does not match a category, posts will be returned as normal - joshcartme\n  * Added support for keyword args in the ``as_tag`` template tag wrapper - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fix for issue #450: ``home_slug`` with prefix - uli\n  * Fix bad semicolon in ``gallery.js`` - Stephen McDonald\n  * Use ``PROJECT_NAME`` fabric setting as ``CACHE_MIDDLEWARE_KEY_PREFIX`` in ``live_settings.py`` - Stephen McDonald\n  * Update twitter bootstrap to ``v2.2.1`` - Ivan Teoh\n  * Inverse the top navbar from white to black - Ivan Teoh\n  * Superusers should be able to select any site - Josh Cartmell\n  * Disable front end editing for users who don't have access to a site - Josh Cartmell\n  * Include AdminProfileInline so that it is not lost if the user enables Mezzanine accounts - Josh Cartmell\n  * Check if the user ``is_staff`` first to avoid unecessarily reversing admin:index on every request - Josh Cartmell\n  * Only load and display inline editor if the user has access to the current site's admin - Josh Cartmell\n  * Only check if a user has access to the current site in the middleware. Save the result on ``request.user`` and use this elsewhere - Josh Cartmell\n  * Added the setting ``OWNABLE_MODELS_ALL_EDITABLE`` which allows a sequence of ``app_label.model_name`` models to be defined, that are Ownable subclasses which won't have their change-list admin views filtered by user - Stephen McDonald\n  * Updated signal to only automatically create admin profiles for staff and not break the User add view if a site is selected - Josh Cartmell\n  * Fix for issue #470: Right subclass instance in BaseGenericRelation - Thomas Jetzinger\n  * Add homepage url to ``sitemap.xml`` - Stephen McDonald\n  * Add handling for multi-tenancy in ``sitemap.xml`` - Stephen McDonald\n  * Check for published objects in ``Orderable.next/previous`` and allow kwargs to be used - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fixed margins on user-panel buttons - Stephen McDonald\n  * Added Displayable methods ``get_next/previous_by_publish_date``, and used in blog post templates for next/previous blog posts - Stephen McDonald\n  * More accurate template block name for blog post prev/next links - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fix showstopper on first comment due to url being clobbered and never reset - Grant Warren-Robertson\n  * No need to log user out for invalid admin - Stephen McDonald\n  * Check for login form instead of user perms when choosing which js to load in admin's base template - Stephen McDonald\n  * Still log user out for invalid admin access - Stephen McDonald\n  * add environment setting to ``supervisor.conf`` to ensure locale is set correctly for gunicorn subprocesses - Doug Evenhouse\n  * modify environment setting to inject locale specified in FABRIC setting - Doug Evenhouse\n  * Allows regular link Cmd+Click behaviour on OS X. - Regular click behaviour still applies. - Tested to work in OS X Chrome 24 beta and Firefox 16 beta. - TODO: test on other platforms - Matt Stevenson\n  * Document how to run unit tests - Lorin Hochstein\n  * Don't run view functions from page middleware when no page can be found, just pass through. Closes #476 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Update jquery-ui to full 1.9.1, and include smoothness theme. This allows other apps to use a single version of jquery-ui that is. known to be compatible with Mezzanine's version of jquery. This is ``jquery-ui-1.9.1.all``, so all widgets are available and no. additional jquery code is needed. Also, the full smoothness theme. is included. Third-party apps may include other themes - Ahmad Khayyat\n  * Added Django < 1.5's adminmedia tag lib for 1.5 compatibility - Stephen McDonald\n  * Clean up dev server check - Stephen McDonald\n  * Allow category/tag titles to be used in ``blog_post_recent`` tag - Stephen McDonald\n  * Bump grappelli safe version to 0.2.11 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Bump filebrowser safe version to 0.2.13 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Added the setting ``UPLOAD_TO_HANDLERS`` for configuring the ``upload_to`` arg per file field.

Remove a blank line so tests will pass - Kenneth Love\n  * Don't assume {form, gallery} apps are installed.

Instead, import them in the function where they're. used - Gavin Wahl\n  * Adds the ability to move a page under a page with no children. I switched to using the jQuery nestedSortable plugin instead of the. sortable plugin provided by jQuery UI, because Pages actually being in a. tree structure, they need a tree editor. This commit temporarily breaks. some functionality such as remembering which pages were open and closed - Rocky Meza\n  * fixed pagetree hiding of subpages - Rocky Meza\n  * Provide Mezzanine's settings object to the ``COMPRESS_OFFLINE_CONTEXT`` setting for django-compressor. Closes #505 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fix the bugs that we had with nestedSortable - Gavin Wahl\n  * only ``.nestedSortable()`` the first ol - Gavin Wahl\n  * Fix front-end editing links for elements not positioned relative to the document. Use visibility hidden and jquery offset function to ensure edit links are always positioned relative to the document and not relative to a positioned ancestor - Jonathan Potter\n  * Clean up the new page sorting view - Stephen McDonald\n  * Remove old hack for initial page tree click bug that no longer exists. Closes #509 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fix null handling in page sorting view - Stephen McDonald\n  * Specify widget for keywords field so it can be overridden properly. Closes #421 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Bug fix for wrong argument ordering for ssl cert handling in ``fabfile.py`` - David Hess\n  * Remove some commented out editable settings from the project template's ``settings.py`` module, since defining these at the Python level can be confusing once the settings form in the admin is updated. Also made a note of this scenario in the settings docs. Closes #515 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Add ssl port to ``nginx.conf``. Closes #514 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Bump filebrowser-safe version to 0.2.14 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Don't run redirects tests for Django 1.5 - Stephen McDonald\n  * More commit log filtering for changelog - Stephen McDonald\n\nVersion 1.2.4 (Sep 03, 2012)\n----------------------------\n\n  * Added ``mezzanine.utils.urls.home_slug`` which will return the ``slug` arg of the ``home`` urlpattern, when a urlpattern is defined for an edtiable homepage.

Allows for things like blog posts and Cartridge products to contain a direct admin link from the ditable toolbar - Stephen McDonald\n  * Remove unused ``grappelli_safe`` urlpatterns - Stephen McDonald\n  * Bump ``grappelli_safe`` version to 0.2.9 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Added accessor methods for blog post keywords and categories, so that when we use ``prefetch_related`` with Django >= 1.4 we don't need to iterate through every blog post to set up keywords and categories. Closes #383 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Use the named home url for the View site link in the admin header. Closes #389 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Ensure consistent path separators in overextends template tag on Windows.

It might happen that pages are listed multiple times since for. instance a RichTextPage is also a Page and both are subclasses. of Displayable - Enrico Tröger\n  * Redirect the /account/ URL to the profile update form, and the /users/ URL to the logged in user's profile. Closes #291 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Clean up sitemap URL handling - Stephen McDonald\n  * Use ``publish_date`` for BlogPosts in ``/sitemap.xml`` - Enrico Tröger\n  * ``FORMS_USE_HTML5`` is a core setting - Stephen McDonald\n  * Allow page objects with removed apps to still render - Stephen McDonald\n  * Ensure mezzanine's apps have their settings loaded before any others - Stephen McDonald\n  * fix utils if ``mezzanine.accounts`` not installed - Dmitry Falk\n  * Fix reference to richtext filter settings defaults which are now in ``mezzanine.core`` - Stephen McDonald\n  * Fix serialization of ``Page.in_menus`` fields for dumpdata command.

Old code did not detect the slug appropriatley forcing you to make the slug / in the admin area - James Page\n  * Make some template tags more robust ``(keywords_for`` and editable) by failing silently when given an empty variable, as the case may be in the blog templates when no blog page object exists, so we don't need to check for this case in the templates themselves - Stephen McDonald\n  * In the overextends template tag, only remove template paths from the list of available paths when the first call to ``find_template`` is made in each call to ``get_parent``, otherwise every second parent template found is skipped - Stephen McDonald\n  * Bump ``filebrowser_safe`` to 0.2.9 - Stephen McDonald\n  * Switch page processor execution order so custom slug processors are executed before model processors - Hakan Bakkalbasi\n  * Change ``@processor_for`` registration logic so most recently registered page processors are run first - Hakan Bakkalbasi\n  * For custom hompegae slug lookup in PageMiddleware, fix missing import and only call resolve once - Stephen McDonald\n  * Hash cache keys when talking directly to the cache API, to avoid keys longer than the backend supports (eg memcache limit is 255) - Stephen McDonald\n  * overextends tag path fix for uwsgi - Stephen McDonald\n  * Added new optional field ``MetaData._meta_title`` for overriding HTML title tag value, accessible via ``MetaData.meta_title``, which will return the string version of an instance of ``_meta_title`` is not provided - Stephen McDonald\n  * Add parent hierarchy to page template rendering - Ken Bolton\n  * Added rollback command for deploys - Stephen McDonald\n  * Only pip install requirements if the requirements file has changed - Stephen McDonald\n  * Use ``file.url`` instead of ``file.path`` to auto-generate descriptions for gallery image, as remote storage backends such as S3BotoStorage do not support the ``file.path`` method - Hakan Bakkalbasi\n  * Added Django's tz context processor to ``project_template.settings``.

The decorator adds the page instance to the template context, and handles login redirects if ``page.login_required`` is True. Applied to the blog views, and also added handling for ``login_required`` on the blog page in the blog feeds, which if True, stops the feeds from producing any blog posts or meta data - Stephen McDonald\n  * Don't disconnect the default site signal if we're not connecting our own one - Stephen McDonald\n  * Only try and modify template lists when they're available - not the case when the response is pulled from cache - Stephen McDonald\n  * Added the ifisinstalled template tag to replace the ``is_installed`` template filter, which properly handles include tags when the given app is not installed.

The problem occured when reloading a page after setting an open child branch's. parent as closed. When you reloaded a page the routine that would. reopen previously opened child branches (that are currently hidden by a parent). was causing said child branch displaying both the show(+) and hide(-). icons side by side which could be seen when reopening the parent. It would also cause this said hidden, opened child branch. to no longer be registered in the opened branch cookie. So if you were to. reload the page again, this branch wouldn't be opened at all. The solution involves simply reopening all previously opened branches on. reload without worrying about adding their ID's again to the cookie.

Also cleaned up some enumeration stuff and making the tags code into a list comprehension - ajfisher\n  * added some graceful exit handling if the gdata library isn't available - ajfisher\n  * streamlined tag stuff to use a list comprehension - ajfisher\n  * Replace the approach of calling ``mezzanine.conf.load_settings`` to create new instances of settings objects with a single instance via ``mezzanine.conf.settings`` that contains a method ``use_editable`` which when called will mark the settings object for reloading settings from the db - stephenmcd\n  * Refactor settings loading to reload settings when ``use_editable`` called - stephenmcd\n  * Remove unused func ``editable_settings`` - stephenmcd\n  * Explicitly evaluate the results for blog template tags so that queries are only executed once - stephenmcd\n  * Replace ``load_settings`` template tag with a context processor for a global settings object - stephenmcd\n  * Remove the ``SETTINGS_EDITABLE`` setting and check for ``mezzanine.conf`` in installed apps - stephenmcd\n  * Remove the ``MEZZANINE_`` prefix from checking project's settings for default values, since non-mezzanine apps may register settings themselves - stephenmcd\n  * Group the form fields for editable settings by prefix - stephenmcd\n  * Update documentation to reflect refactoring of the conf app - stephenmcd\n  * Allow the ``BlogCategoryAdmin`` to be displayed in the admin menu when explicitly defined in ``ADMIN_MENU_ORDER`` - stephenmcd\n\nVersion 0.8.4 (Sep 30, 2010)\n----------------------------\n\n  * Fix PostgreSQL error on tweet lookup - stephenmcd\n  * Use dynamically generated intro for posts in blog listing page rather than the description field - stephenmcd\n\nVersion 0.8.3 (Sep 29, 2010)\n----------------------------\n\n  * Workaround for when mezzanine is hosted under a different urlspace. (Only tested with Django admin, not grappelli). The ``keywords.js`` file needs to reference a mezzanine URL, from the admin site. It used to use a hard-coded string with a root-absolute path, but this failed when mezzanine was hosted elsewhere. Instead, we now reference a global Mezzanine JS object, which is set by template, using URL reversal to find the correct url. This requires a reworking in how the PageAdmin object accesses its Media settings - previously the list of js files was calculated at module load time, but at this stage the url reversal mechanism won't work, because the ``urls.py`` aren't all loaded yet, Instead, we hide the list generation inside a lazy iterator object and create the list on demand - Toby White\n  * Fix admin menu for earlier than Python 2.6 which lacks ``tuple.index`` - stephenmcd\n  * add active class to footer menu - lexual\n  * Don't fail if ``PACKAGE_NAME_FILEBROWSER`` or ``PACKAGE_NAME_GRAPELLI`` aren't set - just don't try & load them - Toby White\n  * Fix grappelli/filebrowser package creation scripts to be Python 2.5 compatible. Closes #12 - stephenmcd\n  * Create a template tag for reversing urls from within admin templates that fail silently when the url can't be reversed, as this is always the case when running admin tests. Apply this to both the admin dropdown menu and to the base admin template making all templates aware of the ``admin_keyword_submit`` URL so that it does not need to be hard-coded - stephenmcd\n  * Backed out changeset: d43f3e430d1f - stephenmcd\n  * Replace MobileTemplate middleware with a decorator. If mezzanine is being used as an application within another project, then the MobileTemplate middleware may not be appropriate to use on URLs outside of mezzanine's control. In fact, if the project uses other calling conventions (eg class-based views) then the middleware may fail completely - Toby White\n  * Fix positioning of admin dropdown menu in Firefox. Closes #11 - stephenmcd\n  * Let the location of the tinymce scripts be overridden - Toby White\n  * Give the Page object a ``get_admin_url`` property, which we can use to provide direct links to a Page's admin page from the editable toolbar - Toby White\n  * add id's to tree-menu, fix bug with multiple \"first\" class being set - lexual\n  * Add a filtering form for exporting responses in the forms app - stephenmcd\n  * Add ``branch_level`` and ``html_id`` attributes to pages in menu template tags - stephenmcd\n  * Add ``TEST_DATABASE_COLLATION`` for MySQL - stephenmcd\n  * Fix field length of test data - stephenmcd\n  * Remove trailing commas from ``tinymce_setup.js`` that break IE. Fixes #14 - stephenmcd\n\nVersion 0.8.2 (Sep 23, 2010)\n----------------------------\n\n  * Backed out changeset 0e7907eef4fc - lexual\n  * move editable-loader to bottom of template to fix weird webkit layout bug - lexual\n  * 960 stuff into separate files - lexual\n  * custom css in separate files - lexual\n  * Modify absolute ``ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX`` value when using grappelli to read in ip/port from ``sys.argv`` - stephenmcd\n  * Clean up a bunch of dead code.

Built using the `Django`_ framework, Mezzanine provides a\nsimple yet highly extensible architecture that encourages diving in\nand hacking on the code. Mezzanine is `BSD licensed`_ and supported by\na diverse and active community.\n\nIn some ways, Mezzanine resembles tools such as `Wordpress`_,\nproviding an intuitive interface for managing pages, blog posts, form\ndata, store products, and other types of content. But Mezzanine is\nalso different. Unlike many other platforms that make extensive use of\nmodules or reusable applications, Mezzanine provides most of its\nfunctionality by default. This approach yields a more integrated and\nefficient platform.\n\nVisit the `Mezzanine project page`_ to see some of the `great sites\npeople have built using Mezzanine`_.\n\nFeatures\n========\n\nIn addition to the usual features provided by Django such as MVC\narchitecture, ORM, templating, caching and an automatic admin\ninterface, Mezzanine provides the following:\n\n* Hierarchical page navigation\n* Save as draft and preview on site\n* Scheduled publishing\n* Drag-and-drop page ordering\n* WYSIWYG editing\n* `In-line page editing`_\n* Drag-and-drop HTML5 forms builder with CSV export\n* SEO friendly URLs and meta data\n* Ecommerce / Shopping cart module (`Cartridge`_)\n* Configurable `dashboard`_ widgets\n* Blog engine\n* Tagging\n* `Free Themes`_ Marketplace\n* User accounts and profiles with email verification\n* Translated to over 35 languages\n* Sharing via Facebook or Twitter\n* `Multi-lingual sites`_\n* `Custom templates`_ per page or blog post\n* `Twitter Bootstrap`_ integration\n* API for `custom content types`_\n* `Search engine and API`_\n* Seamless integration with third-party Django apps\n* One step migration from other blogging engines\n* `Disqus`_ integration, or built-in threaded comments\n* `Gravatar`_ integration\n* `Google Analytics`_ integration\n* `bit.ly`_ integration\n* `Akismet`_ spam filtering\n* `JVM`_ compatible (via `Jython`_)\n\nThe Mezzanine admin dashboard:\n\n.. image:: http://mezzanine.jupo.org/docs/_images/dashboard.png\n\n\nSupport\n=======\n\nTo **report a security issue**, please send an email privately to\n`core-team@mezzaninecms.com`_. This gives us a chance to fix the issue\nand create an official release prior to the issue being made public.\n\nFor **all other Mezzanine support**, the primary channel is the\n`mezzanine-users`_ mailing list. Questions, comments, issues, feature\nrequests, and all other related discussions should take place here.\n\nIf you're **certain** you've come across a bug, then please use the\n`GitHub issue tracker`_, however it's crucial that enough information\nis provided to reproduce the bug, ideally with a small code sample repo\nwe can simply fork, run, and see the issue with. Other useful\ninformation includes things such as the Python stack trace generated by\nerror pages, as well as other aspects of the development environment\nused, such as operating system, database, and Python version. If\n**you're not sure you've found a reproducible bug**, then please try\nthe mailing list first.\n\nFinally, feel free to drop by the `#mezzanine IRC channel`_ on\n`Freenode`_, for a chat! Lastly, communications in all Mezzanine spaces\nare expected to conform to the `Django Code of Conduct`_.\n\n\nContributing\n============\n\nMezzanine is an open source project managed using both the Git and\nMercurial version control systems.
