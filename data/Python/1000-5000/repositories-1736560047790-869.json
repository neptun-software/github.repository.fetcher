With this package, you can:\n - Be immediately productive with Spark, with no learning curve, if you are already familiar with pandas.\n - Have a single codebase that works both with pandas (tests, smaller datasets) and with Spark (distributed datasets).\n\nWe would love to have you try it and give us feedback, through our [mailing lists](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/koalas-dev) or [GitHub issues](https://github.com/databricks/koalas/issues).\n\nTry the Koalas 10 minutes tutorial on a live Jupyter notebook [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/databricks/koalas/master?filepath=docs%2Fsource%2Fgetting_started%2F10min.ipynb). The initial launch can take up to several minutes.\n\n[![Github Actions](https://github.com/databricks/koalas/workflows/master/badge.svg)](https://github.com/databricks/koalas/actions)\n[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/databricks/koalas/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/databricks/koalas)\n[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/koalas/badge/?version=latest)](https://koalas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)\n[![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/koalas.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/koalas/)\n[![Conda Version](https://img.shields.io/conda/vn/conda-forge/koalas.svg)](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/koalas)\n[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/databricks/koalas/master?filepath=docs%2Fsource%2Fgetting_started%2F10min.ipynb)\n[![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/koalas)](https://pepy.tech/project/koalas)\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\nKoalas can be installed in many ways such as Conda and pip.\n\n```bash\n# Conda\nconda install koalas -c conda-forge\n```\n\n```bash\n# pip\npip install koalas\n```\n\nSee [Installation](https://koalas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/install.html) for more details.\n\nFor Databricks Runtime, Koalas is pre-installed in Databricks Runtime 7.1 and above. Try [Databricks Community Edition](https://community.cloud.databricks.com/) for free. You can also follow these [steps](https://docs.databricks.com/libraries/index.html) to manually install a library on Databricks.\n\nLastly, if your PyArrow version is 0.15+ and your PySpark version is lower than 3.0, it is best for you to set `ARROW_PRE_0_15_IPC_FORMAT` environment variable to `1` manually.\nKoalas will try its best to set it for you but it is impossible to set it if there is a Spark context already launched.\n\nNow you can turn a pandas DataFrame into a Koalas DataFrame that is API-compliant with the former:\n\n```python\nimport databricks.koalas as ks\nimport pandas as pd\n\npdf = pd.DataFrame({'x':range(3), 'y':['a','b','b'], 'z':['a','b','b']})\n\n# Create a Koalas DataFrame from pandas DataFrame\ndf = ks.from_pandas(pdf)\n\n# Rename the columns\ndf.columns = ['x', 'y', 'z1']\n\n# Do some operations in place:\ndf['x2'] = df.x * df.x\n```\n\nFor more details, see [Getting Started](https://koalas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/index.html) and [Dependencies](https://koalas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/install.html#dependencies) in the official documentation.\n\n\n## Contributing Guide\n\nSee [Contributing Guide](https://koalas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/contributing.html) and [Design Principles](https://koalas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/design.html) in the official documentation.\n\n\n## FAQ\n\nSee [FAQ](https://koalas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/faq.html) in the official documentation.\n\n\n## Best Practices\n\nSee [Best Practices](https://koalas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/best_practices.html) in the official documentation.\n\n\n## Koalas Talks and Blogs\n\nSee [Koalas Talks and Blogs](https://koalas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/videos_blogs.html) in the official documentation.\n"
