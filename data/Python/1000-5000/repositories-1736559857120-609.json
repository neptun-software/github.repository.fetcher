Correction\n\n**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed\nunprofessional or unwelcome in the community.\n\n**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing\nclarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the\nbehavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.\n\n### 2. Warning\n\n**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series\nof actions.\n\n**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No\ninteraction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with\nthose enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This\nincludes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels\nlike social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or\npermanent ban.\n\n### 3. Temporary Ban\n\n**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including\nsustained inappropriate behavior.\n\n**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public\ncommunication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or\nprivate interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction\nwith those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.\nViolating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.\n\n### 4. Permanent Ban\n\n**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community\nstandards, including sustained inappropriate behavior,  harassment of an\nindividual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.\n\n**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within\nthe community.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage],\nversion 2.0, available at\nhttps://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html.\n\nCommunity Impact Guidelines were inspired by [Mozilla's code of conduct\nenforcement ladder](https://github.com/mozilla/diversity).\n\n[homepage]: https://www.contributor-covenant.org\n\nFor answers to common questions about this code of conduct, see the FAQ at\nhttps://www.contributor-covenant.org/faq.

[🔥 See Also: GenAD & Vista](#see)\n\n## Highlights <a name=\"high\"></a>\n\n- :oncoming_automobile: **Planning-oriented philosophy**: UniAD is a Unified Autonomous Driving algorithm framework following a planning-oriented philosophy. Instead of standalone modular design and multi-task learning, we cast a series of tasks, including perception, prediction and planning tasks hierarchically.\n- :trophy: **SOTA performance**: All tasks within UniAD achieve SOTA performance, especially prediction and planning (motion: 0.71m minADE, occ: 63.4% IoU, planning: 0.31% avg.Col)\n\n## News <a name=\"news\"></a>\n\n- **`Paper Title Change`**: To avoid confusion with the \"goal-point\" navigation in Robotics, we change the title from \"Goal-oriented\" to \"Planning-oriented\" suggested by Reviewers. Thank you!\n\n- **`Planning Metric`**: Discussion [Ref: https://github.com/OpenDriveLab/UniAD/issues/29]: [Clarification](https://github.com/OpenDriveLab/UniAD/issues/29#issuecomment-1583070151) and [Notice](https://github.com/OpenDriveLab/UniAD/issues/29#issuecomment-1717594344) regarding open-loop planning results comparison.\n\n- **`2024/08/27`** New feature: Implementation for CARLA and closed-loop evaluation on CARLA Leaderboard 2.0 scenarios are available in [Bench2Drive](https://github.com/Thinklab-SJTU/Bench2Drive).\n\n- **`2023/08/03`** Bugfix [[Commit](https://github.com/OpenDriveLab/UniAD/commit/2e1380143d7af7c93bd67725a11d6960fa4347c6)]: Previously, the visualized planning results were in opposition on the x axis, compared to the ground truth. Now it's fixed.\n\n- **`2023/06/12`** Bugfix [Ref: https://github.com/OpenDriveLab/UniAD/issues/21]: Previously, the performance of the stage1 model (track_map) could not be replicated when trained from scratch, due to mistakenly adding `loss_past_traj` and freezing `img_neck` and `BN`. By removing `loss_past_traj` and unfreezing `img_neck` and `BN` in training, the reported results could be reproduced (AMOTA: 0.393, [stage1_train_log](https://github.com/OpenDriveLab/UniAD/releases/download/v1.0/uniad_reproduce_stage1_gpu16_train.log)).\n\n- **`2023/04/18`** New feature: You can replace BEVFormer with other BEV Encoding methods, e.g., LSS, as long as you provide the `bev_embed` and `bev_pos` in [track_train](https://github.com/OpenDriveLab/UniAD/blob/cb4e3dc336ac9f94897ef3c7d85edba85a507726/projects/mmdet3d_plugin/uniad/detectors/uniad_track.py#L394) and [track_inference](https://github.com/OpenDriveLab/UniAD/blob/cb4e3dc336ac9f94897ef3c7d85edba85a507726/projects/mmdet3d_plugin/uniad/detectors/uniad_track.py#L661). Make sure your bevs and ours are of the same shape.\n- **`2023/04/18`** Base-model checkpoints are released.\n\n\n- **`2023/03/29`** Code & model initial release `v1.0`.\n- **`2023/03/21`** 🌟🌟 UniAD is accepted by CVPR 2023, as an **Award Candidate** (12 out of 2360 accepted papers)!\n- **`2022/12/21`** UniAD [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10156) is available on arXiv.\n\n\n\n## Getting Started <a name=\"start\"></a>\n- [Installation](docs/INSTALL.md)\n- [Prepare Dataset](docs/DATA_PREP.md)\n- [Evaluation Example](docs/TRAIN_EVAL.md#example)\n- [GPU Requirements](docs/TRAIN_EVAL.md#gpu)\n- [Train/Eval](docs/TRAIN_EVAL.md)\n\n## Results and Pre-trained Models <a name=\"models\"></a>\nUniAD is trained in two stages. Pretrained checkpoints of both stages will be released and the results of each model are listed in the following tables.\n\n### Stage1: Perception training\n> We first train the perception modules (i.e., track and map) to obtain a stable weight initlization for the next stage.

BEV features are aggregated with 3 frames (queue_length = 3).\n\n<!-- \nPre-trained models and results under main metrics are provided below.

Change the `load_from` field to `path/of/ckpt` in the config and follow the `train` section in [TRAIN_EVAL.md](docs/TRAIN_EVAL.md) to start training.\n\n\n### Model Structure\nThe overall pipeline of UniAD is controlled by [uniad_e2e.py](projects/mmdet3d_plugin/uniad/detectors/uniad_e2e.py) which coordinates all the task modules in `UniAD/projects/mmdet3d_plugin/uniad/dense_heads`. If you are interested in the implementation of a specific task module, please refer to its corresponding file, e.g., [motion_head](projects/mmdet3d_plugin/uniad/dense_heads/motion_head.py).\n\n\n## License <a name=\"license\"></a>\n\nAll assets and code are under the [Apache 2.0 license](./LICENSE) unless specified otherwise.\n\n## Citation <a name=\"citation\"></a>\n\n\nIf you find our project useful for your research, please consider citing our paper and codebase with the following BibTeX:\n\n\n```bibtex\n@inproceedings{hu2023_uniad,\n title={Planning-oriented Autonomous Driving}, \n author={Yihan Hu and Jiazhi Yang and Li Chen and Keyu Li and Chonghao Sima and Xizhou Zhu and Siqi Chai and Senyao Du and Tianwei Lin and Wenhai Wang and Lewei Lu and Xiaosong Jia and Qiang Liu and Jifeng Dai and Yu Qiao and Hongyang Li},\n booktitle={Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition},\n year={2023},\n}\n```\n\n```bibtex\n@misc{contributors2023_uniadrepo,\n  title={Planning-oriented Autonomous Driving},\n  author={UniAD contributors},\n  howpublished={\\url{https://github.com/OpenDriveLab/UniAD}},\n  year={2023}\n}\n```\n## Related Resources\n\n[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)\n- [BEVFormer](https://github.com/fundamentalvision/BEVFormer) (Ours!)\n- [ST-P3](https://github.com/OpenPerceptionX/ST-P3) (Ours!)\n- [FIERY](https://github.com/wayveai/fiery)\n- [MOTR](https://github.com/megvii-research/MOTR)\n\n\n## 🔥 See Also  <a name=\"see\"></a>\nWe are thrilled to launch our recent line of works: [GenAD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09630) and [Vista](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17398), to advance  **driving world models** with the **largest driving video dataset** collected from the web - [OpenDV](https://github.com/OpenDriveLab/DriveAGI/tree/main/opendv).\n\n\n[GenAD](https://github.com/OpenDriveLab/DriveAGI): **Generalized Predictive Model for Autonomous Driving** (CVPR'24, Highlight ⭐)\n\n<div id=\"top\" align=\"center\">\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"sources/opendv_dataset.png\" width=\"1000px\" >\n</p>\n</div>\n\n\n[Vista](https://github.com/OpenDriveLab/Vista): **A Generalizable Driving World Model with High Fidelity and Versatile Controllability** 🌏\n<div id=\"top\" align=\"center\">\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"sources/vista.gif\" width=\"1000px\" >\n</p>\n</div>\n"
