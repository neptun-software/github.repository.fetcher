You can run the evaluation with extra `--dry-run` to download these datasets.\nCurrently, the supported datasets are listed in [here](https://github.com/open-compass/opencompass/blob/main/opencompass/utils/datasets_info.py#L259). More datasets will be uploaded recently.\n\n#### (Optional) Automatic Download with ModelScope\n\nAlso you can use the [ModelScope](www.modelscope.cn) to load the datasets on demand.\n\nInstallation:\n\n```bash\npip install modelscope[framework]\nexport DATASET_SOURCE=ModelScope\n```\n\nThen submit the evaluation task without downloading all the data to your local disk. Available datasets include:\n\n```bash\nhumaneval, triviaqa, commonsenseqa, tydiqa, strategyqa, cmmlu, lambada, piqa, ceval, math, LCSTS, Xsum, winogrande, openbookqa, AGIEval, gsm8k, nq, race, siqa, mbpp, mmlu, hellaswag, ARC, BBH, xstory_cloze, summedits, GAOKAO-BENCH, OCNLI, cmnli\n```\n\nSome third-party features, like Humaneval and Llama, may require additional steps to work properly, for detailed steps please refer to the [Installation Guide](https://opencompass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started/installation.html).\n\n<p align=\"right\"><a href=\"#top\">🔝Back to top</a></p>\n\n## 🏗️ ️Evaluation\n\nAfter ensuring that OpenCompass is installed correctly according to the above steps and the datasets are prepared. Now you can start your first evaluation using OpenCompass!\n\n- Your first evaluation with OpenCompass!\n\n  OpenCompass support setting your configs via CLI or a python script. For simple evaluation settings we recommend using CLI, for more complex evaluation, it is suggested using the script way. You can find more example scripts under the configs folder.\n\n  ```bash\n  # CLI\n  opencompass --models hf_internlm2_5_1_8b_chat --datasets demo_gsm8k_chat_gen\n\n  # Python scripts\n  opencompass ./configs/eval_chat_demo.py\n  ```\n\n  You can find more script examples under [configs](./configs) folder.\n\n- API evaluation\n\n  OpenCompass, by its design, does not really discriminate between open-source models and API models. You can evaluate both model types in the same way or even in one settings.\n\n  ```bash\n  export OPENAI_API_KEY=\"YOUR_OPEN_API_KEY\"\n  # CLI\n  opencompass --models gpt_4o_2024_05_13 --datasets demo_gsm8k_chat_gen\n\n  # Python scripts\n  opencompass ./configs/eval_api_demo.py\n\n  # You can use o1_mini_2024_09_12/o1_preview_2024_09_12  for o1 models, we set max_completion_tokens=8192 as default.\n  ```\n\n- Accelerated Evaluation\n\n  Additionally, if you want to use an inference backend other than HuggingFace for accelerated evaluation, such as LMDeploy or vLLM, you can do so with the command below. Please ensure that you have installed the necessary packages for the chosen backend and that your model supports accelerated inference with it. For more information, see the documentation on inference acceleration backends [here](docs/en/advanced_guides/accelerator_intro.md). Below is an example using LMDeploy:\n\n  ```bash\n  # CLI\n  opencompass --models hf_internlm2_5_1_8b_chat --datasets demo_gsm8k_chat_gen -a lmdeploy\n\n  # Python scripts\n  opencompass ./configs/eval_lmdeploy_demo.py\n  ```\n\n- Supported Models\n\n  OpenCompass has predefined configurations for many models and datasets. You can list all available model and dataset configurations using the [tools](./docs/en/tools.md#list-configs).\n\n  ```bash\n  # List all configurations\n  python tools/list_configs.py\n  # List all configurations related to llama and mmlu\n  python tools/list_configs.py llama mmlu\n  ```\n\n  If the model is not on the list but supported by Huggingface AutoModel class, you can also evaluate it with OpenCompass. You are welcome to contribute to the maintenance of the OpenCompass supported model and dataset lists.\n\n  ```bash\n  opencompass --datasets demo_gsm8k_chat_gen --hf-type chat --hf-path internlm/internlm2_5-1_8b-chat\n  ```\n\n  If you want to use multiple GPUs to evaluate the model in data parallel, you can use `--max-num-worker`.\n\n  ```bash\n  CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 opencompass --datasets demo_gsm8k_chat_gen --hf-type chat --hf-path internlm/internlm2_5-1_8b-chat --max-num-worker 2\n  ```\n\n> \\[!TIP\\]\n>\n> `--hf-num-gpus` is used for model parallel(huggingface format), `--max-num-worker` is used for data parallel.\n\n> \\[!TIP\\]\n>\n> configuration with `_ppl` is designed for base model typically.\n> configuration with `_gen` can be used for both base model and chat model.\n\nThrough the command line or configuration files, OpenCompass also supports evaluating APIs or custom models, as well as more diversified evaluation strategies. Please read the [Quick Start](https://opencompass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started/quick_start.html) to learn how to run an evaluation task.\n\n<p align=\"right\"><a href=\"#top\">🔝Back to top</a></p>\n\n## 📣 OpenCompass 2.0\n\nWe are thrilled to introduce OpenCompass 2.0, an advanced suite featuring three key components: [CompassKit](https://github.com/open-compass), [CompassHub](https://hub.opencompass.org.cn/home), and [CompassRank](https://rank.opencompass.org.cn/home).\n![oc20](https://github.com/tonysy/opencompass/assets/7881589/90dbe1c0-c323-470a-991e-2b37ab5350b2)\n\n**CompassRank** has been significantly enhanced into the leaderboards that now incorporates both open-source benchmarks and proprietary benchmarks.

创建虚拟环境\n\n  ```bash\n  conda create --name opencompass python=3.10 -y\n  conda activate opencompass\n  ```\n\n- #### 通过pip安装OpenCompass\n\n  ```bash\n  # 支持绝大多数数据集及模型\n  pip install -U opencompass\n\n  # 完整安装（支持更多数据集）\n  # pip install \"opencompass[full]\"\n\n  # 模型推理后端，由于这些推理后端通常存在依赖冲突，建议使用不同的虚拟环境来管理它们。\n  # pip install \"opencompass[lmdeploy]\"\n  # pip install \"opencompass[vllm]\"\n\n  # API 测试（例如 OpenAI、Qwen）\n  # pip install \"opencompass[api]\"\n  ```\n\n- #### 基于源码安装OpenCompass\n\n  如果希望使用 OpenCompass 的最新功能，也可以从源代码构建它：\n\n  ```bash\n  git clone https://github.com/open-compass/opencompass opencompass\n  cd opencompass\n  pip install -e .\n  # pip install -e \".[full]\"\n  # pip install -e \".[vllm]\"\n  ```\n\n### 📂 数据准备\n\n#### 提前离线下载\n\nOpenCompass支持使用本地数据集进行评测，数据集的下载和解压可以通过以下命令完成：\n\n```bash\n# 下载数据集到 data/ 处\nwget https://github.com/open-compass/opencompass/releases/download/0.2.2.rc1/OpenCompassData-core-20240207.zip\nunzip OpenCompassData-core-20240207.zip\n```\n\n#### 从 OpenCompass 自动下载\n\n我们已经支持从OpenCompass存储服务器自动下载数据集。您可以通过额外的 `--dry-run` 参数来运行评估以下载这些数据集。\n目前支持的数据集列表在[这里](https://github.com/open-compass/opencompass/blob/main/opencompass/utils/datasets_info.py#L259)。更多数据集将会很快上传。\n\n#### (可选) 使用 ModelScope 自动下载\n\n另外，您还可以使用[ModelScope](www.modelscope.cn)来加载数据集：\n环境准备：\n\n```bash\npip install modelscope\nexport DATASET_SOURCE=ModelScope\n```\n\n配置好环境后，无需下载全部数据，直接提交评测任务即可。目前支持的数据集有：\n\n```bash\nhumaneval, triviaqa, commonsenseqa, tydiqa, strategyqa, cmmlu, lambada, piqa, ceval, math, LCSTS, Xsum, winogrande, openbookqa, AGIEval, gsm8k, nq, race, siqa, mbpp, mmlu, hellaswag, ARC, BBH, xstory_cloze, summedits, GAOKAO-BENCH, OCNLI, cmnli\n```\n\n有部分第三方功能,如 Humaneval 以及 Llama,可能需要额外步骤才能正常运行，详细步骤请参考[安装指南](https://opencompass.readthedocs.io/zh_CN/latest/get_started/installation.html)。\n\n<p align=\"right\"><a href=\"#top\">🔝返回顶部</a></p>\n\n## 🏗️ ️评测\n\n在确保按照上述步骤正确安装了 OpenCompass 并准备好了数据集之后，现在您可以开始使用 OpenCompass 进行首次评估！\n\n- ### 首次评测\n\n  OpenCompass 支持通过命令行界面 (CLI) 或 Python 脚本来设置配置。对于简单的评估设置，我们推荐使用 CLI；而对于更复杂的评估，则建议使用脚本方式。你可以在configs文件夹下找到更多脚本示例。\n\n  ```bash\n  # 命令行界面 (CLI)\n  opencompass --models hf_internlm2_5_1_8b_chat --datasets demo_gsm8k_chat_gen\n\n  # Python 脚本\n  opencompass ./configs/eval_chat_demo.py\n  ```\n\n  你可以在[configs](./configs) 文件夹下找到更多的脚本示例。\n\n- ### API评测\n\n  OpenCompass 在设计上并不区分开源模型与 API 模型。您可以以相同的方式或甚至在同一设置中评估这两种类型的模型。\n\n  ```bash\n  export OPENAI_API_KEY=\"YOUR_OPEN_API_KEY\"\n  # 命令行界面 (CLI)\n  opencompass --models gpt_4o_2024_05_13 --datasets demo_gsm8k_chat_gen\n\n  # Python 脚本\n  opencompass  ./configs/eval_api_demo.py\n\n\n  # 现已支持 o1_mini_2024_09_12/o1_preview_2024_09_12  模型, 默认情况下 max_completion_tokens=8192.\n  ```\n\n- ### 推理后端\n\n  另外，如果您想使用除 HuggingFace 之外的推理后端来进行加速评估，比如 LMDeploy 或 vLLM，可以通过以下命令进行。请确保您已经为所选的后端安装了必要的软件包，并且您的模型支持该后端的加速推理。更多信息，请参阅关于推理加速后端的文档 [这里](docs/zh_cn/advanced_guides/accelerator_intro.md)。以下是使用 LMDeploy 的示例：\n\n  ```bash\n  opencompass --models hf_internlm2_5_1_8b_chat --datasets demo_gsm8k_chat_gen -a lmdeploy\n  ```\n\n  OpenCompass 预定义了许多模型和数据集的配置，你可以通过 [工具](./docs/zh_cn/tools.md#ListConfigs) 列出所有可用的模型和数据集配置。\n\n- ### 支持的模型\n\n  ```bash\n  # 列出所有配置\n  python tools/list_configs.py\n  # 列出所有跟 llama 及 mmlu 相关的配置\n  python tools/list_configs.py llama mmlu\n  ```\n\n  如果模型不在列表中但支持 Huggingface AutoModel 类，您仍然可以使用 OpenCompass 对其进行评估。欢迎您贡献维护 OpenCompass 支持的模型和数据集列表。\n\n  ```bash\n  opencompass --datasets demo_gsm8k_chat_gen --hf-type chat --hf-path internlm/internlm2_5-1_8b-chat\n  ```\n\n  如果你想在多块 GPU 上使用模型进行推理，您可以使用 `--max-num-worker` 参数。\n\n  ```bash\n  CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 opencompass --datasets demo_gsm8k_chat_gen --hf-type chat --hf-path internlm/internlm2_5-1_8b-chat --max-num-worker 2\n  ```\n\n> \\[!TIP\\]\n>\n> `--hf-num-gpus` 用于 模型并行(huggingface 格式)，`--max-num-worker` 用于数据并行。\n\n> \\[!TIP\\]\n>\n> configuration with `_ppl` is designed for base model typically.\n> 配置带 `_ppl` 的配置设计给基础模型使用。\n> 配置带 `_gen` 的配置可以同时用于基础模型和对话模型。\n\n通过命令行或配置文件，OpenCompass 还支持评测 API 或自定义模型，以及更多样化的评测策略。请阅读[快速开始](https://opencompass.readthedocs.io/zh_CN/latest/get_started/quick_start.html)了解如何运行一个评测任务。\n\n更多教程请查看我们的[文档](https://opencompass.readthedocs.io/zh_CN/latest/index.html)。\n\n<p
