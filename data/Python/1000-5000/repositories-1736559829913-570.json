          "content": "# build nanoGPT\n\nThis repo holds the from-scratch reproduction of [nanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT/tree/master). The git commits were specifically kept step by step and clean so that one can easily walk through the git commit history to see it built slowly. Additionally, there is an accompanying [video lecture on YouTube](https://youtu.be/l8pRSuU81PU) where you can see me introduce each commit and explain the pieces along the way.\n\nWe basically start from an empty file and work our way to a reproduction of the [GPT-2](https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf) (124M) model. If you have more patience or money, the code can also reproduce the [GPT-3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165) models. While the GPT-2 (124M) model probably trained for quite some time back in the day (2019, ~5 years ago), today, reproducing it is a matter of ~1hr and ~$10. You'll need a cloud GPU box if you don't have enough, for that I recommend [Lambda](https://lambdalabs.com).\n\nNote that GPT-2 and GPT-3 and both simple language models, trained on internet documents, and all they do is \"dream\" internet documents. So this repo/video this does not cover Chat finetuning, and you can't talk to it like you can talk to ChatGPT. The finetuning process (while quite simple conceptually - SFT is just about swapping out the dataset and continuing the training) comes after this part and will be covered at a later time. For now this is the kind of stuff that the 124M model says if you prompt it with \"Hello, I'm a language model,\" after 10B tokens of training:\n\n```\nHello, I'm a language model, and my goal is to make English as easy and fun as possible for everyone, and to find out the different grammar rules\nHello, I'm a language model, so the next time I go, I'll just say, I like this stuff.\nHello, I'm a language model, and the question is, what should I do if I want to be a teacher?\nHello, I'm a language model, and I'm an English person. In languages, \"speak\" is really speaking. Because for most people, there's\n```\n\nAnd after 40B tokens of training:\n\n```\nHello, I'm a language model, a model of computer science, and it's a way (in mathematics) to program computer programs to do things like write\nHello, I'm a language model, not a human. This means that I believe in my language model, as I have no experience with it yet.\nHello, I'm a language model, but I'm talking about data. You've got to create an array of data: you've got to create that.\nHello, I'm a language model, and all of this is about modeling and learning Python. I'm very good in syntax, however I struggle with Python due\n```\n\nLol. Anyway, once the video comes out, this will also be a place for FAQ, and a place for fixes and errata, of which I am sure there will be a number :)\n\nFor discussions and questions, please use [Discussions tab](https://github.com/karpathy/build-nanogpt/discussions), and for faster communication, have a look at my [Zero To Hero Discord](https://discord.gg/3zy8kqD9Cp), channel **#nanoGPT**:\n\n[![](https://dcbadge.vercel.app/api/server/3zy8kqD9Cp?compact=true&style=flat)](https://discord.gg/3zy8kqD9Cp)\n\n## Video\n\n[Let's reproduce GPT-2 (124M) YouTube lecture](https://youtu.be/l8pRSuU81PU)\n\n## Errata\n\nMinor cleanup, we forgot to delete `register_buffer` of the bias once we switched to flash attention, fixed with a recent PR.\n\nEarlier version of PyTorch may have difficulty converting from uint16 to long. Inside `load_tokens`, we added `npt = npt.astype(np.int32)` to use numpy to convert uint16 to int32 before converting to torch tensor and then converting to long.\n\nThe `torch.autocast` function takes an arg `device_type`, to which I tried to stubbornly just pass `device` hoping it works ok, but PyTorch actually really wants just the type and creates errors in some version of PyTorch. So we want e.g. the device `cuda:3` to get stripped to `cuda`. Currently, device `mps` (Apple Silicon) would become `device_type` CPU, I'm not 100% sure this is the intended PyTorch way.\n\nConfusingly, `model.require_backward_grad_sync` is actually used by both the forward and backward pass. Moved up the line so that it also gets applied to the forward pass. \n\n## Prod\n\nFor more production-grade runs that are very similar to nanoGPT, I recommend looking at the following repos:\n\n- [litGPT](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/litgpt)\n- [TinyLlama](https://github.com/jzhang38/TinyLlama)\n\n## FAQ\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"

What then? what then?\n\nFirst Citizen:\nShould by the cormorant belly be restrain'd,\nWho is the sink o' the body,--\n\nMENENIUS:\nWell, what then?\n\nFirst Citizen:\nThe former agents, if they did complain,\nWhat could the belly answer?\n\nMENENIUS:\nI will tell you\nIf you'll bestow a small--of what you have little--\nPatience awhile, you'll hear the belly's answer.\n\nFirst Citizen:\nYe're long about it.\n\nMENENIUS:\nNote me this, good friend;\nYour most grave belly was deliberate,\nNot rash like his accusers, and thus answer'd:\n'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he,\n'That I receive the general food at first,\nWhich you do live upon; and fit it is,\nBecause I am the store-house and the shop\nOf the whole body: but, if you do remember,\nI send it through the rivers of your blood,\nEven to the court, the heart, to the seat o' the brain;\nAnd, through the cranks and offices of man,\nThe strongest nerves and small inferior veins\nFrom me receive that natural competency\nWhereby they live: and though that all at once,\nYou, my good friends,'--this says the belly, mark me,--\n\nFirst Citizen:\nAy, sir; well, well.\n\nMENENIUS:\n'Though all at once cannot\nSee what I do deliver out to each,\nYet I can make my audit up, that all\nFrom me do back receive the flour of all,\nAnd leave me but the bran.' What say you to't?\n\nFirst Citizen:\nIt was an answer: how apply you this?\n\nMENENIUS:\nThe senators of Rome are this good belly,\nAnd you the mutinous members; for examine\nTheir counsels and their cares, digest things rightly\nTouching the weal o' the common, you shall find\nNo public benefit which you receive\nBut it proceeds or comes from them to you\nAnd no way from yourselves. What do you think,\nYou, the great toe of this assembly?\n\nFirst Citizen:\nI the great toe! why the great toe?\n\nMENENIUS:\nFor that, being one o' the lowest, basest, poorest,\nOf this most wise rebellion, thou go'st foremost:\nThou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,\nLead'st first to win some vantage.\nBut make you ready your stiff bats and clubs:\nRome and her rats are at the point of battle;\nThe one side must have bale.\nHail, noble Marcius!\n\nMARCIUS:\nThanks. What's the matter, you dissentious rogues,\nThat, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,\nMake yourselves scabs?\n\nFirst Citizen:\nWe have ever your good word.\n\nMARCIUS:\nHe that will give good words to thee will flatter\nBeneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,\nThat like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you,\nThe other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,\nWhere he should find you lions, finds you hares;\nWhere foxes, geese: you are no surer, no,\nThan is the coal of fire upon the ice,\nOr hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is\nTo make him worthy whose offence subdues him\nAnd curse that justice did it.\nWho deserves greatness\nDeserves your hate; and your affections are\nA sick man's appetite, who desires most that\nWhich would increase his evil. He that depends\nUpon your favours swims with fins of lead\nAnd hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust Ye?\nWith every minute you do change a mind,\nAnd call him noble that was now your hate,\nHim vile that was your garland. What's the matter,\nThat in these several places of the city\nYou cry against the noble senate, who,\nUnder the gods, keep you in awe, which else\nWould feed on one another? What's their seeking?\n\nMENENIUS:\nFor corn at their own rates; whereof, they say,\nThe city is well stored.\n\nMARCIUS:\nHang 'em! They say!\nThey'll sit by the fire, and presume to know\nWhat's done i' the Capitol; who's like to rise,\nWho thrives and who declines; side factions\nand give out\nConjectural marriages; making parties strong\nAnd feebling such as stand not in their liking\nBelow their cobbled shoes. They say there's\ngrain enough!\nWould the nobility lay aside their ruth,\nAnd let me use my sword, I'll make a quarry\nWith thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high\nAs I could pick my lance.\n\nMENENIUS:\nNay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;\nFor though abundantly they lack discretion,\nYet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you,\nWhat says the other troop?\n\nMARCIUS:\nThey are dissolved: hang 'em!\nThey said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs,\nThat hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,\nThat meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not\nCorn for the rich men only: with these shreds\nThey vented their complainings; which being answer'd,\nAnd a petition granted them, a strange one--\nTo break the heart of generosity,\nAnd make bold power look pale--they threw their caps\nAs they would hang them on the horns o' the moon,\nShouting their emulation.\n\nMENENIUS:\nWhat is granted them?\n\nMARCIUS:\nFive tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,\nOf their own choice: one's Junius Brutus,\nSicinius Velutus, and I know not--'Sdeath!\nThe rabble should have first unroof'd the city,\nEre so prevail'd with me: it will in time\nWin upon power and throw forth greater themes\nFor insurrection's arguing.\n\nMENENIUS:\nThis is strange.\n\nMARCIUS:\nGo, get you home, you fragments!\n\nMessenger:\nWhere's Caius Marcius?\n\nMARCIUS:\nHere: what's the matter?\n\nMessenger:\nThe news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.\n\nMARCIUS:\nI am glad on 't: then we shall ha' means to vent\nOur musty superfluity. See, our best elders.\n\nFirst Senator:\nMarcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us;\nThe Volsces are in arms.\n\nMARCIUS:\nThey have a leader,\nTullus Aufidius, that will put you to 't.\nI sin in envying his nobility,\nAnd were I any thing but what I am,\nI would wish me only he.\n\nCOMINIUS:\nYou have fought together.\n\nMARCIUS:\nWere half to half the world by the ears and he.\nUpon my party, I'ld revolt to make\nOnly my wars with him: he is a lion\nThat I am proud to hunt.\n\nFirst Senator:\nThen, worthy Marcius,\nAttend upon Cominius to these wars.\n\nCOMINIUS:\nIt is your former promise.\n\nMARCIUS:\nSir, it is;\nAnd I am constant. Titus Lartius, thou\nShalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.\nWhat, art thou stiff? stand'st out?\n\nTITUS:\nNo, Caius Marcius;\nI'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other,\nEre stay behind this business.\n\nMENENIUS:\nO, true-bred!\n\nFirst Senator:\nYour company to the Capitol; where, I know,\nOur greatest friends attend us.\n\nTITUS:\n\nCOMINIUS:\nNoble Marcius!\n\nFirst Senator:\n\nMARCIUS:\nNay, let them follow:\nThe Volsces have much corn; take these rats thither\nTo gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutiners,\nYour valour puts well forth: pray, follow.\n\nSICINIUS:\nWas ever man so proud as is this Marcius?\n\nBRUTUS:\nHe has no equal.\n\nSICINIUS:\nWhen we were chosen tribunes for the people,--\n\nBRUTUS:\nMark'd you his lip and eyes?\n\nSICINIUS:\nNay. but his taunts.\n\nBRUTUS:\nBeing moved, he will not spare to gird the gods.\n\nSICINIUS:\nBe-mock the modest moon.\n\nBRUTUS:\nThe present wars devour him: he is grown\nToo proud to be so valiant.\n\nSICINIUS:\nSuch a nature,\nTickled with good success, disdains the shadow\nWhich he treads on at noon: but I do wonder\nHis insolence can brook to be commanded\nUnder Cominius.\n\nBRUTUS:\nFame, at the which he aims,\nIn whom already he's well graced, can not\nBetter be held nor more attain'd than by\nA place below the first: for what miscarries\nShall be the general's fault, though he perform\nTo the utmost of a man, and giddy censure\nWill then cry out of Marcius 'O if he\nHad borne the business!'\n\nSICINIUS:\nBesides, if things go well,\nOpinion that so sticks on Marcius shall\nOf his demerits rob Cominius.\n\nBRUTUS:\nCome:\nHalf all Cominius' honours are to Marcius.\nThough Marcius earned them not, and all his faults\nTo Marcius shall be honours, though indeed\nIn aught he merit not.\n\nSICINIUS:\nLet's hence, and hear\nHow the dispatch is made, and in what fashion,\nMore than his singularity, he goes\nUpon this present action.\n\nBRUTUS:\nLets along.\n\nFirst Senator:\nSo, your opinion is, Aufidius,\nThat they of Rome are entered in our counsels\nAnd know how we proceed.\n\nAUFIDIUS:\nIs it not yours?\nWhat ever have been thought on in this state,\nThat could be brought to bodily act ere Rome\nHad circumvention? 'Tis not four days gone\nSince I heard thence; these are the words: I think\nI have the letter here; yes, here it is.\n'They have press'd a power, but it is not known\nWhether for east or west: the dearth is great;\nThe people mutinous; and it is rumour'd,\nCominius, Marcius your old enemy,\nWho is of Rome worse hated than of you,\nAnd Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman,\nThese three lead on this preparation\nWhither 'tis bent: most likely 'tis for you:\nConsider of it.'\n\nFirst Senator:\nOur army's in the field\nWe never yet made doubt but Rome was ready\nTo answer us.\n\nAUFIDIUS:\nNor did you think it folly\nTo keep your great pretences veil'd till when\nThey needs must show themselves; which\nin the hatching,\nIt seem'd, appear'd to Rome. By the discovery.\nWe shall be shorten'd in our aim, which was\nTo take in many towns ere almost Rome\nShould know we were afoot.\n\nSecond Senator:\nNoble Aufidius,\nTake your commission; hie you to your bands:\nLet us alone to guard Corioli:\nIf they set down before 's, for the remove\nBring your army; but, I think, you'll find\nThey've not prepared for us.\n\nAUFIDIUS:\nO, doubt not that;\nI speak from certainties. Nay, more,\nSome parcels of their power are forth already,\nAnd only hitherward. I leave your honours.\nIf we and Caius Marcius chance to meet,\n'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike\nTill one can do no more.\n\nAll:\nThe gods assist you!\n\nAUFIDIUS:\nAnd keep your honours safe!\n\nFirst Senator:\nFarewell.\n\nSecond Senator:\nFarewell.\n\nAll:\nFarewell.\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nI pray you, daughter, sing; or express yourself in a\nmore comfortable sort: if my son were my husband, I\nshould freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he\nwon honour than in the embracements of his bed where\nhe would show most love. When yet he was but\ntender-bodied and the only son of my womb, when\nyouth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, when\nfor a day of kings' entreaties a mother should not\nsell him an hour from her beholding, I, considering\nhow honour would become such a person. that it was\nno better than picture-like to hang by the wall, if\nrenown made it not stir, was pleased to let him seek\ndanger where he was like to find fame. To a cruel\nwar I sent him; from whence he returned, his brows\nbound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not\nmore in joy at first hearing he was a man-child\nthan now in first seeing he had proved himself a\nman.\n\nVIRGILIA:\nBut had he died in the business, madam; how then?\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nThen his good report should have been my son; I\ntherein would have found issue. Hear me profess\nsincerely: had I a dozen sons, each in my love\nalike and none less dear than thine and my good\nMarcius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for their\ncountry than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.\n\nGentlewoman:\nMadam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you.\n\nVIRGILIA:\nBeseech you, give me leave to retire myself.\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nIndeed, you shall not.\nMethinks I hear hither your husband's drum,\nSee him pluck Aufidius down by the hair,\nAs children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him:\nMethinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus:\n'Come on, you cowards! you were got in fear,\nThough you were born in Rome:' his bloody brow\nWith his mail'd hand then wiping, forth he goes,\nLike to a harvest-man that's task'd to mow\nOr all or lose his hire.\n\nVIRGILIA:\nHis bloody brow! O Jupiter, no blood!\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nAway, you fool! it more becomes a man\nThan gilt his trophy: the breasts of Hecuba,\nWhen she did suckle Hector, look'd not lovelier\nThan Hector's forehead when it spit forth blood\nAt Grecian sword, contemning. Tell Valeria,\nWe are fit to bid her welcome.\n\nVIRGILIA:\nHeavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nHe'll beat Aufidius 'head below his knee\nAnd tread upon his neck.\n\nVALERIA:\nMy ladies both, good day to you.\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nSweet madam.\n\nVIRGILIA:\nI am glad to see your ladyship.\n\nVALERIA:\nHow do you both? you are manifest house-keepers.\nWhat are you sewing here? A fine spot, in good\nfaith. How does your little son?\n\nVIRGILIA:\nI thank your ladyship; well, good madam.\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nHe had rather see the swords, and hear a drum, than\nlook upon his school-master.\n\nVALERIA:\nO' my word, the father's son: I'll swear,'tis a\nvery pretty boy. O' my troth, I looked upon him o'\nWednesday half an hour together: has such a\nconfirmed countenance. I saw him run after a gilded\nbutterfly: and when he caught it, he let it go\nagain; and after it again; and over and over he\ncomes, and again; catched it again; or whether his\nfall enraged him, or how 'twas, he did so set his\nteeth and tear it; O, I warrant it, how he mammocked\nit!\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nOne on 's father's moods.\n\nVALERIA:\nIndeed, la, 'tis a noble child.\n\nVIRGILIA:\nA crack, madam.\n\nVALERIA:\nCome, lay aside your stitchery; I must have you play\nthe idle husewife with me this afternoon.\n\nVIRGILIA:\nNo, good madam; I will not out of doors.\n\nVALERIA:\nNot out of doors!\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nShe shall, she shall.\n\nVIRGILIA:\nIndeed, no, by your patience; I'll not over the\nthreshold till my lord return from the wars.\n\nVALERIA:\nFie, you confine yourself most unreasonably: come,\nyou must go visit the good lady that lies in.\n\nVIRGILIA:\nI will wish her speedy strength, and visit her with\nmy prayers; but I cannot go thither.\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nWhy, I pray you?\n\nVIRGILIA:\n'Tis not to save labour, nor that I want love.\n\nVALERIA:\nYou would be another Penelope: yet, they say, all\nthe yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill\nIthaca full of moths. Come; I would your cambric\nwere sensible as your finger, that you might leave\npricking it for pity. Come, you shall go with us.\n\nVIRGILIA:\nNo, good madam, pardon me; indeed, I will not forth.\n\nVALERIA:\nIn truth, la, go with me; and I'll tell you\nexcellent news of your husband.\n\nVIRGILIA:\nO, good madam, there can be none yet.\n\nVALERIA:\nVerily, I do not jest with you; there came news from\nhim last night.\n\nVIRGILIA:\nIndeed, madam?\n\nVALERIA:\nIn earnest, it's true; I heard a senator speak it.\nThus it is: the Volsces have an army forth; against\nwhom Cominius the general is gone, with one part of\nour Roman power: your lord and Titus Lartius are set\ndown before their city Corioli; they nothing doubt\nprevailing and to make it brief wars. This is true,\non mine honour; and so, I pray, go with us.\n\nVIRGILIA:\nGive me excuse, good madam; I will obey you in every\nthing hereafter.\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nLet her alone, lady: as she is now, she will but\ndisease our better mirth.\n\nVALERIA:\nIn troth, I think she would. Fare you well, then.\nCome, good sweet lady. Prithee, Virgilia, turn thy\nsolemness out o' door. and go along with us.\n\nVIRGILIA:\nNo, at a word, madam; indeed, I must not. I wish\nyou much mirth.\n\nVALERIA:\nWell, then, farewell.\n\nMARCIUS:\nYonder comes news. A wager they have met.\n\nLARTIUS:\nMy horse to yours, no.\n\nMARCIUS:\n'Tis done.\n\nLARTIUS:\nAgreed.\n\nMARCIUS:\nSay, has our general met the enemy?\n\nMessenger:\nThey lie in view; but have not spoke as yet.\n\nLARTIUS:\nSo, the good horse is mine.\n\nMARCIUS:\nI'll buy him of you.\n\nLARTIUS:\nNo, I'll nor sell nor give him: lend you him I will\nFor half a hundred years. Summon the town.\n\nMARCIUS:\nHow far off lie these armies?\n\nMessenger:\nWithin this mile and half.\n\nMARCIUS:\nThen shall we hear their 'larum, and they ours.\nNow, Mars, I prithee, make us quick in work,\nThat we with smoking swords may march from hence,\nTo help our fielded friends! Come, blow thy blast.\nTutus Aufidius, is he within your walls?\n\nFirst Senator:\nNo, nor a man that fears you less than he,\nThat's lesser than a little.\nHark! our drums\nAre bringing forth our youth. We'll break our walls,\nRather than they shall pound us up: our gates,\nWhich yet seem shut, we, have but pinn'd with rushes;\nThey'll open of themselves.\nHark you. far off!\nThere is Aufidius; list, what work he makes\nAmongst your cloven army.\n\nMARCIUS:\nO, they are at it!\n\nLARTIUS:\nTheir noise be our instruction. Ladders, ho!\n\nMARCIUS:\nThey fear us not, but issue forth their city.\nNow put your shields before your hearts, and fight\nWith hearts more proof than shields. Advance,\nbrave Titus:\nThey do disdain us much beyond our thoughts,\nWhich makes me sweat with wrath. Come on, my fellows:\nHe that retires I'll take him for a Volsce,\nAnd he shall feel mine edge.\n\nMARCIUS:\nAll the contagion of the south light on you,\nYou shames of Rome! you herd of--Boils and plagues\nPlaster you o'er, that you may be abhorr'd\nFurther than seen and one infect another\nAgainst the wind a mile! You souls of geese,\nThat bear the shapes of men, how have you run\nFrom slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!\nAll hurt behind; backs red, and faces pale\nWith flight and agued fear! Mend and charge home,\nOr, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe\nAnd make my wars on you: look to't: come on;\nIf you'll stand fast, we'll beat them to their wives,\nAs they us to our trenches followed.\nSo, now the gates are ope: now prove good seconds:\n'Tis for the followers fortune widens them,\nNot for the fliers: mark me, and do the like.\n\nFirst Soldier:\nFool-hardiness; not I.\n\nSecond Soldier:\nNor I.\n\nFirst Soldier:\nSee, they have shut him in.\n\nAll:\nTo the pot, I warrant him.\n\nLARTIUS:\nWhat is become of Marcius?\n\nAll:\nSlain, sir, doubtless.\n\nFirst Soldier:\nFollowing the fliers at the very heels,\nWith them he enters; who, upon the sudden,\nClapp'd to their gates: he is himself alone,\nTo answer all the city.\n\nLARTIUS:\nO noble fellow!\nWho sensibly outdares his senseless sword,\nAnd, when it bows, stands up. Thou art left, Marcius:\nA carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,\nWere not so rich a jewel. Thou wast a soldier\nEven to Cato's wish, not fierce and terrible\nOnly in strokes; but, with thy grim looks and\nThe thunder-like percussion of thy sounds,\nThou madst thine enemies shake, as if the world\nWere feverous and did tremble.\n\nFirst Soldier:\nLook, sir.\n\nLARTIUS:\nO,'tis Marcius!\nLet's fetch him off, or make remain alike.\n\nFirst Roman:\nThis will I carry to Rome.\n\nSecond Roman:\nAnd I this.\n\nThird Roman:\nA murrain on't! I took this for silver.\n\nMARCIUS:\nSee here these movers that do prize their hours\nAt a crack'd drachm! Cushions, leaden spoons,\nIrons of a doit, doublets that hangmen would\nBury with those that wore them, these base slaves,\nEre yet the fight be done, pack up: down with them!\nAnd hark, what noise the general makes! To him!\nThere is the man of my soul's hate, Aufidius,\nPiercing our Romans: then, valiant Titus, take\nConvenient numbers to make good the city;\nWhilst I, with those that have the spirit, will haste\nTo help Cominius.\n\nLARTIUS:\nWorthy sir, thou bleed'st;\nThy exercise hath been too violent for\nA second course of fight.\n\nMARCIUS:\nSir, praise me not;\nMy work hath yet not warm'd me: fare you well:\nThe blood I drop is rather physical\nThan dangerous to me: to Aufidius thus\nI will appear, and fight.\n\nLARTIUS:\nNow the fair goddess, Fortune,\nFall deep in love with thee; and her great charms\nMisguide thy opposers' swords! Bold gentleman,\nProsperity be thy page!\n\nMARCIUS:\nThy friend no less\nThan those she placeth highest! So, farewell.\n\nLARTIUS:\nThou worthiest Marcius!\nGo, sound thy trumpet in the market-place;\nCall thither all the officers o' the town,\nWhere they shall know our mind: away!\n\nCOMINIUS:\nBreathe you, my friends: well fought;\nwe are come off\nLike Romans, neither foolish in our stands,\nNor cowardly in retire: believe me, sirs,\nWe shall be charged again. Whiles we have struck,\nBy interims and conveying gusts we have heard\nThe charges of our friends. Ye Roman gods!\nLead their successes as we wish our own,\nThat both our powers, with smiling\nfronts encountering,\nMay give you thankful sacrifice.\nThy news?\n\nMessenger:\nThe citizens of Corioli have issued,\nAnd given to Lartius and to Marcius battle:\nI saw our party to their trenches driven,\nAnd then I came away.\n\nCOMINIUS:\nThough thou speak'st truth,\nMethinks thou speak'st not well.\nHow long is't since?\n\nMessenger:\nAbove an hour, my lord.\n\nCOMINIUS:\n'Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums:\nHow couldst thou in a mile confound an hour,\nAnd bring thy news so late?\n\nMessenger:\nSpies of the Volsces\nHeld me in chase, that I was forced to wheel\nThree or four miles about, else had I, sir,\nHalf an hour since brought my report.\n\nCOMINIUS:\nWho's yonder,\nThat does appear as he were flay'd? O gods\nHe has the stamp of Marcius; and I have\nBefore-time seen him thus.\n\nMARCIUS:\n\nCOMINIUS:\nThe shepherd knows not thunder from a tabour\nMore than I know the sound of Marcius' tongue\nFrom every meaner man.\n\nMARCIUS:\nCome I too late?\n\nCOMINIUS:\nAy, if you come not in the blood of others,\nBut mantled in your own.\n\nMARCIUS:\nO, let me clip ye\nIn arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heart\nAs merry as when our nuptial day was done,\nAnd tapers burn'd to bedward!\n\nCOMINIUS:\nFlower of warriors,\nHow is it with Titus Lartius?\n\nMARCIUS:\nAs with a man busied about decrees:\nCondemning some to death, and some to exile;\nRansoming him, or pitying, threatening the other;\nHolding Corioli in the name of Rome,\nEven like a fawning greyhound in the leash,\nTo let him slip at will.\n\nCOMINIUS:\nWhere is that slave\nWhich told me they had beat you to your trenches?\nWhere is he? call him hither.\n\nMARCIUS:\nLet him alone;\nHe did inform the truth: but for our gentlemen,\nThe common file--a plague! tribunes for them!--\nThe mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge\nFrom rascals worse than they.\n\nCOMINIUS:\nBut how prevail'd you?\n\nMARCIUS:\nWill the time serve to tell? I do not think.\nWhere is the enemy? are you lords o' the field?\nIf not, why cease you till you are so?\n\nCOMINIUS:\nMarcius,\nWe have at disadvantage fought and did\nRetire to win our purpose.\n\nMARCIUS:\nHow lies their battle? know you on which side\nThey have placed their men of trust?\n\nCOMINIUS:\nAs I guess, Marcius,\nTheir bands i' the vaward are the Antiates,\nOf their best trust; o'er them Aufidius,\nTheir very heart of hope.\n\nMARCIUS:\nI do beseech you,\nBy all the battles wherein we have fought,\nBy the blood we have shed together, by the vows\nWe have made to endure friends, that you directly\nSet me against Aufidius and his Antiates;\nAnd that you not delay the present, but,\nFilling the air with swords advanced and darts,\nWe prove this very hour.\n\nCOMINIUS:\nThough I could wish\nYou were conducted to a gentle bath\nAnd balms applied to, you, yet dare I never\nDeny your asking: take your choice of those\nThat best can aid your action.\n\nMARCIUS:\nThose are they\nThat most are willing. If any such be here--\nAs it were sin to doubt--that love this painting\nWherein you see me smear'd; if any fear\nLesser his person than an ill report;\nIf any think brave death outweighs bad life\nAnd that his country's dearer than himself;\nLet him alone, or so many so minded,\nWave thus, to express his disposition,\nAnd follow Marcius.\nO, me alone! make you a sword of me?\nIf these shows be not outward, which of you\nBut is four Volsces? none of you but is\nAble to bear against the great Aufidius\nA shield as hard as his. A certain number,\nThough thanks to all, must I select\nfrom all: the rest\nShall bear the business in some other fight,\nAs cause will be obey'd. Please you to march;\nAnd four shall quickly draw out my command,\nWhich men are best inclined.\n\nCOMINIUS:\nMarch on, my fellows:\nMake good this ostentation, and you shall\nDivide in all with us.\n\nLARTIUS:\nSo, let the ports be guarded: keep your duties,\nAs I have set them down. If I do send, dispatch\nThose centuries to our aid: the rest will serve\nFor a short holding: if we lose the field,\nWe cannot keep the town.\n\nLieutenant:\nFear not our care, sir.\n\nLARTIUS:\nHence, and shut your gates upon's.\nOur guider, come; to the Roman camp conduct us.\n\nMARCIUS:\nI'll fight with none but thee; for I do hate thee\nWorse than a promise-breaker.\n\nAUFIDIUS:\nWe hate alike:\nNot Afric owns a serpent I abhor\nMore than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot.\n\nMARCIUS:\nLet the first budger die the other's slave,\nAnd the gods doom him after!\n\nAUFIDIUS:\nIf I fly, Marcius,\nHolloa me like a hare.\n\nMARCIUS:\nWithin these three hours, Tullus,\nAlone I fought in your Corioli walls,\nAnd made what work I pleased: 'tis not my blood\nWherein thou seest me mask'd; for thy revenge\nWrench up thy power to the highest.\n\nAUFIDIUS:\nWert thou the Hector\nThat was the whip of your bragg'd progeny,\nThou shouldst not scape me here.\nOfficious, and not valiant, you have shamed me\nIn your condemned seconds.\n\nCOMINIUS:\nIf I should tell thee o'er this thy day's work,\nThou'ldst not believe thy deeds: but I'll report it\nWhere senators shall mingle tears with smiles,\nWhere great patricians shall attend and shrug,\nI' the end admire, where ladies shall be frighted,\nAnd, gladly quaked, hear more; where the\ndull tribunes,\nThat, with the fusty plebeians, hate thine honours,\nShall say against their hearts 'We thank the gods\nOur Rome hath such a soldier.'\nYet camest thou to a morsel of this feast,\nHaving fully dined before.\n\nLARTIUS:\nO general,\nHere is the steed, we the caparison:\nHadst thou beheld--\n\nMARCIUS:\nPray now, no more: my mother,\nWho has a charter to extol her blood,\nWhen she does praise me grieves me. I have done\nAs you have done; that's what I can; induced\nAs you have been; that's for my country:\nHe that has but effected his good will\nHath overta'en mine act.\n\nCOMINIUS:\nYou shall not be\nThe grave of your deserving; Rome must know\nThe value of her own: 'twere a concealment\nWorse than a theft, no less than a traducement,\nTo hide your doings; and to silence that,\nWhich, to the spire and top of praises vouch'd,\nWould seem but modest: therefore, I beseech you\nIn sign of what you are, not to reward\nWhat you have done--before our army hear me.\n\nMARCIUS:\nI have some wounds upon me, and they smart\nTo hear themselves remember'd.\n\nCOMINIUS:\nShould they not,\nWell might they fester 'gainst ingratitude,\nAnd tent themselves with death. Of all the horses,\nWhereof we have ta'en good and good store, of all\nThe treasure in this field achieved and city,\nWe render you the tenth, to be ta'en forth,\nBefore the common distribution, at\nYour only choice.\n\nMARCIUS:\nI thank you, general;\nBut cannot make my heart consent to take\nA bribe to pay my sword: I do refuse it;\nAnd stand upon my common part with those\nThat have beheld the doing.\n\nMARCIUS:\nMay these same instruments, which you profane,\nNever sound more! when drums and trumpets shall\nI' the field prove flatterers, let courts and cities be\nMade all of false-faced soothing!\nWhen steel grows soft as the parasite's silk,\nLet him be made a coverture for the wars!\nNo more, I say! For that I have not wash'd\nMy nose that bled, or foil'd some debile wretch.--\nWhich, without note, here's many else have done,--\nYou shout me forth\nIn acclamations hyperbolical;\nAs if I loved my little should be dieted\nIn praises sauced with lies.\n\nCOMINIUS:\nToo modest are you;\nMore cruel to your good report than grateful\nTo us that give you truly: by your patience,\nIf 'gainst yourself you be incensed, we'll put you,\nLike one that means his proper harm, in manacles,\nThen reason safely with you. Therefore, be it known,\nAs to us, to all the world, that Caius Marcius\nWears this war's garland: in token of the which,\nMy noble steed, known to the camp, I give him,\nWith all his trim belonging; and from this time,\nFor what he did before Corioli, call him,\nWith all the applause and clamour of the host,\nCAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS! Bear\nThe addition nobly ever!\n\nAll:\nCaius Marcius Coriolanus!\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nI will go wash;\nAnd when my face is fair, you shall perceive\nWhether I blush or no: howbeit, I thank you.\nI mean to stride your steed, and at all times\nTo undercrest your good addition\nTo the fairness of my power.\n\nCOMINIUS:\nSo, to our tent;\nWhere, ere we do repose us, we will write\nTo Rome of our success. You, Titus Lartius,\nMust to Corioli back: send us to Rome\nThe best, with whom we may articulate,\nFor their own good and ours.\n\nLARTIUS:\nI shall, my lord.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nThe gods begin to mock me. I, that now\nRefused most princely gifts, am bound to beg\nOf my lord general.\n\nCOMINIUS:\nTake't; 'tis yours. What is't?\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nI sometime lay here in Corioli\nAt a poor man's house; he used me kindly:\nHe cried to me; I saw him prisoner;\nBut then Aufidius was within my view,\nAnd wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity: I request you\nTo give my poor host freedom.\n\nCOMINIUS:\nO, well begg'd!\nWere he the butcher of my son, he should\nBe free as is the wind. Deliver him, Titus.\n\nLARTIUS:\nMarcius, his name?\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nBy Jupiter! forgot.\nI am weary; yea, my memory is tired.\nHave we no wine here?\n\nCOMINIUS:\nGo we to our tent:\nThe blood upon your visage dries; 'tis time\nIt should be look'd to: come.\n\nAUFIDIUS:\nThe town is ta'en!\n\nFirst Soldier:\n'Twill be deliver'd back on good condition.\n\nAUFIDIUS:\nCondition!\nI would I were a Roman; for I cannot,\nBeing a Volsce, be that I am. Condition!\nWhat good condition can a treaty find\nI' the part that is at mercy? Five times, Marcius,\nI have fought with thee: so often hast thou beat me,\nAnd wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter\nAs often as we eat. By the elements,\nIf e'er again I meet him beard to beard,\nHe's mine, or I am his: mine emulation\nHath not that honour in't it had; for where\nI thought to crush him in an equal force,\nTrue sword to sword, I'll potch at him some way\nOr wrath or craft may get him.\n\nFirst Soldier:\nHe's the devil.\n\nAUFIDIUS:\nBolder, though not so subtle. My valour's poison'd\nWith only suffering stain by him; for him\nShall fly out of itself: nor sleep nor sanctuary,\nBeing naked, sick, nor fane nor Capitol,\nThe prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice,\nEmbarquements all of fury, shall lift up\nTheir rotten privilege and custom 'gainst\nMy hate to Marcius: where I find him, were it\nAt home, upon my brother's guard, even there,\nAgainst the hospitable canon, would I\nWash my fierce hand in's heart. Go you to the city;\nLearn how 'tis held; and what they are that must\nBe hostages for Rome.\n\nFirst Soldier:\nWill not you go?\n\nAUFIDIUS:\nI am attended at the cypress grove: I pray you--\n'Tis south the city mills--bring me word thither\nHow the world goes, that to the pace of it\nI may spur on my journey.\n\nFirst Soldier:\nI shall, sir.\n\nMENENIUS:\nThe augurer tells me we shall have news to-night.\n\nBRUTUS:\nGood or bad?\n\nMENENIUS:\nNot according to the prayer of the people, for they\nlove not Marcius.\n\nSICINIUS:\nNature teaches beasts to know their friends.\n\nMENENIUS:\nPray you, who does the wolf love?\n\nSICINIUS:\nThe lamb.\n\nMENENIUS:\nAy, to devour him; as the hungry plebeians would the\nnoble Marcius.\n\nBRUTUS:\nHe's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear.\n\nMENENIUS:\nHe's a bear indeed, that lives like a lamb. You two\nare old men: tell me one thing that I shall ask you.\n\nBoth:\nWell, sir.\n\nMENENIUS:\nIn what enormity is Marcius poor in, that you two\nhave not in abundance?\n\nBRUTUS:\nHe's poor in no one fault, but stored with all.\n\nSICINIUS:\nEspecially in pride.\n\nBRUTUS:\nAnd topping all others in boasting.\n\nMENENIUS:\nThis is strange now: do you two know how you are\ncensured here in the city, I mean of us o' the\nright-hand file? do you?\n\nBoth:\nWhy, how are we censured?\n\nMENENIUS:\nBecause you talk of pride now,--will you not be angry?\n\nBoth:\nWell, well, sir, well.\n\nMENENIUS:\nWhy, 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief of\noccasion will rob you of a great deal of patience:\ngive your dispositions the reins, and be angry at\nyour pleasures; at the least if you take it as a\npleasure to you in being so. You blame Marcius for\nbeing proud?\n\nBRUTUS:\nWe do it not alone, sir.\n\nMENENIUS:\nI know you can do very little alone; for your helps\nare many, or else your actions would grow wondrous\nsingle: your abilities are too infant-like for\ndoing much alone. You talk of pride: O that you\ncould turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks,\nand make but an interior survey of your good selves!\nO that you could!\n\nBRUTUS:\nWhat then, sir?\n\nMENENIUS:\nWhy, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting,\nproud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, as\nany in Rome.\n\nSICINIUS:\nMenenius, you are known well enough too.\n\nMENENIUS:\nI am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that\nloves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying\nTiber in't; said to be something imperfect in\nfavouring the first complaint; hasty and tinder-like\nupon too trivial motion; one that converses more\nwith the buttock of the night than with the forehead\nof the morning: what I think I utter, and spend my\nmalice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen as\nyou are--I cannot call you Lycurguses--if the drink\nyou give me touch my palate adversely, I make a\ncrooked face at it. I can't say your worships have\ndelivered the matter well, when I find the ass in\ncompound with the major part of your syllables: and\nthough I must be content to bear with those that say\nyou are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that\ntell you you have good faces. If you see this in\nthe map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known\nwell enough too? what barm can your bisson\nconspectuities glean out of this character, if I be\nknown well enough too?\n\nBRUTUS:\nCome, sir, come, we know you well enough.\n\nMENENIUS:\nYou know neither me, yourselves nor any thing. You\nare ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs: you\nwear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a\ncause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller;\nand then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a\nsecond day of audience. When you are hearing a\nmatter between party and party, if you chance to be\npinched with the colic, you make faces like\nmummers; set up the bloody flag against all\npatience; and, in roaring for a chamber-pot,\ndismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled\nby your hearing: all the peace you make in their\ncause is, calling both the parties knaves. You are\na pair of strange ones.\n\nBRUTUS:\nCome, come, you are well understood to be a\nperfecter giber for the table than a necessary\nbencher in the Capitol.\n\nMENENIUS:\nOur very priests must become mockers, if they shall\nencounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When\nyou speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the\nwagging of your beards; and your beards deserve not\nso honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's\ncushion, or to be entombed in an ass's pack-\nsaddle. Yet you must be saying, Marcius is proud;\nwho in a cheap estimation, is worth predecessors\nsince Deucalion, though peradventure some of the\nbest of 'em were hereditary hangmen. God-den to\nyour worships: more of your conversation would\ninfect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly\nplebeians: I will be bold to take my leave of you.\nHow now, my as fair as noble ladies,--and the moon,\nwere she earthly, no nobler,--whither do you follow\nyour eyes so fast?\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nHonourable Menenius, my boy Marcius approaches; for\nthe love of Juno, let's go.\n\nMENENIUS:\nHa! Marcius coming home!\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nAy, worthy Menenius; and with most prosperous\napprobation.\n\nMENENIUS:\nTake my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee. Hoo!\nMarcius coming home!\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nNay,'tis true.\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nLook, here's a letter from him: the state hath\nanother, his wife another; and, I think, there's one\nat home for you.\n\nMENENIUS:\nI will make my very house reel tonight: a letter for\nme!\n\nVIRGILIA:\nYes, certain, there's a letter for you; I saw't.\n\nMENENIUS:\nA letter for me! it gives me an estate of seven\nyears' health; in which time I will make a lip at\nthe physician: the most sovereign prescription in\nGalen is but empiricutic, and, to this preservative,\nof no better report than a horse-drench. Is he\nnot wounded? he was wont to come home wounded.\n\nVIRGILIA:\nO, no, no, no.\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nO, he is wounded; I thank the gods for't.\n\nMENENIUS:\nSo do I too, if it be not too much: brings a'\nvictory in his pocket? the wounds become him.\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nOn's brows: Menenius, he comes the third time home\nwith the oaken garland.\n\nMENENIUS:\nHas he disciplined Aufidius soundly?\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nTitus Lartius writes, they fought together, but\nAufidius got off.\n\nMENENIUS:\nAnd 'twas time for him too, I'll warrant him that:\nan he had stayed by him, I would not have been so\nfidiused for all the chests in Corioli, and the gold\nthat's in them. Is the senate possessed of this?\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nGood ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes; the senate\nhas letters from the general, wherein he gives my\nson the whole name of the war: he hath in this\naction outdone his former deeds doubly\n\nVALERIA:\nIn troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.\n\nMENENIUS:\nWondrous! ay, I warrant you, and not without his\ntrue purchasing.\n\nVIRGILIA:\nThe gods grant them true!\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nTrue! pow, wow.\n\nMENENIUS:\nTrue! I'll be sworn they are true.\nWhere is he wounded?\nGod save your good worships! Marcius is coming\nhome: he has more cause to be proud. Where is he wounded?\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nI' the shoulder and i' the left arm there will be\nlarge cicatrices to show the people, when he shall\nstand for his place. He received in the repulse of\nTarquin seven hurts i' the body.\n\nMENENIUS:\nOne i' the neck, and two i' the thigh,--there's\nnine that I know.\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nHe had, before this last expedition, twenty-five\nwounds upon him.\n\nMENENIUS:\nNow it's twenty-seven: every gash was an enemy's grave.\nHark! the trumpets.\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nThese are the ushers of Marcius: before him he\ncarries noise, and behind him he leaves tears:\nDeath, that dark spirit, in 's nervy arm doth lie;\nWhich, being advanced, declines, and then men die.\n\nHerald:\nKnow, Rome, that all alone Marcius did fight\nWithin Corioli gates: where he hath won,\nWith fame, a name to Caius Marcius; these\nIn honour follows Coriolanus.\nWelcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!\n\nAll:\nWelcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nNo more of this; it does offend my heart:\nPray now, no more.\n\nCOMINIUS:\nLook, sir, your mother!\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nO,\nYou have, I know, petition'd all the gods\nFor my prosperity!\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nNay, my good soldier, up;\nMy gentle Marcius, worthy Caius, and\nBy deed-achieving honour newly named,--\nWhat is it?--Coriolanus must I call thee?--\nBut O, thy wife!\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nMy gracious silence, hail!\nWouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home,\nThat weep'st to see me triumph? Ay, my dear,\nSuch eyes the widows in Corioli wear,\nAnd mothers that lack sons.\n\nMENENIUS:\nNow, the gods crown thee!\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nAnd live you yet?\nO my sweet lady, pardon.\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nI know not where to turn: O, welcome home:\nAnd welcome, general: and ye're welcome all.\n\nMENENIUS:\nA hundred thousand welcomes. I could weep\nAnd I could laugh, I am light and heavy. Welcome.\nA curse begin at very root on's heart,\nThat is not glad to see thee! You are three\nThat Rome should dote on: yet, by the faith of men,\nWe have some old crab-trees here\nat home that will not\nBe grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors:\nWe call a nettle but a nettle and\nThe faults of fools but folly.\n\nCOMINIUS:\nEver right.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nMenenius ever, ever.\n\nHerald:\nGive way there, and go on!\n\nCORIOLANUS:\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nI have lived\nTo see inherited my very wishes\nAnd the buildings of my fancy: only\nThere's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but\nOur Rome will cast upon thee.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nKnow, good mother,\nI had rather be their servant in my way,\nThan sway with them in theirs.\n\nCOMINIUS:\nOn, to the Capitol!\n\nBRUTUS:\nAll tongues speak of him, and the bleared sights\nAre spectacled to see him: your prattling nurse\nInto a rapture lets her baby cry\nWhile she chats him: the kitchen malkin pins\nHer richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,\nClambering the walls to eye him: stalls, bulks, windows,\nAre smother'd up, leads fill'd, and ridges horsed\nWith variable complexions, all agreeing\nIn earnestness to see him: seld-shown flamens\nDo press among the popular throngs and puff\nTo win a vulgar station: or veil'd dames\nCommit the war of white and damask in\nTheir nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoil\nOf Phoebus' burning kisses: such a pother\nAs if that whatsoever god who leads him\nWere slily crept into his human powers\nAnd gave him graceful posture.\n\nSICINIUS:\nOn the sudden,\nI warrant him consul.\n\nBRUTUS:\nThen our office may,\nDuring his power, go sleep.\n\nSICINIUS:\nHe cannot temperately transport his honours\nFrom where he should begin and end, but will\nLose those he hath won.\n\nBRUTUS:\nIn that there's comfort.\n\nSICINIUS:\nDoubt not\nThe commoners, for whom we stand, but they\nUpon their ancient malice will forget\nWith the least cause these his new honours, which\nThat he will give them make I as little question\nAs he is proud to do't.\n\nBRUTUS:\nI heard him swear,\nWere he to stand for consul, never would he\nAppear i' the market-place nor on him put\nThe napless vesture of humility;\nNor showing, as the manner is, his wounds\nTo the people, beg their stinking breaths.\n\nSICINIUS:\n'Tis right.\n\nBRUTUS:\nIt was his word: O, he would miss it rather\nThan carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him,\nAnd the desire of the nobles.\n\nSICINIUS:\nI wish no better\nThan have him hold that purpose and to put it\nIn execution.\n\nBRUTUS:\n'Tis most like he will.\n\nSICINIUS:\nIt shall be to him then as our good wills,\nA sure destruction.\n\nBRUTUS:\nSo it must fall out\nTo him or our authorities. For an end,\nWe must suggest the people in what hatred\nHe still hath held them; that to's power he would\nHave made them mules, silenced their pleaders and\nDispropertied their freedoms, holding them,\nIn human action and capacity,\nOf no more soul nor fitness for the world\nThan camels in the war, who have their provand\nOnly for bearing burdens, and sore blows\nFor sinking under them.\n\nSICINIUS:\nThis, as you say, suggested\nAt some time when his soaring insolence\nShall touch the people--which time shall not want,\nIf he be put upon 't; and that's as easy\nAs to set dogs on sheep--will be his fire\nTo kindle their dry stubble; and their blaze\nShall darken him for ever.\n\nBRUTUS:\nWhat's the matter?\n\nMessenger:\nYou are sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis thought\nThat Marcius shall be consul:\nI have seen the dumb men throng to see him and\nThe blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,\nLadies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,\nUpon him as he pass'd: the nobles bended,\nAs to Jove's statue, and the commons made\nA shower and thunder with their caps and shouts:\nI never saw the like.\n\nBRUTUS:\nLet's to the Capitol;\nAnd carry with us ears and eyes for the time,\nBut hearts for the event.\n\nSICINIUS:\nHave with you.\n\nFirst Officer:\nCome, come, they are almost here. How many stand\nfor consulships?\n\nSecond Officer:\nThree, they say: but 'tis thought of every one\nCoriolanus will carry it.\n\nFirst Officer:\nThat's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud, and\nloves not the common people.\n\nSecond Officer:\nFaith, there had been many great men that have\nflattered the people, who ne'er loved them; and there\nbe many that they have loved, they know not\nwherefore: so that, if they love they know not why,\nthey hate upon no better a ground: therefore, for\nCoriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate\nhim manifests the true knowledge he has in their\ndisposition; and out of his noble carelessness lets\nthem plainly see't.\n\nFirst Officer:\nIf he did not care whether he had their love or no,\nhe waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither\ngood nor harm: but he seeks their hate with greater\ndevotion than can render it him; and leaves\nnothing undone that may fully discover him their\nopposite. Now, to seem to affect the malice and\ndispleasure of the people is as bad as that which he\ndislikes, to flatter them for their love.\n\nSecond Officer:\nHe hath deserved worthily of his country: and his\nascent is not by such easy degrees as those who,\nhaving been supple and courteous to the people,\nbonneted, without any further deed to have them at\nan into their estimation and report: but he hath so\nplanted his honours in their eyes, and his actions\nin their hearts, that for their tongues to be\nsilent, and not confess so much, were a kind of\ningrateful injury; to report otherwise, were a\nmalice, that, giving itself the lie, would pluck\nreproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it.\n\nFirst Officer:\nNo more of him; he is a worthy man: make way, they\nare coming.\n\nMENENIUS:\nHaving determined of the Volsces and\nTo send for Titus Lartius, it remains,\nAs the main point of this our after-meeting,\nTo gratify his noble service that\nHath thus stood for his country: therefore,\nplease you,\nMost reverend and grave elders, to desire\nThe present consul, and last general\nIn our well-found successes, to report\nA little of that worthy work perform'd\nBy Caius Marcius Coriolanus, whom\nWe met here both to thank and to remember\nWith honours like himself.\n\nFirst Senator:\nSpeak, good Cominius:\nLeave nothing out for length, and make us think\nRather our state's defective for requital\nThan we to stretch it out.\nMasters o' the people,\nWe do request your kindest ears, and after,\nYour loving motion toward the common body,\nTo yield what passes here.\n\nSICINIUS:\nWe are convented\nUpon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts\nInclinable to honour and advance\nThe theme of our assembly.\n\nBRUTUS:\nWhich the rather\nWe shall be blest to do, if he remember\nA kinder value of the people than\nHe hath hereto prized them at.\n\nMENENIUS:\nThat's off, that's off;\nI would you rather had been silent. Please you\nTo hear Cominius speak?\n\nBRUTUS:\nMost willingly;\nBut yet my caution was more pertinent\nThan the rebuke you give it.\n\nMENENIUS:\nHe loves your people\nBut tie him not to be their bedfellow.\nWorthy Cominius, speak.\nNay, keep your place.\n\nFirst Senator:\nSit, Coriolanus; never shame to hear\nWhat you have nobly done.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nYour horror's pardon:\nI had rather have my wounds to heal again\nThan hear say how I got them.\n\nBRUTUS:\nSir, I hope\nMy words disbench'd you not.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nNo, sir: yet oft,\nWhen blows have made me stay, I fled from words.\nYou soothed not, therefore hurt not: but\nyour people,\nI love them as they weigh.\n\nMENENIUS:\nPray now, sit down.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nI had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun\nWhen the alarum were struck than idly sit\nTo hear my nothings monster'd.\n\nMENENIUS:\nMasters of the people,\nYour multiplying spawn how can he flatter--\nThat's thousand to one good one--when you now see\nHe had rather venture all his limbs for honour\nThan one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius.\n\nCOMINIUS:\nI shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus\nShould not be utter'd feebly. It is held\nThat valour is the chiefest virtue, and\nMost dignifies the haver: if it be,\nThe man I speak of cannot in the world\nBe singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,\nWhen Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought\nBeyond the mark of others: our then dictator,\nWhom with all praise I point at, saw him fight,\nWhen with his Amazonian chin he drove\nThe bristled lips before him: be bestrid\nAn o'er-press'd Roman and i' the consul's view\nSlew three opposers: Tarquin's self he met,\nAnd struck him on his knee: in that day's feats,\nWhen he might act the woman in the scene,\nHe proved best man i' the field, and for his meed\nWas brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age\nMan-enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea,\nAnd in the brunt of seventeen battles since\nHe lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last,\nBefore and in Corioli, let me say,\nI cannot speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers;\nAnd by his rare example made the coward\nTurn terror into sport: as weeds before\nA vessel under sail, so men obey'd\nAnd fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp,\nWhere it did mark, it took; from face to foot\nHe was a thing of blood, whose every motion\nWas timed with dying cries: alone he enter'd\nThe mortal gate of the city, which he painted\nWith shunless destiny; aidless came off,\nAnd with a sudden reinforcement struck\nCorioli like a planet: now all's his:\nWhen, by and by, the din of war gan pierce\nHis ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit\nRe-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate,\nAnd to the battle came he; where he did\nRun reeking o'er the lives of men, as if\n'Twere a perpetual spoil: and till we call'd\nBoth field and city ours, he never stood\nTo ease his breast with panting.\n\nMENENIUS:\nWorthy man!\n\nFirst Senator:\nHe cannot but with measure fit the honours\nWhich we devise him.\n\nCOMINIUS:\nOur spoils he kick'd at,\nAnd look'd upon things precious as they were\nThe common muck of the world: he covets less\nThan misery itself would give; rewards\nHis deeds with doing them, and is content\nTo spend the time to end it.\n\nMENENIUS:\nHe's right noble:\nLet him be call'd for.\n\nFirst Senator:\nCall Coriolanus.\n\nOfficer:\nHe doth appear.\n\nMENENIUS:\nThe senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased\nTo make thee consul.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nI do owe them still\nMy life and services.\n\nMENENIUS:\nIt then remains\nThat you do speak to the people.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nI do beseech you,\nLet me o'erleap that custom, for I cannot\nPut on the gown, stand naked and entreat them,\nFor my wounds' sake, to give their suffrage: please you\nThat I may pass this doing.\n\nSICINIUS:\nSir, the people\nMust have their voices; neither will they bate\nOne jot of ceremony.\n\nMENENIUS:\nPut them not to't:\nPray you, go fit you to the custom and\nTake to you, as your predecessors have,\nYour honour with your form.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nIt is apart\nThat I shall blush in acting, and might well\nBe taken from the people.\n\nBRUTUS:\nMark you that?\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nTo brag unto them, thus I did, and thus;\nShow them the unaching scars which I should hide,\nAs if I had received them for the hire\nOf their breath only!\n\nMENENIUS:\nDo not stand upon't.\nWe recommend to you, tribunes of the people,\nOur purpose to them: and to our noble consul\nWish we all joy and honour.\n\nSenators:\nTo Coriolanus come all joy and honour!\n\nBRUTUS:\nYou see how he intends to use the people.\n\nSICINIUS:\nMay they perceive's intent! He will require them,\nAs if he did contemn what he requested\nShould be in them to give.\n\nBRUTUS:\nCome, we'll inform them\nOf our proceedings here: on the marketplace,\nI know, they do attend us.\n\nFirst Citizen:\nOnce, if he do require our voices, we ought not to deny him.\n\nSecond Citizen:\nWe may, sir, if we will.\n\nThird Citizen:\nWe have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a\npower that we have no power to do; for if he show us\nhis wounds and tell us his deeds, we are to put our\ntongues into those wounds and speak for them; so, if\nhe tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell him\nour noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is\nmonstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful,\nwere to make a monster of the multitude: of the\nwhich we being members, should bring ourselves to be\nmonstrous members.\n\nFirst Citizen:\nAnd to make us no better thought of, a little help\nwill serve; for once we stood up about the corn, he\nhimself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude.\n\nThird Citizen:\nWe have been called so of many; not that our heads\nare some brown, some black, some auburn, some bald,\nbut that our wits are so diversely coloured: and\ntruly I think if all our wits were to issue out of\none skull, they would fly east, west, north, south,\nand their consent of one direct way should be at\nonce to all the points o' the compass.\n\nSecond Citizen:\nThink you so? Which way do you judge my wit would\nfly?\n\nThird Citizen:\nNay, your wit will not so soon out as another man's\nwill;'tis strongly wedged up in a block-head, but\nif it were at liberty, 'twould, sure, southward.\n\nSecond Citizen:\nWhy that way?\n\nThird Citizen:\nTo lose itself in a fog, where being three parts\nmelted away with rotten dews, the fourth would return\nfor conscience sake, to help to get thee a wife.\n\nSecond Citizen:\nYou are never without your tricks: you may, you may.\n\nThird Citizen:\nAre you all resolved to give your voices? But\nthat's no matter, the greater part carries it. I\nsay, if he would incline to the people, there was\nnever a worthier man.\nHere he comes, and in the gown of humility: mark his\nbehavior. We are not to stay all together, but to\ncome by him where he stands, by ones, by twos, and\nby threes. He's to make his requests by\nparticulars; wherein every one of us has a single\nhonour, in giving him our own voices with our own\ntongues: therefore follow me, and I direct you how\nyou shall go by him.\n\nAll:\nContent, content.\n\nMENENIUS:\nO sir, you are not right: have you not known\nThe worthiest men have done't?\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nWhat must I say?\n'I Pray, sir'--Plague upon't! I cannot bring\nMy tongue to such a pace:--'Look, sir, my wounds!\nI got them in my country's service, when\nSome certain of your brethren roar'd and ran\nFrom the noise of our own drums.'\n\nMENENIUS:\nO me, the gods!\nYou must not speak of that: you must desire them\nTo think upon you.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nThink upon me! hang 'em!\nI would they would forget me, like the virtues\nWhich our divines lose by 'em.\n\nMENENIUS:\nYou'll mar all:\nI'll leave you: pray you, speak to 'em, I pray you,\nIn wholesome manner.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nBid them wash their faces\nAnd keep their teeth clean.\nSo, here comes a brace.\nYou know the cause, air, of my standing here.\n\nThird Citizen:\nWe do, sir; tell us what hath brought you to't.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nMine own desert.\n\nSecond Citizen:\nYour own desert!\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nAy, but not mine own desire.\n\nThird Citizen:\nHow not your own desire?\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nNo, sir,'twas never my desire yet to trouble the\npoor with begging.\n\nThird Citizen:\nYou must think, if we give you any thing, we hope to\ngain by you.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nWell then, I pray, your price o' the consulship?\n\nFirst Citizen:\nThe price is to ask it kindly.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nKindly! Sir, I pray, let me ha't: I have wounds to\nshow you, which shall be yours in private. Your\ngood voice, sir; what say you?\n\nSecond Citizen:\nYou shall ha' it, worthy sir.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nA match, sir. There's in all two worthy voices\nbegged. I have your alms: adieu.\n\nThird Citizen:\nBut this is something odd.\n\nSecond Citizen:\nAn 'twere to give again,--but 'tis no matter.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nPray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your\nvoices that I may be consul, I have here the\ncustomary gown.\n\nFourth Citizen:\nYou have deserved nobly of your country, and you\nhave not deserved nobly.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nYour enigma?\n\nFourth Citizen:\nYou have been a scourge to her enemies, you have\nbeen a rod to her friends; you have not indeed loved\nthe common people.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nYou should account me the more virtuous that I have\nnot been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter my\nsworn brother, the people, to earn a dearer\nestimation of them; 'tis a condition they account\ngentle: and since the wisdom of their choice is\nrather to have my hat than my heart, I will practise\nthe insinuating nod and be off to them most\ncounterfeitly; that is, sir, I will counterfeit the\nbewitchment of some popular man and give it\nbountiful to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you,\nI may be consul.\n\nFifth Citizen:\nWe hope to find you our friend; and therefore give\nyou our voices heartily.\n\nFourth Citizen:\nYou have received many wounds for your country.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nI will not seal your knowledge with showing them. I\nwill make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further.\n\nBoth Citizens:\nThe gods give you joy, sir, heartily!\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nMost sweet voices!\nBetter it is to die, better to starve,\nThan crave the hire which first we do deserve.\nWhy in this woolvish toge should I stand here,\nTo beg of Hob and Dick, that do appear,\nTheir needless vouches? Custom calls me to't:\nWhat custom wills, in all things should we do't,\nThe dust on antique time would lie unswept,\nAnd mountainous error be too highly heapt\nFor truth to o'er-peer. Rather than fool it so,\nLet the high office and the honour go\nTo one that would do thus. I am half through;\nThe one part suffer'd, the other will I do.\nHere come more voices.\nYour voices: for your voices I have fought;\nWatch'd for your voices; for Your voices bear\nOf wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six\nI have seen and heard of; for your voices have\nDone many things, some less, some more your voices:\nIndeed I would be consul.\n\nSixth Citizen:\nHe has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest\nman's voice.\n\nSeventh Citizen:\nTherefore let him be consul: the gods give him joy,\nand make him good friend to the people!\n\nAll Citizens:\nAmen, amen. God save thee, noble consul!\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nWorthy voices!\n\nMENENIUS:\nYou have stood your limitation; and the tribunes\nEndue you with the people's voice: remains\nThat, in the official marks invested, you\nAnon do meet the senate.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nIs this done?\n\nSICINIUS:\nThe custom of request you have discharged:\nThe people do admit you, and are summon'd\nTo meet anon, upon your approbation.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nWhere? at the senate-house?\n\nSICINIUS:\nThere, Coriolanus.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nMay I change these garments?\n\nSICINIUS:\nYou may, sir.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nThat I'll straight do; and, knowing myself again,\nRepair to the senate-house.\n\nMENENIUS:\nI'll keep you company. Will you along?\n\nBRUTUS:\nWe stay here for the people.\n\nSICINIUS:\nFare you well.\nHe has it now, and by his looks methink\n'Tis warm at 's heart.\n\nBRUTUS:\nWith a proud heart he wore his humble weeds.\nwill you dismiss the people?\n\nSICINIUS:\nHow now, my masters! have you chose this man?\n\nFirst Citizen:\nHe has our voices, sir.\n\nBRUTUS:\nWe pray the gods he may deserve your loves.\n\nSecond Citizen:\nAmen, sir: to my poor unworthy notice,\nHe mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.\n\nThird Citizen:\nCertainly\nHe flouted us downright.\n\nFirst Citizen:\nNo,'tis his kind of speech: he did not mock us.\n\nSecond Citizen:\nNot one amongst us, save yourself, but says\nHe used us scornfully: he should have show'd us\nHis marks of merit, wounds received for's country.\n\nSICINIUS:\nWhy, so he did, I am sure.\n\nCitizens:\nNo, no; no man saw 'em.\n\nThird Citizen:\nHe said he had wounds, which he could show\nin private;\nAnd with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,\n'I would be consul,' says he: 'aged custom,\nBut by your voices, will not so permit me;\nYour voices therefore.' When we granted that,\nHere was 'I thank you for your voices: thank you:\nYour most sweet voices: now you have left\nyour voices,\nI have no further with you.' Was not this mockery?\n\nSICINIUS:\nWhy either were you ignorant to see't,\nOr, seeing it, of such childish friendliness\nTo yield your voices?\n\nBRUTUS:\nCould you not have told him\nAs you were lesson'd, when he had no power,\nBut was a petty servant to the state,\nHe was your enemy, ever spake against\nYour liberties and the charters that you bear\nI' the body of the weal; and now, arriving\nA place of potency and sway o' the state,\nIf he should still malignantly remain\nFast foe to the plebeii, your voices might\nBe curses to yourselves? You should have said\nThat as his worthy deeds did claim no less\nThan what he stood for, so his gracious nature\nWould think upon you for your voices and\nTranslate his malice towards you into love,\nStanding your friendly lord.\n\nSICINIUS:\nThus to have said,\nAs you were fore-advised, had touch'd his spirit\nAnd tried his inclination; from him pluck'd\nEither his gracious promise, which you might,\nAs cause had call'd you up, have held him to\nOr else it would have gall'd his surly nature,\nWhich easily endures not article\nTying him to aught; so putting him to rage,\nYou should have ta'en the advantage of his choler\nAnd pass'd him unelected.\n\nBRUTUS:\nDid you perceive\nHe did solicit you in free contempt\nWhen he did need your loves, and do you think\nThat his contempt shall not be bruising to you,\nWhen he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies\nNo heart among you? or had you tongues to cry\nAgainst the rectorship of judgment?\n\nSICINIUS:\nHave you\nEre now denied the asker? and now again\nOf him that did not ask, but mock, bestow\nYour sued-for tongues?\n\nThird Citizen:\nHe's not confirm'd; we may deny him yet.\n\nSecond Citizen:\nAnd will deny him:\nI'll have five hundred voices of that sound.\n\nFirst Citizen:\nI twice five hundred and their friends to piece 'em.\n\nBRUTUS:\nGet you hence instantly, and tell those friends,\nThey have chose a consul that will from them take\nTheir liberties; make them of no more voice\nThan dogs that are as often beat for barking\nAs therefore kept to do so.\n\nSICINIUS:\nLet them assemble,\nAnd on a safer judgment all revoke\nYour ignorant election; enforce his pride,\nAnd his old hate unto you; besides, forget not\nWith what contempt he wore the humble weed,\nHow in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,\nThinking upon his services, took from you\nThe apprehension of his present portance,\nWhich most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion\nAfter the inveterate hate he bears you.\n\nBRUTUS:\nLay\nA fault on us, your tribunes; that we laboured,\nNo impediment between, but that you must\nCast your election on him.\n\nSICINIUS:\nSay, you chose him\nMore after our commandment than as guided\nBy your own true affections, and that your minds,\nPreoccupied with what you rather must do\nThan what you should, made you against the grain\nTo voice him consul: lay the fault on us.\n\nBRUTUS:\nAy, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you.\nHow youngly he began to serve his country,\nHow long continued, and what stock he springs of,\nThe noble house o' the Marcians, from whence came\nThat Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son,\nWho, after great Hostilius, here was king;\nOf the same house Publius and Quintus were,\nThat our beat water brought by conduits hither;\nAnd  \nTwice being  \nWas his great ancestor.\n\nSICINIUS:\nOne thus descended,\nThat hath beside well in his person wrought\nTo be set high in place, we did commend\nTo your remembrances: but you have found,\nScaling his present bearing with his past,\nThat he's your fixed enemy, and revoke\nYour sudden approbation.\n\nBRUTUS:\nSay, you ne'er had done't--\nHarp on that still--but by our putting on;\nAnd presently, when you have drawn your number,\nRepair to the Capitol.\n\nAll:\nWe will so: almost all\nRepent in their election.\n\nBRUTUS:\nLet them go on;\nThis mutiny were better put in hazard,\nThan stay, past doubt, for greater:\nIf, as his nature is, he fall in rage\nWith their refusal, both observe and answer\nThe vantage of his anger.\n\nSICINIUS:\nTo the Capitol, come:\nWe will be there before the stream o' the people;\nAnd this shall seem, as partly 'tis, their own,\nWhich we have goaded onward.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nTullus Aufidius then had made new head?\n\nLARTIUS:\nHe had, my lord; and that it was which caused\nOur swifter composition.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nSo then the Volsces stand but as at first,\nReady, when time shall prompt them, to make road.\nUpon's again.\n\nCOMINIUS:\nThey are worn, lord consul, so,\nThat we shall hardly in our ages see\nTheir banners wave again.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nSaw you Aufidius?\n\nLARTIUS:\nOn safe-guard he came to me; and did curse\nAgainst the Volsces, for they had so vilely\nYielded the town: he is retired to Antium.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nSpoke he of me?\n\nLARTIUS:\nHe did, my lord.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nHow? what?\n\nLARTIUS:\nHow often he had met you, sword to sword;\nThat of all things upon the earth he hated\nYour person most, that he would pawn his fortunes\nTo hopeless restitution, so he might\nBe call'd your vanquisher.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nAt Antium lives he?\n\nLARTIUS:\nAt Antium.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nI wish I had a cause to seek him there,\nTo oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.\nBehold, these are the tribunes of the people,\nThe tongues o' the common mouth: I do despise them;\nFor they do prank them in authority,\nAgainst all noble sufferance.\n\nSICINIUS:\nPass no further.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nHa! what is that?\n\nBRUTUS:\nIt will be dangerous to go on: no further.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nWhat makes this change?\n\nMENENIUS:\nThe matter?\n\nCOMINIUS:\nHath he not pass'd the noble and the common?\n\nBRUTUS:\nCominius, no.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nHave I had children's voices?\n\nFirst Senator:\nTribunes, give way; he shall to the market-place.\n\nBRUTUS:\nThe people are incensed against him.\n\nSICINIUS:\nStop,\nOr all will fall in broil.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nAre these your herd?\nMust these have voices, that can yield them now\nAnd straight disclaim their tongues? What are\nyour offices?\nYou being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?\nHave you not set them on?\n\nMENENIUS:\nBe calm, be calm.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nIt is a purposed thing, and grows by plot,\nTo curb the will of the nobility:\nSuffer't, and live with such as cannot rule\nNor ever will be ruled.\n\nBRUTUS:\nCall't not a plot:\nThe people cry you mock'd them, and of late,\nWhen corn was given them gratis, you repined;\nScandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd them\nTime-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nWhy, this was known before.\n\nBRUTUS:\nNot to them all.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nHave you inform'd them sithence?\n\nBRUTUS:\nHow! I inform them!\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nYou are like to do such business.\n\nBRUTUS:\nNot unlike,\nEach way, to better yours.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nWhy then should I be consul? By yond clouds,\nLet me deserve so ill as you, and make me\nYour fellow tribune.\n\nSICINIUS:\nYou show too much of that\nFor which the people stir: if you will pass\nTo where you are bound, you must inquire your way,\nWhich you are out of, with a gentler spirit,\nOr never be so noble as a consul,\nNor yoke with him for tribune.\n\nMENENIUS:\nLet's be calm.\n\nCOMINIUS:\nThe people are abused; set on. This paltering\nBecomes not Rome, nor has Coriolanus\nDeserved this so dishonour'd rub, laid falsely\nI' the plain way of his merit.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nTell me of corn!\nThis was my speech, and I will speak't again--\n\nMENENIUS:\nNot now, not now.\n\nFirst Senator:\nNot in this heat, sir, now.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nNow, as I live, I will. My nobler friends,\nI crave their pardons:\nFor the mutable, rank-scented many, let them\nRegard me as I do not flatter, and\nTherein behold themselves: I say again,\nIn soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senate\nThe cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,\nWhich we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd,\nand scatter'd,\nBy mingling them with us, the honour'd number,\nWho lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that\nWhich they have given to beggars.\n\nMENENIUS:\nWell, no more.\n\nFirst Senator:\nNo more words, we beseech you.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nHow! no more!\nAs for my country I have shed my blood,\nNot fearing outward force, so shall my lungs\nCoin words till their decay against those measles,\nWhich we disdain should tatter us, yet sought\nThe very way to catch them.\n\nBRUTUS:\nYou speak o' the people,\nAs if you were a god to punish, not\nA man of their infirmity.\n\nSICINIUS:\n'Twere well\nWe let the people know't.\n\nMENENIUS:\nWhat, what? his choler?\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nCholer!\nWere I as patient as the midnight sleep,\nBy Jove, 'twould be my mind!\n\nSICINIUS:\nIt is a mind\nThat shall remain a poison where it is,\nNot poison any further.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nShall remain!\nHear you this Triton of the minnows? mark you\nHis absolute 'shall'?\n\nCOMINIUS:\n'Twas from the canon.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\n'Shall'!\nO good but most unwise patricians! why,\nYou grave but reckless senators, have you thus\nGiven Hydra here to choose an officer,\nThat with his peremptory 'shall,' being but\nThe horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spirit\nTo say he'll turn your current in a ditch,\nAnd make your channel his? If he have power\nThen vail your ignorance; if none, awake\nYour dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,\nBe not as common fools; if you are not,\nLet them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,\nIf they be senators: and they are no less,\nWhen, both your voices blended, the great'st taste\nMost palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,\nAnd such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'\nHis popular 'shall' against a graver bench\nThan ever frown in Greece. By Jove himself!\nIt makes the consuls base: and my soul aches\nTo know, when two authorities are up,\nNeither supreme, how soon confusion\nMay enter 'twixt the gap of both and take\nThe one by the other.\n\nCOMINIUS:\nWell, on to the market-place.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nWhoever gave that counsel, to give forth\nThe corn o' the storehouse gratis, as 'twas used\nSometime in Greece,--\n\nMENENIUS:\nWell, well, no more of that.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nThough there the people had more absolute power,\nI say, they nourish'd disobedience, fed\nThe ruin of the state.\n\nBRUTUS:\nWhy, shall the people give\nOne that speaks thus their voice?\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nI'll give my reasons,\nMore worthier than their voices. They know the corn\nWas not our recompense, resting well assured\nThat ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war,\nEven when the navel of the state was touch'd,\nThey would not thread the gates. This kind of service\nDid not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the war\nTheir mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd\nMost valour, spoke not for them: the accusation\nWhich they have often made against the senate,\nAll cause unborn, could never be the motive\nOf our so frank donation. Well, what then?\nHow shall this bisson multitude digest\nThe senate's courtesy? Let deeds express\nWhat's like to be their words: 'we did request it;\nWe are the greater poll, and in true fear\nThey gave us our demands.' Thus we debase\nThe nature of our seats and make the rabble\nCall our cares fears; which will in time\nBreak ope the locks o' the senate and bring in\nThe crows to peck the eagles.\n\nMENENIUS:\nCome, enough.\n\nBRUTUS:\nEnough, with over-measure.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nNo, take more:\nWhat may be sworn by, both divine and human,\nSeal what I end withal! This double worship,\nWhere one part does disdain with cause, the other\nInsult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom,\nCannot conclude but by the yea and no\nOf general ignorance,--it must omit\nReal necessities, and give way the while\nTo unstable slightness: purpose so barr'd,\nit follows,\nNothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you,--\nYou that will be less fearful than discreet,\nThat love the fundamental part of state\nMore than you doubt the change on't, that prefer\nA noble life before a long, and wish\nTo jump a body with a dangerous physic\nThat's sure of death without it, at once pluck out\nThe multitudinous tongue; let them not lick\nThe sweet which is their poison: your dishonour\nMangles true judgment and bereaves the state\nOf that integrity which should become't,\nNot having the power to do the good it would,\nFor the in which doth control't.\n\nBRUTUS:\nHas said enough.\n\nSICINIUS:\nHas spoken like a traitor, and shall answer\nAs traitors do.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nThou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!\nWhat should the people do with these bald tribunes?\nOn whom depending, their obedience fails\nTo the greater bench: in a rebellion,\nWhen what's not meet, but what must be, was law,\nThen were they chosen: in a better hour,\nLet what is meet be said it must be meet,\nAnd throw their power i' the dust.\n\nBRUTUS:\nManifest treason!\n\nSICINIUS:\nThis a consul? no.\n\nBRUTUS:\nThe aediles, ho!\nLet him be apprehended.\n\nSICINIUS:\nGo, call the people:\nin whose name myself\nAttach thee as a traitorous innovator,\nA foe to the public weal: obey, I charge thee,\nAnd follow to thine answer.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nHence, old goat!\n\nSenators, &C:\nWe'll surety him.\n\nCOMINIUS:\nAged sir, hands off.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nHence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones\nOut of thy garments.\n\nSICINIUS:\nHelp, ye citizens!\n\nMENENIUS:\nOn both sides more respect.\n\nSICINIUS:\nHere's he that would take from you all your power.\n\nBRUTUS:\nSeize him, AEdiles!\n\nCitizens:\nDown with him! down with him!\n\nSenators, &C:\nWeapons, weapons, weapons!\n'Tribunes!' 'Patricians!' 'Citizens!' 'What, ho!'\n'Sicinius!' 'Brutus!' 'Coriolanus!' 'Citizens!'\n'Peace, peace, peace!' 'Stay, hold, peace!'\n\nMENENIUS:\nWhat is about to be? I am out of breath;\nConfusion's near; I cannot speak. You, tribunes\nTo the people! Coriolanus, patience!\nSpeak, good Sicinius.\n\nSICINIUS:\nHear me, people; peace!\n\nCitizens:\nLet's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak.\n\nSICINIUS:\nYou are at point to lose your liberties:\nMarcius would have all from you; Marcius,\nWhom late you have named for consul.\n\nMENENIUS:\nFie, fie, fie!\nThis is the way to kindle, not to quench.\n\nFirst Senator:\nTo unbuild the city and to lay all flat.\n\nSICINIUS:\nWhat is the city but the people?\n\nCitizens:\nTrue,\nThe people are the city.\n\nBRUTUS:\nBy the consent of all, we were establish'd\nThe people's magistrates.\n\nCitizens:\nYou so remain.\n\nMENENIUS:\nAnd so are like to do.\n\nCOMINIUS:\nThat is the way to lay the city flat;\nTo bring the roof to the foundation,\nAnd bury all, which yet distinctly ranges,\nIn heaps and piles of ruin.\n\nSICINIUS:\nThis deserves death.\n\nBRUTUS:\nOr let us stand to our authority,\nOr let us lose it. We do here pronounce,\nUpon the part o' the people, in whose power\nWe were elected theirs, Marcius is worthy\nOf present death.\n\nSICINIUS:\nTherefore lay hold of him;\nBear him to the rock Tarpeian, and from thence\nInto destruction cast him.\n\nBRUTUS:\nAEdiles, seize him!\n\nCitizens:\nYield, Marcius, yield!\n\nMENENIUS:\nHear me one word;\nBeseech you, tribunes, hear me but a word.\n\nAEdile:\nPeace, peace!\n\nMENENIUS:\n\nBRUTUS:\nSir, those cold ways,\nThat seem like prudent helps, are very poisonous\nWhere the disease is violent. Lay hands upon him,\nAnd bear him to the rock.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nNo, I'll die here.\nThere's some among you have beheld me fighting:\nCome, try upon yourselves what you have seen me.\n\nMENENIUS:\nDown with that sword! Tribunes, withdraw awhile.\n\nBRUTUS:\nLay hands upon him.\n\nCOMINIUS:\nHelp Marcius, help,\nYou that be noble; help him, young and old!\n\nCitizens:\nDown with him, down with him!\n\nMENENIUS:\nGo, get you to your house; be gone, away!\nAll will be naught else.\n\nSecond Senator:\nGet you gone.\n\nCOMINIUS:\nStand fast;\nWe have as many friends as enemies.\n\nMENENIUS:\nSham it be put to that?\n\nFirst Senator:\nThe gods forbid!\nI prithee, noble friend, home to thy house;\nLeave us to cure this cause.\n\nMENENIUS:\nFor 'tis a sore upon us,\nYou cannot tent yourself: be gone, beseech you.\n\nCOMINIUS:\nCome, sir, along with us.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nI would they were barbarians--as they are,\nThough in Rome litter'd--not Romans--as they are not,\nThough calved i' the porch o' the Capitol--\n\nMENENIUS:\nBe gone;\nPut not your worthy rage into your tongue;\nOne time will owe another.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nOn fair ground\nI could beat forty of them.\n\nCOMINIUS:\nI could myself\nTake up a brace o' the best of them; yea, the\ntwo tribunes:\nBut now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic;\nAnd manhood is call'd foolery, when it stands\nAgainst a falling fabric. Will you hence,\nBefore the tag return? whose rage doth rend\nLike interrupted waters and o'erbear\nWhat they are used to bear.\n\nMENENIUS:\nPray you, be gone:\nI'll try whether my old wit be in request\nWith those that have but little: this must be patch'd\nWith cloth of any colour.\n\nCOMINIUS:\nNay, come away.\n\nA Patrician:\nThis man has marr'd his fortune.\n\nMENENIUS:\nHis nature is too noble for the world:\nHe would not flatter Neptune for his trident,\nOr Jove for's power to thunder. His heart's his mouth:\nWhat his breast forges, that his tongue must vent;\nAnd, being angry, does forget that ever\nHe heard the name of death.\nHere's goodly work!\n\nSecond Patrician:\nI would they were abed!\n\nMENENIUS:\nI would they were in Tiber! What the vengeance!\nCould he not speak 'em fair?\n\nSICINIUS:\nWhere is this viper\nThat would depopulate the city and\nBe every man himself?\n\nMENENIUS:\nYou worthy tribunes,--\n\nSICINIUS:\nHe shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock\nWith rigorous hands: he hath resisted law,\nAnd therefore law shall scorn him further trial\nThan the severity of the public power\nWhich he so sets at nought.\n\nFirst Citizen:\nHe shall well know\nThe noble tribunes are the people's mouths,\nAnd we their hands.\n\nCitizens:\nHe shall, sure on't.\n\nMENENIUS:\nSir, sir,--\n\nSICINIUS:\nPeace!\n\nMENENIUS:\nDo not cry havoc, where you should but hunt\nWith modest warrant.\n\nSICINIUS:\nSir, how comes't that you\nHave holp to make this rescue?\n\nMENENIUS:\nHear me speak:\nAs I do know the consul's worthiness,\nSo can I name his faults,--\n\nSICINIUS:\nConsul! what consul?\n\nMENENIUS:\nThe consul Coriolanus.\n\nBRUTUS:\nHe consul!\n\nCitizens:\nNo, no, no, no, no.\n\nMENENIUS:\nIf, by the tribunes' leave, and yours, good people,\nI may be heard, I would crave a word or two;\nThe which shall turn you to no further harm\nThan so much loss of time.\n\nSICINIUS:\nSpeak briefly then;\nFor we are peremptory to dispatch\nThis viperous traitor: to eject him hence\nWere but one danger, and to keep him here\nOur certain death: therefore it is decreed\nHe dies to-night.\n\nMENENIUS:\nNow the good gods forbid\nThat our renowned Rome, whose gratitude\nTowards her deserved children is enroll'd\nIn Jove's own book, like an unnatural dam\nShould now eat up her own!\n\nSICINIUS:\nHe's a disease that must be cut away.\n\nMENENIUS:\nO, he's a limb that has but a disease;\nMortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy.\nWhat has he done to Rome that's worthy death?\nKilling our enemies, the blood he hath lost--\nWhich, I dare vouch, is more than that he hath,\nBy many an ounce--he dropp'd it for his country;\nAnd what is left, to lose it by his country,\nWere to us all, that do't and suffer it,\nA brand to the end o' the world.\n\nSICINIUS:\nThis is clean kam.\n\nBRUTUS:\nMerely awry: when he did love his country,\nIt honour'd him.\n\nMENENIUS:\nThe service of the foot\nBeing once gangrened, is not then respected\nFor what before it was.\n\nBRUTUS:\nWe'll hear no more.\nPursue him to his house, and pluck him thence:\nLest his infection, being of catching nature,\nSpread further.\n\nMENENIUS:\nOne word more, one word.\nThis tiger-footed rage, when it shall find\nThe harm of unscann'd swiftness, will too late\nTie leaden pounds to's heels. Proceed by process;\nLest parties, as he is beloved, break out,\nAnd sack great Rome with Romans.\n\nBRUTUS:\nIf it were so,--\n\nSICINIUS:\nWhat do ye talk?\nHave we not had a taste of his obedience?\nOur aediles smote? ourselves resisted? Come.\n\nMENENIUS:\nConsider this: he has been bred i' the wars\nSince he could draw a sword, and is ill school'd\nIn bolted language; meal and bran together\nHe throws without distinction. Give me leave,\nI'll go to him, and undertake to bring him\nWhere he shall answer, by a lawful form,\nIn peace, to his utmost peril.\n\nFirst Senator:\nNoble tribunes,\nIt is the humane way: the other course\nWill prove too bloody, and the end of it\nUnknown to the beginning.\n\nSICINIUS:\nNoble Menenius,\nBe you then as the people's officer.\nMasters, lay down your weapons.\n\nBRUTUS:\nGo not home.\n\nSICINIUS:\nMeet on the market-place. We'll attend you there:\nWhere, if you bring not Marcius, we'll proceed\nIn our first way.\n\nMENENIUS:\nI'll bring him to you.\nLet me desire your company: he must come,\nOr what is worst will follow.\n\nFirst Senator:\nPray you, let's to him.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nLet them puff all about mine ears, present me\nDeath on the wheel or at wild horses' heels,\nOr pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,\nThat the precipitation might down stretch\nBelow the beam of sight, yet will I still\nBe thus to them.\n\nA Patrician:\nYou do the nobler.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nI muse my mother\nDoes not approve me further, who was wont\nTo call them woollen vassals, things created\nTo buy and sell with groats, to show bare heads\nIn congregations, to yawn, be still and wonder,\nWhen one but of my ordinance stood up\nTo speak of peace or war.\nI talk of you:\nWhy did you wish me milder? would you have me\nFalse to my nature? Rather say I play\nThe man I am.\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nO, sir, sir, sir,\nI would have had you put your power well on,\nBefore you had worn it out.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nLet go.\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nYou might have been enough the man you are,\nWith striving less to be so; lesser had been\nThe thwartings of your dispositions, if\nYou had not show'd them how ye were disposed\nEre they lack'd power to cross you.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nLet them hang.\n\nA Patrician:\nAy, and burn too.\n\nMENENIUS:\nCome, come, you have been too rough, something\ntoo rough;\nYou must return and mend it.\n\nFirst Senator:\nThere's no remedy;\nUnless, by not so doing, our good city\nCleave in the midst, and perish.\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nPray, be counsell'd:\nI have a heart as little apt as yours,\nBut yet a brain that leads my use of anger\nTo better vantage.\n\nMENENIUS:\nWell said, noble woman?\nBefore he should thus stoop to the herd, but that\nThe violent fit o' the time craves it as physic\nFor the whole state, I would put mine armour on,\nWhich I can scarcely bear.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nWhat must I do?\n\nMENENIUS:\nReturn to the tribunes.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nWell, what then? what then?\n\nMENENIUS:\nRepent what you have spoke.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nFor them! I cannot do it to the gods;\nMust I then do't to them?\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nYou are too absolute;\nThough therein you can never be too noble,\nBut when extremities speak. I have heard you say,\nHonour and policy, like unsever'd friends,\nI' the war do grow together: grant that, and tell me,\nIn peace what each of them by the other lose,\nThat they combine not there.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nTush, tush!\n\nMENENIUS:\nA good demand.\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nIf it be honour in your wars to seem\nThe same you are not, which, for your best ends,\nYou adopt your policy, how is it less or worse,\nThat it shall hold companionship in peace\nWith honour, as in war, since that to both\nIt stands in like request?\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nWhy force you this?\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nBecause that now it lies you on to speak\nTo the people; not by your own instruction,\nNor by the matter which your heart prompts you,\nBut with such words that are but rooted in\nYour tongue, though but bastards and syllables\nOf no allowance to your bosom's truth.\nNow, this no more dishonours you at all\nThan to take in a town with gentle words,\nWhich else would put you to your fortune and\nThe hazard of much blood.\nI would dissemble with my nature where\nMy fortunes and my friends at stake required\nI should do so in honour: I am in this,\nYour wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;\nAnd you will rather show our general louts\nHow you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em,\nFor the inheritance of their loves and safeguard\nOf what that want might ruin.\n\nMENENIUS:\nNoble lady!\nCome, go with us; speak fair: you may salve so,\nNot what is dangerous present, but the loss\nOf what is past.\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nI prithee now, my son,\nGo to them, with this bonnet in thy hand;\nAnd thus far having stretch'd it--here be with them--\nThy knee bussing the stones--for in such business\nAction is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant\nMore learned than the ears--waving thy head,\nWhich often, thus, correcting thy stout heart,\nNow humble as the ripest mulberry\nThat will not hold the handling: or say to them,\nThou art their soldier, and being bred in broils\nHast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,\nWere fit for thee to use as they to claim,\nIn asking their good loves, but thou wilt frame\nThyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far\nAs thou hast power and person.\n\nMENENIUS:\nThis but done,\nEven as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;\nFor they have pardons, being ask'd, as free\nAs words to little purpose.\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nPrithee now,\nGo, and be ruled: although I know thou hadst rather\nFollow thine enemy in a fiery gulf\nThan flatter him in a bower. Here is Cominius.\n\nCOMINIUS:\nI have been i' the market-place; and, sir,'tis fit\nYou make strong party, or defend yourself\nBy calmness or by absence: all's in anger.\n\nMENENIUS:\nOnly fair speech.\n\nCOMINIUS:\nI think 'twill serve, if he\nCan thereto frame his spirit.\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nHe must, and will\nPrithee now, say you will, and go about it.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nMust I go show them my unbarbed sconce?\nMust I with base tongue give my noble heart\nA lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't:\nYet, were there but this single plot to lose,\nThis mould of Marcius, they to dust should grind it\nAnd throw't against the wind. To the market-place!\nYou have put me now to such a part which never\nI shall discharge to the life.\n\nCOMINIUS:\nCome, come, we'll prompt you.\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nI prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast said\nMy praises made thee first a soldier, so,\nTo have my praise for this, perform a part\nThou hast not done before.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nWell, I must do't:\nAway, my disposition, and possess me\nSome harlot's spirit! my throat of war be turn'd,\nWhich quired with my drum, into a pipe\nSmall as an eunuch, or the virgin voice\nThat babies lulls asleep! the smiles of knaves\nTent in my cheeks, and schoolboys' tears take up\nThe glasses of my sight! a beggar's tongue\nMake motion through my lips, and my arm'd knees,\nWho bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like his\nThat hath received an alms! I will not do't,\nLest I surcease to honour mine own truth\nAnd by my body's action teach my mind\nA most inherent baseness.\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nAt thy choice, then:\nTo beg of thee, it is my more dishonour\nThan thou of them. Come all to ruin; let\nThy mother rather feel thy pride than fear\nThy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death\nWith as big heart as thou. Do as thou list\nThy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me,\nBut owe thy pride thyself.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nPray, be content:\nMother, I am going to the market-place;\nChide me no more. I'll mountebank their loves,\nCog their hearts from them, and come home beloved\nOf all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going:\nCommend me to my wife. I'll return consul;\nOr never trust to what my tongue can do\nI' the way of flattery further.\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nDo your will.\n\nCOMINIUS:\nAway! the tribunes do attend you: arm yourself\nTo answer mildly; for they are prepared\nWith accusations, as I hear, more strong\nThan are upon you yet.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nThe word is 'mildly.' Pray you, let us go:\nLet them accuse me by invention, I\nWill answer in mine honour.\n\nMENENIUS:\nAy, but mildly.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nWell, mildly be it then. Mildly!\n\nBRUTUS:\nIn this point charge him home, that he affects\nTyrannical power: if he evade us there,\nEnforce him with his envy to the people,\nAnd that the spoil got on the Antiates\nWas ne'er distributed.\nWhat, will he come?\n\nAEdile:\nHe's coming.\n\nBRUTUS:\nHow accompanied?\n\nAEdile:\nWith old Menenius, and those senators\nThat always favour'd him.\n\nSICINIUS:\nHave you a catalogue\nOf all the voices that we have procured\nSet down by the poll?\n\nAEdile:\nI have; 'tis ready.\n\nSICINIUS:\nHave you collected them by tribes?\n\nAEdile:\nI have.\n\nSICINIUS:\nAssemble presently the people hither;\nAnd when they bear me say 'It shall be so\nI' the right and strength o' the commons,' be it either\nFor death, for fine, or banishment, then let them\nIf I say fine, cry 'Fine;' if death, cry 'Death.'\nInsisting on the old prerogative\nAnd power i' the truth o' the cause.\n\nAEdile:\nI shall inform them.\n\nBRUTUS:\nAnd when such time they have begun to cry,\nLet them not cease, but with a din confused\nEnforce the present execution\nOf what we chance to sentence.\n\nAEdile:\nVery well.\n\nSICINIUS:\nMake them be strong and ready for this hint,\nWhen we shall hap to give 't them.\n\nBRUTUS:\nGo about it.\nPut him to choler straight: he hath been used\nEver to conquer, and to have his worth\nOf contradiction: being once chafed, he cannot\nBe rein'd again to temperance; then he speaks\nWhat's in his heart; and that is there which looks\nWith us to break his neck.\n\nSICINIUS:\nWell, here he comes.\n\nMENENIUS:\nCalmly, I do beseech you.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nAy, as an ostler, that for the poorest piece\nWill bear the knave by the volume. The honour'd gods\nKeep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice\nSupplied with worthy men! plant love among 's!\nThrong our large temples with the shows of peace,\nAnd not our streets with war!\n\nFirst Senator:\nAmen, amen.\n\nMENENIUS:\nA noble wish.\n\nSICINIUS:\nDraw near, ye people.\n\nAEdile:\nList to your tribunes. Audience: peace, I say!\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nFirst, hear me speak.\n\nBoth Tribunes:\nWell, say. Peace, ho!\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nShall I be charged no further than this present?\nMust all determine here?\n\nSICINIUS:\nI do demand,\nIf you submit you to the people's voices,\nAllow their officers and are content\nTo suffer lawful censure for such faults\nAs shall be proved upon you?\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nI am content.\n\nMENENIUS:\nLo, citizens, he says he is content:\nThe warlike service he has done, consider; think\nUpon the wounds his body bears, which show\nLike graves i' the holy churchyard.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nScratches with briers,\nScars to move laughter only.\n\nMENENIUS:\nConsider further,\nThat when he speaks not like a citizen,\nYou find him like a soldier: do not take\nHis rougher accents for malicious sounds,\nBut, as I say, such as become a soldier,\nRather than envy you.\n\nCOMINIUS:\nWell, well, no more.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nWhat is the matter\nThat being pass'd for consul with full voice,\nI am so dishonour'd that the very hour\nYou take it off again?\n\nSICINIUS:\nAnswer to us.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nSay, then: 'tis true, I ought so.\n\nSICINIUS:\nWe charge you, that you have contrived to take\nFrom Rome all season'd office and to wind\nYourself into a power tyrannical;\nFor which you are a traitor to the people.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nHow! traitor!\n\nMENENIUS:\nNay, temperately; your promise.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nThe fires i' the lowest hell fold-in the people!\nCall me their traitor! Thou injurious tribune!\nWithin thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths,\nIn thy hand clutch'd as many millions, in\nThy lying tongue both numbers, I would say\n'Thou liest' unto thee with a voice as free\nAs I do pray the gods.\n\nSICINIUS:\nMark you this, people?\n\nCitizens:\nTo the rock, to the rock with him!\n\nSICINIUS:\nPeace!\nWe need not put new matter to his charge:\nWhat you have seen him do and heard him speak,\nBeating your officers, cursing yourselves,\nOpposing laws with strokes and here defying\nThose whose great power must try him; even this,\nSo criminal and in such capital kind,\nDeserves the extremest death.\n\nBRUTUS:\nBut since he hath\nServed well for Rome,--\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nWhat do you prate of service?\n\nBRUTUS:\nI talk of that, that know it.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nYou?\n\nMENENIUS:\nIs this the promise that you made your mother?\n\nCOMINIUS:\nKnow, I pray you,--\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nI know no further:\nLet them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death,\nVagabond exile, raying, pent to linger\nBut with a grain a day, I would not buy\nTheir mercy at the price of one fair word;\nNor cheque my courage for what they can give,\nTo have't with saying 'Good morrow.'\n\nSICINIUS:\nFor that he has,\nAs much as in him lies, from time to time\nEnvied against the people, seeking means\nTo pluck away their power, as now at last\nGiven hostile strokes, and that not in the presence\nOf dreaded justice, but on the ministers\nThat do distribute it; in the name o' the people\nAnd in the power of us the tribunes, we,\nEven from this instant, banish him our city,\nIn peril of precipitation\nFrom off the rock Tarpeian never more\nTo enter our Rome gates: i' the people's name,\nI say it shall be so.\n\nCitizens:\nIt shall be so, it shall be so; let him away:\nHe's banish'd, and it shall be so.\n\nCOMINIUS:\nHear me, my masters, and my common friends,--\n\nSICINIUS:\nHe's sentenced; no more hearing.\n\nCOMINIUS:\nLet me speak:\nI have been consul, and can show for Rome\nHer enemies' marks upon me. I do love\nMy country's good with a respect more tender,\nMore holy and profound, than mine own life,\nMy dear wife's estimate, her womb's increase,\nAnd treasure of my loins; then if I would\nSpeak that,--\n\nSICINIUS:\nWe know your drift: speak what?\n\nBRUTUS:\nThere's no more to be said, but he is banish'd,\nAs enemy to the people and his country:\nIt shall be so.\n\nCitizens:\nIt shall be so, it shall be so.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nYou common cry of curs! whose breath I hate\nAs reek o' the rotten fens, whose loves I prize\nAs the dead carcasses of unburied men\nThat do corrupt my air, I banish you;\nAnd here remain with your uncertainty!\nLet every feeble rumour shake your hearts!\nYour enemies, with nodding of their plumes,\nFan you into despair! Have the power still\nTo banish your defenders; till at length\nYour ignorance, which finds not till it feels,\nMaking not reservation of yourselves,\nStill your own foes, deliver you as most\nAbated captives to some nation\nThat won you without blows! Despising,\nFor you, the city, thus I turn my back:\nThere is a world elsewhere.\n\nAEdile:\nThe people's enemy is gone, is gone!\n\nCitizens:\nOur enemy is banish'd! he is gone! Hoo! hoo!\n\nSICINIUS:\nGo, see him out at gates, and follow him,\nAs he hath followed you, with all despite;\nGive him deserved vexation. Let a guard\nAttend us through the city.\n\nCitizens:\nCome, come; let's see him out at gates; come.\nThe gods preserve our noble tribunes! Come.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nCome, leave your tears: a brief farewell: the beast\nWith many heads butts me away. Nay, mother,\nWhere is your ancient courage? you were used\nTo say extremity was the trier of spirits;\nThat common chances common men could bear;\nThat when the sea was calm all boats alike\nShow'd mastership in floating; fortune's blows,\nWhen most struck home, being gentle wounded, craves\nA noble cunning: you were used to load me\nWith precepts that would make invincible\nThe heart that conn'd them.\n\nVIRGILIA:\nO heavens! O heavens!\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nNay! prithee, woman,--\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nNow the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome,\nAnd occupations perish!\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nWhat, what, what!\nI shall be loved when I am lack'd. Nay, mother.\nResume that spirit, when you were wont to say,\nIf you had been the wife of Hercules,\nSix of his labours you'ld have done, and saved\nYour husband so much sweat. Cominius,\nDroop not; adieu. Farewell, my wife, my mother:\nI'll do well yet. Thou old and true Menenius,\nThy tears are salter than a younger man's,\nAnd venomous to thine eyes. My sometime general,\nI have seen thee stem, and thou hast oft beheld\nHeart-hardening spectacles; tell these sad women\n'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes,\nAs 'tis to laugh at 'em. My mother, you wot well\nMy hazards still have been your solace: and\nBelieve't not lightly--though I go alone,\nLike to a lonely dragon, that his fen\nMakes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen--your son\nWill or exceed the common or be caught\nWith cautelous baits and practise.\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nMy first son.\nWhither wilt thou go? Take good Cominius\nWith thee awhile: determine on some course,\nMore than a wild exposture to each chance\nThat starts i' the way before thee.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nO the gods!\n\nCOMINIUS:\nI'll follow thee a month, devise with thee\nWhere thou shalt rest, that thou mayst hear of us\nAnd we of thee: so if the time thrust forth\nA cause for thy repeal, we shall not send\nO'er the vast world to seek a single man,\nAnd lose advantage, which doth ever cool\nI' the absence of the needer.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nFare ye well:\nThou hast years upon thee; and thou art too full\nOf the wars' surfeits, to go rove with one\nThat's yet unbruised: bring me but out at gate.\nCome, my sweet wife, my dearest mother, and\nMy friends of noble touch, when I am forth,\nBid me farewell, and smile. I pray you, come.\nWhile I remain above the ground, you shall\nHear from me still, and never of me aught\nBut what is like me formerly.\n\nMENENIUS:\nThat's worthily\nAs any ear can hear. Come, let's not weep.\nIf I could shake off but one seven years\nFrom these old arms and legs, by the good gods,\nI'ld with thee every foot.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nGive me thy hand: Come.\n\nSICINIUS:\nBid them all home; he's gone, and we'll no further.\nThe nobility are vex'd, whom we see have sided\nIn his behalf.\n\nBRUTUS:\nNow we have shown our power,\nLet us seem humbler after it is done\nThan when it was a-doing.\n\nSICINIUS:\nBid them home:\nSay their great enemy is gone, and they\nStand in their ancient strength.\n\nBRUTUS:\nDismiss them home.\nHere comes his mother.\n\nSICINIUS:\nLet's not meet her.\n\nBRUTUS:\nWhy?\n\nSICINIUS:\nThey say she's mad.\n\nBRUTUS:\nThey have ta'en note of us: keep on your way.\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nO, ye're well met: the hoarded plague o' the gods\nRequite your love!\n\nMENENIUS:\nPeace, peace; be not so loud.\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nIf that I could for weeping, you should hear,--\nNay, and you shall hear some.\nWill you be gone?\n\nVIRGILIA:\n\nSICINIUS:\nAre you mankind?\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nAy, fool; is that a shame? Note but this fool.\nWas not a man my father? Hadst thou foxship\nTo banish him that struck more blows for Rome\nThan thou hast spoken words?\n\nSICINIUS:\nO blessed heavens!\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nMore noble blows than ever thou wise words;\nAnd for Rome's good. I'll tell thee what; yet go:\nNay, but thou shalt stay too: I would my son\nWere in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,\nHis good sword in his hand.\n\nSICINIUS:\nWhat then?\n\nVIRGILIA:\nWhat then!\nHe'ld make an end of thy posterity.\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nBastards and all.\nGood man, the wounds that he does bear for Rome!\n\nMENENIUS:\nCome, come, peace.\n\nSICINIUS:\nI would he had continued to his country\nAs he began, and not unknit himself\nThe noble knot he made.\n\nBRUTUS:\nI would he had.\n\nVOLUMNIA:\n'I would he had'! 'Twas you incensed the rabble:\nCats, that can judge as fitly of his worth\nAs I can of those mysteries which heaven\nWill not have earth to know.\n\nBRUTUS:\nPray, let us go.\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nNow, pray, sir, get you gone:\nYou have done a brave deed. Ere you go, hear this:--\nAs far as doth the Capitol exceed\nThe meanest house in Rome, so far my son--\nThis lady's husband here, this, do you see--\nWhom you have banish'd, does exceed you all.\n\nBRUTUS:\nWell, well, we'll leave you.\n\nSICINIUS:\nWhy stay we to be baited\nWith one that wants her wits?\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nTake my prayers with you.\nI would the gods had nothing else to do\nBut to confirm my curses! Could I meet 'em\nBut once a-day, it would unclog my heart\nOf what lies heavy to't.\n\nMENENIUS:\nYou have told them home;\nAnd, by my troth, you have cause. You'll sup with me?\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nAnger's my meat; I sup upon myself,\nAnd so shall starve with feeding. Come, let's go:\nLeave this faint puling and lament as I do,\nIn anger, Juno-like. Come, come, come.\n\nMENENIUS:\nFie, fie, fie!\n\nRoman:\nI know you well, sir, and you know\nme: your name, I think, is Adrian.\n\nVolsce:\nIt is so, sir: truly, I have forgot you.\n\nRoman:\nI am a Roman; and my services are,\nas you are, against 'em: know you me yet?\n\nVolsce:\nNicanor? no.\n\nRoman:\nThe same, sir.\n\nVolsce:\nYou had more beard when I last saw you; but your\nfavour is well approved by your tongue. What's the\nnews in Rome? I have a note from the Volscian state,\nto find you out there: you have well saved me a\nday's journey.\n\nRoman:\nThere hath been in Rome strange insurrections; the\npeople against the senators, patricians, and nobles.\n\nVolsce:\nHath been! is it ended, then? Our state thinks not\nso: they are in a most warlike preparation, and\nhope to come upon them in the heat of their division.\n\nRoman:\nThe main blaze of it is past, but a small thing\nwould make it flame again: for the nobles receive\nso to heart the banishment of that worthy\nCoriolanus, that they are in a ripe aptness to take\nall power from the people and to pluck from them\ntheir tribunes for ever. This lies glowing, I can\ntell you, and is almost mature for the violent\nbreaking out.\n\nVolsce:\nCoriolanus banished!\n\nRoman:\nBanished, sir.\n\nVolsce:\nYou will be welcome with this intelligence, Nicanor.\n\nRoman:\nThe day serves well for them now. I have heard it\nsaid, the fittest time to corrupt a man's wife is\nwhen she's fallen out with her husband. Your noble\nTullus Aufidius will appear well in these wars, his\ngreat opposer, Coriolanus, being now in no request\nof his country.\n\nVolsce:\nHe cannot choose. I am most fortunate, thus\naccidentally to encounter you: you have ended my\nbusiness, and I will merrily accompany you home.\n\nRoman:\nI shall, between this and supper, tell you most\nstrange things from Rome; all tending to the good of\ntheir adversaries. Have you an army ready, say you?\n\nVolsce:\nA most royal one; the centurions and their charges,\ndistinctly billeted, already in the entertainment,\nand to be on foot at an hour's warning.\n\nRoman:\nI am joyful to hear of their readiness, and am the\nman, I think, that shall set them in present action.\nSo, sir, heartily well met, and most glad of your company.\n\nVolsce:\nYou take my part from me, sir; I have the most cause\nto be glad of yours.\n\nRoman:\nWell, let us go together.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nA goodly city is this Antium. City,\n'Tis I that made thy widows: many an heir\nOf these fair edifices 'fore my wars\nHave I heard groan and drop: then know me not,\nLest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones\nIn puny battle slay me.\nSave you, sir.\n\nCitizen:\nAnd you.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nDirect me, if it be your will,\nWhere great Aufidius lies: is he in Antium?\n\nCitizen:\nHe is, and feasts the nobles of the state\nAt his house this night.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nWhich is his house, beseech you?\n\nCitizen:\nThis, here before you.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nThank you, sir: farewell.\nO world, thy slippery turns! Friends now fast sworn,\nWhose double bosoms seem to wear one heart,\nWhose house, whose bed, whose meal, and exercise,\nAre still together, who twin, as 'twere, in love\nUnseparable, shall within this hour,\nOn a dissension of a doit, break out\nTo bitterest enmity: so, fellest foes,\nWhose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep,\nTo take the one the other, by some chance,\nSome trick not worth an egg, shall grow dear friends\nAnd interjoin their issues. So with me:\nMy birth-place hate I, and my love's upon\nThis enemy town. I'll enter: if he slay me,\nHe does fair justice; if he give me way,\nI'll do his country service.\n\nFirst Servingman:\nWine, wine, wine! What service\nis here! I think our fellows are asleep.\n\nSecond Servingman:\nWhere's Cotus? my master calls\nfor him. Cotus!\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nA goodly house: the feast smells well; but I\nAppear not like a guest.\n\nFirst Servingman:\nWhat would you have, friend? whence are you?\nHere's no place for you: pray, go to the door.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nI have deserved no better entertainment,\nIn being Coriolanus.\n\nSecond Servingman:\nWhence are you, sir? Has the porter his eyes in his\nhead; that he gives entrance to such companions?\nPray, get you out.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nAway!\n\nSecond Servingman:\nAway! get you away.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nNow thou'rt troublesome.\n\nSecond Servingman:\nAre you so brave? I'll have you talked with anon.\n\nThird Servingman:\nWhat fellow's this?\n\nFirst Servingman:\nA strange one as ever I looked on: I cannot get him\nout of the house: prithee, call my master to him.\n\nThird Servingman:\nWhat have you to do here, fellow? Pray you, avoid\nthe house.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nLet me but stand; I will not hurt your hearth.\n\nThird Servingman:\nWhat are you?\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nA gentleman.\n\nThird Servingman:\nA marvellous poor one.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nTrue, so I am.\n\nThird Servingman:\nPray you, poor gentleman, take up some other\nstation; here's no place for you; pray you, avoid: come.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nFollow your function, go, and batten on cold bits.\n\nThird Servingman:\nWhat, you will not? Prithee, tell my master what a\nstrange guest he has here.\n\nSecond Servingman:\nAnd I shall.\n\nThird Servingman:\nWhere dwellest thou?\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nUnder the canopy.\n\nThird Servingman:\nUnder the canopy!\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nAy.\n\nThird Servingman:\nWhere's that?\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nI' the city of kites and crows.\n\nThird Servingman:\nI' the city of kites and crows! What an ass it is!\nThen thou dwellest with daws too?\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nNo, I serve not thy master.\n\nThird Servingman:\nHow, sir! do you meddle with my master?\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nAy; 'tis an honester service than to meddle with thy\nmistress. Thou pratest, and pratest; serve with thy\ntrencher, hence!\n\nAUFIDIUS:\nWhere is this fellow?\n\nSecond Servingman:\nHere, sir: I'ld have beaten him like a dog, but for\ndisturbing the lords within.\n\nAUFIDIUS:\nWhence comest thou? what wouldst thou? thy name?\nWhy speak'st not? speak, man: what's thy name?\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nIf, Tullus,\nNot yet thou knowest me, and, seeing me, dost not\nThink me for the man I am, necessity\nCommands me name myself.\n\nAUFIDIUS:\nWhat is thy name?\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nA name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,\nAnd harsh in sound to thine.\n\nAUFIDIUS:\nSay, what's thy name?\nThou hast a grim appearance, and thy face\nBears a command in't; though thy tackle's torn.\nThou show'st a noble vessel: what's thy name?\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nPrepare thy brow to frown: know'st\nthou me yet?\n\nAUFIDIUS:\nI know thee not: thy name?\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nMy name is Caius Marcius, who hath done\nTo thee particularly and to all the Volsces\nGreat hurt and mischief; thereto witness may\nMy surname, Coriolanus: the painful service,\nThe extreme dangers and the drops of blood\nShed for my thankless country are requited\nBut with that surname; a good memory,\nAnd witness of the malice and displeasure\nWhich thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains;\nThe cruelty and envy of the people,\nPermitted by our dastard nobles, who\nHave all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest;\nAnd suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be\nWhoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremity\nHath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope--\nMistake me not--to save my life, for if\nI had fear'd death, of all the men i' the world\nI would have 'voided thee, but in mere spite,\nTo be full quit of those my banishers,\nStand I before thee here. Then if thou hast\nA heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge\nThine own particular wrongs and stop those maims\nOf shame seen through thy country, speed\nthee straight,\nAnd make my misery serve thy turn: so use it\nThat my revengeful services may prove\nAs benefits to thee, for I will fight\nAgainst my canker'd country with the spleen\nOf all the under fiends. But if so be\nThou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes\nThou'rt tired, then, in a word, I also am\nLonger to live most weary, and present\nMy throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;\nWhich not to cut would show thee but a fool,\nSince I have ever follow'd thee with hate,\nDrawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,\nAnd cannot live but to thy shame, unless\nIt be to do thee service.\n\nAUFIDIUS:\nO Marcius, Marcius!\nEach word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart\nA root of ancient envy. If Jupiter\nShould from yond cloud speak divine things,\nAnd say 'Tis true,' I'ld not believe them more\nThan thee, all noble Marcius. Let me twine\nMine arms about that body, where against\nMy grained ash an hundred times hath broke\nAnd scarr'd the moon with splinters: here I clip\nThe anvil of my sword, and do contest\nAs hotly and as nobly with thy love\nAs ever in ambitious strength I did\nContend against thy valour. Know thou first,\nI loved the maid I married; never man\nSigh'd truer breath; but that I see thee here,\nThou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart\nThan when I first my wedded mistress saw\nBestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee,\nWe have a power on foot; and I had purpose\nOnce more to hew thy target from thy brawn,\nOr lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out\nTwelve several times, and I have nightly since\nDreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me;\nWe have been down together in my sleep,\nUnbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat,\nAnd waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,\nHad we no quarrel else to Rome, but that\nThou art thence banish'd, we would muster all\nFrom twelve to seventy, and pouring war\nInto the bowels of ungrateful Rome,\nLike a bold flood o'er-bear. O, come, go in,\nAnd take our friendly senators by the hands;\nWho now are here, taking their leaves of me,\nWho am prepared against your territories,\nThough not for Rome itself.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nYou bless me, gods!\n\nAUFIDIUS:\nTherefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt have\nThe leading of thine own revenges, take\nThe one half of my commission; and set down--\nAs best thou art experienced, since thou know'st\nThy country's strength and weakness,--thine own ways;\nWhether to knock against the gates of Rome,\nOr rudely visit them in parts remote,\nTo fright them, ere destroy. But come in:\nLet me commend thee first to those that shall\nSay yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!\nAnd more a friend than e'er an enemy;\nYet, Marcius, that was much. Your hand: most welcome!\n\nFirst Servingman:\nHere's a strange alteration!\n\nSecond Servingman:\nBy my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with\na cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a\nfalse report of him.\n\nFirst Servingman:\nWhat an arm he has! he turned me about with his\nfinger and his thumb, as one would set up a top.\n\nSecond Servingman:\nNay, I knew by his face that there was something in\nhim: he had, sir, a kind of face, methought,--I\ncannot tell how to term it.\n\nFirst Servingman:\nHe had so; looking as it were--would I were hanged,\nbut I thought there was more in him than I could think.\n\nSecond Servingman:\nSo did I, I'll be sworn: he is simply the rarest\nman i' the world.\n\nFirst Servingman:\nI think he is: but a greater soldier than he you wot on.\n\nSecond Servingman:\nWho, my master?\n\nFirst Servingman:\nNay, it's no matter for that.\n\nSecond Servingman:\nWorth six on him.\n\nFirst Servingman:\nNay, not so neither: but I take him to be the\ngreater soldier.\n\nSecond Servingman:\nFaith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that:\nfor the defence of a town, our general is excellent.\n\nFirst Servingman:\nAy, and for an assault too.\n\nThird Servingman:\nO slaves, I can tell you news,-- news, you rascals!\n\nFirst Servingman:\nWhat, what, what? let's partake.\n\nThird Servingman:\nI would not be a Roman, of all nations; I had as\nlieve be a condemned man.\n\nFirst Servingman:\nWherefore? wherefore?\n\nThird Servingman:\nWhy, here's he that was wont to thwack our general,\nCaius Marcius.\n\nFirst Servingman:\nWhy do you say 'thwack our general '?\n\nThird Servingman:\nI do not say 'thwack our general;' but he was always\ngood enough for him.\n\nSecond Servingman:\nCome, we are fellows and friends: he was ever too\nhard for him; I have heard him say so himself.\n\nFirst Servingman:\nHe was too hard for him directly, to say the troth\non't: before Corioli he scotched him and notched\nhim like a carbon ado.\n\nSecond Servingman:\nAn he had been cannibally given, he might have\nbroiled and eaten him too.\n\nFirst Servingman:\nBut, more of thy news?\n\nThird Servingman:\nWhy, he is so made on here within, as if he were son\nand heir to Mars; set at upper end o' the table; no\nquestion asked him by any of the senators, but they\nstand bald before him: our general himself makes a\nmistress of him: sanctifies himself with's hand and\nturns up the white o' the eye to his discourse. But\nthe bottom of the news is that our general is cut i'\nthe middle and but one half of what he was\nyesterday; for the other has half, by the entreaty\nand grant of the whole table. He'll go, he says,\nand sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears: he\nwill mow all down before him, and leave his passage polled.\n\nSecond Servingman:\nAnd he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine.\n\nThird Servingman:\nDo't! he will do't; for, look you, sir, he has as\nmany friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as it\nwere, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, as\nwe term it, his friends whilst he's in directitude.\n\nFirst Servingman:\nDirectitude! what's that?\n\nThird Servingman:\nBut when they shall see, sir, his crest up again,\nand the man in blood, they will out of their\nburrows, like conies after rain, and revel all with\nhim.\n\nFirst Servingman:\nBut when goes this forward?\n\nThird Servingman:\nTo-morrow; to-day; presently; you shall have the\ndrum struck up this afternoon: 'tis, as it were, a\nparcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they\nwipe their lips.\n\nSecond Servingman:\nWhy, then we shall have a stirring world again.\nThis peace is nothing, but to rust iron, increase\ntailors, and breed ballad-makers.\n\nFirst Servingman:\nLet me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far as\nday does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, and\nfull of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy;\nmulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of more\nbastard children than war's a destroyer of men.\n\nSecond Servingman:\n'Tis so: and as war, in some sort, may be said to\nbe a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a\ngreat maker of cuckolds.\n\nFirst Servingman:\nAy, and it makes men hate one another.\n\nThird Servingman:\nReason; because they then less need one another.\nThe wars for my money. I hope to see Romans as cheap\nas Volscians. They are rising, they are rising.\n\nAll:\nIn, in, in, in!\n\nSICINIUS:\nWe hear not of him, neither need we fear him;\nHis remedies are tame i' the present peace\nAnd quietness of the people, which before\nWere in wild hurry. Here do we make his friends\nBlush that the world goes well, who rather had,\nThough they themselves did suffer by't, behold\nDissentious numbers pestering streets than see\nOur tradesmen with in their shops and going\nAbout their functions friendly.\n\nBRUTUS:\nWe stood to't in good time.\nIs this Menenius?\n\nSICINIUS:\n'Tis he,'tis he: O, he is grown most kind of late.\n\nBoth Tribunes:\nHail sir!\n\nMENENIUS:\nHail to you both!\n\nSICINIUS:\nYour Coriolanus\nIs not much miss'd, but with his friends:\nThe commonwealth doth stand, and so would do,\nWere he more angry at it.\n\nMENENIUS:\nAll's well; and might have been much better, if\nHe could have temporized.\n\nSICINIUS:\nWhere is he, hear you?\n\nMENENIUS:\nNay, I hear nothing: his mother and his wife\nHear nothing from him.\n\nCitizens:\nThe gods preserve you both!\n\nSICINIUS:\nGod-den, our neighbours.\n\nBRUTUS:\nGod-den to you all, god-den to you all.\n\nFirst Citizen:\nOurselves, our wives, and children, on our knees,\nAre bound to pray for you both.\n\nSICINIUS:\nLive, and thrive!\n\nBRUTUS:\nFarewell, kind neighbours: we wish'd Coriolanus\nHad loved you as we did.\n\nCitizens:\nNow the gods keep you!\n\nBoth Tribunes:\nFarewell, farewell.\n\nSICINIUS:\nThis is a happier and more comely time\nThan when these fellows ran about the streets,\nCrying confusion.\n\nBRUTUS:\nCaius Marcius was\nA worthy officer i' the war; but insolent,\nO'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,\nSelf-loving,--\n\nSICINIUS:\nAnd affecting one sole throne,\nWithout assistance.\n\nMENENIUS:\nI think not so.\n\nSICINIUS:\nWe should by this, to all our lamentation,\nIf he had gone forth consul, found it so.\n\nBRUTUS:\nThe gods have well prevented it, and Rome\nSits safe and still without him.\n\nAEdile:\nWorthy tribunes,\nThere is a slave, whom we have put in prison,\nReports, the Volsces with two several powers\nAre enter'd in the Roman territories,\nAnd with the deepest malice of the war\nDestroy what lies before 'em.\n\nMENENIUS:\n'Tis Aufidius,\nWho, hearing of our Marcius' banishment,\nThrusts forth his horns again into the world;\nWhich were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome,\nAnd durst not once peep out.\n\nSICINIUS:\nCome, what talk you\nOf Marcius?\n\nBRUTUS:\nGo see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot be\nThe Volsces dare break with us.\n\nMENENIUS:\nCannot be!\nWe have record that very well it can,\nAnd three examples of the like have been\nWithin my age. But reason with the fellow,\nBefore you punish him, where he heard this,\nLest you shall chance to whip your information\nAnd beat the messenger who bids beware\nOf what is to be dreaded.\n\nSICINIUS:\nTell not me:\nI know this cannot be.\n\nBRUTUS:\nNot possible.\n\nMessenger:\nThe nobles in great earnestness are going\nAll to the senate-house: some news is come\nThat turns their countenances.\n\nSICINIUS:\n'Tis this slave;--\nGo whip him, 'fore the people's eyes:--his raising;\nNothing but his report.\n\nMessenger:\nYes, worthy sir,\nThe slave's report is seconded; and more,\nMore fearful, is deliver'd.\n\nSICINIUS:\nWhat more fearful?\n\nMessenger:\nIt is spoke freely out of many mouths--\nHow probable I do not know--that Marcius,\nJoin'd with Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst Rome,\nAnd vows revenge as spacious as between\nThe young'st and oldest thing.\n\nSICINIUS:\nThis is most likely!\n\nBRUTUS:\nRaised only, that the weaker sort may wish\nGood Marcius home again.\n\nSICINIUS:\nThe very trick on't.\n\nMENENIUS:\nThis is unlikely:\nHe and Aufidius can no more atone\nThan violentest contrariety.\n\nSecond Messenger:\nYou are sent for to the senate:\nA fearful army, led by Caius Marcius\nAssociated with Aufidius, rages\nUpon our territories; and have already\nO'erborne their way, consumed with fire, and took\nWhat lay before them.\n\nCOMINIUS:\nO, you have made good work!\n\nMENENIUS:\nWhat news? what news?\n\nCOMINIUS:\nYou have holp to ravish your own daughters and\nTo melt the city leads upon your pates,\nTo see your wives dishonour'd to your noses,--\n\nMENENIUS:\nWhat's the news? what's the news?\n\nCOMINIUS:\nYour temples burned in their cement, and\nYour franchises, whereon you stood, confined\nInto an auger's bore.\n\nMENENIUS:\nPray now, your news?\nYou have made fair work, I fear me.--Pray, your news?--\nIf Marcius should be join'd with Volscians,--\n\nCOMINIUS:\nIf!\nHe is their god: he leads them like a thing\nMade by some other deity than nature,\nThat shapes man better; and they follow him,\nAgainst us brats, with no less confidence\nThan boys pursuing summer butterflies,\nOr butchers killing flies.\n\nMENENIUS:\nYou have made good work,\nYou and your apron-men; you that stood so up much\non the voice of occupation and\nThe breath of garlic-eaters!\n\nCOMINIUS:\nHe will shake\nYour Rome about your ears.\n\nMENENIUS:\nAs Hercules\nDid shake down mellow fruit.\nYou have made fair work!\n\nBRUTUS:\nBut is this true, sir?\n\nCOMINIUS:\nAy; and you'll look pale\nBefore you find it other. All the regions\nDo smilingly revolt; and who resist\nAre mock'd for valiant ignorance,\nAnd perish constant fools. Who is't can blame him?\nYour enemies and his find something in him.\n\nMENENIUS:\nWe are all undone, unless\nThe noble man have mercy.\n\nCOMINIUS:\nWho shall ask it?\nThe tribunes cannot do't for shame; the people\nDeserve such pity of him as the wolf\nDoes of the shepherds: for his best friends, if they\nShould say 'Be good to Rome,' they charged him even\nAs those should do that had deserved his hate,\nAnd therein show'd like enemies.\n\nMENENIUS:\n'Tis true:\nIf he were putting to my house the brand\nThat should consume it, I have not the face\nTo say 'Beseech you, cease.' You have made fair hands,\nYou and your crafts! you have crafted fair!\n\nCOMINIUS:\nYou have brought\nA trembling upon Rome, such as was never\nSo incapable of help.\n\nBoth Tribunes:\nSay not we brought it.\n\nMENENIUS:\nHow! Was it we? we loved him but, like beasts\nAnd cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters,\nWho did hoot him out o' the city.\n\nCOMINIUS:\nBut I fear\nThey'll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius,\nThe second name of men, obeys his points\nAs if he were his officer: desperation\nIs all the policy, strength and defence,\nThat Rome can make against them.\n\nMENENIUS:\nHere come the clusters.\nAnd is Aufidius with him? You are they\nThat made the air unwholesome, when you cast\nYour stinking greasy caps in hooting at\nCoriolanus' exile. Now he's coming;\nAnd not a hair upon a soldier's head\nWhich will not prove a whip: as many coxcombs\nAs you threw caps up will he tumble down,\nAnd pay you for your voices. 'Tis no matter;\nif he could burn us all into one coal,\nWe have deserved it.\n\nCitizens:\nFaith, we hear fearful news.\n\nFirst Citizen:\nFor mine own part,\nWhen I said, banish him, I said 'twas pity.\n\nSecond Citizen:\nAnd so did I.\n\nThird Citizen:\nAnd so did I; and, to say the truth, so did very\nmany of us: that we did, we did for the best; and\nthough we willingly consented to his banishment, yet\nit was against our will.\n\nCOMINIUS:\nYe re goodly things, you voices!\n\nMENENIUS:\nYou have made\nGood work, you and your cry! Shall's to the Capitol?\n\nCOMINIUS:\nO, ay, what else?\n\nSICINIUS:\nGo, masters, get you home; be not dismay'd:\nThese are a side that would be glad to have\nThis true which they so seem to fear. Go home,\nAnd show no sign of fear.\n\nFirst Citizen:\nThe gods be good to us! Come, masters, let's home.\nI ever said we were i' the wrong when we banished\nhim.\n\nSecond Citizen:\nSo did we all. But, come, let's home.\n\nBRUTUS:\nI do not like this news.\n\nSICINIUS:\nNor I.\n\nBRUTUS:\nLet's to the Capitol. Would half my wealth\nWould buy this for a lie!\n\nSICINIUS:\nPray, let us go.\n\nAUFIDIUS:\nDo they still fly to the Roman?\n\nLieutenant:\nI do not know what witchcraft's in him, but\nYour soldiers use him as the grace 'fore meat,\nTheir talk at table, and their thanks at end;\nAnd you are darken'd in this action, sir,\nEven by your own.\n\nAUFIDIUS:\nI cannot help it now,\nUnless, by using means, I lame the foot\nOf our design. He bears himself more proudlier,\nEven to my person, than I thought he would\nWhen first I did embrace him: yet his nature\nIn that's no changeling; and I must excuse\nWhat cannot be amended.\n\nLieutenant:\nYet I wish, sir,--\nI mean for your particular,--you had not\nJoin'd in commission with him; but either\nHad borne the action of yourself, or else\nTo him had left it solely.\n\nAUFIDIUS:\nI understand thee well; and be thou sure,\nwhen he shall come to his account, he knows not\nWhat I can urge against him. Although it seems,\nAnd so he thinks, and is no less apparent\nTo the vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly.\nAnd shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,\nFights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon\nAs draw his sword; yet he hath left undone\nThat which shall break his neck or hazard mine,\nWhene'er we come to our account.\n\nLieutenant:\nSir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?\n\nAUFIDIUS:\nAll places yield to him ere he sits down;\nAnd the nobility of Rome are his:\nThe senators and patricians love him too:\nThe tribunes are no soldiers; and their people\nWill be as rash in the repeal, as hasty\nTo expel him thence. I think he'll be to Rome\nAs is the osprey to the fish, who takes it\nBy sovereignty of nature. First he was\nA noble servant to them; but he could not\nCarry his honours even: whether 'twas pride,\nWhich out of daily fortune ever taints\nThe happy man; whether defect of judgment,\nTo fail in the disposing of those chances\nWhich he was lord of; or whether nature,\nNot to be other than one thing, not moving\nFrom the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace\nEven with the same austerity and garb\nAs he controll'd the war; but one of these--\nAs he hath spices of them all, not all,\nFor I dare so far free him--made him fear'd,\nSo hated, and so banish'd: but he has a merit,\nTo choke it in the utterance. So our virtues\nLie in the interpretation of the time:\nAnd power, unto itself most commendable,\nHath not a tomb so evident as a chair\nTo extol what it hath done.\nOne fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;\nRights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.\nCome, let's away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,\nThou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine.\n\nMENENIUS:\nNo, I'll not go: you hear what he hath said\nWhich was sometime his general; who loved him\nIn a most dear particular. He call'd me father:\nBut what o' that? Go, you that banish'd him;\nA mile before his tent fall down, and knee\nThe way into his mercy: nay, if he coy'd\nTo hear Cominius speak, I'll keep at home.\n\nCOMINIUS:\nHe would not seem to know me.\n\nMENENIUS:\nDo you hear?\n\nCOMINIUS:\nYet one time he did call me by my name:\nI urged our old acquaintance, and the drops\nThat we have bled together. Coriolanus\nHe would not answer to: forbad all names;\nHe was a kind of nothing, titleless,\nTill he had forged himself a name o' the fire\nOf burning Rome.\n\nMENENIUS:\nWhy, so: you have made good work!\nA pair of tribunes that have rack'd for Rome,\nTo make coals cheap,--a noble memory!\n\nCOMINIUS:\nI minded him how royal 'twas to pardon\nWhen it was less expected: he replied,\nIt was a bare petition of a state\nTo one whom they had punish'd.\n\nMENENIUS:\nVery well:\nCould he say less?\n\nCOMINIUS:\nI offer'd to awaken his regard\nFor's private friends: his answer to me was,\nHe could not stay to pick them in a pile\nOf noisome musty chaff: he said 'twas folly,\nFor one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt,\nAnd still to nose the offence.\n\nMENENIUS:\nFor one poor grain or two!\nI am one of those; his mother, wife, his child,\nAnd this brave fellow too, we are the grains:\nYou are the musty chaff; and you are smelt\nAbove the moon: we must be burnt for you.\n\nSICINIUS:\nNay, pray, be patient: if you refuse your aid\nIn this so never-needed help, yet do not\nUpbraid's with our distress. But, sure, if you\nWould be your country's pleader, your good tongue,\nMore than the instant army we can make,\nMight stop our countryman.\n\nMENENIUS:\nNo, I'll not meddle.\n\nSICINIUS:\nPray you, go to him.\n\nMENENIUS:\nWhat should I do?\n\nBRUTUS:\nOnly make trial what your love can do\nFor Rome, towards Marcius.\n\nMENENIUS:\nWell, and say that Marcius\nReturn me, as Cominius is return'd,\nUnheard; what then?\nBut as a discontented friend, grief-shot\nWith his unkindness? say't be so?\n\nSICINIUS:\nYet your good will\nmust have that thanks from Rome, after the measure\nAs you intended well.\n\nMENENIUS:\nI'll undertake 't:\nI think he'll hear me. Yet, to bite his lip\nAnd hum at good Cominius, much unhearts me.\nHe was not taken well; he had not dined:\nThe veins unfill'd, our blood is cold, and then\nWe pout upon the morning, are unapt\nTo give or to forgive; but when we have stuff'd\nThese and these conveyances of our blood\nWith wine and feeding, we have suppler souls\nThan in our priest-like fasts: therefore I'll watch him\nTill he be dieted to my request,\nAnd then I'll set upon him.\n\nBRUTUS:\nYou know the very road into his kindness,\nAnd cannot lose your way.\n\nMENENIUS:\nGood faith, I'll prove him,\nSpeed how it will. I shall ere long have knowledge\nOf my success.\n\nCOMINIUS:\nHe'll never hear him.\n\nSICINIUS:\nNot?\n\nCOMINIUS:\nI tell you, he does sit in gold, his eye\nRed as 'twould burn Rome; and his injury\nThe gaoler to his pity. I kneel'd before him;\n'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise;' dismiss'd me\nThus, with his speechless hand: what he would do,\nHe sent in writing after me; what he would not,\nBound with an oath to yield to his conditions:\nSo that all hope is vain.\nUnless his noble mother, and his wife;\nWho, as I hear, mean to solicit him\nFor mercy to his country. Therefore, let's hence,\nAnd with our fair entreaties haste them on.\n\nFirst Senator:\nStay: whence are you?\n\nSecond Senator:\nStand, and go back.\n\nMENENIUS:\nYou guard like men; 'tis well: but, by your leave,\nI am an officer of state, and come\nTo speak with Coriolanus.\n\nFirst Senator:\nFrom whence?\n\nMENENIUS:\nFrom Rome.\n\nFirst Senator:\nYou may not pass, you must return: our general\nWill no more hear from thence.\n\nSecond Senator:\nYou'll see your Rome embraced with fire before\nYou'll speak with Coriolanus.\n\nMENENIUS:\nGood my friends,\nIf you have heard your general talk of Rome,\nAnd of his friends there, it is lots to blanks,\nMy name hath touch'd your ears it is Menenius.\n\nFirst Senator:\nBe it so; go back: the virtue of your name\nIs not here passable.\n\nMENENIUS:\nI tell thee, fellow,\nThe general is my lover: I have been\nThe book of his good acts, whence men have read\nHis name unparallel'd, haply amplified;\nFor I have ever verified my friends,\nOf whom he's chief, with all the size that verity\nWould without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes,\nLike to a bowl upon a subtle ground,\nI have tumbled past the throw; and in his praise\nHave almost stamp'd the leasing: therefore, fellow,\nI must have leave to pass.\n\nFirst Senator:\nFaith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his\nbehalf as you have uttered words in your own, you\nshould not pass here; no, though it were as virtuous\nto lie as to live chastely. Therefore, go back.\n\nMENENIUS:\nPrithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius,\nalways factionary on the party of your general.\n\nSecond Senator:\nHowsoever you have been his liar, as you say you\nhave, I am one that, telling true under him, must\nsay, you cannot pass. Therefore, go back.\n\nMENENIUS:\nHas he dined, canst thou tell? for I would not\nspeak with him till after dinner.\n\nFirst Senator:\nYou are a Roman, are you?\n\nMENENIUS:\nI am, as thy general is.\n\nFirst Senator:\nThen you should hate Rome, as he does. Can you,\nwhen you have pushed out your gates the very\ndefender of them, and, in a violent popular\nignorance, given your enemy your shield, think to\nfront his revenges with the easy groans of old\nwomen, the virginal palms of your daughters, or with\nthe palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as\nyou seem to be? Can you think to blow out the\nintended fire your city is ready to flame in, with\nsuch weak breath as this? No, you are deceived;\ntherefore, back to Rome, and prepare for your\nexecution: you are condemned, our general has sworn\nyou out of reprieve and pardon.\n\nMENENIUS:\nSirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, he would\nuse me with estimation.\n\nSecond Senator:\nCome, my captain knows you not.\n\nMENENIUS:\nI mean, thy general.\n\nFirst Senator:\nMy general cares not for you. Back, I say, go; lest\nI let forth your half-pint of blood; back,--that's\nthe utmost of your having: back.\n\nMENENIUS:\nNay, but, fellow, fellow,--\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nWhat's the matter?\n\nMENENIUS:\nNow, you companion, I'll say an errand for you:\nYou shall know now that I am in estimation; you shall\nperceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from\nmy son Coriolanus: guess, but by my entertainment\nwith him, if thou standest not i' the state of\nhanging, or of some death more long in\nspectatorship, and crueller in suffering; behold now\npresently, and swoon for what's to come upon thee.\nThe glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy\nparticular prosperity, and love thee no worse than\nthy old father Menenius does! O my son, my son!\nthou art preparing fire for us; look thee, here's\nwater to quench it. I was hardly moved to come to\nthee; but being assured none but myself could move\nthee, I have been blown out of your gates with\nsighs; and conjure thee to pardon Rome, and thy\npetitionary countrymen. The good gods assuage thy\nwrath, and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet\nhere,--this, who, like a block, hath denied my\naccess to thee.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nAway!\n\nMENENIUS:\nHow! away!\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nWife, mother, child, I know not. My affairs\nAre servanted to others: though I owe\nMy revenge properly, my remission lies\nIn Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar,\nIngrate forgetfulness shall poison, rather\nThan pity note how much. Therefore, be gone.\nMine ears against your suits are stronger than\nYour gates against my force. Yet, for I loved thee,\nTake this along; I writ it for thy sake\nAnd would have rent it. Another word, Menenius,\nI will not hear thee speak. This man, Aufidius,\nWas my beloved in Rome: yet thou behold'st!\n\nAUFIDIUS:\nYou keep a constant temper.\n\nFirst Senator:\nNow, sir, is your name Menenius?\n\nSecond Senator:\n'Tis a spell, you see, of much power: you know the\nway home again.\n\nFirst Senator:\nDo you hear how we are shent for keeping your\ngreatness back?\n\nSecond Senator:\nWhat cause, do you think, I have to swoon?\n\nMENENIUS:\nI neither care for the world nor your general: for\nsuch things as you, I can scarce think there's any,\nye're so slight. He that hath a will to die by\nhimself fears it not from another: let your general\ndo his worst. For you, be that you are, long; and\nyour misery increase with your age! I say to you,\nas I was said to, Away!\n\nFirst Senator:\nA noble fellow, I warrant him.\n\nSecond Senator:\nThe worthy fellow is our general: he's the rock, the\noak not to be wind-shaken.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nWe will before the walls of Rome tomorrow\nSet down our host. My partner in this action,\nYou must report to the Volscian lords, how plainly\nI have borne this business.\n\nAUFIDIUS:\nOnly their ends\nYou have respected; stopp'd your ears against\nThe general suit of Rome; never admitted\nA private whisper, no, not with such friends\nThat thought them sure of you.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nThis last old man,\nWhom with a crack'd heart I have sent to Rome,\nLoved me above the measure of a father;\nNay, godded me, indeed. Their latest refuge\nWas to send him; for whose old love I have,\nThough I show'd sourly to him, once more offer'd\nThe first conditions, which they did refuse\nAnd cannot now accept; to grace him only\nThat thought he could do more, a very little\nI have yielded to: fresh embassies and suits,\nNor from the state nor private friends, hereafter\nWill I lend ear to. Ha! what shout is this?\nShall I be tempted to infringe my vow\nIn the same time 'tis made? I will not.\nMy wife comes foremost; then the honour'd mould\nWherein this trunk was framed, and in her hand\nThe grandchild to her blood. But, out, affection!\nAll bond and privilege of nature, break!\nLet it be virtuous to be obstinate.\nWhat is that curt'sy worth? or those doves' eyes,\nWhich can make gods forsworn? I melt, and am not\nOf stronger earth than others. My mother bows;\nAs if Olympus to a molehill should\nIn supplication nod: and my young boy\nHath an aspect of intercession, which\nGreat nature cries 'Deny not.' let the Volsces\nPlough Rome and harrow Italy: I'll never\nBe such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand,\nAs if a man were author of himself\nAnd knew no other kin.\n\nVIRGILIA:\nMy lord and husband!\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nThese eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.\n\nVIRGILIA:\nThe sorrow that delivers us thus changed\nMakes you think so.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nLike a dull actor now,\nI have forgot my part, and I am out,\nEven to a full disgrace. Best of my flesh,\nForgive my tyranny; but do not say\nFor that 'Forgive our Romans.' O, a kiss\nLong as my exile, sweet as my revenge!\nNow, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kiss\nI carried from thee, dear; and my true lip\nHath virgin'd it e'er since. You gods! I prate,\nAnd the most noble mother of the world\nLeave unsaluted: sink, my knee, i' the earth;\nOf thy deep duty more impression show\nThan that of common sons.\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nO, stand up blest!\nWhilst, with no softer cushion than the flint,\nI kneel before thee; and unproperly\nShow duty, as mistaken all this while\nBetween the child and parent.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nWhat is this?\nYour knees to me? to your corrected son?\nThen let the pebbles on the hungry beach\nFillip the stars; then let the mutinous winds\nStrike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun;\nMurdering impossibility, to make\nWhat cannot be, slight work.\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nThou art my warrior;\nI holp to frame thee. Do you know this lady?\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nThe noble sister of Publicola,\nThe moon of Rome, chaste as the icicle\nThat's curdied by the frost from purest snow\nAnd hangs on Dian's temple: dear Valeria!\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nThis is a poor epitome of yours,\nWhich by the interpretation of full time\nMay show like all yourself.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nThe god of soldiers,\nWith the consent of supreme Jove, inform\nThy thoughts with nobleness; that thou mayst prove\nTo shame unvulnerable, and stick i' the wars\nLike a great sea-mark, standing every flaw,\nAnd saving those that eye thee!\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nYour knee, sirrah.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nThat's my brave boy!\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nEven he, your wife, this lady, and myself,\nAre suitors to you.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nI beseech you, peace:\nOr, if you'ld ask, remember this before:\nThe thing I have forsworn to grant may never\nBe held by you denials. Do not bid me\nDismiss my soldiers, or capitulate\nAgain with Rome's mechanics: tell me not\nWherein I seem unnatural: desire not\nTo ally my rages and revenges with\nYour colder reasons.\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nO, no more, no more!\nYou have said you will not grant us any thing;\nFor we have nothing else to ask, but that\nWhich you deny already: yet we will ask;\nThat, if you fail in our request, the blame\nMay hang upon your hardness: therefore hear us.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nAufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for we'll\nHear nought from Rome in private. Your request?\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nShould we be silent and not speak, our raiment\nAnd state of bodies would bewray what life\nWe have led since thy exile. Think with thyself\nHow more unfortunate than all living women\nAre we come hither: since that thy sight,\nwhich should\nMake our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance\nwith comforts,\nConstrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow;\nMaking the mother, wife and child to see\nThe son, the husband and the father tearing\nHis country's bowels out. And to poor we\nThine enmity's most capital: thou barr'st us\nOur prayers to the gods, which is a comfort\nThat all but we enjoy; for how can we,\nAlas, how can we for our country pray.\nWhereto we are bound, together with thy victory,\nWhereto we are bound? alack, or we must lose\nThe country, our dear nurse, or else thy person,\nOur comfort in the country. We must find\nAn evident calamity, though we had\nOur wish, which side should win: for either thou\nMust, as a foreign recreant, be led\nWith manacles thorough our streets, or else\ntriumphantly tread on thy country's ruin,\nAnd bear the palm for having bravely shed\nThy wife and children's blood. For myself, son,\nI purpose not to wait on fortune till\nThese wars determine: if I cannot persuade thee\nRather to show a noble grace to both parts\nThan seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner\nMarch to assault thy country than to tread--\nTrust to't, thou shalt not--on thy mother's womb,\nThat brought thee to this world.\n\nVIRGILIA:\nAy, and mine,\nThat brought you forth this boy, to keep your name\nLiving to time.\n\nYoung MARCIUS:\nA' shall not tread on me;\nI'll run away till I am bigger, but then I'll fight.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nNot of a woman's tenderness to be,\nRequires nor child nor woman's face to see.\nI have sat too long.\n\nVOLUMNIA:\nNay, go not from us thus.\nIf it were so that our request did tend\nTo save the Romans, thereby to destroy\nThe Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us,\nAs poisonous of your honour: no; our suit\nIs that you reconcile them: while the Volsces\nMay say 'This mercy we have show'd;' the Romans,\n'This we received;' and each in either side\nGive the all-hail to thee and cry 'Be blest\nFor making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son,\nThe end of war's uncertain, but this certain,\nThat, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit\nWhich thou shalt thereby reap is such a name,\nWhose repetition will be dogg'd with curses;\nWhose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble,\nBut with his last attempt he wiped it out;\nDestroy'd his country, and his name remains\nTo the ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son:\nThou hast affected the fine strains of honour,\nTo imitate the graces of the gods;\nTo tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air,\nAnd yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt\nThat should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?\nThink'st thou it honourable for a noble man\nStill to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:\nHe cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:\nPerhaps thy childishness will move him more\nThan can our reasons. There's no man in the world\nMore bound to 's mother; yet here he lets me prate\nLike one i' the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life\nShow'd thy dear mother any courtesy,\nWhen she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,\nHas cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home,\nLoaden with honour. Say my request's unjust,\nAnd spurn me back: but if it be not so,\nThou art not honest; and the gods will plague thee,\nThat thou restrain'st from me the duty which\nTo a mother's part belongs. He turns away:\nDown, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.\nTo his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride\nThan pity to our prayers. Down: an end;\nThis is the last: so we will home to Rome,\nAnd die among our neighbours. Nay, behold 's:\nThis boy, that cannot tell what he would have\nBut kneels and holds up bands for fellowship,\nDoes reason our petition with more strength\nThan thou hast to deny 't. Come, let us go:\nThis fellow had a Volscian to his mother;\nHis wife is in Corioli and his child\nLike him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch:\nI am hush'd until our city be a-fire,\nAnd then I'll speak a little.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nO mother, mother!\nWhat have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope,\nThe gods look down, and this unnatural scene\nThey laugh at. O my mother, mother! O!\nYou have won a happy victory to Rome;\nBut, for your son,--believe it, O, believe it,\nMost dangerously you have with him prevail'd,\nIf not most mortal to him. But, let it come.\nAufidius, though I cannot make true wars,\nI'll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius,\nWere you in my stead, would you have heard\nA mother less? or granted less, Aufidius?\n\nAUFIDIUS:\nI was moved withal.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nI dare be sworn you were:\nAnd, sir, it is no little thing to make\nMine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good sir,\nWhat peace you'll make, advise me: for my part,\nI'll not to Rome, I'll back with you; and pray you,\nStand to me in this cause. O mother! wife!\n\nAUFIDIUS:\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nAy, by and by;\nBut we will drink together; and you shall bear\nA better witness back than words, which we,\nOn like conditions, will have counter-seal'd.\nCome, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve\nTo have a temple built you: all the swords\nIn Italy, and her confederate arms,\nCould not have made this peace.\n\nMENENIUS:\nSee you yond coign o' the Capitol, yond\ncorner-stone?\n\nSICINIUS:\nWhy, what of that?\n\nMENENIUS:\nIf it be possible for you to displace it with your\nlittle finger, there is some hope the ladies of\nRome, especially his mother, may prevail with him.\nBut I say there is no hope in't: our throats are\nsentenced and stay upon execution.\n\nSICINIUS:\nIs't possible that so short a time can alter the\ncondition of a man!\n\nMENENIUS:\nThere is differency between a grub and a butterfly;\nyet your butterfly was a grub. This Marcius is grown\nfrom man to dragon: he has wings; he's more than a\ncreeping thing.\n\nSICINIUS:\nHe loved his mother dearly.\n\nMENENIUS:\nSo did he me: and he no more remembers his mother\nnow than an eight-year-old horse. The tartness\nof his face sours ripe grapes: when he walks, he\nmoves like an engine, and the ground shrinks before\nhis treading: he is able to pierce a corslet with\nhis eye; talks like a knell, and his hum is a\nbattery. He sits in his state, as a thing made for\nAlexander. What he bids be done is finished with\nhis bidding. He wants nothing of a god but eternity\nand a heaven to throne in.\n\nSICINIUS:\nYes, mercy, if you report him truly.\n\nMENENIUS:\nI paint him in the character. Mark what mercy his\nmother shall bring from him: there is no more mercy\nin him than there is milk in a male tiger; that\nshall our poor city find: and all this is long of\nyou.\n\nSICINIUS:\nThe gods be good unto us!\n\nMENENIUS:\nNo, in such a case the gods will not be good unto\nus. When we banished him, we respected not them;\nand, he returning to break our necks, they respect not us.\n\nMessenger:\nSir, if you'ld save your life, fly to your house:\nThe plebeians have got your fellow-tribune\nAnd hale him up and down, all swearing, if\nThe Roman ladies bring not comfort home,\nThey'll give him death by inches.\n\nSICINIUS:\nWhat's the news?\n\nSecond Messenger:\nGood news, good news; the ladies have prevail'd,\nThe Volscians are dislodged, and Marcius gone:\nA merrier day did never yet greet Rome,\nNo, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.\n\nSICINIUS:\nFriend,\nArt thou certain this is true? is it most certain?\n\nSecond Messenger:\nAs certain as I know the sun is fire:\nWhere have you lurk'd, that you make doubt of it?\nNe'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide,\nAs the recomforted through the gates. Why, hark you!\nThe trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries and fifes,\nTabours and cymbals and the shouting Romans,\nMake the sun dance. Hark you!\n\nMENENIUS:\nThis is good news:\nI will go meet the ladies. This Volumnia\nIs worth of consuls, senators, patricians,\nA city full; of tribunes, such as you,\nA sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day:\nThis morning for ten thousand of your throats\nI'd not have given a doit. Hark, how they joy!\n\nSICINIUS:\nFirst, the gods bless you for your tidings; next,\nAccept my thankfulness.\n\nSecond Messenger:\nSir, we have all\nGreat cause to give great thanks.\n\nSICINIUS:\nThey are near the city?\n\nSecond Messenger:\nAlmost at point to enter.\n\nSICINIUS:\nWe will meet them,\nAnd help the joy.\n\nFirst Senator:\nBehold our patroness, the life of Rome!\nCall all your tribes together, praise the gods,\nAnd make triumphant fires; strew flowers before them:\nUnshout the noise that banish'd Marcius,\nRepeal him with the welcome of his mother;\nCry 'Welcome, ladies, welcome!'\n\nAll:\nWelcome, ladies, Welcome!\n\nAUFIDIUS:\nGo tell the lords o' the city I am here:\nDeliver them this paper: having read it,\nBid them repair to the market place; where I,\nEven in theirs and in the commons' ears,\nWill vouch the truth of it. Him I accuse\nThe city ports by this hath enter'd and\nIntends to appear before the people, hoping\nTo purge herself with words: dispatch.\nMost welcome!\n\nFirst Conspirator:\nHow is it with our general?\n\nAUFIDIUS:\nEven so\nAs with a man by his own alms empoison'd,\nAnd with his charity slain.\n\nSecond Conspirator:\nMost noble sir,\nIf you do hold the same intent wherein\nYou wish'd us parties, we'll deliver you\nOf your great danger.\n\nAUFIDIUS:\nSir, I cannot tell:\nWe must proceed as we do find the people.\n\nThird Conspirator:\nThe people will remain uncertain whilst\n'Twixt you there's difference; but the fall of either\nMakes the survivor heir of all.\n\nAUFIDIUS:\nI know it;\nAnd my pretext to strike at him admits\nA good construction. I raised him, and I pawn'd\nMine honour for his truth: who being so heighten'd,\nHe water'd his new plants with dews of flattery,\nSeducing so my friends; and, to this end,\nHe bow'd his nature, never known before\nBut to be rough, unswayable and free.\n\nThird Conspirator:\nSir, his stoutness\nWhen he did stand for consul, which he lost\nBy lack of stooping,--\n\nAUFIDIUS:\nThat I would have spoke of:\nBeing banish'd for't, he came unto my hearth;\nPresented to my knife his throat: I took him;\nMade him joint-servant with me; gave him way\nIn all his own desires; nay, let him choose\nOut of my files, his projects to accomplish,\nMy best and freshest men; served his designments\nIn mine own person; holp to reap the fame\nWhich he did end all his; and took some pride\nTo do myself this wrong: till, at the last,\nI seem'd his follower, not partner, and\nHe waged me with his countenance, as if\nI had been mercenary.\n\nFirst Conspirator:\nSo he did, my lord:\nThe army marvell'd at it, and, in the last,\nWhen he had carried Rome and that we look'd\nFor no less spoil than glory,--\n\nAUFIDIUS:\nThere was it:\nFor which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him.\nAt a few drops of women's rheum, which are\nAs cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labour\nOf our great action: therefore shall he die,\nAnd I'll renew me in his fall. But, hark!\n\nFirst Conspirator:\nYour native town you enter'd like a post,\nAnd had no welcomes home: but he returns,\nSplitting the air with noise.\n\nSecond Conspirator:\nAnd patient fools,\nWhose children he hath slain, their base throats tear\nWith giving him glory.\n\nThird Conspirator:\nTherefore, at your vantage,\nEre he express himself, or move the people\nWith what he would say, let him feel your sword,\nWhich we will second. When he lies along,\nAfter your way his tale pronounced shall bury\nHis reasons with his body.\n\nAUFIDIUS:\nSay no more:\nHere come the lords.\n\nAll The Lords:\nYou are most welcome home.\n\nAUFIDIUS:\nI have not deserved it.\nBut, worthy lords, have you with heed perused\nWhat I have written to you?\n\nLords:\nWe have.\n\nFirst Lord:\nAnd grieve to hear't.\nWhat faults he made before the last, I think\nMight have found easy fines: but there to end\nWhere he was to begin and give away\nThe benefit of our levies, answering us\nWith our own charge, making a treaty where\nThere was a yielding,--this admits no excuse.\n\nAUFIDIUS:\nHe approaches: you shall hear him.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nHail, lords! I am return'd your soldier,\nNo more infected with my country's love\nThan when I parted hence, but still subsisting\nUnder your great command. You are to know\nThat prosperously I have attempted and\nWith bloody passage led your wars even to\nThe gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home\nDo more than counterpoise a full third part\nThe charges of the action. We have made peace\nWith no less honour to the Antiates\nThan shame to the Romans: and we here deliver,\nSubscribed by the consuls and patricians,\nTogether with the seal o' the senate, what\nWe have compounded on.\n\nAUFIDIUS:\nRead it not, noble lords;\nBut tell the traitor, in the high'st degree\nHe hath abused your powers.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nTraitor! how now!\n\nAUFIDIUS:\nAy, traitor, Marcius!\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nMarcius!\n\nAUFIDIUS:\nAy, Marcius, Caius Marcius: dost thou think\nI'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol'n name\nCoriolanus in Corioli?\nYou lords and heads o' the state, perfidiously\nHe has betray'd your business, and given up,\nFor certain drops of salt, your city Rome,\nI say 'your city,' to his wife and mother;\nBreaking his oath and resolution like\nA twist of rotten silk, never admitting\nCounsel o' the war, but at his nurse's tears\nHe whined and roar'd away your victory,\nThat pages blush'd at him and men of heart\nLook'd wondering each at other.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nHear'st thou, Mars?\n\nAUFIDIUS:\nName not the god, thou boy of tears!\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nHa!\n\nAUFIDIUS:\nNo more.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nMeasureless liar, thou hast made my heart\nToo great for what contains it. Boy! O slave!\nPardon me, lords, 'tis the first time that ever\nI was forced to scold. Your judgments, my grave lords,\nMust give this cur the lie: and his own notion--\nWho wears my stripes impress'd upon him; that\nMust bear my beating to his grave--shall join\nTo thrust the lie unto him.\n\nFirst Lord:\nPeace, both, and hear me speak.\n\nCORIOLANUS:\nCut me to pieces, Volsces; men and lads,\nStain all your edges on me. Boy! false hound!\nIf you have writ your annals true, 'tis there,\nThat, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I\nFlutter'd your Volscians in Corioli:\nAlone I did it. Boy!\n\nAUFIDIUS:\nWhy, noble lords,\nWill you be put in mind of his blind fortune,\nWhich was your shame, by this unholy braggart,\n'Fore your own eyes and ears?\n\nAll Conspirators:\nLet him die for't.\n\nAll The People:\n'Tear him to pieces.' 'Do it presently.' 'He kill'd\nmy son.' 'My daughter.' 'He killed my cousin\nMarcus.' 'He killed my father.'\n\nSecond Lord:\nPeace, ho! no outrage: peace!\nThe man is noble and his fame folds-in\nThis orb o' the earth. His last offences to us\nShall have judicious hearing.

Masters all, be quiet;\nPut up your swords.\n\nAUFIDIUS:\nMy lords, when you shall know--as in this rage,\nProvoked by him, you cannot--the great danger\nWhich this man's life did owe you, you'll rejoice\nThat he is thus cut off. Please it your honours\nTo call me to your senate, I'll deliver\nMyself your loyal servant, or endure\nYour heaviest censure.\n\nFirst Lord:\nBear from hence his body;\nAnd mourn you for him: let him be regarded\nAs the most noble corse that ever herald\nDid follow to his urn.\n\nSecond Lord:\nHis own impatience\nTakes from Aufidius a great part of blame.\nLet's make the best of it.\n\nAUFIDIUS:\nMy rage is gone;\nAnd I am struck with sorrow. Take him up.\nHelp, three o' the chiefest soldiers; I'll be one.\nBeat thou the drum, that it speak mournfully:\nTrail your steel pikes. Though in this city he\nHath widow'd and unchilded many a one,\nWhich to this hour bewail the injury,\nYet he shall have a noble memory. Assist.\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nNow is the winter of our discontent\nMade glorious summer by this sun of York;\nAnd all the clouds that lour'd upon our house\nIn the deep bosom of the ocean buried.\nNow are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;\nOur bruised arms hung up for monuments;\nOur stern alarums changed to merry meetings,\nOur dreadful marches to delightful measures.\nGrim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;\nAnd now, instead of mounting barded steeds\nTo fright the souls of fearful adversaries,\nHe capers nimbly in a lady's chamber\nTo the lascivious pleasing of a lute.\nBut I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,\nNor made to court an amorous looking-glass;\nI, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty\nTo strut before a wanton ambling nymph;\nI, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,\nCheated of feature by dissembling nature,\nDeformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time\nInto this breathing world, scarce half made up,\nAnd that so lamely and unfashionable\nThat dogs bark at me as I halt by them;\nWhy, I, in this weak piping time of peace,\nHave no delight to pass away the time,\nUnless to spy my shadow in the sun\nAnd descant on mine own deformity:\nAnd therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,\nTo entertain these fair well-spoken days,\nI am determined to prove a villain\nAnd hate the idle pleasures of these days.\nPlots have I laid, inductions dangerous,\nBy drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,\nTo set my brother Clarence and the king\nIn deadly hate the one against the other:\nAnd if King Edward be as true and just\nAs I am subtle, false and treacherous,\nThis day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,\nAbout a prophecy, which says that 'G'\nOf Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.\nDive, thoughts, down to my soul: here\nClarence comes.\nBrother, good day; what means this armed guard\nThat waits upon your grace?\n\nCLARENCE:\nHis majesty\nTendering my person's safety, hath appointed\nThis conduct to convey me to the Tower.\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nUpon what cause?\n\nCLARENCE:\nBecause my name is George.\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nAlack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;\nHe should, for that, commit your godfathers:\nO, belike his majesty hath some intent\nThat you shall be new-christen'd in the Tower.\nBut what's the matter, Clarence?  may I know?\n\nCLARENCE:\nYea, Richard, when I know; for I protest\nAs yet I do not: but, as I can learn,\nHe hearkens after prophecies and dreams;\nAnd from the cross-row plucks the letter G.\nAnd says a wizard told him that by G\nHis issue disinherited should be;\nAnd, for my name of George begins with G,\nIt follows in his thought that I am he.\nThese, as I learn, and such like toys as these\nHave moved his highness to commit me now.\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nWhy, this it is, when men are ruled by women:\n'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower:\nMy Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she\nThat tempers him to this extremity.\nWas it not she and that good man of worship,\nAnthony Woodville, her brother there,\nThat made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,\nFrom whence this present day he is deliver'd?\nWe are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.\n\nCLARENCE:\nBy heaven, I think there's no man is secure\nBut the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds\nThat trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore.\nHeard ye not what an humble suppliant\nLord hastings was to her for his delivery?\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nHumbly complaining to her deity\nGot my lord chamberlain his liberty.\nI'll tell you what; I think it is our way,\nIf we will keep in favour with the king,\nTo be her men and wear her livery:\nThe jealous o'erworn widow and herself,\nSince that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen.\nAre mighty gossips in this monarchy.\n\nBRAKENBURY:\nI beseech your graces both to pardon me;\nHis majesty hath straitly given in charge\nThat no man shall have private conference,\nOf what degree soever, with his brother.\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nEven so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury,\nYou may partake of any thing we say:\nWe speak no treason, man: we say the king\nIs wise and virtuous, and his noble queen\nWell struck in years, fair, and not jealous;\nWe say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,\nA cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;\nAnd that the queen's kindred are made gentle-folks:\nHow say you sir? Can you deny all this?\n\nBRAKENBURY:\nWith this, my lord, myself have nought to do.\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nNaught to do with mistress Shore! I tell thee, fellow,\nHe that doth naught with her, excepting one,\nWere best he do it secretly, alone.\n\nBRAKENBURY:\nWhat one, my lord?\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nHer husband, knave: wouldst thou betray me?\n\nBRAKENBURY:\nI beseech your grace to pardon me, and withal\nForbear your conference with the noble duke.\n\nCLARENCE:\nWe know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nWe are the queen's abjects, and must obey.\nBrother, farewell: I will unto the king;\nAnd whatsoever you will employ me in,\nWere it to call King Edward's widow sister,\nI will perform it to enfranchise you.\nMeantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood\nTouches me deeper than you can imagine.\n\nCLARENCE:\nI know it pleaseth neither of us well.\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nWell, your imprisonment shall not be long;\nMeantime, have patience.\n\nCLARENCE:\nI must perforce.

As we paced along\nUpon the giddy footing of the hatches,\nMethought that Gloucester stumbled; and, in falling,\nStruck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,\nInto the tumbling billows of the main.\nLord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!\nWhat dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!\nWhat ugly sights of death within mine eyes!\nMethought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;\nTen thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon;\nWedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,\nInestimable stones, unvalued jewels,\nAll scatter'd in the bottom of the sea:\nSome lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes\nWhere eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,\nAs 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,\nWhich woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep,\nAnd mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by.\n\nBRAKENBURY:\nHad you such leisure in the time of death\nTo gaze upon the secrets of the deep?\n\nCLARENCE:\nMethought I had; and often did I strive\nTo yield the ghost: but still the envious flood\nKept in my soul, and would not let it forth\nTo seek the empty, vast and wandering air;\nBut smother'd it within my panting bulk,\nWhich almost burst to belch it in the sea.\n\nBRAKENBURY:\nAwaked you not with this sore agony?\n\nCLARENCE:\nO, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life;\nO, then began the tempest to my soul,\nWho pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood,\nWith that grim ferryman which poets write of,\nUnto the kingdom of perpetual night.\nThe first that there did greet my stranger soul,\nWas my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick;\nWho cried aloud, 'What scourge for perjury\nCan this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?'\nAnd so he vanish'd: then came wandering by\nA shadow like an angel, with bright hair\nDabbled in blood; and he squeak'd out aloud,\n'Clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,\nThat stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury;\nSeize on him, Furies, take him to your torments!'\nWith that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends\nEnviron'd me about, and howled in mine ears\nSuch hideous cries, that with the very noise\nI trembling waked, and for a season after\nCould not believe but that I was in hell,\nSuch terrible impression made the dream.\n\nBRAKENBURY:\nNo marvel, my lord, though it affrighted you;\nI promise, I am afraid to hear you tell it.\n\nCLARENCE:\nO Brakenbury, I have done those things,\nWhich now bear evidence against my soul,\nFor Edward's sake; and see how he requites me!\nO God! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,\nBut thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,\nYet execute thy wrath in me alone,\nO, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!\nI pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;\nMy soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.\n\nBRAKENBURY:\nI will, my lord: God give your grace good rest!\nSorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,\nMakes the night morning, and the noon-tide night.\nPrinces have but their tides for their glories,\nAn outward honour for an inward toil;\nAnd, for unfelt imagination,\nThey often feel a world of restless cares:\nSo that, betwixt their tides and low names,\nThere's nothing differs but the outward fame.\n\nFirst Murderer:\nHo! who's here?\n\nBRAKENBURY:\nIn God's name what are you, and how came you hither?\n\nFirst Murderer:\nI would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on my legs.\n\nBRAKENBURY:\nYea, are you so brief?\n\nSecond Murderer:\nO sir, it is better to be brief than tedious. Show\nhim our commission; talk no more.\n\nBRAKENBURY:\nI am, in this, commanded to deliver\nThe noble Duke of Clarence to your hands:\nI will not reason what is meant hereby,\nBecause I will be guiltless of the meaning.\nHere are the keys, there sits the duke asleep:\nI'll to the king; and signify to him\nThat thus I have resign'd my charge to you.\n\nFirst Murderer:\nDo so, it is a point of wisdom: fare you well.\n\nSecond Murderer:\nWhat, shall we stab him as he sleeps?\n\nFirst Murderer:\nNo; then he will say 'twas done cowardly, when he wakes.\n\nSecond Murderer:\nWhen he wakes! why, fool, he shall never wake till\nthe judgment-day.\n\nFirst Murderer:\nWhy, then he will say we stabbed him sleeping.\n\nSecond Murderer:\nThe urging of that word 'judgment' hath bred a kind\nof remorse in me.\n\nFirst Murderer:\nWhat, art thou afraid?\n\nSecond Murderer:\nNot to kill him, having a warrant for it; but to be\ndamned for killing him, from which no warrant can defend us.\n\nFirst Murderer:\nI thought thou hadst been resolute.\n\nSecond Murderer:\nSo I am, to let him live.\n\nFirst Murderer:\nBack to the Duke of Gloucester, tell him so.\n\nSecond Murderer:\nI pray thee, stay a while: I hope my holy humour\nwill change; 'twas wont to hold me but while one\nwould tell twenty.\n\nFirst Murderer:\nHow dost thou feel thyself now?\n\nSecond Murderer:\n'Faith, some certain dregs of conscience are yet\nwithin me.\n\nFirst Murderer:\nRemember our reward, when the deed is done.\n\nSecond Murderer:\n'Zounds, he dies: I had forgot the reward.\n\nFirst Murderer:\nWhere is thy conscience now?\n\nSecond Murderer:\nIn the Duke of Gloucester's purse.\n\nFirst Murderer:\nSo when he opens his purse to give us our reward,\nthy conscience flies out.\n\nSecond Murderer:\nLet it go; there's few or none will entertain it.\n\nFirst Murderer:\nHow if it come to thee again?\n\nSecond Murderer:\nI'll not meddle with it: it is a dangerous thing: it\nmakes a man a coward: a man cannot steal, but it\naccuseth him; he cannot swear, but it cheques him;\nhe cannot lie with his neighbour's wife, but it\ndetects him: 'tis a blushing shamefast spirit that\nmutinies in a man's bosom; it fills one full of\nobstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold\nthat I found; it beggars any man that keeps it: it\nis turned out of all towns and cities for a\ndangerous thing; and every man that means to live\nwell endeavours to trust to himself and to live\nwithout it.\n\nFirst Murderer:\n'Zounds, it is even now at my elbow, persuading me\nnot to kill the duke.\n\nSecond Murderer:\nTake the devil in thy mind, and relieve him not: he\nwould insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh.\n\nFirst Murderer:\nTut, I am strong-framed, he cannot prevail with me,\nI warrant thee.\n\nSecond Murderer:\nSpoke like a tail fellow that respects his\nreputation.

Lord cardinal, will your grace\nPersuade the queen to send the Duke of York\nUnto his princely brother presently?\nIf she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,\nAnd from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.\n\nCARDINAL:\nMy Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory\nCan from his mother win the Duke of York,\nAnon expect him here; but if she be obdurate\nTo mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid\nWe should infringe the holy privilege\nOf blessed sanctuary! not for all this land\nWould I be guilty of so deep a sin.\n\nBUCKINGHAM:\nYou are too senseless--obstinate, my lord,\nToo ceremonious and traditional\nWeigh it but with the grossness of this age,\nYou break not sanctuary in seizing him.\nThe benefit thereof is always granted\nTo those whose dealings have deserved the place,\nAnd those who have the wit to claim the place:\nThis prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserved it;\nAnd therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it:\nThen, taking him from thence that is not there,\nYou break no privilege nor charter there.\nOft have I heard of sanctuary men;\nBut sanctuary children ne'er till now.\n\nCARDINAL:\nMy lord, you shall o'er-rule my mind for once.\nCome on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?\n\nHASTINGS:\nI go, my lord.\n\nPRINCE EDWARD:\nGood lords, make all the speedy haste you may.\nSay, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,\nWhere shall we sojourn till our coronation?\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nWhere it seems best unto your royal self.\nIf I may counsel you, some day or two\nYour highness shall repose you at the Tower:\nThen where you please, and shall be thought most fit\nFor your best health and recreation.\n\nPRINCE EDWARD:\nI do not like the Tower, of any place.\nDid Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?\n\nBUCKINGHAM:\nHe did, my gracious lord, begin that place;\nWhich, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.\n\nPRINCE EDWARD:\nIs it upon record, or else reported\nSuccessively from age to age, he built it?\n\nBUCKINGHAM:\nUpon record, my gracious lord.\n\nPRINCE EDWARD:\nBut say, my lord, it were not register'd,\nMethinks the truth should live from age to age,\nAs 'twere retail'd to all posterity,\nEven to the general all-ending day.\n\nGLOUCESTER:\n\nPRINCE EDWARD:\nWhat say you, uncle?\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nI say, without characters, fame lives long.\nThus, like the formal vice, Iniquity,\nI moralize two meanings in one word.\n\nPRINCE EDWARD:\nThat Julius Caesar was a famous man;\nWith what his valour did enrich his wit,\nHis wit set down to make his valour live\nDeath makes no conquest of this conqueror;\nFor now he lives in fame, though not in life.\nI'll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham,--\n\nBUCKINGHAM:\nWhat, my gracious lord?\n\nPRINCE EDWARD:\nAn if I live until I be a man,\nI'll win our ancient right in France again,\nOr die a soldier, as I lived a king.\n\nGLOUCESTER:\n\nBUCKINGHAM:\nNow, in good time, here comes the Duke of York.\n\nPRINCE EDWARD:\nRichard of York! how fares our loving brother?\n\nYORK:\nWell, my dread lord; so must I call you now.\n\nPRINCE EDWARD:\nAy, brother, to our grief, as it is yours:\nToo late he died that might have kept that title,\nWhich by his death hath lost much majesty.\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nHow fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?\n\nYORK:\nI thank you, gentle uncle.

O, that's the sword to it.\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nA gentle cousin, were it light enough.\n\nYORK:\nO, then, I see, you will part but with light gifts;\nIn weightier things you'll say a beggar nay.\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nIt is too heavy for your grace to wear.\n\nYORK:\nI weigh it lightly, were it heavier.\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nWhat, would you have my weapon, little lord?\n\nYORK:\nI would, that I might thank you as you call me.\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nHow?\n\nYORK:\nLittle.\n\nPRINCE EDWARD:\nMy Lord of York will still be cross in talk:\nUncle, your grace knows how to bear with him.\n\nYORK:\nYou mean, to bear me, not to bear with me:\nUncle, my brother mocks both you and me;\nBecause that I am little, like an ape,\nHe thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.\n\nBUCKINGHAM:\nWith what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!\nTo mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle,\nHe prettily and aptly taunts himself:\nSo cunning and so young is wonderful.\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nMy lord, will't please you pass along?\nMyself and my good cousin Buckingham\nWill to your mother, to entreat of her\nTo meet you at the Tower and welcome you.\n\nYORK:\nWhat, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?\n\nPRINCE EDWARD:\nMy lord protector needs will have it so.\n\nYORK:\nI shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nWhy, what should you fear?\n\nYORK:\nMarry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost:\nMy grandam told me he was murdered there.\n\nPRINCE EDWARD:\nI fear no uncles dead.\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nNor none that live, I hope.\n\nPRINCE EDWARD:\nAn if they live, I hope I need not fear.\nBut come, my lord; and with a heavy heart,\nThinking on them, go I unto the Tower.\n\nBUCKINGHAM:\nThink you, my lord, this little prating York\nWas not incensed by his subtle mother\nTo taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nNo doubt, no doubt; O, 'tis a parlous boy;\nBold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable\nHe is all the mother's, from the top to toe.\n\nBUCKINGHAM:\nWell, let them rest.

a drum.\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nCatesby, o'erlook the walls.\n\nBUCKINGHAM:\nLord mayor, the reason we have sent--\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nLook back, defend thee, here are enemies.\n\nBUCKINGHAM:\nGod and our innocency defend and guard us!\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nBe patient, they are friends, Ratcliff and Lovel.\n\nLOVEL:\nHere is the head of that ignoble traitor,\nThe dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nSo dear I loved the man, that I must weep.\nI took him for the plainest harmless creature\nThat breathed upon this earth a Christian;\nMade him my book wherein my soul recorded\nThe history of all her secret thoughts:\nSo smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue,\nThat, his apparent open guilt omitted,\nI mean, his conversation with Shore's wife,\nHe lived from all attainder of suspect.\n\nBUCKINGHAM:\nWell, well, he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor\nThat ever lived.\nWould you imagine, or almost believe,\nWere't not that, by great preservation,\nWe live to tell it you, the subtle traitor\nThis day had plotted, in the council-house\nTo murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester?\n\nLord Mayor:\nWhat, had he so?\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nWhat, think You we are Turks or infidels?\nOr that we would, against the form of law,\nProceed thus rashly to the villain's death,\nBut that the extreme peril of the case,\nThe peace of England and our persons' safety,\nEnforced us to this execution?\n\nLord Mayor:\nNow, fair befall you! he deserved his death;\nAnd you my good lords, both have well proceeded,\nTo warn false traitors from the like attempts.\nI never look'd for better at his hands,\nAfter he once fell in with Mistress Shore.\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nYet had not we determined he should die,\nUntil your lordship came to see his death;\nWhich now the loving haste of these our friends,\nSomewhat against our meaning, have prevented:\nBecause, my lord, we would have had you heard\nThe traitor speak, and timorously confess\nThe manner and the purpose of his treason;\nThat you might well have signified the same\nUnto the citizens, who haply may\nMisconstrue us in him and wail his death.\n\nLord Mayor:\nBut, my good lord, your grace's word shall serve,\nAs well as I had seen and heard him speak\nAnd doubt you not, right noble princes both,\nBut I'll acquaint our duteous citizens\nWith all your just proceedings in this cause.\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nAnd to that end we wish'd your lord-ship here,\nTo avoid the carping censures of the world.\n\nBUCKINGHAM:\nBut since you come too late of our intents,\nYet witness what you hear we did intend:\nAnd so, my good lord mayor, we bid farewell.\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nGo, after, after, cousin Buckingham.\nThe mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post:\nThere, at your meet'st advantage of the time,\nInfer the bastardy of Edward's children:\nTell them how Edward put to death a citizen,\nOnly for saying he would make his son\nHeir to the crown; meaning indeed his house,\nWhich, by the sign thereof was termed so.\nMoreover, urge his hateful luxury\nAnd bestial appetite in change of lust;\nWhich stretched to their servants, daughters, wives,\nEven where his lustful eye or savage heart,\nWithout control, listed to make his prey.\nNay, for a need, thus far come near my person:\nTell them, when that my mother went with child\nOf that unsatiate Edward, noble York\nMy princely father then had wars in France\nAnd, by just computation of the time,\nFound that the issue was not his begot;\nWhich well appeared in his lineaments,\nBeing nothing like the noble duke my father:\nBut touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off,\nBecause you know, my lord, my mother lives.\n\nBUCKINGHAM:\nFear not, my lord, I'll play the orator\nAs if the golden fee for which I plead\nWere for myself: and so, my lord, adieu.\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nIf you thrive well, bring them to Baynard's Castle;\nWhere you shall find me well accompanied\nWith reverend fathers and well-learned bishops.\n\nBUCKINGHAM:\nI go: and towards three or four o'clock\nLook for the news that the Guildhall affords.\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nGo, Lovel, with all speed to Doctor Shaw;\nGo thou to Friar Penker; bid them both\nMeet me within this hour at Baynard's Castle.\nNow will I in, to take some privy order,\nTo draw the brats of Clarence out of sight;\nAnd to give notice, that no manner of person\nAt any time have recourse unto the princes.\n\nScrivener:\nThis is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings;\nWhich in a set hand fairly is engross'd,\nThat it may be this day read over in Paul's.\nAnd mark how well the sequel hangs together:\nEleven hours I spent to write it over,\nFor yesternight by Catesby was it brought me;\nThe precedent was full as long a-doing:\nAnd yet within these five hours lived Lord Hastings,\nUntainted, unexamined, free, at liberty\nHere's a good world the while! Why who's so gross,\nThat seeth not this palpable device?\nYet who's so blind, but says he sees it not?\nBad is the world; and all will come to nought,\nWhen such bad dealings must be seen in thought.\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nHow now, my lord, what say the citizens?\n\nBUCKINGHAM:\nNow, by the holy mother of our Lord,\nThe citizens are mum and speak not a word.\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nTouch'd you the bastardy of Edward's children?\n\nBUCKINGHAM:\nI did; with his contract with Lady Lucy,\nAnd his contract by deputy in France;\nThe insatiate greediness of his desires,\nAnd his enforcement of the city wives;\nHis tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,\nAs being got, your father then in France,\nHis resemblance, being not like the duke;\nWithal I did infer your lineaments,\nBeing the right idea of your father,\nBoth in your form and nobleness of mind;\nLaid open all your victories in Scotland,\nYour dicipline in war, wisdom in peace,\nYour bounty, virtue, fair humility:\nIndeed, left nothing fitting for the purpose\nUntouch'd, or slightly handled, in discourse\nAnd when mine oratory grew to an end\nI bid them that did love their country's good\nCry 'God save Richard, England's royal king!'\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nAh! and did they so?\n\nBUCKINGHAM:\nNo, so God help me, they spake not a word;\nBut, like dumb statues or breathing stones,\nGazed each on other, and look'd deadly pale.\nWhich when I saw, I reprehended them;\nAnd ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence:\nHis answer was, the people were not wont\nTo be spoke to but by the recorder.\nThen he was urged to tell my tale again,\n'Thus saith the duke, thus hath the duke inferr'd;'\nBut nothing spake in warrant from himself.\nWhen he had done, some followers of mine own,\nAt the lower end of the hall, hurl'd up their caps,\nAnd some ten voices cried 'God save King Richard!'\nAnd thus I took the vantage of those few,\n'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I;\n'This general applause and loving shout\nArgues your wisdoms and your love to Richard:'\nAnd even here brake off, and came away.\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nWhat tongueless blocks were they! would not they speak?\n\nBUCKINGHAM:\nNo, by my troth, my lord.\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nWill not the mayor then and his brethren come?\n\nBUCKINGHAM:\nThe mayor is here at hand: intend some fear;\nBe not you spoke with, but by mighty suit:\nAnd look you get a prayer-book in your hand,\nAnd stand betwixt two churchmen, good my lord;\nFor on that ground I'll build a holy descant:\nAnd be not easily won to our request:\nPlay the maid's part, still answer nay, and take it.\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nI go; and if you plead as well for them\nAs I can say nay to thee for myself,\nNo doubt well bring it to a happy issue.\n\nBUCKINGHAM:\nGo, go, up to the leads; the lord mayor knocks.\nWelcome my lord; I dance attendance here;\nI think the duke will not be spoke withal.\nHere comes his servant: how now, Catesby,\nWhat says he?\n\nCATESBY:\nMy lord: he doth entreat your grace;\nTo visit him to-morrow or next day:\nHe is within, with two right reverend fathers,\nDivinely bent to meditation;\nAnd no worldly suit would he be moved,\nTo draw him from his holy exercise.\n\nBUCKINGHAM:\nReturn, good Catesby, to thy lord again;\nTell him, myself, the mayor and citizens,\nIn deep designs and matters of great moment,\nNo less importing than our general good,\nAre come to have some conference with his grace.\n\nCATESBY:\nI'll tell him what you say, my lord.\n\nBUCKINGHAM:\nAh, ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!\nHe is not lolling on a lewd day-bed,\nBut on his knees at meditation;\nNot dallying with a brace of courtezans,\nBut meditating with two deep divines;\nNot sleeping, to engross his idle body,\nBut praying, to enrich his watchful soul:\nHappy were England, would this gracious prince\nTake on himself the sovereignty thereof:\nBut, sure, I fear, we shall ne'er win him to it.\n\nLord Mayor:\nMarry, God forbid his grace should say us nay!\n\nBUCKINGHAM:\nI fear he will.\nHow now, Catesby, what says your lord?\n\nCATESBY:\nMy lord,\nHe wonders to what end you have assembled\nSuch troops of citizens to speak with him,\nHis grace not being warn'd thereof before:\nMy lord, he fears you mean no good to him.\n\nBUCKINGHAM:\nSorry I am my noble cousin should\nSuspect me, that I mean no good to him:\nBy heaven, I come in perfect love to him;\nAnd so once more return and tell his grace.\nWhen holy and devout religious men\nAre at their beads, 'tis hard to draw them thence,\nSo sweet is zealous contemplation.\n\nLord Mayor:\nSee, where he stands between two clergymen!\n\nBUCKINGHAM:\nTwo props of virtue for a Christian prince,\nTo stay him from the fall of vanity:\nAnd, see, a book of prayer in his hand,\nTrue ornaments to know a holy man.\nFamous Plantagenet, most gracious prince,\nLend favourable ears to our request;\nAnd pardon us the interruption\nOf thy devotion and right Christian zeal.\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nMy lord, there needs no such apology:\nI rather do beseech you pardon me,\nWho, earnest in the service of my God,\nNeglect the visitation of my friends.\nBut, leaving this, what is your grace's pleasure?\n\nBUCKINGHAM:\nEven that, I hope, which pleaseth God above,\nAnd all good men of this ungovern'd isle.\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nI do suspect I have done some offence\nThat seems disgracious in the city's eyes,\nAnd that you come to reprehend my ignorance.\n\nBUCKINGHAM:\nYou have, my lord: would it might please your grace,\nAt our entreaties, to amend that fault!\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nElse wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?\n\nBUCKINGHAM:\nThen know, it is your fault that you resign\nThe supreme seat, the throne majestical,\nThe scepter'd office of your ancestors,\nYour state of fortune and your due of birth,\nThe lineal glory of your royal house,\nTo the corruption of a blemished stock:\nWhilst, in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,\nWhich here we waken to our country's good,\nThis noble isle doth want her proper limbs;\nHer face defaced with scars of infamy,\nHer royal stock graft with ignoble plants,\nAnd almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf\nOf blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion.\nWhich to recure, we heartily solicit\nYour gracious self to take on you the charge\nAnd kingly government of this your land,\nNot as protector, steward, substitute,\nOr lowly factor for another's gain;\nBut as successively from blood to blood,\nYour right of birth, your empery, your own.\nFor this, consorted with the citizens,\nYour very worshipful and loving friends,\nAnd by their vehement instigation,\nIn this just suit come I to move your grace.\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nI know not whether to depart in silence,\nOr bitterly to speak in your reproof.\nBest fitteth my degree or your condition\nIf not to answer, you might haply think\nTongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded\nTo bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,\nWhich fondly you would here impose on me;\nIf to reprove you for this suit of yours,\nSo season'd with your faithful love to me.\nThen, on the other side, I cheque'd my friends.\nTherefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,\nAnd then, in speaking, not to incur the last,\nDefinitively thus I answer you.\nYour love deserves my thanks; but my desert\nUnmeritable shuns your high request.\nFirst if all obstacles were cut away,\nAnd that my path were even to the crown,\nAs my ripe revenue and due by birth\nYet so much is my poverty of spirit,\nSo mighty and so many my defects,\nAs I had rather hide me from my greatness,\nBeing a bark to brook no mighty sea,\nThan in my greatness covet to be hid,\nAnd in the vapour of my glory smother'd.\nBut, God be thank'd, there's no need of me,\nAnd much I need to help you, if need were;\nThe royal tree hath left us royal fruit,\nWhich, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time,\nWill well become the seat of majesty,\nAnd make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.\nOn him I lay what you would lay on me,\nThe right and fortune of his happy stars;\nWhich God defend that I should wring from him!\n\nBUCKINGHAM:\nMy lord, this argues conscience in your grace;\nBut the respects thereof are nice and trivial,\nAll circumstances well considered.\nYou say that Edward is your brother's son:\nSo say we too, but not by Edward's wife;\nFor first he was contract to Lady Lucy--\nYour mother lives a witness to that vow--\nAnd afterward by substitute betroth'd\nTo Bona, sister to the King of France.\nThese both put by a poor petitioner,\nA care-crazed mother of a many children,\nA beauty-waning and distressed widow,\nEven in the afternoon of her best days,\nMade prize and purchase of his lustful eye,\nSeduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts\nTo base declension and loathed bigamy\nBy her, in his unlawful bed, he got\nThis Edward, whom our manners term the prince.\nMore bitterly could I expostulate,\nSave that, for reverence to some alive,\nI give a sparing limit to my tongue.\nThen, good my lord, take to your royal self\nThis proffer'd benefit of dignity;\nIf non to bless us and the land withal,\nYet to draw forth your noble ancestry\nFrom the corruption of abusing times,\nUnto a lineal true-derived course.\n\nLord Mayor:\nDo, good my lord, your citizens entreat you.\n\nBUCKINGHAM:\nRefuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love.\n\nCATESBY:\nO, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit!\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nAlas, why would you heap these cares on me?\nI am unfit for state and majesty;\nI do beseech you, take it not amiss;\nI cannot nor I will not yield to you.\n\nBUCKINGHAM:\nIf you refuse it,--as, in love and zeal,\nLoath to depose the child, Your brother's son;\nAs well we know your tenderness of heart\nAnd gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,\nWhich we have noted in you to your kin,\nAnd egally indeed to all estates,--\nYet whether you accept our suit or no,\nYour brother's son shall never reign our king;\nBut we will plant some other in the throne,\nTo the disgrace and downfall of your house:\nAnd in this resolution here we leave you.--\nCome, citizens: 'zounds! I'll entreat no more.\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nO, do not swear, my lord of Buckingham.\n\nCATESBY:\nCall them again, my lord, and accept their suit.\n\nANOTHER:\nDo, good my lord, lest all the land do rue it.\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nWould you enforce me to a world of care?\nWell, call them again. I am not made of stone,\nBut penetrable to your. kind entreats,\nAlbeit against my conscience and my soul.\nCousin of Buckingham, and you sage, grave men,\nSince you will buckle fortune on my back,\nTo bear her burthen, whether I will or no,\nI must have patience to endure the load:\nBut if black scandal or foul-faced reproach\nAttend the sequel of your imposition,\nYour mere enforcement shall acquittance me\nFrom all the impure blots and stains thereof;\nFor God he knows, and you may partly see,\nHow far I am from the desire thereof.\n\nLord Mayor:\nGod bless your grace! we see it, and will say it.\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nIn saying so, you shall but say the truth.\n\nBUCKINGHAM:\nThen I salute you with this kingly title:\nLong live Richard, England's royal king!\n\nLord Mayor:\nAmen.\n\nBUCKINGHAM:\nTo-morrow will it please you to be crown'd?\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nEven when you please, since you will have it so.\n\nBUCKINGHAM:\nTo-morrow, then, we will attend your grace:\nAnd so most joyfully we take our leave.\n\nGLOUCESTER:\nCome, let us to our holy task again.\nFarewell, good cousin; farewell, gentle friends.\n\nDUCHESS OF YORK:\nWho meets us here?  my niece Plantagenet\nLed in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester?\nNow, for my life, she's wandering to the Tower,\nOn pure heart's love to greet the tender princes.\nDaughter, well met.\n\nLADY ANNE:\nGod give your graces both\nA happy and a joyful time of day!\n\nQUEEN ELIZABETH:\nAs much to you, good sister! Whither away?\n\nLADY ANNE:\nNo farther than the Tower; and, as I guess,\nUpon the like devotion as yourselves,\nTo gratulate the gentle princes there.\n\nQUEEN ELIZABETH:\nKind sister, thanks: we'll enter all together.\nAnd, in good time, here the lieutenant comes.\nMaster lieutenant, pray you, by your leave,\nHow doth the prince, and my young son of York?\n\nBRAKENBURY:\nRight well, dear madam. By your patience,\nI may not suffer you to visit them;\nThe king hath straitly charged the contrary.\n\nQUEEN ELIZABETH:\nThe king! why, who's that?\n\nBRAKENBURY:\nI cry you mercy: I mean the lord protector.\n\nQUEEN ELIZABETH:\nThe Lord protect him from that kingly title!\nHath he set bounds betwixt their love and me?\nI am their mother; who should keep me from them?\n\nDUCHESS OF YORK:\nI am their fathers mother; I will see them.\n\nLADY ANNE:\nTheir aunt I am in law, in love their mother:\nThen bring me to their sights; I'll bear thy blame\nAnd take thy office from thee, on my peril.\n\nBRAKENBURY:\nNo, madam, no; I may not leave it so:\nI am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me.\n\nLORD STANLEY:\nLet me but meet you, ladies, one hour hence,\nAnd I'll salute your grace of York as mother,\nAnd reverend looker on, of two fair queens.\nCome, madam, you must straight to Westminster,\nThere to be crowned Richard's royal queen.\n\nQUEEN ELIZABETH:\nO, cut my lace in sunder, that my pent heart\nMay have some scope to beat, or else I swoon\nWith this dead-killing news!\n\nLADY ANNE:\nDespiteful tidings! O unpleasing news!\n\nDORSET:\nBe of good cheer: mother, how fares your grace?\n\nQUEEN ELIZABETH:\nO Dorset, speak not to me, get thee hence!\nDeath and destruction dog thee at the heels;\nThy mother's name is ominous to children.\nIf thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas,\nAnd live with Richmond, from the reach of hell\nGo, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughter-house,\nLest thou increase the number of the dead;\nAnd make me die the thrall of Margaret's curse,\nNor mother, wife, nor England's counted queen.\n\nLORD STANLEY:\nFull of wise care is this your counsel, madam.\nTake all the swift advantage of the hours;\nYou shall have letters from me to my son\nTo meet you on the way, and welcome you.\nBe not ta'en tardy by unwise delay.\n\nDUCHESS OF YORK:\nO ill-dispersing wind of misery!\nO my accursed womb, the bed of death!\nA cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world,\nWhose unavoided eye is murderous.\n\nLORD STANLEY:\nCome, madam, come; I in all haste was sent.\n\nLADY ANNE:\nAnd I in all unwillingness will go.\nI would to God that the inclusive verge\nOf golden metal that must round my brow\nWere red-hot steel, to sear me to the brain!\nAnointed let me be with deadly venom,\nAnd die, ere men can say, God save the queen!\n\nQUEEN ELIZABETH:\nGo, go, poor soul, I envy not thy glory\nTo feed my humour, wish thyself no harm.\n\nLADY ANNE:\nNo! why?  When he that is my husband now\nCame to me, as I follow'd Henry's corse,\nWhen scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands\nWhich issued from my other angel husband\nAnd that dead saint which then I weeping follow'd;\nO, when, I say, I look'd on Richard's face,\nThis was my wish: 'Be thou,' quoth I, ' accursed,\nFor making me, so young, so old a widow!\nAnd, when thou wed'st, let sorrow haunt thy bed;\nAnd be thy wife--if any be so mad--\nAs miserable by the life of thee\nAs thou hast made me by my dear lord's death!\nLo, ere I can repeat this curse again,\nEven in so short a space, my woman's heart\nGrossly grew captive to his honey words\nAnd proved the subject of my own soul's curse,\nWhich ever since hath kept my eyes from rest;\nFor never yet one hour in his bed\nHave I enjoy'd the golden dew of sleep,\nBut have been waked by his timorous dreams.\nBesides, he hates me for my father Warwick;\nAnd will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.\n\nQUEEN ELIZABETH:\nPoor heart, adieu!

and by that sword I swear\nWhich gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder,\nI'll answer thee in any fair degree,\nOr chivalrous design of knightly trial:\nAnd when I mount, alive may I not light,\nIf I be traitor or unjustly fight!\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nWhat doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's charge?\nIt must be great that can inherit us\nSo much as of a thought of ill in him.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nLook, what I speak, my life shall prove it true;\nThat Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles\nIn name of lendings for your highness' soldiers,\nThe which he hath detain'd for lewd employments,\nLike a false traitor and injurious villain.\nBesides I say and will in battle prove,\nOr here or elsewhere to the furthest verge\nThat ever was survey'd by English eye,\nThat all the treasons for these eighteen years\nComplotted and contrived in this land\nFetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.\nFurther I say and further will maintain\nUpon his bad life to make all this good,\nThat he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death,\nSuggest his soon-believing adversaries,\nAnd consequently, like a traitor coward,\nSluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood:\nWhich blood, like sacrificing Abel's, cries,\nEven from the tongueless caverns of the earth,\nTo me for justice and rough chastisement;\nAnd, by the glorious worth of my descent,\nThis arm shall do it, or this life be spent.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nHow high a pitch his resolution soars!\nThomas of Norfolk, what say'st thou to this?\n\nTHOMAS MOWBRAY:\nO, let my sovereign turn away his face\nAnd bid his ears a little while be deaf,\nTill I have told this slander of his blood,\nHow God and good men hate so foul a liar.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nMowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears:\nWere he my brother, nay, my kingdom's heir,\nAs he is but my father's brother's son,\nNow, by my sceptre's awe, I make a vow,\nSuch neighbour nearness to our sacred blood\nShould nothing privilege him, nor partialize\nThe unstooping firmness of my upright soul:\nHe is our subject, Mowbray; so art thou:\nFree speech and fearless I to thee allow.\n\nTHOMAS MOWBRAY:\nThen, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,\nThrough the false passage of thy throat, thou liest.\nThree parts of that receipt I had for Calais\nDisbursed I duly to his highness' soldiers;\nThe other part reserved I by consent,\nFor that my sovereign liege was in my debt\nUpon remainder of a dear account,\nSince last I went to France to fetch his queen:\nNow swallow down that lie. For Gloucester's death,\nI slew him not; but to my own disgrace\nNeglected my sworn duty in that case.\nFor you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,\nThe honourable father to my foe\nOnce did I lay an ambush for your life,\nA trespass that doth vex my grieved soul\nBut ere I last received the sacrament\nI did confess it, and exactly begg'd\nYour grace's pardon, and I hope I had it.\nThis is my fault: as for the rest appeall'd,\nIt issues from the rancour of a villain,\nA recreant and most degenerate traitor\nWhich in myself I boldly will defend;\nAnd interchangeably hurl down my gage\nUpon this overweening traitor's foot,\nTo prove myself a loyal gentleman\nEven in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom.\nIn haste whereof, most heartily I pray\nYour highness to assign our trial day.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nWrath-kindled gentlemen, be ruled by me;\nLet's purge this choler without letting blood:\nThis we prescribe, though no physician;\nDeep malice makes too deep incision;\nForget, forgive; conclude and be agreed;\nOur doctors say this is no month to bleed.\nGood uncle, let this end where it begun;\nWe'll calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son.\n\nJOHN OF GAUNT:\nTo be a make-peace shall become my age:\nThrow down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk's gage.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nAnd, Norfolk, throw down his.\n\nJOHN OF GAUNT:\nWhen, Harry, when?\nObedience bids I should not bid again.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nNorfolk, throw down, we bid; there is no boot.\n\nTHOMAS MOWBRAY:\nMyself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot.\nMy life thou shalt command, but not my shame:\nThe one my duty owes; but my fair name,\nDespite of death that lives upon my grave,\nTo dark dishonour's use thou shalt not have.\nI am disgraced, impeach'd and baffled here,\nPierced to the soul with slander's venom'd spear,\nThe which no balm can cure but his heart-blood\nWhich breathed this poison.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nRage must be withstood:\nGive me his gage: lions make leopards tame.\n\nTHOMAS MOWBRAY:\nYea, but not change his spots: take but my shame.\nAnd I resign my gage. My dear dear lord,\nThe purest treasure mortal times afford\nIs spotless reputation: that away,\nMen are but gilded loam or painted clay.\nA jewel in a ten-times-barr'd-up chest\nIs a bold spirit in a loyal breast.\nMine honour is my life; both grow in one:\nTake honour from me, and my life is done:\nThen, dear my liege, mine honour let me try;\nIn that I live and for that will I die.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nCousin, throw up your gage; do you begin.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nO, God defend my soul from such deep sin!\nShall I seem crest-fall'n in my father's sight?\nOr with pale beggar-fear impeach my height\nBefore this out-dared dastard? Ere my tongue\nShall wound my honour with such feeble wrong,\nOr sound so base a parle, my teeth shall tear\nThe slavish motive of recanting fear,\nAnd spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,\nWhere shame doth harbour, even in Mowbray's face.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nWe were not born to sue, but to command;\nWhich since we cannot do to make you friends,\nBe ready, as your lives shall answer it,\nAt Coventry, upon Saint Lambert's day:\nThere shall your swords and lances arbitrate\nThe swelling difference of your settled hate:\nSince we can not atone you, we shall see\nJustice design the victor's chivalry.\nLord marshal, command our officers at arms\nBe ready to direct these home alarms.\n\nJOHN OF GAUNT:\nAlas, the part I had in Woodstock's blood\nDoth more solicit me than your exclaims,\nTo stir against the butchers of his life!\nBut since correction lieth in those hands\nWhich made the fault that we cannot correct,\nPut we our quarrel to the will of heaven;\nWho, when they see the hours ripe on earth,\nWill rain hot vengeance on offenders' heads.\n\nDUCHESS:\nFinds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?\nHath love in thy old blood no living fire?\nEdward's seven sons, whereof thyself art one,\nWere as seven vials of his sacred blood,\nOr seven fair branches springing from one root:\nSome of those seven are dried by nature's course,\nSome of those branches by the Destinies cut;\nBut Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloucester,\nOne vial full of Edward's sacred blood,\nOne flourishing branch of his most royal root,\nIs crack'd, and all the precious liquor spilt,\nIs hack'd down, and his summer leaves all faded,\nBy envy's hand and murder's bloody axe.\nAh, Gaunt, his blood was thine! that bed, that womb,\nThat metal, that self-mould, that fashion'd thee\nMade him a man; and though thou livest and breathest,\nYet art thou slain in him: thou dost consent\nIn some large measure to thy father's death,\nIn that thou seest thy wretched brother die,\nWho was the model of thy father's life.\nCall it not patience, Gaunt; it is despair:\nIn suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter'd,\nThou showest the naked pathway to thy life,\nTeaching stern murder how to butcher thee:\nThat which in mean men we intitle patience\nIs pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.\nWhat shall I say? to safeguard thine own life,\nThe best way is to venge my Gloucester's death.\n\nJOHN OF GAUNT:\nGod's is the quarrel; for God's substitute,\nHis deputy anointed in His sight,\nHath caused his death: the which if wrongfully,\nLet heaven revenge; for I may never lift\nAn angry arm against His minister.\n\nDUCHESS:\nWhere then, alas, may I complain myself?\n\nJOHN OF GAUNT:\nTo God, the widow's champion and defence.\n\nDUCHESS:\nWhy, then, I will. Farewell, old Gaunt.\nThou goest to Coventry, there to behold\nOur cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight:\nO, sit my husband's wrongs on Hereford's spear,\nThat it may enter butcher Mowbray's breast!\nOr, if misfortune miss the first career,\nBe Mowbray's sins so heavy in his bosom,\nThey may break his foaming courser's back,\nAnd throw the rider headlong in the lists,\nA caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford!\nFarewell, old Gaunt: thy sometimes brother's wife\nWith her companion grief must end her life.\n\nJOHN OF GAUNT:\nSister, farewell; I must to Coventry:\nAs much good stay with thee as go with me!\n\nDUCHESS:\nYet one word more: grief boundeth where it falls,\nNot with the empty hollowness, but weight:\nI take my leave before I have begun,\nFor sorrow ends not when it seemeth done.\nCommend me to thy brother, Edmund York.\nLo, this is all:--nay, yet depart not so;\nThough this be all, do not so quickly go;\nI shall remember more. Bid him--ah, what?--\nWith all good speed at Plashy visit me.\nAlack, and what shall good old York there see\nBut empty lodgings and unfurnish'd walls,\nUnpeopled offices, untrodden stones?\nAnd what hear there for welcome but my groans?\nTherefore commend me; let him not come there,\nTo seek out sorrow that dwells every where.\nDesolate, desolate, will I hence and die:\nThe last leave of thee takes my weeping eye.\n\nLord Marshal:\nMy Lord Aumerle, is Harry Hereford arm'd?\n\nDUKE OF AUMERLE:\nYea, at all points; and longs to enter in.\n\nLord Marshal:\nThe Duke of Norfolk, sprightfully and bold,\nStays but the summons of the appellant's trumpet.\n\nDUKE OF AUMERLE:\nWhy, then, the champions are prepared, and stay\nFor nothing but his majesty's approach.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nMarshal, demand of yonder champion\nThe cause of his arrival here in arms:\nAsk him his name and orderly proceed\nTo swear him in the justice of his cause.\n\nLord Marshal:\nIn God's name and the king's, say who thou art\nAnd why thou comest thus knightly clad in arms,\nAgainst what man thou comest, and what thy quarrel:\nSpeak truly, on thy knighthood and thy oath;\nAs so defend thee heaven and thy valour!\n\nTHOMAS MOWBRAY:\nMy name is Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk;\nWho hither come engaged by my oath--\nWhich God defend a knight should violate!--\nBoth to defend my loyalty and truth\nTo God, my king and my succeeding issue,\nAgainst the Duke of Hereford that appeals me\nAnd, by the grace of God and this mine arm,\nTo prove him, in defending of myself,\nA traitor to my God, my king, and me:\nAnd as I truly fight, defend me heaven!\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nMarshal, ask yonder knight in arms,\nBoth who he is and why he cometh hither\nThus plated in habiliments of war,\nAnd formally, according to our law,\nDepose him in the justice of his cause.\n\nLord Marshal:\nWhat is thy name? and wherefore comest thou hither,\nBefore King Richard in his royal lists?\nAgainst whom comest thou? and what's thy quarrel?\nSpeak like a true knight, so defend thee heaven!\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nHarry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby\nAm I; who ready here do stand in arms,\nTo prove, by God's grace and my body's valour,\nIn lists, on Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,\nThat he is a traitor, foul and dangerous,\nTo God of heaven, King Richard and to me;\nAnd as I truly fight, defend me heaven!\n\nLord Marshal:\nOn pain of death, no person be so bold\nOr daring-hardy as to touch the lists,\nExcept the marshal and such officers\nAppointed to direct these fair designs.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nLord marshal, let me kiss my sovereign's hand,\nAnd bow my knee before his majesty:\nFor Mowbray and myself are like two men\nThat vow a long and weary pilgrimage;\nThen let us take a ceremonious leave\nAnd loving farewell of our several friends.\n\nLord Marshal:\nThe appellant in all duty greets your highness,\nAnd craves to kiss your hand and take his leave.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nWe will descend and fold him in our arms.\nCousin of Hereford, as thy cause is right,\nSo be thy fortune in this royal fight!\nFarewell, my blood; which if to-day thou shed,\nLament we may, but not revenge thee dead.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nO let no noble eye profane a tear\nFor me, if I be gored with Mowbray's spear:\nAs confident as is the falcon's flight\nAgainst a bird, do I with Mowbray fight.\nMy loving lord, I take my leave of you;\nOf you, my noble cousin, Lord Aumerle;\nNot sick, although I have to do with death,\nBut lusty, young, and cheerly drawing breath.\nLo, as at English feasts, so I regreet\nThe daintiest last, to make the end most sweet:\nO thou, the earthly author of my blood,\nWhose youthful spirit, in me regenerate,\nDoth with a twofold vigour lift me up\nTo reach at victory above my head,\nAdd proof unto mine armour with thy prayers;\nAnd with thy blessings steel my lance's point,\nThat it may enter Mowbray's waxen coat,\nAnd furbish new the name of John a Gaunt,\nEven in the lusty havior of his son.\n\nJOHN OF GAUNT:\nGod in thy good cause make thee prosperous!\nBe swift like lightning in the execution;\nAnd let thy blows, doubly redoubled,\nFall like amazing thunder on the casque\nOf thy adverse pernicious enemy:\nRouse up thy youthful blood, be valiant and live.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nMine innocency and Saint George to thrive!\n\nTHOMAS MOWBRAY:\nHowever God or fortune cast my lot,\nThere lives or dies, true to King Richard's throne,\nA loyal, just and upright gentleman:\nNever did captive with a freer heart\nCast off his chains of bondage and embrace\nHis golden uncontroll'd enfranchisement,\nMore than my dancing soul doth celebrate\nThis feast of battle with mine adversary.\nMost mighty liege, and my companion peers,\nTake from my mouth the wish of happy years:\nAs gentle and as jocund as to jest\nGo I to fight: truth hath a quiet breast.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nFarewell, my lord: securely I espy\nVirtue with valour couched in thine eye.\nOrder the trial, marshal, and begin.\n\nLord Marshal:\nHarry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby,\nReceive thy lance; and God defend the right!\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nStrong as a tower in hope, I cry amen.\n\nLord Marshal:\nGo bear this lance to Thomas, Duke of Norfolk.\n\nFirst Herald:\nHarry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby,\nStands here for God, his sovereign and himself,\nOn pain to be found false and recreant,\nTo prove the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray,\nA traitor to his God, his king and him;\nAnd dares him to set forward to the fight.\n\nSecond Herald:\nHere standeth Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,\nOn pain to be found false and recreant,\nBoth to defend himself and to approve\nHenry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby,\nTo God, his sovereign and to him disloyal;\nCourageously and with a free desire\nAttending but the signal to begin.\n\nLord Marshal:\nSound, trumpets; and set forward, combatants.\nStay, the king hath thrown his warder down.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nLet them lay by their helmets and their spears,\nAnd both return back to their chairs again:\nWithdraw with us: and let the trumpets sound\nWhile we return these dukes what we decree.\nDraw near,\nAnd list what with our council we have done.\nFor that our kingdom's earth should not be soil'd\nWith that dear blood which it hath fostered;\nAnd for our eyes do hate the dire aspect\nOf civil wounds plough'd up with neighbours' sword;\nAnd for we think the eagle-winged pride\nOf sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughts,\nWith rival-hating envy, set on you\nTo wake our peace, which in our country's cradle\nDraws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep;\nWhich so roused up with boisterous untuned drums,\nWith harsh resounding trumpets' dreadful bray,\nAnd grating shock of wrathful iron arms,\nMight from our quiet confines fright fair peace\nAnd make us wade even in our kindred's blood,\nTherefore, we banish you our territories:\nYou, cousin Hereford, upon pain of life,\nTill twice five summers have enrich'd our fields\nShall not regreet our fair dominions,\nBut tread the stranger paths of banishment.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nYour will be done: this must my comfort be,\nSun that warms you here shall shine on me;\nAnd those his golden beams to you here lent\nShall point on me and gild my banishment.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nNorfolk, for thee remains a heavier doom,\nWhich I with some unwillingness pronounce:\nThe sly slow hours shall not determinate\nThe dateless limit of thy dear exile;\nThe hopeless word of 'never to return'\nBreathe I against thee, upon pain of life.\n\nTHOMAS MOWBRAY:\nA heavy sentence, my most sovereign liege,\nAnd all unlook'd for from your highness' mouth:\nA dearer merit, not so deep a maim\nAs to be cast forth in the common air,\nHave I deserved at your highness' hands.\nThe language I have learn'd these forty years,\nMy native English, now I must forego:\nAnd now my tongue's use is to me no more\nThan an unstringed viol or a harp,\nOr like a cunning instrument cased up,\nOr, being open, put into his hands\nThat knows no touch to tune the harmony:\nWithin my mouth you have engaol'd my tongue,\nDoubly portcullis'd with my teeth and lips;\nAnd dull unfeeling barren ignorance\nIs made my gaoler to attend on me.\nI am too old to fawn upon a nurse,\nToo far in years to be a pupil now:\nWhat is thy sentence then but speechless death,\nWhich robs my tongue from breathing native breath?\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nIt boots thee not to be compassionate:\nAfter our sentence plaining comes too late.\n\nTHOMAS MOWBRAY:\nThen thus I turn me from my country's light,\nTo dwell in solemn shades of endless night.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nReturn again, and take an oath with thee.\nLay on our royal sword your banish'd hands;\nSwear by the duty that you owe to God--\nOur part therein we banish with yourselves--\nTo keep the oath that we administer:\nYou never shall, so help you truth and God!\nEmbrace each other's love in banishment;\nNor never look upon each other's face;\nNor never write, regreet, nor reconcile\nThis louring tempest of your home-bred hate;\nNor never by advised purpose meet\nTo plot, contrive, or complot any ill\n'Gainst us, our state, our subjects, or our land.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nI swear.\n\nTHOMAS MOWBRAY:\nAnd I, to keep all this.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nNorfolk, so far as to mine enemy:--\nBy this time, had the king permitted us,\nOne of our souls had wander'd in the air.\nBanish'd this frail sepulchre of our flesh,\nAs now our flesh is banish'd from this land:\nConfess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm;\nSince thou hast far to go, bear not along\nThe clogging burthen of a guilty soul.\n\nTHOMAS MOWBRAY:\nNo, Bolingbroke: if ever I were traitor,\nMy name be blotted from the book of life,\nAnd I from heaven banish'd as from hence!\nBut what thou art, God, thou, and I do know;\nAnd all too soon, I fear, the king shall rue.\nFarewell, my liege. Now no way can I stray;\nSave back to England, all the world's my way.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nUncle, even in the glasses of thine eyes\nI see thy grieved heart: thy sad aspect\nHath from the number of his banish'd years\nPluck'd four away.\nSix frozen winter spent,\nReturn with welcome home from banishment.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nHow long a time lies in one little word!\nFour lagging winters and four wanton springs\nEnd in a word: such is the breath of kings.\n\nJOHN OF GAUNT:\nI thank my liege, that in regard of me\nHe shortens four years of my son's exile:\nBut little vantage shall I reap thereby;\nFor, ere the six years that he hath to spend\nCan change their moons and bring their times about\nMy oil-dried lamp and time-bewasted light\nShall be extinct with age and endless night;\nMy inch of taper will be burnt and done,\nAnd blindfold death not let me see my son.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nWhy uncle, thou hast many years to live.\n\nJOHN OF GAUNT:\nBut not a minute, king, that thou canst give:\nShorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow,\nAnd pluck nights from me, but not lend a morrow;\nThou canst help time to furrow me with age,\nBut stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage;\nThy word is current with him for my death,\nBut dead, thy kingdom cannot buy my breath.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nThy son is banish'd upon good advice,\nWhereto thy tongue a party-verdict gave:\nWhy at our justice seem'st thou then to lour?\n\nJOHN OF GAUNT:\nThings sweet to taste prove in digestion sour.\nYou urged me as a judge; but I had rather\nYou would have bid me argue like a father.\nO, had it been a stranger, not my child,\nTo smooth his fault I should have been more mild:\nA partial slander sought I to avoid,\nAnd in the sentence my own life destroy'd.\nAlas, I look'd when some of you should say,\nI was too strict to make mine own away;\nBut you gave leave to my unwilling tongue\nAgainst my will to do myself this wrong.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nCousin, farewell; and, uncle, bid him so:\nSix years we banish him, and he shall go.\n\nDUKE OF AUMERLE:\nCousin, farewell: what presence must not know,\nFrom where you do remain let paper show.\n\nLord Marshal:\nMy lord, no leave take I; for I will ride,\nAs far as land will let me, by your side.\n\nJOHN OF GAUNT:\nO, to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words,\nThat thou return'st no greeting to thy friends?\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nI have too few to take my leave of you,\nWhen the tongue's office should be prodigal\nTo breathe the abundant dolour of the heart.\n\nJOHN OF GAUNT:\nThy grief is but thy absence for a time.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nJoy absent, grief is present for that time.\n\nJOHN OF GAUNT:\nWhat is six winters? they are quickly gone.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nTo men in joy; but grief makes one hour ten.\n\nJOHN OF GAUNT:\nCall it a travel that thou takest for pleasure.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nMy heart will sigh when I miscall it so,\nWhich finds it an inforced pilgrimage.\n\nJOHN OF GAUNT:\nThe sullen passage of thy weary steps\nEsteem as foil wherein thou art to set\nThe precious jewel of thy home return.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nNay, rather, every tedious stride I make\nWill but remember me what a deal of world\nI wander from the jewels that I love.\nMust I not serve a long apprenticehood\nTo foreign passages, and in the end,\nHaving my freedom, boast of nothing else\nBut that I was a journeyman to grief?\n\nJOHN OF GAUNT:\nAll places that the eye of heaven visits\nAre to a wise man ports and happy havens.\nTeach thy necessity to reason thus;\nThere is no virtue like necessity.\nThink not the king did banish thee,\nBut thou the king. Woe doth the heavier sit,\nWhere it perceives it is but faintly borne.\nGo, say I sent thee forth to purchase honour\nAnd not the king exiled thee; or suppose\nDevouring pestilence hangs in our air\nAnd thou art flying to a fresher clime:\nLook, what thy soul holds dear, imagine it\nTo lie that way thou go'st, not whence thou comest:\nSuppose the singing birds musicians,\nThe grass whereon thou tread'st the presence strew'd,\nThe flowers fair ladies, and thy steps no more\nThan a delightful measure or a dance;\nFor gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite\nThe man that mocks at it and sets it light.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nO, who can hold a fire in his hand\nBy thinking on the frosty Caucasus?\nOr cloy the hungry edge of appetite\nBy bare imagination of a feast?\nOr wallow naked in December snow\nBy thinking on fantastic summer's heat?\nO, no! the apprehension of the good\nGives but the greater feeling to the worse:\nFell sorrow's tooth doth never rankle more\nThan when he bites, but lanceth not the sore.\n\nJOHN OF GAUNT:\nCome, come, my son, I'll bring thee on thy way:\nHad I thy youth and cause, I would not stay.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nThen, England's ground, farewell; sweet soil, adieu;\nMy mother, and my nurse, that bears me yet!\nWhere'er I wander, boast of this I can,\nThough banish'd, yet a trueborn Englishman.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nWe did observe. Cousin Aumerle,\nHow far brought you high Hereford on his way?\n\nDUKE OF AUMERLE:\nI brought high Hereford, if you call him so,\nBut to the next highway, and there I left him.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nAnd say, what store of parting tears were shed?\n\nDUKE OF AUMERLE:\nFaith, none for me; except the north-east wind,\nWhich then blew bitterly against our faces,\nAwaked the sleeping rheum, and so by chance\nDid grace our hollow parting with a tear.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nWhat said our cousin when you parted with him?\n\nDUKE OF AUMERLE:\n'Farewell:'\nAnd, for my heart disdained that my tongue\nShould so profane the word, that taught me craft\nTo counterfeit oppression of such grief\nThat words seem'd buried in my sorrow's grave.\nMarry, would the word 'farewell' have lengthen'd hours\nAnd added years to his short banishment,\nHe should have had a volume of farewells;\nBut since it would not, he had none of me.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nHe is our cousin, cousin;

My noble uncle!\n\nDUKE OF YORK:\nShow me thy humble heart, and not thy knee,\nWhose duty is deceiveable and false.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nMy gracious uncle--\n\nDUKE OF YORK:\nTut, tut!\nGrace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle:\nI am no traitor's uncle; and that word 'grace.'\nIn an ungracious mouth is but profane.\nWhy have those banish'd and forbidden legs\nDared once to touch a dust of England's ground?\nBut then more 'why?' why have they dared to march\nSo many miles upon her peaceful bosom,\nFrighting her pale-faced villages with war\nAnd ostentation of despised arms?\nComest thou because the anointed king is hence?\nWhy, foolish boy, the king is left behind,\nAnd in my loyal bosom lies his power.\nWere I but now the lord of such hot youth\nAs when brave Gaunt, thy father, and myself\nRescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,\nFrom forth the ranks of many thousand French,\nO, then how quickly should this arm of mine.\nNow prisoner to the palsy, chastise thee\nAnd minister correction to thy fault!\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nMy gracious uncle, let me know my fault:\nOn what condition stands it and wherein?\n\nDUKE OF YORK:\nEven in condition of the worst degree,\nIn gross rebellion and detested treason:\nThou art a banish'd man, and here art come\nBefore the expiration of thy time,\nIn braving arms against thy sovereign.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nAs I was banish'd, I was banish'd Hereford;\nBut as I come, I come for Lancaster.\nAnd, noble uncle, I beseech your grace\nLook on my wrongs with an indifferent eye:\nYou are my father, for methinks in you\nI see old Gaunt alive; O, then, my father,\nWill you permit that I shall stand condemn'd\nA wandering vagabond; my rights and royalties\nPluck'd from my arms perforce and given away\nTo upstart unthrifts? Wherefore was I born?\nIf that my cousin king be King of England,\nIt must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster.\nYou have a son, Aumerle, my noble cousin;\nHad you first died, and he been thus trod down,\nHe should have found his uncle Gaunt a father,\nTo rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay.\nI am denied to sue my livery here,\nAnd yet my letters-patents give me leave:\nMy father's goods are all distrain'd and sold,\nAnd these and all are all amiss employ'd.\nWhat would you have me do? I am a subject,\nAnd I challenge law: attorneys are denied me;\nAnd therefore, personally I lay my claim\nTo my inheritance of free descent.\n\nNORTHUMBERLAND:\nThe noble duke hath been too much abused.\n\nLORD ROSS:\nIt stands your grace upon to do him right.\n\nLORD WILLOUGHBY:\nBase men by his endowments are made great.\n\nDUKE OF YORK:\nMy lords of England, let me tell you this:\nI have had feeling of my cousin's wrongs\nAnd laboured all I could to do him right;\nBut in this kind to come, in braving arms,\nBe his own carver and cut out his way,\nTo find out right with wrong, it may not be;\nAnd you that do abet him in this kind\nCherish rebellion and are rebels all.\n\nNORTHUMBERLAND:\nThe noble duke hath sworn his coming is\nBut for his own; and for the right of that\nWe all have strongly sworn to give him aid;\nAnd let him ne'er see joy that breaks that oath!\n\nDUKE OF YORK:\nWell, well, I see the issue of these arms:\nI cannot mend it, I must needs confess,\nBecause my power is weak and all ill left:\nBut if I could, by Him that gave me life,\nI would attach you all and make you stoop\nUnto the sovereign mercy of the king;\nBut since I cannot, be it known to you\nI do remain as neuter. So, fare you well;\nUnless you please to enter in the castle\nAnd there repose you for this night.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nAn offer, uncle, that we will accept:\nBut we must win your grace to go with us\nTo Bristol castle, which they say is held\nBy Bushy, Bagot and their complices,\nThe caterpillars of the commonwealth,\nWhich I have sworn to weed and pluck away.\n\nDUKE OF YORK:\nIt may be I will go with you: but yet I'll pause;\nFor I am loath to break our country's laws.\nNor friends nor foes, to me welcome you are:\nThings past redress are now with me past care.\n\nCaptain:\nMy lord of Salisbury, we have stay'd ten days,\nAnd hardly kept our countrymen together,\nAnd yet we hear no tidings from the king;\nTherefore we will disperse ourselves: farewell.\n\nEARL OF SALISBURY:\nStay yet another day, thou trusty Welshman:\nThe king reposeth all his confidence in thee.\n\nCaptain:\n'Tis thought the king is dead; we will not stay.\nThe bay-trees in our country are all wither'd\nAnd meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven;\nThe pale-faced moon looks bloody on the earth\nAnd lean-look'd prophets whisper fearful change;\nRich men look sad and ruffians dance and leap,\nThe one in fear to lose what they enjoy,\nThe other to enjoy by rage and war:\nThese signs forerun the death or fall of kings.\nFarewell: our countrymen are gone and fled,\nAs well assured Richard their king is dead.\n\nEARL OF SALISBURY:\nAh, Richard, with the eyes of heavy mind\nI see thy glory like a shooting star\nFall to the base earth from the firmament.\nThy sun sets weeping in the lowly west,\nWitnessing storms to come, woe and unrest:\nThy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes,\nAnd crossly to thy good all fortune goes.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nBring forth these men.\nBushy and Green, I will not vex your souls--\nSince presently your souls must part your bodies--\nWith too much urging your pernicious lives,\nFor 'twere no charity; yet, to wash your blood\nFrom off my hands, here in the view of men\nI will unfold some causes of your deaths.\nYou have misled a prince, a royal king,\nA happy gentleman in blood and lineaments,\nBy you unhappied and disfigured clean:\nYou have in manner with your sinful hours\nMade a divorce betwixt his queen and him,\nBroke the possession of a royal bed\nAnd stain'd the beauty of a fair queen's cheeks\nWith tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs.\nMyself, a prince by fortune of my birth,\nNear to the king in blood, and near in love\nTill you did make him misinterpret me,\nHave stoop'd my neck under your injuries,\nAnd sigh'd my English breath in foreign clouds,\nEating the bitter bread of banishment;\nWhilst you have fed upon my signories,\nDispark'd my parks and fell'd my forest woods,\nFrom my own windows torn my household coat,\nRazed out my imprese, leaving me no sign,\nSave men's opinions and my living blood,\nTo show the world I am a gentleman.\nThis and much more, much more than twice all this,\nCondemns you to the death. See them deliver'd over\nTo execution and the hand of death.\n\nBUSHY:\nMore welcome is the stroke of death to me\nThan Bolingbroke to England. Lords, farewell.\n\nGREEN:\nMy comfort is that heaven will take our souls\nAnd plague injustice with the pains of hell.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nMy Lord Northumberland, see them dispatch'd.\nUncle, you say the queen is at your house;\nFor God's sake, fairly let her be entreated:\nTell her I send to her my kind commends;\nTake special care my greetings be deliver'd.\n\nDUKE OF YORK:\nA gentleman of mine I have dispatch'd\nWith letters of your love to her at large.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nThank, gentle uncle. Come, lords, away.\nTo fight with Glendower and his complices:\nAwhile to work, and after holiday.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nBarkloughly castle call they this at hand?\n\nDUKE OF AUMERLE:\nYea, my lord. How brooks your grace the air,\nAfter your late tossing on the breaking seas?\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nNeeds must I like it well: I weep for joy\nTo stand upon my kingdom once again.\nDear earth, I do salute thee with my hand,\nThough rebels wound thee with their horses' hoofs:\nAs a long-parted mother with her child\nPlays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting,\nSo, weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth,\nAnd do thee favours with my royal hands.\nFeed not thy sovereign's foe, my gentle earth,\nNor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense;\nBut let thy spiders, that suck up thy venom,\nAnd heavy-gaited toads lie in their way,\nDoing annoyance to the treacherous feet\nWhich with usurping steps do trample thee:\nYield stinging nettles to mine enemies;\nAnd when they from thy bosom pluck a flower,\nGuard it, I pray thee, with a lurking adder\nWhose double tongue may with a mortal touch\nThrow death upon thy sovereign's enemies.\nMock not my senseless conjuration, lords:\nThis earth shall have a feeling and these stones\nProve armed soldiers, ere her native king\nShall falter under foul rebellion's arms.\n\nBISHOP OF CARLISLE:\nFear not, my lord: that Power that made you king\nHath power to keep you king in spite of all.\nThe means that heaven yields must be embraced,\nAnd not neglected; else, if heaven would,\nAnd we will not, heaven's offer we refuse,\nThe proffer'd means of succor and redress.\n\nDUKE OF AUMERLE:\nHe means, my lord, that we are too remiss;\nWhilst Bolingbroke, through our security,\nGrows strong and great in substance and in power.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nDiscomfortable cousin! know'st thou not\nThat when the searching eye of heaven is hid,\nBehind the globe, that lights the lower world,\nThen thieves and robbers range abroad unseen\nIn murders and in outrage, boldly here;\nBut when from under this terrestrial ball\nHe fires the proud tops of the eastern pines\nAnd darts his light through every guilty hole,\nThen murders, treasons and detested sins,\nThe cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs,\nStand bare and naked, trembling at themselves?\nSo when this thief, this traitor, Bolingbroke,\nWho all this while hath revell'd in the night\nWhilst we were wandering with the antipodes,\nShall see us rising in our throne, the east,\nHis treasons will sit blushing in his face,\nNot able to endure the sight of day,\nBut self-affrighted tremble at his sin.\nNot all the water in the rough rude sea\nCan wash the balm off from an anointed king;\nThe breath of worldly men cannot depose\nThe deputy elected by the Lord:\nFor every man that Bolingbroke hath press'd\nTo lift shrewd steel against our golden crown,\nGod for his Richard hath in heavenly pay\nA glorious angel: then, if angels fight,\nWeak men must fall, for heaven still guards the right.\nWelcome, my lord how far off lies your power?\n\nEARL OF SALISBURY:\nNor near nor farther off, my gracious lord,\nThan this weak arm: discomfort guides my tongue\nAnd bids me speak of nothing but despair.\nOne day too late, I fear me, noble lord,\nHath clouded all thy happy days on earth:\nO, call back yesterday, bid time return,\nAnd thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men!\nTo-day, to-day, unhappy day, too late,\nO'erthrows thy joys, friends, fortune and thy state:\nFor all the Welshmen, hearing thou wert dead.\nAre gone to Bolingbroke, dispersed and fled.\n\nDUKE OF AUMERLE:\nComfort, my liege; why looks your grace so pale?\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nBut now the blood of twenty thousand men\nDid triumph in my face, and they are fled;\nAnd, till so much blood thither come again,\nHave I not reason to look pale and dead?\nAll souls that will be safe fly from my side,\nFor time hath set a blot upon my pride.\n\nDUKE OF AUMERLE:\nComfort, my liege; remember who you are.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nI had forgot myself; am I not king?\nAwake, thou coward majesty! thou sleepest.\nIs not the king's name twenty thousand names?\nArm, arm, my name! a puny subject strikes\nAt thy great glory. Look not to the ground,\nYe favourites of a king: are we not high?\nHigh be our thoughts: I know my uncle York\nHath power enough to serve our turn. But who comes here?\n\nSIR STEPHEN SCROOP:\nMore health and happiness betide my liege\nThan can my care-tuned tongue deliver him!\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nMine ear is open and my heart prepared;\nThe worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold.\nSay, is my kingdom lost? why, 'twas my care\nAnd what loss is it to be rid of care?\nStrives Bolingbroke to be as great as we?\nGreater he shall not be; if he serve God,\nWe'll serve Him too and be his fellow so:\nRevolt our subjects? that we cannot mend;\nThey break their faith to God as well as us:\nCry woe, destruction, ruin and decay:\nThe worst is death, and death will have his day.\n\nSIR STEPHEN SCROOP:\nGlad am I that your highness is so arm'd\nTo bear the tidings of calamity.\nLike an unseasonable stormy day,\nWhich makes the silver rivers drown their shores,\nAs if the world were all dissolved to tears,\nSo high above his limits swells the rage\nOf Bolingbroke, covering your fearful land\nWith hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel.\nWhite-beards have arm'd their thin and hairless scalps\nAgainst thy majesty; boys, with women's voices,\nStrive to speak big and clap their female joints\nIn stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown:\nThe very beadsmen learn to bend their bows\nOf double-fatal yew against thy state;\nYea, distaff-women manage rusty bills\nAgainst thy seat: both young and old rebel,\nAnd all goes worse than I have power to tell.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nToo well, too well thou tell'st a tale so ill.\nWhere is the Earl of Wiltshire? where is Bagot?\nWhat is become of Bushy? where is Green?\nThat they have let the dangerous enemy\nMeasure our confines with such peaceful steps?\nIf we prevail, their heads shall pay for it:\nI warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke.\n\nSIR STEPHEN SCROOP:\nPeace have they made with him indeed, my lord.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nO villains, vipers, damn'd without redemption!\nDogs, easily won to fawn on any man!\nSnakes, in my heart-blood warm'd, that sting my heart!\nThree Judases, each one thrice worse than Judas!\nWould they make peace? terrible hell make war\nUpon their spotted souls for this offence!\n\nSIR STEPHEN SCROOP:\nSweet love, I see, changing his property,\nTurns to the sourest and most deadly hate:\nAgain uncurse their souls; their peace is made\nWith heads, and not with hands; those whom you curse\nHave felt the worst of death's destroying wound\nAnd lie full low, graved in the hollow ground.\n\nDUKE OF AUMERLE:\nIs Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead?\n\nSIR STEPHEN SCROOP:\nAy, all of them at Bristol lost their heads.\n\nDUKE OF AUMERLE:\nWhere is the duke my father with his power?\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nNo matter where; of comfort no man speak:\nLet's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs;\nMake dust our paper and with rainy eyes\nWrite sorrow on the bosom of the earth,\nLet's choose executors and talk of wills:\nAnd yet not so, for what can we bequeath\nSave our deposed bodies to the ground?\nOur lands, our lives and all are Bolingbroke's,\nAnd nothing can we call our own but death\nAnd that small model of the barren earth\nWhich serves as paste and cover to our bones.\nFor God's sake, let us sit upon the ground\nAnd tell sad stories of the death of kings;\nHow some have been deposed; some slain in war,\nSome haunted by the ghosts they have deposed;\nSome poison'd by their wives: some sleeping kill'd;\nAll murder'd: for within the hollow crown\nThat rounds the mortal temples of a king\nKeeps Death his court and there the antic sits,\nScoffing his state and grinning at his pomp,\nAllowing him a breath, a little scene,\nTo monarchize, be fear'd and kill with looks,\nInfusing him with self and vain conceit,\nAs if this flesh which walls about our life,\nWere brass impregnable, and humour'd thus\nComes at the last and with a little pin\nBores through his castle wall, and farewell king!\nCover your heads and mock not flesh and blood\nWith solemn reverence: throw away respect,\nTradition, form and ceremonious duty,\nFor you have but mistook me all this while:\nI live with bread like you, feel want,\nTaste grief, need friends: subjected thus,\nHow can you say to me, I am a king?\n\nBISHOP OF CARLISLE:\nMy lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes,\nBut presently prevent the ways to wail.\nTo fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength,\nGives in your weakness strength unto your foe,\nAnd so your follies fight against yourself.\nFear and be slain; no worse can come to fight:\nAnd fight and die is death destroying death;\nWhere fearing dying pays death servile breath.\n\nDUKE OF AUMERLE:\nMy father hath a power; inquire of him\nAnd learn to make a body of a limb.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nThou chidest me well: proud Bolingbroke, I come\nTo change blows with thee for our day of doom.\nThis ague fit of fear is over-blown;\nAn easy task it is to win our own.\nSay, Scroop, where lies our uncle with his power?\nSpeak sweetly, man, although thy looks be sour.\n\nSIR STEPHEN SCROOP:\nMen judge by the complexion of the sky\nThe state and inclination of the day:\nSo may you by my dull and heavy eye,\nMy tongue hath but a heavier tale to say.\nI play the torturer, by small and small\nTo lengthen out the worst that must be spoken:\nYour uncle York is join'd with Bolingbroke,\nAnd all your northern castles yielded up,\nAnd all your southern gentlemen in arms\nUpon his party.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nThou hast said enough.\nBeshrew thee, cousin, which didst lead me forth\nOf that sweet way I was in to despair!\nWhat say you now? what comfort have we now?\nBy heaven, I'll hate him everlastingly\nThat bids me be of comfort any more.\nGo to Flint castle: there I'll pine away;\nA king, woe's slave, shall kingly woe obey.\nThat power I have, discharge; and let them go\nTo ear the land that hath some hope to grow,\nFor I have none: let no man speak again\nTo alter this, for counsel is but vain.\n\nDUKE OF AUMERLE:\nMy liege, one word.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nHe does me double wrong\nThat wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue.\nDischarge my followers: let them hence away,\nFrom Richard's night to Bolingbroke's fair day.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nSo that by this intelligence we learn\nThe Welshmen are dispersed, and Salisbury\nIs gone to meet the king, who lately landed\nWith some few private friends upon this coast.\n\nNORTHUMBERLAND:\nThe news is very fair and good, my lord:\nRichard not far from hence hath hid his head.\n\nDUKE OF YORK:\nIt would beseem the Lord Northumberland\nTo say 'King Richard:' alack the heavy day\nWhen such a sacred king should hide his head.\n\nNORTHUMBERLAND:\nYour grace mistakes; only to be brief\nLeft I his title out.\n\nDUKE OF YORK:\nThe time hath been,\nWould you have been so brief with him, he would\nHave been so brief with you, to shorten you,\nFor taking so the head, your whole head's length.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nMistake not, uncle, further than you should.\n\nDUKE OF YORK:\nTake not, good cousin, further than you should.\nLest you mistake the heavens are o'er our heads.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nI know it, uncle, and oppose not myself\nAgainst their will. But who comes here?\nWelcome, Harry: what, will not this castle yield?\n\nHENRY PERCY:\nThe castle royally is mann'd, my lord,\nAgainst thy entrance.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nRoyally!\nWhy, it contains no king?\n\nHENRY PERCY:\nYes, my good lord,\nIt doth contain a king; King Richard lies\nWithin the limits of yon lime and stone:\nAnd with him are the Lord Aumerle, Lord Salisbury,\nSir Stephen Scroop, besides a clergyman\nOf holy reverence; who, I cannot learn.\n\nNORTHUMBERLAND:\nO, belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nNoble lords,\nGo to the rude ribs of that ancient castle;\nThrough brazen trumpet send the breath of parley\nInto his ruin'd ears, and thus deliver:\nHenry Bolingbroke\nOn both his knees doth kiss King Richard's hand\nAnd sends allegiance and true faith of heart\nTo his most royal person, hither come\nEven at his feet to lay my arms and power,\nProvided that my banishment repeal'd\nAnd lands restored again be freely granted:\nIf not, I'll use the advantage of my power\nAnd lay the summer's dust with showers of blood\nRain'd from the wounds of slaughter'd Englishmen:\nThe which, how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke\nIt is, such crimson tempest should bedrench\nThe fresh green lap of fair King Richard's land,\nMy stooping duty tenderly shall show.\nGo, signify as much, while here we march\nUpon the grassy carpet of this plain.\nLet's march without the noise of threatening drum,\nThat from this castle's tatter'd battlements\nOur fair appointments may be well perused.\nMethinks King Richard and myself should meet\nWith no less terror than the elements\nOf fire and water, when their thundering shock\nAt meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven.\nBe he the fire, I'll be the yielding water:\nThe rage be his, whilst on the earth I rain\nMy waters; on the earth, and not on him.\nMarch on, and mark King Richard how he looks.\nSee, see, King Richard doth himself appear,\nAs doth the blushing discontented sun\nFrom out the fiery portal of the east,\nWhen he perceives the envious clouds are bent\nTo dim his glory and to stain the track\nOf his bright passage to the occident.\n\nDUKE OF YORK:\nYet looks he like a king: behold, his eye,\nAs bright as is the eagle's, lightens forth\nControlling majesty: alack, alack, for woe,\nThat any harm should stain so fair a show!\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nWe are amazed; and thus long have we stood\nTo watch the fearful bending of thy knee,\nBecause we thought ourself thy lawful king:\nAnd if we be, how dare thy joints forget\nTo pay their awful duty to our presence?\nIf we be not, show us the hand of God\nThat hath dismissed us from our stewardship;\nFor well we know, no hand of blood and bone\nCan gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre,\nUnless he do profane, steal, or usurp.\nAnd though you think that all, as you have done,\nHave torn their souls by turning them from us,\nAnd we are barren and bereft of friends;\nYet know, my master, God omnipotent,\nIs mustering in his clouds on our behalf\nArmies of pestilence; and they shall strike\nYour children yet unborn and unbegot,\nThat lift your vassal hands against my head\nAnd threat the glory of my precious crown.\nTell Bolingbroke--for yond methinks he stands--\nThat every stride he makes upon my land\nIs dangerous treason: he is come to open\nThe purple testament of bleeding war;\nBut ere the crown he looks for live in peace,\nTen thousand bloody crowns of mothers' sons\nShall ill become the flower of England's face,\nChange the complexion of her maid-pale peace\nTo scarlet indignation and bedew\nHer pastures' grass with faithful English blood.\n\nNORTHUMBERLAND:\nThe king of heaven forbid our lord the king\nShould so with civil and uncivil arms\nBe rush'd upon! Thy thrice noble cousin\nHarry Bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand;\nAnd by the honourable tomb he swears,\nThat stands upon your royal grandsire's bones,\nAnd by the royalties of both your bloods,\nCurrents that spring from one most gracious head,\nAnd by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt,\nAnd by the worth and honour of himself,\nComprising all that may be sworn or said,\nHis coming hither hath no further scope\nThan for his lineal royalties and to beg\nEnfranchisement immediate on his knees:\nWhich on thy royal party granted once,\nHis glittering arms he will commend to rust,\nHis barbed steeds to stables, and his heart\nTo faithful service of your majesty.\nThis swears he, as he is a prince, is just;\nAnd, as I am a gentleman, I credit him.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nNorthumberland, say thus the king returns:\nHis noble cousin is right welcome hither;\nAnd all the number of his fair demands\nShall be accomplish'd without contradiction:\nWith all the gracious utterance thou hast\nSpeak to his gentle hearing kind commends.\nWe do debase ourselves, cousin, do we not,\nTo look so poorly and to speak so fair?\nShall we call back Northumberland, and send\nDefiance to the traitor, and so die?\n\nDUKE OF AUMERLE:\nNo, good my lord; let's fight with gentle words\nTill time lend friends and friends their helpful swords.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nO God, O God! that e'er this tongue of mine,\nThat laid the sentence of dread banishment\nOn yon proud man, should take it off again\nWith words of sooth! O that I were as great\nAs is my grief, or lesser than my name!\nOr that I could forget what I have been,\nOr not remember what I must be now!\nSwell'st thou, proud heart? I'll give thee scope to beat,\nSince foes have scope to beat both thee and me.\n\nDUKE OF AUMERLE:\nNorthumberland comes back from Bolingbroke.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nWhat must the king do now? must he submit?\nThe king shall do it: must he be deposed?\nThe king shall be contented: must he lose\nThe name of king? o' God's name, let it go:\nI'll give my jewels for a set of beads,\nMy gorgeous palace for a hermitage,\nMy gay apparel for an almsman's gown,\nMy figured goblets for a dish of wood,\nMy sceptre for a palmer's walking staff,\nMy subjects for a pair of carved saints\nAnd my large kingdom for a little grave,\nA little little grave, an obscure grave;\nOr I'll be buried in the king's highway,\nSome way of common trade, where subjects' feet\nMay hourly trample on their sovereign's head;\nFor on my heart they tread now whilst I live;\nAnd buried once, why not upon my head?\nAumerle, thou weep'st, my tender-hearted cousin!\nWe'll make foul weather with despised tears;\nOur sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn,\nAnd make a dearth in this revolting land.\nOr shall we play the wantons with our woes,\nAnd make some pretty match with shedding tears?\nAs thus, to drop them still upon one place,\nTill they have fretted us a pair of graves\nWithin the earth; and, therein laid,--there lies\nTwo kinsmen digg'd their graves with weeping eyes.\nWould not this ill do well? Well, well, I see\nI talk but idly, and you laugh at me.\nMost mighty prince, my Lord Northumberland,\nWhat says King Bolingbroke? will his majesty\nGive Richard leave to live till Richard die?\nYou make a leg, and Bolingbroke says ay.\n\nNORTHUMBERLAND:\nMy lord, in the base court he doth attend\nTo speak with you; may it please you to come down.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nDown, down I come; like glistering Phaethon,\nWanting the manage of unruly jades.\nIn the base court? Base court, where kings grow base,\nTo come at traitors' calls and do them grace.\nIn the base court? Come down? Down, court!\ndown, king!\nFor night-owls shriek where mounting larks\nshould sing.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nWhat says his majesty?\n\nNORTHUMBERLAND:\nSorrow and grief of heart\nMakes him speak fondly, like a frantic man\nYet he is come.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nStand all apart,\nAnd show fair duty to his majesty.\nMy gracious lord,--\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nFair cousin, you debase your princely knee\nTo make the base earth proud with kissing it:\nMe rather had my heart might feel your love\nThan my unpleased eye see your courtesy.\nUp, cousin, up; your heart is up, I know,\nThus high at least, although your knee be low.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nMy gracious lord, I come but for mine own.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nYour own is yours, and I am yours, and all.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nSo far be mine, my most redoubted lord,\nAs my true service shall deserve your love.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nWell you deserve: they well deserve to have,\nThat know the strong'st and surest way to get.\nUncle, give me your hands: nay, dry your eyes;\nTears show their love, but want their remedies.\nCousin, I am too young to be your father,\nThough you are old enough to be my heir.\nWhat you will have, I'll give, and willing too;\nFor do we must what force will have us do.\nSet on towards London, cousin, is it so?\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nYea, my good lord.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nThen I must not say no.\n\nQUEEN:\nWhat sport shall we devise here in this garden,\nTo drive away the heavy thought of care?\n\nLady:\nMadam, we'll play at bowls.\n\nQUEEN:\n'Twill make me think the world is full of rubs,\nAnd that my fortune rubs against the bias.\n\nLady:\nMadam, we'll dance.\n\nQUEEN:\nMy legs can keep no measure in delight,\nWhen my poor heart no measure keeps in grief:\nTherefore, no dancing, girl; some other sport.\n\nLady:\nMadam, we'll tell tales.\n\nQUEEN:\nOf sorrow or of joy?\n\nLady:\nOf either, madam.\n\nQUEEN:\nOf neither, girl:\nFor of joy, being altogether wanting,\nIt doth remember me the more of sorrow;\nOr if of grief, being altogether had,\nIt adds more sorrow to my want of joy:\nFor what I have I need not to repeat;\nAnd what I want it boots not to complain.\n\nLady:\nMadam, I'll sing.\n\nQUEEN:\n'Tis well that thou hast cause\nBut thou shouldst please me better, wouldst thou weep.\n\nLady:\nI could weep, madam, would it do you good.\n\nQUEEN:\nAnd I could sing, would weeping do me good,\nAnd never borrow any tear of thee.\nBut stay, here come the gardeners:\nLet's step into the shadow of these trees.\nMy wretchedness unto a row of pins,\nThey'll talk of state; for every one doth so\nAgainst a change; woe is forerun with woe.\n\nGardener:\nGo, bind thou up yon dangling apricocks,\nWhich, like unruly children, make their sire\nStoop with oppression of their prodigal weight:\nGive some supportance to the bending twigs.\nGo thou, and like an executioner,\nCut off the heads of too fast growing sprays,\nThat look too lofty in our commonwealth:\nAll must be even in our government.\nYou thus employ'd, I will go root away\nThe noisome weeds, which without profit suck\nThe soil's fertility from wholesome flowers.\n\nServant:\nWhy should we in the compass of a pale\nKeep law and form and due proportion,\nShowing, as in a model, our firm estate,\nWhen our sea-walled garden, the whole land,\nIs full of weeds, her fairest flowers choked up,\nHer fruit-trees all upturned, her hedges ruin'd,\nHer knots disorder'd and her wholesome herbs\nSwarming with caterpillars?\n\nGardener:\nHold thy peace:\nHe that hath suffer'd this disorder'd spring\nHath now himself met with the fall of leaf:\nThe weeds which his broad-spreading leaves did shelter,\nThat seem'd in eating him to hold him up,\nAre pluck'd up root and all by Bolingbroke,\nI mean the Earl of Wiltshire, Bushy, Green.\n\nServant:\nWhat, are they dead?\n\nGardener:\nThey are; and Bolingbroke\nHath seized the wasteful king. O, what pity is it\nThat he had not so trimm'd and dress'd his land\nAs we this garden! We at time of year\nDo wound the bark, the skin of our fruit-trees,\nLest, being over-proud in sap and blood,\nWith too much riches it confound itself:\nHad he done so to great and growing men,\nThey might have lived to bear and he to taste\nTheir fruits of duty: superfluous branches\nWe lop away, that bearing boughs may live:\nHad he done so, himself had borne the crown,\nWhich waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down.\n\nServant:\nWhat, think you then the king shall be deposed?\n\nGardener:\nDepress'd he is already, and deposed\n'Tis doubt he will be: letters came last night\nTo a dear friend of the good Duke of York's,\nThat tell black tidings.\n\nQUEEN:\nO, I am press'd to death through want of speaking!\nThou, old Adam's likeness, set to dress this garden,\nHow dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news?\nWhat Eve, what serpent, hath suggested thee\nTo make a second fall of cursed man?\nWhy dost thou say King Richard is deposed?\nDarest thou, thou little better thing than earth,\nDivine his downfall? Say, where, when, and how,\nCamest thou by this ill tidings? speak, thou wretch.\n\nGardener:\nPardon me, madam: little joy have I\nTo breathe this news; yet what I say is true.\nKing Richard, he is in the mighty hold\nOf Bolingbroke: their fortunes both are weigh'd:\nIn your lord's scale is nothing but himself,\nAnd some few vanities that make him light;\nBut in the balance of great Bolingbroke,\nBesides himself, are all the English peers,\nAnd with that odds he weighs King Richard down.\nPost you to London, and you will find it so;\nI speak no more than every one doth know.\n\nQUEEN:\nNimble mischance, that art so light of foot,\nDoth not thy embassage belong to me,\nAnd am I last that knows it? O, thou think'st\nTo serve me last, that I may longest keep\nThy sorrow in my breast. Come, ladies, go,\nTo meet at London London's king in woe.\nWhat, was I born to this, that my sad look\nShould grace the triumph of great Bolingbroke?\nGardener, for telling me these news of woe,\nPray God the plants thou graft'st may never grow.\n\nGARDENER:\nPoor queen! so that thy state might be no worse,\nI would my skill were subject to thy curse.\nHere did she fall a tear; here in this place\nI'll set a bank of rue, sour herb of grace:\nRue, even for ruth, here shortly shall be seen,\nIn the remembrance of a weeping queen.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nCall forth Bagot.\nNow, Bagot, freely speak thy mind;\nWhat thou dost know of noble Gloucester's death,\nWho wrought it with the king, and who perform'd\nThe bloody office of his timeless end.\n\nBAGOT:\nThen set before my face the Lord Aumerle.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nCousin, stand forth, and look upon that man.\n\nBAGOT:\nMy Lord Aumerle, I know your daring tongue\nScorns to unsay what once it hath deliver'd.\nIn that dead time when Gloucester's death was plotted,\nI heard you say, 'Is not my arm of length,\nThat reacheth from the restful English court\nAs far as Calais, to mine uncle's head?'\nAmongst much other talk, that very time,\nI heard you say that you had rather refuse\nThe offer of an hundred thousand crowns\nThan Bolingbroke's return to England;\nAdding withal how blest this land would be\nIn this your cousin's death.\n\nDUKE OF AUMERLE:\nPrinces and noble lords,\nWhat answer shall I make to this base man?\nShall I so much dishonour my fair stars,\nOn equal terms to give him chastisement?\nEither I must, or have mine honour soil'd\nWith the attainder of his slanderous lips.\nThere is my gage, the manual seal of death,\nThat marks thee out for hell: I say, thou liest,\nAnd will maintain what thou hast said is false\nIn thy heart-blood, though being all too base\nTo stain the temper of my knightly sword.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nBagot, forbear; thou shalt not take it up.\n\nDUKE OF AUMERLE:\nExcepting one, I would he were the best\nIn all this presence that hath moved me so.\n\nLORD FITZWATER:\nIf that thy valour stand on sympathy,\nThere is my gage, Aumerle, in gage to thine:\nBy that fair sun which shows me where thou stand'st,\nI heard thee say, and vauntingly thou spakest it\nThat thou wert cause of noble Gloucester's death.\nIf thou deny'st it twenty times, thou liest;\nAnd I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart,\nWhere it was forged, with my rapier's point.\n\nDUKE OF AUMERLE:\nThou darest not, coward, live to see that day.\n\nLORD FITZWATER:\nNow by my soul, I would it were this hour.\n\nDUKE OF AUMERLE:\nFitzwater, thou art damn'd to hell for this.\n\nHENRY PERCY:\nAumerle, thou liest; his honour is as true\nIn this appeal as thou art all unjust;\nAnd that thou art so, there I throw my gage,\nTo prove it on thee to the extremest point\nOf mortal breathing: seize it, if thou darest.\n\nDUKE OF AUMERLE:\nAn if I do not, may my hands rot off\nAnd never brandish more revengeful steel\nOver the glittering helmet of my foe!\n\nLord:\nI task the earth to the like, forsworn Aumerle;\nAnd spur thee on with full as many lies\nAs may be holloa'd in thy treacherous ear\nFrom sun to sun: there is my honour's pawn;\nEngage it to the trial, if thou darest.\n\nDUKE OF AUMERLE:\nWho sets me else? by heaven, I'll throw at all:\nI have a thousand spirits in one breast,\nTo answer twenty thousand such as you.\n\nDUKE OF SURREY:\nMy Lord Fitzwater, I do remember well\nThe very time Aumerle and you did talk.\n\nLORD FITZWATER:\n'Tis very true: you were in presence then;\nAnd you can witness with me this is true.\n\nDUKE OF SURREY:\nAs false, by heaven, as heaven itself is true.\n\nLORD FITZWATER:\nSurrey, thou liest.\n\nDUKE OF SURREY:\nDishonourable boy!\nThat lie shall lie so heavy on my sword,\nThat it shall render vengeance and revenge\nTill thou the lie-giver and that lie do lie\nIn earth as quiet as thy father's skull:\nIn proof whereof, there is my honour's pawn;\nEngage it to the trial, if thou darest.\n\nLORD FITZWATER:\nHow fondly dost thou spur a forward horse!\nIf I dare eat, or drink, or breathe, or live,\nI dare meet Surrey in a wilderness,\nAnd spit upon him, whilst I say he lies,\nAnd lies, and lies: there is my bond of faith,\nTo tie thee to my strong correction.\nAs I intend to thrive in this new world,\nAumerle is guilty of my true appeal:\nBesides, I heard the banish'd Norfolk say\nThat thou, Aumerle, didst send two of thy men\nTo execute the noble duke at Calais.\n\nDUKE OF AUMERLE:\nSome honest Christian trust me with a gage\nThat Norfolk lies: here do I throw down this,\nIf he may be repeal'd, to try his honour.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nThese differences shall all rest under gage\nTill Norfolk be repeal'd: repeal'd he shall be,\nAnd, though mine enemy, restored again\nTo all his lands and signories: when he's return'd,\nAgainst Aumerle we will enforce his trial.\n\nBISHOP OF CARLISLE:\nThat honourable day shall ne'er be seen.\nMany a time hath banish'd Norfolk fought\nFor Jesu Christ in glorious Christian field,\nStreaming the ensign of the Christian cross\nAgainst black pagans, Turks, and Saracens:\nAnd toil'd with works of war, retired himself\nTo Italy; and there at Venice gave\nHis body to that pleasant country's earth,\nAnd his pure soul unto his captain Christ,\nUnder whose colours he had fought so long.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nWhy, bishop, is Norfolk dead?\n\nBISHOP OF CARLISLE:\nAs surely as I live, my lord.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nSweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom\nOf good old Abraham! Lords appellants,\nYour differences shall all rest under gage\nTill we assign you to your days of trial.\n\nDUKE OF YORK:\nGreat Duke of Lancaster, I come to thee\nFrom plume-pluck'd Richard; who with willing soul\nAdopts thee heir, and his high sceptre yields\nTo the possession of thy royal hand:\nAscend his throne, descending now from him;\nAnd long live Henry, fourth of that name!\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nIn God's name, I'll ascend the regal throne.\n\nBISHOP OF CARLISLE:\nMarry. God forbid!\nWorst in this royal presence may I speak,\nYet best beseeming me to speak the truth.\nWould God that any in this noble presence\nWere enough noble to be upright judge\nOf noble Richard! then true noblesse would\nLearn him forbearance from so foul a wrong.\nWhat subject can give sentence on his king?\nAnd who sits here that is not Richard's subject?\nThieves are not judged but they are by to hear,\nAlthough apparent guilt be seen in them;\nAnd shall the figure of God's majesty,\nHis captain, steward, deputy-elect,\nAnointed, crowned, planted many years,\nBe judged by subject and inferior breath,\nAnd he himself not present? O, forfend it, God,\nThat in a Christian climate souls refined\nShould show so heinous, black, obscene a deed!\nI speak to subjects, and a subject speaks,\nStirr'd up by God, thus boldly for his king:\nMy Lord of Hereford here, whom you call king,\nIs a foul traitor to proud Hereford's king:\nAnd if you crown him, let me prophesy:\nThe blood of English shall manure the ground,\nAnd future ages groan for this foul act;\nPeace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels,\nAnd in this seat of peace tumultuous wars\nShall kin with kin and kind with kind confound;\nDisorder, horror, fear and mutiny\nShall here inhabit, and this land be call'd\nThe field of Golgotha and dead men's skulls.\nO, if you raise this house against this house,\nIt will the woefullest division prove\nThat ever fell upon this cursed earth.\nPrevent it, resist it, let it not be so,\nLest child, child's children, cry against you woe!\n\nNORTHUMBERLAND:\nWell have you argued, sir; and, for your pains,\nOf capital treason we arrest you here.\nMy Lord of Westminster, be it your charge\nTo keep him safely till his day of trial.\nMay it please you, lords, to grant the commons' suit.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nFetch hither Richard, that in common view\nHe may surrender; so we shall proceed\nWithout suspicion.\n\nDUKE OF YORK:\nI will be his conduct.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nLords, you that here are under our arrest,\nProcure your sureties for your days of answer.\nLittle are we beholding to your love,\nAnd little look'd for at your helping hands.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nAlack, why am I sent for to a king,\nBefore I have shook off the regal thoughts\nWherewith I reign'd? I hardly yet have learn'd\nTo insinuate, flatter, bow, and bend my limbs:\nGive sorrow leave awhile to tutor me\nTo this submission. Yet I well remember\nThe favours of these men: were they not mine?\nDid they not sometime cry, 'all hail!' to me?\nSo Judas did to Christ: but he, in twelve,\nFound truth in all but one: I, in twelve thousand, none.\nGod save the king! Will no man say amen?\nAm I both priest and clerk? well then, amen.\nGod save the king! although I be not he;\nAnd yet, amen, if heaven do think him me.\nTo do what service am I sent for hither?\n\nDUKE OF YORK:\nTo do that office of thine own good will\nWhich tired majesty did make thee offer,\nThe resignation of thy state and crown\nTo Henry Bolingbroke.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nGive me the crown. Here, cousin, seize the crown;\nHere cousin:\nOn this side my hand, and on that side yours.\nNow is this golden crown like a deep well\nThat owes two buckets, filling one another,\nThe emptier ever dancing in the air,\nThe other down, unseen and full of water:\nThat bucket down and full of tears am I,\nDrinking my griefs, whilst you mount up on high.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nI thought you had been willing to resign.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nMy crown I am; but still my griefs are mine:\nYou may my glories and my state depose,\nBut not my griefs; still am I king of those.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nPart of your cares you give me with your crown.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nYour cares set up do not pluck my cares down.\nMy care is loss of care, by old care done;\nYour care is gain of care, by new care won:\nThe cares I give I have, though given away;\nThey tend the crown, yet still with me they stay.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nAre you contented to resign the crown?\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nAy, no; no, ay; for I must nothing be;\nTherefore no no, for I resign to thee.\nNow mark me, how I will undo myself;\nI give this heavy weight from off my head\nAnd this unwieldy sceptre from my hand,\nThe pride of kingly sway from out my heart;\nWith mine own tears I wash away my balm,\nWith mine own hands I give away my crown,\nWith mine own tongue deny my sacred state,\nWith mine own breath release all duty's rites:\nAll pomp and majesty I do forswear;\nMy manors, rents, revenues I forego;\nMy acts, decrees, and statutes I deny:\nGod pardon all oaths that are broke to me!\nGod keep all vows unbroke that swear to thee!\nMake me, that nothing have, with nothing grieved,\nAnd thou with all pleased, that hast all achieved!\nLong mayst thou live in Richard's seat to sit,\nAnd soon lie Richard in an earthly pit!\nGod save King Harry, unking'd Richard says,\nAnd send him many years of sunshine days!\nWhat more remains?\n\nNORTHUMBERLAND:\nNo more, but that you read\nThese accusations and these grievous crimes\nCommitted by your person and your followers\nAgainst the state and profit of this land;\nThat, by confessing them, the souls of men\nMay deem that you are worthily deposed.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nMust I do so? and must I ravel out\nMy weaved-up folly? Gentle Northumberland,\nIf thy offences were upon record,\nWould it not shame thee in so fair a troop\nTo read a lecture of them? If thou wouldst,\nThere shouldst thou find one heinous article,\nContaining the deposing of a king\nAnd cracking the strong warrant of an oath,\nMark'd with a blot, damn'd in the book of heaven:\nNay, all of you that stand and look upon,\nWhilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself,\nThough some of you with Pilate wash your hands\nShowing an outward pity; yet you Pilates\nHave here deliver'd me to my sour cross,\nAnd water cannot wash away your sin.\n\nNORTHUMBERLAND:\nMy lord, dispatch; read o'er these articles.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nMine eyes are full of tears, I cannot see:\nAnd yet salt water blinds them not so much\nBut they can see a sort of traitors here.\nNay, if I turn mine eyes upon myself,\nI find myself a traitor with the rest;\nFor I have given here my soul's consent\nTo undeck the pompous body of a king;\nMade glory base and sovereignty a slave,\nProud majesty a subject, state a peasant.\n\nNORTHUMBERLAND:\nMy lord,--\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nNo lord of thine, thou haught insulting man,\nNor no man's lord; I have no name, no title,\nNo, not that name was given me at the font,\nBut 'tis usurp'd: alack the heavy day,\nThat I have worn so many winters out,\nAnd know not now what name to call myself!\nO that I were a mockery king of snow,\nStanding before the sun of Bolingbroke,\nTo melt myself away in water-drops!\nGood king, great king, and yet not greatly good,\nAn if my word be sterling yet in England,\nLet it command a mirror hither straight,\nThat it may show me what a face I have,\nSince it is bankrupt of his majesty.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nGo some of you and fetch a looking-glass.\n\nNORTHUMBERLAND:\nRead o'er this paper while the glass doth come.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nFiend, thou torment'st me ere I come to hell!\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nUrge it no more, my Lord Northumberland.\n\nNORTHUMBERLAND:\nThe commons will not then be satisfied.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nThey shall be satisfied: I'll read enough,\nWhen I do see the very book indeed\nWhere all my sins are writ, and that's myself.\nGive me the glass, and therein will I read.\nNo deeper wrinkles yet? hath sorrow struck\nSo many blows upon this face of mine,\nAnd made no deeper wounds? O flattering glass,\nLike to my followers in prosperity,\nThou dost beguile me! Was this face the face\nThat every day under his household roof\nDid keep ten thousand men? was this the face\nThat, like the sun, did make beholders wink?\nWas this the face that faced so many follies,\nAnd was at last out-faced by Bolingbroke?\nA brittle glory shineth in this face:\nAs brittle as the glory is the face;\nFor there it is, crack'd in a hundred shivers.\nMark, silent king, the moral of this sport,\nHow soon my sorrow hath destroy'd my face.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nThe shadow of your sorrow hath destroy'd\nThe shadow or your face.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nSay that again.\nThe shadow of my sorrow! ha! let's see:\n'Tis very true, my grief lies all within;\nAnd these external manners of laments\nAre merely shadows to the unseen grief\nThat swells with silence in the tortured soul;\nThere lies the substance: and I thank thee, king,\nFor thy great bounty, that not only givest\nMe cause to wail but teachest me the way\nHow to lament the cause. I'll beg one boon,\nAnd then be gone and trouble you no more.\nShall I obtain it?\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nName it, fair cousin.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\n'Fair cousin'? I am greater than a king:\nFor when I was a king, my flatterers\nWere then but subjects; being now a subject,\nI have a king here to my flatterer.\nBeing so great, I have no need to beg.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nYet ask.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nAnd shall I have?\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nYou shall.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nThen give me leave to go.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nWhither?\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nWhither you will, so I were from your sights.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nGo, some of you convey him to the Tower.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nO, good! convey? conveyers are you all,\nThat rise thus nimbly by a true king's fall.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nOn Wednesday next we solemnly set down\nOur coronation: lords, prepare yourselves.\n\nAbbot:\nA woeful pageant have we here beheld.\n\nBISHOP OF CARLISLE:\nThe woe's to come; the children yet unborn.\nShall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn.\n\nDUKE OF AUMERLE:\nYou holy clergymen, is there no plot\nTo rid the realm of this pernicious blot?\n\nAbbot:\nMy lord,\nBefore I freely speak my mind herein,\nYou shall not only take the sacrament\nTo bury mine intents, but also to effect\nWhatever I shall happen to devise.\nI see your brows are full of discontent,\nYour hearts of sorrow and your eyes of tears:\nCome home with me to supper; and I'll lay\nA plot shall show us all a merry day.\n\nQUEEN:\nThis way the king will come; this is the way\nTo Julius Caesar's ill-erected tower,\nTo whose flint bosom my condemned lord\nIs doom'd a prisoner by proud Bolingbroke:\nHere let us rest, if this rebellious earth\nHave any resting for her true king's queen.\nBut soft, but see, or rather do not see,\nMy fair rose wither: yet look up, behold,\nThat you in pity may dissolve to dew,\nAnd wash him fresh again with true-love tears.\nAh, thou, the model where old Troy did stand,\nThou map of honour, thou King Richard's tomb,\nAnd not King Richard; thou most beauteous inn,\nWhy should hard-favour'd grief be lodged in thee,\nWhen triumph is become an alehouse guest?\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nJoin not with grief, fair woman, do not so,\nTo make my end too sudden: learn, good soul,\nTo think our former state a happy dream;\nFrom which awaked, the truth of what we are\nShows us but this: I am sworn brother, sweet,\nTo grim Necessity, and he and I\nWill keep a league till death. Hie thee to France\nAnd cloister thee in some religious house:\nOur holy lives must win a new world's crown,\nWhich our profane hours here have stricken down.\n\nQUEEN:\nWhat, is my Richard both in shape and mind\nTransform'd and weaken'd? hath Bolingbroke deposed\nThine intellect? hath he been in thy heart?\nThe lion dying thrusteth forth his paw,\nAnd wounds the earth, if nothing else, with rage\nTo be o'erpower'd; and wilt thou, pupil-like,\nTake thy correction mildly, kiss the rod,\nAnd fawn on rage with base humility,\nWhich art a lion and a king of beasts?\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nA king of beasts, indeed; if aught but beasts,\nI had been still a happy king of men.\nGood sometime queen, prepare thee hence for France:\nThink I am dead and that even here thou takest,\nAs from my death-bed, thy last living leave.\nIn winter's tedious nights sit by the fire\nWith good old folks and let them tell thee tales\nOf woeful ages long ago betid;\nAnd ere thou bid good night, to quit their griefs,\nTell thou the lamentable tale of me\nAnd send the hearers weeping to their beds:\nFor why, the senseless brands will sympathize\nThe heavy accent of thy moving tongue\nAnd in compassion weep the fire out;\nAnd some will mourn in ashes, some coal-black,\nFor the deposing of a rightful king.\n\nNORTHUMBERLAND:\nMy lord, the mind of Bolingbroke is changed:\nYou must to Pomfret, not unto the Tower.\nAnd, madam, there is order ta'en for you;\nWith all swift speed you must away to France.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nNorthumberland, thou ladder wherewithal\nThe mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne,\nThe time shall not be many hours of age\nMore than it is ere foul sin gathering head\nShalt break into corruption: thou shalt think,\nThough he divide the realm and give thee half,\nIt is too little, helping him to all;\nAnd he shall think that thou, which know'st the way\nTo plant unrightful kings, wilt know again,\nBeing ne'er so little urged, another way\nTo pluck him headlong from the usurped throne.\nThe love of wicked men converts to fear;\nThat fear to hate, and hate turns one or both\nTo worthy danger and deserved death.\n\nNORTHUMBERLAND:\nMy guilt be on my head, and there an end.\nTake leave and part; for you must part forthwith.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nDoubly divorced! Bad men, you violate\nA twofold marriage, 'twixt my crown and me,\nAnd then betwixt me and my married wife.\nLet me unkiss the oath 'twixt thee and me;\nAnd yet not so, for with a kiss 'twas made.\nPart us, Northumberland; I toward the north,\nWhere shivering cold and sickness pines the clime;\nMy wife to France: from whence, set forth in pomp,\nShe came adorned hither like sweet May,\nSent back like Hallowmas or short'st of day.\n\nQUEEN:\nAnd must we be divided? must we part?\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nAy, hand from hand, my love, and heart from heart.\n\nQUEEN:\nBanish us both and send the king with me.\n\nNORTHUMBERLAND:\nThat were some love but little policy.\n\nQUEEN:\nThen whither he goes, thither let me go.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nSo two, together weeping, make one woe.\nWeep thou for me in France, I for thee here;\nBetter far off than near, be ne'er the near.\nGo, count thy way with sighs; I mine with groans.\n\nQUEEN:\nSo longest way shall have the longest moans.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nTwice for one step I'll groan, the way being short,\nAnd piece the way out with a heavy heart.\nCome, come, in wooing sorrow let's be brief,\nSince, wedding it, there is such length in grief;\nOne kiss shall stop our mouths, and dumbly part;\nThus give I mine, and thus take I thy heart.\n\nQUEEN:\nGive me mine own again; 'twere no good part\nTo take on me to keep and kill thy heart.\nSo, now I have mine own again, be gone,\nThat I might strive to kill it with a groan.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nWe make woe wanton with this fond delay:\nOnce more, adieu; the rest let sorrow say.\n\nDUCHESS OF YORK:\nMy lord, you told me you would tell the rest,\nWhen weeping made you break the story off,\nof our two cousins coming into London.\n\nDUKE OF YORK:\nWhere did I leave?\n\nDUCHESS OF YORK:\nAt that sad stop, my lord,\nWhere rude misgovern'd hands from windows' tops\nThrew dust and rubbish on King Richard's head.\n\nDUKE OF YORK:\nThen, as I said, the duke, great Bolingbroke,\nMounted upon a hot and fiery steed\nWhich his aspiring rider seem'd to know,\nWith slow but stately pace kept on his course,\nWhilst all tongues cried 'God save thee,\nBolingbroke!'\nYou would have thought the very windows spake,\nSo many greedy looks of young and old\nThrough casements darted their desiring eyes\nUpon his visage, and that all the walls\nWith painted imagery had said at once\n'Jesu preserve thee! welcome, Bolingbroke!'\nWhilst he, from the one side to the other turning,\nBareheaded, lower than his proud steed's neck,\nBespake them thus: 'I thank you, countrymen:'\nAnd thus still doing, thus he pass'd along.\n\nDUCHESS OF YORK:\nAlack, poor Richard! where rode he the whilst?\n\nDUKE OF YORK:\nAs in a theatre, the eyes of men,\nAfter a well-graced actor leaves the stage,\nAre idly bent on him that enters next,\nThinking his prattle to be tedious;\nEven so, or with much more contempt, men's eyes\nDid scowl on gentle Richard; no man cried 'God save him!'\nNo joyful tongue gave him his welcome home:\nBut dust was thrown upon his sacred head:\nWhich with such gentle sorrow he shook off,\nHis face still combating with tears and smiles,\nThe badges of his grief and patience,\nThat had not God, for some strong purpose, steel'd\nThe hearts of men, they must perforce have melted\nAnd barbarism itself have pitied him.\nBut heaven hath a hand in these events,\nTo whose high will we bound our calm contents.\nTo Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now,\nWhose state and honour I for aye allow.\n\nDUCHESS OF YORK:\nHere comes my son Aumerle.\n\nDUKE OF YORK:\nAumerle that was;\nBut that is lost for being Richard's friend,\nAnd, madam, you must call him Rutland now:\nI am in parliament pledge for his truth\nAnd lasting fealty to the new-made king.\n\nDUCHESS OF YORK:\nWelcome, my son: who are the violets now\nThat strew the green lap of the new come spring?\n\nDUKE OF AUMERLE:\nMadam, I know not, nor I greatly care not:\nGod knows I had as lief be none as one.\n\nDUKE OF YORK:\nWell, bear you well in this new spring of time,\nLest you be cropp'd before you come to prime.\nWhat news from Oxford? hold those justs and triumphs?\n\nDUKE OF AUMERLE:\nFor aught I know, my lord, they do.\n\nDUKE OF YORK:\nYou will be there, I know.\n\nDUKE OF AUMERLE:\nIf God prevent not, I purpose so.\n\nDUKE OF YORK:\nWhat seal is that, that hangs without thy bosom?\nYea, look'st thou pale? let me see the writing.\n\nDUKE OF AUMERLE:\nMy lord, 'tis nothing.\n\nDUKE OF YORK:\nNo matter, then, who see it;\nI will be satisfied; let me see the writing.\n\nDUKE OF AUMERLE:\nI do beseech your grace to pardon me:\nIt is a matter of small consequence,\nWhich for some reasons I would not have seen.\n\nDUKE OF YORK:\nWhich for some reasons, sir, I mean to see.\nI fear, I fear,--\n\nDUCHESS OF YORK:\nWhat should you fear?\n'Tis nothing but some bond, that he is enter'd into\nFor gay apparel 'gainst the triumph day.\n\nDUKE OF YORK:\nBound to himself! what doth he with a bond\nThat he is bound to? Wife, thou art a fool.\nBoy, let me see the writing.\n\nDUKE OF AUMERLE:\nI do beseech you, pardon me; I may not show it.\n\nDUKE OF YORK:\nI will be satisfied; let me see it, I say.\nTreason! foul treason! Villain! traitor! slave!\n\nDUCHESS OF YORK:\nWhat is the matter, my lord?\n\nDUKE OF YORK:\nHo! who is within there?\nSaddle my horse.\nGod for his mercy, what treachery is here!\n\nDUCHESS OF YORK:\nWhy, what is it, my lord?\n\nDUKE OF YORK:\nGive me my boots, I say; saddle my horse.\nNow, by mine honour, by my life, by my troth,\nI will appeach the villain.\n\nDUCHESS OF YORK:\nWhat is the matter?\n\nDUKE OF YORK:\nPeace, foolish woman.\n\nDUCHESS OF YORK:\nI will not peace. What is the matter, Aumerle.\n\nDUKE OF AUMERLE:\nGood mother, be content; it is no more\nThan my poor life must answer.\n\nDUCHESS OF YORK:\nThy life answer!\n\nDUKE OF YORK:\nBring me my boots: I will unto the king.\n\nDUCHESS OF YORK:\nStrike him, Aumerle. Poor boy, thou art amazed.\nHence, villain! never more come in my sight.\n\nDUKE OF YORK:\nGive me my boots, I say.\n\nDUCHESS OF YORK:\nWhy, York, what wilt thou do?\nWilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own?\nHave we more sons? or are we like to have?\nIs not my teeming date drunk up with time?\nAnd wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age,\nAnd rob me of a happy mother's name?\nIs he not like thee? is he not thine own?\n\nDUKE OF YORK:\nThou fond mad woman,\nWilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy?\nA dozen of them here have ta'en the sacrament,\nAnd interchangeably set down their hands,\nTo kill the king at Oxford.\n\nDUCHESS OF YORK:\nHe shall be none;\nWe'll keep him here: then what is that to him?\n\nDUKE OF YORK:\nAway, fond woman! were he twenty times my son,\nI would appeach him.\n\nDUCHESS OF YORK:\nHadst thou groan'd for him\nAs I have done, thou wouldst be more pitiful.\nBut now I know thy mind; thou dost suspect\nThat I have been disloyal to thy bed,\nAnd that he is a bastard, not thy son:\nSweet York, sweet husband, be not of that mind:\nHe is as like thee as a man may be,\nNot like to me, or any of my kin,\nAnd yet I love him.\n\nDUKE OF YORK:\nMake way, unruly woman!\n\nDUCHESS OF YORK:\nAfter, Aumerle! mount thee upon his horse;\nSpur post, and get before him to the king,\nAnd beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee.\nI'll not be long behind; though I be old,\nI doubt not but to ride as fast as York:\nAnd never will I rise up from the ground\nTill Bolingbroke have pardon'd thee. Away, be gone!\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nCan no man tell me of my unthrifty son?\n'Tis full three months since I did see him last;\nIf any plague hang over us, 'tis he.\nI would to God, my lords, he might be found:\nInquire at London, 'mongst the taverns there,\nFor there, they say, he daily doth frequent,\nWith unrestrained loose companions,\nEven such, they say, as stand in narrow lanes,\nAnd beat our watch, and rob our passengers;\nWhich he, young wanton and effeminate boy,\nTakes on the point of honour to support\nSo dissolute a crew.\n\nHENRY PERCY:\nMy lord, some two days since I saw the prince,\nAnd told him of those triumphs held at Oxford.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nAnd what said the gallant?\n\nHENRY PERCY:\nHis answer was, he would unto the stews,\nAnd from the common'st creature pluck a glove,\nAnd wear it as a favour; and with that\nHe would unhorse the lustiest challenger.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nAs dissolute as desperate; yet through both\nI see some sparks of better hope, which elder years\nMay happily bring forth. But who comes here?\n\nDUKE OF AUMERLE:\nWhere is the king?\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nWhat means our cousin, that he stares and looks\nSo wildly?\n\nDUKE OF AUMERLE:\nGod save your grace! I do beseech your majesty,\nTo have some conference with your grace alone.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nWithdraw yourselves, and leave us here alone.\nWhat is the matter with our cousin now?\n\nDUKE OF AUMERLE:\nFor ever may my knees grow to the earth,\nMy tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth\nUnless a pardon ere I rise or speak.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nIntended or committed was this fault?\nIf on the first, how heinous e'er it be,\nTo win thy after-love I pardon thee.\n\nDUKE OF AUMERLE:\nThen give me leave that I may turn the key,\nThat no man enter till my tale be done.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nHave thy desire.\n\nDUKE OF YORK:\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nVillain, I'll make thee safe.\n\nDUKE OF AUMERLE:\nStay thy revengeful hand; thou hast no cause to fear.\n\nDUKE OF YORK:\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nWhat is the matter, uncle? speak;\nRecover breath; tell us how near is danger,\nThat we may arm us to encounter it.\n\nDUKE OF YORK:\nPeruse this writing here, and thou shalt know\nThe treason that my haste forbids me show.\n\nDUKE OF AUMERLE:\nRemember, as thou read'st, thy promise pass'd:\nI do repent me; read not my name there\nMy heart is not confederate with my hand.\n\nDUKE OF YORK:\nIt was, villain, ere thy hand did set it down.\nI tore it from the traitor's bosom, king;\nFear, and not love, begets his penitence:\nForget to pity him, lest thy pity prove\nA serpent that will sting thee to the heart.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nO heinous, strong and bold conspiracy!\nO loyal father of a treacherous son!\nThou sheer, immaculate and silver fountain,\nFrom when this stream through muddy passages\nHath held his current and defiled himself!\nThy overflow of good converts to bad,\nAnd thy abundant goodness shall excuse\nThis deadly blot in thy digressing son.\n\nDUKE OF YORK:\nSo shall my virtue be his vice's bawd;\nAnd he shall spend mine honour with his shame,\nAs thriftless sons their scraping fathers' gold.\nMine honour lives when his dishonour dies,\nOr my shamed life in his dishonour lies:\nThou kill'st me in his life; giving him breath,\nThe traitor lives, the true man's put to death.\n\nDUCHESS OF YORK:\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nWhat shrill-voiced suppliant makes this eager cry?\n\nDUCHESS OF YORK:\nA woman, and thy aunt, great king; 'tis I.\nSpeak with me, pity me, open the door.\nA beggar begs that never begg'd before.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nOur scene is alter'd from a serious thing,\nAnd now changed to 'The Beggar and the King.'\nMy dangerous cousin, let your mother in:\nI know she is come to pray for your foul sin.\n\nDUKE OF YORK:\nIf thou do pardon, whosoever pray,\nMore sins for this forgiveness prosper may.\nThis fester'd joint cut off, the rest rest sound;\nThis let alone will all the rest confound.\n\nDUCHESS OF YORK:\nO king, believe not this hard-hearted man!\nLove loving not itself none other can.\n\nDUKE OF YORK:\nThou frantic woman, what dost thou make here?\nShall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear?\n\nDUCHESS OF YORK:\nSweet York, be patient. Hear me, gentle liege.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nRise up, good aunt.\n\nDUCHESS OF YORK:\nNot yet, I thee beseech:\nFor ever will I walk upon my knees,\nAnd never see day that the happy sees,\nTill thou give joy; until thou bid me joy,\nBy pardoning Rutland, my transgressing boy.\n\nDUKE OF AUMERLE:\nUnto my mother's prayers I bend my knee.\n\nDUKE OF YORK:\nAgainst them both my true joints bended be.\nIll mayst thou thrive, if thou grant any grace!\n\nDUCHESS OF YORK:\nPleads he in earnest? look upon his face;\nHis eyes do drop no tears, his prayers are in jest;\nHis words come from his mouth, ours from our breast:\nHe prays but faintly and would be denied;\nWe pray with heart and soul and all beside:\nHis weary joints would gladly rise, I know;\nOur knees shall kneel till to the ground they grow:\nHis prayers are full of false hypocrisy;\nOurs of true zeal and deep integrity.\nOur prayers do out-pray his; then let them have\nThat mercy which true prayer ought to have.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nGood aunt, stand up.\n\nDUCHESS OF YORK:\nNay, do not say, 'stand up;'\nSay, 'pardon' first, and afterwards 'stand up.'\nAnd if I were thy nurse, thy tongue to teach,\n'Pardon' should be the first word of thy speech.\nI never long'd to hear a word till now;\nSay 'pardon,' king; let pity teach thee how:\nThe word is short, but not so short as sweet;\nNo word like 'pardon' for kings' mouths so meet.\n\nDUKE OF YORK:\nSpeak it in French, king; say, 'pardonne moi.'\n\nDUCHESS OF YORK:\nDost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?\nAh, my sour husband, my hard-hearted lord,\nThat set'st the word itself against the word!\nSpeak 'pardon' as 'tis current in our land;\nThe chopping French we do not understand.\nThine eye begins to speak; set thy tongue there;\nOr in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear;\nThat hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce,\nPity may move thee 'pardon' to rehearse.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nGood aunt, stand up.\n\nDUCHESS OF YORK:\nI do not sue to stand;\nPardon is all the suit I have in hand.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nI pardon him, as God shall pardon me.\n\nDUCHESS OF YORK:\nO happy vantage of a kneeling knee!\nYet am I sick for fear: speak it again;\nTwice saying 'pardon' doth not pardon twain,\nBut makes one pardon strong.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nWith all my heart\nI pardon him.\n\nDUCHESS OF YORK:\nA god on earth thou art.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nBut for our trusty brother-in-law and the abbot,\nWith all the rest of that consorted crew,\nDestruction straight shall dog them at the heels.\nGood uncle, help to order several powers\nTo Oxford, or where'er these traitors are:\nThey shall not live within this world, I swear,\nBut I will have them, if I once know where.\nUncle, farewell: and, cousin too, adieu:\nYour mother well hath pray'd, and prove you true.\n\nDUCHESS OF YORK:\nCome, my old son: I pray God make thee new.\n\nEXTON:\nDidst thou not mark the king, what words he spake,\n'Have I no friend will rid me of this living fear?'\nWas it not so?\n\nServant:\nThese were his very words.\n\nEXTON:\n'Have I no friend?' quoth he: he spake it twice,\nAnd urged it twice together, did he not?\n\nServant:\nHe did.\n\nEXTON:\nAnd speaking it, he wistly look'd on me,\nAnd who should say, 'I would thou wert the man'\nThat would divorce this terror from my heart;'\nMeaning the king at Pomfret. Come, let's go:\nI am the king's friend, and will rid his foe.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nI have been studying how I may compare\nThis prison where I live unto the world:\nAnd for because the world is populous\nAnd here is not a creature but myself,\nI cannot do it; yet I'll hammer it out.\nMy brain I'll prove the female to my soul,\nMy soul the father; and these two beget\nA generation of still-breeding thoughts,\nAnd these same thoughts people this little world,\nIn humours like the people of this world,\nFor no thought is contented. The better sort,\nAs thoughts of things divine, are intermix'd\nWith scruples and do set the word itself\nAgainst the word:\nAs thus, 'Come, little ones,' and then again,\n'It is as hard to come as for a camel\nTo thread the postern of a small needle's eye.'\nThoughts tending to ambition, they do plot\nUnlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails\nMay tear a passage through the flinty ribs\nOf this hard world, my ragged prison walls,\nAnd, for they cannot, die in their own pride.\nThoughts tending to content flatter themselves\nThat they are not the first of fortune's slaves,\nNor shall not be the last; like silly beggars\nWho sitting in the stocks refuge their shame,\nThat many have and others must sit there;\nAnd in this thought they find a kind of ease,\nBearing their own misfortunes on the back\nOf such as have before endured the like.\nThus play I in one person many people,\nAnd none contented: sometimes am I king;\nThen treasons make me wish myself a beggar,\nAnd so I am: then crushing penury\nPersuades me I was better when a king;\nThen am I king'd again: and by and by\nThink that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke,\nAnd straight am nothing: but whate'er I be,\nNor I nor any man that but man is\nWith nothing shall be pleased, till he be eased\nWith being nothing. Music do I hear?\nHa, ha! keep time: how sour sweet music is,\nWhen time is broke and no proportion kept!\nSo is it in the music of men's lives.\nAnd here have I the daintiness of ear\nTo cheque time broke in a disorder'd string;\nBut for the concord of my state and time\nHad not an ear to hear my true time broke.\nI wasted time, and now doth time waste me;\nFor now hath time made me his numbering clock:\nMy thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar\nTheir watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,\nWhereto my finger, like a dial's point,\nIs pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.\nNow sir, the sound that tells what hour it is\nAre clamorous groans, which strike upon my heart,\nWhich is the bell: so sighs and tears and groans\nShow minutes, times, and hours: but my time\nRuns posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy,\nWhile I stand fooling here, his Jack o' the clock.\nThis music mads me; let it sound no more;\nFor though it have holp madmen to their wits,\nIn me it seems it will make wise men mad.\nYet blessing on his heart that gives it me!\nFor 'tis a sign of love; and love to Richard\nIs a strange brooch in this all-hating world.\n\nGroom:\nHail, royal prince!\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nThanks, noble peer;\nThe cheapest of us is ten groats too dear.\nWhat art thou? and how comest thou hither,\nWhere no man never comes but that sad dog\nThat brings me food to make misfortune live?\n\nGroom:\nI was a poor groom of thy stable, king,\nWhen thou wert king; who, travelling towards York,\nWith much ado at length have gotten leave\nTo look upon my sometimes royal master's face.\nO, how it yearn'd my heart when I beheld\nIn London streets, that coronation-day,\nWhen Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary,\nThat horse that thou so often hast bestrid,\nThat horse that I so carefully have dress'd!\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nRode he on Barbary? Tell me, gentle friend,\nHow went he under him?\n\nGroom:\nSo proudly as if he disdain'd the ground.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nSo proud that Bolingbroke was on his back!\nThat jade hath eat bread from my royal hand;\nThis hand hath made him proud with clapping him.\nWould he not stumble? would he not fall down,\nSince pride must have a fall, and break the neck\nOf that proud man that did usurp his back?\nForgiveness, horse! why do I rail on thee,\nSince thou, created to be awed by man,\nWast born to bear? I was not made a horse;\nAnd yet I bear a burthen like an ass,\nSpurr'd, gall'd and tired by jouncing Bolingbroke.\n\nKeeper:\nFellow, give place; here is no longer stay.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nIf thou love me, 'tis time thou wert away.\n\nGroom:\nWhat my tongue dares not, that my heart shall say.\n\nKeeper:\nMy lord, will't please you to fall to?\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nTaste of it first, as thou art wont to do.\n\nKeeper:\nMy lord, I dare not: Sir Pierce of Exton, who\nlately came from the king, commands the contrary.\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nThe devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee!\nPatience is stale, and I am weary of it.\n\nKeeper:\nHelp, help, help!\n\nKING RICHARD II:\nHow now! what means death in this rude assault?\nVillain, thy own hand yields thy death's instrument.\nGo thou, and fill another room in hell.\nThat hand shall burn in never-quenching fire\nThat staggers thus my person. Exton, thy fierce hand\nHath with the king's blood stain'd the king's own land.\nMount, mount, my soul! thy seat is up on high;\nWhilst my gross flesh sinks downward, here to die.\n\nEXTON:\nAs full of valour as of royal blood:\nBoth have I spill'd; O would the deed were good!\nFor now the devil, that told me I did well,\nSays that this deed is chronicled in hell.\nThis dead king to the living king I'll bear\nTake hence the rest, and give them burial here.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nKind uncle York, the latest news we hear\nIs that the rebels have consumed with fire\nOur town of Cicester in Gloucestershire;\nBut whether they be ta'en or slain we hear not.\nWelcome, my lord what is the news?\n\nNORTHUMBERLAND:\nFirst, to thy sacred state wish I all happiness.\nThe next news is, I have to London sent\nThe heads of Oxford, Salisbury, Blunt, and Kent:\nThe manner of their taking may appear\nAt large discoursed in this paper here.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nWe thank thee, gentle Percy, for thy pains;\nAnd to thy worth will add right worthy gains.\n\nLORD FITZWATER:\nMy lord, I have from Oxford sent to London\nThe heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely,\nTwo of the dangerous consorted traitors\nThat sought at Oxford thy dire overthrow.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nThy pains, Fitzwater, shall not be forgot;\nRight noble is thy merit, well I wot.\n\nHENRY PERCY:\nThe grand conspirator, Abbot of Westminster,\nWith clog of conscience and sour melancholy\nHath yielded up his body to the grave;\nBut here is Carlisle living, to abide\nThy kingly doom and sentence of his pride.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nCarlisle, this is your doom:\nChoose out some secret place, some reverend room,\nMore than thou hast, and with it joy thy life;\nSo as thou livest in peace, die free from strife:\nFor though mine enemy thou hast ever been,\nHigh sparks of honour in thee have I seen.\n\nEXTON:\nGreat king, within this coffin I present\nThy buried fear: herein all breathless lies\nThe mightiest of thy greatest enemies,\nRichard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nExton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought\nA deed of slander with thy fatal hand\nUpon my head and all this famous land.\n\nEXTON:\nFrom your own mouth, my lord, did I this deed.\n\nHENRY BOLINGBROKE:\nThey love not poison that do poison need,\nNor do I thee: though I did wish him dead,\nI hate the murderer, love him murdered.\nThe guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour,\nBut neither my good word nor princely favour:\nWith Cain go wander through shades of night,\nAnd never show thy head by day nor light.\nLords, I protest, my soul is full of woe,\nThat blood should sprinkle me to make me grow:\nCome, mourn with me for that I do lament,\nAnd put on sullen black incontinent:\nI'll make a voyage to the Holy Land,\nTo wash this blood off from my guilty hand:\nMarch sadly after; grace my mournings here;\nIn weeping after this untimely bier.\n\n\nSAMPSON:\nGregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.\n\nGREGORY:\nNo, for then we should be colliers.\n\nSAMPSON:\nI mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.\n\nGREGORY:\nAy, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.\n\nSAMPSON:\nI strike quickly, being moved.\n\nGREGORY:\nBut thou art not quickly moved to strike.\n\nSAMPSON:\nA dog of the house of Montague moves me.\n\nGREGORY:\nTo move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:\ntherefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.\n\nSAMPSON:\nA dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will\ntake the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.\n\nGREGORY:\nThat shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes\nto the wall.\n\nSAMPSON:\nTrue; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,\nare ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push\nMontague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids\nto the wall.\n\nGREGORY:\nThe quarrel is between our masters and us their men.\n\nSAMPSON:\n'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I\nhave fought with the men, I will be cruel with the\nmaids, and cut off their heads.\n\nGREGORY:\nThe heads of the maids?\n\nSAMPSON:\nAy, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;\ntake it in what sense thou wilt.\n\nGREGORY:\nThey must take it in sense that feel it.\n\nSAMPSON:\nMe they shall feel while I am able to stand: and\n'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.\n\nGREGORY:\n'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou\nhadst been poor John.

I will bite my thumb at them;\nwhich is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.\n\nABRAHAM:\nDo you bite your thumb at us, sir?\n\nSAMPSON:\nI do bite my thumb, sir.\n\nABRAHAM:\nDo you bite your thumb at us, sir?\n\nSAMPSON:\n\nGREGORY:\nNo.\n\nSAMPSON:\nNo, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I\nbite my thumb, sir.\n\nGREGORY:\nDo you quarrel, sir?\n\nABRAHAM:\nQuarrel sir! no, sir.\n\nSAMPSON:\nIf you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.\n\nABRAHAM:\nNo better.\n\nSAMPSON:\nWell, sir.\n\nGREGORY:\nSay 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.\n\nSAMPSON:\nYes, better, sir.\n\nABRAHAM:\nYou lie.\n\nSAMPSON:\nDraw, if you be men.

I hate the word,\nAs I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:\nHave at thee, coward!\n\nFirst Citizen:\nClubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!\nDown with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!\n\nCAPULET:\nWhat noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!\n\nLADY CAPULET:\nA crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?\n\nCAPULET:\nMy sword, I say! Old Montague is come,\nAnd flourishes his blade in spite of me.\n\nMONTAGUE:\nThou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.\n\nLADY MONTAGUE:\nThou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.\n\nPRINCE:\nRebellious subjects, enemies to peace,\nProfaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--\nWill they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,\nThat quench the fire of your pernicious rage\nWith purple fountains issuing from your veins,\nOn pain of torture, from those bloody hands\nThrow your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,\nAnd hear the sentence of your moved prince.\nThree civil brawls, bred of an airy word,\nBy thee, old Capulet, and Montague,\nHave thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,\nAnd made Verona's ancient citizens\nCast by their grave beseeming ornaments,\nTo wield old partisans, in hands as old,\nCanker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:\nIf ever you disturb our streets again,\nYour lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.\nFor this time, all the rest depart away:\nYou Capulet; shall go along with me:\nAnd, Montague, come you this afternoon,\nTo know our further pleasure in this case,\nTo old Free-town, our common judgment-place.\nOnce more, on pain of death, all men depart.\n\nMONTAGUE:\nWho set this ancient quarrel new abroach?\nSpeak, nephew, were you by when it began?\n\nBENVOLIO:\nHere were the servants of your adversary,\nAnd yours, close fighting ere I did approach:\nI drew to part them: in the instant came\nThe fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,\nWhich, as he breathed defiance to my ears,\nHe swung about his head and cut the winds,\nWho nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:\nWhile we were interchanging thrusts and blows,\nCame more and more and fought on part and part,\nTill the prince came, who parted either part.\n\nLADY MONTAGUE:\nO, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?\nRight glad I am he was not at this fray.\n\nBENVOLIO:\nMadam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun\nPeer'd forth the golden window of the east,\nA troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;\nWhere, underneath the grove of sycamore\nThat westward rooteth from the city's side,\nSo early walking did I see your son:\nTowards him I made, but he was ware of me\nAnd stole into the covert of the wood:\nI, measuring his affections by my own,\nThat most are busied when they're most alone,\nPursued my humour not pursuing his,\nAnd gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.\n\nMONTAGUE:\nMany a morning hath he there been seen,\nWith tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.\nAdding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;\nBut all so soon as the all-cheering sun\nShould in the furthest east begin to draw\nThe shady curtains from Aurora's bed,\nAway from the light steals home my heavy son,\nAnd private in his chamber pens himself,\nShuts up his windows, locks far daylight out\nAnd makes himself an artificial night:\nBlack and portentous must this humour prove,\nUnless good counsel may the cause remove.\n\nBENVOLIO:\nMy noble uncle, do you know the cause?\n\nMONTAGUE:\nI neither know it nor can learn of him.\n\nBENVOLIO:\nHave you importuned him by any means?\n\nMONTAGUE:\nBoth by myself and many other friends:\nBut he, his own affections' counsellor,\nIs to himself--I will not say how true--\nBut to himself so secret and so close,\nSo far from sounding and discovery,\nAs is the bud bit with an envious worm,\nEre he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,\nOr dedicate his beauty to the sun.\nCould we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.\nWe would as willingly give cure as know.\n\nBENVOLIO:\nSee, where he comes: so please you, step aside;\nI'll know his grievance, or be much denied.\n\nMONTAGUE:\nI would thou wert so happy by thy stay,\nTo hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.\n\nBENVOLIO:\nGood-morrow, cousin.\n\nROMEO:\nIs the day so young?\n\nBENVOLIO:\nBut new struck nine.\n\nROMEO:\nAy me! sad hours seem long.\nWas that my father that went hence so fast?\n\nBENVOLIO:\nIt was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?\n\nROMEO:\nNot having that, which, having, makes them short.\n\nBENVOLIO:\nIn love?\n\nROMEO:\nOut--\n\nBENVOLIO:\nOf love?\n\nROMEO:\nOut of her favour, where I am in love.\n\nBENVOLIO:\nAlas, that love, so gentle in his view,\nShould be so tyrannous and rough in proof!\n\nROMEO:\nAlas, that love, whose view is muffled still,\nShould, without eyes, see pathways to his will!\nWhere shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?\nYet tell me not, for I have heard it all.\nHere's much to do with hate, but more with love.\nWhy, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!\nO any thing, of nothing first create!\nO heavy lightness! serious vanity!\nMis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!\nFeather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,\nsick health!\nStill-waking sleep, that is not what it is!\nThis love feel I, that feel no love in this.\nDost thou not laugh?\n\nBENVOLIO:\nNo, coz, I rather weep.\n\nROMEO:\nGood heart, at what?\n\nBENVOLIO:\nAt thy good heart's oppression.\n\nROMEO:\nWhy, such is love's transgression.\nGriefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,\nWhich thou wilt propagate, to have it prest\nWith more of thine: this love that thou hast shown\nDoth add more grief to too much of mine own.\nLove is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;\nBeing purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;\nBeing vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:\nWhat is it else? a madness most discreet,\nA choking gall and a preserving sweet.\nFarewell, my coz.\n\nBENVOLIO:\nSoft! I will go along;\nAn if you leave me so, you do me wrong.\n\nROMEO:\nTut, I have lost myself; I am not here;\nThis is not Romeo, he's some other where.\n\nBENVOLIO:\nTell me in sadness, who is that you love.\n\nROMEO:\nWhat, shall I groan and tell thee?\n\nBENVOLIO:\nGroan! why, no.\nBut sadly tell me who.\n\nROMEO:\nBid a sick man in sadness make his will:\nAh, word ill urged to one that is so ill!\nIn sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.\n\nBENVOLIO:\nI aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.\n\nROMEO:\nA right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.\n\nBENVOLIO:\nA right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.\n\nROMEO:\nWell, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit\nWith Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;\nAnd, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,\nFrom love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.\nShe will not stay the siege of loving terms,\nNor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,\nNor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:\nO, she is rich in beauty, only poor,\nThat when she dies with beauty dies her store.\n\nBENVOLIO:\nThen she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?\n\nROMEO:\nShe hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,\nFor beauty starved with her severity\nCuts beauty off from all posterity.\nShe is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,\nTo merit bliss by making me despair:\nShe hath forsworn to love, and in that vow\nDo I live dead that live to tell it now.\n\nBENVOLIO:\nBe ruled by me, forget to think of her.\n\nROMEO:\nO, teach me how I should forget to think.\n\nBENVOLIO:\nBy giving liberty unto thine eyes;\nExamine other beauties.\n\nROMEO:\n'Tis the way\nTo call hers exquisite, in question more:\nThese happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows\nBeing black put us in mind they hide the fair;\nHe that is strucken blind cannot forget\nThe precious treasure of his eyesight lost:\nShow me a mistress that is passing fair,\nWhat doth her beauty serve, but as a note\nWhere I may read who pass'd that passing fair?\nFarewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.\n\nBENVOLIO:\nI'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.\n\nCAPULET:\nBut Montague is bound as well as I,\nIn penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,\nFor men so old as we to keep the peace.\n\nPARIS:\nOf honourable reckoning are you both;\nAnd pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.\nBut now, my lord, what say you to my suit?\n\nCAPULET:\nBut saying o'er what I have said before:\nMy child is yet a stranger in the world;\nShe hath not seen the change of fourteen years,\nLet two more summers wither in their pride,\nEre we may think her ripe to be a bride.\n\nPARIS:\nYounger than she are happy mothers made.\n\nCAPULET:\nAnd too soon marr'd are those so early made.\nThe earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,\nShe is the hopeful lady of my earth:\nBut woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,\nMy will to her consent is but a part;\nAn she agree, within her scope of choice\nLies my consent and fair according voice.\nThis night I hold an old accustom'd feast,\nWhereto I have invited many a guest,\nSuch as I love; and you, among the store,\nOne more, most welcome, makes my number more.\nAt my poor house look to behold this night\nEarth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:\nSuch comfort as do lusty young men feel\nWhen well-apparell'd April on the heel\nOf limping winter treads, even such delight\nAmong fresh female buds shall you this night\nInherit at my house; hear all, all see,\nAnd like her most whose merit most shall be:\nWhich on more view, of many mine being one\nMay stand in number, though in reckoning none,\nCome, go with me.\nGo, sirrah, trudge about\nThrough fair Verona; find those persons out\nWhose names are written there, and to them say,\nMy house and welcome on their pleasure stay.\n\nServant:\nFind them out whose names are written here! It is\nwritten, that the shoemaker should meddle with his\nyard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with\nhis pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am\nsent to find those persons whose names are here\nwrit, and can never find what names the writing\nperson hath here writ. I must to the learned.--In good time.\n\nBENVOLIO:\nTut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,\nOne pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;\nTurn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;\nOne desperate grief cures with another's languish:\nTake thou some new infection to thy eye,\nAnd the rank poison of the old will die.\n\nROMEO:\nYour plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.\n\nBENVOLIO:\nFor what, I pray thee?\n\nROMEO:\nFor your broken shin.\n\nBENVOLIO:\nWhy, Romeo, art thou mad?\n\nROMEO:\nNot mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;\nShut up in prison, kept without my food,\nWhipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fellow.\n\nServant:\nGod gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?\n\nROMEO:\nAy, mine own fortune in my misery.\n\nServant:\nPerhaps you have learned it without book: but, I\npray, can you read any thing you see?\n\nROMEO:\nAy, if I know the letters and the language.\n\nServant:\nYe say honestly: rest you merry!\n\nROMEO:\nStay, fellow; I can read.\n'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;\nCounty Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the lady\nwidow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and his lovely\nnieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mine\nuncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair niece\nRosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin\nTybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.' A fair\nassembly: whither should they come?\n\nServant:\nUp.\n\nROMEO:\nWhither?\n\nServant:\nTo supper; to our house.\n\nROMEO:\nWhose house?\n\nServant:\nMy master's.\n\nROMEO:\nIndeed, I should have ask'd you that before.\n\nServant:\nNow I'll tell you without asking: my master is the\ngreat rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house\nof Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine.\nRest you merry!\n\nBENVOLIO:\nAt this same ancient feast of Capulet's\nSups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest,\nWith all the admired beauties of Verona:\nGo thither; and, with unattainted eye,\nCompare her face with some that I shall show,\nAnd I will make thee think thy swan a crow.\n\nROMEO:\nWhen the devout religion of mine eye\nMaintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;\nAnd these, who often drown'd could never die,\nTransparent heretics, be burnt for liars!\nOne fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun\nNe'er saw her match since first the world begun.\n\nBENVOLIO:\nTut, you saw her fair, none else being by,\nHerself poised with herself in either eye:\nBut in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd\nYour lady's love against some other maid\nThat I will show you shining at this feast,\nAnd she shall scant show well that now shows best.\n\nROMEO:\nI'll go along, no such sight to be shown,\nBut to rejoice in splendor of mine own.\n\nLADY CAPULET:\nNurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.\n\nNurse:\nNow, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,\nI bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird!\nGod forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!\n\nJULIET:\nHow now! who calls?\n\nNurse:\nYour mother.\n\nJULIET:\nMadam, I am here.\nWhat is your will?\n\nLADY CAPULET:\nThis is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile,\nWe must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again;\nI have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.\nThou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.\n\nNurse:\nFaith, I can tell her age unto an hour.\n\nLADY CAPULET:\nShe's not fourteen.\n\nNurse:\nI'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--\nAnd yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four--\nShe is not fourteen. How long is it now\nTo Lammas-tide?\n\nLADY CAPULET:\nA fortnight and odd days.\n\nNurse:\nEven or odd, of all days in the year,\nCome Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.\nSusan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--\nWere of an age: well, Susan is with God;\nShe was too good for me: but, as I said,\nOn Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;\nThat shall she, marry; I remember it well.\n'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;\nAnd she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,--\nOf all the days of the year, upon that day:\nFor I had then laid wormwood to my dug,\nSitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;\nMy lord and you were then at Mantua:--\nNay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,\nWhen it did taste the wormwood on the nipple\nOf my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,\nTo see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!\nShake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,\nTo bid me trudge:\nAnd since that time it is eleven years;\nFor then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,\nShe could have run and waddled all about;\nFor even the day before, she broke her brow:\nAnd then my husband--God be with his soul!\nA' was a merry man--took up the child:\n'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?\nThou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;\nWilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,\nThe pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'\nTo see, now, how a jest shall come about!\nI warrant, an I should live a thousand years,\nI never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;\nAnd, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'\n\nLADY CAPULET:\nEnough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.\n\nNurse:\nYes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,\nTo think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'\nAnd yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow\nA bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;\nA parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:\n'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?\nThou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;\nWilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'\n\nJULIET:\nAnd stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.\n\nNurse:\nPeace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!\nThou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:\nAn I might live to see thee married once,\nI have my wish.\n\nLADY CAPULET:\nMarry, that 'marry' is the very theme\nI came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,\nHow stands your disposition to be married?\n\nJULIET:\nIt is an honour that I dream not of.\n\nNurse:\nAn honour! were not I thine only nurse,\nI would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.\n\nLADY CAPULET:\nWell, think of marriage now; younger than you,\nHere in Verona, ladies of esteem,\nAre made already mothers: by my count,\nI was your mother much upon these years\nThat you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:\nThe valiant Paris seeks you for his love.\n\nNurse:\nA man, young lady! lady, such a man\nAs all the world--why, he's a man of wax.\n\nLADY CAPULET:\nVerona's summer hath not such a flower.\n\nNurse:\nNay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.\n\nLADY CAPULET:\nWhat say you? can you love the gentleman?\nThis night you shall behold him at our feast;\nRead o'er the volume of young Paris' face,\nAnd find delight writ there with beauty's pen;\nExamine every married lineament,\nAnd see how one another lends content\nAnd what obscured in this fair volume lies\nFind written in the margent of his eyes.\nThis precious book of love, this unbound lover,\nTo beautify him, only lacks a cover:\nThe fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride\nFor fair without the fair within to hide:\nThat book in many's eyes doth share the glory,\nThat in gold clasps locks in the golden story;\nSo shall you share all that he doth possess,\nBy having him, making yourself no less.\n\nNurse:\nNo less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.\n\nLADY CAPULET:\nSpeak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?\n\nJULIET:\nI'll look to like, if looking liking move:\nBut no more deep will I endart mine eye\nThan your consent gives strength to make it fly.\n\nServant:\nMadam, the guests are come, supper served up, you\ncalled, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in\nthe pantry, and every thing in extremity. I must\nhence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight.\n\nLADY CAPULET:\nWe follow thee.\nJuliet, the county stays.\n\nNurse:\nGo, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.\n\nROMEO:\nWhat, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?\nOr shall we on without a apology?\n\nBENVOLIO:\nThe date is out of such prolixity:\nWe'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,\nBearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,\nScaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;\nNor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke\nAfter the prompter, for our entrance:\nBut let them measure us by what they will;\nWe'll measure them a measure, and be gone.\n\nROMEO:\nGive me a torch: I am not for this ambling;\nBeing but heavy, I will bear the light.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nNay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.\n\nROMEO:\nNot I, believe me: you have dancing shoes\nWith nimble soles: I have a soul of lead\nSo stakes me to the ground I cannot move.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nYou are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,\nAnd soar with them above a common bound.\n\nROMEO:\nI am too sore enpierced with his shaft\nTo soar with his light feathers, and so bound,\nI cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:\nUnder love's heavy burden do I sink.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nAnd, to sink in it, should you burden love;\nToo great oppression for a tender thing.\n\nROMEO:\nIs love a tender thing? it is too rough,\nToo rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nIf love be rough with you, be rough with love;\nPrick love for pricking, and you beat love down.\nGive me a case to put my visage in:\nA visor for a visor! what care I\nWhat curious eye doth quote deformities?\nHere are the beetle brows shall blush for me.\n\nBENVOLIO:\nCome, knock and enter; and no sooner in,\nBut every man betake him to his legs.\n\nROMEO:\nA torch for me: let wantons light of heart\nTickle the senseless rushes with their heels,\nFor I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;\nI'll be a candle-holder, and look on.\nThe game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nTut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:\nIf thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire\nOf this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st\nUp to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!\n\nROMEO:\nNay, that's not so.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nI mean, sir, in delay\nWe waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.\nTake our good meaning, for our judgment sits\nFive times in that ere once in our five wits.\n\nROMEO:\nAnd we mean well in going to this mask;\nBut 'tis no wit to go.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nWhy, may one ask?\n\nROMEO:\nI dream'd a dream to-night.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nAnd so did I.\n\nROMEO:\nWell, what was yours?\n\nMERCUTIO:\nThat dreamers often lie.\n\nROMEO:\nIn bed asleep, while they do dream things true.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nO, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.\nShe is the fairies' midwife, and she comes\nIn shape no bigger than an agate-stone\nOn the fore-finger of an alderman,\nDrawn with a team of little atomies\nAthwart men's noses as they lie asleep;\nHer wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,\nThe cover of the wings of grasshoppers,\nThe traces of the smallest spider's web,\nThe collars of the moonshine's watery beams,\nHer whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,\nHer wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,\nNot so big as a round little worm\nPrick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;\nHer chariot is an empty hazel-nut\nMade by the joiner squirrel or old grub,\nTime out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.\nAnd in this state she gallops night by night\nThrough lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;\nO'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,\nO'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,\nO'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,\nWhich oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,\nBecause their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:\nSometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,\nAnd then dreams he of smelling out a suit;\nAnd sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail\nTickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,\nThen dreams, he of another benefice:\nSometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,\nAnd then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,\nOf breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,\nOf healths five-fathom deep; and then anon\nDrums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,\nAnd being thus frighted swears a prayer or two\nAnd sleeps again. This is that very Mab\nThat plats the manes of horses in the night,\nAnd bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,\nWhich once untangled, much misfortune bodes:\nThis is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,\nThat presses them and learns them first to bear,\nMaking them women of good carriage:\nThis is she--\n\nROMEO:\nPeace, peace, Mercutio, peace!\nThou talk'st of nothing.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nTrue, I talk of dreams,\nWhich are the children of an idle brain,\nBegot of nothing but vain fantasy,\nWhich is as thin of substance as the air\nAnd more inconstant than the wind, who wooes\nEven now the frozen bosom of the north,\nAnd, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,\nTurning his face to the dew-dropping south.\n\nBENVOLIO:\nThis wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;\nSupper is done, and we shall come too late.\n\nROMEO:\nI fear, too early: for my mind misgives\nSome consequence yet hanging in the stars\nShall bitterly begin his fearful date\nWith this night's revels and expire the term\nOf a despised life closed in my breast\nBy some vile forfeit of untimely death.\nBut He, that hath the steerage of my course,\nDirect my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.\n\nBENVOLIO:\nStrike, drum.\n\nFirst Servant:\nWhere's Potpan, that he helps not to take away? He\nshift a trencher? he scrape a trencher!\n\nSecond Servant:\nWhen good manners shall lie all in one or two men's\nhands and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing.\n\nFirst Servant:\nAway with the joint-stools, remove the\ncourt-cupboard, look to the plate. Good thou, save\nme a piece of marchpane; and, as thou lovest me, let\nthe porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.\nAntony, and Potpan!\n\nSecond Servant:\nAy, boy, ready.\n\nFirst Servant:\nYou are looked for and called for, asked for and\nsought for, in the great chamber.\n\nSecond Servant:\nWe cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys; be\nbrisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.\n\nCAPULET:\nWelcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes\nUnplagued with corns will have a bout with you.\nAh ha, my mistresses! which of you all\nWill now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,\nShe, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?\nWelcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day\nThat I have worn a visor and could tell\nA whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,\nSuch as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:\nYou are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play.\nA hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.\nMore light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,\nAnd quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.\nAh, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.\nNay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet;\nFor you and I are past our dancing days:\nHow long is't now since last yourself and I\nWere in a mask?\n\nSecond Capulet:\nBy'r lady, thirty years.\n\nCAPULET:\nWhat, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much:\n'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio,\nCome pentecost as quickly as it will,\nSome five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.\n\nSecond Capulet:\n'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir;\nHis son is thirty.\n\nCAPULET:\nWill you tell me that?\nHis son was but a ward two years ago.\n\nROMEO:\n\nServant:\nI know not, sir.\n\nROMEO:\nO, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!\nIt seems she hangs upon the cheek of night\nLike a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;\nBeauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!\nSo shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,\nAs yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.\nThe measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,\nAnd, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.\nDid my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!\nFor I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.\n\nTYBALT:\nThis, by his voice, should be a Montague.\nFetch me my rapier, boy. What dares the slave\nCome hither, cover'd with an antic face,\nTo fleer and scorn at our solemnity?\nNow, by the stock and honour of my kin,\nTo strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.\n\nCAPULET:\nWhy, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?\n\nTYBALT:\nUncle, this is a Montague, our foe,\nA villain that is hither come in spite,\nTo scorn at our solemnity this night.\n\nCAPULET:\nYoung Romeo is it?\n\nTYBALT:\n'Tis he, that villain Romeo.\n\nCAPULET:\nContent thee, gentle coz, let him alone;\nHe bears him like a portly gentleman;\nAnd, to say truth, Verona brags of him\nTo be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:\nI would not for the wealth of all the town\nHere in my house do him disparagement:\nTherefore be patient, take no note of him:\nIt is my will, the which if thou respect,\nShow a fair presence and put off these frowns,\nAnd ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.\n\nTYBALT:\nIt fits, when such a villain is a guest:\nI'll not endure him.\n\nCAPULET:\nHe shall be endured:\nWhat, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;\nAm I the master here, or you? go to.\nYou'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!\nYou'll make a mutiny among my guests!\nYou will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!\n\nTYBALT:\nWhy, uncle, 'tis a shame.\n\nCAPULET:\nGo to, go to;\nYou are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?\nThis trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:\nYou must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.\nWell said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:\nBe quiet, or--More light, more light! For shame!\nI'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!\n\nTYBALT:\nPatience perforce with wilful choler meeting\nMakes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.\nI will withdraw: but this intrusion shall\nNow seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.\n\nROMEO:\n\nJULIET:\nGood pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,\nWhich mannerly devotion shows in this;\nFor saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,\nAnd palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.\n\nROMEO:\nHave not saints lips, and holy palmers too?\n\nJULIET:\nAy, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.\n\nROMEO:\nO, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;\nThey pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.\n\nJULIET:\nSaints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.\n\nROMEO:\nThen move not, while my prayer's effect I take.\nThus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.\n\nJULIET:\nThen have my lips the sin that they have took.\n\nROMEO:\nSin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!\nGive me my sin again.\n\nJULIET:\nYou kiss by the book.\n\nNurse:\nMadam, your mother craves a word with you.\n\nROMEO:\nWhat is her mother?\n\nNurse:\nMarry, bachelor,\nHer mother is the lady of the house,\nAnd a good lady, and a wise and virtuous\nI nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;\nI tell you, he that can lay hold of her\nShall have the chinks.\n\nROMEO:\nIs she a Capulet?\nO dear account! my life is my foe's debt.\n\nBENVOLIO:\nAway, begone; the sport is at the best.\n\nROMEO:\nAy, so I fear; the more is my unrest.\n\nCAPULET:\nNay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;\nWe have a trifling foolish banquet towards.\nIs it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all\nI thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.\nMore torches here! Come on then, let's to bed.\nAh, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late:\nI'll to my rest.\n\nJULIET:\nCome hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?\n\nNurse:\nThe son and heir of old Tiberio.\n\nJULIET:\nWhat's he that now is going out of door?\n\nNurse:\nMarry, that, I think, be young Petrucio.\n\nJULIET:\nWhat's he that follows there, that would not dance?\n\nNurse:\nI know not.\n\nJULIET:\nGo ask his name: if he be married.\nMy grave is like to be my wedding bed.\n\nNurse:\nHis name is Romeo, and a Montague;\nThe only son of your great enemy.\n\nJULIET:\nMy only love sprung from my only hate!\nToo early seen unknown, and known too late!\nProdigious birth of love it is to me,\nThat I must love a loathed enemy.\n\nNurse:\nWhat's this? what's this?\n\nJULIET:\nA rhyme I learn'd even now\nOf one I danced withal.\n\nNurse:\nAnon, anon!\nCome, let's away; the strangers all are gone.\n\nChorus:\nNow old desire doth in his death-bed lie,\nAnd young affection gapes to be his heir;\nThat fair for which love groan'd for and would die,\nWith tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.\nNow Romeo is beloved and loves again,\nAlike betwitched by the charm of looks,\nBut to his foe supposed he must complain,\nAnd she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:\nBeing held a foe, he may not have access\nTo breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;\nAnd she as much in love, her means much less\nTo meet her new-beloved any where:\nBut passion lends them power, time means, to meet\nTempering extremities with extreme sweet.\n\nROMEO:\nCan I go forward when my heart is here?\nTurn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.\n\nBENVOLIO:\nRomeo! my cousin Romeo!\n\nMERCUTIO:\nHe is wise;\nAnd, on my lie, hath stol'n him home to bed.\n\nBENVOLIO:\nHe ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:\nCall, good Mercutio.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nNay, I'll conjure too.\nRomeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!\nAppear thou in the likeness of a sigh:\nSpeak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;\nCry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;'\nSpeak to my gossip Venus one fair word,\nOne nick-name for her purblind son and heir,\nYoung Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,\nWhen King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid!\nHe heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;\nThe ape is dead, and I must conjure him.\nI conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,\nBy her high forehead and her scarlet lip,\nBy her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh\nAnd the demesnes that there adjacent lie,\nThat in thy likeness thou appear to us!\n\nBENVOLIO:\nAnd if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nThis cannot anger him: 'twould anger him\nTo raise a spirit in his mistress' circle\nOf some strange nature, letting it there stand\nTill she had laid it and conjured it down;\nThat were some spite: my invocation\nIs fair and honest, and in his mistress' name\nI conjure only but to raise up him.\n\nBENVOLIO:\nCome, he hath hid himself among these trees,\nTo be consorted with the humorous night:\nBlind is his love and best befits the dark.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nIf love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.\nNow will he sit under a medlar tree,\nAnd wish his mistress were that kind of fruit\nAs maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.\nRomeo, that she were, O, that she were\nAn open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!\nRomeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;\nThis field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:\nCome, shall we go?\n\nBENVOLIO:\nGo, then; for 'tis in vain\nTo seek him here that means not to be found.\n\nROMEO:\nHe jests at scars that never felt a wound.\nBut, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?\nIt is the east, and Juliet is the sun.\nArise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,\nWho is already sick and pale with grief,\nThat thou her maid art far more fair than she:\nBe not her maid, since she is envious;\nHer vestal livery is but sick and green\nAnd none but fools do wear it; cast it off.\nIt is my lady, O, it is my love!\nO, that she knew she were!\nShe speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?\nHer eye discourses; I will answer it.\nI am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:\nTwo of the fairest stars in all the heaven,\nHaving some business, do entreat her eyes\nTo twinkle in their spheres till they return.\nWhat if her eyes were there, they in her head?\nThe brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,\nAs daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven\nWould through the airy region stream so bright\nThat birds would sing and think it were not night.\nSee, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!\nO, that I were a glove upon that hand,\nThat I might touch that cheek!\n\nJULIET:\nAy me!\n\nROMEO:\nShe speaks:\nO, speak again, bright angel! for thou art\nAs glorious to this night, being o'er my head\nAs is a winged messenger of heaven\nUnto the white-upturned wondering eyes\nOf mortals that fall back to gaze on him\nWhen he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds\nAnd sails upon the bosom of the air.\n\nJULIET:\nO Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?\nDeny thy father and refuse thy name;\nOr, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,\nAnd I'll no longer be a Capulet.\n\nROMEO:\n\nJULIET:\n'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;\nThou art thyself, though not a Montague.\nWhat's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,\nNor arm, nor face, nor any other part\nBelonging to a man. O, be some other name!\nWhat's in a name? that which we call a rose\nBy any other name would smell as sweet;\nSo Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,\nRetain that dear perfection which he owes\nWithout that title. Romeo, doff thy name,\nAnd for that name which is no part of thee\nTake all myself.\n\nROMEO:\nI take thee at thy word:\nCall me but love, and I'll be new baptized;\nHenceforth I never will be Romeo.\n\nJULIET:\nWhat man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night\nSo stumblest on my counsel?\n\nROMEO:\nBy a name\nI know not how to tell thee who I am:\nMy name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,\nBecause it is an enemy to thee;\nHad I it written, I would tear the word.\n\nJULIET:\nMy ears have not yet drunk a hundred words\nOf that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:\nArt thou not Romeo and a Montague?\n\nROMEO:\nNeither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.\n\nJULIET:\nHow camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?\nThe orchard walls are high and hard to climb,\nAnd the place death, considering who thou art,\nIf any of my kinsmen find thee here.\n\nROMEO:\nWith love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;\nFor stony limits cannot hold love out,\nAnd what love can do that dares love attempt;\nTherefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.\n\nJULIET:\nIf they do see thee, they will murder thee.\n\nROMEO:\nAlack, there lies more peril in thine eye\nThan twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,\nAnd I am proof against their enmity.\n\nJULIET:\nI would not for the world they saw thee here.\n\nROMEO:\nI have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;\nAnd but thou love me, let them find me here:\nMy life were better ended by their hate,\nThan death prorogued, wanting of thy love.\n\nJULIET:\nBy whose direction found'st thou out this place?\n\nROMEO:\nBy love, who first did prompt me to inquire;\nHe lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.\nI am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far\nAs that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,\nI would adventure for such merchandise.\n\nJULIET:\nThou know'st the mask of night is on my face,\nElse would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek\nFor that which thou hast heard me speak to-night\nFain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny\nWhat I have spoke: but farewell compliment!\nDost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'\nAnd I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,\nThou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries\nThen say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,\nIf thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:\nOr if thou think'st I am too quickly won,\nI'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,\nSo thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.\nIn truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,\nAnd therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:\nBut trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true\nThan those that have more cunning to be strange.\nI should have been more strange, I must confess,\nBut that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,\nMy true love's passion: therefore pardon me,\nAnd not impute this yielding to light love,\nWhich the dark night hath so discovered.\n\nROMEO:\nLady, by yonder blessed moon I swear\nThat tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--\n\nJULIET:\nO, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,\nThat monthly changes in her circled orb,\nLest that thy love prove likewise variable.\n\nROMEO:\nWhat shall I swear by?\n\nJULIET:\nDo not swear at all;\nOr, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,\nWhich is the god of my idolatry,\nAnd I'll believe thee.\n\nROMEO:\nIf my heart's dear love--\n\nJULIET:\nWell, do not swear: although I joy in thee,\nI have no joy of this contract to-night:\nIt is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;\nToo like the lightning, which doth cease to be\nEre one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!\nThis bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,\nMay prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.\nGood night, good night! as sweet repose and rest\nCome to thy heart as that within my breast!\n\nROMEO:\nO, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?\n\nJULIET:\nWhat satisfaction canst thou have to-night?\n\nROMEO:\nThe exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.\n\nJULIET:\nI gave thee mine before thou didst request it:\nAnd yet I would it were to give again.\n\nROMEO:\nWouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?\n\nJULIET:\nBut to be frank, and give it thee again.\nAnd yet I wish but for the thing I have:\nMy bounty is as boundless as the sea,\nMy love as deep; the more I give to thee,\nThe more I have, for both are infinite.\nI hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!\nAnon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.\nStay but a little, I will come again.\n\nROMEO:\nO blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.\nBeing in night, all this is but a dream,\nToo flattering-sweet to be substantial.\n\nJULIET:\nThree words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.\nIf that thy bent of love be honourable,\nThy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,\nBy one that I'll procure to come to thee,\nWhere and what time thou wilt perform the rite;\nAnd all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay\nAnd follow thee my lord throughout the world.\n\nNurse:\n\nJULIET:\nI come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,\nI do beseech thee--\n\nNurse:\n\nJULIET:\nBy and by, I come:--\nTo cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:\nTo-morrow will I send.\n\nROMEO:\nSo thrive my soul--\n\nJULIET:\nA thousand times good night!\n\nROMEO:\nA thousand times the worse, to want thy light.\nLove goes toward love, as schoolboys from\ntheir books,\nBut love from love, toward school with heavy looks.\n\nJULIET:\nHist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,\nTo lure this tassel-gentle back again!\nBondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;\nElse would I tear the cave where Echo lies,\nAnd make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,\nWith repetition of my Romeo's name.\n\nROMEO:\nIt is my soul that calls upon my name:\nHow silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,\nLike softest music to attending ears!\n\nJULIET:\nRomeo!\n\nROMEO:\nMy dear?\n\nJULIET:\nAt what o'clock to-morrow\nShall I send to thee?\n\nROMEO:\nAt the hour of nine.\n\nJULIET:\nI will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.\nI have forgot why I did call thee back.\n\nROMEO:\nLet me stand here till thou remember it.\n\nJULIET:\nI shall forget, to have thee still stand there,\nRemembering how I love thy company.\n\nROMEO:\nAnd I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,\nForgetting any other home but this.\n\nJULIET:\n'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:\nAnd yet no further than a wanton's bird;\nWho lets it hop a little from her hand,\nLike a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,\nAnd with a silk thread plucks it back again,\nSo loving-jealous of his liberty.\n\nROMEO:\nI would I were thy bird.\n\nJULIET:\nSweet, so would I:\nYet I should kill thee with much cherishing.\nGood night, good night! parting is such\nsweet sorrow,\nThat I shall say good night till it be morrow.\n\nROMEO:\nSleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!\nWould I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!\nHence will I to my ghostly father's cell,\nHis help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.\n\nFRIAR LAURENCE:\nThe grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,\nChequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,\nAnd flecked darkness like a drunkard reels\nFrom forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:\nNow, ere the sun advance his burning eye,\nThe day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,\nI must up-fill this osier cage of ours\nWith baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.\nThe earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;\nWhat is her burying grave that is her womb,\nAnd from her womb children of divers kind\nWe sucking on her natural bosom find,\nMany for many virtues excellent,\nNone but for some and yet all different.\nO, mickle is the powerful grace that lies\nIn herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:\nFor nought so vile that on the earth doth live\nBut to the earth some special good doth give,\nNor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use\nRevolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:\nVirtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;\nAnd vice sometimes by action dignified.\nWithin the infant rind of this small flower\nPoison hath residence and medicine power:\nFor this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;\nBeing tasted, slays all senses with the heart.\nTwo such opposed kings encamp them still\nIn man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;\nAnd where the worser is predominant,\nFull soon the canker death eats up that plant.\n\nROMEO:\nGood morrow, father.\n\nFRIAR LAURENCE:\nBenedicite!\nWhat early tongue so sweet saluteth me?\nYoung son, it argues a distemper'd head\nSo soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:\nCare keeps his watch in every old man's eye,\nAnd where care lodges, sleep will never lie;\nBut where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain\nDoth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:\nTherefore thy earliness doth me assure\nThou art up-roused by some distemperature;\nOr if not so, then here I hit it right,\nOur Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.\n\nROMEO:\nThat last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.\n\nFRIAR LAURENCE:\nGod pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?\n\nROMEO:\nWith Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;\nI have forgot that name, and that name's woe.\n\nFRIAR LAURENCE:\nThat's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?\n\nROMEO:\nI'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.\nI have been feasting with mine enemy,\nWhere on a sudden one hath wounded me,\nThat's by me wounded: both our remedies\nWithin thy help and holy physic lies:\nI bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,\nMy intercession likewise steads my foe.\n\nFRIAR LAURENCE:\nBe plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;\nRiddling confession finds but riddling shrift.\n\nROMEO:\nThen plainly know my heart's dear love is set\nOn the fair daughter of rich Capulet:\nAs mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;\nAnd all combined, save what thou must combine\nBy holy marriage: when and where and how\nWe met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,\nI'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,\nThat thou consent to marry us to-day.\n\nFRIAR LAURENCE:\nHoly Saint Francis, what a change is here!\nIs Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,\nSo soon forsaken? young men's love then lies\nNot truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.\nJesu Maria, what a deal of brine\nHath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!\nHow much salt water thrown away in waste,\nTo season love, that of it doth not taste!\nThe sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,\nThy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;\nLo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit\nOf an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:\nIf e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,\nThou and these woes were all for Rosaline:\nAnd art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,\nWomen may fall, when there's no strength in men.\n\nROMEO:\nThou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.\n\nFRIAR LAURENCE:\nFor doting, not for loving, pupil mine.\n\nROMEO:\nAnd bad'st me bury love.\n\nFRIAR LAURENCE:\nNot in a grave,\nTo lay one in, another out to have.\n\nROMEO:\nI pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now\nDoth grace for grace and love for love allow;\nThe other did not so.\n\nFRIAR LAURENCE:\nO, she knew well\nThy love did read by rote and could not spell.\nBut come, young waverer, come, go with me,\nIn one respect I'll thy assistant be;\nFor this alliance may so happy prove,\nTo turn your households' rancour to pure love.\n\nROMEO:\nO, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.\n\nFRIAR LAURENCE:\nWisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nWhere the devil should this Romeo be?\nCame he not home to-night?\n\nBENVOLIO:\nNot to his father's; I spoke with his man.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nAh, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline.\nTorments him so, that he will sure run mad.\n\nBENVOLIO:\nTybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,\nHath sent a letter to his father's house.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nA challenge, on my life.\n\nBENVOLIO:\nRomeo will answer it.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nAny man that can write may answer a letter.\n\nBENVOLIO:\nNay, he will answer the letter's master, how he\ndares, being dared.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nAlas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a\nwhite wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a\nlove-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the\nblind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to\nencounter Tybalt?\n\nBENVOLIO:\nWhy, what is Tybalt?\n\nMERCUTIO:\nMore than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is\nthe courageous captain of compliments. He fights as\nyou sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and\nproportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and\nthe third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk\nbutton, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the\nvery first house, of the first and second cause:\nah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the\nhai!\n\nBENVOLIO:\nThe what?\n\nMERCUTIO:\nThe pox of such antic, lisping, affecting\nfantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,\na very good blade! a very tall man! a very good\nwhore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,\ngrandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with\nthese strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these\nperdona-mi's, who stand so much on the new form,\nthat they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their\nbones, their bones!\n\nBENVOLIO:\nHere comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nWithout his roe, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh,\nhow art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers\nthat Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a\nkitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to\nbe-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy;\nHelen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe a grey\neye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior\nRomeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation\nto your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit\nfairly last night.\n\nROMEO:\nGood morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?\n\nMERCUTIO:\nThe ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?\n\nROMEO:\nPardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in\nsuch a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nThat's as much as to say, such a case as yours\nconstrains a man to bow in the hams.\n\nROMEO:\nMeaning, to court'sy.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nThou hast most kindly hit it.\n\nROMEO:\nA most courteous exposition.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nNay, I am the very pink of courtesy.\n\nROMEO:\nPink for flower.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nRight.\n\nROMEO:\nWhy, then is my pump well flowered.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nWell said: follow me this jest now till thou hast\nworn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it\nis worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular.\n\nROMEO:\nO single-soled jest, solely singular for the\nsingleness.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nCome between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.\n\nROMEO:\nSwitch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nNay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have\ndone, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of\nthy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five:\nwas I with you there for the goose?\n\nROMEO:\nThou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast\nnot there for the goose.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nI will bite thee by the ear for that jest.\n\nROMEO:\nNay, good goose, bite not.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nThy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most\nsharp sauce.\n\nROMEO:\nAnd is it not well served in to a sweet goose?\n\nMERCUTIO:\nO here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an\ninch narrow to an ell broad!\n\nROMEO:\nI stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added\nto the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nWhy, is not this better now than groaning for love?\nnow art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art\nthou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:\nfor this drivelling love is like a great natural,\nthat runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.\n\nBENVOLIO:\nStop there, stop there.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nThou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.\n\nBENVOLIO:\nThou wouldst else have made thy tale large.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nO, thou art deceived; I would have made it short:\nfor I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and\nmeant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer.\n\nROMEO:\nHere's goodly gear!\n\nMERCUTIO:\nA sail, a sail!\n\nBENVOLIO:\nTwo, two; a shirt and a smock.\n\nNurse:\nPeter!\n\nPETER:\nAnon!\n\nNurse:\nMy fan, Peter.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nGood Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the\nfairer face.\n\nNurse:\nGod ye good morrow, gentlemen.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nGod ye good den, fair gentlewoman.\n\nNurse:\nIs it good den?\n\nMERCUTIO:\n'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the\ndial is now upon the prick of noon.\n\nNurse:\nOut upon you! what a man are you!\n\nROMEO:\nOne, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to\nmar.\n\nNurse:\nBy my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,'\nquoth a'? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I\nmay find the young Romeo?\n\nROMEO:\nI can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when\nyou have found him than he was when you sought him:\nI am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.\n\nNurse:\nYou say well.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nYea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith;\nwisely, wisely.\n\nNurse:\nif you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with\nyou.\n\nBENVOLIO:\nShe will indite him to some supper.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nA bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!\n\nROMEO:\nWhat hast thou found?\n\nMERCUTIO:\nNo hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie,\nthat is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.\nAn old hare hoar,\nAnd an old hare hoar,\nIs very good meat in lent\nBut a hare that is hoar\nIs too much for a score,\nWhen it hoars ere it be spent.\nRomeo, will you come to your father's? we'll\nto dinner, thither.\n\nROMEO:\nI will follow you.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nFarewell, ancient lady; farewell,\n'lady, lady, lady.'\n\nNurse:\nMarry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy\nmerchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?\n\nROMEO:\nA gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk,\nand will speak more in a minute than he will stand\nto in a month.\n\nNurse:\nAn a' speak any thing against me, I'll take him\ndown, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such\nJacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall.\nScurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am\nnone of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by\ntoo, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?\n\nPETER:\nI saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, my weapon\nshould quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare\ndraw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a\ngood quarrel, and the law on my side.\n\nNurse:\nNow, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about\nme quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word:\nand as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you\nout; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself:\nbut first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into\na fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross\nkind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman\nis young; and, therefore, if you should deal double\nwith her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered\nto any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.\n\nROMEO:\nNurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I\nprotest unto thee--\n\nNurse:\nGood heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as much:\nLord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.\n\nROMEO:\nWhat wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.\n\nNurse:\nI will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as\nI take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.\n\nROMEO:\nBid her devise\nSome means to come to shrift this afternoon;\nAnd there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell\nBe shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.\n\nNurse:\nNo truly sir; not a penny.\n\nROMEO:\nGo to; I say you shall.\n\nNurse:\nThis afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.\n\nROMEO:\nAnd stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:\nWithin this hour my man shall be with thee\nAnd bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;\nWhich to the high top-gallant of my joy\nMust be my convoy in the secret night.\nFarewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:\nFarewell; commend me to thy mistress.\n\nNurse:\nNow God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.\n\nROMEO:\nWhat say'st thou, my dear nurse?\n\nNurse:\nIs your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,\nTwo may keep counsel, putting one away?\n\nROMEO:\nI warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.\n\nNURSE:\nWell, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord,\nLord! when 'twas a little prating thing:--O, there\nis a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain\nlay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief\nsee a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her\nsometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer\nman; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks\nas pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not\nrosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?\n\nROMEO:\nAy, nurse; what of that? both with an R.\n\nNurse:\nAh. mocker! that's the dog's name; R is for\nthe--No; I know it begins with some other\nletter:--and she hath the prettiest sententious of\nit, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good\nto hear it.\n\nROMEO:\nCommend me to thy lady.\n\nNurse:\nAy, a thousand times.\nPeter!\n\nPETER:\nAnon!\n\nNurse:\nPeter, take my fan, and go before and apace.\n\nJULIET:\nThe clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;\nIn half an hour she promised to return.\nPerchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.\nO, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,\nWhich ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,\nDriving back shadows over louring hills:\nTherefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,\nAnd therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.\nNow is the sun upon the highmost hill\nOf this day's journey, and from nine till twelve\nIs three long hours, yet she is not come.\nHad she affections and warm youthful blood,\nShe would be as swift in motion as a ball;\nMy words would bandy her to my sweet love,\nAnd his to me:\nBut old folks, many feign as they were dead;\nUnwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.\nO God, she comes!\nO honey nurse, what news?\nHast thou met with him? Send thy man away.\n\nNurse:\nPeter, stay at the gate.\n\nJULIET:\nNow, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?\nThough news be sad, yet tell them merrily;\nIf good, thou shamest the music of sweet news\nBy playing it to me with so sour a face.\n\nNurse:\nI am a-weary, give me leave awhile:\nFie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!\n\nJULIET:\nI would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:\nNay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak.\n\nNurse:\nJesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?\nDo you not see that I am out of breath?\n\nJULIET:\nHow art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath\nTo say to me that thou art out of breath?\nThe excuse that thou dost make in this delay\nIs longer than the tale thou dost excuse.\nIs thy news good, or bad? answer to that;\nSay either, and I'll stay the circumstance:\nLet me be satisfied, is't good or bad?\n\nNurse:\nWell, you have made a simple choice; you know not\nhow to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his\nface be better than any man's, yet his leg excels\nall men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,\nthough they be not to be talked on, yet they are\npast compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,\nbut, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy\nways, wench; serve God. What, have you dined at home?\n\nJULIET:\nNo, no: but all this did I know before.\nWhat says he of our marriage? what of that?\n\nNurse:\nLord, how my head aches! what a head have I!\nIt beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.\nMy back o' t' other side,--O, my back, my back!\nBeshrew your heart for sending me about,\nTo catch my death with jaunting up and down!\n\nJULIET:\nI' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.\nSweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?\n\nNurse:\nYour love says, like an honest gentleman, and a\ncourteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I\nwarrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?\n\nJULIET:\nWhere is my mother! why, she is within;\nWhere should she be? How oddly thou repliest!\n'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,\nWhere is your mother?'\n\nNurse:\nO God's lady dear!\nAre you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;\nIs this the poultice for my aching bones?\nHenceforward do your messages yourself.\n\nJULIET:\nHere's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?\n\nNurse:\nHave you got leave to go to shrift to-day?\n\nJULIET:\nI have.\n\nNurse:\nThen hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;\nThere stays a husband to make you a wife:\nNow comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,\nThey'll be in scarlet straight at any news.\nHie you to church; I must another way,\nTo fetch a ladder, by the which your love\nMust climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:\nI am the drudge and toil in your delight,\nBut you shall bear the burden soon at night.\nGo; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell.\n\nJULIET:\nHie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.\n\nFRIAR LAURENCE:\nSo smile the heavens upon this holy act,\nThat after hours with sorrow chide us not!\n\nROMEO:\nAmen, amen! but come what sorrow can,\nIt cannot countervail the exchange of joy\nThat one short minute gives me in her sight:\nDo thou but close our hands with holy words,\nThen love-devouring death do what he dare;\nIt is enough I may but call her mine.\n\nFRIAR LAURENCE:\nThese violent delights have violent ends\nAnd in their triumph die, like fire and powder,\nWhich as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey\nIs loathsome in his own deliciousness\nAnd in the taste confounds the appetite:\nTherefore love moderately; long love doth so;\nToo swift arrives as tardy as too slow.\nHere comes the lady: O, so light a foot\nWill ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:\nA lover may bestride the gossamer\nThat idles in the wanton summer air,\nAnd yet not fall; so light is vanity.\n\nJULIET:\nGood even to my ghostly confessor.\n\nFRIAR LAURENCE:\nRomeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.\n\nJULIET:\nAs much to him, else is his thanks too much.\n\nROMEO:\nAh, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy\nBe heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more\nTo blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath\nThis neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue\nUnfold the imagined happiness that both\nReceive in either by this dear encounter.\n\nJULIET:\nConceit, more rich in matter than in words,\nBrags of his substance, not of ornament:\nThey are but beggars that can count their worth;\nBut my true love is grown to such excess\nI cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.\n\nFRIAR LAURENCE:\nCome, come with me, and we will make short work;\nFor, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone\nTill holy church incorporate two in one.\n\nBENVOLIO:\nI pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:\nThe day is hot, the Capulets abroad,\nAnd, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;\nFor now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nThou art like one of those fellows that when he\nenters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword\nupon the table and says 'God send me no need of\nthee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws\nit on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.\n\nBENVOLIO:\nAm I like such a fellow?\n\nMERCUTIO:\nCome, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as\nany in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as\nsoon moody to be moved.\n\nBENVOLIO:\nAnd what to?\n\nMERCUTIO:\nNay, an there were two such, we should have none\nshortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,\nthou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,\nor a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou\nwilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no\nother reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what\neye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?\nThy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of\nmeat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as\nan egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a\nman for coughing in the street, because he hath\nwakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:\ndidst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing\nhis new doublet before Easter? with another, for\ntying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou\nwilt tutor me from quarrelling!\n\nBENVOLIO:\nAn I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man\nshould buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nThe fee-simple! O simple!\n\nBENVOLIO:\nBy my head, here come the Capulets.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nBy my heel, I care not.\n\nTYBALT:\nFollow me close, for I will speak to them.\nGentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nAnd but one word with one of us? couple it with\nsomething; make it a word and a blow.\n\nTYBALT:\nYou shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you\nwill give me occasion.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nCould you not take some occasion without giving?\n\nTYBALT:\nMercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,--\n\nMERCUTIO:\nConsort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an\nthou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but\ndiscords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall\nmake you dance. 'Zounds, consort!\n\nBENVOLIO:\nWe talk here in the public haunt of men:\nEither withdraw unto some private place,\nAnd reason coldly of your grievances,\nOr else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nMen's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;\nI will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.\n\nTYBALT:\nWell, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nBut I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:\nMarry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;\nYour worship in that sense may call him 'man.'\n\nTYBALT:\nRomeo, the hate I bear thee can afford\nNo better term than this,--thou art a villain.\n\nROMEO:\nTybalt, the reason that I have to love thee\nDoth much excuse the appertaining rage\nTo such a greeting: villain am I none;\nTherefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.\n\nTYBALT:\nBoy, this shall not excuse the injuries\nThat thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.\n\nROMEO:\nI do protest, I never injured thee,\nBut love thee better than thou canst devise,\nTill thou shalt know the reason of my love:\nAnd so, good Capulet,--which name I tender\nAs dearly as my own,--be satisfied.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nO calm, dishonourable, vile submission!\nAlla stoccata carries it away.\nTybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?\n\nTYBALT:\nWhat wouldst thou have with me?\n\nMERCUTIO:\nGood king of cats, nothing but one of your nine\nlives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you\nshall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the\neight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher\nby the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your\nears ere it be out.\n\nTYBALT:\nI am for you.\n\nROMEO:\nGentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nCome, sir, your passado.\n\nROMEO:\nDraw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.\nGentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!\nTybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath\nForbidden bandying in Verona streets:\nHold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!\n\nMERCUTIO:\nI am hurt.\nA plague o' both your houses! I am sped.\nIs he gone, and hath nothing?\n\nBENVOLIO:\nWhat, art thou hurt?\n\nMERCUTIO:\nAy, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.\nWhere is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.\n\nROMEO:\nCourage, man; the hurt cannot be much.\n\nMERCUTIO:\nNo, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a\nchurch-door; but 'tis enough,'twill serve: ask for\nme to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I\nam peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o'\nboth your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a\ncat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a\nrogue, a villain, that fights by the book of\narithmetic! Why the devil came you between us?
