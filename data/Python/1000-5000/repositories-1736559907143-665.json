We are happy to help. Before you ask your question, please check if your\nquestion can be answered from the following 5 steps:\n- [ ] The [project documentation examples](https://websocket-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html)\n- [ ] The [project documentation FAQ](https://websocket-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html)\n- [ ] Search for your question in [old existing issues](https://github.com/websocket-client/websocket-client/issues)\n- [ ] If you encountered an error message, try googling the error message and see if you find an answer\n- [ ] Check if the same issue exists if you uninstall the websocket-client\nlibrary on your system (using `pip uninstall websocket-client`) and install the\n[latest master branch](https://github.com/websocket-client/websocket-client)\ndirectly from a clone of the repository by using `pip install -e .`\n(see [installation info](https://github.com/websocket-client/websocket-client#installation))\n\nIf you did not get your question answered from these 5 steps, then please open a\nnew issue and ask your question! When you explain your problem, please:\n- [ ] [Enable the tracing feature](https://websocket-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html#debug-and-logging-options)\nand include the entire debug trace of your connection process in the issue\n- [ ] Provide a [minimum reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example)\nprogram to allow other users to recreate and demonstrate the error\n- [ ] Add an explanation for what you are trying to accomplish. If you can\nprovide your code (or example code) in the issue, this helps a lot!\n\n## I have a suggestion or idea\n\nGreat! Please make a new issue an explain your idea, but first do a quick search\nin [old existing issues](https://github.com/websocket-client/websocket-client/issues)\nto see if someone already proposed the same idea.\n\n## I want to contribute code\n\nGreat! In your pull request (PR), please explain:\n1. What is the problem with the current code\n2. How your changes make it better\n3. Provide some example code that can allow someone else to recreate the\nproblem with the current code and test your solution (if possible to recreate).\n\n## I want to contribute documentation\n\nGreat! To edit the [project documentation](https://websocket-client.readthedocs.io),\nit is recommended that you install Sphinx and build the updated documentation\nlocally before submitting your edits. The Sphinx dependencies can be\ninstalled with `pip install websocket-client[docs]`. To build a new version of the documentation,\nchange directories (or `cd`) to the `docs/` directory and run `make clean html`.\nAny build warnings or errors will be displayed in your terminal, and the new\ndocumentation will then be available in the `docs/build/html/` directory.\nYou may also find the\n[Sphinx documentation style guide](https://documentation-style-guide-sphinx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/style-guide.html)\nuseful when editing reStructuredText (reST), which is quite\ndifferent from Markdown.\n"

It provides access\nto low level APIs for WebSockets. websocket-client implements version\n[hybi-13](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-hybi-thewebsocketprotocol-13)\nof the WebSocket protocol. This client does not currently support the\npermessage-deflate extension from\n[RFC 7692](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7692).\n\n## Documentation\n\nThis project's documentation can be found at\n[https://websocket-client.readthedocs.io/](https://websocket-client.readthedocs.io/)\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease see the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/websocket-client/websocket-client/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can use `pip install websocket-client` to install, or `pip install -e .`\nto install from a local copy of the code. This module is tested on Python 3.9+.\n\nThere are several optional dependencies that can be installed to enable\nspecific websocket-client features.\n- To install `python-socks` for proxy usage and `wsaccel` for a minor performance boost, use:\n `pip install websocket-client[optional]`\n- To install `websockets` to run unit tests using the local echo server, use:\n `pip install websocket-client[test]`\n- To install `Sphinx` and `sphinx_rtd_theme` to build project documentation, use:\n `pip install websocket-client[docs]`\n\nWhile not a strict dependency, [rel](https://github.com/bubbleboy14/registeredeventlistener)\nis useful when using `run_forever` with automatic reconnect. Install rel with `pip install rel`.\n\nFootnote: Some shells, such as zsh, require you to escape the `[` and `]` characters with a `\\`.\n\n## Usage Tips\n\nCheck out the documentation's FAQ for additional guidelines:\n[https://websocket-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html](https://websocket-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html)\n\nKnown issues with this library include lack of WebSocket Compression\nsupport (RFC 7692) and [minimal threading documentation/support](https://websocket-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/threading.html).\n\n## Performance\n\nThe `send` and `validate_utf8` methods can sometimes be bottleneck.\nYou can disable UTF8 validation in this library (and receive a\nperformance enhancement) with the `skip_utf8_validation` parameter.\nIf you want to get better performance, install wsaccel. While\nwebsocket-client does not depend on wsaccel, it will be used if\navailable. wsaccel doubles the speed of UTF8 validation and\noffers a very minor 10% performance boost when masking the\npayload data as part of the `send` process. Numpy used to\nbe a suggested performance enhancement alternative, but\n[issue #687](https://github.com/websocket-client/websocket-client/issues/687)\nfound it didn't help.\n\n## Examples\n\nMany more examples are found in the\n[examples documentation](https://websocket-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html).\n\n### Long-lived Connection\n\nMost real-world WebSockets situations involve longer-lived connections.\nThe WebSocketApp `run_forever` loop will automatically try to reconnect\nto an open WebSocket connection when a network\nconnection is lost if it is provided with:\n\n- a `dispatcher` argument (async dispatcher like rel or pyevent)\n- a non-zero `reconnect` argument (delay between disconnection and attempted reconnection)\n\n`run_forever` provides a variety of event-based connection controls\nusing callbacks like `on_message` and `on_error`.\n`run_forever` **does not automatically reconnect** if the server\ncloses the WebSocket gracefully (returning\n[a standard websocket close code](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455.html#section-7.4.1)).\n[This is the logic](https://github.com/websocket-client/websocket-client/pull/838#issuecomment-1228454826) behind the decision.\nCustomizing behavior when the server closes\nthe WebSocket should be handled in the `on_close` callback.\nThis example uses [rel](https://github.com/bubbleboy14/registeredeventlistener)\nfor the dispatcher to provide automatic reconnection.\n\n```python\nimport websocket\nimport _thread\nimport time\nimport rel\n\ndef on_message(ws, message):\n    print(message)\n\ndef on_error(ws, error):\n    print(error)\n\ndef on_close(ws, close_status_code, close_msg):\n    print(\"### closed ###\")\n\ndef on_open(ws):\n    print(\"Opened connection\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    websocket.enableTrace(True)\n    ws = websocket.WebSocketApp(\"wss://api.gemini.com/v1/marketdata/BTCUSD\",\n                              on_open=on_open,\n                              on_message=on_message,\n                              on_error=on_error,\n                              on_close=on_close)\n\n    ws.run_forever(dispatcher=rel, reconnect=5)  # Set dispatcher to automatic reconnection, 5 second reconnect delay if connection closed unexpectedly\n    rel.signal(2, rel.abort)  # Keyboard Interrupt\n    rel.dispatch()\n```\n\n### Short-lived Connection\n\nThis is if you want to communicate a short message and disconnect\nimmediately when done. For example, if you want to confirm that a WebSocket\nserver is running and responds properly to a specific request.\n\n```python\nfrom websocket import create_connection\n\nws = create_connection(\"ws://echo.websocket.events/\")\nprint(ws.recv())\nprint(\"Sending 'Hello, World'...\")\nws.send(\"Hello, World\")\nprint(\"Sent\")\nprint(\"Receiving...\")\nresult =  ws.recv()\nprint(\"Received '%s'\" % result)\nws.close()\n```\n"
