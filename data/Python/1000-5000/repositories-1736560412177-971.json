This is handy when developing tkinter applications.\n* ENHANCEMENT: Tab can be used as alternative code-completion shortcut.\n* ENHANCEMENT: Recommended pip-command now appears faster in System Shell.\n* ENHANCEMENT: Alternative interpreter doesn't need to have jedi installed in order to provide code-completions (see #171: Code auto-complete error)\n* ENHANCEMENT: Double-click on autocomplete list inserts the completion\n* EXPERIMENTAL: Ctrl-click on a name in code tries to locate its definition. NB! Not finished yet!\n* CHANGED: Bundled Python version has been upgraded to 3.6.1\n* CHANGED: Bundled Python in Mac and Linux now uses SSL certs from certifi project (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/certifi).\n* REMOVED: Moved incomplete Exercise system to a separate plugin (https://bitbucket.org/plas/thonny-exersys). With this got rid of tkinterhtml, requests and beautifulsoup4 dependencies.\n* FIXED #16: Run doesn't clear variables (again?)\n* FIXED #98: Nested functions crashed the debugger.\n* FIXED #114: Crash when trying to change interpreter in macOS.\n* FIXED #142: \"Open system shell\" failed when Thonny path had spaces in it. Paths are now properly quoted.\n* FIXED #154: Problems with Notebook tabs' context menus\n* FIXED #159: Debugging list or set comprehension caused crash\n* FIXED #166: Can't delete one of two spaces with backspace\n* FIXED #180: Right-click doesn't focus editor\n* FIXED #187: Main modules launched by Thonny were missing ``__spec__`` attribute.\n* FIXED #195: Debugger crashes when using generators.\n* FIXED #201: \"Tools => Open Thonny data folder\" now works also in macOS.\n* FIXED #211: Linux installer was failing when using ``xdg-user-dir`` (thanks to Ryan McQuen)\n* FIXED #213: In single instance mode new Window doesn't get focus\n* FIXED #217: Debugger on Python 3.5 and later can't handle splat operator \n* FIXED #221: Context menus in Linux can now be closed by clicking elsewhere\n* FIXED: Event logger did not save filenames (eb34c5d).\n* FIXED: Problem in replayer (db78855).\n* TECHNICAL: Bundled Jedi version has been upgraded to 0.10.2.\n* TECHNICAL: 3rd party Thonny plugins must now be under ``thonnycontrib`` namespace package.\n* TECHNICAL: Introduced the concept of \"eary plugins\" (plugins, which get loaded before initializing the runner).\n* TECHNICAL: Refactored the interface between GUI and backend to allow different backend implementations\n* TECHNICAL: Previously, with bundled Python, Thonny was using nasty tricks to force pip install packages install under ~/.thonny. Now it creates a proper virtual environment under ~/.thonny and uses this as the backend by default (instead of using interpreter running the GUI directly).\n* TECHNICAL: Automatic tkinter updates on the backend are now less invasive\n\n2.0.7 (2017-01-06)\n==================\n* FIXED: Making font size too small would crash Thonny.\n* FIXED: Another take on configuration file corruption. \n* FIXED: Shift-Tab wasn’t working in some cases.\n* FIXED #165: \"Open system shell\" did not add Scripts dir to PATH in Windows. \n* FIXED #183: ``from __future__ import`` crashed the debugger.\n\n2.0.6 (2017-01-06)\n==================\n* FIXED: a bug in Linux installer (configuration file wasn’t created in new installations)\n\n2.0.5 (2016-11-30)\n==================\n* FIXED: Corrected shift key detection (a82bd4d)\n\n2.0.4 (2016-10-26)\n==================\n* FIXED: Configuration file was occasionally getting corrupted (for mysterious reasons, maybe a bug in Python’s configparser)\n* FIXED #104: Negative font size crashed Thonny\n* FIXED #143: Linux installer fails if desktop isn't named \"Desktop\". (Later turned out this wasn't fixed for all cases).\n* FIXED #134: \"Open system shell\" doesn't work in Centos 7 KDE \n\n2.0.3 (2016-09-30)\n==================\n* FIXED: Quoting in \"Open system shell\" in Mac. Again. \n\n2.0.2 (2016-09-30)\n==================\n* FIXED: Quoting in \"Open system shell\" in Mac. \n\n2.0.1 (2016-09-30)\n==================\n* FIXED #106: Don't let user logs grow too big\n\n2.0.0 (2016-09-29)\n==================\n* NEW: Added code completion (powered by Jedi: https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi)\n* NEW: Added new command \"Tools => Open system shell\" which opens terminal where current Python is in PATH.\n* CHANGED: Single instance mode is now optional (Tools => Options => General)\n* FIXED: Many bugs\n\n1.2.0b2 (2016-02-10)\n====================\n* NEW: Thonny now runs in single instance mode. Previously, when you opened a py file with Thonny, a new Thonny instance (window) was created even if an instance existed already. This became nuisance if you opened several files. Now Thonny works as single instance program, meaning only one instance of Thonny runs at the time. When you open another file, it is opened in existing window.\n* NEW: Editor enhancements. Added option to show line numbers and right margin in the editor. In order to keep first impression cleaner, they are disabled by default. See Tools => Options => Editor. Don't forget that you don't need line numbers for locating lines mentioned in error messages -- you can click them and Thonny shows you the line.\n* FIXED: Some bugs where Thonny couldn't prepare some programs for debugging.\n\nOlder versions\n==============\nSee https://github.com/thonny/thonny/issues and https://github.com/thonny/thonny/commits  \n"

It also has some nice technical properties, that made Thonny's program animation features pleasure to implement.\n\nLibraries, resources and tools\n------------------------------\n* asttokens (https://github.com/gristlabs/asttokens) provides source locations to AST nodes.\n* basedpyright (https://docs.basedpyright.com/latest/) is used for code completion, go to definition, diagnostics etc.\n* pylint (https://www.pylint.org/) is used as one of the engines behind warnings presented by the Assistant.\n* mypy (http://mypy-lang.org/) is used, just like pylint, as a warning engine in the Assistant.\n* pyserial (https://github.com/pyserial/pyserial) is used for communicating with MicroPython devices.\n* docutils (http://docutils.sourceforge.net/) is used for parsing help content written in reStructuredText.\n* send2trash (https://github.com/hsoft/send2trash) is used by the Files view.\n* certifi (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/certifi) provides SSL certs for bundled Python in Linux and Mac.\n* distro (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/distro) is optionally used for detecting Linux version in About dialog.\n* paramiko (https://pypi.org/project/paramiko) is optionally used for writing and running code on remote machines.\n* websockets (https://pypi.org/project/websockets) is optionally used for communicating with MicroPython devices over WebREPL.\n* Most icons are taken from Eclipse project (https://www.eclipse.org/, https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.platform.debug/tree/master/org.eclipse.debug.ui/icons/full/, https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.platform.ui/tree/master/bundles/org.eclipse.ui/icons/full/, https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.jdt.ui/tree/master/org.eclipse.jdt.ui/icons/full/), on Linux, some are overridden by Tango icons (http://tango.freedesktop.org/)\n* POEditor (https://poeditor.com/) is used for managing translations of UI strings.\n* https://github.com/hlovatt/PyBoardTypeshed\n\nSource contributors, sponsors, advisors, translators and frequent bug-reporters\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n* adzierzanowski\n* Aivar Annamaa\n* Albin\n* Alar Leemet\n* Aleks ANDRÉ\n* Alex Hall\n* Alexandre Barrozo do Amaral Villares\n* Algent Albrahimi\n* Anatoly Techtonik\n* Anders Pamdal\n* Andrea Ferrari\n* Andrew Scheller\n* André Roberge\n* Andy Piper\n* Ankith\n* Antonio Carlos\n* atesin\n* athompson673\n* Augene J.
