This server will select one proxy updated recently from the\ndatabase and it will be used for forward proxy. Whenever an HTTP request\ncomes, the proxy server will select a proxy randomly.\n\nNote: HTTPS requests are not supported at present.\n\nThe example for `curl` using this proxy server is shown below:\n\n```bash\ncurl http://api.ipify.org -x http://127.0.0.1:8081\n```\n\nYou could also use this feature with [requests][]:\n\n```python\nrequests.get('http://api.ipify.org', proxies={'http': 'http://127.0.0.1:8081'})\n```\n\n### Web UI\n\nOpen `http://localhost:8899` in your browser to see the Web UI of this\nproject.\n\n#### Proxy IP List\n\n```\nhttp://localhost:8899/\n```\n\nScreenshot:\n\n![screenshot-proxy-list](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2396817/40653600-946eae6e-6333-11e8-8bbd-9d2f347c5461.png)\n\n#### Globally Geographical Distribution Map\n\n```\nhttp://localhost:8899/#/geo\n```\n\nScreenshot:\n\n![screenshot-geo-distribution](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2396817/40653599-9458b6b8-6333-11e8-8e6e-1d90271fc083.png)\n\nAPI Documentation\n=================\n\nPlease read [Module\nIndex](https://scylla.wildcat.io/en/latest/py-modindex.html).\n\nRoadmap\n=======\n\nPlease see [Projects](https://github.com/imWildCat/scylla/projects).\n\nDevelopment and Contribution\n============================\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/imWildCat/scylla.git\ncd scylla\n\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\nnpm install\nmake assets-build\n```\n\nTesting\n=======\n\nIf you wish to run tests locally, the commands are shown below:\n\n```bash\npip install -r tests/requirements-test.txt\npytest tests/\n```\n\nYou are welcomed to add more test cases to this project, increasing the\nrobustness of this project.\n\nNaming of This Project\n======================\n\n[Scylla](http://prisonbreak.wikia.com/wiki/Scylla) is derived from the\nname of a group of memory chips in the American TV series, [Prison\nBreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison_Break).
