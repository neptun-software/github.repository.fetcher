Some reasons why you might want to contribute:\n\n- there's a bug that you want fixed\n- there's a cool new feature you're thinking about that might be useful for DeepEval\n- there's a metric or benchmark that you want implemented\n- there's room for improvement in the docs\n\nTo contribute, all we ask for is to follow existing patterns within the codebase. For example, if you're looking to add a new benchmark, look at how the different modules in the existing benchmarks are structured and implemented, and we encourage you to reuse helper functions and methods shared by similar modules.\n\nOther than that, there are no strict rules to follow, except for optionally running `black` to ensure good formatting. Also, there's no need to worry about failing test cases in Github Actions, as these are mostly for internal use and will only pass if triggered by a user with the correct permissions within Confident AI.\n\nThank you and come ask any questions or discuss any new PRs you have in mind at our [discord](https://discord.com/invite/a3K9c8GRGt)!\n"

It is similar to Pytest but specialized for unit testing LLM outputs. DeepEval incorporates the latest research to evaluate LLM outputs based on metrics such as G-Eval, hallucination, answer relevancy, RAGAS, etc., which uses LLMs and various other NLP models that runs **locally on your machine** for evaluation.\n\nWhether your application is implemented via RAG or fine-tuning, LangChain or LlamaIndex, DeepEval has you covered. With it, you can easily determine the optimal hyperparameters to improve your RAG pipeline, prevent prompt drifting, or even transition from OpenAI to hosting your own Llama2 with confidence.\n\n> Want to talk LLM evaluation? [Come join our discord.](https://discord.com/invite/a3K9c8GRGt)\n\n<br />\n\n# 🔥 Metrics and Features\n\n> ‼️ You can now run DeepEval's metrics on the cloud for free directly on [Confident AI](https://confident-ai.com?utm_source=GitHub)'s infrastructure 🥳\n\n- Large variety of ready-to-use LLM evaluation metrics (all with explanations) powered by **ANY** LLM of your choice, statistical methods, or NLP models that runs **locally on your machine**:\n  - G-Eval\n  - Summarization\n  - Answer Relevancy\n  - Faithfulness\n  - Contextual Recall\n  - Contextual Precision\n  - RAGAS\n  - Hallucination\n  - etc.\n- [Red team your LLM application](https://docs.confident-ai.com/docs/red-teaming-introduction) for 40+ safety vulnerabilities in a few lines of code, including:\n  - Toxicity\n  - Bias\n  - SQL Injection\n  - etc., using advanced 10+ attack enhancement strategies such as prompt injections.\n- Evaluate your entire dataset in bulk in under 20 lines of Python code **in parallel**. Do this via the CLI in a Pytest-like manner, or through our `evaluate()` function.\n- Create your own custom metrics that are automatically integrated with DeepEval's ecosystem by inheriting DeepEval's base metric class.\n- Integrates seamlessly with **ANY** CI/CD environment.\n- Easily benchmark **ANY** LLM on popular LLM benchmarks in [under 10 lines of code.](https://docs.confident-ai.com/docs/benchmarks-introduction?utm_source=GitHub), which includes:\n  - MMLU\n  - HellaSwag\n  - DROP\n  - BIG-Bench Hard\n  - TruthfulQA\n  - HumanEval\n  - GSM8K\n- [Automatically integrated with Confident AI](https://app.confident-ai.com?utm_source=GitHub) for continous evaluation throughout the lifetime of your LLM (app):\n  - log evaluation results and analyze metrics pass / fails\n  - compare and pick the optimal hyperparameters (eg. prompt templates, chunk size, models used, etc.) based on evaluation results\n  - debug evaluation results via LLM traces\n  - manage evaluation test cases / datasets in one place\n  - track events to identify live LLM responses in production\n  - real-time evaluation in production\n  - add production events to existing evaluation datasets to strength evals over time\n\n(Note that while some metrics are for RAG, others are better for a fine-tuning use case. Make sure to consult our docs to pick the right metric.)\n\n<br />\n\n# 🔌 Integrations\n\n- 🦄 LlamaIndex, to [**unit test RAG applications in CI/CD**](https://docs.confident-ai.com/docs/integrations-llamaindex?utm_source=GitHub)\n- 🤗 Hugging Face, to [**enable real-time evaluations during LLM fine-tuning**](https://docs.confident-ai.com/docs/integrations-huggingface?utm_source=GitHub)\n\n<br />\n\n# 🚀 QuickStart\n\nLet's pretend your LLM application is a RAG based customer support chatbot; here's how DeepEval can help test what you've built.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\npip install -U deepeval\n```\n\n## Create an account (highly recommended)\n\nAlthough optional, creating an account on our platform will allow you to log test results, enabling easy tracking of changes and performances over iterations. This step is optional, and you can run test cases even without logging in, but we highly recommend giving it a try.\n\nTo login, run:\n\n```\ndeepeval login\n```\n\nFollow the instructions in the CLI to create an account, copy your API key, and paste it into the CLI. All test cases will automatically be logged (find more information on data privacy [here](https://docs.confident-ai.com/docs/data-privacy?utm_source=GitHub)).\n\n## Writing your first test case\n\nCreate a test file:\n\n```bash\ntouch test_chatbot.py\n```\n\nOpen `test_chatbot.py` and write your first test case using DeepEval:\n\n```python\nimport pytest\nfrom deepeval import assert_test\nfrom deepeval.metrics import AnswerRelevancyMetric\nfrom deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase\n\ndef test_case():\n    answer_relevancy_metric = AnswerRelevancyMetric(threshold=0.5)\n    test_case = LLMTestCase(\n        input=\"What if these shoes don't fit?\",\n        # Replace this with the actual output from your LLM application\n        actual_output=\"We offer a 30-day full refund at no extra costs.\",\n        retrieval_context=[\"All customers are eligible for a 30 day full refund at no extra costs.\"]\n    )\n    assert_test(test_case, [answer_relevancy_metric])\n```\nSet your `OPENAI_API_KEY` as an environment variable (you can also evaluate using your own custom model, for more details visit [this part of our docs](https://docs.confident-ai.com/docs/metrics-introduction#using-a-custom-llm?utm_source=GitHub)):\n\n```\nexport OPENAI_API_KEY=\"...\"\n```\n\nAnd finally, run `test_chatbot.py` in the CLI:\n\n```\ndeepeval test run test_chatbot.py\n```\n\n**Your test should have passed ✅** Let's breakdown what happened.\n\n- The variable `input` mimics user input, and `actual_output` is a placeholder for your chatbot's intended output based on this query.\n- The variable `retrieval_context` contains the relevant information from your knowledge base, and `AnswerRelevancyMetric(threshold=0.5)` is an out-of-the-box metric provided by DeepEval. It helps evaluate the relevancy of your LLM output based on the provided context.\n- The metric score ranges from 0 - 1. The `threshold=0.5` threshold ultimately determines whether your test has passed or not.\n\n[Read our documentation](https://docs.confident-ai.com/docs/getting-started?utm_source=GitHub) for more information on how to use additional metrics, create your own custom metrics, and tutorials on how to integrate with other tools like LangChain and LlamaIndex.\n\n<br />\n\n## Evaluating Without Pytest Integration\n\nAlternatively, you can evaluate without Pytest, which is more suited for a notebook environment.\n\n```python\nfrom deepeval import evaluate\nfrom deepeval.metrics import AnswerRelevancyMetric\nfrom deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase\n\nanswer_relevancy_metric = AnswerRelevancyMetric(threshold=0.7)\ntest_case = LLMTestCase(\n    input=\"What if these shoes don't fit?\",\n    # Replace this with the actual output from your LLM application\n    actual_output=\"We offer a 30-day full refund at no extra costs.\",\n    retrieval_context=[\"All customers are eligible for a 30 day full refund at no extra costs.\"]\n)\nevaluate([test_case], [answer_relevancy_metric])\n```\n\n## Using Standalone Metrics\n\nDeepEval is extremely modular, making it easy for anyone to use any of our metrics. Continuing from the previous example:\n\n```python\nfrom deepeval.metrics import AnswerRelevancyMetric\nfrom deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase\n\nanswer_relevancy_metric = AnswerRelevancyMetric(threshold=0.7)\ntest_case = LLMTestCase(\n    input=\"What if these shoes don't fit?\",\n    # Replace this with the actual output from your LLM application\n    actual_output=\"We offer a 30-day full refund at no extra costs.\",\n    retrieval_context=[\"All customers are eligible for a 30 day full refund at no extra costs.\"]\n)\n\nanswer_relevancy_metric.measure(test_case)\nprint(answer_relevancy_metric.score)\n# Most metrics also offer an explanation\nprint(answer_relevancy_metric.reason)\n```\n\nNote that some metrics are for RAG pipelines, while others are for fine-tuning. Make sure to use our docs to pick the right one for your use case.\n\n## Evaluating a Dataset / Test Cases in Bulk\n\nIn DeepEval, a dataset is simply a collection of test cases. Here is how you can evaluate these in bulk:\n\n```python\nimport pytest\nfrom deepeval import assert_test\nfrom deepeval.metrics import HallucinationMetric, AnswerRelevancyMetric\nfrom deepeval.test_case import LLMTestCase\nfrom deepeval.dataset import EvaluationDataset\n\nfirst_test_case = LLMTestCase(input=\"...\", actual_output=\"...\", context=[\"...\"])\nsecond_test_case = LLMTestCase(input=\"...\", actual_output=\"...\", context=[\"...\"])\n\ndataset = EvaluationDataset(test_cases=[first_test_case, second_test_case])\n\n@pytest.mark.parametrize(\n    \"test_case\",\n    dataset,\n)\ndef test_customer_chatbot(test_case: LLMTestCase):\n    hallucination_metric = HallucinationMetric(threshold=0.3)\n    answer_relevancy_metric = AnswerRelevancyMetric(threshold=0.5)\n    assert_test(test_case, [hallucination_metric, answer_relevancy_metric])\n```\n\n```bash\n# Run this in the CLI, you can also add an optional -n flag to run tests in parallel\ndeepeval test run test_<filename>.py -n 4\n```\n\n<br/>\n\nAlternatively, although we recommend using `deepeval test run`, you can evaluate a dataset/test cases without using our Pytest integration:\n\n```python\nfrom deepeval import evaluate\n...\n\nevaluate(dataset, [answer_relevancy_metric])\n# or\ndataset.evaluate([answer_relevancy_metric])\n```\n\n# Real-time Evaluations on Confident AI\n\nWe offer a [web platform](https://app.confident-ai.com?utm_source=Github) for you to:\n\n1. Log and view all the test results / metrics data from DeepEval's test runs.\n2. Debug evaluation results via LLM traces.\n3. Compare and pick the optimal hyperparameteres (prompt templates, models, chunk size, etc.).\n4. Create, manage, and centralize your evaluation datasets.\n5. Track events in production and augment your evaluation dataset for continous evaluation.\n6. Track events in production, view evaluation results and historical insights.\n\nEverything on Confident AI, including how to use Confident is available [here](https://docs.confident-ai.com/docs/confident-ai-introduction?utm_source=GitHub).\n\nTo begin, login from the CLI:\n\n```bash\ndeepeval login\n```\n\nFollow the instructions to log in, create your account, and paste your API key into the CLI.\n\nNow, run your test file again:\n\n```bash\ndeepeval test run test_chatbot.py\n```\n\nYou should see a link displayed in the CLI once the test has finished running. Paste it into your browser to view the results!\n\n![ok](https://d2lsxfc3p6r9rv.cloudfront.net/confident-test-cases.png)\n\n<br />\n\n# Contributing\n\nPlease read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on our code of conduct, and the process for submitting pull requests to us.\n\n<br />\n\n# Roadmap\n\nFeatures:\n\n- [x] Implement G-Eval\n- [x] Referenceless Evaluation\n- [x] Production Evaluation & Logging\n- [x] Evaluation Dataset Creation\n\nIntegrations:\n\n- [x] lLamaIndex\n- [ ] langChain\n- [ ] Guidance\n- [ ] Guardrails\n- [ ] EmbedChain\n\n<br />\n\n# Authors\n\nBuilt by the founders of Confident AI.
