It does this by using the model's own generations to create a large collection of instructional data. With Self-Instruct, it is possible to improve the instruction-following capabilities of language models without relying on extensive manual annotation.\n\n### Background\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing interest in building models that can follow natural language instructions to perform a wide range of tasks. These models, known as \"instruction-tuned\" language models, have demonstrated the ability to generalize to new tasks. However, their performance is heavily dependent on the quality and quantity of the human-written instruction data used to train them, which can be limited in diversity and creativity. To overcome these limitations, it is important to develop alternative approaches for supervising instruction-tuned models and improving their instruction-following capabilities.\n\n### How Self-Instruct works?\n\nThe Self-Instruct process is an iterative bootstrapping algorithm that starts with a seed set of manually-written instructions and uses them to prompt the language model to generate new instructions and corresponding input-output instances. These generations are then filtered to remove low-quality or similar ones, and the resulting data is added back to the task pool. This process can be repeated multiple times, resulting in a large collection of instructional data that can be used to fine-tune the language model to follow instructions more effectively.\n\nHere is an overview of Self-Instruct:\n\n![The pipeline for generating instruction data from a language model itself.](docs/pipeline.JPG)\n\n## Usage\n\n\\* **This work is still in progress. We may update the code and data as we make progress. Please be cautious about the version control.**\n\n### Instruction-tuning using our Self-Instruct data\n\nWe release a dataset that contains 52k instructions, paired with 82K instance inputs and outputs. This instruction data can be used to conduct instruction-tuning for language models and make the language model follow instruction better. The entire model-generated data can be accessed in `data/gpt3-generations/batch_221203/all_instances_82K.jsonl`. This data (+ the 175 seed tasks) reformatted in clean GPT3-finetuning format (prompt + completion) is put in `data/finetuning/self_instruct_221203`. You can use the script in [`./scripts/finetune_gpt3.sh`](./scripts/finetune_gpt3.sh) to finetune GPT3 on this data.\n\n**Note**: This data is generated by a language model (GPT3) and inevitably contains some errors or biases. We analyzed the data quality on 200 random instructions in our paper, and found that 46% of the data points may have problems. We encourage users to use this data with caution and propose new methods to filter or improve the imperfections.\n\n### Evaluating instruction-following capabilities\n\nWe also release a new set of 252 expert-written tasks and their instructions motivated by user-oriented applications (rather than well-studied NLP tasks). This data is used in the human evaluation section of [the self-instruct paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10560). Please refer to [the human evaluation README](human_eval/README.md) for more details.\n\n### Generating Self-Instruct data from scratch\n\nTo generate Self-Instruct data using your own seed tasks or other models, we open-source our scripts for the entire pipeline here. Our current code is only tested on the GPT3 model accessible via the [OpenAI API](https://beta.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3).\n\nHere are the scripts for generating the data:\n\n```bash\n# 1. Generate instructions from the seed tasks\n./scripts/generate_instructions.sh\n\n# 2. Identify whether the instruction represents a classification task or not\n./scripts/is_clf_or_not.sh\n\n# 3. Generate instances for each instruction\n./scripts/generate_instances.sh\n\n# 4. Filtering, processing, and reformatting\n./scripts/prepare_for_finetuning.sh\n```\n\n## Citation\n\nIf you use the Self-Instruct framework or data, feel free to cite us.\n\n```bibtex\n@misc{selfinstruct,\n  title={Self-Instruct: Aligning Language Model with Self Generated Instructions},\n  author={Wang, Yizhong and Kordi, Yeganeh and Mishra, Swaroop and Liu, Alisa and Smith, Noah A. and Khashabi, Daniel and Hajishirzi, Hannaneh},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2212.10560},\n  year={2022}\n}\n```\n"
