It will automatically download the pre-train models.\nBut if your network is not connected, you can download pre-train models manually and put it in `~/.cache/torch/checkpoints`.\n\nIf you want to use other pre-train models, such as MoCo pre-train, you can download by yourself and set the pre-train model path in `configs/Base-bagtricks.yml`.\n\n## Compile with cython to accelerate evalution\n\n```bash\ncd fastreid/evaluation/rank_cylib; make all\n```\n\n## Training & Evaluation in Command Line\n\nWe provide a script in \"tools/train_net.py\", that is made to train all the configs provided in fastreid.\nYou may want to use it as a reference to write your own training script.\n\nTo train a model with \"train_net.py\", first setup up the corresponding datasets following [datasets/README.md](https://github.com/JDAI-CV/fast-reid/tree/master/datasets), then run:\n\n```bash\npython3 tools/train_net.py --config-file ./configs/Market1501/bagtricks_R50.yml MODEL.DEVICE \"cuda:0\"\n```\n\nThe configs are made for 1-GPU training.\n\nIf you want to train model with 4 GPUs, you can run:\n\n```bash\npython3 tools/train_net.py --config-file ./configs/Market1501/bagtricks_R50.yml --num-gpus 4\n```\n\nIf you want to train model with multiple machines, you can run:\n\n```\n# machine 1\nexport GLOO_SOCKET_IFNAME=eth0\nexport NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME=eth0\n\npython3 tools/train_net.py --config-file configs/Market1501/bagtricks_R50.yml \\\n--num-gpus 4 --num-machines 2 --machine-rank 0 --dist-url tcp://ip:port \n\n# machine 2\nexport GLOO_SOCKET_IFNAME=eth0\nexport NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME=eth0\n\npython3 tools/train_net.py --config-file configs/Market1501/bagtricks_R50.yml \\\n--num-gpus 4 --num-machines 2 --machine-rank 1 --dist-url tcp://ip:port \n```\n\nMake sure the dataset path and code are the same in different machines, and machines can communicate with each other. \n\nTo evaluate a model's performance, use\n\n```bash\npython3 tools/train_net.py --config-file ./configs/Market1501/bagtricks_R50.yml --eval-only \\\nMODEL.WEIGHTS /path/to/checkpoint_file MODEL.DEVICE \"cuda:0\"\n```\n\nFor more options, see `python3 tools/train_net.py -h`.\n"

It is a ground-up rewrite of the previous version, [reid strong baseline](https://github.com/michuanhaohao/reid-strong-baseline).\n\n## What's New\n\n- [Sep 2021] [DG-ReID](https://github.com/xiaomingzhid/sskd) is updated, you can check the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.05045.pdf).\n- [June 2021] [Contiguous parameters](https://github.com/PhilJd/contiguous_pytorch_params) is supported, now it can\n  accelerate ~20%.\n- [May 2021] Vision Transformer backbone supported, see `configs/Market1501/bagtricks_vit.yml`.\n- [Apr 2021] Partial FC supported in [FastFace](projects/FastFace)!\n- [Jan 2021] TRT network definition APIs in [FastRT](projects/FastRT) has been released! \nThanks for [Darren](https://github.com/TCHeish)'s contribution.\n- [Jan 2021] NAIC20(reid track) [1-st solution](projects/NAIC20) based on fastreid has been released！\n- [Jan 2021] FastReID V1.0 has been released！🎉\n  Support many tasks beyond reid, such image retrieval and face recognition. See [release notes](https://github.com/JDAI-CV/fast-reid/releases/tag/v1.0.0).\n- [Oct 2020] Added the [Hyper-Parameter Optimization](projects/FastTune) based on fastreid. See `projects/FastTune`.\n- [Sep 2020] Added the [person attribute recognition](projects/FastAttr) based on fastreid. See `projects/FastAttr`.\n- [Sep 2020] Automatic Mixed Precision training is supported with `apex`. Set `cfg.SOLVER.FP16_ENABLED=True` to switch it on.\n- [Aug 2020] [Model Distillation](projects/FastDistill) is supported, thanks for [guan'an wang](https://github.com/wangguanan)'s contribution.\n- [Aug 2020] ONNX/TensorRT converter is supported.\n- [Jul 2020] Distributed training with multiple GPUs, it trains much faster.\n- Includes more features such as circle loss, abundant visualization methods and evaluation metrics, SoTA results on conventional, cross-domain, partial and vehicle re-id, testing on multi-datasets simultaneously, etc.\n- Can be used as a library to support [different projects](projects) on top of it. We'll open source more research projects in this way.\n- Remove [ignite](https://github.com/pytorch/ignite)(a high-level library) dependency and powered by [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).\n\nWe write a [fastreid intro](https://l1aoxingyu.github.io/blogpages/reid/fastreid/2020/05/29/fastreid.html) \nand [fastreid v1.0](https://l1aoxingyu.github.io/blogpages/reid/fastreid/2021/04/28/fastreid-v1.html) about this toolbox.\n\n## Changelog\n\nPlease refer to [changelog.md](CHANGELOG.md) for details and release history.\n\n## Installation\n\nSee [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).\n\n## Quick Start\n\nThe designed architecture follows this guide [PyTorch-Project-Template](https://github.com/L1aoXingyu/PyTorch-Project-Template), you can check each folder's purpose by yourself.\n\nSee [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md).\n\nLearn more at out [documentation](https://fast-reid.readthedocs.io/). And see [projects/](projects) for some projects that are build on top of fastreid.\n\n## Model Zoo and Baselines\n\nWe provide a large set of baseline results and trained models available for download in the [Fastreid Model Zoo](MODEL_ZOO.md).\n\n## Deployment\n\nWe provide some examples and scripts to convert fastreid model to Caffe, ONNX and TensorRT format in [Fastreid deploy](tools/deploy).\n\n## License\n\nFastreid is released under the [Apache 2.0 license](LICENSE).\n\n## Citing FastReID\n\nIf you use FastReID in your research or wish to refer to the baseline results published in the Model Zoo, please use the following BibTeX entry.\n\n```BibTeX\n@article{he2020fastreid,\n  title={FastReID: A Pytorch Toolbox for General Instance Re-identification},\n  author={He, Lingxiao and Liao, Xingyu and Liu, Wu and Liu, Xinchen and Cheng, Peng and Mei, Tao},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2006.02631},\n  year={2020}\n}\n```\n"
