If you find any **bug** or incorrect implementation (or faster/better implementation) in this repo, please let me know by opening an issue or pull request.*\n\n\n### Template\n\nFor easier navigation into the solutions, each file with a solution in this repo will have the following template:\n\n```python\n'''\nProblem Name\n\nProblem explanation.\n\nInput: XXX\nOutput: XXX\nOutput explanation: XXX\n\n=========================================\nSolution 1 explanation.\n    Time Complexity:    O(X)\n    Space Complexity:   O(X)\nSolution 2 explanation.\n(some of the problems are solved in more than one way)\n    Time Complexity:    O(X)\n    Space Complexity:   O(X)\n'''\n\n\n##############\n# Solution 1 #\n##############\n\ndef name_of_solution_1(params):\n    # description of code\n    pass\n\n\n##############\n# Solution 2 #\n##############\n\ndef name_of_solution_2(params):\n    # description of code\n    pass\n\n\n###########\n# Testing #\n###########\n\n# Test 1\n# Correct result => 'result1'\ntest_val = 'example1'\nprint(name_of_solution_1(test_val))\nprint(name_of_solution_2(test_val))\n\n# Test 2\n# Correct result => 'result2'\ntest_val = 'example2'\nprint(name_of_solution_1(test_val))\nprint(name_of_solution_2(test_val))\n```\n\n*Note that here I'm using the **simplest** way of testing, printing the results using the [print](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print) method. Why? Because I think that the bigger part of the users of this repo isn't familiar with [unit testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) and I wanted this part to be intuitive. Btw, I strongly recommend using some unit testing framework for this kind of testing. The Python Standard Library contains a **great** framework for unit testing called [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html), or you can install some third-party unit testing framework like [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/).*\n\n### Categories\n\nEach solution/problem in this repo belongs to one of these categories:\n\n1.

[Grokking Algorithms by Aditya Bhargava](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22847284-grokking-algorithms-an-illustrated-guide-for-programmers-and-other-curio) - **The best** book for complete beginners in algorithms! I wish this book existed when I started learning algorithms.\n2. [Introduction to Algorithms by CLRS](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6752187-introduction-to-algorithms) - This book is called the \"bible textbook of algorithms\" by many programmers.\n3. [Algorithms by Robert Sedgewick & Kevin Wayne](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10803540-algorithms) - These authors are instructors of the previously mentioned Coursera courses: [Algorithms Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) and [Algorithms Part 2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2). Also, this book has an excellent and free [site](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu) with exercises, presentations, and examples.\n4. [The Algorithm Design Manual by Steven Skiena](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/425208.The_Algorithm_Design_Manual) - The book describes many advanced topics and algorithms and it focuses on real-life practical examples. This book has [one](http://www.algorist.com) of the best sites with resources ([solution wiki](https://algorist.com/algowiki/index.php/), [algorithms and data structures](http://www.algorist.com/algorist.html), [python implementations](http://www.algorist.com/languages/Python.html)).\n5. [Algorithms by S. Dasgupta, C. Papadimitriou, and U. Vazirani](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/138563.Algorithms) - This book is an official book for algorithms and data structures classes in several famous universities.\n6. [Competitive Programming 3 by Steven Halim & Felix Halim](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22820968-competitive-programming-3) - A great book that prepares you for competitive programming (not for complete beginners). You can learn many things and tricks about competitive programming. *But if your goal is to prepare for competitive programming then choose a faster language than Python, **C/C++** (or Java, it's faster than Python but not like C/C++).*\n7. [Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29350585-cracking-the-coding-interview) - A bit different from the previous books. Prepares you for coding interviews using great coding problems.\n\n\n### Training Sites\n\nIf the problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) are not enough and you need more problems like those, you can find much more on these platforms:\n\n- [CodeChef](http://codechef.com/)\n- [HackerEarth](http://hackerearth.com/)\n- [CodeForces](http://codeforces.com/)\n- [Topcoder](http://topcoder.com/)\n- [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/)\n- [HackerRank](http://hackerrank.com/)\n- [SPOJ](http://www.spoj.com/)\n- [PEG](https://wcipeg.com/)\n- [Online Judge](https://onlinejudge.org/)\n- [AIZU OJ](https://onlinejudge.u-aizu.ac.jp/)\n- [E-Olymp](https://www.e-olymp.com/en/)\n- [VJudge](https://vjudge.net/)\n- [DMOJ](https://dmoj.ca/)\n- [USA CO](http://www.usaco.org/)\n- [POJ](http://poj.org/)\n- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)\n- [Rosetta Code](http://rosettacode.org/)\n- [LintCode](http://www.lintcode.com/en/)\n- [Kattis](https://www.kattis.com/developers)\n- [CodeAbbey](http://codeabbey.com/)\n- [CS Academy](https://csacademy.com/)\n- [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)\n- [Exercism](https://exercism.io/)\n- [CodeFu](https://codefu.mk/)\n- [Mendo](https://mendo.mk/Welcome.do)\n- [Codewars](http://www.codewars.com/)\n- [Wolfram Challenges](https://challenges.wolfram.com/)\n- [Google's Coding Competitions](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/)\n- [Cyber-dojo](https://cyber-dojo.org/)\n- [CodingBat](http://codingbat.com/)\n- [CodeKata](http://codekata.com/)\n- [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/)\n- [Daily Interview Pro](http://dailyinterviewpro.com/)\n- [AlgoDaily](https://algodaily.com/)\n- [Codility](https://codility.com/)\n- [CoderByte](https://coderbyte.com/)\n- [AlgoExpert](https://www.algoexpert.io/)\n- [CodeSignal](https://codesignal.com/)\n- [Edabit](https://edabit.com/)\n- [DevPost](https://devpost.com/)\n- [Brilliant](http://brilliant.org/)\n- [Codingame](https://www.codingame.com/)\n- [CheckiO](http://www.checkio.org/)\n- [Kaggle](http://kaggle.com/)\n- [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/)\n- [workat.tech](https://workat.tech/problem-solving/practice/)\n\n\n### Other Resources\n\n1.
