[Pull request #2528](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2528)\n* Began implementing one of the migration strategies outlined in [BEP-42](https://github.com/bigchaindb/BEPs/tree/master/42). That involved creating a more general-purpose election process and commands. Pull requests [#2488](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2488), [#2495](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2495), [#2498](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2498), [#2515](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2515), [#2535](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2535)\n* Used memoization to avoid doing some validation checks multiple times. [Pull request #2490](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2490)\n* Created an all-in-one Docker image containing BigchainDB Server, Tendermint and MongoDB. It was created for a particular user and is not recommended for production use unless you really know what you're doing. [Pull request #2424](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2424)\n\n### Changed\n\n* The supported versions of Tendermint are now hard-wired into BigchainDB Server: it checks to see what version the connected Tendermint has, and if it's not compatible, BigchainDB Server exits with an error message. [Pull request #2541](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2541)\n* The docs no longer say to install the highest version of Tendermint: they say to install a specific version. [Pull request #2524](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2524)\n* The setup docs include more recommended settings for `config.toml`. [Pull request #2516](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2516)\n* The process to add, remove or update the voting power of a validator at run time (using the `bigchaindb upsert-validator` subcommands) was completely changed and is now fully working. See [issue #2372](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/issues/2372) and all the pull requests it references. Pull requests [#2439](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2439) and [#2440](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2440)\n* The license on the documentation was changed from CC-BY-SA-4 to CC-BY-4. [Pull request #2427](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2427)\n* Re-activated and/or updated some unit tests that had been deacivated during the migration to Tendermint. Pull requests [#2390](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2390), [#2415](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2415), [#2452](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/24), [#2456](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2456)\n* Updated RapidJSON to a newer, faster version. [Pull request #2470](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2470)\n* The Java driver is now officially supported. [Pull request #2478](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2478)\n* The MongoDB indexes on transaction id and block height were changed to be [unique indexes](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/index-unique/). [Pull request #2492](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2492)\n* Updated the required `cryptoconditions` package to a newer one. [Pull request #2494](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2494)\n\n### Removed\n\n* Removed some old code and tests. Pull requests\n  [#2374](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2374),\n  [#2452](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2452),\n  [#2474](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2474),\n  [#2476](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2476),\n  [#2491](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2491)\n\n### Fixed\n\n* Fixed the Events API so that it only sends valid transactions to subscribers. Also changed how it works internally, so now it is more reliable. [Pull request #2529](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2529)\n* Fixed a bug where MongoDB database initialization would abort if a collection already existed. [Pull request #2520](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2520)\n* Fixed a unit test that was failing randomly. [Pull request #2423](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2423)\n* Fixed the validator curl port. [Pull request #2447](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2447)\n* Fixed an error in the docs about the HTTP POST /transactions endpoint. [Pull request #2481](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2481)\n* Fixed a unit test that could loop forever.

[Pull request#2519](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2519)\n\n### External Contributors\n\n@danacr - [Pull request #2447](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2447)\n\n### Notes\n\nThe docs section titled \"Production Deployment Template\" was renamed to \"Kubernetes Deployment Template\" and we no longer consider it the go-to deployment template. The \"Simple Deployment Template\" is simpler, easier to understand, and less expensive (unless you are with an organization that already has a big Kubernetes cluster).\n\n## [2.0 Beta 5] - 2018-08-01\n\nTag name: v2.0.0b5\n\n### Changed\n\n* Supported version of Tendermint `0.22.3` -> `0.22.8`. [Pull request #2429](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2429).\n\n### Fixed\n\n* Stateful validation raises a DoubleSpend exception if there is any other transaction that spends the same output(s) even if it has the same transaction ID. [Pull request #2422](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2422).\n\n## [2.0 Beta 4] - 2018-07-30\n\nTag name: v2.0.0b4\n\n### Added\n\n- Added scripts for creating a configuration to manage processes with Monit. [Pull request #2410](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2410).\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Redundant asset and metadata queries were removed. [Pull request #2409](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2409).\n- Signal handling was fixed for BigchainDB processes. [Pull request #2395](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2395).\n- Some of the abruptly closed sockets that used to stay in memory are being cleaned up now. [Pull request 2408](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2408).\n- Fixed the bug when WebSockets powering Events API became unresponsive. [Pull request #2413](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2413).\n\n### Notes:\n\n* The instructions on how to write a BEP were simplified. [Pull request #2347](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2347).\n* A section about troubleshooting was added to the network setup guide. [Pull request #2398](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2398).\n* Some of the core code was given a better package structure. [Pull request #2401](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2401).\n* Some of the previously disabled unit tests were re-enabled and updated. Pull requests [#2404](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2404) and [#2402](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2402).\n* Some building blocks for dynamically adding new validators were introduced. [Pull request #2392](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2392).\n\n## [2.0 Beta 3] - 2018-07-18\n\nTag name: v2.0.0b3\n\n### Fixed\n\nFixed a bug in transaction validation. For some more-complex situations, it would say that a valid transaction was invalid. This bug was actually fixed before; it was [issue #1271](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/issues/1271). The unit test for it was turned off while we integrated Tendermint. Then the query implementation code got changed, reintroducing the bug, but the unit test was off so the bug wasn't caught. When we turned the test back on, shortly after releasing Beta 2, it failed, unveiling the bug. [Pull request #2389](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2389)\n\n## [2.0 Beta 2] - 2018-07-16\n\nTag name: v2.0.0b2\n\n### Added\n\n* Added new configuration settings `tendermint.host` and `tendermint.port`. [Pull request #2342](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2342)\n* Added tests to ensure that BigchainDB gracefully handles \"nasty\" strings in keys and values. [Pull request #2334](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2334)\n* Added a new logging handler to capture benchmark stats to a separate file. [Pull request #2349](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2349)\n\n### Changed\n\n* Changed the names of BigchainDB processes (Python processes) to include 'bigchaindb', so they are easier to spot and find. [Pull request #2354](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2354)\n* Updated all code to support the latest version of Tendermint. Note that the BigchainDB ABCI server now listens to port 26657 instead of 46657. Pull requests [#2375](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2375) and [#2380](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2380)\n\n### Removed\n\nRemoved all support and code for the old backlog_reassign_delay setting. [Pull request #2332](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2332)\n\n### Fixed\n\n* Fixed a bug that sometimes arose when using Docker Compose. (Tendermint would freeze.) [Pull request #2341](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2341)\n* Fixed a bug in the code that creates a MongoDB index for the \"id\" in the transactions collection. It works now, and performance is improved. [Pull request #2378](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2378)\n* The logging server would keep runnning in some tear-down scenarios. It doesn't do that any more. [Pull request #2304](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2304)\n\n### External Contributors\n\n@hrntknr - [Pull request #2331](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2331)\n\n### Known Issues\n\nThe `bigchaindb upsert-validator` subcommand is not working yet, but a solution ([BEP-21](https://github.com/bigchaindb/BEPs/tree/master/21)) has been finalized and will be implemented before we release the final BigchainDB 2.0.\n\n### Notes\n\n* A lot of old/dead code was deleted. Pull requests\n[#2319](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2319),\n[#2338](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2338),\n[#2357](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2357),\n[#2365](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2365),\n[#2366](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2366),\n[#2368](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2368) and\n[#2374](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2374)\n* Improved the documentation page \"How to setup a BigchainDB Network\". [Pull Request #2312](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2312)\n\n## [2.0 Beta 1] - 2018-06-01\n\nTag name: v2.0.0b1\n\n### Fixed\n\n* Fixed a bug that arose with some code that treated transactions-waiting-for-block-inclusion as if they were already stored in MongoDB (i.e. already in a block). [Pull request #2318](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2318)\n* If a user asked for a block and it happened to be an empty block, BigchainDB returned 404 Not Found, as if the block did not exist. Now it returns a 200 OK with a block containing no transactions, i.e. an empty block. [Pull request #2321](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2321)\n\n### Known Issues\n\n* An issue was found with the `bigchaindb upsert-validator` command. A solution was proposed in [BEP-19](https://github.com/bigchaindb/BEPs/pull/45) and is being implemented in [pull request #2314](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2314)\n* If you run BigchainDB locally using `make start` (i.e. using Docker Compose) and then you put the node under heavy write load, Tendermint can become unresponsive and running `make stop` can hang.\n* There seems to be one or more issues with Tendermint when it is put under heavy load (i.e. even when BigchainDB isn't involved). See Tendermint issues [#1394](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/1394), [#1642](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/1642) and [#1661](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/1661)\n\n### Notes\n\n* There's a [new docs page](https://docs.bigchaindb.com/projects/server/en/v2.0.0b1/simple-network-setup.html) about how to set up a network where each node uses a single virtual machine.\n* We checked, and BigchainDB 2.0 Beta 1 works with MongoDB 3.6 (and 3.4).\n* Support for RethinkDB is completely gone.\n\n## [2.0 Alpha 6] - 2018-05-17\n\nTag name: v2.0.0a6\n\n### Changed\n\nUpgraded PyMongo to version 3.6 (which is compatible with MongoDB 3.6, 3.4 [and more](https://docs.mongodb.com/ecosystem/drivers/driver-compatibility-reference/#python-driver-compatibility)). [Pull request #2298](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2298)\n\n### Fixed\n\nWhen deploying a node using our Docker Compose file, it didn't expose port 46656, which is used by Tendermint for inter-node communications, so the node couldn't communicate with other nodes. We fixed that in [pull request #2299](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2299)\n\n### Notes\n\nWe ran all our tests using MongoDB 3.6 and they all passed, so it seems safe to use BigchainDB with MongoDB 3.6 from now on.\n\n## [2.0 Alpha 5] - 2018-05-11\n\nTag name: v2.0.0a5\n\n### Changed\n\nTo resolve [issue #2279](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/issues/2279), we made some changes to the `bigchaindb-abci` package (which is our fork of `py-abci`) and told BigchainDB to use the new version (`bigchaindb-abci==0.4.5`). [Pull request #2281](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2281).\n\n## [2.0 Alpha 4] - 2018-05-09\n\nTag name: v2.0.0a4\n\n### Changed\n\nThe Kubernetes liveness probe for the BigchainDB StatefulSet was improved to check the Tendermint /status endpoint in addition to the Tendermint /abci_info endpoint. [Pull request #2275](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2275)\n\n### Fixed\n\n[Pull request #2270](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2270) resolved [issue #2269](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/issues/2269).\n\n### Notes\n\nThere's a new [page in the docs about storing files in BigchainDB](https://docs.bigchaindb.com/en/latest/store-files.html). [Pull request #2259](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2259)\n\n## [2.0 Alpha 3] - 2018-05-03\n\nTag name: v2.0.0a3\n\n### Changed\n\n* Upgraded BigchainDB Server code to use the latest version of Tendermint: version 0.19.2. Pull requests [#2249](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2249), [#2252](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2252) and [#2253](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2253)\n* Made some fixes to `py-abci` (an external Python package) and used our fixed version with BigchainDB. Those fixes resolved several known issues, including [issue #2182](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/issues/2182) and issues with large transactions in general. Note: At the time of writing, our fixes to `py-abci` hadn't been merged into the main `py-abci` repository or its latest release on PyPI; we were using our own special `bigchaindb-abci` package (which included our fixes). Pull requests [#2250](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2250) and [#2261](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2261)\n* If BigchainDB Server crashes and then comes back, Tendermint Core doesn't try to reconnect to it. That's just how Tendermint Core works. We revised our Kubernetes-based production deployment template to resolve that issue: BigchainDB Server and Tendermint Core are now in the same Kubernetes StatefulSet; if the connection between them ever goes down, then Kubernetes restarts the whole StatefulSet. [Pull request #2242](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2242)\n\n### Fixed\n\nRe-enabled multi-threading. [Pull request #2258](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2258)\n\n### Known Issues\n\nTendermint changed how it responds to a request to store data (via the [Tendermint Broadcast API](https://tendermint.com/docs/tendermint-core/using-tendermint.html#broadcast-api)) between version 0.12 and 0.19.2. We started modifying the code of BigchainDB Server to account for those changes in responses (in [pull request #2239](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2239)), but we found that there's a difference between what the Tendermint documentation _says_ about those responses and how Tendermint actually responds. We need to determine Tendermint's intent before we can finalize that pull request.\n\n### Notes\n\nWe were focused on getting the public BigchainDB Testnet stable during the development of BigchainDB 2.0 Alpha 3, and we think we largely succeeded. Because of that focus, we delayed the deployment of an internal test network until later. It would have had the same instabilities as the public BigchainDB Testnet anyway. In the future, we'll always test a new version of BigchainDB on our internal test network before deploying it on the public BigchainDB Testnet. (That wasn't possible this time around, because there was no old/stable version of BigchainDB 2.n to run on the public BigchainDB Testnet while we tested BigchainDB 2.[n+1] internally.)\n\n## [2.0 Alpha 2] - 2018-04-18\n\nTag name: v2.0.0a2\n\n### Added\n\nAn implementation of [BEP-8 (BigchainDB Enhancement Proposal #8)](https://github.com/bigchaindb/BEPs/tree/master/8), which makes sure a node can recover from a system fault (e.g. a crash) into a consistent state, i.e. a state where the data in the node's local MongoDB database is consistent with the data stored in the blockchain. Pull requests [#2135](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2135) and [#2207](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2207)\n\n### Changed\n\nWhen someone uses the HTTP API to send a new transaction to a BigchainDB network using the [POST /api/v1/transactions?mode={mode}](https://docs.bigchaindb.com/projects/server/en/master/http-client-server-api.html#post--api-v1-transactions?mode=mode) endpoint, they now get back a more informative HTTP response, so they can better-understand what happened. This is only when mode is `commit` or `sync`, because `async` _means_ that the response is immediate, without waiting to see what happened to the transaction. [Pull request #2198](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/2198)\n\n### Known Issues\n\n* If BigchainDB Server crashes and then is restarted, Tendermint Core won't try to reconnect to BigchainDB Server and so all operations requiring that connection won't work. We only understood this recently. We'll write a blog post explaining what we intend to do about it.\n* The known issues in 2.0 Alpha (listed below) are still there.\n\n## [2.0 Alpha] - 2018-04-03\n\nTag name: v2.0.0a1\n\nThere were _many_ changes between 1.3 and 2.0 Alpha, too many to list here. We wrote a series of blog posts to summarize most changes, especially those that affect end users and application developers:\n\n* [BigchainDB 2.0 is Byzantine Fault Tolerant](https://blog.bigchaindb.com/bigchaindb-2-0-is-byzantine-fault-tolerant-5ffdac96bc44)\n* [Some HTTP API Changes in the Next Release](https://blog.bigchaindb.com/some-http-api-changes-in-the-next-release-49612a537b0c)\n* [Three Transaction Model Changes in the Next Release](https://blog.bigchaindb.com/three-transaction-model-changes-in-the-next-release-dadbac50094a)\n* [Changes to the Server Command Line Interface in BigchainDB 2.0](https://blog.bigchaindb.com/changes-to-the-server-command-line-interface-in-bigchaindb-2-0-e1d6576e7155)\n* _A forthcoming post about changes in BigchainDB Server configuration settings_\n\n### External Contributors\n\n* @r7vme contributed [pull request #1984](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1984) which fixed a bug in our Kubernetes-based production deployment template.\n\n### Known Issues\n\nWe intend to resolve these issues before releasing the final BigchainDB 2.0:\n\n* There's a known Heisenbug that (sometimes) arises and we found that making the BigchainDB webserver single-threaded prevents that bug from causing problems. We intend to resolve that bug, but in the meantime our temporary workaround is to change the _default_ webserver configuration settings to single-threaded mode, i.e. `BIGCHAINDB_SERVER_WORKERS=1` and `BIGCHAINDB_SERVER_THREADS=1`.\n* Issues sometimes happen when a large transaction is sent to a BigchainDB network.\n\n## [1.3] - 2017-11-21\nTag name: v1.3.0\n\n### Added\n* Metadata full-text search. [Pull request #1812](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1812)\n\n### Notes\n* Improved documentation about blocks and votes. [Pull request #1855](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1855)\n\n\n## [1.2] - 2017-11-13\nTag name: v1.2.0\n\n### Added\n* New and improved installation setup docs and code. Pull requests [#1775](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1775) and [#1785](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1785)\n* New BigchainDB configuration setting to set the port number of the log server: `log.port`. [Pull request #1796](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1796)\n* New secondary index on `id` in the bigchain table. That will make some queries execute faster. [Pull request #1803](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1803)\n* When using MongoDB, there are some restrictions on allowed names for keys (JSON keys). Those restrictions were always there but now BigchainDB checks key names explicitly, rather than leaving that to MongoDB. Pull requests [#1807](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1807) and [#1811](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1811)\n* When using MongoDB, there are some restrictions on the allowed values of \"language\" (if that key is used in the values of `metadata` or `asset.data`). Those restrictions were always there but now BigchainDB checks the values explicitly, rather than leaving that to MongoDB. Pull requests [#1806](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1806) and [#1811](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1811)\n* There's a new page in the root docs about permissions in BigchainDB. [Pull request #1788](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1788)\n* There's a new option in the `bigchaindb start` command: `bigchaindb start --no-init` will avoid doing `bigchaindb init` if it wasn't done already. [Pull request #1814](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1814)\n\n### Fixed\n* Fixed a bug where setting the log level in a BigchainDB config file didn't have any effect. It does now. [Pull request #1797](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1797)\n* The docs were wrong about there being no Ping/Pong support in the Events API. There is, so the docs were fixed. [Pull request #1799](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1799)\n* Fixed an issue with closing WebSocket connections properly. [Pull request #1819](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1819)\n\n### Notes\n* Many changes were made to the Kubernetes-based production deployment template and code.\n\n\n## [1.1] - 2017-09-26\nTag name: v1.1.0\n\n### Added\n* Support for server-side plugins that can add support for alternate event consumers (other than the WebSocket API). [Pull request #1707](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1707)\n* New configuration settings to set the *advertised* wsserver scheme, host and port. (The *advertised* ones are the ones that external users use to connect to the WebSocket API.) [Pull request #1703](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1703)\n* Support for secure (TLS) WebSocket connections. [Pull request #1619](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1619)\n* A new page of documentation about the contents of a condition (inside a transaction). [Pull request #1668](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1668)\n\n### Changed\n* We updated our definition of the **public API** (at the top of this document). [Pull request #1700](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1700)\n* The HTTP API Logger now logs the request path and method as well. [Pull request #1644](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1644)\n\n### External Contributors\n* @carchrae - [Pull request #1731](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1731)\n* @ivanbakel - [Pull request #1706](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1706)\n* @ketanbhatt - Pull requests [#1643](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1643) and [#1644](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1644)\n\n### Notes\n* New drivers & tools from our community:\n    * [Java driver](https://github.com/authenteq/java-bigchaindb-driver), by [Authenteq](https://authenteq.com/)\n    * [Ruby library](https://rubygems.org/gems/bigchaindb), by @nileshtrivedi\n* Many improvements to our production deployment template (which uses Kubernetes).\n* The production deployment template for the multi-node case was out of date. We updated that and verified it. [Pull request #1713](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1713)\n\n\n## [1.0.1] - 2017-07-13\nTag name: v1.0.1\n\n### Fixed\n* Various issues in the Quickstart page. Pull requests\n [#1641](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1641) and\n [#1648](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1648).\n* Changefeed hanging when MongoDB primary node is turned off.\n [Pull request #1638](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1638).\n* Missing `assets` tables for RethinkDB backend.\n [Pull request #1646](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1646).\n* Cryptoconditions version mismatch.\n [Pull request #1659](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1659).\n\n\n## [1.0.0] - 2017-07-05\nTag name: v1.0.0\n\n**This just reports the changes since the release of 1.0.0rc1. If you want the full picture of all changes since 0.10, then read the 1.0.0rc1 change log below as well as the upgrade guide.**\n\n### Changed\n* The file name of the upgrade guide changed from `docs/upgrade-guides/v0.10-->v1.0.md` to `docs/upgrade-guides/v0.10-v1.0.md`.\n* In `transaction.inputs[n].fulfills`, `output` was renamed to `output_index`. [Pull Request #1596](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1596)\n* In `transaction.outputs[n].condition.details`, 1) `signature` was removed (from signature conditions) and 2) `subfulfillments` was renamed to `subconditions` (in threshold conditions). [Pull Request #1589](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1589)\n* Refined transaction schema validation to check that the `transaction.outputs[n].condition.uri` corresponds to a condition that BigchainDB Server 1.0.0 actually supports. [Pull Request #1597](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1597)\n* Before, GET requests (to the HTTP API) with header `Content-Type: 'application/json'` would get a response with the message, \"The browser (or proxy) sent a request that this server could not understand.\" Now, if a GET request includes a `Content-Type` header, that header gets deleted (i.e. ignored). [Pull Request #1630](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1630)\n\n### Fixed\n* If an end user sends a transaction with `operation` equal to `GENESIS`, it will be rejected as invalid. [Pull Request #1612](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1612)\n\n\n## [1.0.0rc1] - 2017-06-23\nTag name: v1.0.0rc1\n\n### Added\n* Support for secure TLS/SSL communication between MongoDB and {BigchainDB, MongoDB Backup Agent, MongoDB Monitoring Agent}. Pull Requests\n[#1456](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1456),\n[#1497](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1497),\n[#1510](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1510),\n[#1536](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1536),\n[#1551](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1551) and\n[#1552](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1552).\n* Text search support (only if using MongoDB). Pull Requests [#1469](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1469) and [#1471](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1471)\n* The `database.connection_timeout` configuration setting now works with RethinkDB too. [#1512](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1512)\n* New code and tools for benchmarking CREATE transactions. [Pull Request #1511](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1511)\n\n### Changed\n* There's an upgrade guide in `docs/upgrade-guides/v0.10-->v1.0.md`. It only covers changes to the transaction model and HTTP API. If that file hasn't been merged yet, see [Pull Request #1547](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1547)\n* Cryptographic signatures now sign the whole (serialized) transaction body, including the transaction ID, but with all `\"fulfillment\"` values changed to `None`. [Pull Request #1225](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1225)\n* In transactions, the value of `\"amount\"` must be a string. (Before, it was supposed to be a number.) [Pull Request #1286](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1286)\n* In `setup.py`, the  \"Development Status\" (as reported on PyPI) was changed from Alpha to Beta. [Pull Request #1437](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1437)\n* If you explicitly specify a config file, e.g. `bigchaindb -c path/to/config start` and that file can't be found, then BigchainDB Server will fail with a helpful error message. [Pull Request #1486](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1486)\n* Reduced the response time on the HTTP API endpoint to get all the unspent outputs associated with a given public key (a.k.a. \"fast unspents\"). [Pull Request #1411](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1411)\n* Internally, the value of an asset's `\"data\"` is now stored in a separate assets table. This enabled the new text search. Each asset data is stored along with the associated CREATE transaction ID (asset ID). That data gets written when the containing block gets written to the bigchain table. [Pull Request #1460](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1460)\n* Schema validation was sped up by switching to `rapidjson-schema`. [Pull Request #1494](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1494)\n* If a node comes back from being down for a while, it will resume voting on blocks in the order determined by the MongoDB oplog, in the case of MongoDB. (In the case of RethinkDB, blocks missed in the changefeed will not be voted on.) [Pull Request #1389](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1389)\n* Parallelized transaction schema validation in the vote pipeline. [Pull Request #1492](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1492)\n* `asset.data` or `asset.id` are now *required* in a CREATE or TRANSFER transaction, respectively. [Pull Request #1518](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1518)\n* The HTTP response body, in the response to the `GET /` and the `GET /api/v1` endpoints, was changed substantially. [Pull Request #1529](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1529)\n* Changed the HTTP `GET /api/v1/transactions/{transaction_id}` endpoint. It now only returns the transaction if it's in a valid block. It also returns a new header with a relative link to a status monitor. [Pull Request #1543](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1543)\n* All instances of `txid` and `tx_id` were replaced with `transaction_id`, in the transaction model and the HTTP API. [Pull Request #1532](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1532)\n* The hostname and port were removed from all URLs in all HTTP API responses. [Pull Request #1538](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1538)\n* Relative links were replaced with JSON objects in HTTP API responses. [Pull Request #1541](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1541)\n* In the outputs endpoint of the HTTP API, the query parameter `unspent` was changed to `spent` (so no more double negatives). If that query parameter isn't included, then all outputs matching the specificed public key will be returned. If `spent=true`, then only the spent outputs will be returned. If `spent=false`, then only the unspent outputs will be returned. [Pull Request #1545](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1545)\n* The supported crypto-conditions changed from version 01 of the crypto-conditions spec to version 02. [Pull Request #1562](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1562)\n* The value of \"version\" inside a transaction must now be \"1.0\". (Before, it could be \"0.anything\".) [Pull Request #1574](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1574)\n\n### Removed\n* The `server.threads` configuration setting (for the Gunicorn HTTP server) was removed from the default set of BigchainDB configuration settings. [Pull Request #1488](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1488)\n\n### Fixed\n* The `GET /api/v1/outputs` endpoint was failing for some transactions with threshold conditions.

(It used to contain both BigchainDB Server and RethinkDB.) You must now run MongoDB or RethinkDB in a separate Docker container. [Pull Request #1174](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1174)\n* Made separate schemas for CREATE and TRANSFER transactions.

It's work in progress.\n\n\n## [0.9.5] - 2017-03-29\nTag name: v0.9.5\n\n### Fixed\nUpgrade `python-rapidjson` to `0.0.11`(fixes #1350 - thanks to @ferOnti for\nreporting).\n\n## [0.9.4] - 2017-03-16\nTag name: v0.9.4\n\n### Fixed\nFixed #1271 (false double spend error). Thanks to @jmduque for reporting the\nproblem along with a very detailed diagnosis and useful recommendations.\n\n## [0.9.3] - 2017-03-06\nTag name: v0.9.3\n\n### Fixed\nFixed HTTP API 500 error on `GET /outputs`: issues #1200 and #1231.\n\n## [0.9.2] - 2017-03-02\nTag name: v0.9.2\n\n### Fixed\nPin `python-rapidjson` library in `setup.py` to prevent `bigchaindb`'s\ninstallation to fail due to\nhttps://github.com/python-rapidjson/python-rapidjson/issues/62.\n\n## [0.9.1] - 2017-02-06\nTag name: v0.9.1\n\n### Fixed\n* Fixed bug in how the transaction `VERSION` string was calculated from the BigchainDB Server `__short_version__` string. [Pull Request #1160](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1160)\n\n\n## [0.9.0] - 2017-02-06\nTag name: v0.9.0\n\nIt has been more than two months since the v0.8.0 release, so there have been _many_ changes. We decided to describe them in broad strokes, with links to more details elsewhere.\n\n### Added\n- Support for MongoDB as a backend database.\n- Some configuration settings and `bigchaindb` command-line commands were added. In particular, one can specify the database backend (`rethinkdb` or `mongodb`). For MongoDB, one can specify the name of the replicaset. Also for MongoDB, there are new command-line commands to add and remove hosts from the replicaset. See [the Settings & CLI docs](https://docs.bigchaindb.com/projects/server/en/v0.9.0/server-reference/index.html).\n- Transaction schema validation. The transaction schema is also used to auto-generate some docs. [Pull Request #880](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/880)\n- Vote schema validation. The vote schema is also used to auto-generate some docs. [Pull Request #865](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/865)\n- New `ENABLE_WEB_ADMIN` setting in the AWS deployment configuration file. [Pull Request #1015](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1015)\n\n### Changed\n- The transaction model has changed substantially. @libscott wrote a blog post about the changes and it will be published soon on [the BigchainDB Blog](https://blog.bigchaindb.com/). Also, see [the docs about the transaction model](https://docs.bigchaindb.com/projects/server/en/v0.9.0/data-models/transaction-model.html).\n- The HTTP API has changed substantially. @diminator wrote a blog post about the changes and it will be published soon on [the BigchainDB Blog](https://blog.bigchaindb.com/).  Also, see [the docs about the vote model](https://docs.bigchaindb.com/projects/server/en/v0.9.0/data-models/vote-model.html).\n- All RethinkDB-specific database calls were replaced with abstract calls to a backend database.\n- Some improvements to the Dockerfile, e.g. Pull Requests [#1011](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1011) and [#1121](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1121)\n- Many improvements to the tests\n- We standardized on supporting Ubuntu 16.04 for now (but BigchainDB Server also works on similar Linux distros).\n\n### Removed\n- `api_endpoint` was removed from the BigchainDB configuration settings. (It was never used anyway.) [Pull Request #821](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/821)\n- Removed all remaining StatsD monitoring code, configuration settings, docs, etc. (We'll add another monitoring solution in the future.) [Pull Request #1138](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1138)\n\n### Fixed\n- Fixed a memory (RAM) overflow problem when under heavy load by bounding the size of the queue at the entrance to the block pipeline. [Pull Request #908](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/908)\n- Fixed some logic in block validation. [Pull Request #1130](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1130)\n\n### External Contributors\n- @amirelemam - [Pull Request #762](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/762) (closed but used as the basis for [Pull Request #1074](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1074))\n- @utarl - [Pull Request #1019](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1019)\n\n### Notes\n- There were many additions and changes to the documentation. Fun fact: The JSON in the HTTP API docs is now auto-generated to be consistent with the current code.\n- There's a draft spec for a BigchainDB Event Stream API and we welcome your feedback. See [Pull Request #1086](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/1086)\n\n\n## [0.8.2] - 2017-01-27\nTag name: v0.8.2\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix spend input twice in same transaction\n  (https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/issues/1099).\n\n\n## [0.8.1] - 2017-01-16\nTag name: v0.8.1\n\n### Changed\n- Upgrade pysha3 to 1.0.0 (supports official NIST standard).\n\n### Fixed\n- Workaround for rapidjson problem with package metadata extraction\n  (https://github.com/kenrobbins/python-rapidjson/pull/52).\n\n\n## [0.8.0] - 2016-11-29\nTag name: v0.8.0\n\n### Added\n- The big new thing in version 0.8.0 is support for divisible assets, i.e. assets like carrots or thumbtacks, where the initial CREATE transaction can register/create some amount (e.g. 542 carrots), the first TRANSFER transaction can split that amount across multiple owners, and so on. [Pull Request #794](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/794)\n- Wrote a formal schema for the JSON structure of transactions. [Pull Request #798](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/798)\n- New configuration parameter: `backlog_reassign_delay`. [Pull Request #883](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/883)\n\n### Changed\n- CREATE transactions must now be signed by all `owners_before` (rather than by a federation node). [Pull Request #794](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/794)\n- The user-provided timestamp was removed from the transaction data model (schema). [Pull Request #817](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/817)\n- `get_transaction()` will now return a transaction from the backlog, even if there are copies of the transaction in invalid blocks. [Pull Request #793](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/793)\n- Several pull requests to introduce a generalized database interface, to move RethinkDB calls into a separate implementation of that interface, and to work on a new MongoDB implementation of that interface. Pull Requests\n[#754](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/754),\n[#783](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/783),\n[#799](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/799),\n[#806](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/806),\n[#809](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/809),\n[#853](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/853)\n- Renamed \"verifying key\" to \"public key\". Renamed \"signing key\" to \"private key\". Renamed \"vk\" to \"pk\". [Pull Request #807](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/807)\n- `get_transaction_by_asset_id` now ignores invalid transactions. [Pull Request #810](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/810)\n- `get_transaction_by_metadata_id` now ignores invalid transactions. [Pull Request #811](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/811)\n- Updates to the configs and scripts for deploying a test network on AWS. The example config file deploys virtual machines running Ubuntu 16.04 now. Pull Requests\n[#771](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/771),\n[#813](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/813)\n- Changed logging of transactions on block creation so now it just says the length of the list of transactions, rather than listing all the transactions. [Pull Request #861](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/861)\n\n### Fixed\n- Equality checks with AssetLinks. [Pull Request #825](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/825)\n- Bug in `bigchaindb load`. [Pull Request #824](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/824)\n- Two issues found with timestamp indexes. [Pull Request #816](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/816)\n- Hard-coded `backlog_reassign_delay`. [Pull Request #854](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/854)\n- Race condition in `test_stale_monitor.py`. [Pull Request #846](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/846)\n- When creating a signed vote, decode the vote signature to a `str`. [Pull Request #869](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/869)\n- Bug in AWS deployment scripts. Setting `BIND_HTTP_TO_LOCALHOST` to `False` didn't actually work. It does now. [Pull Request #870](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/870)\n\n### External Contributors\n- @najlachamseddine - [Pull Request #528](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/528)\n- @ChristianGaertner - [Pull Request #659](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/659)\n- @MinchinWeb - [Pull Request #695](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/695)\n- @ckeyer - [Pull Request #785](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/785)\n\n### Notes\n- @ChristianGaertner added a Python style checker (Flake8) to Travis CI, so external contributors should be aware that the Python code in their pull requests will be checked.

The `Dockerfile` was updated to use this. [Pull Request #635](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/635)\n- The AWS deployment scripts now allow you to:\n   - specify the AWS security group as a configuration parameter: [Pull Request #620](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/620)\n   - tell RethinkDB to bind HTTP to localhost (a more secure setup; now the default in the example config file): [Pull Request #666](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/666)\n\n### Changed\n- Integrated the new `Transaction` model. This was a **big** change; 49 files changed. [Pull Request #641](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/641)\n- Merged \"common\" code (used by BigchainDB Server and the Python driver), which used to be in its own repository (`bigchaindb/bigchaindb-common`), into the main `bigchaindb/bigchaindb` repository (this one): [Pull Request #742](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/742)\n- Integrated the new digital asset model. This changed the data structure of a transaction and will make it easier to support divisible assets in the future. [Pull Request #680](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/680)\n- Transactions are now deleted from the `backlog` table _after_ a block containing them is written to the `bigchain` table: [Pull Request #609](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/609)\n- Changed the example AWS deployment configuration file: [Pull Request #665](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/665)\n- Support for version 0.5.0 of the `cryptoconditions` Python package. Note that this means you must now install `ffi.h` (e.g. `sudo apt-get install libffi-dev` on Ubuntu). See Pull Requests [#685](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/685) and [#698](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/698)\n- Updated some database access code: Pull Requests [#676](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/676) and [#701](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/701)\n\n### Fixed\n- Internally, when a transaction is in the `backlog` table, it carries some extra book-keeping fields:\n   1. an `assignment_timestamp` (i.e. the time when it was assigned to a node), which is used to determine if it has gone stale.\n   2. an `assignee`: the public key of the node it was assigned to.\n- The `assignment_timestamp` wasn't removed before writing the transaction to a block. That was fixed in [Pull Request #627](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/627)\n- The `assignment_timestamp` and `assignee` weren't removed in the response to an HTTP API request sent to the `/api/v1/transactions/<txid>` endpoint. That was fixed in [Pull Request #646](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/646)\n- When validating a TRANSFER transaction, if any fulfillment refers to a transaction that's _not_ in a valid block, then the transaction isn't valid. This wasn't checked before but it is now. [Pull Request #629](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/629)\n\n### External Contributors\n- @MinchinWeb - [Pull Request #696](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/pull/696)\n\n### Notes\n- We made a small change to how we do version labeling. Going forward, we will have the version label set to 0.X.Y.dev in the master branch as we work on what will eventually be released as version 0.X.Y. The version number will only be changed to 0.X.Y just before the release.

          "content": "<!---\nCopyright © 2020 Interplanetary Database Association e.V.,\nBigchainDB and IPDB software contributors.\nSPDX-License-Identifier: (Apache-2.0 AND CC-BY-4.0)\nCode is Apache-2.0 and docs are CC-BY-4.0\n--->\n\n# Python Style Guide\n\nThis guide starts out with our general Python coding style guidelines and ends with a section on how we write & run (Python) tests.\n\n## General Python Coding Style Guidelines\n\nOur starting point is [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), the standard \"Style Guide for Python Code.\" Many Python IDEs will check your code against PEP8. (Note that PEP8 isn't frozen; it actually changes over time, but slowly.)\n\nBigchainDB uses Python 3.5+, so you can ignore all PEP8 guidelines specific to Python 2.\n\nWe use [pre-commit](http://pre-commit.com/) to check some of the rules below before every commit but not everything is realized yet.\nThe hooks we use can be found in the [.pre-commit-config.yaml](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/blob/master/.pre-commit-config.yaml) file.\n\n### Python Docstrings\n\nPEP8 says some things about docstrings, but not what to put in them or how to structure them. [PEP257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) was one proposal for docstring conventions, but we prefer [Google-style docstrings](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html?showone=Comments#Comments) instead: they're easier to read and the [napoleon extension](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/ext/napoleon.html) for Sphinx lets us turn them into nice-looking documentation. Here are some references on Google-style docstrings:\n\n* [Google's docs on Google-style docstrings](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html?showone=Comments#Comments)\n* [napoleon's docs include an overview of Google-style docstrings](http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html)\n* [Example Google-style docstrings](http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.org/en/latest/example_google.html) (from napoleon's docs)\n\n### Maximum Line Length\n\nPEP8 has some [maximum line length guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#id17), starting with \"Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters\" but \"for flowing long blocks of text with fewer structural restrictions (docstrings or comments), the line length should be limited to 72 characters.\"\n\nWe discussed this at length, and it seems that the consensus is: _try_ to keep line lengths less than 79/72 characters, unless you have a special situation where longer lines would improve readability. (The basic reason is that 79/72 works for everyone, and BigchainDB is an open source project.) As a hard limit, keep all lines less than 119 characters (which is the width of GitHub code review).\n\n### Single or Double Quotes?\n\nPython lets you use single or double quotes. PEP8 says you can use either, as long as you're consistent. We try to stick to using single quotes, except in cases where using double quotes is more readable. For example:\n```python\nprint('This doesn\\'t look so nice.')\nprint(\"Doesn't this look nicer?\")\n```\n\n### Breaking Strings Across Multiple Lines\n\nShould we use parentheses or slashes (`\\`) to break strings across multiple lines, i.e.\n```python\nmy_string = ('This is a very long string, so long that it will not fit into just one line '\n             'so it must be split across multiple lines.')\n# or\nmy_string = 'This is a very long string, so long that it will not fit into just one line ' \\\n            'so it must be split across multiple lines.'\n```\n\nIt seems the preference is for slashes, but using parentheses is okay too. (There are good arguments either way. Arguing about it seems like a waste of time.)\n\n### How to Format Long import Statements\n\nIf you need to `import` lots of names from a module or package, and they won't all fit in one line (without making the line too long), then use parentheses to spread the names across multiple lines, like so:\n```python\nfrom Tkinter import (\n    Tk, Frame, Button, Entry, Canvas, Text,\n    LEFT, DISABLED, NORMAL, RIDGE, END,\n)\n\n# Or\n\nfrom Tkinter import (Tk, Frame, Button, Entry, Canvas, Text,\n                     LEFT, DISABLED, NORMAL, RIDGE, END)\n```\n\nFor the rationale, see [PEP 328](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0328/#rationale-for-parentheses).\n\n### Using the % operator or `format()` to Format Strings\n\nGiven the choice:\n```python\nx = 'name: %s; score: %d' % (name, n)\n# or\nx = 'name: {}; score: {}'.format(name, n)\n```\n\nwe use the `format()` version. The [official Python documentation says](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#str.format), \"This method of string formatting is the new standard in Python 3, and should be preferred to the % formatting described in String Formatting Operations in new code.\"\n\n\n## Running the Flake8 Style Checker\n\nWe use [Flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/index.html) to check our Python code style. Once you have it installed, you can run it using:\n```text\nflake8 --max-line-length 119 bigchaindb/\n```\n\n\n## Writing and Running (Python) Tests\n\nThe content of this section was moved to [`bigchaindb/tests/README.md`](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/blob/master/tests/README.md).\n\nNote: We automatically run all tests on all pull requests (using Travis CI), so you should definitely run all tests locally before you submit a pull request. See the above-linked README file for instructions.\n"

For example, the Git tag for version `2.0.0a1` was `v2.0.0a1`.\n\n**Note 2:** For Docker image tags (e.g. on Docker Hub), we use longer version names for Alpha, Beta and Release Candidate releases. For example, the Docker image tag for version `2.0.0a2` was `2.0.0-alpha2`.\n\nWe use `0.9` and `0.9.0` as example version and short-version values below. You should replace those with the correct values for your new version.\n\nWe follow [BEP-1](https://github.com/bigchaindb/BEPs/tree/master/1), which is our variant of C4, the Collective Code Construction Contract, so a release is just a [tagged commit](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging) on the `master` branch, i.e. a label for a particular Git commit.\n\nThe following steps are what we do to release a new version of _BigchainDB Server_. The steps to release the Python Driver are similar but not the same.\n\n## Steps\n\n1. Create a pull request where you make the following changes:\n\n   - Update `CHANGELOG.md`\n   - Update all Docker image tags in all Kubernetes YAML files (in the `k8s/` directory).\n     For example, in the files:\n\n     - `k8s/bigchaindb/bigchaindb-ss.yaml` and\n     - `k8s/dev-setup/bigchaindb.yaml`\n\n     find the line of the form `image: bigchaindb/bigchaindb:0.8.1` and change the version number to the new version number, e.g. `0.9.0`. (This is the Docker image that Kubernetes should pull from Docker Hub.)\n     Keep in mind that this is a _Docker image tag_ so our naming convention is\n     a bit different; see Note 2 in the **Notes** section above.\n   - In `bigchaindb/version.py`:\n     - update `__version__` to e.g. `0.9.0` (with no `.dev` on the end)\n     - update `__short_version__` to e.g. `0.9` (with no `.dev` on the end)\n   - In the docs about installing BigchainDB (and Tendermint), and in the associated scripts, recommend/install a version of Tendermint that _actually works_ with the soon-to-be-released version of BigchainDB. You can find all such references by doing a search for the previously-recommended version number, such as `0.31.5`.\n   - In `setup.py`, _maybe_ update the development status item in the `classifiers` list. For example, one allowed value is `\"Development Status :: 5 - Production/Stable\"`. The [allowed values are listed at pypi.python.org](https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=list_classifiers).\n\n2. **Wait for all the tests to pass!**\n3. Merge the pull request into the `master` branch.\n4. Go to the [bigchaindb/bigchaindb Releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/bigchaindb/bigchaindb/releases)\n   and click the \"Draft a new release\" button.\n5. Fill in the details:\n   - **Tag version:** version number preceded by `v`, e.g. `v0.9.1`\n   - **Target:** the last commit that was just merged. In other words, that commit will get a Git tag with the value given for tag version above.\n   - **Title:** Same as tag version above, e.g `v0.9.1`\n   - **Description:** The body of the changelog entry (Added, Changed, etc.)\n6. Click \"Publish release\" to publish the release on GitHub.\n7. On your local computer, make sure you're on the `master` branch and that it's up-to-date with the `master` branch in the bigchaindb/bigchaindb repository (e.g. `git pull upstream master`). We're going to use that to push a new `bigchaindb` package to PyPI.\n8. Make sure you have a `~/.pypirc` file containing credentials for PyPI.\n9. Do `make release` to build and publish the new `bigchaindb` package on PyPI. For this step you need to have `twine` installed. If you get an error like `Makefile:135: recipe for target 'clean-pyc' failed` then try doing\n   ```text\n   sudo chown -R $(whoami):$(whoami) .\n   ```\n10. [Log in to readthedocs.org](https://readthedocs.org/accounts/login/) and go to the **BigchainDB Server** project, then:\n   - Click on \"Builds\", select \"latest\" from the drop-down menu, then click the \"Build Version:\" button.\n   - Wait for the build of \"latest\" to finish. This can take a few minutes.\n   - Go to Admin --> Advanced Settings\n     and make sure that \"Default branch:\" (i.e. what \"latest\" points to)\n     is set to the new release's tag, e.g. `v0.9.1`.\n     (It won't be an option if you didn't wait for the build of \"latest\" to finish.)\n     Then scroll to the bottom and click \"Save\".\n   - Go to Admin --> Versions\n     and under **Choose Active Versions**, do these things:\n     1. Make sure that the new version's tag is \"Active\" and \"Public\"\n     2. Make sure the **stable** branch is _not_ active.\n     3. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click \"Save\".\n11. Go to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) and sign in, then:\n   - Click on \"Organizations\"\n   - Click on \"bigchaindb\"\n   - Click on \"bigchaindb/bigchaindb\"\n   - Click on \"Build Settings\"\n   - Find the row where \"Docker Tag Name\" equals `latest`\n     and change the value of \"Name\" to the name (Git tag)\n     of the new release, e.g. `v0.9.0`.\n   - If the release is an Alpha, Beta or Release Candidate release,\n     then a new row must be added.\n     You can do that by clicking the green \"+\" (plus) icon.\n     The contents of the new row should be similar to the existing rows\n     of previous releases like that.\n   - Click on \"Tags\"\n   - Delete the \"latest\" tag (so we can rebuild it)\n   - Click on \"Build Settings\" again\n   - Click on the \"Trigger\" button for the \"latest\" tag and make sure it worked by clicking on \"Tags\" again\n   - If the release is an Alpha, Beta or Release Candidate release,\n     then click on the \"Trigger\" button for that tag as well.\n\nCongratulations, you have released a new version of BigchainDB Server!\n"
