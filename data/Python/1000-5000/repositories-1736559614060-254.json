In all three outputs, the first dimension represents the shape and the second dimension indexes the list of detections.\n\nLoading models can be done in the following manner:\n```python\nfrom keras_retinanet.models import load_model\nmodel = load_model('/path/to/model.h5', backbone_name='resnet50')\n```\n\nExecution time on NVIDIA Pascal Titan X is roughly 75msec for an image of shape `1000x800x3`.\n\n### Converting a training model to inference model\nThe training procedure of `keras-retinanet` works with *training models*. These are stripped down versions compared to the *inference model* and only contains the layers necessary for training (regression and classification values). If you wish to do inference on a model (perform object detection on an image), you need to convert the trained model to an inference model. This is done as follows:\n\n```shell\n# Running directly from the repository:\nkeras_retinanet/bin/convert_model.py /path/to/training/model.h5 /path/to/save/inference/model.h5\n\n# Using the installed script:\nretinanet-convert-model /path/to/training/model.h5 /path/to/save/inference/model.h5\n```\n\nMost scripts (like `retinanet-evaluate`) also support converting on the fly, using the `--convert-model` argument.\n\n\n## Training\n`keras-retinanet` can be trained using [this](https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet/blob/master/keras_retinanet/bin/train.py) script.\nNote that the train script uses relative imports since it is inside the `keras_retinanet` package.\nIf you want to adjust the script for your own use outside of this repository,\nyou will need to switch it to use absolute imports.\n\nIf you installed `keras-retinanet` correctly, the train script will be installed as `retinanet-train`.\nHowever, if you make local modifications to the `keras-retinanet` repository, you should run the script directly from the repository.\nThat will ensure that your local changes will be used by the train script.\n\nThe default backbone is `resnet50`. You can change this using the `--backbone=xxx` argument in the running script.\n`xxx` can be one of the backbones in resnet models (`resnet50`, `resnet101`, `resnet152`), mobilenet models (`mobilenet128_1.0`, `mobilenet128_0.75`, `mobilenet160_1.0`, etc), densenet models or vgg models. The different options are defined by each model in their corresponding python scripts (`resnet.py`, `mobilenet.py`, etc).\n\nTrained models can't be used directly for inference. To convert a trained model to an inference model, check [here](https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet#converting-a-training-model-to-inference-model).\n\n### Usage\nFor training on [Pascal VOC](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/), run:\n```shell\n# Running directly from the repository:\nkeras_retinanet/bin/train.py pascal /path/to/VOCdevkit/VOC2007\n\n# Using the installed script:\nretinanet-train pascal /path/to/VOCdevkit/VOC2007\n```\n\nFor training on [MS COCO](http://cocodataset.org/#home), run:\n```shell\n# Running directly from the repository:\nkeras_retinanet/bin/train.py coco /path/to/MS/COCO\n\n# Using the installed script:\nretinanet-train coco /path/to/MS/COCO\n```\n\nFor training on Open Images Dataset [OID](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html)\nor taking place to the [OID challenges](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/challenge.html), run:\n```shell\n# Running directly from the repository:\nkeras_retinanet/bin/train.py oid /path/to/OID\n\n# Using the installed script:\nretinanet-train oid /path/to/OID\n\n# You can also specify a list of labels if you want to train on a subset\n# by adding the argument 'labels_filter':\nkeras_retinanet/bin/train.py oid /path/to/OID --labels-filter=Helmet,Tree\n\n# You can also specify a parent label if you want to train on a branch\n# from the semantic hierarchical tree (i.e a parent and all children)\n(https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/challenge_2018/bbox_labels_500_hierarchy_visualizer/circle.html)\n# by adding the argument 'parent-label':\nkeras_retinanet/bin/train.py oid /path/to/OID --parent-label=Boat\n```\n\n\nFor training on [KITTI](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_object.php), run:\n```shell\n# Running directly from the repository:\nkeras_retinanet/bin/train.py kitti /path/to/KITTI\n\n# Using the installed script:\nretinanet-train kitti /path/to/KITTI\n\nIf you want to prepare the dataset you can use the following script:\nhttps://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/blob/master/examples/object-detection/prepare_kitti_data.py\n```\n\n\nFor training on a [custom dataset], a CSV file can be used as a way to pass the data.\nSee below for more details on the format of these CSV files.\nTo train using your CSV, run:\n```shell\n# Running directly from the repository:\nkeras_retinanet/bin/train.py csv /path/to/csv/file/containing/annotations /path/to/csv/file/containing/classes\n\n# Using the installed script:\nretinanet-train csv /path/to/csv/file/containing/annotations /path/to/csv/file/containing/classes\n```\n\nIn general, the steps to train on your own datasets are:\n1) Create a model by calling for instance `keras_retinanet.models.backbone('resnet50').retinanet(num_classes=80)` and compile it.\n   Empirically, the following compile arguments have been found to work well:\n```python\nmodel.compile(\n    loss={\n        'regression'    : keras_retinanet.losses.smooth_l1(),\n        'classification': keras_retinanet.losses.focal()\n    },\n    optimizer=keras.optimizers.Adam(lr=1e-5, clipnorm=0.001)\n)\n```\n2) Create generators for training and testing data (an example is show in [`keras_retinanet.preprocessing.pascal_voc.PascalVocGenerator`](https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet/blob/master/keras_retinanet/preprocessing/pascal_voc.py)).\n3) Use `model.fit_generator` to

ResNet152 trained on all [500 classes](https://github.com/ZFTurbo/Keras-RetinaNet-for-Open-Images-Challenge-2018/blob/master/a00_utils_and_constants.py#L130) of the Open Images Dataset (thanks to @ZFTurbo).\n\n| Backbone  | Image Size (px) | Small validation mAP | LB (Public) |\n| --------- | --------------- | -------------------- | ----------- |\n| ResNet50  | 768 - 1024      | 0.4594               | 0.4223      |\n| ResNet101 | 768 - 1024      | 0.4986               | 0.4520      |\n| ResNet152 | 600 - 800       | 0.4991               | 0.4651      |\n\nFor more information, check [@ZFTurbo's](https://github.com/ZFTurbo/Keras-RetinaNet-for-Open-Images-Challenge-2018) repository.\n\n## CSV datasets\nThe `CSVGenerator` provides an easy way to define your own datasets.\nIt uses two CSV files: one file containing annotations and one file containing a class name to ID mapping.\n\n### Annotations format\nThe CSV file with annotations should contain one annotation per line.\nImages with multiple bounding boxes should use one row per bounding box.\nNote that indexing for pixel values starts at 0.\nThe expected format of each line is:\n```\npath/to/image.jpg,x1,y1,x2,y2,class_name\n```\nBy default the CSV generator will look for images relative to the directory of the annotations file.\n\nSome images may not contain any labeled objects.\nTo add these images to the dataset as negative examples,\nadd an annotation where `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` and `class_name` are all empty:\n```\npath/to/image.jpg,,,,,\n```\n\nA full example:\n```\n/data/imgs/img_001.jpg,837,346,981,456,cow\n/data/imgs/img_002.jpg,215,312,279,391,cat\n/data/imgs/img_002.jpg,22,5,89,84,bird\n/data/imgs/img_003.jpg,,,,,\n```\n\nThis defines a dataset with 3 images.\n`img_001.jpg` contains a cow.\n`img_002.jpg` contains a cat and a bird.\n`img_003.jpg` contains no interesting objects/animals.\n\n\n### Class mapping format\nThe class name to ID mapping file should contain one mapping per line.\nEach line should use the following format:\n```\nclass_name,id\n```\n\nIndexing for classes starts at 0.\nDo not include a background class as it is implicit.\n\nFor example:\n```\ncow,0\ncat,1\nbird,2\n```\n\n## Anchor optimization\n\nIn some cases, the default anchor configuration is not suitable for detecting objects in your dataset, for example, if your objects are smaller than the 32x32px (size of the smallest anchors). In this case, it might be suitable to modify the anchor configuration, this can be done automatically by following the steps in the [anchor-optimization](https://github.com/martinzlocha/anchor-optimization/) repository. To use the generated configuration check [here](https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet-test-data/blob/master/config/config.ini) for an example config file and then pass it to `train.py` using the `--config` parameter.\n\n## Debugging\nCreating your own dataset does not always work out of the box. There is a [`debug.py`](https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet/blob/master/keras_retinanet/bin/debug.py) tool to help find the most common mistakes.\n\nParticularly helpful is the `--annotations` flag which displays your annotations on the images from your dataset. Annotations are colored in green when there are anchors available and colored in red when there are no anchors available. If an annotation doesn't have anchors available, it means it won't contribute to training. It is normal for a small amount of annotations to show up in red, but if most or all annotations are red there is cause for concern. The most common issues are that the annotations are too small or too oddly shaped (stretched out).\n\n## Results\n\n### MS COCO\n\n## Status\nExample output images using `keras-retinanet` are shown below.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://github.com/delftrobotics/keras-retinanet/blob/master/images/coco1.png\" alt=\"Example result of RetinaNet on MS COCO\"/>\n  <img src=\"https://github.com/delftrobotics/keras-retinanet/blob/master/images/coco2.png\" alt=\"Example result of RetinaNet on MS COCO\"/>\n  <img src=\"https://github.com/delftrobotics/keras-retinanet/blob/master/images/coco3.png\" alt=\"Example result of RetinaNet on MS COCO\"/>\n</p>\n\n### Projects using keras-retinanet\n* [Improving Apple Detection and Counting Using RetinaNet](https://github.com/nikostsagk/Apple-detection).

Compile it manually.`, should I be worried?** This warning can safely be ignored during inference.\n* **I get the error `ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 3, got 2)` during inference, what to do?**. This is because you are using a train model to do inference. See https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet#converting-a-training-model-to-inference-model for more information.\n* **How do I do transfer learning?** The easiest solution is to use the `--weights` argument when training. Keras will load models, even if the number of classes don't match (it will simply skip loading of weights when there is a mismatch). Run for example `retinanet-train --weights snapshots/some_coco_model.h5 pascal /path/to/pascal` to transfer weights from a COCO model to a PascalVOC training session. If your dataset is small, you can also use the `--freeze-backbone` argument to freeze the backbone layers.\n* **How do I change the number / shape of the anchors?** The train tool allows to pass a configuration file, where the anchor parameters can be adjusted. Check [here](https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet-test-data/blob/master/config/config.ini) for an example config file.\n* **I get a loss of `0`, what is going on?** This mostly happens when none of the anchors \"fit\" on your objects, because they are most likely too small or elongated. You can verify this using the [debug](https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet#debugging) tool.\n* **I have an older model, can I use it after an update of keras-retinanet?** This depends on what has changed. If it is a change that doesn't affect the weights then you can \"update\" models by creating a new retinanet model, loading your old weights using `model.load_weights(weights_path, by_name=True)` and saving this model. If the change has been too significant, you should retrain your model (you can try to load in the weights from your old model when starting training, this might be a better starting position than ImageNet).\n* **I get the error `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'keras_retinanet.utils.compute_overlap'`, how do I fix this?** Most likely you are running the code from the cloned repository. This is fine, but you need to compile some extensions for this to work (`python setup.py build_ext --inplace`).\n* **How do I train on my own dataset?** The steps to train on your dataset are roughly as follows:\n* 1. Prepare your dataset in the CSV format (a training and validation split is advised).\n* 2. Check that your dataset is correct using `retinanet-debug`.\n* 3. Train retinanet, preferably using the pretrained COCO weights (this gives a **far** better starting point, making training much quicker and accurate). You can optionally perform evaluation of your validation set during training to keep track of how well it performs (advised).\n* 4. Convert your training model to an inference model.\n* 5. Evaluate your inference model on your test or validation set.\n* 6. Profit!\n"
