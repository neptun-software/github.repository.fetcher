Otherwise, you can just ignore this step.\n\n``` sh\n# runtime build requires cmake 3.14 or above\ncd runtime/libtorch\nmkdir build && cd build && cmake -DGRAPH_TOOLS=ON .. && cmake --build .\n```\n\nPlease see [doc](https://github.com/wenet-e2e/wenet/tree/main/runtime) for building\nruntime on more platforms and OS.\n\n\n## Discussion & Communication\n\nYou can directly discuss on [Github Issues](https://github.com/wenet-e2e/wenet/issues).\n\nFor Chinese users, you can also scan the QR code on the left to follow our official account of WeNet.\nWe created a WeChat group for better discussion and quicker response.\nPlease scan the personal QR code on the right, and the guy is responsible for inviting you to the chat group.\n\n| <img src=\"https://github.com/robin1001/qr/blob/master/wenet.jpeg\" width=\"250px\"> | <img src=\"https://github.com/robin1001/qr/blob/master/binbin.jpeg\" width=\"250px\"> |\n| ---- | ---- |\n\n\n## Acknowledge\n\n1.
