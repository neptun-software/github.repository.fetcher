Adding this file fixes many problems like YouTube watch history, videos on news sites and so on. If you want to report additional domain feel free to file an [issue](https://github.com/anudeepND/whitelist/issues). | Occasionally | [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anudeepND/whitelist/master/domains/whitelist.txt) |\n| referral-sites.txt | 75 | People who use services like Slickdeals and Fatwallet needs a few sites (most of  them are either trackers or ads) to be whitelisted to work properly. This file contains some analytics and ad serving sites like __doubleclick.net__ and others. __If you don't know what these services are, stay away from this list.__ | Occasionally | [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anudeepND/whitelist/master/domains/referral-sites.txt) |\n| optional-list.txt | -- | This file contain domains that are needed to be whitelisted depending on the service you use. It may contain some tracking site but sometimes it's necessary to add bad domains to make a few services to work. Currently there is no script for this list, you have to add domains manually to your Pi-Hole. | Occasionally | [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anudeepND/whitelist/master/domains/optional-list.txt) |\n\n\n## <ins>Installation</ins>\n\n Make sure you have __python3__ installed on your machine. You can simply install it by using `sudo apt install python3`\n\n#### For whitelist.txt\n\n```Shell\ngit clone https://github.com/anudeepND/whitelist.git\nsudo python3 whitelist/scripts/whitelist.py\n```\n\n#### For referral-sites.txt\n\n```Shell\ngit clone https://github.com/anudeepND/whitelist.git\ncd whitelist/scripts\nsudo ./referral.sh\n```\n\nIf you are using Pi-hole 5.0 or later, the comment field has a unique string - `qjz9zk` to uniquely identify the domains added by this script so the user can remove the domains without affecting other whitelisted sites.\n\n#### For optional-list.txt\nYou can add it manually depending upon the service you use.\n\n#### For Docker installation (with Python3 support)\n\n Access you running Pi-Hole container by `docker exec -it <container-ID> bash` and proceed with the steps given below:\n\n```Shell\ngit clone https://github.com/anudeepND/whitelist.git\nsudo python3 whitelist/scripts/whitelist.py\n```\n\n```Shell\ngit clone https://github.com/anudeepND/whitelist.git\ncd whitelist/scripts\nsudo ./referral.sh\n```\n\n#### For Docker installation (without Python3 support) or /etc/pihole on different directory\n\n You can pass two optional arguments to whitelist.py, uninstall.py, and referral.sh:\n\n```Text\n -d or --dir to specify the Pi-hole etc directory (in normal install should be /etc/pihole)\n -D or --docker to specify if Pi-hole is running as Docker container\n ```\n\n```Shell\ngit clone https://github.com/anudeepND/whitelist.git\nsudo python3 whitelist/scripts/whitelist.py --dir /home/docker/pihole/etc-pihole/ --docker\n```\n\n```Shell\ngit clone https://github.com/anudeepND/whitelist.git\ncd whitelist/scripts\nsudo ./referral.sh --dir /home/docker/pihole/etc-pihole/ --docker\n```\n__Note: You don't have to clone the repo every time you need to update whitelist file. Navigate to `whitelist/scripts` and run it again `sudo python3 whitelist.py__\n\n## <ins>Uninstall</ins>\n\n![Whitelist uninstall demo gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anudeepND/whitelist/master/images/uninstall.gif)\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the unique string (`qjz9zk`) will come in handy while removing the domains from the database. It uses LIKE operator of the SQLite to match the wildcard string present in the comment section.\n\n```SQL\nDELETE FROM domainlist WHERE type = 0 AND comment LIKE '%qjz9zk%'\n```\n\nThis statement will remove the domain only if it is present in the exact whitelist section and having the string `qjz9zk`. Domains in the regex list will not be removed by this script.\n\nThe older version of the Pi-hole uses a simple text file to store the entries. In this case the script will match the domains present in your Pi-hole to the domains present in the GitHub repo and removes them accordingly.\n\n__To remove the domains:__\n`sudo python3 uninstall.py`\n\n\n## <ins>Automated Update</ins>\n\n```Shell\ncd /opt/\nsudo git clone https://github.com/anudeepND/whitelist.git\n```\n\nMake the script to run the script at 1AM on the last day of the week\n\n```Shell\nsudo nano /etc/crontab\n```\n\nAdd this line at the end of the file:\n\n```Text\n0 1 * * */7     root    /opt/whitelist/scripts/whitelist.py\n```\n\nCTRL + X then Y and Enter\n\n```Shell\nsudo python3 whitelist/scripts/whitelist.py\n```\n\n## <ins>How do I determine an ad domain?</ins>\n- __Adam:ONE Assistant (formerly DNSthingy Assistant):__ <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adamone-assistant/fdmpekabnlekabjlimjkfmdjajnddgpc\">This browser extension</a> will list all of the domains that are queried when a web page is loaded. You can often look at the list of domains and cherry pick the ones that appear to be ad-serving domains.\n- __Using inbuilt Developer tool:__ For Chrome and Firefox, __`ctrl+shift+I`__ will land you in Developer tools menu.\n- __Using an Android app:__ [__`Net Guard`__](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.faircode.netguard) is an Android app that can be used to monitor any specific apps, works on unrooted devices too.\n\n\n## <ins>Stargazers over time</ins>\n<br />\n\n[![Stargazers over time](https://starchart.cc/anudeepND/whitelist.svg)](https://starchart.cc/anudeepND/whitelist)\n\n## <ins>Support</ins>\nMaintaining an quality open-source takes a lot of time. I have been contributing to this project over 3 years. Your support will help me to keep the project running and provide you quality service. You can also donate using UPI enabled apps such as __`PhonePe`__, __`Google Pay`__, __`Paytm`__ and more! (UPI ID: anudeepnd@ybl).
