Code for \"Language models generalize beyond natural proteins\" is under [examples/lm-design/](examples/lm-design/). Code for \"A high-level programming language for generative protein design\" is under [examples/protein-programming-language/](examples/protein-programming-language/).\n\nThis repository contains code and pre-trained weights for **Transformer protein language models** from the Meta Fundamental AI Research Protein Team (FAIR), including our state-of-the-art [**ESM-2** and **ESMFold**](#esmfold), as well as [**MSA Transformer**](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.12.430858v1), [**ESM-1v**](#zs_variant) for predicting variant effects and [**ESM-IF1**](#invf) for inverse folding.\nTransformer protein language models were introduced in the [2019 preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/622803) of the paper [\"Biological structure and function emerge from scaling unsupervised learning to 250 million protein sequences\"](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2016239118).\nESM-2 outperforms all tested single-sequence protein language models across a range of structure prediction tasks.\nESMFold harnesses the ESM-2 language model to generate accurate structure predictions end to end directly from the sequence of a protein.\n\nIn November 2022, we released `v0` of the [ESM Metagenomic Atlas](https://esmatlas.com), an open atlas of 617 million predicted metagenomic protein structures.\nThe Atlas was updated in March 2023 in collaboration with EBI. The new `v2023_02` adds another 150 million predicted structures to the Atlas, as well as pre-computed ESM2 embeddings.\nBulk download, blog post and the resources provided on the Atlas website are documented [on this README](#atlas).\n\nIn December 2022, we released two simultaneous preprints on protein design.\n* \"Language models generalize beyond natural proteins\" ([PAPER](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.12.21.521521), [CODE](examples/lm-design/)) uses ESM2 to design de novo proteins.

Openfold installation requires `nvcc`.\n\n```bash\npip install \"fair-esm[esmfold]\"\n# OpenFold and its remaining dependency\npip install 'dllogger @ git+https://github.com/NVIDIA/dllogger.git'\npip install 'openfold @ git+https://github.com/aqlaboratory/openfold.git@4b41059694619831a7db195b7e0988fc4ff3a307'\n```\n\n**NOTE**: If openfold installation fails, please double check that `nvcc` is available and that a cuda-compatable version of PyTorch has been installed.\n\nAlternatively, we provide the `esmfold` conda environment, which can be built via `conda env create -f environment.yml`.\n\nWe also support PyTorch Hub, which removes the need to clone and/or install this repository yourself:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nmodel, alphabet = torch.hub.load(\"facebookresearch/esm:main\", \"esm2_t33_650M_UR50D\")\n```\n\nAfter pip install, you can load and use a pretrained model as follows:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport esm\n\n# Load ESM-2 model\nmodel, alphabet = esm.pretrained.esm2_t33_650M_UR50D()\nbatch_converter = alphabet.get_batch_converter()\nmodel.eval()  # disables dropout for deterministic results\n\n# Prepare data (first 2 sequences from ESMStructuralSplitDataset superfamily / 4)\ndata = [\n    (\"protein1\", \"MKTVRQERLKSIVRILERSKEPVSGAQLAEELSVSRQVIVQDIAYLRSLGYNIVATPRGYVLAGG\"),\n    (\"protein2\", \"KALTARQQEVFDLIRDHISQTGMPPTRAEIAQRLGFRSPNAAEEHLKALARKGVIEIVSGASRGIRLLQEE\"),\n    (\"protein2 with mask\",\"KALTARQQEVFDLIRD<mask>ISQTGMPPTRAEIAQRLGFRSPNAAEEHLKALARKGVIEIVSGASRGIRLLQEE\"),\n    (\"protein3\",  \"K A <mask> I S Q\"),\n]\nbatch_labels, batch_strs, batch_tokens = batch_converter(data)\nbatch_lens = (batch_tokens != alphabet.padding_idx).sum(1)\n\n# Extract per-residue representations (on CPU)\nwith torch.no_grad():\n    results = model(batch_tokens, repr_layers=[33], return_contacts=True)\ntoken_representations = results[\"representations\"][33]\n\n# Generate per-sequence representations via averaging\n# NOTE: token 0 is always a beginning-of-sequence token, so the first residue is token 1.\nsequence_representations = []\nfor i, tokens_len in enumerate(batch_lens):\n    sequence_representations.append(token_representations[i, 1 : tokens_len - 1].mean(0))\n\n# Look at the unsupervised self-attention map contact predictions\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfor (_, seq), tokens_len, attention_contacts in zip(data, batch_lens, results[\"contacts\"]):\n    plt.matshow(attention_contacts[: tokens_len, : tokens_len])\n    plt.title(seq)\n    plt.show()\n```\n\n\n### ESMFold Structure Prediction <a name=\"esmfold\"></a>\n\nAfter installing with the `[esmfold]` option, you can use the ESMFold structure prediction model as follows:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport esm\n\nmodel = esm.pretrained.esmfold_v1()\nmodel = model.eval().cuda()\n\n# Optionally, uncomment to set a chunk size for axial attention. This can help reduce memory.\n# Lower sizes will have lower memory requirements at the cost of increased speed.\n# model.set_chunk_size(128)\n\nsequence = \"MKTVRQERLKSIVRILERSKEPVSGAQLAEELSVSRQVIVQDIAYLRSLGYNIVATPRGYVLAGG\"\n# Multimer prediction can be done with chains separated by ':'\n\nwith torch.no_grad():\n    output = model.infer_pdb(sequence)\n\nwith open(\"result.pdb\", \"w\") as f:\n    f.write(output)\n\nimport biotite.structure.io as bsio\nstruct = bsio.load_structure(\"result.pdb\", extra_fields=[\"b_factor\"])\nprint(struct.b_factor.mean())  # this will be the pLDDT\n# 88.3\n```\n\n\nBesides `esm.pretrained.esmfold_v1()` which is the best performing model we recommend using, we\nalso provide `esm.pretrained.esmfold_v0()` which was used for the experiments in\n[Lin et al. 2022](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.ade2574).\n\nWe also provide a command line interface (`esm-fold`) that efficiently predicts structures in bulk from a FASTA file using ESMFold:\n```\nusage: esm-fold [-h] -i FASTA -o PDB [--num-recycles NUM_RECYCLES]\n                [--max-tokens-per-batch MAX_TOKENS_PER_BATCH]\n                [--chunk-size CHUNK_SIZE] [--cpu-only] [--cpu-offload]\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  -i FASTA, --fasta FASTA\n                        Path to input FASTA file\n  -o PDB, --pdb PDB     Path to output PDB directory\n  --num-recycles NUM_RECYCLES\n                        Number of recycles to run. Defaults to number used in\n                        training (4).\n  --max-tokens-per-batch MAX_TOKENS_PER_BATCH\n                        Maximum number of tokens per gpu forward-pass. This\n                        will group shorter sequences together for batched\n                        prediction. Lowering this can help with out of memory\n                        issues, if these occur on short sequences.\n  --chunk-size CHUNK_SIZE\n                        Chunks axial attention computation to reduce memory\n                        usage from O(L^2) to O(L). Equivalent to running a for\n                        loop over chunks of of each dimension. Lower values\n                        will result in lower memory usage at the cost of\n                        speed. Recommended values: 128, 64, 32. Default: None.\n  --cpu-only            CPU only\n  --cpu-offload         Enable CPU offloading\n```\n\nThe command will make one prediction for every sequence in the fasta file. Multimers can be predicted and should be entered in the fasta file as a single sequence, with chains seprated by a \":\" character.\n\nBy default, predictions will be batched together so that shorter sequences are predicted simultaneously. This can be disabled by setting `--max-tokens-per-batch=0`. Batching can significantly improve prediction speed on shorter sequences.\n\nThe `--cpu-offload` flag can be useful for making predictions on longer sequences. It will attempt to offload some parameters to the CPU RAM, rather than storing on GPU.\n\nFinally, the ablation experiments for LMs of varying sizes [Lin et al. 2022 table S1](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.ade2574) are released as `esm.pretrained.esmfold_structure_module_only_*()`. We don't recommend using these models for structure prediction.\n\n\n### Compute embeddings in bulk from FASTA <a name=\"bulk_fasta\"></a>\n\nWe provide a command line interface (`esm-extract`) that efficiently extracts embeddings in bulk for a FASTA file from the ESM:\n```\nusage: esm-extract [-h] [--toks_per_batch TOKS_PER_BATCH]\n                   [--repr_layers REPR_LAYERS [REPR_LAYERS ...]] --include\n                   {mean,per_tok,bos,contacts}\n                   [{mean,per_tok,bos,contacts} ...]\n                   [--truncation_seq_length TRUNCATION_SEQ_LENGTH]\n                   model_location fasta_file output_dir\n\nExtract per-token representations and model outputs for sequences in a FASTA\nfile\n\npositional arguments:\n  model_location        PyTorch model file OR name of pretrained model to\n                        download (see README for models)\n  fasta_file            FASTA file on which to extract representations\n  output_dir            output directory for extracted representations\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  --toks_per_batch TOKS_PER_BATCH\n                        maximum batch size\n  --repr_layers REPR_LAYERS [REPR_LAYERS ...]\n                        layers indices from which to extract representations\n                        (0 to num_layers, inclusive)\n  --include {mean,per_tok,bos,contacts} [{mean,per_tok,bos,contacts} ...]\n                        specify which representations to return\n  --truncation_seq_length TRUNCATION_SEQ_LENGTH\n                        truncate sequences longer than the given value\n```\n\nThe following commands allow the extraction of the final-layer embedding for a FASTA file from the ESM-2 model:\n\n```bash\nesm-extract esm2_t33_650M_UR50D examples/data/some_proteins.fasta \\\n  examples/data/some_proteins_emb_esm2 --repr_layers 0 32 33 --include\n```\n```bash\npython scripts/extract.py esm2_t33_650M_UR50D examples/data/some_proteins.fasta \\\n  examples/data/some_proteins_emb_esm2 --repr_layers 0 32 33 --include mean per_tok\n```\n\nA cuda device is optional and will be auto-detected.\n\nDirectory `some_proteins_emb_esm2/` now contains one `.pt` file per FASTA sequence; use `torch.load()` to load them.\n`scripts/extract.py` has flags that determine what's included in the `.pt` file:\n* `--repr-layers` (default: final only) selects which layers to include embeddings from.\n* `--include` specifies what embeddings to save. You can use the following:\n  * `per_tok` includes the full sequence, with an embedding per amino acid (seq_len x hidden_dim).\n  * `mean` includes the embeddings averaged over the full sequence, per layer.\n  * `bos` includes the embeddings from the beginning-of-sequence token.\n  (NOTE: Don't use with the pre-trained models - we trained without bos-token supervision)\n\n\n### CPU offloading for inference with large models <a name=\"fsdp\"></a>\nIf you want to load very large models like 15B and/or do inference on long sequences on your machine, regular GPU inference may lead to OOM errors.\nWe show how to load the model with Fairscale's [Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP)](https://fairscale.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/nn/fsdp.html) and\nuse its CPU offloading feature.\nThis allows to do inference of large models on a single GPU.\nPlease check out `examples/esm2_infer_fairscale_fsdp_cpu_offloading.py` for more details.\n\n### Zero-shot variant prediction <a name=\"zs_variant\"></a>\nSee \"[examples/variant-prediction/](examples/variant-prediction/)\" for code and pre-trained weights for the ESM-1v models described in\n[Language models enable zero-shot prediction of the effects of mutations on protein function. (Meier et al. 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.09.450648).\n\nNote that ESM-2 could be used for variant prediction as well, and is expected to have similar performance to ESM-1v.\n\n### Inverse folding <a name=\"invf\"></a>\nSee \"[examples/inverse_folding/](examples/inverse_folding/)\" for detailed user guide. The ESM-IF1 model is described as `GVPTransformer` in [Learning inverse folding from millions of predicted structures. (Hsu et al. 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.04.10.487779).\n\nWe also provide a colab notebook for the sequence design and sequence scoring functionalities.\n\n[<img src=\"https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg\">](https://colab.research.google.com/github/facebookresearch/esm/blob/main/examples/inverse_folding/notebook_multichain.ipynb)\n\nThe ESM-IF1 inverse folding model is built for predicting protein sequences\nfrom their backbone atom coordinates. We provide scripts here 1) to sample sequence\ndesigns for a given structure and 2) to score sequences for a given structure.\n\nTrained with 12M protein structures predicted by AlphaFold2, the ESM-IF1\nmodel consists of invariant geometric input processing layers followed by a\nsequence-to-sequence transformer, and achieves 51% native sequence recovery on\nstructurally held-out backbones with 72% recovery for buried residues.\nThe model is also trained with span masking to tolerate missing backbone\ncoordinates and therefore can predict sequences for partially masked structures.\n\n#### Sample sequence designs for a given structure\nThe environment setup is described in [this subsection of examples/inverse_folding](examples/inverse_folding#recommended-environment).\n\nTo sample sequences for a given structure in PDB or mmCIF format, use the\n`sample_sequences.py` script. The input file can have either `.pdb` or\n`.cif` as suffix.\n\nFor example, to sample 3 sequence designs for the golgi casein kinase structure\n(PDB [5YH2](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/5yh2); [PDB Molecule of the Month\nfrom January 2022](https://pdb101.rcsb.org/motm/265)), we can run the following\ncommand from the esm root directory:\n```bash\npython examples/inverse_folding/sample_sequences.py examples/inverse_folding/data/5YH2.pdb \\\n  --chain C --temperature 1 --num-samples 3 --outpath examples/inverse_folding/output/sampled_sequences.fasta\n```\n\nThe sampled sequences will be saved in a fasta format to the specified output file.\n\nThe temperature parameter controls the sharpness of the probability\ndistribution for sequence sampling. Higher sampling temperatures yield more\ndiverse sequences but likely with lower native sequence recovery.\nThe default sampling temperature is 1. To optimize for native sequence\nrecovery, we recommend sampling with low temperature such as 1e-6.\n\n#### Scoring sequences\nTo score the conditional log-likelihoods for sequences conditioned on a given\nstructure, use the `score_log_likelihoods.py` script.\n\nFor example, to score the sequences in `examples/inverse_folding/data/5YH2_mutated_seqs.fasta`\naccording to the structure in `examples/inverse_folding/data/5YH2.pdb`, we can run\nthe following command from the esm root directory:\n```\npython examples/inverse_folding/score_log_likelihoods.py examples/inverse_folding/data/5YH2.pdb \\\n  examples/inverse_folding/data/5YH2_mutated_seqs.fasta --chain C \\\n  --outpath examples/inverse_folding/output/5YH2_mutated_seqs_scores.csv\n```\n\nThe conditional log-likelihoods are saved in a csv format in the specified output path.\nThe output values are the average log-likelihoods averaged over all amino acids in a sequence.\n\nFor more information, see \"[./examples/inverse_folding/](examples/inverse_folding/)\" for detailed user guide.\n\n## ESM Metagenomic Atlas <a name=\"atlas\"></a>\n\nPlease visit the [ESM Metagenomic Atlas](https://esmatlas.com/) website, and\nsee our [blog post](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/protein-folding-esmfold-metagenomics/) to learn more.\n\nBulk download instructions available at a seperate README [here](scripts/atlas/README.md).\n\nThe Atlas resources include a page to [fold a sequence using ESMFold](https://esmatlas.com/resources?action=fold),\nsearching a subset of the ESM Atlas by [structure](https://esmatlas.com/resources?action=search_structure) or \n[sequence](https://esmatlas.com/resources?action=search_sequence),\nas well as an [API](https://esmatlas.com/about#api) to access those resources programmatically.\n\nFoldseek provides search against the Atlas without the length limitation [here](https://search.foldseek.com/search).\n\n\n## Notebooks <a name=\"notebooks\"></a>\n\n### Inverse folding - predicting or scoring sequences based on backbone structures\n\n[<img src=\"https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg\">](https://colab.research.google.com/github/facebookresearch/esm/blob/main/examples/inverse_folding/notebook.ipynb)\n\nThe ESM-IF1 inverse folding model predicts protein sequences from their backbone atom coordinates, trained with 12M protein structures predicted by AlphaFold2.\nThis notetook guide you through examples of sampling sequences, calculating conditional log-likelihoods, and extracting encoder output as structure representation.\n\n### Supervised variant prediction - training a classifier on the embeddings\n\n[<img src=\"https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg\">](https://colab.research.google.com/github/facebookresearch/esm/blob/main/examples/sup_variant_prediction.ipynb)\n\n\nTo help you get started with using the embeddings, this [jupyter notebook tutorial](examples/sup_variant_prediction.ipynb) shows how to train a supervised variant predictor using embeddings from ESM-1.\nYou can adopt a similar protocol to train a model for any downstream task, even with limited data.\nFirst you can obtain the embeddings for ``examples/data/P62593.fasta`` either by [downloading the precomputed](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/fair-esm/examples/P62593_reprs.tar.gz) embeddings\nas instructed in the notebook or by running the following:\n\n```bash\n# Obtain the embeddings\npython scripts/extract.py esm1v_t33_650M_UR90S_1 examples/data/P62593.fasta \\\n  examples/data/P62593_emb_esm1v --repr_layers 33 --include mean\n```\n\nThen, follow the remaining instructions in the tutorial. You can also run the tutorial in a [colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/facebookresearch/esm/blob/main/examples/sup_variant_prediction.ipynb).\n\n**Note, alternatively use [the newer instructions for zero-shot variant prediction](examples/variant-prediction/),\nwhich predicts mutational effects without any supervised training.**\n\n\n### Unsupervised contact prediction\n[<img src=\"https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg\">](https://colab.research.google.com/github/facebookresearch/esm/blob/main/examples/contact_prediction.ipynb)\n\nThis [jupyter notebook tutorial](examples/contact_prediction.ipynb) demonstrates contact prediction with both the ESM-2 and MSA Transformer (ESM-MSA-1) models.\nContact prediction is based on a logistic regression over the model's attention maps.\nThis methodology is based on our ICLR 2021 paper,\n[Transformer protein language models are unsupervised structure learners. (Rao et al. 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.15.422761)\nThe MSA Transformer (ESM-MSA-1) takes a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) as input, and uses the tied row self-attention maps in the same way.\nSee [MSA Transformer. (Rao et al. 2021)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.12.430858v1).\n\nTo get unsupervised attention-based contacts, call `model.predict_contacts(tokens)` or `model(tokens, return_contacts=True)`.\n\n\n### ESMStructuralSplitDataset and self-attention contact prediction\n[<img src=\"https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg\">](https://colab.research.google.com/github/facebookresearch/esm/blob/main/examples/esm_structural_dataset.ipynb)\n\nAnd this [jupyter notebook tutorial](examples/esm_structural_dataset.ipynb) shows how to load and index the `ESMStructuralSplitDataset`,\nand computes the self-attention map unsupervised contact predictions using ESM-2.\n\n\n## Available Models and Datasets <a name=\"available\"></a>\n\n### Pre-trained Models <a name=\"available-models\"></a>\n\n| Shorthand | `esm.pretrained.`           | #layers | #params | Dataset | Embedding Dim |  Model URL (automatically downloaded to `~/.cache/torch/hub/checkpoints`) |\n|-----------|---------------------|---------|-------------|---------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| ESM-2     | `esm2_t48_15B_UR50D`         | 48           | 15B         | UR50/D 2021_04                           | 5120 |  https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/fair-esm/models/esm2_t48_15B_UR50D.pt          |\n|           | `esm2_t36_3B_UR50D`          | 36           | 3B          | UR50/D 2021_04                           | 2560 |  https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/fair-esm/models/esm2_t36_3B_UR50D.pt           |\n|           | `esm2_t33_650M_UR50D`        | 33           | 650M        | UR50/D 2021_04                           | 1280 |  https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/fair-esm/models/esm2_t33_650M_UR50D.pt         |\n|           | `esm2_t30_150M_UR50D`        | 30           | 150M        | UR50/D 2021_04                           | 640  |  https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/fair-esm/models/esm2_t30_150M_UR50D.pt         |\n|           | `esm2_t12_35M_UR50D`         | 12           | 35M         | UR50/D 2021_04                           | 480  |  https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/fair-esm/models/esm2_t12_35M_UR50D.pt          |\n|           | `esm2_t6_8M_UR50D`           | 6            | 8M          | UR50/D 2021_04                           | 320  |  https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/fair-esm/models/esm2_t6_8M_UR50D.pt            |\n| ESMFold   | `esmfold_v1`                 | 48 (+36)     | 690M (+3B)  | UR50/D 2021_04                           | -

The SCOPe database is used to classify domains. Independently for each level of structural hold-out,\nthe domains are split into 5 equal sets, i.e. five sets of folds, superfamilies, or families. This ensures\nthat for each of the five partitions, structures having the same classification do not appear in both the\ntrain and test sets. For a given classification level each structure appears in a test set once, so that\nin the cross validation experiment each of the structures will be evaluated exactly once.\n\nThe dataset provides 3d coordinates, distance maps, and secondary structure labels.\nFor further details on the construction of the dataset\nsee [Rives et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1101/622803) Appendix A.10.\n\nThis [jupyter notebook tutorial](examples/esm_structural_dataset.ipynb) shows how to load and index the `ESMStructuralSplitDataset`.\n\n`ESMStructuralSplitDataset`, upon initializing, will download `splits` and `pkl`.\nWe also provide `msas` for each of the domains.

separation of at least 24 residues\n* For unsupervised contact prediction, a sparse linear combination of the attention heads is used to directly predict protein contacts,\nfitted with logistic regression on 20 structures.\nFor more details on the method, see [Rao et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.15.422761).\n* For structure prediction, an AlphaFold2 structure module is trained directly from the frozen language model embeddings.\nFor more details on the method, see [Lin et al. 2022](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.ade2574).\n* Direct coupling analysis methods (Gremlin, mfDCA, Psicov) and ESM-MSA-1 use the [trRosetta MSAs](https://yanglab.nankai.edu.cn/trRosetta/benchmark/), while other methods predict from single sequence.\n\n\n## Citations <a
