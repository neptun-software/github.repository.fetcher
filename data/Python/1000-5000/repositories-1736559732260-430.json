          "content": "# Contributing to Presidio\n\n:tada: Thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada:\n\nThe following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Presidio.\n\n## What do I need to know before I get started?\n\n### Project Presidio\n\nPresidio is a community project aimed at helping everyone handle their private data and make the world a safer place.\nPresidio is both a framework and a system. It's a framework in a sense that you could take code parts from it, extend, customize and plug somewhere. It's also a system you could take as a whole or in parts and deploy locally, on-prem on in the cloud.\nWhen contributing to presidio, it's important to keep this in mind, as some \"framework\" contributions might not be suitable for a deployment, or vice-versa.\n\n### PR guidelines\n\nCommit message should be clear, explaining the committed changes.\n\nUpdate CHANGELOG.md:\n\nUnder Unreleased section, use the category which is most suitable for your change (changed/removed/deprecated).\nDocument the change with simple readable text and push it as part of the commit.\nNext release, the change will be documented under the new version.\n\n### Build and Release process\n\nThe project currently supports [Azure Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines/) using YAML pipelines which can be easily imported to any Azure Pipelines instance.\nFor more details follow the [Build and Release documentation](docs/build_release.md).\n\n## Getting started with the code\n\nTo get started, refer to the documentation for [setting up a development environment](docs/development.md).\n\n### How to test?\n\nFor Python, Presidio leverages `pytest` and `ruff`. See [this tutorial](docs/development.md#testing) on more information on testing presidio modules.\n\n### Adding new recognizers for new PII types\n\nAdding a new recognizer is a great way to improve Presidio. A new capability to detect a new type of PII entity improves Presidio's coverage and makes private data less accessible.\n\nBest practices for developing recognizers [are described here](docs/analyzer/developing_recognizers.md). Please follow these guidelines when proposing new recognizers.\n\n### Fixing Bugs and improving the code\n\nPlease review the open [issues on Github](https://github.com/microsoft/presidio/issues) for known bugs and feature requests. We sometimes add 'good first issue' labels on those we believe are simpler, and 'advanced' labels on those which require more work or multiple changes across the solution.\n\n### Adding samples\n\nWe would love to see more samples demonstrating how to use Presidio in different scenarios. If you have a sample that you think would be useful for others, please consider contributing it. You can find the samples in the [samples folder](docs/samples/).\n\nWhen contributing a sample, make sure it is self contained (e.g. external dependencies are documented), add it [to the index] (docs/samples/index.md), and to the [mkdocs.yml](mkdocs.yml) file.\n\n## Contacting Us\n\nFor any questions, please email <presidio@microsoft.com>.\n\n## Contribution guidelines\n\nThis project welcomes contributions and suggestions. Most contributions require you to agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit <https://cla.microsoft.com>.\n\nWhen you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repos using our CLA.\n\nThis project has adopted the Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct. For more information see the Code of Conduct FAQ or contact <opencode@microsoft.com> with any additional questions or comments.\n"

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

It provides fast **_identification_** and **_anonymization_** modules for private entities in text such as credit card numbers, names, locations, social security numbers, bitcoin wallets, US phone numbers, financial data and more.\n\n![Presidio demo gif](docs/assets/changing_text.gif)\n\n---\n\n### :blue_book: [Full documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/presidio)\n\n### :question: [Frequently Asked Questions](docs/faq.md)\n\n### :thought_balloon: [Demo](https://aka.ms/presidio-demo)\n\n### :flight_departure: [Examples](https://microsoft.github.io/presidio/samples/)\n\n---\n\n## Are you using Presidio?

Options for connecting to external PII detection models.\n3. Multiple usage options, **from Python or PySpark workloads through Docker to Kubernetes**.\n4. **Customizability** in PII identification and de-identification.\n5. Module for **redacting PII text in images** (standard image types and DICOM medical images).\n\n:warning: Presidio can help identify sensitive/PII data in un/structured text. However, because it is using automated detection mechanisms, there is no guarantee that Presidio will find all sensitive information. Consequently, additional systems and protections should be employed.\n\n\n\n## Installing Presidio\n\n1. [Using pip](https://microsoft.github.io/presidio/installation/#using-pip)\n2.
