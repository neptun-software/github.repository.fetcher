Note: This may result in slower build times on ARM, but performance will be normal when deployed to x64 servers.\n\n![Docker Setting](https://github.com/TEN-framework/docs/blob/main/assets/gif/docker_setting.gif?raw=true)\n\n<br>\n\n### Next step\n\n#### 1. Create `.env` file\n\n```bash\ncp ./.env.example ./.env\n```\n\n#### 2. Setup Agora App ID and App Certificate in `.env`\n\n```bash\nAGORA_APP_ID=\nAGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE=\n```\n\n#### 3. Start agent development containers\n```bash\ndocker compose up -d\n```\n\n#### 4. Enter container\n```bash\ndocker exec -it ten_agent_dev bash\n```\n\n#### 5. Build agent \n```bash\ntask use\n```\n\n#### 6. Start the web server\n```bash\ntask run\n```\n\n#### 7. Edit playground settings\nOpen the playground at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to configure your agent.\n 1. Select a graph type (e.g. Voice Agent, Realtime Agent)\n 2. Choose a corresponding module\n 3. Select an extension and configure its API key settings\n\n![Module Example](https://github.com/TEN-framework/docs/blob/main/assets/gif/module-example.gif?raw=true)\n\n#### Running Gemini Realtime Extension\nOpen the playground at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).\n\n 1. Select voice_assistant_realtime graph\n 2. Choose Gemini Realtime module\n 3. Select v2v extension and enter Gemini API key\n\n![Gemini Realtime Playground](https://github.com/TEN-framework/docs/blob/main/assets/gif/gemini-playground.gif?raw=true)\n\nNow, we have successfully set up the playground. This is just the beginning of TEN Agent. There are many different ways to explore and utilize TEN Agent.
