First, read this page (including the small print\nat the end).\n\n### Before you contribute\nBefore we can use your code, you must sign the\n[Google Individual Contributor License\nAgreement](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual?csw=1)\n(CLA), which you can do online. The CLA is necessary mainly because you own the\ncopyright to your changes, even after your contribution becomes part of our\ncodebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your code. We also\nneed to be sure of various other thingsâ€”for instance that you'll tell us if you\nknow that your code infringes on other people's patents. You don't have to sign\nthe CLA until after you've submitted your code for review and a member has\napproved it, but you must do it before we can put your code into our codebase.\nBefore you start working on a larger contribution, you should get in touch with\nus first through the issue tracker with your idea so that we can help out and\npossibly guide you. Coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid\nfrustration later on.\n\n### Code reviews\nAll submissions, including submissions by project members, require review.\nWe use Github pull requests for this purpose.\n\n### The small print\nContributions made by corporations are covered by a different agreement than\nthe one above, the Software Grant and Corporate Contributor License\nAgreement.\n"
