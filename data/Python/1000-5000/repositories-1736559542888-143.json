:sparkles: Usage\n\nvectorbt allows you to easily backtest strategies with a couple of lines of Python code.\n\n* Here is how much profit we would have made if we invested $100 into Bitcoin in 2014:\n\n```python\nimport vectorbt as vbt\n\nprice = vbt.YFData.download('BTC-USD').get('Close')\n\npf = vbt.Portfolio.from_holding(price, init_cash=100)\npf.total_profit()\n```\n\n```plaintext\n8961.008555963961\n```\n\n* Buy whenever 10-day SMA crosses above 50-day SMA and sell when opposite:\n\n```python\nfast_ma = vbt.MA.run(price, 10)\nslow_ma = vbt.MA.run(price, 50)\nentries = fast_ma.ma_crossed_above(slow_ma)\nexits = fast_ma.ma_crossed_below(slow_ma)\n\npf = vbt.Portfolio.from_signals(price, entries, exits, init_cash=100)\npf.total_profit()\n```\n\n```plaintext\n16423.251963801864\n```\n\n* Generate 1,000 strategies with random signals and test them on BTC and ETH:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\nsymbols = [\"BTC-USD\", \"ETH-USD\"]\nprice = vbt.YFData.download(symbols, missing_index='drop').get('Close')\n\nn = np.random.randint(10, 101, size=1000).tolist()\npf = vbt.Portfolio.from_random_signals(price, n=n, init_cash=100, seed=42)\n\nmean_expectancy = pf.trades.expectancy().groupby(['randnx_n', 'symbol']).mean()\nfig = mean_expectancy.unstack().vbt.scatterplot(xaxis_title='randnx_n', yaxis_title='mean_expectancy')\nfig.show()\n```\n\n![rand_scatter.svg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polakowo/vectorbt/master/docs/docs/assets/images/usage_rand_scatter.svg)\n\n* For fans of hyperparameter optimization: here is a snippet for testing 10,000 window combinations of a \ndual SMA crossover strategy on BTC, USD, and LTC:\n\n```python\nsymbols = [\"BTC-USD\", \"ETH-USD\", \"LTC-USD\"]\nprice = vbt.YFData.download(symbols, missing_index='drop').get('Close')\n\nwindows = np.arange(2, 101)\nfast_ma, slow_ma = vbt.MA.run_combs(price, window=windows, r=2, short_names=['fast', 'slow'])\nentries = fast_ma.ma_crossed_above(slow_ma)\nexits = fast_ma.ma_crossed_below(slow_ma)\n\npf_kwargs = dict(size=np.inf, fees=0.001, freq='1D')\npf = vbt.Portfolio.from_signals(price, entries, exits, **pf_kwargs)\n\nfig = pf.total_return().vbt.heatmap(\n    x_level='fast_window', y_level='slow_window', slider_level='symbol', symmetric=True,\n    trace_kwargs=dict(colorbar=dict(title='Total return', tickformat='%')))\nfig.show()\n```\n\n<img width=\"650\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polakowo/vectorbt/master/docs/docs/assets/images/usage_dmac_heatmap.gif\">\n\nDigging into each strategy configuration is as simple as indexing with pandas:\n\n```python\npf[(10, 20, 'ETH-USD')].stats()\n```\n\n```plaintext\nStart                          2015-08-07 00:00:00+00:00\nEnd                            2021-08-01 00:00:00+00:00\nPeriod

vectorbt can be used to facilitate financial data analysis and visualization.\n\n* Let's generate a GIF that animates the %B and bandwidth of Bollinger Bands for different
