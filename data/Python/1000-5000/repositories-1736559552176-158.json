Code\ncontributions are not the only way to help the community. Answering questions, helping\nothers, and improving the documentation are also immensely valuable.\n\nIt also helps us if you spread the word! Reference the library in blog posts\nabout the awesome projects it made possible, shout out on Twitter every time it has\nhelped you, or simply ⭐️ the repository to say thank you.\n\nHowever you choose to contribute, please be mindful and respect our\n[code of conduct](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n**This guide was heavily inspired by the awesome [scikit-learn guide to contributing](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).**\n\n## Ways to contribute\n\nThere are several ways you can contribute to smolagents.\n\n* Fix outstanding issues with the existing code.\n* Submit issues related to bugs or desired new features.\n* Contribute to the examples or to the documentation.\n\n> All contributions are equally valuable to the community. 🥰\n\n## Fixing outstanding issues\n\nIf you notice an issue with the existing code and have a fix in mind, feel free to [start contributing](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) and open\na Pull Request!\n\n## Submitting a bug-related issue or feature request\n\nDo your best to follow these guidelines when submitting a bug-related issue or a feature\nrequest. It will make it easier for us to come back to you quickly and with good\nfeedback.\n\n### Did you find a bug?\n\nThe smolagents library is robust and reliable thanks to users who report the problems they encounter.\n\nBefore you report an issue, we would really appreciate it if you could **make sure the bug was not\nalready reported** (use the search bar on GitHub under Issues). Your issue should also be related to bugs in the \nlibrary itself, and not your code. \n\nOnce you've confirmed the bug hasn't already been reported, please include the following information in your issue so \nwe can quickly resolve it:\n\n* Your **OS type and version**, as well as your environment versions (versions of rust, python, and dependencies).\n* A short, self-contained, code snippet that allows us to reproduce the bug.\n* The *full* traceback if an exception is raised.\n* Attach any other additional information, like screenshots, you think may help.\n\n### Do you want a new feature?\n\nIf there is a new feature you'd like to see in smolagents, please open an issue and describe:\n\n1. What is the *motivation* behind this feature? Is it related to a problem or frustration with the library? Is it \n   a feature related to something you need for a project? Is it something you worked on and think it could benefit \n   the community?\n\n   Whatever it is, we'd love to hear about it!\n\n2. Describe your requested feature in as much detail as possible. The more you can tell us about it, the better \n   we'll be able to help you.\n3. Provide a *code snippet* that demonstrates the feature's usage.\n4. If the feature is related to a paper, please include a link.\n\nIf your issue is well written we're already 80% of the way there by the time you create it.\n\n## Do you want to add documentation?\n\nWe're always looking for improvements to the documentation that make it more clear and accurate. Please let us know \nhow the documentation can be improved such as typos and any content that is missing, unclear or inaccurate. We'll be \nhappy to make the changes or help you make a contribution if you're interested!\n\n## I want to become a maintainer of the project. How do I get there?\n\nSmolagents is a project led and managed by Hugging Face as an initial fork of Transformers Agents. We are  more than \nhappy to have motivated individuals from other organizations join us as maintainers with the goal of helping Smolagents\nmake a dent in the world of Agents.\n\nIf you are such an individual (or organization), please reach out to us and let's collaborate."

It offers:\n\n✨ **Simplicity**: the logic for agents fits in ~thousand lines of code (see [agents.py](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents/blob/main/src/smolagents/agents.py)). We kept abstractions to their minimal shape above raw code!\n\n🧑‍💻 **First-class support for Code Agents**, i.e. agents that write their actions in code (as opposed to \"agents being used to write code\"). To make it secure, we support executing in sandboxed environments via [E2B](https://e2b.dev/).\n - On top of this [`CodeAgent`](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/reference/agents#smolagents.CodeAgent) class, we still support the standard [`ToolCallingAgent`](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/reference/agents#smolagents.ToolCallingAgent) that writes actions as JSON/text blobs.\n\n🤗 **Hub integrations**: you can share and load tools to/from the Hub, and more is to come!\n\n🌐 **Support for any LLM**: it supports models hosted on the Hub loaded in their `transformers` version or through our inference API, but also supports models from OpenAI, Anthropic and many others via our [LiteLLM](https://www.litellm.ai/) integration.\n\n> [!NOTE]  \n> Check the our [launch blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/smolagents) to learn more about `smolagents`!\n\n## Quick demo\n\nFirst install the package.\n```bash\npip install smolagents\n```\nThen define your agent, give it the tools it needs and run it!\n```py\nfrom smolagents import CodeAgent, DuckDuckGoSearchTool, HfApiModel\n\nagent = CodeAgent(tools=[DuckDuckGoSearchTool()], model=HfApiModel())\n\nagent.run(\"How many seconds would it take for a leopard at full speed to run through Pont des Arts?\")\n```\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd0226e2-7479-4102-aea0-57c22ca47884\n\n## Code agents?\n\nIn our `CodeAgent`,  the LLM engine writes its actions in code. This approach is demonstrated to work better than the current industry practice of letting the LLM output a dictionary of the tools it wants to calls: [uses 30% fewer steps](https://huggingface.co/papers/2402.01030) (thus 30% fewer LLM calls)\nand [reaches higher performance on difficult benchmarks](https://huggingface.co/papers/2411.01747). Head to [our high-level intro to agents](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/conceptual_guides/intro_agents) to learn more on that.\n\nEspecially, since code execution can be a security concern (arbitrary code execution!), we provide options at runtime:\n  - a secure python interpreter to run code more safely in your environment\n  - a sandboxed environment using [E2B](https://e2b.dev/).\n\n## How smol is it really?\n\nWe strived to keep abstractions to a strict minimum: the main code in `agents.py` is only ~1,000 lines of code.\nStill, we implement several types of agents: `CodeAgent` writes its actions as Python code snippets, and the more classic `ToolCallingAgent` leverages built-in tool calling methods.\n\nBy the way, why use a framework at all? Well, because a big part of this stuff is non-trivial. For instance, the code agent has to keep a consistent format for code throughout its system prompt, its parser, the execution. So our framework handles this complexity for you. But of course we still encourage you to hack into the source code and use only the bits that you need, to the exclusion of everything else!\n\n## How strong are open models for agentic workflows?\n\nWe've created [`CodeAgent`](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/reference/agents#smolagents.CodeAgent) instances with some leading models, and compared them on [this benchmark](https://huggingface.co/datasets/m-ric/agents_medium_benchmark_2) that gathers questions from a few different benchmarks to propose a varied blend of challenges.\n\n[Find the benchmarking code here](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents/blob/main/examples/benchmark.ipynb) for more detail on the agentic setup used, and see a comparison of using LLMs code agents compared to vanilla (spoilers: code agents works better).\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/blog/smolagents/benchmark_code_agents.png\" alt=\"benchmark of different models on agentic workflows\" width=70%>\n</p>\n\nThis comparison shows that open source models can now take on the best closed models!\n\n## Citing smolagents\n\nIf you use `smolagents` in your publication, please cite it by using the following BibTeX entry.\n\n```bibtex\n@Misc{smolagents,\n  title =        {`smolagents`: The easiest way to build efficient agentic systems.},\n  author =       {Aymeric Roucher and Thomas Wolf and Leandro von Werra and Erik Kaunismäki},\n  howpublished = {\\url{https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents}},\n  year =         {2025}\n}\n```\n"
