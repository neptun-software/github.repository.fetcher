By recomputing on the backwards pass in a tiled fashion, one is able to keep the memory linear with respect to sequence length. This allows a lot of recent models  to be able to reach for longer context lengths without worrying about the memory bottleneck.\n\nOther engineering decisions made by Tri Dao led to its enormous success, namely minimizing HBM accesses so that both the forwards and backwards outperform naive attention. In other words, flash attention is not only more memory efficient, but faster as well, making it a necessity for training transformers.\n\nMetaAI has recently added the ability to use <a href=\"https://github.com/hazyresearch/flash-attention\">Tri Dao's CUDA kernel</a> through the <a href=\"https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention.html\">scaled_dot_product_attention</a> function in Pytorch 2.0. (They also have a `mem_efficient` attention, which is identical to flash attention design, just that the tiles are traversed differently)\n\n<a href=\"https://ai.facebook.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/\">Llama</a> was trained using Flash Attention. The only reason to avoid it is if you require operating on the attention matrix (dynamic positional bias, talking heads, residual attention).\n\nYou can use it in this repository by setting `attn_flash` to `True` and enjoy the immediate memory savings and increase in speed.\n\nex.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom x_transformers import TransformerWrapper, Decoder, Encoder\n\nmodel = TransformerWrapper(\n    num_tokens = 20000,\n    max_seq_len = 1024,\n    attn_layers = Decoder(\n        dim = 512,\n        depth = 6,\n        heads = 8,\n        attn_flash = True # just set this to True if you have pytorch 2.0 installed\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Augmenting Self-attention with Persistent Memory\n\n<img src=\"./images/all-attention.png\" width=\"500px\"></img>\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01470\n\nProposes adding learned memory key / values prior to attention. They were able to remove feedforwards altogether and attain similar performance to the original transformers. I have found that keeping the feedforwards and adding the memory key / values leads to even better performance.\n\n```python\nfrom x_transformers import Decoder, Encoder\n\nenc = Encoder(\n    dim = 512,\n    depth = 6,\n    heads = 8,\n    attn_num_mem_kv = 16 # 16 memory key / values\n)\n```\n\n### Memory Transformers\n\n<img src=\"./images/memory-transformer.png\" width=\"500px\"></img>\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11527\n\nProposes adding learned tokens, akin to CLS tokens, named memory tokens, that is passed through the attention layers alongside the input tokens. This setting is compatible with both encoder and decoder training.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom x_transformers import TransformerWrapper, Decoder, Encoder\n\nmodel = TransformerWrapper(\n    num_tokens = 20000,\n    max_seq_len = 1024,\n    num_memory_tokens = 20, # 20 memory tokens\n    attn_layers = Encoder(\n        dim = 512,\n        depth = 6,\n        heads = 8\n    )\n)\n```\n\nUpdate: MetaAI researchers <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16588\">have found</a> that adding memory tokens (they call them register tokens), alleviates outliers (which is suspected now to be a pathology of attention networks unable to <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12929\">attend to nothing</a>).\n\nUpdate 2: a hybrid architecture out of Nvidia named <a href=\"https://openreview.net/forum?id=A1ztozypga\">Hymba</a> used memory tokens successfully in the autoregressive case, termed meta tokens in their paper.\n\nUpdate 3: further corroborated by <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00663\">a paper</a> trying to extend memory in attention networks, termed persistent memory\n\n### Transformers Without Tears\n\n<img src=\"./images/scalenorm.png\"></img>\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1910.05895\n\nThey experiment with alternatives to Layer normalization and found one that is both effective and simpler. Researchers have shared with me this leads to faster convergence.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom x_transformers import TransformerWrapper, Decoder, Encoder\n\nmodel = TransformerWrapper(\n    num_tokens = 20000,\n    max_seq_len = 1024,\n    attn_layers = Decoder(\n        dim = 512,\n        depth = 6,\n        heads = 8,\n        use_scalenorm = True # set to True to use for all layers\n    )\n)\n```\n\nYou can also use the l2 normalized embeddings proposed as part of `fixnorm`. I have found it leads to improved convergence, when paired with small initialization (proposed by <a href=\"https://github.com/BlinkDL\">BlinkDL</a>). The small initialization will be taken care of as long as `l2norm_embed` is set to `True`\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom x_transformers import TransformerWrapper, Decoder, Encoder\n\nmodel = TransformerWrapper(\n    num_tokens = 20000,\n    max_seq_len = 1024,\n    l2norm_embed = True,    # set this to True for l2 normalized embedding + small init\n    attn_layers = Decoder(\n        dim = 512,\n        depth = 6,\n        heads = 8\n    )\n)\n```\n\nAlong the same lines of l2 normalized embeddings, Huggingface's <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom\">175B parameter BLOOM</a> also places a layernorm right after the embeddings and just before the tokens enter the attention layers. This was corroborated by Yandex's <a href=\"https://github.com/yandex/YaLM-100B\">100B parameter YaLM</a> to stabilize training.\n\nIt is recommended you either have either `l2norm_embed` or `post_emb_norm` set to `True` but not both, as they probably serve the same purpose.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom x_transformers import TransformerWrapper, Decoder, Encoder\n\nmodel = TransformerWrapper(\n    num_tokens = 20000,\n    max_seq_len = 1024,\n    post_emb_norm = True,    # set this to True to layernorm summed token + pos embeddings\n    attn_layers = Decoder(\n        dim = 512,\n        depth = 6,\n        heads = 8\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Root Mean Square Layer Normalization\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07467\n\nThe authors propose to replace layer normalization with a simpler alternative, without mean centering and the learned bias. An investigative paper found this to be the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11972\">best performing normalization variant</a>. It was also used in Deepmind's latest large language models, <a href=\"https://deepmind.com/research/publications/2021/improving-language-models-by-retrieving-from-trillions-of-tokens\">Retro</a> and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11446\">Gopher</a>.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom x_transformers import TransformerWrapper, Decoder, Encoder\n\nmodel = TransformerWrapper(\n    num_tokens = 20000,\n    max_seq_len = 1024,\n    attn_layers = Decoder(\n        dim = 512,\n        depth = 6,\n        heads = 8,\n        use_rmsnorm = True # set to true to use for all layers\n    )\n)\n```\n\n*July 2023* <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14995\">A linear attention paper</a> has experiments to show that removing the learned multiplicative gamma led to no performance degradation. This simplifies the RMS normalization to a satisfying `l2norm(x) * sqrt(dim)`.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom x_transformers import TransformerWrapper, Decoder, Encoder\n\nmodel = TransformerWrapper(\n    num_tokens = 20000,\n    max_seq_len = 1024,\n    attn_layers = Decoder(\n        dim = 512,\n        depth = 6,\n        heads = 8,\n        use_simple_rmsnorm = True # set to true to use for all layers\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### GLU Variants Improve Transformer\n\n<img src=\"./images/ffglu.png\"></img>\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05202\n\nNoam Shazeer paper that explores gating in the feedforward, finding that simple gating with GELU leads to significant improvements. This variant also showed up in the latest mT5 architecture. You should always turn this on (I may eventually turn it on by default).\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom x_transformers import TransformerWrapper, Decoder, Encoder\n\nmodel = TransformerWrapper(\n    num_tokens = 20000,\n    max_seq_len = 1024,\n    attn_layers = Decoder(\n        dim = 512,\n        depth = 6,\n        heads = 8,\n        ff_glu = True # set to true to use for all feedforwards\n    )\n)\n```\n\nThe <a href=\"https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/04/pathways-language-model-palm-scaling-to.html\">PaLM</a> language model also chose to use the Swish GLU variant. You can turn this on by setting two flags\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom x_transformers import TransformerWrapper, Decoder, Encoder\n\nmodel = TransformerWrapper(\n    num_tokens = 20000,\n    max_seq_len = 1024,\n    attn_layers = Decoder(\n        dim = 512,\n        depth = 6,\n        heads = 8,\n        ff_swish = True, # set this to True\n        ff_glu = True    # set to true to use for all feedforwards\n    )\n)\n``````\n\n### No Bias in Feedforward\n\nStarting with <a href=\"https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/04/pathways-language-model-palm-scaling-to.html\">PaLM</a>, there begun a trend to remove biases from the transformer all together. <a href=\"https://github.com/borisdayma\">Boris Dayma</a> has run a number of experiments that showed removing biases from feedforwards led to increased throughput without any loss of accuracy. This was corroborated by <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14034\">yet another paper</a> investigating transformer architecture variants.\n\nYou can turn off the feedforward bias as follows\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom x_transformers import TransformerWrapper, Decoder, Encoder\n\nmodel = TransformerWrapper(\n    num_tokens = 20000,\n    max_seq_len = 1024,\n    attn_layers = Decoder(\n        dim = 512,\n        depth = 6,\n        heads = 8,\n        ff_no_bias = True  # set this to True\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### ReLU²\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08668\n\nThis paper used neural architecture search and found an activation, Relu Squared, that is both simpler and performs better than GELU, in the autoregressive language model setting. I have confirmed this in my independent experiments. However, if one were using the GLU variant from above, GELU still performs better. Pending further corroboration.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom x_transformers import TransformerWrapper, Decoder, Encoder\n\nmodel = TransformerWrapper(\n    num_tokens = 20000,\n    max_seq_len = 1024,\n    attn_layers = Decoder(\n        dim = 512,\n        depth = 6,\n        heads = 8,\n        ff_relu_squared = True\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Explicit Sparse Transformer: Concentrated Attention Through Explicit Selection\n\n<img src=\"./images/topk-attention.png\" width=\"500px\"></img>\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1912.11637\n\nThis paper proposes an efficient way to sparsify attention by zeroing all dot-product query/key values not within the top k values. The show that this cheap method was as effective as other more expensive operations like sparsemax or entmax15. This technique comes with the cost of an extra hyperparameter (the top k values to keep). The paper recommends a value of `k = 8`\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom x_transformers import TransformerWrapper, Decoder\n\nmodel = TransformerWrapper(\n    num_tokens = 20000,\n    max_seq_len = 1024,\n    attn_layers = Decoder(\n        dim = 512,\n        depth = 6,\n        heads = 8,\n        attn_sparse_topk = 8,                       # keep only the top 8 values before attention (softmax)\n        attn_sparse_topk_straight_through = True    # straight through the original gradients\n    )\n)\n```\n\nAn extreme case of `topk` value of `1`, you can use the following\n\n```python\nmodel = TransformerWrapper(\n    num_tokens = 20000,\n    max_seq_len = 1024,\n    attn_layers = Decoder(\n        dim = 512,\n        depth = 6,\n        heads = 8,\n        attn_hard = True  # will only propagate the single value of the argmax of qk logit. offered in the case it addresses https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01104\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Talking-Heads Attention\n\n<img src=\"./images/talking-heads.png\" width=\"500px\"></img>\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02436\n\nA Noam Shazeer paper that proposes mixing information between heads pre and post attention (softmax). This comes with the cost of extra memory and compute.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom x_transformers import TransformerWrapper, Decoder\n\nmodel = TransformerWrapper(\n    num_tokens = 20000,\n    max_seq_len = 1024,\n    attn_layers = Decoder(\n        dim = 512,\n        depth = 6,\n        heads = 8,\n        attn_pre_talking_heads = True,  # linear combination across pre-softmax attn logits across heads\n        attn_post_talking_heads = True  # linear combination across post-softmax attn across heads\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### One Write-Head Is All You Need\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02150\n\nYet another Noam Shazeer paper (he's a legend) that proposes to only have one head for the key / values, but multi-headed queries. This paper was largely ignored for a while, but recently validated at scale in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07814\">AlphaCode</a> as well as <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02311\">PaLM</a>. It has the property of being memory efficient when decoding extremely large language models. You can use it with one keyword argument as shown below.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom x_transformers import TransformerWrapper, Decoder\n\nmodel = TransformerWrapper(\n    num_tokens = 20000,\n    max_seq_len = 1024,\n    attn_layers = Decoder(\n        dim = 512,\n        depth = 6,\n        heads = 8,\n        attn_one_kv_head = True\n    )\n)\n```\n\nThis has been further generalized in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13245\">a recent paper</a> to allow for groups of query heads to attend to a single key / value head. You can use this by specifying the `attn_kv_heads`\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom x_transformers import TransformerWrapper, Decoder\n\nmodel = TransformerWrapper(\n    num_tokens = 20000,\n    max_seq_len = 1024,\n    attn_layers = Decoder(\n        dim = 512,\n        depth = 12,\n        heads = 8,\n        attn_kv_heads = 2 # say you want 4 query heads to attend to 1 key / value head\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Attention on Attention for Image Captioning\n\n<img src=\"./images/attention-on-attention.png\"></img>\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1908.06954\n\nThis paper proposes to add a gated linear unit at the end of the attention layer, further gated by the original queries. Although this is not widely used outside of visual question / answering, I suspect it should lead to improvements after seeing the success of the feedforward GLU variant.\n\nUpdate: After some experimentation, I found this variant actually performs worse, but if it were to be modified to not concatenate the queries before gating, it performs much better. That is what we will be using in this repository.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom x_transformers import TransformerWrapper, Encoder\n\nmodel = TransformerWrapper(\n    num_tokens = 20000,\n    max_seq_len = 1024,\n    attn_layers = Encoder(\n        dim = 512,\n        depth = 6,\n        heads = 8,\n        attn_on_attn = True  # gate output of attention layer, by queries\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Intra-attention Gating on Values\n\n<img src=\"./images/gate_values.png\" width=\"400px\"></img>\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold\">Alphafold2</a> had a peculiar variant of attention where they gate the aggregated values with the input, presumably to have the block have more control over the update.\n\nA quick test shows a small but noticeable improvement, on about the same order as attention on attention.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom x_transformers import TransformerWrapper, Encoder\n\nmodel = TransformerWrapper(\n    num_tokens = 20000,\n    max_seq_len = 1024,\n    attn_layers = Encoder(\n        dim = 512,\n        depth = 6,\n        heads = 8,\n        attn_gate_values = True  # gate aggregated values with the input\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Improving Transformer Models by Reordering their Sublayers\n\n<img src=\"./images/sandwich.png\"></img>\n\n<img src=\"./images/sandwich-2.png\"></img>\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03864\n\nThis paper proposes to break from the normal fixed pattern of alternating attention and feedforwards, but to have blocks of only attention at the beginning followed by blocks of feedforwards at the end. This was further corroborated by a paper by Nvidia that reduces the number of attention layers to be 1/3rd of the feedforwards without loss in performance.\n\nThe amount of interleaving is controlled by a \"sandwich coefficient\", which they found to be optimal at a value of `6`.\n\nYou can experiment with this feature as shown below\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom x_transformers import TransformerWrapper, Encoder\n\nmodel = TransformerWrapper(\n    num_tokens = 20000,\n    max_seq_len = 1024,\n    attn_layers = Encoder(\n        dim = 512,\n        depth = 6,\n        heads = 8,\n        sandwich_coef = 6  # interleave attention and feedforwards with sandwich coefficient of 6\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Weight-tied Layers\n\nIn the early days of the cambrian explosion of BERT, a paper explored weight tying all the layers, the model named <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11942\">ALBERT</a>. You can use it by setting `weight_tie_layers = True`\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom x_transformers import TransformerWrapper, Encoder\n\nmodel = TransformerWrapper(\n    num_tokens = 20000,\n    max_seq_len = 1024,\n    attn_layers = Encoder(\n        dim = 512,\n        depth = 12,\n        weight_tie_layers = True   # set this to True to weight tie all the layers\n    )\n)\n```\n\nIf you wish to do something more sophisticated, say 3 layers, with each layer recurrent 4 times before onto the next (similar to <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15071\">this paper</a>), that is possible as well. Be aware the `layers_execute_order` is 0-indexed\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom x_transformers import TransformerWrapper, Decoder\n\nmodel = TransformerWrapper(\n    num_tokens = 20000,\n    max_seq_len = 1024,\n    attn_layers = Decoder(\n        dim = 512,\n        custom_layers = (\n            'a', 'f',        # 3 sets of attention and feedforward\n            'a', 'f',\n            'a', 'f'\n        ),\n        layers_execute_order = (\n            *((0, 1) * 4),   # each done 4 times before sequentially passed forward, but you can probably imagine some more interesting configurations...\n            *((2, 3) * 4),\n            *((4, 5) * 4),\n        )\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Understanding and Improving Transformer From a Multi-Particle Dynamic System Point of View\n\n<img src=\"./images/macaron-1.png\"></img>\n\n<img src=\"./images/macaron-2.png\"></img>\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02762\n\nThe authors propose to view the success of transformers from a dynamical systems point of view, and then proposes an improvement based on mathematics of that POV. Specifically, they propose to place the attention layer in between two feedforward layers. This was adopted by a paper using transformers for speech recognition, the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08100\">Conformer</a>.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom x_transformers import TransformerWrapper, Encoder\n\nmodel = TransformerWrapper(\n    num_tokens = 20000,\n    max_seq_len = 1024,\n    attn_layers = Encoder(\n        dim = 512,\n        depth = 6,\n        heads = 8,\n        macaron = True  # use macaron configuration\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### T5's Simplified Relative Positional Encoding\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683\n\nT5 is one of the most successful encoder / decoder transformer architectures trained to date. They invented a new simplified relative positional encoding based on learned bias values that are added to the attention matrix pre-softmax. This bias is shared and injected into each attention layer. I have decided to include this because it offers a cheap way to have relative positional encoding (superior to absolute positional), and I have read papers that suggest having positional encoding added to each layer (vs only before the first) is beneficial.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom x_transformers import TransformerWrapper, Decoder\n\nmodel = TransformerWrapper(\n    num_tokens = 20000,\n    max_seq_len = 1024,\n    attn_layers = Decoder(\n        dim = 512,\n        depth = 6,\n        heads = 8,\n        rel_pos_bias = True  # adds relative positional bias to all attention layers, a la T5\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Residual Attention\n\n<img src=\"./images/residual_attn.png\" width=\"500px\"></img>\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11747\n\nThis paper from Google proposes residualizing the pre-attention scores across all layers. At the cost of no extra parameters, they show improvement on top of regular attention networks. If you turn on this setting, be aware that the best results in the paper used post-normalization, in which case a learning warmup will be needed. The authors also reported that they could use a higher learning rate and get even better gains in the same amount of steps. (In the paper they use `2e-4` vs `1e-4` for vanilla transformer)\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom x_transformers import TransformerWrapper, Encoder\n\nmodel = TransformerWrapper(\n    num_tokens = 20000,\n    max_seq_len = 1024,\n    attn_layers = Encoder(\n        dim = 512,\n        depth = 6,\n        heads = 8,\n        pre_norm = False,       # in the paper, residual attention had best results with post-layernorm\n        residual_attn = True    # add residual attention\n    )\n)\n```\n\nI also tried residualizing cross attention and may have noticed an improvement in convergence. You can try it by setting the `cross_residual_attn` keyword to `True`\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom x_transformers import XTransformer\n\nmodel = XTransformer(\n    dim = 512,\n    enc_num_tokens = 256,\n    enc_depth = 6,\n    enc_heads = 8,\n    enc_max_seq_len = 1024,\n    dec_num_tokens = 256,\n    dec_depth = 6,\n    dec_heads = 8,\n    dec_max_seq_len = 1024,\n    dec_cross_residual_attn = True     # residualize cross attention\n)\n```\n\n### Transformer-XL recurrence\n\nYou can also do Transformer-XL recurrence, by simply passing in a `max_mem_len` in the `TransformerWrapper` class, and then making sure your `Decoder` has `rel_pos_bias` (or `rotary_pos_emb`) set to `True`.\n\nThen, you can retrieve the memories at each step with the `return_mems` keyword and pass it to the next iteration.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom x_transformers import TransformerWrapper, Decoder\n\nmodel_xl = TransformerWrapper(\n    num_tokens = 20000,\n    max_seq_len = 512,\n    max_mem_len = 2048,\n    attn_layers = Decoder(\n        dim = 512,\n        depth = 6,\n        heads = 8,\n        rel_pos_bias = True\n    )\n)\n\nseg1 = torch.randint(0, 20000, (1, 512))\nseg2 = torch.randint(0, 20000, (1, 512))\nseg3 = torch.randint(0, 20000, (1, 512))\n\nlogits1, mems1  = model_xl(seg1, return_mems = True)\nlogits2, mems2  = model_xl(seg2, mems = mems1, return_mems = True)\nlogits3, mems3  = model_xl(seg3, mems = mems2, return_mems = True)\n```\n\nSetting up the logic for training and sampling from transformer xl can be a bit overwhelming. This repository offers a simple wrapper that should make this easy, with the `XLAutoregressiveWrapper`.\n\n```python\n# pass in the above model_xl\n\nxl_wrapper = XLAutoregressiveWrapper(model_xl)\n\nseg = torch.randint(0, 20000, (1, 4096)).cuda()  # sequence exceeding max length, automatically segmented and memory managed\n\nloss = xl_wrapper(seg)\nloss.backward()\n\n# then, after much training\n\nprime = seg[:, :1024]   # if prime exceeds max length, memory will be caught up before generating\n\ngenerated = xl_wrapper.generate(prime, 4096)  # (1, 4096)\n```\n\n### Enhanced recurrence\n\n<img src=\"./images/enhanced-recurrence.png\" width=\"400px\"/>\n\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15688\">This paper</a> proposes a simple technique to enhance the range of Transformer-XL. They simply route the memory segment of a layer to the layer below it, for the next recurrent step. You can enable this by setting `shift_mem_down = 1`. You can also shift down arbitrary number of layers by setting this value to `> 1`.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom x_transformers import TransformerWrapper, Decoder\n\nmodel_xl = TransformerWrapper(\n    num_tokens = 20000,\n    max_seq_len = 512,\n    max_mem_len = 2048,\n    shift_mem_down = 1,\n    attn_layers = Decoder(\n        dim = 512,\n        depth = 6,\n        heads = 8,\n        rotary_pos_emb = True\n    )\n)\n\nseg1 = torch.randint(0, 20000, (1, 512))\nseg2 = torch.randint(0, 20000, (1, 512))\nseg3 = torch.randint(0, 20000, (1, 512))\n\nlogits1, mems1  = model_xl(seg1, return_mems = True)\nlogits2, mems2  = model_xl(seg2, mems = mems1, return_mems = True) # mems1 of layer N are automatically routed to the layer N-1\n```\n\n### Gated residual\n\n<img src=\"./images/gating.png\" width=\"500px\"></img>\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06764\n\nThe authors propose gating the residual connections in the transformer network and demonstrate increased stability and performance for Transformer-XL in a variety of reinforcement learning tasks.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom x_transformers import TransformerWrapper, Decoder\n\nmodel = TransformerWrapper(\n    num_tokens = 20000,\n    max_seq_len = 1024,\n    max_mem_len = 2048,\n    attn_layers = Decoder(\n        dim = 512,\n        depth = 6,\n        heads = 16,\n        gate_residual = True\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Rotary Positional Embeddings\n\n<img src=\"./images/rotary.png\" width=\"500px\"></img>\n\nDeveloped in Beijing, this new technique quickly gained interest in the NLP circles. In short, it allows you to endow the transformer with relative positional embeddings at the cost of no learned parameters. You apply a rotary operation to the queries and keys prior to their dot product in attention. The big idea is injecting positions through rotations.\n\nHighly recommend that you have this turned on whenever you are working on an ordered sequence.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom x_transformers import TransformerWrapper, Decoder\n\nmodel = TransformerWrapper(\n    num_tokens = 20000,\n    max_seq_len = 1024,\n    attn_layers = Decoder(\n        dim = 512,\n        depth = 6,\n        heads = 8,\n        rotary_pos_emb = True  # turns on rotary positional embeddings\n    )\n)\n```\n\nUpdate (12/2022): Rotary embedding has since been hugely successful, widely adopted in many large language models, including the largest in the world, PaLM. However, it has been uncovered in the ALiBi paper that rotary embeddings cannot length extrapolate well. This was recently addressed in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10554v1\">a Microsoft research paper</a>. They propose a way to unobtrusively add the same decay as in ALiBi, and found that this resolves the extrapolation problem. You can use it in this repository by setting `rotary_xpos = True`. Like ALiBi, it would enforce the attention to be local. You can set the receptive field with `rotary_xpos_scale_base` value, which defaults to `512`\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom x_transformers import TransformerWrapper, Decoder\n\nmodel = TransformerWrapper(\n    num_tokens = 20000,\n    max_seq_len = 1024,\n    attn_layers = Decoder(\n        dim = 512,\n        depth = 6,\n        heads = 8,\n        rotary_xpos = True   # modified rotary to extrapolate well beyond length at which it was trained\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Dynamic Positional Bias\n\n<img src=\"./images/dynamic-pos-bias.png\" width=\"150px\"></img>\n\nThis technique bears roots from the field of vision transformers, where researchers are trying to have relative positions generalize to larger resolutions (without having to retrain the entire network). It was used in two recent papers, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00154\">CrossFormer</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09883\">SwinV2</a>.\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/cfoster0\">Charles Foster</a> first tried this for a language model, and found that it works. Later on <a href=\"https://github.com/bob80333\">Eric Engelhart</a> produced experimental results that show the same type of extrapolation holds, even for 1d sequences.\n\nEric trained at sequence lengths of 128, and showed that it generalized well to 1024. In addition, he showed that linear positions was better than log (used in SwinV2), for language.\n\nLinear distances\n\n<img src=\"./images/dynamic-pos-bias-linear.png\" width=\"600px\"></img>\n\nLog distances\n\n<img src=\"./images/dynamic-pos-bias-log.png\" width=\"600px\"></img>\n\nNegative control - Sinusoidal\n\n<img src=\"./images/dynamic-pos-bias-sinusoidal.png\" width=\"600px\"></img>\n\nMore of Eric's experimental results can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/bob80333/investigating_extrapolation\">here</a>\n\nYou can use this type of relative position if you wish to train at smaller sequence lengths and have it generalize to longer ones, for both autoregressive and bidirectional models.\n\nUpdate: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/stanford-ribonanza-rna-folding/discussion/460121\">First place RNA folding using dynamic positional bias</a>\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom x_transformers import TransformerWrapper, Decoder\n\nmodel = TransformerWrapper(\n    num_tokens = 256,\n    max_seq_len = 1024,\n    attn_layers = Decoder(\n        dim = 512,\n        depth = 6,\n        heads = 8,\n        dynamic_pos_bias = True,                # set this to True\n        dynamic_pos_bias_log_distance = False   # whether to use log distance, as in SwinV2\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### ALiBi Positional Embedding\n\n<a href=\"https://ofir.io/train_short_test_long.pdf\">This paper</a> proposes to simply apply a static linear bias to the attention matrix. The authors show this is not only effective as a relative positional encoding, but also allows the attention net to extrapolate to greater sequences length than what it was trained on, for autoregressive language models.\n\nThis repository also offers a bidirectional variant (nonsymmetric), proposed by the authors <a href=\"https://github.com/ofirpress/attention_with_linear_biases/issues/5\">here</a>. However, this is untested. If you need bidirectional length extrapolation, the safest option would be Dynamic Position Bias\n\nUpdate: It may be that ALiBi enforces a strong local attention across the heads, and may hinder it from attending at distances greater than 1k. To avoid any issues with global message passing, I've decided to introduce another hyperparameter `alibi_num_heads`, so one can specify less heads for the ALiBi bias\n\nUpdate: There are reports that ALiBi outperform Rotary embeddings for pretraining and downstream fine-tuning.\n\nUpdate: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19466\">New paper</a> shows that no positional embedding can length extrapolate even than explicit ones\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom x_transformers import TransformerWrapper, Decoder\n\nmodel = TransformerWrapper(\n    num_tokens = 20000,\n    max_seq_len = 1024,\n    attn_layers = Decoder(\n        dim = 512,\n        depth = 6,\n        heads = 8,\n        alibi_pos_bias = True, # turns on ALiBi positional embedding\n        alibi_num_heads = 4    # only use ALiBi for 4 out of the 8 heads, so other 4 heads can still attend far distances\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Shifted Tokens\n\nAn <a href=\"https://github.com/BlinkDL\">independent researcher</a> has found that shifting a subset of the feature dimension along the sequence dimension by 1 token helps with convergence (<a href=\"https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/191393788\">Time-mixing</a>). I have tested this for the autoregressive case and can confirm that it leads to greatly improved convergence. This also lines up with <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07477\">the results</a> of some papers in the vision domain.\n\nTo use it, simply set `shift_tokens = 1` (or to whatever number of shifts you desire). The feature dimension will be divided by `shift_tokens + 1` and then each chunk will be shifted `[0, shift_tokens]` respectively\n\nUpdate: new experiments by @sdtblck suggests this may only work for character-level training\n\nUpdate: after more experiments, it seems that in the context of BPE encoding, with rotary turned on, there is no benefit to shifting. for character-level training, shifting may still improve a tiny bit\n\nUpdate: When doing BPE encoded tokens, it seems that shift of 2 will bottleneck the dimensions (divided by 5). It is recommended you always do a shift of 1, unless if you are working with character level.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom x_transformers import TransformerWrapper, Decoder\n\nmodel = TransformerWrapper(\n    num_tokens = 20000,\n    max_seq_len = 1024,\n    attn_layers = Decoder(\n        dim = 512,\n        depth = 6,\n        heads = 8,\n        shift_tokens = 1\n    )\n)\n```\n\nIf you want finer control over how much is shifted per block (whether attention or feedforward), simply pass in a tuple of size that is equal to the number of layers.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom x_transformers import TransformerWrapper, Decoder\n\nmodel = TransformerWrapper(\n    num_tokens = 20000,\n    max_seq_len = 1024,\n    attn_layers = Decoder(\n        dim = 512,\n        depth = 6,\n        heads = 8,\n        shift_tokens = (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) # 12 blocks, attention and feedforward alternating, with progressively less shifting\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Sandwich Norm\n\n<img src=\"./images/sandwich_norm.png\" width=\"400px\"/>\n\nThis technique first made an appearance in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13290\">the CoqView paper</a>, a Chinese version of the famous text-to-image transformer DALL-E. They propose, when using pre-layernorm, to add an extra layernorm to all the branch outputs. I have found this to be very effective for a number of projects, when facing instability during training.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom x_transformers import TransformerWrapper, Decoder\n\nmodel = TransformerWrapper(\n    num_tokens = 20000,\n    max_seq_len = 1024,\n    attn_layers = Decoder(\n        dim = 512,\n        depth = 6,\n        heads = 8,\n        sandwich_norm = True # set this to True\n    )\n)\n\nx = torch.randint(0, 20000, (1, 1024))\nmodel(x)\n```\n\n### ResiDual\n\n<img src=\"./images/resi_dual.png\" width=\"400px\"/>\n\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14802\">This Microsoft paper</a> proposes yet another normalization configuration, combining both pre and post layernorm. They claim this hybridization reduces representation collapse (known to be an issue with pre-layernorm with increasing depth), while maintaining stability and reducing vanishing gradients (issues with post-layernorm). Initial experiments on my end show it to work no worse than pre-layernorm or sandwich norm. More study needed by the public to see if this is actually a winning technique.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom x_transformers import TransformerWrapper, Decoder\n\nmodel = TransformerWrapper(\n    num_tokens = 20000,\n    max_seq_len = 1024,\n    attn_layers = Decoder(\n        dim = 512,\n        depth = 6,\n        heads = 8,\n        resi_dual = True,               # set this to True\n        resi_dual_scale = 0.1           # in appendix, they said on fp16 the prenorm residual is prone to overflow. they claim by scaling it at each layer by a factor, it would prevent the overflow, and keep results the same (as layernorms are invariant to scaling of the input)\n    )\n)\n\nx = torch.randint(0, 20000, (1, 1024))\nmodel(x)\n```\n\n### Normformer\n\n<img src=\"./images/normformer.png\" width=\"400px\"/>\n\nThis <a href=\"https://openreview.net/forum?id=GMYWzWztDx5\">paper</a> uncovers an issue with pre-norm transformers where gradients are mismatched between the early and later layers. They propose 4 changes, of which I will be offering 3.\n\nThe first change is to offer per head scaling after aggregating the values in attention. My experiments show a slight improvement in convergence.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom x_transformers import TransformerWrapper, Decoder\n\nmodel = TransformerWrapper(\n    num_tokens = 20000,\n    max_seq_len = 1024,\n    attn_layers = Decoder(\n        dim = 512,\n        depth = 6,\n        heads = 8,\n        attn_head_scale = True  # set this to True\n    )\n)\n\nx = torch.randint(0, 20000, (1, 1024))\nmodel(x)\n```\n\nThe second change is an extra layernorm right after the activation in the feedforward. I have also verified a slight improvement, at the cost of extra compute.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom x_transformers import TransformerWrapper, Decoder\n\nmodel = TransformerWrapper(\n    num_tokens = 20000,\n    max_seq_len = 1024,\n    attn_layers = Decoder(\n        dim = 512,\n        depth = 6,\n        heads = 8,\n        ff_post_act_ln = True # set this to True\n    )\n)\n\nx = torch.randint(0, 20000, (1, 1024))\nmodel(x)\n```\n\nFor the residual scaling, you simply have to set `scale_residual = True`. I have noticed slight improvements, but occasional instability as well, so use with caution.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom x_transformers import TransformerWrapper, Decoder\n\nmodel = TransformerWrapper(\n    num_tokens = 20000,\n    max_seq_len = 1024,\n    attn_layers = Decoder(\n        dim = 512,\n        depth = 6,\n        heads = 8,\n        scale_residual = True # set this to True\n    )\n)\n\nx = torch.randint(0, 20000, (1, 1024))\nmodel(x)\n```\n\nThe last change is a layernorm right after the outwards projection in attention. This is actually identical to the sandwich norm proposed by the Coqview paper, so you can use this by simply setting `sandwich_norm = True`, although it would also add it to the feedforward layer.\n\n### Cosine Sim Attention\n\n<img src=\"./images/cosine-sim-attention.png\" width=\"400px\"></img>\n\nThis <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04245\">paper</a> proposes to l2 normalize the queries and keys along the head dimension before the dot product (cosine similarity), with the additional change of the scale being learned rather than static. The normalization prevents the attention operation from overflowing, and removes any need for numerical stability measures prior to softmax. Both are perennial problems when training transformers.\n\nThis was validated at scale recently by the training of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09883\">a 3B parameter vision transformer</a>. The SwinV2 paper also proposes to change the pre-layernorm to a post-layernorm for further stability.\n\nI have validated that this works just as well as dot product attention in an autoregressive setting, if one were to initialize the temperature as proposed in the QK-norm paper (as a function of the sequence length).\n\nThis flavor of attention also has <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05498\">a connection</a> to sparse distributed memory. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THIIk7LR9_8\">[youtube talk]</a>\n\nUpdate: I have discovered a way to remove the learned temperature altogether, by grouping the feature dimension and doing l2-normalization on each group. This allows the queries and keys to have a similarity that is upper bounded by the number of groups. A group size of 8 or 16 was sufficient in my tests. Decided to name this technique \"Grouped QK Normalization\". The drawback is that I believe an attention head dimension 32 is too small to use this tactic (a dimension often used in vision)\n\nUpdate 2: Tero Karras has successfully used cosine sim attention in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02696\">a new paper</a>.\n\nYou can use it as follows\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom x_transformers import TransformerWrapper, Decoder\n\nmodel = TransformerWrapper(\n    num_tokens = 20000,\n    max_seq_len = 1024,\n    attn_layers = Decoder(\n        dim = 512,\n        depth = 6,\n        heads = 8,\n        attn_qk_norm = True,       # set this to True\n        attn_qk_norm_groups = 8    # number of groups in the feature dimension for l2norm, similarity scores will be bounded between [-group, group]. determines how sharp the attention can be\n    )\n)\n\nx = torch.randint(0, 20000, (1, 1024))\nmodel(x)\n```\n\nAnother update: Simply scaling the cosine similarity (group of 1) with a fixed constant (10) may work too\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom x_transformers import TransformerWrapper, Decoder\n\nmodel = TransformerWrapper(\n    num_tokens = 20000,\n    max_seq_len = 1024,\n    attn_layers = Decoder(\n        dim = 512,\n        depth = 6,\n        heads = 8,\n        attn_qk_norm = True,       # set to True\n        attn_qk_norm_scale = 10    # new scale on the similarity, with groups of 1\n    )\n)\n\nx = torch.randint(0, 20000, (1, 1024))\nmodel(x)\n```\n\n### QK RMSNorm\n\n<img src=\"./images/qknorm-analysis.png\" width=\"450px\"></img>\n\nUpdate: Google Brain has proven out something similar to cosine sim attention in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05442\">a 22B parameter model</a>. In their papers, they have analysis showing that the normalization resulted in not only extra stability, but also better results in the end (due to less need to adjust learning rate when increasing parameter count).\n\nWe are nearing the point of wiping out a source of transformer training instability with one simple intervention, in my opinion. The only slight difference in the paper is that they still have a learned scale across the feature dimension (per use of rmsnorm). Not sure how critical this is, but just to make sure we don't miss anything, I will include this here. You can use this by setting `qk_norm_dim_scale = True`\n\nUpdate: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tim_Dettmers/status/1625531080513306627\">Counterpoint from Tim Dettmers</a>\n\nUpdate 2: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19268\">Counter</a> to Tim's assertion that outliers are needed, and potentially even <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12929\">some solutions</a>\n\nUpdate 3: Used by <a href=\"https://www.adept.ai/blog/persimmon-8b\">8B parameter LLM</a> successfully\n\nUpdate 4: a MetaAI group found that they can <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16588\">alleviate outliers</a> by adding `register tokens`, also known as `memory tokens` from earlier literature (Burtsev et al). Perhaps what should be tried next is see if qk norm can be improved in the presence of memory tokens.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom x_transformers import TransformerWrapper, Decoder\n\nmodel = TransformerWrapper(\n    num_tokens = 20000,\n    max_seq_len = 1024,\n    attn_layers = Decoder(\n        dim = 512,\n        depth = 12,\n        heads = 8,\n        attn_qk_norm = True,\n        attn_qk_norm_dim_scale = True # set this to True, in addition to `attn_qk_norm = True`\n    )\n)\n\nx = torch.randint(0, 256, (1, 1024))\nmodel(x)\n```\n\n### Turning off absolute positional embedding\n\nA number of papers have hinted that causal transformers (`Decoder`) can learn absolute positions in the absence of added embeddings of any sort. This was recently thoroughly investigated <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16634\">here</a>. You can turn off the absolute positional embedding by setting `use_abs_pos_emb = False` in the `TransformerWrapper`\n\nGiven <a href=\"https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/04/pathways-language-model-palm-scaling-to.html\">PaLM</a>, the trend going forward may be to forgo absolute positional embedding (again, for causal transformers only), and add relative positional embeddings with RoPE, ALiBi, etc.\n\nUpdate: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19466\">This paper</a> shows that in the absence of any engineered absolute or relative positional embeddings, decoders can generate implicit positions, and even length generalize better than solutions of the past. They were unaware of dynamic positional bias, however.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom x_transformers import TransformerWrapper, Decoder\n\nmodel = TransformerWrapper(\n    num_tokens = 20000,\n    max_seq_len = 1024,\n    use_abs_pos_emb = False,   # set this to False\n    attn_layers = Decoder(\n        dim = 512,\n        depth = 6,\n        heads = 8,\n    )\n)\n\nx = torch.randint(0, 20000, (1, 1024))\nmodel(x)\n```\n\n### Forgetful Causal Mask\n\n<img src=\"./images/fcm.png\" width=\"450px\"></img>\n\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13432\">This paper</a> shows convincing results that one can combine masking (from masked language modeling) with autoregressive training, leading to significantly better results.\n\nYou can use this by setting the `mask_prob` on the `AutoregressiveWrapper` class\n\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom x_transformers import TransformerWrapper, Decoder, AutoregressiveWrapper\n\nmodel = TransformerWrapper(\n    num_tokens = 20000,\n    max_seq_len = 1024,\n    attn_layers = Decoder(\n        dim = 512,\n        depth = 12,\n        heads = 8\n    )\n)\n\nmodel = AutoregressiveWrapper(\n    model,\n    mask_prob = 0.15  # in paper, they use 15%, same as BERT\n).cuda()\n\n# mock data\n\nx = torch.randint(0, 20000, (1, 1024)).cuda()\n\n# derive cross entropy loss, masking all taken care of\n\nloss = model(x)\nloss.backward()\n```\n\n\n## Miscellaneous\n\n### Cross Attention\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom x_transformers import Encoder, CrossAttender\n\nenc = Encoder(dim = 512, depth = 6)\nmodel = CrossAttender(dim = 512, depth = 6)\n\nnodes = torch.randn(1, 1, 512)\nnode_masks = torch.ones(1, 1).bool()\n\nneighbors = torch.randn(1, 5, 512)\nneighbor_masks = torch.ones(1, 5).bool()\n\nencoded_neighbors = enc(neighbors, mask = neighbor_masks)\nmodel(nodes, context = encoded_neighbors, mask = node_masks, context_mask = neighbor_masks) # (1, 1, 512)\n\n```\n\n### Continuous Embeddings\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom x_transformers import ContinuousTransformerWrapper, Decoder\n\nmodel = ContinuousTransformerWrapper(\n    dim_in = 32,\n    dim_out = 100,\n    max_seq_len = 1024,\n    attn_layers = Decoder(\n        dim = 512,\n        depth = 12,\n        heads = 8\n    )\n)\n\nx = torch.randn((1, 1024, 32))\nmask = torch.ones(1, 1024).bool()\n\nmodel(x, mask = mask) # (1, 1024, 100)\n```\n\nYou can also train a transformer that accepts continuous values autoregressively easily, in the same scheme as done successfully in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05329\">this paper</a>\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom x_transformers import ContinuousTransformerWrapper, Decoder\nfrom x_transformers import ContinuousAutoregressiveWrapper\n\nmodel = ContinuousTransformerWrapper(\n    dim_in = 777,\n    dim_out = 777,\n    max_seq_len = 1024,\n    attn_layers = Decoder(\n        dim = 512,\n        depth = 12,\n        heads = 8\n    )\n)\n\n# wrap it with the continuous autoregressive wrapper\n\nmodel = ContinuousAutoregressiveWrapper(model)\n\n# mock data\n\nx = torch.randn((1, 1024, 777))\nmask = torch.ones(1, 1024).bool()\n\n# train on a lot of data above\n\nloss = model(x, mask = mask)\nloss.backward\n\n# then generate\n\nstart_emb = torch.randn(1, 777)\ngenerated = model.generate(start_emb, 17) # (17, 777)\n```\n\n### xVal - Continuous and Discrete\n\n<img src=\"./images/xval.png\" width=\"400px\"></img>\n\nThis is promising work that resulted from the collaboration across many institutes (collectively known as Polymathic AI). They found that by offering a continuously scaled number token to the transformer, the transformer was able to generalize arithmetic and forecasting tasks better than the alternative encoding schemes.\n\nThis is corroborated by some [prior work](https://github.com/lucidrains/tab-transformer-pytorch#ft-transformer)\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\nfrom x_transformers import (\n    Decoder,\n    XValTransformerWrapper,\n    XValAutoregressiveWrapper\n)\n\nmodel = XValTransformerWrapper(\n    num_tokens = 4,\n    numerical_token_id = 3,\n    max_seq_len = 1024,\n    attn_layers = Decoder(\n        dim = 512,\n        depth = 12,\n        heads = 8\n    )\n)\n\n# wrap it with the xval autoregressive wrapper\n\nmodel = XValAutoregressiveWrapper(model)\n\n# mock data\n\nids = torch.randint(0, 4, (1, 777))\nnums = torch.randn(1, 777)\n\n# train on a lot of data above\n\nloss = model(ids, nums)\nloss.backward()\n\n# then generate\n\nstart_ids = torch.randint(0, 4, (1, 1))\nstart_nums = torch.randn(1, 1)\n\nids_out, num_out, is_number_mask = model.generate(start_ids, start_nums, 17)\n\n# (1, 17), (1, 17), (1, 17)\n\n# discrete, continuous, mask for discrete / continuous\n```\n\n## Citations\n\n```bibtex\n@misc{vaswani2017attention,\n    title   = {Attention Is All You Need},\n    author  = {Ashish Vaswani and Noam Shazeer and Niki Parmar and Jakob Uszkoreit and Llion Jones and Aidan N.
