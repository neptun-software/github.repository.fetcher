For example, we can achieve relation extraction in **standard**, **low-resource (few-shot)**, **document-level** and **multimodal** settings.\n- Each application scenario comprises of three components: **Data** including Tokenizer, Preprocessor and Loader, **Model** including Module, Encoder and Forwarder, **Core** including Training, Evaluation and Prediction. \n\n<br>\n\n# Quick Start\n\n## DeepKE-LLM\n\nIn the era of large models, DeepKE-LLM utilizes a completely new environment dependency.\n\n```\nconda create -n deepke-llm python=3.9\nconda activate deepke-llm\n\ncd example/llm\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nPlease note that the `requirements.txt` file is located in the `example/llm` folder.\n\n## DeepKE\n- *DeepKE* supports `pip install deepke`. <br>Take the fully supervised relation extraction for example.\n- *DeepKE* supports both **manual** and **docker image** environment configuration, you can choose the appropriate way to build.\n- Highly recommended to install deepke in a Linux environment.\n#### 🔧Manual Environment Configuration\n\n**Step1** Download the basic code\n\n```bash\ngit clone --depth 1 https://github.com/zjunlp/DeepKE.git\n```\n\n**Step2** Create a virtual environment using `Anaconda` and enter it.<br>\n\n```bash\nconda create -n deepke python=3.8\n\nconda activate deepke\n```\n\n1. Install *DeepKE* with source code\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   \n   python setup.py install\n   \n   python setup.py develop\n   ```\n\n2. Install *DeepKE* with `pip` (**NOT recommended!**)\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install deepke\n   ```\n   - Please make sure that pip version <= 24.0\n\n**Step3** Enter the task directory\n\n```bash\ncd DeepKE/example/re/standard\n```\n\n**Step4** Download the dataset, or follow the [annotation instructions](https://github.com/zjunlp/DeepKE/blob/main/README_TAG.md) to obtain data\n\n```bash\nwget 120.27.214.45/Data/re/standard/data.tar.gz\n\ntar -xzvf data.tar.gz\n```\n\nMany types of data formats are supported,and details are in each part. \n\n**Step5** Training (Parameters for training can be changed in the `conf` folder)\n\nWe support visual parameter tuning by using *[wandb](https://docs.wandb.ai/quickstart)*.\n\n```bash\npython run.py\n```\n\n**Step6** Prediction (Parameters for prediction can be changed in the `conf` folder)\n\nModify the path of the trained model in `predict.yaml`.The absolute path of the model needs to be used，such as `xxx/checkpoints/2019-12-03_ 17-35-30/cnn_ epoch21.pth`.\n\n```bash\npython predict.py\n```\n\n - **❗NOTE: if you encounter any errors, please refer to the [Tips](#tips) or submit a GitHub issue.**\n\n\n\n#### 🐳Building With Docker Images\n**Step1** Install the Docker client\n\nInstall Docker and start the Docker service.\n\n**Step2** Pull the docker image and run the container\n\n```bash\ndocker pull zjunlp/deepke:latest\ndocker run -it zjunlp/deepke:latest /bin/bash\n```\n\nThe remaining steps are the same as **Step 3 and onwards** in **Manual Environment Configuration**.\n\n - **❗NOTE: You can refer to the [Tips](#tips) to speed up installation**\n\n## Requirements\n\n\n### DeepKE\n> python == 3.8\n\n- torch>=1.5,<=1.11\n- hydra-core==1.0.6\n- tensorboard==2.4.1\n- matplotlib==3.4.1\n- transformers==4.26.0\n- jieba==0.42.1\n- scikit-learn==0.24.1\n- seqeval==1.2.2\n- opt-einsum==3.3.0\n- wandb==0.12.7\n- ujson==5.6.0\n- huggingface_hub==0.11.0\n- tensorboardX==2.5.1\n- nltk==3.8\n- protobuf==3.20.1\n- numpy==1.21.0\n- ipdb==0.13.11\n- pytorch-crf==0.7.2\n- tqdm==4.66.1\n- openai==0.28.0\n- Jinja2==3.1.2\n- datasets==2.13.2\n- pyhocon==0.3.60\n\n<br>\n\n## Introduction of Three Functions\n\n### 1. Named Entity Recognition\n\n- Named entity recognition seeks to locate and classify named entities mentioned in unstructured text into pre-defined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, organizations, etc.\n\n- The data is stored in `.txt` files. Some instances as following (Users can label data based on the tools [Doccano](https://github.com/doccano/doccano), [MarkTool](https://github.com/FXLP/MarkTool), or they can use the [Weak Supervision](https://github.com/zjunlp/DeepKE/blob/main/example/ner/prepare-data) with DeepKE to obtain data automatically):\n\n  |                           Sentence                           |           Person           |    Location    |          Organization          |\n  | :----------------------------------------------------------: | :------------------------: | :------------: | :----------------------------: |\n  | 本报北京9月4日讯记者杨涌报道：部分省区人民日报宣传发行工作座谈会9月3日在4日在京举行。 |            杨涌            |      北京      |            人民日报            |\n  | 《红楼梦》由王扶林导演，周汝昌、王蒙、周岭等多位专家参与制作。 | 王扶林，周汝昌，王蒙，周岭 |            |  |\n  | 秦始皇兵马俑位于陕西省西安市,是世界八大奇迹之一。 |           秦始皇           | 陕西省，西安市 |                          |\n\n- Read the detailed process in specific README\n  - **[STANDARD (Fully Supervised)](https://github.com/zjunlp/DeepKE/tree/main/example/ner/standard)**\n    \n    ***We [support LLM](https://github.com/zjunlp/DeepKE/tree/main/example/llm) and provide the off-the-shelf model, [DeepKE-cnSchema-NER](https://github.com/zjunlp/DeepKE/blob/main/README_CNSCHEMA_CN.md), which will extract entities in cnSchema without training.***\n\n    **Step1** Enter  `DeepKE/example/ner/standard`.  Download the dataset.\n\n    ```bash\n    wget 120.27.214.45/Data/ner/standard/data.tar.gz\n    \n    tar -xzvf data.tar.gz\n    ```\n\n    **Step2** Training<br>\n\n    The dataset and parameters can be customized in the `data` folder and `conf` folder respectively.\n  \n    ```bash\n    python run.py\n    ```\n\n    **Step3** Prediction\n\n    ```bash\n    python predict.py\n    ```\n  \n  - **[FEW-SHOT](https://github.com/zjunlp/DeepKE/tree/main/example/ner/few-shot)**\n\n    **Step1** Enter  `DeepKE/example/ner/few-shot`.  Download the dataset.\n\n    ```bash\n    wget 120.27.214.45/Data/ner/few_shot/data.tar.gz\n    \n    tar -xzvf data.tar.gz\n    ```\n  \n    **Step2** Training in the low-resouce setting <br>\n  \n    The directory where the model is loaded and saved and the configuration parameters can be cusomized in the `conf` folder.\n  \n    ```bash\n    python run.py +train=few_shot\n    ```\n    \n    Users can modify `load_path` in `conf/train/few_shot.yaml` to use existing loaded model.<br>\n    \n    **Step3** Add `- predict` to `conf/config.yaml`, modify `loda_path` as the model path and `write_path` as the path where the predicted results are saved in `conf/predict.yaml`, and then run `python predict.py`\n    \n    ```bash\n    python predict.py\n    ```\n\n  - **[MULTIMODAL](https://github.com/zjunlp/DeepKE/tree/main/example/ner/multimodal)**\n\n    **Step1** Enter  `DeepKE/example/ner/multimodal`.

Recommend download pretrained models before use and save them in the `pretrained` folder. Read `README.md` in every task directory to check the specific requirement for saving pretrained models.\n\n4.The old version of *DeepKE* is in the [deepke-v1.0](https://github.com/zjunlp/DeepKE/tree/deepke-v1.0) branch. Users can change the branch to use the old version. The old version has been totally transfered to the standard relation extraction ([example/re/standard](https://github.com/zjunlp/DeepKE/blob/main/example/re/standard/README.md)).\n\n5.If you want to modify the source code, it's recommended to install *DeepKE* with source codes. If not, the modification will not work. See [issue](https://github.com/zjunlp/DeepKE/issues/117)\n\n6.More related low-resource knowledge extraction  works can be found in [Knowledge Extraction in Low-Resource Scenarios: Survey and Perspective](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08063.pdf).\n\n7.Make sure the exact versions of requirements in `requirements.txt`.\n\n# To do\nIn next version, we plan to release a stronger LLM for KE. \n\nMeanwhile, we will offer long-term maintenance to **fix bugs**, **solve issues** and meet **new requests**.

DeepKE为三个知识抽取功能（命名实体识别、关系抽取和属性抽取）设计了一个统一的框架\n- 可以在不同场景下实现不同功能。比如，可以在标准全监督、低资源少样本、文档级和多模态设定下进行关系抽取\n- 每一个应用场景由三个部分组成：Data部分包含Tokenizer、Preprocessor和Loader，Model部分包含Module、Encoder和Forwarder，Core部分包含Training、Evaluation和Prediction\n\n\n<br>\n\n# 快速上手\n\n## DeepKE-LLM\n大模型时代, DeepKE-LLM采用全新的环境依赖，强烈建议使用linux环境安装\n```\nconda create -n deepke-llm python=3.9\nconda activate deepke-llm\n\ncd example/llm\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n注意！！是example/llm文件夹下的 `requirements.txt`\n\n## DeepKE\n- DeepKE支持pip安装使用，下以常规关系抽取场景为例\n- DeepKE支持手动环境部署与容器部署，您可任选一种方法进行安装\n- 强烈建议使用linux环境安装！\n#### 🔧 手动环境部署\n**Step 1**：下载代码 ```git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/zjunlp/DeepKE.git```（别忘记star和fork哈！！！）\n\n**Step 2**：使用anaconda创建虚拟环境，进入虚拟环境（提供[Dockerfile](https://github.com/zjunlp/DeepKE/tree/main/docker)源码和[教程](https://github.com/zjunlp/DeepKE/issues/320)可自行创建镜像；可参考[备注（常见问题）](#备注常见问题)使用镜像加速）\n\n```bash\nconda create -n deepke python=3.8\n\nconda activate deepke\n```\n1） 基于pip安装，直接使用 （**不建议使用此方法，存在python包兼容冲突风险**）\n\n```bash\npip install deepke\n```\n- 请确保您当前的pip版本<=24.0\n  \n2） 基于源码安装\n\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\npython setup.py install\n\npython setup.py develop\n```\n\n**Step 3** ：进入任务文件夹，以常规关系抽取为例\n\n```\ncd DeepKE/example/re/standard\n```\n\n**Step 4**：下载数据集，或根据[数据标注说明](https://github.com/zjunlp/DeepKE/blob/main/README_TAG_CN.md)标注数据\n```\nwget 120.27.214.45/Data/re/standard/data.tar.gz\n\ntar -xzvf data.tar.gz\n```\n\n支持多种数据类型格式，具体请见各部分子README。\n\n**Step 5** ：模型训练，训练用到的参数可在conf文件夹内修改\n\nDeepKE使用[wandb](https://docs.wandb.ai/quickstart)支持可视化调参\n\n```\npython run.py\n```\n\n**Step 6** ：模型预测。预测用到的参数可在conf文件夹内修改\n\n修改`conf/predict.yaml`中保存训练好的模型路径。需使用模型的绝对路径。如`xxx/checkpoints/2019-12-03_17-35-30/cnn_epoch21.pth`。\n```\npython predict.py\n```\n- **❗注意: 如果您在安装或使用过程中遇到任何问题，您可以查看[备注（常见问题）](#备注常见问题) 或提交 GitHub issue.**\n\n#### 🐳 基于容器部署\n\n**Step1** 下载Docker客户端\n\n从官网下载Docker客户端并启动Docker服务\n\n**Step2** 拉取镜像并运行容器\n\n```bash\ndocker pull zjunlp/deepke:latest\ndocker run -it zjunlp/deepke:latest /bin/bash\n```\n\n剩余步骤同**手动环境部署**一节中的**Step 3**及后续步骤相同\n\n - **❗注意: 您可以参考 [Tips](#tips) 来加速您的部署**\n<br>\n\n## 环境依赖\n\n\n### DeepKE\n\n> python

`README.md`。\n\n5.DeepKE老版本位于[deepke-v1.0](https://github.com/zjunlp/DeepKE/tree/deepke-v1.0)分支，用户可切换分支使用老版本，老版本的能力已全部迁移到标准设定关系抽取([example/re/standard](https://github.com/zjunlp/DeepKE/blob/main/example/re/standard/README.md))中。\n\n6.如果您需要在源码的基础上进行修改，建议使用`python setup.py install`方式安装*DeepKE*，如未使用该方式安装，源码修改部分不会生效，见[问题](https://github.com/zjunlp/DeepKE/issues/117)。\n\n7.更多的低资源抽取工作可查阅论文 [Knowledge Extraction in Low-Resource Scenarios: Survey and Perspective](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08063.pdf)。\n\n8.确保使用requirements.txt中对应的各依赖包的版本。\n\n<br>\n\n# 未来计划\n\n- 在DeepKE的下一个版本中发布优化后的中英双语抽取大模型\n- 我们提供长期技术维护和答疑解惑。如有疑问，请提交issues\n\n\n#

We provide [documents](https://zjunlp.github.io/DeepKE/), [Google Colab tutorials](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1vS8YJhJltzw3hpJczPt24O0Azcs3ZpRi?usp=sharing), [online demo](http://deepke.zjukg.cn/), and [slides](https://github.com/zjunlp/DeepKE/blob/main/docs/slides/Slides-DeepKE-en.pdf) for beginners.\n\nTo promote efficient Chinese knowledge graph construction, we provide DeepKE-cnSchema, a specific version of DeepKE, containing off-the-shelf models based on [cnSchema](https://github.com/OpenKG-ORG/cnSchema). DeepKE-cnSchema supports multiple tasks such as Chinese entity extraction and relation extraction. It can extract 50 relation types and 28 entity types, including common entity types such as person, location, city, institution, etc and the common relation types such as ancestral home, birthplace, nationality and other types.\n\n## Chinese Model Download\n\nFor entity extraction and relation extraction tasks, we provide models based on `RoBERTa-wwm-ext, Chinese` and `BERT-wwm, Chinese` respectively.\n\n| Model                                               | Task                          |                                     Google Download                                     |                              Baidu Netdisk Download                               |\n| :-------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------- |:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|\n| **`DeepKE(NER), RoBERTa-wwm-ext, Chinese`** | **entity extraction**   | **[PyTorch](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1T3xf_MXRaVqLV-ST4VqvKoaQqQgRpp67)** |   **[Pytorch（password:u022）](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1hb9XEbK4x5fIyco4DgZZfg)**   |\n| **`DeepKE(NER), BERT-wwm, Chinese`**        | **entity extraction**   | **[PyTorch](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zA8Ichx9nzU3GD92ptdyR_nmARB_7ovg)** |   **[Pytorch（password:1g0t）](https://pan.baidu.com/s/10TWE1VA2S-SJgmOm8szRxw)**   |\n| **`DeepKE(NER), BiLSTM-CRF, Chinese`**      | **entity extraction** | **[PyTorch](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1n1tzvl6hZYoUUFFWLfkuhkXPx5JB4XK_)** |   **[Pytorch（password:my4x）](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1a9ZFFZVQUxmlbLmbVBaTqQ)**   |\n| **`DeepKE(RE), RoBERTa-wwm-ext, Chinese`**  | **relation extraction** | **[PyTorch](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wb_QIZduKDwrHeri0s5byibsSQrrJTEv)** |   **[Pytorch（password:78pq）](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1ozFsxExAQTBRs5NbJW7W5g)**   |\n| **`DeepKE(RE), BERT-wwm, Chinese`**         | **relation extraction** | **[PyTorch](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wb_QIZduKDwrHeri0s5byibsSQrrJTEv)** |   **[Pytorch（password:6psm）](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1ngvTwg_ZXaenxhOeadWoCA)**   |\n\n### Instructions\n\nIt is recommended to use Baidu Netdisk download in Chinese Mainland, and Google download for overseas users.\n\nAs for the entity extraction model, take pytoch version `DeepKE(RE), RoBERTa-wwm-ext, Chinese` as an example. After downloading, files of the model are obtained:\n\n```\ncheckpoints_robert\n    |- added_tokens.json          # added tokens\n    |- config.json                # config\n    |- eval_results.txt           # evaluation results\n    |- model_config.json          # model config\n    |- pytorch_model.bin          # model\n    |- special_tokens_map.json    # special tokens map\n    |- tokenizer_config.bin       # tokenizer config\n    |- vocab.txt                  # vocabulary\n```\n\nwhere `config.json` and `vocab.txt` is completely consistent with the original Google `RoBERTa-wwm-ext, Chinese`. PyTorch version contains `pytorch_model. bin`, `config. json`, `vocab. txt` file.\n\nAs for the relation extraction model, take pytoch version `DeepKE(RE), RoBERTa-wwm-ext, Chinese` as an example. The model is pth file after downloading.\n\n**After downloading the model, users can directly [quick-load](#Quick-Load) it to extract entity and relation.**\n\n## Datasets and Chinese Baseline Performance\n\n### Datasets\n\nWe have conduct experiments on Chinese named entity recognition and relation extraction datasets.

[CnSchema](https://github.com/OpenKG-ORG/cnSchema) is developed for Chinese information processing, which uses advanced knowledge graphs, natural language processing and machine learning technologies. It integrates structured text data, supports rapid domain knowledge modeling and open data automatic processing across data sources, domains and languages, and provides schema-level support and services for emerging application markets such as intelligent robots, semantic search and intelligent computing. Currently, the Schema types supported by DeepKE-cnSchema are as follows:\n\n#### Entity Schema\n\n| ID | Entity Type | ID | Entity Type | \n| ------------- | :---------- | ------------- | :---------- | \n| 1   | cns:人物 YAS  | 2   | cns:影视作品 TOJ | \n| 3   | cns:目 NGS        | 4   | cns:生物 QCV   | \n| 5   | cns:Number OKB   | 6   | cns:Date BQF | \n| 7   | cns:国家 CAR       | 8   | cns:网站 ZFM   | \n| 9   | cns:网络小说 EMT     | 10  | cns:图书作品 UER | \n| 11  | cns:歌曲 QEE       | 12  | cns:地点 UFT   | \n| 13  | cns:气候 GJS       | 14  | cns:行政区 SVA  | \n| 15  | cns:TEXT ANO     | 16  | cns:历史人物 KEJ | \n| 17  | cns:学校 ZDI       | 18  | cns:企业 CAT   | \n| 19  | cns:出版社 GCK      | 20  | cns:书籍 FQK   | \n| 21  | cns:音乐专辑 BAK     | 22  | cns:城市 RET   | \n| 23  | cns:景点 QZP       | 24  | cns:电视综艺 QAQ | \n| 25  | cns:机构 ZRE       | 26  | cns:作品 TDZ   | \n| 27  | cns:语言 CVC       | 28  | cns:学科专业 PMN | \n\n#### Relation Schema\n\n| ID | Head Entity Type | Tail Entity Type | Relation | ID | Head Entity Type | Tail Entity Type | Relation |\n| --- |:------ |:-----:| ---- | --- |:------ |:-----:| ---- |\n| 1   | cns:地点     | cns:人物    | cns:祖籍   | 2   | cns:人物     | cns:人物    | cns:父亲   |\n| 3   | cns:地点     | cns:企业    | cns:总部地点 | 4   | cns:地点     | cns:人物    | cns:出生地  |\n| 5   | cns:目      | cns:生物    | cns:目    | 6   | cns:Number | cns:行政区   | cns:面积   |\n| 7   | cns:Text   | cns:机构    | cns:简称   | 8   | cns:Date   | cns:影视作品  | cns:上映时间 |\n| 9   | cns:人物     | cns:人物    | cns:妻子   | 10  | cns:音乐专辑   | cns:歌曲    | cns:所属专辑 |\n| 11  | cns:Number | cns:企业    | cns:注册资本 | 12  | cns:城市     | cns:国家    | cns:首都   |\n| 13  | cns:人物     | cns:影视作品  | cns:导演   | 14  | cns:Text   | cns:历史人物  | cns:字    |\n| 15  | cns:Number | cns:人物    | cns:身高   | 16  | cns:企业     | cns:影视作品  | cns:出品公司 |\n| 17  | cns:Number | cns:学科专业  | cns:修业年限 | 18  | cns:Date   | cns:人物    | cns:出生日期 |\n| 19  | cns:人物     | cns:影视作品  | cns:制片人  | 20  | cns:人物     | cns:人物    | cns:母亲   |\n| 21  | cns:人物     | cns:影视作品  | cns:编辑   | 22  | cns:国家     | cns:人物    | cns:国籍   |\n| 23  | cns:人物     | cns:影视作品  | cns:编剧   | 24  | cns:网站     | cns:网站小说  | cns:连载网络 |\n| 25  | cns:人物     | cns:人物    | cns:丈夫   | 26  | cns:Text   | cns:历史人物  | cns:朝代   |\n| 27  | cns:Text   | cns:人物    | cns:民族   | 28  | cns:Text   | cns:历史人物  | cns:号   |\n| 29  | cns:出版社    | cns:书籍    | cns:出版社  | 30  | cns:人物     | cns:电视综艺  | cns:主持人  |\n| 31  | cns:Text   | cns:学科专业  | cns:专业代码 | 32  | cns:人物     | cns:歌曲    | cns:歌手   |\n| 33  | cns:人物     | cns:歌曲    | cns:作曲   | 34  | cns:人物     | cns:网络小说  | cns:主角   |\n| 35  | cns:人物     | cns:企业    | cns:董事长  | 36  | cns:Date   | cns:企业    | cns:成立时间 |\n| 37  | cns:学校     | cns:人物    | cns:毕业院校 | 38  | cns:Number | cns:机构    | cns:占地面积 |\n| 39  | cns:语言     | cns:国家    | cns:官方语言 | 40  | cns:Text   | cns:行政区   | cns:人口数量 |\n| 41  | cns:Number | cns:行政区   | cns:人口数量 | 42  | cns:城市     | cns:景点    | cns:所在城市 |\n| 43  | cns:人物     | cns:图书作品  | cns:作者   | 44  | None   | None    | 其他 |\n| 45  | cns:人物     | cns:歌曲    | cns:作曲   | 46  | cns:人物     | cns:行政区   | cns:气候   |\n| 47  | cns:人物     | cns:电视综艺  | cns:嘉宾   | 48  | cns:人物     | cns:影视作品  | cns:主演   |\n| 49  | cns:作品     | cns:影视作品  | cns:改编自  | 50  | cns:人物     | cns:企业    | cns:创始人  |\n\n\n## Quick Load\n\n### [Named Entity Recognition(NER)](https://github.com/zjunlp/DeepKE/tree/main/example/ner/standard)\n\nUsers can directly download the [model](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zA8Ichx9nzU3GD92ptdyR_nmARB_7ovg) for usage. The details are as follows：\n\n1. Enter the directory `DeepKE/example/ner/standard`\n2. Create the downloaded folder as `checkpoints` and store it in the directory `DeepKE/example/ner/standard`\n3. Set the parameter `text` in `conf/predict.yaml` as the sentence to be predicted, and modify `hydra/model` in `conf/config.yaml` to `bert` or `lstmcrf` according to the category of the downloaded model (the model downloaded from the above link is the `bert` model)\n\t\n \t> To use the trained model, just set the input sentence \"《星空黑夜传奇》是连载于起点中文网的网络小说，作者是啤酒的罪孽\". After running `python oredict.py`, results can be obtained which show that the entity type \"星空黑夜传奇\" is \"网络小说\", \"起点中文网\" is \"网站\" and \"啤酒的罪孽\" is \"人物\".\n  \t> ```\n\t>\ttext=\"《星空黑夜传奇》是连载于起点中文网的网络小说，作者是啤酒的罪孽\"\n\t>\t```\t\n\n\t\t\n4. Predict\n\t```bash\n\tpython predict.py\n\t```\n\n\n\tFinally, output the results:\n\n\t```bash\n\tNER句子：\n\t《星空黑夜传奇》是连载于起点中文网的网络小说，作者是啤酒的罪孽\n\tNER结果：\n\t[('星','B-UER'),('空','I-UER'),('黑','I-UER'),('夜','I-UER'),('传','I-UER'),('奇','I-UER'),('起','B-ZFM'),('点','I-ZFM'),('中','I-ZFM'),('文','I-ZFM'),('网','I-ZFM'),('啤','B-YAS'),('酒','I-YAS'),('的','I-YAS'),('罪','I-YAS'),('孽','I-YAS')]\n\t```\n\n### [Relation Extraction(RE)](https://github.com/zjunlp/DeepKE/tree/main/example/re/standard)\nUsers can directly download the [model](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wb_QIZduKDwrHeri0s5byibsSQrrJTEv) for usage. The details are as follows：\n\n1. Enter the directory `DeepKE/example/re/standard`\n2. Modify the parameter `fp`in `conf/config.yaml`to the path of downloaded file, `num_relations`in `conf/embedding.yaml`to 51(relation nums) and `model` in `conf/config.yaml`to `lm`.\n3. Download the [dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UurqpjePe3zhXxbDDNwLAjVvt7UyUMuQ) , and put files in the directory `example/re/standard/data/origin`.\n4. Predict. The text and entity pairs to be predicted are fed to the program through the terminal.\n\n\t```bash\n\tpython predict.py\n\t```\n\n\tTo use the trained model, run `python predict.py` and input the sentence \"歌曲《人生长路》出自刘德华国语专辑《男人的爱》，由李泉作词作曲，2001年出行发版\". The given entity pair are \"男人的爱\" and \"人生长路\". Finally, the extracted relation is \"所属专辑\".\n\n\tTo change the text to be predicted, modify the `_get_predict_instance`function in `predict.py` to the following example:\n\n\t```python\n\tdef _get_predict_instance(cfg):\n\t    flag = input('是否使用范例[y/n]，退出请输入: exit .... ')\n\t    flag = flag.strip().lower()\n\t    if flag == 'y' or flag == 'yes':\n\t\tsentence = '歌曲《人生长路》出自刘德华国语专辑《男人的爱》，由李泉作词作曲，2001年出行发版'\n\t\thead = '男人的爱'\n\t\ttail = '人生长路'\n\t\thead_type = '所属专辑'\n\t\ttail_type = '歌曲'\n\t    elif flag == 'n' or flag == 'no':\n\t\tsentence = input('请输入句子：')\n\t\thead = input('请输入句中需要预测关系的头实体：')\n\t\thead_type = input('请输入头实体类型（可以为空，按enter跳过）：')\n\t\ttail = input('请输入句中需要预测关系的尾实体：')\n\t\ttail_type = input('请输入尾实体类型（可以为空，按enter跳过）：')\n\t    elif flag == 'exit':\n\t\tsys.exit(0)\n\t    else:\n\t\tprint('please input yes or no, or exit!')\n\t\t_get_predict_instance()\n\n\t    instance = dict()\n\t    instance['sentence'] = sentence.strip()\n\t    instance['head'] = head.strip()\n\t    instance['tail'] = tail.strip()\n\t    if head_type.strip() == '' or tail_type.strip() == '':\n\t\tcfg.replace_entity_with_type = False\n\t\tinstance['head_type'] = 'None'\n\t\tinstance['tail_type'] = 'None'\n\t    else:\n\t\tinstance['head_type'] = head_type.strip()\n\t\tinstance['tail_type'] = tail_type.strip()\n\n\t    return instance\n\t```\n\n\tFinally, output the results:\n\n\t```bash\n\t“男人的爱”和“人生长路”在句中关系为“所属专辑”，置信度为0.99\n\t```\n \t> Note: The model specified in `example/re/standard/conf/model/lm.yaml` will be automatically downloaded from the huggingface website during runtime. If the download fails, please use the huggingface mirror site or download it manually.\n\n### [Joint Entity and Relation Extraction](https://github.com/zjunlp/DeepKE/tree/main/example/triple)\nAfter aforementioned trained models are downloaded, entites and their relations in a text can be extracted together. If there are more than two entities in one sentence, some predicted entity pairs may be incorrect because these entity pairs are not in training sets and need to be exracted further. The detailed steps are as follows:<br>\n1. In `conf`, modify `text` in `predict.yaml` as the sentence to be predicted, `nerfp` as the directory of the trained NER model and `refp` as the directory of the trained RE model.\n2. Predict\n\t```shell\n\tpython predict.py\n\t```\n\tMany results will be output. Take the input text `此外网易云平台还上架了一系列歌曲，其中包括田馥甄的《小幸运》等` as example.\n\t\n\t(1) Output the result of NER: `[('田', 'B-YAS'), ('馥', 'I-YAS'), ('甄', 'I-YAS'), ('小', 'B-QEE'), ('幸', 'I-QEE'), ('运', 'I-QEE')]`\n\t\n\t(2) Output the processed result: `{'田馥甄': '人物', '小幸运': '歌曲'}`\n\t\n\t(3) Output the result of RE: `\"田馥甄\" 和 \"小幸运\" 在句中关系为：\"歌手\"，置信度为0.92。`\n\t\n\t(4) Output the result as `jsonld`\n\t\n\t ```bash\n\t    {\n\t      \"@context\": {\n\t\t\"歌手\": \"https://cnschema.openkg.cn/item/%E6%AD%8C%E6%89%8B/16693#viewPageContent\"\n\t      },\n\t      \"@id\": \"田馥甄\",\n\t      \"歌手\": {\n\t\t\"@id\": \"小幸运\"\n\t      }\n\t    }\n\t  ```\n\n## Custom Models (Advanced Usage)\n\n### Named Entity Recognition (NER)\n\nIf you need to use customized dataset for training, follow the steps bellow:\n\n1. Download customized [dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zA8Ichx9nzU3GD92ptdyR_nmARB_7ovg) and put it into the `data` folder.\n2. Modify the parameter `bert_model`in `train.yaml`of the `conf`folder to the specify model. Users can choose different models to train by modifying the `yaml`file.\n3. Modify `labels` in `train.yaml` as the labels in `data/type.txt`\n4. Train.\n\t```bash\n\tpython run.py\n\t```\n\n### Relation Extraction (RE)\n\nIf you need to use other models for training, follow the steps bellow:\n\n1、Download the customized [dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wb_QIZduKDwrHeri0s5byibsSQrrJTEv) and rename it to `data`.\n\n2、Modify the parameter `model_name`in `train.yaml`of the `conf`folder to `lm`, `num_relations`in `embedding_yaml`to the number of relations(eg: 51). Users can choose different models to train by modifying the `yaml`file. \n\n3、Train.\n\n\t```bash\n\tpython run.py\n\t```\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Q: How to use this model?**\nA: It is off-the-shelf. After downloading the model, follow the instructions and you can extract the knowledge contained in the predefined cnSchema.\n**If you want to extract knowledge other than cnSchema, you can use the advanced version of customized data for training**\n\n**Q: Is there any other cnSchema extraction model available?**\nA: Unfortunately, we can only support part of knowledge extraction of cnSchema for the time being. More knowledge extraction models will be published in the future.\n\n**Q: I trained better result than you!**\nA: Congratulations!\n\n**Q: Embedding error for customized dataset.**\nA: The Chinese data may contain invisible special characters, which cannot be encoded and thus an error is reported. You can preprocess the Chinese data through the editor or other tools to solve this problem.\n\n## Citation\n\nIf the resources or technologies in this project are helpful to your research work, you are welcome to cite the following papers in your thesis:\n\n```\n@inproceedings{DBLP:conf/emnlp/ZhangXTYYQXCLL22,\n  author    = {Ningyu Zhang and\n               Xin Xu and\n               Liankuan Tao and\n               Haiyang Yu and\n               Hongbin Ye and\n               Shuofei Qiao and\n               Xin Xie and\n               Xiang Chen and\n               Zhoubo Li and\n               Lei Li},\n  editor    = {Wanxiang Che and\n               Ekaterina Shutova},\n  title     = {DeepKE: {A} Deep Learning Based Knowledge Extraction Toolkit for Knowledge\n               Base Population},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the The 2022 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural\n               Language Processing, {EMNLP} 2022 - System Demonstrations, Abu Dhabi,\n               UAE, December 7-11, 2022},\n  pages     = {98--108},\n  publisher = {Association for Computational Linguistics},\n  year      = {2022},\n  url       = {https://aclanthology.org/2022.emnlp-demos.10},\n  timestamp = {Thu, 23 Mar 2023 16:56:00 +0100},\n  biburl    = {https://dblp.org/rec/conf/emnlp/ZhangXTYYQXCLL22.bib},\n  bibsource = {dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org}\n}\n```\n\n## Disclaimers\n\n**The contents of this project are only for technical research reference and shall not be used as any conclusive basis.

Also available for beginners are detailed [documentation](https://zjunlp.github.io/DeepKE/), [Google Colab tutorials](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1vS8YJhJltzw3hpJczPt24O0Azcs3ZpRi?usp=sharing),  [online presentations](http://deepke.zjukg.cn/)and [slideshows](https://github.com/zjunlp/DeepKE/blob/main/docs/slides/Slides-DeepKE-cn.pdf).\n\nIt is well known that data is very important for model training. To facilitate the use of this tool, DeepKE provides detailed annotation of entity identification and relationship extraction data, so that users can obtain training data manually or automatically. The annotated data can be directly used by DeepKE for model training.\n\n## Manual Data Annotation\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/doccano/doccano/master/docs/images/logo/doccano.png\">\n</div>\n\n`doccano` is an open source manual data annotation tool. It provides annotation  functions for **text classification**, **sequence labeling**, and **sequence-to-sequence**. So you can create labeled data for sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, text summaries, and so on. Simply create a project and upload the data and start labeling, and you can build a dataset ready for `DeepKE` training in a matter of hours. Using `doccano` to extract annotation data for entity recognition and relationships is described below.\n\nFor details about doccano installation and configuration, see [Github(doccano)](https://github.com/doccano/doccano)\n\nOnce the server is installed and started, point your browser to  `http://0.0.0.0:8000` and click  **Log in**.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"pics/doccano_home_en.png\">\n</div>\n\n### Entity Recognition\n\n#### Create a Project\n\n- Create a Project. Click `Create` in the upper left corner to jump to the following interface.\n\n  - Select the Sequence Labeling task.\n  - Fill in the necessary information, such as Project name and Description.\n  - Check configurable attributes such as Allow overlapping entity and Use relation labeling **as required**.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"pics/doccano_create_project_en.png\">\n</div>\n\n * When creation is complete, you will automatically be redirected to the project's home page.\n\n#### Adding the corpus\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"pics/doccano_data_format_en.png\">\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n- `doccano` supports a variety of text formats. The differences are as follows:\n  - `Textfile`：The uploaded file is in the format of `txt`. When marking, a whole `txt` file is displayed as one page of content.\n  - `TextLine`：The uploaded file is in the format of `txt`. When marking, a line of text in the `txt` file is displayed as a page of content.\n  - `JSONL`：Short for `JSON Lines`, where each line is a valid `JSON` value;\n  - `CoNLL`： A file in `CoNLL` format. Each line contains a series of tab-separated words.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"pics/doccano_dataset_en.png\">\n</div>\n\n* Click on the tabs of the **Dataset** again, and you'll see that text has been added to the project, one by one, and then you'll mark the text.\n\n#### Data Annotations\n\n- Add task labels\n\n  - The extraction task includes two label types: `Span` and `Relation`. Here, `Span` refers to the target information fragment in the original text, that is, the entity of a certain type in entity recognition.\n  - Fill in the name of the label. In entity recognition, you can write `PER`, `LOC`, `ORG`, etc.\n  - Add the shortcut key corresponding to this label (e.g. set the shortcut key `p` for the `PER` label) and define the label color.\n\n  <div align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"pics/doccano_create_label_en.png\">\n  </div>\n\n  - Then just add the other tags you need in the same way.\n\n- Task annotation\n\n  - Annotate data. Click the `Annotate` button to the far right of each data to annotate.\n  - The example defines two `Span` type tags for people and places.\n\n  <div align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"pics/doccano_annotate_en.png\">\n  </div>\n\n#### Exporting training data\n\n- Click on `Options`, `Export Dataset` in the Dataset column to export the annotated data.\n- The markup data is stored in the same text file, one line per sample and in `jsonl` format, which contains the following fields：\n  - `id`: The unique identifier `ID` of the sample in the dataset.\n  - `text`: Raw text data.\n  - `entities`: The `Span` tags contained in the data, each `Span` tag contains four fields：\n    - `id`: The unique identification ID of `Span` in the dataset.\n    - `start_offset`: The starting position of `Span`.\n    - `end_offset`: The next position from the end of `Span`.\n    - `label`: Type of `Span`.\n\n- Example of exported data\n\n```json\n{\n    \"id\":10,\n    \"text\":\"University of California is located in California, United States.\",\n    \"entities\":[\n        {\n            \"id\":15,\n            \"label\":\"ORG\",\n            \"start_offset\":0,\n            \"end_offset\":24\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\":16,\n            \"label\":\"LOC\",\n            \"start_offset\":39,\n            \"end_offset\":49\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\":17,\n            \"label\":\"LOC\",\n            \"start_offset\":51,\n            \"end_offset\":64\n        }\n    ],\n    \"relations\":[\n        \n    ]\n}\n```\n\n- The input data format for the entity recognition task in `DeepKE` is a `txt` file, with each line including words, separators and labels (see `CoNLL` data format). The exported data will be pre-processed into the `DeepKE` input format for training, please go to the detailed README \n  - [Regular Full Supervision STANDARD](https://github.com/zjunlp/DeepKE/tree/main/example/ner/standard)\n\n### Relation Extraction\n\n- [Create a Project](#Create-a-Project)\n  - Same operation as entity identification, just refer to above.\n- [Adding the corpus](#Adding-the-corpus)\n  - Same operation as entity identification, just refer to above.\n  - **In the input text, the text format `{text}*{head entity}*{tail entity}*{head entity type}*{tail entity type}`, where the head and tail entity types can be empty.**\n\n#### Data Annotations\n\n- Add task labels\n\n  - The extraction task contains two label types: `Span`and `Relation`. The `Relation` type is used here. `Relation` refers to the relation between `Span` in the original text, that is, the relation between two entities in the relation extraction.\n  - Fill in the name of the relationship type. In relation extraction, you can write `Graduation`, `Causal`, etc.\n  - Add the shortcut key corresponding to this relationship type (e.g. set the shortcut key `b` for the `Graduation` label) and define the label color.\n\n  <div align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"pics/doccano_create_label_re_en.png\">\n  </div>\n\n  - Then just add the other tags you need in the same way.\n\n- Task annotation\n\n  - Annotate data. Click the `Annotate` button to the far right of each data to annotate.\n  - First click on the label of the relationship to be annotated, then click on the corresponding head and tail entities in turn to complete the relationship annotation.\n  - The example defines two `Span` type tags, `PER` and `LOC`, followed by the relationship tag `Graduation` between entities. The `Relation` tag points from the `Subject` corresponding entity to the `Object` corresponding entity.\n\n  <div align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"pics/doccano_annotate_re_en.png\">\n  </div>\n\n#### Exporting training data\n\n- Click on `Options`, `Export Dataset` in the Dataset column to export the annotated data.\n- The markup data is stored in the same text file, one line per sample and in `jsonl` format, which contains the following fields：\n\n  - `id`: The unique identifier `ID` of the sample in the dataset.\n  - `text`: Raw text data.\n  - `entities`: The `Span` tags contained in the data, each `Span` tag contains four fields：\n    - `id`: The unique identification ID of `Span` in the dataset.\n    - `start_offset`: The starting position of `Span`.\n    - `end_offset`: The next position from the end of `Span`.\n    - `label`: Type of `Span`.\n\n  - `relations`: `Relation` tags contained in the data, each `Relation` tag contains four fields：\n    - `id`: (`Span1`, `Relation`, `Span2`)Triples are uniquely identified in the dataset by their `ID`, and the same  triple in different samples corresponds to the same `ID`.\n    - `from_id`: The identifier `ID` corresponding to `Span1`.\n    - `to_id`: The identifier `ID` corresponding to `Span2`.\n    - `type`: Type of `Relation` .\n\n- Example of exported data\n\n```json\n{\n    \"id\":13,\n    \"text\":\"The collision resulted in two more crashes in the intersection, including a central concrete truck that was about to turn left onto college ave. *collision*crashes**\",\n    \"entities\":[\n        {\n            \"id\":20,\n            \"label\":\"MISC\",\n            \"start_offset\":4,\n            \"end_offset\":13\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\":21,\n            \"label\":\"MISC\",\n            \"start_offset\":35,\n            \"end_offset\":42\n        }\n    ],\n    \"relations\":[\n        {\n            \"id\":2,\n            \"from_id\":20,\n            \"to_id\":21,\n            \"type\":\"Cause-Effect\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n## Automatic Data Annotation\n\n### Entity Recognition\n\nIn order for users to better use `DeepKE` to complete entity recognition tasks, we provide an easy-to-use **dict matching based** entity recognition **automatic annotation** tool.\n\n#### Dict\n\n- The format of Dict：\n\n  <h3 align=\"left\">\n      <img src=\"https://github.com/zjunlp/DeepKE/blob/main/example/ner/prepare-data/pics/vocab_dict.png?raw=true\", width=375>\n  </h3>\n\n- Two entity Dicts (one in Chinese and one in English) are provided in advance, and the samples are automatically tagged using the entity dictionary + jieba part-of-speech tagging.\n\n  - In Chinese example dict, we adapt [The People's Daily Dataset](https://github.com/OYE93/Chinese-NLP-Corpus/tree/master/NER/People's Daily) . It is a dataset for NER, concentrating on their types of named entities related to persons(PER), locations(LOC), and organizations(ORG).\n  - In English example dict，we adapt Conll dataset. It contains named entities related to persons (PER), locations(LOC), and others (MISC).You can get the Conll dataset with the following command.\n\n  ```shell\n  wget 120.27.214.45/Data/ner/few_shot/data.tar.gz\n  ```\n\n  - Pre-provided dict from Google Drive：\n    - [CN(vocab_dict_cn), EN(vocab_dict_en)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PGANizeTsvEQFYTL8O1jrDLZwk_MPqO0?usp=sharing)\n  - From BaiduNetDisk ： \n    - [CN(vocab_dict_cn), EN(vocab_dict_en)](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1a07W42ZByeZ00MZp5pZgxg) \n    - (x7ba)\n\n- **If you need to build a domain self-built dictionary, please refer to the pre-provided dictionary format (csv)**\n\n  | Entity     | Label |\n  | ---------- | ----- |\n  | Washington | LOC   |\n  | ...        | ...   |\n\n#### Source File\n\n- **The input dictionary** format is `csv` (contains two columns, entities and corresponding labels).\n\n- **Data to be automatically marked** (txt format and separated by lines, as shown in the figure below) should be placed under the `source_data` path, the script will traverse all txt format files in this folder, and automatically mark line by line.\n\n  <h3 align=\"left\">\n      <img src=\"https://github.com/zjunlp/DeepKE/blob/main/example/ner/prepare-data/pics/en_input_data_format.png?raw=true\", width=700>\n  </h3>\n\n#### Output File\n\n- **The output file**(the distribution ratio of `training set`, `validation set`, and `test set` can be customized) can be directly used as training data in DeepKE.\n\n<h3 align=\"left\">\n    <img src=\"https://github.com/zjunlp/DeepKE/blob/main/example/ner/prepare-data/pics/en_output_data_format.png?raw=true\", width=375>\n</h3>\n\n\n#### Environment\n\nImplementation Environment:\n\n- jieba = 0.42.1\n\n#### Args Description\n\n- `language`: `cn` or `en`\n- `source_dir`: Corpus path (traverse all files in txt format under this folder, automatically mark line by line, the default is `source_data`)\n- `dict_dir`: Entity dict path (defaults to `vocab_dict.csv`)\n- `test_rate, dev_rate, test_rate`: The ratio of training_set, validation_set, and test_set (please make sure the sum is `1`, default `0.8:0.1:0.1`)\n\n#### Run\n\n- **Chinese**\n\n```bash\npython prepare_weaksupervised_data.py --language cn --dict_dir vocab_dict_cn.csv\n```\n\n- **English**\n\n```bash\npython prepare_weaksupervised_data.py --language en --dict_dir vocab_dict_en.csv\n```\n\n### Relation extraction\n\nWe provide a simple **distant supervised** based tool to label relation labels for our RE tasks.\n\n#### Source File\n\nWe specify the source file (dataset to be labeled) as `.json` format and include **one** pair of entities, head entity and tail entity respectively. Each piece of data should contain at least the following five items: `sentence`, `head`, `tail`, `head_offset`, `tail_offset`. The detailed json pattern is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"This summer, the United States Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, once again made its presence felt on the cultural scene by sponsoring a photo exhibition, an experimental jazz performance, a classical music concert and a visit from the Whiffenpoofs, Yale University's a cappella singers.\",\n    \"head\": \"Lebanon\",\n    \"tail\": \"Beirut\",\n    \"head_offset\": \"50\",\n    \"tail_offset\": \"42\",\n    //...\n  },\n  //... \n]\n```\n\n#### Triple File\n\nEntity pairs in source file will be matched with the triples in the triple file. The entity pairs will be labeled with the relation type if matched with the triples in triple file. If there is no triples match, the pairs will be labeled as `None` type.\n\nWe provide an [English](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HHkm3RBI3okiu8jGs-Wn0vP_-0hz7pb2?usp=sharing) and a [Chinese](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YpaMpivodG39p53MM9sMpB41q4EoiQhH/view?usp=sharing) triple file respectively. The English triple file comes from `NYT` dataset which contains the following relation types:\n\n```python\n\"/business/company/place_founded\",\n\"/people/person/place_lived\",\n\"/location/country/administrative_divisions\",\n\"/business/company/major_shareholders\",\n\"/sports/sports_team_location/teams\",\n\"/people/person/religion\",\n\"/people/person/place_of_birth\",\n\"/people/person/nationality\",\n\"/location/country/capital\",\n\"/business/company/advisors\",\n\"/people/deceased_person/place_of_death\",\n\"/business/company/founders\",\n\"/location/location/contains\",\n\"/people/person/ethnicity\",\n\"/business/company_shareholder/major_shareholder_of\",\n\"/people/ethnicity/geographic_distribution\",\n\"/people/person/profession\",\n\"/business/person/company\",\n\"/people/person/children\",\n\"/location/administrative_division/country\",\n\"/people/ethnicity/people\",\n\"/sports/sports_team/location\",\n\"/location/neighborhood/neighborhood_of\",\n\"/business/company/industry\"\n```\n\nThe

`labeled_train.json`, `labeled_dev.json`, `labeled_test.json` for the `train`, `dev`, `test` dataset. The format of the output file is as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n\t{\n    \"sentence\": \"This summer, the United States Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, once again made its presence felt on the cultural scene by sponsoring a photo exhibition, an experimental jazz performance, a classical music concert and a visit from the Whiffenpoofs, Yale University's a cappella singers.\",\n    \"head\": \"Lebanon\",\n    \"tail\": \"Beirut\",\n    \"head_offset\": \"50\",\n    \"tail_offset\": \"42\",\n    \"relation\": \"/location/location/contains\",\n    //...\n\t},\n  //...\n]\n```\n\nWe automatically split the source data into three splits with the rate `0.8:0.1:0.1`.You can set your own split rate.\n\n#### Args Description\n\n- `language`: `en` or `cn`\n- `source_file`: data file to be labeled\n- `triple_file`: triple file path\n- `test_rate, dev_rate, test_rate`: The ratio of training_set, validation_set, and test_set (please make sure the sum is `1`, default `0.8:0.1:0.1`)\n\n#### Run\n\n```bash\npython ds_label_data.py --language en --source_file source_data.json --triple_file triple_file.csv\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n- **Q: How much data do I need to mark?**\n  - A：Labeling is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process that can be very costly. Ideally, the more data that is labeled, the better the model will be. But in practice, this is not always possible. On the one hand, it is necessary to combine practical resources and time; on the other hand, it is important to consider the impact of increasing data volume on the improvement of model effectiveness. In entity identification, relationship extraction usually requires a data volume of `10K` or so.\n\n\n- **Q: Is there any labeled data available?**\n  - A: In entity recognition, two entity dictionaries (one each in English and Chinese) are pre-provided to enable automatic annotation of samples.\n- **Q: Automatic labeling of data training models does not work**\n  - A: There are several possible reasons for the poor results of the model：\n    - Automatically annotated, manually annotated data contains a high level of noise \n    - Small data size: Large models with many parameters are overfitted on small datasets. \n  - solution：\n    - Consider checking the quality of the data\n    - Using strategies such as **semi-supervised** training or `Self-Traning`\n    - Increase the volume of data using data enhancement\n\n## References\n\nIf the resources or techniques in this project have been useful to your research, you are welcome to cite the following paper in your thesis.\n\n```\n@article{zhang2022deepke,\n  title={DeepKE: A Deep Learning Based Knowledge Extraction Toolkit for Knowledge Base Population},\n  author={Zhang, Ningyu and Xu, Xin and Tao, Liankuan and Yu, Haiyang and Ye, Hongbin and Qiao, Shuofei and Xie, Xin and Chen, Xiang and Li, Zhoubo and Li, Lei and Liang, Xiaozhuan and others},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2201.03335},\n  year={2022}\n}\n```\n\n## Disclaimers\n\n**The contents of this project are for technical research purposes only and are not intended as a basis for any conclusive findings.

是一个开源的知识图谱抽取与构建工具，支持低资源、长篇章、多模态的知识抽取工具，可以基于PyTorch实现命名实体识别、关系抽取和属性抽取功能。同时为初学者提供了详尽的[文档](https://zjunlp.github.io/DeepKE/)，[Google Colab教程](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1vS8YJhJltzw3hpJczPt24O0Azcs3ZpRi?usp=sharing)，[在线演示](http://deepke.zjukg.cn/)和[幻灯片](https://github.com/zjunlp/DeepKE/blob/main/docs/slides/Slides-DeepKE-cn.pdf)。\n\n众所周知，数据对模型训练非常重要。为方便用户使用本工具，DeepKE提供了详细的实体识别、关系抽取数据标注说明，以方便用户通过人工或自动方式得到训练数据，标注好的数据可以直接供DeepKE进行模型训练。\n\n## 人工数据标注\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/doccano/doccano/master/docs/images/logo/doccano.png\">\n</div>\n\n`doccano`是一个开源的人工数据标注工具。它为**文本分类**、**序列标记**和**序列到序列**提供标注功能。因此您可以为情感分析、命名实体识别、文本摘要等任务创建标记数据。只需创建一个项目并上传数据并开始标记，您可以在数小时内构建可供`DeepKE`训练的数据集。下面会介绍使用`doccano`为实体识别和关系抽取标注数据。\n\ndoccano的安装与配置可参考 [Github(doccano)](https://github.com/doccano/doccano)\n\n安装并启动server后，在浏览器中访问`http://0.0.0.0:8000`，并点击**登陆**。\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"pics/doccano_home_cn.png\">\n</div>\n\n### 实体识别\n\n#### 创建项目\n\n- 创建项目。点击左上角的`创建`，跳转至以下界面。\n\n    - 选择序列标注（Sequence Labeling）任务。\n    - 填写项目名称（Project name）、描述（Description）等必要信息。\n    - **按需勾选**允许实体重叠（Allow overlapping entity）、使用关系标注（Use relation labeling）等可配置属性。\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"pics/doccano_create_project_cn.png\">\n</div>\n\n * 在创建完成后，会自动跳转到项目的主页。\n\n#### 添加语料库\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"pics/doccano_data_format_cn.png\">\n</div>\n\n\n- `doccano`支持多种格式的文本，它们的区别如下：\n    - `Textfile`：上传的文件为`txt`格式，打标时一整个`txt`文件显示为一页内容；\n    - `Textline`：上传的文件为`txt`格式，打标时`txt`文件的一行文字显示为一页内容；\n    - `JSONL`：`JSON Lines`的简写，每行是一个有效的`JSON`值；\n    - `CoNLL`： `CoNLL`格式的文件，每行均带有一系列制表符分隔的单词；\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"pics/doccano_dataset_cn.png\">\n</div>\n\n* 再点击**数据集**的标签，就可以看到一条一条的文本已经被添加到项目中了，之后我们将对这些文本进行打标。\n\n#### 数据标注\n\n- 添加任务标签\n    - 抽取式任务包含`Span`与`Relation`两种标签类型，此处采用`Span`类型，`Span`指原文本中的目标信息片段，即实体识别中某个类型的实体。\n    - 填入标签的名字。在实体识别中，可以写`PER`、`LOC`、`ORG`等。\n    - 添加该标签对应的快捷键（例如给`PER`标签设置为快捷键`p`），并定义标签颜色。\n\n    <div align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"pics/doccano_create_label_cn.png\">\n    </div>\n\n    - 之后以同样的方法添加其他所需要的标签即可。\n\n- 任务标注\n    - 标注数据，点击每条数据最右边的`Annotate`按钮开始标注。\n    - 示例中定义了人物、地点两种`Span`类型标签。\n\n    <div align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"pics/doccano_annotate_cn.png\">\n    </div>\n\n#### 导出训练数据\n\n- 在数据集一栏点击`操作`、`导出数据集`导出已标注的数据。\n- 标注数据保存在同一个文本文件中，每条样例占一行且存储为`jsonl`格式，其包含以下字段\n    - `id`: 样本在数据集中的唯一标识`ID`。\n    - `text`: 原始文本数据。\n    - `entities`: 数据中包含的`Span`标签，每个`Span`标签包含四个字段：\n        - `id`: `Span`在数据集中的唯一标识ID。\n        - `start_offset`: `Span`的起始位置。\n        - `end_offset`: `Span`结束位置的下一个位置。\n        - `label`: `Span`的类型。\n\n- 导出数据示例\n\n```json\n{\n    \"id\":8,\n    \"text\":\"曾经去过深圳、珠海的俭汤青年农民回乡后意味深长地说，从南往北走，越走越保守。\",\n    \"entities\":[\n        {\n            \"id\":9,\n            \"label\":\"LOC\",\n            \"start_offset\":4,\n            \"end_offset\":6\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\":10,\n            \"label\":\"LOC\",\n            \"start_offset\":7,\n            \"end_offset\":9\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\":11,\n            \"label\":\"PER\",\n            \"start_offset\":12,\n            \"end_offset\":16\n        }\n    ],\n    \"relations\":[\n\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n- `DeepKE`中实体识别任务输入数据格式为`txt`文件，每行包括单词、分隔符、标签（可参考`CoNLL`数据格式）。将导出后的数据预处理成`DeepKE`可输入的格式即可进行训练，具体流程请进入详细的README中。\n    - [常规全监督STANDARD](https://github.com/zjunlp/DeepKE/tree/main/example/ner/standard)\n\n### 关系抽取\n\n- [创建项目](#创建项目)\n    - 与实体识别操作一致，参考以上即可。\n- [添加语料库](#添加语料库)\n    - 与实体识别操作一致，参考以上即可。\n    - **输入文本中，文本格式`{文本}*{头实体}*{尾实体}*{头实体类型}*{尾实体类型}`，其中头和尾实体类型可为空。**\n\n#### 数据标注\n\n- 添加任务标签\n    - 抽取式任务包含`Span`与`Relation`两种标签类型，此处采用`Relation`类型，`Relation`指原文本中`Span`之间的关系，即关系抽取中两个实体间的关系。\n    - 填入关系类型的名字。在关系抽取中，可以写`毕业`、`因果`等。\n    - 添加该关系类型对应的快捷键（例如给`毕业`标签设置为快捷键`b`），并定义标签颜色。\n\n    <div align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"pics/doccano_create_label_re_cn.png\">\n    </div>\n\n    - 之后以同样的方法添加其他所需要的标签即可。\n\n- 任务标注\n    - 标注数据，点击每条数据最右边的`Annotate`按钮开始标注。\n    - 首先点击待标注的关系标签，接着依次点击相应的头尾实体可完成关系标注。\n    - 示例中定义了`PER`和`LOC`两种`Span`类型标签，之后标注实体间的关系标签`毕业`。`Relation`标签由`Subject`对应实体指向`Object`对应实体。\n\n    <div align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"pics/doccano_annotate_re_cn.png\">\n    </div>\n\n#### 导出训练数据\n\n- 在数据集一栏点击`操作`、`导出数据集`导出已标注的数据。\n- 标注数据保存在同一个文本文件中，每条样例占一行且存储为`jsonl`格式，其包含以下字段\n    - `id`: 样本在数据集中的唯一标识`ID`。\n    - `text`: 原始文本数据。\n    - `entities`: 数据中包含的`Span`标签，每个`Span`标签包含四个字段：\n        - `id`: `Span`在数据集中的唯一标识ID。\n        - `start_offset`: `Span`的起始位置。\n        - `end_offset`: `Span`结束位置的下一个位置。\n        - `label`: `Span`的类型。\n    - `relations`: 数据中包含的`Relation`标签，每个`Relation`标签包含四个字段：\n        - `id`: (`Span1`, `Relation`, `Span2`)三元组在数据集中的唯一标识`ID`，不同样本中的相同三元组对应同一个`ID`。\n        - `from_id`: `Span1`对应的标识`ID`。\n        - `to_id`: `Span2`对应的标识`ID`。\n        - `type`: `Relation`类型。\n\n- 导出数据示例\n\n```json\n{\n    \"id\":12,\n    \"text\":\"张廷智， 毕业于大连军医学院，从事中医治疗中晚期肿瘤临床工作30余年*张延智*大连军医学院*人物*学校\",\n    \"entities\":[\n        {\n            \"id\":18,\n            \"label\":\"PER\",\n            \"start_offset\":0,\n            \"end_offset\":3\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\":19,\n            \"label\":\"ORG\",\n            \"start_offset\":8,\n            \"end_offset\":14\n        }\n    ],\n    \"relations\":[\n        {\n            \"id\":1,\n            \"from_id\":18,\n            \"to_id\":19,\n            \"type\":\"毕业\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n## 自动数据标注\n\n### 实体识别\n\n为了用户更好的使用`DeepKE`完成实体识别任务，我们提供一个简单易用的**基于词典匹配**的实体识别**自动标注工具**。\n\n#### 词典\n- 词典格式如下所示：\n    <h3 align=\"left\">\n        <img src=\"https://github.com/zjunlp/DeepKE/blob/main/example/ner/prepare-data/pics/vocab_dict.png?raw=true\", width=375>\n    </h3>\n- 预提供了两个实体词典（中英文各一个），使用实体词典+jieba词性标注对样本进行自动标注。\n\n    - 中文示例词典中, 我们采用[(人民日报)数据集](https://github.com/OYE93/Chinese-NLP-Corpus/tree/master/NER/People's%20Daily). 它是NER相关的数据集，包含人员 (PER)、位置 (LOC) 和组织 (ORG) 相关的命名实体识别。\n\n    - 英文示例词典中，我们采用Conll数据集。它包含人员 (PER)、位置 (LOC) 和其他 (MISC) 相关的命名实体识别。你可通过如下命令获得Conll数据集\n\n    ```shell\n    wget 120.27.214.45/Data/ner/few_shot/data.tar.gz\n    ```\n\n    - 预提供词典Google Drive下载链接： \n        - [中文(vocab_dict_cn), 英文(vocab_dict_en)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PGANizeTsvEQFYTL8O1jrDLZwk_MPqO0?usp=sharing)\n    - 百度网盘下载链接： \n        - [中文(vocab_dict_cn), 英文(vocab_dict_en)](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1a07W42ZByeZ00MZp5pZgxg) \n        - 提取码(x7ba)\n\n- **若需要构建领域自建词典，请参照预提供词典格式(csv)**\n\n    | 实体 | 词性 |\n    |  --------  | ------  |\n    |  杭州  | LOC  |\n    |  ...  | ...  |\n\n#### 源文件\n\n- **输入的词典**格式为`csv`（包含两列，分别是实体以及对应的标签）。\n\n- **待自动打标的数据**（txt格式按行分隔，如下图所示）应放在`source_data`路径下，脚本会遍历此文件夹下的所有txt格式的文件，逐行进行自动打标。具体示例如下：\n    <h3 align=\"left\">\n        <img src=\"https://github.com/zjunlp/DeepKE/blob/main/example/ner/prepare-data/pics/input_data_format.png?raw=true\", width=700>\n    </h3>\n\n\n#### 输出文件\n\n- 输出文件包含三个：`example_train_cn.txt`, `example_dev_cn.txt`, `example_test_cn.txt`，分别对应训练集、验证集和测试集。我们自动将源文件数据划分为三份，比例为`0.8:0.1:0.1`。输出文件的格式如下：\n    <h3 align=\"left\">\n        <img src=\"https://github.com/zjunlp/DeepKE/blob/main/example/ner/prepare-data/pics/output_data_format.png?raw=true\", width=375>\n    </h3>\n\n#### 环境\n运行环境:  \n- jieba = 0.42.1\n\n#### 参数解释\n\n- `language`: 可选cn(中文)或en(英文)\n- `source_dir`: 语料库路径（遍历此文件夹下的所有txt格式的文件，逐行进行自动打标，默认为`source_data`）\n- `dict_dir`: 实体词典路径（默认为`vocab_dict.csv`）\n- `test_rate, dev_rate, test_rate`: 训练集、验证集、测试集占比（请确保总和为`1`，默认`0.8:0.1:0.1`）\n\n#### 运行\n\n- **中文**\n```bash\npython prepare_weaksupervised_data.py --language cn --dict_dir vocab_dict_cn.csv\n```\n\n- **英文**\n```bash\npython prepare_weaksupervised_data.py --language en --dict_dir vocab_dict_en.csv\n```\n\n\n### 关系抽取\n\n为了用户更好的使用`DeepKE`完成关系抽取任务，我们提供一个简单易用的基于远程监督的关系标注工具。\n\n#### 源文件\n\n用户提供的源文件需要为`.json`形式，并且每条数据只包含一个实体对，分别为头实体和尾实体。数据中必须至少包含以下四个字段：sentence(句子), head(头实体), tail(尾实体), head_offset(头实体在句子中的偏移位置), tail_offset(尾实体在句子中的偏移位置)。具体的json字典形式如下：\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"如何演好自己的角色，请读《演员自我修养》《喜剧之王》周星驰崛起于穷困潦倒之中的独门秘笈\",\n    \"head\": \"周星驰\",\n    \"tail\": \"喜剧之王\",\n    \"head_offset\": \"26\",\n    \"tail_offset\": \"21\",\n    //...\n\t},\n  //...\n]\n```\n\n#### 三元组文件\n\n源文件中的实体对将会与三元组文件中的三元组进行字符串全匹配。如果匹配成功实体对将会被标记为三元组的关系标签，如果没有匹配项则被标记为`None`。\n\n我们分解提供了一个[英文](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HHkm3RBI3okiu8jGs-Wn0vP_-0hz7pb2?usp=sharing)和一个[中文](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YpaMpivodG39p53MM9sMpB41q4EoiQhH/view?usp=sharing)三元组文件。英文三元组来自`NYT`数据集，包含如下关系类型：\n\n```python\n\"/business/company/place_founded\",\n\"/people/person/place_lived\",\n\"/location/country/administrative_divisions\",\n\"/business/company/major_shareholders\",\n\"/sports/sports_team_location/teams\",\n\"/people/person/religion\",\n\"/people/person/place_of_birth\",\n\"/people/person/nationality\",\n\"/location/country/capital\",\n\"/business/company/advisors\",\n\"/people/deceased_person/place_of_death\",\n\"/business/company/founders\",\n\"/location/location/contains\",\n\"/people/person/ethnicity\",\n\"/business/company_shareholder/major_shareholder_of\",\n\"/people/ethnicity/geographic_distribution\",\n\"/people/person/profession\",\n\"/business/person/company\",\n\"/people/person/children\",\n\"/location/administrative_division/country\",\n\"/people/ethnicity/people\",\n\"/sports/sports_team/location\",\n\"/location/neighborhood/neighborhood_of\",\n\"/business/company/industry\"\n```\n\n中文三元组来自GitHub[链接](https://github.com/DannyLee1991/ExtractTriples)，包含如下关系类型：\n\n```json\n{\"object_type\":

`source_file`: 需要标记的源文件\n- `triple_file`: 三元组文件\n- `test_rate, dev_rate, test_rate`:  训练集、验证集和测试集的划分比例，需要保证比例之和为1，默认为0.8:0.1:0.1。\n\n#### 运行\n\n```bash\npython ds_label_data.py --language en --source_file source_data.json --triple_file triple_file.csv\n```\n\n\n\n## FAQ\n\n- **Q: 我需要标注多少数据**\n    - A: 标注是一个耗费人力与时间的过程，成本非常大。从理想角度看标注的数据数量越多，训练得到的模型效果也会越好。但是实际情况往往并不允许。一方面，需要结合实际的资源与时间；另一方面，要考虑数据量增加对模型效果提升带来的影响。在实体识别、关系抽取中通常需要`10K`左右的数据量。\n\n\n- **Q: 请问有标注好的数据提供吗**\n    - A: 在实体识别中，预提供了两个实体词典（中英文各一个），能够对样本进行自动标注。\n\n- **Q: 自动标注数据训出来的模型效果不行**\n    - A: 模型的效果差可能有以下几个原因：\n        - 自动标注、人工标注的数据含有较多的噪声，\n        - 数据量较小：参数量很多的大模型在小数据集上过拟合\n    - solution：\n        - 可以考虑检查数据的质量\n        - 利用**半监督**训练或者`Self-Traning`等策略\n        - 使用数据增强增大数据量\n\n## 引用\n\n如果本项目中的资源或技术对你的研究工作有所帮助，欢迎在论文中引用下述论文。\n\n```\n@article{zhang2022deepke,\n  title={DeepKE: A Deep Learning Based
