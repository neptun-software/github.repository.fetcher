Like most of the frameworks of the bigger Data Science field, TensorFlow is married with Python and Scikit-Learn is written in Python.  \n\nFirst, let's [install Python 3](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) on your machine!\n\nWe are ready to start our journey!\n\nIf you don't know the basics of Python, just start from [here](https://pythonprogramming.net/introduction-learn-python-3-tutorials/).\\\nElse if you know the syntax and you want to have a more solid Python background (recommended) take this Intermediate Python Course from [here](https://pythonprogramming.net/introduction-intermediate-python-tutorial/).\\\nIf you are looking for tons of exercises to get your hands dirty and get experience with Python, check [here](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/) and [here](https://www.practicepython.org/).\n\nOnce you're familiar with Python, take a look at [Numpy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/user/whatisnumpy.html), an important module for math operations, that allows you to import in Python the [Tensor](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/05/wtf-tensor.html) data type, which is the most used in ML (especially when dealing with Neural Nets).\n[It's not a matrix!](https://medium.com/@quantumsteinke/whats-the-difference-between-a-matrix-and-a-tensor-4505fbdc576c)\nThis is an awesome [Numpy Tutorial](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/).\n\nI also recommend you to install [Pycharm Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows), a complete IDE for Python development, and [set a new Python virtual environment](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-virtual-environment.html) for our experiments.\n\n### Jupyter Notebook\nDirectly from [here](https://jupyter.org/): \"The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.\"\nWorking with data means -> a lot of expriments. And to document experiments, and organize them in a valuable way to get insights, you definitely need to use Jupyter Notebook during your journey. [Why](http://blendedlearning.blogs.brynmawr.edu/what-are-jupyter-notebooks-why-would-i-want-to-use-them/)?\n\n\n### The math you need\nWho tells that the math behind Machine Learning is hard... it's not so wrong! But you have to consider that every time you're going to use it, it will be handled by the machine for you! So, the important is to grasp the main math concepts and recognize limits and applications of those. No one is going to ask you to calculate a gradient by hand! So, even if you are not familiar with these concepts, check them, because they are the reason behind everything.\n\nWith these three resources, you'll get out the most of what you really need to understand things deeply.\n\nA top course about linear algebra is [here](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/).\\\nIntegrate with basic probabilities and statistic concepts [here](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-probability-0).\\\nThe most of the remaining math you need [here](https://explained.ai/matrix-calculus/index.html#sec4.5).\n\n\n### The machine learning Landscape\nDirectly from the book cited earlier, this is the most concise and illuminating overview of **what is** and **when you need** machine learning. Let's stop use buzzwords!\nCheck it [here](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781491962282/ch01.html).\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Machine Learning\n\n### Introduction\n\nSed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam, eaque ipsa quae ab illo inventore veritatis et quasi architecto beatae vitae dicta sunt explicabo.

So n the same folder run:\n\n```\n python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n```\n\n[Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) one of the most complete, mature and well-documented library for Machine Learning tasks. It comes out-of-the-box with powerful and advanced models and offers facility functions for the data science process.\nWe'll learn and use other modules along the road, for a quick usage just look at their official documentation.\n\n\n### End-to-End Machine Learning project\nFor a first taste, i suggest you to go through this Kaggle notebook, which is the most classic example of ML task. The goal is trying to predict if a Titanic passenger would have been most likely to survive or not. Many things will be unclear for now, but don't worry, they will be all explained comprehensively later. Is nice to get the picture of the \"applied\" project, going through the classical steps of the applied Machine Learning (problem framing, data exploration, question formulation...).\n\nThe notebook is on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), the go-to platform for ML and general Data Science projects, which provides a lot of free datasets and offers interesting challenges and ML model experiments.\n\n[This](https://www.kaggle.com/startupsci/titanic-data-science-solutions) is the notebook: Read it, trying to get the big picture of the process, because some details, functions and code will be clearer later.\n\n### Linear Regression\nThis is the simplest form of Machine Learning, and the starting point for everyone interested in predicting outcomes from a dataset.\nCheck [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W46UTQ_JDPk&list=PLoR5VjrKytrCv-Vxnhp5UyS1UjZsXP0Kj&index=2) the theoretical lesson from Andrew NG and then go through these examples, from the simplest to the most complete.\n[This](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ml-normal-equation-in-linear-regression/) is the math behind Linear Regression.\n- [Example 1](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/linear_model/plot_ols.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-linear-model-plot-ols-py)\n- [Example 2](https://bigdata-madesimple.com/how-to-run-linear-regression-in-python-scikit-learn/)\n- [Example 3](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linear-regression-python-implementation/)\n\n### Classification\nClassification is one of the most important ML tasks, and it consists of predicting **an outcome given an input**, classifying it among differente possibilities. For example, given handwritten numbers, guess what the number is, with the lowest error rate possible.\nThe simplest case is binary classification (Yes or No, Survived or Not Survived), have a look [here](https://machinelearningmastery.com/make-predictions-scikit-learn/).\nCheck [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/building-a-logistic-regression-in-python-301d27367c24) a brief explanation of the theory of logistic regression algorithm for classification, and check [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCJdg7YBbAQ) for a deeper comprehension (using the Titanic dataset).\nYou can use a lot of different ML models to classify things, even neural networks! For now, just take a look [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/classification/plot_classifier_comparison.html), where you see an example of comparison among different models accuracy and recall.\n[Here](https://medium.com/thalus-ai/performance-metrics-for-classification-problems-in-machine-learning-part-i-b085d432082b) you have an article about the metrics used to **evaluate** your classifiers.\n\n### Training models\nHere i grouped some of the techniques used in ML tasks to train the models.\nIn this Google Crash Course you find:\n- [Gradient Descent](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/reducing-loss/gradient-descent)\n- [Learning Rate](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/reducing-loss/learning-rate)\n- [SGD](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/reducing-loss/stochastic-gradient-descent)\n- [Regularization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q81RR3yKn30)\n\n### Support Vector Machines\nThis is another classical algorithm to create ML models.\n[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PwhiWxHK8o) you have the explanation of the theory, and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8D5YL6cOSE) a more pratical approach. Check both.\n[Here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html) is a very good explanation + practice application in Scikit-Learn.\n\n### Decision Trees\nDecision Trees are one of the most simple but effective idea behind predicting outcomes, and they're used in many ways (i.e. Random Forest). Check [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKD5gxPPeY0&list=PLBv09BD7ez_4temBw7vLA19p3tdQH6FYO) and go through the playlist to get a theoretical overview of Decision Trees (ID3).\n[Here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html) you have the pratical application of ID3.\nHere you have a some end-to-end examples, with  Scikit-Learn:\n- [Example 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YcMzsFvfxU)\n- [Example 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmajweUFKvM)\n- [Example 3](http://dataaspirant.com/2017/02/01/decision-tree-algorithm-python-with-scikit-learn/)\n\n### Ensemble Learning and Random Forest\nThe idea of Ensemble Learning is to leverage all the different features, pro and cons of several ML models to obtain a group of \"voters\" that, for each prediction, gives you the most likely outcome, voted by different classifiers (SVM, ID3, maybe Logistic Regression).\n[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VmKYwX_U7s) you find the basics of the ensemble learning approach, and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kYujfDgmNk) you find the most classic of them, the Random Forest. Altough the idea is simple, this ensemble model came up really effective tackling even some \"hard\" classification problems, or with a lot of data.  \n\n[Here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html) you get a complete overview of the best practices for ensemble learning, and [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/random-forest-in-python-24d0893d51c0) you find an example of Random Forest with Scikit-Learn. Both link come with a bunch of useful techniques touse in practice.\n\n### Wrapping up and looking forward\nNow, if you followed all the steps and explored all the resources i posted, you're likely to be mode confident with Machine Learning and have a general idea of the things. Of course you need to explore and learn more, because this field is changing and enhancing techniques and approaches day-by-day! All the algorithm we've seen are widely used in the Data Science and Analytics field, but there are some complex tasks where they fail or give really poor performances. Now we are ready to fall down in the **deep** rabbit hole, trying to understand how Neural Network and in general Deep Learning can help tackling big problem with millions of parameters and variables.\n[Why use Deep Learning over classical ML algorithms?](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-deep-learning-is-needed-over-traditional-machine-learning-1b6a99177063)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Deep Learning\nIn this section we'll follow a track that will bring us to zero knowledge of neural network to fully understand them, thanks to the Stanford University Deep Learning course and some tutorials i've searched over the internet. Some of them come from Google, other from Stanford or Cambridge university, and you will learn to leverage neural networks (ANN, CNN, RNN) for several kind of ML tasks.\nThese are [some use cases](https://www.digitaldoughnut.com/articles/2017/march/top-5-use-cases-of-tensorflow) of using TensorFlow for ML tasks.\n\nThe theory and the applications of the Neural Networks are not too easy to get at a first look. Because of that, you'll need to pass again through tutorials and videos, to ensure a fully comprehension of the coming topics. Because of that, I spent a decent amount of time trying to understand (reading paths like this, articles, offical forums, related subreddits) which was **the most effective way** to deeply learn the concepts, formulas, tradeoffs...\nI came up with this approach, but you can tweak it as you prefer, because every brain is different.\n\n> After taking the TensorFlow section\n> 3 phases iterative cycle:\n\n>- 1 Get an idea of the main concepts through **an entire pass** of this [Stanford course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT1JzLTH4G4&list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv), don't care too much on math explanations, focus on the **what and why**\n\n>- 2 Deeply explore **one topic at time**, with theory + tutorials + examples (e.g. RNN theory + RNN tutorials + RNN examples)\n>with the links and resources of the topic section of the guide.\n\n>- 3 After iterating the 2 phase for each topic, walk again through the entire Stanford course. This time you can fully understand all  the formulas, connecting them and catching also the \"math flow\" of the course.\n\nThis iterative process (1-2-2-2-2.....-3) can be repeated may times as you want, and will probably construct in your mind a nice **general schema** of the things. In each complete iteration you can drop one or more topics, and focus on the ones that are more interesting to you or not so clear.\n\nIn each section i've put content for the first time you arrive there (during the first complete iteration), and some content for next time you arrive there (after the 3 phase).\n\nThe structure follows the track proposed by the Stanford awesome course. You find the slides [here](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/slides/2018/).\n\n[This](http://introtodeeplearning.com/) is an alternative course from MIT, more or less the same contents. It's worth watching it to compare and have a differente point of view on the things, besides listening 2X the best professors of the world exploring each topic.  \n\nThis is the [**Book**](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) I refer to in each section.\n\n### What is TensorFlow\nCreated by the [Google Brain](https://ai.google/research/teams/brain) team, [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is an open source library for numerical computation and large-scale machine learning. TensorFlow bundles together a slew of machine learning and deep learning (aka neural networking) models and algorithms and makes them useful by way of a common metaphor. It uses Python to provide a convenient front-end API for building applications with the framework, while executing those applications in high-performance C++.\nTensorFlow is the de-facto standard for the major industry-sized company that need to implement Machine Learning algorithms. Is built for scaling, with really cool features to parallelize training over multiple GPU's or devices.\n\n### What is PyTorch\nPyTorch is an open source machine learning library based on the Torch library, used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing, primarily developed by Facebook's AI Research lab (FAIR). It is free and open-source software released under the Modified BSD license.\nPyTorch is an open source machine learning library based on the Torch library, used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing, primarily developed by Facebook's AI Research lab (FAIR).

Although the Python interface is more polished and the primary focus of development, PyTorch also has a C++ interface.\n\nA number of pieces of Deep Learning software are built on top of PyTorch, including Tesla Autopilot, Uber's Pyro etc.\n\nPyTorch provides two high-level features: Tensor computing (like NumPy) with strong acceleration via graphics processing units (GPU) **and** Deep neural networks built on a tape-based automatic differentiation system\n\n### Up and Running with TensorFlow\nAssuming you have [Python stored in the variable PATH](https://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-10/add-windows-path-environment-variable/), to install the Tensorflow library you just need to open a terminal inside you Python installation folder and run this command.\n\n```\npython pip install tensorflow\n```\n\nThe first read i recommend you is [this](https://jacobbuckman.com/post/tensorflow-the-confusing-parts-1/).\nThe second thing to do is to follow this [Introduction to TensorFlow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYYVSEHq-io) directly from the **awesome** [Google Education](https://ai.google/education/) page.\nAgain, some theoretical concepts might be unclear, but focus on how the TensorFlow library and process are conceived.\n[This](https://medium.com/@camrongodbout/tensorflow-in-a-nutshell-part-one-basics-3f4403709c9d) is a good resume of the latter.\n[Another beginner tutorial from google](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets/#0).\n[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5c-vg4rjBw&t=246s) is about the TensorFlow 2.0 update.\n\nNow you're most likely familiar with **TensorFlow as a tool**, and it's time to understand **how to use** it to build large scale Neural Networks.\n\n### ANN - Artificial Neural Networks\n_First look (in order):_\n- [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2tKoymKIuE).\n- [This is your bible](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html), understand it totally.\n- [This is a gem](https://playground.tensorflow.org/#activation=tanh&batchSize=10&dataset=circle&regDataset=reg-plane&learningRate=0.03&regularizationRate=0&noise=0&networkShape=4,2&seed=0.85356&showTestData=false&discretize=false&percTrainData=50&x=true&y=true&xTimesY=false&xSquared=false&ySquared=false&cosX=false&sinX=false&cosY=false&sinY=false&collectStats=false&problem=classification&initZero=false&hideText=false) and read [this](https://www.guru99.com/artificial-neural-network-tutorial.html) from the authors.\n- [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o64FV-ez6Gw&t=540s) is a really fast-talking guy implementing a Neural Network library from scratch, super useful to understand how is implemented the core of NN in Python. You can imagine that each existing framework is just an enormous expansione of this concept-library.\n- [This](https://mattmazur.com/2015/03/17/a-step-by-step-backpropagation-example/) is a
