Purpose\n\nA primary goal of Tensortrade is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).\n\nThis code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.\n\nWe invite all those who participate in Tensortrade to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.\n2. Open [Source/Culture/Tech] Citizenship\n\nA supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open [source/culture/tech] citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.\n\nCommunities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.\n\nIf you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.\n3. Expected Behavior\n\nThe following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:\n\n    Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.\n    Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.\n    Attempt collaboration before conflict.\n    Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.\n    Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.\n    Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.\n\n4. Unacceptable Behavior\n\nThe following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:\n\n    Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.\n    Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.\n    Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.\n    Posting or threatening to post other people's personally identifying information (\"doxing\").\n    Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.\n    Inappropriate photography or recording.\n    Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone's consent before touching them.\n    Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.\n    Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).\n    Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.\n    Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.\n\n5. Weapons Policy\n\nNo weapons will be allowed at Tensortrade events, community spaces, or in other spaces covered by the scope of this Code of Conduct. Weapons include but are not limited to guns, explosives (including fireworks), and large knives such as those used for hunting or display, as well as any other item used for the purpose of causing injury or harm to others. Anyone seen in possession of one of these items will be asked to leave immediately, and will only be allowed to return without the weapon. Community members are further expected to comply with all state and local laws on this matter.\n6. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior\n\nUnacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.\n\nAnyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.\n\nIf a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).\n7. Reporting Guidelines\n\nIf you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible. adamjking3@gmail.com.\n\nLink to reporting guidelines\n\nAdditionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.\n8. Addressing Grievances\n\nIf you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify Governing body with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies. Link to policy\n\nNote\n9. Scope\n\nWe expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues--online and in-person--as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.\n\nThis code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.\n10.

          "content": "# On Github Issues and Pull Requests\n\nFound a bug? Have a new feature to suggest? Want to contribute changes to the codebase? Make sure to read this first.\n\n## Bug reporting\n\nYour code doesn't work, and you have determined that the issue lies with TensorTrade? Follow these steps to report a bug.\n\n1. Your bug may already be fixed. Make sure to update to the current TensorTrade master branch, as well as the latest TensorFlow master branch.\n\n2. Search for similar issues. Make sure to delete `is:open` on the issue search to find solved tickets as well. It's possible somebody has encountered this bug already. Also remember to check out TensorTrade's [FAQ](http://tensortrader.io/faq/). Still having a problem? Open an issue on Github to let us know.\n\n3. Make sure you provide us with useful information about your configuration: what OS are you using? What Tensorflow version are you using? Are you running on GPU? If so, what is your version of Cuda, of cuDNN? What is your GPU?\n\n4. Provide us with a script to reproduce the issue. This script should be runnable as-is and should not require external data download (use randomly generated data if you need to run a model on some test data). We recommend that you use Github Gists to post your code. Any issue that cannot be reproduced is likely to be closed.\n\n5. If possible, take a stab at fixing the bug yourself --if you can!\n\nThe more information you provide, the easier it is for us to validate that there is a bug and the faster we'll be able to take action. If you want your issue to be resolved quickly, following the steps above is crucial.\n\n---\n\n## Requesting a Feature\n\nYou can also use Github issues to request features you would like to see in TensorTrade, or changes in the TensorTrade API.\n\n1. Provide a clear and detailed explanation of the feature you want and why it's important to add. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just targeting a minority of users, consider writing an add-on library for TensorTrade. It is crucial for TensorTrade to avoid bloating the API and codebase.\n\n2. Provide code snippets demonstrating the API you have in mind and illustrating the use cases of your feature. Of course, you don't need to write any real code at this point!\n\n3. After discussing the feature you may choose to attempt a Pull Request. If you're at all able, start writing some code. We always have more work to do than time to do it. If you can write some code then that will speed the process along.\n\n---\n\n## Requests for Contributions\n\n[This is the board](https://github.com/notadamking/tensortrader/projects/1) where we list current outstanding issues and features to be added. If you want to start contributing to TensorTrade, this is the place to start.\n\n---\n\n## Pull Requests\n\nPlease note that PRs that are primarily about **code style** (as opposed to fixing bugs, improving docs, or adding new functionality) will likely be rejected.\n\nHere's a quick guide to submitting your improvements:\n\n1. If your PR introduces a change in functionality, make sure you start by writing a design doc and opening a Github issue to discuss whether the change should be made, and how to handle it. This will save you from having your PR closed down the road! Of course, if your PR is a simple bug fix, you don't need to do that.\n\n2) Write the code (or get others to write it). This is the hard part!\n\n3) Make sure any new function or class you introduce has proper docstrings. Make sure any code you touch still has up-to-date docstrings and documentation. **Docstring style should be respected.** In particular, they should be formatted in MarkDown, and there should be sections for `Arguments`, `Returns`, `Raises` (if applicable). Look at other docstrings in the codebase for examples.\n\n4) Write tests. Your code should have full unit test coverage. If you want to see your PR merged promptly, this is crucial. Use the _coverage_  module module to make sure that code coverage is increased on the component you are working on. PRs that decrease coverage may be rejected. \n\n5) Run our test suite locally. It's easy: from the TensorTrade folder, simply run: `py.test tests/`.\n\n   - You will need to install the test requirements as well: `pip install -e .[tests]`.\n\n6) Make sure all tests are passing.\n\n7) We use PEP8 syntax conventions, but we aren't dogmatic when it comes to line length. Make sure your lines stay reasonably sized, though. To make your life easier, we recommend running a PEP8 linter:\n\n   - Install PEP8 packages: `pip install pep8 pytest-pep8 autopep8`\n   - Run a standalone PEP8 check: `py.test --pep8 -m pep8`\n   - You can automatically fix some PEP8 error by running: `autopep8 -i --select <errors> <FILENAME>` for example: `autopep8 -i --select E128 tests/tensortrader/backend/test_backends.py`\n\n8) When committing, use appropriate, descriptive commit messages.\n\n9) Update the documentation. If introducing new functionality, make sure you include code snippets demonstrating the usage of your new feature.\n\n10) Submit your PR. If your changes have been approved in a previous discussion, and if you have complete (and passing) unit tests as well as proper docstrings/documentation, your PR is likely to be merged promptly.\n\n\n---\n\n## Adding new examples\n\nEven if you don't contribute to the TensorTrade source code, if you have an application of TensorTrade that is concise and powerful, please consider adding it to our collection of examples. [Existing examples](./examples) show idiomatic TensorTrade code: make sure to keep your own script in the same spirit.\n"

The framework focuses on being highly composable and extensible, to allow the system to scale from simple trading strategies on a single CPU, to complex investment strategies run on a distribution of HPC machines.\r\n\r\nUnder the hood, the framework uses many of the APIs from existing machine learning libraries to maintain high quality data pipelines and learning models. One of the main goals of TensorTrade is to enable fast experimentation with algorithmic trading strategies, by leveraging the existing tools and pipelines provided by `numpy`, `pandas`, `gym`, `keras`, and `tensorflow`.\r\n\r\nEvery piece of the framework is split up into re-usable components, allowing you to take advantage of the general use components built by the community, while keeping your proprietary features private. The aim is to simplify the process of testing and deploying robust trading agents using deep reinforcement learning, to allow you and I to focus on creating profitable strategies.\r\n\r\n_The goal of this framework is to enable fast experimentation, while maintaining production-quality data pipelines._\r\n\r\nRead [the documentation](https://www.tensortrade.org/en/latest/).\r\n\r\n## Guiding principles\r\n\r\n_Inspired by [Keras' guiding principles](https://github.com/keras-team/keras)._\r\n\r\n- **User friendliness.** TensorTrade is an API designed for human beings, not machines. It puts user experience front and center. TensorTrade follows best practices for reducing cognitive load: it offers consistent & simple APIs, it minimizes the number of user actions required for common use cases, and it provides clear and actionable feedback upon user error.\r\n\r\n- **Modularity.** A trading environment is a conglomeration of fully configurable modules that can be plugged together with as few restrictions as possible. In particular, exchanges, feature pipelines, action schemes, reward schemes, trading agents, and performance reports are all standalone modules that you can combine to create new trading environments.\r\n\r\n- **Easy extensibility.** New modules are simple to add (as new classes and functions), and existing modules provide ample examples. To be able to easily create new modules allows for total expressiveness, making TensorTrade suitable for advanced research and production use.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nYou can get started testing on Google Colab or your local machine, by viewing our [many examples](https://github.com/tensortrade-org/tensortrade/tree/master/examples)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nTensorTrade requires Python >= 3.11.9 for all functionality to work as expected.\r\nYou can install TensorTrade both as a pre-packaged solution by running the default setup command.\r\n```bash\r\npip install tensortrade\r\n```\r\nYou can then alternatively install TensorTrade directly from the master code repository, pulling directly from the latest commits. This will give you the latest features\\fixes, but it is highly untested code, so proceed at your own risk.\r\n```bash\r\npip install git+https://github.com/tensortrade-org/tensortrade.git\r\n```\r\nAlternatively you can clone\\download the repository in your local environment an manually install the requirements, either the \"base\" ones, or the ones that also include requirements to run the examples in the documentation.\r\n```bash\r\npip install -r requirements.txt\r\npip install -r examples/requirements.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Docker\r\n\r\nTo run the commands below, ensure Docker is installed. Visit https://docs.docker.com/install/ for more information.\r\n\r\n### Run Jupyter Notebooks\r\n\r\nTo run a jupyter notebook in your browser, execute the following command and visit the `http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=...` link printed to the command line.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmake run-notebook\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Build Documentation\r\n\r\nTo build the HTML documentation, execute the following command.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmake run-docs\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Run Test Suite\r\n\r\nTo run the test suite, execute the following command.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmake run-tests\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Support\r\n\r\nYou can ask questions and join the development discussion:\r\n\r\n- On the [TensorTrade Discord server](https://discord.gg/ZZ7BGWh).\r\n- On the [TensorTrade Gitter](https://gitter.im/tensortrade-framework/community).\r\n\r\nYou can also post **bug reports and feature requests** in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/notadamking/tensortrade/issues). Make sure to read [our guidelines](https://github.com/notadamking/tensortrade/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) first.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\nContributions are encouraged and welcomed. This project is meant to grow as the community around it grows. Let me know on Discord in the #suggestions channel if there is anything that you would like to see in the future, or if there is anything you feel is missing.\r\n\r\n**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this _free_ series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)\r\n\r\n![https://github.com/notadamking/tensortrade/graphs/contributors](https://contributors-img.firebaseapp.com/image?repo=notadamking/tensortrade)\r\n"
