Le, Ruslan Salakhutdinov (*: equal contribution)\n\n>Preprint 2018\n\n## TensorFlow\n\n- The source code is in the `tf/` folder, supporting (1) single-node multi-gpu training, and (2) multi-host TPU training.\n- Besides the source code, we also provide pretrained \"TensorFlow\" models with state-of-the-art (SoTA) performances reported in the paper.\n- Please refer to `tf/README.md` for details.\n\n## PyTorch\n\n- The source code is in the `pytorch/` folder, supporting single-node multi-gpu training via the module `nn.DataParallel`.\n- Please refer to `pytorch/README.md` for details.\n\n## Results\n\nTransformer-XL achieves new state-of-the-art results on multiple language modeling benchmarks. Transformer-XL is also the first to break through the 1.0 barrier on char-level language modeling. Below is a summary.\n\nMethod | enwiki8 | text8 | One Billion Word | WT-103 | PTB (w/o finetuning)\n-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- \nPrevious Best | 1.06 | 1.13 | 23.7 | 20.5 | 55.5\nTransformer-XL | **0.99** | **1.08** | **21.8** | **18.3** | **54.5**\n\n\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nA large portion of the `getdata.sh` script comes from the [awd-lstm](https://github.com/salesforce/awd-lstm-lm/) repo.
