Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

XTuner provides many ready-to-use configs and we can view all configs by\n\n  ```shell\n  xtuner list-cfg\n  ```\n\n  Or, if the provided configs cannot meet the requirements, please copy the provided config to the specified directory and make specific modifications by\n\n  ```shell\n  xtuner copy-cfg ${CONFIG_NAME} ${SAVE_PATH}\n  vi ${SAVE_PATH}/${CONFIG_NAME}_copy.py\n  ```\n\n- **Step 1**, start fine-tuning.\n\n  ```shell\n  xtuner train ${CONFIG_NAME_OR_PATH}\n  ```\n\n  For example, we can start the QLoRA fine-tuning of InternLM2.5-Chat-7B with oasst1 dataset by\n\n  ```shell\n  # On a single GPU\n  xtuner train internlm2_5_chat_7b_qlora_oasst1_e3 --deepspeed deepspeed_zero2\n  # On multiple GPUs\n  (DIST) NPROC_PER_NODE=${GPU_NUM} xtuner train internlm2_5_chat_7b_qlora_oasst1_e3 --deepspeed deepspeed_zero2\n  (SLURM) srun ${SRUN_ARGS} xtuner train internlm2_5_chat_7b_qlora_oasst1_e3 --launcher slurm --deepspeed deepspeed_zero2\n  ```\n\n  - `--deepspeed` means using [DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed) 🚀 to optimize the training. XTuner comes with several integrated strategies including ZeRO-1, ZeRO-2, and ZeRO-3. If you wish to disable this feature, simply remove this argument.\n\n  - For more examples, please see [finetune.md](./docs/en/user_guides/finetune.md).\n\n- **Step 2**, convert the saved PTH model (if using DeepSpeed, it will be a directory) to Hugging Face model, by\n\n  ```shell\n  xtuner convert pth_to_hf ${CONFIG_NAME_OR_PATH} ${PTH} ${SAVE_PATH}\n  ```\n\n### Chat\n\nXTuner provides tools to chat with pretrained / fine-tuned LLMs.\n\n```shell\nxtuner chat ${NAME_OR_PATH_TO_LLM} --adapter {NAME_OR_PATH_TO_ADAPTER} [optional arguments]\n```\n\nFor example, we can start the chat with InternLM2.5-Chat-7B :\n\n```shell\nxtuner chat internlm/internlm2_5-chat-7b --prompt-template internlm2_chat\n```\n\nFor more examples, please see [chat.md](./docs/en/user_guides/chat.md).\n\n### Deployment\n\n- **Step 0**, merge the Hugging Face adapter to pretrained LLM, by\n\n  ```shell\n  xtuner convert merge \\\n      ${NAME_OR_PATH_TO_LLM} \\\n      ${NAME_OR_PATH_TO_ADAPTER} \\\n      ${SAVE_PATH} \\\n      --max-shard-size 2GB\n  ```\n\n- **Step 1**, deploy fine-tuned LLM with any other framework, such as [LMDeploy](https://github.com/InternLM/lmdeploy) 🚀.\n\n  ```shell\n  pip install lmdeploy\n  python -m lmdeploy.pytorch.chat ${NAME_OR_PATH_TO_LLM} \\\n      --max_new_tokens 256 \\\n      --temperture 0.8 \\\n      --top_p 0.95 \\\n      --seed 0\n  ```\n\n  🔥 Seeking efficient inference with less GPU memory? Try 4-bit quantization from [LMDeploy](https://github.com/InternLM/lmdeploy)! For more details, see [here](https://github.com/InternLM/lmdeploy/tree/main#quantization).\n\n### Evaluation\n\n- We recommend using [OpenCompass](https://github.com/InternLM/opencompass), a comprehensive and systematic LLM evaluation library, which currently supports 50+ datasets with about 300,000 questions.\n\n## 🤝 Contributing\n\nWe appreciate all contributions to XTuner.

快速上手\n\n### 安装\n\n- 推荐使用 conda 先构建一个 Python-3.10 的虚拟环境\n\n  ```bash\n  conda create --name xtuner-env python=3.10 -y\n  conda activate xtuner-env\n  ```\n\n- 通过 pip 安装 XTuner：\n\n  ```shell\n  pip install -U xtuner\n  ```\n\n  亦可集成 DeepSpeed 安装：\n\n  ```shell\n  pip install -U 'xtuner[deepspeed]'\n  ```\n\n- 从源码安装 XTuner：\n\n  ```shell\n  git clone https://github.com/InternLM/xtuner.git\n  cd xtuner\n  pip install -e '.[all]'\n  ```\n\n### 微调\n\nXTuner 支持微调大语言模型。数据集预处理指南请查阅[文档](./docs/zh_cn/user_guides/dataset_prepare.md)。\n\n- **步骤 0**，准备配置文件。XTuner 提供多个开箱即用的配置文件，用户可以通过下列命令查看：\n\n  ```shell\n  xtuner list-cfg\n  ```\n\n  或者，如果所提供的配置文件不能满足使用需求，请导出所提供的配置文件并进行相应更改：\n\n  ```shell\n  xtuner copy-cfg ${CONFIG_NAME} ${SAVE_PATH}\n  vi ${SAVE_PATH}/${CONFIG_NAME}_copy.py\n  ```\n\n- **步骤 1**，开始微调。\n\n  ```shell\n  xtuner train ${CONFIG_NAME_OR_PATH}\n  ```\n\n  例如，我们可以利用 QLoRA 算法在 oasst1 数据集上微调 InternLM2.5-Chat-7B：\n\n  ```shell\n  # 单卡\n  xtuner train internlm2_5_chat_7b_qlora_oasst1_e3 --deepspeed deepspeed_zero2\n  # 多卡\n  (DIST) NPROC_PER_NODE=${GPU_NUM} xtuner train internlm2_5_chat_7b_qlora_oasst1_e3 --deepspeed deepspeed_zero2\n  (SLURM) srun ${SRUN_ARGS} xtuner train internlm2_5_chat_7b_qlora_oasst1_e3 --launcher slurm --deepspeed deepspeed_zero2\n  ```\n\n  - `--deepspeed` 表示使用 [DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed) 🚀 来优化训练过程。XTuner 内置了多种策略，包括 ZeRO-1、ZeRO-2、ZeRO-3 等。如果用户期望关闭此功能，请直接移除此参数。\n\n  - 更多示例，请查阅[文档](./docs/zh_cn/user_guides/finetune.md)。\n\n- **步骤 2**，将保存的 PTH 模型（如果使用的DeepSpeed，则将会是一个文件夹）转换为 HuggingFace 模型：\n\n  ```shell\n  xtuner convert pth_to_hf ${CONFIG_NAME_OR_PATH} ${PTH} ${SAVE_PATH}\n  ```\n\n### 对话\n\nXTuner 提供与大语言模型对话的工具。\n\n```shell\nxtuner chat ${NAME_OR_PATH_TO_LLM} --adapter {NAME_OR_PATH_TO_ADAPTER} [optional arguments]\n```\n\n例如：\n\n与 InternLM2.5-Chat-7B 对话：\n\n```shell\nxtuner chat internlm/internlm2-chat-7b --prompt-template internlm2_chat\n```\n\n更多示例，请查阅[文档](./docs/zh_cn/user_guides/chat.md)。\n\n### 部署\n\n- **步骤 0**，将 HuggingFace adapter 合并到大语言模型：\n\n  ```shell\n  xtuner convert merge \\\n      ${NAME_OR_PATH_TO_LLM} \\\n      ${NAME_OR_PATH_TO_ADAPTER} \\\n      ${SAVE_PATH} \\\n      --max-shard-size 2GB\n  ```\n\n- **步骤 1**，使用任意推理框架部署微调后的大语言模型，例如 [LMDeploy](https://github.com/InternLM/lmdeploy) 🚀：\n\n  ```shell\n  pip install lmdeploy\n  python -m lmdeploy.pytorch.chat ${NAME_OR_PATH_TO_LLM} \\\n      --max_new_tokens 256 \\\n      --temperture 0.8 \\\n      --top_p 0.95 \\\n      --seed 0\n  ```\n\n  🔥 追求速度更快、显存占用更低的推理？欢迎体验 [LMDeploy](https://github.com/InternLM/lmdeploy) 提供的 4-bit 量化！使用指南请见[文档](https://github.com/InternLM/lmdeploy/tree/main#quantization)。\n\n### 评测\n\n- 推荐使用一站式平台 [OpenCompass](https://github.com/InternLM/opencompass) 来评测大语言模型，其目前已涵盖 50+ 数据集的约 30 万条题目。\n\n## 🤝 贡献指南\n\n我们感谢所有的贡献者为改进和提升 XTuner 所作出的努力。请参考[贡献指南](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)来了解参与项目贡献的相关指引。\n\n## 🎖️
