Richter, and Vladlen Koltun*.\n\n![](data/depth-pro-teaser.jpg)\n\nWe present a foundation model for zero-shot metric monocular depth estimation. Our model, Depth Pro, synthesizes high-resolution depth maps with unparalleled sharpness and high-frequency details. The predictions are metric, with absolute scale, without relying on the availability of metadata such as camera intrinsics. And the model is fast, producing a 2.25-megapixel depth map in 0.3 seconds on a standard GPU. These characteristics are enabled by a number of technical contributions, including an efficient multi-scale vision transformer for dense prediction, a training protocol that combines real and synthetic datasets to achieve high metric accuracy alongside fine boundary tracing, dedicated evaluation metrics for boundary accuracy in estimated depth maps, and state-of-the-art focal length estimation from a single image.\n\n\nThe model in this repository is a reference implementation, which has been re-trained. Its performance is close to the model reported in the paper but does not match it exactly.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nWe recommend setting up a virtual environment. Using e.g. miniconda, the `depth_pro` package can be installed via:\n\n```bash\nconda create -n depth-pro -y python=3.9\nconda activate depth-pro\n\npip install -e .\n```\n\nTo download pretrained checkpoints follow the code snippet below:\n```bash\nsource get_pretrained_models.sh   # Files will be downloaded to `checkpoints` directory.\n```\n\n### Running from commandline\n\nWe provide a helper script to directly run the model on a single image:\n```bash\n# Run prediction on a single image:\ndepth-pro-run -i ./data/example.jpg\n# Run `depth-pro-run -h` for available options.\n```\n\n### Running from python\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport depth_pro\n\n# Load model and preprocessing transform\nmodel, transform = depth_pro.create_model_and_transforms()\nmodel.eval()\n\n# Load and preprocess an image.\nimage, _, f_px = depth_pro.load_rgb(image_path)\nimage = transform(image)\n\n# Run inference.\nprediction = model.infer(image, f_px=f_px)\ndepth = prediction[\"depth\"]  # Depth in [m].\nfocallength_px = prediction[\"focallength_px\"]  # Focal length in pixels.\n```\n\n\n### Evaluation (boundary metrics) \n\nOur boundary metrics can be found under `eval/boundary_metrics.py` and used as follows:\n\n```python\n# for a depth-based dataset\nboundary_f1 = SI_boundary_F1(predicted_depth, target_depth)\n\n# for a mask-based dataset (image matting / segmentation) \nboundary_recall = SI_boundary_Recall(predicted_depth, target_mask)\n```\n\n\n## Citation\n\nIf you find our work useful, please cite the following paper:\n\n```bibtex\n@article{Bochkovskii2024:arxiv,\n  author     = {Aleksei Bochkovskii and Ama\\\"{e}l Delaunoy and Hugo Germain and Marcel Santos and\n               Yichao Zhou and Stephan R.
