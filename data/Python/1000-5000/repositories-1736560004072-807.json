GET trends also now\n requires authentication, while trends/:woeid doesn't.\n Patch and excellent description by jessica.mckellar\n\n https://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=218\n Currently, two Trends containing the same information\n (name, query, and timestamp) aren't considered equal because\n __eq__ isn't overridden, like it is for Status, User, and the\n other Twitter objects.\n Patch and excellent description by jessica.mckellar\n\n https://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=220\n https://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=211\n https://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=206\n All variations on a theme - basically Twitter is returning\n something different for an error payload.  Changed code to\n check for both 'error' and 'errors'.\n\n2011-05-08\n\n https://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=184\n A comment in this issue made me realize that the parameter sanity\n check for max_id was missing in GetMentions() - added\n\n First pass at working in some of the cursor support that has been\n in the Twitter API but we haven't made full use of - still working\n out the small issues.\n\n2011-04-16\n\n bumped version to 0.8.3\n released 0.8.2 to PyPI\n bumped version to 0.8.2\n\n Issue 193\n http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=193\n Missing retweet_count field on Status object\n Patch (with minor tweaks) by from alissonp\n\n Issue 181\n http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=181\n Add oauth2 to install_requires parameter list and also updated\n README to note that the oauth2 lib can be found in two locations\n\n Issue 182, Issue 137, Issue 93, Issue 190\n language value missing from User object\n Added 'lang' item and also some others that were needed:\n   verified, notifications, contributors_enabled and listed_count\n patches by wreinerat, apetresc, jpwigan and ghills\n\n2011-02-26\n\n Issue 166\n http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=166\n Added a basic, but sadly needed, check when parsing the json\n returned by Twitter as Twitter has a habit of returning the\n failwhale HTML page for a json api call :(\n Patch (with minor tweaks) by adam.aviv\n\n Issue 187\n http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=187\n Applied patch by edward.hades to fix issue where MaximumHitFrequency\n returns 0 when requests are maxed out\n\n Issue 184\n http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=184\n Applied patch by jmstaley to put into the GetUserTimeline API\n parameter list the max_id value (it was being completely ignored)\n\n2011-02-20\n\n Added retweeted to Status class\n Fixed Status class to return Hashtags list in AsDict() call\n\n Issue 185\n http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=185\n Added retweeted_status to Status class - patch by edward.hades\n\n Issue 183\n http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=183\n Removed errant print statement - reported by ProgVal\n\n2010-12-21\n\n Setting version to 0.8.1\n\n Issue 179\n http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=179\n Added MANIFEST.in to give setup.py sdist some clues as to what\n files to include in the tarball\n\n2010-11-14\n\n Setting version to 0.8 for a bit as having a branch for this is\n really overkill, i'll just take DeWitt advice and tag it when\n the release is out the door\n\n Issue 175\n http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=175\n Added geo_enabled to User class - basic parts of patch provided\n by adam.aviv with other bits added by me to allow it to pass tests\n\n Issue 174\n http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=174\n Added parts of adam.aviv's patch - the bits that add new field items\n to the Status class.\n\n Issue 159\n http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=159\n Added patch form adam.aviv to make the term parameter for GetSearch()\n optional if geocode parameter is supplied\n\n2010-11-03\n\n Ran pydoc to generate docs\n\n2010-10-16\n\n Fixed bad date in previous CHANGES entry\n\n Fixed source of the python-oauth2 library we use: from brosner\n to simplegeo\n\n I made a pass thru the docstrings and updated many to be the\n text from the current Twitter API docs.  Also fixed numerous\n whitespace issues and did a s/[optional]/[Optional]/ change.\n\n Imported work by Colin Howe that he did to get the tests working.\n http://code.google.com/r/colinthehowe-python-twitter-tests/source/detail?r=6cff589aca9c955df8354fe4d8e302ec4a2eb31c\n http://code.google.com/r/colinthehowe-python-twitter-tests/source/detail?r=cab8e32d7a9c34c66d2e75eebc7a1ba6e1eac8ce\n http://code.google.com/r/colinthehowe-python-twitter-tests/source/detail?r=b434d9e5dd7b989ae24483477e3f00b1ad362cc5\n\n Issue 169\n http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=169\n Patch by yaemog which adds missing Trends support.\n\n Issue 168\n http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=168\n Only cache successful results as suggested by yaemog.\n\n Issue 111\n http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=111\n Added a new GetUserRetweets() call as suggested by yash888\n Patch given was adjusted to reflect the current code requirements.\n\n Issue 110\n Added a VerifyCredentials() sample call to the README example\n\n Issue 105\n Added support for the page parameter to GetFriendsTimeline()\n as requested by jauderho.\n I also updated GetFriendsTimeline() to follow the current\n Twitter API documentation\n\n Somewhere in the patch frenzy of today an extra GetStatus()\n def was introduced!?! Luckily it was caught by the tests.\n wooo tests! \\m/\n\n Setting version to 0.8\n\n r0.8 branch created and trunk set to version 0.9-devel\n\n2010-09-26\n\n Issue 150\n http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=150\n Patch by blhobbes which removes a double quoting issue that\n was happening for GetSearch()\n Reported by huubhuubbarbatruuk\n\n Issue 160\n http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=160\n Patch by yaemog which adds support for include_rts and\n include_entities support to GetUserTimeline and GetPublicTimeline\n Small tweaks post-patch\n\n Applied docstring tweak suggested by dclinton in revision comment\n http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/source/detail?r=a858412e38f7e3856fef924291ef039284d3a6e1\n Thanks for the catch!\n\n Issue 164\n http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=164\n Patch by yaemog which adds GetRetweets support.\n Small tweaks and two typo fixes post-patch.\n\n Issue 165\n http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=165\n Patch by yaemog which adds GetStatus support.\n Small tweaks post-patch\n\n Issue 163\n http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=163\n Patch by yaemog which adds users/lookup support.\n Small tweaks to docstring only post-patch.\n\n Changed username/password parameter to Api class to be\n consumer_key/consumer_secret to better match the new\n oAuth only world that Twitter has demanded.\n\n Added debugHTTP to the parameter list to Api class to\n control if/when the urllib debug output is displayed.\n\n2010-08-25\n\n First pass at adding list support.\n Added a new List class and also added to the Api class\n new methods for working with lists:\n\n   CreateList(self, user, name, mode=None, description=None)\n   DestroyList(self, user, id)\n   CreateSubscription(self, owner, list)\n   DestroySubscription(self, owner, list)\n   GetSubscriptions(self, user, cursor=-1)\n   GetLists(self, user, cursor=-1)\n\n2010-08-24\n\n Fixed introduced bug in the Destroy* and Create* API calls\n where any of the routines were passing in an empty dict for\n POST data.  Before the oAuth change that was enough to tell\n _FetchUrl() to use POST instead of GET but now a non-empty\n dict is required.\n\n Issue 144\n http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=144\n GetFriends() where it was failing with a 'unicode object has\n no attribute get'. This was caused when Twitter changed how\n they return the JSON data. It used to be a straight list but\n now there are some elements *and* then the list.\n\n2010-08-18\n\n Applied the json/simplejson part of the patch found\n in Issue 64 (http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=64)\n Patch provided by Thomas Bohmbach\n\n Applied patch provided by liris.pp in Issue 147\n http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=147\n Ensures that during a PostStatus we count the length using a unicode aware\n len() routine.  Tweaked patch slightly to take into account that the\n twitter.Api() instance may have been setup with None for input_encoding.\n\n2010-08-17\n\n Fixed error in the POST path for _FetchUrl() where by\n I show to the world that yes, I do make last minute\n changes and completely forget to test them :(\n Thanks to Peter Sanchez for finding and pointing to\n working code that showed the fix\n\n2010-08-15\n\n Added more help text (I hope it helps) to the README\n and also to get_access_token.py.\n\n Added doctext notes to twitter.Api() parameter list\n to explain more about oAuth.\n\n Added import exception handling for parse_qs() and\n parse_qsl() as it seems those funcitons moved between\n 2.5 and 2.6 so the oAuth update broke the lib under\n python2.5.  Thanks to Rich for the bug find (sorry\n it had to be found the hard way!)\n\n from changeset 184:60315000989c by DeWitt\n Update the generated twitter.py docs to match the trunk\n\n2010-08-14\n\n Fixed silly typo in _FetchUrl() when doing a POST\n Thanks to Peter Sanchez for the find and fix!\n\n Added some really basic text to the get_access_token.py\n startup output that explains why, for now, you need to\n visit Twitter and get an Application key/secret to use\n this library\n\n2010-08-12\n\n Updated code to use python-oauth2 library for authentication.\n Twitter has set a deadline, 2010-08-16 as of this change, for\n the switch from Basic to oAuth.\n\n The oAuth integration was inspired by the work done by\n Hameedullah Khan and others.\n\n The change to using python-oauth2 library was done purely to\n align python-twitter with an oauth library that was maintained\n and had tests to try and minimize grief moving forward.\n\n Slipped into GetFriendsTimeline() a new parameter, retweets, to\n allow the call to pull from the \"friends_timeline\" or the\n \"home_timeline\".\n\n Fixed some typos and white-space issues and also updated the\n README to point to the new Twitter Dev site.\n\n2010-08-02\n\n Updated copyright information.\n\n2010-06-13\n\n Applied changeset from nicdumz repo nicdumz-cleaner-python-twitter\n   r=07df3feee06c8d0f9961596e5fceae9e74493d25\n   datetime is required for MaximumHitFrequency\n\n Applied changeset from nicdumz repo nicdumz-cleaner-python-twitter\n   r=dd669dff32d101856ed6e50fe8bd938640b04d77\n   update source URLs in README\n\n Applied changeset from nicdumz repo nicdumz-cleaner-python-twitter\n   r=8f0796d7fdcea17f4162aeb22d3c36cb603088c7\n   adjust tests to reflect http://twitter.com -> https://twitter.com change\n\n Applied changeset from nicdumz repo nicdumz-cleaner-python-twitter\n   r=3c05b8ebe59eca226d9eaef2760cecca9d50944a\n   tests: add .info() method to objects returned by our Mockup handler\n   This is required to completely mimick urllib, and have successful\n   response.headers attribute accesses.\n\n Applied partial patch for Issue 113\n http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=113\n\n   The partial bit means we changed the parameter from \"page\" to \"cursor\"\n   so the call would work.  What was left out was a more direct way\n   to return the cursor value *after* the call and also in the patch\n   they also changed the method to return an iterator.\n\n2010-05-17\n\n Issue 50 http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=50\n Applied patch by wheaties.box that implements a new method to return\n the Rate Limit Status and also adds the new method MaximumHitFrequency\n\n Multiple typo, indent and whitespace tweaks\n\n Issue 60 http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=60\n Pulled out new GetFavorites and GetMentions methods from the patch\n submitted by joegermuska\n\n Issue 62 http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=62\n Applied patch from lukev123 that adds gzip compression to the GET\n requests sent to Twitter. The patch was modified to default gzip to\n False and to allow the twitter.API class instantiation to set the\n value to True.  This was done to not change current default\n behaviour radically.\n\n Issue 80 http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=80\n Fixed PostUpdate() call example in the README\n\n2010-05-16\n\n Issue 19 http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=19\n TinyURL example and the idea for this comes from a bug filed by\n acolorado with patch provided by ghills.\n\n Issue 37 http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/issues/detail?id=37\n Added base_url to the twitter.API class init call to allow the user\n to override the default https://twitter.com base.

          "content": "================================================\nHow to use python-twitter with Google App Engine\n================================================\n\n**********\nBackground\n**********\n\nGoogle App Engine uses virtual machines to do work and serve your application's content. In order to make a 'regular' external web request, the instance must use the built-in urlfetch library provided by Google in addition to the traditional python requests library. As a result, a few extra steps must be followed to use python-twitter on App Engine.\n\n\n*************\nPrerequisites\n*************\n\nFollow the `third party vendor library install instructions <https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/using-libraries-python-27#vendoring>`_ to include the dependency libraries listed in ``requirements.txt``: ``requests``, ``requests_oauthlib`` and ``requests_toolbelt``, as well as ``python-twitter`` library. Typically you can just place the  module folders into the same place as your app.yaml file; it might look something like this:\n\n| myapp/\n| ├── twitter/\n| ├── requests_oauthlib/\n| ├── requests_toolbelt/\n| ├── main.py \n| └── app.yaml\n\n\n********\napp.yaml\n********\n\nIn order to use HTTPS, you'll have to make sure the built-in SSL library is properly imported in your ``app.yaml`` file. Here's what that section of your ``app.yaml`` file might look like:\n\n| libraries:\n| - name: jinja2\n|  version: latest\n| - name: webapp2\n|  version: latest\n| - name: ssl\n|  version: latest\n\n\n****************************\nLimitations & Considerations\n****************************\n\nCaching\n^^^^^^^\nWhen using twitter-python on App Engine, caching is disabled. You'll have to add and manage App Engine's memcache logic on your own if you require any caching beyond what is probably already setup on App Engine by default.\n\nDatastore\n^^^^^^^^^\nIf you plan to store tweets or other information returned by the API in Datastore, you'll probably want to make your own NDP models to store the desired components of the response rather than shoving the whole response into an entity.\n\nSockets\n^^^^^^^^^\nWhen urllib3 is imported on App Engine it will throw a warning about sockets: ``AppEnginePlatformWarning: urllib3 is using URLFetch on Google App Engine sandbox...`` This is just a warning that you'd have to use the Sockets API if you intend to use the sockets feature of the library, which we don't use in python-twitter so it can be ignored.\n"

          "content": "Python Twitter\n\nA Python wrapper around the Twitter API.\n\nBy the `Python-Twitter Developers <python-twitter@googlegroups.com>`_\n\n============\nNOTICE\n============\nI've archived this repo to mark that I'm not going to be maintaining it. It's open-source so anyone using it can fork or take it over.\nThank you to all the people that contributed to it in the past \n\n============\nIntroduction\n============\n\nThis library provides a pure Python interface for the `Twitter API <https://dev.twitter.com/>`_. It works with Python versions from 2.7+ and Python 3.\n\n`Twitter <http://twitter.com>`_ provides a service that allows people to connect via the web, IM, and SMS. Twitter exposes a `web services API <https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs>`_ and this library is intended to make it even easier for Python programmers to use.\n\n==========\nInstalling\n==========\n\nYou can install python-twitter using::\n\n    $ pip install python-twitter\n\n\nIf you are using python-twitter on Google App Engine, see `more information <GAE.rst>`_ about including 3rd party vendor library dependencies in your App Engine project.\n\n\n================\nGetting the code\n================\n\nThe code is hosted at https://github.com/bear/python-twitter\n\nCheck out the latest development version anonymously with::\n\n    $ git clone git://github.com/bear/python-twitter.git\n    $ cd python-twitter\n\nTo install dependencies, run either::\n\n\t$ make dev\n\nor::\n\n    $ pip install -Ur requirements.testing.txt\n    $ pip install -Ur requirements.txt\n\nNote that ```make dev``` will install into your local ```pyenv``` all of the versions needed for test runs using ```tox```.\n\nTo install the minimal dependencies for production use (i.e., what is installed\nwith ``pip install python-twitter``) run::\n\n    $ make env\n\nor::\n\n    $ pip install -Ur requirements.txt\n\n=============\nRunning Tests\n=============\nThe test suite can be run against a single Python version or against a range of them depending on which Makefile target you select.\n\nNote that tests require ```pip install pytest``` and optionally ```pip install pytest-cov``` (these are included if you have installed dependencies from ```requirements.testing.txt```)\n\nTo run the unit tests with a single Python version::\n\n    $ make test\n\nto also run code coverage::\n\n    $ make coverage\n\nTo run the unit tests against a set of Python versions::\n\n    $ make tox\n\n=============\nDocumentation\n=============\n\nView the latest python-twitter documentation at\nhttps://python-twitter.readthedocs.io. You can view Twitter's API documentation at: https://dev.twitter.com/overview/documentation\n\n=====\nUsing\n=====\n\nThe library provides a Python wrapper around the Twitter API and the Twitter data model. To get started, check out the examples in the examples/ folder or read the documentation at https://python-twitter.readthedocs.io which contains information about getting your authentication keys from Twitter and using the library.\n\n------------------\nUsing with Django\n------------------\n\nAdditional template tags that expand tweet urls and urlize tweet text. See the django template tags available for use with python-twitter: https://github.com/radzhome/python-twitter-django-tags\n\n------\nModels\n------\n\nThe library utilizes models to represent various data structures returned by Twitter. Those models are:\n    * twitter.Category\n    * twitter.DirectMessage\n    * twitter.Hashtag\n    * twitter.List\n    * twitter.Media\n    * twitter.Status\n    * twitter.Trend\n    * twitter.Url\n    * twitter.User\n    * twitter.UserStatus\n\nTo read the documentation for any of these models, run::\n\n    $ pydoc twitter.[model]\n\n---\nAPI\n---\n\nThe API is exposed via the ``twitter.Api`` class.\n\nThe python-twitter requires the use of OAuth keys for nearly all operations. As of Twitter's API v1.1, authentication is required for most, if not all, endpoints. Therefore, you will need to register an app with Twitter in order to use this library. Please see the \"Getting Started\" guide on https://python-twitter.readthedocs.io for more information.\n\nTo generate an Access Token you have to pick what type of access your application requires and then do one of the following:\n\n- `Generate a token to access your own account <https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/overview/application-owner-access-tokens>`_\n- `Generate a pin-based token <https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/pin-based>`_\n- use the helper script `get_access_token.py <https://github.com/bear/python-twitter/blob/master/get_access_token.py>`_\n\nFor full details see the `Twitter OAuth Overview <https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/overview>`_\n\nTo create an instance of the ``twitter.Api`` with login credentials (Twitter now requires an OAuth Access Token for all API calls)::\n\n    >>> import twitter\n    >>> api = twitter.Api(consumer_key='consumer_key',\n                          consumer_secret='consumer_secret',\n                          access_token_key='access_token',\n                          access_token_secret='access_token_secret')\n\nTo see if your credentials are successful::\n\n    >>> print(api.VerifyCredentials())\n    {\"id\": 16133, \"location\": \"Philadelphia\", \"name\": \"bear\"}\n\n**NOTE**: much more than the small sample given here will print\n\nTo fetch a single user's public status messages, where ``user`` is a Twitter user's screen name::\n\n    >>> statuses = api.GetUserTimeline(screen_name=user)\n    >>> print([s.text for s in statuses])\n\nTo fetch a list of a user's friends::\n\n    >>> users = api.GetFriends()\n    >>> print([u.name for u in users])\n\nTo post a Twitter status message::\n\n    >>> status = api.PostUpdate('I love python-twitter!')\n    >>> print(status.text)\n    I love python-twitter!\n\nThere are many more API methods, to read the full API documentation either\ncheck out the documentation on `readthedocs\n<https://python-twitter.readthedocs.io>`_, build the documentation locally\nwith::\n\n    $ make docs\n\nor check out the inline documentation with::\n\n    $ pydoc twitter.Api\n\n------\nTodo\n------\n\nPatches, pull requests, and bug reports are `welcome <https://github.com/bear/python-twitter/issues/new>`_, just please keep the style consistent with the original source.\n\nIn particular, having more example scripts would be a huge help. If you have\na program that uses python-twitter and would like a link in the documentation,\nsubmit a pull request against ``twitter/doc/getting_started.rst`` and add your\nprogram at the bottom.\n\nThe twitter.Status and ``twitter.User`` classes are going to be hard to keep in sync with the API if the API changes. More of the code could probably be written with introspection.\n\nThe ``twitter.Status`` and ``twitter.User`` classes could perform more validation on the property setters.\n\n----------------\nMore Information\n----------------\n\nPlease visit `the google group <http://groups.google.com/group/python-twitter>`_ for more discussion.\n\n------------\nContributors\n------------\n\nOriginally two libraries by DeWitt Clinton and Mike Taylor which were then merged into python-twitter.\n\nNow it's a full-on open source project with many contributors over time.
