But when it comes to the programming interview preparation, I feel it‚Äôs important to choose one language to focus your prep on and get to know it very well.\nIt takes some time for languages to master, and if you spend most of your time and resources on mastering algorithms, there's hardly any spare effort left to master a new language. If you are comfortable with using one of the mainstream languages, only for interviews, there is no good need to learn a new language.\n <br><br>\n## Pick up a language you have worked with and you are confident with!\n\nBut if you have enough time, I'd suggest you to learn the most used languages during candidates<br> (this is just my suggestion, you can also go with any other language you want or you are comfortable with): <br>\n:closed_book: C++ <br>\n:closed_book: Java <br>\n:closed_book: Python <br>\n:closed_book: C <br>\n<br>\n## Some of the languages used at various organisations as reported online:\n\n    \n        \n          \n    \n\n        \n  \n:orange_book: Amazon: Java, Javascript, Ruby, Python, Perl [sources](https://www.quora.com/What-programming-languages-are-used-at-Amazon) <br>\n:orange_book: Facebook: PHP, C++, Python, Java, Perl. High regard for dynamic/scripting languages.

Below are some materials that will help. Inside the information there will be a few links, a video, and also a few practice problems to help you know what to expect. Here are the top notes:\nYou will be given a problem or puzzle to solve and you‚Äôll need to talk about your approach and discuss the complexity of the solutions you are proposing. You will then need to code up your solution. You‚Äòll want to practice coding with the first 100-150 unsorted problems on LeetCode.\n\n\nAlways talk through your solution, explain any trade-offs you are making between time and memory and ask any questions you need to clarify the question. It is worthwhile to talk about your initial thoughts to a question, though a brute force solution will be received less well than taking time to compose a more efficient solution.\n<br><br><br>\n\n\n # üèÜ  The sequence for studying Data Structures and Algorithms should be as follows: \n\n1Ô∏è‚É£  [Arrays](\"https://github.com/anushka23g/Complete-Placement-Preparation/blob/main/ARRAYS.pdf\") & [Matrix](\"https://github.com/anushka23g/Complete-Placement-Preparation/blob/main/MATRIX.pdf\") \\\n2Ô∏è‚É£  [String](\"https://github.com/anushka23g/Complete-Placement-Preparation/blob/main/STRING.pdf\") \\\n3Ô∏è‚É£ Searching\\\n4Ô∏è‚É£ Sorting\\\n5Ô∏è‚É£ Hashing\\\n6Ô∏è‚É£ Stack\\\n7Ô∏è‚É£ Queue\\\n8Ô∏è‚É£ Linked List\\\n9Ô∏è‚É£ Recursion\\\n1Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£ Backtracking\\\n1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Tree\\\n1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ BST\\\n1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ Heap or priority queue\\\n1Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ Graph\\\n1Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ Greedy\\\n1Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£ Dynamic programming\\\n1Ô∏è‚É£7Ô∏è‚É£Trie\n <br><br><br>\n\n\n# üèÜ  Technical Preparation tips:\n<br>\nThe main areas software engineers should prepare to succeed at interview at FAANG:<br>\n\nüìó ***Algorithm Complexity:*** It's fairly critical that you understand big-O complexity analysis. Again\nrun some practice problems to get this down in application. \n<br><br>\n\nüìó ***Sorting:*** Know how to sort. Don't do bubble-sort. You should know the details of at least one\nn*log(n) sorting algorithm, preferably two (say, quicksort and merge sort). Merge sort can be\nhighly useful in situations where quicksort is impractical, so take a look at it. \n<br><br>\n\nüìó ***Hashtables:*** Arguably the single most important data structure known to mankind. You absolutely\nshould know how they work. Be able to implement one using only arrays in your favorite\nlanguage, in about the space of one interview. \n<br><br>\n\nüìó ***Trees:*** Know about trees; basic tree construction, traversal and manipulation algorithms. \nFamiliarize yourself with binary trees, n-ary trees, and trie-trees. Be familiar with at least one type\nof balanced binary tree, whether it's a red/black tree, a splay tree or an AVL tree, and know how\nit's implemented. <br> Understand tree traversal algorithms: BFS and DFS, and know the difference\nbetween inorder, postorder and preorder.\n<br><br>\n\nüìó ***Graphs:*** Graphs are really important. There are 3 basic ways to represent a graph in\nmemory (objects and pointers, matrix, and adjacency list); familiarize yourself with each\nrepresentation and its pros & cons. You should know the basic graph traversal algorithms:\nbreadth-first search and depth-first search. Know their computational complexity, their tradeoffs, and how to implement them in real code. If you get a chance, try to study up on fancier\nalgorithms, such as Dijkstra and A*.\n<br><br>\nüìó ***Other data structures:*** You should study up on as many other data structures and algorithms as\npossible. You should especially know about the most famous classes of NP-complete problems,\nsuch as traveling salesman and the knapsack problem, and be able to recognize them when an\ninterviewer asks you them in disguise. Find out what NP-complete means. \n<br><br>\nüìó ***Mathematics:*** Some interviewers ask basic discrete math questions.\nThis is more prevalent at Google than at other companies because we are surrounded by\ncounting problems, probability problems, and other Discrete Math 101 situations. Spend some\ntime before the interview refreshing your memory on (or teaching yourself) the essentials of\ncombinatorics and probability. You should be familiar with n-choose-k problems and their ilk ‚Äì the\nmore the better.\n<br><br>\nüìó ***Operating Systems:*** Know about processes, threads and concurrency issues. Know about locks\nand mutexes and semaphores and monitors and how they work. Know about deadlock and\nlivelock and how to avoid them. Know what resources a processes needs, and a thread needs,\nand how context switching works, and how it's initiated by the operating system and underlying\nhardware. Know a little about scheduling. The world is rapidly moving towards multi-core, so\nknow the fundamentals of \"modern\" concurrency constructs. \n<br><br>\nüìó ***Coding:*** You should know at least one programming language really well, and it should\npreferably be C++ or Java. C# is OK too, since it's pretty similar to Java. You will be expected to\nwrite some code in at least some of your interviews. You will be expected to know a fair amount\nof detail about your favorite programming language.\n<br><br><br>\n\n# üèÜ Projects:\n:heavy_check_mark: For examples of project you can check my other repositories [here](https://github.com/anushka23g?tab=repositories) , Will be adding more projects soon!\n<br>\n:heavy_check_mark: If you are a beginner and wish to learn Data Structures and Algorithms in a fun way :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: , try working on [this](https://github.com/anushka23g/Learning-Made-Easy) project, It will help you clear a lot of concepts, make you confident about your skills and you'll gain better knowledge of DSA. <br>\n:unicorn: You can also contribute to the project and help the community if you wish to!  \n<br><br>\n\n# üèÜ SOME EXTRA TIPS:\n\n## :beginner: Coding Practice\nüìí [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)  (Go to Problems -> Algorithms)\\\nüìí [GeeksForGeeks](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/explore/?page=1)\\\nüìí [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)\n\n    \n  \n## :beginner: General Interview Prep\nüìö [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) \\\nüìö [High Scalability](http://highscalability.squarespace.com/) \\\nüìö [Interview Puzzles](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/puzzles/)\nDONT FORGET TO CHECKOUT my followup article more better preparation [HERE](https://medium.com/getpieces/snippetizing-your-coding-interviews-4ec4eb2f0d89) - Has more tips and tricks on how I prepared!!\nWill be soon adding resources for CS Fundamentals as well...\n \n \n \n ***Do star, fork and share the repo to show your support, it would help others too!***   <br>\n <br>\n Let me know your views on the repository or any changes or improvements and if you wish to contribute too at: anushkagupta20128@gmail.com or ***[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anushka-gupta-679496196/)***\n \n :heart: ***Thank you all for making this repository trend at Number 10, in the worldwide trending on Github*** \n"
