The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.

It is intended to aid the demonstration and testing of microservice and cloud native technologies.\n\nIt is built using [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/), [Go kit](http://gokit.io) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and is packaged in Docker containers.\n\nYou can read more about the [application design](./internal-docs/design.md).\n\n## Deployment Platforms\n\nThe [deploy folder](./deploy/) contains scripts and instructions to provision the application onto your favourite platform. \n\nPlease let us know if there is a platform that you would like to see supported.\n\n## Bugs, Feature Requests and Contributing\n\nWe'd love to see community contributions. We like to keep it simple and use Github issues to track bugs and feature requests and pull requests to manage contributions. See the [contribution information](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n\n## Screenshot\n\n![Sock Shop frontend](https://github.com/microservices-demo/microservices-demo.github.io/raw/master/assets/sockshop-frontend.png)\n\n## Visualizing the application\n\nUse [Weave Scope](http://weave.works/products/weave-scope/) or [Weave Cloud](http://cloud.weave.works/) to visualize the application once it's running in the selected [target platform](./deploy/).\n\n![Sock Shop in Weave Scope](https://github.com/microservices-demo/microservices-demo.github.io/raw/master/assets/sockshop-scope.png)\n\n## \n"
