I do not get them often. They are behind my right eye and temple area. Now this time I am also fighting with heavy cold and cough. It came on late morning today and it hurts more when I cough or shake my head or bend over. Prior to this, I had the same headache about four months ago. At that time it came on midafternoon and lasted till next morning. Prior to that, I had the same headache exactly on the right side and lasted for a day. I am on CCB and Protonix. I am scared of brain tumor. Please help\n\nReal doctor answer from icliniq: Hi. Based on what you have told, this is more likely to be due to sinusitis. Sinuses are small air filled cavities in your skull bone. They can get infected and when they are infected, you will get headaches behind eyes. Such headaches will be more common during cold and cough. Brain tumor headache will be on both sides, more in forehead and you will also have vomiting in that case. Based on what you have told, this is more likely due to simple sinus infection instead of brain tumor. CT brain and CT paranasal sinuses.\n\nAnswer form ChatGPT: Hello! I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing these headaches. Based on the location of the pain, it sounds like it may be a tension headache or a migraine. These types of headaches can sometimes be triggered by colds or other illnesses. However, it's always best to get checked out by your doctor to rule out any other underlying conditions. In terms of a brain tumor, that is a very rare cause of headaches. Most people who experience headaches do not have a brain tumor. That being said, if you have any concerning symptoms such as vision changes, weakness, or numbness, it is important to seek medical attention right away. In the meantime, you can try taking over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen to help with the headache. It's also important to get plenty of rest and stay hydrated. If the headaches persist or become more frequent, please make an appointment with your doctor. Take care!\n\nAnswer form ChatDoctor: Hi, Thank you for posting your query. First, I would like to reassure you that there is no need to worry about brain tumor. Also, we should keep migraine apart as well. The most likely cause of your headaches could be sinusitis. This can be confirmed by doing an X-ray of face. Treatment would consist of using decongestant tablets/ nasal sprays. Best wishes, Chat Doctor.\n```\nChatDoctor accurately mentions sinusitis, which is also present in the real conversation in icliniq.\n\n\n## Overview\nChatDoctor is a next-generation AI doctor model that is based on the [LLaMA](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama) model. The goal of this project is to provide patients with an intelligent and reliable healthcare companion that can answer their medical queries and provide them with personalized medical advice.\n\nThe ChatDoctor is an advanced language model that is specifically designed for medical applications. It has been trained on a large corpus of medical literature and has a deep understanding of medical terminology, procedures, and diagnoses. This model serves as the foundation for ChatDoctor, enabling it to analyze patients' symptoms and medical history, provide accurate diagnoses, and suggest appropriate treatment options.\n\nThe ChatDoctor model is designed to simulate a conversation between a doctor and a patient, using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. Patients can interact with the ChatDoctor model through a chat interface, asking questions about their health, symptoms, or medical conditions. The model will then analyze the input and provide a response that is tailored to the patient's unique situation.\n\nOne of the key features of the ChatDoctor model is its ability to learn and adapt over time. As more patients interact with the model, it will continue to refine its responses and improve its accuracy. This means that patients can expect to receive increasingly personalized and accurate medical advice over time.\n\n\n ## Patient-physician Conversation Dataset</h2>\nThe first step in fine-tuning is to collect a dataset of patient-physician conversations. In patient-physician conversations, the patient's descriptions of disease symptoms are often colloquial and cursory. If we manually construct the synthesized patient-physician conversation dataset, it often leads to the problem of insufficient diversity and over-specialized descriptions, which are often spaced out from real scenarios. Collecting real patient-physician conversations is a better solution. Therefore, we collected about 100k real doctor-patient conversations from an online medical consultation website HealthCareMagic(www.healthcaremagic.com). We filtered these data both manually and automatically, removed the identity information of the doctor and patient, and used language tools to correct grammatical errors, and we named this dataset HealthCareMagic-100k. In addition, we collected approximately 10k patient-physician conversations from the online medical consultation website iCliniq to evaluate the performance of our model.\n\n\n## Autonomous ChatDoctor based on Knowledge Brain</h2>\nEquipped with the external knowledge brain, i.e., Wikipedia or our constructed database encompassing over 700 diseases, ChatDoctor could retrieve the corresponding knowledge and reliable sources to answer patients' inquiries more accurately. After constructing the external knowledge brain, we need to let our ChatDoctor retrieve the knowledge he needs autonomously, which can generally be achieved in a large language model by constructing appropriate prompts. To automate this process, we design keyword mining prompts for ChatDoctor to extract key terms for relevant knowledge seeking. Then, the top-ranked relevant passages were retrieved from Knowledge Brain with a term-matching retrieval system. As for the disease database, since the model cannot read all the data at once, we first let the model read the data in batches and select for itself the data entries that might help answer the patient's question. Finally, all the data entries selected by the model are given to the model for a final answer. This approach better ensures that patients receive well-informed and precise responses backed by credible references.\n\n\n\n## Limitations\nWe emphasize that ChatDoctor is for academic research only and any commercial use and clinical use is prohibited. There are three factors in this decision: First, ChatDoctor is based on LLaMA and has a non-commercial license, so we necessarily inherited this decision. Second, our model is not licensed for healthcare-related purposes. Also, we have not designed sufficient security measures, and the current model still does not guarantee the full correctness of medical diagnoses.\n\n\n\n\n## Reference\n\nChatDoctor: A Medical Chat Model Fine-tuned on LLaMA Model using Medical Domain Knowledge\n\n```\n@article{li2023chatdoctor,\n  title={ChatDoctor: A Medical Chat Model Fine-Tuned on a Large Language Model Meta-AI (LLaMA) Using Medical Domain Knowledge},\n  author={Li, Yunxiang and Li, Zihan and Zhang, Kai and Dan, Ruilong and Jiang, Steve and Zhang, You},\n  journal={Cureus},\n  volume={15},\n  number={6},\n  year={2023},\n  publisher={Cureus}\n}\n```\n\n\n\n\n"

It may also include significant behavioral changes lasting at least a month and of ongoing worry about the implications or concern about having other attacks. The latter are called anticipatory attacks (DSM-IVR). Panic disorder is not the same as agoraphobia (fear of public places), although many afflicted with panic disorder also suffer from agoraphobia. Panic attacks cannot be predicted, therefore an individual may become stressed, anxious or worried wondering when the next panic attack will occur. Panic disorder may be differentiated as a medical condition, or chemical imbalance. The DSM-IV-TR describes panic disorder and anxiety differently. Whereas anxiety is preceded by chronic stressors which build to reactions of moderate intensity that can last for days, weeks or months, panic attacks are acute events triggered by a sudden, out-of-the-blue cause: duration is short and symptoms are more intense. Panic attacks can occur in children, as well as adults. Panic in young people may be particularly distressing because children tend to have less insight about what is happening, and parents are also likely to experience distress when attacks occur. \",\"['Psychotherapy', 'Mental health counseling', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Depression screen (Depression screening)', 'Toxicology screen', 'Psychological and psychiatric evaluation and therapy']\",\"['Lorazepam', 'Alprazolam (Xanax)', 'Clonazepam', 'Paroxetine (Paxil)', 'Venlafaxine (Effexor)', 'Mirtazapine', 'Buspirone (Buspar)', 'Fluvoxamine (Luvox)', 'Imipramine', 'Desvenlafaxine (Pristiq)', 'Clomipramine', 'Acamprosate (Campral)']\"\r\n1,Vocal cord polyp,\"['Hoarse voice', 'Sore throat', 'Difficulty speaking', 'Cough', 'Nasal congestion', 'Throat swelling', 'Diminished hearing', 'Lump in throat', 'Throat feels tight', 'Difficulty in swallowing', 'Skin swelling', 'Retention of urine']\",\" beclomethasone nasal product, \",\"['Tracheoscopy and laryngoscopy with biopsy', 'Occupational therapy assessment (Speech therapy)', 'Other diagnostic procedures (interview; evaluation; consultation)', 'Physical therapy exercises (Exercises)', 'Diagnostic procedures on nose; mouth and pharynx', 'Other physical therapy and rehabilitation', 'Ophthalmologic and otologic diagnosis and treatment']\",\"['Esomeprazole (Nexium)', 'Beclomethasone Nasal Product', 'Nicotine', 'Azelastine Nasal', 'Phenylephrine (Duramax)', 'Rabeprazole (Aciphex)', 'Vinorelbine (Navelbine)', 'Vitamin A', 'Adalimumab (Humira)', 'Rituximab']\"\r\n2,Turner syndrome,\"['Groin mass', 'Leg pain', 'Hip pain', 'Suprapubic pain', 'Blood in stool', 'Lack of growth', 'Diminished hearing', 'Depression', 'Emotional symptoms', 'Elbow weakness', 'Back weakness', 'Pus in sputum']\",\"Turner syndrome or Ullrich\\xe2\\x80\\x93Turner syndrome (also known as \"\"Gonadal dysgenesis\"\":550), 45,X, encompasses several conditions in human females, of which monosomy X (absence of an entire sex chromosome, the Barr body) is most common.

Other types of eating disorders include binge eating disorder and eating disorder not otherwise specified. Bulimia nervosa is a disorder characterized by binge eating and purging. Purging can include self-induce vomiting, over-exercising, and the usage of diuretics, enemas, and laxatives. Anorexia nervosa is characterized by extreme food restriction to the point of self-starvation and excessive weight loss.

An estimated 10 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 15% of people with eating disorders are males (Gorgan, 1999). (an estimated 1 million U.K. males being affected). Although eating disorders are increasing all over the world among both men and women, there is evidence to suggest that it is women in the Western world who are at the highest risk of developing them and the degree of westernization increases the risk. Nearly half of all Americans personally know someone with an eating disorder. The skill to comprehend the central processes of appetite has increased tremendously since leptin was discovered, and the skill to observe the functions of the brain as well.

The disease is spread via the fecal-oral route through contaminated food and water, and is primarily a food borne disease. After ingestion the eggs pass through the lumen of the intestine into the tissues and migrate preferentially to the brain and muscles. There they form cysts that can persist for years. In some cases the cysts will eventually cause an inflammatory reaction presenting as painful nodules in the muscles and seizures when the cysts are located in the brain. Symptomatic disease from Taenia solium cysts in the brain is referred to as neurocysticercosis and is the most common tapeworm infection of the brain worldwide. Cysticercosis should be differentiated from taeniasis: carriage of the adult tapeworm in the intestine (which is through ingestion of cysts in an intermediate host, not the ingestion of the eggs as in cysticercosis).

A marked increase in non-blood tissue eosinophil count noticed upon histopathologic examination is diagnostic for tissue eosinophilia. Several causes are known, with the most common being some form of allergic reaction or parasitosis. Diagnosis of eosinophilia is via a complete blood count (CBC), but diagnostic procedures directed at the underlying cause vary depending on the suspected condition(s). An absolute eosinophil count is not generally needed if the CBC shows marked eosinophilia. The location of the causal factor can be used to classify eosinophilia into two general types: extrinsic, in which the factor lies outside of the eosinophil cell lineage; and intrinsic eosinophilia, which denotes etiologies within the eosiniphil cell line. Specific treatments are dictated by the causative condition, though in idiopathic eosinophilia, the disease may be controlled with corticosteroids.

The ICP gradually falls but still maintains a slightly elevated level and the CSF pressure reaches a high normal level of 150 to 200 mmH2O. Measurements of ICP, therefore, are not usually elevated. Because of this equilibration, patients do not exhibit the classic signs that accompany increased intracranial pressure such as headache, nausea, vomiting, or altered consciousness, although some studies have shown pressure elevations to occur intermittently. However, the enlarged ventricles put increased pressure on the adjacent cortical tissue and cause myriad effects in the patient. The classic symptom triad (gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, and dementia or mental decline) was first described by Hakim and Adams in 1965. NPH is often misdiagnosed as Parkinson\\'s disease, Alzheimer\\'s disease, or dementia, due to its chronic nature and nonspecific presenting symptoms .

According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR), symptoms emerge before seven years of age. There are three subtypes of the disorder which consist of it being predominantly inattentive (ADHD-PI or ADHD-I), predominantly hyperactive-impulsive (ADHD-HI or ADHD-H), or the two combined (ADHD-C). Often people refer to ADHD-PI as \"\"attention deficit disorder\"\" (ADD), however, the latter has not been officially accepted since the 1994 revision of the DSM. ADHD impacts school-aged children and results in restlessness, acting impulsively, and lack of focus which may impair school performance. \",\"['Psychotherapy', 'Mental health counseling', 'Depression screen (Depression screening)', 'Psychological and psychiatric evaluation and therapy', 'Occupational therapy assessment (Speech therapy)', 'Electroencephalogram (EEG) (Eeg)', 'Cerebral arteriogram (Angiography cerebral)']\",\"['Methylphenidate', 'Adderall', 'Clonidine', 'Atomoxetine (Strattera)', 'Dexmethylphenidate (Focalin)', 'Risperidone', 'Lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse)', 'Aripiprazole (Abilify)', 'Guanfacine (Intuniv)', 'Oxcarbazepine (Trileptal)', 'Melatonin', 'Dextroamphetamine (Adderall)']\"\r\n141,Neuromyelitis optica,\"['Painful urination', 'Ache all over', 'Arm pain', 'Loss of sensation', 'Weakness', 'Diminished vision', 'Vulvar sore', 'Excessive growth', 'Knee lump or mass', 'Nailbiting', 'Shoulder swelling', 'Neck cramps or spasms']\",\"Neuromyelitis optica (NMO), also known as Devic\\'s disease or Devic\\'s syndrome, is an autoimmune, inflammatory disorder in which a person\\'s own immune system attacks the optic nerves and spinal cord.

Pernicious anemia, if left untreated, is usually fatal within three years. Once identified, however, the condition can be treated successfully and with relative ease, although it cannot be cured and ongoing treatment is required. Humans obtain almost all of their vitamin B12 from dietary means. Pernicious anemia is usually the result of insufficient secretion of intrinsic factor within the stomach.

In panic attacks that continue unabated, and are triggered by a situation from which the sufferer desires to escape, some sufferers may make frantic efforts to escape, which may be violent if others attempt to contain the sufferer. Some panic attacks can subside on their own over the next several hours. Often, those afflicted will experience significant anticipatory anxiety and limited symptom attacks in between attacks, in situations where attacks have previously occurred. The effects of a panic attack vary. Some, notably first-time sufferers, may call for emergency services.

Anal fissures usually extend from the anal opening and are usually located posteriorly in the midline, probably because of the relatively unsupported nature and poor perfusion of the anal wall in that location. Fissure depth may be superficial or sometimes down to the underlying sphincter muscle. \",\"['Rectal examination', 'Sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy', 'Excision (Removal)', 'Colonoscopy and biopsy', 'Other OR lower GI therapeutic procedures', 'Proctoscopy and anorectal biopsy', 'Referral to home health care service']\",\"['Docusate (Colace)', 'Hydrocortisone Topical', 'Polyethylene Glycol 3350 (Miralax)', 'Psyllium', 'Magnesium Sulfate', 'Sodium Citrate', 'Pramoxine Topical', 'Methylcellulose (Citrucel)', 'Glycerin (Fleet)', 'Terbinafine Topical', 'Emtricitabine-Tenofovir']\"\r\n191,Allergy,\"['Skin rash', 'Allergic reaction', 'Itching of skin', 'Peripheral edema', 'Abnormal appearing skin', 'Cough', 'Swollen eye', 'Lip swelling', 'Skin swelling', 'Itchiness of eye', 'Fluid retention', 'Swollen tongue']\",\"An allergy is a hypersensitivity disorder of the immune system. Allergic reactions occur when a person\\'s immune system reacts to normally harmless substances in the environment. A substance that causes a reaction is called an allergen. These reactions are acquired, predictable, and rapid. Allergy is one of four forms of hypersensitivity and is formally called type I (or immediate) hypersensitivity. Allergic reactions are distinctive because of excessive activation of certain white blood cells called mast cells and basophils by a type of antibody called Immunoglobulin E (IgE). This reaction results in an inflammatory response which can range from uncomfortable to dangerous. \",\"['Complete physical skin exam performed (ML)', 'Nebulizer therapy', 'Other diagnostic procedures on skin and subcutaneous tissue']\",\"['Diphenhydramine (Benadryl)', 'Prednisone', 'Methylprednisolone (Medrol)', 'Famotidine', 'Hydroxyzine', 'Epinephrine', 'Cetirizine (Zyrtec)', 'Prednisolone', 'Cimetidine', 'Levocetirizine (Xyzal)', 'Colloidal Oatmeal Topical', 'Calamine Topical']\"\r\n192,Chronic otitis media,\"['Redness in ear', 'Ear pain', 'Nasal congestion', 'Cough', 'Diminished hearing', 'Fever', 'Fluid in ear', 'Plugged feeling in ear', 'Pulling at ears', 'Allergic reaction', 'Painful sinuses', 'Bleeding from ear']\",\" cefdinir, \",\"['Ophthalmologic and otologic diagnosis and treatment', 'Other diagnostic procedures (interview; evaluation; consultation)', 'Excision (Removal)', 'Tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy', 'Diagnostic procedures on ear', 'Other OR therapeutic procedures on nose; mouth and pharynx', 'Diagnostic procedures on nose; mouth and pharynx']\",\"['Ofloxacin', 'Cefdinir', 'Sevoflurane', 'Nitrofurazone Topical', 'Cefixime (Suprax)', 'Phenol Topical', 'Cefprozil', 'Fluticasone', 'Molindone (Moban)', 'Phenylephrine Nasal']\"\r\n193,Fracture of the finger,\"['Hand or finger pain', 'Foot or toe pain', 'Hand or finger swelling', 'Foot or toe swelling', 'Hand or finger stiffness or tightness']\",\" nitrous oxide, \",\"['Radiographic imaging procedure', 'Plain x-ray (X ray)', 'Application of splint (Splinting)', 'Wound care management', 'Suturing of wound', 'Traction; splints; and other wound care', 'Physical therapy exercises (Exercises)']\",\"['Cefazolin', 'Nitrous Oxide', 'Lidocaine Topical Product', 'Isoflurane (Terrell)', 'Potassium Perchlorate', 'Lecithin', 'Ephedrine (Kie)']\"\r\n194,Hirschsprung disease,\"['Constipation', 'Ankle pain', 'Vomiting', 'Sharp abdominal pain', 'Wrist weakness', 'Elbow weakness', 'Eye strain', 'Feeling hot and cold', 'Nailbiting', 'Low back weakness', 'Emotional symptoms', 'Underweight']\",\"Hirschsprung\\'s disease (HD) is a disorder of the abdomen that occurs when part or all of the large intestine or antecedent parts of the gastrointestinal tract have no nerves and therefore cannot function. During normal fetal development, cells from the neural crest migrate into the large intestine (colon) to form the networks of nerves called Auerbach\\'s plexus and Meissner\\'s plexus. In Hirschprung\\'s disease, the migration is not complete and part of the colon lacks these nerve bodies that regulate the activity of the colon. The affected segment of the colon cannot contract and therefore pass stool through the colon, creating an obstruction. In most affected people, the disorder affects the part of the colon that is nearest the anus. In rare cases, the lack of nerve bodies involves more of the colon. In five percent of cases, the entire colon is affected. Stomach and esophagus may be affected too.

When veins become varicose, the leaflets of the valves no longer meet properly, and the valves do not work (valvular incompetence). This allows blood to flow backwards and they enlarge even more.

Symptoms of PKD include Pain in the back and lower sides Headaches Urinary tract infections Blood in the urine Doctors diagnose PKD with imaging tests and family history. Treatments include medications, and, when people with PKD develop kidney failure, dialysis or kidney transplants. Acquired cystic kidney disease (ACKD) usually happens in people who are on dialysis. Unlike PKD, the kidneys are normal sized, and cysts do not form in other parts of the body. People with ACKD already have chronic kidney disease when they develop cysts. ACKD often has no symptoms.

It is a type of electrolyte disturbance. In the blood, about half of all calcium is bound to proteins such as serum albumin, but it is the unbound, or ionized, calcium that the body regulates. If a person has abnormal levels of blood proteins, then the plasma calcium may be inaccurate. The ionized calcium level is considered more clinically accurate in this case. In the setting of low serum albumin (frequently seen in patients with chronic diseases, hepatic disease or even long term hospitalization), the formula for corrected calcium is: Corrected calcium (mg/dL) = measured total Ca (mg/dL) + 0.8 (4.0 - serum albumin ), where 4.0 represents the average albumin level in g/dL; in SI units: Corrected calcium (mmol/L) = measured total Ca (mmol/L) + 0.02 (40 - serum albumin ), where 40 represents the average albumin level in g/L.

The first rib is rarely fractured because of its protected position behind the clavicle (collarbone). However, if it is broken, serious damage can occur to the brachial plexus of nerves and the subclavian vessels. Fractures of the first and second ribs may be more likely to be associated with head and facial injuries than other rib fractures. The middle ribs are the ones most commonly fractured. Fractures usually occur from direct blows or from indirect crushing injuries. The weakest part of a rib is just anterior to its angle, but a fracture can occur anywhere. The most commonly fractured ribs are the 7th and 10th. A lower rib fracture has the complication of potentially injuring the diaphragm, which could result in a diaphragmatic hernia. Rib fractures are usually quite painful because the ribs have to move to allow for breathing. When several ribs are broken in several places a flail chest results, and the detached bone sections will move separately from the rest of the chest. \",\"['Radiographic imaging procedure', 'Plain x-ray (X ray)', 'Complete blood count (Cbc)', 'X-ray computed tomography (Scan ct)', 'Intravenous fluid replacement', 'Urinalysis', 'Kidney function tests (Kidney function test)']\",\"['Esmolol', 'Hydrocodone-Potassium Guaiacolsulfonate', 'Dobutamine', 'Entacapone (Comtan)', 'Caffeine', 'Methyl Salicylate-Menthol Topical', 'Norepinephrine', 'Peri-Colace', 'Vecuronium']\"\r\n295,Ependymoma,\"['Diminished vision', 'Pain in eye', 'Headache', 'Eyelid swelling', 'Symptoms of eye', 'Abnormal appearing skin', 'Eye redness', 'Emotional symptoms', 'Elbow cramps or spasms', 'Pus in sputum', 'Elbow weakness', 'Muscle swelling']\",\"Ependymoma is a tumor that arises from the ependyma, a tissue of the central nervous system.

If demineralization exceeds saliva and other remineralization factors such as from calcium and fluoridated toothpastes, these hard tissues progressively break down, producing dental caries (cavities, holes in the teeth). The bacteria most responsible for dental cavities are the mutans streptococci, most prominently Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus, and lactobacilli. If left untreated, the disease can lead to pain, tooth loss and infection. Today, caries remain one of the most common diseases throughout the world.

Head and neck cancers often spread to the lymph nodes of the neck, and this is often the first (and sometimes only) sign of the disease at the time of diagnosis. Head and neck cancer is strongly associated with certain environmental and lifestyle risk factors, including tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, UV light, particular chemicals used in certain workplaces, and certain strains of viruses, such as human papillomavirus. These cancers are frequently aggressive in their biologic behavior; patients with these types of cancer are at a higher risk of developing another cancer in the head and neck area. Head and neck cancer is highly curable if detected early, usually with some form of surgery, but radiation therapy may also play an important role, while chemotherapy is often ineffective.

However, since high blood pressure is a risk factor for atherosclerosis and ischemic heart disease, death rates from hypertensive heart disease provide an incomplete measure of the burden of disease due to high blood pressure. \",\"['Hematologic tests (Blood test)', 'Complete blood count (Cbc)', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Glucose measurement (Glucose level)', 'Lipid panel', 'Ultrasonography (Ultrasound)', 'Complete physical skin exam performed (ML)']\",\"['Amlodipine', 'Carvedilol', 'Isosorbide', 'Rosuvastatin (Crestor)', 'Valsartan (Diovan)', 'Digoxin', 'Diltiazem', 'Spironolactone', 'Benazepril', 'Hydralazine', 'Torsemide']\"\r\n348,Drug abuse (barbiturates),\"['Drug abuse', 'Abusing alcohol', 'Anxiety and nervousness', 'Depression', 'Depressive or psychotic symptoms', 'Abnormal involuntary movements', 'Delusions or hallucinations', 'Slurring words', 'Excessive anger', 'Hostile behavior']\",\" quetiapine (seroquel), \",\"['Mental health counseling', 'Psychotherapy', 'Urinalysis', 'Blood alcohol', 'Toxicology screen', 'Psychological and psychiatric evaluation and therapy', 'Depression screen (Depression screening)']\",\"['Bupropion (Wellbutrin)', 'Quetiapine (Seroquel)', 'Trazodone', 'Clonazepam', 'Duloxetine (Cymbalta)', 'Methadone', 'Benztropine', 'Mirtazapine', 'Thiamine', 'Chloral Hydrate', 'Acamprosate (Campral)']\"\r\n349,Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS),\"['Infertility', 'Unpredictable menstruation', 'Weight gain', 'Pelvic pain', 'Absence of menstruation', 'Heavy menstrual flow', 'Intermenstrual bleeding', 'Long menstrual periods', 'Painful menstruation', 'Cramps and spasms', 'Hot flashes', 'Acne or pimples']\",\"A complex disorder characterized by infertility, HIRSUTISM; OBESITY; and various menstrual disturbances such as OLIGOMENORRHEA; AMENORRHEA; ANOVULATION.

The expected, maximum, and minimum amplitudes of accommodation for a corrected patient of a given age can be determined using Hofstetter\\'s formulas: Expected amplitude (D) = 18.5 - 0.3 x (age in years), Maximum amplitude (D) = 25 - 0.4 x (age in years), Minimum amplitude (D) = 15 - 0.25 x (age in years). \",\"['Ophthalmologic and otologic diagnosis and treatment', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation (Eye exam)', 'Other therapeutic procedures on eyelids; conjunctiva; cornea', 'Lens and cataract procedures']\",\"['Tropicamide Ophthalmic', 'Phenylephrine (Duramax)', 'Prednisolone Ophthalmic', 'Fluorescein', 'Olopatadine Ophthalmic', 'Ketotifen Ophthalmic', 'Nepafenac Ophthalmic', 'Cyclosporine Ophthalmic', 'Proparacaine Ophthalmic', 'Emtricitabine-Tenofovir', 'Tipranavir', 'Rimexolone Ophthalmic']\"\r\n454,Dementia,\"['Disturbance of memory', 'Problems with movement', 'Dizziness', 'Depressive or psychotic symptoms', 'Abnormal involuntary movements', 'Paresthesia', 'Hostile behavior', 'Delusions or hallucinations', 'Difficulty speaking', 'Insomnia', 'Disturbance of smell or taste', 'Focal weakness']\",\"Dementia (taken from Latin, originally meaning \"\"madness\"\", from de- \"\"without\"\" + ment, the root of mens \"\"mind\"\") is a serious loss of global cognitive ability in a previously unimpaired person, beyond what might be expected from normal ageing. It may be static, the result of a unique global brain injury, or progressive, resulting in long-term decline due to damage or disease in the body. Although dementia is far more common in the geriatric population, it can occur before the age of 65, in which case it is termed \"\"early onset dementia\"\". \",\"['Electrocardiogram', 'X-ray computed tomography (Scan ct)', 'Mental health counseling', 'Lipid panel', 'Physical therapy exercises (Exercises)', 'Occupational therapy assessment (Speech therapy)', 'CAT scan of head (Head ct)']\",\"['Donepezil (Aricept)', 'Memantine (Namenda)', 'Rivastigmine (Exelon)', 'Galantamine', 'Mirtazapine', 'Thiamine', 'Pramipexole (Mirapex)', 'Felodipine', 'Bisacodyl (The Magic Bullet)', 'Modafinil (Provigil)', 'Raloxifene (Evista)']\"\r\n455,Insect bite,\"['Skin rash', 'Abnormal appearing skin', 'Itching of skin', 'Skin swelling', 'Skin lesion', 'Peripheral edema', 'Hand or finger swelling', 'Arm swelling', 'Leg swelling', 'Swollen eye', 'Fluid retention', 'Lip swelling']\",\"Insect bites and stings occur when an insect is agitated and seeks to defend itself through its natural defense mechanisms, or when an insect seeks to feed off the bitten person. Some insects inject formic acid, which can cause an immediate skin reaction often resulting in redness and swelling in the injured area. Stings from fire ants, bees, wasps and hornets are usually painful, and may stimulate a dangerous allergic reaction called anaphylaxis for at-risk patients, and some wasps can also have a powerful bite along with a sting. Bites from mosquitoes and fleas are more likely to cause itching than pain. \",\"['Complete physical skin exam performed (ML)', 'Wound care management', 'Culture wound', 'Incision and drainage (I d)', 'Nonoperative removal of foreign body']\",\"['Diphenhydramine (Benadryl)', 'Hydrocortisone Topical', 'Doxycycline', 'Mupirocin Topical', 'Permethrin Topical', 'Calamine Topical', 'Colloidal Oatmeal Topical', 'Trimethoprim', 'Desoximetasone Topical', 'Calamine-Pramoxine Topical']\"\r\n456,Paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia,\"['Shortness of breath', 'Sharp chest pain', 'Dizziness',"
