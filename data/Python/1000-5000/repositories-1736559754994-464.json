          "content": "# Code of Conduct\n\nDiversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to communication issues. To support a welcoming environment\nfor all, regardless of individual differences, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to when they\nparticipate in this community. These rules apply equally to founders, organizers, contributors, users and affiliates —\nin short, to all participants.\n\nThis isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you must do, or can’t do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it’s\nintended. It’s a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate, and\nwhich we represent.\n\n## Our Pledge\n\nWe as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for\neveryone, regardless of background or identity. This includes, but is not limited to, members of any race, ethnicity,\nculture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual\norientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, level of experience,\nand mental or physical ability.\n\nWe pledge to be respectful. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and\npoor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a\npersonal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a\nproductive one. Members of the PyQtGraph community should be respectful when dealing with each other as well as with\npeople outside the community.\n\nWe pledge to be welcoming, supportive, kind and professional. We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to\nan open, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community. We pledge not insult or put down other participants, individually or\nas a group. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren’t acceptable.\n\n## Examples\n\nExamples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:\n\n* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people\n* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences\n* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback\n* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience\n* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community\n\nExamples of unacceptable behavior include:\n\n* Violent threats or language directed against another person.\n* Discriminatory jokes and language.\n* Posting sexually explicit or violent material.\n* Posting (or threatening to post) other people’s personally identifying information (\"doxing\").\n* Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.\n* Unwelcome sexual attention.\n* Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.\n* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.\n\n## Where does this code of conduct apply\n\nThis Code of Conduct applies within all online community spaces, official organized meetups, and when an individual is\nofficially representing the community in public spaces, online or offline.\n\n## What to do in case of violations\n\nIf you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by contacting any of the following\nindividuals, being sure to include mention of your message being about a \"PyQtGraph conduct violation\":\n\n* Ognyan Moore @j9ac9k <ognyan.moore@gmail.com>\n* Martin Chase @outofculture <outofculture@gmail.com>\n* Nathan Jessurun @ntjess <ntjessu@gmail.com>\n\nAll complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All reports will be kept confidential. In some\ncases, we may determine that a public statement will need to be made. If that’s the case, the identities of all victims\nand reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.\n\nIf you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify appropriate law enforcement first. If you are unsure which\nlaw enforcement agency is appropriate, please include this in your report and we will attempt to notify them.\n\n### What to include in the report\n\n* Your contact information (so we can get in touch with you if we need to follow up)\n* Names of any individuals involved (real names, nicknames, or pseudonyms). If there were other witnesses besides you,\n  please try to include them as well.\n* When and where the incident occurred. Please be as specific as possible.\n* Your account of what occurred. If there is a publicly available record (e.g., a mailing list archive or a public chat\n  logger) please include a link. Our Slack is currently on a free plan that does not retain more than 10,000 messages of\n  history, if an incident occurred on Slack please take a screenshot so it is not lost.\n* Any extra context you believe existed for the incident.\n* Whether you believe this incident is ongoing.\n* Any other information you believe we should have.\n\n## Enforcement Responsibilities\n\nCommunity leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take\nappropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,\nor harmful.\n\nCommunity leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits,\nissues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for\nmoderation decisions when appropriate. This removal should be as transparent as possible, with information available in\nthe same scope of context as the original moderated content, linking to an incident report, the acting moderators,\nand/or this document as appropriate.\n\nAll community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.\n\nUpon receiving a report of misconduct, the staff must review the incident and determine the following:\n\n* What happened.\n* Whether this event constitutes a code of conduct violation.\n* Who the bad actor(s) was.\n* Whether this is an ongoing situation.\n* If any previous disiplinary measures are relevent and in effect.\n* If there is a threat to anyone’s physical safety.\n* What impact this has had on the community.\n\nAfter the conduct committee has a complete account of the events they need to make a decision as to how to resolve the\ncase. Resolutions might include:\n\n* Nothing (if we determine no violation occurred).\n* A private reprimand from the staff to the individual(s) involved, providing clarity around the nature of the\n  violation, and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate.\n* A request for a public or private apology.\n* A public reprimand.\n* An imposed vacation (for example, asking someone to \"take a week off\" from Slack).\n* A permanent or temporary ban from some or all PyQtGraph spaces (Slack, github, mailing list or events) or from\n  communicating, in public or in private, with some are all of the members of our community.\n* Contacting law enforcement.\n\nA response must be sent within one week to the person who filed the report with either a resolution or an explanation of\nwhy the situation is not yet resolved.\n\nA Code of Conduct transparency report will then be published\nto [the PyQtGraph users' list](https://groups.google.com/g/pyqtgraph) with anonymized information about any violations\nthat might have occurred. This report should be handled with care not to divulge personally identifying information\nabout victims, reporters, and violators, and should serve as a means to ensure that members will be comfortable\nreporting violations and that our community will be kept accountable for supporting and encouraging safe spaces.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from\nthe [Contributor Covenant, version 2.0](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html) and\nthe [PuPPy Code of Conduct](https://www.pspython.com/pages/code-of-conduct/).\n"

          "content": "# Contributing to PyQtGraph\n\nContributions to pyqtgraph are welcome! Be kind and respectful! See\n[our Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for details.\n\nPlease use the following guidelines when preparing changes:\n\n## Development Environment Creation\n\nFirst thing to do is fork the repository, and clone your own fork to your local\ncomputer.\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/<username>/pyqtgraph.git\ncd pyqtgraph\n```\n\nWhile there is nothing preventing users from using `conda` environments, as a general\nprinciple, we recommend using the `venv` module for creating an otherwise empty virtual\nenvironment.\n\n```bash\npython3.12 -m venv .venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate\n# on windows this would be .venv/Scripts/activate\npython -m pip install numpy scipy pyqt6 -e .\n```\n\nPyQtGraph supports PySide2, PyQt5, PySide6 and PyQt6 bindings, but if a contributor is\nto test against only one set of bindings, we suggest that it be PyQt6.  PyQt6 is the\nonly bindings that enforces the use of fully scoped enums. For example, apart from PyQt6, `QGraphicsItem.ItemIgnoresTransformations` would be recognized, but that would error in PyQt6. The cross-binding compatible reference to that enum would be\n`QGraphicsItem.GraphicsItemFlags.ItemIgnoresTransformations`.\n\nBefore making changes to the code-base, create a different branch with a name that\nshould be unique (this makes it easier for maintainers to examine the proposed changes\nlocally).\n\n```bash\ngit switch -c my-new-feature\n```\n\nThe target of the pull request should be the `master` branch in the pyqtgraph repo.\nPull requests should include only a focused and related set of changes. Mixed features and unrelated changes may be rejected.\n\nFor major changes, it is recommended to discuss your plans on the mailing list or in a\ngithub issue/discussion before putting in too much effort.\n\nPyQtGraph has adopted [NEP-29](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html)\nwhich governs the timeline for phasing out support for numpy and python versions.\n\n## Documentation\n\n* Writing proper documentation is highly encouraged.\n* Documentation is generated with sphinx, and usage of\n  [numpy-docstyle](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) is encouraged\n  (many places in the library do not use this docstring style at present, it's a gradual\n  process to migrate).\n* The docs built for this PR can be previewed by clicking on the \"Details\" link for the\n  read-the-docs entry in the checks section of the PR conversation page.\n\nTo build the documentation locally, users will need to install\n[graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) in such a way that the `dot` executable is in the\nusers's `PATH`.\n\n```bash\npip install -r doc/requirements.txt \n```\n\n```bash\ncd doc\nmake html\n```\n\nTo view the result, from the `./doc` directory, open `./build/html/index.html` in a web\nbrowser.\n\nTo validate the documentation against numpydoc, a fork of numpydoc needs to be installed\n\n```bash\npip install git+https://github.com/j9ac9k/numpydoc.git@see-more-accepts-sphinx-crosslinks\n```\n\nTo verify your documentation changes conform to numpydoc, run:\n\n```bash\nnumpydoc lint path/to/file.py\n```\n\nEvery reasonable effort should be made to address the issues the linter outputs.\n\n## Style guidelines\n\n### Formatting ~~Rules~~ Suggestions\n\n* PyQtGraph prefers PEP8 for most style issues, but this is not enforced rigorously as\n  long as the code is clean and readable.\n* Variable and Function/Methods that are intended to be part of the public API should be\n  camelCase.\n* \"Private\" methods/variables should have a leading underscore (`_`) before the name.\n\n### Pre-Commit\n\nPyQtGraph developers are highly encouraged to (but not required) to use\n[`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/).  `pre-commit` does a number of checks when\nattempting to commit the code to being committed, such as ensuring no large files are\naccidentally added, address mixed-line-endings types and so on.  Check the\n[pre-commit documentation](https://pre-commit.com) on how to setup.\n\n## Testing\n\n### Basic Setup\n\n* pytest\n* Optional: pytest-qt    (used to check PyQt warnings)\n* Optional: pytest-xdist (used to run tests in parallel)\n* Optional: pytest-xvfb  (used on linux with headless displays)\n\nTo run the test suite, after installing the above dependencies run\n\n```bash\npytest tests\n```\n\nIn addition, the examples can be tested as well.  \n\n```bash\npytest pyqtgraph/examples\n```\n\nThe examples will each run for 1 second, and automatically close. If no unhandled\nexception is created, it's considered a success.\n\n### Tox\n\nAs PyQtGraph supports a wide array of Qt-bindings, and python versions, we make use of\n`tox` to test against as many supported configurations as feasible.  With tox installed,\nsimply run `tox` and it will run through all the configurations.  This should be done if\nthere is uncertainty regarding changes working on specific combinations of PyQt bindings\nand/or python versions.\n\n### Continuous Integration\n\nFor our Continuous Integration, pyqtgraph tests across all OSs for a variety of\ncombinations of supported Qt bindings, python and numpy versions. For submitted changes\nto be merged, it is expected that the CI passes.\n\n### Benchmarks\n\n( *Still under development* ) To ensure this library is performant, we use\n[Air Speed Velocity (asv)](https://asv.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to run benchmarks. For\ndeveloping on core functions and classes, be aware of any impact your changes have on\ntheir speed. To configure and run asv:\n\n```bash\npip install asv\npython setup.py asv_config\nasv run\n```\n\n( TODO publish results )\n"
