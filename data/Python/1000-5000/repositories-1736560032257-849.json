Install from PyPI\nFor stable release,\n```\npip install pytorchvideo\n=======\nconda create -n pytorchvideo python=3.7\nconda activate pytorchvideo\nconda install -c pytorch pytorch=1.8.0 torchvision cudatoolkit=10.2\nconda install -c conda-forge -c fvcore -c iopath fvcore=0.1.4 iopath\n```\n\nFor nightly builds,\n```\npip install pytorchvideo-nightly\n```\n\n### 2. Install from GitHub using pip\n```\npip install \"git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorchvideo.git\"\n```\nTo install using the code of the released version instead of from the main branch, use the following instead.\n```\npip install \"git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorchvideo.git@stable\"\n```\n\n### 3. Install from a local clone\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorchvideo.git\ncd pytorchvideo\npip install -e .\n\n# For developing and testing\npip install -e . [test,dev]\n```\n\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Core library\n\n- Python 3.7 or 3.8 \n- PyTorch 1.8.0 or higher.\n- torchvision that matches the PyTorch installation. You can install them together as explained at pytorch.org to make sure of this.\n- [fvcore](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fvcore) version 0.1.4 or higher\n- [ioPath](https://github.com/facebookresearch/iopath)\n- If CUDA is to be used, use a version which is supported by the corresponding pytorch version and at least version 10.2 or higher.\n\nWe recommend setting up a conda environment with Pytorch and Torchvision before installing PyTorchVideo.\nFor instance, follow the bellow instructions to setup the conda environment,\n```\nconda create -n pytorchvideo python=3.7\nconda activate pytorchvideo\nconda install -c pytorch pytorch=1.8.0 torchvision cudatoolkit=10.2\n```\n\n## Testing\n\nPlease follow the instructions mentioned in [test-README](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorchvideo/blob/main/tests/README.md) to run the provided tests.\n\n## Linting\n\nWe also provide a linting script to correctly format your code edits.\nPlease follow the instructions mentioned in [dev-README](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorchvideo/blob/main/dev/README.md) to run the linter.\n"

See demo: [![Hugging Face Spaces](https://img.shields.io/badge/%F0%9F%A4%97%20Hugging%20Face-Spaces-blue)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/pytorch/X3D)\n\n## Introduction\n\nPyTorchVideo is a deeplearning library with a focus on video understanding work. PytorchVideo provides reusable, modular and efficient components needed to accelerate the video understanding research. PyTorchVideo is developed using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) and supports different deeplearning video components like video models, video datasets, and video-specific transforms.\n\nKey features include:\n\n- **Based on PyTorch:** Built using PyTorch. Makes it easy to use all of the PyTorch-ecosystem components.\n- **Reproducible Model Zoo:** Variety of state of the art pretrained video models and their associated benchmarks that are ready to use.\n  Complementing the model zoo, PyTorchVideo comes with extensive data loaders supporting different datasets.\n- **Efficient Video Components:** Video-focused fast and efficient components that are easy to use. Supports accelerated inference on hardware.\n\n## Updates\n\n- Aug 2021: [Multiscale Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.11227) has been released in PyTorchVideo, details can be found from [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorchvideo/blob/main/pytorchvideo/models/vision_transformers.py#L97).\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall PyTorchVideo inside a conda environment(Python >=3.7) with\n```shell\npip install pytorchvideo\n```\n\nFor detailed instructions please refer to [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).\n\n## License\n\nPyTorchVideo is released under the [Apache 2.0 License](LICENSE).\n\n## Tutorials\n\nGet started with PyTorchVideo by trying out one of our [tutorials](https://pytorchvideo.org/docs/tutorial_overview) or by running examples in the [tutorials folder](./tutorials).\n\n\n## Model Zoo and Baselines\nWe provide a large set of baseline results and trained models available for download in the [PyTorchVideo Model Zoo](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorchvideo/blob/main/docs/source/model_zoo.md).\n\n## Contributors\n\nHere is the growing list of PyTorchVideo contributors in alphabetical order (let us know if you would like to be added):\n[Aaron Adcock](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaron-adcock-79855383/), [Amy Bearman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amy-bearman/), [Bernard Nguyen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrbernardnguyen/), [Bo Xiong](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~bxiong/), [Chengyuan Yan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chengyuan-yan-4a804282/), [Christoph Feichtenhofer](https://feichtenhofer.github.io/), [Dave Schnizlein](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-schnizlein-96020136/), [Haoqi Fan](https://haoqifan.github.io/), [Heng Wang](https://hengcv.github.io/), [Jackson Hamburger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jackson-hamburger-986a2873/), [Jitendra Malik](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~malik/), [Kalyan Vasudev Alwala](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kalyan-vasudev-alwala-2a802b64/), [Matt Feiszli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-feiszli-76b34b/), [Nikhila Ravi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikhilaravi/), [Ross Girshick](https://www.rossgirshick.info/), [Tullie Murrell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tullie/), [Wan-Yen Lo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wanyenlo/), [Weiyao Wang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/weiyaowang/?locale=en_US), [Xiaowen Lin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xiaowen-lin-90542b34/), [Yanghao Li](https://lyttonhao.github.io/), [Yilei Li](https://liyilui.github.io/personal_page/), [Zhengxing Chen](http://czxttkl.github.io/), [Zhicheng Yan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhichengyan/).\n\n\n## Development\n\nWe welcome new contributions to PyTorchVideo and we will be actively maintaining this library!
