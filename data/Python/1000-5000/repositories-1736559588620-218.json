These are a great starting point if you want to contribute. Don't hesitate to ask questions in the Amundsen Slack channel about the issue if you are not sure about the strategy to follow.\n\n## Reporting an Issue\n\nThe easiest way you can contribute to Amundsen is by creating issues. First, search the [issues][issues] section of the Amundsen repository in case a similar bug or feature request already exists. If you don't find it, submit your bug, question, proposal or feature request. They will remain closed until sufficient interest, e.g. 👍 reactions, has been shown by the community.\n\n## Creating Pull Requests\n\nBefore sending a pull request with significant changes, please use the [issue tracker][issues] to discuss the potential improvements you want to make. This can help us send you to a solution, a workaround, or an RFC (request for comments item in our [RFC repo][requestforcomments]).\n\n## Requesting a Feature\n\nWe have created a [community roadmap][communityroadmap] where you can vote on plans for next releases. However, we are open to hearing your ideas for new features!\n\nFor that, you can create an issue and select the \"Feature Proposal\" template. Fill in as much information as possible, and if you can, add responses to the following questions:\n\n- Will we need to add a new model or change any existing model?\n- What would the migration plan look like? Will it be backwards-compatible?\n- Which alternatives did you consider?\n\n## Setup\n\nTo start contributing to Amundsen, you need to set up your machine to develop with the project. For that, we have prepared a [developer guide][developerguide] that will guide you to set up your environment to develop locally with Amundsen.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nOnce you have your environment set and ready to go, you can check our [documentation][documentationhomepage] and the project's [community roadmap][communityroadmap] to see what's coming.\n\n[issues]: https://github.com/amundsen-io/amundsen/issues\n[contributiontutorial]: https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions#first-contributions\n[contributionvideos]: https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github\n[goodfirstissues]: https://github.com/amundsen-io/amundsen/issues?q=label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+-label%3Anot%22status%3Acompleted%22+\n[helpwantedissues]: https://github.com/amundsen-io/amundsen/issues?q=label%3A%22help+wanted%22++-label%3Anot%22status%3Acompleted%22+\n[developerguide]: https://www.amundsen.io/amundsen/developer_guide/\n[communityroadmap]: https://github.com/amundsen-io/amundsen#community-roadmap\n[documentationhomepage]: https://www.amundsen.io/amundsen/\n[requestforcomments]: https://github.com/amundsen-io/rfcs\n"

          "content": "# Governance\n\nAt Amundsen, we want to produce an environment of fairness that people can rely on. A formal governance structure helps us resolve debates, invite in (or out) new developers and plan new features.\n\nWith the following governance system, we want to facilitate project permanence, supporting it with healthy habits and processes that are well understood by everyone.\n\n## Amundsen Governance Model\n\nAmundsen is a meritocratic, consensus-based community project. Anyone interested in the project can join the community, contribute to the project design, and participate in the decision-making process. This document describes how that participation occurs and how to set about earning merit within the project community.\n\n## Roles And Responsibilities\n\n### Users\n\nUsers are community members who need the data discovery features of Amundsen. They are the most important community members, and without them, the project would have no purpose. Anyone can be a user; there are no special requirements.\n\nAmundsen asks its users to participate in the project and community as much as possible. User contributions enable the project team to ensure that they satisfy the needs of those users. Frequent user contributions include (but are not limited to):\n\n- Evangelizing about the project (e.g., a link on a website and word-of-mouth awareness raising)\n- Informing developers of strengths and weaknesses from a new user perspective\n- Providing moral support (a ‘thank you’ goes a long way)\n- Providing financial support (the software is open source, but its developers need to eat)\n\nUsers who continue to engage with the project and its community will often become more and more involved. Such users may find themselves becoming contributors, as described in the next section.\n\n### Contributors\n\nContributors are community members who contribute in concrete ways to the project. Anyone can become a contributor, and contributions can take many forms. There is no expectation of commitment to the project, no specific skill requirements, and no selection process.\n\nIn addition to their actions as users, contributors may also find themselves doing one or more of the following:\n\n- Supporting new users (existing users are often the best people to help new users)\n- Creating, triaging or commenting on Issues\n- Doing code reviews or commenting on technical documents\n- Writing, editing, translating or reviewing the documentation\n- Organizing events or evangelizing the project\n\nContributors engage with the project through the issue tracker and slack community, or by writing or editing documentation. They submit changes to the project itself via Pull Requests (PRs), which will be considered for inclusion in the project by existing maintainers (see next section). Contributors follow the [Contributing guide](https://www.amundsen.io/amundsen/CONTRIBUTING/) when creating PRs.\n\nAs contributors gain experience and familiarity with the project, their profile and commitment within the community will increase. At some stage, they may find themselves being nominated for being a maintainer.\n\n### Maintainers\n\nMaintainers are community members who have shown that they are committed to Amundsen’s continued development through ongoing engagement with the community. Because of this, maintainers have the right to merge PRs and triage issues.\n\nNote that any change to resources in Amundsen must be through pull requests. This applies to all changes to documentation, code, configuration, etc. Even maintainers must use pull requests, as they are key to provide transparency and attract new contributors to the project. Additionally, no pull request can be merged without being reviewed.\n\nAnyone can become a maintainer. Typically, a potential maintainer will need to show that they understand the project, its objectives, and its strategy. They will also have provided valuable contributions to the project over a period of time. Read the sections below to know how to become an Amundsen maintainer.\n\n## Becoming a Maintainer\n\nAny existing maintainer can nominate new maintainers. Once they have been nominated, there will be a vote by the rest of the maintainers. Maintainer voting is one of the few activities that take place on a private channel. This is to allow maintainers to express their opinions about a nominee without causing embarrassment freely. The approval requires **three maintainers +1 vote** and **no -1 vote**.\n\nOnce the vote has been held, the aggregated voting results are published on the #amundsen channel. The nominee is entitled to request an explanation of any ‘no’ votes against them, regardless of the vote's outcome. This explanation will be provided by the maintainers and will be anonymous and constructive.\n\nNominees may decline their appointment as a maintainer. Becoming a maintainer means that they will be spending a substantial time working on Amundsen for the foreseeable future. It is essential to recognize that being a maintainer is a privilege, not a right. That privilege must be earned, and once earned, the rest of the maintainers can remove it in extreme circumstances.\n\n### Earning a Nomination\n\nThere is not a single path of earning a nomination for maintainer at Amundsen, however, we can give some guidance about some actions that would help:\n\n- Start by expressing interest to the maintainers that you are interested in becoming a maintainer.\n- You can start tackling issues labeled as [‘help wanted’](https://github.com/amundsen-io/amundsen/labels/help%20wanted), or if you are new to the project, some of the [‘good first issue’](https://github.com/amundsen-io/amundsen/labels/good%20first%20issue) tickets.\n- As you gain experience with the codebase and our standards, we will ask you to do code reviews for incoming PRs (i.e., all maintainers are expected to shoulder a proportional share of community reviews).\n- We will expect you to start contributing increasingly complicated PRs, under the guidance of the existing maintainers.\n- After approximately 2-3 months of working together, an existing maintainer will be able to nominate you for maintainer status.\n\nWe make no guarantees on the length of time this will take, but 2-3 months is the approximate goal.\n\n### Maintainer Responsibilities\n\nThe project maintainers are those individuals identified as ‘project owners’ on the development site. Maintainers have many responsibilities, which ensure the smooth running of the project. Among them, we can name:\n\n- Monitor email aliases and our Slack (delayed response is perfectly acceptable).\n- Perform code reviews for other maintainers and the community. The areas of specialization listed in [OWNERS.md](OWNERS.md) can be used to help with routing an issue/question to the right person.\n- Triage GitHub issues, applying [labels](https://github.com/amundsen-io/amundsen/labels) to each new item. Labels are extremely useful for future issue follow ups. Adding labels is somewhat subjective, so please use your best judgment. Read more about our labels on [this document](https://www.amundsen.io/amundsen/issue_labeling/).\n- Triage build issues, filing issues for known flaky builds or bugs, fixing or finding someone to fix any master build breakages.\n- Make sure that ongoing PRs are moving forward at the right pace or closing them.\n- Participate in strategic planning, approve changes to the governance model, and manage the copyrights within the project outputs.\n\n## Losing Maintainer Status\n\nIf a maintainer is no longer interested and cannot perform the maintainer duties listed above, they could volunteer to be moved to emeritus status. The maintainer status is attributed for life otherwise. An emeritus maintainer may request reinstatement of commit access from the rest of maintainers. Such reinstatement is subject to lazy consensus approval of active maintainers.\n\nIn extreme cases, maintainers can lose their status by a vote of the maintainers per the voting process below.\n\n## Decision Making Process\n\nDecisions about the future of Amundsen are made through discussion with all community members, from the newest user to the most experienced maintainer. All non-sensitive project management discussion takes place on the project issue tracker system. Occasionally, sensitive discussion occurs on a private channel of our Slack.\n\nTo ensure that the project is not bogged down by endless discussion and continual voting, the project operates a policy of lazy consensus. This allows the majority of decisions to be made without resorting to a formal vote.\n\n### Lazy consensus\n\nDecision making typically involves the following steps:\n\n- Proposal\n- Discussion\n- Vote (if consensus is not reached through discussion)\n- Decision\n\nAny community member can make a proposal for consideration by the community. To initiate a discussion about a new idea, they should create an issue or submit a PR implementing the idea to the issue tracker. This will prompt a review and, if necessary, a discussion of the idea. The goal of this review and discussion is to gain approval for the contribution. Since most people in the project community have a shared vision, there is often little discussion to reach consensus.\n\nIn general, as long as nobody explicitly opposes a proposal or PR, it is recognized as having the support of the community. This is called lazy consensus - that is, those who have not stated their opinion explicitly have implicitly agreed to the proposal's implementation.\n\nLazy consensus is a fundamental concept within the project. This process allows a large group of people to reach consensus efficiently as someone with no objections to a proposal need not spend time stating their position.\n\nFor lazy consensus to be effective, it is necessary to allow at least 48 hours before assuming that there are no objections to the proposal. This requirement ensures that everyone is given enough time to read, digest, and respond to the proposal. This time period is chosen to be as inclusive as possible of all participants, regardless of their location and time commitments.\n\n### Voting\n\nNot all decisions can be made using lazy consensus. Issues such as those affecting the strategic direction or legal standing of the project must gain explicit approval in the form of a vote. Every member of the community is encouraged to express their opinions in all discussions and all votes. However, only project maintainers have binding votes for the purposes of decision making.\n\n## Roadmap Creation\n\nOur [roadmap](https://www.amundsen.io/amundsen/roadmap/) gives an overview of what we are currently working on and what we want to tackle next. This helps potential contributors understand your project's current status and where it's going next, as well as giving a chance to be part of the planning.\n\nIn this section, we describe the process we follow to create it, using request for comments documents (RFCs).\n\n### RFCs Process\n\nMost of the issues we see can be handled with regular GitHub issues. However, some changes are \"substantial\", and we ask that these go through a design process and produce a consensus among the Amundsen community.\n\nThe \"RFC\" (request for comments) process is intended to provide a consistent and controlled path for new features to enter the roadmap. The high-level process looks like this:\n\n1. Contributor creates an RFC draft in the repository\n2. Users, Contributors, and Maintainers discuss and upvote the draft\n3. If confident on its success, contributor completes the RFC with more in-detail technical specifications\n4. Maintainers approve RFC when it is ready\n5. Maintainers meet every quarter and choose three or five items based on popularity and alignment with project vision and goals\n6. Those selected items become part of the Mid-term goals\n\n##### When to Use RFCs\n\nWhat constitutes a \"substantial\" change is evolving based on the community, but may include the following:\n\n- New features that require configuration options to activate/deactivate\n- Remove features\n- Architecture changes\n- Examples:\n  - Adding lineage features\n  - Dashboards integration\n\nSome changes do not require a RFC:\n\n- Reorganizing or refactoring code or documentation\n- Improvements that tackle objective quality criteria (speedup, better browser support)\n- Changes noticeable only by contributors or maintainers\n- Examples:\n  - Adding programmatic descriptions\n  - Adding support for tags at a column level\n\nIf you submit a pull request to implement a new feature without going through the RFC process, it may be closed with a polite request to submit an RFC first. That said, if most of the work is done, we'd accelerate the process.\n\nWe will keep our RFC documents in a separate repo on the Amundsen-io organization, where a detailed step by step process will be documented.\n\n## References\n\n- [Envoy’s Governance Document](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md)\n- [OSS Watch, Meritocratic Governance](http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/meritocraticgovernancemodel)\n- [The Apache Software Foundation meritocratic model](http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#meritocracy)\n- [Ember RFCs](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs)\n"

Most of the steps and guidelines in the [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) document apply here, including how to set up your environment, write code to fit the code style, run tests, craft commits and manage branches.\n\nBeyond this, this document provides some details that would be too low-level for contributors.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Communication](#communication)\n- [Managing the community](#managing-the-community)\n- [Issue management](#issue-management)\n- [Dev workflow](#dev-workflow)\n- [Architecture](#architecture)\n- [Updating the changelog](#updating-the-changelog)\n- [Documentation](#documentation)\n- [Adding new projects](#adding-new-projects)\n- [Related Documents](#related-documents)\n\n## Communication\n\nWe have several ways that we can communicate with each other:\n\n- To show our direction and next steps, the [**roadmap**][roadmap] is the best place.\n- To track progress on the movement of issues, [**labels**](#labels) are useful.\n- To learn about what the community has been working lately, our [community meeting] is a great event. It happens the first Thursday of every month at 9AM PST, and you can watch past meeting recordings [here][cmeetingrecordings]\n- To chat with the maintainers team, get support or connect with Amundsen's community, join our [Slack][slack]\n\n[roadmap]: https://www.amundsen.io/amundsen/roadmap/\n[cmeeting]: meet.google.com/mqz-ndck-jmj\n[cmeetingrecordings]: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgOyzG0sEoolxuC9YXDYPeg\n[slack]: amundsenworkspace.slack.com\n\n## Managing the community\n\nWe try to create and foster a community around Amundsen. We do this by:\n\n- Answering questions from members of the community\n- Triaging Github issues, adding the proper [labels][labels] to new tickets\n- Keeping the community informed by ensuring that we add communications regularly with the new features\n- Ensuring that the documentation, as well as the documentation site, is kept up to date\n- Doing code reviews for other maintainers and the community\n- Reviewing [RFCs][rfcs] and shaping the future of the project\n\n[labels]: https://github.com/amundsen-io/amundsen/labels\n[rfcs]: https://github.com/amundsen-io/rfcs\n\n\n## Issue management\n\nThe triage and issue managing process will look like this:\n\n1. New issues will automatically added the \"Status: Needs Triage\".\n2. Once maintainers review the issue, they will remove the \"Status: Needs Triage\" label, add new ones and close the issue.\n3. The Amundsen community will upvote the issues they want to be addressed by viewing the [features](https://github.com/amundsen-io/amundsen/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc+label%3Atype%3Afeature+) and [bug](https://github.com/amundsen-io/amundsen/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc+label%3Atype%3Abug+) lists and reacting with a 👍.\n4. Amundsen maintainers and community will tackle the features and bugs as they fit their roadmap and taking into account their popularity.\n\nWe've found labels to be useful for cataloging and marking progress on features and bugs. You can read about our labels on the [issue_labeling](https://www.amundsen.io/amundsen/issue_labeling/) document.\n\n\n## Dev workflow\n\nWe generally follow [GitHub Flow]. The `main` branch is the main line, and all\nbranches are cut from and get merged back into this branch. Generally, the\nworkflow is as follows:\n\n[github flow]: https://help.github.com/articles/github-flow/\n\n- Cut a feature or bugfix branch from this branch.\n- Upon completing a branch, create a PR and ask another maintainer to approve it.\n- Try to keep the commit history as clean as possible. Before merging, squash \"WIP\" or related commits together and rebase as needed.\n- Once your PR is approved, and you've cleaned up your branch, you're free to merge it in.\n\n## Architecture\n\nWe have covered Amundsen's architecture in our [docs](https://lyft.github.io/amundsen/architecture/).\n\n## Documentation\n\nWe use [mkdocs] for creating our documentation from Markdown files. This system is configured from the 'mkdocs.yml' file in the root of this repository.\n\nCurrently, our docs are built and deployed automatically with a GitHub action, so we shouldn't need to do anything.\n\n[mkdocs]: https://www.mkdocs.org/\n\n## Adding new projects\n\nTo add new projects to the amundsen-io organization, we will first discuss it through our [RFC process][rfc].\n\n[rfc]: https://github.com/amundsen-io/rfcs\n\n## Related Documents\n\n- [Contributing Guide](https://www.amundsen.io/amundsen/CONTRIBUTING/)\n- [Governance Document](https://github.com/amundsen-io/amundsen/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md)\n"

It does that today by indexing data resources (tables, dashboards, streams, etc.) and powering a page-rank style search based on usage patterns (e.g. highly queried tables show up earlier than less queried tables). Think of it as **Google search for data**. The project is named after Norwegian explorer [Roald Amundsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roald_Amundsen), the first person to discover the South Pole.\n\n<img\n  src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lfai/artwork/master/lfaidata-assets/lfaidata/stacked/color/lfaidata-stacked-color.png\"\n  alt=\"LF AI & Data\"\n  width=\"200\"\n/>\n\nAmundsen is hosted by the [LF AI & Data Foundation](https://lfaidata.foundation/). It includes three microservices, one data ingestion library and one common library.\n\n- [amundsenfrontendlibrary](frontend): Frontend service which is a Flask application with a React frontend. <img src=\"https://badge.fury.io/py/amundsen-frontend.svg\" />\n- [amundsensearchlibrary](search): Search service, which leverages Elasticsearch for search capabilities, is used to power frontend metadata searching. <img src=\"https://badge.fury.io/py/amundsen-search.svg\" />\n- [amundsenmetadatalibrary](metadata): Metadata service, which leverages Neo4j or Apache Atlas as the persistent layer, to provide various metadata. <img src=\"https://badge.fury.io/py/amundsen-metadata.svg\" />\n- [amundsendatabuilder](databuilder): Data ingestion library for building metadata graph and search index.\n  Users could either load the data with [a python script](https://github.com/amundsen-io/amundsen/blob/main/databuilder/example/scripts/sample_data_loader.py) with the library\n  or with an [Airflow DAG](https://github.com/amundsen-io/amundsen/tree/main/databuilder/example/dags) importing the library. <img src=\"https://badge.fury.io/py/amundsen-databuilder.svg\" />\n- [amundsencommon](common): Amundsen Common library holds common codes among microservices in Amundsen. <img src=\"https://badge.fury.io/py/amundsen-common.svg\" />\n- [amundsengremlin](https://github.com/amundsen-io/amundsengremlin): Amundsen Gremlin library holds code used for converting model objects into vertices and edges in gremlin. It's used for loading data into an AWS Neptune backend. <img src=\"https://badge.fury.io/py/amundsen-gremlin.svg\" />\n- [amundsenrds](https://github.com/amundsen-io/amundsenrds): Amundsenrds contains ORM models to support relational database as metadata backend store in Amundsen. The schema in ORM models follows the logic of databuilder models. Amundsenrds will be used in databuilder and metadatalibrary for metadata storage and retrieval with relational databases. <img src=\"https://badge.fury.io/py/amundsen-rds.svg\" />\n\n## Documentation\n* [Homepage](https://www.amundsen.io/)\n* [Documentation](https://www.amundsen.io/amundsen/)\n\n## Community Roadmap\nWe want your input about what is important, for that, add your votes using the 👍 reaction:\n* [Top Feature Requests](https://github.com/amundsen-io/amundsen/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc+label%3Atype%3Afeature+label%3Astatus%3Aneeds_votes+)\n* [Documentation Requests](https://github.com/amundsen-io/amundsen/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc+label%3Atype%3Adocumentation+label%3Astatus%3Aneeds_votes+)\n* [Top Bugs](https://github.com/amundsen-io/amundsen/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc+label%3Atype%3Abug+label%3Astatus%3Aneeds_votes+)\n* [Top Questions](https://github.com/amundsen-io/amundsen/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc+label%3Atype%3Aquestion+label%3Astatus%3Aneeds_votes)\n\n## Requirements\n- Python >= 3.8\n- Node v12\n\n## User Interface\n\nPlease note that the mock images only served as demonstration purpose.\n\n- **Landing Page**: The landing page for Amundsen including 1. search bars; 2. popular used tables;\n\n  ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amundsen-io/amundsen/master/docs/img/landing_page.png)\n\n- **Search Preview**: See inline search results as you type\n\n  ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amundsen-io/amundsen/master/docs/img/search_preview.png)\n\n- **Table Detail Page**: Visualization of a Hive / Redshift table\n\n  ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amundsen-io/amundsen/master/docs/img/table_detail_page_with_badges.png)\n\n- **Column detail**: Visualization of columns of a Hive / Redshift table which includes an optional stats display\n\n  ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amundsen-io/amundsen/master/docs/img/column_details.png)\n\n- **Data Preview Page**: Visualization of table data preview which could integrate with [Apache Superset](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset) or other Data Visualization Tools.\n\n  ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amundsen-io/amundsen/master/docs/img/data_preview.png)\n\n\n## Getting Started and Installation\n\nPlease visit the Amundsen installation documentation for a [quick start](https://www.amundsen.io/amundsen/installation/) to bootstrap a default version of Amundsen with dummy data.\n\n## Supported Entities\n\n- Tables (from Databases)\n- Dashboards\n- ML Features\n- People (from HR systems)\n\n## Supported Integrations\n\n### Table Connectors\n\n- [Amazon Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/)\n- [Amazon EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/)\n- [Amazon Glue](https://aws.amazon.com/glue/) and anything built over it\n- [Amazon Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/)\n- [Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/)\n- [Apache Druid](https://druid.apache.org/)\n- [Apache Hive](https://hive.apache.org/)\n- CSV\n- [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/)\n- [Delta Lake](https://delta.io/)\n- [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/)\n- [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery)\n- [IBM DB2](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/db2)\n- [Kafka Schema Registry](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/index.html)\n- [Microsoft SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/default.aspx)\n- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)\n- [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/index.html) (through dbapi or sql_alchemy)\n- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)\n- [PrestoDB](http://prestodb.io/)\n- [Trino (formerly Presto SQL)](https://trino.io/)\n- [Vertica](https://www.vertica.com/)\n- [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/)\n\nAmundsen can also connect to any database that provides `dbapi` or `sql_alchemy` interface (which most DBs provide).\n\n### Table Column Statistics\n\n- [Pandas Profiling](https://pandas-profiling.github.io/pandas-profiling/docs/master/rtd/)\n\n### Dashboard Connectors\n\n- [Apache Superset](https://superset.apache.org/)\n- [Mode Analytics](https://mode.com/)\n- [Redash](https://redash.io/)\n- [Tableau](https://tableau.com/)\n- [Databricks SQL](https://databricks.com/product/databricks-sql)\n\n### ETL Orchestration\n\n- [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/)\n\n## Get Involved in the Community\n\nWant help or want to help?
