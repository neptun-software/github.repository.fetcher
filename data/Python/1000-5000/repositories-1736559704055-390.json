Data Agent for data analysis with Python/SQL and data tools; \n2. Plugins Agent with 200+ daily tools; \n3. Web Agent for autonomous web browsing.\n\nOpenAgents can analyze data, call plugins, control your browser as ChatGPT Plus, but with OPEN Code for\n1. Easy deployment\n2. Full stack\n3. Chat Web UI\n4. Agent methods\n5. …\n   \nOpenAgents enables general users to interact with agent functionalities through a web UI optimized for swift responses and common failures, while offering developers and researchers a seamless deployment experience on local setups, providing a foundation for crafting innovative language agents and facilitating real-world evaluations.\nWe elucidate both the challenges and promising opportunities, aspiring to set a foundation for future research and development of real-world language agents.\n\nWe welcome contributions from everyone.

Web Agent will populate the form for you.\n\nWitness the full potential of Web Agent in these [use cases](https://docs.xlang.ai/use-cases/web-agent).\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"pics/web_agent.png\" width=\"784\"/>\n</div>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Click to see more use case screenshots</summary>\n<div align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"pics/web_agent_demo.png\" width=\"784\"/>\n</div>\n\n</details>\n\n\n## 💻 Localhost Deployment\n\nWe've released the OpenAgents platform code. Feel free to deploy on your own localhost!\n\nHere is a brief system design of OpenAgents:\n<div align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"pics/system_design.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n### From Source Code\n\nPlease check the following folders and README files to set up & localhost:\n\n1. [**Backend**](backend/README.md): the flask backend to host our three agents.\n2. [**Frontend**](frontend/README.md): the frontend UI and WeBot Chrome extension.\n\np.s.: We have renamed some arguments in code for better readability. If you have pulled the code before 10/26/2023, just a reminder that if you want to you pull the latest code, previous local chat history will be lost because of different key names.\n\n### Docker\n\nPlease follow the following steps to use the docker-compose to deploy the OpenAgents platform.\n\n*Note:* the docker is under development, so there may be functions not working properly as expected and slower response. Please feel free to open an issue if you have any questions. If you want a more robust version, currently we recommend you to deploy from source code.\n\n1. If you want to use kaggle's dataset, you must modify the information in the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile#L12) to your correct information.\n```\nENV KAGGLE_USER=\"\" \\\n    KAGGLE_KEY=\"\" \n```\n2. If you are not running locally, you need to modify the accessible IP to the backend service in [frontend/Dockerfile](frontend/Dockerfile#L15)\n```\nENV NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_ENDPOINT http://x.x.x.x:8000\n``` \n3. Run the `docker compose build` command in the project root directory.\n4. If you use openai unofficial services, such as [FastChat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat), you need to modify `OPENAI_API_BASE` in [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml#L36);otherwise you only to put your `OPENAI_API_KEY`  in [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml#L36)\n5. After completing the above steps, you can run `docker compose up -d` to start all services.\n\n**Notice**:\n1. If you want to use GPU, you need install [Nvidia Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html),and uncomment the the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml#L56-L62) Lines 56-62.\n2. Use Auto Plugin will download the weight file from huggingface. In some areas, connection timeout may occur. Please solve the network problem by yourself.\n\n\n\n## 📜 Tutorial on Extending OpenAgents\n### Code Structure\nBefore we dive into how to extend OpenAgents, let's first take a glance at the code structure for better understanding. \nThe code structure of OpenAgents is shown below:\n```bash\n├── backend  # backend code\n│   ├── README.md  # backend README for setup\n│   ├── api  # RESTful APIs, to be called by the frontend\n│   ├── app.py  # main flask app\n│   ├── display_streaming.py  # rendering the streaming response\n│   ├── kernel_publisher.py  # queue for code execution\n│   ├── main.py  # main entry for the backend\n│   ├── memory.py  # memory(storage) for the backend\n│   ├── schemas.py  # constant definitions\n│   ├── setup_script.sh  # one-click setup script for the backend\n│   ├── static  # static files, e.g., cache and figs\n│   └── utils  # utilities\n├── frontend  # frontend code\n│   ├── README.md  # frontend README for setup\n│   ├── components  # React components\n│   ├── hooks  # custom React hooks\n│   ├── icons  # icon assets\n│   ├── next-env.d.ts  # TypeScript declarations for Next.js environment variables\n│   ├── next-i18next.config.js  # configuration settings for internationalization\n│   ├── next.config.js  # configuration settings for Next.js\n│   ├── package-lock.json  # generated by npm that describes the exact dependency tree\n│   ├── package.json  # manifest file that describes the dependencies\n│   ├── pages  # Next.js pages\n│   ├── postcss.config.js  # configuration settings for PostCSS\n│   ├── prettier.config.js  # configuration settings for Prettier\n│   ├── public  # static assets\n│   ├── styles  # global styles\n│   ├── tailwind.config.js  # configuration settings for Tailwind CSS\n│   ├── tsconfig.json  # configuration settings for TypeScript\n│   ├── types  # type declarations\n│   ├── utils  # utilities or helper functions\n│   ├── vitest.config.ts  # configuration settings for ViTest\n│   └── webot_extension.zip  # Chrome extension for Web Agent\n└── real_agents  # language agents\n    ├── adapters  # shared components for the three agents to adapt to the backend\n    ├── data_agent  # data agent implementation\n    ├── plugins_agent  # plugins agent implementation\n    └── web_agent  # web agent implementation\n```\nAs shown, `backend/` and `frontend/` are self-contained and directly deployable (see [here](#localhost-deployment)).\nIt does not mean they cannot be modified.\nInstead, you can just follow the conventional *client-server* architecture to extend the backend and frontend as you wish.\nFor `real_agents/`, we design it to be \"one agent, one folder\", so that it is easy to extend a new agent. \nIt is worth noting that we name it \"real agents\" because not only the conceptual language agent part is included, but also the gaps between the language agent and the backend are filled here.\nFor example, `adapters/` contains the shared adapter components like stream parsing, data model, memory, callbacks, etc.\nWe refer interested readers to our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10634) for concepts and implementation designs.\nAnd we thank [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) as we base on their code to build real agents.\n\n### Extend A New Agent\nIf you want to build a new agent beyond the three agents we provide, you can follow the steps below:\n- Refer to the `real_agents/` folder to see how previous agents are implemented, and create a new folder for your agent.\n- Implement the agent logic in the new folder. Use the components under `adapters/` folder when needed.\n- Add a `chat_<new_agent>.py` file under `backend/api/` folder to define the chat API for the new agent, which will be called by the frontend.\n- Register new constants in `backend/schemas.py` if needed.\n- Add a new `OpenAgentID` in `frontend/types/agent.ts` and the corresponding API in `frontend/utils/app/api.ts` and `frontend/utils/app/const.ts`.\n- Implement the agent UI in `frontend/components/Chat/Chat.tsx` and `frontend/components/Chat/ChatMessage.tsx` when needed.\n- Run localhost script and test your new agent.\n\nNote, if new data types, i.e., beyond text, image, table, and json, you may need to implement its parsing logic in `backend/display_streaming.py` and add new data models.\n\n### Extend A New LLM\nExtending a new LLM as the agent backbone is simpler if the LLM is already hosted and can be called via API.\nJust register your new model in `backend/api/language_model.py`. Just refer to lemur-chat as a template.\n\nIf the LLM is not hosted yet, we have a tutorial on how to deploy a new LLM and expose it as an API [here]() (LLM hosting to todo).\n\n### Extend A New Tool\nIf you want to extend a new tool in Plugins Agent, you can follow the steps below:\n- Refer to the already built plugins in `real_agents/plugins_agent/plugins/`, and create a new folder for your tool.\n- Implement the tool logic in the new folder. Note that `ai-plugin.json` and `openapi.yaml` are essential for the tool to be recognized(which can be generated by LLM following the others rather than manually written). And the `paths/` are for the actual tool API call.\n- Register the new tool name in `real_agents/plugins_agent/plugins/plugin_names.py`.\n\n\n## 👏 Contributing\n\nThanks to open-sourced communities’ efforts, such as [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain), [ChatBot UI](https://github.com/mckaywrigley/chatbot-ui), [Taxy.ai browser extension](https://github.com/TaxyAI/browser-extension) and others.

を構築しました。\n\n現在、3つのエージェントを OpenAgents で実装し、[デモ](https://chat.xlang.ai)でホスティングして自由に使っています！\n1. データエージェントは、Python/SQL とデータツールを使ってデータ分析を行います;\n2. 200 以上のデイリーツールを備えたプラグインエージェント;\n3. 自律的なウェブ閲覧のためのウェブエージェント。\n\nOpenAgents は、ChatGPT Plus と同様に、データ分析、プラグインの呼び出し、ブラウザの制御を行うことができますが、OPEN Code for the OpenAgents では、以下のことが可能です\n1. 簡単なデプロイ\n2. フルスタック\n3. チャット Web UI\n4. エージェントメソッド\n5. …\n\nOpenAgents は、一般ユーザーが迅速な応答と一般的な障害のために最適化されたウェブUIを通じてエージェント機能と対話することを可能にする一方で、開発者や研究者にローカルセットアップでのシームレスなデプロイ体験を提供し、革新的な言語エージェントを作り、実世界での評価を容易にするための基盤を提供します。\n我々は、実世界における言語エージェントの将来的な研究開発のための基礎となることを目指し、課題と有望な機会の両方を明らかにします。\n\n##

フレームワークの簡単な概要です。コンセプトや設計の詳細については、[ドキュメント](https://docs.xlang.ai) を参照してください。\n\n### Data エージェント\n\n[Data エージェント](https://github.com/xlang-ai/OpenAgents/tree/main/real_agents/data_agent)は、効率的なデータ運用のために設計された包括的なツールキットである。以下の機能を提供します:\n\n- 🔍 **検索**: 必要なデータを素早く検索。\n- 🛠️ **取り扱い**: データ収集と処理を合理化。\n- 🔄 **操作**: 特定の要件に合わせてデータを修正。\n- 📊 **可視化**: データを明瞭かつ洞察的に表現。\n\nコードの記述と実行に熟達した Data エージェントは、データ中心の幅広いタスクを簡素化します。様々な[ユースケース](https://docs.xlang.ai/use-cases/data-agent)を通じて、その可能性を発見してください。\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"pics/data_agent.png\" width=\"784\"/>\n</div>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>その他の使用例のスクリーンショットを見るにはクリックしてください</summary>\n<div align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"pics/data_agent_demo.png\" width=\"784\"/>\n</div>\n\n</details>\n\n### Plugins エージェント\n\n[Plugins エージェント](https://github.com/xlang-ai/OpenAgents/tree/main/real_agents/plugins_agent)は、あなたの日常生活の様々な側面を豊かにするために厳選された200以上のサードパーティプラグインとシームレスに統合します。これらのプラグインを自由に使用することで、エージェントは、より効率的に幅広いタスクとアクティビティに取り組むことができます。\n\n🔌 **サンプルプラグイン**:\n\n- 🛍️ **ショッピング**: Klarna Shopping\n- ☁️ **天気**: XWeather\n- 🔬 **科学的探求**: Wolfram Alpha\n\n\n#### プラグインの併用\n\n相乗効果を利用しましょう！Plugins Agent は複数のプラグインの同時使用をサポートします。旅行の計画ですか？Klook、通貨コンバータ、WeatherViz の機能をシームレスに統合します。\n\n#### 自動プラグイン選択\n\n**自動プラグイン選択** 機能で選択を簡素化します。エージェントが直感的に検索し、あなたのニーズに合わせた最適なプラグインを提案します。\n\nPlugins エージェントが実際に使用されている様子を見るには、さらに多くの[使用例](https://docs.xlang.ai/use-cases/plugins-agent)をご覧ください。\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"pics/plugins_agent.png\" width=\"784\"/>\n</div>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>その他の使用例のスクリーンショットを見るにはクリックしてください</summary>\n<div align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"pics/plugins_agent_demo.png\" width=\"784\"/>\n</div>\n\n</details>\n\n### Web エージェント\n\n[Web エージェント](https://github.com/xlang-ai/OpenAgents/tree/main/real_agents/web_agent)は、ウェブサイトを自動的にナビゲートして探索するChrome拡張機能のパワーを利用します。このエージェントは、ウェブ閲覧体験を合理化し、関連情報の検索や目的のリソースへのアクセスなどを容易にします。\n\n**ウェブエージェントができることの例**:\n\n- 📍 **Googleマップ ナビゲーション**: 旅を計画中ですか？出発地と目的地を Web エージェントに伝えるだけです。Google マップをナビゲートし、最適なルートを表示します。\n- 🐦 **Twitter投稿**: Web エージェントと会話をしていて、X(Twitter) で何かを共有したいと思いましたか？ウェブエージェントがあなたのツイートを処理します。\n- 📝 **Googleフォーム アシスタンス**: イベントやアクティビティの申し込みが必要ですか？Google フォームのリンクと必要な情報を共有します。Web エージェントがフォームに入力します。\n\nこれらの[ユースケース](https://docs.xlang.ai/use-cases/web-agent)で、Web エージェントの可能性を存分にご覧ください。\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"pics/web_agent.png\" width=\"784\"/>\n</div>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>その他の使用例のスクリーンショットを見るにはクリックしてください</summary>\n<div align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"pics/web_agent_demo.png\" width=\"784\"/>\n</div>\n\n</details>\n\n\n## 💻 ローカルホストデプロイメント\nOpenAgentsプラットフォームのコードをリリースしました。お気軽にご自身のローカルホストでデプロイしてみてください！\n\nこちらがOpenAgentsのシステムデザインの概要です：\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"pics/system_design.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n### ソースコードから\nセットアップとローカルホストでの使用については、以下のフォルダとREADMEファイルをご確認ください：\n\n1. バックエンド：三つのエージェントをホストするためのflaskバックエンド。\n2. フロントエンド：フロントエンドのUIとWeBot Chrome拡張機能。\nP.S.：コードの中でいくつかの引数をより読みやすくするためにリネームしました。2023年10月26日以前にコードをプルしていた方へのリマインダーとして、最新のコードをプルしたい場合は、キー名の違いにより以前のローカルチャット履歴が失われることをご注意ください。\n\n### Docker\nOpenAgentsプラットフォームをデプロイするためにdocker-composeを使用する手順は以下の通りです。\n\n注意: Dockerは開発中のため、一部の機能が正常に動作しないか、反応が遅い場合があります。何か質問があれば、お気軽にissueをオープンしてください。より安定したバージョンをお求めの方には、現在のところソースコードからデプロイすることをお勧めします。\n\n1. Kaggleのデータセットを使用したい場合は、Dockerfileの情報を正しい情報に変更する必要があります。\n```\nENV KAGGLE_USER=\"\" \\\n    KAGGLE_KEY=\"\" \n```\n2. ローカルで実行していない場合は、frontend/Dockerfileのバックエンドサービスへのアクセス可能なIPを変更する必要があります。\n```\nENV NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_ENDPOINT http://x.x.x.x:8000\n```\n3. プロジェクトのルートディレクトリでdocker compose buildコマンドを実行します。\n4. Openaiの非公式サービス、例えばFastChatを使用する場合は、docker-compose.ymlのOPENAI_API_BASEを変更する必要があります。それ以外の場合は、docker-compose.ymlにOPENAI_API_KEYを入れるだけです。\n5. 上記のステップを完了したら、docker compose up -dを実行してすべてのサービスを開始できます。\n\n\n## 📜 OpenAgentsを拡張するためのチュートリアル\n### コードの構造\nOpenAgentsを拡張する方法を深く探る前に、理解を深めるためにまずコードの構造を見てみましょう。\nOpenAgentsのコード構造は以下の通りです:\n```bash\n├── backend  # backend code\n│   ├── README.md  # backend README for setup\n│   ├── api  # RESTful APIs, to be called by the frontend\n│   ├── app.py  # main flask app\n│   ├── display_streaming.py  # rendering the streaming response\n│   ├── kernel_publisher.py  # queue for code execution\n│   ├── main.py  # main entry for the backend\n│   ├── memory.py  # memory(storage) for the backend\n│   ├── schemas.py  # constant

README.md  # frontend README for setup\n│   ├── components  # React components\n│   ├── hooks  # custom React hooks\n│   ├── icons  # icon assets\n│   ├── next-env.d.ts  # TypeScript declarations for Next.js environment variables\n│   ├── next-i18next.config.js  # configuration settings for internationalization\n│   ├── next.config.js  # configuration settings for Next.js\n│   ├──

components for the three agents to adapt to the backend\n    ├── data_agent  # data agent implementation\n    ├── plugins_agent  # plugins agent implementation\n    └── web_agent  # web agent implementation\n```\n示されている通り、`backend/` と `frontend/` は自己完結型であり、直接デプロイ可能です（[こちら](#localhost-deployment)を参照）。\nこれは、それらが変更できないという意味ではありません。\nむしろ、従来の*クライアント-サーバー*アーキテクチャに従って、backendとfrontendをお好みに応じて拡張できます。\n`real_agents/` については、「一つのエージェント、一つのフォルダ」という設計にしていますので、新しいエージェントを簡単に拡張できます。\nここでの「実エージェント」という名前は、概念的な言語エージェントの部分だけでなく、言語エージェントとbackendとの間のギャップもここに埋められているためです。\n例えば、`adapters/` には、ストリーム解析、データモデル、メモリ、コールバックなどの共有アダプターコンポーネントが含まれています。\n関心のある読者は、概念と実装デザインについて、私たちの[論文](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10634)を参照してください。\nそして、実エージェントを構築するためのベースとして[LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain)のコードを使用していることに感謝します。\n\n### 新しいエージェントを拡張する\n私たちが提供する三つのエージェントを超えて新しいエージェントを構築したい場合、以下の手順に従ってください：\n- 既存のエージェントがどのように実装されているかを確認するために `real_agents/` フォルダを参照し、エージェント用の新しいフォルダを作成します。\n- 新しいフォルダでエージェントのロジックを実装します。必要に応じて `adapters/` フォルダのコンポーネントを使用します。\n- 新しいエージェントのチャットAPIを定義するための `chat_<new_agent>.py` ファイルを `backend/api/` フォルダに追加し、これはfrontendから呼び出されます。\n- 必要に応じて `backend/schemas.py` に新しい定数を登録します。\n- `frontend/types/agent.ts` に新しい `OpenAgentID` を追加し、`frontend/utils/app/api.ts` と `frontend/utils/app/const.ts` に対応するAPIを追加します。\n- 必要に応じて `frontend/components/Chat/Chat.tsx` と `frontend/components/Chat/ChatMessage.tsx` でエージェントのUIを実装します。\n- localhostのスクリプトを実行し、新しいエージェントをテストします。\n\n注意：新しいデータタイプ、つまり、テキスト、画像、テーブル、およびjsonを超えて、`backend/display_streaming.py` でその解析ロジックを実装し、新しいデータモデルを追加する必要があるかもしれません。\n\n### 新しいLLMを拡張する\nLLMがすでにホストされており、API経由で呼び出すことができる場合、エージェントのバックボーンとして新しいLLMを拡張するのは簡単です。\n新しいモデルを `backend/api/language_model.py` に\n\n登録するだけです。lemur-chatをテンプレートとして参照してください。\n\nもしLLMがまだホストされていない場合、新しいLLMをデプロイし、APIとして公開する方法についてのチュートリアルが[こちら]() (LLMホスティングはtodo)にあります。\n\n### 新しいツールを拡張する\nPlugins Agentで新しいツールを拡張したい場合は、以下の手順に従ってください：\n- 既に構築されているプラグインを `real_agents/plugins_agent/plugins/` で参照し、ツールの新しいフォルダを作成します。\n- 新しいフォルダでツールのロジックを実装します。ツールが認識されるためには `ai-plugin.json` と `openapi.yaml` が必要であり（これはLLMによって他のものに従って生成されるか、手動で書かれるかのどちらかです）、`paths/` は実際のツールAPIコールのためのものです。\n- 新しいツール名を `real_agents/plugins_agent/plugins/plugin_names.py` に登録します。\n\n\n## 👏

([여기](#localhost-deployment)를 보세요.) \n이는 수정할 수 없다는 의미가 아닌, 전통적인 *클라이언트-서버* 아키텍처를 따라 원하는대로 백엔드와 프론트엔드를 확장할 수 있다는 것을 의미합니다. \n`real_agents/`는 \"하나의 에이전트, 하나의 폴더\"로 설계되어 새로운 에이전트를 쉽게 확장할 수 있도록 구성되었습니다. \n\"real agents\"라는 이름을 사용한 이유는 개념적인 언어 에이전트 부분뿐만 아니라 언어 에이전트와 백엔드 간의 간극을 채우기 위한 내용도 포함되어 있기 때문입니다.\n예를 들어, `adapters/` 폴더에는 스트림 파싱, 데이터 모델, 메모리, 콜백 등과 같은 공유 어댑터 컴포넌트가 포함되어 있습니다.\n개념과 구현 설계에 대한 자세한 내용은 [논문](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10634)을 참조하시기 바랍니다. \n또한, 우리는 실제 에이전트를 구축하는데 코드 기반을 제공해 준 [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain)에게 감사의 말씀을 전합니다.\n\n### 새로운 에이전트를 확장하기\n저희가 제공하는 세 가지의 에이전트 말고도 다른 새로운 에이전트를 구축하고 싶으시다면 아래 스텝을 따라 주세요:\n- 새로운 에이전트를 구현하기 위해 이전 에이전트가 구현된 `real_agents/` 폴더를 참조하고, 새로운 폴더를 생성하십시오.\n- 새로운 폴더에 있는 에이전트 로직을 구현하십시오. 필요한 경우 `adapters/` 폴더 내의 컴포넌트를 사용하십시오.\n- 먼저, 새로운 에이전트를 위한 채팅 API를 정의하기 위해 `backend/api/` 폴더에 `chat_<new_agent>.py` 파일을 추가하세요. 이 파일은 프론트엔드에서 호출될 것입니다.\n- 필요한 경우, `backend/schemas.py`파일에 새로운 상수를 등록하세요.\n- 프론트엔드에서 새로운 OpenAgentID를 추가하고, 이에 해당하는 API를 `frontend/utils/app/api.ts`와 `frontend/utils/app/const.ts`에 추가해주세요.\n- 필요한 경우, `frontend/components/Chat/Chat.tsx`와 `frontend/components/Chat/ChatMessage.tsx`에서 에이전트 UI를 구현해주세요.\n- 로컬 호스트 스크립트를 실행하고 새로운 에이전트를 테스트해보세요.\n\n참고: 새로운 데이터 유형(예: 텍스트, 이미지, 테이블 및 JSON 이외의 유형)의 경우, 백엔드의 `display_streaming.py`에서 해당 데이터의 구문 분석 로직을 구현하고 새로운 데이터 모델을 추가해야 할 수도 있습니다.\n\n### 새로운 LLM을 확장하기\nLLM(Large Language Model)을 에이전트 백본으로 확장하는 것은, LLM이 이미 호스팅되어 API를 통해 호출될 수 있는 경우 더욱 간단해집니다. `backend/api/language_model.py`에서 새로운 모델을 등록하기만 하면 됩니다. lemur-chat을 참고하면 템플릿으로 사용할 수 있습니다.\nLLM이 아직 호스팅되지 않은 경우, LLM을 새로 배포하고 API로 노출하는 방법에 대한 튜토리얼이 [여기]()에 있습니다. (LLM 호스팅은 todo).\n\n### 새로운 도구를 확장하기\n플러그인 에이전트에 있는 도구를 확장해보고 싶다면, 아래 스텝을 따르세요:\n- `real_agents/plugins_agent/plugins/`에 이미 구축된 플러그인들을 참고하고, 도구에 대한 새로운 폴더를 생성해주세요.\n- 새로운 폴더에 도구 로직을 구현해주세요. 도구가 인식되기 위해 `ai-plugin.json`과 `openapi.yaml` 파일이 필수적입니다(이는 수동으로 작성하는 대신 다른 예시를 따라서 LLM이 생성할 수 있습니다). 또한 `paths/` 폴더는 실제 도구 API 호출을 위한 경로입니다.\n- `real_agents/plugins_agent/plugin_names.py`에 새로운 도구 이름을 등록해주세요.\n\n## 👏 기여하기\n\n감사하게도 오픈 소스 커뮤니티인 [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain), [ChatBot UI](https://github.com/mckaywrigley/chatbot-ui), [Taxy.ai browser extension](https://github.com/TaxyAI/browser-extension) 등의 노력 덕분에 저희는 인터페이스 프로토타입을 더 편리하고 효율적으로 구축할 수 있었습니다.\n\n저희는 여러분들의 기여와 조언을 환영하며, 함께 더 나은 결과물을 만들어나갈 수 있기를 기대합니다! 기여하고 싶으시다면 다음 단계를 따라주세요:\n\n- **1단계**: 추가적인 기능이나 개선 사항을 추가하고 싶거나 경험 중에 문제를 마주치면 [이슈](https://github.com/xlang-ai/OpenAgents/issues)를 게시해주세요. 또한 [이슈 템플릿](https://github.com/xlang-ai/OpenAgents/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)을 따라주시면 감사하겠습니다. 이슈는 해당 위치에서 논의되고 할당될 것입니다.\n- **2단계**: 이슈가 할당되면 [풀 리퀘스트 템플릿](https://github.com/xlang-ai/OpenAgents/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)을 따라 [풀 리퀘스트](https://github.com/xlang-ai/OpenAgents/pulls)를 생성하여 기여할 수 있습니다. 또한 열려있는 이슈를 요청할 수도 있습니다. 우리는 함께 OpenAgents를 더욱 발전시킬 수 있습니다!\n- **3단계**: PR은 검토와 논의 이후에 병합되거나 반복될 것입니다. 기여해주셔서 감사합니다!\n\n시작하기 전에, [여기](https://github.com/xlang-ai/OpenAgents/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)를 확인하는 것을 강력히 권장합니다.\n\n## 📖 문서화\n전체 문서에 대해서는 [여기](https://docs.xlang.ai)를 확인해주세요. 문서는 데모 변경 및 코드 릴리스와 함께 최신화될 예정입니다.\n\n## 🧙‍어떤 분들이 참여하고 있나요?\n\n### 기술 리드\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/Impavidity\"><img src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9245607?v=4\"  width=\"50\" /></a>\n\n### 공동 리드 기여자\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/BlankCheng\"><img src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34505296?v=4\"  width=\"50\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/koalazf99\"><img src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37338733?v=4\"  width=\"50\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/Timothyxxx\"><img src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47296835?v=4\"  width=\"50\" /></a>\n\n### 주요 기여자\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/taogoddd\"><img src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98326623?v=4\"  width=\"50\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/WhiteWolf82\"><img src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48792453?v=4\"  width=\"50\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/ztjhz\"><img src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59118459?v=4\"  width=\"50\" /></a>\n\n### 소중한 기여자\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/BillStark001\"><img src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31788509?v=4\"  width=\"50\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/SivilTaram\"><img src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10275209?v=4\"  width=\"50\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/che330\"><img src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122778503?v=4\"  width=\"50\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/leo-liuzy\"><img src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11146950?v=4\"  width=\"50\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/ranpox\"><img src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25601999?v=4\"  width=\"50\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/hongjin-su\"><img src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114016954?v=4\"  width=\"50\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/QIN2DIM\"><img src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/62018067?v=4\"  width=\"50\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/xJQx\"><img src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47933193?v=4\"  width=\"50\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/thomasshin\"><img src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76890354?v=4\"  width=\"50\" /></a>\n\n### 감사의 말 (코드를 넘어서)\nOpenAgents에 많은 기여를 해주신 [Ziyi Huang](https://www.joanna-ziyi-huang.com/), [Roxy Rong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roxyrong/), [Haotian Li](https://haotian-li.com/), [Xingbo Wang](https://andy-xingbowang.com/), [Jansen Wong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jansenwong/), 그리고 [Chen Henry Wu](https://chenwu.io/) 께 진심으로 감사의 마음을 전합니다. 이분들의 전문성과 통찰력은 이 프로젝트를 완성하는 데 중요한 역할을 했습니다!\n\n### 오픈소스 기여자\n기여해 주신 모든 분들께 감사드립니다!\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/xlang-ai/OpenAgents/graphs/contributors\">\n  <img src=\"https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=xlang-ai/OpenAgents\" />\n</a>\n\n## 인용\n만약 여러분에게 우리의 프로젝트가 도움이 되었다면, 다음과 같이 인용해 주시기 바랍니다:\n```\n@misc{OpenAgents,\n      title={OpenAgents: An Open Platform for Language Agents in the Wild}, \n      author={Tianbao Xie and Fan Zhou and Zhoujun Cheng and Peng Shi and Luoxuan Weng and Yitao Liu and Toh Jing Hua and Junning Zhao and Qian Liu and Che Liu and Leo Z.

Agent）的搭建，但是同时忽视了非专家用户的使用，对应用级设计也关注较少。\n我们创建了OpenAgents，一个用于在日常生活中使用和托管语言智能体的开放平台。\n\n我们现在在OpenAgents中实现了三个智能体，并在[demo](https://chat.xlang.ai)上免费托管他们！\n1. 数据智能体-用于用Python/SQL和数据工具进行数据分析；\n2. 插件智能体-具有200多个日常工具，并且可供拓展；\n3. 网络智能体-用于自动上网。\n\nOpenAgents可以分析数据，调用插件，像ChatGPT Plus一样控制浏览器，但完全开源，以：\n1. 易于部署\n2. 全栈代码\n3. 聊天Web UI\n4. 代理方法\n5. …\n   \nOpenAgents使普通用户通过为快速响应和常见失败进行优化的web UI与智能体功能进行交互，同时为开发人员和研究人员在本地设置上提供无缝部署体验，为制作创新的语言代理和实现现实世界评估提供了基础。\n我们解释了挑战和有前景的机会，希望能为现实世界语言代理的未来研究和开发设置基础。\n\n## 🔫

OpenAgents\n\n我们用基于聊天的web UI构建了三个真实世界的智能体(查看[OpenAgents的demo展示](https://chat.xlang.ai))。以下是我们的OpenAgents框架的简要概览。您可以在我们的[文档](https://docs.xlang.ai)中找到更多关于概念和设计的详细信息。\n\n### 数据智能体（Data Agent）\n\n[数据智能体](https://github.com/xlang-ai/OpenAgents/tree/main/real_agents/data_agent) 是一款设计用于高效数据操作的全面工具包。它提供以下功能：\n\n- 🔍 **搜索**： 快速定位所需的数据。\n- 🛠️ **处理**：简化数据获取和处理。\n- 🔄 **操作**：按照特定要求修改数据。\n- 📊 **可视化**：以清晰且有见解的方式表示数据。\n\n数据智能体高效地写入和执行代码，简化了大范围的数据相关任务。通过各种 [使用案例](https://docs.xlang.ai/use-cases/data-agent) 了解它的潜力。\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"pics/data_agent.png\" width=\"784\"/>\n</div>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>点击查看更多使用案例的屏幕截图</summary>\n<div align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"pics/data_agent_demo.png\" width=\"784\"/>\n</div>\n\n</details>\n\n### 插件智能体（Plugins Agent）\n\n[插件智能体](https://github.com/xlang-ai/OpenAgents/tree/main/real_agents/plugins_agent) 无缝地与200多个第三方插件集成，每个插件都是精选的，用于丰富您日常生活的各个方面。有了这些插件，该代理使您能更有效地处理各种任务和活动。\n\n🔌 **插件例子包括**：\n\n- 🛍️ **购物**：Klarna购物\n- ☁️ **天气**：XWeather\n- 🔬 **科学探索**：Wolfram Alpha\n\n#### 组合插件使用\n\n发挥协同作用的力量！插件代理支持同时使用多个插件。计划旅行？无缝地将Klook、货币转换器和WeatherViz的功能整合。\n\n#### 自动插件选择\n\n我们的**自动插件选择**特性简化了您的选择。让代理直观地搜索并建议最适合您需求的插件。\n\n深入更多 [使用案例](https://docs.xlang.ai/use-cases/plugins-agent) 查看插件智能体的能怎么做。\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"pics/plugins_agent.png\" width=\"784\"/>\n</div>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>点击查看更多使用案例的屏幕截图</summary>\n<div align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"pics/plugins_agent_demo.png\" width=\"784\"/>\n</div>\n\n</details>\n\n### 上网智能体（Web Agent）\n\n[上网智能体](https://github.com/xlang-ai/OpenAgents/tree/main/real_agents/web_agent)利用Chrome扩展程序自动浏览和探索网站。这种代理使网络浏览体验更加流畅，使查找相关信息、访问所需资源等变得更加容易。\n\n**上网智能体可以做什么的例子**：\n\n- 📍 **Google地图导航**：规划旅程？只需向上网智能体传达您的出发点和目的地。它将为您导航Google地图并提供最佳路线。\n- 🐦 **Twitter发帖**：与上网智能体参与对话，并希望在Twitter上分享一些内容？提及内容，上网智能体将毫不费力地处理您的推文。\n- 📝 **Google表单助手**：需要报名参加活动或活动？分享Google表单链接和所需的详细信息。上网智能体将为您填充表单。\n\n在这些[使用案例](https://docs.xlang.ai/use-cases/web-agent)中看到上网智能体的全部潜力。\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"pics/web_agent.png\" width=\"784\"/>\n</div>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>点击查看更多使用案例的屏幕截图</summary>\n<div align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"pics/web_agent_demo.png\" width=\"784\"/>\n</div>\n\n</details>\n\n## 💻 本地部署\n\n我们已经发布了OpenAgents平台代码。随时在您的本地主机上进行部署！\n\n以下是OpenAgents的简要系统设计：\n<div align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"pics/system_design.png\"/>\n</div>\n\n### 源码部署\n请查看下面的文件和README文件来设置和启动localhost：\n\n1. [**Backend**](backend/README.md): 我们的三个代理的 Flask 后端。\n2. [**Frontend**](frontend/README.md): 前端 UI 和 WeBot Chrome 扩展程序。\n\nP.S.：我们为了提升代码的可读性，对一些参数进行了重命名。如果你在2023年10月26日之前已经拉取了代码，这里提醒你，如果你想拉取最新的代码，由于部分key name的不同，之前的本地聊天记录将会丢失。\n\n### Docker部署\n请按照以下步骤使用docker-compose来部署OpenAgents平台。\n\n注意： docker仍在开发中，因此可能会有一些功能无法正常工作，响应也可能较慢。如果您有任何问题，请随时提出issue。如果您需要一个更稳定的版本，我们目前建议您从源代码部署。\n\n1. 如果您想要使用kaggle的数据集，您必须修改Dockerfile中的信息为您的正确信息。\n```\nENV KAGGLE_USER=\"\" \\\n    KAGGLE_KEY=\"\" \n```\n2. 如果您不是在本地运行，您需要修改frontend/Dockerfile中的后端服务可访问的IP地址\n```\nENV NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_ENDPOINT http://x.x.x.x:8000\n```\n3. 在项目根目录运行docker compose build命令。\n4. 如果您使用openai非官方服务，如FastChat，您需要在docker-compose.yml中修改OPENAI_API_BASE；否则您只需在docker-compose.yml中放置您的OPENAI_API_KEY。\n5. 完成以上步骤后，您可以运行docker compose up -d以启动所有服务。\n\n**注意**：\n1. 如果你想要使用GPU，你需要先安装[Nvidia Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html),然后去掉[docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml#L56-L62)56-62行的注释。\n2. 使用Auto plugin 将会从huggingface下载权重文件，在有些地区可能会出现连接超时，请自行解决网络问题。\n\n## 📜 拓展OpenAgents的教程\n### 代码结构\n在我们深入探讨如何扩展OpenAgents之前，首先让我们简要了解一下代码结构以便更好地理解。\nOpenAgents的代码结构如下所示：\n```bash\n├── backend  # backend code\n│   ├──

是自包含的，并且可以直接部署（参见[这里](#localhost-deployment)）。\n这并不意味着它们不能被修改。\n相反，您可以按照传统的*客户端-服务器*架构来根据您的需求扩展后端和前端。\n对于`real_agents/`，我们设计它为“一个智能体，一个文件夹”的形式，以便于扩展新的代理。\n值得注意的是，我们将其命名为“真实代理”，因为这里不仅包括了概念性的语言代理部分，还填补了语言代理和后端之间的空白。\n例如，`adapters/` 包含了像流解析（streaming parsing）、数据模型（DataModel）、内存（memory）、回调（callbacks）等共享的适配器组件。\n我们推荐感兴趣的读者参考我们的 [论文](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10634) 了解概念和实现设计。\n我们也感谢 [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) ，因为我们基于他们的代码构建真实代理。\n\n### 扩展一个新的智能体\n如果您想构建一个新的智能体，超出我们提供的三个智能体，您可以按照以下步骤操作：\n- 参考 `real_agents/` 文件夹，查看之前的智能体是如何实现的，并为您的代理创建一个新文件夹。\n- 在新文件夹中实现智能体逻辑。在需要时使用 `adapters/` 文件夹下的组件。\n- 在 `backend/api/` 文件夹下添加一个 `chat_<new_agent>.py` 文件，以定义新代理的聊天API，该API将由前端调用。\n- 在 `backend/schemas.py` 中注册新的常量（如果需要的话）。\n- 在 `frontend/types/agent.ts` 中添加一个新的 `OpenAgentID`，并在 `frontend/utils/app/api.ts` 和 `frontend/utils/app/const.ts` 中添加相应的API。\n- 在需要时在 `frontend/components/Chat/Chat.tsx` 和 `frontend/components/Chat/ChatMessage.tsx` 中实现代理的UI。\n- 运行本地主机脚本并测试您的新智能体。\n\n请注意，如果有新的数据类型，即超出文本、图片、表格和json，您可能需要在 `backend/display_streaming.py` 中实现其解析逻辑，并添加新的数据模型。\n\n### 扩展一个新的LLM\n如果LLM已经托管并可以通过API调用，那么将新的LLM作为智能体主干进行扩展会更简单。\n只需在 `backend/api/language_model.py` 中注册您的新模型。您可以参考lemur-chat作为模板。\n\n如果LLM还没有被托管，我们有一个教程，教您如何部署一个新的LLM并将其作为API公开[这里]()（LLM托管待办事项）。\n\n### 扩展一个新的工具\n如果您想在插件智能体中扩展一个新工具，可以按照以下步骤操作：\n- 参考在 `real_agents/plugins_agent/plugins/` 中已经构建的插件，并为您的工具创建一个新文件夹。\n- 在新文件夹中实现工具逻辑。请注意，`ai-plugin.json` 和 `openapi.yaml` 对于工具被识别是必要的（可以由LLM生成，跟随其他工具，而不是手动编写）。而 `paths/` 是用于实际的工具API调用。\n- 在 `real_agents/plugins_agent/plugins/plugin_names.py` 中注册新工具的名称。\n\n\n## 👏 贡献\n感谢开源社区的努力，如[LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain)、[ChatBot
