All the detection documents in this project follow the structure of [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) categorizing post-compromise adversary behavior in tactical groups and are available in the form of [interactive notebooks](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/projects/architecture/content-architecture.html#the-jupyter-notebook-format). The use of notebooks not only allow us to share text, queries and expected output, but also code to help others run detection logic against [pre-recorded security datasets](https://securitydatasets.com) locally or remotely through [BinderHub](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) cloud computing environments. \n\n## Docs: https://threathunterplaybook.com/\n## Goals\n\n* Expedite the development of techniques an hypothesis for hunting campaigns.\n* Help security researchers understand patterns of behavior observed during post-exploitation.\n* Share resources to validate analytics locally or remotely through cloud computing environments for free.\n* Map pre-recorded datasets to adversarial techniques.\n* Accelerate infosec learning through open source resources.\n\n## Author\n\nRoberto Rodriguez [@Cyb3rWard0g](https://twitter.com/Cyb3rWard0g)\n\n## Official Committers\n\n* Jose Luis Rodriguez [@Cyb3rPandaH](https://twitter.com/Cyb3rPandaH) is adding his expertise in data science to it.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n* We document and share our content via a [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) which was created by [Sam Lau](http://www.samlau.me/) and [Chris Holdgraf](https://predictablynoisy.com/) with support of the **UC Berkeley Data Science Education Program and the [Berkeley Institute for Data Science](https://bids.berkeley.edu/)**\n"
