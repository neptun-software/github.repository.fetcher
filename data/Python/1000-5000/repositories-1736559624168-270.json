          "content": "# Contributing to Guardrails\n\nWelcome and thank you for your interest in contributing to Guardrails! We appreciate all contributions, big or small, from bug fixes to new features. Before diving in, let's go through some guidelines to make the process smoother for everyone.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n1. If you're fixing a bug or typo, feel free to submit a Pull Request directly.\n2. For new features or bug fix discussions, open an issue or join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Jsey3mX98B) to chat with the community.\n\n## Setting Up Your Environment\n\n1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/guardrails-ai/guardrails.git`\n2. Enter the project directory: `cd guardrails`\n3. Install the project in developer mode (use a virtual environment if preferred): `make dev`\n4. Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/): `pre-commit install`\n\n## Development Workflow\n\nFollow these steps before committing your changes:\n\n1. Ensure tests pass: `make test`\n2. Format your code: `make autoformat`\n3. Run static analysis: `make type`\n4. Update documentation if needed. Docs are located in the `docs` directory. You can serve docs using `mkdocs serve`.\n\n### Optional: Pre-Commit Hooks\n\nFor convenience, consider [installing the pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com/#installation) provided in the repository. These hooks automatically run tests and formatting checks each time you commit, reducing development overhead.\n\n## Submitting a Pull Request\n\n1. Ensure all tests pass and code is formatted.\n2. Create a pull request with a clear description of your changes. Link to relevant issues or discussions. Follow [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) if needed.\n3. Address any failing checks before requesting a review.\n4. Engage in the code review process and make any necessary changes.\n5. Celebrate when your pull request is merged! Your changes will be available in the next Guardrails release.\n\nThank you for your contribution and happy coding!\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocs are served via docusaurus. To serve docs locally, run the following\n\n```bash\n# install dependencies\npip install -e \".[dev]\"\n\n# install npm dependencies\nnpm i\n\n# serve the docs\nnpm run start\n```\nthen navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser."

          "content": "# Structure\n\nGuardrails docs are served as a docusaurus site. The docs are compiled from various sources\n\n1. Manually written markdown files in the `docs` directory\n2. Python notebooks in the `docs` directory translated to markdown using nb-docs\n3. Automatically generated python docs from the `guardrails` directory\n\nThese sources need to be built and compiled before the site can be served. \n\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\n# Install poetry\npip install poetry\n\n# Make sure you're in a venv (Recommended)\n# Use conda or other venv management tools if you'd like\npython -m venv .venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate\n\n# Make the project\nmake full\n\n# Serve the docs\nnpm run start\n```\n\n## How the build process works\n\n1. pydocs is used to create python docs in the 'docs/' directory\n1. a new folder called 'docs-build' is created\n1. docs are copied from 'docs/' to 'docs-build/'\n1. nbdocs is used on all notebooks in the 'docs-build' directory. This creates md files parallel to the notebooks in the dir structure.\n1. md files are iterated and converted to mdx files. We import some custom components at the top of each mdx file.\n\n## Troubleshooting/common problems\n\n1. On first run, the docs build does not complete and the site is not served\n    - This is usually an intermittent failure with nb-docs. Try running `npm run start` again\n    - If this doesn't work, try running `rm -rf docs-build; npm run start`\n    - If even that doesn't work, please file an issue. Something may be wrong with docs builds on the branch\n1. I updated a notebook and it didn't update in the docs\n    - This is likely because the notebook wasn't converted to markdown, or files were not overwritten\n    - To fix this, run `rm -rf docs-build; npm run start`\n"

Guardrails runs Input/Output Guards in your application that detect, quantify and mitigate the presence of specific types of risks. To look at the full suite of risks, check out [Guardrails Hub](https://hub.guardrailsai.com/).\n2. Guardrails help you generate structured data from LLMs.\n\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guardrails-ai/guardrails/main/docs/img/with_and_without_guardrails.svg\" alt=\"Guardrails in your application\" width=\"1500px\">\n</div>\n\n\n### Guardrails Hub\n\nGuardrails Hub is a collection of pre-built measures of specific types of risks (called 'validators'). Multiple validators can be combined together into Input and Output Guards that intercept the inputs and outputs of LLMs. Visit [Guardrails Hub](https://hub.guardrailsai.com/) to see the full list of validators and their documentation.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guardrails-ai/guardrails/main/docs/img/guardrails_hub.gif\" alt=\"Guardrails Hub gif\" width=\"600px\">\n</div>\n\n\n## Installation\n\n```python\npip install guardrails-ai\n```\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\n\n### Create Input and Output Guards for LLM Validation\n\n1. Download and configure the Guardrails Hub CLI.\n    \n    ```bash\n    pip install guardrails-ai\n    guardrails configure\n    ```\n2. Install a guardrail from Guardrails Hub.\n\n    ```bash\n    guardrails hub install hub://guardrails/regex_match\n    ```\n3. Create a Guard from the installed guardrail.\n\n    ```python\n    from guardrails import Guard, OnFailAction\n    from guardrails.hub import RegexMatch\n\n    guard = Guard().use(\n        RegexMatch, regex=\"\\(?\\d{3}\\)?-? *\\d{3}-? *-?\\d{4}\", on_fail=OnFailAction.EXCEPTION\n    )\n\n    guard.validate(\"123-456-7890\")  # Guardrail passes\n\n    try:\n        guard.validate(\"1234-789-0000\")  # Guardrail fails\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(e)\n    ```\n    Output:\n    ```console\n    Validation failed for field with errors: Result must match \\(?\\d{3}\\)?-? *\\d{3}-? *-?\\d{4}\n    ```\n4. Run multiple guardrails within a Guard.\n    First, install the necessary guardrails from Guardrails Hub.\n\n    ```bash\n    guardrails hub install hub://guardrails/competitor_check\n    guardrails hub install hub://guardrails/toxic_language\n    ```\n\n    Then, create a Guard from the installed guardrails.\n    \n    ```python\n    from guardrails import Guard, OnFailAction\n    from guardrails.hub import CompetitorCheck, ToxicLanguage\n\n    guard = Guard().use_many(\n        CompetitorCheck([\"Apple\", \"Microsoft\", \"Google\"], on_fail=OnFailAction.EXCEPTION),\n        ToxicLanguage(threshold=0.5, validation_method=\"sentence\", on_fail=OnFailAction.EXCEPTION)\n    )\n\n    guard.validate(\n        \"\"\"An apple a day keeps a doctor away.\n        This is good advice for keeping your health.\"\"\"\n    )  # Both the guardrails pass\n\n    try:\n        guard.validate(\n            \"\"\"Shut the hell up! Apple just released a new iPhone.\"\"\"\n        )  # Both the guardrails fail\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(e)\n    ```\n    Output:\n    ```console\n    Validation failed for field with errors: Found the following competitors: [['Apple']]. Please avoid naming those competitors next time, The following sentences in your response were found to be toxic:\n\n    - Shut the hell up!\n    ```\n\n### Use Guardrails to generate structured data from LLMs\n\n\nLet's go through an example where we ask an LLM to generate fake pet names. To do this, we'll create a Pydantic [BaseModel](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/api/base_model/) that represents the structure of the output we want.\n\n```py\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\n\nclass Pet(BaseModel):\n    pet_type: str = Field(description=\"Species of pet\")\n    name: str = Field(description=\"a unique pet name\")\n```\n\nNow, create a Guard from the `Pet` class. The Guard can be used to call the LLM in a manner so that the output is formatted to the `Pet` class. Under the hood, this is done by either of two methods:\n1. Function calling: For LLMs that support function calling, we generate structured data using the function call syntax.\n2. Prompt optimization: For LLMs that don't support function calling, we add the schema of the expected output to the prompt so that the LLM can generate structured data.\n\n```py\nfrom guardrails import Guard\nimport openai\n\nprompt = \"\"\"\n    What kind of pet should I get and what should I name it?\n\n    ${gr.complete_json_suffix_v2}\n\"\"\"\nguard = Guard.for_pydantic(output_class=Pet, prompt=prompt)\n\nraw_output, validated_output, *rest = guard(\n    llm_api=openai.completions.create,\n    engine=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct\"\n)\n\nprint(validated_output)\n```\n\nThis prints: \n```\n{\n    \"pet_type\": \"dog\",\n    \"name\": \"Buddy\n}\n```\n\n### Guardrails Server\n\nGuardrails can be set up as a standalone service served by Flask with `guardrails start`, allowing you to interact with it via a REST API. This approach simplifies development and deployment of Guardrails-powered applications.\n\n1. Install: `pip install \"guardrails-ai\"`\n2. Configure: `guardrails configure`\n3. Create a config: `guardrails create --validators=hub://guardrails/two_words --name=two-word-guard`\n4. Start the dev server: `guardrails start --config=./config.py`\n5. Interact with the dev server via the snippets below\n```\n# with the guardrails client\nimport guardrails as gr\n\ngr.settings.use_server = True\nguard = gr.Guard(name='two-word-guard')\nguard.validate('this is more than two words')\n\n# or with the openai sdk\nimport openai\nopenai.base_url = \"http://localhost:8000/guards/two-word-guard/openai/v1/\"\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = \"youropenaikey\"\n\nmessages = [\n        {\n            \"role\": \"user\",\n            \"content\": \"tell me about an apple with 3 words exactly\",\n        },\n    ]\n\ncompletion = openai.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4o-mini\",\n    messages=messages,\n)\n```\n\nFor production deployments, we recommend using Docker with Gunicorn as the WSGI server for improved performance and scalability. \n\n## FAQ\n\n#### I'm running into issues with Guardrails.
