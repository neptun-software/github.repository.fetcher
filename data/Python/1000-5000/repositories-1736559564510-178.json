          "content": "# Contributing to `trlX`\n\nLooking to improve `trlX`? Thanks for considering!\n\nThere are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials in [Colab notebooks](https://colab.research.google.com) to improving the project's [documentation](https://trlx.readthedocs.io), submitting bug reports and feature requests, or even implementing new features themselves. See the outstanding [issues](https://github.com/CarperAI/trlx/issues) for ideas on where to begin.\n\nHere are some guidelines to help you get started 🚀.\n\n## Submitting a bug report or a feature request¶\n\nTo submit a bug report or a feature request, please open an [issue](https://github.com/CarperAI/trlx/issues) by clicking on the `New Issue` button and selecting the respective issue template. Make sure to fill out all the required information and provide as much detail as possible. For bug reports, this means including a minimal code example that reproduces the bug, and for feature requests, it means providing a clear and detailed description of the feature you would like to see implemented.\n\n## Submitting code\n\n> **Note**: Make sure to first search through the [issue tracker](https://github.com/CarperAI/trlx/issues) and [PR list](https://github.com/CarperAI/trlx/pulls) to avoid duplicating work. If you want to work on a non-trivial feature, we highly recommended that you first open an issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/CarperAI/trlx/issues) to get feedback from core developers.\n\nFollow these steps to start contributing code:\n\n1. Create your own [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) of the repository and clone it to your local machine.\n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/<YOUR-USERNAME>/trlx.git\n    cd trlx\n    git remote add upstream https://github.com/CarperAI/trlx.git\n    ```\n2. Create a new branch for your changes and give it a concise name that reflects your contribution.\n    ```bash\n    git checkout -b <BRANCH-NAME>\n    ```\n2. Install the development dependencies in a Python environment.\n    ```bash\n    pip install -e \".[dev]\"\n    pre-commit install\n    ```\n4. Implement your changes. Make small, independent, and well documented commits along the way (check out [these](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/) tips).\n5. Add unit tests whenever appropriate and ensure that the tests pass. To run the entire test suite, use the following command from within the project root directory.\n    ```bash\n    pytest\n    ```\n    For changes with minimal project scope (e.g. a simple bug fix), you might want to run the unit tests for just a specific test file instead:\n    ```bash\n    pytest -vv -k \"<TEST-FILE-NAME>\"\n    ```\n5. Commit your final changes. Our `pre-commit` hooks will automatically run before each commit and will prevent you from committing code that does not pass our style and linter checks. They'll also automatically format your code! To run these manually, use the following command:\n    ```bash\n    pre-commit run --all-files\n    ```\n\n6. Push the changes to your fork.\n\nFinally ... 🥁 ... Create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) to the `trlX` repository! Make sure to include a description of your changes and link to any relevant issues.\n\n> __Tip__: If you're looking to introduce an experimental feature, we suggest testing the behavior of your proposed feature on some of the existing [examples](https://github.com/CarperAI/trlx/tree/master/examples), such as [random walks](https://github.com/CarperAI/trlx/blob/master/examples/randomwalks). This will help you get a better sense of how the feature would work in practice and will also help you identify any potential flaws in the implementation.\n\n## Asking questions\n\nHave a question? Rather than opening an issue, you can readily chat with the core team on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/canadagoose).\n\n## Code of conduct\n\nThis project adheres to the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://github.com/CarperAI/trlx/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

For models beyond 20B parameters, trlX provides [NVIDIA NeMo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo)-backed trainers that leverage efficient parallelism techniques to scale effectively.\n\nThe following RL algorithms are currently implemented:\n\n| Algorithm                                                                     | Accelerate Trainer | NeMo Trainer  |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------:|:-------------:|\n| [Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.08593.pdf)    | ✅                 | ✅            |\n| [Implicit Language Q-Learning (ILQL)](https://sea-snell.github.io/ILQL_site/) | ✅                 | ✅            |\n\n📖 **[Documentation](https://trlX.readthedocs.io)**\n\n🧀 **[CHEESE](https://github.com/carperai/cheese)** Collect human annotations for your RL application with our human-in-the-loop data collection library.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/CarperAI/trlx.git\ncd trlx\npip install torch --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118\npip install -e .\n```\n\n## Examples\n\nFor more usage see [examples](./examples). You can also try the colab notebooks below:\n| Description | Link |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n| Simulacra (GPT2, ILQL) | [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/CarperAI/trlx/blob/main/examples/notebooks/trlx_simulacra.ipynb)|\n| Sentiment (GPT2, ILQL) | [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/CarperAI/trlx/blob/main/examples/notebooks/trlx_sentiments.ipynb)|\n\nLatest runs of the examples are on our [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/sorry/trlx-references/reportlist)\n\n## How to Train\n\nYou can train a model using a reward function or a reward-labeled dataset.\n\n#### Using a reward function\n\n```python\ntrainer = trlx.train('gpt2', reward_fn=lambda samples, **kwargs: [sample.count('cats') for sample in samples])\n```\n\nFor **reward model** training refer to our [autocrit](https://github.com/CarperAI/autocrit) library.\n\n#### Using a reward-labeled dataset\n\n```python\ntrainer = trlx.train('EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B', samples=['dolphins', 'geese'], rewards=[1.0, 100.0])\n```\n\n#### Using a prompt-completion dataset\n\n```python\ntrainer = trlx.train('gpt2', samples=[['Question: 1 + 2 Answer:', '3'], ['Question: Solve this equation: ∀n>0, s=2, sum(n ** -s). Answer:', '(pi ** 2)/ 6']])\n```\n\n#### Trainers provide a wrapper over their underlying model\n\n```python\ntrainer.generate(**tokenizer('Q: Who rules the world? A:', return_tensors='pt'), do_sample=True)\n```\n\n#### Configure Hyperparameters\n\n```python\nfrom trlx.data.default_configs import default_ppo_config\n\nconfig = default_ppo_config()\nconfig.model.model_path = 'EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b'\nconfig.tokenizer.tokenizer_path = 'EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b'\nconfig.train.seq_length = 2048\n\ntrainer = trlx.train(config=config, reward_fn=lambda samples, **kwargs: [len(sample) for sample in samples])\n```\nTo reduce memory usage (if you're experiencing CUDA Out of Memory errors), first try the lowest setting for the following hyperparameters and eventually increase them:\n```python\n# micro batch size per gpu\nconfig.train.batch_size = 1\n# freeze all transformer layers\nconfig.model.num_layers_unfrozen = 0\n# maximum sample length, prompts or samples longer than that will be truncated\nconfig.train.seq_length = 128\n\n# micro batch size for sampling (specific for PPO)\nconfig.method.chunk_size = 1\n# use an additional Q-head (specific for ILQL)\nconfig.method.two_qs = False\n```\n\n#### Save the resulting model to a Hugging Face pretrained language model. (Ready to upload to the Hub!)\n\n```python\ntrainer.save_pretrained('/path/to/output/folder/')\n```\n\n#### Use 🤗 Accelerate to launch distributed training\n\n```bash\naccelerate config # choose DeepSpeed option\naccelerate launch examples/simulacra.py\n```\n\n#### Use NeMo-Megatron to launch distributed training\n\nFollow the setup instructions in the [NeMo README](./trlx/models/).\n\n```bash\npython examples/nemo_ilql_sentiments.py\n```\n\nFor more usage see the [NeMo README](./trlx/models)\n\n#### Use Ray Tune to launch hyperparameter sweep\n\n```bash\nray start --head --port=6379\npython -m trlx.sweep --config configs/sweeps/ppo_sweep.yml --accelerate_config configs/accelerate/ddp.yaml --num_gpus 4 examples/ppo_sentiments.py\n```\n\n#### Benchmark your trlX fork against trlX's `main` branch\n```bash\npython -m trlx.reference octocat/trlx-fork:fix-branch\n```\n\n## Logging\n\ntrlX uses the standard Python `logging` library to log training information to the console. The default logger is set to the `INFO` level, which means that `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, and `CRITICAL` level messages will be printed to standard output.\n\nTo change the log level directly, you can use the verbosity setter. For example, to set the log level to `WARNING` use:\n\n```python\nimport trlx\n\ntrlx.logging.set_verbosity(trlx.logging.WARNING)\n```\n\nThis will suppress `INFO` level messages, but still print `WARNING`, `ERROR`, and `CRITICAL` level messages.\n\nYou can also control logging verbosity by setting the `TRLX_VERBOSITY` environment variable to one of the standard logging [level names](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging-levels):\n\n- `CRITICAL` (`trlx.logging.CRITICAL`)\n- `ERROR` (`trlx.logging.ERROR`)\n- `WARNING` (`trlx.logging.WARNING`)\n- `INFO` (`trlx.logging.INFO`)\n- `DEBUG` (`trlx.logging.DEBUG`)\n\n```sh\nexport TRLX_VERBOSITY=WARNING\n```\n\nBy default, [`tqdm`](https://tqdm.github.io/docs/tqdm/) progress bars are used to display training progress. You can disable them by calling `trlx.logging.disable_progress_bar()`, otherwise `trlx.logging.enable_progress_bar()` to enable.\n\nMessages can be formatted with greater detail by setting `trlx.logging.enable_explicit_format()`. This will inject call-site information into each log which may be helpful for debugging.\n\n```sh\n[2023-01-01 05:00:00,000] [INFO] [ppo_orchestrator.py:63:make_experience] [RANK 0] Message...\n```\n\n> 💡 Tip: To reduce the amount of logging output, you might find it helpful to change log levels of third-party libraries used by trlX. For example, try adding `transformers.logging.set_verbosity_error()` to the top of your trlX scripts to silence verbose messages from the `transformers` library (see their [logging docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/logging#logging) for more details).\n\n## Contributing\n\nFor development check out these [guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md)\nand also read our [docs](https://trlX.readthedocs.io)\n\n## Citing trlX\n\n```\n@inproceedings{havrilla-etal-2023-trlx,\n    title = \"trl{X}: A Framework for Large Scale Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback\",\n    author = \"Havrilla, Alexander  and\n      Zhuravinskyi, Maksym  and\n      Phung, Duy  and\n      Tiwari, Aman  and\n      Tow, Jonathan  and\n      Biderman, Stella  and\n      Anthony, Quentin  and\n      Castricato, Louis\",\n    booktitle = \"Proceedings of the 2023 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\",\n    month = dec,\n    year = \"2023\",\n    address = \"Singapore\",\n    publisher = \"Association for Computational Linguistics\",\n    url = \"https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-main.530\",\n    doi = \"10.18653/v1/2023.emnlp-main.530\",\n    pages = \"8578--8595\",\n}\n```\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nMany thanks to Leandro von Werra for contributing with [trl](https://github.com/lvwerra/trl/), a library that initially inspired this repo.\n"
