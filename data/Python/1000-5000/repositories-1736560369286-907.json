          "content": "## UPDATE\n- **Internet search support**: you can enable **internet search** capability in Gradio application and Discord bot. For gradio, there is a `internet mode` option in the control panel. For discord, you need to specify `--internet` option in your prompt. For both cases, you need a Serper API Key which you can get one from [serper.dev](https://serper.dev/). By signing up, you will get free 2,500 free google searches which is pretty much sufficient for a long-term test.\n- **Discord Bot support**: you can serve any model from the model zoo as Discord Bot. Find how to do this in the instruction section below.\n\n# 💬🚀 LLM as a Chatbot Service\n\nThe purpose of this repository is to let people to use lots of open sourced instruction-following fine-tuned LLM models as a Chatbot service. Because different models behave differently, and different models require differently formmated prompts, I made a very simple library [`Ping Pong`](https://github.com/deep-diver/PingPong) for model agnostic conversation and context managements. \n\nAlso, I made [`GradioChat`](https://github.com/deep-diver/gradio-chat) UI that has a similar shape to [HuggingChat](https://huggingface.co/chat/) but entirely built in Gradio. Those two projects are fully integrated to power this project. \n\n## Easiest way to try out ( ✅ Gradio, 🚧 Discord Bot )\n\n### Jarvislabs.ai\n\nThis project has become the one of the default framework at [jarvislabs.ai](https://jarvislabs.ai/). Jarvislabs.ai is one of the cloud GPU VM provider with the cheapest GPU prices. Furthermore, all the weights of the supported popular open source LLMs are pre-downloaded. You don't need to waste of your money and time to wait until download hundreds of GBs to try out a collection of LLMs. In less than 10 minutes, you can try out any model. \n- for further instruction how to run Gradio application, please follow the [official documentation](https://jarvislabs.ai/docs/llmchat) on the `llmchat` framework.\n\n### dstack\n\n[`dstack`](https://dstack.ai) is an open-source tool that allows to run LLM-based apps in a a cloud of your choice via single command. `dstack` supports AWS, GCP, Azure, Lambda Cloud, etc.\n\nUse the `gradio.dstack.yml` and `discord.dstack.yml` configurations to run the Gradio app and Discord bot via `dstack`.\n- for more details on how to run this repo with `dstack`, read the [official documentation](https://dstack.ai/examples/llmchat) by `dstack`.\n\n## Instructions\n\n### Standalone Gradio app\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/gW7yKj9/2023-05-26-3-31-06.png)\n\n0. Prerequisites\n\n    Note that the code only works `Python >= 3.9` and `gradio >= 3.32.0`\n\n    ```console\n    $ conda create -n llm-serve python=3.9\n    $ conda activate llm-serve\n    ```\n\n1. Install dependencies. \n    ```console\n    $ cd LLM-As-Chatbot\n    $ pip install -r requirements.txt\n    ```\n\n2. Run Gradio application\n\n    There is no required parameter to run the Gradio application. However, there are some small details worth being noted. When `--local-files-only` is set, application won't try to look up the Hugging Face Hub(remote). Instead, it will only use the files already downloaded and cached.\n\n    Hugging Face libraries stores downloaded contents under `~/.cache` by default, and this application assumes so. However, if you downloaded weights in different location for some reasons, you can set `HF_HOME` environment variable. Find more about the [environment variables here](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/package_reference/environment_variables)\n\n   In order to leverage **internet search** capability, you need Serper API Key. You can set it manually in the control panel or in CLI. When specifying the Serper API Key in CLI, it will be injected into the corresponding UI control. If you don't have it yet, please get one from [serper.dev](https://serper.dev/). By signing up, you will get free 2,500 free google searches which is pretty much sufficient for a long-term test.\n\n    ```console\n    $ python app.py --root-path \"\" \\\n                    --local-files-only \\\n                    --share \\\n                    --debug \\\n                    --serper-api-key \"YOUR SERPER API KEY\"\n    ```\n\n### Discord Bot\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/cJ3yDWh/2023-07-14-1-42-23.png)\n\n0. Prerequisites\n\n    Note that the code only works `Python >= 3.9` \n\n    ```console\n    $ conda create -n llm-serve python=3.9\n    $ conda activate llm-serve\n    ```\n\n1. Install dependencies. \n    ```console\n    $ cd LLM-As-Chatbot\n    $ pip install -r requirements.txt\n    ```\n\n2. Run Discord Bot application. Choose one of the modes in `--mode-[cpu|mps|8bit|4bit|full-gpu]`. `full-gpu` will be choseon by default(`full` means `half` - consider this as a typo to be fixed later).\n\n    The `--token` is a required parameter, and you can get it from [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro). If you have not setup Discord Bot from the Discord Developer Portal yet, please follow [How to Create a Discord Bot Account](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-discord-bot-with-python/) section of the tutorial from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) to get the token.\n\n    The `--model-name` is a required parameter, and you can look around the list of supported models from [`model_cards.json`](https://github.com/deep-diver/LLM-As-Chatbot/blob/main/model_cards.json).\n\n    `--max-workers` is a parameter to determine how many requests to be handled concurrently. This simply defines the value of the `ThreadPoolExecutor`.\n\n    When `--local-files-only` is set, application won't try to look up the Hugging Face Hub(remote). Instead, it will only use the files already downloaded and cached.\n\n   In order to leverage **internet search** capability, you need Serper API Key. If you don't have it yet, please get one from [serper.dev](https://serper.dev/). By signing up, you will get free 2,500 free google searches which is pretty much sufficient for a long-term test. Once you have the Serper API Key, you can specify it in `--serper-api-key` option.\n   \n    - Hugging Face libraries stores downloaded contents under `~/.cache` by default, and this application assumes so. However, if you downloaded weights in different location for some reasons, you can set `HF_HOME` environment variable. Find more about the [environment variables here](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/package_reference/environment_variables)    \n\n    ```console\n    $ python discord_app.py --token \"DISCORD BOT TOKEN\" \\\n                            --model-name \"alpaca-lora-7b\" \\\n                            --max-workers 1 \\\n                            --mode-[cpu|mps|8bit|4bit|full-gpu] \\\n                            --local_files_only \\\n                            --serper-api-key \"YOUR SERPER API KEY\"\n    ```\n\n4. Supported Discord Bot commands\n\n    There is no slash commands. The only way to interact with the deployed discord bot is to mention the bot. However, you can pass some special strings while mentioning the bot.\n\n    - **`@bot_name help`**: it will display a simple help message\n    - **`@bot_name model-info`**: it will display the information of the currently selected(deployed) model from the [`model_cards.json`](https://github.com/deep-diver/LLM-As-Chatbot/blob/main/model_cards.json).\n    - **`@bot_name default-params`**: it will display the default parameters to be used in model's `generate` method. That is `GenerationConfig`, and it holds parameters such as `temperature`, `top_p`, and so on.\n    - **`@bot_name user message --max-new-tokens 512 --temperature 0.9 --top-p 0.75 --do_sample --max-windows 5 --internet`**: all parameters are used to dynamically determine the text geneartion behaviour as in `GenerationConfig` except `max-windows`. The `max-windows` determines how many past conversations to look up as a reference. The default value is set to `3`, but as the conversation goes long, you can increase this value. `--internet` will try to answer to your prompt by aggregating information scraped from google search. To use `--internet` option, you need to specify `--serper-api-key` when booting up the program.\n\n### Context management\n\nDifferent model might have different strategies to manage context, so if you want to know the exact strategies applied to each model, take a look at the [`chats`](https://github.com/deep-diver/LLM-As-Chatbot/tree/main/chats) directory. However, here are the basic ideas that I have come up with initially. I have found long prompts will slow down the generation process a lot eventually, so I thought the prompts should be kept as short as possible while as concise as possible at the same time. In the previous version, I have accumulated all the past conversations, and that didn't go well.\n\n- In every turn of the conversation, the past `N` conversations will be kept. Think about the `N` as a hyper-parameter. As an experiment, currently the past 2-3 conversations are only kept for all models.\n\n### Currently supported models\n\n<details><summary>Checkout the list of models</summary>\n\n  - [tloen/alpaca-lora-7b](https://huggingface.co/tloen/alpaca-lora-7b): the original 7B Alpaca-LoRA checkpoint by tloen (updated by 4/4/2022)\n  - [LLMs/Alpaca-LoRA-7B-elina](https://huggingface.co/LLMs/Alpaca-LoRA-7B-elina): the 7B Alpaca-LoRA checkpoint by Chansung (updated by 5/1/2022)\n  - [LLMs/Alpaca-LoRA-13B-elina](https://huggingface.co/LLMs/Alpaca-LoRA-13B-elina): the 13B Alpaca-LoRA checkpoint by Chansung (updated by 5/1/2022)\n  - [LLMs/Alpaca-LoRA-30B-elina](https://huggingface.co/LLMs/Alpaca-LoRA-30B-elina): the 30B Alpaca-LoRA checkpoint by Chansung (updated by 5/1/2022)\n  - [LLMs/Alpaca-LoRA-65B-elina](https://huggingface.co/LLMs/Alpaca-LoRA-65B-elina): the 65B Alpaca-LoRA checkpoint by Chansung (updated by 5/1/2022)\n  - [LLMs/AlpacaGPT4-LoRA-7B-elina](https://huggingface.co/LLMs/AlpacaGPT4-LoRA-7B-elina): the 7B Alpaca-LoRA checkpoint trained on GPT4 generated Alpaca style dataset by Chansung (updated by 5/1/2022)\n  - [LLMs/AlpacaGPT4-LoRA-13B-elina](https://huggingface.co/LLMs/AlpacaGPT4-LoRA-13B-elina): the 13B Alpaca-LoRA checkpoint trained on GPT4 generated Alpaca style dataset by Chansung (updated by 5/1/2022)\n  - [stabilityai/stablelm-tuned-alpha-7b](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stablelm-tuned-alpha-7b): StableLM based fine-tuned model\n  - [beomi/KoAlpaca-Polyglot-12.8B](https://huggingface.co/beomi/KoAlpaca-Polyglot-12.8B): [Polyglot](https://github.com/EleutherAI/polyglot) based Alpaca style instruction fine-tuned model\n  - [declare-lab/flan-alpaca-xl](https://huggingface.co/declare-lab/flan-alpaca-xl): Flan XL(3B) based Alpaca style instruction fine-tuned model.\n  - [declare-lab/flan-alpaca-xxl](https://huggingface.co/declare-lab/flan-alpaca-xxl): Flan XXL(11B) based Alpaca style instruction fine-tuned model.\n  - [OpenAssistant/stablelm-7b-sft-v7-epoch-3](https://huggingface.co/OpenAssistant/stablelm-7b-sft-v7-epoch-3): StableLM(7B) based OpenAssistant's oasst1 instruction fine-tuned model.\n  - [Writer/camel-5b-hf](https://huggingface.co/Writer/camel-5b-hf): Palmyra-base based instruction fine-tuned model.

Watching him play made my day!\\n- On another occasion, during dinner at a seafood restaurant called \\\"Off the Hook\\\" in Ko Olina, there was this lovely mermaid swimming around us (yes, seriously!). The staff arranged for a real life mermaid to serenade diners which added such a unique whimsical ambiance to the atmosphere. It felt like a fairy tale come true. Guests were encouraged to ask questions and take photos with the mermaid who later surfaced with a bouquet of flowers. How cool is that?!\\n- We also went hiking at Napali Coast State Wilderness Park. Words cannot express the beauty of nature here. Imagine steep sea cliffs rising over 6000 feet above the Pacific Ocean, with emerald valleys plunging to the sea below, blanketed by a vibrant tapestry of rainforest foliage. There will never be another place like it on earth, nor should there ever be. Preserving its natural state is critical to protecting this fragile ecosystem and preserving its priceless beauty for future generations to enjoy.\\n- Last but certainly not least, Haleakalā National Park on the Island of Maui provided countless photo opportunities against a majestic volcanic crater backdrop. The 10 mile road leading up to the top offers diverse geological formations and changing weather conditions, making each visit unique. While driving through the clouds towards the summit, we encountered brilliant sunshine followed by torrential rains, then foggy conditions - all within minutes! A little taste of what lies ahead in the unpredictable world beyond our control.\\nIn summary, traveling to foreign places exposes us to new customs, traditions, culinary delights, and firsthand encounters with distinct cultures unknown or forgotten elsewhere. These enriching experiences leave long lasting impressions leaving us wiser, more mindful, and grateful for the richness of diversity in our beloved planet. Thank you Hawaii for your warm hospitality, memorable moments, and unforgettable memories.

My top pick would have to be our visit to the island of Kauai, home to iconic natural landmarks such as the Napali Coast, which was truly spectacular. The Na Pali Cliffs stretch over two thousand feet above sea level while providing impressive views of the Pacific Ocean below. It felt almost otherworldly seeing these cliffs rise straight up out of the ocean; I can hardly believe they exist in reality at all! Other memorable stops included Oahu, where we toured Pearl Harbor; Molokai with its lush greenery, waterfalls, and untamed nature; Lana'i with its unique flora and fauna; and Haleakala National Park, where we marveled at incredible vistas of the mountain range. We even managed to take part in traditional luaus, hiking volcanos, and snorkeling amidst colorful fishes and corals - needless to say, each day brought us new surprises and fresh adventures.

Here’s a glimpse into some of the amazing cultural experiences you can have on your own journey to Hawaii.\\n\\nFirst stop on our itinerary was Pearl Harbor, where we visited the USS Arizona Memorial and paid respects to those who lost their lives during the infamous attack in 1941. The memorial sits atop the sunken USS Arizona battleship and provides visitors with a moving and educational look into history. We also had the opportunity to visit the Battleship Missouri Memorial, which served as the site of Japan’s surrender following World War II. Seeing these historical sites gave us a deeper understanding and appreciation for the sacrifices made by so many.\\n\\nIn addition to learning about Hawaii’s storied past, we were able to immerse ourselves in its thriving present through various cultural activities and events. One such activity was attending a traditional Hula performance held nightly at the hotel. This dance form, which dates back centuries, tells stories and celebrates Hawaii’s history, customs, and values. It’s truly mesmerizing to watch and another way to appreciate the unique beauty and essence of Hawaiian identity. Another must-do while in Hawaii? Visiting one (or all) of the several outdoor markets like the farmers market or art fairs showcasing local products and crafts. These are great places to sample delicious Hawaiian cuisines and purchase souvenirs that will remind you of your incredible trip long after you return home.\\n\\nAside from cultural immersion, there are plenty of other breathtaking spots worth checking out across the islands. For instance, the stunning Nani Mau Gardens, located just outside of Lahaina, boasts over 250 varieties of orchids spread throughout five different garden areas, set against the backdrop of West Maui Mountains. Also, take time to explore Waimea Canyon – known as “the grand canyon of the pacific” -it offers jaw-dropping views, waterfalls, botanical gardens and hiking trails for every level of fitness. And let’s not forget to try the famous Spam musubi, a tasty meatball wrapped in seaweed!\\n\\nAll in all, our trip to Hawaii left us with a lifetime of memories, full bellies, and a deep appreciation for the indigenous cultures and natural wonders that make this place so special.

These include:\\n\\n1. Physical accessibility: The physical infrastructure of the transportation system must be designed with accessibility in mind, including ramps, lifts, elevators, and other features that make it easier for people with disabilities to board and ride vehicles. This may also involve modifications to stations and stops to ensure they can accommodate everyone.\\n2. Communications accessibility: Ensuring that all communication systems used by the transportation provider (e.g., website, customer service lines) are fully accessible is critical. This includes providing alternative formats such as braille or large print materials where necessary.\\n3. Staff training: All staff who interact with passengers on a regular basis should receive training on how to provide appropriate assistance to individuals with different needs. They should learn about various assistive devices and techniques available to help passengers navigate the system, including wheelchairs, walkers, hearing aids, etc.\\n4. Designated spaces: Creating designated spaces for individuals using mobility aids, seniors, families with young children, pregnant women, or any group that might benefit from priority seating areas during peak hours will improve overall comfort level while traveling.\\n5. Signage and Wayfinding: Clear signage throughout the entire transit network, clear maps, and wayfinding tools like digital maps/apps or audio directions can help those with visual impairments or difficulties reading maps find their way around. Additionally, real-time information displayed at bus shelters or through mobile apps allows riders to track schedules, predict arrival times, and choose the most convenient route.\\n6. Accommodating unique requirements : Public transportation providers should work closely with local community groups representing diverse populations to identify specific needs and challenges faced by these communities. It’s important to understand individual needs so accommodative measures can be made accordingly to cater to them. For instance, if there is a significant number of visually impaired users within the community, adding Braille signs, high contrast color schemes and tactile strips on platform edges could be beneficial\"\n      ]\n    ],\n    \"example4\": [\n      [\n        \"Write a python program to print the first 10 Fibonacci numbers\",\n        \"Here is one way you could write a Python program to print the first 10 Fibonacci numbers using recursion:\\n\\n```python\\ndef fib(n):\\n   if n <= 1:\\n       return n\\n   else:\\n       return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)\\nfor i in range(1, 11):\\n   print(fib(i))\\n```\\nThis code defines a function fib that takes an integer n as input and returns the n-th Fibonacci number by calling itself recursively with two smaller values until it reaches the starting conditions of n = 1, at which point it returns just the value n.

Well, look no further than Hawaii. I recently had the chance to visit this stunning archipelago and was amazed at how it exceeded my expectations. In this article, I'll share some of my favorite memories from my trip, along with tips for planning your own adventure to these beautiful islands.\\n\\nMust-See Attractions\\nThe first thing on my list was the famous Diamond Head Crater in Honolulu. This volcanic tuff cone has become a symbol of Oahu, offering panoramic views of Waikiki Beach below. It's also a popular spot for hikers looking to get their cardio workout in while taking in the scenery. Be sure to pack water and wear comfortable shoes, as the hike can be steep in parts.\\n\\nAnother attraction not to be missed is the Polynesian Cultural Center. Located on the North Shore of Oahu, this educational center showcases the culture and traditions of Pacific Islanders through performances, demonstrations, and hands-on activities. You can learn about traditional dances, crafts, music, and even try some delicious food. Plus, it's family-friendly and offers discounted tickets for children under age 12.\\n\\nLocal Cuisine and Culture\\nOne of the best ways to experience a new place is through its food. And let me tell you, Hawaiian cuisine does not disappoint. From poke bowls to loco moco, there are so many unique and mouthwatering options to choose from. One of my favorites was Lau Yee Chau Kitchen, located in Chinatown, which serves up some of the best dim sum around.\\n\\nBut beyond just eating, experiencing the local culture means immersing yourself in daily life. For example, one day we wandered into a farmer's market and were treated to live Hawaiian music, fresh produce, and even artwork made from coconut shells. These kinds of moments will stay with you long after you return home.\\n\\nConclusion\\nIn conclusion, Hawaii is truly a gem of the Pacific, offering something for everyone. Whether you're a beach bum, outdoor enthusiast, history buff, or culinary connoisseur, there's something here for you. So why wait? Start planning your own journey to this magical destination today!\"\n      ]\n    ],\n    \"example2\": [\n      [\n        \"Can you help me write a resignation letter to my current employer, while leaving on good terms and expressing gratitude for the opportunities provided?\",\n        \"Dear [Employer],\\n\\nI am writing this letter to inform you of my decision to leave my position at your company effective [resignation date].

Communication Accessibility: Real-time information should be provided in multiple formats (e.g., audio, visual, Braille) to ensure access for all users, particularly those who are deaf or hard of hearing. Captions and live subtitles can also assist riders with speech impairments or language barriers.\\n3. Social Inclusion: Public transportation systems should strive to reduce social isolation by fostering a welcoming environment for everyone, regardless of their background or socioeconomic status. This includes providing low-income fare options, outreach programs to underserved communities, and culturally sensitive staff training.\\n4.

Physical Accessibility - Ensure that vehicles and stations are designed with access in mind for people of all ages and abilities. This includes features such as ramps or lifts for wheelchair users, high-contrast signage, Braille lettering, audible directions, priority seating and easy-to-use handrails. Additionally, ensure routes have wide sidewalks, crossings with audio cues, clear pedestrian signals, and designated drop-off points.\\n2. Universal Design Principles - Apply universal design principles to create a transportation system where everyone can use it easily and efficiently without any barriers. By making modifications to your existing system based on specific needs (e.g., those who require mobility assistance devices), you will be able to provide equal opportunities for all riders.\\n3. Inclusivity - Ensuring that every rider has equitable treatment involves providing services tailored to meet different needs. For instance, you might add elevators at subway stops specifically for passengers using strollers, offer more frequent buses or modified vehicles to accommodate seniors, expand paratransit options for disabled individuals, and reduce fares for low-income residents.\\n4. Multimodal Approach - Develop transport systems that combine multiple modes instead of relying solely on one type of vehicle.

You also mention potential future openings available afterward but provide no specific details about when they might occur since flexibility is important. Additionally, you don't address what specifically led up to your departure, which could make the transition feel sudden rather than gradual. Finally, the tone is formal yet respectful instead of casual and direct. This type of letter provides strong signals to recruiters that you want them to keep contacting you even though things aren't quite right.\"\n      ]\n    ],\n    \"example3\": [\n      [\n        \"What factors would you consider when designing an inclusive and accessible public transportation system?\",\n        \"Inclusion: Consider the needs of people with disabilities, seniors, elderly individuals, children, and others who may not have access to modern technology or infrastructure for travel options such as buses, trains, subways, etc.\\n\\nAccessibility: Ensure that all modes of transportation are easily accessible by wheelchairs/walkers if necessary; ensure there's ample parking spaces available at each station so everyone has somewhere safe to ride their vehicles (e.g., side streets); provide alternative means of payment like cashless payments via contactless cards instead of physical money in order to make it more affordable for those without bank accounts or credit card balances; ensure that transit workers receive proper training on how to handle these types of issues should they arise.\\n\\nCost-effectiveness: The cost per person could be lower than traditional methods of transportation especially considering the high number of riders using this mode of transportation which can lead to higher ticket prices overall compared to other forms of transportation like cars or airplanes. This will also reduce government revenue spent on taxicab companies since many governments spend large amounts of their budgets on providing free transportation services today but don't necessarily use them often enough to justify spending much time and resources improving upon them.\\n\\nSimplicity: In addition to accessibility concerns above, simplicity matters because every additional step someone must take to get from point A to B increases the amount of friction involved making it less likely that anyone will do it. For example, having multiple stops along the way requires a lot more effort and mental energy just to figure out where one stop ends versus another start whereas walking might only require two steps even though both still involve some form of movement. Simpler systems tend to perform better and therefore need fewer resources to operate effectively.\"\n      ]\n    ],\n    \"example4\": [\n      [\n        \"Write a python program to print the first 10 Fibonacci numbers\",\n        \"Sure, here's an example Python program that calculates the first ten Fibonacci numbers:\\n\\n```python\\n def fib(n):\\n    if n <= 2:\\n       return 1\\n    else:\\n        return (fib(n-1) + fib(n-2))\\n\\n for i in range(10):\\n     print(fib(i), end=\\\" \\\")\\n```\\nThis program uses recursion to calculate each number in the sequence, using the formula F_n = F_(n-1) + F_(n-2). The function starts by checking if the input value of n is less than or equal to two, since these values are already known. If not, it calls itself recursively with smaller values of n, until it reaches the base case where n=1. At this point, it returns the result of adding the previous two results together.

Pearl Harbor: This was such an impactful experience that everyone should have the chance to see. It's hard to imagine what life was like there during World War II, but you can really get a sense of how much history this place holds. Make sure to take a tour with a knowledgeable guide who will tell you stories about the events of that day.\\n\\n2. USS Arizona Memorial: If you only do one thing while in Oahu, make it this memorial. You'll feel a mix of emotions as you walk through the rows of names on the wall, remembering those who lost their lives onboard this ship. Be prepared to spend at least 30 minutes here, if not longer.\\n\\n3. North Shore: For surfers and sun worshippers alike, the north shore of Oahu is a must-visit destination. Watch the pros catch massive waves or try your hand (and feet) at surfing yourself. There are plenty of places to rent boards and lessons available for beginners.\\n\\n4. Diamond Head Crater Trail: Get amazing views of Waikiki and the surrounding area by climbing up to the top of Diamond Head crater. It's an easy hike with great signage along the way. Once you reach the summit, you can explore the park and even check out the old observatory building.\\n\\n5. Halona Blowhole: Located near Kaimana Beach, this blowhole is pretty cool to watch. As the ocean crashes against the lava rock formation, water shoots straight up into the air creating a geyser effect. Just keep an eye on the tide schedule because the best viewing times depend on when the sea is high or low.\\n\\nOverall, I highly recommend taking advantage of everything Hawaii has to offer - from its stunning natural landscapes to its vibrant local culture.

You can watch authentic dance performances, learn craft making skills like tattoo designs or bone carving, participate in hands-on activities, take a guided tour around the villages, dive deep into history and folklore stories. It was fascinating seeing people from all over the world come together to celebrate different cultures under one roof.\\n\\n2.Hike Through Haleakala National Park: One thing I really enjoyed doing on Maui was hiking through Haleakalā National Park. Not only did it provide breathtaking views of the volcanic crater but also a great chance to explore the diverse flora and fauna of the area including rare endemic species such as Silverswords and Lichenophrys johnstoni fern tree.\\n\\n3.Learn About History at Pearl Harbor Memorial: Honolulu’s famous Waikiki Beach may get all the attention these days, but not too far away lies an ominous yet significant site – PEARL HARBOR MEMORIAL. With its somber atmosphere, memorial, and exhibits commemorates the infamous Japanese attack on December 7th during WWII which led to America entry into World War II with honor. We visited the USS Arizona Memorial, which features a moving documentary film and boat ride along the battleship.\\n\\n4.Sample Local Cuisines - \\\"Plantation Village\\\": In ancient times, sugarcane plantations thrived throughout Hawaiian islands and became one of the primary drivers of economic growth. Today, visitors can experience a taste of those times by taking a stroll down Plantation Village located near the airport. Here, guests can browse various gift shops selling handmade goods made by locals, have fun riding mini trains or boats, and sample local cuisine from restaurants serving popular dishes like plate lunches (combination platter), chicken katsu sandwiches, kalua pork sliders, or poke bowls using fresh raw fish. These dining establishments serve as social hubs where people meet and enjoy each other’s company, sharing food and drinks while listening to music.\\n\\n5.Spend Time in Volcanoes National Park: Kīlauea volcano has been erupting constantly since January 2018 creating new landforms and attracting photographers who want to capture stunning scenery from vantage points above lava flows. But aside from witnessing nature at work, there are plenty of things to do inside the park as well. Guides lead treks to the summit of Mauna Loa, biological research stations offer educational programs, the Thomas A.

My recent trip to Oahu was nothing short of amazing, as I explored both natural wonders and vibrant local communities. Here are some of my favorite moments from the trip!\\n\\nMy first stop on the trip was Honolulu, where I had the opportunity to visit Pearl Harbor National Memorial. This site commemorates the attack on December 7th, 1941, which marked America's entry into World War II. The museum here is truly breathtaking, with exhibits that tell the story of the events leading up to the attack, as well as artifacts and memorials honoring those who lost their lives in service. It was a powerful experience, and one I highly recommend for anyone interested in history or military culture.\\n\\nAnother incredible aspect of Hawaiian culture that I got to explore were the luaus. These traditional feasts are not just delicious – they also offer a unique glimpse into Hawaiian customs, music, and dance. At the King Kamehameha Luau, I witnessed dancers perform hula routines while enjoying classic Polynesian cuisine like roasted pig and poi (a sweet potato purée). It was such a fun way to learn more about Hawaiian heritage and sample authentic food.\\n\\nOf course, no trip to Hawaii would be complete without seeing Waikiki Beach. While the beach itself is beautiful, what really stands out here is the energy and excitement of this bustling neighborhood. You can spend hours wandering through shops, restaurants, and street vendors selling everything from surfboards to jewelry. And if you want to take things down a notch, there's always nearby Diamond Head State Monument, a crater filled with stunning views of the coastline.\\n\\nFinally, my time spent in Hawaii wouldn't have been possible without all the wonderful locals I met along the way. From friendly hotel staff to welcoming tour guides, these people were committed to making sure my experience was unforgettable.

Connectivity: An effective public transit network must cover the entire city with frequent stops so that passengers can reach their destinations easily without having to rely on private vehicles.

Safety measures: Passengers need reassurance that they will arrive safely to their destination, which is why safety features like emergency alarms, cameras surveillance, secure entry-points and exits are critical in making the ride safe and comfortable.\\n4. Affordability: Most importantly, affordable fares provide access to those who cannot afford taxis, Uber rides, or personal cars. The cost structure must be balanced to make sure it remains financially viable and sustainable over time.\\n5. Customer feedback: Regular customer engagement through various channels ensures that complaints get addressed promptly and enables continuous improvement of the services provided by mass transit operators.\\n6.

After arriving at the airport, I rented a car and headed towards downtown. My first stop was the famed Waikiki Beach, which was bustling with tourists but still offered a relaxing atmosphere. I then strolled along Kalakaua Avenue, which is home to many shops and restaurants. I couldn't resist trying one of the delicious pineapple smoothies sold on every corner. In the evening, I watched a traditional hula performance at Kuhio Beach Park before dining at an authentic plate lunch restaurant.\\n\\nCultural Experiences\\nKalua Pig Dinner (Plate Lunch Restaurant)\\nWaikiki Shell - Hula Show (Tuesday & Friday @ 7:30pm)\\nDay Two in Oahu\\nOn day two, I embarked on a road trip around the eastern side of the island. First up was Pearl Harbor, where I toured the USS Arizona Memorial and learned about the significance of this historic site. Next I visited the Nu`uanu Pali Lookout, where I got an amazing view of the windward coastline. For lunch, I stopped at the Polynesian Cultural Center to sample some local cuisine and watch a traditional dance show. That night I stayed at a quaint B&B near Hanauma Bay, which afforded me great views of the sunset over the bay.\\n\\nCultural Experiences\\nUSS Bowfin Submarine Museum & Park (Pearl Harbor)\\nNu`uanu Pali Lookout State Wayside (Highway 61)\\nPolynesian Cultural Center (Laie)\\nDay Three in Maui\\nMaui is known for its idyllic beaches and rainforest setting. So I began my morning with a hike in Haleakala National Park, where I saw hundreds of endangered silversword plants. Afterwards I spent the afternoon relaxing on the beach at Makena and enjoying some snorkeling in the crystal clear waters. Later I drove north to visit the town of Paia, which has a cool art scene and delicious food trucks.\\n\\nCultural Experiences\\nHaleakala Crater Hike\\nBlack Sand Beach (Makena State Park)\\nDitch Plains Snorkel Tour (from Paia Town Beach)\"\n      ]\n    ],\n    \"example2\": [\n      [\n        \"Can you help me write a resignation letter to my current employer, while leaving on good terms and expressing gratitude for the opportunities provided?\",\n        \"Resignation Letter Format\\n[Date] [Recipient’s Name & Company]\\nDear [Recipient’s Name],\\n\\nIt is with regret that I am writing this letter to inform you of my decision to leave my position at [Company] effective [date].

Accessible Information - Public transit systems should provide information about their services in formats that can be accessed by people with different abilities, including large print, Braille, audio, and other languages.\\n3. Communication - Transit agencies should ensure that there is good communication between staff members, bus drivers, and passengers with disabilities to address any issues that may arise during the trip.\\n4. Transportation Options - Provide transportation options for people with different needs. For instance, if someone has trouble walking long distances they could use para-transit instead of regular busses/trains. If a person cannot see or hear, it might be necessary to hire additional support workers to assist them while using the transportation system.\\n5.

Their friendly greetings and welcoming gestures make you feel like one of their own right away. We recommend starting your trip by immersing yourself in the rich history and traditions of Hawaiian culture.

You can also explore historic sites such as Pearl Harbor or Iolani Palace to get a deeper understanding of the state's fascinating past.\\n\\nAttractions\\n\\nWhen it comes to must-see attractions, Hawaii has something for everyone. On Oahu, don't miss iconic landmarks like Diamond Head Crater and Waikiki Beach. For breathtaking views, head up to Haleakala National Park on Maui and watch the sunrise over the crater. And if you love adventure, you won't want to miss zip lining through the rainforest on Kauai or taking a boat tour around the soaring cliffs of Na Pali Coast. If relaxation is more your speed, grab a book and a mai tai and find your perfect spot on the sand. One thing is certain - no matter what you choose to do during your stay, you're guaranteed to create memories that will last a lifetime.\\n\\nFood & Drink\\n\\nNo trip to Hawaii would be complete without sampling the delicious cuisine. Whether you're craving fresh seafood, sushi rolls, or a plate of loco moco (a classic dish featuring rice, gravy, and a hamburger patty), there's always something new to try. Be sure to stop by a luau and enjoy traditional Polynesian fare while being entertained by beautiful dancing and music. And of course, you have to sample the famous Hawaiian coffee.

Accessibility for people with disabilities: The system should be easily accessible to people with different abilities, including those who use wheelchairs or mobility devices, have visual or hearing impairments, or require assistance for other reasons. This includes features such as level boarding platforms, accessible seating and signage, audio announcements, tactile paving, and accessible terminals and stations.\\n2. Affordability: The cost of using the transportation system should be affordable for everyone, regardless of their income. This can be achieved through fare structures that cater to different needs (such as day passes, monthly passes, discounted fares for seniors or students), integrated ticketing systems that allow transfers between modes without additional fees, and subsidies for low-income riders.\\n3. Convenience: The system should make it easy for passengers to get from one place to another, with convenient routes, schedules, and connections. This means providing frequent service at all hours, offering real-time schedule information, and ensuring that stops and transfer points are well-marked and easy to find. It also includes features such as dedicated bike lanes, park-and-ride facilities, and intermodal connections with other modes of transportation (e.g., bikeshare programs, carshare programs).\\n4. Safety and security: Passengers should feel safe and secure while traveling on the transportation system. This requires investment in safety measures such as CCTV cameras, emergency call buttons, first aid equipment, and trained staff or security guards. The system should also be designed to minimize potential hazards, such as slippery surfaces or blind spots, and provide clear procedures for evacuations or emergencies.\\n5. Environmental sustainability: Public transportation is often more environmentally friendly than private vehicles, but this can vary depending on the technology used and how the system is operated. When designing an accessible and inclusive transportation system, it's important to consider the environmental impact and adopt practices that reduce carbon emissions and waste. This could include investing in zero-emission vehicles, promoting active transport options like walking or cycling, and integrating smart technologies to optimize energy efficiency.\"\n      ]\n    ],\n    \"example4\": [\n      [\n        \"Write a python program to print the first 10 Fibonacci numbers\",\n        \"```python\\ndef fibonacci(n):\\n   if n <= 1:\\n       return n\\n   else:\\n       return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)\\nfor i in range(10):\\n        print (fibonacci(i), end=\\\" \\\")\\n```\\nThe above code defines a recursive function named fibonacci that takes an input n representing the number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence. If the input is less than or equal to 1, it returns n. Otherwise, it calls itself twice with inputs of n - 1 and n - 2, respectively. It then adds their results together to get the required term in the Fibonacci sequence.

Honolulu is known for its vibrant arts scene and culinary delights. You can experience the traditional Hawaiian luau, taste exotic dishes like spam musubi, loco moco and poke bowl while enjoying live music performances, fire dancing, hula shows, lei making workshops etc. If you want a more peaceful environment then I recommend visiting Maui, home to scenic beaches, Haleakala National Park, Road to Hana drive and whale watching tours. On the Big Island, you can visit Volcanoes National Park, Akaka Falls, Rainbow Falls and other nature reserves to discover volcanic formations, tropical gardens, hot springs and lava tubes.

My name is Sarah, and I am a travel enthusiast who loves nothing more than discovering new places and experiencing different cultures. After spending several years traveling the globe, I can confidently say that Hawaii has been one of my favorite destinations so far. And if you're considering visiting too, keep reading because I have lots of exciting information to share with you.\\n\\nOne of the highlights of our trip was attending a traditional Hawaiian Luau. We went to the Old Lahaina Luau in Maui, where we were treated to an authentic Polynesian feast complete with poi (made from taro root), roasted pig, and fresh fish cooked right before our eyes. It was such a fun and interactive way to learn about Hawaiian culture, and I highly recommend it if you're interested in trying something truly unique.\\n\\nAnother must-see attraction on Oahu is the iconic Diamond Head State Monument. This volcanic crater offers stunning views of Waikiki Beach and Honolulu Harbor. You can hike up to the top of the crater or take a guided tour for even better vantage points. Plus, there are plenty of photo opportunities along the way.\\n\\nFor those craving some adrenaline rush, check out the Shark Attack Adventure Tour in Kaanapali. Here, you'll get the chance to snorkel with giant sea turtles and humpback whales while also learning about the local marine life and its importance to the ecosystem. Just be sure to follow all safety guidelines, as these animals can be dangerous when provoked.\\n\\nAnd finally, don't forget to try some of the amazing cuisine available in Hawaii. Poke bowls are a popular dish made with raw tuna, seaweed, cucumber, onions, and sesame seeds, served over rice. Another delicious option is plate lunches, which consist of rice, macaroni salad, grilled chicken or pork, and veggies. Be sure to sample both during your stay!\\n\\nOverall, my time in Hawaii was unforgettable. The people, the scenery, the food...everything was perfect.

It's truly an unforgettable experience.\\nAnother great way to explore Hawaii's unique culture is by visiting some of its historic landmarks. Pearl Harbor is a poignant reminder of America's involvement in World War II, while the USS Arizona Memorial pays tribute to those who lost their lives during the attack on December 7th, 1941. You can also visit the Iolani Palace, which served as the official residence of King Kalakaua and Queen Kapiʻolani from 1882 until 1893.\\nOf course, no trip to Hawaii would be complete without experiencing its incredible natural beauty. From hiking up Diamond Head State Monument to watching whales off the coast of Maui, there are endless opportunities for adventure.

From stunning natural beauty to rich cultural history, there was so much to see and experience on this tropical paradise. In this post, I'll share some of my favorite cultural experiences and must-see attractions that made my trip to Hawaii truly unforgettable.\\n\\nOne of the most memorable moments of our trip was visiting Pearl Harbor. This historic site honors those who lost their lives during the attack on December 7, 1941, and offers visitors a glimpse into World War II history. The USS Arizona Memorial, which floats above the sunken battleship, is particularly poignant. It's hard not to feel moved by the stories of bravery and sacrifice that resonate throughout the exhibits. If you plan to visit Pearl Harbor, make sure to book your tickets well in advance, as they often sell out quickly.\\n\\nAnother unmissable attraction is Haleakala National Park on Maui. Here, you can hike through lush rainforests, trek up volcanic peaks for breathtaking panoramas, and even bike along winding trails through dense greenery. Make sure to bring warm clothes, though – the higher elevation can be chilly! For those interested in learning more about local flora and fauna, there are guided walks available where knowledgeable park rangers provide insightful commentary on the unique plants and animals found within the park.\\n\\nCulture vultures won't want to miss out on the opportunity to attend a traditional luau. These festivals celebrating native Hawaiian customs feature live music, dancing, storytelling, and – of course – delicious food like roasted pig cooked in an underground oven called an imu. Many hotels offer luaus for guests, but if you prefer something more authentic, check out one of the many standalone venues scattered across the islands. Whichever option you choose, you're guaranteed to have an unforgettable evening immersed in Polynesian culture.\\n\\nNo trip to Hawaii would be complete without exploring the beautiful beaches. However, don't just head to the nearest stretch of sand; seek out spots that showcase the island's unique character. On Oahu, Waimea Bay is known for its huge waves and dramatic cliffs, while on Kauai, Poipu Beach boasts powdery white sand and clear blue waters perfect for snorkeling. And wherever you go, don't forget to stop by a beachside shave ice vendor for a refreshing treat on a hot day.\\n\\nLastly, no list of must-see attractions would be complete without mentioning the stunning natural wonders found throughout the islands. Whether it's hiking through bamboo forests in Kokee State Park on Kauai or taking a drive around the famous \\\"curl\\\" at Wailea Point on Maui, there's always somewhere new to explore and discover. Don't worry if you feel overwhelmed by all the choices – simply ask a local for recommendations and they'll be delighted to point you towards hidden gems off the tourist trail.\\n\\nIn conclusion, my trip to Hawaii offered me a wealth of unforgettable cultural experiences and picturesque landscapes to marvel at. By embracing the diverse traditions and natural splendor found throughout the islands, we were able to craft a truly once-in-a-lifetime adventure. Mahalo (thank you) Hawaii for providing us with memories that will last a lifetime!\"\n      ]\n    ],\n    \"example2\": [\n      [\n        \"Can you help me write a resignation letter to my current employer, while leaving on good terms and expressing gratitude for the opportunities provided?\",\n        \"Of course!

As someone who has always been fascinated by diverse cultures and their rich traditions, it was truly an enchanting experience for me to explore this unique corner of the world. From immersing myself in local customs and cuisine to marveling at breathtaking landscapes, every moment spent in Hawaii felt like a dream come true!\\n\\nIn this article, we will be delving into some of our most memorable cultural experiences during our stay in Hawaii as well as showcasing some must-visit attractions that should not be missed when visiting the Aloha State. So strap yourself in, grab your favorite cocktail (I suggest trying out one made with fresh pineapple juice), and let us transport you to the beautiful realm of Hawaiian magic...\\n\\nCultural Experiences in Paradise:\\n\\n1. Hula Dance Performance – One thing that really stood out while exploring Hawaiian culture was the intricate art form known as hula dancing. This ancient Polynesian dance involves graceful movements of the hands, arms, legs, and torso accompanied by chants or songs called mele. We had the pleasure of witnessing a live performance at the famous Kamehameha Theatre in Honolulu, where we were mesmerized by the talented dancers adorned in traditional costumes. The vibrant colors and patterns along with the hypnotic rhythms of the music created a truly unforgettable atmosphere.\\n\\n2. Ali'i Drive Sunset Catamaran Cruise – During our time in Maui, we embarked upon an evening cruise around West Maui's coastline. As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting its warm glow across the waves, we sipped on refreshing drinks while enjoying a sumptuous buffet spread. While sailing past majestic cliffs and secluded bays, we were treated to a captivating display of traditional Polynesian dancing performed by talented locals. It was such a special way to end our day and appreciate the beauty of Hawaiian culture.\\n\\n3. Pipikaula Beach BBQ & Luau – One night during our stay on Oahu, we attended a lively beachside barbecue and luau at the renowned Turtle Bay Resort. Not only did we indulge in mouthwatering local cuisines like lau lau (pork wrapped in taro leaves) and haupia (coconut cream dessert), but we also had the opportunity to watch skilled performers executing traditional Hawaiian dances such as poi spinning and fire knife throwing. As darkness fell, we sat back and enjoyed a spectacular display of shooting stars and fireworks choreographed to Hawaiian music – an unforgettable ending to another perfect day in Paradise.\\n\\nMust-Visit Attractions:\\n\\n4. Pearl Harbor Memorial – Paying homage to those who lost their lives during the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, this monumental site serves as both a memorial and educational center dedicated to preserving the history of World War II. Here, visitors can walk through the impressive USS Arizona Memorial, which rests above the wreckage of the sunken battleship, as well as explore various museums filled with artifacts and exhibits chronicling the events leading up to the attacks.\\n\\n5. Na Pali Coast Helicopter Tour – For a once-in-a-lifetime experience, soar high above the breathtakingly beautiful Na Pali Coast on the Island of Kauai. With jagged mountains plunging into turquoise waters below, this helicopter tour offers panoramic views unlike any other, allowing passengers to fully appreciate the raw power and beauty of nature found in Hawaii. Keep your eyes peeled for exotic wildlife such as sea turtles, dolphins, and even humpback whales during peak season (December - April).\\n\\n6. Waimea Canyon State Park – Also known as \\\"The Grand Canyon of Hawaii,\\\" this massive limestone gorge is a sight to behold. Carved over centuries by water erosion, Waimea Canyon measures approximately 10 miles long, one mile wide, and more than 3,500 feet deep. Hike along the park's numerous trails, taking in the stunning red rocks, cascading waterfalls, and sweeping vistas that make this natural wonder so iconic.\\n\\n7. Dole Plantation Pineapple Express Train Ride – Embark on a fun-filled adventure through the historic Dole plantation at the foot of Mount Wakeahiea. Take a narrated train ride through the fields of ripening pineapples before stopping at the Whipsnade Village, complete with a petting zoo, maze, and old-fashioned playground. Finish off your day with a taste of pure heaven – a cold slice of fresh Dole pineapple straight from the source!\\n\\nConclusion:\\n\\nThese incredible experiences and must-see attractions are just a small sample of what awaited us during our time in Hawaii. Each new encounter with the islands' rich culture and natural beauty left us feeling grateful for the chance to immerse ourselves in this truly extraordinary destination. And though we have now reluctantly bid farewell to this magical realm, the memories and lessons learned will remain etched forever in our hearts.\\n\\nSo if ever given the opportunity to visit the Hawaiian Islands, do not hesitate; pack your bag and prepare for a journey unlike any other – one that will fill your soul with inspiration, wonder, and above all else, love for humanity and our shared connection to Earth's most beautiful treasures.\"\n      ]\n    ],\n    \"example2\": [\n      [\n        \"Can you help me write a resignation letter to my current employer, while leaving on good terms and expressing gratitude for the opportunities provided?\",\n        \"[Your Name]\\n[Your Address]\\n[City], [State ZIP]\\n[Email Address]\\n[Phone Number]\\n[Current Employer’s Name]\\n[Company Address]\\n[Date]\\n\\nDear [Employer's Last Name],\\n\\nI hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits.

The turquoise waters lapped gently at the shore while palm trees swayed gracefully in the breeze – it was as if I had stepped into a postcard. This serene moment served as a perfect introduction to my adventures through the islands of Hawaii.\\n\\nMy journey began on the lush island of Oahu, where I spent my days exploring historic landmarks and immersing myself in local culture. One such experience was visiting Pearl Harbor, which marked both a solemn and educational encounter. Standing amidst the ruins of the USS Arizona Memorial, I could not help but feel humbled by the sacrifices made during the attack on December 7, 1941. In addition to paying tribute to those who lost their lives, I also learned about the importance of pearls in Hawaiian history and culture at the Pearl Museum. These fascinating creatures have played a significant role in shaping the state's heritage, with Native Hawaiians using them for adornment and trading purposes long before European contact.\\n\\nContinuing on my cultural odyssey, I ventured to the Polynesian Cultural Center (PCC) – a truly unique destination that showcases the diverse customs and traditions of several Pacific Islands. At PCC, I participated in traditional dances, sampled exotic foods, and watched captivating performances ranging from Tahitian fire dancing to Maori war rituals. It was incredibly enriching to learn about these distant lands firsthand from the friendly staff members who shared their personal stories and connections to each respective country.\\n\\nOf course, no trip to Hawaii would be complete without experiencing its world-renowned natural wonders. As soon as I set foot inside Volcanoes National Park, I was awestruck by the sheer magnitude of Kilauea – one of the most active volcanoes in the world. Strolling along the crater rim, I couldn't help but feel tiny beneath the towering cinder cones and steaming vents dotting the landscape. Later, I took a dip in the therapeutic waters of Mauna Loa Macadamia Nuts' Observatory Park – known for its mineral-rich geothermal pools. Soaking in this earthly treasure, I reveled in the healing powers of nature while admiring the breathtaking views of nearby waterfalls.\\n\\nFurther north on the Big Island, I encountered another spectacular sight: Akaka Falls State Park. Surrounded by lush rainforests and fragrant eucalyptus groves, this hidden gem boasts two stunning waterfalls – including the dramatic 442-foot plunge of Akaka Falls itself. After hiking alongside the cascading waters, I rewarded myself with a picnic lunch surrounded by verdant foliage and serenaded by the soothing sounds of native birdsong.\\n\\nLeaving the Big Island behind, I embarked on a brief journey to Maui, where I was eager to explore the legendary Road to Hana. This scenic route is renowned for its countless waterfalls, tropical gardens, and secluded beaches – all nestled within the dense rainforest of East Maui. My husband and I spent hours driving slowly along this winding road, stopping frequently to hike to various viewpoints and swim in crystal-clear pools fed by tumbling streams. We even lucked out and caught a glimpse of the elusive 'ele'ele bird – a rare Hawaiian honeycreeper found only on Maui. Despite the long day, the memories created along the Road to Hana will forever hold a special place in my heart.\\n\\nAs my time in paradise drew to a close, I felt a profound sense of gratitude for having been able to immerse myself in the rich cultures and unparalleled natural wonders of Hawaii. From learning about history at sacred sites like Pearl Harbor, to dancing under the stars at Polynesian Cultural Center, every moment has left an indelible mark on my soul. And though I may never forget the breathtaking beauty of the Hawaiian Islands, there's always room for one more reason to return – after all, there's still so much more to discover!\"\n      ]\n    ],\n    \"example2\": [\n      [\n        \"Can you help me write a resignation letter to my current employer, while leaving on good terms and expressing gratitude for the opportunities provided?\",\n        \"[Your Name] [Current Position / Department]\\n[Company Name]\\n[Address, City, State, ZIP Code]\\nDate: [Insert Date]\\n\\nDear [Employer’s Name],\\n\\nThis letter serves as my formal notice of resignation from the position of [Position Title] at [Company Name].

Easy-to-use ticketing systems: Providing multiple payment options such as cash, debit/credit cards, smartcards or mobile apps can make it easier for everyone, including those who may not have bank accounts or reliable internet connections, to use public transportation easily.\\n3. Real-time information: Displaying accurate arrival times, maps, and route information in clear formats (either digital signs or Braille) can assist passengers with visual impairments or cognitive disabilities in navigating the system more independently.\\n4. Reliable service: Ensuring consistent schedules, reduced wait times, and sufficient capacity during peak hours will improve overall customer satisfaction and encourage greater utilization of public transportation by all users.\\n5. Safety features: Installing emergency buttons, security cameras, well-lit platforms, and trained staff to handle incidents can create a safer environment for riders, particularly for women, elderly persons, and other vulnerable groups.\\n6. Affordability: Offering low-income residents discounted fares or subsidized pass programs helps make public transportation more accessible to those on tight budgets and reduces barriers to employment, education, and social opportunities.\\n7. Connections to other forms of transportation: Integrating buses, trains, trams, and bike shares into one coherent network makes it easier for passengers to travel between different modes of transportation without having to navigate complicated transfers or pay additional fees.\\n8.

With so many places to visit, I wasn't quite sure where to begin. Luckily for me, there was plenty of culture and natural beauty to keep me busy during my stay.\\nOne thing that stood out immediately upon arrival was the warmth of the people. Everyone seemed genuinely friendly and welcoming, greeting visitors with a smile and offering assistance wherever possible. This spirit of aloha was present throughout our entire journey, from hiking through lush rainforests to snorkeling along pristine reefs.\\nOur first stop was Honolulu, which offered us a glimpse into traditional Hawaiian life. We visited historic sites like Iolani Palace (the only royal palace in America), took part in sacred ceremonies at Waikiki Beach, and even had the chance to try some delicious local cuisine like shaved ice and poke bowls.\\nNext up was Maui, home to Haleakala National Park and the stunning Road to Hana. As we explored this tropical paradise, we encountered ancient temples and breathtaking waterfalls before ending our day with sunset views over the Pacific Ocean. It truly felt like heaven on Earth!\\nOf course, no trip to Hawaii would be complete without experiencing the famous luau tradition. At Polynesian Cultural Center, we were treated to an unforgettable evening full of dance performances, food tastings, and even a fire show. We learned all about the history and traditions of the Polynesians while enjoying live music and entertainment underneath the stars.\\nAnd last but certainly not least, we couldn't leave without visiting Pearl Harbor Memorial – the site of one of America's darkest days. While it's impossible to fully comprehend the impact of that fateful morning, standing among the monuments and exhibits brought home just how important it is to never forget those who sacrificed everything for freedom.\\nIn conclusion, Hawaii exceeded all expectations and left us feeling both inspired and refreshed. From the moment we stepped off the plane until the final goodbye, everyone we met shared their love of family, friends, and nature in ways that made us feel welcome and appreciated.

I'm so glad you asked me for some help on writing your Hawaiian travel blog post. We just had such a wonderful time exploring the islands, experiencing their incredible culture, and enjoying all those amazing natural wonders that make these islands truly unique.\\nLet's start by talking about how we planned our trip. One thing we realized early on was that although Hawaii may seem like one big island from far away, each of the six main ones have their own distinct personality, history, and things to see. So we decided to visit three different places - Oahu, Kauai, and Maui - over the course of two weeks. This allowed us plenty of time to explore each place at leisure without feeling rushed.\\nSpeaking of rushing, one of the first things people usually ask is whether they need to worry about tsunamis while visiting Hawaii. And while it's true that tsunami warnings occur more often here than anywhere else on Earth, rest assured that most locals don't even notice them anymore because tsunami warning systems are very accurate and provide ample lead times to seek higher ground if necessary. In fact, during our entire stay, nothing remotely dangerous happened (other than perhaps my partner's sunburn after falling asleep on the beach!)\\nAnyway, back to our trip. Once we arrived at Honolulu airport on Oahu, we spent several days visiting Pearl Harbor, Waikiki Beach, Diamond Head Crater, Hanauma Bay State Park, and other famous tourist sites around town before heading west towards the North Shore to watch the world-famous surfers ride giant waves at Pipeline and Sunset Beach. The North Shore also offered numerous opportunities to learn about local Polynesian cultures through food festivals, craft markets, and traditional dances performed daily at various locations across this part of the island. After spending four nights camping out on the beach under a million stars, we hopped onto a short plane flight to Kauai where we experienced breathtakingly lush landscapes filled with waterfalls, jungles, and canyons unlike anywhere else on earth. Highlights included hikes along the Na Pali Coast Trail and Waimea Canyon, kayaking down Wailua River to Secret Falls, snorkeling off Poipu Beach, ziplining above treetops, and watching dolphins playing in Hanalei Bay. By the end of our week on Kauai, we were utterly exhausted but ready for another adventure further south – this time aboard the 130 km long highway connecting 45 miles of glorious coastline in Maui. Our favorite stops along the way included Kaanapali Beach, Black Sand Beaches at Waianapanapa State Park, Haleakala National Park's stunning craters and lava fields, and Lahaina Town for shopping and authentic cuisine. Before leaving, we stayed up late enough to catch an unforgettable view of Haleakala's summit glowing bright red in the rising morning sun.\\nAll told, we found Hawaiians to be warm, friendly people who love sharing stories of their homeland with visitors from all corners of the globe. Their spirit of aloha permeates everything from music to dance to artwork to food, making every experience feel uniquely special. Whether wandering through bustling cities or traversing rugged mountainsides, it was impossible NOT to fall head over heels for Hawaii's intoxicating mix of nature and culture.\\nSo yeah, that was pretty awesome! If you decide to go yourself someday soon, please drop us a line.

Begin with warmth and appreciation towards your company, acknowledging all the ways in which working there has benefited you personally and professionally during your time together.\\n2. Express confidence in their future success without sounding overbearingly boastful (i.e. \\\"I know [company name] will continue thriving because of XYZ reasons.\\\"). You want to convey enthusiasm about your own personal goals moving forward rather than disparaging statements regarding the organization itself.\\n3. State specifically why you're choosing to move onto new challenges; keep these answers short yet impactful (\\\"I am pursuing additional responsibilities outside work,\\\" or \\\"My passion lies elsewhere,\\\" etc.). These should relate back to your own growth trajectory within the company if possible.\\n4. Note how thankful you were throughout your tenure for everything the team did to support you along the way from training opportunities to projects completed together. Make sure to include key individuals who made significant contributions toward your experience at the firm.\\n5. Close out the letter sincerely with well wishes for continued prosperity at your soon-to-be former place of employment alongside contact details where colleagues may reach out after your official exit date.

Here are some of the top cultural experiences and must-see attractions that you won’t want to miss on your next visit to Hawaii.\\n\\nStarting off at Pearl Harbor, where World War II buffs can explore the USS Arizona Memorial and learn about the devastating attack that launched America into war. The memorial pays tribute to the lives lost during the bombing and serves as a reminder of the sacrifices made for our country’s freedom. It’s a somber but incredibly moving experience.\\n\\nNext up on the cultural adventure is attending a traditional Luau. This is a great opportunity to taste delicious local food like Kalua Pig and Poke while witnessing ancient dances such as the Hula. These dance performances tell stories of Hawaiian mythology through hand gestures and hips shaking in unison. You might feel silly trying to replicate these moves yourself, but trust me – it's all in good fun!\\n\\nAnother fascinating aspect of Hawaiian culture involves the art of quilting. On Molokai Island, visitors can learn about how native Hawaiians would create colorful clothing out of vibrant fabrics using traditional methods passed down from generation to generation. There are still several quilt artists living there who teach visitors their techniques today. Not only do they provide lessons, but they will take you to see the stunning scenery around them which includes famous landmarks like Halawa Valley and Kaunakakai's Historic Downtown area.\\n\\nOf course, no trip to Hawaii is complete without hitting the beach. But if you seek something beyond sunbathing, try snorkeling or scuba diving among coral reefs teeming with marine life. Many tour operators offer guided trips, including visiting underwater caves, secret spots where sea turtles bask on the sandy bottom, and observing playful dolphins in the wild.\\n\\nWhen the sun goes down, head over to Waikiki Beach to watch the beautiful Fire Knife Dance showcasing the skilled performers spinning blazing knives alongside their feet. With its bright colors and pulsing rhythms, the fire dancing event is not to be missed!.\\n\\nAll in all, Hawaii offers an amazingly vast array of activities to choose from that both locals and tourists alike enjoy equally.

I mean, who wouldn’t want to visit a place that boasts of stunning beaches, lush green forests, warm tropical climate, and amazing culture? Last month, I finally got the chance to go there with my friends, and it was nothing short of spectacular. In this post, I will take you through some of our best experiences in the Aloha State.\\n\\nFirst things first; we couldn’t resist hitting up Waikiki Beach. It’s located right next to Honolulu and has everything that makes Hawaii famous - clear turquoise waters, palm trees swaying in the breeze, hula dancers performing on the sandy shores, and a perfect sunset view. We also visited Pearl Harbor while we were in town, which was both solemn and informative. The USS Arizona Memorial was particularly moving as we paid tribute to all the lives lost during the attack.\\n\\nBut what really stood out for us was how immersed we became in local traditions and customs. One day, we decided to explore Hanauma Bay Nature Preserve, where we snorkeled among colorful fishes and vibrant coral reefs. However, before entering, we had to attend a brief cultural orientation session explaining the importance of preserving marine life and following the rules. There we learned about traditional fishponds built by native Hawaiians around 1850 using volcanic rocks, still visible today along the coastline. These helped supply fresh seafood year round. How impressive is that!\\n\\nAnother unforgettable moment occurred when we went on a guided hike through the Kona Coffee Living History Farm. Not only did we get to see coffee plants growing wild and taste different types of brews but also saw ancient terraces that date back hundreds of years used to grow crops such as bananas and sweet potatoes by native people. As if that wasn’t enough, our guide dressed in period clothing shared stories and legends from his ancestors passed down orally. This brought history alive and made me appreciate more how Hawaiian culture evolved over time.\\n\\nFinally, no Hawaii vacation would be complete without experiencing the aloha spirit. Everywhere we went – restaurants, street markets, parks – locals greeted us kindly, smiled, asked how our days were going and truly radiated love, compassion and kindness. Their laid-back lifestyle inspired us to slow down, soak in every moment like the sun rays on our skin, cherish good food and drinks, enjoy live music and dance performances. Our spirits felt rejuvenated just being surrounded by their contagious positivity.\\n\\nIn conclusion, our adventure in Oahu exceeded our expectations. Beyond its beautiful scenery and iconic landmarks, Hawaii offers visitors plenty of opportunities to learn, respect and immerse ourselves into local communities. If you ever plan a trip here, do yourself a favor and step outside your comfort zone, open your heart to new cultures, try exotic fruits, listen to tales of old Hawaii, witness hula performances under the stars and let your hair loose. You won’t regret it. So, mahalo (thank you) Hawaii, until next time!\"\n      ]\n    ],\n    \"example2\": [\n      [\n        \"Can you help me write a resignation letter to my current employer, while leaving on good terms and expressing gratitude for the opportunities provided?\",\n        \"Dear [Employer Name],\\n\\nI am writing this letter to formally submit my resignation from my position as [Your Position] in your esteemed organization with effect from [Last Working Day].

I visited the Polynesian Cultural Center which allowed me to explore the traditions and customs of several Pacific Islands including Hawaii, Tahiti, Samoa, Fiji, and New Zealand. The performance showcased traditional dances, music, food and crafts from each region. It was such a unique experience and truly enlightening.\\nAnother cultural experience I recommend is attending a luau. Luaus are traditional Hawaiian feasts that include an entire roasted pig, along with other delicious dishes like poi (a traditional Hawaiian staple made from mashed taro root) laulau (pork cooked in taro leaves), and more. You will also enjoy live entertainment featuring hula dancers and musicians while enjoying the beautiful Hawaiian sunset. Trust me when I say, this is one event you don't want to miss out on.\\nWhen it comes to sightseeing, Hawaii has plenty of must-visit spots. One place that should be at the top of everyone's list is Pearl Harbor. This historic site played a significant role in World War II and is home to many important landmarks and museums that honor those who fought and lost their lives. Another unmissable spot is the Diamond Head State Monument where visitors can hike to the summit for panoramic views of Oahu's southern coastline.\\nFor nature lovers, Hawaii offers some of the world's most scenic wilderness areas. I highly recommend exploring Maui's Haleakala National Park. Here you can see unique flora and fauna, plus incredible vistas such as the famous \\\"Crater Walk\\\". If you prefer beach days, then Waikiki Beach in Honolulu is a great choice. With its white sandy shores, clear blue waters and abundant water sports activities, it is definitely worth a day trip.\\nIn conclusion, whether you are seeking adventure, culture, relaxation or a mix of everything, Hawaii is the perfect destination for all types of travelers.

The beautiful scenery, delicious food, warm ocean waters, and rich culture make it such a unique destination that is worth visiting time and time again. Here are some of the cultural experiences and must-see attractions that made my trip unforgettable:\\n\\nFirst off was a trip to Pearl Harbor where we visited the USS Arizona Memorial. This somber yet uplifting experience gave me goosebumps as I stood above the sunken battleship, paying respects to those who lost their lives in the attack on December 7, 1941. Learning about Hawaiian history during WWII, as well as hearing personal stories from survivors, truly added depth to our understanding of the impact of that day.\\n\\nNext up was a visit to Waimea Canyon. As soon as you step out of your car, you feel dwarfed by Mother Nature herself. Towering peaks surround you while a deep gorge carves its way through lush green foliage. It almost felt like I had stepped onto another planet altogether - there were waterfalls cascading down every few feet and vibrant red soil covering the ground.\\n\\nHawaiian cuisine is also something to write home about - after all, what better place to find authentic Pacific Rim fare than right at the center? One thing I always order when visiting Hawaii is poke bowls - freshly caught tuna or salmon sliced thin with soy sauce, sesame oil, seaweed, and other goodies piled high over rice for the perfect midday snack.\\n\\nBut perhaps one of the most memorable parts of any trip to Hawaii is the local music scene. Everywhere you turn, there seems to be someone strumming a ukulele or singing sweet hula melodies underneath a palm tree. We stopped into a small restaurant called Lulu's, which turned out to be famous among locals for live performances and late-night dancing. There was even a friendly dog named Pua roaming around greeting everyone he could.\\n\\nLast but certainly not least, no trip to Hawaii would be complete without experiencing its famed beaches. Maui's Kaanapali Beach (just a short flight away!) offers crystal clear waters and white sand beaches ideal for swimming, surfing, or simply relaxing. And yes, the rumors are true - the waves are incredible! Whether you choose to tackle them yourself or just sit back and watch others ride the waves, there's never a dull moment.\\n\\nAnd as I wrap up this post, it feels bittersweet knowing that I have returned to mainland life once more.
