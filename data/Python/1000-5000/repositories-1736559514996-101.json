The\nfollowing considerations are for informational purposes only, are not\nexhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\n\n-   Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for\n    use by those authorized to give the public permission to use\n    material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other\n    rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and\n    understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose\n    before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights\n    necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse\n    the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material\n    not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed\n    material, or material used under an exception or limitation to\n    copyright. More considerations for licensors :\n    wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations\\_for\\_licensors\n\n-   Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses,\n    a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material\n    under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor's permission\n    is not necessary for any reason–for example, because of any\n    applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then that use is not\n    regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under\n    copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to\n    grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for\n    other reasons, including because others have copyright or other\n    rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such\n    as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not\n    required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those\n    requests where reasonable.

To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a\ncontract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your\nacceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You\nsuch rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from\nmaking the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\n\n-   Section 1 – Definitions.\n\n    -   a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and\n        Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed\n        Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated,\n        altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a\n        manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar\n        Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public\n        License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work,\n        performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always\n        produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed\n        relation with a moving image.\n    -   b.

Effective Technological Measures means those measures that,\n        in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented\n        under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO\n        Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar\n        international agreements.\n    -   e.

You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed\n        Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding\n        meaning.\n\n-   Section 2 – Scope.\n\n    -   a. License grant.\n        -   1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public\n            License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide,\n            royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable\n            license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed\n            Material to:\n            -   A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole\n                or in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and\n            -   B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for\n                NonCommercial purposes only.\n        -   2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt,\n            where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this\n            Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply\n            with its terms and conditions.\n        -   3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in\n            Section 6(a).\n        -   4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n            Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n            all media and formats whether now known or hereafter\n            created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do\n            so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any\n            right or authority to forbid You from making technical\n            modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights,\n            including technical modifications necessary to circumvent\n            Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this\n            Public License, simply making modifications authorized by\n            this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.\n        -   5. Downstream recipients.\n            -   A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every\n                recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n                receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n                Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n                Public License.\n            -   B. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or\n                impose any additional or different terms or conditions\n                on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to,\n                the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of\n                the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n                Material.\n        -   6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License\n            constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or\n            imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed\n            Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or\n            granted official status by, the Licensor or others\n            designated to receive attribution as provided in Section\n            3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n    -   b. Other rights.\n        -   1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n            licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n            privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however,\n            to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees\n            not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the\n            limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the\n            Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.\n        -   2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n            Public License.\n        -   3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n            collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n            Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n            under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n            licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n            reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when\n            the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial\n            purposes.\n\n-   Section 3 – License Conditions.\n\n    Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to\n    the following conditions.\n\n    -   a. Attribution.\n        -   1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n            form), You must:\n            -   A. retain the following if it is supplied by the\n                Licensor with the Licensed Material:\n                -   i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);\n                -   ii. a copyright notice;\n                -   iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n                -   iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n                -   v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to\n                    the extent reasonably practicable;\n            -   B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n                retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n            -   C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n                Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n                hyperlink to, this Public License.\n        -   2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n            reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n            which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may\n            be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI\n            or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n            information.\n        -   3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n            information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n            reasonably practicable.\n        -   4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n            License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n            Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n-   Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\n    Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\n    apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n    -   a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the\n        right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a\n        substantial portion of the contents of the database for\n        NonCommercial purposes only;\n    -   b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n        contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n        Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n        Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material;\n        and\n    -   c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You\n        Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the\n        database.\n\n    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\n    replace Your obligations under this Public License where the\n    Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n-   Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n    -   a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to\n        the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material\n        as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or\n        warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether\n        express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without\n        limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a\n        particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other\n        defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether\n        or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties\n        are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not\n        apply to You.\n    -   b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be\n        liable to You on any legal theory (including, without\n        limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special,\n        indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or\n        other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this\n        Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the\n        Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses,\n        costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is\n        not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to\n        You.\n    -   c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability\n        provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the\n        extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute\n        disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\n\n-   Section 6 – Term and Termination.\n\n    -   a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n        Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply\n        with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public\n        License terminate automatically.\n    -   b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated\n        under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n        -   1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured,\n            provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n            violation; or\n        -   2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n        For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect\n        any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your\n        violations of this Public License.\n\n    -   c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n        Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n        distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing\n        so will not terminate this Public License.\n    -   d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n        License.\n\n-   Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n    -   a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or\n        different terms or conditions communicated by You unless\n        expressly agreed.\n    -   b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n        Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n        independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n-   Section 8 – Interpretation.\n\n    -   a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n        shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n        conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could\n        lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\n    -   b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public\n        License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically\n        reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable.\n        If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from\n        this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the\n        remaining terms and conditions.\n    -   c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived\n        and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to\n        by the Licensor.\n    -   d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be\n        interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges\n        and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from\n        the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.

The model family is pretrained on 300 million in-the-wild human images and shows excellent generalization to unconstrained conditions. These models are also designed for extracting high-resolution features, having been natively trained at a 1024 x 1024 image resolution with a 16-pixel patch size.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"./assets/01.gif\" alt=\"01\" title=\"01\" width=\"400\"/>\n  <img src=\"./assets/03.gif\" alt=\"03\" title=\"03\" width=\"400\"/>\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"./assets/02.gif\" alt=\"02\" title=\"02\" width=\"400\"/>\n  <img src=\"./assets/04.gif\" alt=\"04\" title=\"04\" width=\"400\"/>\n</p>\n\n\n## 🚀 Getting Started\n\n### Clone the Repository\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/sapiens.git\n   export SAPIENS_ROOT=/path/to/sapiens\n   ```\n\n### Recommended: Lite Installation (Inference-only)\n   For users setting up their own environment primarily for running existing models in inference mode, we recommend the [Sapiens-Lite installation](lite/README.md).\\\n   This setup offers optimized inference (4x faster) with minimal dependencies (only PyTorch + numpy + cv2).\n\n### Full Installation\n   To replicate our complete training setup, run the provided installation script. \\\n   This will create a new conda environment named `sapiens` and install all necessary dependencies.\n\n   ```bash\n   cd $SAPIENS_ROOT/_install\n   ./conda.sh\n   ```\n\n   Please download the **original** checkpoints from [hugging-face](https://huggingface.co/facebook/sapiens). \\\n   You can be selective about only downloading the checkpoints of interest.\\\n   Set `$SAPIENS_CHECKPOINT_ROOT` to be the path to the `sapiens_host` folder. Place the checkpoints following this directory structure:\n   ```plaintext\n   sapiens_host/\n   ├── detector/\n   │   └── checkpoints/\n   │       └── rtmpose/\n   ├── pretrain/\n   │   └── checkpoints/\n   │       ├── sapiens_0.3b/\n               ├── sapiens_0.3b_epoch_1600_clean.pth\n   │       ├── sapiens_0.6b/\n               ├── sapiens_0.6b_epoch_1600_clean.pth\n   │       ├── sapiens_1b/\n   │       └── sapiens_2b/\n   ├── pose/\n      └── checkpoints/\n         ├── sapiens_0.3b/\n   └── seg/\n   └── depth/\n   └── normal/\n   ```\n\n## 🌟 Human-Centric Vision Tasks\nWe finetune sapiens for multiple human-centric vision tasks.
