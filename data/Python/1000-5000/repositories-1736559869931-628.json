By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"

Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=GeneralNewsExtractor/GeneralNewsExtractor&type=Date)](https://star-history.com/#GeneralNewsExtractor/GeneralNewsExtractor&Date)\n\n\n## 项目起源\n\n开发这个项目，源自于我在知网发现了一篇关于自动化抽取新闻类网站正文的算法论文——[《基于文本及符号密度的网页正文提取方法》](https://kns.cnki.net/KCMS/detail/detail.aspx?dbcode=CJFQ&dbname=CJFDLAST2019&filename=GWDZ201908029&v=MDY4MTRxVHJXTTFGckNVUkxPZmJ1Wm5GQ2poVXJyQklqclBkTEc0SDlqTXA0OUhiWVI4ZVgxTHV4WVM3RGgxVDM=)）\n\n这篇论文中描述的算法看起来简洁清晰，并且符合逻辑。但由于论文中只讲了算法原理，并没有具体的语言实现，所以我使用 Python 根据论文实现了这个抽取器。并分别使用今日头条、网易新闻、游民星空、观察者网、凤凰网、腾讯新闻、ReadHub、新浪新闻做了测试，发现提取效果非常出色，几乎能够达到100%的准确率。\n\n## 项目现状\n\n在论文中描述的正文提取基础上，我增加了标题、发布时间和文章作者的自动化探测与提取功能。\n\n目前这个项目是一个非常非常早期的 Demo，不能保证每个版本向下兼容，升级之前请特别注意。发布出来是希望能够尽快得到大家的使用反馈，从而能够更好地有针对性地进行开发。\n\n本项目取名为`抽取器`，而不是`爬虫`，是为了规避不必要的风险，因此，本项目的输入是 HTML，输出是一个字典。请自行使用恰当的方法获取目标网站的 HTML。\n\n**本项目现在不会，将来也不会提供主动请求网站 HTML 的功能。**\n\n## 如何使用\n\n### 在线体验\n\n如果你想先体验 GNE 的提取效果，那么你可以访问[http://gne.kingname.info/](http://gne.kingname.info/)。\n一般情况下，你只需要把网页粘贴到最上面的多行文本框中，然后点`提取`按钮即可。通过附加更多的参数，可以让提取更精确。具体\n参数的写法与作用，请参阅 [API](https://generalnewsextractor.readthedocs.io/zh_CN/latest/#api)\n\n### 使用环境\n\n如果你想体验 GNE 的功能，请按照如下步骤进行：\n\n#### 安装 GNE\n\n```bash\n\n# 以下两种方案任选一种即可\n\n# 使用 pip 安装\npip install --upgrade gne\n\n# 使用 pipenv 安装\npipenv install gne\n\n```\n\n#### 使用 GNE\n\n##### 提取正文\n\n```python\n>>> from gne import GeneralNewsExtractor\n\n>>> html = '''经过渲染的网页 HTML 代码'''\n\n>>> extractor = GeneralNewsExtractor()\n>>> result = extractor.extract(html, noise_node_list=['//div[@class=\"comment-list\"]'])\n>>> print(result)\n\n{\"title\": \"xxxx\", \"publish_time\": \"2019-09-10 11:12:13\", \"author\": \"yyy\", \"content\": \"zzzz\", \"images\": [\"/xxx.jpg\", \"/yyy.png\"]}\n```\n\n更多使用说明，请参阅 [GNE 的文档](https://generalnewsextractor.readthedocs.io/)\n\n##### 提取列表页(测试版)\n    \n```python\n>>> from gne import ListPageExtractor\n>>> html = '''经过渲染的网页 HTML 代码'''\n>>> list_extractor = ListPageExtractor()\n>>> result = list_extractor.extract(html,\n                                    feature='列表中任意元素的 XPath\")\n>>> print(result)\n```\n\n### 开发环境\n\n如果你需要参与本项目的开发，请按照如下步骤进行。\n\n如果你只想阅读源代码，请现在直接**按下键盘上的句号键（就是问号左边那个）**，可以获得更好的阅读体验。\n\n本项目使用 `Pipenv`管理 Python 的第三方库。如果你不知道 `Pipenv` 是什么，请[点我跳转](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv)。\n\n安装完成`Pipenv`以后，按照如下步骤运行代码：\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/kingname/GeneralNewsExtractor.git\ncd GeneralNewsExtractor\npipenv install\npipenv shell\npython3 example.py\n```\n\n### 特别说明\n\n项目代码中的`example.py`提供了本项目的基本使用示例。\n\n* 本项目的测试代码在`tests`文件夹中\n* 本项目的输入 HTML 为经过 JavaScript 渲染以后的 HTML，而不是普通的网页源代码。所以无论是后端渲染、Ajax 异步加载都适用于本项目。\n* 如果你要手动测试新的目标网站或者目标新闻，那么你可以在 Chrome 浏览器中打开对应页面，然后开启`开发者工具`，如下图所示：\n\n![](https://github.com/kingname/GeneralNewsExtractor/blob/master/screenshots/2019-09-08-22-20-33.png)\n\n在`Elements`标签页定位到`<html>`标签，并右键，选择`Copy`-`Copy OuterHTML`，如下图所示\n\n![](https://github.com/kingname/GeneralNewsExtractor/blob/master/screenshots/2019-09-08-22-21-49.png)\n\n* 当然，你可以使用 Puppeteer/Pyppeteer、Selenium 或者其他任何方式获取目标页面的`JavaScript渲染后的`源代码。\n\n* 获取到源代码以后，通过如下代码提取信息：\n\n``` python\nfrom gne import GeneralNewsExtractor\n\nextractor = GeneralNewsExtractor()\nhtml = '你的目标网页正文'\nresult = extractor.extract(html)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n* 如果标题自动提取失败了，你可以指定 XPath：\n\n```python\nfrom gne import GeneralNewsExtractor\n\nextractor = GeneralNewsExtractor()\nhtml = '你的目标网页正文'\nresult = extractor.extract(html, title_xpath='//h5/text()')\nprint(result)\n```\n\n对大多数新闻页面而言，以上的写法就能够解决问题了。\n\n但某些新闻网页下面会有评论，评论里面可能存在长篇大论，它们会看起来比真正的新闻正文更像是正文，因此`extractor.extract()`方法还有一个默认参数`noise_node_list`，用于在网页预处理时提前把评论区域整个移除。\n\n`noise_mode_list`的值是一个列表，列表里面的每一个元素都是 XPath，对应了你需要提前移除的，可能会导致干扰的目标标签。\n\n例如，`观察者网`下面的评论区域对应的Xpath 为`//div[@class=\"comment-list\"]`。所以在提取观察者网时，为了防止评论干扰，就可以加上这个参数：\n\n```python\nresult = extractor.extract(html, noise_node_list=['//div[@class=\"comment-list\"]'])\n```\n\n* **提取新闻列表页的功能是测试功能，请勿用于生产环境**。你可以通过Chrome 浏览器开发者工具中的 `Copy XPath` 来复制列表中任意一项的XPath，如下图所示。\n\n![](https://github.com/kingname/GeneralNewsExtractor/blob/master/screenshots/2020-08-02-17-07-19.png)\n\nGNE 会根据这一项的 XPath，自动找到这个列表里面其他行的数据。\n\n\n\n## 运行截图\n\n###

Q&A](https://github.com/kingname/GeneralNewsExtractor/wiki/GeneralNewsExtractor-Q&A)\n\n## 已知问题\n\n1. 目前本项目只适用于新闻页的信息提取。如果目标网站不是新闻页，或者是今日头条中的相册型文章，那么抽取结果可能不符合预期。\n2. 可能会有一些新闻页面出现抽取结果中的作者为空字符串的情况，这可能是由于文章本身没有作者，或者使用了已有正则表达式没有覆盖到的情况。\n\n\n## Todo\n\n* ~~使用一个配置文件来存放常量数据，而不是直接 Hard Code 写在代码中。~~\n* ~~允许自定义时间、作者的提取Pattern~~\n* ~~新闻文章列表页提取~~\n* 对于多页的新闻，允许传入一个 HTML 列表，GNE 解析以后，自动拼接为完整的新闻正文\n* ~~优化内容提取速度~~\n* ~~测试更多新闻网站~~\n* ……\n\n## 交流沟通\n\n如果您觉得GNE对您的日常开发或公司有帮助，请加作者微信 mekingname（或扫描下方二维码） 并注明\"GNE\"，作者会将你拉入群。\n\n![](https://kingname-1257411235.cos.ap-chengdu.myqcloud.com/IMG_3729_2.JPG)\n\n验证消息：`GNE`\n\n如果你不用微信，那么可以加入 Telegram 群：[https://t.me/joinchat/Bc5swww_XnVR7pEtDUl1vw](https://t.me/joinchat/Bc5swww_XnVR7pEtDUl1vw)\n\n\n## 论文修订\n\n在使用 Python 实现这个抽取器的过程中，我发现论文里面的公式和方法存在一些纰漏，会导致部分节点报错。我将会单独写几篇文章来介绍这里的修改。请关注我的微信公众号：未闻Code：\n\n![](https://kingname-1257411235.cos.ap-chengdu.myqcloud.com/wechatplatform.jpg)\n\n## 致谢\n\n@bigbrother666sh\n"

\"8岁儿子在四川海螺沟景区失联的第32天，9月2日，温先生启程返回湖北十堰。他上次坐火车，是8月2日下午接到孩子妈妈的电话后连夜赶往现场。那时候他觉得，火车到站前，应该就能找到。\\n那天13时30分左右，温先生的前妻李女士与他们的儿子小温正朝红石滩景点出口走去，小温穿着雨鞋，在溪流和小石堆中穿行，走在母亲前面十几米左右，消失在有树遮挡的弯道。\\n此后，五批专业救援队先后到场，数百人次进行地毯式搜寻，家人和警方反复排查监控，十万悬赏线索的消息发出已半个月。被河水冲走、迷失在丛林、遭遇野兽、跌落山崖、掉进冰洞、被人拐卖……种种可能被提出又被排除，小温消失在母亲视野里后到底经历了什么，仍然没有答案。\\n9月9日，开学已满一周，小温还没能去报到。\\n河流、丛林、野兽与冰川\\n小温失联处河流的流域和附近丛林曾是搜索重点。8月2日，有乘坐索道的游客在看到小温照片后表示，曾经看见一个孩子沿着河道向下走。于是警方和景区组织的救援人员沿河道一直搜索，也进入到附近的丛林。\\n小温。\\n红石滩景点位于景区海拔最高、约3600米的四号营地附近，夏季的夜晚依然很冷，有时在十摄氏度以下。小温失联的那天晚上，下了两场雨，小温母亲李女士、公安干警和景区工作人员搜寻至凌晨，浑身湿透。\\n随后两天，海螺沟仍不时有雨，雾气弥漫。大规模的搜救展开，蓝天救援队和甘孜州户外运动专业救援队先后加入，对红石滩周围1.5平方公里范围进行地毯式搜索。该区域的河流水深只到成年人大腿，按理难以冲走一个一米四的孩子。救援人员用竹竿把河里稍深一些的地方摸查了一遍，在河流较平缓及下游一排大石头遮挡处搜寻痕迹，沿着河道向上进行了排查，向下则一直走到了冰洞口附近，没有任何发现。搜索人员深入到了河流两岸的丛林，其中很多地方都能看到游客活动中心或游人的步道，孩子即使误入，也难以迷失。\\n对于孩子可能遭遇野兽的猜测，工作人员向南都记者介绍，景区里不怕人的只有猴子，如雪豹等野生动物只在人迹罕至的原始森林和高山上活动，而红石滩附近游客密集，它们一般不敢接近。救援队认为，如果孩子的确曾被拖行，应该留有明显痕迹。\\n第三天，蓝天救援队搜寻无果离开。第四天，甘孜州户外运动专业救援队撤离。\\n沿小温失联区域的石滩向下约一公里，是冰川的边缘，但其间山路崎岖难行，成年人也需要走一个多小时。与民警结伴在各种缝隙反复搜寻数日无果后，小温父亲决定犯险绕着孩子不太可能抵达的冰川寻找。绕行途中，温先生不慎踩空扭伤左脚，肩膀、腿部也被刺伤，搜寻依然无果。\\n小温失联第六晚，家人一直期望的救援犬终于到来。8月8日早上，雅安市雨城区民生救援队和成都维初林训犬俱乐部重新排查后，表示基本能排除孩子沿河道向上活动的可能，朝河道向下气味信号较多。但这条河有部分流域被监控覆盖，也流经游客较多的地方，监控中却没有小温踪迹。\\n搜救现场。\\n这天傍晚，本来准备至少搜索三天的搜救人员决定提前结束行动，他们为没有找到有效线索感到讶异。该区域地形的搜救难度并不大，而孩子就像是凭空消失。\\n安慰与质疑\\n小温的离奇失联引发广泛关注的同时，各种声音随之而来，其中有安慰和鼓励，也不乏揣测与怀疑。\\n温先生曾说，在孩子失联的沉重打击面前，他能坚持下去，有赖于亲朋好友以及无数陌生人来自天南地北的援助和关心。小温母亲李女士则表示，多支救援队无偿提供支援，搜救人员像是在寻找自己的孩子那样尽心尽力，热心游客提供自己的无人机，她都非常感激。“民间救援队也好，各方的热心群众也好，都一再的给我们鼓励，让我们坚持坚强，不放弃。”\\n但除此之外，李女士也受到了网友的大量质疑。对于母子穿越警戒线游玩的责备，她一次次地说明，当时的警戒线只是两根细线，还有很多游客进入，也没有人挡着。而那些“孩子母亲在采访里完全感觉不到悲伤，甚至冷漠”的评论，李女士也看到了。“我还要找寻各方力量来帮我找孩子，我有时间去悲伤吗？每天晚上自己躺床上睡不着觉，想着儿子就哭，这些我需要去告诉谁？”\\n到后来，她不再愿意再重复孩子失联的过程。“我说了孩子离我多远，所有人都在说怎么可能一抬头这孩子就不见了呢。”她无法回答。但不仅是她，景区录像、搜救的各方，也都没有答案。\\n此外，与李女士同行的朋友为男性的信息曝出后，有关孩子家庭生活的猜测也越来越多。温先生告诉南都记者，小温虽然平时是父亲和奶奶在带，但周末也会跟妈妈一起出去活动。在他眼里，小温理解父母之间的关系，也不缺来自任意一方的关怀。他曾对媒体澄清：“我相信我前妻的人品，这里只有事实，没有八卦故事。”在他看来，别人怎么说不重要，眼前唯一重要的事情只有寻找孩子。\\n冰洞搜索\\n小温消失在一条小溪附近，失联区域的几条小溪汇成河流之后，在落差100米高崖上形成了飞流。高崖底下，水流从一个宽约2米左右的冰洞流入深达数百米的地下冰窟。\\n冰洞。\\n孩子失联第十一天，小温父母收到了民生救援队的消息，那是一个试图结合现有信息解释孩子离奇消失的推演——小温沿着溪流向下走，在一些难以通行的部分从左侧灌木中借道，可能因此避开了监控。“进入300米以下的主流段，如果在主流段河边不慎跌倒，主流段足以将他冲倒并冲走，如果冲走了，在下方200米左右就是冰窟……”\\n小温失联第十四天上午，民生救援队和山地救援队共9人回到现场后才发现，如果推演中的情况真的发生了，有至少三个以上的大石头屏障可以将孩子拦截。他们再从冰洞口由下至上排查至溪流段，依然没有发现。傍晚，两支救援队离开现场。\\n但小温的父母放不下这个最后的疑点。温先生对救援队长说，能派人到洞里去搜一搜，是他的最后一个请求。\\n终于，在小温失联的第二十天，四川民生救援队和公羊救援西南总队带着专业设备进入冰洞进行搜寻。冰洞里坡度约有二、三十度，流速较快，搜救人员用探照灯照着，朝里摸索了十米左右。\\n在一旁守着的温先生后被告知，洞里河水流量不像预想中大，两边是石头和干的地方。就算孩子不幸被冲进去，也很难往更深的地方走。洞里的石头如果移动过，应该有印子，而救援队没有发现这类痕迹。此外，高崖处沙石松动，却没有发现摩擦的痕迹。温先生松了口气，“至少洞里没有。”这也给了孩子母亲一点安慰。“至少，他活着的可能性更大一些。”\\n一线生机\\n从海螺沟景区门口出发，搭乘近一个小时的观光车沿曲折山路抵达三号营地，下车后乘坐缆车才能到达四号营地，缆车下来的索道上站连接着红石滩步行栈道。过去的一个多月里，孩子父母几乎每天都上山，直至把能去的地方数次翻遍，对这个遥远景区的地形道路熟稔无比。随着时间流逝，景区内“没有消息”也成了还算好的消息。\\n他们知道，如果孩子没有出景区，无论是被河水冲走，迷失在丛林，遭遇野兽，跌落山崖，还是掉入冰洞，近一个月没有消息都意味着生存几率无限接近于零，如今唯有被“拐卖”，还留有一些生还的可能。就这样，孩子因被人带走而失联，竟成了小温父母的希望所在。\\n被拐的可能性不是没被考虑过，此前，小温父母的血液已被采样录入失踪儿童数据库。景区游览范围内每隔数十米有监控，出入口和索道也有录像，警方调取录像和实地排查都没有发现小温。\\n小温在景区内的身影。\\n小温最后一次出现在监控视频里，是8月2日13时8分，他从红石滩人行步道顶端往下走，消失在警戒线附近。他失联的第八天，李女士和赶来的两个弟弟将监控录像拷贝出来进行彻底排查，无果。但李女士说，部分录像画面模糊，而且摄像头存在死角，也许会有所遗漏。第十二天，小温父母发布十万悬赏寻求有效线索。至今，关心询问小温下落的人有一些，而期待中的线索暂未出现。\\n开学和期待\\n这是小温升二年级的暑假，母亲和朋友带他出来自驾游，他们的上一站是稻城亚丁，下一站本该是成都欢乐谷。暑假结束在小温失联的第三十一天。\\n小温出发前跟爸爸说好，这趟旅游回来后继续好好锻炼身体。他是校运会上是班级拿奖的主力，跑步和跳远比赛都稳居前三。他失联的第十七天，温先生发了一条朋友圈：“臭小子你别躲了，赶紧给我回来。说好的你这趟玩回来爸给你训练二十天，开学了运动会你们班还指望你拿成绩！”\\n9月2日晚，与当地警方和景区执法局沟通后，温先生乘坐火车返回十堰，没能像一个月前预想那样带回儿子。孩子母亲依然在景区附近。“没有什么打算，只是不想离开这。”\\n小温失联第三十四天，温先生去了一趟孩子的小学。班主任说，孩子的物品已被悉数搬到了新教室，座位和书本都留了给他，学籍的保留也没有问题。确认过后，温先生径直走出了校门。那个新教室里空着的桌椅，以及儿子的同学们，他没敢去看。\\n小温父母在等待，此前通过所有能想到的渠道发布的消息，有一天有人回应。“其实这个时候，需要相信一些因果关系——中国人讲的‘缘’这个事。”温先生对南都记者说，又像在喃喃自语：“是我的孩子，他一定会回来的。”\\n采写：南都见习记者林子沛\"\n}\n<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>tests/toutiao/2.html>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n{\n

\"9月3日，在第二届全球IC企业家大会暨第十七届中国国际半导体博览会开幕式上，中国半导体行业协会副理事长、清华大学微电子所所长魏少军教授在演讲中分析了2018年中国集成电路市场进出口数据，同时指出了中国半导体产业结构的不足之处。\\n2018年进口继续扩大，突破3000亿美元\\n魏少军指出，全球每生产3块集成电路就有2块运到中国来，2018年中国进口集成电路4176亿块，价值3121亿美元；出口集成电路2171亿块，价值846亿美元，由此产生的贸易逆差创下历史新高，达到2275亿美元。\\n中国半导体产业结构扭曲没有将产品作为发展中心\\n魏少军教授强调，中国半导体产业20年前腾飞，主要推动力是对外加工服务，这导致产业结构扭曲，没有产品作为发展中心，且主要依靠外面的客户，这种扭曲的情况急需调整。\\n2018年中国集成电路设计业销售收入全球占比再次提高\\n中国半导体行业协会副理事长、清华大学微电子所所长魏少军表示，2018年中国集成电路设计业销售收入为2519.3亿元，比2017年的2073.5亿元增长21.5%，增速比上年的26.1%回落4.6个百分点。在全球集成电路设计业的占比将再次提高。2018年，中国集成电路产业各主要环节继续维持两位数的高速增长，设计业和制造业的增长率超过20%，但封测业增速回落到20%以下。其中，芯片制造业增速最高达到25.6%；设计业位列第二为21.5%。封测业销售额第一次超过2000亿元。\\n中国集成电路设计业的产品分布在通信、智能卡、计算机、多媒体、导航、模拟、功率和消费电子等所有8个领域，企业的数量都在增加。未来，中国集成电路产业应抓住5G、虚拟现实（VR）与增强现实（AR）、物联网、医疗健康、超高清晰度电视及显示技术、人工智能与类脑计算、自动驾驶等带来的机遇，积极探索适合中国的集成电路产业模式，以产品为中心重塑中国集成电路产业。\\n魏少军表示，因为中国产业结构和国际上发达国家不一样，三业（设计业、制造业和封测业）分离，IDM规模很小。在中国集成电路设计业的销售统计中，近乎100%是由中国本地企业贡献。其中通信集成电路占据40.6%，产业结构不合理。制造业方面，预计约50%由外资和台资在大陆的企业贡献。封测则有30%由外资以及台资在大陆的企业贡献。\"\n}\n<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>tests/guancha/guancha.html>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n{\n

\"【文/观察者网专栏作者王文】\\n“中美贸易战正在变成一场持久战，但我们已有准备。”在东莞洪梅镇，海新科技董事长杨敬辉当面告诉笔者。这家以生产综合型厨房电器为主、近半数产品销往美国的高新技术企业受到美国加征关税的巨大影响，但杨敬辉显然对自己产品很自信，他说，“我们有底气与美国进口商谈判与合作，分摊特朗普加征关税的冲击。我们也有更多办法，如提升技术含量、开辟更多国际市场，进而对冲美国无端加税的消极影响。”\\n近日，笔者率队赴广州、东莞与深圳密集调研，与20多家机构数百人当面访谈与交流，经常能感受到像杨敬辉这样的豪情人士，虽受大冲击，但乐观向上，不折不挠，想尽办法解决当下困境，绑定国运，扎实前行。\\n特朗普“速胜”企图已在穗莞深破产\\n全球25%智能手机、20%毛衣、30%玩具、10%眼镜与运动鞋均产自东莞，中美经贸摩擦对东莞市的影响可想而知。笔者与东莞市政府八个部门相关负责人座谈后得知，一年前，由于中美贸易摩擦不断升温，一些投资者信心不足，抛售股票，拖累股价不跌，东莞设立上市莞企发展投资基金，先后为6家上市公司提供纾困资金，传导信心，有效保障了在莞上市公司面临的股票质押风险及流动性危机。\\n2019年1-7月，东莞规模以上工业增加值同比增长6.8%，进出口同比增长4.4%，两者数据虽比上半年均有少许回落，但远高于全国水平。在国内外复杂严峻形势下，东莞企业喜忧参半。先进制造业、高技术制造业规模以上工业增加值分别增长了10.4%、17.3%，其中电子信息制造业同比增长高达17.8%。但纺织服装鞋帽制造业、造纸及纸制品业则呈负增长，同比分别下降3%和0.7%。\\n贸易战导致的原材料购进受限、环保与人工成本增加等原因，的确逼迫企业转型。在全球最大女鞋生产企业之一的华坚集团东莞总部，一位在流水线上忙碌的工人告诉笔者，每天工作10小时左右，有周末，吃住都包，月末能尽拿五六千元人民币。“但在埃塞，工人工资一般只有100美元左右。这里会升级为研发中心。”华坚董事长张华荣对笔者坦承。这位多次受党和国家领导接见的优秀企业家从2011年开始到埃塞俄比亚投资办厂，已获园区用地1.38平方公里，年出口创汇20亿美元，员工上万人。在张华荣眼里，华坚志在全球。\\n华坚鞋业生产车间\\n在全球最大手机代工企业之一的华勤通讯，某高管表示，5G时代，美国技术不占有优势，肯定打垮不了中国企业，而手机企业有不少替代方案。当然，他承认，笔记本电脑类的生产与销售可能由于芯片技术等原因受到的影响会大一些。\\n截止8月中旬，一份对东莞587家重点企业的调研，美国对剩余3000亿美元清单加征关税后，预计订单量“没有影响的”占24.6%，“略有下滑（10%以内）”占34.3%，严重下滑（超过30%）仅占6.5%。调研企业反映，目前人民币持续贬值有利于对冲出口风险，但不确定性正在增强。“东莞人的顽强性格决定了，未来虽难，但一定会有出路”，主抓当地企业家培训的东莞市思源职业学校校长江波说，“至少特朗普想要借贸易战速胜中国的企图，在东莞企业家面前彻底破产。”\\n在深圳大疆、深圳海能达等企业，笔者同样听到了不少企业界人士的坚定信心。在深圳证券交易所，60%投资者认为贸易战会长期持续。80%被调查者在投资决策时会考虑贸易战因素，但仅有1/3投资者在减仓。正如《日本经济新闻》近日报道，中国无惧“比拼耐力”。\"\n}\n<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>tests/163/5.html>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n{\n

\"（原标题：多地项目连环爆雷狂奔的龙湖集团“暗伤”曝露？）\\n2019年，\\n龙湖集团\\n即将迎来赴港上市10周年。十年前带领龙湖集团成功赴港上市并跻身内地女首富的\\n吴亚军\\n，在前不久召开的中期业绩会上表示，“对一家上市公司来说，没有故事就是好故事，龙湖没有故事”。不料话音刚落，来自全国各地龙湖楼盘的业主就以实际维权行动，将近年来的“龙湖故事”公诸于众。\\n近日，龙湖集团公布了2019年中期业绩报告。上半年，龙湖实现合约销售金额1056.2亿元，同比增长8.8%；营业额385.7亿元，同比增长42.2%；归属于股东的净利润为63.1亿元，核心溢利为47.0亿元，同比增长26%。\\n然而，在这份亮丽的成绩单背后，龙湖的盈利能力却在走下坡路，其上半年销售毛利率和净利率分别较去年同期下滑4.51个百分点和3.26个百分点；资产报酬率和投入资本回报率也均较去年同期下滑0.21个百分点。而公司毛利率和净利率的下滑，又和公司多个项目爆发质量问题有一定关系。据《红周刊》记者了解，龙湖多地项目均存在各种违规销售及施工问题。\\n业绩会突现业主维权插曲\\n昔日“龙湖质量”遭质疑\\n8月26日，龙湖集团董事长吴亚军正在业绩会上展望公司的未来发展，一位来自长沙的维权业主打乱了现场的节奏。香港《明报》曝光的现场视频显示，一位自称龙湖业主的男子在业绩会上情绪激动地表示，“龙湖在长沙所有的楼盘都在维权，无一例外”。其购买的楼盘在收房的过程中发现楼盘质量出现问题，业主虽多次与龙湖沟通，但龙湖方面并未给出实际有效的解决方案。\\n记者了解到，涉事项目的名称为长沙“龙湖水晶郦城”，合同约定以精装房交付。龙湖方面于27日对外回应称，龙湖确实存在与项目业主沟通不到位、交付品质有瑕疵的现象，公司将针对业主的合理要求迅速、积极改进相关产品和服务，且目前双方已达成谅解。\\n实际上，龙湖集团口中的交付品质“瑕疵”更像是对施工标准的“放宽”。以维权业主在业绩会上提及的新风系统安装工程为例，该小区燃气出气口与新风系统进气口距离仅约50公分，但根据住建部公布的住宅新风系统技术标准，室外新风口与污染物排放口的距离不能小于1.5米。房屋查验咨询师、名仕宜居验房公司高级工程师王清华向《红周刊》记者表示，专业机构一般建议业主自装新风系统时尽量将新风口与污染物排放口安置在不同墙面。即使是水平或垂直安置，也尽量保持2米以上的距离。若新风口与燃气出气口仅有50公分的距离，业主在同时使用燃气热水器和新风系统时极有可能发生严重的安全事故。\\n王清华分析称，上述违规安装情况是较为典型的偷工减料行为。从施工流程来讲，近距离打眼、钻孔无须额外挪动设备位置，无须额外核对线路图、管路图、结构图以防止打到钢筋、电线、水管及其他设施，能够节省大量人力成本；从安装成本来讲，卫生间吊顶可以隐藏管道、方便施工，如果变换钻空位置可能会增加管道，前期施工缺陷导致的开口困难也会增加重新测距钻孔的成本。对于上述违规安装行为，建设单位、监理单位、施工单位及总包方都负有不可推卸的责任。\\n龙湖方面也承认，虽然负责该项目新风系统安置工程的只是其合作商，但公司作为精装交付项目的\\n开发商\\n具有不可推卸的责任。据该项目业主介绍，目前龙湖方面已经对上述工程漏洞采取了整改措施，即在部分业主的外墙加长新风系统进气口管道以防止进气污染，若方案可行将面向全部问题房屋进行整改。这样的整改势必对龙湖今年的营收成本有所影响，若整改不利还会进一步升高总体成本。\\n此外，《红周刊》记者还从该项目业主提供的一份举报信中了解到，长\\n沙龙\\n湖水晶郦城项目还存在房屋精装修没有第三方造价清单备案文件、涉嫌违规高价搭售精装房行为；样板间建设违反政府规定，商品房销售合同附件中存在违反政府样板间政策的免责条款，且在项目交付前违规拆除样板间，涉嫌掩盖实际交付房屋装修品质下降的事实等行为。\\n对此，龙湖方面相关负责人向记者表示，长沙市住建局对当地商品房全装修建设实施细则的公布日期晚于水晶郦城项目的合同签售日期，该项目不受开发商交付精装修第三方造假清单备案文件相关条款的约束。不过，据业主提供的长沙市住建局《关于龙湖水晶郦城项目部分购房人信访事项的答复》，龙湖擅自拆除样板房的行为确属违规，有关部门已责令其整改并按原标准重建样板房。但该项目业主表示，自7月26日收到答复函以来，被拆除的样板间一直未按规定重建，业主所质疑的项目“高价低配”问题至今没有答案。\\n维权业主对于龙湖长沙楼盘陷入大面积维权的质疑引发了业内外不少唏嘘，毕竟早年的龙湖一直被称以业界翘楚，“龙湖质量”的标榜意义甚至高于以产品质量著称的绿城中国，绿城创始人宋卫平还曾以龙湖为榜样，带领其领导班子前往龙湖参观学习。“善待你一生”作为吴亚军“一战成名”的经典广告语，如今却与龙湖多地项目的“连环”爆雷形成了鲜明的对比。\\n多地项目连环爆雷\\n整改及交付难题或拖累业绩表现\\n实际上，亲赴龙湖业绩会的业主所代表的长沙水晶郦城项目仅仅是龙湖楼盘维权的冰山一角，《红周刊》记者调查发现，其维权项目还遍布上海、浙江、福建等多个地区。据部分项目的业主介绍，龙湖目前已经开始针对部分存在的问题进行整改，但整改方案并未覆盖项目存在的所有漏洞，有些项目的整改效果也并不乐观，福建的一个项目甚至出现了二次整改的情况。\\n不得不说，面对多地项目的“连环爆雷”，龙湖不仅面临着整改成本拖累盈利表现的压力，还极有可能因整改效果不佳而陷入项目无法按期交付的违约困局，进而影响当期营业收入的结算。\\n以龙湖在福建晋江的观宸项目为例，据项目业主介绍，原本应当于2019年12月份交房的观宸项目二期、三期工程，在2018年便陆续出现开发商擅改大门建设方案、绿化缩水、外墙大面积空鼓不平等问题。经业主多次维权后，龙湖虽然还原了大门建设方案并修补了外墙，但修补后的外墙仍存在色差明显、大面积空鼓脱落等质量问题。如今，龙湖方面未同意业主关于重建外墙的诉求，仅承诺在现有基础上继续修补并延长项目工程质保期限以及改善小区内绿化情况。该项目业主表示，如果工程质量及相关配套在交付日期还未有合理改善，业主们或将拒绝交房并继续维权，这意味着龙湖观宸项目或面临因无法按期交付而承担违约责任的风险，并影响到该项目预收账款的结转。\\n无独有偶，2016年12月交付的南京龙湖春江紫宸项目，仅不到一年的时间便出现了外墙大面积开裂、脱落等问题，2018年8月份台风过境后，该楼盘一期的4幢住宅楼的外墙因频发脱落事故而被铲掉重铺。据澎湃新闻报道，龙湖方面为此已新增成本数千万元。《红周刊》记者注意到，龙湖近年来营业支出（不含包括地价等在内的营业成本）的增速远高于其营收和净利的增速，2016年至2018年间，龙湖的营业支出分别为34.5亿元、50.9亿元和85.9亿元，三年内增幅高达149%（营收增幅为112%），2019年上半年更是同比增长35.7%至35.9亿元。\\n此外，上海龙湖天璞项目也因存在虚假宣传、故意隐瞒事实、二期工程减配遭遇业主维权，后期的整改方案将增加龙湖多少“计划外”的营业成本，还是个未知数。该项目业主向记者表示，龙湖在销售期间将规划中的外部公共道路虚假宣传为小区内部道路，并且该项目的绿化情况及车道等配套设施也均与龙湖在销售宣传阶段的承诺相差甚远。目前龙湖仅向业主提供了小区绿化的整改方案，而严重影响甚至误导业主购房判断的小区河边道路及车道等核心问题均未解决。\\n值得一提的是，目前龙湖位于厦门的春江彼岸项目已经出现了交房日期已到，但部分业主因精装交付标准未达成一致而拒绝收房的情况，若项目方一直无法打破与业主之间的“交房僵局”，将直接影响到该项目预收账款的结转。\\n《红周刊》记者向龙湖集团相关负责人核实相关项目的整改情况，但截至发稿前公司并未回复。\\n狂奔之下的“暗伤”曝露？\\n总结龙湖业主维权项目的具体情况不难发现，这些项目的交付时间基本集中在2018年至2019年，商品房预售合同的签订时间则集中于2016年至2017年。这个时间段也正是龙湖“变速”的关键阶段。\\n2016年，无论对于龙湖还是整个房地产行业而言都是一个重要的年份。彼时的房地产行业迎来了一个“新的周期”：宏观调控高光时刻到来，TOP5龙头房企的销售规模达到2000亿，第二梯队的门槛也上升到了千亿级。面对行业大环境的变化，主流房企加快了“拼规模”的步伐，龙湖投身这场巨变，开启了变速模式。\\n那一年，龙湖立下了多个里程碑：全年共拿下43幅土地并新落子合肥，新增土地数量较2015年近乎翻倍；全年实现合同销售881.4亿元，同比增长率高达61.6%。此后龙湖延续了这股增长势头，于2017年完成了千亿目标，并在2018年加入2000亿阵营，跻身十强。\\n进入2019年，龙湖的变速模式有些许降温，公司开始强调以财务稳健为主。不过与此同时，龙湖在规模高速扩张的过程中埋下的诸多违规销售与施工的隐患，也伴随着多地项目的“连环爆雷”浮出水面。\\n有资深业内人士向《红周刊》记者分析称，近年来由于受一城一策、因城施策影响，部分城市的开发商面临较大的限价限贷等政策压力，利润空间有所缩减，加之部分项目对承包方、施工方监管不严等，有些项目开始出现偷工减料、虚假宣传、乱收费等违法违规行为，这也是整个行业亟待规范的乱象。但如果某一家房企在多个城市的多个项目都面临严重的维权纠纷，甚至出现大面积的项目爆雷，就说明该企业管理层的管理模式已经出现了问题，部分项目负责人的价值也出现了偏差，需要企业管理层反思和纠正。\\n从公司业绩表现来看，龙湖近年来在维权项目上“消耗”的整改成本，或成为其毛利率和净利率走低的一个原因。据Wind资讯数据，2019年上半年，龙湖集团的销售毛利率和净利率分别较去年同期下滑4.51个百分点和3.26个百分点；资产报酬率和投入资本回报率也均较去年同期下滑0.21个百分点。\\n值得一提的是，龙湖集团2016年至2018年的土地储备平均成本占营业销售均价的比重一直处于39%至41%之间。三年来，龙湖土地储备平均成本的增幅仅约为29.2%，但其在此三年间的营业成本和营业支出增幅却分别高达100.5%和149%。在土地成本占房企营收成本较大份额的情况下，土地成本相对稳定的龙湖，其快速增加的营业成本和支出来自哪里？\\n经过三年狂奔的龙湖，在众多项目爆发业主维权的糟糕时期，其还有哪些“暗伤”需要排查？这需要龙湖给投资者作一个交代。\\n本文来源：证券市场红周刊\\n责任编辑：杨倩_NF4425\"\n}\n<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>tests/163/6.html>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n{\n

\"杭州市学军中学校长陈立群要退休了，作为全国重点高中校长、教育部中学校长培训中心兼职教授、享受国务院特殊津贴的专家，他在全国教育界都广获认可，有民办高中开出年薪两百多万挖他，但这个“名校长”却做了一个决定，让很多人看不明白。\\n2016年，\\n他来到贵州黔东南苗族侗族自治州台江县，\\n当这个国家级贫困县唯一一所中学的校长。\\n这是所高考成绩在全州垫底的“差校”，而他开出的唯一条件是：\\n解决吃住，分文不取。\\n陈立群的自我评价是，不置一分钱房产，不炒一分钱股票，写过16本书，当过5所中学的校长。\\n他要在这所“差校”实践平民教育的理想，在苗族人口占比98%的“天下苗族第一县”，给这帮苗族孩子开启人生的另一种可能，更要影响成千上万户苗族家庭的未来。\\n1\\n全国名校长在小地方遇难题\\n来台江前，他最放心不下90岁的母亲，老母亲得知儿子要去支教，非常支持：“我身体好着呢，不信我跟你打赌。”而台江县教育局局长龙峰不知道，他大胆的邀请，能否得到陈立群的同意。\\n邀请说出口，龙峰自己都觉得不切实际，况且就算陈立群答应了，台江这座偏远且贫困的县城，又能拿什么招待好这位名校长呢？\\n然而陈校长没开条件，“解决吃住就行”卸任浙江省的国家重点高中校长，来到距离杭州1400公里外的贵州山区，陈立群开启了他分文不取的支教生涯。\\n支教绝不是一次理想的浪漫之旅，一身西服、打着领带、背着双肩包，师生都被这位空降的校长“帅”到了。\\n但刚在学校转了一圈，陈立群的眉头就皱了起来：\\n这哪像学校的样子啊？\\n3000多名学生只有一个食堂，\\n刚端出来的菜盆边上，\\n密密麻麻停满了苍蝇。\\n几十个人挤在一间宿舍，\\n公共厕所气味扑鼻……\\n陈校长从硬件着手，改善食堂环境，从一口锅，变成三个食堂六口锅。\\n学生搬进了六到八人、带独立卫生间的宿舍。偏远山区硬件条件不好能够理解，可民中的教师状态和学习氛围之差，才更让陈校长感到诧异。\\n校园本是宁静之地，可是台江民中晚自习，吵吵嚷嚷好似菜市场，老师不管，学生不学。\\n刚来，他面对的便是险滩硬茬。陈校长决定从课堂氛围下手，他带着小板凳旁听一节高三语文课。结果老师不负责任、照本宣科，把作文的开头当作了结尾去讲。还有教师迟到早退，45分钟的课20分钟讲完就走了，这让他感到诧异，并痛下决心，准备改变。\\n不破，不立。\\n对待“乱校”须用“铁腕”，\\n他的“雷霆手段”接踵而来，\\n直击学校沉疴。\\n随后，陈校长又将另一名老师调离岗位，因为他上课没有教案，跟着感觉走。不到一个月，两位老师接连被撤岗，这件事震动了黔东南教育界。\\n很多习惯松散的老师，一下子把精神都绷紧了。课堂大于天，这个理念唤醒了全县的老师。陈校长制定新的规章制度，把这所原本涣散的学校拉回正轨。\\n2\\n爱与责任\\n“一所学校最重要的学生是老师。”他用“雷霆手段”唤醒老师们的责任心。显然，一味“雷霆手段”也不是他的初衷，\\n如何提振教师士气、激发教师潜能，\\n成了陈校长急需解决的另一道难题。\\n新学期开学，他收到一封辞职信：“我是铁了心要走。”这突如其来的辞职信是刘明老师写的。\\n陈校长赶到台江县人民医院，原来刘明的妻子头天晚上生了第二个孩子。\\n刘明坦言，3000元要养活家里六口人，难。不得已才想离开工作了15年的民族中学，去薪水更高的民办中学。\\n听了这，陈校长挽留的话实在说不出口。他何尝不知道教师收入微薄的难处？他只能说，学生们都很想你，盼你能回来。刘明听了眼睛一红“辞职信我收回吧……”\\n陈校长几乎每个月都要面临这样的挽留。因为待遇跟不上，台江民中每年都有十几位教师离职。为了解决教师待遇问题，他没少跟当地教育部门争取，增设目标考核奖、教学质量奖等，但当地财力实在有限，到手的补助杯水车薪。\\n他把20多万元奖金捐出来，\\n那是国务院特殊津贴和杭州杰出人才奖，\\n在台江设立“奖教金”，\\n每年奖励9名教师，每人5000元。\\n他拒绝了年薪200多万的高薪，来到贫困山区，分文不取。反而资助学生、奖励老师。陈校长在贵州支教三年期间，走访过100多名学生的家，资助学生家庭的累计达10多万元。\\n他去过最远的一个孩子的家，需要先开车一个半小时，再坐烧着柴油的小船45分钟，最后走路半个小时。\\n更让陈校长焦虑不安的是，另一座横亘在人心里的“大山”，台江县至今仍然没有脱贫，群众依靠外出打工赚取微薄收入，留守在家的儿童数量居高不下。\\n当地流行的观念是“读书无用论”、“早点打工好”：大节三六九，小节天天有；喝酒、斗牛、打麻将；等着别人送小康。\\n陈立群到任后召开家长会，看到有的班家长还没老师多，可见教育在当地人心中的位置。台江民中作为全县唯一的高中，过去几年，高考成绩在全州垫底。\\n一些学生靠着国家和社会的资助，注重享受而不思进取，学生对手机的迷恋超乎想象，早恋、抽烟、沉迷游戏等现象频发，每年都有百余名学生辍学。面对这样的孩子和家长，他又能如何？\\n他打的第一张牌就是严格管理，宣布开展校园安静环境学习月。原先像是四处撒欢儿野马驹的学生，突然被新校长的这根缰绳一拉，像是有一记无形的教鞭抽在了心上，一盘散沙式的学习氛围在逐渐改变。浮躁止于宁静，惊雷响于无声。\\n如果说行为习惯可以刻意培养，那么对学生精神层面进行引导，才正是陈校长大显身手的时候。通过国旗下演讲、成人仪式，他去激发学生的斗志。\\n这些学生们从没有听过的活动，给他们打开了一扇人生的新大门。经常有学生给陈校长写信：\\n“是您的到来，才让我\\n有了走出贵州这个不平凡的想法。\\n”\\n3\\n他改变的\\n不只是这群苗族孩子\\n因为陈校长，台江民族中学的一大批学生，改变了生活的选择，改变了命运的轨迹。\\n2017年6月，他带的首届毕业生高考，全县人都把目光投向了这唯一的高中，当揭开榜单看到成绩的那一刻，从家长到亲友无不感到欣喜。一本从40多个翻到100多个。\\n往年，台江中考前100名的学生中，留在台江民族中学的只有十来个人，\\n而2018年这数字翻了几倍，到95人，\\n全县中考状元也第一次留在民中。\\n2019年，全校885名学生参加高考，有561人考取了本科，本科成绩完成率达到了183%。老师们体会到了前所未有的幸福感。得到老百姓的认同，尊严感就上来了。\\n无论是对学生，还是老师、家长，他都重视“心灵唤醒”、“精神教育”，通过激发学生们的进取心和责任心，改变了很多贫困家庭的命运。尊师重教的民风慢慢形成。\\n陈校长号召老师们走进寨子，把社会最底层撬动起来，让苗民们充分认识到教育的意义：\\n考出一个孩子，\\n脱贫一个家庭，\\n带动一个寨子。\\n陈校长的微信头像，是台江县小江小学，那是一所教室用木板钉起来、四面通风的老旧小学。陈校长以此激励自己，争取给孩子更好的求学机会。才能用教育阻断贫穷代际传递。\\n“给钱总是要花光的，给物资总是要用完的，唯有把农民的孩子培养好，才能使家庭的贫困不会成为世袭。”\\n——陈立群：《我的教育主张》\\n他谢绝了省州县一切奖金补贴，也谢绝了一切宴请饭局，别人宴请时，他总以“我是来支教的”来谢绝。他要为台江培养一支不走的教师队伍。\\n所有的帮扶总是暂时的，\\n所有的支教总是要结束的，\\n关键在于增强可持续发展的造血功能。\\n台江县周边县城的小初高校长，都是他的徒弟。不仅仅是台江民中的老师受益，全县老师都受益。\\n4\\n一批贫困生被扭转的人生\\n陈校长34年中当过5所学校的校长，面对不同的生源和起点，他都把后进的学校带到拔尖的水平，成就了响当当的“全国名校长”美誉。\\n19年前，陈校长在杭州长河高级中学创办了浙江省首届宏志班。2001年，正在一个小作坊打工的董永军，突然接到电话让他回家，他还不知道，家里来的人，将是改变他一生命运的人。\\n那天下雨，他没想到眼前这位是校长，而陈校长也没有想到，这个用泥瓦搭盖、多处漏风的土屋，竟然就是董永军的家。因为父亲常年赌博，董永军家里几乎一贫如洗。陈校长按捺着内心的诧异，把录取通知书交给了董永军。\\n陈校长专程送给董永军的通知书，是浙江首个宏志班的首届录取通知书。宏志班招收品学兼优、家庭困难的学生，为他们免除一切费用、提供补贴。\\n“人生而平等”，带着这样的初心，陈校长摸着石头过河。为了筹集资金，他数不清敲了多少家企业大门，走访了多少山区中学，吃了多少次闭门羹。\\n这些宏志生们的性格问题逐渐显露。体弱多病、内心自卑，不愿意和外界接触。为了改善宏志生们的性格，他教学生怎么生活，不能死读书。\\n他提议成立铜管乐队、长跑队，孩子们变得阳光、乐观、自信了。\\n陈校长对这些寒门学子的改变，\\n不仅仅是命运上的，\\n还有心理上、心态上的。\\n拥抱着这样的爱与责任，浙江省首届宏志生交出优异成绩单，首届宏志班51人中有45名上了一本线，第一名被清华大学录取。\\n陈校长一共带出了12届宏志班，招收的951名学生全部考上大学。相比于成绩，他更坚信一句话：\\n“教育首先是精神成长，\\n其次才成为科学获知的一部分。\\n”\\n在董永军看来，陈校长给他最珍贵的，是给了他“精神支柱”。有一次高中放假，陈校长送他回家，一眼看去房子没了，他家变成了一片废墟，墙全倒了，什么都没了。董永军一下子崩溃了，呆呆地站在废墟上，眼泪止不住地流。陈校长走过来拍着他的肩说，\\n这个家没了，你在杭州还有一个家。\\n董永军这辈子都不会忘记这句话，此后放假，校长都会带他去家里住两天，即便他的成长过程中缺失过爱，但在宏志班，他得到的全都是爱。\\n5\\n反哺这个时代\\n当年的宏志生在回报\\n“儿去贵州，不为功利，不求功德，只为心愿。”这是陈立群告别老母亲的话，不止如此，他还把一个人的支教，变成一群人的勠力同心。\\n从创办宏志班,到现在办好一所宏志校，陈立群走过这么一条路，“爱与责任”的办学理念，影响到更多学生和老师。一批批宏志生已经长大成人，将宏志精神传递到更多的土壤上。\\n朱华彬和宏志班的同学一起去看望校长时，苗族孩子身上的那种无力感，和想要改变自己命运的眼神，直勾勾地戳进了朱华彬心里，就像看到了当年的自己。他们决心像校长那样去帮助更多的孩子，他们正筹备宏志基金，\\n以帮助更多的孩子实现求学梦。\\n陈校长当年用心呵护的幼苗已经长大，他唤醒的不只是孩子们的宏图大志，更是用爱唤醒了他们那份感恩的心。\\n这样的一种传递，这样一种奇妙的命运相系，跨越时间和地域，让我们看到爱的力量，人性的光芒，以及这片土地的希望。\\n教育的最大魅力，不仅仅是锦上添花，让好的更好，而是雪中送炭。\\n在《时代楷模发布厅》的现场，中宣部副部长梁言顺颁发奖章和证书，授予“时代楷模”陈立群以国家荣誉。\\n在很多学校都挑剔生源质量的今天，那些聚光灯照不到的贫困家庭孩子，那些所谓的“差校学生”、基础薄弱的“留守儿童”，我们如何给他们光明的前途？\\n他用“花甲之年入深山”的行动，给了我们答案：人，生而不同，禀赋不同，成长的环境也不同。教育的神奇，就是千百万像陈校长这样，有理想、敢担当的老师创造的。\\n在第35个教师节来临之际，当年宏志班的前三届学生代表和台江中学的苗族孩子们，特意为陈校长送上节日的礼物。\\n首届宏志班班长陈水珠，在浙江化工进出口公司任高级主管第二届宏志班班长高坚强，在华媒控股任董事会秘书，第三届宏志班班长张巧月，在自主创业。他们代表陈校长带出的951名宏志班学生，为校长准备了宏志生迈向社会后的成绩单，\\n教人无问贵贱，\\n育人不分优劣，\\n让我们一起道一声：\\n老师，您辛苦了。\"\n}\n<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>tests/sina/sina.html>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n{\n  \"title\": \"最强“中国芯”本月商用 华为抢跑5G芯片大战\",\n  \"author\": \"张申\",\n  \"publish_time\": \"2019年09月07日 04:04\",\n  \"content\": \"原标题：最强“中国芯”本月商用 华为抢跑5G芯片大战\\n用户对性能永无止境的追求，让芯片领域迎来了巅峰对决。昨天，“中国芯”再传喜讯，历经3年准备2年研发，华为推出了多项指标世界领先的\\n麒麟990 5G一体化芯片\\n。记者获悉，本月伴随苹果新机发售的A13预计还是4G芯片，至于被高通寄予厚望的5G集成芯片骁龙865可能到明年初才能量产。这次华为推出的麒麟990芯片已将5G基带集成在内，成为全球首款5G一体化芯片。\\n巨头暗战5G芯片\\n步入5G时代，手机用户对芯片的AI和5G能力日益看重。虽然联发科和紫光也会发布5G芯片，但其产品普遍应用于低端手机中。在华为、高通和苹果的中高端手机三国杀中，麒麟990 5G芯片首个面市量产。\\n不仅如此，麒麟990 5G还在全球率先支持5G双卡，一卡5G上网时另一卡仍可通话。它还是业内最小的5G手机芯片，采用了业界最先进的极紫外光刻技术，拥有全球最快的2.3Gbps峰值下载速率和1.25Gbps上行峰值速率。本月，内置麒麟990 5G的华为Mate 30就会正式发布，麒麟990 5G也将商用。\\n硬件上麒麟990 5G有着史上最强CPU，用了两个大核，两个中核，四个小核，兼顾了性能和能效。在彰显软实力的芯片架构上，麒麟990搭载了达芬奇架构实现了行业领先的AI计算能力。\\n大家普遍认为PC性能强，但华为院士艾伟表示，目前已没有任何一款PC处理器芯片的AI处理能力可达到麒麟990 5G的水平。通过达芬奇架构，麒麟990 5G可以采用大核和小核处理器分别完成不同工作。而小核的好处就是极致低功耗，可以降低5G手机发热问题。例如大核可以处理视频和游戏，小核能进行人脸识别，避免了大马拉小车的难题。\\n采用全球最前沿芯片工艺\\n基于7纳米工艺，麒麟990 5G成了全球首款晶体管数超过100亿的移动终端芯片。麒麟980芯片曾以不到一平方厘米装下69亿个晶体管而震惊世界。这次的990却以几乎同样大小放下了103亿个晶体管。这究竟是怎么做到的？\\n“990采用了业界最先进的极紫外光刻技术，工艺的进步让华为能把晶体管越做越小，管间连线也越来越细。”艾伟说，“华为对每颗芯片都精雕细琢，就像做一个工艺品。”\\n在这颗不到一平方厘米的芯片背后，是华为历经的3年准备与2年研发，以及至少超过3000名工程师的持续攻关。“下一代芯片华为已经在紧锣密鼓的研发中，最快明年大家就能见到它。”艾伟告诉记者。\\n多数人对芯片工艺没有任何概念，然而工艺水平却直接关系到你我手机的性能和能效。换言之，工艺不好您的手机很快就会变成“暖宝宝”，续航也大受影响。当年高通被吐槽为“火龙”的骁龙810就采用了落后的20纳米工艺，结果芯片一发热就降频，一降频就卡顿，HTC、三星、LG等手机受累流失了不少用户。\\n然而最先进的工艺，也意味着最难的技术挑战。2015年面临工艺选择的十字路口，这是华为未来究竟要走高端还是低端的决定性时刻。“每次芯片产品换代都会遇到工程技术上的巨大挑战，我们能走过来真有九死一生的感觉。”艾伟说。\\n麒麟950在2015年全球首家选择了最先进的16纳米工艺。也正是从950开始，麒麟芯片第一次站在业界工艺选择的最前沿。随后的麒麟970和麒麟980分别实现了10纳米和7纳米的全球首家商用。\\n5G芯片累计研发投入10亿美元\\n硬件再好，用户最在意的还是体验感受。记者近日试用某品牌5G手机发现，在高速行车中伴随着4G与5G网络频繁切换，在线音乐软件频繁出现声音断续无法正常播放的问题。\\n“搭载了麒麟990 5G的手机可不会出现这个问题。”华为海思品牌总监林江艳说。她解释，针对高速移动和弱信号场景，麒麟990 5G做了专门优化。即便在每小时120公里时速的情况下，麒麟990 5G因为有基于机器学习的信道模型匹配技术，可达到更好的速率，提升下行速度，这些功能在5G时代初期信号覆盖不好的情况下尤其必要。\\n据艾伟披露，迄今为止华为在5G相关芯片研发的累计投入上已超过10亿美元。\\n责任编辑：张申\"\n}\n<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>tests/sina/3.html>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n{\n
