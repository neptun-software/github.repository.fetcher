Process **2K** resolution image with a **Fast** speed on common PCs or Mobiles! **Beter** than research demos!  \nPlease try online portrait image matting on [my personal homepage](https://zhke.io/#/?modnet_demo) for fun!    \n\n在线应用中使用的模型（未发布）大小仅为**7M**！可以在普通PC或移动设备上**快速**处理具有**2K**分辨率的图像！效果比研究示例**更好**！  \n请通过[我的主页](https://zhke.io/#/?modnet_demo)在线尝试图片抠像！\n\n\n## Research Demo\n\nAll the models behind the following demos are trained on the datasets mentioned in [our paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.11961.pdf).\n\n### Portrait Image Matting\nWe provide an [online Colab demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1GANpbKT06aEFiW-Ssx0DQnnEADcXwQG6?usp=sharing) for portrait image matting.  \nIt allows you to upload portrait images and predict/visualize/download the alpha mattes.\n\n<!-- <img src=\"doc/gif/image_matting_demo.gif\" width='40%'> -->\n\n### Portrait Video Matting\nWe provide two real-time portrait video matting demos based on WebCam. When using the demo, you can move the WebCam around at will.\nIf you have an Ubuntu system, we recommend you to try the [offline demo](demo/video_matting/webcam) to get a higher *fps*. Otherwise, you can access the [online Colab demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Pt3KDSc2q7WxFvekCnCLD8P0gBEbxm6J?usp=sharing).  \nWe also provide an [offline demo](demo/video_matting/custom) that allows you to process custom videos.\n\n<!-- <img src=\"doc/gif/video_matting_demo.gif\" width='60%'> -->\n\n\n## Community\n\nWe share some cool applications/extentions of MODNet built by the community.\n\n<!-- - **WebGUI for Portrait Image Matting** --> \n<!-- You can try [this WebGUI](https://www.gradio.app/hub/aliabd/modnet) (hosted on [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/)) for portrait image matting from your browser without code! -->\n\n- **Colab Demo of Bokeh (Blur Background)**  \nYou can try [this Colab demo](https://colab.research.google.com/github/eyaler/avatars4all/blob/master/yarok.ipynb) (built by [@eyaler](https://github.com/eyaler)) to blur the backgroud based on MODNet!\n\n- **ONNX Version of MODNet**  \nYou can convert the pre-trained MODNet to an ONNX model by using [this code](onnx) (provided by [@manthan3C273](https://github.com/manthan3C273)). You can also try [this Colab demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1P3cWtg8fnmu9karZHYDAtmm1vj1rgA-f?usp=sharing) for MODNet image matting (ONNX version).\n\n- **TorchScript Version of MODNet**  \nYou can convert the pre-trained MODNet to an TorchScript model by using [this code](torchscript) (provided by [@yarkable](https://github.com/yarkable)).\n\n- **TensorRT Version of MODNet**  \nYou can access [this Github repository](https://github.com/jkjung-avt/tensorrt_demos) to try the TensorRT version of MODNet (provided by [@jkjung-avt](https://github.com/jkjung-avt)).\n\n- **Docker Container for MODnet**  \nYou can access [this Github repository](https://github.com/nahidalam/modnet_docker) for a containerized version of MODNet with the Docker environment (provided by [@nahidalam](https://github.com/nahidalam)).\n\n\nThere are some resources about MODNet from the community.\n- [Video from What's AI YouTube Channel](https://youtu.be/rUo0wuVyefU)\n- [Article from Louis Bouchard's Blog](https://www.louisbouchard.ai/remove-background/)\n\n\n## Code\nWe provide the [code](src/trainer.py) of MODNet training iteration, including:\n- **Supervised Training**: Train MODNet on a labeled matting dataset\n- **SOC Adaptation**: Adapt a trained MODNet to an unlabeled dataset\n\nIn code comments, we provide examples for using the functions.  \n\n\n## PPM Benchmark\nThe PPM benchmark is released in a separate repository [PPM](https://github.com/ZHKKKe/PPM).  \n\n\n## License\nThe code, models, and demos in this repository (excluding GIF files under the folder `doc/gif`) are released under the [Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) license.  \n\n\n## Acknowledgement  \n- We thank  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[@yzhou0919](https://github.com/yzhou0919), [@eyaler](https://github.com/eyaler), [@manthan3C273](https://github.com/manthan3C273),  [@yarkable](https://github.com/yarkable), [@jkjung-avt](https://github.com/jkjung-avt),  [@manzke](https://github.com/manzke),  [@nahidalam](https://github.com/nahidalam),  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[the Gradio team](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio), [What's AI YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUzGQrN-lyyc0BWTYoJM_Sg), [Louis Bouchard's Blog](https://www.louisbouchard.ai),  \nfor their contributions to this repository or their cool applications/extentions/resources of MODNet.\n\n\n## Citation\nIf this work helps your research, please consider to cite:\n\n```bibtex\n@InProceedings{MODNet,\n  author = {Zhanghan Ke and Jiayu Sun and Kaican Li and Qiong Yan and Rynson W.H.
