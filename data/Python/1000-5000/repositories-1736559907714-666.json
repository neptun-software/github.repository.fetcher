          "content": "# Changelog\n\nAll notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.\n\nThe format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and\nthis project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).\n\n## [Unreleased]\n\n## [v3.0.0] - 2024-11-xx\n\n### Added\n\n- Platform: Added support for Python 3.10 - Python 3.13\n- Platform: Verified support for macOS and Windows\n- CLI: `responder run` now also accepts a filesystem path on its `<target>`\n  argument, enabling usage on single-file applications. Beforehand, only\n  invocations of Python modules were possible.\n  ```shell\n  # Start Responder application defined in Python module.\n  responder run acme.app:api\n\n  # Start Responder application defined in a single Python file.\n  responder run examples/helloworld.py:api\n  ```\n\n### Changed\n\n- Core: Updated API requests from GET to POST\n- Extensions: All of CLI-, GraphQL-, and OpenAPI-Support\n  modules are extensions to Responder now, to be found within the\n  `responder.ext` module namespace. Their runtime dependencies\n  must be installed explicitly using Python package extras.\n  ```shell\n  pip install 'responder[cli]'\n  pip install 'responder[graphql]'\n  pip install 'responder[openapi]'\n  ```\n- Extensions: They are no longer available through the package's\n  top-level module namespace. From now on, import them explicitly\n  from `responder.ext`.\n  ```python\n  from responder.ext.cli import cli\n  from responder.ext.graphql import GraphQLView\n  from responder.ext.openapi import OpenAPISchema\n  ```\n- Dependencies: Modernized and trimmed list of runtime dependencies\n- Dependencies: Switched from WhiteNoise to ServeStatic\n- Sandbox: Modernized development sandbox installation and documentation\n\n### Removed\n\n- CLI: `responder run --build` ceased to exist, because `responder build`\n  now also accepts an optional `<target>` argument, that overlaps with\n  the `<target>` argument of `responder run`, but is semantically different,\n  as the former accepts a filesystem directory to the `package.json` file,\n  but the latter expects a Python entrypoint specification.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Routing: Fixed dispatching `static_route=None` on Windows\n- uvicorn: Recent `uvicorn.run()` method lacks the `debug` argument. Now,\n  using `--debug` will map to uvicorn's `log_level = \"debug\"`.\n- GraphQL: Improved dependency pinning to match Responder's needs\n\n## [v2.0.5] - 2019-12-15\n\n### Added\n\n- Update requirements to support python 3.8\n\n## [v2.0.4] -

That `async` declaration is optional.\n[View documentation](https://responder.readthedocs.io).\n\nThis gets you a ASGI app, with a production static files server pre-installed, Jinja\ntemplating (without additional imports), and a production webserver based on uvloop,\nserving up requests with gzip compression automatically.\n\n## Testimonials\n\n> \"Pleasantly very taken with python-responder.\n> [@kennethreitz](https://x.com/kennethreitz42) at his absolute best.\" —Rudraksh\n> M.K.\n\n> \"ASGI is going to enable all sorts of new high-performance web services. It's awesome\n> to see Responder starting to take advantage of that.\" — Tom Christie author of\n> [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/)\n\n> \"I love that you are exploring new patterns. Go go go!\" — Danny Greenfield, author of\n> [Two Scoops of Django](https://www.feldroy.com/two-scoops-press#two-scoops-of-django)\n\n## More Examples\n\nSee\n[the documentation's feature tour](https://responder.readthedocs.io/tour.html)\nfor more details on features available in Responder.\n\n# Installing Responder\n\nInstall the most recent stable release:\n\n    pip install --upgrade 'responder'\n\nInclude support for all extensions and interfaces:\n\n    pip install --upgrade 'responder[full]'\n\nIndividual optional installation extras are:\n\n- graphql: Adds GraphQL support via Graphene\n- openapi: Adds OpenAPI/Swagger interface support\n\nOr, install directly from the repository:\n\n    pip install 'responder[full] @ git+https://github.com/kennethreitz/responder.git'\n\nResponder supports **Python 3.6+**.\n\n# The Basic Idea\n\nThe primary concept here is to bring the niceties that are brought forth from both Flask\nand Falcon and unify them into a single framework, along with some new ideas I have. I\nalso wanted to take some of the API primitives that are instilled in the Requests\nlibrary and put them into a web framework. So, you'll find a lot of parallels here with\nRequests.\n\n- Setting `resp.content` sends back bytes.\n- Setting `resp.text` sends back unicode, while setting `resp.html` sends back HTML.\n- Setting `resp.media` sends back JSON/YAML (`.text`/`.html`/`.content` override this).\n- Case-insensitive `req.headers` dict (from Requests directly).\n- `resp.status_code`, `req.method`, `req.url`, and other familiar friends.\n\n## Ideas\n\n- Flask-style route expression, with new capabilities -- all while using Python 3.6+'s\n  new f-string syntax.\n- I love Falcon's \"every request and response is passed into to each view and mutated\"\n  methodology, especially `response.media`, and have used it here. In addition to\n  supporting JSON, I have decided to support YAML as well, as Kubernetes is slowly\n  taking over the world, and it uses YAML for all the things. Content-negotiation and\n  all that.\n- **A built in testing client that uses the actual Requests you know and love**.\n- The ability to mount other WSGI apps easily.\n- Automatic gzipped-responses.\n- In addition to Falcon's `on_get`, `on_post`, etc methods, Responder features an\n  `on_request` method, which gets called on every type of request, much like Requests.\n- A production static file server is built-in.\n- Uvicorn built-in as a production web server. I would have chosen Gunicorn, but it\n  doesn't run on Windows. Plus, Uvicorn serves well to protect against slowloris\n  attacks, making nginx unnecessary in production.\n- GraphQL support, via Graphene. The goal here is to have any GraphQL query exposable at\n  any route, magically.\n- Provide an official way to run webpack.\n\n## Development\n\nSee [Development Sandbox](https://responder.kennethreitz.org/sandbox.html).\n"
