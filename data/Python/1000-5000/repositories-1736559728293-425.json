This will avoid unnecessary work and surely give you and\n  us a good deal of inspiration.\n\n* Before your contributions can be landed, they must be signed off under the\n  [Developer Certificate of Origin] which asserts you own and have the right to\n  submit the change under the open source licence used by the project.\n\n## Testing\n\nSubmitted changes should pass the current tests, and be covered by new test\ncases when adding functionality.\n\n* Run the tests locally using [tox] which executes the full suite on all\n  supported Python versions installed.\n\n* Each pull request is gated using [Travis CI] with the results linked on the\n  github page. This must pass before the change can land, note pushing a new\n  change will trigger a retest.\n\n## Style\n\n* Code style should follow [PEP 8] generally, and can be checked by running:\n  ``tox -e flake8``.\n\n* Import statements can be automatically formatted using [isort].\n\n\n[our mailing list]: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/prometheus-developers\n[Developer Certificate of Origin]: https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/wiki/DCO-signing\n[isort]: https://pypi.org/project/isort/\n[PEP 8]: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/\n[tox]: https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n[Travis CI]: https://docs.travis-ci.com/\n"
