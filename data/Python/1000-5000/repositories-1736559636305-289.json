Submissions due Jun 5. Don't miss out! 🤩 \n- [02/22/2023] Improved consistency using DDIM inversion.\n- [02/08/2023] [Colab demo](https://colab.research.google.com/github/showlab/Tune-A-Video/blob/main/notebooks/Tune-A-Video.ipynb) released!\n- [02/03/2023] Pre-trained Tune-A-Video models are available on [Hugging Face Library](https://huggingface.co/Tune-A-Video-library)!\n- [01/28/2023] New Feature: tune a video on personalized [DreamBooth](https://dreambooth.github.io/) models.\n- [01/28/2023] Code released!\n\n## Setup\n\n### Requirements\n\n```shell\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nInstalling [xformers](https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers) is highly recommended for more efficiency and speed on GPUs. \nTo enable xformers, set `enable_xformers_memory_efficient_attention=True` (default).\n\n### Weights\n\n**[Stable Diffusion]** [Stable Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752) is a latent text-to-image diffusion model capable of generating photo-realistic images given any text input. The pre-trained Stable Diffusion models can be downloaded from Hugging Face (e.g., [Stable Diffusion v1-4](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4), [v2-1](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1)). You can also use fine-tuned Stable Diffusion models trained on different styles (e.g, [Modern Disney](https://huggingface.co/nitrosocke/mo-di-diffusion), [Anything V4.0](https://huggingface.co/andite/anything-v4.0), [Redshift](https://huggingface.co/nitrosocke/redshift-diffusion), etc.).\n\n**[DreamBooth]** [DreamBooth](https://dreambooth.github.io/) is a method to personalize text-to-image models like Stable Diffusion given just a few images (3~5 images) of a subject. Tuning a video on DreamBooth models allows personalized text-to-video generation of a specific subject. There are some public DreamBooth models available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/sd-dreambooth-library) (e.g., [mr-potato-head](https://huggingface.co/sd-dreambooth-library/mr-potato-head)). You can also train your own DreamBooth model following [this training example](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples/dreambooth). \n\n\n## Usage\n\n### Training\n\nTo fine-tune the text-to-image diffusion models for text-to-video generation, run this command:\n\n```bash\naccelerate launch train_tuneavideo.py --config=\"configs/man-skiing.yaml\"\n```\n\nNote: Tuning a 24-frame video usually takes `300~500` steps, about `10~15` minutes using one A100 GPU. \nReduce `n_sample_frames` if your GPU memory is limited.\n\n### Inference\n\nOnce the training is done, run inference:\n\n```python\nfrom tuneavideo.pipelines.pipeline_tuneavideo import TuneAVideoPipeline\nfrom tuneavideo.models.unet import UNet3DConditionModel\nfrom tuneavideo.util import save_videos_grid\nimport torch\n\npretrained_model_path = \"./checkpoints/stable-diffusion-v1-4\"\nmy_model_path = \"./outputs/man-skiing\"\nunet = UNet3DConditionModel.from_pretrained(my_model_path, subfolder='unet', torch_dtype=torch.float16).to('cuda')\npipe = TuneAVideoPipeline.from_pretrained(pretrained_model_path, unet=unet, torch_dtype=torch.float16).to(\"cuda\")\npipe.enable_xformers_memory_efficient_attention()\npipe.enable_vae_slicing()\n\nprompt = \"spider man is skiing\"\nddim_inv_latent = torch.load(f\"{my_model_path}/inv_latents/ddim_latent-500.pt\").to(torch.float16)\nvideo = pipe(prompt, latents=ddim_inv_latent, video_length=24, height=512, width=512, num_inference_steps=50, guidance_scale=12.5).videos\n\nsave_videos_grid(video, f\"./{prompt}.gif\")\n```\n\n## Results\n\n### Pretrained T2I (Stable Diffusion)\n<table class=\"center\">\n<tr>\n  <td
