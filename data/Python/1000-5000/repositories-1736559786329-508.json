          "content": "# Yahoo Open Source Code of Conduct\n\n## Summary\nThis Code of Conduct is our way to encourage good behavior and discourage bad behavior in our open source projects. We invite participation from many people to bring different perspectives to our projects. We will do our part to foster a welcoming and professional environment free of harassment. We expect participants to communicate professionally and thoughtfully during their involvement with this project. \n\nParticipants may lose their good standing by engaging in misconduct. For example: insulting, threatening, or conveying unwelcome sexual content. We ask participants who observe conduct issues to report the incident directly to the project's Response Team at opensource-conduct@yahooinc.com. Yahoo will assign a respondent to address the issue. We may remove harassers from this project. \n\nThis code does not replace the terms of service or acceptable use policies of the websites used to support this project. We acknowledge that participants may be subject to additional conduct terms based on their employment which may govern their online expressions.\n\n## Details\nThis Code of Conduct makes our expectations of participants in this community explicit.\n* We forbid harassment and abusive speech within this community.\n* We request participants to report misconduct to the project’s Response Team.\n* We urge participants to refrain from using discussion forums to play out a fight.\n\n### Expected Behaviors\nWe expect participants in this community to conduct themselves professionally. Since our primary mode of communication is text on an online forum (e.g. issues, pull requests, comments, emails, or chats) devoid of vocal tone, gestures, or other context that is often vital to understanding, it is important that participants are attentive to their interaction style.\n\n* **Assume positive intent.** We ask community members to assume positive intent on the part of other people’s communications. We may disagree on details, but we expect all suggestions to be supportive of the community goals.\n* **Respect participants.** We expect occasional disagreements. Open Source projects are learning experiences. Ask, explore, challenge, and then _respectfully_ state if you agree or disagree. If your idea is rejected, be more persuasive not bitter.\n* **Welcoming to new members.** New members bring new perspectives. Some ask questions that have been addressed before. _Kindly_ point to existing discussions. Everyone is new to every project once.\n* **Be kind to beginners.** Beginners use open source projects to get experience. They might not be talented coders yet, and projects should not accept poor quality code. But we were all beginners once, and we need to engage kindly.\n* **Consider your impact on others.** Your work will be used by others, and you depend on the work of others. We expect community members to be considerate and establish a balance their self-interest with communal interest.\n* **Use words carefully.** We may not understand intent when you say something ironic. Often, people will misinterpret sarcasm in online communications. We ask community members to communicate plainly.\n* **Leave with class.** When you wish to resign from participating in this project for any reason, you are free to fork the code and create a competitive project. Open Source explicitly allows this. Your exit should not be dramatic or bitter. \n\n### Unacceptable Behaviors\nParticipants remain in good standing when they do not engage in misconduct or harassment (some examples follow). We do not list all forms of harassment, nor imply some forms of harassment are not worthy of action. Any participant who *feels* harassed or *observes* harassment, should report the incident to the Response Team. \n* **Don't be a bigot.** Calling out project members by their identity or background in a negative or insulting manner. This includes, but is not limited to, slurs or insinuations related to protected or suspect classes e.g. race, color, citizenship, national origin, political belief, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, culture, ethnicity, genetic features, language, profession, national minority status, mental or physical ability.\n* **Don't insult.** Insulting remarks about a person’s lifestyle practices.\n* **Don't dox.** Revealing private information about other participants without explicit permission.\n* **Don't intimidate.** Threats of violence or intimidation of any project member.\n* **Don't creep.** Unwanted sexual attention or content unsuited for the subject of this project.\n* **Don't inflame.** We ask that victim of harassment not address their grievances in the public forum, as this often intensifies the problem. Report it, and let us address it off-line.\n* **Don't disrupt.** Sustained disruptions in a discussion.\n\n### Reporting Issues\nIf you experience or witness misconduct, or have any other concerns about the conduct of members of this project, please report it by contacting our Response Team at opensource-conduct@yahooinc.com who will handle your report with discretion. Your report should include:\n* Your preferred contact information. We cannot process anonymous reports.\n* Names (real or usernames) of those involved in the incident.\n* Your account of what occurred, and if the incident is ongoing. Please provide links to or transcripts of the publicly available records (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public IRC logger), so that we can review it.\n* Any additional information that may be helpful to achieve resolution.\n\nAfter filing a report, a representative will contact you directly to review the incident and ask additional questions. If a member of the Yahoo Response Team is named in an incident report, that member will be recused from handling your incident. If the complaint originates from a member of the Response Team, it will be addressed by a different member of the Response Team. We will consider reports to be confidential for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. \n\n### Scope\nYahoo will assign a Response Team member with admin rights on the project and legal rights on the project copyright. The Response Team is empowered to restrict some privileges to the project as needed. Since this project is governed by an open source license, any participant may fork the code under the terms of the project license. The Response Team’s goal is to preserve the project if possible, and will restrict or remove participation from those who disrupt the project. \n\nThis code does not replace the terms of service or acceptable use policies that are provided by the websites used to support this community. Nor does this code apply to communications or actions that take place outside of the context of this community. Many participants in this project are also subject to codes of conduct based on their employment. This code is a social-contract that informs participants of our social expectations. It is not a terms of service or legal contract.\n\n## License and Acknowledgment. \nThis text is shared under the [CC-BY-4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

Its Spark-compatible API helps manage the TensorFlow\ncluster with the following steps:\n\n1. **Startup** - launches the Tensorflow main function on the executors, along with listeners for data/control messages.\n1. **Data ingestion**\n   - **InputMode.TENSORFLOW** - leverages TensorFlow's built-in APIs to read data files directly from HDFS.\n   - **InputMode.SPARK** - sends Spark RDD data to the TensorFlow nodes via a `TFNode.DataFeed` class.  Note that we leverage the [Hadoop Input/Output Format](https://github.com/tensorflow/ecosystem/tree/master/hadoop) to access TFRecords on HDFS.\n1. **Shutdown** - shuts down the Tensorflow workers and PS nodes on the executors.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Background](#background)\n- [Install](#install)\n- [Usage](#usage)\n- [API](#api)\n- [Contribute](#contribute)\n- [License](#license)\n\n## Background\n\nTensorFlowOnSpark was developed by Yahoo for large-scale distributed\ndeep learning on our Hadoop clusters in Yahoo's private cloud.\n\nTensorFlowOnSpark provides some important benefits (see [our\nblog](https://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/157196317141/))\nover alternative deep learning solutions.\n   * Easily migrate existing TensorFlow programs with <10 lines of code change.\n   * Support all TensorFlow functionalities: synchronous/asynchronous training, model/data parallelism, inferencing and TensorBoard.\n   * Server-to-server direct communication achieves faster learning when available.\n   * Allow datasets on HDFS and other sources pushed by Spark or pulled by TensorFlow.\n   * Easily integrate with your existing Spark data processing pipelines.\n   * Easily deployed on cloud or on-premise and on CPUs or GPUs.\n\n## Install\n\nTensorFlowOnSpark is provided as a pip package, which can be installed on single machines via:\n```\n# for tensorflow>=2.0.0\npip install tensorflowonspark\n\n# for tensorflow<2.0.0\npip install tensorflowonspark==1.4.4\n```\n\nFor distributed clusters, please see our [wiki site](../../wiki) for detailed documentation for specific environments, such as our getting started guides for [single-node Spark Standalone](https://github.com/yahoo/TensorFlowOnSpark/wiki/GetStarted_Standalone), [YARN clusters](../../wiki/GetStarted_YARN) and [AWS EC2](../../wiki/GetStarted_EC2).  Note: the Windows operating system is not currently supported due to [this issue](https://github.com/yahoo/TensorFlowOnSpark/issues/36).\n\n## Usage\n\nTo use TensorFlowOnSpark with an existing TensorFlow application, you can follow our [Conversion Guide](../../wiki/Conversion-Guide) to describe the required changes.  Additionally, our [wiki site](../../wiki) has pointers to some presentations which provide an overview of the platform.\n\n**Note: since TensorFlow 2.x breaks API compatibility with TensorFlow 1.x, the examples have been updated accordingly.  If you are using TensorFlow 1.x, you will need to checkout the `v1.4.4` tag for compatible examples and instructions.**\n\n## API\n\n[API Documentation](https://yahoo.github.io/TensorFlowOnSpark/) is automatically generated from the code.\n\n## Contribute\n\nPlease join the [TensorFlowOnSpark user group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/TensorFlowOnSpark-users) for discussions and questions.  If you have a question, please review our [FAQ](../../wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions) before posting.\n\nContributions are always welcome.
