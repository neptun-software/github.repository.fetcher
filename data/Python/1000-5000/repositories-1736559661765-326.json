          "content": "# 👉 How to contribute to Giskard?\n\nEveryone is encouraged to contribute, and we appreciate each and every one of them. Helping the community is thus not limited to writing code. The community will greatly benefit from your efforts to provide clarification, assist others, and enhance the documentation. 📗\n\nAdditionally, it is helpful if you help us spread the word by mentioning the library in blog articles about the amazing projects it enabled, tweeting about it on occasion, or just starring the repository! ⭐️\n\nIf you choose to contribute, please be mindful to respect our [code of conduct](https://github.com/Giskard-AI/giskard/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n## The different ways you can contribute to Giskard!\n\nThere are 5 ways you can contribute to Giskard:\n* Submitting issues related to bugs or desired new features.\n* Contributing to the examples or to the documentation;\n* Fixing outstanding issues with the existing code;\n* Implementing new ML tests (performance tests, drifts, metamorphic, etc.);\n* Implementing new features to Giskard\n\n### Did you find a bug? \n\nFirst, we would really appreciate it if you could **make sure the bug was not\nalready reported** (use the search bar on Github under Issues).\n\nIf you did not find it, please follow these steps to inform us:\n\n* Include your **OS type and version**, the versions of **Python**, and different Python libraries you used;\n* A short, self-contained, code snippet that allows us to reproduce the bug in less than 30s;\n* Provide the *full* stack trace if an exception is raised.\n\nTo get the logs of a given container, you can run\n\n```bash\ndocker logs <NAME OF THE CONTAINER>\n```\n\n### Do you want to implement a new ML test?\n\nCustom and domain-based tests are welcome. If you have an idea, you can inform us by providing us a short description of the test and possibly a link to its documentation (paper, etc.).\n\nIf you are willing to contribute the model yourself, let us know so we can best guide you.\n\n### Do you want a new feature (that is not a test)?\n\nAn awesome feature request addresses the following points:\n\n1. Motivation first: Is it related to a problem/frustration with the library? Is it related to something you would need for a project? Is it something you worked on and think could benefit the community?\n2. Write a *full paragraph* describing the feature;\n3. Attach any additional information (drawings, screenshots, etc.) you think may help.\n\n## Style guide\n\nWe use `black` to format the code and `isort` to sort the imports. You can automatically enforce this style using the\npre-commit hooks. You can find the instructions to install the pre-commit\nhooks [here](https://docs.giskard.ai/en/stable/community/contribution_guidelines/dev-environment.html).\n\nFor documentation strings, Giskard follows the [numpydoc](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#docstring-standard) style.\n\n**This guide was heavily inspired by the awesome [HuggingFace guide to contributing](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).**\n"

Make sure the Issue Template is filled out.\n    3.  The issue should be related to the repo it is created in.\n\n**Here's why we have this policy:** We want to focus on the work that benefits\nthe whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features. Individual support\nshould be sought on our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/ABvfpbu69R) community. It helps us to\naddress bugs and feature requests in a timely manner."

The library covers LLM-based applications such as RAG agents, all the way to traditional ML models for tabular data. \n\n## Scan: Automatically assess your LLM-based agents for performance, bias & security issues ⤵️\n\nIssues detected include: \n- Hallucinations\n- Harmful content generation\n- Prompt injection\n- Robustness issues\n- Sensitive information disclosure\n- Stereotypes & discrimination\n- many more...\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/giskard-ai/giskard/main/readme/scan_updates.gif\" alt=\"Scan Example\" width=\"800\">\n</p>\n\n## RAG Evaluation Toolkit (RAGET): Automatically generate evaluation datasets & evaluate RAG application answers ⤵️\n\nIf you're testing a RAG application, you can get an even more in-depth assessment using **RAGET**, Giskard's RAG Evaluation Toolkit.\n\n- **RAGET** can generate automatically a list of `question`, `reference_answer` and `reference_context` from the knowledge base of the RAG. You can then use this generated test set to evaluate your RAG agent.\n- **RAGET** computes scores *for each component of the RAG agent*. The scores are computed by aggregating the correctness of the agent’s answers on different question types.\n\n  - Here is the list of components evaluated with **RAGET**:\n    - `Generator`: the LLM used inside the RAG to generate the answers\n    - `Retriever`: fetch relevant documents from the knowledge base according to a user query\n    - `Rewriter`: rewrite the user query to make it more relevant to the knowledge base or to account for chat history\n    - `Router`: filter the query of the user based on his intentions\n    - `Knowledge Base`: the set of documents given to the RAG to generate the answers\n  \n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/giskard-ai/giskard/main/readme/RAGET_updated.gif\" alt=\"Test Suite Example\" width=\"800\">\n</p>\n\n\nGiskard works with any model, in any environment and integrates seamlessly with your favorite tools ⤵️ <br/>\n \n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img width='600' src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/giskard-ai/giskard/main/readme/tools_updated.png\">\n</p>\n<br/>\n\nLooking for solutions to evaluate computer vision models?

Be polite and helpful.\n\nContext:\n{context}\n\nQuestion:\n{question}\n\nYour answer:\n\"\"\"\n\nllm = OpenAI(model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct\", temperature=0)\nprompt = PromptTemplate(template=PROMPT_TEMPLATE, input_variables=[\"question\", \"context\"])\nclimate_qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_llm(llm=llm, retriever=db.as_retriever(), prompt=prompt)\n```\n\n<h2 id=\"scan-your-model-for-issues\">2. 🔎 Scan your model for issues</h2>\n\nNext, wrap your agent to prepare it for Giskard's scan:\n\n```python\nimport giskard\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef model_predict(df: pd.DataFrame):\n    \"\"\"Wraps the LLM call in a simple Python function.\n\n    The function takes a pandas.DataFrame containing the input variables needed\n    by your model, and must return a list of the outputs (one for each row).\n    \"\"\"\n    return [climate_qa_chain.run({\"query\": question}) for question in df[\"question\"]]\n\n# Don’t forget to fill the `name` and `description`: they are used by Giskard\n# to generate domain-specific tests.\ngiskard_model = giskard.Model(\n    model=model_predict,\n    model_type=\"text_generation\",\n    name=\"Climate Change Question Answering\",\n    description=\"This model answers any question about climate change based on IPCC reports\",\n    feature_names=[\"question\"],\n)\n```\n\n✨✨✨Then run Giskard's magical scan✨✨✨\n```python\nscan_results = giskard.scan(giskard_model)\n```\nOnce the scan completes, you can display the results directly in your notebook:\n\n```python\ndisplay(scan_results)\n\n# Or save it to a file\nscan_results.to_html(\"scan_results.html\")\n```\n\n*If you're facing issues, check out our [docs](https://docs.giskard.ai/en/stable/open_source/scan/scan_llm/index.html) for more information.*\n\n<h2 id=\"automatically-generate-an-evaluation-dataset-for-your-rag-applications\">3. 🪄 Automatically generate an evaluation dataset for your RAG applications</h2>\n\nIf the scan found issues in your model, you can automatically extract an evaluation dataset based on the issues found:\n\n```python\ntest_suite = scan_results.generate_test_suite(\"My first test suite\")\n```\n\nBy default, RAGET automatically generates 6 different question types (these can be selected if needed, see advanced question generation). The total number of questions is divided equally between each question type. To make the question generation more relevant and accurate, you can also provide a description of your agent.\n\n```python\n\nfrom giskard.rag import generate_testset, KnowledgeBase\n\n# Load your data and initialize the KnowledgeBase\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"path/to/your/knowledge_base.csv\")\n\nknowledge_base = KnowledgeBase.from_pandas(df, columns=[\"column_1\", \"column_2\"])\n\n# Generate a testset with 10 questions & answers for each question types (this will take a while)\ntestset = generate_testset(\n    knowledge_base, \n    num_questions=60,\n    language='en',  # optional, we'll auto detect if not provided\n    agent_description=\"A customer support chatbot for company X\", # helps generating better questions\n)\n```\n\nDepending on how many questions you generate, this can take a while. Once you’re done, you can save this generated test set for future use:\n\n```python\n# Save the generated testset\ntestset.save(\"my_testset.jsonl\")\n```\nYou can easily load it back\n\n```python\nfrom giskard.rag import QATestset\n\nloaded_testset = QATestset.load(\"my_testset.jsonl\")\n\n# Convert it to a pandas dataframe\ndf = loaded_testset.to_pandas()\n```\n\nHere’s an example of a generated question:\n\n| question                               | reference_context                                                                                                                                                     | reference_answer                                             | metadata                                               |\n|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| For which countries can I track my shipping? | Document 1: We offer free shipping on all orders over $50.
