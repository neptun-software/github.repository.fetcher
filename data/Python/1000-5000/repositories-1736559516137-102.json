          "content": "# AWS CloudFormation Sample Templates\n\nThis repository contains sample CloudFormation templates that you can use\nto help you get started on new infrastructure projects. Keep in mind that these \ntemplates are not meant to be production-ready \"QuickStarts\". You should \ntake the time to learn how they work, adapt them to your needs, and make sure\nthat they meet your company's compliance standards.\n\nEach template in this repository passes\n[CloudFormation Linter](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cfn-lint)\n(cfn-lint) checks, and also a basic set of\n[CloudFormation Guard](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cloudformation-guard)\n rules based on the CIS Top 20, with exceptions for some rules where it\nmade sense to keep the sample focused on a single use case.\n\n## Discord\n\nJoin us on Discord to discuss rain and all things CloudFormation! Connect and\ninteract with CloudFormation developers and experts, find channels to discuss\nrain, the CloudFormation registry, StackSets, cfn-lint, Guard and more:\n\n[![Join our Discord](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/981586120448020580/widget.png?style=banner3)](https://discord.gg/9zpd7TTRwq)\n\n## Submitting Templates\n\nBefore you submit a template, we suggest that you follow these guidelines:\n\n- Fork the repository and create a fresh branch to work on your sample\n  ```\n  git remote add upstream git@github.com:aws-cloudformation/aws-cloudformation-templates.git\n  git fetch upstream\n  git checkout -b my-branch-name upstream/main\n  git push -u origin\n  ```\n- Write the template in YAML, with a `.yaml` suffix (not `.yml` or\n  `.template`). Our test scripts will auto-generate a JSON file based on the\n  YAML. YAML is the source of truth for all templates in this repository.\n- If your solution needs any other type of YAML file, like a K8s manifest \n  or a build spec, give it a `.yml` extension. This will cause it to be skipped\n  by the test scripts.\n- Test your template. Can you successfully create a stack with it?  When you\n  delete a stack, is the stack (and all of its resources) successfully deleted?\n  Make sure users aren't left with stray resources or stacks that have deletion\n  errors.\n- In the Description section, add a brief description of your template. The\n  description should indicate what the template does and why it's useful. For\n  example:\n  ```\n  Description: \"Create a LAMP stack using a single EC2 instance and\n  a local MySQL database for storage. This template demonstrates using the AWS\n  CloudFormation bootstrap scripts to install the packages and files necessary\n  to deploy the Apache web server, PHP, and MySQL when the instance is\n  launched.\"\n  ```\n- Format your template to make it human readable:\n  - Err on the side of human readability. If it makes your template easier to\n    read, do it.\n  - Use cfn-lint to lint your template and make sure it is valid.\n  - Consider using two-space indents to reduce line wrapping.\n- Review IAM resources. If you include IAM resources, follow the standard\n  security advice of granting least privilege (granting only the permissions\n  required to do a task).\n- Remove secrets/credentials from your template. You might hardcode credentials\n  or secrets in your template when you're testing. Don't forget to remove them\n  before submitting your template. You can use this tool to help you scrub\n  secrets:\n  [https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets](https://github.com/awslabs/git-secrets).\n- Add your template to the correct folder so that others can discover it.\n- Run the `scripts/test-all.sh` script in the directory where you're working to \n  make sure the template is valid.\n- If you write any lambda function code, put it in a separate file and run\n  `pylint` or `eslint` to make sure the code is valid.\n\nWhen your template is ready, submit a pull request. A member of the AWS\norganization will review your request and might suggest changes. \n\n## Additional Resources\n\n### CloudFormation Linter (cfn-lint)\n\nThe [CloudFormation Linter](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cfn-lint) is\nan indispensable tool for developing your templates. It should be a part of\nevery developer's workflow, and incorporated into your CI/CD pipelines.\n\nInstall cfn-lint with pip:\n\n```sh\npip install cfn-lint\n```\n\n### CLoudFormation Rain\n\n[Rain](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/rain) is a command line interface\n(CLI) for CloudFormation that greatly improves the experience for authoring and\ndeploying templates. It has many features, such as creating starter templates\nfor various use cases, interactive deployments, modules, and more.\n\nRain can be installed with Brew:\n\n```sh\nbrew install rain\n```\n\nor if you are a Go user, you can install it like this:\n\n```sh\ngo install github.com/aws-cloudformation/rain/cmd/rain@latest\n```\n\n\nIn the *AWS CloudFormation User Guide*, you can view more information about the\nfollowing topics:\n\n- Learn how to use templates to create AWS CloudFormation stacks using the\n  [AWS Management Console](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-create-stack.html)\n  or\n  [AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-cli-creating-stack.html).\n- To view all the supported AWS resources and their properties, see the\n  [Template Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-reference.html).\n"
