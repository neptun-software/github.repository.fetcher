It **can not be used post or upload** content to TikTok on the behalf of a user. It has **no support any user-authenticated routes**, if you can't access it while being logged out on their website you can't access it here.\n\n## Sponsors\n\nThese sponsors have paid to be placed here and beyond that I do not have any affiliation with them, the TikTokAPI package will always be free and open-source.

The codebase can and does run into similar issues as it has before, because TikTok changes things up.\n\n```sh\npip install TikTokApi\npython -m playwright install\n```\n\nIf you would prefer a video walk through of setting up this package [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uCt1x8kINQ) just for that. (is a version out of date, installation is the same though)\n\nIf you want a quick video to listen for [TikTok Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=307ijmA3_lc) events in python.\n\n#### Docker Installation\n\nClone this repository onto a local machine (or just the Dockerfile since it installs TikTokApi from pip) then run the following commands.\n\n```sh\ndocker pull mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:focal\ndocker build . -t tiktokapi:latest\ndocker run -v TikTokApi --rm tiktokapi:latest python3 your_script.py\n```\n\n**Note** this assumes your script is named your_script.py and lives in the root of this directory.\n\n### Common Issues\n\nPlease don't open an issue if you're experiencing one of these just comment if the provided solution do not work for you.\n\n- **Browser Has no Attribute** - make sure you ran `python3 -m playwright install`, if your error persists try the [playwright-python](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-python) quickstart guide and diagnose issues from there.\n\n- **API methods returning Coroutine** - many of the API's methods are async so make sure your program awaits them for proper functionality\n\n## Quick Start Guide\n\nHere's a quick bit of code to get the most recent trending videos on TikTok. There's more examples in the [examples](https://github.com/davidteather/TikTok-Api/tree/main/examples) directory.\n\n**Note:** If you want to learn how to web scrape websites check my [free and open-source course for web scraping](https://github.com/davidteather/web-scraping-with-reverse-engineering)\n\n```py\nfrom TikTokApi import TikTokApi\nimport asyncio\nimport os\n\nms_token = os.environ.get(\"ms_token\", None) # get your own ms_token from your cookies on tiktok.com\n\nasync def trending_videos():\n    async with TikTokApi() as api:\n        await api.create_sessions(ms_tokens=[ms_token], num_sessions=1, sleep_after=3)\n        async for video in api.trending.videos(count=30):\n            print(video)\n            print(video.as_dict)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    asyncio.run(trending_videos())\n```\n\nTo directly run the example scripts from the repository root, use the `-m` option on python.\n\n```sh\npython -m examples.trending_example\n```\n\nYou can access the full data dictionary the object was created from with `.as_dict`. On a video this may look like\n[this](https://gist.github.com/davidteather/7c30780bbc30772ba11ec9e0b909e99d). TikTok changes their structure from time to time so it's worth investigating the structure of the dictionary when you use this package.\n\n## Upgrading from V5 to V6\n\nAll changes will be noted on [V6.0.0](https://github.com/davidteather/TikTok-Api/releases/tag/V6.0.0) if you want more information.\n\n### Changes & Motivations\n\n- Maintainability\n  - Was getting difficult to maintain with how TikTok was directly detecting HTTP requests.\n  - Switched to using a pool of **async** playwright pages to make it more difficult to detect, and hopefully easier to maintain in the future\n- Async\n  - It's been asked for a lot, and now fully async needed especially since the package is using a pool of playwright instances\n- User Flexibility\n  - Added a lot of function argument options that should be much more explicit than what was done previously.\n  - Hopefully if something is broken there's a workaround without having to modify the package itself (although if you do notice an issue please open an issue or submit a PR)\n- Documentation\n  - Goes with user flexibility a little bit but switched over to sphinx documentation for more explicit content\n  - If you run into an issue or are confused please open a github issue or submit a PR to fix documentation, it's always welcome! ðŸ¤ \n\n### Upgrading Examples\n\nThe biggest change is that everything is now async. You can see above how you might want to call an async function in python as well as the examples directory for more examples.\n"
