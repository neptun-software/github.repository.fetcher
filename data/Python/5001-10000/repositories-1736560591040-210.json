          "content": "# Setting up a Development Environment\n\nWe'd love to have your contribution, but first you'll need to configure your local environment first. In this guide, we'll walk through:\n\n1. Configuring virtual environment\n2. Installing dependencies\n3. Installing Git hooks\n4. Installing pre-commit hooks\n5. Building the Mage Docker image\n6. Running dev!\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> _All commands below, without any notes, assume you are at the root of the repo._\n\nMage server uses Python >=3.6 (as per `setup.py`), but the development dependencies will complain if you're not using at least Python 3.8. We [use Python 3.10](./Dockerfile).\n\nAs such, make sure you have Python >=3.8. Verify this with:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-ai mage-ai\ncd mage-ai\npython --version\n```\n\nUsing a virtual environment is recommended.\n\n## Configuring a Virtual Env\n\n### Anaconda + Poetry\n\nCreate an Anaconda virtual environment with the correct version of python:\n```bash\nconda create -n python3.10 python==3.10\n```\n\nActivate that virtual environment (to get the right version of Python on your PATH):\n\n```bash\nconda activate python3.10\n```\n\nVerify that the correct Python version is being used:\n\n```bash\npython --version\n# or\nwhere python\n# or\nwhich python\n# or\nwhereis python\n```\n\nThen create a Poetry virtual environment using the same version of Python:\n\n```bash\npoetry env use $(which python)\n```\n\nInstall the dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nmake dev_env\n```\n\n### Virtualenv\n\nFirst, create a virtualenv environment in the root of the repo:\n\n```bash\npython -m venv .venv\n```\n\nThen activate it:\n\n```bash\nsource .venv/bin/activate\n```\n\nTo install dependencies:\n\n```bash\npip install -U pip\npip install -r ./requirements.txt\npip install toml mage-ai\n```\n\nInstall additional dev dependencies from `pyproject.toml`:\n\n```bash\npip install $(python -c \"import toml; print(' '.join(toml.load('pyproject.toml')['tool']['poetry']['group']['dev']['dependencies'].keys()))\" | tr '\\n' ' ')\n```\n\nThe above command uses the `toml` library to output the dev dependencies from the `pyproject.toml` as a space-delimited list, and passes that output to the `pip install` command. If you encounter the error: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'toml'`, try running the following command instead:\n\n```bash\npip install $(python3 -c \"import toml; print(' '.join(toml.load('pyproject.toml')['tool']['poetry']['group']['dev']['dependencies'].keys()))\" | tr '\\n' ' ')\n```\n\n## Mage frontend\n\nIf you'll only be contributing to backend code, this section may be omitted.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> _Even if you are only working on UIs, you would still have to have the server running at port `6789`._\n\nThe Mage frontend is a Next.js project\n\n```bash\ncd mage_ai/frontend/\n```\n\nthat uses Yarn.\n\n```bash\nyarn install && yarn dev\n```\n\n## Git Hooks\n\nInstall Git hooks by running the Make command:\n\n```bash\nmake install-hooks\n```\n\nThis will copy the git hooks from `.git-dev/hooks` into `.git/hooks`, and make them executable.\n\n## Pre-Commit\n\nInstall the pre-commit hooks:\n\n```bash\npre-commit install\n```\n\nNote that this will install both pre-commit and pre-push hooks.\n\n## Run development server\n\nTo initialize a development mage project so you have a starting point:\n\n```bash\n./scripts/init.sh default_repo\n```\n\nThen, to start the dev server for the backend at `localhost:6789` and frontend at `localhost:3000`:\n\n```bash\n./scripts/dev.sh default_repo\n```\n\nIn case you only want the backend:\n\n```bash\n./scripts/start.sh default_repo\n```\n\nThe name `default_repo` could technically be anything, but if you decide to change it, be sure to add it to the `.gitignore` file. You're now ready to contribute!\n\nSee this [video](https://youtu.be/mxKh2062sTc?si=5GW_mKF5jOpGEO3I) for further guidance and instructions.\n\nAny time you'd like to build, just run `./scripts/dev.sh default_repo` to run the development containers.\n\nAny changes you make, backend or frontend, will be reflected in the development instance.\n\nOur pre-commit & pre-push hooks will run when you make a commit/push to check style, etc.\n\nNow it's time to create a new branch, contribute code, and open a pull request!\n\n## Troubleshoot\n\nHere are some common problems our users have encountered. If other issues arise, please reach out to us in Slack!\n\n### Illegal instruction\n\nIf an `Illegal instruction` error is received, or Docker containers exit instantly with `code 132`, it means your machine is using an older architecture that does not support certain instructions called from the (Python) dependencies. Please either try again on another machine, or manually setup the server, start it in verbose mode to see which package caused the error, and look up for alternatives.\n\nList of builds:\n- `polars` -> [`polars-lts-cpu`](https://pypi.org/project/polars-lts-cpu/)\n\n### `pip install` fails on Windows\n\nSome Python packages assume a few core functionalities that are not available on Windows, so you need to install these prerequisites, see the fantastic (but archived) [pipwin](https://github.com/lepisma/pipwin) and [this issue](https://github.com/lepisma/pipwin/issues/64) for more options.\n\nPlease report any other build errors in our Slack.\n\n### ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'x'\n\nIf there were added new libraries you should manually handle new dependencies. It can be done in 2 ways:\n\n1. `docker-compose build` from project root will fully rebuild an image with new dependencies - it can take lots of time\n2. `pip install x` from inside the container will only install the required dependency - it should be much faster\n\n## Monaco Editor features\n\nIf you want to exclude a feature from the WebPack build,\nyou can do so by modifying the WebPack configuration:\n\n```js\nconfig.plugins.push(\n  new MonacoWebpackPlugin({\n    features: ['!anchorSelect'],\n  }),\n);\n```\n\n### Features\n\nGet list of features:\n\n```tsx\nimport metadata from 'monaco-editor/esm/metadata';\nconsole.log(metadata.features);\n```\n\n```\nanchorSelect\nbracketMatching\nbrowser\ncaretOperations\nclipboard\ncodeAction\ncodeEditor\ncodelens\ncolorPicker\ncomment\ncontextmenu\ncursorUndo\ndiffEditor\ndiffEditorBreadcrumbs\ndnd\ndocumentSymbols\ndropOrPasteInto\nfind\nfolding\nfontZoom\nformat\ngotoError\ngotoLine\ngotoSymbol\nhover\niPadShowKeyboard\ninPlaceReplace\nindentation\ninlayHints\ninlineCompletions\ninlineEdit\ninlineProgress\ninspectTokens\nlineSelection\nlinesOperations\nlinkedEditing\nlinks\nlongLinesHelper\nmulticursor\nparameterHints\nquickCommand\nquickHelp\nquickOutline\nreadOnlyMessage\nreferenceSearch\nrename\nsectionHeaders\nsemanticTokens\nsmartSelect\nsnippet\nstickyScroll\nsuggest\ntoggleHighContrast\ntoggleTabFocusMode\ntokenization\nunicodeHighlighter\nunusualLineTerminators\nwordHighlighter\nwordOperations\nwordPartOperations\n```\n"
