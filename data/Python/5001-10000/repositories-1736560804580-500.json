We appreciate your help in maintaining and expanding the table of job openings for new grads in various tech roles.\n\nI'll do my best to keep them sorted by **date posted** first and then **[A-Z]** by **company name**. If you see any mistakes or outdated information, please submit a pull request to update them. \n\n### Need Before You Contribute\n* **Company Name**\n* **Location**\n* **Roles** / **Links** to Job Posting\n\n### Adding A Job Opening / Updating A Job Opening\n\n1. **Fork the Repository**: Click the \"Fork\" button at the top-right corner of the repository to create your own copy of the repository.\n<br>\n\n2. **Clone the Forked Repository**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the following command:\n<br>\n\n3. **Add the Job Opening**: Add the job opening to the table in the `README.md` file. \nPlease follow the existing format of the table.\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Table Example</b> -- click here</summary> <br>\n\n- If you were **ADDING** a job opening for *Walmart*:\n\n| Company Name | Location | Roles | Citizenship/Visa Requirements | Date Added <br> mm/dd/yyyy |\n| ------------ | -------- | ----- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------- |\n| [Walmart](https://careers.walmart.com/) | - Bentonville, AR <br> - Sunnyvale, CA | ‚úÖ [New Grad Software Engineer II](https://careers.walmart.com/)| US Citizen, Permanent Resident, OPT, Sponsorship, etc. | 10/01/2023 |\n\n\nPlaceholders for the table are defined as follows:\n  - `Company Name`: Represents the name of the company.\n  - `Location`: Denotes the place(s) where the job position is available.\n    - When there are multiple locations, each location should be prefixed with a dash `-`, and a `<br>` tag should be inserted before each location, starting from the second location.\n    - Example: `- {location1} <br> - {location2}`\n  - `Roles`: Refers to any additional roles or links to the job posting.\n    - Including \"‚úÖ\" is optional, but if you want to maintain consistency with the rest of the repository, you can add it at the beginning of the role listing.\n  - `Citizenship/Visa Requirements`: Indicates the citizenship or visa requirements for the job opening.\n  - `Date Added`: Specifies the date when the job opening was added to the repository. The date should be in the format `mm/dd/yyyy`.\n    - This helps in keeping the most recent job openings at the top of the table.\n\n\n```java\n| [Company Name](link-to-job-posting) | Location (s)  | [Position Name](link-to-job-posting)| US Citizen, Permanent Resident, Sponsorship | mm/dd/yyyy |\n```\n\n<br>\n\n- If **UPDATING** a job opening, please follow the same format as above, but replace the link to the job posting with the new link, or add a new position name separated by a `<br>` tag.\n\n| Company Name | Location | Roles | Citizenship/Visa Requirements | Date Added <br> mm/dd/yyyy |\n| ------------ | -------- | ----- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------- |\n| [Walmart](https://careers.walmart.com/) | - Bentonville, AR <br> - Sunnyvale, CA | ‚úÖ [New Grad Software Engineer II](https://careers.walmart.com/) <br> ‚úÖ [New Grad Product Manager](https://careers.walmart.com/)| US Citizen, Permanent Resident, OPT, Sponsorship, etc. | 10/01/2023 |\n\n```java\n| [Company Name](link-to-job-posting) | Location (s)  | [Position Name](link-to-job-posting), [New Position Name 2](link-to-job-posting-2)| US Citizen, Permanent Resident. | mm/dd/yyyy |\n```\n\n\n</details> \n<br>\n\n4. **Run the script** [OPTIONAL]: Run the py script to ensure that the table is formatted correctly. You can do this by running the following command:\n\n    ```bash\n    python3 scripts/auto_organizer.py\n    ```\n\n    - If the script fail, please fix the errors before proceeding to the next step.\n\n5. **Commit the Changes**: Commit the changes to your forked repository using the following commands:\n\n    ```bash\n    git add .\n    git commit -m \"Add <Company Name> <Role>\"\n    ```\n\n    - The actual commit message can be anything you want, but it's best to keep it short and simple and related to the changes you made.\n\n6. **Create a Pull Request**:\n    * You can create a pull request from your forked repository to the original repository by clicking on the **\"Compare & pull request\"** button on your forked repository page.\n\n    **OR**\n\n    * You can also create a pull request from your forked repository to the original repository using the following commands:\n\n    ```bash\n    git push origin main\n    ```\n    Then, create a pull request from your forked repository to the original repository. Please ensure that the pull request and commit message adhere to the [contribution guidelines](#guidelines).\n\n    <br>\n\n7. **Review Pending / Done!** üéâ Thank you for your contribution! Your pull request will be reviewed and merged as soon as possible.\n\n> ‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE: No worries, worst case scenario, we can always edit your pull request and fix any issues together.\n\n### Removing A Job Opening\n\nThis section is for removing a job opening from the table in the `README.md` file.\n\nIt's very similar, assuming you have already forked the repository and cloned it to your local machine.\n\n1. **Find the Job Opening**: Find the job opening you want to remove from the table in the `README.md` file.\n\n2. **Close the Job Opening**: \n    - Simply add a `üîí` before the Roles or links to the job posting. (Be mindful of the space)\n    - Then remove the link to the job posting from both the company name and position name. *The parentheses should be empty*\n    - Finally, remove the citizenship/visa requirements and replace it with a dash `-`, unless the position has another role open.\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Table Example</b></summary><br>\n\n- This is what the *table* would look like if you were removing a job opening for *Walmart*:\n\n| Company Name | Location | Roles | Citizenship/Visa Requirements | Date Added <br> mm/dd/yyyy |\n| ------------ | -------- | ----- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------- |\n| [Walmart]() | - Bentonville, AR <br> - Sunnyvale, CA | üîí [New Grad Software Engineer II]()| - | 10/05/2023 |\n\nPlaceholders for the table are as follows:\n  - `Company Name`: The name of the company.\n  - `Location`: The location(s) of the job opening.\n  - `Roles`: Any additional Roles or links to the job posting.\n\n```java\n| [Company Name]() | - Location (s)  | üîí [Position Name]()| - | mm/dd/yyyy |\n```\n\n</details>\n\nIf the job opening has multiple roles, and you want to close one or more:\n1. Repeat the same steps as above, but only add `üîí` to the roles you want to close.\n- If you want to close all the roles, then add `üîí` to all the roles.\n- If you want to close some of the roles, then add `üîí` to the roles you want to close while separating them with a `<br>` tag.\n2. Move the closed job opening to the bottom of the company's list of job openings.\n3. Add `<br><br>` if it doesn't already exist between the open and closed job roles.\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Multiple Roles: Table Example</b></summary><br>\n\n- This is what the *table* would look like if you were removing a job opening for *Walmart*:\n\n| Company Name | Location | Roles | Citizenship/Visa Requirements | Date Added <br> mm/dd/yyyy |\n| ------------ | -------- | ----- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------- |\n| [Walmart](https://careers.walmart.com/) | - Bentonville, AR <br> - Sunnyvale, CA | ‚úÖ [New Grad Software Engineer II](https://careers.walmart.com/swe2) <br> ‚úÖ [New Grad Software Engineer III](https://careers.walmart.com/swe3) <br><br> üîí [New Grad Product Manager](https://careers.walmart.com/) <br> üîí [New Grad Quant Strat]() | US Citizen, Permanent Resident, OPT, Sponsorship, etc. | 10/01/2023 |\n\nPlaceholders for the table are as follows:\n  - `Company Name`: The name of the company.\n  - `Location`: The location(s) of the job opening.\n  - `Roles`: Any additional Roles or links to the job posting.\n\n```java\n| [Company Name](link-to-job-posting) | - Location (s)  | ‚úÖ [Position Name](link-to-job-posting) <br> ‚úÖ [Position Name 2] <br><br> üîí [Position Name 3]() <br> üîí [Position Name 4]()| US Citizen, Permanent Resident. | mm/dd/yyyy |\n```\n\n### Guidelines\n\n- Please ensure that the job listings you add are for New Grad positions in the fields of:\n    * **Software Engineering (SWE)** / **Software Development Engineer (SDE)**\n    * **Quant Roles**\n    * **Product Management (PM)** / **Product Manager (PM)**\n    * **Other tech roles.**\n- Make sure that the job openings are for the year 2024 and are located in the **United States**, **Remote**, or **Canada**.\n- Provide accurate and up-to-date information for each job listing.\n- Follow the existing format of the table in the `README.md` file.\n- Not already listed in the table or previously submitted in a pull request.\n\n\n### Thank You\n\nWe appreciate your contributions to the 2024 New Grad Full-time Positions repository! Your efforts help keep this resource valuable and up-to-date for new grads seeking job opportunities.\n\nGood luck with your job search, and thank you for being a part of our community! üåü\n"
