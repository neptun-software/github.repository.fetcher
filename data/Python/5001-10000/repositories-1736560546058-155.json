For this new release, the [main](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation/tree/main) branch serves as the primary branch, while the development branch is [dev-1.x](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation/tree/dev-1.x). The stable branch for the previous release remains as the [0.x](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation/tree/0.x) branch. Please note that the [master](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation/tree/master) branch will only be maintained for a limited time before being removed. We encourage you to be mindful of branch selection and updates during use. Thank you for your unwavering support and enthusiasm, and let's work together to make MMSegmentation even more robust and powerful! 💪\n\nMMSegmentation v1.x brings remarkable improvements over the 0.x release, offering a more flexible and feature-packed experience. To utilize the new features in v1.x, we kindly invite you to consult our detailed [📚 migration guide](https://mmsegmentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/migration/interface.html), which will help you seamlessly transition your projects. Your support is invaluable, and we eagerly await your feedback!\n\n![demo image](resources/seg_demo.gif)\n\n### Major features\n\n- **Unified Benchmark**\n\n  We provide a unified benchmark toolbox for various semantic segmentation methods.\n\n- **Modular Design**\n\n  We decompose the semantic segmentation framework into different components and one can easily construct a customized semantic segmentation framework by combining different modules.\n\n- **Support of multiple methods out of box**\n\n  The toolbox directly supports popular and contemporary semantic segmentation frameworks, *e.g.* PSPNet, DeepLabV3, PSANet, DeepLabV3+, etc.\n\n- **High efficiency**\n\n  The training speed is faster than or comparable to other codebases.\n\n## What's New\n\nv1.2.0 was released on 10/12/2023, from 1.1.0 to 1.2.0, we have added or updated the following features:\n\n### Highlights\n\n- Support for the open-vocabulary semantic segmentation algorithm [SAN](configs/san/README.md)\n\n- Support monocular depth estimation task, please refer to [VPD](configs/vpd/README.md) and [Adabins](projects/Adabins/README.md) for more details.\n\n  ![depth estimation](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation/assets/15952744/07afd0e9-8ace-4a00-aa1e-5bf0ca92dcbc)\n\n- Add new projects: open-vocabulary semantic segmentation algorithm [CAT-Seg](projects/CAT-Seg/README.md), real-time semantic segmentation algofithm [PP-MobileSeg](projects/pp_mobileseg/README.md)\n\n## Installation\n\nPlease refer to [get_started.md](docs/en/get_started.md#installation) for installation and [dataset_prepare.md](docs/en/user_guides/2_dataset_prepare.md#prepare-datasets) for dataset preparation.\n\n## Get Started\n\nPlease see [Overview](docs/en/overview.md) for the general introduction of MMSegmentation.\n\nPlease see [user guides](https://mmsegmentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guides/index.html#) for the basic usage of MMSegmentation.\nThere are also [advanced tutorials](https://mmsegmentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced_guides/index.html) for in-depth understanding of mmseg design and implementation .\n\nA Colab tutorial is also provided. You may preview the notebook [here](demo/MMSegmentation_Tutorial.ipynb) or directly [run](https://colab.research.google.com/github/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation/blob/main/demo/MMSegmentation_Tutorial.ipynb) on Colab.\n\nTo migrate from MMSegmentation 0.x, please refer to

简介\n\nMMSegmentation 是一个基于 PyTorch 的语义分割开源工具箱。它是 OpenMMLab 项目的一部分。\n\n[main](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation/tree/main) 分支代码目前支持 PyTorch 1.6 以上的版本。\n\n### 🎉 MMSegmentation v1.0.0 简介 🎉\n\n我们非常高兴地宣布 MMSegmentation 最新版本的正式发布！在这个新版本中，主要分支是 [main](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation/tree/main) 分支，开发分支是 [dev-1.x](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation/tree/dev-1.x)。而之前版本的稳定分支保留为 [0.x](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation/tree/0.x) 分支。请注意，[master](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation/tree/master) 分支将只在有限的时间内维护，然后将被删除。我们鼓励您在使用过程中注意分支选择和更新。感谢您一如既往的支持和热情，让我们共同努力，使 MMSegmentation 变得更加健壮和强大！💪\n\nMMSegmentation v1.x 在 0.x 版本的基础上有了显著的提升，提供了更加灵活和功能丰富的体验。为了更好使用 v1.x 中的新功能，我们诚挚邀请您查阅我们详细的 [📚 迁移指南](https://mmsegmentation.readthedocs.io/zh_CN/latest/migration/interface.html)，以帮助您无缝地过渡您的项目。您的支持对我们来说非常宝贵，我们热切期待您的反馈！\n\n![示例图片](resources/seg_demo.gif)\n\n### 主要特性\n\n- **统一的基准平台**\n\n  我们将各种各样的语义分割算法集成到了一个统一的工具箱，进行基准测试。\n\n- **模块化设计**\n\n  MMSegmentation 将分割框架解耦成不同的模块组件，通过组合不同的模块组件，用户可以便捷地构建自定义的分割模型。\n\n- **丰富的即插即用的算法和模型**\n\n  MMSegmentation 支持了众多主流的和最新的检测算法，例如 PSPNet，DeepLabV3，PSANet，DeepLabV3+ 等.\n\n- **速度快**\n\n  训练速度比其他语义分割代码库更快或者相当。\n\n## 更新日志\n\n最新版本 v1.2.0 在 2023.10.12 发布。\n如果想了解更多版本更新细节和历史信息，请阅读[更新日志](docs/en/notes/changelog.md)。\n\n## 安装\n\n请参考[快速入门文档](docs/zh_cn/get_started.md#installation)进行安装，参考[数据集准备](docs/zh_cn/user_guides/2_dataset_prepare.md)处理数据。\n\n## 快速入门\n\n请参考[概述](docs/zh_cn/overview.md)对 MMSegmetation 进行初步了解\n\n请参考[用户指南](https://mmsegmentation.readthedocs.io/zh_CN/latest/user_guides/index.html)了解 mmseg 的基本使用，以及[进阶指南](https://mmsegmentation.readthedocs.io/zh_CN/latest/advanced_guides/index.html)深入了解 mmseg 设计和代码实现。\n\n同时，我们提供了 Colab 教程。你可以在[这里](demo/MMSegmentation_Tutorial.ipynb)浏览教程，或者直接在 Colab 上[运行](https://colab.research.google.com/github/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation/blob/main/demo/MMSegmentation_Tutorial.ipynb)。\n\n若需要将 0.x 版本的代码迁移至新版，请参考[迁移文档](docs/zh_cn/migration)。\n\n## 教程文档\n\n<div
