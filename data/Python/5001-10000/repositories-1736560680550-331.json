Everyone is welcome to contribute.\n\nThe decision-making process and governance structure of BentoML project can be found in the governance document: [BentoML Governance Doc](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md).\n\nTo follow development updates and discussion, join the #bentoml-contributors channel in [BentoML Slack community](https://join.slack.bentoml.org).\n\n\n## Ways to contribute\n\nThere are many ways to contribute to BentoML.\n\n* Supporting new users by answering questions on the\n    [github issues tracker](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/issues) and the\n    [#bentoml-users slack channel](https://join.slack.bentoml.org).\n\n* Report issues you're facing and \"Thumbs up\" on issues and feature requests that are\n    relevant to you in BentoML's [issues tracker](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/issues).\n\n* Investigate bugs and reviewing other developer's pull requests.\n\n* Contributing code or documentation to the project by submitting a Github pull request.\n\n* Create new example projects and contribute it to the [Examples Overview page](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/latest/examples/overview.html).\n\n\n\n## Submitting a bug report or a feature request\n\nWe use Github issues to track all bugs and feature requests. Feel free to open an issue\nif you have found a bug or wish to see a new feature implemented.\n\nBefore submitting a github issue, ensure the bug was not already reported under\n[issues](https://github.com/bentoml/bentoml/issues) or currently being addressed by\nother [pull requests](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/pulls).\n\nIf you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem,\n[open a new one](https://github.com/bentoml/bentoml/issues/new). Be sure to\ninclude a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as\npossible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating\nthe expected behavior that is not occurring.\n\n\n## Contributing Code\n\nTo avoid duplicating work, it is highly recommended to search through the\n[issue tracker](https://github.com/bentoml/bentoml/issues) and\n[pull requests list](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/pulls). If in doubt about\nduplicated work, or if you want to work on a non-trivial feature, it's recommended to\nfirst open an issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/bentoml/bentoml/issues)\nto get some feedbacks from core developers.\n\nOne easy way to find an issue to work on is by applying the \"help wanted\" label in the\nissues list: [help wanted issues](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).\n\nFor detailed instructions on how to develop BentoML locally and submit a 'pull request',\nfollow the [development guide](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/blob/main/DEVELOPMENT.md).\n\nIf you are new to BentoML project and interested in contributing code, take a look at\nthe [Good first issues list](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).\nResolving these issues allow you to start contributing to the project without much\nprior knoledge and help you get familiar with its codebase.\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nImproving the documentation is no less important than improving the library. If you find\na typo in the documentation, or have made improvements, do not hesitate to submit a\nGitHub pull request.\n\nFull documentation can be found under the `docs/source` directory. You can edit the\ndocumentation `.rst` or `.md` files using any text editor. Follow the instructions\n[here](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/blob/main/DEVELOPMENT.md#how-to-edit-run-build-documentation-site)\nto build documentation site locally, generate HTML output and preview your changes.\n\n## Issue Tracker Tags\n\nIssue type tags:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| question | Any questions about the project |\n| bug | Something isn't working |\n| enhancement | Improving performance, usability, consistency |\n| docs | Documentation, tutorials, and example projects |\n| new feature | Feature requests or pull request implementing a new feature |\n| test | Improving unit test coverage, e2e test, CI or build |\n\nTags to help new contributors:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| help wanted | An issue currently lacks a contributor |\n| good first issue | Good for newcomers |\n\nTags for managing issues:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| duplicated | This issue or pull request already exists |\n| stale | Automatically applied when an issue went quiet for more than 60 days |\n| merge-hold | Requires further discussions before a pull request can be merged |\n\n\n## Testing and improving test coverage\n\nHigh quality testing is extremely important for BentoML project. Currently BentoML has\nthree kind of tests: Unit tests(`tests/`) and integrations (`tests/integration/`) are\nrunning on Travis CI for every pull request.  End-to-end tests(`e2e_tests/`) is manually\nexecuted by the maintainer before every release and for pull requests that are\nintroducing major changes.\n\nWe expect pull requests that are introducing new features to have at least 90% test\ncoverages. Pull requests that are fixing a bug should add a test covering the issue\nbeing fixed if possible.\n"

Configuration can be found [here](./src/bentoml/grpc/buf.yaml). Currently, we\nare running `buf` with docker, hence we kindly ask our developers to have docker\navailable. Docker installation can be found\n[here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).\n\nRun linter/format script:\n\n```bash\npre-commit run --all-files\n```\n\nRun type checker:\n\n```bash\nmake type\n```\n\n## Editing proto files\n\nThe proto files for the BentoML gRPC service are located under [`bentoml/grpc`](./bentoml/grpc/).\nThe generated python files are not checked in the git repository, and are instead generated via this [`script`](./scripts/generate_grpc_stubs.sh).\nIf you edit the proto files, make sure to run `./scripts/generate_grpc_stubs.sh` to\nregenerate the proto stubs.\n\n## Deploy with your changes\n\nTest out your changes in an actual BentoML model deployment, you can create a new Bento with your custom BentoML source repo:\n\n1. Install custom BentoML in editable mode. e.g.:\n   - git clone your bentoml fork\n   - `pip install -e PATH_TO_THE_FORK`\n2. Set env var `export BENTOML_BUNDLE_LOCAL_BUILD=True`\n3. Build a new Bento with `bentoml build` in your project directory\n4. The new Bento will include a wheel file built from the BentoML source, and\n   `bentoml containerize` will install it to override the default BentoML installation in base image\n\n### Distribute a custom BentoML release for your team\n\nIf you want other team members to easily use your custom BentoML distribution, you may publish your\nbranch to your fork of BentoML, and have your users install it this way:\n\n```bash\npip install git+https://github.com/{YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME}/bentoml@{YOUR_REVISION}\n```\n\nAnd in your BentoML projects' `bentofile.yaml`, force the Bento to install this distribution, e.g.:\n\n```yaml\nservice: 'service:svc'\ndescription: 'file: ./README.md'\ninclude:\n  - '*.py'\npython:\n  packages:\n    - pandas\n    - git+https://github.com/{YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME}/bentoml@{YOUR_REVISION}\ndocker:\n  system_packages:\n    - git\n```\n\n## Testing\n\nMake sure to install all dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\npdm install\n```\n\nBentoML tests come with a Pytest plugin. Export `PYTEST_PLUGINS`:\n\n```bash\nexport PYTEST_PLUGINS=bentoml.testing.pytest.plugin\n```\n\nTo run all tests with PDM, do the following:\n\n```bash\npdm run nox\n```\n\n### Adding new test suite\n\nIf you are adding new ML framework support, it is recommended that you also add a separate test suite in our CI. Currently we are using GitHub Actions to manage our CI/CD workflow.\n\nWe recommend using [`nektos/act`](https://github.com/nektos/act) to run and test Actions locally.\n\nAdd a new job for your new framework under [framework.yml](./.github/workflows/frameworks.yml)\n\n## Python tools ecosystem\n\nCurrently, BentoML is [PEP518](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/) compatible. We define package configuration via [`pyproject.toml`][https://github.com/bentoml/bentoml/blob/main/pyproject.toml].\n\n## Benchmark\n\nBentoML has moved its benchmark to [`bentoml/benchmark`](https://github.com/bentoml/benchmark).\n\n## Creating Pull Requests on GitHub\n\nPush changes to your fork and follow [this\narticle](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request)\non how to create a pull request on github. Name your pull request\nwith one of the following prefixes, e.g. \"feat: add support for\nPyTorch\". This is based on the [Conventional Commits\nspecification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary)\n\n- feat: (new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script)\n- fix: (bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script)\n- docs: (changes to the documentation)\n- style: (formatting, missing semicolons, etc; no production code change)\n- refactor: (refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable)\n- perf: (code changes that improve performance)\n- test: (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)\n- chore: (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)\n- build: (changes that affect the build system or external dependencies)\n- ci: (changes to configuration files and scripts)\n- revert: (reverts a previous commit)\n\nOnce your pull request is created, an automated test run will be triggered on\nyour branch and the BentoML authors will be notified to review your code\nchanges. Once tests are passed and a reviewer has signed off, we will merge\nyour pull request.\n\n## Documentations\n\nRefer to [BentoML Documentation Guide](./docs/README.md) for how to build and write\ndocs.\n"

BentoML is an open, community-driven project for\nmachine learning model serving.\n\nBentoML takes a meritocratic, consensus-based approach to its governance structure.\nAnyone with an interest in the project can join the community, contribute to the project\nand participate in the decision making process. And this is a living document aiming to\noutline how that participation takes place.\n\n* Contribution guidelines: https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\n* Code of Conduct: https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\n* Development guidelines: https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/blob/main/DEVELOPMENT.md\n* BentoML contributor mailing list: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bentoml\n* BentoML contributor slack channel: https://bentoml.slack.com/archives/CKC2JP3TM\n\n\n## Roles And Responsibilities\n\n#### Contributors\n\nContributors are community members who contribute in concrete ways to the project.\nAnyone can become a contributor, and contributions can take many forms, as detailed in\nthe [BentoML Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\nThere is no expectation of commitment to the project, no specific skill requirements and\nno selection process.\n\nAs a contributor, you may find yourself doing one or more of the following:\n\n* Support new users by answering questions on the\n    [github issue tracker](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/issues) and the\n    [#bentoml-users slack channel](https://join.slack.bentoml.org).\n* Report issues you're facing and \"Thumbs up\" on issues and feature requests that are\n    relevant to you in BentoML's [issue tracker](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/issues).\n* Investigate bugs and reviewing other developer's pull requests.\n* Contribute code or documentation to the project by submitting a Github pull request.\n* Create new example projects and contribute it to the [Examples Overview page](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/latest/examples/overview.html).\n\n\nContributors engage with the project through the issue tracker and mailing list. They\nsubmit code or documentation changes to the project via github pull request, which will\nbe reviewed by the Core Team members (see next section).\n\nThe [BentoML contributors mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bentoml)\nis the most appropriate place to ask for help or get feedback when making contributions.\n\nAs contributors gain experience and familiarity with the project, their profile within,\nand commitment to, the community will increase. At some stage, they may find themselves\nbeing nominated for the BentoML Core Team.\n\n\n#### Core Team\n\nThe BentoML Core Team consist of contributors who have produced contributions that are\nsubstantial in quality and quantity. The core team members has additional\nresponsibilities over those of a contributor. These responsibilities ensure the smooth\nrunning of the project:\n\n* Managing the BentoML code and documentation\n* Managing QA and new releases\n* Maintaining a high-level technical direction and roadmap\n* Project governance decisions and changes\n* Coordination of core team, contributors and users\n* Managing the membership of the core team\n* Make final decisions when regular community discussion doesn’t produce consensus on\n    an issue in a reasonable time frame.\n\n\nMembers of the Core Team do not have significant authority over other members of the\ncommunity, although it is the Core Team that votes on new Core Team members. It also\nmakes decisions when community consensus cannot be reached.\n\nA contributor who shows an above-average level of contribution to the project,\nparticularly with respect to its strategic direction and long-term health, may be\nnominated to become a member of the Core Team, by existing Core Team members. A\nnomination will result in discussion and then a vote by the existing Core Team members.\nCore Team membership votes are subject to consensus approval of the current Core Team\nmembers.\n\n\n#### Benevolent dictator (project lead)\n\nThe Project will have a BDFL (Benevolent Dictator for Life), who is currently Chaoyu\nYang. As Dictator, the BDFL has the authority to make all final decisions for The\nProject. As Benevolent, the BDFL, in practice chooses to defer that authority to the\nconsensus of the community discussion channels and the Core Team. It is expected that\nthe BDFL will only rarely assert his/her final authority. Because it is rarely used, we\nrefer to BDFL’s final authority as a “special” or “overriding” vote. When it does occur,\nthe BDFL override typically happens in situations where there is a deadlock in the Core\nTeam or if the Core Team asks the BDFL to make a decision on a specific matter. To\nensure the benevolence of the BDFL, The Project encourages others to fork The Project if\nthey disagree with the overall direction the BDFL is taking. The BDFL is chair of the\nCore Team and may delegate his/her authority on a particular decision or set of\ndecisions to any other Core Team Member at his/her discretion.\n\nThe BDFL can appoint his/her successor, but it is expected that the Core Team would be\nconsulted on this decision. If the BDFL is unable to appoint a successor (e.g. due to\ndeath or illness), the Core Team will choose a successor by voting with at least 2/3 of\nthe Core Team members voting in favor of the chosen successor. At least 80% of the Core\nTeam must participate in the vote.\n\n\n#### Conflict of interest\n\nIt is expected that the BDFL and Core Team Members will be employed at a wide range of\ncompanies, universities and non-profit organizations. Because of this, it is possible\nthat Members will have conflicts of interest. Such conflicts of interest include, but\nare not limited to:\n\nFinancial interests, such as investments, employment or contracting work, outside of The\nProject that may influence their work on The Project. Access to proprietary information\nof their employer that could potentially leak into their work with the Project. All\nmembers of the Core Team, BDFL included, shall disclose to the rest of the Core Team any\nconflict of interest they may have. Members with a conflict of interest in a particular\nissue may participate in Core Team discussions on that issue, but must recuse themselves\nfrom voting on the issue. If the BDFL has recused his/herself for a particular decision,\nthey will appoint a substitute BDFL for that decision.\n\n\n#### Current Core Team Members\n\n* Bo Jiang - [@bojiang](https://github.com/bojiang)\n* Bozhao Yu - [@yubozhao](https://github.com/yubozhao), [🔗linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bozhaoyu/)\n* Chaoyu Yang (BDFL) - [@parano](https://github.com/parano), [🔗linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/parano/)\n* Liang Sun - [@leonsim](https://github.com/leonsim), [🔗linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/1e0ns/)\n* Sungjun Kim - [@withsmilo](https://github.com/withsmilo), [🔗linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/smilo/)\n* TBD\n* TBD\n\n\n## Contribution Process\n\nAnyone can contribute to the project, regardless of their skills, as there are many ways\nto contribute. For instance, a contributor might be active on the project mailing list\nand issue tracker, or might supply patches. The various ways of contributing are\ndescribed in more detail in the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nThe [BentoML contributor mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bentoml)\nis the most appropriate place to ask for help or get feedback when making contributions.\n\n\n## Decision Making Process\n\nDecisions about the future of the project are made through discussion with all members\nof the community, from the newest user to the most experienced PMC member. All\nnon-sensitive project management discussion takes place on the\n[BentoML contributors mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bentoml).\n\nIn order to ensure that the project is not bogged down by endless discussion and\ncontinual voting, the project operates a policy of lazy consensus. This allows the\nmajority of decisions to be made without resorting to a formal vote.\n\n\n#### Lazy consensus\n\nDecision making typically involves the following steps:\n\n* Proposal\n* Discussion\n* Vote (if consensus is not reached through discussion)\n* Decision\n\nAny community member can make a proposal for consideration by the community. In order to\ninitiate a discussion about a new idea, they should send an email to the BentoML\ncontributors’ list or create a github issue describing the idea. This will prompt a\nreview and, if necessary, a discussion of the idea. The goal of this review and\ndiscussion is to gain approval for the contribution. Since most people in the project\ncommunity have a shared vision, there is often little need for discussion in order to\nreach consensus.\n\nIn general, as long as nobody explicitly opposes a proposal or patch, it is recognised\nas having the support of the community. This is called lazy consensus - that is, those\nwho have not stated their opinion explicitly have implicitly agreed to the\nimplementation of the proposal.\n\nLazy consensus is a very important concept within the project. It is this process that\nallows a large group of people to efficiently reach consensus, as someone with no\nobjections to a proposal need not spend time stating their position, and others need\nnot spend time reading such mails.\n\nFor lazy consensus to be effective, it is necessary to allow at least 72 hours before\nassuming that there are no objections to the proposal. This requirement ensures that\neveryone is given enough time to read, digest and respond to the proposal. This time\nperiod is chosen so as to be as inclusive as possible of all participants, regardless\nof their location and time commitments.\n\n\n#### Voting\n\nNot all decisions can be made using lazy consensus. Issues such as those affecting the\nstrategic direction or legal standing of the project must gain explicit approval from\nthe Core Team, which will adopt the\n[Apache Foundation voting process](https://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html).\nEvery member of the community is encouraged to express their opinions in\nall discussion and all votes. However, only Core Team members have binding votes for the\npurposes of decision making.\n"

Manage your environments, dependencies and model versions with a simple config file. BentoML automatically generates Docker images, ensures reproducibility, and simplifies how you deploy to different environments.\n- **🧭 Maximize CPU/GPU utilization.** Build high performance inference APIs leveraging built-in serving optimization features like dynamic batching, model parallelism, multi-stage pipeline and multi-model inference-graph orchestration.\n- **👩‍💻 Fully customizable.** Easily implement your own APIs or task queues, with custom business logic, model inference and multi-model composition. Supports any ML framework, modality, and inference runtime.\n- **🚀 Ready for Production.** Develop, run and debug locally. Seamlessly deploy to production with Docker containers or [BentoCloud](https://www.bentoml.com/).\n\n## Getting started\n\nInstall BentoML:\n\n```\n# Requires Python≥3.9\npip install -U bentoml\n```\n\nDefine APIs in a `service.py` file.\n\n```python\nfrom __future__ import annotations\n\nimport bentoml\n\n@bentoml.service(\n    resources={\"cpu\": \"4\"}\n)\nclass Summarization:\n    def __init__(self) -> None:\n        import torch\n        from transformers import pipeline\n\n        device = \"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\"\n        self.pipeline = pipeline('summarization', device=device)\n\n    @bentoml.api(batchable=True)\n    def summarize(self, texts: list[str]) -> list[str]:\n        results = self.pipeline(texts)\n        return [item['summary_text'] for item in results]\n```\n\nRun the service code locally (serving at http://localhost:3000 by default):\n\n```bash\npip install torch transformers  # additional dependencies for local run\n\nbentoml serve service.py:Summarization\n```\n\nNow you can run inference from your browser at http://localhost:3000 or with a Python script:\n\n```python\nimport bentoml\n\nwith bentoml.SyncHTTPClient('http://localhost:3000') as client:\n    summarized_text: str = client.summarize([bentoml.__doc__])[0]\n    print(f\"Result: {summarized_text}\")\n```\n\n### Deploying your first Bento\n\nTo deploy your BentoML Service code, first create a `bentofile.yaml` file to define its dependencies and environments. Find the full list of bentofile options [here](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/latest/reference/bentoml/bento-build-options.html).\n\n```yaml\nservice: 'service:Summarization' # Entry service import path\ninclude:\n  - '*.py' # Include all .py files in current directory\npython:\n  packages: # Python dependencies to include\n    - torch\n    - transformers\ndocker:\n  python_version: \"3.11\"\n```\n\nThen, choose one of the following ways for deployment:\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>🐳 Docker Container</summary>\n\nRun `bentoml build` to package necessary code, models, dependency configs into a Bento - the standardized deployable artifact in BentoML:\n\n```bash\nbentoml build\n```\n\nEnsure [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) is running. Generate a Docker container image for deployment:\n\n```bash\nbentoml containerize summarization:latest\n```\n\nRun the generated image:\n\n```bash\ndocker run --rm -p 3000:3000 summarization:latest\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>☁️ BentoCloud</summary>\n\n[BentoCloud](www.bentoml.com) provides compute infrastructure for rapid and reliable GenAI adoption.
