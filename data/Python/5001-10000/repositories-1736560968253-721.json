          "content": "# Contributing to TagStudio\n\n_Last Updated: December 12th, 2024_\n\nThank you so much for showing interest in contributing to TagStudio! Here are a set of instructions and guidelines for contributing code or documentation to the project. This document will change over time, so make sure that your contributions still line up with the requirements here before submitting a pull request.\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> **As of Pull Request [#332](https://github.com/TagStudioDev/TagStudio/pull/332) (SQLite Migration) the `main` branch will marked as experimental before full JSON to SQL parity is operational.** Existing TagStudio libraries are not yet compatible with this change, however they will **NOT be corrupted or deleted** if opened with these versions. Once parity is reached and a stable conversion tool in place, this notice will be removed. UPDATE: As of November 19th, 2024, full parity is rapidly approaching.\n>\n> For the most recent stable feature release branch, see the [`Alpha-v9.4`](https://github.com/TagStudioDev/TagStudio/tree/Alpha-v9.4) branch. These v9.4 specific features are currently being backported to the SQL-ized `main` branch. (Feel free to help!)\n\n## Getting Started\n\n-   Check the [Feature Roadmap](/docs/updates/roadmap.md) page to see what priority features there are, the [FAQ](/README.md/#faq), as well as the open [Issues](https://github.com/TagStudioDev/TagStudio/issues) and [Pull Requests](https://github.com/TagStudioDev/TagStudio/pulls).\n-   If you'd like to add a feature that isn't on the feature roadmap or doesn't have an open issue, **PLEASE create a feature request** issue for it discussing your intentions so any feedback or important information can be given by the team first.\n    -   We don't want you wasting time developing a feature or making a change that can't/won't be added for any reason ranging from pre-existing refactors to design philosophy differences.\n- **Please don't** create pull requests that consist of large refactors, *especially* without discussing them with us first. These end up doing more harm than good for the project by continuously delaying progress and disrupting everyone else's work.\n-   If you wish to discuss TagStudio further, feel free to join the [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/hRNnVKhF2G)\n\n### Contribution Checklist\n\n-   I've read the [Feature Roadmap](/docs/updates/roadmap.md) page\n-   I've read the [FAQ](/README.md/#faq), including the \"[Features I Likely Won't Add/Pull](/README.md/#features-i-likely-wont-addpull)\" section\n-   I've checked the open [Issues](https://github.com/TagStudioDev/TagStudio/issues) and [Pull Requests](https://github.com/TagStudioDev/TagStudio/pulls)\n-   **I've created a new issue for my feature/fix _before_ starting work on it**, or have at least notified others in the relevant existing issue(s) of my intention to work on it\n-   I've set up my development environment including Ruff, Mypy, and PyTest\n-   I've read the [Code Guidelines](#code-guidelines) and/or [Documentation Guidelines](#documentation-guidelines)\n-   **_I mean it, I've found or created an issue for my feature/fix!_**\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> If the fix is small and self-explanatory (i.e. a typo), then it doesn't require an issue to be opened first. Issue tracking is supposed to make our lives easier, not harder. Please use your best judgement to minimize the amount of work involved for everyone involved.\n\n## Creating a Development Environment\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n-   [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.12\n-   [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) (Included in `requirements-dev.txt`)\n-   [Mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) (Included in `requirements-dev.txt`)\n-   [PyTest](https://docs.pytest.org) (Included in `requirements-dev.txt`)\n\n### Creating a Python Virtual Environment\n\nIf you wish to launch the source version of TagStudio outside of your IDE:\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Depending on your system, Python may be called `python`, `py`, `python3`, or `py3`. These instructions use the alias `python3` for consistency. You can check to see which alias your system uses and if it's for the correct Python version by typing `python3 --version` (or whichever alias) into your terminal.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> On Linux and macOS, you can launch the `tagstudio.sh` script to skip the following process, minus the `requirements-dev.txt` installation step. _Using the script is fine if you just want to launch the program from source._\n\n1. In the root repository directory, create a python virtual environment:  \n   `python3 -m venv .venv`\n2. Activate your environment:\n\n-   Windows w/Powershell: `.venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1`\n-   Windows w/Command Prompt: `.venv\\Scripts\\activate.bat`\n-   Linux/macOS: `source .venv/bin/activate`\n\n3. Install the required packages:\n\n-   `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n-   If developing (includes Ruff and Mypy): `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`\n\n_Learn more about setting up a virtual environment [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)._\n\n### Manually Launching (Outside of an IDE)\n\n-   **Windows** (start_win.bat)\n\n    -   To launch TagStudio, launch the `start_win.bat` file. You can modify this .bat file or create a shortcut and add one or more additional arguments if desired.\n\n-   **Linux/macOS** (TagStudio.sh)\n\n    -   Run the \"TagStudio.sh\" script and the program should launch! (Make sure that the script is marked as executable if on Linux). Note that launching from the script from outside of a terminal will not launch a terminal window with any debug or crash information. If you wish to see this information, just launch the shell script directly from your terminal with `./TagStudio.sh`.\n\n    -   **NixOS** (Nix Flake)\n        -   Use the provided [Flake](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) to create and enter a working environment by running `nix develop`. Then, run the program via `python3 tagstudio/tag_studio.py` from the root directory.\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Support for NixOS is still a work in progress.\n\n-   **Any** (No Scripts)\n\n    -   Alternatively, with the virtual environment loaded, run the python file at `tagstudio\\tag_studio.py` from your terminal. If you're in the project's root directory, simply run `python3 tagstudio/tag_studio.py`.\n\n## Workflow Checks\n\nWhen pushing your code, several automated workflows will check it against predefined tests and style checks. It's _highly recommended_ that you run these checks locally beforehand to avoid having to fight back-and-forth with the workflow checks inside your pull requests.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> To format the code automatically before each commit, there's a configured action available for the `pre-commit` hook. Install it by running `pre-commit install`. The hook will be executed each time on running `git commit`.\n\n### [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff)\n\nA Python linter and code formatter. Ruff uses the `pyproject.toml` as its config file and runs whenever code is pushed or pulled into the project.\n\n#### Running Locally\n\nInside the root repository directory:\n\n-   Lint code with `ruff check`\n    -   Some linting suggestions can be automatically formatted with `ruff check --fix`\n-   Format code with `ruff format`\n\nRuff should automatically discover the configuration options inside the [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/TagStudioDev/TagStudio/blob/main/pyproject.toml) file. For more information, see the [ruff configuration discovery docs](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/configuration/#config-file-discovery).\n\nRuff is also available as a VS Code [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=charliermarsh.ruff), PyCharm [plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/20574-ruff), and [more](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/integrations/).\n\n### [Mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy)\n\nMypy is a static type checker for Python. It sure has a lot to say sometimes, but we recommend you take its advice when possible. Mypy also uses the `pyproject.toml` as its config file and runs whenever code is pushed or pulled into the project.\n\n#### Running Locally\n\n-   **First time only:** Move into the `/tagstudio` directory with `cd tagstudio` and run the following:\n    -   `mkdir -p .mypy_cache`\n    -   `mypy --install-types --non-interactive`\n-   Check code by moving into the `/tagstudio` directory with `cd tagstudio` _(if you aren't already inside)_ and running `mypy --config-file ../pyproject.toml .`. _(Don't forget the `.` at the end!)_\n\nMypy is also available as a VS Code [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=matangover.mypy), PyCharm [plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/11086-mypy), and [more](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/11086-mypy).\n\n### PyTest\n\n-   Run all tests by moving into the `/tagstudio` directory with `cd tagstudio` and running `pytest tests/`.\n\n## Code Style\n\nMost of the style guidelines can be checked, fixed, and enforced via Ruff. Older code may not be adhering to all of these guidelines, in which case _\"do as I say, not as I do\"..._\n\n-   Do your best to write clear, concise, and modular code.\n-   Keep a maximum column with of no more than **100** characters.\n-   Code comments should be used to help describe sections of code that can't speak for themselves.\n-   Use [Google style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#s3.8-comments-and-docstrings) docstrings for any classes and functions you add.\n    -   If you're modifying an existing function that does _not_ have docstrings, you don't _have_ to add docstrings to it... but it would be pretty cool if you did ;)\n-   Imports should be ordered alphabetically.\n-   Lists of values should be ordered using their [natural sort order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_sort_order).\n    -   Some files have their methods ordered alphabetically as well (i.e. [`thumb_renderer`](https://github.com/TagStudioDev/TagStudio/blob/main/tagstudio/src/qt/widgets/thumb_renderer.py)). If you're working in a file and notice this, please try and keep to the pattern.\n-   When writing text for window titles or form titles, use \"[Title Case](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/capitalization/title-case)\" capitalization. Your IDE may have a command to format this for you automatically, although some may incorrectly capitalize short prepositions. In a pinch you can use a website such as [capitalizemytitle.com](https://capitalizemytitle.com/) to check.\n-   If it wasn't mentioned above, then stick to [**PEP-8**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)!\n\n### Modules & Implementations\n\n-   Avoid direct calls to `os`\n    -   Use `Pathlib` library instead of `os.path`\n    -   Use `platform.system()` instead of `os.name` and `sys.platform`\n-   Don't prepend local imports with `tagstudio`, stick to `src`\n-   Use the `logger` system instead of `print` statements\n-   Avoid nested f-strings\n-   Use HTML-like tags inside Qt widgets over stylesheets where possible.\n\n### Commit and Pull Request Style\n\n-   Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0) as a guideline for commit messages. This allows us to easily generate changelogs for releases.\n    -   See some [examples](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#examples) of what this looks like in practice.\n-   Use clear and concise commit messages. If your commit does too much, either consider breaking it up into smaller commits or providing extra detail in the commit description.\n-   Pull requests should have an adequate title and description which clearly outline your intentions and changes/additions. Feel free to provide screenshots, GIFs, or videos, especially for UI changes.\n-   Pull requests should ideally be limited to **a single** feature or fix.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> If you're unsure where to stop the scope of your PR, ask yourself: _\"If I broke this up, could any parts of it still be used by the project in the meantime?\"_\n\n### Runtime Requirements\n\n-   Final code must function on supported versions of Windows, macOS, and Linux:\n    -   Windows: 10, 11\n    -   macOS: 12.0+\n    -   Linux: _Varies_\n-   Final code must **_NOT:_**\n    -   Contain superfluous or unnecessary logging statements.\n    -   Cause unreasonable slowdowns to the program outside of a progress-indicated task.\n    -   Cause undesirable visual glitches or artifacts on screen.\n\n## Documentation Guidelines\n\nDocumentation contributions include anything inside of the `docs/` folder, as well as the `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` files. Documentation inside the `docs/` folder is built and hosted on our static documentation site, [docs.tagstud.io](https://docs.tagstud.io/).\n\n-   Use \"[snake_case](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Snake_case)\" for file and folder names\n-   Follow the folder structure pattern\n-   Don't add images or other media with excessively large file sizes\n-   Provide alt text for all embedded media\n-   Use \"[Title Case](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/capitalization/title-case)\" for title capitalization\n\n## Translation Guidelines\n\nTranslations are performed on the TagStudio [Weblate project](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/tagstudio/).\n\n_Translation guidelines coming soon._\n"

          "content": "GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works.\n\n  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13.

No proprietary programs or formats, no sea of sidecar files, and no complete upheaval of your filesystem structure. **Read the documentation and more at [docs.tagstud.io](https://docs.tagstud.io)!**\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> As of Pull Request [#332](https://github.com/TagStudioDev/TagStudio/pull/332) (SQLite Migration) the `main` branch will be an open test bed to get full JSON to SQL parity operational. This notice will be removed once parity between v9.4 and v9.5 is reached.\n>\n> For the most recent stable feature release branch, see the [`Alpha-v9.4`](https://github.com/TagStudioDev/TagStudio/tree/Alpha-v9.4) branch.

There are many missing optimizations and QoL features, as well as the presence of general quirks and occasional jankiness. Making frequent backups of your library save data is **always** important, regardless of what state the program is in.\n>\n> With this in mind, TagStudio will _NOT:_\n>\n> - Touch, move, or mess with your files in any way _(unless explicitly using the \"Delete File(s)\" feature, which is locked behind a confirmation dialog)_.\n> - Ask you to recreate your tags or libraries after new releases. It's our highest priority to ensure that your data safely and smoothly transfers over to newer versions.\n> - Cause you to suddenly be able to recall your 10 trillion downloaded images that you probably haven't even seen firsthand before. You're in control here, and even tools out there that use machine learning still needed to be verified by human eyes before being deemed accurate.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img width=\"80%\" src=\"docs/assets/screenshot.jpg\" alt=\"TagStudio Screenshot\">\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <i>TagStudio Alpha v9.4.2 running on Windows 10.</i>\n</p>\n\n## Contents\n\n- [Goals](#goals)\n- [Priorities](#priorities)\n- [Current Features](#current-features)\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\n- [Installation](#installation)\n- [Usage](#usage)\n- [FAQ](#faq)\n\n## Goals\n\n- To achieve a portable, private, extensible, open-format, and feature-rich system of organizing and rediscovering files.\n- To provide powerful methods for organization, notably the concept of tag inheritance, or ‚Äútaggable tags‚Äù _(and in the near future, the combination of composition-based tags)._\n- To create an implementation of such a system that is resilient against a user‚Äôs actions outside the program (modifying, moving, or renaming files) while also not burdening the user with mandatory sidecar files or requiring them to change their existing file structures and workflows.\n- To support a wide range of users spanning across different platforms, multi-user setups, and those with large (several terabyte) libraries.\n- To make the darn thing look like nice, too. It‚Äôs 2025, not 1995.\n\n## Priorities\n\n1. **The concept.** Even if TagStudio as an application fails, I‚Äôd hope that the idea lives on in a superior project. The [goals](#goals) outlined above don‚Äôt reference TagStudio once - _TagStudio_ is what references the _goals._\n2. **The system.** Frontends and implementations can vary, as they should. The core underlying metadata management system is what should be interoperable between different frontends, programs, and operating systems. A standard implementation for this should settle as development continues. This opens up the doors for improved and varied clients, integration with third-party applications, and more.\n3. **The application.** If nothing else, TagStudio the application serves as the first (and so far only) implementation for this system of metadata management. This has the responsibility of doing the idea justice and showing just what‚Äôs possible when it comes to user file management.\n4. (The name.) I think it‚Äôs fine for an app or client, but it doesn‚Äôt really make sense for a system or standard. I suppose this will evolve with time...\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you're interested in contributing to TagStudio, please take a look at the [contribution guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to get started!\n\nTranslation hosting generously provided by [Weblate](https://weblate.org/en/). Check out our [project page](<(https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/tagstudio/)>) to help translate TagStudio!\n\n## Current Features\n\n### Libraries\n\n- Create libraries/vaults centered around a system directory. Libraries contain a series of entries: the representations of your files combined with metadata fields. Each entry represents a file in your library‚Äôs directory, and is linked to its location.\n- Address moved, deleted, or otherwise \"unlinked\" files by using the \"Fix Unlinked Entries\" option in the Tools menu.\n\n### Metadata + Tagging\n\n- Add metadata to your library entries, including:\n  - Name, Author, Artist (Single-Line Text Fields)\n  - Description, Notes (Multiline Text Fields)\n  - Tags, Meta Tags, Content Tags (Tag Boxes)\n- Create rich tags composed of a name, a list of aliases, and a list of ‚Äúparent tags‚Äù - being tags in which these tags inherit values from.\n- Copy and paste tags and fields across file entries\n- Generate tags from your existing folder structure with the \"Folders to Tags\" macro (NOTE: these tags do NOT sync with folders after they are created)\n\n### Search\n\n- Search for entries based on tags, ~~metadata~~ (TBA), or filenames/filetypes (using `filename: <query>`).\n- Special search conditions for entries that are: `untagged` and `empty`.\n\n### File Entries\n\n- All\\* file types are supported in TagStudio libraries - just not all have dedicated thumbnail support.\n- Preview most image file types, animated GIFs, videos, plain text documents, audio files\\*\\*, Blender projects, and more!\n- Open files or file locations by right-clicking on thumbnails and previews and selecting the respective context menu options. You can also click on the preview panel image to open the file, and click the file path label to open its location.\n- Delete files from both your library and drive by right-clicking the thumbnail(s) and selecting the \"Move to Trash\"/\"Move to Recycle Bin\" option.\n\n> _\\* Weird files with no extension or files such as \".\\_DS_Store\" currently have limited support._\n>\n> _\\*\\* Audio playback coming in v9.5_\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> For more information on the project itself, please see the [FAQ](#faq) section as well as the [documentation](https://docs.tagstud.io/).\n\n## Installation\n\nTo download TagStudio, visit the [Releases](https://github.com/TagStudioDev/TagStudio/releases) section of the GitHub repository and download the latest release for your system under the \"Assets\" section. TagStudio is available for **Windows**, **macOS** _(Apple Silicon & Intel)_, and **Linux**. Windows and Linux builds are also available in portable versions if you want a more self-contained executable to move around.\n\n**We do not currently publish TagStudio to any package managers. Any TagStudio distributions outside of the GitHub releases page are _unofficial_ and not maintained by us.** Installation support will not be given to users installing from unofficial sources. Use these versions at your own risk.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> On macOS, you may be met with a message saying _\"\"TagStudio\" can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software.\"_ If you encounter this, then you'll need to go to the \"Settings\" app, navigate to \"Privacy & Security\", and scroll down to a section that says _\"\"TagStudio\" was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer.\"_ Click the \"Open Anyway\" button to allow TagStudio to run. You should only have to do this once after downloading the application.\n\n### Third-Party Dependencies\n\n- For video thumbnails and playback, you'll also need [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) installed on your system.\n\n### Optional Arguments\n\nArguments available to pass to the program, either via the command line or a shortcut.\n\n> `--open <path>` / `-o <path>`\n> Path to a TagStudio Library folder to open on start.\n>\n> `--config-file <path>` / `-c <path>`\n> Path to the TagStudio config file to load.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Creating/Opening a Library\n\nWith TagStudio opened, start by creating a new library or opening an existing one using File -> Open/Create Library from the menu bar. TagStudio will automatically create a new library from the chosen directory if one does not already exist. Upon creating a new library, TagStudio will automatically scan your folders for files and add those to your library (no files are moved during this process!).\n\n### Refreshing the Library\n\nIn order to scan for new files or file changes, you‚Äôll need to manually go to File -> Refresh Directories.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> In the future, library refreshing will also be automatically done in the background, or additionally on app startup.\n\n### Adding Metadata to Entries\n\nTo add a metadata field to a file entry, start by clicking the ‚ÄúAdd Field‚Äù button under the file preview in the right-hand preview panel. From the dropdown menu, select the type of metadata field you‚Äôd like to add to the entry.\n\n### Editing Metadata Fields\n\n#### Text Line / Text Box\n\nHover over the field and click the pencil icon. From there, add or edit text in the dialog box popup.\n\n#### Tag Box\n\nClick the ‚Äú+‚Äù button at the end of the Tags list, and search for tags to add inside the new dialog popup. Click the ‚Äú+‚Äù button next to whichever tags you want to add. Alternatively, after you search for a tag, press the Enter/Return key to add the add the first item in the list. Press Enter/Return once more to close the dialog box\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Keyboard control and navigation is currently _very_ buggy, but will be improved in future versions.\n\n### Creating Tags\n\nTo create a new tag, click on Edit -> New Tag from the menu bar. From there, enter a tag name, shorthand name, any tag aliases separated by newlines, any subtags, and an optional color.\n\n- The tag **shorthand** is a type of alias that displays in situations when screen space is more valuable (ex. as a subtag for other tags).\n- **Aliases** are alternate names for a tag. These let you search for terms other than the exact tag name in order to find the tag again.\n- **Subtags** are tags in which this tag is a child tag of. In other words, tags under this section are parents of this tag. For example, if you had a tag for a character from a show, you would make the show a subtag of this character. This would display as ‚ÄúCharacter (Show)‚Äù in most areas of the app. The first tag in this list is used as the tag shown in parentheses for specification.\n- The **color** dropdown lets you select an optional color for this tag to display as.\n\n### Editing Tags\n\nTo edit a tag, right-click the tag in the tag field of the preview pane and select ‚ÄúEdit Tag‚Äù\n\n### Relinking Renamed/Moved Files\n\nInevitably, some of the files inside your library will be renamed, moved, or deleted. If a file has been renamed or moved, TagStudio will display the thumbnail as a red tag with a cross through it _(this icon is also used for items with broken thumbnails)._ To relink moved files or delete these entries, go to Tools -> Manage Unlinked Entries. Click the ‚ÄúRefresh‚Äù button to scan your library for unlinked entries. Once complete, you can attempt to ‚ÄúSearch & Relink‚Äù any unlinked entries to their respective files, or ‚ÄúDelete Unlinked Entries‚Äù in the event the original files have been deleted and you no longer wish to keep their metadata entries inside your library.\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> There is currently no method to relink entries to files that have been renamed - only moved or deleted. This is a top priority for future releases.\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> If multiple matches for a moved file are found (matches are currently defined as files with a matching filename as the original), TagStudio will currently ignore the match groups. Adding a GUI for manual selection, as well as smarter automated relinking, are top priorities for future versions.\n\n### Saving the Library\n\nLibraries are saved upon exiting the program. To manually save, select File -> Save Library from the menu bar. To save a backup of your library, select File -> Save Library Backup from the menu bar. Automatic backups are created when loading a library, and are automatically loaded from in the event of a crash or unexpected system shutdown.\n\n### Half-Implemented Features\n\n#### Fix Duplicate Files\n\nLoad in a .dupeguru file generated by [dupeGuru](https://github.com/arsenetar/dupeguru/) and mirror metadata across entries marked as duplicates. After mirroring, return to dupeGuru to manage deletion of the duplicate files. After deletion, use the ‚ÄúFix Unlinked Entries‚Äù feature in TagStudio to delete the duplicate set of entries for the now-deleted files\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> While this feature is functional, it‚Äôs a pretty roundabout process and can be streamlined in the future.\n\n#### Image Collage\n\nCreate an image collage of your photos and videos.\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> Collage sizes and options are hardcoded, and there's no GUI indicating the process of the collage creation.\n\n#### Macros\n\nApply tags and other metadata automatically depending on certain criteria. Set specific macros to run when the files are added to the library. Part of this includes applying tags automatically based on parent folders.\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> Macro options are hardcoded, and there‚Äôs currently no way for the user to interface with this (still incomplete) system at all.\n\n#### Gallery-dl Sidecar Importing\n\nImport JSON sidecar data generated by [gallery-dl](https://github.com/mikf/gallery-dl).\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> This feature is not supported or documented in any official capacity whatsoever. It will likely be rolled-in to a larger and more generalized sidecar importing feature in the future.\n\n## Launching/Building From Source\n\nSee instructions in the \"[Creating Development Environment](/CONTRIBUTING.md/#creating-a-development-environment)\" section from the [contribution documentation](/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## FAQ\n\n### What State Is the Project Currently In?\n\nAs of writing (Alpha v9.4.2) the project is in a useable state, however includes several metadata field bugs and lacks several quality of life features. Focus has been on developing v9.5 with a new SQLite backend which will allow us to not only fix these bugs but also to give us a jumping off point for some [pretty cool](https://docs.tagstud.io/updates/roadmap/) features we've been wanting to add for quite a while now!\n\n### What Features Are You Planning on Adding?\n\nSee the [Feature Roadmap](https://docs.tagstud.io/updates/roadmap/) page for the core features being planned and implemented for TagStudio. For a more up to date look on what's currently being added for upcoming releases, see our GitHub [milestones](https://github.com/TagStudioDev/TagStudio/milestones) for versioned releases.\n\n### Features That Will NOT Be Added\n\n- Native Cloud Integration\n  - There are plenty of services already (native or third-party) that allow you to mount your cloud drives as virtual drives on your system. Hosting a TagStudio library on one of these mounts should function similarly to what native integration would look like.\n  - Supporting native cloud integrations such as these would be an unnecessary \"reinventing the wheel\" burden for us that is outside the scope of this project.\n- Native ChatGPT/Non-Local LLM Integration\n  - This could mean different things depending on your intentions. Whether it's trying to use an LLM to replace the native search, or to trying to use a model for image recognition, I'm not interested in hooking people's TagStudio libraries into non-local LLMs such as ChatGPT and/or turn the program into a \"chatbot\" interface (see: [Goals/Privacy](#goals)). I wouldn't, however, mind using **locally** hosted models to provide the _optional_ ability for additional searching and tagging methods (especially when it comes to facial recognition) - but this would likely take the form of plugins external to the core program anyway.\n\n### Why Is this Already Version 9?\n\nOver the first few years of private development the project went through several major iterations and rewrites. These major version bumps came quickly, and by the time TagStudio was opened-sourced the version number had already reached v9.0. Instead of resetting to \"v0.0\" or \"v1.0\" for this public release I decided to keep my v9.x numbering scheme and reserve v10.0 for when all the core features on the [Feature Roadmap](https://docs.tagstud.io/updates/roadmap/) are implemented. I‚Äôve also labeled this version as an \"Alpha\" and will drop this once either all of the core features are implemented or the project feels stable and feature-rich enough to be considered \"Beta\" and beyond.\n"
