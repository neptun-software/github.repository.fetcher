模型简介\n\n本项目推出了基于Llama-2的中文LLaMA-2以及Alpaca-2系列模型，相比[一期项目](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca)其主要特点如下：\n\n#### 📖 经过优化的中文词表\n\n- 在[一期项目](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca)中，我们针对一代LLaMA模型的32K词表扩展了中文字词（LLaMA：49953，Alpaca：49954）\n- 在本项目中，我们**重新设计了新词表**（大小：55296），进一步提升了中文字词的覆盖程度，同时统一了LLaMA/Alpaca的词表，避免了因混用词表带来的问题，以期进一步提升模型对中文文本的编解码效率\n\n#### ⚡ 基于FlashAttention-2的高效注意力\n\n- [FlashAttention-2](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention)是高效注意力机制的一种实现，相比其一代技术具有**更快的速度和更优化的显存占用**\n- 当上下文长度更长时，为了避免显存爆炸式的增长，使用此类高效注意力技术尤为重要\n- 本项目的所有模型均使用了FlashAttention-2技术进行训练\n\n#### 🚄 基于PI和YaRN的超长上下文扩展技术\n\n- 在[一期项目](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca)中，我们实现了[基于NTK的上下文扩展技术](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca/pull/743)，可在不继续训练模型的情况下支持更长的上下文\n- 基于[位置插值PI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15595)和NTK等方法推出了16K长上下文版模型，支持16K上下文，并可通过NTK方法最高扩展至24K-32K\n- 基于[YaRN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00071)方法进一步推出了64K长上下文版模型，支持64K上下文\n- 进一步设计了**方便的自适应经验公式**，无需针对不同的上下文长度设置NTK超参，降低了使用难度\n\n#### 🤖 简化的中英双语系统提示语\n\n- 在[一期项目](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca)中，中文Alpaca系列模型使用了[Stanford Alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca)的指令模板和系统提示语\n- 初步实验发现，Llama-2-Chat系列模型的默认系统提示语未能带来统计显著的性能提升，且其内容过于冗长\n- 本项目中的Alpaca-2系列模型简化了系统提示语，同时遵循Llama-2-Chat指令模板，以便更好地适配相关生态\n\n#### 👮 人类偏好对齐\n\n- 在[一期项目](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca)中，中文Alpaca系列模型仅完成预训练和指令精调，获得了基本的对话能力\n- 通过基于人类反馈的强化学习（RLHF）实验，发现可显著提升模型传递正确价值观的能力\n- 本项目推出了Alpaca-2-RLHF系列模型，使用方式与SFT模型一致\n\n\n\n下图展示了本项目以及[一期项目](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca)推出的所有大模型之间的关系。\n\n![](./pics/models.png)\n\n## 模型下载\n\n###

系统效果\n\n为了评测相关模型的效果，本项目分别进行了生成效果评测和客观效果评测（NLU类），从不同角度对大模型进行评估。需要注意的是，综合评估大模型能力仍然是亟待解决的重要课题，单个数据集的结果并不能综合评估模型性能。推荐用户在自己关注的任务上进行测试，选择适配相关任务的模型。\n\n### 生成效果评测\n\n为了更加直观地了解模型的生成效果，本项目仿照[Fastchat Chatbot Arena](https://chat.lmsys.org/?arena)推出了模型在线对战平台，可浏览和评测模型回复质量。对战平台提供了胜率、Elo评分等评测指标，并且可以查看两两模型的对战胜率等结果。题库来自于[一期项目人工制作的200题](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca/tree/main/examples/f16-p7b-p13b-33b)，以及在此基础上额外增加的题目。生成回复具有随机性，受解码超参、随机种子等因素影响，因此相关评测并非绝对严谨，结果仅供晾晒参考，欢迎自行体验。部分生成样例请查看[examples目录](./examples)。\n\n**⚔️

We open-source Chinese LLaMA-2 (foundation model) and Alpaca-2 (instruction-following model). These models have been expanded and optimized with Chinese vocabulary beyond the original Llama-2. We used large-scale Chinese data for incremental pre-training, which further improved the fundamental semantic understanding of the Chinese language, resulting in a significant performance improvement compared to the first-generation models. Standard version supports 4K context, and long context version supports 16K and 64K context. The RLHF models are fine-tuned for human preference alignment and have gained significant performance improvements in the representation of correct values compared to the standard version of the model.\n\n#### Main Contents\n\n- 🚀 New extended Chinese vocabulary beyond Llama-2, open-sourcing the Chinese LLaMA-2 and Alpaca-2 LLMs.\n- 🚀 Open-sourced the pre-training and instruction finetuning (SFT) scripts for further tuning on user's data\n- 🚀 Quickly deploy and experience the quantized LLMs on CPU/GPU of personal PC\n- 🚀 Support for LLaMA ecosystems like [🤗transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers), [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp), [text-generation-webui](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui), [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain), [privateGPT](https://github.com/imartinez/privateGPT), [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) etc.\n\n#### Open-sourced Models\n\n- Base model: Chinese-LLaMA-2 (1.3B, 7B, 13B)\n- Instruction/chat model: Chinese-Alpaca-2 (1.3B, 7B, 13B)\n- Long context model (16K/64K): \n  - Chinese-LLaMA-2-16K (7B, 13B) 、Chinese-Alpaca-2-16K (7B, 13B) \n  - Chinese-LLaMA-2-64K (7B)、Chinese-Alpaca-2-64K (7B)\n- RLHF model：Chinese-Alpaca-2-RLHF (1.3B, 7B)\n\n![](./pics/screencast.gif)\n\n----\n\n[Chinese LLaMA&Alpaca LLMs](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca)| [Visual Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca](https://github.com/airaria/Visual-Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca) | [Multi-modal VLE](https://github.com/iflytek/VLE) | [Chinese MiniRBT](https://github.com/iflytek/MiniRBT) | [Chinese LERT](https://github.com/ymcui/LERT) | [Chinese-English PERT](https://github.com/ymcui/PERT) | [Chinese MacBERT](https://github.com/ymcui/MacBERT) | [Chinese ELECTRA](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-ELECTRA) | [Chinese XLNet](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-XLNet) | [Chinese BERT](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-BERT-wwm) | [Knowledge distillation tool TextBrewer](https://github.com/airaria/TextBrewer) | [Model pruning tool TextPruner](https://github.com/airaria/TextPruner)\n\n## News\n\n**[Apr 30, 2024] Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca-3 project introduces Llama-3-Chinese-8B and Llama-3-Chinese-8B-Instruct, based on Meta's Llama-3.

Compared to the [first generation of the project](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca), the main features include:\n\n**📖 Optimized Chinese Vocabulary**\n\n- In the [first generation of the project](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca), we expanded Chinese words and characters for the first-generation Chinese LLaMA model (LLaMA: 49953, Alpaca: 49954) to improve the model's encoding and decoding efficiency of Chinese texts.\n- In this project, we **redesigned the new vocabulary** (size: 55296) to further improve the coverage of Chinese words and characters. We also unified the LLaMA/Alpaca vocabulary to avoid problems due to mixed use.\n\n**⚡ Efficient FlashAttention-2**\n\n- [FlashAttention-2](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention) is an implementation of efficient attention mechanisms, offering **faster speed and optimized memory usage** compared to its first-generation.\n- When the context length is longer, using efficient attention technology is essential to prevent explosive growth in memory usage.\n\n**🚄 Adaptive Context Extension based on PI and YaRN**\n\n- In the [first generation of the project](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca), we implemented the [context extension based on NTK](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca/pull/743), which can support longer contexts without further training the model.\n- We release long context models, using [PI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15595) and NTK methods, supporting 16K context, and can be further extended up to 24K-32K\n- We further release long context models, using [YaRN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00071), supporting 64K context\n- Based on the above, we further designed a **convenient adaptive empirical formula** that does not require manually setting corresponding hyperparameters for different context lengths.\n\n**🤖 Simplified Bilingual System Prompt**\n\n- In the [first generation of the project](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca), we use [Stanford Alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca) template for our Chinese Alpaca models\n- Through preliminary experiments, we found that the lengthy system prompt by Llama-2-Chat is not as effective as a simple one\n- We use a very simple system prompt while keeping the Llama-2-Chat template to better adapt to relevant ecosystems\n\n#### 👮 Human Preference Alignment\n\n- In the [first generation of the project](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca), the Chinese Alpaca models completed pre-training and instruction fine-tuning, and gained basic conversational ability\n- Through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) experiments, we find that the ability of the model to convey correct values can be significantly improved\n- This project introduces the Alpaca-2-RLHF series of models, which are used in the same way as the SFT models\n\nThe following figure depicts all open-sourced models for our projects (including the [first-gen project](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca)).\n\n![](./pics/models.png)\n\n## Download\n\n### Model Selection Guide\n\nBelow

The arena platform provides evaluation indicators such as win rate and Elo score, and you can view the win rate of battles between two models. The question bank comes from [200 questions manually created in the first-generation project](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca/tree/main/examples/f16-p7b-p13b-33b), and additional questions added on this basis. Generated replies are subject to randomness and are influenced by decoding hyperparameters, random seeds, etc., so the related evaluations are not absolutely rigorous. The results are only for reference, and you are welcome to experience it yourself. Please see the [examples directory](./examples) for some generated examples.\n\n**⚔️ Online Chatbot Arena: [http://llm-arena.ymcui.com](http://llm-arena.ymcui.com/)**\n\n| System                                                       | Win Rate (no tie)↓ | Elo Rating |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------: | :--------: |\n| **Chinese-Alpaca-2-13B-16K**                                 |        86.84%        |  1580   |\n| **Chinese-Alpaca-2-13B**                                     |        72.01%        |  1579   |\n| [Chinese-Alpaca-Pro-33B](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca) |        64.87%        |  1548   |\n| **Chinese-Alpaca-2-7B**                                      |        64.11%        |  1572   |\n| [Chinese-Alpaca-Pro-7B](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca) |        62.05%        |  1500   |\n| **Chinese-Alpaca-2-7B-16K**                                  |        61.67%        |  1540   |\n| [Chinese-Alpaca-Pro-13B](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca) |        61.26%        |  1567   |\n| [Chinese-Alpaca-Plus-33B](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca) |        31.29%        |  1401   |\n| [Chinese-Alpaca-Plus-13B](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca) |        23.43%        |  1329   |\n| [Chinese-Alpaca-Plus-7B](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca) |        20.92%        |  1379   |\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Results timestamp: Sep 1. 2023 .
