isort deprecates official support for Python 3.4, removing modules only in this release from known_standard_library:\n      - user\n  - Config files are no longer composed on-top of each-other. Instead the first config file found is used.\n    - Since there is no longer composition negative form settings (such as --dont-skip or it's config file variant `not_skip`) are no longer required and have been removed.\n  - Two-letter shortened setting names (like `ac` for `atomic`) now require two dashes to avoid ambiguity: `--ac`.\n  - For consistency with other tools `-v` now is shorthand for verbose and `-V` is shorthand for version. See Issue: #1067.\n  - `length_sort_{section_name}` config usage has been deprecated. Instead `length_sort_sections` list can be used to specify a list of sections that need to be length sorted.\n  - `safety_excludes` and `unsafe` have been deprecated\n  - Config now includes as default full set of safety directories defined by safety excludes.\n  - `--recursive` option has been removed. Directories passed in are now automatically sorted recursive.\n  - `--apply` option has been removed as it is the default behaviour.\n  - isort now does nothing, beyond giving instructions and exiting status code 0, when ran with no arguments.\n    - a new `--interactive` flag has been added to enable the old style behaviour.\n  - isort now works on contiguous sections of imports, instead of one whole file at a time.\n  - ~~isort now formats all nested \"as\" imports in the \"from\" form. `import x.y as a` becomes `from x import y as a`.~~ NOTE: This was undone in version 5.1.0 due to feedback it caused issues with some project conventions.\n  - `keep_direct_and_as_imports` option now defaults to `True`.\n  - `appdirs` is no longer supported. Unless manually specified, config should be project config only.\n  - `toml` is now installed as a vendorized module, meaning pyproject.toml based config is always supported.\n  - Completely new Python API, old version is removed and no longer accessible.\n  - New module placement logic and module fully replaces old finders. Old approach is still available via `--old-finders`.\n\nInternal:\n\n  - isort now utilizes mypy and typing to filter out typing related issues before deployment.\n  - isort now utilizes black internally to ensure more consistent formatting.\n\n- profile support for common project types (black, django, google, etc)\n\n- Much much more. There is some difficulty in fully capturing the extent of changes in this release - just because of how all encompassing the release is.

See the isort and black compatibility guide.](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/docs/configuration/black_compatibility.html)\n- [isort has official support for pre-commit!](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/docs/configuration/pre-commit.html)\n\n![Example Usage](https://raw.github.com/pycqa/isort/main/example.gif)\n\nBefore isort:\n\n```python\nfrom my_lib import Object\n\nimport os\n\nfrom my_lib import Object3\n\nfrom my_lib import Object2\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom third_party import lib15, lib1, lib2, lib3, lib4, lib5, lib6, lib7, lib8, lib9, lib10, lib11, lib12, lib13, lib14\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom __future__ import absolute_import\n\nfrom third_party import lib3\n\nprint(\"Hey\")\nprint(\"yo\")\n```\n\nAfter isort:\n\n```python\nfrom __future__ import absolute_import\n\nimport os\nimport sys\n\nfrom third_party import (lib1, lib2, lib3, lib4, lib5, lib6, lib7, lib8,\n                         lib9, lib10, lib11, lib12, lib13, lib14, lib15)\n\nfrom my_lib import Object, Object2, Object3\n\nprint(\"Hey\")\nprint(\"yo\")\n```\n\n## Installing isort\n\nInstalling isort is as simple as:\n\n```bash\npip install isort\n```\n\n## Using isort\n\n**From the command line**:\n\nTo run on specific files:\n\n```bash\nisort mypythonfile.py mypythonfile2.py\n```\n\nTo apply recursively:\n\n```bash\nisort .\n```\n\nIf [globstar](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/The-Shopt-Builtin.html)\nis enabled, `isort .` is equivalent to:\n\n```bash\nisort **/*.py\n```\n\nTo view proposed changes without applying them:\n\n```bash\nisort mypythonfile.py --diff\n```\n\nFinally, to atomically run isort against a project, only applying\nchanges if they don't introduce syntax errors:\n\n```bash\nisort --atomic .\n```\n\n(Note: this is disabled by default, as it prevents isort from\nrunning against code written using a different version of Python.)\n\n**From within Python**:\n\n```python\nimport isort\n\nisort.file(\"pythonfile.py\")\n```\n\nor:\n\n```python\nimport isort\n\nsorted_code = isort.code(\"import b\\nimport a\\n\")\n```\n\n## Installing isort's for your preferred text editor\n\nSeveral plugins have been written that enable to use isort from within a\nvariety of text-editors. You can find a full list of them [on the isort\nwiki](https://github.com/pycqa/isort/wiki/isort-Plugins).\nAdditionally, I will enthusiastically accept pull requests that include\nplugins for other text editors and add documentation for them as I am\nnotified.\n\n## Multi line output modes\n\nYou will notice above the \\\"multi\\_line\\_output\\\" setting. This setting\ndefines how from imports wrap when they extend past the line\\_length\nlimit and has [12 possible settings](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/docs/configuration/multi_line_output_modes.html).\n\n## Indentation\n\nTo change the how constant indents appear - simply change the\nindent property with the following accepted formats:\n\n-   Number of spaces you would like. For example: 4 would cause standard\n    4 space indentation.\n-   Tab\n-   A verbatim string with quotes around it.\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\n\"    \"\n```\n\nis equivalent to 4.\n\nFor the import styles that use parentheses, you can control whether or\nnot to include a trailing comma after the last import with the\n`include_trailing_comma` option (defaults to `False`).\n\n## Intelligently Balanced Multi-line Imports\n\nAs of isort 3.1.0 support for balanced multi-line imports has been\nadded. With this enabled isort will dynamically change the import length\nto the one that produces the most balanced grid, while staying below the\nmaximum import length defined.\n\nExample:\n\n```python\nfrom __future__ import (absolute_import, division,\n                        print_function, unicode_literals)\n```\n\nWill be produced instead of:\n\n```python\nfrom __future__ import (absolute_import, division, print_function,\n                        unicode_literals)\n```\n\nTo enable this set `balanced_wrapping` to `True` in your config or pass\nthe `-e` option into the command line utility.\n\n## Custom Sections and Ordering\n\nisort provides configuration options to change almost every aspect of how\nimports are organized, ordered, or grouped together in sections.\n\n[Click here](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/docs/configuration/custom_sections_and_ordering.html) for an overview of all these options.\n\n## Skip processing of imports (outside of configuration)\n\nTo make isort ignore a single import simply add a comment at the end of\nthe import line containing the text `isort:skip`:\n\n```python\nimport module  # isort:skip\n```\n\nor:\n\n```python\nfrom xyz import (abc,  # isort:skip\n                 yo,\n                 hey)\n```\n\nTo make isort skip an entire file simply add `isort:skip_file` to the\nmodule's doc string:\n\n```python\n\"\"\" my_module.py\n    Best module ever\n\n   isort:skip_file\n\"\"\"\n\nimport b\nimport a\n```\n\n## Adding or removing an import from multiple files\n\nisort can be ran or configured to add / remove imports automatically.\n\n[See a complete guide here.](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/docs/configuration/add_or_remove_imports.html)\n\n## Using isort to verify code\n\nThe `--check-only` option\n-------------------------\n\nisort can also be used to verify that code is correctly formatted\nby running it with `-c`. Any files that contain incorrectly sorted\nand/or formatted imports will be outputted to `stderr`.\n\n```bash\nisort **/*.py -c -v\n\nSUCCESS: /home/timothy/Projects/Open_Source/isort/isort_kate_plugin.py Everything Looks Good!\nERROR: /home/timothy/Projects/Open_Source/isort/isort/isort.py Imports are incorrectly sorted.\n```\n\nOne great place this can be used is with a pre-commit git hook, such as\nthis one by \\@acdha:\n\n<https://gist.github.com/acdha/8717683>\n\nThis can help to ensure a certain level of code quality throughout a\nproject.\n\n## Git hook\n\nisort provides a hook function that can be integrated into your Git\npre-commit script to check Python code before committing.\n\n[More info here.](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/docs/configuration/git_hook.html)\n\n## Setuptools integration\n\nUpon installation, isort enables a `setuptools` command that checks\nPython files declared by your project.\n\n[More info here.](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/docs/configuration/setuptools_integration.html)\n\n## Spread the word\n\n[![Imports: isort](https://img.shields.io/badge/%20imports-isort-%231674b1?style=flat&labelColor=ef8336)](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/)\n\nPlace this badge at the top of your repository to let others know your project uses isort.\n\nFor README.md:\n\n```markdown\n[![Imports: isort](https://img.shields.io/badge/%20imports-isort-%231674b1?style=flat&labelColor=ef8336)](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/)\n```\n\nOr README.rst:\n\n```rst\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/badge/%20imports-isort-%231674b1?style=flat&labelColor=ef8336\n    :target: https://pycqa.github.io/isort/\n```\n\n## Security contact information\n\nTo report a security vulnerability, please use the [Tidelift security\ncontact](https://tidelift.com/security). Tidelift will coordinate the\nfix and disclosure.\n\n## Why isort?\n\nisort simply stands for import sort. It was originally called\n\"sortImports\" however I got tired of typing the extra characters and\ncame to the realization camelCase is not pythonic.\n\nI wrote isort because in an organization I used to work in the manager\ncame in one day and decided all code must have alphabetically sorted\nimports. The code base was huge - and he meant for us to do it by hand.\nHowever, being a programmer - I\\'m too lazy to spend 8 hours mindlessly\nperforming a function, but not too lazy to spend 16 hours automating it.\nI was given permission to open source sortImports and here we are :)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Get professionally supported isort with the Tidelift\nSubscription](https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-isort?utm_source=pypi-isort&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=readme)\n\nProfessional support for isort is available as part of the [Tidelift\nSubscription](https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-isort?utm_source=pypi-isort&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=readme).\nTidelift gives software development teams a single source for purchasing\nand maintaining their software, with professional grade assurances from\nthe experts who know it best, while seamlessly integrating with existing\ntools.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThanks and I hope you find isort useful!\n\n~Timothy Crosley\n"
