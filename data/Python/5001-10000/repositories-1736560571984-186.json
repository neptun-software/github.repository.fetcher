          "content": "# Changelog\n\nWe do our best to avoid the introduction of breaking changes,\nbut cannot always guarantee backwards compatibility. Changes that may **break code which uses a previous release of Darts** are marked with a \"🔴\".\n\n## [Unreleased](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/tree/master)\n\n[Full Changelog](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/compare/0.32.0...master)\n\n### For users of the library:\n\n**Improved**\n\n- New model: `StatsForecastAutoTBATS`. This model offers the [AutoTBATS](https://nixtlaverse.nixtla.io/statsforecast/src/core/models.html#autotbats) model from Nixtla's `statsforecasts` library. [#2611](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2611) by [He Weilin](https://github.com/cnhwl).\n- Added the `title` attribute to `TimeSeries.plot()`. This allows to set a title for the plot. [#2639](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2639) by [Jonathan Koch](https://github.com/jonathankoch99).\n- Added parameter `component_wise` to `show_anomalies()` to separately plot each component in multivariate series. [#2544](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2544) by [He Weilin](https://github.com/cnhwl).\n\n**Fixed**\n- Fixed a bug when performing optimized historical forecasts with `stride=1` using a `RegressionModel` with `output_chunk_shift>=1` and `output_chunk_length=1`, where the forecast time index was not properly shifted. [#2634](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2634) by [Mattias De Charleroy](https://github.com/MattiasDC).\n\n**Dependencies**\n\n### For developers of the library:\n\n## [0.32.0](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/tree/0.32.0) (2024-12-21)\n\n### For users of the library:\n\n**Improved**\n\n- 🚀🚀 Introducing Conformal Prediction: You can now add calibrated prediction intervals to any pre-trained global forecasting model with our first two conformal prediction models : [#2552](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2552) by [Dennis Bader](https://github.com/dennisbader).\n  - `ConformalNaiveModel`: Uses past point forecast errors to produce calibrated forecast intervals with a specified coverage probability.\n  - `ConformalQRModel`: Combines quantile regression (or any probabilistic model) with conformal prediction techniques. It adjusts the quantile estimates to generate calibrated prediction intervals with a specified coverage probability.\n  - Both models offer the following support:\n    - identical API as forecasting models\n    - use any pre-trained global forecasting model as the base forecaster\n    - uni and multivariate forecasts\n    - single and multiple series forecasts\n    - single and multi-horizon forecasts\n    - generate a single or multiple calibrated prediction intervals\n    - direct quantile value predictions (interval bounds) or sampled predictions from these quantile values\n    - covariates based on the underlying forecasting model\n  - Check out our [conformal prediction notebook](https://unit8co.github.io/darts/examples/23-Conformal-Prediction-examples.html) for detailed information and usage examples!\n- Improvements to backtesting with `ForecastingModel` (`historical_forecasts()`, `backtest()`, `residuals()`, and `gridsearch()`):\n  - 🚀🚀 Added support for data transformers and pipelines. Use argument `data_transformers` to automatically apply any `DataTransformer` and/or `Pipeline` to the input series without data-leakage (optional fit on historic window of input series, transform the input series, and inverse transform the forecasts). [#2529](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2529) by [Antoine Madrona](https://github.com/madtoinou) and [Jan Fidor](https://github.com/JanFidor)\n  - Improved `start` handling. If `start` is not within the trainable / forecastable points, uses the closest valid start point that is a round multiple of `stride` ahead of start. Raises a ValueError, if no valid start point exists. This guarantees that all historical forecasts are `n * stride` points away from start, and will simplify many downstream tasks. [#2560](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/issues/2560) by [Dennis Bader](https://github.com/dennisbader).\n  - Added support for `overlap_end=True` to `residuals()`. This computes historical forecasts and residuals that can extend further than the end of the target series. Guarantees that all returned residual values have the same length per forecast (the last residuals will contain missing values, if the forecasts extended further into the future than the end of the target series). [#2552](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2552) by [Dennis Bader](https://github.com/dennisbader).\n- Improvements to `metrics`: Added three new quantile interval metrics (plus their aggregated versions) : [#2552](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2552) by [Dennis Bader](https://github.com/dennisbader).\n  - Interval Winkler Score `iws()`, and Mean Interval Winkler Scores `miws()` (time-aggregated) ([source](https://otexts.com/fpp3/distaccuracy.html))\n  - Interval Coverage `ic()` (binary if observation is within the quantile interval), and Mean Interval Coverage `mic()` (time-aggregated)\n  - Interval Non-Conformity Score for Quantile Regression `incs_qr()`, and Mean ... `mincs_qr()` (time-aggregated) ([source](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.03222))\n- Added `series_idx` argument to `DataTransformer` that allows users to use only a subset of the transformers when `global_fit=False` and severals series are used. [#2529](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2529) by [Antoine Madrona](https://github.com/madtoinou)\n- Updated the Documentation URL of `Statsforecast` models. [#2610](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2610) by [He Weilin](https://github.com/cnhwl).\n\n**Fixed**\n\n- Fixed a bug which raised an error when computing residuals (or backtest with \"per time step\" metrics) on multiple series with corresponding historical forecasts of different lengths. [#2604](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2604) by [Dennis Bader](https://github.com/dennisbader).\n- Fixed a bug when using `darts.utils.data.tabularization.create_lagged_component_names()` with target `lags=None`, that did not return any lagged target label component names. [#2576](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2576) by [Dennis Bader](https://github.com/dennisbader).\n- Fixed a bug when using `num_samples > 1` with a deterministic regression model and the optimized `historical_forecasts()` method, which did not raise an exception. [#2576](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2588) by [Antoine Madrona](https://github.com/madtoinou).\n- Fixed a bug when performing optimized historical forecasts with `RegressionModel` and `last_points_only=False`, where the forecast index generation could result in out-of-bound dates. [#2623](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2623) by [Dennis Bader](https://github.com/dennisbader).\n- Fixed the failing docker image deployment. [#2583](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2583) by [Dennis Bader](https://github.com/dennisbader).\n\n**Dependencies**\n\n- 🔴 Removed support for Python 3.8. The new minimum Python version is 3.9. [#2586](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2586) by [Dennis Bader](https://github.com/dennisbader).\n- We set an upper version cap on `sklkearn<=1.5.0` until `xgboost` officially supports version `1.6.0`.  [#2618](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2618) by [Dennis Bader](https://github.com/dennisbader).\n\n### For developers of the library:\n\n**Improved**\n\n- Improvements to CI/CD : [#2584](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2584) by [Dennis Bader](https://github.com/dennisbader).\n  - updated all workflows with most recent GitHub actions versions\n  - improved caching across `master` branch and its children\n  - fixed failing docker deployment\n  - removed `gradle` dependency in favor of native GitHub actions plugins.\n- Updated ruff to v0.7.2 and target-version to python39, also fixed various typos. [#2589](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2589) by [Greg DeVosNouri](https://github.com/gdevos010) and [Antoine Madrona](https://github.com/madtoinou).\n- Replaced the deprecated `torch.nn.utils.weight_norm` function with `torch.nn.utils.parametrizations.weight_norm`. [#2593](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2593) by [Saeed Foroutan](https://github.com/SaeedForoutan).\n\n## [0.31.0](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/tree/0.31.0) (2024-10-13)\n\n### For users of the library:\n\n**Improved**\n\n- Improvements to `metrics`:\n  - Added support for computing metrics on one or multiple quantiles `q`, either from probabilistic or quantile forecasts. [#2530](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2530) by [Dennis Bader](https://github.com/dennisbader).\n  - Added quantile interval metrics `miw` (Mean Interval Width, time aggregated) and `iw` (Interval Width, per time step / non-aggregated) which compute the width of quantile intervals `q_intervals` (expected to be a tuple or sequence of tuples with (lower quantile, upper quantile)). [#2530](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2530) by [Dennis Bader](https://github.com/dennisbader).\n- Improvements to `backtest()` and `residuals()`:\n  - Added support for computing backtest and residuals on one or multiple quantiles `q` in the `metric_kwargs`, either from probabilistic or quantile forecasts. [#2530](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2530) by [Dennis Bader](https://github.com/dennisbader).\n  - Added support for parameters `enable_optimization` and `predict_likelihood_parameters`. [#2530](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2530) by [Dennis Bader](https://github.com/dennisbader).\n- Improvements to `TimeSeries`:\n  - Added support for broadcasting TimeSeries on component and sample level for arithmetic operations. [#2476](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2476) by [Joel L.](https://github.com/Joelius300).\n  - Added property `TimeSeries.shape` to get the shape of the time series. [#2530](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2530) by [Dennis Bader](https://github.com/dennisbader).\n- Other improvements:\n  - Added a new anomaly detector `IQRDetector`, that allows to detect anomalies using the Interquartile Range algorithm. [#2441](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2441) by [Igor Urbanik](https://github.com/u8-igor).\n  - Added hyperparameters `temporal_hidden_size_past/future` controlling the hidden layer sizes for the feature encoders in `TiDEModel`. [#2408](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2408) by [eschibli](https://github.com/eschibli).\n  - Added hyperparameter `activation` to `BlockRNNModel` to specify the activation function in case of a multi-layer output network. [#2504](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2504) by [Szymon Cogiel](https://github.com/SzymonCogiel).\n  - Helper function `darts.utils.utils.generate_index()` now accepts datetime strings as `start` and `end` parameters to generate the pandas DatetimeIndex. [#2522](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2522) by [Dennis Bader](https://github.com/dennisbader).\n- Improvements to the documentation:\n  - Made README's forecasting model support table more colorblind-friendly. [#2433](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2433) by [Jatin Shridhar](https://github.com/jatins).\n  - Updated the Ray Tune Hyperparameter Optimization example in the [user guide](https://unit8co.github.io/darts/userguide/hyperparameter_optimization.html) to work with the latest `ray` versions (`>=2.31.0`). [#2459](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2459) by [He Weilin](https://github.com/cnhwl).\n  - Indicate that `multi_models=False` induce a lags shift for each step in `output_chunk_length` in `RegressionModel` and `LinearRegressionModel`. [#2511](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2511) by [Antoine Madrona](https://github.com/madtoinou).\n  - Added reference to `timeseries_generation.datetime_attribute_timeseries` in `TimeSeries.add_datetime_attribute` (0-indexing of encoding is enforced). [#2511](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2511) by [Antoine Madrona](https://github.com/madtoinou).\n\n**Fixed**\n\n- Fixes to `RegressionModel`:\n  - Fixed a bug when performing probabilistic optimized historical forecasts (`num_samples>1, retrain=False, enable_optimization=True`) with regression models, where reshaping the array resulted in a wrong order of samples across components and forecasts. [#2534](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2534) by [Dennis Bader](https://github.com/dennisbader).\n  - Fixed a bug when predicting with `predict_likelihood_parameters=True`, `n > 1` and a `RegressionModel` with `multi_models=False` that uses a `likelihood`. The prediction now works without raising an exception. [#2545](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2545) by [Dennis Bader](https://github.com/dennisbader).\n  - Fixed a bug when using `historical_forecasts()` with a pre-trained `RegressionModel` that has no target lags `lags=None` but uses static covariates. [#2426](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2426) by [Dennis Bader](https://github.com/dennisbader).\n  - Fixed a bug when using `fit()` with a `RegressionModel` that uses an underlying `model` which does not support `sample_weight`. [#2445](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2445) by [He Weilin](https://github.com/cnhwl).\n  - Fixed a bug when using `save()` and `load()` with a `RegressionEnsembleModel` that ensembles any `TorchForecastingModel`. [#2437](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2437) by [GeorgeXiaojie](https://github.com/GeorgeXiaojie).\n  - Fixed a bug with `xgboost>=2.1.0`, where multi output regression was not properly handled. [#2426](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2426) by [Dennis Bader](https://github.com/dennisbader).\n- Fixes to `TimeSeries`:\n  - Fixed a bug when plotting a probabilistic multivariate series with `TimeSeries.plot()`, where all confidence intervals (starting from 2nd component) had the same color as the median line. [#2532](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2532) by [Dennis Bader](https://github.com/dennisbader).\n  - Fixed a bug when using `TimeSeries.from_group_dataframe()` with a `time_col` of type integer, where the resulting time index was wrongly converted to a DatetimeIndex. [#2512](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2512) by [Alessio Pellegrini](https://github.com/AlessiopSymplectic)\n  - Fixed a bug where passing an empty array to `TimeSeries.prepend/append_values()` raised an error. [#2522](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2522) by [Alessio Pellegrini](https://github.com/AlessiopSymplectic)\n  - Fixed a bug with `TimeSeries.prepend/append_values()`, where the name of the (time) index was lost. [#2522](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2522) by [Alessio Pellegrini](https://github.com/AlessiopSymplectic)\n- Other fixes:\n  - Fixed a bug when using `ShapExplainer.explain()` with some selected `target_components` and a regression model that natively supports multi output regression: The target components were not properly mapped. [#2428](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2428) by [Dennis Bader](https://github.com/dennisbader).\n  - Fixed a bug with `CrostonModel`, which actually does not support future covariates. [#2511](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2511) by [Antoine Madrona](https://github.com/madtoinou).\n  - Fixed the comment of `scorers_are_univariate` in class `AnomalyModel`. [#2452](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2542) by [He Weilin](https://github.com/cnhwl).\n\n**Dependencies**\n\n- Bumped release requirements versions for jupyterlab and dependencies : [#2515](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2515) by [Dennis Bader](https://github.com/dennisbader).\n  - Bumped `ipython` from 8.10.0 to 8.18.1\n  - Bumped `ipykernel` from 5.3.4 to 6.29.5\n  - Bumped `ipywidgets` from 7.5.1 to 8.1.5\n  - Bumped `jupyterlab` from 4.0.11 to 4.2.5\n\n### For developers of the library:\n\n## [0.30.0](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/tree/0.30.0) (2024-06-19)\n\n### For users of the library:\n\n**Improved**\n\n- 🚀🚀 All `GlobalForecastingModel` now support being trained with sample weights (regression-, ensemble-, and neural network models) : [#2404](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2404), [#2410](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2410), [#2417](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2417) and [#2418](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2418) by [Anton Ragot](https://github.com/AntonRagot) and [Dennis Bader](https://github.com/dennisbader).\n  - Added parameters `sample_weight` and `val_sample_weight` to `fit()`, `historical_forecasts()`, `backtest()`, `residuals`, and `gridsearch()` to apply weights to each observation, label (each step in the output chunk), and target component in the training and evaluation set. Supported by both deterministic and probabilistic models. The sample weight can either be `TimeSeries` themselves or built-in weight generators \"linear\" and \"exponential\" decay. In case of a `TimeSeries` it is handled identically as the covariates (e.g. pass multiple weight series with multiple target series, relevant time frame extraction is handled automatically for you, ...). You can find an example [here](https://unit8co.github.io/darts/quickstart/00-quickstart.html#Sample-Weights).\n- 🚀🚀 Improvements to the Anomaly Detection Module through major refactor. The refactor includes major performance optimization for the majority of processes and improvements to the API, consistency, reliability, and the documentation.

An MLP based model that combines temporal, static and cross-sectional feature information using stacked mixing layers. [#2293](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2293), by [Dennis Bader](https://github.com/dennisbader) and [Cristof Rojas](https://github.com/cristof-r).\n- 🚀🚀 Improvements to metrics, historical forecasts, backtest, and residuals through major refactor. The refactor includes optimization of multiple process and improvements to consistency, reliability, and the documentation. Some of these necessary changes come at the cost of breaking changes. [#2284](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2284) by [Dennis Bader](https://github.com/dennisbader).\n  - **Metrics**:\n    - Optimized all metrics, which now run **> n * 20 times faster** than before for series with `n` components/columns. This boosts direct metric computations as well as backtest and residuals computation!\n    - Added new metrics:\n      - Time aggregated metric `merr()` (Mean Error)\n      - Time aggregated scaled metrics  `rmsse()`, and `msse()` : The (Root) Mean Squared Scaled Error.\n      - \"Per time step\" metrics that return a metric score per time step: `err()` (Error), `ae()` (Absolute Error), `se()` (Squared Error), `sle()` (Squared Log Error), `ase()` (Absolute Scaled Error), `sse` (Squared Scaled Error), `ape()` (Absolute Percentage Error), `sape()` (symmetric Absolute Percentage Error), `arre()` (Absolute Ranged Relative Error), `ql` (Quantile Loss)\n    - All scaled metrics (`mase()`, ...) now accept `insample` series that can be overlapping into `pred_series` (before they had to end exactly one step before `pred_series`).  Darts will handle the correct time extraction for you.\n    - Improvements to the documentation:\n      - Added a summary list of all metrics to the [metrics documentation page](https://unit8co.github.io/darts/generated_api/darts.metrics.html)\n      - Standardized the documentation of each metric (added formula, improved return documentation, ...)\n    - 🔴 Breaking changes:\n      - Improved metric output consistency based on the type of input `series`, and the applied reductions. For some scenarios, the output type changed compared to previous Darts versions. You can find a detailed description in the [metric API documentation](https://unit8co.github.io/darts/generated_api/darts.metrics.metrics.html#darts.metrics.metrics.mae).\n      - Renamed metric parameter `reduction` to `component_reduction`.\n      - Renamed metric parameter `inter_reduction` to `series_reduction`.\n      - `quantile_loss()` :\n        - Renamed to `mql()` (Mean Quantile Loss).\n        - Renamed quantile parameter `tau` to `q`.\n        - The metric is now multiplied by a factor `2` to make the loss more interpretable (e.g. for `q=0.5` it is identical to the `MAE`)\n      - `rho_risk()` :\n        - Renamed to `qr()` (Quantile Risk).\n        - Renamed quantile parameter `rho` to `q`.\n      - Scaled metrics do not allow seasonality inference anymore with `m=None`.\n      - Custom metrics using decorators `multi_ts_support` and `multivariate_support` must now act on multivariate series (possibly containing missing values) instead of univariate series.\n  - **Historical Forecasts**:\n    - 🔴 Improved historical forecasts output consistency based on the type of input `series` : If `series` is a sequence, historical forecasts will now always return a sequence/list of the same length (instead of trying to reduce to a `TimeSeries` object). You can find a detailed description in the [historical forecasts API documentation](https://unit8co.github.io/darts/generated_api/darts.models.forecasting.linear_regression_model.html#darts.models.forecasting.linear_regression_model.LinearRegressionModel.historical_forecasts).\n  - **Backtest**:\n    - Metrics are now computed only once on all `series` and `historical_forecasts`, significantly speeding things up when using a large number of `series`.\n    - Added support for scaled metrics as `metric` (such as `ase`, `mase`, ...). No extra code required, backtest extracts the correct `insample` series for you.\n    - Added support for passing additional metric (-specific) arguments with parameter `metric_kwargs`. This allows for example to parallelize the metric computation with `n_jobs`, customize the metric reduction with `*_reduction`, specify seasonality `m` for scaled metrics, etc.\n    - 🔴 Breaking changes:\n      - Improved backtest output consistency based on the type of input `series`, `historical_forecast`, and the applied backtest reduction. For some scenarios, the output type changed compared to previous Darts versions. You can find a detailed description in the [backtest API documentation](https://unit8co.github.io/darts/generated_api/darts.models.forecasting.linear_regression_model.html#darts.models.forecasting.linear_regression_model.LinearRegressionModel.backtest).\n      - `reduction` callable now acts on `axis=1` rather than `axis=0` to aggregate the metrics per series.\n      - Backtest will now raise an error when user supplied `historical_forecasts` don't have the expected format based on input `series` and the `last_points_only` value.\n  - **Residuals**: While the default behavior of `residuals()` remains identical, the method is now very similar to `backtest()` but that it computes any \"per time step\" `metric` on `historical_forecasts` :\n    - Added support for multivariate `series`.\n    - Added support for all `historical_forecasts()` parameters to generate the historical forecasts for the residuals computation.\n    - Added support for pre-computed historical forecasts with parameter `historical_forecasts`.\n    - Added support for computing the residuals with any of Darts' \"per time step\" metric with parameter `metric` (e.g. `err()`, `ae()`, `ape()`, ...). By default, uses `err()` (Error).\n    - Added support for passing additional metric arguments with parameter `metric_kwargs`. This allows for example to parallelize the metric computation with `n_jobs`, specify seasonality `m` for scaled metrics, etc.\n    - 🔴 Improved residuals output and consistency based on the type of input `series` and `historical_forecast`. For some scenarios, the output type changed compared to previous Darts versions. You can find a detailed description in the [residuals API documentation](https://unit8co.github.io/darts/generated_api/darts.models.forecasting.linear_regression_model.html#darts.models.forecasting.linear_regression_model.LinearRegressionModel.residuals).\n- Improvements to `TimeSeries` :\n  - `from_group_dataframe()` now supports parallelized creation over the `pandas.DataFrame` groups.

[#2284](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2284) by [Dennis Bader](https://github.com/dennisbader).\n  - Performance boost for methods: `slice_intersect()`, `has_same_time_as()`. [#2284](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2284) by [Dennis Bader](https://github.com/dennisbader).\n- Improvements to forecasting models:\n  - Improvements to `RNNModel`, [#2329](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2329) by [Dennis Bader](https://github.com/dennisbader):\n    - 🔴 Enforce `training_length>input_chunk_length` since otherwise, during training the model is never run for as many iterations as it will during prediction.\n    - Historical forecasts now correctly infer all possible prediction start points for untrained and pre-trained `RNNModel`.\n  - Added a progress bar to `RegressionModel` when performing optimized historical forecasts (`retrain=False` and no autoregression) to display the series-level progress. [#2320](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2320) by [Dennis Bader](https://github.com/dennisbader).\n  - Renamed private `ForecastingModel._is_probabilistic` property to public `supports_probabilistic_prediction`. [#2269](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2269) by [Felix Divo](https://github.com/felixdivo).\n- Other improvements:\n  - All `InvertibleDataTransformer` now supports parallelized inverse transformation for `series` being a list of lists of `TimeSeries` (`Sequence[Sequence[TimeSeries]]`). This type represents the output of `historical_forecasts()` when using multiple series with `last_points_only=False`. [#2267](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2267) by [Alicja Krzeminska-Sciga](https://github.com/alicjakrzeminska).\n  - Added [release notes](https://unit8co.github.io/darts/release_notes/RELEASE_NOTES.html) to the Darts Documentation. [#2333](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2333) by [Dennis Bader](https://github.com/dennisbader).\n  - 🔴 Moved around utils functions to clearly separate Darts-specific from non-Darts-specific logic, [#2284](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2284) by [Dennis Bader](https://github.com/dennisbader):\n    - Moved function `generate_index()` from `darts.utils.timeseries_generation` to `darts.utils.utils`\n    - Moved functions `retain_period_common_to_all()`, `series2seq()`, `seq2series()`, `get_single_series()` from `darts.utils.utils` to `darts.utils.ts_utils`.\n\n**Fixed**\n\n- Fixed the order of the features when using component-specific lags so that they are grouped by values, then by components (before, they were grouped by components, then by values). [#2272](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2272) by [Antoine Madrona](https://github.com/madtoinou).\n- Fixed a bug when using a dropout with a `TorchForecastingModel` and pytorch lightning versions >= 2.2.0, where the dropout was not properly activated during training.

[#2329](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2329) by [Dennis Bader](https://github.com/dennisbader).\n- Fixed a bug in `quantile_loss`, where the loss was computed on all samples rather than only on the predicted quantiles. [#2284](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2284) by [Dennis Bader](https://github.com/dennisbader).\n- Fixed a segmentation fault that some users were facing when importing a `LightGBMModel`. [#2304](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2304) by [Dennis Bader](https://github.com/dennisbader).\n- Fixed type hint warning \"Unexpected argument\" when calling `historical_forecasts()` caused by the `_with_sanity_checks` decorator. The type hinting is now properly configured to expect any input arguments and return the output type of the method for which the sanity checks are performed for. [#2286](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2286) by [Dennis Bader](https://github.com/dennisbader).\n\n### For developers of the library:\n\n- Fixed failing docs build by adding new dependency `lxml_html_clean` for `nbsphinx`.

This will shift the output chunk for training and prediction by `output_chunk_shift` steps into the future. [#2176](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2176) by [Dennis Bader](https://github.com/dennisbader).\n- Improvements to `TimeSeries`, [#2196](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2196) by [Dennis Bader](https://github.com/dennisbader):\n  - 🚀🚀🚀 Significant performance boosts for several `TimeSeries` methods resulting increased efficiency across the entire `Darts` library. Up to 2x faster creation times for series indexed with \"regular\" frequencies (e.g. Daily, hourly, ...), and >100x for series indexed with \"special\" frequencies (e.g. \"W-MON\", ...). Affects:\n    - All `TimeSeries` creation methods\n    - Additional boosts for slicing with integers and Timestamps\n    - Additional boosts for `from_group_dataframe()` by performing some of the heavy-duty computations on the entire DataFrame, rather than iteratively on the group level.\n  - Added option to exclude some `group_cols` from being added as static covariates when using `TimeSeries.from_group_dataframe()` with parameter `drop_group_cols`.\n- 🚀 New global baseline models that use fixed input and output chunks for prediction. This offers support for univariate, multivariate, single and multiple target series prediction, one-shot- or autoregressive/moving forecasts, optimized historical forecasts, batch prediction, prediction from datasets, and more. [#2261](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2261) by [Dennis Bader](https://github.com/dennisbader).\n  - `GlobalNaiveAggregate` : Computes an aggregate (using a custom or built-in `torch` function) for each target component over the last `input_chunk_length` points, and repeats the values `output_chunk_length` times for prediction. Depending on the parameters, this model can be equivalent to `NaiveMean` and `NaiveMovingAverage`.\n  - `GlobalNaiveDrift` : Takes the slope of each target component over the last `input_chunk_length` points and projects the trend over the next `output_chunk_length` points for prediction. Depending on the parameters, this model can be equivalent to `NaiveDrift`.\n  - `GlobalNaiveSeasonal` : Takes the target component value at the `input_chunk_length`th point before the end of the target `series`, and repeats the values `output_chunk_length` times for prediction. Depending on the parameters, this model can be equivalent to `NaiveSeasonal`.\n- Improvements to `TorchForecastingModel` :\n  - Added support for additional lr scheduler configuration parameters for more control (\"interval\", \"frequency\", \"monitor\", \"strict\", \"name\"). [#2218](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2218) by [Dennis Bader](https://github.com/dennisbader).\n- Improvements to `RegressionModel`, [#2246](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2246) by [Antoine Madrona](https://github.com/madtoinou):\n  - Added a `get_estimator()` method to access the underlying estimator\n  - Added attribute `lagged_label_names` to identify the forecasted step and component of each estimator\n  - Updated the docstring of `get_multioutout_estimator()`\n- Other improvements:\n  - Added argument `keep_names` to `WindowTransformer` and `window_transform` to indicate whether the original component names should be kept. [#2207](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2207) by [Antoine Madrona](https://github.com/madtoinou).\n  - Added new helper function `darts.utils.utils.n_steps_between()` to efficiently compute the number of time steps (periods) between two points with a given frequency. Improves efficiency for regression model tabularization by avoiding `pd.date_range()`. [#2176](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/2176) by [Dennis Bader](https://github.com/dennisbader).\n  - 🔴 Changed the default `start` value in `ForecastingModel.gridsearch()` from `0.5` to `None`, to make it consistent with `historical_forecasts` and other methods.

This means that many more features are now available\n  via PyTorch Lightning trainers functionalities; such as tailored callbacks, or multi-GPU training.\n  [#702](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/702) by [Dennis Bader](https://github.com/dennisbader).\n- The `RegressionModel`s now accept an `output_chunk_length` parameter; meaning that they can be trained to\n  predict more than one time step in advance (and used auto-regressively to predict on longer horizons).\n  [#761](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/761) by [Dustin Brunner](https://github.com/brunnedu).\n- 🔴 `TimeSeries` \"simple statistics\" methods (such as `mean()`, `max()`, `min()` etc, ...) have been refactored\n  to work natively on stochastic `TimeSeries`, and over configurable axes. [#773](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/773)\n  by [Gian Wiher](https://github.com/gnwhr).\n- 🔴 `TimeSeries` now support only pandas `RangeIndex` as an integer index, and does not support `Int64Index` anymore,\n  as it became deprecated with pandas 1.4.0. This also now brings the guarantee that `TimeSeries` do not have missing\n  \"dates\" even when indexed with integers. [#777](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/777)\n  by [Julien Herzen](https://github.com/hrzn).\n- New model: `KalmanForecaster` is a new probabilistic model, working on multivariate series, accepting future covariates,\n  and which works by running the state-space model of a given Kalman filter into the future. The `fit()` function uses the\n  N4SID algorithm for system identification. [#743](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/743)\n  by [Julien Herzen](https://github.com/hrzn).\n- The `KalmanFilter` now also works on `TimeSeries` containing missing values. [#743](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/743)\n  by [Julien Herzen](https://github.com/hrzn).\n- The estimators (forecasting and filtering models) now also return their own instance when calling `fit()`,\n  which allows chaining calls. [#741](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/741)\n  by [Julien Herzen](https://github.com/hrzn).\n\n**Fixed**\n\n- Fixed an issue with tensorboard and gridsearch when `model_name` is provided.\n  [#760](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/760) by [@gdevos010](https://github.com/gdevos010).\n- Fixed issues with pip-tools. [#762](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/762)\n  by [Tomas Van Pottelbergh](https://github.com/tomasvanpottelbergh).\n\n### For developers of the library:\n\n- Some linting checks have been added to the CI pipeline. [#749](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/749)\n  by [Tomas Van Pottelbergh](https://github.com/tomasvanpottelbergh).\n\n## [0.16.1](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/tree/0.16.1) (2022-01-24)\n\nPatch release\n\n### For users of the library:\n\n- Fixed an incompatibility with latest version of Pandas ([#752](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/752))\n  by [Julien Herzen](https://github.com/hrzn).\n- Fixed non contiguous error when using lstm_layers > 1 on GPU. ([#740](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/740))\n  by [Dennis Bader](https://github.com/dennisbader).\n- Small improvement in type annotations in API documentation ([#744](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/744))\n  by [Dustin Brunner](https://github.com/brunnedu).\n\n### For developers of the library:\n\n- Added flake8 tests to CI pipelines ([#749](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/749),\n  [#748](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/748), [#745](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/745))\n  by [Tomas Van Pottelbergh](https://github.com/tomasvanpottelbergh)\n  and [Dennis Bader](https://github.com/dennisbader).\n\n## [0.16.0](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/tree/0.16.0) (2022-01-13)\n\n### For users of the library:\n\n**Improved**\n\n- The [documentation page](https://unit8co.github.io/darts/index.html) has been revamped and now contains\n  a brand new Quickstart guide, as well as a User Guide section, which will be populated over time.\n- The [API documentation](https://unit8co.github.io/darts/generated_api/darts.html) has been revamped and improved,\n  notably using `numpydoc`.\n- The datasets building procedure has been improved in `RegressionModel`, which yields dramatic speed improvements.\n\n**Added**\n\n- The `KalmanFilter` can now do system identification using `fit()` (using [nfoursid](https://github.com/spmvg/nfoursid)).\n\n**Fixed**\n\n- Catch a [potentially problematic case](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/issues/724) in ensemble models.\n- Fixed support for `ReduceLROnPlateau` scheduler.\n\n### For developers of the library:\n\n- We have switched to [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for code formatting (this is checked\n  by the CI pipeline).\n\n## [0.15.0](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/tree/0.15.0) (2021-12-24)\n\n### For users of the library:\n\n**Added**:\n\n- On-the-fly encoding of position and calendar information in Torch-based models.\n  Torch-based models now accept an option `add_encoders` parameter, specifying how to\n  use certain calendar and position information as past and/or future covariates on the-fly.\n\n  Example:\n\n  ```\n  from darts.dataprocessing.transformers import Scaler\n  add_encoders={\n      'cyclic': {'future': ['month']},\n      'datetime_attribute': {'past': ['hour', 'dayofweek']},\n      'position': {'past': ['absolute'], 'future': ['relative']},\n      'custom': {'past': [lambda idx: (idx.year - 1950) / 50]},\n      'transformer': Scaler()\n  }\n  ```\n\n  This will add a cyclic encoding of the month as future covariates, add some datetime\n  attributes as past and future covariates, an absolute/relative position (index), and\n  even some custom mapping of the index (such as a function of the year). A `Scaler` will\n  be applied to fit/transform all of these covariates both during training and inference.\n- The scalers can now also be applied on stochastic `TimeSeries`.\n- There is now a new argument `max_samples_per_ts` to the :func:`fit()` method of Torch-based\n  models, which can be used to limit the number of samples contained in the underlying\n  training dataset, by taking (at most) the most recent `max_samples_per_ts` training samples\n  per time series.\n- All local forecasting models that support covariates (Prophet, ARIMA, VARIMA, AutoARIMA)\n  now handle covariate slicing themselves; this means that you don't need to make sure your\n  covariates have the exact right time span. As long as they contain the right time span, the\n  models will slice them for you.\n- `TimeSeries.map()` and mappers data transformers now work on stochastic `TimeSeries`.\n- Granger causality function: `utils.statistics.granger_causality_tests` can test if one\n  univariate `TimeSeries` \"granger causes\" another.\n- New stationarity tests for univariate `TimeSeries` : `darts.utils.statistics.stationarity_tests`,\n  `darts.utils.statistics.stationarity_test_adf` and `darts.utils.statistics.stationarity_test_kpss`.\n- New test coverage badge 🦄\n\n**Fixed**:\n\n- Fixed various issues in different notebooks.\n- Fixed a bug handling frequencies in Prophet model.\n- Fixed an issue causing `PastCovariatesTorchModels` (such as `NBEATSModel`) prediction\n  to fail when `n > output_chunk_length` AND `n` not being a multiple of `output_chunk_length`.\n- Fixed an issue in backtesting which was causing untrained models\n  not to be trained on the initial window when `retrain=False`.\n- Fixed an issue causing `residuals()` to fail for Torch-based models.\n\n### For developers of the library:\n\n- Updated the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- The unit tests have been re-organised with submodules following that of the library.\n- All relative import paths have been removed and replaced by absolute paths.\n- pytest and pytest-cov are now used to run tests and compute coverage.\n\n## [0.14.0](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/tree/0.14.0) (2021-11-28)\n\n### For users of the library:\n\n**Added**:\n\n- Probabilistic N-BEATS: The `NBEATSModel` can now produce probabilistic forecasts,\n  in a similar way as all the other deep learning models in Darts (specifying a `likelihood`\n  and predicting with `num_samples` >> 1).\n- We have improved the speed of the data loaing functionalities for PyTorch-based models.\n  This should speedup training, typically by a few percents.\n- Added `num_loader_workers` parameters to `fit()` and `predict()` methods of PyTorch-based models,\n  in order to control the `num_workers` of PyTorch DataLoaders. This can sometimes result in drastic speedups.\n- New method `TimeSeries.astype()` which allows to easily case (e.g. between `np.float64` and `np.float32`).\n- Added `dtype` as an option to the time series generation modules.\n- Added a small [performance guide](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/blob/master/guides/performance.md) for\n  PyTorch-based models.\n- Possibility to specify a (relative) time index to be used as future covariates in the TFT Model.\n  Future covariates don't have to be specified when this is used.\n- New TFT example notebook.\n- Less strict dependencies: we have loosened the required dependencies versions.\n\n**Fixed**:\n\n- A small fix on the Temporal Fusion Transformer `TFTModel`, which should improve performance.\n- A small fix in the random state of some unit tests.\n- Fixed a typo in Transformer example notebook.\n\n## [0.13.1](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/tree/0.13.1) (2021-11-08)\n\n### For users of the library:\n\n**Added**:\n\n- Factory methods in `TimeSeries` are now `classmethods`, which makes inheritance of\n  `TimeSeries` more convenient.\n\n**Fixed**:\n\n- An issue which was causing some of the flavours installations not to work\n\n## [0.13.0](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/tree/0.13.0) (2021-11-07)\n\n### For users of the library:\n\n**Added**:\n\n- New forecasting model, [Temporal Fusion Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.09363) (`TFTModel`).\n  A new deep learning model supporting both past and future covariates.\n- Improved support for Facebook Prophet model (`Prophet`):\n  - Added support for fit & predict with future covariates. For instance:\n    `model.fit(train, future_covariates=train_covariates)` and\n    `model.predict(n=len(test), num_sample=1, future_covariates=test_covariates)`\n  - Added stochastic forecasting, for instance: `model.predict(n=len(test), num_samples=200)`\n  - Added user-defined seasonalities either at model creation with kwarg\n    `add_seasonality` (`Prophet(add_seasonality=kwargs_dict)`) or pre-fit with\n    `model.add_seasonality(kwargs)`. For more information on how to add seasonalities,\n    see the [Prophet docs](https://unit8co.github.io/darts/generated_api/darts.models.forecasting.prophet.html).\n  - Added possibility to predict and return the base model's raw output with `model.predict_raw()`.\n    Note that this returns a pd.DataFrame `pred_df`, which will not be supported for further\n    processing with the Darts API. But it is possible to access Prophet's methods such as\n    plots with `model.model.plot_compenents(pred_df)`.\n- New `n_random_samples` in `gridsearch()` method, which allows to specify a number of (random)\n  hyper parameters combinations to be tried, in order mainly to limit the gridsearch time.\n- Improvements in the checkpointing and saving of Torch models.\n  - Now models don't save checkpoints by default anymore. Set `save_checkpoints=True` to enable them.\n  - Models can be manually saved with `YourTorchModel.save_model(file_path)`\n    (file_path pointing to the .pth.tar file).\n  - Models can be manually loaded with `YourTorchModel.load_model(file_path)` or\n    the original method `YourTorchModel.load_from_checkpoint()`.\n- New `QuantileRegression` Likelihood class in `darts.utils.likelihood_models`.\n  Allows to apply quantile regression loss, and get probabilistic forecasts on all deep\n  learning models supporting likelihoods.\n  Used by default in the Temporal Fusion Transformer.\n\n**Fixed:**\n\n- Some issues with `darts.concatenate()`.\n- Fixed some bugs with `RegressionModel`s applied on multivariate series.\n- An issue with the confidence bounds computation in ACF plot.\n- Added a check for some models that do not support `retrain=False` for `historical_forecasts()`.\n- Small fixes in install instructions.\n- Some rendering issues with bullet points lists in examples.\n\n## [0.12.0](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/tree/0.12.0) (2021-09-25)\n\n### For users of the library:\n\n**Added**:\n\n- Improved probabilistic forecasting with neural networks\n  - Now all neural networks based forecasting models (except `NBEATSModel`) support probabilistic forecasting,\n    by providing the `likelihood` parameter to the model's constructor method.\n  - `darts.utils.likelihood_models` now contains many more distributions. The complete list of likelihoods\n    available to train neural networks based models is\n    available here: https://unit8co.github.io/darts/generated_api/darts.utils.likelihood_models.html\n  - Many of the available likelihood models now offer the possibility to specify \"priors\" on the distribution's\n    parameters. Specifying such priors will regularize the training loss to make the output distribution\n    more like the one specified by the prior parameters values.\n- Performance improvements on `TimeSeries` creation. creating `TimeSeries` is now be significantly faster,\n  especially for large series, and filling missing dates has also been significantly sped up.\n- New rho-risk metric for probabilistic forecasts.\n- New method `darts.utils.statistics.plot_hist()` to plot histograms of time series data (e.g. backtest errors).\n- New argument `fillna_value` to `TimeSeries` factory methods, allowing to specify a value to fill missing dates\n  (instead of `np.nan`).\n- Synthetic `TimeSeries` generated with `darts.utils.timeseries_generation` methods can now be integer-index\n  (just pass an integer instead of a timestamp for the `start` argument).\n- Removed some deprecation warnings\n- Updated conda installation instructions\n\n**Fixed:**\n\n- Removed [extra 1x1 convolutions](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/471) in TCN Model.\n- Fixed an issue with linewidth parameter when plotting `TimeSeries`.\n- Fixed a column name issue in datetime attribute time series.\n\n### For developers of the library:\n\n- We have removed the `develop` branch.\n- We force sklearn<1.0 has we have observed issues with pmdarima and sklearn==1.0\n\n## [0.11.0](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/tree/0.11.0) (2021-09-04)\n\n### For users of the library:\n\n**Added:**\n\n- New model: `LightGBMModel` is a new regression model. Regression models allow to predict future values\n  of the target, given arbitrary lags of the target as well as past and/or future covariates. `RegressionModel`\n  already works with any scikit-learn regression model, and now `LightGBMModel` does the same with LightGBM.\n  If you want to activate LightGBM support in Darts, please read the detailed install notes on\n  the [README](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/blob/master/README.md) carefully.\n- Added stride support to gridsearch\n\n**Fixed:**\n\n- A bug which was causing issues when training on a GPU with a validation set\n- Some issues with custom-provided RNN modules in `RNNModel`.\n- Properly handle `kwargs` in the `fit` function of `RegressionModel`s.\n- Fixed an issue which was causing problems with latest versions of Matplotlib.\n- An issue causing errors in the FFT notebook\n\n## [0.10.1](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/tree/0.10.1) (2021-08-19)\n\n### For users of the library:\n\n**Fixed:**\n\n- A bug with memory pinning that was causing issues with training models on GPUs.\n\n**Changed:**\n\n- Clarified conda support on the README\n\n## [0.10.0](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/tree/0.10.0) (2021-08-13)\n\n### For users of the library:\n\n**Added:**\n\n- 🔴 Improvement of the covariates support. Before, some models were accepting a `covariates` (or `exog`)\n  argument, but it wasn't always clear whether this represented \"past-observed\" or \"future-known\" covariates.\n  We have made this clearer. Now all covariate-aware models support `past_covariates` and/or `future_covariates` argument\n  in their `fit()` and `predict()` methods, which makes it clear what series is used as a past or future covariate.\n  We recommend [this article](https://medium.com/unit8-machine-learning-publication/time-series-forecasting-using-past-and-future-external-data-with-darts-1f0539585993)\n  for more information and examples.\n- 🔴 Significant improvement of `RegressionModel` (incl. `LinearRegressionModel` and `RandomForest`).\n  These models now support training on multiple (possibly multivariate) time series. They also support both\n  `past_covariates` and `future_covariates`. It makes it easier than ever to fit arbitrary regression models (e.g. from\n  scikit-learn) on multiple series, to predict the future of a target series based on arbitrary lags of the target and\n  the past/future covariates. The signature of these models changed: It's not using \"`exog`\" keyword arguments, but\n  `past_covariates` and `future_covariates` instead.\n- Dynamic Time Warping. There is a brand new `darts.dataprocessing.dtw` submodule that\n  implements Dynamic Time Warping between two `TimeSeries`. It's also coming with a new `dtw`\n  metric in `darts.metrics`. We recommend going over the\n  [new DTW example notebook](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/blob/master/examples/13-Dynamic-Time-Warping-example.ipynb)\n  for a good overview of the new functionalities\n- Conda forge installation support (fully supported with Python 3.7 only for now). You can now\n  `conda install u8darts-all`.\n- `TimeSeries.from_csv()` allows to obtain a `TimeSeries` from a CSV file directly.\n- Optional cyclic encoding of the datetime attributes future covariates; for instance it's now possible to call\n  `my_series.add_datetime_attribute('weekday', cyclic=True)`, which will add two columns containing a sin/cos\n  encoding of the weekday.\n- Default seasonality inference in `ExponentialSmoothing`. If left to `None`, the `seasonal_periods` is inferred\n  from the `freq` of the provided series.\n- Various documentation improvements.\n\n**Fixed:**\n\n- Now transformations and forecasting maintain the columns' names of the `TimeSeries`.\n  The generation module `darts.utils.timeseries_generation` also comes with better default columns names.\n- Some issues with our Docker build process\n- A bug with GPU usage\n\n**Changed:**\n\n- For probabilistic PyTorch based models, the generation of multiple samples (and series) at prediction time is now\n  vectorized, which improves inference performance.\n\n## [0.9.1](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/tree/0.9.1) (2021-07-17)\n\n### For users of the library:\n\n**Added:**\n\n- Improved `GaussianProcessFilter`, now handling missing values, and better handling\n  time series indexed by datetimes.\n- Improved Gaussian Process notebook.\n\n**Fixed:**\n\n- `TimeSeries` now supports indexing using `pandas.Int64Index` and not just `pandas.RangeIndex`,\n  which solves some indexing issues.\n- We have changed all factory methods of `TimeSeries` to have `fill_missing_dates=False` by\n  default. This is because in some cases inferring the frequency for missing dates and\n  resampling the series is causing significant performance overhead.\n- Fixed backtesting to make it work with integer-indexed series.\n- Fixed a bug that was causing inference to crash on GPUs for some models.\n- Fixed the default folder name, which was causing issues on Windows systems.\n- We have slightly improved the documentation rendering and fixed the titles\n  of the documentation pages for `RNNModel` and `BlockRNNModel` to distinguish them.\n\n**Changed:**\n\n- The dependencies are not pinned to some exact versions anymore.\n\n### For developers of the library:\n\n- We have fixed the building process.\n\n## [0.9.0](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/tree/0.9.0) (2021-07-09)\n\n### For users of the library:\n\n**Added:**\n\n- Multiple forecasting models can now produce probabilistic forecasts by specifying a `num_samples` parameter when calling `predict()`. Stochastic forecasts are stored by utilizing the new `samples` dimension in the refactored `TimeSeries` class (see 'Changed' section). Models supporting probabilistic predictions so far are `ARIMA`, `ExponentialSmoothing`, `RNNModel` and `TCNModel`.\n- Introduced `LikelihoodModel` class which is used by probabilistic `TorchForecastingModel` classes in order to make predictions in the form of parametrized distributions of different types.\n- Added new abstract class `TorchParametricProbabilisticForecastingModel` to serve as parent class for probabilistic models.\n- Introduced new `FilteringModel` abstract class alongside `MovingAverage`, `KalmanFilter` and `GaussianProcessFilter` as concrete implementations.\n- Future covariates are now utilized by `TorchForecastingModels` when the forecasting horizon exceeds the `output_chunk_length` of the model. Before, `TorchForecastingModel` instances could only predict beyond their `output_chunk_length` if they were not trained on covariates, i.e. if they predicted all the data they need as input. This restriction has now been lifted by letting a model not only consume its own output when producing long predictions, but also utilizing the covariates known in the future, if available.\n- Added a new `RNNModel` class which utilizes and rnn module as both encoder and decoder. This new class natively supports the use of the most recent future covariates when making a forecast. See documentation for more details.\n- Introduced optional `epochs` parameter to the `TorchForecastingModel.predict()` method which, if provided, overrides the `n_epochs` attribute in that particular model instance and training session.\n- Added support for `TimeSeries` with a `pandas.RangeIndex` instead of just allowing `pandas.DatetimeIndex`.\n- `ForecastingModel.gridsearch` now makes use of parallel computation.\n- Introduced a new `force_reset` parameter to `TorchForecastingModel.__init__()` which, if left to False, will prevent the user from overriding model data with the same name and directory.\n\n**Fixed:**\n\n- Solved bug occurring when training `NBEATSModel` on a GPU.\n- Fixed crash when running `NBEATSModel` with `log_tensorboard=True`\n- Solved bug occurring when training a `TorchForecastingModel` instance with a `batch_size` bigger than the available number of training samples.\n- Some fixes in the documentation, including adding more details\n- Other minor bug fixes\n\n**Changed:**\n\n- 🔴 The `TimeSeries` class has been refactored to support stochastic time series representation by adding an additional dimension to a time series, namely `samples`. A time series is now based on a 3-dimensional `xarray.DataArray` with shape `(n_timesteps, n_components, n_samples)`. This overhaul also includes a change of the constructor which is incompatible with the old one. However, factory methods have been added to create a `TimeSeries` instance from a variety of data types, including `pd.DataFrame`. Please refer to the documentation of `TimeSeries` for more information.\n- 🔴 The old version of `RNNModel` has been renamed to `BlockRNNModel`.\n- The `historical_forecast()` and `backtest()` methods of `ForecastingModel` have been reorganized a bit by making use of new wrapper methods to fit and predict models.\n- Updated `README.md` to reflect the new additions to the library.\n\n## [0.8.1](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/tree/0.8.1) (2021-05-22)\n\n**Fixed:**\n\n- Some fixes in the documentation\n\n**Changed:**\n\n- The way to instantiate Dataset classes; datasets should now be used like this\n\n```\nfrom darts.datasets import AirPassengers\nts: TimeSeries = AirPassengers().load()\n```\n\n## [0.8.0](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/tree/0.8.0) (2021-05-21)\n\n### For users of the library:\n\n**Added:**\n\n- `RandomForest` algorithm implemented. Uses the scikit-learn `RandomForestRegressor` to predict future values from (lagged) exogenous\n  variables and lagged values of the target.\n- `darts.datasets` is a new submodule allowing to easily download, cache and import some commonly used time series.\n- Better support for processing sequences of `TimeSeries`.\n  * The Transformers, Pipelines and metrics have been adapted to be used on sequences of `TimeSeries`\n    (rather than isolated series).\n  * The inference of neural networks on sequences of series has been improved\n- There is a new utils function `darts.utils.model_selection.train_test_split` which allows to split a `TimeSeries`\n  or a sequence of `TimeSeries` into train and test sets; either along the sample axis or along the time axis.\n  It also optionally allows to do \"model-aware\" splitting, where the split reclaims as much data as possible for the\n  training set.\n- Our implementation of N-BEATS, `NBEATSModel`, now supports multivariate time series, as well as covariates.\n\n**Changed**\n\n- `RegressionModel` is now a user exposed class. It acts as a wrapper around any regression model with a `fit()` and `predict()`\n  method. It enables the flexible usage of lagged values of the target variable as well as lagged values of multiple exogenous\n  variables. Allowed values for the `lags` argument are positive integers or a list of positive integers indicating which lags\n  should be used during training and prediction, e.g. `lags=12` translates to training with the last 12 lagged values of the target variable.\n  `lags=[1, 4, 8, 12]` translates to training with the previous value, the value at lag 4, lag 8 and lag 12.\n- 🔴 `StandardRegressionModel` is now called `LinearRegressionModel`. It implements a linear regression model\n  from `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression`. Users who still need to use the former `StandardRegressionModel` with\n  another sklearn model should use the `RegressionModel` now.\n\n**Fixed**\n\n- We have fixed a bug arising when multiple scalers were used.\n- We have fixed a small issue in the TCN architecture, which makes our implementation follow the original paper\n  more closely.\n\n### For developers of the library:\n\n**Added:**\n\n- We have added some [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/blob/master/CONTRIBUTE.md).\n\n## [0.7.0](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/tree/0.7.0) (2021-04-14)\n\n[Full Changelog](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/compare/0.6.0...0.7.0)\n\n### For users of the library:\n\n**Added:**\n\n- `darts` Pypi package. It is now possible to `pip install darts`. The older name `u8darts` is still maintained\n  and provides the different flavours for lighter installs.\n- New forecasting model available: VARIMA (Vector Autoregressive moving average).\n- Support for exogeneous variables in ARIMA, AutoARIMA and VARIMA (optional `exog` parameter in `fit()` and `predict()`\n  methods).\n- New argument `dummy_index` for `TimeSeries` creation. If a series is just composed of a sequence of numbers\n  without timestamps, setting this flag will allow to create a `TimeSeries` which uses a \"dummy time index\" behind the\n  scenes. This simplifies the creation of `TimeSeries` in such cases, and makes it possible to use all forecasting models,\n  except those that explicitly rely on dates.\n- New method `TimeSeries.diff()` returning differenced `TimeSeries`.\n- Added an example of `RegressionEnsembleModel` in intro notebook.\n\n**Changed:**\n\n- Improved N-BEATS example notebook.\n- Methods `TimeSeries.split_before()` and `split_after()` now also accept integer or float arguments (in addition to\n  timestamp) for the breaking point (e.g. specify 0.8 in order to obtain a 80%/20% split).\n- Argument `value_cols` no longer has to be provided if not necessary when creating a `TimeSeries` from a `DataFrame`.\n- Update of dependency requirements to more recent versions.\n\n**Fixed:**\n\n- Fix issue with MAX_TORCH_SEED_VALUE on 32-bit architectures (https://github.com/unit8co/darts/issues/235).\n- Corrected a bug in TCN inference, which should improve accuracy.\n- Fix historical forecasts not returning last point.\n- Fixed bug when calling the `TimeSeries.gaps()` function for non-regular time frequencies.\n- Many small bug fixes.\n\n## [0.6.0](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/tree/0.6.0) (2021-02-02)\n\n[Full Changelog](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/compare/0.5.0...0.6.0)\n\n### For users of the library:\n\n**Added:**\n\n- `Pipeline.invertible()` a getter which returns whether the pipeline is invertible or not.\n- `TimeSeries.to_json()` and `TimeSeries.from_json()` methods to convert `TimeSeries` to/from a `JSON` string.\n- New base class `GlobalForecastingModel` for all models supporting training on multiple time series, as well\n  as covariates. All PyTorch models are now `GlobalForecastingModel`s.\n- As a consequence of the above, the `fit()` function of PyTorch models (all neural networks) can optionally be called\n  with a sequence of time series (instead of a single time series).\n- Similarly, the `predict()` function of these models also accepts a specification of which series should be forecasted\n- A new `TrainingDataset` base class.\n- Some implementations of `TrainingDataset` containing some slicing logic for the training of neural networks on\n  several time series.\n- A new `TimeSeriesInferenceDataset` base class.\n- An implementation `SimpleInferenceDataset` of `TimeSeriesInferenceDataset`.\n- All PyTorch models have a new `fit_from_dataset()` method which allows to directly fit the model from a specified\n  `TrainingDataset` instance (instead of using a default instance when going via the :func:`fit()` method).\n- A new explanatory notebooks for global models:\n  https://github.com/unit8co/darts/blob/master/examples/02-multi-time-series-and-covariates.ipynb\n\n**Changed:**\n\n- 🔴 removed the arguments `training_series` and `target_series` in `ForecastingModel`s. Please consult\n  the API documentation of forecasting models to see the new signatures.\n- 🔴 removed `UnivariateForecastingModel` and `MultivariateForecastingModel` base classes. This distinction does\n  not exist anymore. Instead, now some models are \"global\" (can be trained on multiple series) or \"local\" (they cannot).\n  All implementations of `GlobalForecastingModel`s support multivariate time series out of the box, except N-BEATS.\n- Improved the documentation and README.\n- Re-ordered the example notebooks to improve the flow of examples.\n\n**Fixed:**\n\n- Many small bug fixes.\n- Unit test speedup by about 15x.\n\n## [0.5.0](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/tree/0.5.0) (2020-11-09)\n\n[Full Changelog](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/compare/0.4.0...0.5.0)\n\n### For users of the library:\n\n**Added:**\n\n- Ensemble models, a new kind of `ForecastingModel` which allows to ensemble multiple models to make predictions:\n  - `EnsembleModel` is the abstract base class for ensemble models. Classes deriving from `EnsembleModel` must implement the `ensemble()` method, which takes in a `List[TimeSeries]` of predictions from the constituent models, and returns the ensembled prediction (a single `TimeSeries` object)\n  - `RegressionEnsembleModel`, a concrete implementation of `EnsembleModel `which allows to specify any regression model (providing `fit()` and `predict()` methods) to use to ensemble the constituent models' predictions.\n- A new method to `TorchForecastingModel` : `untrained_model()` returns the model as it was initially created, allowing to retrain the exact same model from scratch. Works both when specifying a `random_state` or not.\n- New `ForecastingModel.backtest()` and `RegressionModel.backtest()` functions which by default compute a single error score from the historical forecasts the model would have produced.\n  - A new `reduction` parameter allows to specify whether to compute the mean/median/… of errors or (when `reduction` is set to `None`) to return a list of historical errors.\n  - The previous `backtest()` functionality still exists but has been renamed `historical_forecasts()`\n- Added a new `last_points_only` parameter to `historical_forecasts()`, `backtest()` and `gridsearch()`\n\n**Changed:**\n\n- 🔴 Renamed `backtest()` into `historical_forecasts()`\n- `fill_missing_values()` and `MissingValuesFiller` used to remove the variable names when used with `fill='auto'` – not anymore.\n- Modified the default plotting style to increase contrast and make plots lighter.\n\n**Fixed:**\n\n- Small mistake in the `NaiveDrift` model implementation which caused the first predicted value to repeat the last training value.\n\n### For developers of the library:\n\n**Changed:**\n\n- `@random_method` decorator now always assigns a `_random_instance` field to decorated methods (seeded with a random seed). This doesn't change the observed behavior, but allows to deterministically \"reset\" `TorchForecastingModel` by saving `_random_instance` along with the other parameters of the model upon creation.\n\n## [0.4.0](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/tree/0.4.0) (2020-10-28)\n\n[Full Changelog](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/compare/0.3.0...0.4.0)\n\n### For users of the library:\n\n**Added:**\n\n- Data (pre) processing abilities using `DataTransformer`, `Pipeline` :\n  - `DataTransformer` provide a unified interface to apply transformations on `TimeSeries`, using their `transform()` method\n  - `Pipeline` :\n    - allow chaining of `DataTransformers`\n    - provide `fit()`, `transform()`, `fit_transform()` and `inverse_transform()` methods.\n  - Implementing your own data transformers:\n    - Data transformers which need to be fitted first should derive from the `FittableDataTransformer` base class and implement a `fit()` method. Fittable transformers also provide a `fit_transform()` method, which fits the transformer and then transforms the data with a single call.\n    - Data transformers which perform an invertible transformation should derive from the `InvertibleDataTransformer` base class and implement a `inverse_transform()` method.\n    - Data transformers which are neither fittable nor invertible should derive from the `BaseDataTransformer` base class\n    - All data transformers must implement a `transform()` method.\n- Concrete `DataTransformer` implementations:\n  - `MissingValuesFiller` wraps around `fill_missing_value()` and allows to fill missing values using either a constant value or the `pd.interpolate()` method.\n  - `Mapper` and `InvertibleMapper` allow to easily perform the equivalent of a `map()` function on a TimeSeries, and can be made part of a `Pipeline`\n  - `BoxCox` allows to apply a BoxCox transformation to the data\n- Extended `map()` on `TimeSeries` to accept functions which use both a value and its timestamp to compute a new value e.g.`f(timestamp, datapoint) = new_datapoint`\n- Two new forecasting models:\n  - `TransformerModel`, an implementation based on the architecture described in [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) by Vaswani et al. (2017)\n  - `NBEATSModel`, an implementation based on the N-BEATS architecture described in [N-BEATS: Neural basis expansion analysis for interpretable time series forecasting](https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1ecqn4YwB) by Boris N. Oreshkin et al. (2019)\n\n**Changed:**\n\n- 🔴 Removed `cols` parameter from `map()`. Using indexing on `TimeSeries` is preferred.\n  ```python\n  # Assuming a multivariate TimeSeries named series with 3 columns or variables.\n  # To apply fn to columns with names '0' and '2':\n\n  #old syntax\n  series.map(fn, cols=['0', '2']) # returned a time series with 3 columns\n  #new syntax\n  series[['0', '2']].map(fn) # returns a time series with only 2 columns\n  ```\n- 🔴 Renamed `ScalerWrapper` into `Scaler`\n- 🔴 Renamed the `preprocessing` module into `dataprocessing`\n- 🔴 Unified `auto_fillna()` and `fillna()` into a single `fill_missing_value()` function\n  ```python\n  #old syntax\n  fillna(series, fill=0)\n\n  #new syntax\n  fill_missing_values(series, fill=0)\n\n  #old syntax\n  auto_fillna(series, **interpolate_kwargs)\n\n  #new syntax\n  fill_missing_values(series, fill='auto', **interpolate_kwargs)\n  fill_missing_values(series, **interpolate_kwargs) # fill='auto' by default\n  ```\n\n### For developers of the library\n\n**Changed:**\n\n- GitHub release workflow is now triggered manually from the GitHub \"Actions\" tab in the repository, providing a `#major`, `#minor`, or `#patch` argument. [#211](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/211)\n- (A limited number of) notebook examples are now run as part of the GitHub PR workflow.\n\n## [0.3.0](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/tree/0.3.0) (2020-10-05)\n\n[Full Changelog](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/compare/0.2.3...0.3.0)\n\n### For users of the library:\n\n**Added:**\n\n- Better indexing on TimeSeries (support for column/component indexing) [#150](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/150)\n- New `FourTheta` forecasting model [#123](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/123), [#156](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/156)\n- `map()` method for TimeSeries [#163](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/163), [#166](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/166)\n- Further improved the backtesting functions [#111](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/111):\n  - Added support for multivariate TimeSeries and models\n  - Added `retrain` and `stride` parameters\n- Custom style for matplotlib plots [#191](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/191)\n- sMAPE metric [#129](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/129)\n- Option to specify a `random_state` at model creation using the `@random_method` decorator on models using neural networks to allow reproducibility of results [#118](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/118)\n\n**Changed:**\n\n- 🔴 **Refactored backtesting** [#184](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/184)\n  - Moved backtesting functionalities inside `ForecastingModel` and `RegressionModel`\n    ```python\n    # old syntax:\n    backtest_forecasting(forecasting_model, *args, **kwargs)\n\n    # new syntax:\n    forecasting_model.backtest(*args, **kwargs)\n\n    # old syntax:\n    backtest_regression(regression_model, *args, **kwargs)\n\n    # new syntax:\n    regression_model.backtest(*args, **kwargs)\n    ```\n  - Consequently removed the `backtesting` module\n- 🔴 `ForecastingModel` `fit()` **method syntax** using TimeSeries indexing instead of additional parameters [#161](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/161)\n  ```python\n  # old syntax:\n  multivariate_model.fit(multivariate_series, target_indices=[0, 1])\n\n  # new syntax:\n  multivariate_model.fit(multivariate_series, multivariate_series[[\"0\", \"1\"]])\n\n  # old syntax:\n  univariate_model.fit(multivariate_series, component_index=2)\n\n  # new syntax:\n  univariate_model.fit(multivariate_series[\"2\"])\n  ```\n\n**Fixed:**\n\n- Solved issue of TorchForecastingModel.predict(n) throwing an error at n=1.

          "content": "# Darts Contribution Guidelines\n\n## Picking an Issue on Which to Work\n\nThe backlog of issues and ongoing work is tracked here: https://github.com/unit8co/darts/projects/1\nAnyone is welcome to pick an issue from the backlog, work on it and submit a pull request.\nHowever, it is strongly recommended to first comment on the issue, and discuss the approach\ntogether with some of the core developers.\n\nIf you spot issues or would like to propose new improvements that are not (yet) in the backlog\nof issues above, the best procedure is to open a regular Github issue (https://github.com/unit8co/darts/issues),\nand discuss it with some of the core team.\n\n\n## Main Development Principles\n\n* Focus on simplicity and clarity for end users.\n* Pay attention to designing the best possible API, simple by default, but offering control when needed.\n* Make it hard for users to make mistakes (e.g., future data leakage).\n* `TimeSeries` is the main data type used to interface with Darts because:\n    * We do not want users to have to worry about the specifics of Numpy, Torch etc\n    (users shouldn't have to know what's used behind the scenes if they don't want to).\n    * `TimeSeries` objects provide guarantees that the data represent a well-formed time series.\n* It is in general OK to propose breaking changes, if these changes are really genuinely improving the API.\n* Embrace functional principles as much as possible (immutability, using pure functions).\n* Coding style: better write clear code than fancy code. Follow PEP-8. Use type hints.\n* Write good docstrings for public classes and methods.\n* Always unit test everything.\n\n#### These principles should prevail even if:\n* They mean more code has to be written inside the library.\n* They decrease the raw performance / computational speed; although in general we always\n  strive to find computationally efficient solutions.\n\n\n## Technical Procedure\n\n1. Make sure your work is being tracked (and if possible discussed) by an existing issue on the backlog\n2. Fork the repository.\n3. Clone the forked repository locally.\n4. Create a clean Python env and install requirements with pip: `pip install -r requirements/dev-all.txt`\n5. Set up [automatic code formatting and linting](#code-formatting-and-linting)\n6. Create a new branch:\n    * Branch off from the **master** branch.\n    * Prefix the branch with the type of update you are making:\n        * `feature/`\n        * `fix/`\n        * `refactor/`\n        * …\n    * Work on your update\n7. Check that your code passes all the tests and design new unit tests if needed: `pytest`.\n8. If your contribution introduces a non-negligible change, add it to `CHANGELOG.md` under the \"Unreleased\" section.\n   You can already refer to the pull request. In addition, for tracking contributions we are happy if you provide\n   your full name (if you want to) and link to your Github handle. Example:\n   ```\n   - Added new feature XYZ. [#001](https://https://github.com/unit8co/darts/pull/001)\n     by [<Your Name>](https://github.com/<your-handle>).\n   ```\n9. Create a pull request from your new branch into the **master** branch.\n10. `Codecov` will add a test coverage report in the pull request. Make sure your test cover all changed lines.\n\n### Build the Documentation Locally\n\nYou can build the documentation locally using `make`:\n\n```bash\n# make sure your latest changes are installed\npip install .\n# build the docs\nmake --directory=./docs build-all-docs\n```\nAfter that docs will be available in `./docs/build/html` directory. You can just open `./docs/build/html/index.html` using your favourite browser.\n\n### Code Formatting and Linting\n\nDarts uses [Black via Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter/) with default values for automatic code formatting, along with [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/).\nAs part of the checks on pull requests, it is checked whether the code still adheres to the code style.\nTo ensure you don't need to worry about formatting and linting when contributing, it is recommended to set up at least one of the following:\n- Integration in git (recommended):\n    1. Install the pre-commit hook using `pre-commit install`\n    2. This will install `ruff` linting hooks\n    3. The formatters will automatically fix all files and in case of some non-trivial case `ruff` will highlight any remaining problems before committing\n- Integration in your editor:\n    - For other integrations please look at the documentation for your editor\n\n### Development environment on Mac with Apple Silicon M1 processor (arm64 architecture)\n\nPlease follow the procedure described in [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/blob/master/INSTALL.md#test-environment-appple-m1-processor)\nto set up a x_64 emulated environment. For the development environment, instead of installing Darts with\n`pip install darts`, instead go to the darts cloned repo location and install the packages with: `pip install -r requirements/dev-all.txt`.\nIf necessary, follow the same steps to setup libomp for lightgbm.\nFinally, verify your overall environment setup by successfully running all unitTests with `pytest`.\n"

          "content": "# Installation Guide\n\nBelow, we detail how to install Darts using either `conda` or `pip`.\n\n## From PyPI\nInstall Darts with all models except the ones from optional dependencies (Prophet, LightGBM, CatBoost, see more on that [here](#enabling-optional-dependencies)): `pip install darts`.\n\nIf this fails on your platform, please follow the official installation\nguide for [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/), then try installing Darts again.\n\nAs some dependencies are relatively big or involve non-Python dependencies,\nwe also maintain the `u8darts` package, which provides the following alternate lighter install options:\n\n* Install Darts with all available models: `pip install \"u8darts[all]\"`\n* Install core only (without neural networks, Prophet, LightGBM and Catboost): `pip install u8darts`\n* Install core + Prophet + LightGBM + CatBoost: `pip install \"u8darts[notorch]\"`\n* Install core + neural networks (PyTorch): `pip install \"u8darts[torch]\"` (equivalent to `pip install darts`)\n\n## From conda-forge\nCreate a conda environment (e.g., for Python 3.10):\n(after installing [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)):\n\n    conda create --name <env-name> python=3.10\n\nActivate the environment\n\n    conda activate <env-name>\n\nAs some models have relatively heavy dependencies, we provide four conda-forge packages:\n\n* Install Darts with all available models: `conda install -c conda-forge -c pytorch u8darts-all`\n* Install core only (without neural networks, Prophet, LightGBM and Catboost): `conda install -c conda-forge u8darts`\n* Install core + Prophet + LightGBM + CatBoost: `conda install -c conda-forge u8darts-notorch`\n* Install core + neural networks (PyTorch): `conda install -c conda-forge -c pytorch u8darts-torch`\n\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Enabling Optional Dependencies\nAs of version 0.25.0, the default `darts` package does not install Prophet, CatBoost, and LightGBM dependencies anymore, because their\nbuild processes were too often causing issues. We continue supporting the model wrappers `Prophet`, `CatBoostModel`, and `LightGBMModel` in Darts though. If you want to use any of them, you will need to manually install the corresponding packages (or install a Darts flavor as described above).\n\n#### Prophet\nInstall the `prophet` package (version 1.1.1 or more recent) using the [Prophet install guide](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/installation.html#python)\n\n#### CatBoostModel\nInstall the `catboost` package (version 1.0.6 or more recent) using the [CatBoost install guide](https://catboost.ai/en/docs/concepts/python-installation)\n\n#### LightGBMModel\nInstall the `lightgbm` package (version 3.2.0 or more recent) using the [LightGBM install guide](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation-Guide.html)\n\n### Enabling GPU support\nDarts relies on PyTorch for the neural network models.\nFor GPU support, please follow the instructions to install CUDA in the [PyTorch installation guide](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).\n\n\n### From Docker:\nWe also provide a Docker image with everything set up for you. For this setup to work you need to have a Docker service installed. You can get it at [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).\n\nPull the latest Darts image.\n```bash\ndocker pull unit8/darts:latest\n```\n\nTo run it in interactive mode:\n```bash\ndocker run -it -p 8888:8888 unit8/darts:latest bash\n```\n\nAfter that, you can also launch a Jupyter lab / notebook session:\n```bash\njupyter lab --ip 0.0.0.0 --no-browser --allow-root\n```\n\nThen copy and paste the URL provided by the docker container into your browser to access Jupyter notebook.\n"

It contains a variety of models, from classics such as ARIMA to\ndeep neural networks. The forecasting models can all be used in the same way,\nusing `fit()` and `predict()` functions, similar to scikit-learn.\nThe library also makes it easy to backtest models,\ncombine the predictions of several models, and take external data into account.\nDarts supports both univariate and multivariate time series and models.\nThe ML-based models can be trained on potentially large datasets containing multiple time\nseries, and some of the models offer a rich support for probabilistic forecasting.\n\nDarts also offers extensive anomaly detection capabilities.\nFor instance, it is trivial to apply PyOD models on time series to obtain anomaly scores,\nor to wrap any of Darts forecasting or filtering models to obtain fully\nfledged anomaly detection models.\n\n\n## Documentation\n*

environment for your project with Python 3.9+ using your favorite tool\n([conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html \"conda-env\"),\n[venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) with\nor without [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)).\n\nOnce your environment is set up you can install darts using pip:\n\n    pip install darts\n\nFor more details you can refer to our\n[installation instructions](https://github.com/unit8co/darts/blob/master/INSTALL.md).\n\n## Example Usage\n\n### Forecasting\n\nCreate a `TimeSeries` object from a Pandas DataFrame, and split it in train/validation series:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom darts import TimeSeries\n\n# Read a pandas DataFrame\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"AirPassengers.csv\", delimiter=\",\")\n\n# Create a TimeSeries, specifying the time and value columns\nseries = TimeSeries.from_dataframe(df, \"Month\", \"#Passengers\")\n\n# Set aside the last 36 months as a validation series\ntrain, val = series[:-36], series[-36:]\n```\n\nFit an exponential smoothing model, and make a (probabilistic) prediction over the validation series' duration:\n```python\nfrom darts.models import ExponentialSmoothing\n\nmodel = ExponentialSmoothing()\nmodel.fit(train)\nprediction = model.predict(len(val), num_samples=1000)\n```\n\nPlot the median, 5th and 95th percentiles:\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nseries.plot()\nprediction.plot(label=\"forecast\", low_quantile=0.05, high_quantile=0.95)\nplt.legend()\n```\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/unit8co/darts/raw/master/static/images/example.png\" alt=\"darts forecast example\" />\n</div>\n\n### Anomaly Detection\n\nLoad a multivariate series, trim it, keep 2 components, split train and validation sets:\n\n```python\nfrom darts.datasets import ETTh2Dataset\n\nseries = ETTh2Dataset().load()[:10000][[\"MUFL\", \"LULL\"]]\ntrain, val = series.split_before(0.6)\n```\n\nBuild a k-means anomaly scorer, train it on the train set\nand use it on the validation set to get anomaly scores:\n\n```python\nfrom darts.ad import KMeansScorer\n\nscorer = KMeansScorer(k=2, window=5)\nscorer.fit(train)\nanom_score = scorer.score(val)\n```\n\nBuild a binary anomaly detector and train it over train scores,\nthen use it over validation scores to get binary anomaly classification:\n\n```python\nfrom darts.ad import QuantileDetector\n\ndetector = QuantileDetector(high_quantile=0.99)\ndetector.fit(scorer.score(train))\nbinary_anom = detector.detect(anom_score)\n```\n\nPlot (shifting and scaling some of the series\nto make everything appear on the same figure):\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nseries.plot()\n(anom_score / 2. - 100).plot(label=\"computed anomaly score\", c=\"orangered\", lw=3)\n(binary_anom * 45 - 150).plot(label=\"detected binary anomaly\", lw=4)\n```\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/unit8co/darts/raw/master/static/images/example_ad.png\" alt=\"darts anomaly detection example\" />\n</div>\n\n\n## Features\n* **Forecasting Models:** A large collection of forecasting models; from statistical models (such as\n  ARIMA) to deep learning models (such as N-BEATS). See [table of models below](#forecasting-models).\n\n* **Anomaly Detection** The `darts.ad` module contains a collection of anomaly scorers,\n  detectors and aggregators, which can all be combined to detect anomalies in time series.\n  It is easy to wrap any of Darts forecasting or filtering models to build\n  a fully fledged anomaly detection model that compares predictions with actuals.\n  The `PyODScorer` makes it trivial to use PyOD detectors on time series.\n\n* **Multivariate Support:** `TimeSeries` can be multivariate - i.e., contain multiple time-varying\n  dimensions/columns instead of a single scalar value. Many models can consume and produce multivariate series.\n\n* **Multiple Series Training (Global Models):** All machine learning based models (incl. all neural networks)\n  support being trained on multiple (potentially multivariate) series. This can scale to large datasets too.\n\n* **Probabilistic Support:** `TimeSeries` objects can (optionally) represent stochastic\n  time series; this can for instance be used to get confidence intervals, and many models support different\n  flavours of probabilistic forecasting (such as estimating parametric distributions or quantiles).\n  Some anomaly detection scorers are also able to exploit these predictive distributions.\n\n* **Conformal Prediction Support:** Our conformal prediction models allow to generate probabilistic forecasts with\n  calibrated quantile intervals for any pre-trained global forecasting model.\n\n* **Past and Future Covariates Support:** Many models in Darts support past-observed and/or future-known\n  covariate (external data) time series as inputs for producing forecasts.\n\n* **Static Covariates Support:** In addition to time-dependent data, `TimeSeries` can also contain\n  static data for each dimension, which can be exploited by some models.\n\n* **Hierarchical Reconciliation:** Darts offers transformers to perform reconciliation.\n  These can make the forecasts add up in a way that respects the underlying hierarchy.\n\n* **Regression Models:** It is possible to plug-in any scikit-learn compatible model\n  to obtain forecasts as functions of lagged values of the target series and covariates.\n\n* **Training with Sample Weights:** All global models support being trained with sample weights. They can be\n  applied to each observation, forecasted time step and target column.\n\n* **Forecast Start Shifting:** All global models support training and prediction on a shifted output window.\n  This is useful for example for Day-Ahead Market forecasts, or when the covariates (or target series) are reported\n  with a delay.\n\n* **Explainability:** Darts has the ability to *explain* some forecasting models using Shap values.\n\n* **Data Processing:** Tools to easily apply (and revert) common transformations on\n  time series data (scaling, filling missing values, differencing, boxcox, ...)\n\n* **Metrics:** A variety of metrics for evaluating time series' goodness of fit;\n  from R2-scores to Mean Absolute Scaled Error.\n\n* **Backtesting:** Utilities for simulating historical forecasts, using moving time windows.\n\n* **PyTorch Lightning Support:** All deep learning models are implemented using PyTorch Lightning,\n  supporting among other things custom callbacks, GPUs/TPUs training and custom trainers.\n\n* **Filtering Models:** Darts offers three filtering models: `KalmanFilter`, `GaussianProcessFilter`,\n  and `MovingAverageFilter`, which allow to filter time series, and in some cases obtain probabilistic\n  inferences of the underlying states/values.\n\n* **Datasets** The `darts.datasets` submodule contains some popular time series datasets for rapid\n  and reproducible experimentation.\n\n## Forecasting Models\nHere's a breakdown of the forecasting models currently implemented in Darts. We are constantly working\non bringing more models and features.\n\n\n| Model
