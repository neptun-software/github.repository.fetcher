Our platform offers various options for \nstoring and managing \"knowledge posts\", with a focus on utilizing notebooks (such as R Markdown and Jupyter/IPython \nNotebook) to better promote reproducible research.\n\n## Content Submission Options\n### 1. Github Integration: \nEasily submit your posts in markdown format directly through Github. Our platform will automatically \ndetect and publish your new content in a timely manner.\n\n### 2. Built-in Editor: \nUtilize our user-friendly editor to compose and upload your posts in various formats including Jupyter Notebook, R \nmarkdown, and Google document link. We securely store your content on our internal storage for easy access and management. \nUsers can make updates, delete, share, and add comments to their posts after publishing.\n\n## Getting Started\n- #### [**Installation Instruction**](http://knowledge-repo.readthedocs.io)\n- #### [**Hosted Live Version**](https://www.knowledge-repo.com)\n- #### [**Source**](https://github.com/airbnb/knowledge-repo)\nFor more information about the motivation and inspiration behind this project, we encourage you to read our \n[Medium Post](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/scaling-knowledge-at-airbnb-875d73eff091).\n\n## Contact\n- [**Bug reports**](https://github.com/airbnb/knowledge-repo/issues)\n- **Ask us questions**\n  - [**Knowlegde-repo Slack**](https://join.slack.com/t/knowledgerepogroup/shared_invite/zt-1oxlql877-R_WUl5qGWVOt3EMs9iRKZQ)\n  - **Email**: airbnb.knowledge.repo@gmail.com\n\n## Screenshots\n\n| Name                                              | Screenshot(s)                                                                                                                 |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| [Feed](https://www.knowledge-repo.com/feed)       | <img src=\"docs/images/feed.png\" width=\"600\" />                                                                                |\n| [Example Post](https://www.knowledge-repo.com/post/example%2Fexample_md.kp)       | <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8813413/83345203-48b06c00-a2c5-11ea-8edb-18e7f8f157ce.png\" width=\"600\" /> |\n| [New Post](https://www.knowledge-repo.com/create)       | <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8813413/83345202-4817d580-a2c5-11ea-9f75-964980c4c3c3.png\" width=\"600\" /> |\n| [Post Form](https://www.knowledge-repo.com/edit?proxy=true)       | <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8813413/83345204-49490280-a2c5-11ea-97e3-248192b01526.png\" width=\"600\" /> |\n| [Stats](https://www.knowledge-repo.com/stats)       | <img src=\"docs/images/stats1.png\" width=\"295\" />  <img src=\"docs/images/stats2.png\" width=\"295\" />                            |\n  "
