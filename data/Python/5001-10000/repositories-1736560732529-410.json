With the feature enabled, the control plane can use LeaseCandidate objects (coordination.k8s.io/v1alpha1 API group) to participate in a leader election and let the kube-apiserver select the best instance according to some strategy.

The field is true when the feature is implemented in the CRI implementation (KEP-3619). ([kubernetes/kubernetes#125470](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125470), [@everpeace](https://github.com/everpeace)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Node and Testing]\n- Added an `allocatedResourcesStatus` to each container status to indicate the health status of devices exposed by the device plugin. ([kubernetes/kubernetes#126243](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126243), [@SergeyKanzhelev](https://github.com/SergeyKanzhelev)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Node and Testing]\n- Added support to the kube-proxy nodePortAddresses / --nodeport-addresses option to\n  accept the value \"primary\", meaning to only listen for NodePort connections\n  on the node's primary IPv4 and/or IPv6 address (according to the Node object).\n  This is strongly recommended, if you were not previously using\n  --nodeport-addresses, to avoid surprising behavior.\n  (This behavior is enabled by default with the nftables backend; you would\n  need to explicitly request `--nodeport-addresses 0.0.0.0/0,::/0` there to get\n  the traditional \"listen on all interfaces\" behavior.) ([kubernetes/kubernetes#123105](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/123105), [@danwinship](https://github.com/danwinship)) [SIG API Machinery, Network and Windows]\n- Added the feature gates `StrictCostEnforcementForVAP` and `StrictCostEnforcementForWebhooks` to enforce the strict cost calculation for CEL extended libraries. It is strongly recommended to turn on the feature gates as early as possible. ([kubernetes/kubernetes#124675](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124675), [@cici37](https://github.com/cici37)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth, Node and Testing]\n- Changed how the API server handles updates to `.spec.defaultBackend` of Ingress objects.\n  Server-side apply now considers `.spec.defaultBackend` to be an atomic struct.  This means that any field-owner who sets values in that struct (they are mutually exclusive) owns the whole struct. For almost all users this change has no impact; for controllers that want to change the default backend port from number to name (or vice-versa), this makes it easier. ([kubernetes/kubernetes#126207](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126207), [@thockin](https://github.com/thockin)) [SIG API Machinery]\n- Component-base/logs: when compiled with Go >= 1.21, component-base will automatically configure the slog default logger together with initializing klog.

Updates to CustomResourceDefinition are no longer allowed to transition a valid `caBundle` field to an invalid `caBundle` field, because this breaks serving of the existing CustomResourceDefinition. ([kubernetes/kubernetes#124061](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124061), [@Jefftree](https://github.com/Jefftree)) [SIG API Machinery]\n- Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA): Added a feature so the number of ResourceClaim objects can be limited per namespace and by the number of devices requested through a specific class via the v1.ResourceQuota mechanism. ([kubernetes/kubernetes#120611](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/120611), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Auth, CLI, Etcd, Node, Release, Scheduling and Testing]\n- Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA): client-side validation of a ResourceHandle would have accepted a missing DriverName, whereas server-side validation then would have raised an error. ([kubernetes/kubernetes#124075](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124075), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly))\n- Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA): in the `pod.spec.recourceClaims` array, the `source` indirection is no longer necessary. Instead of e.g. `source: resourceClaimTemplateName: my-template`, one can write `resourceClaimTemplateName: my-template`. ([kubernetes/kubernetes#125116](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125116), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Auth, Node, Scheduling and Testing]\n- Enhanced the Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) with an updated version of the resource.k8s.io API group. The primary user-facing type remains the ResourceClaim, however significant changes have been made, resulting in the new version, v1alpha3, which is not compatible with the previous version.

([kubernetes/kubernetes#124553](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124553), [@pmalek](https://github.com/pmalek))\n- Fixed a 1.30.0 regression in openapi descriptions of `PodIP.IP`  and `HostIP.IP` fields to mark the fields used as keys in those lists as required. ([kubernetes/kubernetes#126057](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126057), [@thockin](https://github.com/thockin))\n- Fixed a bug in the API server where empty collections of ValidatingAdmissionPolicies did not have an `items` field. ([kubernetes/kubernetes#124568](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124568), [@xyz-li](https://github.com/xyz-li)) [SIG API Machinery]\n- Fixed a deep copy issue when retrieving the controller reference. ([kubernetes/kubernetes#124116](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124116), [@HiranmoyChowdhury](https://github.com/HiranmoyChowdhury)) [SIG API Machinery and Release]\n- Fixed code-generator client-gen to work with `api/v1`-like package structure. ([kubernetes/kubernetes#125162](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125162), [@sttts](https://github.com/sttts)) [SIG API Machinery and Apps]\n- Fixed incorrect \"v1 Binding is deprecated in v1.6+\" warning in kube-scheduler log. ([kubernetes/kubernetes#125540](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125540), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG API Machinery]\n- Fixed the comment for the Job's managedBy field. ([kubernetes/kubernetes#124793](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124793), [@mimowo](https://github.com/mimowo)) [SIG API Machinery and Apps]\n- Fixed the documentation for the default value of the `procMount` entry in `securityContext` within a Pod.\n  The documentation was previously using the name of the internal variable `DefaultProcMount`, rather than the actual value, \"Default\". ([kubernetes/kubernetes#125782](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125782), [@aborrero](https://github.com/aborrero)) [SIG Apps and Node]\n- Graduate PodDisruptionConditions to GA and lock ([kubernetes/kubernetes#125461](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125461), [@mimowo](https://github.com/mimowo)) [SIG Apps, Node, Scheduling and Testing]\n- Graduated MatchLabelKeys/MismatchLabelKeys feature in PodAffinity/PodAntiAffinity to Beta. ([kubernetes/kubernetes#123638](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/123638), [@sanposhiho](https://github.com/sanposhiho)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Scheduling and Testing]\n- Graduated `JobPodFailurePolicy` to GA and locked it to it's default. ([kubernetes/kubernetes#125442](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125442), [@mimowo](https://github.com/mimowo)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Scheduling and Testing]\n- Graduated the Job `successPolicy` field to beta.\n  \n  The new reason label, \"SuccessPolicy\" and \"CompletionsReached\" are added to the \"jobs_finished_total\" metric.\n  Additionally, if you enable the `JobSuccessPolicy` feature gate, the Job gets \"CompletionsReached\" reason for the \"SuccessCriteriaMet\" and \"Complete\" condition type\n  when the number of succeeded Job Pods (`.status.succeeded`) reached the desired completions (`.spec.completions`). ([kubernetes/kubernetes#126067](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126067), [@tenzen-y](https://github.com/tenzen-y)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps and Testing]\n- Graduated the `DisableNodeKubeProxyVersion` feature gate to beta. By default, the kubelet no longer attempts to set the `.status.kubeProxyVersion` field for its associated Node. ([kubernetes/kubernetes#123845](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/123845), [@HirazawaUi](https://github.com/HirazawaUi)) [SIG API Machinery, Cloud Provider, Network, Node and Testing]\n- Improved scheduling performance when many nodes, and prefilter returned 1-2 nodes (e.g. daemonset)\n  \n  For developers of out-of-tree PostFilter plugins, note that the semantics of NodeToStatusMap are changing: A node with an absent value in the NodeToStatusMap should be interpreted as having an UnschedulableAndUnresolvable status. ([kubernetes/kubernetes#125197](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125197), [@gabesaba](https://github.com/gabesaba))\n- Introduced a new boolean kubelet flag `--fail-cgroupv1`. ([kubernetes/kubernetes#126031](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126031), [@harche](https://github.com/harche)) [SIG API Machinery and Node]\n- K8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/util/runtime: Added support for new calls to handle panics and errors in the context where they occur. `PanicHandlers` and `ErrorHandlers` now must accept a context parameter for that. Log output is structured instead of unstructured. ([kubernetes/kubernetes#121970](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/121970), [@pohly](https://github.com/pohly)) [SIG API Machinery and Instrumentation]\n- KEP-1880: Users of the new feature to add multiple service CIDR will use by default a dual-write strategy on the new ClusterIP allocators to avoid the problem of possible duplicate IPs allocated to Services when running skewed kube-apiservers using different allocators. They can opt-out of this behavior by enabled the feature gate DisableAllocatorDualWrite. ([kubernetes/kubernetes#122047](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/122047), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Instrumentation and Testing]\n- Kube-apiserver: Added Alpha features to allow API server authz to check the context of requests:\n  - The `AuthorizeWithSelectors` feature gate enables including field and label selector information from requests in webhook authorization calls.\n  - The `AuthorizeNodeWithSelectors` feature gate changes node authorizer behavior to limit requests from node API clients, so that each Node can only get / list / watch its own Node API object, and can also only get / list / watch Pod API objects bound to that node. Clients using kubelet credentials to read other nodes or unrelated pods must change their authentication credentials (recommended), adjust their usage, or obtain broader read access independent of the node authorizer. ([kubernetes/kubernetes#125571](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125571), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth, Node, Scheduling and Testing]\n- Kube-apiserver: ControllerRevision objects are now verified to contain valid JSON data in the `data` field. ([kubernetes/kubernetes#125549](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125549), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt)) [SIG API Machinery and Apps]\n- Kube-apiserver: the `--encryption-provider-config` file is now loaded with strict deserialization, which fails if the config file contains duplicate or unknown fields. This protects against accidentally running with config files that are malformed, mis-indented, or have typos in field names, and getting unexpected behavior. When `--encryption-provider-config-automatic-reload` is used, new encryption config files that contain typos after the kube-apiserver is running are treated as invalid and the last valid config is used. ([kubernetes/kubernetes#124912](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124912), [@enj](https://github.com/enj)) [SIG API Machinery and Auth]\n- Kube-controller-manager: the `horizontal-pod-autoscaler-upscale-delay` and `horizontal-pod-autoscaler-downscale-delay` flags have been removed (deprecated and non-functional since v1.12). ([kubernetes/kubernetes#124948](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124948), [@SataQiu](https://github.com/SataQiu)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps and Autoscaling]\n- Made kube-proxy Windows service control manager integration (`--windows-service`) configurable in v1alpha1 component configuration via `windowsRunAsService` field. ([kubernetes/kubernetes#126072](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126072), [@aroradaman](https://github.com/aroradaman)) [SIG Network and Scalability]\n- PersistentVolumeLastPhaseTransitionTime feature is stable and enabled by default. ([kubernetes/kubernetes#124969](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124969), [@RomanBednar](https://github.com/RomanBednar)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Storage and Testing]\n- Promoted `LocalStorageCapacityIsolation` to beta; the behaviour is enabled by default. Within the kubelet, storage capacity isolation is active if the feature gate is enabled and the specific Pod is using a user namespace. ([kubernetes/kubernetes#126014](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126014), [@PannagaRao](https://github.com/PannagaRao)) [SIG Apps, Autoscaling, Node, Storage and Testing]\n- Promoted `StatefulSetStartOrdinal` to stable. This means `--feature-gates=StatefulSetStartOrdinal=true` are not needed on kube-apiserver and kube-controller-manager binaries and they'll be removed soon following policy at https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/#deprecation. ([kubernetes/kubernetes#125374](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125374), [@pwschuurman](https://github.com/pwschuurman)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps and Testing]\n- Promoted feature-gate `VolumeAttributesClass` to beta (disabled by default). Users need to enable the feature gate and the `storage.k8s.io/v1beta1` API group to use this feature.\n  Promoted the VolumeAttributesClass API to beta. ([kubernetes/kubernetes#126145](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126145), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, CLI, Etcd, Storage and Testing]\n- Removed deprecated command flags --volume-host-cidr-denylist\n  and --volume-host-allow-local-loopback from kube-controller-manager.\n   ([kubernetes/kubernetes#124017](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124017), [@carlory](https://github.com/carlory)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, Cloud Provider and Storage]\n- Removed feature gate `CustomResourceValidationExpressions`. ([kubernetes/kubernetes#126136](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126136), [@cici37](https://github.com/cici37)) [SIG API Machinery, Cloud Provider and Testing]\n- Reverted a [change](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/123513) where `ConsistentListFromCache` was moved to beta and enabled by default. ([kubernetes/kubernetes#126139](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126139), [@enj](https://github.com/enj))\n- Revised the Pod API with Alpha support for volumes derived from OCI artifacts. This feature is behind the `ImageVolume` feature gate. ([kubernetes/kubernetes#125660](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125660), [@saschagrunert](https://github.com/saschagrunert)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps and Node]\n- Supported fine-grained supplemental groups policy (KEP-3619), which enabled\n  fine-grained control for supplementary groups in the first container processes.\n  This allows you to choose whether to include groups defined in the container image (/etc/groups)\n  for the container's primary UID or not. ([kubernetes/kubernetes#117842](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/117842), [@everpeace](https://github.com/everpeace)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps and Node]\n- The (alpha) nftables mode of kube-proxy now requires version 1.0.1 or later\n  of the nft command-line, and kernel 5.13 or later. (For testing/development\n  purposes, you can use older kernels, as far back as 5.4, if you set the\n  `nftables.skipKernelVersionCheck` option in the kube-proxy config, but this is not\n  recommended in production since it may cause problems with other nftables\n  users on the system.) ([kubernetes/kubernetes#124152](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124152), [@danwinship](https://github.com/danwinship)) [SIG Network]\n- To enhance usability and developer experience, CRD validation rules now support direct use of (CEL) reserved keywords as field names in object validation expressions for existing expressions in storage, will fully support runtime in next release for compatibility concern. ([kubernetes/kubernetes#126188](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126188), [@cici37](https://github.com/cici37)) [SIG API Machinery and Testing]\n- Updated the feature MultiCIDRServiceAllocator to beta (disabled by default). Users need to enable the feature gate and the networking v1beta1 group to be able to use this new feature, that allows to dynamically reconfigure Service CIDR ranges. ([kubernetes/kubernetes#125021](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125021), [@aojea](https://github.com/aojea)) [SIG API Machinery, Apps, CLI, Etcd, Instrumentation, Network and Testing]\n- Use omitempty for optional Job Pod Failure Policy fields. ([kubernetes/kubernetes#126046](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126046), [@mimowo](https://github.com/mimowo))\n- User can choose a different static policy option `SpreadPhysicalCPUsPreferredOption` to spread cpus across physical cpus for some specific applications ([kubernetes/kubernetes#123733](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/123733), [@Jeffwan](https://github.com/Jeffwan)) [SIG Node]\n- When the featuregate AnonymousAuthConfigurableEndpoints is enabled users can update the AuthenticationConfig file with endpoints for with anonymous requests are alllowed. ([kubernetes/kubernetes#124917](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/124917), [@vinayakankugoyal](https://github.com/vinayakankugoyal)) [SIG API Machinery, Auth, Cloud Provider, Node and Testing]\n- Move ConsistentListFromCache feature flag to Beta and enable it by default ([kubernetes/kubernetes#126469](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/126469), [@serathius](https://github.com/serathius)) [SIG API Machinery]\n- Add Coordinated Leader Election as alpha under the CoordinatedLeaderElection feature gate.

When configuring a dual-stack cluster, the user must specify both --node-cidr-mask-size-ipv4 and --node-cidr-mask-size-ipv6 to set the per-node IP mask sizes, instead of the previous --node-cidr-mask-size flag.\n  2. The --node-cidr-mask-size flag is mutually exclusive with --node-cidr-mask-size-ipv4 and --node-cidr-mask-size-ipv6.\n  3. Single-stack clusters do not need to change, but may choose to use the more specific flags.  Users can use either the older --node-cidr-mask-size flag or one of the newer --node-cidr-mask-size-ipv4 or --node-cidr-mask-size-ipv6 flags to configure the per-node IP mask size, provided that the flag's IP family matches the cluster's IP family (--cluster-cidr).

When webhooks use `admission.k8s.io/v1`, the following additional validation is performed on their responses:\n  - `response.patch` and `response.patchType` are not permitted from validating admission webhooks\n  - `apiVersion: \"admission.k8s.io/v1\"` is required\n  - `kind: \"AdmissionReview\"` is required\n  - `response.uid: \"<value of request.uid>\"` is required\n  - `response.patchType: \"JSONPatch\"` is required (if `response.patch` is set) ([#80231](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/80231), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))\n- The `CustomResourceDefinition` API type is promoted to `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1` with the following changes:\n  - Use of the new `default` feature in validation schemas is limited to v1\n  - `spec.scope` is no longer defaulted to `Namespaced` and must be explicitly specified\n  - `spec.version` is removed in v1; use `spec.versions` instead\n  - `spec.validation` is removed in v1; use `spec.versions[*].schema` instead\n  - `spec.subresources` is removed in v1; use `spec.versions[*].subresources` instead\n  - `spec.additionalPrinterColumns` is removed in v1; use `spec.versions[*].additionalPrinterColumns` instead\n  - `spec.conversion.webhookClientConfig` is moved to `spec.conversion.webhook.clientConfig` in v1\n  - `spec.conversion.conversionReviewVersions` is moved to `spec.conversion.webhook.conversionReviewVersions` in v1\n  - `spec.versions[*].schema.openAPIV3Schema` is now required when creating v1 CustomResourceDefinitions\n  - `spec.preserveUnknownFields: true` is disallowed when creating v1 CustomResourceDefinitions; it must be specified within schema definitions as `x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields: true`\n  - In `additionalPrinterColumns` items, the `JSONPath` field was renamed to `jsonPath` in v1 (fixes https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/66531)\n    The `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1` version of `CustomResourceDefinition` is deprecated and will no longer be served in v1.19. ([#79604](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/79604), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))\n- The `ConversionReview` API sent to and received from custom resource CustomResourceDefinition conversion webhooks has been promoted to `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1`. CustomResourceDefinition conversion webhooks can now indicate they support receiving and responding with `ConversionReview` API objects in the `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1` version by including `v1` in the `conversionReviewVersions` list in their CustomResourceDefinition. Conversion webhooks must respond with a ConversionReview object in the same apiVersion they receive. `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1` `ConversionReview` responses must specify a `response.uid` that matches the `request.uid` of the object they were sent. ([#81476](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/81476), [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt))\n- Add scheduling support for RuntimeClasses. RuntimeClasses can now specify nodeSelector constraints & tolerations, which are merged into the PodSpec for pods using that RuntimeClass. ([#80825](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/80825), [@tallclair](https://github.com/tallclair))\n- Kubelet should now more reliably report the same primary node IP even if the set of node IPs reported by the CloudProvider changes. ([#79391](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/79391), [@danwinship](https://github.com/danwinship))\n- Omit nil or empty field when calculating container hash value to avoid hash changed. For a new field with a non-nil default value in the container spec, the hash would still get changed. ([#57741](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/57741), [@dixudx](https://github.com/dixudx))\n- Property `conditions` in `apiextensions.v1beta1.CustomResourceDefinitionStatus` and `apiextensions.v1.CustomResourceDefinitionStatus` is now optional instead of required. ([#64996](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/64996), [@roycaihw](https://github.com/roycaihw))\n- When the status of a CustomResourceDefinition condition changes, its corresponding `lastTransitionTime` is now updated.

          "content": "# Contributing Guidelines\n\n## How to become a contributor and submit your own code\n\n### Contributor License Agreements\n\nWe'd love to accept your patches! Before we can take them, we have to jump a couple of legal hurdles.\n\nPlease fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License Agreement (CLA).\n\n  * If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an [individual CLA](https://identity.linuxfoundation.org/node/285/node/285/individual-signup).\n  * If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work, then you'll need to sign a [corporate CLA](https://identity.linuxfoundation.org/node/285/organization-signup).\n\nFollow either of the two links above to access the appropriate CLA and instructions for how to sign and return it. Once we receive it, we'll be able to accept your pull requests.\n\n## Composition of This Repository and Where/How to Contribute\n\nThe Kubernetes Python client contains mostly files that are generated by the OpenAPI generator from [this OpenAPI spec](scripts/swagger.json). In the repo there is also the utility part, which allows developers to create their own kubernetes clients ([kubernetes/base](kubernetes/base)). The base repo was once a submodule of the main repo, but is now integrated into the main repo. The archived code is available ([here](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python-base)).\n\n### Where to Submit Your Patch\n\nThe following folders are automatically generated. You will need to submit a patch to the upstream Kubernetes repo [kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) or the OpenAPI generator repo [openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator).\n- [kubernetes/client](kubernetes/client)\n- [kubernetes/test](kubernetes/test)\n- [kubernetes/docs](kubernetes/docs).\n\nIn this main repo, the following folders contain developer written codes and the patches should be submitted as pull requests here:\n- [kubernetes/base](kubernetes/base)\n- [kubernetes/config](kubernetes/config)\n- [kubernetes/dynamic](kubernetes/dynamic)\n- [kubernetes/e2e_test](kubernetes/e2e_test)\n- [kubernetes/leaderelection](kubernetes/leaderelection)\n- [kubernetes/stream](kubernetes/stream)\n- [kubernetes/utils](kubernetes/utils)\n- [kubernetes/watch](kubernetes/watch)\n- [examples](examples)\n- [scripts](scripts).\n\n\n### Contributing A Patch\n\n1. Submit an issue describing your proposed change to the repo in question.\n2. The [repo owners](OWNERS) will respond to your issue promptly.\n3. If your proposed change is accepted, and you haven't already done so, sign a Contributor License Agreement (see details above).\n4. Fork the desired repo, develop and test your code changes. Add a test if possible.\n5. Submit a pull request.\n\n### Adding Dependencies\n\nIf your patch depends on new packages, add those packages to [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) and/or [setup.py](setup.py). If these package are for testing only, add those to [test-requirements.txt](test-requirements.txt).\n\n### Commits\n\nGenerally we would like to see one commit per pull request. However, if the pull request is reasonably large, the PR can be divided into several commits that make logical sense. The commit message should be clear and indicative of the aim of the fix. Sometimes multiple commits in a single pull request is acceptable if it meets the Kubernetes [pull request guidelines](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/pull-requests.md#6-squashing-and-commit-titles).\n\nIf you have several commits in a pull request and have been asked to squash your commits, please use ```git reset --soft HEAD~N_COMMITS``` and commit again to make your PR a single commit.\n\n### Windows Developers\n\nThe symbolic links contained in this repo do not work for Windows operating systems. If you are a Windows developer, please run the [fix](scripts/windows-setup-fix.bat) inside the scripts folder or manually copy the content of the [kubernetes/base](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python-base) folder into the [kubernetes](kubernetes) folder.\n\n### Writing Tests\n\nIn addition to running the fix yourself and telling us that your fix works, you can demonstrate that your fix really works by using unit tests and end to end tests. Tests are mainly located in three places. You should put your tests into the places that they fit in.\n\n1. [Generated tests](kubernetes/test) by OpenAPI generator: these tests should pass and do not require modification.\n2. [End to end tests](kubernetes/e2e_test): these are tests that can only be verified with a live kubernetes server.\n3. Base repo tests in the [base](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python-base) repo, in which the test files are named ```test_*.py```: These tests use the package ```Mock``` and confirms the functionality of the base repo files.\n\n### Coding Style\n\nWe use an automatic coding style checker by using the ```diff``` of the autopep8 output and your code file. To make sure that your code passes the coding style checker, run ```autopep8 --in-place --aggressive --aggressive your_code.py``` before committing and submitting.\n\n## Running Tests Locally\n\nIf you write a new end to end (e2e) test, or change behaviors that affect e2e tests, you should set up a local cluster and test them on your machine. The following steps will help you run the unit tests.\n\n1. Acquire a local cluster. [Minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube) is a good choice for Windows and Linux developers. Alternatively if you are on Linux, you can clone the [kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) repo and run [install-etcd.sh](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/hack/install-etcd.sh) and then [local-up-cluster.sh](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/hack/local-up-cluster.sh) to get a local cluster up and running.\n\n2. Run the unit tests. In the root directory of the main repo, run ```python -m unittest discover```.\n\n3. Check the test results and make corresponding fixes.\n"

please upgrade.\n\nKubernetes supports [three minor releases](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/release/versioning.md#supported-releases-and-component-skew) at a time. \"Support\" means we expect users to be running that version in production, though we may not port fixes back before the latest minor version. For example, when v1.3 comes out, v1.0 will no longer be supported. In consistent with Kubernetes support policy, we expect to support **three GA major releases** (corresponding to three Kubernetes minor releases) at a time.\n\nNote: There would be no maintenance for alpha/beta releases except the latest one.\n\n**Exception to the above support rule:** Since we are running behind on releases, we will support Alpha/Beta releases for a greater number of clients until we catch up with the upstream version.\n\n## Homogenizing the Kubernetes Python Client versions\n\nThe client releases v12 and before following a versioning schema where the major version was 4 integer positions behind the Kubernetes minor on which the client is based on. For example, v12.0.0 is based on Kubernetes v1.16, v11.0.0 is based on Kubernetes v1.15 and so on.\n\nThis created a lot of confusion tracking two different version numbers for each client release. It was decided to homogenize the version scheme starting from the Kubernetes Python client based on Kubernetes v1.17. The versioning scheme of the client from this release would be vY.Z.P where Y and Z are the Kubernetes minor and patch release numbers from Kubernets v1.Y.Z and P is the client specific patch release numbers to accommodate changes and fixes done specifically to the client. For more details, refer [this issue](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python/issues/1244).\n\n## Community, Support, Discussion\n\nIf you have any problem on using the package or any suggestions, please start with reaching the [Kubernetes clients slack channel](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/C76GB48RK/), or filing an [issue](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python/issues) to let us know. You can also reach the maintainers of this project at [SIG API Machinery](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-api-machinery), where this project falls under.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\nParticipation in the Kubernetes community is governed by the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### SSLError on macOS\n\nIf you get an SSLError, you likely need to update your version of python. The\nversion that ships with macOS may not be supported.\n\nInstall the latest version of python with [brew](https://brew.sh/):\n\n```\nbrew install python\n```\n\nOnce installed, you can query the version of OpenSSL like so:\n\n```\npython -c \"import ssl; print (ssl.OPENSSL_VERSION)\"\n```\n\nYou'll need a version with OpenSSL version 1.0.0 or later.\n\n### Hostname doesn't match\n\nIf you get an `ssl.CertificateError` complaining about hostname match, your installed packages does not meet version [requirements](requirements.txt).\nSpecifically check `ipaddress` and `urllib3` package versions to make sure they met requirements in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file.\n\n### Why Exec/Attach calls doesn't work\n\nStarting from 4.0 release, we do not support directly calling exec or attach calls. you should use stream module to call them. so instead\nof `resp = api.connect_get_namespaced_pod_exec(name, ...` you should call `resp = stream(api.connect_get_namespaced_pod_exec, name, ...`.\n\nUsing Stream will overwrite the requests protocol in _core_v1_api.CoreV1Api()_\nThis will cause a failure in  non-exec/attach calls. If you reuse your api client object, you will need to\nrecreate it between api calls that use _stream_ and other api calls.\n\nSee more at [exec example](examples/pod_exec.py).\n\n**[⬆ back to top](#Installation)**\n"
