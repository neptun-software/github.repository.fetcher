Top International open source organizations including [Kubernates](https://kubernetes.io/) all adopt the form of SIGs, so that members with the same specific interests can share, learn knowledge and develop projects. These members do not need to be in the same country/region or the same organization, as long as they are like-minded, they can all study, work, and play together with the same goals~\n\nPaddleGAN SIG is such a developer organization that brings together people who interested in GAN. There are frontline developers of PaddlePaddle, senior engineers from the world's top 500, and students from top universities at home and abroad.\n\nWe are continuing to recruit developers interested and capable to join us building this project and explore more useful and interesting applications together.\n\nSIG contributions:\n\n- [zhen8838](https://github.com/zhen8838): contributed to AnimeGANv2.\n- [Jay9z](https://github.com/Jay9z): contributed to DCGAN and updated install docs, etc.\n- [HighCWu](https://github.com/HighCWu): contributed to c-DCGAN and WGAN. Support to use `paddle.vision.datasets`.\n- [hao-qiang](https://github.com/hao-qiang) & [ minivision-ai ](https://github.com/minivision-ai): contributed to the photo2cartoon project.\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions and suggestions are highly welcomed.
