          "content": "Lux is a project undergoing active development. If you are interested in contributing to Lux, the open tasks on [GitHub issues](https://github.com/lux-org/lux/issues), esp. issues labelled with the tag [`easy`](https://github.com/lux-org/lux/labels/easy), are good places for newcomers to contribute. This guide contains information on the workflow for contributing to the Lux codebase. For more information on the Lux architecture, see this [documentation page](https://lux-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/advanced/architecture.html). \n\n\n# Setting up Build and Installation Process\n\nTo setup Lux manually for development purposes, you should [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the Github repo and clone the forked version.\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/USERNAME/lux.git\n```\n\nYou can install Lux by building from the source code in your fork directly:\n\n```bash\ncd lux/\npip install --user -r requirements.txt\npip install --user -r requirements-dev.txt\npython setup.py install\n```\n\nWhen you make a change to the source code in the `lux/` folder, you can rebuild by doing this: \n\n```bash\npython setup.py install\n```\n\n# Debugging and Testing with Jupyter\n\nIt is often useful to test your code changes via Jupyter notebook. To debug your code changes, you can import a \"local\" copy of Lux without having to rebuild the changes everytime.\n\nFor example, you can have a test notebook `test.ipynb` that imports. Note that when you do `import lux` at this path, it imports the local lux/ module instead of your global installation (either system-wide or in your virtual environment).\n\n```\nlux/\n    - test.ipynb\n    - lux/\n```\n\n# Code Formatting\nIn order to keep our codebase clean and readible, we are using PEP8 guidelines. To help us maintain and check code style currently we use the following `pre-commit` hooks to automatically format the code on every commit and enforce its formatting on CI:\n\n* [black](https://github.com/psf/black)\n\nPrecommit hooks are installed for you as part of [requirements-dev.txt](https://github.com/lux-org/lux/blob/master/requirements-dev.txt). To ensure precommit hooks run on every commit, run the install command:\n\n```bash\npre-commit install\n```\n\nTo manually run precommit hooks use:\n\n```bash\npre-commit run --all-files\n``` \n\n# Running the Test Suite\n\nThere is a suite of test files for ensuring that Lux is working correctly. These tests are triggered to run via [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/lux-org/lux) whenever there is a commit made to the lux repository. You can run them locally to make sure that your changes are working and do not break any of the existing tests.\n\nTo run all the tests, including checking for code formatting, run:\n\n```\nmake test\n```\n\nTo run a single test file, run:\n\n```\npython -m pytest tests/<test_file_name>.py\n```\n# Commit Guidelines\n\n## Commit Message formatting\n\nTo ensure that all commit messages in the master branch follow a specific format, we\nenforce that all commit messages must follow the following format:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    FEAT-#9999: Add new functionality for feature XYZ\n\nThe ``FEAT`` component represents the type of commit. This component of the commit\nmessage can be one of the following:\n\n* FEAT: A new feature that is added\n* DOCS: Documentation improvements or updates\n* FIX: A bugfix contribution\n* REFACTOR: Moving or removing code without change in functionality\n* TEST: Test updates or improvements\n\nThe ``#9999`` component of the commit message should be the issue number in the \nGitHub issue tracker: https://github.com/lux-org/lux/issues. This is important\nbecause it links commits to their issues.\n\nThe commit message should follow a colon (:) and be descriptive and succinct.\n\n## Sign-off Procedure\n\nTo keep a clear track of who did what, we use a `sign-off` procedure on patches or pull requests that are being sent. This signed-off process is the same procedures used by many open-source projects, including the [Linux kernel](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.17/process/submitting-patches.html). The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation\nfor the patch, which certifies that you wrote it or otherwise have the right to pass it\non as an open-source patch. If you can certify the below:\n\n```\nCERTIFICATE OF ORIGIN V 1.1\nBy making a contribution to this project, I certify that:\n\n1.) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I have the right to\nsubmit it under the open source license indicated in the file; or\n2.) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best of my knowledge, is\ncovered under an appropriate open source license and I have the right under that license\nto submit that work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part by me, under\nthe same open source license (unless I am permitted to submit under a different\nlicense), as indicated in the file; or\n3.) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other person who certified (a),\n(b) or (c) and I have not modified it.\n4.) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution are public and that a\nrecord of the contribution (including all personal information I submit with it,\nincluding my sign-off) is maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent\nwith this project or the open source license(s) involved.\n```\n\nthen you can add the signoff line at the end of your commit as follows: \n\n```bash\nThis is my commit message\n\nSigned-off-by: Awesome Developer <developer@example.org>\n```\n\nCode without a proper signoff cannot be merged into the\nmaster branch. You must use your real name and working email in the commit signature.\n\nThe signoff line can either be manually added to your commit body, or you can add either ``-s``\nor ``--signoff`` to your usual ``git commit`` commands:\n\n```bash\ngit commit --signoff\ngit commit -s\n```\n\nThis will use your default git configuration which is found in `.git/config`. To change\nthis, you can use the following commands:\n\n```bash\ngit config --global user.name \"Awesome Developer\"\ngit config --global user.email \"awesome.developer@example.org\"\n```\n\nIf you have authored a commit that is missing the signed-off-by line, you can amend your\ncommits and push them to GitHub.\n\n```bash\ngit commit --amend --signoff\n```\n\nIf you've pushed your changes to GitHub already you'll need to force push your branch\nafter this with ``git push -f``.\n\n# Submitting a Pull Request\n\nYou can commit your code and push to your forked repo. Once all of your local changes have been tested and formatted, you are ready to submit a PR. For Lux, we use the \"Squash and Merge\" strategy to merge in PR, which means that even if you make a lot of small commits in your PR, they will all get squashed into a single commit associated with the PR. Please make sure that comments and unnecessary file changes are not committed as part of the PR by looking at the \"File Changes\" diff view on the pull request page.\n    \nOnce the pull request is submitted, the maintainer will get notified and review your pull request. They may ask for additional changes or comment on the PR. You can always make updates to your pull request after submitting it.\n\n# Building Documentation\n\nLux uses [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) to generate the documentations, which contains both the docstring and the written documentation in the `doc/` folder. To build the documentation in HTML, you can run this command locally in the `doc/` folder:\n\n```bash\nmake html\n```\n\nThis generates all the HTML documentation files in `doc/_build/html/`. The configuration file `conf.py` contains information related to Sphinx settings. The Sphinx documentations are written as ReStructuredText (`*.rst` files) and mostly stored in the `source/` folder. The documentation inside `source/reference` is auto-generated by Sphinx. The repository is linked with [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/lux-api/), which triggers the build for the latest documentation based on the most recent commit. As a result, we do not commit anything inside `doc/_build` in the Github repository.\n\n# Updating the Conda Recipe\n\nIn order to update the conda recipe on conda forge, you can follow the steps [here](https://conda-forge.org/#update_recipe). The conda recipe needs to be updated when either a new dependency is added or when the version number needs to be updated in the case of a new release. \n"

By simply printing out a dataframe in a Jupyter notebook, Lux recommends a set of visualizations highlighting interesting trends and patterns in the dataset. Visualizations are displayed via [an interactive widget](https://github.com/lux-org/lux-widget) that enables users to quickly browse through large collections of visualizations and make sense of their data.\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/lux-org/lux-resources/blob/master/readme_img/demohighlight.gif?raw=true\"\n     alt=\"Highlighted Visual Dataframe Workflow with Lux\"\n     style=\"width:900px\" />\n     \nHere is a [1-min video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmnYP-LmbNU) introducing Lux, and [slides](http://dorisjunglinlee.com/files/Zillow_07_2020_Slide.pdf) from a more extended talk.\n\nCheck out our [notebook gallery](https://lux-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/reference/gallery.html) with examples of how Lux can be used with different datasets and analyses. \n<br>Or try out Lux on your own in a [live Jupyter Notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/lux-org/lux-binder/master?urlpath=lab/tree/demo/hpi_covid_demo.ipynb)! \n\n# Getting Started\n\nTo start using Lux, simply add an extra import statement along with your Pandas import.\n\n```python    \nimport lux\nimport pandas as pd\n```\n\nLux can be used without modifying any existing Pandas code. Here, we use Pandas's [read_csv](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html) command to load in a [dataset of colleges](https://github.com/lux-org/lux-datasets/blob/master/data/college.csv) and their properties.\n\n```python    \ndf = pd.read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lux-org/lux-datasets/master/data/college.csv\")\ndf\n```\nWhen the dataframe is printed out, Lux automatically recommends a set of visualizations highlighting interesting trends and patterns in the dataset.\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/lux-org/lux-resources/blob/master/readme_img/basicDemo.gif?raw=true\"\n     alt=\"Basic recommendations in Lux\"\n     style=\"width:900px\" />\n\nVoila! Here's a set of visualizations that you can now use to explore your dataset further!\n\n### Next-step recommendations based on user intent: \n\nIn addition to dataframe visualizations at every step in the exploration, you can specify to Lux the attributes and values you're interested in. Based on this intent, Lux guides users towards potential next-steps in their exploration.\n\nFor example, we might be interested in the attributes `AverageCost` and `SATAverage`.\n\n```python\ndf.intent = [\"AverageCost\",\"SATAverage\"]\ndf\n```\n<img src=\"https://github.com/lux-org/lux-resources/blob/master/readme_img/contextRec.gif?raw=true\"\n     alt=\"Next-step Recommendations Based on User Context\"\n     style=\"width:600px\" />\n \n The left-hand side of the widget shows the current visualization, i.e., the current visualization generated based on what the user is interested in. On the right, Lux generates three sets of recommendations, organized as separate tabs on the widget:\n\n - `Enhance` adds an additional attribute to the current selection, essentially highlighting how additional variables affect the relationship of `AverageCost` and `SATAverage`. We see that if we breakdown the relationship by `FundingModel`, there is a clear separation between public colleges (shown in red) and private colleges (in blue), with public colleges being cheaper to attend and with SAT average of lower than 1400.\n    <img src=\"https://github.com/lux-org/lux-resources/blob/master/readme_img/enhance.png?raw=true\"\n     alt=\"Enhance Recommendations\"\n     style=\"width:600px\" />\n - `Filter` adds a filter to the current selection, while keeping attributes (on the X and Y axes) fixed. These visualizations show how the relationship of  `AverageCost` and `SATAverage` changes for different subsets of data. For instance, we see that colleges that offer Bachelor's degree as its highest degree show a roughly linear trend between the two variables.\n    <img src=\"https://github.com/lux-org/lux-resources/blob/master/readme_img/filter.png?raw=true\"\n     alt=\"Filter Recommendations\"\n     style=\"width:600px\" />\n - `Generalize` removes an attribute to display a more general trend, showing the distributions of `AverageCost` and `SATAverage` on its own. From the `AverageCost` histogram, we see that many colleges with average cost of around $20000 per year, corresponding to the bulge we see in the scatterplot view.\n    <img src=\"https://github.com/lux-org/lux-resources/blob/master/readme_img/generalize.png?raw=true\"\n     alt=\"Generalize Recommendations\"\n     style=\"width:600px\" />\n\n See [this page](https://lux-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/guide/intent.html) for more information on additional ways for specifying the intent.\n\n### Easy programmatic access and export of visualizations: \n\nNow that we have found some interesting visualizations through Lux, we might be interested in digging into these visualizations a bit more or sharing it with others. We can save the visualizations generated in Lux as a [static, shareable HTML](https://lux-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/guide/export.html#exporting-widget-visualizations-as-static-html) or programmatically access these visualizations further in Jupyter. Selected `Vis` objects can be translated into [Altair](http://altair-viz.github.io/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), or [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) code, so that they can be further edited.\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/lux-org/lux-resources/blob/master/readme_img/export.gif?raw=true\"\n     alt=\"Easily exportable visualization object\"\n     style=\"width:600px\" />\n     \nLearn more about how to save and export visualizations [here](https://lux-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/guide/export.html#exporting-widget-visualizations-as-static-html).\n\n### Quick, on-demand visualizations with the help of automatic encoding: \nWe've seen how `Vis`s are automatically generated as part of the recommendations. Users can also create their own Vis via the same syntax as specifying the intent. Lux is built on the philosophy that users should always be able to visualize anything they want, without having to think about *how* the visualization should look like. Lux automatically determines the mark and channel mappings based on a set of [best practices](http://hosteddocs.ittoolbox.com/fourshowmeautomaticpresentations.pdf). The visualizations are rendered via [Altair](https://github.com/altair-viz/altair/tree/master/altair) into [Vega-Lite](https://github.com/vega/vega-lite) specifications.\n\n```python    \nfrom lux.vis.Vis import Vis\nVis([\"Region=New England\",\"MedianEarnings\"],df)\n```    \n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/lux-org/lux-resources/blob/master/readme_img/view.png?raw=true\"\n     alt=\"Specified Visualization\"\n     width=\"200px\" />\n\n### Powerful language for working with collections of visualizations:\n\nLux provides a powerful abstraction for working with collections of visualizations based on a partially specified queries. Users can provide a list or a wildcard to iterate over combinations of filter or attribute values and quickly browse through large numbers of visualizations. The partial specification is inspired by existing work on visualization query languages, including [ZQL](http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol10/p457-siddiqui.pdf) and [CompassQL](https://github.com/vega/compassql).\n\nFor example, we are interested in how the `AverageCost` distribution differs across different `Region`s.\n\n```python    \nfrom lux.vis.VisList import VisList\nVisList([\"Region=?\",\"AverageCost\"],df)\n```    \n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/lux-org/lux-resources/blob/master/readme_img/visList.gif?raw=true\"\n     alt=\"Example Vis List\"\n     style=\"width:600px\" />\n\n\nTo find out more about other features in Lux, see the complete documentation on [ReadTheDocs](https://lux-api.readthedocs.io/).\n\n# Installation & Setup\n\n> **Note**: Lux's official package name is `lux-api` (not `lux`). After installing the package, remember to run the setup instructions for your notebook IDE, e.g., [jupyter notebook](#setup-in-jupyter-notebook-vscode-jupyterhub) and [jupyter lab](#setup-in-jupyter-lab).\n\nTo get started, please follow both the installation and setup instructions in your command line.\n`lux-api` can be installed through [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/lux-api/) or [conda-forge](https://github.com/conda-forge/lux-api-feedstock). \n\n```bash\npip install lux-api\n```\n\nIf you use [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/), you can install `lux-api` via:\n\n```bash\nconda install -c conda-forge lux-api\n```\n\nBoth the PyPI and conda installation include includes the Lux Jupyter widget frontend, [lux-widget](https://pypi.org/project/lux-widget/). \n\n## Setup in Jupyter Notebook, VSCode, JupyterHub\n\nTo use Lux with any Jupyter notebook-based frontends (e.g., [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook), [JupyterHub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub), or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support)), activate the notebook extension:\n\n```bash\njupyter nbextension install --py luxwidget\njupyter nbextension enable --py luxwidget\n```\n\nIf the installation happens correctly, you should see two `- Validating: OK` after executing the two lines above.\nNote that you may have to restart the Jupyter Notebook server to ensure that the widget is displaying correctly.\n\n## Setup in Jupyter Lab\n\nLux is compatible with both Jupyter Lab version 2 and 3. To use Lux in [Jupyter Lab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab), activate the lab extension:\n\n```bash\njupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager\njupyter labextension install luxwidget\n```\nNote that JupyterLab and VSCode is supported only for lux-widget version >=0.1.2, if you have an earlier version, please upgrade to the latest version of [lux-widget](https://pypi.org/project/lux-widget/).
