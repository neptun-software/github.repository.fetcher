No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the\ndistribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.\nNotwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a\nContributor:\n\n(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;\n    or\n\n(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's\n    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its\n    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor\n    Version); or\n\n(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of\n    its Contributions.\n\nThis License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,\nor logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with\nthe notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n\n2.4.

Distribution of Source Form\n\nAll distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\nModifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under\nthe terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\nCode Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\nLicense, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\nattempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\nForm.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\nprovided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\nthe Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\nSoftware with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\nCovered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\nLicense permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\nunder the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\nthe Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\nSoftware under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\nLicense(s).\n\n3.4. Notices\n\nYou may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\n(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\nor limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of\nthe Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to\nthe extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n\n3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n\nYou may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\nSoftware. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\nbehalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\nsuch warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\nYou alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\nliability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\ndisclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\njurisdiction.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\nLicense with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to\nstatute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\nthe terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\ndescribe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must\nbe placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered\nSoftware under this License.

Termination\n--------------\n\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically\nif You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become\ncompliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular\nContributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\nContributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\nongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\nnon-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\ncome back into compliance.

          "content": "# Lighter web automation with Python\n\nHelium is a Python library for automating browsers such as Chrome and Firefox.\nFor example:\n\n![Helium Demo](docs/helium-demo.gif)\n\n## Installation\n\nTo get started with Helium, you need Python 3 and Chrome or Firefox.\n\nI would recommend creating a virtual environment. This lets you install Helium\nfor just your current project, instead of globally on your whole computer.\n\nTo create and activate a virtual environment, type the following commands into\na command prompt window:\n\n```bash\npython3 -m venv venv\n# On Mac/Linux:\nsource venv/bin/activate\n# On Windows:\ncall venv\\scripts\\activate.bat\n```\nThen, you can install Helium with `pip`:\n\n```bash\npython -m pip install helium\n```\n\nNow enter `python` into the command prompt and (for instance) the commands in\nthe animation at the top of this page (`from helium import *`, ...).\n\n## Your first script\n\nI've compiled a [cheatsheet](docs/cheatsheet.md) that quickly teaches you all\nyou need to know to be productive with Helium.\n\n## Connection to Selenium\n\nUnder the hood, Helium forwards each call to Selenium. The difference is that\nHelium's API is much more high-level. In Selenium, you need to use HTML IDs,\nXPaths and CSS selectors to identify web page elements. Helium on the other hand\nlets you refer to elements by user-visible labels. As a result, Helium scripts\nare typically 30-50% shorter than similar Selenium scripts. What's more, they\nare easier to read and more stable with respect to changes in the underlying web\npage.\n\nBecause Helium is simply a wrapper around Selenium, you can freely mix the two\nlibraries. For example:\n\n```python\n# A Helium function:\ndriver = start_chrome()\n# A Selenium API:\ndriver.execute_script(\"alert('Hi!');\")\n```\n\nSo in other words, you don't lose anything by using Helium over pure Selenium.\n\nIn addition to its more high-level API, Helium simplifies further tasks that are\ntraditionally painful in Selenium:\n\n- **iFrames:** Unlike Selenium, Helium lets you interact with elements inside\n  nested iFrames, without having to first \"switch to\" the iFrame.\n- **Window management.** Helium notices when popups open or close and focuses /\n  defocuses them like a user would. You can also easily switch to a window by\n  (parts of) its title. No more having to iterate over Selenium window handles.\n- **Implicit waits.** By default, if you try click on an element with Selenium\n  and that element is not yet present on the page, your script fails. Helium by\n  default waits up to 10 seconds for the element to appear.\n- **Explicit waits.** Helium gives you a much nicer API for waiting for a\n  condition on the web page to become true. For example: To wait for an element\n  to appear in Selenium, you would write:\n  ```python\n  element = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(\n      EC.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, \"myDynamicElement\"))\n  )\n  ```\n  With Helium, you can write:\n  ```python\n  wait_until(Button('Download').exists)\n  ```\n\n## Status of this project\n\nI have too little spare time to maintain this project for free. If you'd like\nmy help, please go to my [web site](http://herrmann.io) to ask about my\nconsulting rates. Otherwise, unless it is very easy for me, I will usually not\nrespond to emails or issues on the issue tracker. I will however accept and\nmerge PRs. So if you add some functionality to Helium that may be useful for\nothers, do share it with us by creating a Pull Request. For instructions, please\nsee [Contributing](#Contributing) below.\n\n## How you can help\n\nI find Helium extremely useful in my own projects and feel it should be more\nwidely known. Here's how you can help with this:\n\n- Star this project on GitHub.\n- Tell your friends and colleagues about it.\n- [Share it on Twitter with one click](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=I%20find%20Helium%20very%20useful%20for%20web%20automation%20with%20Python%3A%20https%3A//github.com/mherrmann/helium)\n- Share it on other social media\n- Write a blog post about Helium.\n\nWith this, I think we can eventually make Helium the de-facto standard for web\nautomation in Python.\n\n## Contributing\n\nPull Requests are very welcome. Please follow the same coding conventions as the\nrest of the code, in particular the use of tabs over spaces. Also, read through my\n[PR guidelines](https://gist.github.com/mherrmann/5ce21814789152c17abd91c0b3eaadca).\nDoing this will save you (and me) unnecessary effort.\n\nBefore you submit a PR, ensure that the tests still work:\n\n```bash\npip install -Ur requirements/test.txt\npython setup.py test\n```\n\nThis runs the tests against Chrome. To run them against Firefox, set the\nenvironment variable `TEST_BROWSER` to `firefox`. Eg. on Mac/Linux:\n\n```bash\nTEST_BROWSER=firefox python setup.py test\n```\n\nOn Windows:\n\n```bash\nset TEST_BROWSER=firefox\npython setup.py test\n```\n\nIf you do add new functionality, you should also add tests for it. Please see\nthe [`tests/`](tests) directory for what this might look like.\n\n## History\n\nI (Michael Herrmann) originally developed Helium in 2013 for a Polish IT startup\ncalled BugFree software. (It could be that you have seen Helium before at\nhttps://heliumhq.com.) We shut down the company at the end of 2019 and I felt it\nwould be a shame if Helium simply disappeared from the face of the earth. So I\ninvested some time to modernize it and bring it into a state suitable for open\nsource.\n\nHelium used to be available for both Java and Python. But because I now only\nuse it from Python, I didn't have time to bring the Java implementation up to\nspeed as well. Similarly for Internet Explorer: Helium used to support it, but\nsince I have no need for it, I removed the (probably broken) old implementation.\n\nThe name Helium was chosen because it is also a chemical element like Selenium,\nbut it is lighter.\n"
