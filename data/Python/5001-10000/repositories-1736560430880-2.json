To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\n\n### Section 1 – Definitions.\n\na. __Adapted Material__ means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n\nb. __Adapter's License__ means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\nc. __BY-SA Compatible License__ means a license listed at [creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses](http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses), approved by Creative Commons as essentially the equivalent of this Public License.\n\nd. __Copyright and Similar Rights__ means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\ne. __Effective Technological Measures__ means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.\n\nf. __Exceptions and Limitations__ means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\ng. __License Elements__ means the license attributes listed in the name of a Creative Commons Public License. The License Elements of this Public License are Attribution and ShareAlike.\n\nh. __Licensed Material__ means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.\n\ni. __Licensed Rights__ means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\n\nj. __Licensor__ means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.\n\nk. __Share__ means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.\n\nl. __Sui Generis Database Rights__ means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\n\nm. __You__ means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\n\n### Section 2 – Scope.\n\na. ___License grant.___\n\n    1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\n        A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and\n\n        B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n\n    2. __Exceptions and Limitations.__ For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.\n\n    3. __Term.__ The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).\n\n    4. __Media and formats; technical modifications allowed.__ The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n    5. __Downstream recipients.__\n\n        A. __Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material.__ Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n        B. __Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material.

Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n    2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.\n\n    3.

The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\n\n### Section 6 – Term and Termination.\n\na. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\n\nb. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n    1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\n\n    2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\n\nc.

          "content": "# Welcome!\n\nWhen I first learned Python nearly 27 years ago, I was immediately\nstruck by how I could productively apply it to all sorts of messy work\nprojects. Fast-forward a decade and I found myself teaching others the\nsame fun.  The result of that teaching is this course--A no-nonsense\ntreatment of Python that has been actively taught to more than 400\nin-person groups since 2007.  Traders, systems admins, astronomers,\ntinkerers, and even a few hundred rocket scientists who used Python to\nhelp land a rover on Mars--they've all taken this course. Now, I'm\npleased to make it available under a Creative Commons license--completely\nfree of spam, signups, and other nonsense. Enjoy!\n\n[GitHub Pages](https://dabeaz-course.github.io/practical-python) | [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/dabeaz-course/practical-python).\n\n--David Beazley ([https://dabeaz.com](https://dabeaz.com)), [@dabeaz](https://mastodon.social/@dabeaz)\n\n(P.S. This course is about Python. If you want a Python course that's about programming,\nyou might consider [Advanced Programming with Python](https://www.dabeaz.com/advprog.html))\n\n## What is This?\n\nThe material you see here is the heart of an instructor-led Python\ntraining course used for corporate training and professional\ndevelopment. It was in continual development from 2007 to 2019 and\nbattle tested in real-world classrooms.  Usually, it's taught\nin-person over the span of three or four days--requiring approximately\n25-35 hours of intense work. This includes the completion of\napproximately 130 hands-on coding exercises.\n\n## Target Audience\n\nStudents of this course are usually professional scientists,\nengineers, and programmers who already have experience in at least one\nother programming language. No prior knowledge of Python is required,\nbut knowledge of common programming topics is assumed.  Most\nparticipants find the course challenging--even if they've already been\ndoing a bit of Python programming.\n\n## Course Objectives\n\nThe goal of this course is to cover foundational aspects of Python\nprogramming with an emphasis on script writing, basic data manipulation, and\nprogram organization.  By the end of this course, students should be\nable to start writing useful Python programs on their own or be able\nto understand and modify Python code written by their\ncoworkers.\n\n## Requirements\n\nTo complete this course, you need nothing more than a basic\ninstallation of Python 3.6 or newer and time to work on it.\n\n## What This Course is Not\n\nThis is not a course for absolute beginners on how to program a\ncomputer.  It is assumed that you already have programming experience\nin some other programming language or Python itself.\n\nThis is not a course on web development.  That's a different\ncircus. However, if you stick around for this circus, you'll still see\nsome interesting acts--just nothing involving animals.\n\nThis is not a course on using tools that happen to be written\nin Python. It's about learning the core Python language.\n\nThis is not a course for software engineers on how to write or\nmaintain a one-million line Python application. I don't write programs\nlike that, nor do most companies who use Python, and neither should\nyou. Delete something already!\n\n## Take me to the Course Already!\n\nOk, ok. Point your browser [HERE](Notes/Contents.md)!\n\n## Community Discussion\n\nWant to discuss the course?  You can join the conversation on\n[Gitter](https://gitter.im/dabeaz-course/practical-python).  I can't\npromise an individual response, but perhaps others can jump in to help.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nLlorenç Muntaner was instrumental in converting the course content from\nApple Keynote to the online structure that you see here.\n\nVarious instructors have presented this course at one time or another\nover the last 12 years. This includes (in alphabetical order): Ned\nBatchelder, Juan Pablo Claude, Mark Fenner, Michael Foord, Matt\nHarrison, Raymond Hettinger, Daniel Klein, Travis Oliphant, James\nPowell, Michael Selik, Hugo Shi, Ian Stokes-Rees, Yarko Tymciurak,\nBryan Van de ven, Peter Wang, and Mark Wiebe.\n\nI'd also like to thank the thousands of students who have taken this\ncourse and contributed to its success with their feedback and\ndiscussion.\n\n## Questions and Answers\n\n### Q: Are there course videos I can watch?\n\nNo. This course is about you writing Python code, not watching someone else.\n\n### Q: How is this course licensed?\n\nPractical Python Programming is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike 4.0 International License.\n\n### Q: May I use this material to teach my own Python course?\n\nYes, as long as appropriate attribution is given.\n\n### Q: May I make derivative works?\n\nYes, as long as such works carry the same license terms and provide attribution.\n\n### Q: Can I translate this to another language?\n\nYes, that would be awesome.  Send me a link when you're done.\n\n### Q: Can I live-stream the course or make a video?\n\nYes, go for it!  You'll probably learn a lot of Python doing that.\n\n### Q: Why wasn't topic X covered?\n\nThere is only so much material that you can cover in 3-4 days.  If\nit wasn't covered, it was probably because it was once covered and it\ncaused everyone's head to explode or there was never enough time to\ncover it in the first place.   Also, this is a course, not a Python\nreference manual.\n\n### Q: Why isn't awesome `{command}` in awesome `{tool}` covered?\n\nThe focus of this course is on learning the core Python language,\nnot learning the names of commands in tools.\n\n### Q: Is this course being maintained or updated?\n\nThis course represents a \"finished product\" that was taught and\ndeveloped for more than decade.  I have no plans to significantly\nrevise the material at this time, but will occasionally fix bugs and\nadd clarification.\n\n### Q: Do you accept pull requests?\n\nBug reports are appreciated and may be filed through the\n[issue tracker](https://github.com/dabeaz-course/practical-python/issues).\nPull requests are not accepted except by invitation. Please file an issue first.\n\n"
