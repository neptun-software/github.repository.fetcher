By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12.

          "content": "# Notes on Major Changes in Releases\n\n## Version 1.1.15\n\n* Solaar supports configuration of Bluetooth devices on macOS.\n\n## Version 1.1.13\n\n* Solaar will drop support for Python 3.7 immediately after version 1.1.13.\n\n* Version 1.1.12 does not push settings to many devices after a resume resulting in the device reverting to its default behaviour.  This is fixed in 1.1.13.\n\n## Version 1.1.12\n\n* Solaar now processes DBus disconnection and connection messages from Bluez and re-initializes devices when they reconnect, to handle to a change introduced in Bluez 5.73. The HID++ driver does not re-initialize devices, which causes problems with smooth scrolling. Until the issue is resolved having Scroll Wheel Resolution set to true (and not ignored) may be helpful.\n\n* The credits for translations have not been kept up to date.  Translators who are not listed can update docs/i18n.ml and lib/solaar/ui/about.py.\n\n* Solaar now has settings for features BRIGHTNESS_CONTROL, RGB_EFFECTS, and PER_KEY_LIGHTING features.  The names of keys in the Per-key Lighting setting are for the standard US keyboard.  Users who wish to modify these names should look at the section Keyboard Key Names and Locations in `https://pwr-solaar.github.io/Solaar/capabilities`\n\n* A unit test test suite is being constructed using pytest.\n\n* The Solaar code for communicating with receivers and devices has been significantly modified to improve testability and organization.  Errors may have been introduced for uncommon hardware.\n\n* The Later rule action uses precision timing for delays of less than one second.\n\n* Solaar now indentifies supported devices by whether they support the HID protocols that Solaar needs.  If a device does not show up at all when running Solaar, it almost certainly cannot be supported by Solaar.\n\n## Version 1.1.11\n\n* Solaar can dump device profiles in YAMLfor devices that support profiles and load profiles back from an edited file.  See [the capabilities page](https://pwr-solaar.github.io/Solaar/capabilities) for more information.\n\n* Solaar has settings for each LED Zone that a device supports under feature Color LED Effects.\n\n* Solaar has settings for extended report rate, backlight levels, durations, and profile selection.\n\n* Solaar now partly works in MacOS.  Please open new issues for problems.  Solaar may work in Windows.   Please open new issues for problems.  See https://github.com/pwr-Solaar/Solaar/pull/1971 for more information.  Fixing problems in MacOS or Windows may take considerable time.\n\n* Solaar works better when the Python package hid-parser is available.   Distriubtions should try have this package installed.\n\n## Version 1.1.10\n\n* The mouse click rule action can now just simulate depressing or releasing the button.\n\n* There is a new rule condition to check the hostname.\n\n## Version 1.1.9\n\n* Solaar now exits with at 0 exit code when killed.\n\n* Two Solaar settings can interfere with the implementation of smooth scrolling in modern Linux HID++ drivers.  These settings are initially set to ignore so that this interference does not happen.\n\n* The Device rule condition checks for the device that produced a notification.\n\n* The KeyIsDown rule condition checks whether a *diverted* rule key is down.\n\n## Version 1.1.8\n\n* The thumb wheel rule conditions take an optional parameter that checks for total signed thumb wheel movement.\n\n## Version 1.1.7\n\n* Solaar responds to scroll wheel ratchet notifications by changing its scroll wheel ratcheting.\n\n* Solaar processing of report descriptors is optional, depending on whether the package hid-parser is available.\n\n## Version 1.1.6\n\n* Solaar requires Python version 3.7.\n\n* Solaar uses report descriptors to recognize unknown devices that use HID++.\n\n* The Later rule action takes an integer delay in seconds and one or more rule components.  The action immediately completes while also scheduling the rule components for later exection.\n\n## Version 1.1.5\n\n* The Active rule condition takes the serial number or unitID of a device and checks whether the device is active.  A device is active if it is connected (via a receiver, USB or Bluetooth), not turned off, and not in a power-saving state.  This condition can be used to check whether changing a setting on the device will have any effect, as devices respond to messages only when active.\n\n* Solaar logs warnings and errors to a file in the user's temporary file directory.  This file is deleted when Solaar exists normally.  If Solaar is run with `-dd` or `-ddd` informational messages are also logged in the file.\n\n* If the first element of a Mouse Gesture rule condition is a key or button name then that name must be the same as the name of the key or button that initiated the mouse gesture.\n\n* The Sliding DPI and Mouse Gestures are now set up using the Key/Button Diversion setting.   Changing a key or button to Sliding DPI makes it initiate the sliding DPI changing.  Changing a key or button to Mouse Gestures makes it initiate a mouse gesture.  There can be multiple keys or buttons for sliding DPI and multiple keys or buttons for mouse gestures.\n\n* Solaar waits a few seconds to save settings changes to its configuration file.  If you interrupt Solaar soon after changing a setting the change might not be saved.\n\n\n## Version 1.1.4\n\n* There are settings for sidetone and equalizer gains for headsets.\n\n* The KeyPress action can now either deppress, release, or click (default) keys.\n\n* The KeyPress action now inserts shift and level 3 keypresses if simulating a key symbol requires one or both of them.  So producing a \"B\" no longer requires adding a shift keysymbol.\n\n## Version 1.1.3\n\n* Solaar uses yaml for configuration files, converting the json configuration file to yaml if necessary.\n\n* Solaar rules work better under Wayland but still cannot access the current process nor the current keyboard modifiers.\n\n* Solaar uses uinput for simulating input in Wayland.  See https://pwr-solaar.github.io/Solaar/rules for instructions on setting up uinput correctly.\n\n## Version 1.1.2\n\n* Solaar now depends on Python evdev.  It can be installed if needed via `pip install --user evdev` or, in most distributions, by installing the python3-evdev package.\n\n* Solaar rules partly work under Wayland.  There is no access to the current process in Wayland.  Simulated input uses uinput if XTest extension not available, requiring read and write permissions on /dev/uinput.\n\n* There is a setting to divert gestures so that they can trigger rules.\n\n* There is a setting to disable Onboard Profiles, which can interfere with the Polling Rate and M-Key LEDs settings.  The Polling Rate setting no longer disables onboard profiles.\n\n* There is a setting for the Persistent Remappable Keys feature.\n\n* There is a new rule condition that tests device settings.\n\n* There are new settings to set M-Key LEDs and MR-Key LED.\n\n* There is a new kind of Solaar rule action to change settings for devices.\n\n## Version 1.1.1\n\n* There is a new setting to switch keyboard crowns between smooth and ratchet scrolling.\n\n## Version 1.1.0\n\n* Solaar now supports Bolt receivers and devices that connect to them, including authentication of devices when pairing.\n\n* A setting has been added for the DPI CHANGE button to switch movement sensitivity.\n\n## Version 1.0.7\n\n* Solaar rules can now trigger on both pressing and releasing a diverted key.\n\n* The new rule condition MouseProcess is like the Process condition except for the process of the window under the mouse.\n\n* Mouse gestures have been upgraded.  A mouse gesture is now a sequence of movements separated by no movement periods while the mouse gesture button is held down.  The MouseGesture rule condition matches mouse gesture sequences.  The old mouse-up, etc., tests are converted to MouseGesture conditions.\n\n## Version 1.0.6\n\n* The sliding DPI setting now looks for suitable keys to use to trigger its effects.\n\n* If a mouse has a suitable button it can generate mouse gestures, which trigger rule processing.  Mouse gestures need to be turned on and the button diverted to produce mouse gestures.\n\n* Settings can now be ignored by clicking on the icon at the right-hand edge of a setting until the dialog error icon (usually a red icon) appears.   Solaar will not try to restore the value for an ignored setting.\n\n* Icon handling in the tray and the tray menu has been updated to work better with some system tray implementations.\n\n* The process rule condition also matches against the current X11 WM_CLASS.\n\n* The SMART SHIFT ENHANCED feature is supported.\n\n## Version 1.0.5\n\n* Solaar has rules that can perform actions such as pressing keys or scrolling when certain HID++ feature notifications happen.  Users can change these rules either by editing ~/.config/solaar/rules.yaml or via a GUI.  Rules depend on X11 and so are only available under X11.  This is an experimental feature for Solaar and may undergo changes in the future.\n\n* Each setting has a clickable lock icon that determines whether the setting can be changed.\n\n## Version 1.0.4\n\n* Devices that connect directly via Bluetooth or USB are now supported.  These devices show up in the GUI as separate lines, not under a receiver.  A device that is directly connected and also paired to a receiver will show up twice, but the entry under the receiver will not be active.  With this change identifying devices becomes more difficult so occasionally check your Solaar configuration file (at ~/.config/solaar/config.json) to see that there is only one entry for each of your devices.\n\n* There are new settings for gestures, thumb wheels,  adjusting the wheel ratchet behavior, and changing DPI using a DPI Switch button.\n\n* Solaar's Udev rule now adds seat permissions for all Logitech devices.  Users who install Solaar themselves will have to install the new Udev rule and activate the rule.  One way to do this is to restart the user's computer.\n\n## Version 1.0.3\n\n* The separate deprecated solaar-cli command has been removed.\n\n* Devices can be switched between hosts using the Change Host setting.  The device will try to connect to the other host.  Some devices will detect that there is no active host on the other connections and reconnect back.\n\n## Version 1.0.2\n\n* The separate unneeded solaar-gnome3 command has been removed.  The packaging directories have been removed.\n\n* Non-unifying receivers are modelled better.  Many of them cannot unpair but instead new pairings replace existing pairings.\n\n* Battery icon selection has been simplified.\n"
