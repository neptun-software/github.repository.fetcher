By default it deploys the Home Assistant Supervisor as a container. Home Assistant Supervisor in turn uses the Docker container engine to control Home Assistant Core and Add-Ons in separate containers. Home Assistant Operating System is **not** based on a regular Linux distribution like Ubuntu. It is built using [Buildroot](https://buildroot.org/) and it is optimized to run Home Assistant. It targets single board compute (SBC) devices like the Raspberry Pi or ODROID but also supports x86-64 systems with UEFI.\n\n[![Home Assistant - A project from the Open Home Foundation](https://www.openhomefoundation.org/badges/home-assistant.png)](https://www.openhomefoundation.org/)\n\n## Features\n\n- Lightweight and memory-efficient\n- Minimized I/O\n- Over The Air (OTA) updates\n- Offline updates\n- Modular using Docker container engine\n\n## Supported hardware\n\n- Nabu Casa\n- Raspberry Pi\n- Hardkernel ODROID\n- Asus Tinker Board\n- Generic x86-64 (e.g. Intel NUC)\n- Virtual appliances\n\nSee the full list and specific models [here](./Documentation/boards/README.md)\n\n## Getting Started\n\nIf you just want to use Home Assistant the official [getting started guide](https://www.home-assistant.io/getting-started/) and [installation instructions](https://www.home-assistant.io/hassio/installation/) take you through how to download Home Assistant Operating System and get it running on your machine.\n\nIf you're interested in finding out more about Home Assistant Operating System and how it works read on...\n\n## Development\n\nIf you don't have experience with embedded systems, Buildroot or the build process for Linux distributions it is recommended to read up on these topics first (e.g. [Bootlin](https://bootlin.com/docs/) has excellent resources).\n\nThe Home Assistant Operating System documentation can be found on the [Home Assistant Developer Docs website](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/operating-system).\n\n### Components\n\n- **Bootloader:**\n  - [GRUB](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/) for devices that support UEFI\n  - [U-Boot](https://www.denx.de/wiki/U-Boot) for devices that don't support UEFI\n- **Operating System:**\n  - [Buildroot](https://buildroot.org/) LTS Linux\n- **File Systems:**\n  - [SquashFS](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/squashfs.txt) for read-only file systems (using LZ4 compression)\n  - [ZRAM](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/blockdev/zram.txt) for `/tmp`, `/var` and swap (using LZ4 compression)\n- **Container Platform:**\n  - [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) for running Home Assistant components in containers\n- **Updates:**\n  - [RAUC](https://rauc.io/) for Over The Air (OTA) and USB updates\n- **Security:**\n  - [AppArmor](https://apparmor.net/) Linux kernel security module\n\n### Development builds\n\nThe Development build GitHub Action Workflow is a manually triggered workflow\nwhich creates Home Assistant OS development builds. The development builds are\navailable at [https://os-artifacts.home-assistant.io/index.html](https://os-artifacts.home-assistant.io/index.html).\n"
