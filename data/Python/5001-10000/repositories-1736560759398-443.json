          "content": "Jupytext ChangeLog\n==================\n\n1.16.6 (2024-12-16)\n-------------------\n\n**Fixed**\n- We fixed a \"File Changed\" warning when saving notebooks ([#1301](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1301))\n\n**Changed**\n- The original file name is easier to infer from the tmp file name in pre-commit hooks ([#1289](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1289)) - thanks to [Lunin Leonid](https://github.com/lrlunin) for making this change.\n\n\n1.16.5 (2024-12-15)\n-------------------\n\n**Fixed**\n- We have fixed a notebook corruption issue when using Jupytext with Jupyter-Collaboration ([#1124](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1124), [jupyter-collaboration 214](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyter-collaboration/issues/214)).\n- We have added the `require_hash` argument on the Jupytext contents manager. The hash of a paired file is the concatenation of the hash of the text file and the hash for the `.ipynb` file ([#1165](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1165))\n- The `rst2md` tests have been fixed by requiring `sphinx<8` ([#1266](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1266))\n- Some dependencies of the JupyterLab extensions were updated ([#1272](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1272), [#1273](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1273), [#1280](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1280), [#1285](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1285), [#1290](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1290))\n- The pre-commit hook is now compatible with log.showsignature=True ([#1281](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1281)). Thanks to [Justin Lecher](https://github.com/jlec) for this fix.\n\n**Added**\n- Jupytext is now tested with Python 3.13 ([#1242](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1242)). Thanks to [Jerry James](https://github.com/jamesjer) for the suggested fixes!\n- The extension of a notebook piped into stdin will be taken in the notebook metadata ([#1282](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1282))\n\n\n1.16.4 (2024-07-12)\n-------------------\n\n**Fixed**\n- We use `asyncio.iscoroutinefunction` to determine whether the current contents manager is sync or async ([#1260](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1260))\n\n\n1.16.3 (2024-07-09)\n-------------------\n\n**Fixed**\n- We use `inspect` to determine whether the current contents manager derives from `AsyncContentsManager` (which is not\nsupported by Jupytext at the moment). This fixes a compatibility issue with `jupyter-fs==1.0.0` ([#1239](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1239)). Thanks to [Mahendra Paipuri](https://github.com/mahendrapaipuri) for this PR!\n- We have fixed a typo when `build_jupytext_contents_manager_class` can't be imported ([#1162](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1162))\n- A Python 3.13 deprecation warning was fixed [#1241](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/pull/1241) - thanks to [Jerry James](https://github.com/jamesjer)\n- We have fixed a typo when `build_jupytext_contents_manager_class` can't be imported ([#1162](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1162))\n- Some dependencies of the JupyterLab extensions were updated ([#1243](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1243), [#1245](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1245))\n\n**Added**\n- Lua notebooks are now supported ([#1252](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/pull/1252)) - thanks to [erentar](https://github.com/erentar) for this contribution\n- Go notebooks are supported too ([#1244](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1244))! Many thanks to [Jan Pfeifer](https://github.com/janpfeifer), author of [GoNB](https://github.com/janpfeifer/gonb), and to [HaveF](https://github.com/HaveF) for their help on this topic.\n- Empty prefixes are now allowed in Jupytext format when specified as a dictionary ([#1144](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1144))\n\n**Changed**\n- We've had to deactivate the tests on the Quarto format in the CI as the Quarto round trip\nmight now add a Markdown cell to the notebook ([#1255](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1255))\n\n\n1.16.2 (2024-05-05)\n-------------------\n\n**Added**\n- Added support for Xonsh notebooks ([#1213](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/pull/1213)) - thanks to [Jeffrey Odongo](https://github.com/jsquaredosquared) for this contribution\n\n**Changed**\n- By default, the JupyterLab extension for Jupytext is not included in the build (set `HATCH_BUILD_HOOKS_ENABLE=true` to include it). This simplifies the installation of Jupytext in pre-commit hooks ([#1210](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1210))\n- Temporary text notebooks for the `--pipe` or `--check` commands are now created in the notebook directory ([#1206](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1206))\n- Jupytext uses the standard library `tomllib` in Python 3.11, or `tomli` in Python 3.10 or older, to match JupyterLab's dependencies ([#1195](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1195))\n- The dependencies of the JupyterLab extension were updated ([#1216](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1216), [#1218](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1218), [#1231](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1231))\n- `jupytext --sync` will not update the timestamp of text notebooks if their content is unchanged ([#1215](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1215))\n\n\n**Fixed**\n- Jupytext is now tested with `pandoc>=3.0`. Please note that switching to `pandoc>=3.0` will add cell ids to your `pandoc:md` notebooks ([#1006](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1006))\n\n\n1.16.1 (2024-01-13)\n-------------------\n\n**Changed**\n- The CI has been updated. Thanks to [Christian Le](https://github.com/LecrisUT) for taking care of this! ([#1190](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1190), [#1204](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1204))\n\n**Fixed**\n- Fixed an issue about unpairing notebooks from the Jupytext Menu ([#1197](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1197))\n- JupyterLab's dependency `follow-redirects` was updated from 1.15.3 to 1.15.4 ([#1203](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1203))\n\n\n1.16.0 (2023-12-03)\n-------------------\n\n**Added**\n- The Jupytext Menu is back! And text notebooks can be created directly from the launcher. This is an outstanding contribution by [Mahendra Paipuri](https://github.com/mahendrapaipuri) ([#1154](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1154), [#1163](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1163)). This requires JupyterLab 4.x or Jupyter Notebook 7.x.\n\n**Changed**\n- Jupytext is now configured with `pyproject.toml` and built with `hatch`. The layout has been reorganised to follow `src-layout` ([#1140](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1140)). This is another outstanding contribution by [Mahendra Paipuri](https://github.com/mahendrapaipuri).\n- The tests are now part of the `sdist`. They have been reorganized into unit/functional/integration/external ([#1167](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1167), [#1173](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1173)).\n- The legacy extension for Jupyter Notebook <=6 (the Jupytext Menu) has been removed.\n\n**Fixed**\n- The bibliography section in Rmd files does not become a code cell anymore ([#1161](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1161))\n- Commented code in `active-py` cells is not uncommented anymore ([#1131](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1131))\n- The test coverage has been restored ([#1167](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1167), [#1173](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1173))\n- We test Jupytext against the pre-release version of JupyterLab, and other dependencies ([#1168](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1168))\n\n\n1.15.2 (2023-09-16)\n-------------------\n\n**Added**\n- The Jupyter Lab extension is now compatible with the [JupyterLab RISE](https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/rise) extension. Many thanks to [Frédéric Collonval](https://github.com/fcollonval) for his PR ([#1126](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/pull/1126))!\n\n\n1.15.1 (2023-08-26)\n-------------------\n\n**Added**\n- We have added a new command line interface `jupytext-config` that you can use to set Jupytext as the default viewer for text notebooks in Jupyter Lab and Jupyter Notebook 7. Thanks to [Thierry Parmentelat](https://github.com/parmentelat) for this contribution! ([#1094](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/pull/1094))\n\n\n1.15.0 (2023-07-30)\n-------------------\n\n**Changed**\n- This version comes with a version of the JupyterLab extension that is compatible with JupyterLab 4.x. Many thanks to [Thierry Parmentelat](https://github.com/parmentelat) for his PRs! ([#1092](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/pull/1092), [#1109](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/pull/1109))\n- Pandoc 3.0 is now supported, thanks to [Raniere Silva](https://github.com/rgaiacs) for his PR ([#1099](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/pull/1099))\n- We have reorganized the documentation and the README.md ([#1031](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1031), [#1073](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1073))\n- Invalid `pyproject.toml` files will be ignored by Jupytext in Jupyter ([#1103](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1103))\n- We have updated the pre-commit tools\n\n\n1.14.7 (2023-06-29)\n-------------------\n\n**Changed**\n- We have updated the GitHub workflows - thanks to Matthew Feickert and to Cristian Le for their help on this subject ([#1037](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1037))\n- We have removed the upper bound on `markdown-it-py<3`. Now we test Jupytext with `markdown-it-py` in versions `2.x` and `3.x` on the CI ([#1075](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1075))\n\n**Fixed**\n- Notebooks with an empty YAML header work ([#1070](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1070))\n- Double quote strings in R Markdown options can contain single quotes ([#1079](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1079))\n- The necessary directories are created when paired notebooks are moved to a sub-folder ([#1059](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1059))\n- Commented quotes are recognized as such ([#1060](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1060))\n- Jupytext can use either `pkg_resources` or `packaging` to parse version numbers ([#1085](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1085))\n\n\n1.14.6 (2023-06-04)\n-------------------\n\n**Changed**\n- This version comes with a build requirement `jupyterlab>=3,<4`, as the Jupyterlab\nextension for Jupytext is not compatible with JupyterLab 4 yet ([#1054](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1054))\n- The JupyterLab extension was released to `npm` in version 1.3.9.\n\n\n1.14.5 (2023-02-25)\n-------------------\n\n**Added**\n- Added Stata as a supported language ([#1027](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/pull/1027)) - thanks to [Raffaele Mancuso](https://github.com/raffaem) for this contribution\n- Added SAS as a supported language ([#1047](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/pull/1047)) - thanks to [lawrencet149](https://github.com/lawrencet149) for this contribution\n- We have added a series of test to make sure that the main formats support cell tags ([#1024](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1024))\n\n**Fixed**\n- When a metadata key is not a valid identifier, a warning is emitted and the metadata is not saved to the text representation ([#1042](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1042))\n- The CI was fixed by [Matthew Feickert](https://github.com/matthewfeickert) ([#1035](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/pull/1035))\n- We now use `concurrency` to cancel previous runs on the same branch/PR ([#1037](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1037))\n- We use both `codecov.notify.after_n_builds` and `comment.after_n_builds` to get only the final codecov comment\n\n**Changed**\n- Empty tags are not exported to the text notebook anymore ([#960](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/960))\n- We updated the `yarn.lock` file for the jupyter lab extension to address security vulnerabilities ([#1030](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1030), [#1036](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1036))\n- In the pre-commit tests we now use `main` for the main branch\n\n\n1.14.4 (2022-12-11)\n-------------------\n\n**Added**\n- Added Wolfram Language as a supported language ([#1014](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1014)) - thanks to [Etienne Dechamps](https://github.com/dechamps) for this contribution\n\n\n1.14.3 (2022-12-11)\n-------------------\n\n**Fixed**\n- When the default contents manager is _async_ (i.e. `jupyter_server>=2.0.0`), the Jupyter server extension for Jupytext derives a contents manager from `LargeFileManager` instead, as async contents managers are not supported by Jupytext at the moment ([#1020](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1020))\n- We have made adjustments on the CI as flake8 was moved to GitHub, and Python 3.6 is not available anymore on `ubuntu-latest`\n\n\n1.14.2 (2022-11-12)\n-------------------\n\n**Fixed**\n- The sample notebooks have been normalized with `nbformat.validator.normalize` ([#1002](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1002)).\n- The warnings in the test suite that we cannot fix are filtered using a new `pytest.ini` file\n- We updated the `yarn.lock` file for the jupyter lab extension to address security vulnerabilities ([#984](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/984), [#1005](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1005), [#1011](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/1011))\n\n**Changed**\n- The CI uses Python 3.9 rather than 3.7 when testing conda environments\n\n**Added**\n- Gnuplot is now supported ([#998](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/998)) - thanks to [razimantv](https://github.com/razimantv) for this contribution\n- We now test Jupytext against Python 3.6 to 3.11 on the CI\n- We have added a test to document how to use the folder and prefix matching when pairing notebooks ([#974](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/974))\n\n\n1.14.1 (2022-07-29)\n-------------------\n\n**Fixed**\n- The timestamp of a paired notebook is the timestamp of the most recent paired file. This fixes the warning \"File Changed\"\nafter reloading the notebook in Jupyter ([#978](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/978)).\n\n\n1.14.0 (2022-07-03)\n-------------------\n\n**Changed**\n- The Jupytext configuration file has a new option `cm_config_log_level` that defaults to `info_if_changed`.\nWith that value, the contents manager will log a line regarding the configuration file used only when the\nconfig file is not the same as the one previously used ([#959](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/959)) -\nmany thanks to R.C. Thomas for suggesting this and thoughtfully testing the patch.\n- Hidden configuration files like `.jupytext.toml` or `.jupytext.py` are now ignored by Jupytext's contents manager\nwhen `allow_hidden=False` (that option was introduced in `jupyter_server==2.0.0a1`) ([#964](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/964)).\n- We have changed `jupytext --set-formats` to make it more similar to `jupytext --sync`. Now `--set-formats` will not\noverride existing paired files anymore ([#969](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/969)).\n\n**Added**\n- We have added a test `test_pre_commit_hook_sync_with_no_config` that documents how to use the pre-commit hook without\na configuration file ([#967](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/967))\n\n1.13.8 (2022-04-04)\n-------------------\n\n**Fixed**\n- Text-only notebooks are always trusted (as they don't include any output cells) ([#941](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/941))\n- We made sure that our tests also work in absence of a Python kernel ([#906](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/906))\n- The coverage of the `tests` folder has been restored at 100%\n- Bash commands like `!{cmd}` are now correctly escaped in the `py:percent` format ([#938](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/938))\n\n**Added**\n- Added Tcl as a supported language ([#930](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/930)) - thanks to [shishitao](https://github.com/shishitao) for this contribution\n- Added Maxima as a supported language ([#927](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/927)) - thanks to [Alberto Lusiani](https://github.com/alusiani) for contributing a sample Maxima notebook.\n\n**Changed**\n- The Jupytext contents manager is derived from the `LargeFileManager` imported from `jupyter_server` rathen than `notebook` ([#933](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/933))\n- Allow for markdown-it-py v2 ([#924](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/924))\n- We have updated the hooks used in the test pre-commits, to fix an issue on the CI ([#940](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/940), [#942](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/942))\n- We updated the `yarn.lock` file for the jupyter lab extension to address security vulnerabilities ([#904](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/904), [#925](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/925), [#935](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/935), [#939](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/939))\n\n\n1.13.7 (2022-02-09)\n-------------------\n\n**Fixed**\n- The Jupytext CLI only suggest `--update` when the target is an .ipynb file ([#905](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/905)) - thanks to [st--](https://github.com/st--) for this contribution\n- We made sure that commands like `cat notebook.md | jupytext --execute` work ([#908](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/908))\n\n**Added**\n- Added Haskell as supported language ([#909](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/909)) - thanks to [codeweber](https://github.com/codeweber) for this contribution\n\n**Changed**\n- We have updated the pre-commit hooks and in particular we switched to the first stable version of `black==22.1.0`.\n- We require `pandoc==2.16.2` for testing. The representation for code cells changed from ` ``` {.python}` to ` ``` python` in that version of Pandoc ([#906](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/906)). We don't use `pandoc>=2.17` in tests at the moment because of the introduction of cell ids that cannot be filtered.\n- Jupytext will not add anymore a UTF-8 encoding on Python scripts when the notebook contains non-ascii characters ([#907](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/907))\n- We have added `pyupgrade` to the pre-commit hooks used for developing Jupytext ([#907](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/907))\n\n\n1.13.6 (2022-01-11)\n-------------------\n\n**Fixed**\n- The `text_representation` metadata of text notebooks is filtered from `.ipynb` files both in `jupytext.write` and in the contents manager for Jupyter ([#900](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/900))\n\n**Changed**\n- Jupytext will not issue a warning when a format suffix starting with '.', '-' or '_' is passed to the `--to` option ([#901](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/901))\n\n\n1.13.5 (2021-12-27)\n-------------------\n\n**Fixed**\n- Jupytext will not open a text notebook that is not UTF-8 ([#896](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/896))\n\n\n1.13.4 (2021-12-12)\n-------------------\n\n**Changed**\n- The test suite filters the warnings that don't belong to Jupytext ([#823](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/823))\n\n**Fixed**\n- The parsing of notebooks that don't have a YAML header (like `docs/formats.md`) was improved.\n- The test suite works with `pytest-randomly` ([#838](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/838))\n\n\n1.13.3 (2021-12-04)\n-------------------\n\n**Changed**\n- The \"Jupytext Notebook\" factory that lets the user configure the Notebook viewer as the default for text notebooks accepts more filetypes: \"myst\", \"r-markdown\" and \"quarto\" ([#803](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/803))\n- Empty MyST Markdown files are valid notebooks ([#883](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/883))\n- Jupytext also works with `markdown-it-py` v2.0 ([#885](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/885))\n\n\n1.13.2 (2021-11-30)\n-------------------\n\n**Changed**\n- The extension for Jupyter Lab benefited from a series of improvements contributed by [Frédéric Collonval](https://github.com/fcollonval):\n  - A new \"Jupytext Notebook\" factory offers the option to open text notebooks directly with the notebook view ([#803](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/803)). To use it, follow the instructions in the [documentation](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/blob/main/docs/index.md#Install).\n  - The ICommandPalette is optional, for compatibility with RISE within JupyterLab [RISE[#605](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/605)](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE/pull/605)\n  - Added support for translation\n- Branch `master` was renamed to `main` (links in the documentation were updated)\n\n\n1.13.1 (2021-10-07)\n-------------------\n\n**Fixed**\n- The magic commands in `py:percent` scripts with no explicit format information remain commented over a round trip ([#848](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/848))\n\n\n1.13.0 (2021-09-25)\n-------------------\n\n**Added**\n- The Jupytext CLI has a new `--diff` command to show the differences between two notebooks (and if you want to see the changes in a file being updated by Jupytext, use `--show-changes`) ([#799](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/799))\n- Jupyter will show the diff between text and `ipynb` paired notebooks when it cannot open a paired notebook because the `ipynb` version is more recent. Also, if the inputs in the two files are identical then the notebook will open with no error ([#799](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/799))\n- The `py:percent` format will use raw strings when encoding Markdown cells as string, if they contain backslash characters ([#836](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/836))\n\n**Fixed**\n- We have upgraded the jupyterlab extension dependencies and especially `ansi-regex` to fix a security vulnerability ([#857](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/857))\n\n**Changed**\n- The Jupytext configuration file is reloaded only when a notebook is opened, saved, or when a different folder is explored ([#797](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/797))\n\n\n1.12.0 (2021-09-09)\n-------------------\n\n**Added**\n- Jupytext supports Quarto notebooks (with `.qmd` extension) ([#837](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/837))\n- Jupytext can be configured through the `pyproject.toml` file. Thanks to Robin Brown for this contribution! ([#828](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/828))\n- Jupytext now supports OCaml files with `.ml` extension. Thanks to Quentin Fortier for getting this started ([#832](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/832))\n\n**Fixed**\n- Added more test to make sure that notebooks can be trusted. In practice, notebooks could not be trusted in JupyterLab<3.0.13 because of the absence of cell ids ([#826](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/826))\n\n\n1.11.5 (2021-08-31)\n-------------------\n\n**Fixed**\n- Fixed typos revealed by `codespell` - thanks to @hectormz for this contribution ([#829](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/829))\n- We updated the dependencies of the `jupyterlab-jupytext` extension to address several security issues ([#842](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/842)) ([#843](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/843))\n- The Jupytext dev environment (`requirements-dev.txt`) now uses `jupyterlab==3.0.17` rather than `3.0.0` because of another security issue ([#839](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/839))\n\n\n1.11.4 (2021-07-14)\n-------------------\n\n**Changed**\n- The documentation illustrates how the `cell_markers` option (and the other ones) can be set directly in the `jupytext.toml` config file ([#809](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/809)).\n- The dependency on `mdit-py-plugins` through `markdown-it-py[plugins]` was made explicit ([#814](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/814))\n\n**Fixed**\n- System assigns of the form `var = !cmd` are commented out ([#816](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/816))\n- Fixed an `InconsistentPath` issue with notebooks paired with scripts in a folder. The prefix in the Jupytext formats always use /, while paths might use either / or \\ ([#806](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/806))\n- Tests that cannot succeed are skipped when either the Jupytext folder is not a git repository, when `sphinx-gallery` is too recent, or when `pandoc` is not up-to-date ([#814](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/814))\n- Removed the mention of '--update' in 'jupytext --pipe' since outputs are preserved already\n\n\n1.11.3 (2021-06-10)\n-------------------\n\n**Changed**\n- Jupytext CLI has a new option `--use-source-timestamp` that sets the last modification time of the output file equal to that of the source file (this avoids having to change the timestamp of the source file) ([#784](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/784))\n- In the pre-commit mode, Jupytext now uses the commit timestamp to determine which file in the pair is the most recent ([#780](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/780))\n\n\n**Fixed**\n- Dependencies of the JupyterLab extension have been upgraded to fix a security vulnerability ([#798](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/pull/798))\n- The `--warn-only` option also applies to pipes. Use this if the pipe may fail, e.g. if you apply `black` on a possibly invalid script ([#781](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/781))\n- Variables assigned from a magic command are commented out in `py` scripts ([#781](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/781))\n- Fixed a round-trip issue on notebooks that have None/null in their metadata ([#792](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/792))\n\n\n1.11.2 (2021-05-02)\n-------------------\n\n**Changed**\n- Jupytext's dependency markdown-it-py is now in v1 ([#769](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/769))\n- The optional argument `fmt` in `jupytext.reads` now has the default value `None` - thanks to Yuvi Panda ([#763](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/763))\n\n**Fixed**\n- All text files are opened with an explicit `utf-8` encoding ([#770](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/770))\n- Previously `--pipe black` was not always putting two blank lines between functions. To fix that we load the internal Jupytext\n  cell metadata like `lines_to_next_cell` from the text file rather than ipynb ([#761](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/761))\n- The timestamp of the source file is not updated any more when the destination file is not in the pair ([#765](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/765), [#767](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/767))\n\n**Added**\n- A new test documents when the `ipython3` pygment lexer appears in MyST Markdown files ([#759](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/759))\n\n\n1.11.1 (2021-03-26)\n-------------------\n\n**Fixed**\n- Format options stored in the notebook itself are now taken into account (Fixes [#757](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/757))\n\n\n1.11.0 (2021-03-18)\n-------------------\n\n**Fixed**\n- The `jupytext.toml` config file can now be used together with the `jupytext` pre-commit hook ([#752](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/752))\n- The `notebook_extensions` option of the `jupytext.toml` file now works ([#746](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/746))\n\n**Changed**\n- The options in `jupytext.toml` where renamed to match the `jupytext` metadata in the text notebooks. One should now use `formats` rather than `default_jupytext_formats` and `notebook_metadata_filter` rather than `default_notebook_metadata_filter` ([#753](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/753))\n\n\n1.10.3 (2021-03-07)\n-------------------\n\n**Fixed**\n- We have updated `marked`, an indirect dependency of the `jupyterlab-jupytext` extension, to fix a moderate vulnerability ([#750](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/750)).\n- We use non-random cell ids in the tests to avoid test failures due to duplicate cell ids ([#747](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/747))\n\n\n1.10.2 (2021-02-17)\n-------------------\n\n**Fixed**\n- We have adjusted the `MANIFEST.in` file to exclude the `node_modules` but still include the JupyterLab extension that was missing in the `.tar.gz` (and conda) package in v1.10.1. Many thanks to Martin Renou for providing the fix at ([#741](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/741))\n\n\n1.10.1 (2021-02-11)\n-------------------\n\n**Added**\n- The recursive glob pattern `**/*.ipynb` is now supported by Jupytext - Thanks to Banst for this contribution ([#731](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/731))\n- Sage notebooks are supported. They can be converted to `.sage` and `.md` files and back. Thanks to Lars Franke for suggesting this! ([#727](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/727))\n- Jupytext is also accessible with `python -m jupytext`. Thanks to Matthew Brett for his PR! ([#739](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/739))\n\n**Changed**\n- We have tested Jupytext with the new cell ids introduced in `nbformat>=5.1.0`. Cell ids are preserved by the `--sync` and `--update` command. So we removed the constraint on the version of `nbformat` ([#735](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/735)).\n\n**Fixed**\n- We filtered out the `node_modules` folder from the `.tar.gz` package for Jupytext ([#730](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/730))\n\n\n1.10.0 (2021-02-04)\n-------------------\n\n**Added**\n- Jupytext has a pre-commit hook! Many thanks to John Paton and Aaron Gokaslan for making this happen ([#698](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/698))\n- Jupytext CLI will not rewrite files that don't change ([#698](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/698)).\n- If you want to see the diff for changed files, use the new `--diff` option ([#722](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/722))\n- We have added `isort` and `autoflake8` to the `pre-commit` configuration file used for developing the Jupytext project ([#709](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/709))\n- We made sure that `py:percent` scripts end with exactly one blank line ([#682](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/682))\n- We checked that Jupytext works well with symbolic links to folders (not files!) ([#696](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/696))\n\n**Changed**\n- Jupytext does not work properly with the new cell ids of the version 4.5 of `nbformat>=5.1.0` yet, so we added the requirement `nbformat<=5.0.8` ([#715](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/715))\n- Jupytext will issue an informative error or warning on notebooks in a version of nbformat that is not known to be supported ([#681](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/681), [#715](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/715))\n\n**Fixed**\n- Code cells that contain triple backticks (or more) are now encapsulated with four backticks (or more) in the Markdown and MyST Markdown formats. The version number for the Markdown format was increased to 1.3, and the version number for the MyST Markdown format was increased to 0.13 ([#712](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/712))\n- Indented magic commands are supported ([#694](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/694))\n\n\n1.9.1 (2021-01-06)\n------------------\n\n**Fixed**\n- Include the lab extension that was missing in the conda package ([#703](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/pull/703)).\n\n\n1.9.0 (2021-01-05)\n------------------\n\n**Changed**\n- The Jupytext extension for JupyterLab is compatible with Jupyter Lab 3.0, thanks to Martin Renou's awesome contribution ([#683](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/pull/683)).\n\n\n1.8.2 (2021-01-04)\n------------------\n\n**Changed**\n- Jupytext 1.8.2 depends on `python>=3.6`. The last version of Jupytext explicitly tested with Python 2.7 and 3.5 was Jupytext 1.7.1 ([#697](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/697)).\n\n\n1.8.1 (2021-01-03)\n------------------\n\n**Changed**\n- The dependency on `markdown-it-py` is conditional on `python>=3.6` ([#697](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/697))\n\n\n1.8.0 (2020-12-22)\n------------------\n\n**Changed**\n- Removed support for Python 2.7 and 3.5, a preliminary step towards a JupyterLab 3.0-compatible extension ([#683](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/683))\n- The MyST Markdown format uses `markdown-it-py~=0.6.0` ([#692](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/692))\n\n\n1.7.1 (2020-11-16)\n------------------\n\n**Fixed**\n- Text notebooks have the same format and mimetype as ipynb notebooks. This fixes the _File Load Error - content.indexOf is not a function_ error on text notebooks ([#659](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/659))\n\n\n1.7.0 (2020-11-14)\n------------------\n\n**Changed**\n- Jupytext's contents manager uses the parent CM's `get` and `save` methods to read and save text files, and explicitly calls `jupytext.reads` and `jupytext.writes` to do the conversion. We don't use `mock` nor internal parent methods any more. Thanks to Max Klein for helping making this work! ([#634](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/634), [#635](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/635))\n- Thanks to the above, Jupytext can work on top of contents manager that don't derive from `FileContentsManager`, and in particular it works with `jupyterfs` ([#618](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/618))\n- The documentation was reorganized. `README.md` was simplified and now includes many links to the documentation.\n- The documentation now uses `myst_parser` rather than `recommonmark`.

([#286](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/286))\n- Documented how to sync notebooks in a pre-commit hook ([#338](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/338))\n- Added support for Rust/Evxcr, by Jonas Bushart ([#351](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/351))\n- Added support for [Robot Framework](https://robots-from-jupyter.github.io/), by Asko Soukka ([#378](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/378))\n- Added support for PowerShell ([#349](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/349))\n\n**Changed**\n\n- Use `CHANGELOG.md` rather than `HISTORY.rst`\n\n**Fixed**\n\n- Commands like `cat = x` are not magic commands, so they are not commented any more ([#339](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/339))\n- Fixed an inconsistent round trip (code cell with `\"cat\"` being converted to a markdown cell) in the `py:light` format ([#339](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/339))\n- `jupytext --test textfile.ext` now really compares the text file to its round trip (rather than the corresponding notebook) ([#339](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/339))\n- Markdown cells that contain code are now preserved in a round trip through the Markdown and R Markdown formats ([#361](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/361))\n- Code cells with a `%%python3` cell magic are now preserved in a round trip through the Markdown format ([#365](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/365))\n- `jupytext --execute` runs the notebook in its folder ([#382](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/382))\n- Strings in the metadata of code cells are quoted in the Rmd representation. And we escape R code in chunk options with `#R_CODE#` ([#383](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/383))\n\n1.2.4 (2019-09-19)\n------------------\n\n**Added**\n\n- The documentation includes a mention on how to set metadata filters at the command line ([#330](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/330))\n- Jupytext will not catch any error when the flag `--warn-only` is not set ([#327](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/327))\n\n**Fixed**\n\n- Now the flag `--warn-only` catches every possible error ([#263](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/263))\n- `.md` and `.markdown` files are treated identically ([#325](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/325))\n- Fixed `--set-kernel` when using pipes ([#326](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/326))\n- Fixed utf-8 encoding on stdout on Python 2 ([#331](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/331))\n\n\n1.2.3 (2019-09-02)\n------------------\n\n**Fixed**\n\n- Dependency on `setuptools` in `pandoc.py` made optional to fix the build of the conda package ([#310](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/310), [#323](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/323))\n\n\n1.2.2 (2019-09-01)\n------------------\n\n**Added**\n\n- Documentation includes a section on how to use Jupytext as a Python library ([#317](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/317))\n- Mention of the server extension in the documentation ([#304](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/304))\n- Text notebooks can be tested with `jupytext --execute notebook.md` ([#303](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/303))\n- The default value of `as_version` in `jupytext.read` is `nbformat.NO_CONVERT`, as for `nbformat.read`\n- Jupytext tests are now included in sdist ([#310](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/310))\n\n**Fixed**\n\n- Fixed the usability of the `fmt` argument in `jupytext.read` ([#312](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/312))\n- Fixed the download notebook error when `c.notebook_extensions` has a custom value ([#318](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/318))\n- String delimiters in commented text are now ignored ([#307](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/307))\n\n\n1.2.1 (2019-07-20)\n------------------\n\n**Added**\n\n- Added documentation on how to use Jupytext with JupyterLab 0.35 ([#299](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/299))\n- and on using Jupytext with the pre-commit package manager ([#292](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/292))\n- The `read` and `write` functions are easier to use ([#292](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/292))\n\n**Fixed**\n\n- Jupytext now ships the `jupyterlab-jupytext` extension in version 1.0.2. The version 1.0.1 erroneously introduces a `target_formats` metadata in the jupytext section, instead of `formats`, and works only after two clicks.\n\n\n1.2.0 (2019-07-18)\n------------------\n\n**Added**\n\n- New `--execute` option in Jupytext CLI ([#231](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/231))\n- The `--set-formats` option in Jupytext CLI also triggers `--sync`, allowing shorter commands.\n- `jupytext`'s `read` and `write` functions can be used as drop-in replacements for `nbformat`'s ones ([#262](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/262)).\n- `jupytext --sync` will now skip unpaired notebooks ([#281](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/281)).\n- The JupyterLab extension was updated.

([#228](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/228))\n- Empty notebooks have no language ([#227](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/227))\n\n\n1.1.1 (2019-04-16)\n------------------\n\n**Added**\n\n- Jupytext server extension leaves the contents manager unchanged when it is already a subclass of TextFileContentsManager ([#218](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/218))\n- The base class for TextFileContentsManager defaults to FileContentsManager when LargeFileManager is not available ([#217](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/217))\n\n\n1.1.0 (2019-04-14)\n------------------\n\n**Added**\n\n- Markdown and R Markdown formats now support metadata ([#66](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/66), [#111](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/111), [#188](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/188))\n- The `light` format for Scripts

([#184](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/184))\n- Jupytext's serverextension only runs selected init steps ([#185](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/185))\n- Added an additional test for magic arguments ([#111](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/111))\n\n1.0.0 (2019-02-19)\n------------------\n\n**Added**\n\n- Jupytext now includes a Jupyter Notebook extension and a JupyterLab extension ([#86](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/86)).\n- Jupytext command line has more arguments: `--paired-paths` to list the paths for the paired representations of the notebook, and `--sync` to synchronise the content of all paired paths based on the most recent file ([#146](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/146)). In addition, the `--from` argument is optional even when the notebook is read from stdin ([#148](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/148)).\n- The pairing information, and more generally the notebook metadata can be edited with the CLL, see the `--set-formats` and the `--update-metadata` arguments ([#141](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/141)).\n- Jupytext can `--pipe` the text representation of a notebook to external programs like `black` or `flake8` ([#154](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/154), [#142](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/142))\n- The Python representation of notebooks containing PEP8 cells is now expected to be PEP8 compliant ([#154](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/154)).\n- Format specification allow prefix and suffix for path and file name ([#138](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/138), [#142](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/142)). Use `ipynb,prefix/suffix.py:percent` to pair the current notebook named `notebook.ipynb` to a script named `prefixnotebooksuffix.py`. Suffix and prefix can also be configured on the `ipynb` file, with the same syntax.\n- Introducing a new `hydrogen` format for scripts, which derives from `percent`. In that format Jupyter magic commands are not commented ([#59](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/59), [#126](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/126), [#132](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/132)).\n- Introducing a new `bare` format for scripts, which derives from `light`. That format has no cell marker. Use a notebook metadata filter `{\"jupytext\": {\"notebook_metadata_filter\":\"-all\"}}` if you want no YAML header ([#152](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/152)).\n- The default format for R script is now `light`, as for the other languages.\n- Added support for q/kdb+ notebooks ([#161](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/161)).\n- Python scripts or Markdown documents that have no Jupyter metadata receive a metadata filter that ensures that metadata is not exported back to the text representation ([#124](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/124)).\n- Metadata filters are represented as strings rather than dictionaries to make YAML headers shorter. Previous syntax from [#105](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/105) is still supported. They were also renamed to `notebook_metadata_filter` and `cell_metadata_filter`.\n- Markdown and RMarkdown formats have a new option `split_at_heading` to split Markdown cells at heading ([#130](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/130))\n\n**Fixed**\n\n- Main language of scripts is inferred from script extension. Fixes a round trip conversion issue for Python notebooks with a Javascript cell.\n- Non-Python scripts opened as notebooks in Jupyter are now correctly saved even when no matching kernel is found.\n- Jupyter magic commands like `ls` are commented in the light and R markdown format ([#149](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/149)).\n- Cell starting with `%%html`, `%%latex` are now commented out in the `light`, `percent` and `Rmd` formats ([#179](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/179)).\n\n0.8.6 (2018-11-29)\n------------------\n\n**Added**\n\n- The `language_info` section is not part of the default header any more. Language information is now taken from metadata `kernelspec.language`. ([#105](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/105)).\n- When opening a paired notebook, the active file is now the file that was originally opened ([#118](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/118)). When saving a notebook, timestamps of all the alternative representations are tested to ensure that Jupyter's autosave does not override manual modifications.\n- Jupyter magic commands are now commented per default in the `percent` format ([#126](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/126), [#132](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/132)). Version for the `percent` format increases from '1.1' to '1.2'. Set an option `comment_magics` to `false` either per notebook, or globally on Jupytext's contents manager, or on `jupytext`'s command line, if you prefer not to comment Jupyter magics.\n- Jupytext command line has a pre-commit mode ([#121](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/121)).\n\n\n0.8.5 (2018-11-13)\n------------------\n\n**Added**\n\n- `bash` scripts as notebooks ([#127](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/127))\n- R scripts with `.r` extension are supported ([#122](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/122))\n- Jupytext selects the first kernel that matches the language ([#120](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/120))\n\n0.8.4 (2018-10-29)\n------------------\n\n**Added**\n\n- Notebook metadata is filtered - only the most common metadata are stored in the text representation ([#105](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/105))\n- New config option `freeze_metadata` on the content manager and on the command line interface (defaults to `False`). Use this option to avoid creating a YAML header or cell metadata if there was none initially. ([#110](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/110))\n- Language magic arguments are preserved in R Markdown, and also supported in `light` and `percent` scripts ([#111](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/111), [#114](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/114), [#115](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/115))\n- First markdown cell exported as a docstring when using the Sphinx format ([#107](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/107))\n\n0.8.3 (2018-10-19)\n------------------\n\n**Added**\n\n- Frozen cells are supported in R Markdown, light and percent scripts ([#101](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/101))\n- Inactive cells extended to percent scripts ([#108](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/108))\n- `jupytext` gains a `--version` argument ([#103](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/103))\n- \"ExecuteTime\" cell metadata is not included in the text representation anymore ([#106](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/106))\n\n\n0.8.2 (2018-10-15)\n------------------\n\n**Added**\n\n- Round trip conversion testing with `jupytext --test` was improved ([#99](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/99))\n- Round trip conversion tested on Jake Vanderplas' Python for Data Science Handbook.\n\n**Fixed**\n\n- Nested lists and dictionaries are now supported in notebook metadata\n- Final empty code cell supported in Sphinx representation\n\n0.8.1 (2018-10-11)\n------------------\n\n**Fixed**\n\n- Sphinx format tested on `World population` notebook ([#97](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/97))\n- Mirror test made stronger on this occasion!\n- Markdown representation recognize Julia, Scheme and C++ code cells as such\n- Light representation of Scheme and C++ notebooks fixed ([#61](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/61))\n\n0.8.0 (2018-10-10)\n------------------\n\n**Added**\n\n- All `jupytext` related metadata goes to a `jupytext` section ([#91](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/91)). Please make sure your collaborators use the same version of Jupytext, as the new version can read previous metadata, but not the opposite.\n- Notebooks extensions can be prefixed with any prefix of at most three chars ([#87](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/87)).\n- Export of the same notebook to multiple formats is now supported. To export to all python formats, plus `.ipynb` and `.md`, use `\"jupytext\": {\"formats\": \"ipynb,pct.py:percent,lgt.py:light,spx.py:sphinx,md\"},`.\n- README includes a short section on how to extend `light` and `percent` formats to more languages ([#61](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/61)).\n- Jupytext's contents manager accepts the `auto` extension in `default_jupytext_formats` ([#93](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/93)).\n- All Jupyter magics are escaped in `light` scripts and R markdown documents. Escape magics in other formats with a `comment_magics` metadata (true or false), or with the contents manager `comment_magics` global flag ([#94](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/94)).\n\n**Fixed**\n\n- Trusting notebooks made functional again.\n- Command line `jupytext` returns a meaningful error when no argument is given.\n- Fixed global pairing configuration ([#95](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/95)).\n\n0.7.2 (2018-10-01)\n------------------\n\n**Added**\n\n- `light` and `percent` formats made available for scheme and cpp notebooks. Adding more formats is straightforward - just add a new entry to _SCRIPT_EXTENSIONS in languages.py, a sample notebook and a mirror test ([#61](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/61))\n- Format name is automatically appended to extension in `jupytext_formats` when notebook is loaded/saved.\n\n**Fixed**\n\n- Notebooks extensions can only be prefixed with `.nb` ([#87](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/87))\n\n\n0.7.1 (2018-09-24)\n------------------\n\n**Fixed**\n\n- Markdown cells header in sphinx gallery format may have a space between first # and following.\n\n0.7.0 (2018-09-23)\n------------------\n\n**Added**\n\n- Header for cells in `percent` format is more robust: use `[markdown]` and `[raw]` to identify cell types. Cell type comes after the cell title. ([#59](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/59))\n- Jupytext can read and write notebooks as Hydrogen/VScode/Spyder/PyCharm compatible scripts (cells starting with `# %%`) ([#59](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/59))\n- Jupytext can read and write notebooks as Sphinx-gallery compatible scripts ([#80](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/80))\n- Metadata are supported for all cell types in light python and percent formats ([#66](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/66)). Due to this, light python format version is now 1.3. Light python notebooks in versions 1.1 and 1.2 are still readable.\n- Command line `jupytext` has a `from` argument, and now accepts notebook from the standard input.\n\n**Fixed**\n\n- Fix merging of input and output notebooks ([#83](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/83))\n- Removed extra new line on stdout in command line `jupytext` ([#84](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/84))\n\n0.6.5 (2018-09-13)\n------------------\n\n**Added**\n\n- Code lines that start with a quotation mark in Jupyter are commented in the corresponding Python and Julia scripts ([#73](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/73))\n- Update pypy, add flake8 tests on Travis CI ([#74](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/74))\n\n**Fixed**\n\n- Import notebook.transutils before notebook.services.contents.filemanager ([#75](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/75))\n\n0.6.4 (2018-09-12)\n------------------\n\n**Added**\n\n- Jupytext will not load paired notebook when text representation is out of date ([#63](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/63))\n- Package tested against Python 3.7 ([#68](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/68))\n\n**Fixed**\n\n- Allow unicode characters in notebook path ([#70](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/70))\n- Read README.md as unicode in `setup.py` ([#71](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/71))\n\n0.6.3 (2018-09-07)\n------------------\n\n**Added**\n\n- Lighter cell markers for Python and Julia scripts ([#57](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/57)). Corresponding file format version at 1.2. Scripts in previous version 1.1 can still be opened.\n- New screenshots for the README.\n\n**Fixed**\n\n- Command line conversion tool `jupytext` fixed on Python 2.7 ([#46](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/46))\n\n0.6.2 (2018-09-05)\n------------------\n\n**Added**\n\n- Initial support for Jupyter notebooks as Julia scripts ([#56](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/56))\n- Command line conversion tool `jupytext` has explicit `to` and `output` options ([#46](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/46))\n- Round trip test with `jupytext --test` improved ([#54](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/54))\n- Improved README ([#51](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/51))\n\n\n**Fixed**\n\n- testfixtures now in requirements ([#55](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/55))\n- Empty code cells are now preserved ([#53](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/53))\n\n0.6.1 (2018-08-31)\n------------------\n\n**Added**\n\n- Package and conversion script renamed from `nbrmd` to `jupytext`.\n\n0.6.0 (2018-08-31)\n------------------\n\n**Added**\n\n- Cell parsing and exporting done in two specialized classes. This is way easier to read. Pylint score at 9.9 !\n- Python file format updated to 1.1: default end of cell for python scripts is one blank space. Two blank spaces are allowed as well. Now you can reformat code in Python IDE without breaking notebook cells ([#38](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/38)).\n- Added support for plain markdown files ([#40](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/40), [#44](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/44)).\n- Demonstration notebooks more user friendly ([#45](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/45)).\n- Command line tool simpler to use ([#46](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/46)).\n- Start code patterns present in Jupyter cells are escaped.\n- Default `nbrmd_format` is empty (mwouts/nbsrc/[#5](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/5)): no Jupyter notebook is created on disk when the user opens a Python or R file and saves it from Jupyter, unless the users asks for it by setting `nbrmd_format`.\n\n**Fixed**\n\n- Fixed message in the `nbsrc` script ([#43](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/43))\n- Technical metadata don't appear any more in scripts unless required ([#42](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/42))\n- Code cells that are fully commented remain code cells after round trip ([#41](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/41))\n\n0.5.4 (2018-08-24)\n------------------\n\n**Added**\n\n- R to Rmd conversion compares well to knitr::spin ([#26](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/26))\n- Increased coverage to 98%\n\n\n0.5.3 (2018-08-22)\n------------------\n\n**Fixed**\n\n- Read and write version to the same metadata ([#36](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/36))\n\n\n0.5.2 (2018-08-22)\n------------------\n\n**Added**\n\n- Classical jupyter extensions (autoreload, rmagics) are also escaped ([#35](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/35))\n- Explicit file format version, set at 1.0, to avoid overriding ipynb files by accident ([#36](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/36))\n\n\n0.5.1 (2018-08-21)\n------------------\n\n**Fixed**\n\n- Source only notebooks can be trusted.\n\n0.5.0 (2018-08-21)\n------------------\n\n**Added**\n\n- Jupyter magic commands escaped when exported ([#29](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/29))\n- 'endofcell' option for explicit (optional) end-of-cell marker ([#31](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/31))\n- 'active' cell option now supported for .py and .R export ([#30](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/30))\n- Raw cells now preserved when exported to .py or .R ([#32](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/32))\n- Extensions can be prefixed, like `.nb.py`, (mwouts/nbsrc[#5](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/5))\n- When a file with an extension not associated to 'ipynb' is opened and saved, no 'ipynb' file is created (mwouts/nbsrc[#5](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/5))\n- Extensions can now be a sequence of groups. For instance, `nbrmd_formats=\"ipynb,nb.py;script.ipynb,py\"` will create an `ipynb` file when a `nb.py` is opened (and conversely), and a `script.ipynb` file when a `py` file is opened (mwouts/nbsrc[#5](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/5))\n- `nbsrc` script was moved to the `nbrmd` package. The `nbsrc` package now only contains the documentation (mwouts/nbsrc[#3](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/3))\n\n\n0.4.6 (2018-07-26)\n------------------\n\n- Ping pypi - previous version still not available\n\n\n0.4.5 (2018-07-26)\n------------------\n\n**Fixed**\n\n- Removed dependency of `setup.py` on `yaml`\n\n0.4.4 (2018-07-26)\n-------------------\n\n**Fixed**\n\n- Package republished with `python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel` to fix missing dependencies\n\n0.4.3 (2018-07-26)\n------------------\n\n**Added**\n\n- Multiline comments now supported [#25](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/25)\n- Readme refactored, notebook demos available on binder [#23](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/23)\n\n**Fixed**\n\n- ContentsManager can be imported even if `notebook.transutils` is not available, for compatibility with older python distributions.\n- Fixed missing cell metadata [#27](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/27)\n- Documentation tells how to avoid creating `.ipynb` files [#16](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/16)\n\n0.4.2 (2018-07-23)\n------------------\n\n**Added**\n\n- Added test for R notebooks\n- Added pylint badge, imports now in correct order\n- New `active` cell metadata that allows cell activation only for desired extensions (currently available for Rmd and ipynb extensions only)\n\n0.4.1 (2018-07-20)\n------------------\n\n**Fixed**\n\n- Indented python code will not start a new cell [#20](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/20)\n- Fixed parsing of Rmd cell metadata [#21](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/21)\n\n0.4.0 (2018-07-18)\n------------------\n\n**Added**\n\n- `.py` format for notebooks is lighter and pep8 compliant\n\n**Fixed**\n\n- Default nbrmd config not added to notebooks ([#17](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/17))\n- `nbrmd_formats` becomes a configurable traits ([#16](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/issues/16))\n- Removed `nbrmd_sourceonly_format` metadata.

Wished you could edit them in your favorite IDE? And get clear and meaningful diffs when doing version control? Then, Jupytext may well be the tool you're looking for!\n\n## Text Notebooks\n\nA Python notebook encoded in the `py:percent` [format](docs/formats-scripts.md#the-percent-format) has a `.py` extension and looks like this:\n\n```\n# %% [markdown]\n# This is a markdown cell\n\n# %%\ndef f(x):\n  return 3*x+1\n```\n\nOnly the notebook inputs (and optionally, the metadata) are included. Text notebooks are well suited for version control. You can also edit or refactor them in an IDE - the `.py` notebook above is a regular Python file.\n\nWe recommend the `percent` format for notebooks that mostly contain code. The `percent` format is available for Julia, Python, R and many other [languages](docs/languages.md).\n\nIf your notebook is documentation-oriented, a [Markdown-based format](docs/formats-markdown.md) (text notebooks with a `.md` extension) might be more appropriate. Depending on what you plan to do with your notebook, you might prefer the Myst Markdown format, which interoperates very well with Jupyter Book, or Quarto Markdown, or even Pandoc Markdown.\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall Jupytext in the Python environment that you use for Jupyter. Use either\n\n    pip install jupytext\n\nor\n\n    conda install jupytext -c conda-forge\n\nThen, restart your Jupyter Lab server, and make sure Jupytext is activated in Jupyter:  `.py` and `.md` files have a Notebook icon, and you can open them as Notebooks with a right click in Jupyter Lab.\n\n![](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/blob/64b4be818508760116f91bf156342cb4cf724d93/docs/images/jupyterlab_right_click.png?raw=true)\n\n## Paired Notebooks\n\nText notebooks with a `.py` or `.md` extension are well suited for version control. They can be edited or authored conveniently in an IDE. You can open and run them as notebooks in Jupyter Lab with a right click. However, the notebook outputs are lost when the notebook is closed, as only the notebook inputs are saved in text notebooks.\n\nA convenient alternative to text notebooks are [paired notebooks](docs/paired-notebooks.md). These are a set of two files, say `.ipynb` and `.py`, that contain the same notebook, but in different formats.\n\nYou can edit the `.py` version of the paired notebook, and get the edits back in Jupyter by selecting _reload notebook from disk_. The outputs will be reloaded from the `.ipynb` file, if it exists. The `.ipynb` version will be updated or recreated the next time you save the notebook in Jupyter.\n\nTo pair a notebook in Jupyter Lab, use the command `Pair Notebook with percent Script` from the Command Palette:\n\n![](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext/blob/64b4be818508760116f91bf156342cb4cf724d93/docs/images/pair_commands.png?raw=true)\n\nTo pair all the notebooks in a certain directory, create a [configuration file](docs/config.md) with this content:\n\n```\n# jupytext.toml at the root of your notebook directory\nformats = \"ipynb,py:percent\"\n```\n\n## Command line\n\nJupytext is also available at the [command line](docs/using-cli.md). You can\n\n- pair a notebook with `jupytext --set-formats ipynb,py:percent notebook.ipynb`\n- synchronize the paired files with `jupytext --sync notebook.py` (the inputs are loaded from the most recent paired file)\n- convert a notebook in one format to another with `jupytext --to ipynb notebook.py` (use `-o` if you want a specific output file)\n- pipe a notebook to a linter with e.g. `jupytext --pipe black notebook.ipynb`\n\n## Sample use cases\n\n### Notebooks under version control\n\nThis is a quick how-to:\n- Open your `.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter and [pair](docs/paired-notebooks.md) it to a `.py` notebook, using either the _pair_ command in Jupyter Lab, or a global [configuration file](docs/config.md)\n- Save the notebook - this creates a `.py` notebook\n- Add this `.py` notebook to version control\n\nYou might exclude `.ipynb` files from version control (unless you want to see the outputs versioned!). Jupytext will recreate the `.ipynb` files locally when the users open and save the `.py` notebooks.\n\n### Collaborating on notebooks with Git\n\nCollaborating on Jupyter notebooks through Git becomes as easy as collaborating on text files.\n\nAssume that you have your `.py` notebooks under version control (see above). Then,\n- Your collaborator pulls the `.py` notebook\n- They open it _as a notebook_ in Jupyter (right-click in Jupyter Lab)\n- At that stage the notebook has no outputs. They run the notebook and save it. Outputs are regenerated, and a local `.ipynb` file is created\n- They edit the notebook, and push the updated `notebook.py` file. The diff is nothing else than a standard diff on a Python script.\n- You pull the updated `notebook.py` script, and refresh your browser. The input cells are updated based on the new content of `notebook.py`. The outputs are reloaded from your local `.ipynb` file. Finally, the kernel variables are untouched, so you have the option to run only the modified cells to get the new outputs.\n\n### Editing or refactoring a notebook in an IDE\n\nOnce your notebook is [paired](docs/paired-notebooks.md) with a `.py` file, you can easily edit or refactor the `.py` representation of the notebook in an IDE.\n\nOnce you are done editing the `.py` notebook, you will just have to _reload_ the notebook in Jupyter to get the latest edits there.\n\nNote: It is simpler to close the `.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter when you edit the paired `.py` file. There is no obligation to do so; however, if you don't, you should be prepared to read carefully the pop-up messages. If Jupyter tries to save the notebook while the paired `.py` file has also been edited on disk since the last reload, a conflict will be detected and you will be asked to decide which version of the notebook (in memory or on disk) is the appropriate one.\n\n## More resources\n\nRead more about Jupytext in the [documentation](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io).\n\nIf you're new to Jupytext, you may want to start with the [FAQ](docs/faq.md) or with the [Tutorials](docs/tutorials.md).\n\nThere is also this short introduction to Jupytext: [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/YouTube-JupyterCon%202020-red.svg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDYdeVfMh48).\n"
