Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Cursos en YouTube\n\nA media que avanzamos en el roadmap estoy creando cursos que agrupan las clases.\n\n[![Lógica 1](http://i3.ytimg.com/vi/TdITcVD64zI/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/TdITcVD64zI)\n\n[![Lógica 2](http://i3.ytimg.com/vi/b-kk1WQo-YA/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/b-kk1WQo-YA)\n\n[![Lógica 3 SOLID](http://i3.ytimg.com/vi/ASBC5drF-QU/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ASBC5drF-QU)\n\n## Instrucciones\n\n**Haz un [FORK](https://github.com/mouredev/roadmap-retos-programacion/fork) del proyecto y trabaja con Git para ir sincronizando las actualizaciones.**\n\n1. En el proyecto tienes un directorio para cada ejercicio en la carpeta [Roadmap](./Roadmap). Dentro de cada directorio encontrarás un fichero llamado **ejercicio.md** con el enunciado de cada reto.\n2. Si quieres compartir tu propia solución de un ejercicio con la comunidad, crea un fichero de código con tu nombre y extensión, y realiza una [**PULL REQUEST**](https://docs.github.com/es/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) contra el repositorio.\n3. El fichero de código debe situarse dentro del directorio del reto, en la carpeta correspondiente al lenguaje de programación utilizado (si no existe la carpeta del lenguaje, créala con todas sus letras en minúsculas). Por ejemplo, si has resuelto el reto #00 utilizando el lenguaje de programación Python y tu usuario de GitHub se llama \"mouredev\", tu corrección deberá estar en **\"Roadmap/#00/python/mouredev.py\"**. El título de la Pull Request también debe seguir este formato: **\"#[número] - [lenguaje_utilizado]\"**. En el ejemplo anterior sería **\"#00 - Python\"**. Se rechazarán las Pull Request que no sigan este formato o contengan ficheros adicionales.\n4. Cada **SEMANA** (consulta el día en el ejercicio correspondiente) realizaré una transmisión en directo desde **[Twitch](https://twitch.tv/mouredev)** corrigiendo el reto, revisando soluciones de la comunidad y publicando un nuevo ejercicio.\n5. Si necesitas ayuda o quieres comentar cualquier cosa sobre los retos semanales, tienes el canal \"reto-semanal” en nuestro servidor de **[Discord](https://discord.gg/mouredev)** (también el día y horario de corrección en la sección \"Eventos\").\n6. Puedes proponer Pull Request con propuestas o correcciones sobre ejercicios del resto de la comunidad si estos poseen errores. De esta manera colaboraremos para crear un repositorio cada vez más valioso.\n7. Si se te solicita un cambio/corrección en una Pull Request, y al cabo de 2 semanas no se muestra nueva actividad, se cerrará esa petición para mantener el repositorio limpio. Por supuesto, puedes volver a enviar la Pull Request cuando quieras.\n\n## Aclaraciones\n\nSi tienes dudas con el nombre del directorio de algún lenguaje, intenta consultar el nombre que se ha empleado en ejercicios anteriores. Algunos ejemplos que puedes llegar a dudar:\n    \n* c#, no csharp\n* c++, no cplusplus\n* go, no golang\n* javascript, no js\n\n## Guía rápida Git y GitHub\n\n1. Realiza un [FORK](https://github.com/mouredev/roadmap-retos-programacion/fork) del repositorio de retos semanales desde GitHub.\n2. CLONA ese repositorio a tu máquina local `git clone [TU-REPOSITORIO]`.\n3. (Opcional) Crea una RAMA para la solución y desplázate a ella `git checkout -b [EL-NOMBRE-DE-TU-RAMA]`.\n4. Añade el fichero de tu solución al STAGE `git add [FICHERO-DE-TU-RETO]`.\n5. Haz COMMIT con el mensaje de la solución `git commit -m \"#[NÚMERO-RETO] - [LENGUAJE-UTILIZADO]\"`.\n6. Haz PUSH `git push [EL-NOMBRE-DE-TU-RAMA]` (puede ser la \"main\" o la que creaste en el paso 3)\n7. En el repositorio principal debes ir a la rama y hacer [PULL REQUEST](https://docs.github.com/es/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).\n8. CONTRIBUTE.\n9. CREATE PULL REQUEST (cubre la plantilla que te aparecerá).\n10. Si el proceso de entrega se ha realizado de forma correcta, se añadirá tu corrección al repositorio. En caso contrario, se te notificarán los cambios a realizar o los motivos del rechazo.\n\n*He creado un curso completo gratis para aprender a trabajar con Git y GitHub desde cero.*\n\n[![Curso Git y GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/mouredev/hello-git?label=Curso%20Git%20GitHub&style=social)](https://github.com/mouredev/hello-git)\n\n## Más retos de programación\n\n**Consulta los 101 retos de programación resueltos y las 12 aplicaciones para tu portfolio que ya hemos desarrollado.**\n\n[![Retos programación 2023](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/mouredev/retos-programacion-2023?label=Retos%20Programación%202023&style=social)](https://github.com/mouredev/retos-programacion-2023)\n[![Retos programación 2022](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/mouredev/Weekly-Challenge-2022-Kotlin?label=Retos%20Semanales%202022&style=social)](https://github.com/mouredev/Weekly-Challenge-2022-Kotlin)\n[![Aplicaciones portafolio](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/mouredev/Monthly-App-Challenge-2022?label=Aplicaciones%20portafolio&style=social)](https://github.com/mouredev/Monthly-App-Challenge-2022)\n\n## Únete al campus de programación de la comunidad\n\n![https://mouredev.pro](./Images/pro.jpg)\n\n#### Te presento [mouredev pro](https://mouredev.pro), mi proyecto más importante para ayudarte a estudiar programación y desarrollo de software de manera diferente.\n\n> **¿Buscas un extra?** Aquí encontrarás mis cursos editados por lecciones individuales, para avanzar a tu ritmo y guardar el progreso.
