Manuscript](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-for-devops-manuscript).\n\n## Examples and Chapters in which they're used\n\nHere is an outline of all the examples contained in this repository, by chapter:\n\n### Chapter 1\n\n  - N/A\n\n### Chapter 2\n\n  - [`first-ansible-playbook`](first-ansible-playbook/): A very basic playbook that installs `chronyd` on CentOS and ensures it is running.\n\n### Chapter 3\n\n  - [`orchestration`](orchestration/): A simple multiple-VM Vagrant configuration and Ansible inventory to allow testing of multi-server orchestration with `ansible` ad-hoc commands.\n\n### Chapter 4\n\n  - [`drupal`](drupal/): A single-file playbook which configures the LAMP stack on a Linux host and installs Drupal.\n  - [`includes`](includes/): The same playbook as the [`drupal`](drupal/) example, but using `include`s to make the playbook more understandable.\n  - [`nodejs`](nodejs/): A single-file playbook which configures a Node.js app to run on a Linux host.\n  - [`solr`](solr/): A single-file playbook which installs Apache Solr on a Linux host.\n\n### Chapter 5\n\n  - N/A\n\n### Chapter 6\n\n  - [`nodejs-role`](nodejs-role/): The same playbook as the [`nodejs`](nodejs/) example, but using a role to break out the Node.js aspects into a separate `nodejs` role.\n  - [`galaxy-role-servers`](galaxy-role-servers/): A couple very short playbooks that demonstrate how easy it is to get new servers running leveraging the power of community Ansible Galaxy roles.\n\n### Chapter 7\n\n  - [`test-plugin`](test-plugin/): A simple test plugin that verifies a given value is representative of the color blue.\n  - [`collection`](collection/): An example local collection to demonstrate the basic structure of content collections.\n\n### Chapter 8\n\n  - [`dynamic-inventory`](dynamic-inventory/): Two example dynamic inventory scripts (one in PHP, one in Python) for use with Ansible.\n\n### Chapter 9\n\n  - [`lamp-infrastructure`](lamp-infrastructure/): A multi-server LAMP-based web application infrastructure focused on high-availability and performance for a LAMP-stack app.\n  - [`elk`](elk/): A two-server example of the Elasticsearch-Logstash-Kibana stack, which uses one server to store and visualize logs centrally, and another server to send logs via Filebeat.\n  - [`gluster`](gluster/): A two-server example of building a fast networked storage setup using Gluster.\n\n### Chapter 10\n\n  - [`deployments`](deployments/): A playbook that deploys a Ruby on Rails application into an environment that runs Passenger and Nginx to handle web requests.\n  - [`deployments-balancer`](deployments-balancer/): A playbook that handles zero-downtime deployments to webservers running behind an HAProxy load balancer.\n  - [`deployments-rolling`](deployments-rolling/): A playbook that demonstrates rolling deployments to multiple servers for a Node.js app.\n\n### Chapter 11\n\n  - [`security`](security/): A playbook containing many security automation tasks to demonstrate how Ansible helps automate security hardening.\n\n### Chapter 12\n\n  - [`jenkins`](jenkins/): A playbook that installs and configures Jenkins for CI/CD.\n\n### Chapter 13\n\n  - [`molecule`](molecule/): A Molecule example used for testing and developing an Ansible playbook, or for testing in a Continuous Integration (CI) environment.\n  - [`molecule-ci.yml` GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/molecule-ci.yml): A GitHub Actions workflow which runs the `molecule` example in a CI environment.\n\n### Chapter 14\n\n  - [`https-self-signed`](https-self-signed/): A playbook that generates self-signed certificates.\n  - [`https-letsencrypt`](https-letsencrypt/): A playbook that demonstrates automated certificate management with Let's Encrypt and Ansible.\n  - [`https-nginx-proxy`](https-nginx-proxy/): A playbook that demonstrates proxying HTTPS traffic through Nginx to HTTP backends.\n\n### Chapter 15\n\n  - [`docker`](docker/): Very simple playbook demonstrating Ansible's ability to manage Docker container images.\n  - [`docker-hubot`](docker-hubot/): Slightly more involved example of Ansible's ability to manage and run Docker container images.\n  - [`docker-flask`](docker-flask/): A sample Flask app built with Ansible playbooks running inside the container.\n\n### Chapter 16\n\n  - [`kubernetes`](kubernetes/): A playbook that builds a three-node Kubernetes cluster.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n## Sponsors\n\n* [TinyPilot](https://tinypilotkvm.com): An open-source, low-cost KVM over IP for managing your servers.\n\nThe above sponsor(s) are supporting Jeff Geerling on [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/geerlingguy).
