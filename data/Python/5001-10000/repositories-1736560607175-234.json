Note related issues and tag relevant maintainers.\n- Ensure your PR passes formatting, linting, and testing checks before requesting a review.\n  - If you would like comments or feedback, please open an issue or discussion and tag a maintainer.\n- Backwards compatibility is key. Your changes must not be breaking, except in case of critical bug and security fixes.\n- Look for duplicate PRs or issues that have already been opened before opening a new one.\n- Keep scope as isolated as possible. As a general rule, your changes should not affect more than one package at a time.\n\n### Bugfixes\n\nFor bug fixes, please open up an issue before proposing a fix to ensure the proposal properly addresses the underlying problem. In general, bug fixes should all have an accompanying unit test that fails before the fix.\n\n### New features\n\nFor new features, please start a new [discussion](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph/discussions), where the maintainers will help with scoping out the necessary changes.\n\n## Contribute Documentation\n\nDocumentation is a vital part of LangGraph. We welcome both new documentation for new features and\ncommunity improvements to our current documentation. Please read the resources below before getting started:\n\n- [Documentation style guide](#documentation-style-guide)\n- [Documentation setup](#setup)\n\n## Documentation Style Guide\n\nAs LangGraph continues to grow, the surface area of documentation required to cover it continues to grow too.\nThis page provides guidelines for anyone writing documentation for LangGraph, as well as some of our philosophies around organization and structure.\n\n## Philosophy\n\nLangGraph's documentation follows the [Diataxis framework](https://diataxis.fr).\nUnder this framework, all documentation falls under one of four categories: [Tutorials](#tutorials),\n[How-to guides](#how-to-guides),\n[References](#references), and [Explanations (aka conceptual guides)](#conceptual-guide).\n\n### Tutorials\n\nTutorials are lessons that take the reader through a practical activity. Their purpose is to help the user\ngain understanding of concepts and how they interact by showing one way to achieve some goal in a hands-on way.\n\nThey should **avoid** giving\nmultiple permutations of ways to achieve that goal in-depth. Choice is burdensome. Instead, they should guide a new user through a recommended path to accomplishing a concrete goal. While the end result of a tutorial does not necessarily need to\nbe completely production-ready, it should be useful and practically satisfy the goal that you clearly stated in the tutorial's introduction.\n\nTo quote the Diataxis website:\n\n> A tutorial serves the user’s *acquisition* of skills and knowledge - their study. Its purpose is not to help the user get something done, but to help them learn.\n\nIn LangGraph, these are often higher level guides that show off end-to-end use cases.\n\nSome examples include:\n\n- [Build a Customer Support Bot](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/customer-support/customer-support/)\n- [Build a SQL Agent](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/sql-agent/)\n\nHere are some high-level tips on writing a good tutorial:\n\n- Focus on guiding the user to get something done, but keep in mind the end-goal is more to impart principles than to create a perfect production system.\n- Be specific, not abstract and follow one path.\n  - No need to go deeply into alternative approaches, but it’s ok to reference them, ideally with a link to an appropriate how-to guide.\n- Get \"a point on the board\" as soon as possible - something the user can run that outputs something.\n  - You can iterate and expand afterwards.\n  - Try to frequently checkpoint at given steps where the user can run code and see progress.\n- Focus on results, not technical explanation.\n  - Crosslink heavily to appropriate conceptual/reference pages\n- The first time you mention a LangGraph concept, use its full name (e.g. \"human-in-the-loop\"), and link to its conceptual/other documentation page.\n  - It's also helpful to add a prerequisite callout that links to any pages with necessary background information.\n- End with a recap/next steps section summarizing what the tutorial covered and future reading, such as related how-to guides.\n- Use phrases like \"Next we can run X & Y. We will expect Z.\". Then afterwards, use language like \"Notice Z\" that recalls our expectations and directs the reader's attention to the topic we are trying to teach.\n- Do not shy away from repetition.\n\n### How-to guides\n\nA how-to guide, as the name implies, demonstrates how to do something discrete and specific.\nIt should assume that the user is already familiar with underlying concepts, and is trying to solve an immediate problem, but\nshould still give some background or list the scenarios where the information contained within can be relevant.\nThey can and should discuss alternatives if one approach may be better than another in certain cases.\n\nTo quote the Diataxis website:\n\n> A how-to guide serves the work of the already-competent user, whom you can assume to know what they want to do, and to be able to follow your instructions correctly.\n\nSome examples include:\n\n- [How to add persistence to your graph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/persistence/)\n- [How to view and update past graph state](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/human_in_the_loop/time-travel/)\n\nHere are some high-level tips on writing a good how-to guide:\n\n- Clearly explain what you are guiding the user through at the start\n- Assume higher intent than a tutorial and show what the user needs to do to get that task done\n- Assume familiarity of concepts, but explain why suggested actions are helpful\n  - Crosslink heavily to conceptual/reference pages\n- Discuss alternatives and responses to real-world tradeoffs that may arise when solving a problem\n- Use lots of example code, ideally within complete code blocks that the reader can copy and run.\n- End with a recap/next steps section summarizing what the tutorial covered and future reading, such as other related how-to guides\n\n### Conceptual guides\n\nLangGraph's conceptual guides fall under the **Explanation** quadrant of Diataxis. They should cover LangChain terms and concepts\nin a more abstract way than how-to guides or tutorials, and should be geared towards curious users interested in\ngaining a deeper understanding of the framework. Try to avoid excessively large code examples. The goal here is to\nimpart perspective to the user rather than to finish a practical project. These guides should cover **why** things work they way they do.\n\n\nTo quote the Diataxis website:\n\n> The perspective of explanation is higher and wider than that of the other types. It does not take the user’s eye-level view, as in a how-to guide, or a close-up view of the machinery, like reference material. Its scope in each case is a topic - “an area of knowledge”, that somehow has to be bounded in a reasonable, meaningful way.\n\nSome examples include:\n\n- [What does it mean to be agentic?](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/high_level/)\n- [Tool calling](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/agentic_concepts/#tool-calling)\n\nHere are some high-level tips on writing a good conceptual guide:\n\n- Explain design decisions. Why does concept X exist and why was it designed this way?\n- Use analogies and reference other concepts and alternatives\n- Avoid blending in too much reference content\n- You can and should reference content covered in other guides, but make sure to link to them\n\n### References\n\nReferences contain detailed, low-level information that describes exactly what functionality exists and how to use it.\nIn LangGraph, this is mainly our API reference pages, which are populated from docstrings within code.\nReferences pages are generally not read end-to-end, but are consulted as necessary when a user needs to know\nhow to use something specific.\n\nTo quote the Diataxis website:\n\n> The only purpose of a reference guide is to describe, as succinctly as possible, and in an orderly way. Whereas the content of tutorials and how-to guides are led by needs of the user, reference material is led by the product it describes.\n\nMany of the reference pages in LangChain are automatically generated from code,\nbut here are some high-level tips on writing a good docstring:\n\n- Be concise\n- Discuss special cases and deviations from a user's expectations\n- Go into detail on required inputs and outputs\n- Light details on when one might use the feature are fine, but in-depth details belong in other sections.\n\nEach category serves a distinct purpose and requires a specific approach to writing and structuring the content.\n\n## General guidelines\n\nHere are some other guidelines you should think about when writing and organizing documentation.\n\nWe generally do not merge new tutorials from outside contributors without an actue need.\nWe welcome updates as well as new integration docs, how-tos, and references.\n\n### Avoid duplication\n\nMultiple pages that cover the same material in depth are difficult to maintain and cause confusion. There should\nbe only one (very rarely two), canonical pages for a given concept or feature. Instead, you should link to other guides.\n\n### Link to other sections\n\nBecause sections of the docs do not exist in a vacuum, it is important to link to other sections as often as possible\nto allow a developer to learn more about an unfamiliar topic inline.\n\nThis includes linking to the API references as well as conceptual sections!\n\n### Be concise\n\nIn general, take a less-is-more approach. If a section with a good explanation of a concept already exists, you should link to it rather than\nre-explain it, unless the concept you are documenting presents some new wrinkle.\n\nBe concise, including in code samples.\n\n### General style\n\n- Use active voice and present tense whenever possible\n- Use examples and code snippets to illustrate concepts and usage\n- Use appropriate header levels (`#`, `##`, `###`, etc.) to organize the content hierarchically\n- Use fewer cells with more code to make copy/paste easier\n- Use bullet points and numbered lists to break down information into easily digestible chunks\n- Use tables (especially for **Reference** sections) and diagrams often to present information visually\n- Include the table of contents for longer documentation pages to help readers navigate the content, but hide it for shorter pages\n\n## Setup\n\nLangChain documentation consists of two components:\n\n1. Main Documentation: Hosted at [https://langchain-ai.github.io](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/),\nthis comprehensive resource serves as the primary user-facing documentation.\nIt covers a wide array of topics, including tutorials, use cases, integrations,\nand more, offering extensive guidance on building with LangGraph.\nThe content for this documentation lives in the `/docs` directory of the monorepo.\n2. In-code Documentation: This is documentation of the codebase itself, which is also\nused to generate the externally facing [API Reference](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/graphs/).\nThe content for the API reference is autogenerated by scanning the docstrings in the codebase. For this reason we ask that developers document their code well.\n\nWe appreciate all contributions to the documentation, whether it be fixing a typo,\nadding a new tutorial or example and whether it be in the main documentation or the API Reference.\n\n### 📜 Main Documentation\n\nThe content for the main documentation is located in the `/docs` directory of the monorepo.\n\nThe documentation is written using a combination of ipython notebooks (`.ipynb` files)\nand markdown (`.md` files). The notebooks are converted to markdown\nand then built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).\n\nFeel free to make contributions to the main documentation! 🥰\n\nAfter modifying the documentation:\n\n1. Run the linting and formatting commands (see below) to ensure that the documentation is well-formatted and free of errors.\n2. Optionally build the documentation locally to verify that the changes look good.\n3. Make a pull request with the changes.\n\n### ⚒️ Linting and Building Documentation Locally\n\nAfter writing up the documentation, you may want to lint and build the documentation\nlocally to ensure that it looks good and is free of errors.\n\nIf you're unable to build it locally that's okay as well, as you will be able to\nsee a preview of the documentation on the pull request page.\n\nFrom the **monorepo root**, run the following command to install the dependencies:\n\n```bash\npoetry install --with docs --no-root\n```\n\n#### Building\n\nThe code that builds the documentation is located in the `/docs` directory of the monorepo.\n\nBefore building the documentation, it is always a good idea to clean the build directory:\n\n```bash\nmake clean-docs\n```\n\nYou can build and preview the documentation as outlined below:\n\n```bash\nmake serve-docs\n```\n\n#### Linting\n\nThe documentation is linted from the **monorepo root**. To lint it, run the following from there:\n\n```bash\nmake spellcheck\n```\n\n### ️In-code Documentation\n\nThe in-code documentation is autogenerated from docstrings.\n\nFor the API reference to be useful, the codebase must be well-documented. This means that all functions, classes, and methods should have a docstring that explains what they do, what the arguments are, and what the return value is. This is a good practice in general, but it is especially important for LangChain because the API reference is the primary resource for developers to understand how to use the codebase.\n\nWe generally follow the [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings) for docstrings.\n\nHere is an example of a well-documented function:\n\n```python\n\ndef my_function(arg1: int, arg2: str) -> float:\n    \"\"\"This is a short description of the function. (It should be a single sentence.)\n\n    This is a longer description of the function. It should explain what\n    the function does, what the arguments are, and what the return value is.\n    It should wrap at 88 characters.\n\n    Examples:\n        This is a section for examples of how to use the function.\n\n        .. code-block:: python\n\n            my_function(1, \"hello\")\n\n    Args:\n        arg1: This is a description of arg1. We do not need to specify the type since\n            it is already specified in the function signature.\n        arg2: This is a description of arg2.\n\n    Returns:\n        This is a description of the return value.\n    \"\"\"\n    return 3.14\n```"

See the [JS repo](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraphjs) and the [JS docs](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/).\n\n## Overview\n\n[LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs, used to create agent and multi-agent workflows. Compared to other LLM frameworks, it offers these core benefits: cycles, controllability, and persistence. LangGraph allows you to define flows that involve cycles, essential for most agentic architectures, differentiating it from DAG-based solutions. As a very low-level framework, it provides fine-grained control over both the flow and state of your application, crucial for creating reliable agents. Additionally, LangGraph includes built-in persistence, enabling advanced human-in-the-loop and memory features.\n\nLangGraph is inspired by [Pregel](https://research.google/pubs/pub37252/) and [Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org/). The public interface draws inspiration from [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/). LangGraph is built by LangChain Inc, the creators of LangChain, but can be used without LangChain.\n\n[LangGraph Platform](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/langgraph_platform) is infrastructure for deploying LangGraph agents. It is a commercial solution for deploying agentic applications to production, built on the open-source LangGraph framework. The LangGraph Platform consists of several components that work together to support the development, deployment, debugging, and monitoring of LangGraph applications: [LangGraph Server](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/langgraph_server) (APIs), [LangGraph SDKs](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/sdk) (clients for the APIs), [LangGraph CLI](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/langgraph_cli) (command line tool for building the server), [LangGraph Studio](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/langgraph_studio) (UI/debugger),\n\nTo learn more about LangGraph, check out our first LangChain Academy course, *Introduction to LangGraph*, available for free [here](https://academy.langchain.com/courses/intro-to-langgraph).\n\n### Key Features\n\n- **Cycles and Branching**: Implement loops and conditionals in your apps.\n- **Persistence**: Automatically save state after each step in the graph. Pause and resume the graph execution at any point to support error recovery, human-in-the-loop workflows, time travel and more.\n- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Interrupt graph execution to approve or edit next action planned by the agent.\n- **Streaming Support**: Stream outputs as they are produced by each node (including token streaming).\n- **Integration with LangChain**: LangGraph integrates seamlessly with [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/) and [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) (but does not require them).\n\n### LangGraph Platform\n\nLangGraph Platform is a commercial solution for deploying agentic applications to production, built on the open-source LangGraph framework.\nHere are some common issues that arise in complex deployments, which LangGraph Platform addresses:\n\n- **Streaming support**: LangGraph Server provides [multiple streaming modes](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/streaming) optimized for various application needs\n- **Background runs**: Runs agents asynchronously in the background\n- **Support for long running agents**: Infrastructure that can handle long running processes\n- **[Double texting](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/double_texting)**: Handle the case where you get two messages from the user before the agent can respond\n- **Handle burstiness**: Task queue for ensuring requests are handled consistently without loss, even under heavy loads\n\n## Installation\n\n```shell\npip install -U langgraph\n```\n\n## Example\n\nOne of the central concepts of LangGraph is state. Each graph execution creates a state that is passed between nodes in the graph as they execute, and each node updates this internal state with its return value after it executes. The way that the graph updates its internal state is defined by either the type of graph chosen or a custom function.\n\nLet's take a look at a simple example of an agent that can use a search tool.\n\n```shell\npip install langchain-anthropic\n```\n\n```shell\nexport ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-...\n```\n\nOptionally, we can set up [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) for best-in-class observability.\n\n```shell\nexport LANGSMITH_TRACING=true\nexport LANGSMITH_API_KEY=lsv2_sk_...\n```\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Annotated, Literal, TypedDict\n\nfrom langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage\nfrom langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic\nfrom langchain_core.tools import tool\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver\nfrom langgraph.graph import END, START, StateGraph, MessagesState\nfrom langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode\n\n\n# Define the tools for the agent to use\n@tool\ndef search(query: str):\n    \"\"\"Call to surf the web.\"\"\"\n    # This is a placeholder, but don't tell the LLM that...\n    if \"sf\" in query.lower() or \"san francisco\" in query.lower():\n        return \"It's 60 degrees and foggy.\"\n    return \"It's 90 degrees and sunny.\"\n\n\ntools = [search]\n\ntool_node = ToolNode(tools)\n\nmodel = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\", temperature=0).bind_tools(tools)\n\n# Define the function that determines whether to continue or not\ndef should_continue(state: MessagesState) -> Literal[\"tools\", END]:\n    messages = state['messages']\n    last_message = messages[-1]\n    # If the LLM makes a tool call, then we route to the \"tools\" node\n    if last_message.tool_calls:\n        return \"tools\"\n    # Otherwise, we stop (reply to the user)\n    return END\n\n\n# Define the function that calls the model\ndef call_model(state: MessagesState):\n    messages = state['messages']\n    response = model.invoke(messages)\n    # We return a list, because this will get added to the existing list\n    return {\"messages\": [response]}\n\n\n# Define a new graph\nworkflow = StateGraph(MessagesState)\n\n# Define the two nodes we will cycle between\nworkflow.add_node(\"agent\", call_model)\nworkflow.add_node(\"tools\", tool_node)\n\n# Set the entrypoint as `agent`\n# This means that this node is the first one called\nworkflow.add_edge(START, \"agent\")\n\n# We now add a conditional edge\nworkflow.add_conditional_edges(\n    # First, we define the start node.

New York is experiencing much warmer temperatures right now. Here are a few points to note:\\n\\n1. The temperature of 90°F is quite hot, typical of summer weather in New York City.\\n2. The sunny conditions suggest clear skies, which is great for outdoor activities but also means it might feel even hotter due to direct sunlight.\\n3. This kind of weather in New York often comes with high humidity, which can make it feel even warmer than the actual temperature suggests.\\n\\nIt's interesting to see the stark contrast between San Francisco's mild, foggy weather and New York's hot, sunny conditions. This difference illustrates how varied weather can be across different parts of the United States, even on the same day.\\n\\nIs there anything else you'd like to know about the weather in New York or any other location?\"\n```\n\n### Step-by-step Breakdown\n\n1. <details>\n    <summary>Initialize the model and tools.</summary>\n\n    - we use `ChatAnthropic` as our LLM. **NOTE:** we need make sure the model knows that it has these tools available to call. We can do this by converting the LangChain tools into the format for OpenAI tool calling using the `.bind_tools()` method.\n    - we define the tools we want to use - a search tool in our case. It is really easy to create your own tools - see documentation here on how to do that [here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/tools/custom_tools).\n   </details>\n\n2. <details>\n    <summary>Initialize graph with state.</summary>\n\n    - we initialize graph (`StateGraph`) by passing state schema (in our case `MessagesState`)\n    - `MessagesState` is a prebuilt state schema that has one attribute -- a list of LangChain `Message` objects, as well as logic for merging the updates from each node into the state\n   </details>\n\n3. <details>\n    <summary>Define graph nodes.</summary>\n\n    There are two main nodes we need:\n\n      - The `agent` node: responsible for deciding what (if any) actions to take.\n      - The `tools` node that invokes tools: if the agent decides to take an action, this node will then execute that action.\n   </details>\n\n4. <details>\n    <summary>Define entry point and graph edges.</summary>\n\n      First, we need to set the entry point for graph execution - `agent` node.\n\n      Then we define one normal and one conditional edge. Conditional edge means that the destination depends on the contents of the graph's state (`MessageState`). In our case, the destination is not known until the agent (LLM) decides.\n\n      - Conditional edge: after the agent is called, we should either:\n        - a. Run tools if the agent said to take an action, OR\n        - b. Finish (respond to the user) if the agent did not ask to run tools\n      - Normal edge: after the tools are invoked, the graph should always return to the agent to decide what to do next\n   </details>\n\n5. <details>\n    <summary>Compile the graph.</summary>\n\n    - When we compile the graph, we turn it into a LangChain [Runnable](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/concepts/#runnable-interface), which automatically enables calling `.invoke()`, `.stream()` and `.batch()` with your inputs\n    - We can also optionally pass checkpointer object for persisting state between graph runs, and enabling memory, human-in-the-loop workflows, time travel and more. In our case we use `MemorySaver` - a simple in-memory checkpointer\n    </details>\n\n6. <details>\n   <summary>Execute the graph.</summary>\n\n    1. LangGraph adds the input message to the internal state, then passes the state to the entrypoint node, `\"agent\"`.\n    2. The `\"agent\"` node executes, invoking the chat model.\n    3. The chat model returns an `AIMessage`. LangGraph adds this to the state.\n    4. Graph cycles the following steps until there are no more `tool_calls` on `AIMessage`:\n\n        - If `AIMessage` has `tool_calls`, `\"tools\"` node executes\n        - The `\"agent\"` node executes again and returns `AIMessage`\n\n    5. Execution progresses to the special `END` value and outputs the final state.\n    And as a result, we get a list of all our chat messages as output.\n   </details>\n\n\n## Documentation\n\n* [Tutorials](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/): Learn to build with LangGraph through guided examples.\n* [How-to Guides](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/): Accomplish specific things within LangGraph, from streaming, to adding memory & persistence, to common design patterns (branching, subgraphs, etc.), these are the place to go if you want to copy and run a specific code snippet.\n* [Conceptual Guides](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/high_level/): In-depth explanations of the key concepts and principles behind LangGraph, such as nodes, edges, state and more.\n* [API Reference](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/graphs/): Review important classes and methods, simple examples of how to use the graph and checkpointing APIs, higher-level prebuilt components and more.\n* [LangGraph Platform](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/#langgraph-platform): LangGraph Platform is a commercial solution for deploying agentic applications in production, built on the open-source LangGraph framework.\n\n## Contributing\n\nFor more information on how to contribute, see [here](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n"
