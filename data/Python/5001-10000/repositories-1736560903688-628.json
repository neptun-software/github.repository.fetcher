The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

**Python 3.9** or higher.\n\n***Note: This project is currently in active development, it's recommended to\ninstall AgentScope from source.***\n\n### From source\n\n- Install AgentScope in editable mode:\n\n```bash\n# Pull the source code from GitHub\ngit clone https://github.com/modelscope/agentscope.git\n\n# Install the package in editable mode\ncd agentscope\npip install -e .\n```\n\n### Using pip\n\n- Install AgentScope from pip:\n\n```bash\npip install agentscope\n```\n\n### Extra Dependencies\n\nTo support different deployment scenarios, AgentScope provides several\noptional dependencies. Full list of optional dependencies refers to\n[tutorial](https://doc.agentscope.io/en/tutorial/102-installation.html)\nTaking distribution mode as an example, you can install its dependencies\nas follows:\n\n#### On Windows\n\n```bash\n# From source\npip install -e .[distribute]\n# From pypi\npip install agentscope[distribute]\n```\n\n#### On Mac & Linux\n\n```bash\n# From source\npip install -e .\\[distribute\\]\n# From pypi\npip install agentscope\\[distribute\\]\n```\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### Configuration\n\nIn AgentScope, the model deployment and invocation are decoupled by\n`ModelWrapper`.\n\nTo use these model wrappers, you need to prepare a model config file as\nfollows.\n\n```python\nmodel_config = {\n    # The identifies of your config and used model wrapper\n    \"config_name\": \"{your_config_name}\",          # The name to identify the config\n    \"model_type\": \"{model_type}\",                 # The type to identify the model wrapper\n\n    # Detailed parameters into initialize the model wrapper\n    # ...\n}\n```\n\nTaking OpenAI Chat API as an example, the model configuration is as follows:\n\n```python\nopenai_model_config = {\n    \"config_name\": \"my_openai_config\",             # The name to identify the config\n    \"model_type\": \"openai_chat\",                   # The type to identify the model wrapper\n\n    # Detailed parameters into initialize the model wrapper\n    \"model_name\": \"gpt-4\",                         # The used model in openai API, e.g. gpt-4, gpt-3.5-turbo, etc.\n    \"api_key\": \"xxx\",                              # The API key for OpenAI API. If not set, env\n                                                   # variable OPENAI_API_KEY will be used.\n    \"organization\": \"xxx\",                         # The organization for OpenAI API. If not set, env\n                                                   # variable OPENAI_ORGANIZATION will be used.\n}\n```\n\nMore details about how to set up local model services and prepare model\nconfigurations is in our\n[tutorial](https://modelscope.github.io/agentscope/index.html#welcome-to-agentscope-tutorial-hub).\n\n### Create Agents\n\nCreate built-in user and assistant agents as follows.\n\n```python\nfrom agentscope.agents import DialogAgent, UserAgent\nimport agentscope\n\n# Load model configs\nagentscope.init(model_configs=\"./model_configs.json\")\n\n# Create a dialog agent and a user agent\ndialog_agent = DialogAgent(name=\"assistant\",\n                           model_config_name=\"my_openai_config\")\nuser_agent = UserAgent()\n```\n\n### Construct Conversation\n\nIn AgentScope, **message** is the bridge among agents, which is a\n**dict** that contains two necessary fields `name` and `content` and an\noptional field `url` to local files (image, video or audio) or website.\n\n```python\nfrom agentscope.message import Msg\n\nx = Msg(name=\"Alice\", content=\"Hi!\")\nx = Msg(\"Bob\", \"What about this picture I took?\", url=\"/path/to/picture.jpg\")\n```\n\nStart a conversation between two agents (e.g. dialog_agent and user_agent)\nwith the following code:\n\n```python\nx = None\nwhile True:\n    x = dialog_agent(x)\n    x = user_agent(x)\n    if x.content == \"exit\":  # user input \"exit\" to exit the conversation_basic\n        break\n```\n\n### AgentScope Studio\n\nAgentScope provides an easy-to-use runtime user interface capable of\ndisplaying multimodal output on the front end, including text, images,\naudio and video.\n\nRefer to our [tutorial](https://modelscope.github.io/agentscope/en/tutorial/209-gui.html) for more details.\n\n<h5 align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i4/O1CN015kjnkd1xdwJoNxqLZ_!!6000000006467-0-tps-3452-1984.jpg\" width=\"600\" alt=\"agentscope-logo\">\n</h5>\n\n## Tutorial\n\n- [About AgentScope](https://modelscope.github.io/agentscope/zh_CN/tutorial/101-agentscope.html)\n- [Installation](https://modelscope.github.io/agentscope/zh_CN/tutorial/102-installation.html)\n- [Quick Start](https://modelscope.github.io/agentscope/zh_CN/tutorial/103-example.html)\n- [Model](https://modelscope.github.io/agentscope/zh_CN/tutorial/203-model.html)\n- [Prompt Engineering](https://modelscope.github.io/agentscope/zh_CN/tutorial/206-prompt.html)\n- [Agent](https://modelscope.github.io/agentscope/zh_CN/tutorial/201-agent.html)\n- [Memory](https://modelscope.github.io/agentscope/zh_CN/tutorial/205-memory.html)\n- [Response Parser](https://modelscope.github.io/agentscope/zh_CN/tutorial/203-parser.html)\n- [Tool](https://modelscope.github.io/agentscope/zh_CN/tutorial/204-service.html)\n- [Pipeline and MsgHub](https://modelscope.github.io/agentscope/zh_CN/tutorial/202-pipeline.html)\n- [Distribution](https://modelscope.github.io/agentscope/zh_CN/tutorial/208-distribute.html)\n- [AgentScope Studio](https://modelscope.github.io/agentscope/zh_CN/tutorial/209-gui.html)\n- [Logging](https://modelscope.github.io/agentscope/zh_CN/tutorial/105-logging.html)\n- [Monitor](https://modelscope.github.io/agentscope/zh_CN/tutorial/207-monitor.html)\n- [Example: Werewolf Game](https://modelscope.github.io/agentscope/zh_CN/tutorial/104-usecase.html)\n\n## License\n\nAgentScope is released under Apache License 2.0.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are always welcomed!\n\nWe provide a developer version with additional pre-commit hooks to perform\nchecks compared to the official version:\n\n```bash\n# For windows\npip install -e .[dev]\n# For mac\npip install -e .\\[dev\\]\n\n# Install pre-commit hooks\npre-commit install\n```\n\nPlease refer to our [Contribution Guide](https://modelscope.github.io/agentscope/en/tutorial/302-contribute.html) for more details.\n\n## Publications\n\nIf you find our work helpful for your research or application, please cite our papers.\n\n1.

3.9**以上が必要です。\n\n***注：このプロジェクトは現在アクティブに開発中であり、AgentScopeをソースからインストールすることをお勧めします。***\n\n### ソースから\n\n- AgentScopeを編集モードでインストールします：\n\n```bash\n# GitHubからソースコードを取得\ngit clone https://github.com/modelscope/agentscope.git\n\n# パッケージを編集モードでインストール\ncd agentscope\npip install -e .\n```\n\n### pipを使用\n\n- pipからAgentScopeをインストールします：\n\n```bash\npip install agentscope\n```\n\n### 追加の依存関係\n\nさまざまなデプロイメントシナリオをサポートするために、AgentScopeはいくつかのオプションの依存関係を提供します。オプションの依存関係の完全なリストは、[チュートリアル](https://doc.agentscope.io/en/tutorial/102-installation.html)を参照してください。分散モードを例にとると、次のように依存関係をインストールできます：\n\n#### Windowsの場合\n\n```bash\n# ソースから\npip install -e .[distribute]\n# pypiから\npip install agentscope[distribute]\n```\n\n#### Mac & Linuxの場合\n\n```bash\n# ソースから\npip install -e .\\[distribute\\]\n# pypiから\npip install agentscope\\[distribute\\]\n```\n\n## クイックスタート\n\n### 構成\n\nAgentScopeでは、モデルのデプロイメントと呼び出しは`ModelWrapper`によってデカップリングされています。\n\nこれらのモデルラッパーを使用するには、次のようなモデル構成ファイルを準備する必要があります。\n\n```python\nmodel_config = {\n    # 構成の識別子と使用されるモデルラッパー\n    \"config_name\": \"{your_config_name}\",          # 構成を識別する名前\n    \"model_type\": \"{model_type}\",                 # モデルラッパーを識別するタイプ\n\n    # モデルラッパーを初期化するための詳細なパラメータ\n    # ...\n}\n```\n\nOpenAI Chat APIを例にとると、モデル構成は次のようになります：\n\n```python\nopenai_model_config = {\n    \"config_name\": \"my_openai_config\",             # 構成を識別する名前\n    \"model_type\": \"openai_chat\",                   # モデルラッパーを識別するタイプ\n\n    # モデルラッパーを初期化するための詳細なパラメータ\n    \"model_name\": \"gpt-4\",                         # OpenAI APIで使用されるモデル名（例：gpt-4、gpt-3.5-turboなど）\n    \"api_key\": \"xxx\",                              # OpenAI APIのAPIキー。設定されていない場合、環境変数OPENAI_API_KEYが使用されます。\n    \"organization\": \"xxx\",                         # OpenAI APIの組織。設定されていない場合、環境変数OPENAI_ORGANIZATIONが使用されます。\n}\n```\n\nローカルモデルサービスのセットアップ方法やモデル構成の準備方法の詳細については、[チュートリアル](https://modelscope.github.io/agentscope/index.html#welcome-to-agentscope-tutorial-hub)を参照してください。\n\n### エージェントの作成\n\n次のように組み込みのユーザーエージェントとアシスタントエージェントを作成します。\n\n```python\nfrom agentscope.agents import DialogAgent, UserAgent\nimport agentscope\n\n# モデル構成を読み込む\nagentscope.init(model_configs=\"./model_configs.json\")\n\n# ダイアログエージェントとユーザーエージェントを作成する\ndialog_agent = DialogAgent(name=\"assistant\",\n                           model_config_name=\"my_openai_config\")\nuser_agent = UserAgent()\n```\n\n### 会話の構築\n\nAgentScopeでは、**メッセージ**はエージェント間の橋渡しであり、**dict**であり、2つの必要なフィールド`name`と`content`、およびローカルファイル（画像、ビデオ、またはオーディオ）またはウェブサイトへのオプションのフィールド`url`を含みます。\n\n```python\nfrom agentscope.message import Msg\n\nx = Msg(name=\"Alice\", content=\"Hi!\")\nx = Msg(\"Bob\", \"What about this picture I took?\", url=\"/path/to/picture.jpg\")\n```\n\n次のコードを使用して、2つのエージェント（例：dialog_agentとuser_agent）間の会話を開始します：\n\n```python\nx = None\nwhile True:\n    x = dialog_agent(x)\n    x = user_agent(x)\n    if x.content == \"exit\":  # ユーザーが\"exit\"と入力して会話を終了する\n        break\n```\n\n### AgentScope Studio\n\nAgentScopeは、テキスト、画像、オーディオ、ビデオなどのマルチモーダル出力をフロントエンドで表示できる使いやすいランタイムユーザーインターフェースを提供します。\n\n詳細については、[チュートリアル](https://modelscope.github.io/agentscope/en/tutorial/209-gui.html)を参照してください。\n\n<h5

以编辑模式安装AgentScope：\n\n```bash\n# 从github拉取源代码\ngit clone https://github.com/modelscope/agentscope.git\n# 以编辑模式安装包\ncd agentscope\npip install -e .\n```\n\n### 使用pip\n\n- 从pip安装的AgentScope\n\n```bash\npip install agentscope\n```\n\n### 额外依赖\n\n为了支持不同的部署场景，AgentScope提供了若干个可选的依赖项。\n完整的可选依赖项列表请参考[tutorial](https://doc.agentscope.io/en/tutorial/102-installation.html)\n以分布式模式为例，可以使用以下命令安装AgentScope：\n\n#### On Windows\n\n```bash\n# From source\npip install -e .[distribute]\n# From pypi\npip install agentscope[distribute]\n```\n\n#### On Mac & Linux\n\n```bash\n# From source\npip install -e .\\[distribute\\]\n# From pypi\npip install agentscope\\[distribute\\]\n```\n\n## 快速开始\n\n### 配置\n\nAgentScope中，模型的部署和调用是通过`ModelWrapper`实现解耦的。\n\n为了使用这些`ModelWrapper`, 您需要准备如下的模型配置文件：\n\n```python\nmodel_config = {\n    # 模型配置的名称，以及使用的模型wrapper\n    \"config_name\": \"{your_config_name}\",          # 模型配置的名称\n    \"model_type\": \"{model_type}\",                 # 模型wrapper的类型\n\n    # 用以初始化模型wrapper的详细参数\n    # ...\n}\n```\n\n以OpenAI Chat API为例，模型配置如下：\n\n```python\nopenai_model_config = {\n    \"config_name\": \"my_openai_config\",             # 模型配置的名称\n    \"model_type\": \"openai_chat\",                   # 模型wrapper的类型\n\n    # 用以初始化模型wrapper的详细参数\n    \"model_name\": \"gpt-4\",                         # OpenAI API中的模型名\n    \"api_key\": \"xxx\",                              # OpenAI API的API密钥。如果未设置，将使用环境变量OPENAI_API_KEY。\n    \"organization\": \"xxx\",                         # OpenAI API的组织。如果未设置，将使用环境变量OPENAI_ORGANIZATION。\n}\n```\n\n关于部署本地模型服务和准备模型配置的更多细节，请参阅我们的[教程](https://modelscope.github.io/agentscope/index.html#welcome-to-agentscope-tutorial-hub)。\n\n### 创建Agent\n\n创建AgentScope内置的`DialogAgent`和`UserAgent`对象.\n\n```python\nfrom agentscope.agents import DialogAgent, UserAgent\nimport agentscope\n\n# 加载模型配置\nagentscope.init(model_configs=\"./model_configs.json\")\n\n# 创建对话Agent和用户Agent\ndialog_agent = DialogAgent(name=\"assistant\",\n                           model_config_name=\"my_openai_config\")\nuser_agent = UserAgent()\n```\n\n#### 构造对话\n\n在AgentScope中，**Message**是Agent之间的桥梁，它是一个python**字典**（dict），包含两个必要字段`name`和`content`，以及一个可选字段`url`用于本地文件（图片、视频或音频）或网络链接。\n\n```python\nfrom agentscope.message import Msg\n\nx = Msg(name=\"Alice\", content=\"Hi!\")\nx = Msg(\"Bob\", \"What about this picture I took?\", url=\"/path/to/picture.jpg\")\n```\n\n使用以下代码开始两个Agent（dialog_agent和user_agent）之间的对话：\n\n```python\nx = None\nwhile True:\n  x = dialog_agent(x)\n  x = user_agent(x)\n  if x.content == \"exit\": # 用户输入\"exit\"退出对话\n    break\n```\n\n### AgentScope前端\n\nAgentScope 提供了一个易于使用的运行时用户界面，能够在前端显示多模态输出，包括文本、图像、音频和视频。\n\n参考我们的[教程](https://modelscope.github.io/agentscope/zh_CN/tutorial/209-gui.html)了解更多细节。\n\n<h5 align=\"center\">\n<img
