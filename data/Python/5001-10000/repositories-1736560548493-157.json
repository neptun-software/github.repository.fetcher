The most important ones\nare:\n\n* New installers for Windows, Linux and macOS based on Conda and Conda-forge.\n  They come up with a more robust update process and are based on Python 3.11.\n* Add a Debugger pane to explore the stack frame of the current debugging\n  session.\n* Add a button to the Debugger pane to pause the current code execution and\n  enter the debugger afterwards.\n* Add submenu to the `Consoles` menu to start a new console for a specific\n  Conda or Pyenv environment.\n* Add ability to refresh the open Variable Explorer viewers to reflect the current\n  variable value.\n* Add initial support to automatically connect to remote servers through SSH\n  and run code in them. This functionality can be found in the menu\n  `Consoles > New console in remote server`.\n* Show plots generated in the Variable Explorer or its viewers in the Plots pane.\n* Show Matplotlib backend and Python environment information in the status bar.\n* Make kernel restarts be much faster for the current interpreter.\n* Add experimental support for Qt 6 and increase minimal required version to\n  Qt 5.15.\n* Turn `runfile`, `debugfile`, `runcell` and related commands into IPython magics.\n Environment variables declared in `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zhrc` are detected and\n  passed to the IPython console.\n* Support all real number dtypes in the dataframe viewer.\n* Respect Matplotlib user settings configured outside Spyder.\n* Increase DPI of Matplotlib plots so they look better in high resolution screens.\n* Allow to copy the absolute and relative paths of the current file to the tabs'\n  context menu of the Editor.\n* Restore ability to load Hdf5 and Dicom files through the Variable Explorer\n  (this was working in Spyder 4 and before).\n* Add ability to disable external plugins in `Preferences > Plugins`.\n* Use a simpler filesystem watcher in Projects to improve performance.\n* Make Spyder accept Chinese, Korean or Japanese input on Linux by adding\n  `fcitx-qt5` as a new dependency (in conda environments only).\n* The file switcher can browse and open files present in the current project (\n  in conda environments or if the `fzf` package is installed).\n* Improve how options are displayed and handled in several Variable Explorer\n  viewers.\n* The interface font used by the entire application can be configured in\n  `Preferences > Appearance`.\n* Files can be opened in the editor by pasting their path in the Working\n  Directory toolbar.\n* Add a new button to the Variable Explorer to indicate when variables are being\n  filtered.\n* Show intro message for panes that don't display content at startup.\n* Add a Switcher plugin for the files and symbols switcher.\n* Add a Debugger plugin to centralize all functionality related to debugging.\n* Add an External Terminal plugin to execute Python and Bash/Batch/PS1 files on\n  a system terminal.\n* Generalize the Run plugin to support generic inputs and executors. This allows\n  plugins to declare what kind of inputs (i.e. file, cell or selection) they\n  can execute and how they will display the result.\n* Declare a proper API for the Projects plugin.\n* The Editor now uses the API introduced in Spyder 5. That was the last built-in\n  plugin that needed to be migrated to it.\n* The Breakpoints plugin was removed and its functionality moved to the Debugger\n  one.\n\nFor a complete list of changes, please see our\n[changelog](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/blob/6.x/CHANGELOG.md)\n\nSpyder 5.0 has been a huge success and we hope 6.0 will be as successful. For that we\nfixed 123 bugs and merged 292 pull requests from about 22 authors.\n\nDon't forget to follow Spyder updates/news on the project's\n[website](https://www.spyder-ide.org).\n\nLast, but not least, we welcome any contribution that helps making Spyder an\nefficient scientific development/computing environment. Join us to help creating\nyour favorite environment!\n\nEnjoy!\n-Daniel\n\n\n----\n\n\n# Major release to others\n\n**Note**: Leave this free of Markdown because it could go to mailing lists that\ndon't support html.\n\n**Subject**: [ANN] Spyder 4.0 is released!\n\n\nHi all,\n\nOn the behalf of the Spyder Project Contributors (https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/graphs/contributors),\nI'm pleased to announce that Spyder 3.0 has been released and is available for\nWindows, GNU/Linux and MacOS X: https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/releases\n\nSpyder is a free, open-source (MIT license) interactive development environment\nfor the Python language with advanced editing, interactive testing, debugging\nand introspection features. It was designed to provide MATLAB-like features\n(integrated help, interactive console, variable explorer with GUI-based editors\nfor NumPy arrays and Pandas dataframes), it is strongly oriented towards\nscientific computing and software development.\n\n<The rest is the same as for the list>\n\n\n----\n\n\n# Alpha/beta/rc release\n\n**Subject**: [ANN] Spyder 6.0 rc2 is released!\n\n\nHi all,\n\nOn the behalf of the [Spyder Project Contributors](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/graphs/contributors),\nI'm pleased to announce the second beta of our next major version: Spyder **6.0**.\n\nWe've been working on this version for more than one year now and it's working\nrelatively well. We encourage all people who like the bleeding edge to give it a try.\n\nSpyder 6.0 comes with the following interesting new features and fixes:\n\n- New features\n    * New installers for Windows, Linux and macOS based on Conda and Conda-forge.\n    * Add a Debugger pane to explore the stack frame of the current debugging\n      session.\n    * Add a button to the Debugger pane to pause the current code execution and\n      enter the debugger afterwards.\n    * Add submenu to the `Consoles` menu to start a new console for a specific\n      Conda or Pyenv environment.\n    * Add ability to refresh the open Variable Explorer viewers to reflect the current\n      variable state.\n    * Show plots generated in the Variable Explorer or its viewers in the Plots pane.\n    * Show Matplotlib backend state in status bar.\n    * Make kernel restarts be much faster for the current interpreter.\n    * Turn `runfile`, `debugfile`, `runcell` and related commands into IPython magics.\n    * Add a new way to manage and establish connections with remote servers/kernels\n\n- Important fixes\n    * Environment variables declared in `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zhrc` are detected and\n      passed to the IPython console.\n    * Support all real number dtypes in the dataframe viewer.\n    * Restore ability to load Hdf5 and Dicom files through the Variable Explorer\n      (this was working in Spyder 4 and before).\n\n- New API features\n    * `SpyderPluginV2.get_description` must be a static method now and\n      `SpyderPluginV2.get_icon` a class or static method. This is necessary to\n      display the list of available plugins in Preferences in a more user-friendly\n      way (see PR spyder-ide/spyder#21101).\n    * Generalize the Run plugin to support generic inputs and executors. This allows\n      plugins to declare what kind of inputs (i.e. file, cell or selection) they\n      can execute and how they will display the result.\n    * Add a new plugin called Switcher for the files and symbols switcher.\n    * Declare a proper API for the Projects plugin.\n    * Remove the Breakpoints plugin and add its functionality to the Debugger one.\n\nFor a more complete list of changes, please see our\n[changelog](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/blob/master/changelogs/Spyder-6.md)\n\nYou can easily install this release candidate if you use conda by running:\n\n    conda install -c conda-forge/label/spyder_dev -c conda-forge/label/spyder_kernels_rc -c conda-forge spyder=6.0.0rc2\n\nOr you can use pip with this command:\n\n    pip install --pre -U spyder\n\n\nEnjoy!\nDaniel\n"

          "content": "# Contributing to Spyder\n\n:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spyder! :tada::+1:\n\n\n## General Guidelines\n\nThis page documents at a very high level how to contribute to Spyder. Please check the [Spyder IDE Contributor Documentation](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/wiki/Contributing-to-Spyder) for a more detailed guide on how to do so.\nAlso, make sure you're familiar with our [Github workflow](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/wiki/Dev:-Github-Workflow).\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nBefore posting a report, *please* carefully read our **[Troubleshooting Guide](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/wiki/Troubleshooting-Guide-and-FAQ)** and search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/issues) for your error message and problem description, as the great majority of bugs are either duplicates, or can be fixed on the user side with a few easy steps. Thanks!\n\n\n## Submitting a Helpful Issue\n\nSubmitting useful, effective and to-the-point issue reports can go a long way toward improving Spyder for everyone. Accordingly, please read the [relevant section](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/wiki/Troubleshooting-Guide-and-FAQ#calling-for-help-still-have-a-problem) of the Spyder Troubleshooting Guide, which describes in detail how to do just that.\n\nMost importantly, aside from the error message/traceback and the requested environment/dependency information, *please* be sure you include a detailed, step by step description of exactly what triggered the problem. Otherwise, we likely won't be able to find and fix it, and your issue will have to be closed after a week (7 days). Thanks!\n\n\n## Setting Up a Development Environment\n\n### Forking and cloning the repo\n\nFirst, navigate to the [Spyder repo](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder) in your web browser and press the ``Fork`` button to make a personal copy of the repository on your own Github account.\nThen, click the ``Clone or Download`` button on your repository, copy the link and run the following on the command line to clone the repo:\n\n```bash\n$ git clone <LINK-TO-YOUR-REPO>\n```\n\nFinally, set the upstream remote to the official Spyder repo with:\n\n```bash\n$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder.git\n```\n\n\n### Creating an environment and installing dependencies\n\nIf you use Anaconda or Conda-forge, you can create an environment and install the necessary dependencies as follows:\n\n```bash\n$ conda create -n spyder-dev -c conda-forge python=3.9\n$ conda activate spyder-dev\n$ conda env update --file requirements/main.yml\n```\n\nAfter doing that, you need to install Spyder's specific dependencies per operating system. For instance, if you're working on macOS you need to run\n\n```bash\n$ conda env update --file requirements/macos.yml\n```\n\nYou can also use `virtualenv` on Linux, but `conda` is **strongly** recommended:\n\n```bash\n$ mkvirtualenv spyder-dev\n$ workon spyder-dev\n(spyder-dev) $ pip install -e .\n```\n\n\n### Running Spyder\n\nTo run Spyder from your clone in its development mode, with extra checks and options (pass `--help` to see them), launch it via the `bootstrap.py` script in the repo root directory:\n\n```bash\n$ python bootstrap.py\n```\n\nNote that if you are running on macOS 10.15 or earlier, you will need to call `pythonw` instead of `python`.\n\nTo start Spyder in debug mode, useful for tracking down an issue, you can run:\n\n```bash\n$ python bootstrap.py --debug\n```\n\n**Important Note**: To test any changes you've made to the Spyder source code, you need to restart Spyder or start a fresh instance (you can run multiple copies simultaneously by unchecking the Preferences option <kbd>Use a single instance</kbd> under <kbd>General</kbd> > <kbd>Advanced Settings</kbd> .\n\nTo start Spyder with different Qt bindings (e.g. PySide2 or PyQt6), you can run:\n\n```bash\n$ python bootstrap.py --gui pyqt6\n```\n\nTo access Spyder command line options from `bootstrap.py`, you need to run:\n\n```bash\n$ python bootstrap.py -- --help\n```\n\nNote that `bootstrap.py` has its own command line options, which can be listed by running:\n\n```bash\n$ python bootstrap.py --help\n```\n\n\n###  Running tests\n\nTo install our test dependencies under Anaconda:\n\n```bash\n$ conda env update --file requirements/tests.yml\n```\n\nIf using `pip` (for experts only), run the following from the directory where your git clone is stored:\n\n```bash\n$ pip install -e .[test]\n```\n\nTo run the Spyder test suite, please use (from the `spyder` root directory):\n\n```bash\n$ python runtests.py\n```\n\n\n## Spyder Branches\n\nTo start working on a new pull request you need to execute these commands, filling in the branch name where appropriate:\n\n```bash\n$ git checkout master\n$ git pull upstream master\n$ git checkout -b <NAME-NEW-BRANCH>\n```\n\n\n## Making contributions that depend on pull requests in spyder-kernels\n\nSpyder and spyder-kernels are developed jointly because a lot of communication happens between them in order to run code written in the editor in the IPython console.\n\nFor this reason, a clone of spyder-kernels is placed in the `external-deps` subfolder of the Spyder repository. The instructions on this section will help you in case you need to make changes that touch both repositories at the same time.\n\nThe first thing you need to do is cloning the [git-subrepo](https://github.com/ingydotnet/git-subrepo) project and follow these instructions to install it (on Windows you need to use Git Bash in order to run them):\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/ingydotnet/git-subrepo /path/to/git-subrepo\necho 'source /path/to/git-subrepo/.rc' >> ~/.bashrc\nsource ~/.bashrc\n```\n\nAs an example, let's assume that (i) your Github user name is `myuser`; (ii) you have two git clones placed at `~/spyder` and `~/spyder-kernels` that link to `https://github.com/myuser/spyder` and `https://github.com/myuser/spyder-kernels` respectively; and (iii) you have two branches named `fix_in_spyder` and `fix_in_kernel` in each of these git repos respectively. If you want to open a joint PR in `spyder` and `spyder-kernels` that link these branches, here is how to do it:\n\n* Go to the `~/spyder` folder, checkout your `fix_in_spyder` branch and replace the spyder-kernels clone in the `external-deps` subfolder by a clone of your `fix_in_kernel` branch:\n\n    ```\n    $ cd ~/spyder\n    $ git checkout fix_in_spyder\n    $ git subrepo pull external-deps/spyder-kernels -r https://github.com/myuser/spyder-kernels.git -b fix_in_kernel -u -f\n    ```\n\n* You can now open a PR on `https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder` and on `https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder-kernels` for each of your branches.\n\n* If you make additional changes to the `fix_in_kernel` branch in `spyder-kernels` (e.g. adding a new file, as in the example below), you need to sync them in your Spyder's `fix_in_spyder` branch like this:\n\n    ```\n    $ cd ~/spyder-kernels\n    $ git checkout fix_in_kernel\n    $ touch foo.py\n    $ git add -A\n    $ git commit -m \"Adding foo.py to the repo\"\n    $ git push origin fix_in_kernel\n\n    $ cd ~/spyder\n    $ git checkout fix_in_spyder\n    $ git subrepo pull external-deps/spyder-kernels -r https://github.com/myuser/spyder-kernels.git -b fix_in_kernel -u -f\n    $ git push origin fix_in_spyder\n    ```\n\n* When your `fix_in_kernel` PR is merged, you need to update Spyder's `fix_in_spyder` branch because the clone in Spyder's repo must point out again to the spyder-kernel's repo and not to your own clone. For that, please run:\n\n    ```\n    $ git subrepo pull external-deps/spyder-kernels -r https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder-kernels.git -b master -u -f\n    ```\n\n\n## Making contributions that depend on pull requests in python-lsp-server or qtconsole\n\nAs with spyder-kernels, Spyder is tightly integrated with the [python-lsp-server](https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-server) to provide code completion, linting and folding on its editor; and [qtconsole](https://github.com/jupyter/qtconsole) for its IPython console.\n\nDue to that, a clone of those projects is placed in the `external-deps` directory, which is managed with the `git subrepo` project. If you want to make a pull request in python-lsp-server or qtconsole that affects functionality in Spyder, please read carefully the instructions in the previous section because they are very similar for those cases. A summary of those instructions applied to these projects is the following:\n\n* First you need to create a pull request in python-lsp-server or qtconsole with the changes you want to make there. Let's assume the branch from which that pull request is created is called `fix_in_external_dep`.\n\n* Then you need to create a branch in Spyder (let's call it `fix_in_spyder`) with the fixes that require that pull request and update the python-lsp-server subrepo. For that you need to execute the following commands:\n\n    ```\n    $ git checkout -b fix_in_spyder\n    $ git subrepo pull external-deps/python-lsp-server -r https://github.com/myuser/python-lsp-server.git -b fix_in_external_dep -u -f\n    ```\n\n    in case the fix is in python-lsp-server, or\n\n    ```\n    $ git checkout -b fix_in_spyder\n    $ git subrepo pull external-deps/qtconsole -r https://github.com/myuser/qtconsole.git -b fix_in_external_dep -u -f\n    ```\n\n    if the fix is in qtconsole. And then commit the changes you need to make in Spyder.\n\n* If you need to add more commits to `fix_in_external_dep`, you need to update `fix_in_spyder` with these commands:\n\n    ```\n    $ git checkout fix_in_spyder\n    $ git subrepo pull external-deps/python-lsp-server -r https://github.com/myuser/python-lsp-server.git -b fix_in_external_dep -u -f\n    $ git push origin fix_in_spyder\n    ```\n\n    or\n\n    ```\n    $ git checkout fix_in_spyder\n    $ git subrepo pull external-deps/qtconsole -r https://github.com/myuser/qtconsole.git -b fix_in_external_dep -u -f\n    $ git push origin fix_in_spyder\n    ```\n\n* After `fix_in_external_dep` is merged, you need to update the python-lsp-server or qtconsole subrepos in your `fix_in_spyder` branch with\n\n    ```\n    $ git checkout fix_in_spyder\n    $ git subrepo pull external-deps/python-lsp-server -r https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-server.git -b develop -u -f\n    ```\n\n    or\n\n    ```\n    $ git checkout fix_in_spyder\n    $ git subrepo pull external-deps/qtconsole -r https://github.com/jupyter/qtconsole.git -b main -u -f\n    ```\n\n\n## Guidelines for Spyder API changes\n\nIf your work makes changes to public classes, methods or Qt signals in `spyder.api`, or to the public interface of any plugin (e.g. `plugins/editor/plugin.py`), you must add a note about it in the current Changelog (e.g. `changelogs/Spyder-6.md`).\nIf an entry for the version where your PR will be included doesn't exist yet, create one (with `Unreleased` as its date) and a subsection called `API changes`.\n\nPlease note that the Spyder API must be changed according to the following guidelines:\n\n* For bugfix versions (e.g. `6.0.3`), you can only add new Qt signals or methods, or kwargs to current methods.\n* For minor versions (e.g. `6.1.0`), you should try to do the same as for bugfix versions, unless it's **strictly** necessary to break the API by removing or changing certain Qt signals, classes or methods in a backwards incompatible way.\n* For major versions (e.g. `7.0.0`), there are no restrictions on API changes.\n\n\n## Adding Third-Party Content\n\nAll files or groups of files, including source code, images, icons, and other assets, that originate from projects outside of the Spyder organization (regardless of the license), must be first approved by the Spyder team. Always check with us (on Github, Gitter, Google Group, etc) before attempting to add content from an external project, and only do so when necessary.\n\n\n### Licenses\n\nCode considered for inclusion must be under a permissive (i.e. non-copyleft) license, particularly as the following (in order of preference):\n\n* MIT (Expat)\n* Public domain (preferably, CC0)\n* ISC license\n* BSD 2-clause (\"Simplified BSD\")\n* BSD 3-clause (\"New\" or \"Modified BSD\")\n* Apache License 2.0\n\nAdditionally, external assets (fonts, icons, images, sounds, animations) can generally be under one of the following weak-copyleft and content licenses:\n\n* Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 or 4.0\n* SIL Open Font License 1.1\n* GNU LGPL 2.1 or 3.0\n\nAdditional licenses *may* qualify for these lists from time to time, but every effort should be made to avoid it. Regardless, all such licenses must be OSI, FSF, and DSFG approved as well as GPLv3-compatible to ensure maximum free distribution and use of Spyder with minimum ambiguity or fragmentation.\n\n\n### Steps to take\n\n1. Contact the Spyder team to ensure the usage is justified and compatible.\n\n2. Add the files, preserving any original copyright/legal/attribution header\n\n3. If making non-trivial modifications, copy the standard Spyder copyright header from ``.ciocopyright`` to just below the original headers; if the original headers are unformatted and just consist of a copyright statement and perhaps mention of the license, incorporate them verbatim within the Spyder header where appropriate. Always ensure copyright statements are in ascending chronological order, and replace the year in the Spyder copyright statement with the current one. Modify the license location to be the current directory, or NOTICE.txt.\n\n4. Include the following line at the end of each module's docstring, separated by blank lines:\n\n   ```rst\n   Adapted from path/to/file/in/original/repo.py of the\n   `Project Name <url-to-original-github-repo>`_.\n   ```\n\n   For example,\n\n   ```rst\n   Adapted from qcrash/_dialogs/gh_login.py of the\n   `QCrash Project <https://github.com/ColinDuquesnoy/QCrash>`_.\n   ```\n\n5. Convert the files to project standards where needed.\n\n6. If the copied file(s) reside in a directory dedicated to them, place the source project's LICENSE.txt file there, and any other legal files. Also, mention the same in the __init__.py file in that directory.\n\n7. Add an entry in NOTICE.txt with the instructions and template there.\n\n8. If a non-code visible asset (icons, fonts, animations, etc) or otherwise under a Creative Commons license, include a mention in the appropriate section of the README, as well as Spyder's About dialog, in the same form as the others present there.\n\n\n## More information\n\n[Main Website](https://www.spyder-ide.org/)\n\n[Download Spyder (with Anaconda)](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)\n\n[Online Documentation](https://docs.spyder-ide.org/)\n\n[Spyder Github](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder)\n\n[Troubleshooting Guide and FAQ](\nhttps://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/wiki/Troubleshooting-Guide-and-FAQ)\n\n[Development Wiki](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/wiki/Dev:-Index)\n\n[Gitter Chatroom](https://gitter.im/spyder-ide/public)\n\n[Google Group](https://groups.google.com/group/spyderlib)\n\n[@Spyder_IDE on Twitter](https://twitter.com/spyder_ide)\n\n[@SpyderIDE on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/SpyderIDE/)\n\n[Support Spyder on OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/spyder/)\n"

(Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\n    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nGNU Lesser General Public License 2.1\n-------------------------------------\n\n\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 2.1, February 1999\n\n Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\na de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\nallowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\nand installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\n    least three years, to give the same user the materials\n    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n    than the cost of performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\nand the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\nan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\nso that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\nexcluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\nwritten in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\nordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\nsafest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\n    Lesser General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library, if\nnecessary.

Additional Definitions.\n\n  As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n\n  \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\n  An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\n\n  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version.\n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License \"or any later version\"\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\nLibrary.\n\n\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works.\n\n  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nCreative Commons Attribution 3.0 International (CC-BY 3.0)\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nCreative Commons Legal Code\n\nAttribution 3.0 Unported\n\n    CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE\n    LEGAL SERVICES.

TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY\nBE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS\nCONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND\nCONDITIONS.\n\n1. Definitions\n\n a. \"Adaptation\" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and\n    other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,\n    derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a\n    literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes\n    cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be\n    recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably\n    derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a\n    Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of\n    this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical\n    work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in\n    timed-relation with a moving image (\"synching\") will be considered an\n    Adaptation for the purpose of this License.\n b. \"Collection\" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as\n    encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or\n    broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed\n    in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and\n    arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in\n    which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along\n    with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and\n    independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a\n    collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be\n    considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this\n    License.\n c. \"Distribute\" means to make available to the public the original and\n    copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or\n    other transfer of ownership.\n d. \"Licensor\" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that\n    offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.\n e. \"Original Author\" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work,\n    the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work\n    or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in\n    addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers,\n    musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim,\n    play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or\n    expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer\n    being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a\n    performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the\n    organization that transmits the broadcast.\n f. \"Work\" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms\n    of this License including without limitation any production in the\n    literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or\n    form of its expression including digital form, such as a book,\n    pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work\n    of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a\n    choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical\n    composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are\n    assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography;\n    a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or\n    lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works\n    expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied\n    art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work\n    relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a\n    performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the\n    extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by\n    a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise\n    considered a literary or artistic work.\n g. \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this\n    License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with\n    respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the\n    Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous\n    violation.\n h. \"Publicly Perform\" means to perform public recitations of the Work and\n    to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or\n    process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital\n    performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that\n    members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a\n    place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public\n    by any means or process and the communication to the public of the\n    performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to\n    broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs,\n    sounds or images.\n i. \"Reproduce\" means to make copies of the Work by any means including\n    without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of\n    fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a\n    protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic\n    medium.\n\n2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,\nlimit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from\nlimitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the\ncopyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.\n\n3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,\nLicensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,\nperpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to\nexercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\n\n a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more\n    Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the\n    Collections;\n b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,\n    including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to\n    clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made\n    to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked \"The\n    original work was translated from English to Spanish,\" or a\n    modification could indicate \"The original work has been modified.\";\n c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated\n    in Collections; and,\n d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.\n e. For the avoidance of doubt:\n\n     i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in\n        which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\n        compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor\n        reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any\n        exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;\n    ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in\n        which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\n        compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the\n        exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You\n        of the rights granted under this License; and,\n   iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to\n        collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the\n        Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers\n        voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise\n        by You of the rights granted under this License.\n\nThe above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now\nknown or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make\nsuch modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in\nother media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly\ngranted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n\n4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made\nsubject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n\n a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms\n    of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource\n    Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You\n    Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms\n    on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of\n    the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that\n    recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the\n    Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and\n    to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You\n    Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly\n    Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological\n    measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the\n    Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under\n    the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as\n    incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection\n    apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this\n    License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You\n    must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit\n    as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an\n    Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent\n    practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by\n    Section 4(b), as requested.\n b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or\n    Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to\n    Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and\n    provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the\n    name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,\n    and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party\n    or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for\n    attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice,\n    terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party\n    or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the\n    extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor\n    specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not\n    refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;\n    and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation,\n    a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,\n    \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay\n    based on original Work by Original Author\"). The credit required by\n    this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;\n    provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at\n    a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing\n    authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these\n    credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the\n    other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only\n    use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution\n    in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this\n    License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any\n    connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,\n    Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your\n    use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written\n    permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution\n    Parties.\n c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be\n    otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or\n    Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any\n    Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or\n    take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be\n    prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor\n    agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise\n    of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to\n    make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,\n    modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original\n    Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert,\n    as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the\n    applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your\n    right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations)\n    but not otherwise.\n\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR\nOFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY\nKIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,\nINCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF\nLATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,\nWHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION\nOF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE\nLAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR\nANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES\nARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS\nBEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. Termination\n\n a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n    automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.\n    Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections\n    from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses\n    terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full\n    compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will\n    survive any termination of this License.\n b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is\n    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).\n    Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the\n    Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at\n    any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to\n    withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is\n    required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this\n    License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as\n    stated above.\n\n8. Miscellaneous\n\n a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,\n    the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same\n    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor\n    offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same\n    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under\n    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\n    the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action\n    by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to\n    the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and\n    enforceable.\n d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no\n    breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing\n    and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\n e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with\n    respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,\n    agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified\n    here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that\n    may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be\n    modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\n f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this\n    License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention\n    for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on\n    September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright\n    Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996\n    and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971).\n    These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant\n    jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced\n    according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of\n    those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the\n    standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law\n    includes additional rights not granted under this License, such\n    additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this\n    License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under\n    applicable law.\n\n\nCreative Commons Notice\n\n    Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty\n    whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be\n    liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages\n    whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special,\n    incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this\n    license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative\n    Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it\n    shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.\n\n    Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the\n    Work is licensed under the CCPL, Creative Commons does not authorize\n    the use by either party of the trademark \"Creative Commons\" or any\n    related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior\n    written consent of Creative Commons.

The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n    authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to\n    exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary\n    to circumvent Effective Technological Measures.

No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional\n    or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological\n    Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n    Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.\n\n    No endorsement.

Attribution.\n\n    If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:\n\n    A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed\n    Material:\n\n    i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others\n    designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);\n\n    ii. a copyright notice;\n\n    iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n    iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;\n\n    v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably\n    practicable;\n\n    B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication\n    of any previous modifications; and\n\n    C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License,\n    and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n    You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner\n    based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed\n    Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by\n    providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n    information.\n\n    If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information\n    required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.\n\n    If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply\n    must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with\n    this Public License.\n\nSection 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to\nYour use of the Licensed Material:\n\na. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract,\nreuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the\ndatabase;\n\nb. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a\ndatabase in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in\nwhich You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents)\nis Adapted Material; and\n\nc. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a\nsubstantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace\nYour obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include\nother Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\nSection 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability\n\na. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent\npossible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available,\nand makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed\nMaterial, whether express, implied, statutory, or other.

Where a limitation of\nliability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to\nYou.\n\nc. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above\nshall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely\napproximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\n\nSection 6 – Term and Termination\n\na. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights\nlicensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then\nYour rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\n\nb. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section\n6(a), it reinstates:\n\n    automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured\n    within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\n\n    upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the\nLicensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\n\nc. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed\nMaterial under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed\nMaterial at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\n\nd. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\n\nSection 7 – Other Terms and Conditions\n\na. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or\nconditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\nb. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed\nMaterial not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and\nconditions of this Public License.\n\nSection 8 – Interpretation\n\na. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be\ninterpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the\nLicensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this\nPublic License.\n\nb. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed\nunenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent\nnecessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall\nbe severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of\nthe remaining terms and conditions.\n\nc. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to\ncomply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\n\nd. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a\nlimitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the\nLicensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or\nauthority.\n\n    Creative Commons is not a party to its public licenses. Notwithstanding,\n    Creative Commons may elect to apply one of its public licenses to material\n    it publishes and in those instances will be considered the “Licensor.”\n    Except for the limited purpose of indicating that material is shared under\n    a Creative Commons public license or as otherwise permitted by the Creative\n    Commons policies published at creativecommons.org/policies, Creative\n    Commons does not authorize the use of the trademark “Creative Commons” or\n    any other trademark or logo of Creative Commons without its prior written\n    consent including, without limitation, in connection with any unauthorized\n    modifications to any of its public licenses or any other arrangements,\n    understandings, or agreements concerning use of licensed material.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

window](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spyder-ide/spyder/5.x/img_src/screenshot.png)\n\n----\n\n## Help support Spyder, the community-developed scientific IDE!\n\nSpyder development is made possible by contributions from our global user\ncommunity, along with organizations like [NumFOCUS](https://www.numfocus.org)\nand [Quansight](https://www.quansight.com).\nThere are numerous [ways you can help](\nhttps://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/wiki/Contributing-to-Spyder), many of\nwhich don't require any programming. If you'd like to make a [donation](\nhttps://opencollective.com/spyder/donate) to help fund further improvements,\nwe're on [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/spyder).\n\nThanks for all you do to make the Spyder project thrive! [More details](\nhttps://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/wiki/Current-Funding-and-Development-Status)\n\n\n\n----\n\n## Overview\n\nSpyder is a powerful scientific environment written in Python, for Python,\nand designed by and for scientists, engineers and data analysts. It offers a\nunique combination of the advanced editing, analysis, debugging, and profiling\nfunctionality of a comprehensive development tool with the data exploration,\ninteractive execution, deep inspection, and beautiful visualization\ncapabilities of a scientific package.\n\nBeyond its many built-in features, its abilities can be extended even further\nvia its plugin system and API. Furthermore, Spyder can also be used as a PyQt5\nextension library, allowing you to build upon its functionality and embed\nits components, such as the interactive console, in your own software.\n\nFor more general information about Spyder and to stay up to date on the\nlatest Spyder news and information, please check out [our new website](\nhttps://www.spyder-ide.org/).\n\n\n## Core components\n\n* **Editor**\n\n    Work efficiently in a multi-language editor with a function/class browser,\n    real-time code analysis tools (`pyflakes`, `pylint`, and `pycodestyle`),\n    automatic code completion (`jedi` and `rope`),\n    horizontal/vertical splitting, and go-to-definition.\n\n* **Interactive console**\n\n    Harness the power of as many IPython consoles as you like with full\n    workspace and debugging support, all within the flexibility of a full\n    GUI interface. Instantly run your code by line, cell, or file,\n    and render plots right inline with the output or in interactive windows.\n\n* **Documentation viewer**\n\n    Render documentation in real-time with Sphinx for any class or function,\n    whether external or user-created, from either the Editor or a Console.\n\n* **Variable explorer**\n\n    Inspect any variables, functions or objects created during your session.\n    Editing and interaction is supported with many common types, including\n    numeric/strings/bools, Python lists/tuples/dictionaries, dates/timedeltas,\n    Numpy arrays, Pandas index/series/dataframes, PIL/Pillow images, and more.\n\n* **Development tools**\n\n    Examine your code with the static analyzer, trace its execution with the\n    interactive debugger, and unleash its performance with the profiler.\n    Keep things organized with project support and a built-in file explorer, and\n    use find in files to search across entire projects with full regex support.\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nYou can read the Spyder documentation online on [the Spyder Docs website](\nhttps://docs.spyder-ide.org/).\n\n\n## Installation\n\nFor a detailed guide to installing Spyder, please refer to our\n[installation instructions](https://docs.spyder-ide.org/installation.html).\n\nThe easiest way to install Spyder on any of our supported platforms\nis to download it as part of the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)\ndistribution, and use the `conda` package and environment manager to keep it\nand your other packages installed and up to date.\n\nIf in doubt, you should always install Spyder via this method to avoid\nunexpected issues we are unable to help you with; it generally has the\nleast likelihood of potential pitfalls for non-experts, and we may be\nable to provide limited assistance if you do run into trouble.\n\nOther installation options exist, including:\n\n* The [WinPython](https://winpython.github.io/) distribution for Windows\n* The [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) project for macOS\n* Your distribution's package manager (i.e. `apt-get`, `yum`, etc) on Linux\n* The `pip` package manager, included with most Python installations\n\n**However**, we lack the resources to provide individual support for users who\ninstall via these methods, and they may be out of date or contain bugs outside\nour control, so we recommend the Anaconda version instead if you run into issues.\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nBefore posting a report, *please* carefully read our **[Troubleshooting Guide](\nhttps://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/wiki/Troubleshooting-Guide-and-FAQ)**\nand search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/issues)\nfor your error message and problem description, as the great majority of bugs\nare either duplicates, or can be fixed on the user side with a few easy steps.\nThanks!\n\n\n## Contributing and Credits\n\nSpyder was originally created by [Pierre Raybaut](\nhttps://github.com/PierreRaybaut), and is currently maintained by\n[Carlos Córdoba](https://github.com/ccordoba12) and an international\ncommunity of volunteers.\n\nYou can join us—everyone is welcome to help with Spyder!\nPlease read our [contributing instructions](\nhttps://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\nto get started!\n\nCertain source files are distributed under other compatible permissive licenses\nand/or originally by other authors.\nThe icons for the Spyder 3 theme are derived from [Font Awesome](\nhttps://fontawesome.com/) 4.7 (© 2016 David Gandy;

          "content": "# Instructions to release a new Spyder version\n\nTo release a new version of Spyder you need to follow these steps:\n\n\n## Create backport PR for new minor versions\n\nBefore releasing a new minor version (e.g. 6.1.0 after 6.0.x) that needs to include many changes only available in `master`, it's necessary to create a PR to backport those changes to the stable branch.\n\nFor that you need to run the following commands:\n\n- `git checkout 6.x`\n- `git checkout -b backport-for-minor-version`\n- `git diff master 6.x > minor.patch`\n- `patch -p1 -R < minor.patch`\n- `git add .` and `git commit -m \"Backport changes for X.X.X\"`\n\n\n## Update translation strings (at least one week before the release)\n\n* Install [gettext-helpers](https://github.com/spyder-ide/gettext-helpers) from source.\n\n* Create a new PR to update our `*.pot` and `*.po` files by running\n\n      spyder-gettext scan spyder\n\n* Check that no warnings are emitted by that command. If they are, then fix them in the same PR.\n\n* Merge that PR.\n\n* Close the current translation PR, i.e. the one with the title `New Crowdin updates`.\n\n* Delete the `translate/<branch-name>` branch associated to that PR.\n\n* Go to the integrations page on Crowdin:\n\n  https://crowdin.com/project/spyder/apps/system/github\n\n* Press `Sync now` there to open a new translation PR.\n\n* Send a message to translators on Crowdin to update their translations:\n\n  https://crowdin.com/messages\n\n  An example of that message can be found in\n\n  https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/14117\n\n\n## Before starting the release\n\n### Merge translations from Crowdin\n\n* Checkout the translations branch with\n\n      git checkout translate/<branch-name>\n\n* Squash all commits in that branch to leave only one with the command\n\n      git rebase --interactive HEAD~N\n\n  where N is the number of commits on it.\n\n* Change the commit message with\n\n      git commit --amend\n\n  to be `Update and compile translations [ci skip]`\n\n* Generate the `mo` files by running\n\n      spyder-gettext compile spyder\n\n* Remove `mo` files that are still not part of version control.\n\n* Add those files to the previous commit with\n\n      git add .\n      git commit --amend --no-edit\n\n* Push your changes to the translation PR with\n\n      git push -f upstream translate/<branch-name>\n\n* Rename the PR title to be `PR: Update translations from Crowdin`.\n\n* Merge the PR.\n\n* Don't forget to remove your local checkout of `translate/<branch-name>` because that's going to be outdated for next time.\n\n* Update the `<branch-name>` branch as necessary. For example, if translations were done for the stable branch `6.x`, you could do the update with\n\n      git checkout 6.x\n      git fetch upstream\n      git merge upstream/6.x\n\n### Update core dependencies\n\n* Release a new version of `spyder-kernels`, if required.\n\n* Release a new version of `python-lsp-server`, if required.\n\n* Release a new version of `qtconsole`, if required.\n\n* Merge PRs on Conda-forge that update the `spyder-kernels`, `python-lsp-server` and `qtconsole` feedstocks (usually an automatic PR will appear that can be either merged as it is or be used as boilerplate):\n\n  - `spyder-kernels`: https://github.com/conda-forge/spyder-kernels-feedstock\n\n  - `python-lsp-server`: https://github.com/conda-forge/python-lsp-server-feedstock\n\n  - `qtconsole`: https://github.com/conda-forge/qtconsole-feedstock\n\n  **Notes**:\n\n  - Review carefully the release notes of those packages to see if it's necessary to add new dependencies or update the constraints on the current ones (e.g. `jedi >=0.17.2`).\n\n* For spyder-kernels:\n\n  - Switch to the stable branch\n\n        git checkout 6.x\n\n  - Create a new branch in your fork with the name `update-spyder-kernels`\n\n  - Update version in\n    - `setup.py`\n    - `spyder/dependencies.py`\n    - `requirements/{main,windows,macos,linux}.yml`\n    - `binder/environment.yml`\n    - `spyder/plugins/ipythonconsole/__init__.py` (look up for the constants `SPYDER_KERNELS_MIN_VERSION` and `SPYDER_KERNELS_MAX_VERSION`)\n\n      **Note**: Usually, the version of `spyder-kernels` for validation in the IPython Console only needs to be updated for minor or major releases of that package or when doing alphas for Spyder. For bugfix releases the value should remain the same to not hassle users using custom interpreters into updating `spyder-kernels` in their environments. However, this depends on the type of bugs resolved and if it's worthy to reinforce the need of an update even for those versions.\n\n  - Commit with\n\n        git add .\n        git commit -m \"Update spyder-kernels\"\n\n  - Update our subrepo with the following command, but only if a new version is available!\n\n        git subrepo pull external-deps/spyder-kernels\n\n  - Merge this PR to the stable branch.\n\n* For other dependencies\n\n  - Create a new branch in your fork with the name `update-core-deps`\n\n  - Update the version of any packages required before the release in the following files:\n\n    - `setup.py` (look up for the `install_requires` variable and also for the `Loosen constraints to ensure dev versions still work` patch)\n    - `spyder/dependencies.py`\n    - `requirements/{main,windows,macos,linux}.yml`\n    - `binder/environment.yml`\n\n  - Commit with\n\n        git add .\n        git commit -m \"Update core dependencies\"\n\n  - Update our subrepos with the following commands, but only if new versions are available!\n\n        git subrepo pull external-deps/python-lsp-server\n        git subrepo pull external-deps/qtconsole\n\n  - Merge this PR following the procedure mentioned on [`MAINTENANCE.md`](MAINTENANCE.md)\n\n### Check release candidate\n\n* For pre-releases of a new bug fix version\n\n    - Switch to the stable branch\n\n          git checkout 6.x\n\n    - Update version in `__init__.py` (set release version, remove 'dev0', add 'rcX'), then\n\n          git add .\n          git commit -m \"Release X.X.XrcX\"\n\n    - Follow the instructions in the **To do the PyPI release and version tag** section, from the `git clean -xfdi` one onwards.\n\n    - Publish the release to Conda-forge by doing a PR against the `rc` branch of the [spyder-feedstock repo](https://github.com/conda-forge/spyder-feedstock).\n\n        - Create branch for the update\n\n              git checkout rc\n              git fetch upstream\n              git merge upstream/rc\n              git checkout -b update_X.X.XrcX\n\n        - Update `rc` branch in the Spyder feedstock with the latest changes in the `main` one:\n\n            - Create patches between the branches and apply them\n\n                  git checkout main\n                  git fetch upstream\n                  git merge upstream/main\n                  git diff main rc recipe/ \":(exclude)recipe/conda_build_config.yaml\" > recipe.patch\n                  git diff main rc conda-forge.yml > conda-forge.patch\n                  git checkout update_X.X.XrcX\n                  patch -p1 -R < recipe.patch\n                  patch -p1 -R < conda-forge.patch\n\n            -

Download and test the installation of the resulting installers.\n\n* For pre-releases of a new minor or major version:\n\n    - Switch to master\n\n          git checkout master\n\n    - Update version in `__init__.py` (set release version, remove 'dev0', add 'rcX'), then\n\n          git add .\n          git commit -m \"Release X.X.XrcX [ci skip]\"\n\n    - Push changes to master\n\n          git push upstream master\n\n    - Manually activate the following workflows (see [Running a workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/manually-running-a-workflow#running-a-workflow)) via the `Run workflow` button:\n        - [Nightly conda-based installers (`installers-conda.yml` workflow)](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/actions/workflows/installers-conda.yml)\n\n    - Download and test the installation of the resulting artifacts.\n\n* If one of the previous steps fails, merge a fix PR and start the process again with an incremented 'rcX' commit.\n\n\n## Update Changelog, Announcements and metadata files\n\n* Create a PR in master to update those files by following the steps below.\n\n* For a new major release (e.g. 6.0.0):\n\n    - In `CHANGELOG.md`, move entry for current version to the `Older versions` section and add one for the new version.\n    - `git add .` and `git commit -m \"Add link to changelog of new major version\"`\n    - In `.github/workflows/test-*.yml`, add `6.*` to the `branches` sections and remove the oldest branch from them (e.g. `4.*`).\n    - `git add .` and `git commit -m \"CI: Update workflows to run in new stable branch [ci skip]\"`\n\n* For the first alpha of a new major version (e.g 7.0.0a1):\n\n    - Add a new file called `changelogs/Spyder-X+1.md` to the tree (e.g. `changelogs/Spyder-7.md`).\n    - Add `changelogs/Spyder-X+1.md` to `MANIFEST.in`, remove `changelogs/Spyder-X.md` from it and add that path to the `check-manifest/ignore` section of `setup.cfg`.\n\n* Update `changelogs/Spyder-X.md` (`changelogs/Spyder-6.md` for Spyder 6 for example) with `loghub spyder-ide/spyder -m vX.X.X`\n\n* Add sections for `New features`, `Important fixes` and `New API features` in `changelogs/Spyder-X.md`. For this take a look at closed issues and PRs for the current milestone.\n\n* `git add .` and `git commit -m \"Update Changelog\"`\n\n* Update [Announcements.md](Announcements.md) (this goes to our Google group) removing the outdated announcement of the same kind (major, minor, or beta/release candidate)\n\n* `git add .` and `git commit -m \"Update Announcements\"`\n\n* Update [org.spyder_ide.spyder.appdata.xml](scripts/org.spyder_ide.spyder.appdata.xml) adding the version to be released over the `<releases>` tag\n\n* `git add .` and `git commit -m \"Update metadata files\"`\n\n* Once merged, backport the PR that contains these changes to the stable branch (e.g. `6.x`)\n\n\n## To do the PyPI release and version tag\n\n* Close the current milestone on Github\n\n* git pull or git fetch/merge the respective branch that will be released (e.g `6.x` - stable branch or `master` - alphas/betas/rcs of a new minor/major version).\n\n* For a new major release (e.g. version 6.0.0 after 5.5.6):\n\n    - `git checkout -b 6.x`\n    - `git checkout master`\n    - Update version in `__init__.py` to reflect next minor version as dev version (i.e `6.1.0a1.dev0`).\n    - `git add .` and `git commit -m \"Bump version to new minor version\"`\n    - `git checkout 6.x`\n\n* Update version in `__init__.py` (Remove '{a/b/rc}X' and 'dev0' for stable versions; or remove 'dev0' for pre-releases)\n\n* `git add .` and `git commit -m \"Release X.X.X\"`\n\n* `git clean -xfdi` and select option `1`\n\n* `python setup.py sdist`\n\n    *Note*: This needs to be done on a Linux machine to prevent getting permission errors on executable files (see [#21892](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/21892) and [#14494](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/14494)).\n\n* Activate environment with pip packages only\n\n* `pip install -U pip setuptools twine wheel`\n\n* `python setup.py bdist_wheel`\n\n    *Note*: This needs to be done on a Linux machine to prevent getting permission errors in executable files (see [#21892](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/21892) and [#14494](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/14494)).\n\n* Install generated wheel locally and check for errors\n\n* `twine check --strict dist/*`\n\n* `twine upload dist/*`\n\n* Check in PyPI that the new release was published correctly\n\n* `git tag -a vX.X.X -m \"Release X.X.X\"`\n\n* Update version in `__init__.py`:\n    - Add 'a1', 'dev0' and increment patch version for final version releases\n    - Add 'dev0' and increment alpha/beta/rc version for pre-releases\n\n* `git add .` and `git commit -m \"Back to work [ci skip]\"`\n\n* Push changes and new tag to the corresponding branches. When doing a stable release from `6.x`, for example, you could push changes with\n\n      git push upstream 6.x\n      git push upstream --tags\n\n\n## After the PyPI release\n\n* Merge PR on Conda-forge for Spyder. For that you can go to the [spyder-feedstock repo](https://github.com/conda-forge/spyder-feedstock) and merge the corresponding PR for the new release (usually an automatic PR will appear that can be either merged as it is or be use as boilerplate).\n\n  **Notes**:\n\n  - Don't forget to add new dependencies and update constraints on the rest of them. For that, you need to compare line by line the contents of the `recipe/meta.yaml` file in the feedstock with [setup.py](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/blob/master/setup.py)\n\n* Update Binder related elements when the new Spyder version is available in Conda-forge:\n  - Update the Spyder version on the environment file ([`binder/environment.yml`](https://github.com/spyder-ide/binder-environments/blob/spyder-stable/binder/environment.yml)) of the ([`spyder-stable` branch](https://github.com/spyder-ide/binder-environments/tree/spyder-stable)) in the `binder-environments` repo.\n  - Update `environment.yml` files of the [`master`](https://github.com/spyder-ide/binder-environments/blob/master/binder/environment.yml) branch of `binder-environments` with the contents of the `binder/environment.yml` file present on this repo.\n  - Update `environment.yml` files of the [`6.x`](https://github.com/spyder-ide/binder-environments/blob/6.x/binder/environment.yml) branches of `binder-environments` with the contents of the `binder/environment.yml` file present on this repo.\n\n* Publish release in our [Github Releases page](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/releases):\n  - Copy the contents of the previous release description (updating the relevant information and links to point to the new Spyder version and changelog entry).\n  - Edit the previous release description to only have the changelog line.\n\n* Publish release announcement to our [list](https://groups.google.com/group/spyderlib) (following [Announcements.md](Announcements.md)) after the installers have been built.\n"

          "content": "# Reviewer Guidelines\n\nReviewing pull requests (PRs) can take many forms and be reflected across many styles.\nTo help make the process more clear for contributors, the following guidelines are designed to scope review and specify what areas of feedback block PRs from merging.\n\n**Note:** These guidelines have been merged for a trial period until the end of May 2022, and will not be enforced by the Code of Conduct until the next iteration of this document is posted.\nFeedback on the guidelines is appreciated and can be given via [opening an issue on the main Spyder repo](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/new/choose).\n\n## Etiquette Guidelines\n\n### Communication principles\n\nReviewing open pull requests (PRs) helps move the project forward.\nIt is a great way to get familiar with the codebase and should motivate the contributor to keep involved in the project.\n\n- Every PR is an act of generosity.\n  Opening with a positive comment will help the author feel rewarded, and your subsequent remarks may be heard more clearly.\n  You may feel good also.\n- Begin if possible with the large issues, so the author knows they’ve been understood.\nResist the temptation to immediately go line by line, or to open with small pervasive issues.\n- Do not let perfect be the enemy of the good.\n\nIf you find yourself making many small suggestions that don’t fall into the Review Guidelines, consider the following approaches:\n    - Refrain from submitting these.\n    - Follow up in a subsequent PR, out of courtesy, you may want to let the original contributor know.\n    - Do not rush, take the time to make your comments clear and justify your suggestions in a small number of words (ideally a small paragraph or a short sentence should be enough)\n    - You are the face of the project.\n\nBad days occur to everyone, in that occasion you deserve a break: try to take your time and stay offline.\n\nConsider focusing on the most important reviews first (the things that will block the PR from being merged) to avoid overloading authors.\n\nBe mindful that every contributor has different experiences and skills; new contributors may have things to learn about Spyder, but the reviewer can often learn from working with them as well.\n\n### Expected reviewer behavior\n\nPull requests are a key space for community interaction, and reviewing PRs is a vital part of maintaining any project.\nWith that in mind, this is a process that can benefit from having a clear set of goals for the sake of both the reviewer and the PR author.\n\nAll reviewers are expected to follow these guidelines and labels in their review.\nIf a reviewer forgets, they may be reminded.\nIf a reviewer refuses, they will be contacted about a violation of [Spyder’s Code of Conduct](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) under `Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback`.\nAs with all aspects of the Code of Conduct, this applies to everyone involved in the discussion (including members of the Spyder organization on GitHub).\n\nOther notes:\n- Unless the reviewer has explicit permission on the conversation for that PR, reviewers should not commit to the same branch as the PR being reviewed.\n- If more than roughly 20% of review comments fall in the `[optional]` section described below, then it is worth adding this feedback in an issue referencing the PR instead of on the PR directly.\n- Whenever practical, reviewers should add comments asking for a specific change as [GitHub suggestions](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#adding-line-comments-to-a-pull-request).\n- If after discussion, an author and a reviewer still don't agree on a change and can't come up with a solution that addresses the concerns of both parties, another maintainer of the repository in question (or if not available, another Spyder core developer) should be pinged to give a second opinion and mediate the disagreement.\n\nReviewers may give context for the review to make sure the PR author is familiar with the style and this guide. \n\nFor example,\n\n> In Spyder projects, we review pull requests by labeling which feedback needs to be addressed versus which feedback is optional. For more information, refer to the [Review Guidelines](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/blob/master/REVIEW.md).\n- If after discussion, an author and a reviewer still don't agree on a change and can't come up with a solution that addresses the concerns of both parties, another maintainer of the repository in question (or if not available, another Spyder core developer) should be pinged to give a second opinion and mediate the disagreement.\n\n## Reviewing process\n\n### For code-focused review\n\n#### Requested items\n\nThe following are areas the community expects to be covered in the review of the code on each PR.\nNot all of the following individual questions will be relevant for every PR (for example, a bug fix may not need to answer the same questions as a proposal for a new feature), but these are the themes to be addressed.\n\nReview that addresses these questions on a PR will be prefixed with `[requested]` so that the PR author(s) are clear that they are blockers.\nReviews may be tagged per comment or through the primary comment of a GitHub review.\nPR authors are responsible for addressing requested reviews for the PR to be eligible for merging.\n\n- [ ] Motivation\n    - Do we want this?\n    - Would it benefit a meaningful number of users to have this accepted into Spyder?\n    - Does it help to solve bugs?\n    - Is it a necessary refactoring?\n\n- [ ] Tests\n    - Do the tests pass in the continuous integration build?\n      If appropriate, help the contributor understand why tests failed.\n    - Are regression tests needed?\n      If a reproducible bug is being fixed in this PR, one may be needed, and reviewers should help the contributor design and implement them.\n      In case the contributor is unable to add the test, the reviewer should do so in a follow-up PR.\n\n - [ ] Sustainability and maintenance\n    - Is the code easy to read and low on redundancy?\n    - Should variable names be improved for clarity or consistency?\n    - Should comments or docstrings be added or removed?\n    - Will the cost of maintaining a new feature be worth its benefits?\n    - Will the new code add any dependencies on other projects?\n\n- [ ] User-facing changes\n    - What use cases might this change influence?\n    - Is in-interface text (new or modified) appropriately descriptive and free of spelling or grammar issues that would make its meaning unclear?\n\nIn addition to requested changes, this category also includes questions that the reviewer has for the contributor that may relate to one of these areas, or otherwise need to be answered before the PR can be merged.\n\n#### Optional items\n\nThe following are themes that may be helpful to cover on a PR, but are optional.\n\n**Note**: The difference between an objective improvement and a subjective preference isn’t always clear.\nReviewers should recall that the review process is primarily about reducing risk to the project.\nWhen reviewing code, one should aim at preventing situations which may introduce a bug, deprecation or regression.\n\n- [ ] Improvements\n    - Could the code easily be rewritten to run much more efficiently for relevant settings?\n    - Is the code backwards compatible with previous versions?\n      (Or is a deprecation cycle necessary?)\n    - Is there feedback that would be helpful for solving future issues surrounding this change?\n      Are there non-urgent concerns that the team should be made aware of?\n    - If a bug is fixed, does the PR include a non-regression test?\n    - Are there images that should be added, resized or optimized?\n\n- [ ] User-facing changes\n    - Does the user interface or other visual elements match existing patterns in Spyder?\n      If it does not, is there a reason?\n\nReview that addresses these questions on a PR will be prefixed with `[optional]` so that the PR author(s) are clear that this feedback is not a blocker.\nReviews may be tagged per comment or through the primary comment of a GitHub review.\nAddressing this feedback is considered above-and-beyond, and may be more relevant on some PRs than others.\nPR authors may address these reviews, but are not required to do so in order for the PR to be eligible for merging.\n\n#### Comment items\n\nReviewers can leave comments marked with the `[comment]` tag (preferably), or not marked with any tag, to highlight positive aspects of the code, ask a tangential question, suggest that some details of the implementation could be improved in the future, indicate that a test would be nice to have, or any other hint that could help the contributor or other reviewers to better understand the context of the proposed work. Contributors are not required to address such comments as part of the review process.\n\n### For documentation/website-focused review\n\n#### Requested items\n\nThe following are areas the community expects to be covered in the review of a documentation-focused PR.\nIn general, reviewers need to consider whether the content is a good fit, accurate and generally clear to readers, and builds and renders with no simmediate user-visible issues.\n\nReview that addresses these questions on a PR will be prefixed with `[requested]` so that the PR author(s) are clear that they are blockers.\nReviews may be tagged per comment or through the primary comment of a GitHub review.\nPR authors are responsible for addressing requested reviews for the PR to be eligible for merging.\n\n**Motivation**\n\n- [ ] Does the change improve the documentation?\n- [ ] Would it benefit a meaningful number of users to have this as a part of the documentation?\n- [ ] Is it appropriate for the documentation and the section it is placed in?\n\n**Content**\n\n- [ ] Is the information accurate?\n- [ ] Is the change sufficiently complete, such that it won’t confuse users if it were to appear in the documentation as-is?\n- [ ] Is it clear what the text and images are trying to communicate?\n\n**Images/GIFs**\n\n- [ ] Are screenshots/GIFs reasonably legible and appropriate for the topic?\n- [ ] Are all images/GIFs scaled and optimized?\n      If needed, reviewers should offer to help with this.\n\n**Technical**\n\n- [ ] Do the tests pass in the continuous integration build?\n      If appropriate, help the contributor understand why tests failed.\n- [ ] Does any added/changed content render correctly, without user-visible issues?\n- [ ] Is the content free from typos and unambiguous grammar errors?\n\nIn addition to requested changes, this category also includes questions that the reviewer has for the contributor that may relate to one of these areas, or otherwise need to be answered before the PR can be merged.\n\n#### Optional items\n\nFeedback asking for substantial, user-visible content additions and improvements to the text and images (rather than critical fixes) may be left as optional review comments, if it is appropriate and important enough to merit discussion on the original PR.\nAs with all reviews, please primarily consider how a PR would impact documentation stability, clarity and quality over focusing on purely subjective improvements.\nComments under this section should be used in limited amounts to avoid overloading authors and keep the pull request focused and in scope.\nOtherwise, they can be handled in a followup by the reviewer, opened as an issue, or deferred entirely.\n\nExamples include:\n\n- [ ] Could GIFs or screenshots be added or improved?\n- [ ] Would this topic benefit from additional elaboration on specific items within the PR’s scope?\n- [ ] Could new content be restructured to read more clearly or logically for users?\n\nReview that addresses these topics on a PR will be prefixed with `[optional]` so that the PR author(s) are clear that this feedback is not a blocker.\nReviews may be tagged per comment or through the primary comment of a GitHub review.\nAddressing this feedback is considered above-and-beyond, and may be more relevant on some PRs than others.\nPR authors may address these reviews, but are not required to do so in order for the PR to be eligible for merging.\n\n#### Comment items\n\nReviewers can leave comments marked with the `[comment]` tag (preferably), or not marked with any tag, to highlight positive aspects of the contribution, ask a tangential question, suggest content that could be added in the future, or any other hint that could help the contributor or other reviewers to better understand the context of the proposed work. Contributors are not required to address such comments as part of the review process.\n\n#### Comment items\n\nReviewers can leave comments marked with the `[comment]` tag (preferably), or not marked with any tag, to highlight positive aspects of the contribution, ask a tangential question, suggest content that could be added in the future, or any other hint that could help the contributor or other reviewers to better understand the context of the proposed work. Contributors are not required to address such comments as part of the review process.\n\n#### Followup-only items\n\nOn all documentation PRs that modify more than a few lines, changes that are less critical/unambiguous, optimization-focused, or those that are not user-visible, should not be suggested on contributor PRs (even with an `[Optional]` tag) unless the author explicitly requests this level of review.\n\nInstead, these changes should be made in a followup pull request by a maintainer or other reviewer.\nThe specifics are covered in detail in the [Style Guide](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder-docs/blob/master/STYLEGUIDE.md), but generally include:\n\n- [ ] Copyediting (diction, phrasing, verbosity, repetition etc)\n- [ ] Formatting (spacing, line breaks, etc)\n- [ ] reST/Markdown style (roles, directives, markup, etc)\n- [ ] Style guide issues (consistency, precise label text, other nits)\n\n## Rebasing and merging process\n\nIf a contributor’s pull request has issues with their own commits (too many, trivial, etc), messages (incorrect format, not descriptive, stock, etc) or images (resized, optimized, modified, etc.), the committer should merge the PR using the squash option in GitHub’s interface with an appropriately descriptive message, and neither require that they rebase/amend their commits or do so for them directly on their branch (unless explicitly requested unsolicited by the contributor).\nBefore performing the squash merge, the reviewer should add a message with a short explanation to the contributor to avoid confusion.\n\nFor example,\n\n> Hi @user, thanks for your contribution! Your work is ready to be merged.\nGiven the [number of messages, large binary assets] present in this PR we will proceed to squash merge.\nThis just means that all the changes of this PR will be condensed in just one commit in our repository.\nHope to see your future contributions to the project!\n\nIf a contributor’s PR has an intractable Git issue involving more than just the contributor’s proposed new commits that would not be fixed by a squash, or might otherwise cause future serious difficulties for them/their repository (e.g. wrong base branch, unrelated commits, spurious merges, etc), reviewers/maintainers should kindly and compassionately explain the issue, provide step by step instructions (i.e. specific Git commands) to solve it, and offer assistance in doing so if the user desires it.\n\n## References\n\n- Much of this document—especially the review questions—is based on [scikit-learn’s code review guidelines](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/contributing.html?highlight=reviewers#code-review-guidelines)\n- The Communication Guidelines are a modified version of [NumPy’s communication guidelines](https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/reviewer_guidelines.html#communication-guidelines)\n- Clearly labeling feedback was inspired by [Netlify’s blog post about “feedback ladders”](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/03/05/feedback-ladders-how-we-encode-code-reviews-at-netlify/)\n- Additional details on how to approach reviews came from s[Nina Zakharenko’s Code Review Skills for People slides](https://www.nnja.io/post/2019/oscon-2019-code-review-skills-for-people/ )\n- Many thanks to the Spyder reviewers who helped write and edit this document!\n"
