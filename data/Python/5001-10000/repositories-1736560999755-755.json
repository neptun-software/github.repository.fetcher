They are text-to-text, decoder-only large language models, available in English, with open weights, pre-trained variants, and instruction-tuned variants. For more details, please check out the following links:\n\n * [Gemma on Google AI](https://ai.google.dev/gemma)\n * [Gemma on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/models/google/gemma)\n * [Gemma on Vertex AI Model Garden](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/publishers/google/model-garden/335)\n\nThis is the official PyTorch implementation of Gemma models. We provide model and inference implementations using both PyTorch and PyTorch/XLA, and support running inference on CPU, GPU and TPU. \n\n## Updates\n\n * [June 26th 🔥] Support Gemma v2. You can find the checkpoints [on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/models/google/gemma-2/pytorch) and Hugging Face\n\n * [April 9th] Support CodeGemma. You can find the checkpoints [on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/models/google/codegemma/pytorch) and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/collections/google/codegemma-release-66152ac7b683e2667abdee11)\n\n * [April 5] Support Gemma v1.1. You can find the v1.1 checkpoints [on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/models/google/gemma/frameworks/pyTorch) and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/collections/google/gemma-release-65d5efbccdbb8c4202ec078b).\n\n## Download Gemma model checkpoint\n\nYou can find the model checkpoints on Kaggle\n[here](https://www.kaggle.com/models/google/gemma/frameworks/pyTorch).\n\nAlternatively, you can find the model checkpoints on the Hugging Face Hub [here](https://huggingface.co/models?other=gemma_torch). To download the models, go the the model repository of the model of interest and click the `Files and versions` tab, and download the model and tokenizer files. For  programmatic downloading, if you have `huggingface_hub`\ninstalled, you can also run:\n\n```\nhuggingface-cli download google/gemma-7b-it-pytorch\n```\n\nNote that you can choose between the 2B, 2B V2, 7B, 7B int8 quantized, 9B, and 27B variants.\n\n```\nVARIANT=<2b or 7b or 9b or 27b>\nCKPT_PATH=<Insert ckpt path here>\n```\n\n## Try it free on Colab\n\nFollow the steps at\n[https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/pytorch_gemma](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/pytorch_gemma).\n\n## Try it out with PyTorch\n\nPrerequisite: make sure you have setup docker permission properly as a non-root user.\n\n```bash\nsudo usermod -aG docker $USER\nnewgrp docker\n```\n\n### Build the docker image.\n\n```bash\nDOCKER_URI=gemma:${USER}\n\ndocker build -f docker/Dockerfile ./ -t ${DOCKER_URI}\n```\n\n### Run Gemma inference on CPU.\n\n```bash\nPROMPT=\"The meaning of life is\"\n\ndocker run -t --rm \\\n    -v ${CKPT_PATH}:/tmp/ckpt \\\n    ${DOCKER_URI} \\\n    python scripts/run.py \\\n    --ckpt=/tmp/ckpt \\\n    --variant=\"${VARIANT}\" \\\n    --prompt=\"${PROMPT}\"\n    # add `--quant` for the int8 quantized model.\n```\n\n### Run Gemma inference on GPU.\n\n```bash\nPROMPT=\"The meaning of life is\"\n\ndocker run -t --rm \\\n    --gpus all \\\n    -v ${CKPT_PATH}:/tmp/ckpt \\\n    ${DOCKER_URI} \\\n    python scripts/run.py \\\n    --device=cuda \\\n    --ckpt=/tmp/ckpt \\\n    --variant=\"${VARIANT}\" \\\n    --prompt=\"${PROMPT}\"\n    # add `--quant` for the int8 quantized model.\n```\n\n## Try It out with PyTorch/XLA\n\n### Build the docker image (CPU, TPU).\n\n```bash\nDOCKER_URI=gemma_xla:${USER}\n\ndocker build -f docker/xla.Dockerfile ./ -t ${DOCKER_URI}\n```\n\n### Build the docker image (GPU).\n\n```bash\nDOCKER_URI=gemma_xla_gpu:${USER}\n\ndocker build -f docker/xla_gpu.Dockerfile ./ -t ${DOCKER_URI}\n```\n\n### Run Gemma inference on CPU.\n\n```bash\ndocker run -t --rm \\\n    --shm-size 4gb \\\n    -e PJRT_DEVICE=CPU \\\n    -v ${CKPT_PATH}:/tmp/ckpt \\\n    ${DOCKER_URI} \\\n    python scripts/run_xla.py \\\n    --ckpt=/tmp/ckpt \\\n    --variant=\"${VARIANT}\" \\\n    # add `--quant` for the int8 quantized model.\n```\n\n### Run Gemma inference on TPU.\n\nNote: be sure to use the docker container built from `xla.Dockerfile`.\n\n```bash\ndocker run -t --rm \\\n    --shm-size 4gb \\\n    -e PJRT_DEVICE=TPU \\\n    -v ${CKPT_PATH}:/tmp/ckpt \\\n    ${DOCKER_URI} \\\n    python scripts/run_xla.py \\\n    --ckpt=/tmp/ckpt \\\n    --variant=\"${VARIANT}\" \\\n    # add `--quant` for the int8 quantized model.\n```\n\n### Run Gemma inference on GPU.\n\nNote: be sure to use the docker container built from `xla_gpu.Dockerfile`.\n\n```bash\ndocker run -t --rm --privileged \\\n    --shm-size=16g --net=host --gpus all \\\n    -e USE_CUDA=1 \\\n    -e PJRT_DEVICE=CUDA \\\n    -v ${CKPT_PATH}:/tmp/ckpt \\\n    ${DOCKER_URI} \\\n    python scripts/run_xla.py \\\n    --ckpt=/tmp/ckpt \\\n    --variant=\"${VARIANT}\" \\\n    # add `--quant` for the int8 quantized model.\n```\n\n### Tokenizer Notes\n\n99 unused tokens are reserved in the pretrained tokenizer model to assist with more efficient training/fine-tuning.
