typically at least **2x** faster than sd-xl even for 1.6B variant and maintains performance regardless of resolution  \n  e.g., rendering at 4k is possible in less than 8GB vram  \n  to use, select from *networks -> models -> reference* and models will be auto-downloaded on first use  \n  *reference values*: sampler: default (or any flow-match variant), steps: 20, width/height: 1024, guidance scale: 4.5  \n  *note* like other LLM-based text-encoders, sana prefers long and descriptive prompts  \n  any short prompt below 300 characters will be auto-expanded using built in Gemma LLM before encoding while long prompts will be passed as-is  \n- **ControlNet**\n  - improved support for **Union** controlnets with granular control mode type\n  - added support for latest [Xinsir ProMax](https://huggingface.co/xinsir/controlnet-union-sdxl-1.0) all-in-one controlnet  \n  - added support for multiple **Tiling** controlnets, for example [Xinsir Tile](https://huggingface.co/xinsir/controlnet-tile-sdxl-1.0)  \n    *note*: when selecting tiles in control settings, you can also specify non-square ratios  \n    in which case it will use context-aware image resize to maintain overall composition  \n    *note*: available tiling options can be set in settings -> control  \n- **IP-Adapter**  \n  - FLUX.1 [XLabs](https://huggingface.co/XLabs-AI/flux-ip-adapter-v2) v1 and v2 IP-adapter  \n  - FLUX.1 secondary guidance, enabled using *Attention guidance* in advanced menu  \n  - SD 3.5 [InstantX](https://huggingface.co/InstantX/SD3.5-Large-IP-Adapter) IP-adapter  \n- [Flux Tools](https://blackforestlabs.ai/flux-1-tools/)  \n  **Redux** is actually a tool, **Fill** is inpaint/outpaint optimized version of *Flux-dev*  \n  **Canny** & **Depth** are optimized versions of *Flux-dev* for their respective tasks: they are *not* ControlNets that work on top of a model  \n  to use, go to image or control interface and select *Flux Tools* in scripts  \n  all models are auto-downloaded on first use  \n  *note*: All models are [gated](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki/Gated) and require acceptance of terms and conditions via web page  \n  *recommended*: Enable on-the-fly [quantization](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki/Quantization) or [compression](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki/NNCF-Compression) to reduce resource usage  \n  *todo*: support for Canny/Depth LoRAs  \n  - [Redux](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Redux-dev): ~0.1GB  \n    works together with existing model and basically uses input image to analyze it and use that instead of prompt  \n    *optional* can use prompt to combine guidance with input image  \n    *recommended*: low denoise strength levels result in more variety  \n  - [Fill](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Fill-dev): ~23.8GB, replaces currently loaded model  \n    *note*: can be used in inpaint/outpaint mode only  \n  - [Canny](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Canny-dev): ~23.8GB, replaces currently loaded model  \n    *recommended*: guidance scale 30  \n  - [Depth](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Depth-dev): ~23.8GB, replaces currently loaded model  \n    *recommended*: guidance scale 10  \n- [Flux ControlNet LoRA](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Canny-dev-lora)  \n  alternative to standard ControlNets, FLUX.1 also allows LoRA to help guide the generation process  \n  both **Depth** and **Canny** LoRAs are available in standard control menus  \n- [StabilityAI SD35 ControlNets](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3.5-controlnets)\n  - In addition to previously released `InstantX` and `Alimama`, we now have *official* ones from StabilityAI  \n- [Style Aligned Image Generation](https://style-aligned-gen.github.io/)  \n  enable in scripts, compatible with sd-xl  \n  enter multiple prompts in prompt field separated by new line  \n  style-aligned applies selected attention layers uniformly to all images to achive consistency  \n  can be used with or without input image in which case first prompt is used to establish baseline  \n  *note:* all prompts are processes as a single batch, so vram is limiting factor  \n- [FreeScale](https://github.com/ali-vilab/FreeScale)  \n  enable in scripts, compatible with sd-xl for text and img2img  \n  run iterative generation of images at different scales to achieve better results  \n  can render 4k sdxl images  \n  *note*: disable live preview to avoid memory issues when generating large images  \n\n### Video models\n\n- [Lightricks LTX-Video](https://huggingface.co/Lightricks/LTX-Video)  \n  model size: 27.75gb  \n  support for 0.9.0, 0.9.1 and custom safetensor-based models with full quantization and offloading support  \n  support for text-to-video and image-to-video, to use, select in *scripts -> ltx-video*  \n  *refrence values*: steps 50, width 704, height 512, frames 161, guidance scale 3.0  \n- [Hunyuan Video](https://huggingface.co/tencent/HunyuanVideo)  \n  model size: 40.92gb  \n  support for text-to-video, to use, select in *scripts -> hunyuan video*  \n  basic support only  \n  *refrence values*: steps 50, width 1280, height 720, frames 129, guidance scale 6.0  \n- [Genmo Mochi.1 Preview](https://huggingface.co/genmo/mochi-1-preview)  \n  support for text-to-video, to use, select in *scripts -> mochi.1 video*  \n  basic support only  \n  *refrence values*: steps 64, width 848, height 480, frames 19, guidance scale 4.5  \n\n*Notes*:\n- all video models are very large and resource intensive!  \n  any use on gpus below 16gb and systems below 48gb ram is experimental at best  \n- sdnext support for video models is relatively basic with further optimizations pending community interest  \n  any future optimizations would likely have to go into partial loading and excecution instead of offloading inactive parts of the model  \n- new video models use generic llms for prompting and due to that requires very long and descriptive prompt  \n- you may need to enable sequential offload for maximum gpu memory savings  \n- optionally enable pre-quantization using bnb for additional memory savings  \n- reduce number of frames and/or resolution to reduce memory usage  \n\n### UI and workflow improvements\n\n- **Docs**:\n  - New documentation site! <https://vladmandic.github.io/sdnext-docs/>\n  - Additional Wiki content: Styles, Wildcards, etc.\n- **LoRA** handler rewrite:  \n  - LoRA weights are no longer calculated on-the-fly during model execution, but are pre-calculated at the start  \n    this results in perceived overhead on generate startup, but results in overall faster execution as LoRA does not need to be processed on each step  \n    thanks @AI-Casanova  \n  - LoRA weights can be applied/unapplied as on each generate or they can store weights backups for later use  \n    this setting has large performance and resource implications, see [Offload](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki/Offload) wiki for details  \n  - LoRA name in prompt can now also be an absolute path to a LoRA file, even if LoRA is not indexed  \n    example: `<lora:/test/folder/my-lora.safetensors:1.0>`\n  - LoRA name in prompt can now also be path to a LoRA file op `huggingface`  \n    example: `<lora:/huggingface.co/vendor/repo/my-lora.safetensors:1.0>`\n- **Model loader** improvements:  \n  - detect model components on model load fail  \n  - allow passing absolute path to model loader  \n  - Flux, SD35: force unload model  \n  - Flux: apply `bnb` quant when loading *unet/transformer*  \n  - Flux: all-in-one safetensors  \n    example: <https://civitai.com/models/646328?modelVersionId=1040235>  \n  - Flux: do not recast quants  \n- **Memory** improvements:  \n  - faster and more compatible *balanced offload* mode  \n  - balanced offload: units are now in percentage instead of bytes  \n  - balanced offload: add both high and low watermark, defaults as below  \n    `0.25` for low-watermark: skip offload if memory usage is below 25%  \n    `0.70` high-watermark: must offload if memory usage is above 70%  \n  - balanced offload will attempt to run offload as non-blocking and force gc at the end  \n  - change-in-behavior:  \n    low-end systems, triggered by either `lowvrwam` or by detection of <=4GB will use *sequential offload*  \n    all other systems use *balanced offload* by default (can be changed in settings)  \n    previous behavior was to use *model offload* on systems with <=8GB and `medvram` and no offload by default  \n  - VAE upcase is now disabled by default on all systems  \n    if you have issues with image decode, you'll need to enable it manually  \n- **UI**:  \n  - improved stats on generate completion  \n  - improved live preview display and performance  \n  - improved accordion behavior  \n  - auto-size networks height for sidebar  \n  - control: hide preview column by default\n  - control: optionn to hide input column\n  - control: add stats\n  - settings: reorganized and simplified  \n  - browser -> server logging framework  \n  - add addtional themes: `black-reimagined`, thanks @Artheriax  \n- **Batch**\n  - image batch processing will use caption files if they exist instead of default prompt  \n\n### Updates\n\n- **Quantization**\n  - Add `TorchAO` *pre* (during load) and *post* (during execution) quantization  \n    **torchao** supports 4 different int-based and 3 float-based quantization schemes  \n  This is in addition to existing support for:  \n  - `BitsAndBytes` with 3 float-based quantization schemes  \n  - `Optimium.Quanto` with 3 int-based and 2 float-based quantizations schemes  \n  - `GGUF` with pre-quantized weights  \n  - Switch `GGUF` loader from custom to diffuser native\n- **IPEX**: update to IPEX 2.5.10+xpu  \n- **OpenVINO**:  \n  -

change-in-behavior\n  - when typing, it will auto-load model as soon as exactly one match is found\n  - allows entering model that are not on the list which triggers huggingface search  \n    e.g. `stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0`  \n    partial search hits are displayed in the log  \n    if exact model is found, it will be auto-downloaded and loaded  \n  - allows entering civitai direct download link which triggers model download  \n    e.g. `https://civitai.com/api/download/models/72396?type=Model&format=SafeTensor&size=full&fp=fp16`  \n  - auto-search-and-download can be disabled in settings -> models -> auto-download  \n    this also disables reference models as they are auto-downloaded on first use as well  \n- sd3 enhancements:  \n  - allow on-the-fly bnb quantization during load\n  - report when loading incomplete model  \n  - handle missing model components during load  \n  - handle component preloading  \n  - native lora handler  \n  -

new top-level button: reprocess latent from your history of generated image(s)  \n  - generate using full-quality:off and then reprocess using *full quality decode*  \n  - generate without hires/refine and then *reprocess with hires/refine*  \n    *note*: you can change hires/refine settings and run-reprocess again!  \n  - reprocess using *detailer*  \n\n- **history**\n  - by default, **reprocess** will pick last latent, but you can select any latent from history!  \n  - history is under *networks -> history*  \n    each history item includes info on operations that were used, timestamp and metadata  \n  - any latent operation during workflow automatically adds one or more items to history  \n    e.g. generate base + upscale + hires + detailer  \n  - history size: *settings -> execution -> latent history size*  \n    memory usage is ~130kb of ram for 1mp image  \n  - *note* list of latents in history is not auto-refreshed, use refresh button  \n\n- **model analyzer**  \n  - see all details of your currently loaded model, including components, parameter count, layer count, etc.  \n  - in models -> current -> analyze  \n\n- **text encoder**:  \n  - allow loading different custom text encoders: *clip-vit-l, clip-vit-g, t5*  \n    will automatically find appropriate encoder in the loaded model and replace it with loaded text encoder  \n    download text encoders into folder set in settings -> system paths -> text encoders  \n    default `models/Text-encoder` folder is used if no custom path is set  \n    finetuned *clip-vit-l* models: [Detailed, Smooth](https://huggingface.co/zer0int/CLIP-GmP-ViT-L-14), [LongCLIP](https://huggingface.co/zer0int/LongCLIP-GmP-ViT-L-14)  \n    reference *clip-vit-l* and *clip-vit-g* models: [OpenCLIP-Laion2b](https://huggingface.co/collections/laion/openclip-laion-2b-64fcade42d20ced4e9389b30)  \n    *note* sd/sdxl contain heavily distilled versions of reference models, so switching to reference model produces vastly different results  \n  - xyz grid support for text encoder  \n  - full prompt parser now correctly works with different prompts in batch  \n\n- **detailer**:  \n  - replaced *face-hires* with *detailer* which can run any number of standard detailing models  \n  - includes *face/hand/person/eyes* predefined detailer models plus support for manually downloaded models  \n    set path in *settings -> system paths -> yolo*  \n  - select one or more models in detailer menu and thats it!  \n  - to avoid duplication of ui elements, detailer will use following values from **refiner**:  \n    *sampler, steps, prompts*  \n  - when using multiple detailers and prompt is *multi-line*, each line is applied to corresponding detailer  \n  - adjustable settings:  \n    *strength, max detected objects, edge padding, edge blur, min detection confidence, max detection overlap, min and max size of detected object*  \n  - image metadata includes info on used detailer models  \n  - *note* detailer defaults are not save in ui settings, they are saved in server settings  \n    to apply your defaults, set ui values and apply via *system -> settings -> apply settings*  \n  - if using models trained on multiple classes, you can specify which classes you want to detail  \n    e.g. original yolo detection model is trained on coco dataset with 80 predefined classes  \n    if you leave field blank, it will use any class found in the model  \n    you can see classes defined in the model while model itself is loaded for the first time  \n\n- **extract lora**: extract combined lora from current memory state, thanks @AI-Casanova  \n  load any LoRA(s) and play with generate as usual and once you like the results simply extract combined LoRA for future use!  \n  in *models -> extract lora*  \n\n- **sampler options**: full rewrite  \n\n  *sampler notes*:  \n  - pick a sampler and then pick values, all values have \"default\" as a choice to make it simpler  \n  - a lot of options are new, some are old but moved around  \n    e.g. karras checkbox is replaced with a choice of different sigma methods  \n  - not every combination of settings is valid  \n  - some settings are specific to model types  \n    e.g. sd15/sdxl typically use epsilon prediction  \n  - quite a few well-known schedulers are just variations of settings, for example:  \n    - *sampler sgm* is sampler with trailing spacing and sample prediction type  \n    - *dpm 2m* or *3m* are *dpm 1s* with orders of 2 or 3  \n    - *dpm 2m sde* is *dpm 2m* with *sde* as solver  \n    - *sampler simple* is sampler with trailing spacing and linear beta schedule\n  - xyz grid support for sampler options  \n  - metadata updates for sampler options  \n  - modernui updates for sampler options  \n  - *note* sampler options defaults are not saved in ui settings, they are saved in server settings  \n    to apply your defaults, set ui values and apply via *system -> settings -> apply settings*  \n\n  *sampler options*:  \n  - sigma method: *karas, beta, exponential*  \n  - timesteps spacing: *linspace, leading, trailing*  \n  - beta schedule: *linear, scaled, cosine*  \n  - prediction type: *epsilon, sample, v-prediction*  \n  - timesteps presents: *none, ays-sd15, ays-sdxl*  \n  - timesteps override: <custom>  \n  - sampler order: *0=default, 1-5*  \n  - options: *dynamic, low order, rescale*  \n\n- [Ctrl+X](https://github.com/genforce/ctrl-x):\n  - control **structure** (*similar to controlnet*) and **appearance** (*similar to ipadapter*)  \n    without the need for extra models, all via code feed-forwards!\n  - can run in structure-only or appearance-only or both modes\n  - when providing structure and appearance input images, its best to provide a short prompts describing them  \n  - structure image can be *almost anything*: *actual photo, openpose-style stick man, 3d render, sketch, depth-map, etc.*  \n    just describe what it is in a structure prompt so it can be de-structured and correctly applied  \n  - supports sdxl in both txt2img and img2img, simply select from scripts\n\n- [APG: Adaptive Projected Guidance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02416)\n  - latest algo to provide better guidance for image generation, can be used instead of existing guidance rescale and/or PAG  \n  - in addtion to stronger guidance and reduction of burn at high guidance values, it can also increase image details  \n  - compatible with *sd15/sdxl/sc*  \n  - select in scripts -> apg  \n  - for low    cfg scale, use positive momentum: e.g. cfg=2 => momentum=0.6\n  - for normal cfg scale, use negative momentum: e.g. cfg=6 => momentum=-0.3\n  - for high   cfg scale, use neutral  momentum: e.g. cfg=10 => momentum=0.0\n\n- [LinFusion](https://github.com/Huage001/LinFusion)  \n  - apply liner distillation to during load to any sd15/sdxl model  \n  - can reduce vram use for high resolutions and increase performance\n  - *note*: use lower cfg scales as typical for distilled models  \n\n- [Flux](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev)  \n  - see [wiki](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki/FLUX#quantization) for details on `gguf`  \n  - support for `gguf` binary format for loading unet/transformer component  \n  - support for `gguf` binary format for loading t5/text-encoder component: requires transformers pr  \n  - additional controlnets: [JasperAI](https://huggingface.co/collections/jasperai/flux1-dev-controlnets-66f27f9459d760dcafa32e08) **Depth**, **Upscaler**, **Surface**, thanks @EnragedAntelope  \n  - additional controlnets: [XLabs-AI](https://huggingface.co/XLabs-AI/flux-controlnet-hed-diffusers) **Canny**, **Depth**, **HED**  \n  - mark specific unet as unavailable if load failed  \n  - fix diffusers local model name parsing  \n  - full prompt parser will auto-select `xhinker` for flux models  \n  - controlnet support for img2img and inpaint (in addition to previous txt2img controlnet)  \n  - allow separate vae load  \n  - support for both kohya and onetrainer loras in native load mode for fp16/nf4/fp4, thanks @AI-Casanova  \n  - support for differential diffusion  \n  - added native load mode for qint8/qint4 models\n  - avoid unet load if unchanged  \n\n- [OmniGen](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11340)  \n  - Radical new model with pure LLM architecture based on Phi-3  \n  - Select from *networks -> models -> reference*  \n  - Can be used for text-to-image and image-to-image  \n  - Image-to-image is *very* different, you need to specify in prompt what do you want to do  \n    and add `|image|` placeholder where input image is used!  \n    examples: `in |image| remove glasses from face`, `using depth map from |image|, create new image of a cute robot`  \n  - Params used: prompt, steps, guidance scale for prompt guidance, refine guidance scale for image guidance  \n    Recommended: guidance=3.0, refine-guidance=1.6  \n\n- [Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3.5-large)  \n  - New/improved variant of Stable Diffusion 3  \n  - Select from *networks -> models -> reference*  \n  - Available in standard and turbo variations  \n  - *Note*: Access to to both variations of SD3.5 model is gated, you must accept the conditions and use HF login  \n\n- [CogView 3 Plus](https://huggingface.co/THUDM/CogView3-Plus-3B)\n  - Select from *networks -> models -> reference*  \n  - resolution width and height can be from 512px to 2048px and must be divisible by 32  \n  - precision: bf16 or fp32  \n    fp16 is not supported due to internal model overflows  \n\n- [Meissonic](https://github.com/viiika/Meissonic)  \n  - Select from *networks -> models -> reference*  \n  - Experimental as upstream implemenation code is unstable\n  - Must set scheduler:default, generator:unset\n\n- [SageAttention](https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention)  \n  - new 8-bit attention implementation on top of SDP that can provide acceleration for some models, thanks @Disty0  \n  - enable in *settings -> compute settings -> sdp options -> sage attention*\n  - compatible with DiT-based models: e.g. *Flux.1, AuraFlow, CogVideoX*  \n  - not compatible with UNet-based models, e.g. *SD15, SDXL*  \n\n- **gpu**\n  - previously `cuda_dtype` in settings defaulted to `fp16` if available  \n  - now `cuda_type` defaults to **Auto** which executes `bf16` and `fp16` tests on startup and selects best available dtype  \n    if you have specific requirements, you can still set to fp32/fp16/bf16 as desired  \n    if you have gpu that incorrectly identifies bf16 or fp16 availablity, let us know so we can improve the auto-detection  \n  - support for torch **expandable segments**  \n    enable in *settings -> compute -> torch expandable segments*  \n    can provide significant memory savings for some models  \n    not enabled by default as its only supported on latest versions of torch and some gpus  \n\n- **xyz grid** full refactor  \n  - multi-mode: *selectable-script* and *alwayson-script*  \n  - allow usage combined with other scripts  \n  - allow **unet** selection  \n  - allow passing **model args** directly:  \n    allowed params will be checked against models call signature  \n    example: `width=768; height=512, width=512; height=768`  \n  - allow passing **processing args** directly:  \n    params are set directly on main processing object and can be known or new params  \n    example: `steps=10, steps=20; test=unknown`  \n  - enable working with different resolutions  \n    now you can adjust width/height in the grid just as any other param  \n  - renamed options to include section name and adjusted cost of each option  \n  - added additional metadata  \n\n- **interrogate**  \n  - add additional blip models: *blip-base, blip-large, blip-t5-xl, blip-t5-xxl, opt-2.7b, opt-6.7b*  \n  - change default params for better memory utilization  \n  - lock commits for miaoshouAI-promptgen  \n  - add optional advanced params  \n  - update logging  \n\n- **lora** auto-apply tags to prompt  \n  - controlled via *settings -> networks -> lora_apply_tags*  \n    *0:disable, -1:all-tags, n:top-n-tags*  \n  - uses tags from both model embedded data and civitai downloaded data  \n  - if lora contains no tags, lora name itself will be used as a tag  \n  - if prompt contains `_tags_` it will be used as placeholder for replacement, otherwise tags will be appended  \n  - used tags are also logged and registered in image metadata  \n  - loras are no longer filtered per detected type vs loaded model type as its unreliable  \n  - loras display in networks now shows possible version in top-left corner  \n  - correct using of `extra_networks_default_multiplier` if not scale is specified  \n  - improve lora base model detection  \n  - improve lora error handling and logging  \n  - setting `lora_load_gpu` to load LoRA directly to GPU  \n    *default*: true unless lovwram  \n\n- **quantization**  \n  - new top level settings group as we have quite a few quantization options now!  \n    configure in *settings -> quantization*  \n  - in addition to existing `optimum.quanto` and `nncf`, we now have `bitsandbytes` and `torchao`  \n  - **bitsandbytes**: fp8, fp4, nf4  \n    - quantization can be applied on-the-fly during model load  \n    -

see [changelog](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for details!  \nExamples:\n- Built-in prompt-enhancer, TAESD optimizations, new DC-Solver scheduler, global XYZ grid management, etc.  \n- Updates to ZLUDA, IPEX, OpenVINO...\n\n### Details for 2024-09-13\n\n**Major refactor of FLUX.1 support:**\n- allow configuration of individual FLUX.1 model components: *transformer, text-encoder, vae*  \n  model load will load selected components first and then initialize model using pre-loaded components  \n  components that were not pre-loaded will be downloaded and initialized as needed  \n  as usual, components can also be loaded after initial model load  \n  *note*: use of transformer/unet is recommended as those are flux.1 finetunes  \n  *note*: manually selecting vae and text-encoder is not recommended  \n  *note*: mix-and-match of different quantizations for different components can lead to unexpected errors  \n  - transformer/unet is list of manually downloaded safetensors  \n  - vae is list of manually downloaded safetensors  \n  - text-encoder is list of predefined and manually downloaded text-encoders  \n- **controlnet** support:\n  support for **InstantX/Shakker-Labs** models including [Union-Pro](https://huggingface.co/InstantX/FLUX.1-dev-Controlnet-Union)\n  note that flux controlnet models are large, up to 6.6GB on top of already large base model!  \n  as such, you may need to use offloading:sequential which is not as fast, but uses far less memory  \n  when using union model, you must also select control mode in the control unit  \n  flux does not yet support *img2img* so to use controlnet, you need to set contronet input via control unit override  \n- model support loading **all-in-one** safetensors  \n  not recommended due to massive duplication of components, but added due to popular demand  \n  each such model is 20-32GB in size vs ~11GB for typical unet fine-tune  \n- improve logging, warn when attempting to load unet as base model  \n- **refiner** support  \n  FLUX.1 can be used as refiner for other models such as sd/sdxl  \n  simply load sd/sdxl model as base and flux model as refiner and use as usual refiner workflow  \n- **img2img**, **inpaint** and **outpaint** support  \n  *note* flux may require higher denoising strength than typical sd/sdxl models  \n  *note*: img2img is not yet supported with controlnet  \n- transformer/unet support *fp8/fp4* quantization  \n  this brings supported quants to: *nf4/fp8/fp4/qint8/qint4*\n- vae support *fp16*  \n- **lora** support additional training tools  \n- **face-hires** support  \n- support **fuse-qkv** projections  \n  can speed up generate  \n  enable via *settings -> compute -> fused projections*  \n\n**Other improvements & Fixes:**\n- [CogVideoX](https://huggingface.co/THUDM/CogVideoX-5b)  \n  - support for both **2B** and **5B** variations  \n  - support for both **text2video** and **video2video** modes\n  - simply select in *scripts -> cogvideox*  \n  - as with any video modules, includes additional frame interpolation using RIFE  \n  - if init video is used, it will be automatically resized and interpolated to desired number of frames  \n- **AnimateDiff**:  \n  - **prompt travel**  \n     create video which travels between different prompts at different steps!  \n     example prompt:\n      > 0: dog  \n      > 5: cat  \n      > 10: bird  \n  - support for **v3** model (finally)  \n  - support for **LCM** model  \n  - support for **free-noise** rolling context window  \n    allow for creation of much longer videos, automatically enabled if frames > 16  \n- **Context-aware** image resize, thanks @AI-Casanova!  \n  based on [seam-carving](https://github.com/li-plus/seam-carving)  \n  allows for *img2img/inpaint* even at massively different aspect ratios without distortions!  \n  simply select as resize method when using *img2img* or *control* tabs  \n- **HDR** high-dynamic-range image create for SD and SDXL  \n  create hdr images from in multiple exposures by latent-space modifications during generation  \n  use via *scripts -> hdr*  \n  option *save hdr images* creates images in standard 8bit/channel (hdr-effect) *and* 16bit/channel (full-hdr) PNG format  \n  ui result is always 8bit/channel hdr-effect image plus grid of original images used to create hdr  \n  grid image can be disabled via settings -> user interface -> show grid  \n  actual full-hdr image is not displayed in ui, only optionally saved to disk  \n- new scheduler: [DC Solver](https://github.com/wl-zhao/DC-Solver)  \n- **color grading** apply professional color grading to your images  \n  using industry-standard *.cube* LUTs!\n  enable via *scripts -> color-grading*  \n- **hires** workflow now allows for full resize options  \n  not just limited width/height/scale  \n- **xyz grid** is now availabe as both local and global script!\n- **prompt enhance**: improve quality and/or verbosity of your prompts  \n  simply select in *scripts -> prompt enhance*\n  uses [gokaygokay/Flux-Prompt-Enhance](https://huggingface.co/gokaygokay/Flux-Prompt-Enhance) model  \n- **decode**\n  - auto-set upcast if first decode fails  \n  - restore dtype on upcast  \n- **taesd** configurable number of layers  \n  can be used to speed-up taesd decoding by reducing number of ops  \n  e.g. if generating 1024px image, reducing layers by 1 will result in preview being 512px  \n  set via *settings -> live preview -> taesd decode layers*  \n- **xhinker** prompt parser handle offloaded models  \n- **control** better handle offloading  \n- **upscale** will use resize-to if set to non-zero values over resize-by  \n  applies to any upscale options, including refine workflow  \n- **networks** add option to choose if mouse-over on network should attempt to fetch additional info  \n  option:`extra_networks_fetch` enable/disable in *settings -> networks*  \n- speed up some garbage collection ops  \n- sampler settings add **dynamic shift**  \n  used by flow-matching samplers to adjust between structure and details  \n- sampler settings force base shift  \n  improves quality of the flow-matching samplers  \n- **t5** support manually downloaded models  \n  applies to all models that use t5 transformer  \n- **modern-ui** add override field  \n- full **lint** updates  \n- use `diffusers` from main branch, no longer tied to release  \n- improve diffusers/transformers/huggingface_hub progress reporting  \n- use unique identifiers for all ui components  \n- **visual query** (a.ka vqa or vlm) added support for several models\n  -

more...  \nAnd from previous service-pack: new **ControlNet-Union** *all-in-one* model, support for **DoRA** networks, additional **VLM** models, new **AuraSR** upscaler  \n\n**Breaking Changes...**\n\nDue to internal changes, you'll need to reset your **attention** and **offload** settings!  \nBut...For a good reason, new *balanced offload* is magic when it comes to memory utilization while sacrificing minimal performance!\n\n### Details for 2024-08-31\n\n**New Models...**\n\nTo use and of the new models, simply select model from *Networks -> Reference* and it will be

changes are massive - about 350 commits for core and 300 for UI...\n\nStarting with the new UI - yup, this version ships with a *preview* of the new [ModernUI](https://github.com/BinaryQuantumSoul/sdnext-modernui)  \nFor details on how to enable and use it, see [Home](https://github.com/BinaryQuantumSoul/sdnext-modernui) and [WiKi](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki/Themes)  \n**ModernUI** is still in early development and not all features are available yet, please report [issues and feedback](https://github.com/BinaryQuantumSoul/sdnext-modernui/issues)  \nThanks to @BinaryQuantumSoul for his hard work on this project!  \n\n*What else?*\n\n#### New built-in features\n\n- [PWA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) SD.Next is now installable as a web-app\n- **Gallery**: extremely fast built-in gallery viewer  \n  List, preview, search through all your images and videos!  \n- **HiDiffusion** allows generating very-high resolution images out-of-the-box using standard models  \n- **Perturbed-Attention Guidance** (PAG) enhances sample quality in addition to standard CFG scale  \n- **LayerDiffuse** simply create transparent (foreground-only) images  \n- **IP adapter masking** allows to use multiple input images for each segment of the input image  \n- IP adapter **InstantStyle** implementation  \n- **Token Downsampling** (ToDo) provides significant speedups with minimal-to-none quality loss  \n- **Samplers optimizations** that allow normal samplers to complete work in 1/3 of the steps!  \n  Yup, even popular DPM++2M can now run in 10 steps with quality equaling 30 steps using **AYS** presets  \n- Native **wildcards** support  \n- Improved built-in **Face HiRes**  \n- Better **outpainting**  \n- And much more...  \n  For details of above features and full list, see [Changelog](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/blob/dev/CHANGELOG.md)\n\n#### New models\n\nWhile still waiting for *Stable Diffusion 3.0*, there have been some significant models released in the meantime:\n\n- [PixArt-Σ](https://pixart-alpha.github.io/PixArt-sigma-project/), high end diffusion transformer model (*DiT*) capable of directly generating images at 4K resolution  \n- [SDXS](https://github.com/IDKiro/sdxs), extremely fast 1-step generation consistency model  \n- [Hyper-SD](https://huggingface.co/ByteDance/Hyper-SD), 1-step, 2-step, 4-step and 8-step optimized models  \n\n*Note*  \n[SD.Next](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic) is no longer marked as a fork of [A1111](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/) and github project has been fully detached  \nGiven huge number of changes with *+3443/-3342* commits diff (at the time of fork detach) over the past year,  \na completely different backend/engine and a change of focus, it is time to give credit to original [author](https://github.com/auTOMATIC1111),  and move on!  \n\n### Full ChangeLog for 2024-05-28\n\n- **Features**:\n  - **ModernUI** preview of the new [ModernUI](https://github.com/BinaryQuantumSoul/sdnext-modernui)  \n  - [PWA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) SD.Next is now installable as a web-app and includes verified manifest  \n  - **Gallery\n  - **Gallery**: list, preview, search through all your images and videos!  \n    Implemented as infinite-scroll with client-side-caching and lazy-loading while being fully async and non-blocking  \n    Search or sort by path, name, size, width, height, mtime or any image metadata item, also with extended syntax like *width > 1000*  \n    *Settings*: optional additional user-defined folders, thumbnails in fixed or variable aspect-ratio  \n  - [HiDiffusion](https://github.com/megvii-research/HiDiffusion):  \n    Generate high-resolution images using your standard models without duplicates/distorsions AND improved performance  \n    For example, *SD15* can now go up to *2024x2048* and *SDXL* up to *4k* natively\n    Simply enable checkbox in advanced menu and set desired resolution  \n    Additional settings are available in *settings -> inference settings -> hidiffusion*  \n    And can also be set and used via *xyz grid*  \n    *Note*: HiDiffusion resolution sensitive, so if you get error, set resolution to be multiples of 128  \n  - [Perturbed-Attention Guidance](https://github.com/KU-CVLAB/Perturbed-Attention-Guidance)  \n    PAG enhances sample quality by utilizing self-attention in formation of latent in addition to standard CFG scale  \n    Simply set *advanced -> attention guidance* and *advanced -> adaptive scaling*  \n    Additional options are available in *settings -> inference settings -> pag*  \n    *Note*: PAG has replaced SAG as attention guidance method in SD.Next  \n  - [LayerDiffuse](https://github.com/rootonchair/diffuser_layerdiffuse)\n    Create transparent images with foreground-only being generated  \n    Simply select from scripts -> apply to current model  \n    All necessary files will be auto-downloaded on first use  \n  - **IP Adapter Masking**:  \n    Powerful method of using masking with ip-adapters  \n    When combined with multiple ip-adapters, it allows for different inputs guidance for each segment of the input image  \n    *Hint*: to create masks, you can use manually created masks or control->mask module with auto-segment to create masks and later upload them  \n  - **IP Adapter advanced layer configuration**:  \n    Allows for more control over how each layer of ip-adapter is applied, requires a valid dict to be passed as input  \n    See [InstantStyle](https://github.com/InstantStyle/InstantStyle) for details  \n  - **OneDiff**: new optimization/compile engine, thanks @aifartist  \n    As with all other compile engines, enable via *settings -> compute settings -> compile*  \n  - [ToDo](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.13573v2) Token Downsampling for Efficient Generation of High-Resolution Images  \n    Newer alternative method to [ToMe](https://github.com/dbolya/tomesd) that can provide speed-up with minimal quality loss  \n    Enable in *settings -> inference settings -> token merging*  \n    Also available in XYZ grid  \n  - **Outpaint**:  \n    New method of outpainting that uses a combination of auto-masking and edge generation to create seamless transitions between original and generated image  \n    Use on control tab:\n    - *input -> denoising strength: 0.5 or higher*\n    - *select image -> outpaint -> expand edges or zoom out to desired size*\n    - *size -> mode: outpaint, method: nearest*\n    - *mask -> inpaint masked only (if you want to keep original image)*\n  - **Wildcards**:\n    - native support of standard file-based wildcards in prompt  \n    - enabled by default, can be disabled in *settings -> extra networks* if you want to use 3rd party extension  \n    - wildcards folder is set in *settings -> system paths* and can be flat-file list or complex folder structure  \n    - matches strings `\"__*__\"` in positive and negative prompts  \n    - supports filename and path-based wildcards  \n    - supports nested wildcards (wildcard can refer to another wildcard, etc.)  \n    - supports wildcards files in one-choice per line or multiple choices per line separated by `|` format  \n    - *note*: this is in addition to previously released style-based wildcards  \n- **Models**:\n  - **Load UNET**: ability to override/load external UNET to a selected model  \n    Works similar to how VAE is selected and loaded: Set UNet folder and UNet model in settings  \n    Can be replaced on-the-fly, not just during initial model load  \n    Enables usage of fine-tunes such as [DPO-SD15](https://huggingface.co/mhdang/dpo-sd1.5-text2image-v1) or [DPO-SDXL](https://huggingface.co/mhdang/dpo-sdxl-text2image-v1)  \n    *Note*: if there is a `JSON` file with the same name as the model it will be used as Unet config, otherwise Unet config from currently loaded model will be used  \n  - [PixArt-Σ](https://pixart-alpha.github.io/PixArt-sigma-project/)\n    pixart-Σ is a high end diffusion Transformer model (DiT) with a T5 encoder/decoder capable of directly generating images at 4K resolution  \n    to use, simply select from *networks -> models -> reference -> PixArt-Σ*  \n    *note*: this is a very large model at ~22GB  \n    set parameters: *sampler: Default*  \n  - [SDXS](https://github.com/IDKiro/sdxs)\n    sdxs is an extremely fast 1-step generation consistency model that also uses TAESD as quick VAE out-of-the-box  \n    to use, simply select from *networks -> models -> reference -> SDXS*  \n    set parameters: *sampler: CMSI, steps: 1, cfg_scale: 0.0*\n  - [Hyper-SD](https://huggingface.co/ByteDance/Hyper-SD)  \n    sd15 and sdxl 1-step, 2-step, 4-step and 8-step optimized models using lora  \n    set parameters: *sampler: TCD or LCM, steps: 1/2/4/8, cfg_scale: 0.0*  \n- **UI**:\n  - Faster **UI** load times\n  - Theme types:  \n    **Standard** (built-in themes), **Modern** (experimental nextgen ui), **None** (used for Gradio and Huggingface 3rd party themes)  \n    Specifying a theme type updates list of available themes  \n    For example, *Gradio* themes will not appear as available if theme type is set to *Standard*  \n  - Redesign of base txt2img interface  \n  - Minor tweaks to styles: refresh/apply/save\n  - See details in [WiKi](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki/Themes)\n- **API**:\n  - Add API endpoint `/sdapi/v1/control` and CLI util `cli/simple-control.py`  \n    (in addition to previously added `/sdapi/v1/preprocessors` and `/sdapi/v1/masking`)  \n    example:\n    > simple-control.py --prompt 'woman in the city' --sampler UniPC --steps 20  \n    > --input \\~/generative/Samples/cutie-512.png --output /tmp/test.png --processed /tmp/proc.png  \n    > --control 'Canny:Canny FP16:0.7, OpenPose:OpenPose FP16:0.8' --type controlnet  \n    > --ipadapter 'Plus:~/generative/Samples/cutie-512.png:0.5'  \n  - Add API endpoint `/sdapi/v1/vqa` and CLI util `cli/simple-vqa.py`\n- **Changes**:\n  - Due to change in Diffusers model loading  \n    initial model load will now fetch config files required for the model  \n    from the Huggingface site instead of using predefined YAML files\n  - Removed built-in extensions: *ControlNet* and *Image-Browser*  \n    as both *image-browser* and *controlnet* have native built-in equivalents  \n    both can still be installed by user if desired  \n  - Different defaults depending on available GPU, thanks @Disty0\n    - 4GB and below: *lowvram*\n    - 8GB and below: *medvram*\n    - Cross-attention: Dynamic Attention SDP with *medvram* or *lowvram*, otherwise SDP  \n    - VAE Tiling enabled with *medvram* and *lowvram*\n    - Disable Extract EMA by default\n    - Disable forced VAE Slicing for *lowvram*\n  - Upscaler compile disabled by default with OpenVINO backend  \n  - Hypernetwork support disabled by default, can be enabled in settings  \n- **Improvements**:\n  - Faster server startup  \n  - Styles apply wildcards to params\n  - Face HiRes fully configurable and higher quality when using high-resolution models  \n  - Extra networks persistent sort order in settings  \n  - Add option to make batch generations use fully random seed vs sequential  \n  - Make metadata in full screen viewer optional\n  - Add VAE civitai scan metadata/preview\n  - More efficient in-browser callbacks\n  - Updated all system requirements  \n  - UI log monitor will auto-reconnect to server on server restart  \n  - UI styles includes indicator for active styles  \n  - UI reduce load on browser  \n  - Secondary sampler add option \"same as primary\"  \n  - Change attention mechanism on-the-fly without model reload, thanks @Disty0  \n  - Update stable-fast with support for torch 2.2.2 and 2.3.0, thanks @Aptronymist\n  - Add torch *cudaMallocAsync* in compute options  \n    Can improve memory utilization on compatible GPUs (RTX and newer)  \n  - Torch dynamic profiling  \n    You can enable/disable full torch profiling in settings top menu on-the-fly  \n  - Prompt caching - if you use the same prompt multiple times, no need to re-parse and encode it  \n    Useful for batches as prompt processing is ~0.1sec on each pass  \n  - Enhance `SD_PROMPT_DEBUG` to show actual tokens used\n  - Support controlnet manually downloads models in both standalone and diffusers format  \n    For standalone, simply copy safetensors file to `models/control/controlnet` folder  \n    For diffusers format, create folder with model name in `models/control/controlnet/`  \n    and copy `model.json` and `diffusion_pytorch_model.safetensors` to that folder  \n- **Samplers**\n  - Add *Euler SGM* variation (e.g. SGM Uniform), optimized for SDXL-Lightning models  \n    *note*: you can use other samplers as well with SDXL-Lightning models  \n  - Add *CMSI* sampler, optimized for consistency models  \n  - Add option *timestep spacing* to sampler settings and sampler section in main ui\n    Note: changing timestep spacing changes behavior of sampler and can help to make any sampler turbo/lightning compatibile\n  - Add option *timesteps* to manually set timesteps instead of relying on steps+spacing  \n    Additionally, presets from nVidias align-you-steps reasearch are provided  \n    Result is that perfectly aligned steps can drastically reduce number of steps needed!  \n    For example, **AYS** preset alows DPM++2M to run in ~10 steps with quality equallying ~30 steps!  \n- **IPEX**, thanks @Disty0\n  - Update to *IPEX 2.1.20* on Linux  \n    requires removing the venv folder to update properly  \n  - Removed 1024x1024 workaround  \n  - Disable ipexrun by default, set `IPEXRUN=True` if you want to use `ipexrun`  \n- **ROCm**, thanks @Disty0  \n  - Add support for ROCm 6.1 nighthly builds  \n  - Switch to stable branch of PyTorch  \n  - Compatibility

**IP Adapter** major refactor  \n    - support for **multiple input images** per each ip adapter  \n    - support for **multiple concurrent ip adapters**  \n      *note*: you cannot mix & match ip adapters that use different *CLiP* models, for example `Base` and `Base ViT-G`  \n    - add **adapter start/end** to settings, thanks @AI-Casanova  \n      having adapter start late can help with better control over composition and prompt adherence  \n      having adapter end early can help with overal quality and performance  \n    - unified interface in txt2img, img2img and control  \n    - enhanced xyz grid support  \n  - **FaceID** now also works with multiple input images!  \n  - [Differential diffusion](https://github.com/exx8/differential-diffusion)  \n    img2img generation where you control strength of each pixel or image area  \n    can be used with manually created masks or with auto-generated depth-maps\n    uses general denoising strength value  \n    simply enable from *img2img -> scripts -> differential diffusion*  \n    *note*: supports sd15 and sdxl models  \n  - [Regional prompting](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/examples/community/README.md#regional-prompting-pipeline) as a built-in solution  \n    usage is same as original implementation from @hako-mikan  \n    click on title to open docs and see examples of full syntax on how to use it  \n    simply enable from *scripts -> regional prompting*  \n    *note*: supports sd15 models only  \n  - [DeepCache](https://github.com/horseee/DeepCache) model acceleration  \n    it can produce massive speedups (2x-5x) with no overhead, but with some loss of quality  \n    *settings -> compute -> model compile -> deep-cache* and *settings -> compute -> model compile -> cache interval*  \n  - [ZLUDA](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) experimental support, thanks @lshqqytiger  \n    - ZLUDA is CUDA wrapper that can be used for GPUs without native support\n    - best use case is *AMD GPUs on Windows*, see [wiki](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki/ZLUDA) for details  \n  - **Outpaint** control outpaint now uses new alghorithm: noised-edge-extend  \n    new method allows for much larger outpaint areas in a single pass, even outpaint 512->1024 works well  \n    note that denoise strength should be increased for larger the outpaint areas, for example outpainting 512->1024 works well with denoise 0.75  \n    outpaint can run in *img2img* mode (default) and *inpaint* mode where original image is masked (if inpaint masked only is selected)  \n  - **Clip-skip** reworked completely, thanks @AI-Casanova & @Disty0  \n    now clip-skip range is 0-12 where previously lowest value was 1 (default is still 1)  \n    values can also be decimal to interpolate between different layers, for example `clip-skip: 1.5`, thanks @AI-Casanova  \n  - **CFG End** new param to control image generation guidance, thanks @AI-Casanova  \n    sometimes you want strong control over composition, but you want it to stop at some point  \n    for example, when used with ip-adapters or controlnet, high cfg scale can overpower the guided image  \n  - **Control**\n    - when performing inpainting, you can specify processing resolution using **size->mask**  \n    - units now have extra option to re-use current preview image as processor input  \n  - **Cross-attention** refactored cross-attention methods, thanks @Disty0  \n    - for backend:original, its unchanged: SDP, xFormers, Doggettxs, InvokeAI, Sub-quadratic, Split attention  \n    - for backend:diffuers, list is now: SDP, xFormers, Batch matrix-matrix, Split attention, Dynamic Attention BMM, Dynamic Attention SDP  \n      note: you may need to update your settings! Attention Slicing is renamed to Split attention  \n    - for ROCm, updated default cross-attention to Scaled Dot Product  \n  - **Dynamic Attention Slicing**, thanks @Disty0  \n    - dynamically slices attention queries in order to keep them under the slice rate  \n      slicing gets only triggered if the query size is larger than the slice rate to gain performance  \n      *Dynamic Attention Slicing BMM* uses *Batch matrix-matrix*  \n      *Dynamic Attention Slicing SDP* uses *Scaled Dot Product*  \n    - *settings -> compute settings -> attention -> dynamic attention slicing*  \n  - **ONNX**:  \n    - allow specify onnx default provider and cpu fallback  \n      *settings -> diffusers*  \n    - allow manual install of specific onnx flavor  \n      *settings -> onnx*  \n    - better handling of `fp16` models/vae, thanks @lshqqytiger  \n  - **OpenVINO** update to `torch 2.2.0`, thanks @Disty0  \n  - **HyperTile** additional options thanks @Disty0  \n    - add swap size option  \n    - add use only for hires pass option  \n  - add `--theme` cli param to force theme on startup  \n  - add `--allow-paths` cli param to add additional paths that are allowed to be accessed via web, thanks @OuticNZ  \n- **Wiki**:\n  - added benchmark notes for IPEX, OpenVINO and Olive  \n  - added ZLUDA wiki page  \n- **Internal**\n  - update dependencies  \n  - refactor txt2img/img2img api  \n  - enhanced theme loader  \n  - add additional debug env variables  \n  - enhanced sdp cross-optimization control  \n    see *settings -> compute settings*  \n  - experimental support for *python 3.12*  \n- **Fixes**:  \n  - add variation seed to diffusers txt2img, thanks @AI-Casanova  \n  - add cmd param `--skip-env` to skip setting of environment parameters during sdnext load  \n  - handle extensions that install conflicting versions of packages  \n    `onnxruntime`, `opencv2-python`  \n  - installer refresh package cache on any install  \n  - fix embeddings registration on server startup, thanks @AI-Casanova  \n  - ipex handle dependencies, thanks @Disty0  \n  - insightface handle dependencies  \n  - img2img mask blur and padding  \n  - xyz grid handle ip adapter name and scale  \n  - lazy loading of image may prevent metadata from being loaded on time  \n  - allow startup without valid models folder  \n  - fix interrogate api endpoint  \n  - control fix resize causing runtime errors  \n  - control fix processor override image after processor change  \n  - control fix display grid with batch  \n  - control restore pipeline before running scripts/extensions  \n  - handle pipelines that return dict instead of object  \n  - lora use strict name matching if preferred option is by-filename  \n  - fix inpaint mask only for diffusers  \n  - fix vae dtype mismatch, thanks @Disty0  \n  - fix controlnet inpaint mask  \n  - fix theme list refresh  \n  - fix extensions update information in ui  \n  - fix taesd with bfloat16\n  - fix model merge manual merge settings, thanks @AI-Casanova  \n  - fix gradio instant update issues for textboxes in quicksettings  \n  - fix rembg missing dependency  \n  - bind controlnet extension to last known working commit, thanks @Aptronymist  \n  - prompts-from-file fix resizable prompt area  \n\n## Update for 2024-02-07\n\nAnother big release just hit the shelves!\n\n### Highlights 2024-02-07  \n\n- A lot more functionality in the **Control** module:\n  - Inpaint and outpaint support, flexible resizing options, optional hires  \n  - Built-in support for many new processors and models, all auto-downloaded on first use  \n  - Full support for scripts and extensions  \n- Complete **Face** module  \n  implements all variations of **FaceID**, **FaceSwap** and latest **PhotoMaker** and **InstantID**  \n- Much enhanced **IPAdapter** modules  \n- Brand new **Intelligent masking**, manual or automatic  \n  Using ML models (*LAMA* object removal, *REMBG* background removal, *SAM* segmentation, etc.) and with live previews  \n  With granular blur, erode and dilate controls  \n- New models and pipelines:  \n  **Segmind SegMoE**, **Mixture Tiling**, **InstaFlow**, **SAG**, **BlipDiffusion**  \n- Massive work integrating latest advances with [OpenVINO](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki/OpenVINO), [IPEX](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki/Intel-ARC) and [ONNX Olive](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki/ONNX-Runtime-&-Olive)\n- Full control over brightness, sharpness and color shifts and color grading during generate process directly in latent space  \n- **Documentation**! This was a big one, with a lot of new content and updates in the [WiKi](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki)  \n\nPlus welcome additions to **UI performance, usability and accessibility** and flexibility of deployment as well as **API** improvements  \nAnd it also includes fixes for all reported issues so far  \n\nAs of this release, default backend is set to **diffusers** as its more feature rich than **original** and supports many additional models (original backend does remain as fully supported)  \n\nAlso, previous versions of **SD.Next** were tuned for balance between performance and resource usage.  \nWith this release, focus is more on performance.  \nSee [Benchmark](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki/Benchmark) notes for details, but as a highlight, we are now hitting **~110-150 it/s** on a standard nVidia RTX4090 in optimal scenarios!  \n\nFurther details:  \n- For basic instructions, see [README](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/blob/master/README.md)  \n- For more details on all new features see full [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)  \n- For documentation, see [WiKi](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki)\n\n### Full ChangeLog 2024-02-07  \n\n- Heavily updated [Wiki](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki)  \n- **Control**:  \n  - new docs:\n    - [Control overview](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki/Control)  \n    - [Control guide](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki/Control-Guide), thanks @Aptronymist  \n  -

new **mask** module  \n    - granular blur (gaussian), erode (reduce or remove noise) and dilate (pad or expand)  \n    - optional **live preview**  \n    - optional **auto-segmentation** using ml models  \n      auto-segmentation can be done using **segment-anything** models or **rembg** models  \n      *note*: auto segmentation will automatically expand user-masked area to segments that include current user mask  \n    - optional **auto-mask**  \n      if you dont provide mask or mask is empty, you can instead use auto-mask to automatically generate mask  \n      this is especially useful if you want to use advanced masking on batch or video inputs and dont want to manually mask each image  \n      *note*: such auto-created mask is also subject to all other selected settings such as auto-segmentation, blur, erode and dilate  \n    - optional **object removal** using LaMA model  \n      remove selected objects from images with a single click  \n      works best when combined with auto-segmentation to remove smaller objects  \n    - masking can be combined with control processors in which case mask is applied before processor  \n    - unmasked part of can is optionally applied to final image as overlay, see settings `mask_apply_overlay`  \n  - support for many additional controlnet models  \n    now built-in models include 30+ SD15 models and 15+ SDXL models  \n  - allow **resize** both *before* and *after* generate operation  \n    this allows for workflows such as: *image -> upscale or downscale -> generate -> upscale or downscale -> output*  \n    providing more flexibility and than standard hires workflow  \n    *note*: resizing before generate can be done using standard upscalers or latent\n  - implicit **hires**  \n    since hires is only used for txt2img, control reuses existing resize functionality\n    any image size is used as txt2img target size  \n    but if resize scale is also set its used to additionally upscale image after initial txt2img and for hires pass  \n  - add support for **scripts** and **extensions**  \n    you can now combine control workflow with your favorite script or extension  \n    *note* extensions that are hard-coded for txt2img or img2img tabs may not work until they are updated  \n  - add **depth-anything** depth map processor and trained controlnet  \n  - add **marigold** depth map processor  \n    this is state-of-the-art depth estimation model, but its quite heavy on resources  \n  -

allow any selection of units  \n  - dynamically install depenencies required by specific processors  \n  - fix input image size  \n  - fix video color mode  \n  - fix correct image mode  \n  - fix batch/folder/video modes  \n  - fix processor switching within same unit  \n  - fix pipeline switching between different modes  \n- **Face** module  \n  implements all variations of **FaceID**, **FaceSwap** and latest **PhotoMaker** and **InstantID**  \n  simply select from scripts and choose your favorite method and model  \n  *note*: all models are auto-downloaded on first use  \n  - [FaceID](https://huggingface.co/h94/IP-Adapter-FaceID)  \n    - faceid guides image generation given the input image  \n    - full implementation for *SD15* and *SD-XL*, to use simply select from *Scripts*  \n      **Base** (93MB) uses *InsightFace* to generate face embeds and *OpenCLIP-ViT-H-14* (2.5GB) as image encoder  \n      **Plus** (150MB) uses *InsightFace* to generate face embeds and *CLIP-ViT-H-14-laion2B* (3.8GB) as image encoder  \n      **SDXL** (1022MB) uses *InsightFace* to generate face embeds and *OpenCLIP-ViT-bigG-14* (3.7GB) as image encoder  \n  -

with focus on new models (3 new model types), new backends and optimizations\nPlus quite a few fixes  \n\nAlso, [Wiki](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki) has been updated with new content, so check it out!  \nSome highlights: [OpenVINO](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki/OpenVINO), [IntelArc](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki/Intel-ARC), [DirectML](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki/DirectML), [ONNX/Olive](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki/ONNX-Olive)\n\n- **Diffusers**\n  - since now **SD.Next** supports **12** different model types, weve added reference model for each type in  \n    *Extra networks -> Reference* for easier select & auto-download  \n    Models can still be downloaded manually, this is just a convenience feature & a showcase for supported models  \n  - new model type: [Segmind SSD-1B](https://huggingface.co/segmind/SSD-1B)  \n    its a *distilled* model trained at 1024px, this time 50% smaller and faster version of SD-XL!  \n    (and quality does not suffer, its just more optimized)  \n    test shows batch-size:4 with 1k images at full quality used less than 6.5GB of VRAM  \n    and for further optimization, you can use built-in **TAESD** decoder,  \n    which results in batch-size:16 with 1k images using 7.9GB of VRAM\n    select from extra networks -> reference or download using built-in **Huggingface** downloader: `segmind/SSD-1B`  \n  - new model type: [Pixart-α XL 2](https://github.com/PixArt-alpha/PixArt-alpha)  \n    in medium/512px and large/1024px variations  \n    comparable in quality to SD 1.5 and SD-XL, but with better text encoder and highly optimized training pipeline  \n    so finetunes can be done in as little as 10% compared to SD/SD-XL (note that due to much larger text encoder, it is a large model)  \n    select from extra networks -> reference or download using built-in **Huggingface** downloader: `PixArt-alpha/PixArt-XL-2-1024-MS`  \n  - new model type: [LCM: Latent Consistency Models](https://github.com/openai/consistency_models)  \n    trained at 512px, but with near-instant generate in a as little as 3 steps!  \n    combined with OpenVINO, generate on CPU takes less than 5-10 seconds: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b90ESUTLsRo>  \n    and absolute beast when combined with **HyperTile** and **TAESD** decoder resulting in **28 FPS**  \n    (on RTX4090 for batch 16x16 at 512px)  \n    note: set sampler to **Default** before loading model as LCM comes with its own *LCMScheduler* sampler  \n    select from extra networks -> reference or download using built-in **Huggingface** downloader: `SimianLuo/LCM_Dreamshaper_v7`  \n  - support for **Custom pipelines**, thanks @disty0  \n    download using built-in **Huggingface** downloader  \n    think of them as plugins for diffusers not unlike original extensions that modify behavior of `ldm` backend  \n    list of community pipelines: <https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/examples/community/README.md>  \n  - new custom pipeline: `Disty0/zero123plus-pipeline`, thanks @disty0  \n    generate 4 output images with different camera positions: front, side, top, back!  \n    for more details, see <https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/discussions/2421>  \n  - new backend: **ONNX/Olive** *(experimental)*, thanks @lshqqytiger  \n    for details, see [WiKi](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki/ONNX-Runtime)\n  - extend support for [Free-U](https://github.com/ChenyangSi/FreeU)  \n    improve generations quality at no cost (other than finding params that work for you)  \n- **General**  \n  - attempt to auto-fix invalid samples which occur due to math errors in lower precision  \n    example: `RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in cast: sample = sample.astype(np.uint8)`  \n    begone **black images** *(note: if it proves as working, this solution will need to be expanded to cover all scenarios)*  \n  - add **Lora OFT** support, thanks @antis0007 and @ai-casanova  \n  - **Upscalers**  \n    - **compile** option, thanks @disty0  \n    - **chaiNNer** add high quality models from [Helaman](https://openmodeldb.info/users/helaman)  \n  - redesigned **Progress bar** with full details on current operation  \n  - new option: *settings -> images -> keep incomplete*  \n    can be used to skip vae decode on aborted/skipped/interrupted image generations  \n  - new option: *settings -> system paths -> models*  \n    can be used to set custom base path for *all* models (previously only as cli option)  \n  - remove external clone of items in `/repositories`  \n  - **Interrogator** module has been removed from `extensions-builtin`  \n    and fully implemented (and improved) natively  \n- **UI**  \n  - UI tweaks for default themes  \n  - UI switch core font in default theme to **noto-sans**  \n    previously default font was simply *system-ui*, but it lead to too much variations between browsers and platforms  \n  - UI tweaks for mobile devices, thanks @iDeNoh  \n  - updated **Context menu**  \n    right-click on any button in action menu (e.g. generate button)  \n- **Extra networks**  \n  - sort by name, size, date, etc.  \n  - switch between *gallery* and *list* views  \n  - add tags from user metadata (in addition to tags in model metadata) for **lora**  \n  - added **Reference** models for diffusers backend  \n  - faster enumeration of all networks on server startup  \n- **Packages**\n  - updated `diffusers` to 0.22.0, `transformers` to 4.34.1  \n  - update **openvino**, thanks @disty0  \n  - update **directml**, @lshqqytiger  \n- **Compute**  \n  - **OpenVINO**:  \n    - updated to mainstream `torch` *2.1.0*  \n    - support for **ESRGAN**

\n\nChangelog is massive, but do read through or youll be missing on some very cool new functionality  \nor even free speedups and quality improvements (regardless of which workflows youre using)!  \n\nNote that for this release its recommended to perform a clean install (e.g. fresh `git clone`)  \nUpgrades are still possible and supported, but clean install is recommended for best experience  \n\n- **UI**  \n  - added **change log** to UI  \n    see *System -> Changelog*  \n  - converted submenus from checkboxes to accordion elements  \n    any ui state including state of open/closed menus can be saved as default!  \n    see *System -> User interface -> Set menu states*  \n  - new built-in theme **invoked**  \n    thanks @BinaryQuantumSoul  \n  - add **compact view** option in settings -> user interface  \n  - small visual indicator bottom right of page showing internal server job state  \n- **Extra networks**:  \n  - **Details**  \n    - new details interface to view and save data about extra networks  \n      main ui now has a single button on each en to trigger details view  \n    - details view includes model/lora metadata parser!  \n    - details view includes civitai model metadata!  \n  - **Metadata**:  \n    - you can scan [civitai](https://civitai.com/)  \n      for missing metadata and previews directly from extra networks  \n      simply click on button in top-right corner of extra networks page  \n  - **Styles**  \n    - save/apply icons moved to extra networks  \n    - can be edited in details view  \n    - support for single or multiple styles per json  \n    - support for embedded previews  \n    - large database of art styles included by default  \n      can be disabled in *settings -> extra networks -> show built-in*  \n    - styles can also be used in a prompt directly: `<style:style_name>`  \n      if style if an exact match, it will be used  \n      otherwise it will rotate between styles that match the start of the name  \n      that way you can use different styles as wildcards when processing batches  \n    - styles can have **extra** fields, not just prompt and negative prompt  \n      for example: *\"Extra: sampler: Euler a, width: 480, height: 640, steps: 30, cfg scale: 10, clip skip: 2\"*\n  - **VAE**  \n    - VAEs are now also listed as part of extra networks  \n    - Image preview methods have been redesigned: simple, approximate, taesd, full  \n      please set desired preview method in settings  \n    - both original and diffusers backend now support \"full quality\" setting  \n      if you desired model or platform does not support FP16 and/or you have a low-end hardware and cannot use FP32  \n      you can disable \"full quality\" in advanced params and it will likely reduce decode errors (infamous black images)  \n  - **LoRA**  \n    - LoRAs are now automatically filtered based on compatibility with currently loaded model  \n      note that if lora type cannot be auto-determined, it will be left in the list  \n  - **Refiner**  \n    - you can load model from extra networks as base model or as refiner  \n      simply select button in top-right of models page  \n  - **General**  \n    - faster search, ability to show/hide/sort networks  \n    - refactored subfolder handling  \n      *note*: this will trigger model hash recalculation on first model use  \n- **Diffusers**:  \n  - better pipeline **auto-detect** when loading from safetensors  \n  - **SDXL Inpaint**  \n    - although any model can be used for inpainiting, there is a case to be made for  \n      dedicated inpainting models as they are tuned to inpaint and not generate  \n    - model can be used as base model for **img2img** or refiner model for **txt2img**  \n      To download go to *Models -> Huggingface*:  \n      - `diffusers/stable-diffusion-xl-1.0-inpainting-0.1` *(6.7GB)*  \n  - **SDXL Instruct-Pix2Pix**  \n    - model can be used as base model for **img2img** or refiner model for **txt2img**  \n      this model is massive and requires a lot of resources!  \n      to download go to *Models -> Huggingface*:  \n      - `diffusers/sdxl-instructpix2pix-768` *(11.9GB)*  \n  - **SD Latent Upscale**  \n    - you can use *SD Latent Upscale* models as **refiner models**  \n      this is a bit experimental, but it works quite well!  \n      to download go to *Models -> Huggingface*:  \n      - `stabilityai/sd-x2-latent-upscaler` *(2.2GB)*  \n      - `stabilityai/stable-diffusion-x4-upscaler` *(1.7GB)*  \n  - better **Prompt attention**  \n    should better handle more complex prompts  \n    for sdxl, choose which part of prompt goes to second text encoder - just add `TE2:` separator in the prompt  \n    for hires and refiner, second pass prompt is used if present, otherwise primary prompt is used  \n    new option in *settings -> diffusers -> sdxl pooled embeds*  \n    thanks @AI-Casanova  \n  - better **Hires** support for SD and SDXL  \n  - better **TI embeddings** support for SD and SDXL  \n    faster loading, wider compatibility and support for embeddings with multiple vectors  \n    information about used embedding is now also added to image metadata  \n    thanks @AI-Casanova  \n  - better **Lora** handling  \n    thanks @AI-Casanova  \n  - better **SDXL preview** quality (approx method)  \n    thanks @BlueAmulet\n  - new setting: *settings -> diffusers -> force inpaint*  \n    as some models behave better when in *inpaint* mode even for normal *img2img* tasks  \n- **Upscalers**:\n  - pretty much a rewrite and tons of new upscalers - built-in list is now at **42**  \n  - fix long outstanding memory leak in legacy code, amazing this went undetected for so long  \n  - more high quality upscalers available by default  \n    **SwinIR** (2), **ESRGAN** (12), **RealESRGAN** (6), **SCUNet** (2)  \n  - if that is not enough, there is new **chaiNNer** integration:  \n    adds 15 more upscalers from different families out-of-the-box:  \n    **HAT** (6), **RealHAT** (2), **DAT** (1), **RRDBNet** (1), **SPSRNet** (1), **SRFormer** (2), **SwiftSR** (2)  \n    and yes, you can download and add your own, just place them in `models/chaiNNer`  \n  - two additional latent upscalers based on SD upscale models when using Diffusers backend  \n    **SD Upscale 2x**, **SD Upscale 4x***  \n    note: Recommended usage for *SD Upscale* is by using second pass instead of upscaler  \n    as it allows for tuning of prompt, seed, sampler settings which are used to guide upscaler  \n  - upscalers are available in **xyz grid**  \n  - simplified *settings->postprocessing->upscalers*  \n    e.g. all upsamplers share same settings for tiling  \n  - allow upscale-only as part of **txt2img** and **img2img** workflows  \n    simply set *denoising strength* to 0 so hires does not get triggered  \n  - unified init/download/execute/progress code  \n  - easier installation  \n- **Samplers**:  \n  - moved ui options to submenu  \n  - default list for new installs is now all samplers, list can be modified in settings  \n  - simplified samplers configuration in settings  \n    plus added few new ones like sigma min/max which can highly impact sampler behavior  \n  - note that list of samplers is now *different* since keeping a flat-list of all possible  \n    combinations results in 50+ samplers which is not practical  \n    items such as algorithm (e.g. karras) is actually a sampler option, not a sampler itself  \n- **CivitAI**:\n  - civitai model download is now multithreaded and resumable  \n    meaning that you can download multiple models in parallel  \n    as well as resume aborted/incomplete downloads  \n  - civitai integration in *models -> civitai* can now find most  \n    previews AND metadata for most models (checkpoints, loras, embeddings)  \n    metadata is now parsed and saved in *[model].json*  \n    typical hit rate is >95% for models, loras and embeddings  \n  - description from parsed model metadata is used as model description if there is no manual  \n    description file present in format of *[model].txt*  \n  - to enable search for models, make sure all models have set hash values  \n    *Models -> Valida -> Calculate hashes*  \n- **LoRA**\n  - new unified LoRA handler for all LoRA types (lora, lyco, loha, lokr, locon, ia3, etc.)  \n    applies to both original and diffusers backend  \n    thanks @AI-Casanova for diffusers port  \n  - for *backend:original*, separate lyco handler has been removed  \n- **Compute**  \n  - **CUDA**:  \n    - default updated to `torch` *2.1.0* with cuda *12.1*  \n    - testing moved to `torch` *2.2.0-dev/cu122*  \n    - check out *generate context menu -> show nvml* for live gpu stats (memory, power, temp, clock, etc.)\n  - **Intel Arc/IPEX**:  \n    - tons of optimizations, built-in binary wheels for Windows  \n      i have to say, intel arc/ipex is getting to be quite a player, especially with openvino  \n      thanks @Disty0 @Nuullll  \n  - **AMD ROCm**:  \n    - updated installer to support detect `ROCm` *5.4/5.5/5.6/5.7*  \n    - support for `torch-rocm-5.7`\n  - **xFormers**:\n    - default updated to *0.0.23*  \n    - note that latest xformers are still not compatible with cuda 12.1  \n      recommended to use torch 2.1.0 with cuda 11.8  \n      if you attempt to use xformers with cuda 12.1, it will force a full xformers rebuild on install  \n      which can take a very long time and may/may-not work  \n    - added cmd param `--use-xformers` to force usage of exformers  \n  - **GC**:  \n    - custom garbage collect threshold to reduce vram memory usage, thanks @Disty0  \n      see *settings -> compute -> gc*  \n- **Inference**  \n  - new section in **settings**  \n    - [HyperTile](https://github.com/tfernd/HyperTile): new!  \n      available for *diffusers* and *original* backends  \n      massive (up to 2x) speed-up your generations for free :)  \n      *note: hypertile is not compatible with any extension that modifies processing parameters such as resolution*  \n      thanks @tfernd\n    - [Free-U](https://github.com/ChenyangSi/FreeU): new!  \n      available for *diffusers* and *original* backends  \n      improve generations quality at no cost (other than finding params that work for you)  \n      *note: temporarily disabled for diffusers pending release of diffusers==0.22*  \n      thanks @ljleb  \n    - [Token Merging](https://github.com/dbolya/tomesd): not new, but updated  \n      available for *diffusers* and *original* backends  \n      speed-up your generations by merging redundant tokens  \n      speed up will depend on how aggressive you want to be with token merging  \n    - **Batch mode**  \n      new option *settings -> inference -> batch mode*  \n      when using img2img process batch, optionally process multiple images in batch in parallel  \n      thanks @Symbiomatrix\n- **NSFW Detection/Censor**  \n  - install extension: [NudeNet](https://github.com/vladmandic/sd-extension-nudenet)  \n    body part detection, image metadata, advanced censoring, etc...  \n    works for *text*, *image* and *process* workflows  \n    more in the extension notes  \n- **Extensions**\n  - automatic discovery of new extensions on github  \n    no more waiting for them to appear in index!\n  - new framework for extension validation  \n    extensions ui now shows actual status of extensions for reviewed extensions  \n    if you want to contribute/flag/update extension status, reach out on github or discord  \n  - better overall compatibility with A1111 extensions (up to a point)  \n  - [MultiDiffusion](https://github.com/pkuliyi2015/multidiffusion-upscaler-for-automatic1111)  \n    has been removed from list of built-in extensions  \n    you can still install it manually if desired  \n  - [LyCORIS]<https://github.com/KohakuBlueleaf/a1111-sd-webui-lycoris>  \n    has been removed from list of built-in extensions  \n    it is considered obsolete given that all functionality is now built-in  \n- **General**  \n  - **Startup**  \n    - all main CLI parameters can now be set as environment variable as well  \n      for example `--data-dir <path>` can be specified as `SD_DATADIR=<path>` before starting SD.Next  \n  - **XYZ Grid**\n    - more flexibility to use selection or strings  \n  - **Logging**  \n    - get browser session info in server log  \n    - allow custom log file destination  \n      see `webui --log`  \n    - when running with `--debug` flag, log is force-rotated  \n      so each `sdnext.log.*` represents exactly one server run  \n    - internal server job state tracking  \n  - **Launcher**  \n    - new `webui.ps1` powershell launcher for windows (old `webui.bat` is still valid)  \n      thanks @em411  \n  - **API**\n    - add end-to-end example how to use API: `cli/simple-txt2img.js`  \n      covers txt2img, upscale, hires, refiner  \n  - **train.py**\n    - wrapper script around built-in **kohyas lora** training script  \n      see `cli/train.py --help`  \n      new support for sd and sdxl, thanks @evshiron  \n      new support for full offline mode (without sdnext server running)  \n- **Themes**\n  - all built-in themes are fully supported:  \n    - *black-teal (default), light-teal, black-orange, invoked, amethyst-nightfall, midnight-barbie*  \n  - if youre using any **gradio default** themes or a **3rd party** theme or  that are not optimized for SD.Next, you may experience issues  \n    default minimal style has been updated for compatibility, but actual styling is completely outside of SD.Next control  \n\n## Update for 2023-09-13\n\nStarted as a mostly a service release with quite a few fixes, but then...  \nMajor changes how **hires** works as well as support for a very interesting new model [Wuerstchen](https://huggingface.co/blog/wuertschen)  \n\n- tons of fixes  \n- changes to **hires**  \n  - enable non-latent upscale modes (standard upscalers)  \n  - when using latent upscale, hires pass is run automatically  \n  - when using non-latent upscalers, hires pass is skipped by default  \n    enabled using **force hires** option in ui  \n    hires was not designed to work with standard upscalers, but i understand this is a common workflow  \n  - when using refiner, upscale/hires runs before refiner pass  \n  - second pass can now also utilize full/quick vae quality  \n  - note that when combining non-latent upscale, hires and refiner output quality is maximum,  \n    but operations are really resource intensive as it includes: *base->decode->upscale->encode->hires->refine*\n  - all combinations of: decode full/quick + upscale none/latent/non-latent + hires on/off + refiner on/off  \n    should be supported, but given the number of combinations, issues are possible  \n  - all operations are captured in image metadata\n- diffusers:\n  - allow loading of sd/sdxl models from safetensors without online connectivity\n  - support for new model: [wuerstchen](https://huggingface.co/warp-ai/wuerstchen)  \n    its a high-resolution model (1024px+) thats ~40% faster than sd-xl with a bit lower resource requirements  \n    go to *models -> huggingface -> search \"warp-ai/wuerstchen\" -> download*  \n    its nearly 12gb in size, so be patient :)\n- minor re-layout of the main ui  \n- updated **ui hints**  \n- updated **models -> civitai**  \n  - search and download loras  \n  - find previews for already downloaded models or loras  \n- new option **inference mode**  \n  - default is standard `torch.no_grad`  \n    new option is `torch.inference_only` which is slightly faster and uses less vram, but only works on some gpus  \n- new cmdline param `--no-metadata`  \n  skips reading metadata from models that are not already cached  \n- updated **gradio**  \n- **styles** support for subfolders  \n- **css** optimizations\n- clean-up **logging**  \n  - capture system info in startup log  \n  - better diagnostic output  \n  - capture extension output  \n  - capture ldm output  \n  - cleaner server restart  \n  - custom exception handling\n\n## Update for 2023-09-06\n\nOne week later, another large update!\n\n- system:  \n  - full **python 3.11** support  \n    note that changing python version does require reinstall  \n    and if youre already on python 3.10, really no need to upgrade  \n- themes:  \n  - new default theme: **black-teal**  \n  - new light theme: **light-teal**  \n  - new additional theme: **midnight-barbie**, thanks @nyxia  \n- extra networks:  \n  - support for **tags**  \n    show tags on hover, search by tag, list tags, add to prompt, etc.  \n  - **styles** are now also listed as part of extra networks  \n    existing `styles.csv` is converted upon startup to individual styles inside `models/style`  \n    this is stage one of new styles functionality  \n    old styles interface is still available, but will be removed in future  \n  - cache file lists for much faster startup  \n    speedups are 50+% for large number of extra networks  \n  - ui refresh button now refreshes selected page, not all pages  \n  - simplified handling of **descriptions**  \n    now shows on-mouse-over without the need for user interaction  \n  - **metadata** and **info** buttons only show if there is actual content  \n- diffusers:  \n  - add full support for **textual inversions** (embeddings)  \n    this applies to both sd15 and sdxl  \n    thanks @ai-casanova for porting compel/sdxl code  \n  - mix&match **base** and **refiner** models (*experimental*):  \n    most of those are \"because why not\" and can result in corrupt images, but some are actually useful  \n    also note that if youre not using actual refiner model, you need to bump refiner steps  \n    as normal models are not designed to work with low step count  \n    and if youre having issues, try setting prompt parser to \"fixed attention\" as majority of problems  \n    are due to token mismatches when using prompt attention  \n    - any sd15 + any sd15  \n    - any sd15 + sdxl-refiner  \n    - any sdxl-base + sdxl-refiner  \n    - any sdxl-base + any sd15  \n    - any sdxl-base + any sdxl-base  \n  - ability to **interrupt** (stop/skip) model generate  \n  - added **aesthetics score** setting (for sdxl)  \n    used to automatically guide unet towards higher pleasing images  \n    highly recommended for simple prompts  \n  - added **force zeros** setting  \n    create zero-tensor for prompt if prompt is empty (positive or negative)  \n- general:  \n  - `rembg` remove backgrounds support for **is-net** model  \n  - **settings** now show markers for all items set to non-default values  \n  - **metadata** refactored how/what/when metadata is added to images  \n    should result in much cleaner and more complete metadata  \n  - pre-create all system folders on startup  \n  - handle model load errors gracefully  \n  - improved vram reporting in ui  \n  - improved script profiling (when running in debug mode)  \n\n## Update for 2023-08-30\n\nTime for a quite a large update that has been leaking bit-by-bit over the past week or so...  \n*Note*: due to large changes, it is recommended to reset (delete) your `ui-config.json`  \n\n- diffusers:  \n  - support for **distilled** sd models  \n    just go to models/huggingface and download a model, for example:  \n    `segmind/tiny-sd`, `segmind/small-sd`, `segmind/portrait-finetuned`  \n    those are lower quality, but extremely small and fast  \n    up to 50% faster than sd 1.5 and execute in as little as 2.1gb of vram  \n- general:  \n  - redesigned **settings**  \n    - new layout with separated sections:  \n      *settings, ui config, licenses, system info, benchmark, models*  \n    - **system info** tab is now part of settings  \n      when running outside of sdnext, system info is shown in main ui  \n    - all system and image paths are now relative by default  \n    - add settings validation when performing load/save  \n    - settings tab in ui now shows settings that are changed from default values  \n    - settings tab switch to compact view  \n  - update **gradio** major version  \n    this may result in some smaller layout changes since its a major version change  \n    however, browser page load is now much faster  \n  - optimizations:\n    - optimize model hashing  \n    - add cli param `--skip-all` that skips all installer checks  \n      use at personal discretion, but it can be useful for bulk deployments  \n    - add model **precompile** option (when model compile is enabled)  \n    - **extra network** folder info caching  \n      results in much faster startup when you have large number of extra networks  \n    - faster **xyz grid** switching  \n      especially when using different checkpoints  \n  - update **second pass** options for clarity\n  - models:\n    - civitai download missing model previews\n  - add **openvino** (experimental) cpu optimized model compile and inference  \n    enable with `--use-openvino`  \n    thanks @disty0  \n  - enable batch **img2img** scale-by workflows  \n    now you can batch process with rescaling based on each individual original image size  \n  - fixes:\n    - fix extra networks previews  \n    - css fixes  \n    - improved extensions compatibility (e.g. *sd-cn-animation*)  \n    - allow changing **vae** on-the-fly for both original and diffusers backend\n\n## Update for 2023-08-20\n\nAnother release thats been baking in dev branch for a while...\n\n- general:\n  - caching of extra network information to enable much faster create/refresh operations  \n    thanks @midcoastal\n- diffusers:\n  - add **hires** support (*experimental*)  \n    applies to all model types that support img2img, including **sd** and **sd-xl**  \n    also supports all hires upscaler types as well as standard params like steps and denoising strength  \n    when used with **sd-xl**, it can be used with or without refiner loaded  \n    how to enable - there are no explicit checkboxes other than second pass itself:\n    - hires: upscaler is set and target resolution is not at default  \n    - refiner: if refiner model is loaded  \n  - images save options: *before hires*, *before refiner*\n  - redo `move model to cpu` logic in settings -> diffusers to be more reliable  \n    note that system defaults have also changed, so you may need to tweak to your liking  \n  - update dependencies\n\n## Update for 2023-08-17\n\nSmaller update, but with some breaking changes (to prepare for future larger functionality)...\n\n- general:\n  - update all metadata saved with images  \n    see <https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki/Metadata> for details  \n  - improved **amd** installer with support for **navi 2x & 3x** and **rocm 5.4/5.5/5.6**  \n    thanks @evshiron  \n  - fix **img2img** resizing (applies to *original, diffusers, hires*)  \n  - config change: main `config.json` no longer contains entire configuration  \n    but only differences from defaults (similar to recent change performed to `ui-config.json`)  \n- diffusers:\n  - enable **batch img2img** workflows  \n- original:  \n  - new samplers: **dpm++ 3M sde** (standard and karras variations)  \n    enable in *settings -> samplers -> show samplers*\n  - expose always/never discard penultimate sigma  \n    enable in *settings -> samplers*  \n\n## Update for 2023-08-11\n\nThis is a big one thats been cooking in `dev` for a while now, but finally ready for release...\n\n- diffusers:\n  - **pipeline autodetect**\n    if pipeline is set to autodetect (default for new installs), app will try to autodetect pipeline based on selected model  \n    this should reduce user errors such as loading **sd-xl** model when **sd** pipeline is selected  \n  - **quick vae decode** as alternative to full vae decode which is very resource intensive  \n    quick decode is based on `taesd` and produces lower quality, but its great for tests or grids as it runs much faster and uses far less vram  \n    disabled by default, selectable in *txt2img/img2img -> advanced -> full quality*  \n  - **prompt attention** for sd and sd-xl  \n    supports both `full parser` and native `compel`  \n    thanks @ai-casanova  \n  - advanced **lora load/apply** methods  \n    in addition to standard lora loading that was recently added to sd-xl using diffusers, now we have  \n    - **sequential apply** (load & apply multiple loras in sequential manner) and  \n    - **merge and apply** (load multiple loras and merge before applying to model)  \n    see *settings -> diffusers -> lora methods*  \n    thanks @hameerabbasi and @ai-casanova  \n  - **sd-xl vae** from safetensors now applies correct config  \n    result is that 3rd party vaes can be used without washed out colors  \n  - options for optimized memory handling for lower memory usage  \n    see *settings -> diffusers*\n- general:\n  - new **civitai model search and download**  \n    native support for civitai, integrated into ui as *models -> civitai*  \n  - updated requirements  \n    this time its a bigger change so upgrade may take longer to install new requirements\n  - improved **extra networks** performance with large number of networks\n\n## Update for 2023-08-05\n\nAnother minor update, but it unlocks some cool new items...\n\n- diffusers:\n  - vaesd live preview (sd and sd-xl)  \n  - fix inpainting (sd and sd-xl)  \n- general:\n  - new torch 2.0 with ipex (intel arc)  \n  - additional callbacks for extensions  \n    enables latest comfyui extension  \n\n## Update for 2023-07-30\n\nSmaller release, but IMO worth a post...\n\n- diffusers:\n  - sd-xl loras are now supported!\n  - memory optimizations: Enhanced sequential CPU offloading, model CPU offload, FP16 VAE\n    - significant impact if running SD-XL (for example, but applies to any model) with only 8GB VRAM\n  - update packages\n- minor bugfixes\n\n## Update for 2023-07-26\n\nThis is a big one, new models, new diffusers, new features and updated UI...\n\nFirst, **SD-XL 1.0** is released and yes, SD.Next supports it out of the box!\n\n- [SD-XL Base](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0/blob/main/sd_xl_base_1.0.safetensors)\n- [SD-XL Refiner](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-refiner-1.0/blob/main/sd_xl_refiner_1.0.safetensors)\n\nAlso fresh is new **Kandinsky 2.2** model that does look quite nice:\n\n- [Kandinsky Decoder](https://huggingface.co/kandinsky-community/kandinsky-2-2-decoder)\n- [Kandinsky Prior](https://huggingface.co/kandinsky-community/kandinsky-2-2-prior)\n\nActual changelog is:\n\n- general:\n  - new loading screens and artwork\n  - major ui simplification for both txt2img and img2img  \n    nothing is removed, but you can show/hide individual sections  \n    default is very simple interface, but you can enable any sections and save it as default in settings  \n  - themes: add additional built-in theme, `amethyst-nightfall`\n  - extra networks: add add/remove tags to prompt (e.g. lora activation keywords)\n  - extensions: fix couple of compatibility items\n  - firefox compatibility improvements\n  - minor image viewer improvements\n  - add backend and operation info to metadata\n\n- diffusers:\n  - were out of experimental phase and diffusers backend is considered stable  \n  - sd-xl: support for **sd-xl 1.0** official model\n  - sd-xl: loading vae now applies to both base and refiner and saves a bit of vram  \n  - sd-xl: denoising_start/denoising_end\n  - sd-xl: enable dual prompts  \n    dual prompt is used if set regardless if refiner is enabled/loaded  \n    if refiner is loaded & enabled, refiner prompt will also be used for refiner pass  \n    - primary prompt goes to [OpenAI CLIP-ViT/L-14](https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-large-patch14)\n    - refiner prompt goes to [OpenCLIP-ViT/bigG-14](https://huggingface.co/laion/CLIP-ViT-bigG-14-laion2B-39B-b160k)\n  - **kandinsky 2.2** support  \n    note: kandinsky model must be downloaded using model downloader, not as safetensors due to specific model format  \n  - refiner: fix batch processing\n  - vae: enable loading of pure-safetensors vae files without config  \n    also enable *automatic* selection to work with diffusers  \n  - sd-xl: initial lora support  \n    right now this applies to official lora released by **stability-ai**, support for **kohyas** lora is expected soon  \n  - implement img2img and inpainting (experimental)  \n    actual support and quality depends on model  \n    it works as expected for sd 1.5, but not so much for sd-xl for now  \n  - implement limited stop/interrupt for diffusers\n    works between stages, not within steps  \n  - add option to save image before refiner pass  \n  - option to set vae upcast in settings  \n  - enable fp16 vae decode when using optimized vae  \n    this pretty much doubles performance of decode step (delay after generate is done)  \n\n- original\n  - fix hires secondary sampler  \n    this now fully obsoletes `fallback_sampler` and `force_hr_sampler_name`  \n\n\n## Update for 2023-07-18\n\nWhile were waiting for official SD-XL release, heres another update with some fixes and enhancements...\n\n- **global**\n  - image save: option to add invisible image watermark to all your generated images  \n    disabled by default, can be enabled in settings -> image options  \n    watermark information will be shown when loading image such as in process image tab  \n    also additional cli utility `/cli/image-watermark.py` to read/write/strip watermarks from images  \n  - batch processing: fix metadata saving, also allow to drag&drop images for batch processing  \n  - ui configuration: you can modify all ui default values from settings as usual,  \n    but only values that are non-default will be written to `ui-config.json`  \n  - startup: add cmd flag to skip all `torch` checks  \n  - startup: force requirements check on each server start  \n    there are too many misbehaving extensions that change system requirements  \n  - internal: safe handling of all config file read/write operations  \n    this allows sdnext to run in fully shared environments and prevents any possible configuration corruptions  \n- **diffusers**:\n  - sd-xl: remove image watermarks autocreated by 0.9 model  \n  - vae: enable loading of external vae, documented in diffusers wiki  \n    and mix&match continues, you can even use sd-xl vae with sd 1.5 models!  \n  - samplers: add concept of *default* sampler to avoid needing to tweak settings for primary or second pass  \n    note that sampler details will be printed in log when running in debug level  \n  - samplers: allow overriding of sampler beta values in settings  \n  - refiner: fix refiner applying only to first image in batch  \n  - refiner: allow using direct latents or processed output in refiner  \n  - model: basic support for one more model: [UniDiffuser](https://github.com/thu-ml/unidiffuser)  \n    download using model downloader: `thu-ml/unidiffuser-v1`  \n    and set resolution to 512x512  \n\n## Update for 2023-07-14\n\nTrying to unify settings for both original and diffusers backend without introducing duplicates...\n\n- renamed **hires fix** to **second pass**  \n  as that is what it actually is, name hires fix is misleading to start with  \n- actual **hires fix** and **refiner** are now options inside **second pass** section  \n- obsoleted settings -> sampler -> **force_hr_sampler_name**  \n  it is now part of **second pass** options and it works the same for both original and diffusers backend  \n  which means you can use different scheduler settings for txt2img and hires if you want  \n- sd-xl refiner will run if its loaded and if second pass is enabled  \n  so you can quickly enable/disable refiner by simply enabling/disabling second pass  \n- you can mix&match **model** and **refiner**  \n  for example, you can generate image using sd 1.5 and still use sd-xl refiner as second pass  \n- reorganized settings -> samplers to show which section refers to which backend  \n- added diffusers **lmsd** sampler  \n\n## Update for 2023-07-13\n\nAnother big one, but now improvements to both **diffusers** and **original** backends as well plus ability to dynamically switch between them!\n\n- swich backend between diffusers and original on-the-fly\n  - you can still use `--backend <backend>` and now that only means in which mode app will start,\n    but you can change it anytime in ui settings\n  - for example, you can even do things like generate image using sd-xl,  \n    then switch to original backend and perform inpaint using a different model  \n- diffusers backend:\n  - separate ui settings for refiner pass with sd-xl  \n    you can specify: prompt, negative prompt, steps, denoise start  \n  - fix loading from pure safetensors files  \n    now you can load sd-xl from safetensors file or from huggingface folder format  \n  - fix kandinsky model (2.1 working, 2.2 was just released and will be soon)  \n- original backend:\n  - improvements to vae/unet handling as well as cross-optimization heads  \n    in non-technical terms, this means lower memory usage and higher performance  \n    and you should be able to generate higher resolution images without any other changes\n- other:\n  - major refactoring of the javascript code  \n    includes fixes for text selections and navigation  \n  - system info tab now reports on nvidia driver version as well  \n  - minor fixes in extra-networks  \n  - installer handles origin changes for submodules  \n\nbig thanks to @huggingface team for great communication, support and fixing all the reported issues asap!\n\n\n## Update for 2023-07-10\n\nService release with some fixes and enhancements:\n\n- diffusers:\n  - option to move base and/or refiner model to cpu to free up vram  \n  - model downloader options to specify model variant / revision / mirror  \n  - now you can download `fp16` variant directly for reduced memory footprint  \n  - basic **img2img** workflow (*sketch* and *inpaint* are not supported yet)  \n    note that **sd-xl** img2img workflows are architecturaly different so it will take longer to implement  \n  - updated hints for settings  \n- extra networks:\n  - fix corrupt display on refesh when new extra network type found  \n  - additional ui tweaks  \n  - generate thumbnails from previews only if preview resolution is above 1k\n- image viewer:\n  - fixes for non-chromium browsers and mobile users and add option to download image  \n  - option to download image directly from image viewer\n- general\n  - fix startup issue with incorrect config  \n  - installer should always check requirements on upgrades\n\n## Update for 2023-07-08\n\nThis is a massive update which has been baking in a `dev` branch for a while now\n\n- merge experimental diffusers support  \n\n*TL;DR*: Yes, you can run **SD-XL** model in **SD.Next** now  \nFor details, see Wiki page: [Diffusers](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki/Diffusers)  \nNote this is still experimental, so please follow Wiki  \nAdditional enhancements and fixes will be provided over the next few days  \n*Thanks to @huggingface team for making this possible and our internal @team for all the early testing*\n\nRelease also contains number of smaller updates:\n\n- add pan & zoom controls (touch and mouse) to image viewer (lightbox)  \n- cache extra networks between tabs  \n  this should result in neat 2x speedup on building extra networks  \n- add settings -> extra networks -> do not automatically build extra network pages  \n  speeds up app start if you have a lot of extra networks and you want to build them manually when needed  \n- extra network ui tweaks  \n\n## Update for 2023-07-01\n\nSmall quality-of-life updates and bugfixes:\n\n- add option to disallow usage of ckpt checkpoints\n- change lora and lyco dir without server restart\n- additional filename template fields: `uuid`, `seq`, `image_hash`  \n- image toolbar is now shown only when image is present\n- image `Zip` button gone and its not optional setting that applies to standard `Save` button\n- folder `Show` button is present only when working on localhost,  \n  otherwise its replaced with `Copy` that places image URLs on clipboard so they can be used in other apps\n\n## Update for 2023-06-30\n\nA bit bigger update this time, but contained to specific areas...\n\n- change in behavior  \n  extensions no longer auto-update on startup  \n  using `--upgrade` flag upgrades core app as well as all submodules and extensions  \n- **live server log monitoring** in ui  \n  configurable via settings -> live preview  \n- new **extra networks interface**  \n  *note: if youre using a 3rd party ui extension for extra networks, it will likely need to be updated to work with new interface*\n  - display in front of main ui, inline with main ui or as a sidebar  \n  - lazy load thumbnails  \n    drastically reduces load times for large number of extra networks  \n  - auto-create thumbnails from preview images in extra networks in a background thread  \n    significant load time saving on subsequent restarts  \n  - support for info files in addition to description files  \n  - support for variable aspect-ratio thumbnails  \n  - new folder view  \n- **extensions sort** by trending  \n- add requirements check for training  \n\n## Update for 2023-06-26\n\n- new training tab interface  \n  - redesigned preprocess, train embedding, train hypernetwork  \n- new models tab interface  \n  - new model convert functionality, thanks @akegarasu  \n  - new model verify functionality  \n- lot of ipex specific fixes/optimizations, thanks @disty0  \n\n## Update for 2023-06-20\n\nThis one is less relevant for standard users, but pretty major if youre running an actual server  \nBut even if not, it still includes bunch of cumulative fixes since last release - and going by number of new issues, this is probably the most stable release so far...\n(next one is not going to be as stable, but it will be fun :) )\n\n- minor improvements to extra networks ui  \n- more hints/tooltips integrated into ui  \n- new dedicated api server  \n  - but highly promising for high throughput server  \n- improve server logging and monitoring with  \n  - server log file rotation  \n  - ring buffer with api endpoint `/sdapi/v1/log`  \n  - real-time status and load endpoint `/sdapi/v1/system-info/status`\n\n## Update for 2023-06-14\n\nSecond stage of a jumbo merge from upstream plus few minor changes...\n\n- simplify token merging  \n- reorganize some settings  \n- all updates from upstream: **A1111** v1.3.2 [df004be] *(latest release)*  \n  pretty much nothing major that i havent released in previous versions, but its still a long list of tiny changes  \n  - skipped/did-not-port:  \n    add separate hires prompt: unnecessarily complicated and spread over large number of commits due to many regressions  \n    allow external scripts to add cross-optimization methods: dangerous and i dont see a use case for it so far  \n    load extension info in threads: unnecessary as other optimizations ive already put place perform equally good  \n  - broken/reverted:  \n    sub-quadratic optimization changes  \n\n## Update for 2023-06-13\n\nJust a day later and one *bigger update*...\nBoth some **new functionality** as well as **massive merges** from upstream  \n\n- new cache for models/lora/lyco metadata: `metadata.json`  \n  drastically reduces disk access on app startup  \n- allow saving/resetting of **ui default values**  \n  settings -> ui defaults\n- ability to run server without loaded model  \n  default is to auto-load model on startup, can be changed in settings -> stable diffusion  \n  if disabled, model will be loaded on first request, e.g. when you click generate  \n  useful when you want to start server to perform other tasks like upscaling which do not rely on model  \n- updated `accelerate` and `xformers`\n- huge nubmer of changes ported from **A1111** upstream  \n  this was a massive merge, hopefully this does not cause any regressions  \n  and still a bit more pending...\n\n## Update for 2023-06-12\n\n- updated ui labels and hints to improve clarity and provide some extra info  \n  this is 1st stage of the process, more to come...  \n  if you want to join the effort, see <https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/discussions/1246>\n- new localization and hints engine  \n  how hints are displayed can be selected in settings -> ui  \n- reworked **installer** sequence  \n  as some extensions are loading packages directly from their preload sequence  \n  which was preventing some optimizations to take effect  \n- updated **settings** tab functionality, thanks @gegell  \n  with real-time monitor for all new and/or updated settings  \n- **launcher** will now warn if application owned files are modified  \n  you are free to add any user files, but do not modify app files unless youre sure in what youre doing  \n- add more profiling for scripts/extensions so you can see what takes time  \n  this applies both to initial load as well as execution  \n- experimental `sd_model_dict` setting which allows you to load model dictionary  \n  from one model and apply weights from another model specified in `sd_model_checkpoint`  \n  results? who am i to judge :)\n\n\n## Update for 2023-06-05\n\nFew new features and extra handling for broken extensions  \nthat caused my phone to go crazy with notifications over the weekend...\n\n- added extra networks to **xyz grid** options  \n  now you can have more fun with all your embeddings and loras :)  \n- new **vae decode** method to help with larger batch sizes, thanks @bigdog  \n- new setting -> lora -> **use lycoris to handle all lora types**  \n  this is still experimental, but the goal is to obsolete old built-in lora module  \n  as it doesnt understand many new loras and built-in lyco module can handle it all  \n- somewhat optimize browser page loading  \n  still slower than id want, but gradio is pretty bad at this  \n- profiling of scripts/extensions callbacks  \n  you can now see how much or pre/post processing is done, not just how long generate takes  \n- additional exception handling so bad exception does not crash main app  \n- additional background removal models  \n- some work on bfloat16 which nobody really should be using, but why not 🙂\n\n\n## Update for 2023-06-02\n\nSome quality-of-life improvements while working on larger stuff in the background...\n\n- redesign action box to be uniform across all themes  \n- add **pause** option next to stop/skip  \n- redesigned progress bar  \n- add new built-in extension: **agent-scheduler**  \n  very elegant way to getting full queueing capabilities, thank @artventurdev  \n- enable more image formats  \n  note: not all are understood by browser so previews and images may appear as blank  \n  unless you have some browser extensions that can handle them  \n  but they are saved correctly. and cant beat raw quality of 32-bit `tiff` or `psd` :)  \n- change in behavior: `xformers` will be uninstalled on startup if they are not active  \n  if you do have `xformers` selected as your desired cross-optimization method, then they will be used  \n  reason is that a lot of libaries try to blindly import xformers even if they are not selected or not functional  \n\n## Update for 2023-05-30\n\nAnother bigger one...And more to come in the next few days...\n\n- new live preview mode: taesd  \n  i really like this one, so its enabled as default for new installs  \n- settings search feature  \n- new sampler: dpm++ 2m sde  \n- fully common save/zip/delete (new) options in all tabs  \n  which (again) meant rework of process image tab  \n- system info tab: live gpu utilization/memory graphs for nvidia gpus  \n- updated controlnet interface  \n- minor style changes  \n- updated lora, swinir, scunet and ldsr code from upstream  \n- start of merge from a1111 v1.3  \n\n## Update for 2023-05-26\n\nSome quality-of-life improvements...\n\n- updated [README](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/blob/master/README.md)\n- created [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)  \n  this will be the source for all info about new things moving forward  \n  and cross-posted to [Discussions#99](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/discussions/99) as well as discord [announcements](https://discord.com/channels/1101998836328697867/1109953953396957286)\n- optimize model loading on startup  \n  this should reduce startup time significantly  \n- set default cross-optimization method for each platform backend  \n  applicable for new installs only  \n  - `cuda` => Scaled-Dot-Product\n  - `rocm` => Sub-quadratic\n  - `directml` => Sub-quadratic\n  - `ipex` => invokeais\n  - `mps` => Doggettxs\n  - `cpu` => Doggettxs\n- optimize logging  \n- optimize profiling  \n  now includes startup profiling as well as `cuda` profiling during generate  \n- minor lightbox improvements  \n- bugfixes...i dont recall when was a release with at least several of those  \n\nother than that - first stage of [Diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) integration is now in master branch  \ni dont recommend anyone to try it (and dont even think reporting issues for it)  \nbut if anyone wants to contribute, take a look at [project page](https://github.com/users/vladmandic/projects/1/views/1)\n\n## Update for 2023-05-23\n\nMajor internal work with perhaps not that much user-facing to show for it ;)\n\n- update core repos: **stability-ai**, **taming-transformers**, **k-diffusion, blip**, **codeformer**  \n  note: to avoid disruptions, this is applicable for new installs only\n- tested with **torch 2.1**, **cuda 12.1**, **cudnn 8.9**  \n  (production remains on torch2.0.1+cuda11.8+cudnn8.8)  \n- fully extend support of `--data-dir`  \n  allows multiple installations to share pretty much everything, not just models  \n  especially useful if you want to run in a stateless container or cloud instance  \n- redo api authentication  \n  now api authentication will use same user/pwd (if specified) for ui and strictly enforce it using httpbasicauth  \n  new authentication is also fully supported in combination with ssl for both sync and async calls  \n  if you want to use api programatically, see examples in `cli/sdapi.py`  \n- add dark/light theme mode toggle  \n- redo some `clip-skip` functionality  \n- better matching for vae vs model  \n- update to `xyz grid` to allow creation of large number of images without creating grid itself  \n- update `gradio` (again)  \n- more prompt parser optimizations  \n- better error handling when importing image settings which are not compatible with current install  \n  for example, when upscaler or sampler originally used is not available  \n- fixes...amazing how many issues were introduced by porting a1111 v1.20 code without adding almost no new functionality  \n  next one is v1.30 (still in dev) which does bring a lot of new features  \n\n## Update for 2023-05-17\n\nThis is a massive one due to huge number of changes,  \nbut hopefully it will go ok...\n\n- new **prompt parsers**  \n  select in UI -> Settings -> Stable Diffusion  \n  - **Full**: my new implementation  \n  - **A1111**: for backward compatibility  \n  - **Compel**: as used in ComfyUI and InvokeAI (a.k.a *Temporal Weighting*)  \n  - **Fixed**: for really old backward compatibility  \n- monitor **extensions** install/startup and  \n  log if they modify any packages/requirements  \n  this is a *deep-experimental* python hack, but i think its worth it as extensions modifying requirements  \n  is one of most common causes of issues\n- added `--safe` command line flag mode which skips loading user extensions  \n  please try to use it before opening new issue  \n- reintroduce `--api-only` mode to start server without ui  \n- port *all* upstream changes from [A1111](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)  \n  up to today - commit hash `89f9faa`  \n\n## Update for 2023-05-15\n\n- major work on **prompt parsing**\n  this can cause some differences in results compared to what youre used to, but its all about fixes & improvements\n  - prompt parser was adding commas and spaces as separate words and tokens and/or prefixes\n  - negative prompt weight using `[word:weight]` was ignored, it was always `0.909`\n  - bracket matching was anything but correct. complex nested attention brackets are now working.\n  - btw, if you run with `--debug` flag, youll now actually see parsed prompt & schedule\n- updated all scripts in `/cli`  \n- add option in settings to force different **latent sampler** instead of using primary only\n- add **interrupt/skip** capabilities to process images\n\n## Update for 2023-05-13\n\nThis is mostly about optimizations...\n\n- improved `torch-directml` support  \n  especially interesting for **amd** users on **windows**  where **torch+rocm** is not yet available  \n  dont forget to run using `--use-directml` or default is **cpu**  \n- improved compatibility with **nvidia** rtx 1xxx/2xxx series gpus  \n- fully working `torch.compile` with **torch 2.0.1**  \n  using `inductor` compile takes a while on first run, but does result in 5-10% performance increase  \n- improved memory handling  \n  for highest performance, you can also disable aggressive **gc** in settings  \n- improved performance  \n  especially *after* generate as image handling has been moved to separate thread  \n- allow per-extension updates in extension manager  \n- option to reset configuration in settings  \n\n## Update for 2023-05-11\n\n- brand new **extension manager**  \n  this is pretty much a complete rewrite, so new issues are possible\n- support for `torch` 2.0.1  \n  note that if you are experiencing frequent hangs, this may be a worth a try  \n- updated `gradio` to 3.29.0\n- added `--reinstall` flag to force reinstall of all packages  \n- auto-recover & re-attempt when `--upgrade` is requested but fails\n- check for duplicate extensions  \n\n## Update for 2023-05-08\n\nBack online with few updates:\n\n- bugfixes. yup, quite a lot of those  \n- auto-detect some cpu/gpu capabilities on startup  \n  this should reduce need to tweak and tune settings like no-half, no-half-vae, fp16 vs fp32, etc  \n- configurable order of top level tabs  \n- configurable order of scripts in txt2img and img2img  \n  for both, see sections in ui-> settings -> user interface\n\n## Update for 2023-05-04\n\nAgain, few days later...\n\n- reviewed/ported **all** commits from **A1111** upstream  \n  some a few are not applicable as i already have alternative implementations  \n  and very few i choose not to implement (save/restore last-known-good-config is a bad hack)  \n  otherwise, were fully up to date (it doesnt show on fork status as code merges were mostly manual due to conflicts)  \n  but...due to sheer size of the updates, this may introduce some temporary issues  \n- redesigned server restart function  \n  now available and working in ui  \n  actually, since server restart is now a true restart and not ui restart, it can be used much more flexibly  \n- faster model load  \n  plus support for slower devices via stream-load function (in ui settings)  \n- better logging  \n  this includes new `--debug` flag for more verbose logging when troubleshooting  \n\n## Update for 2023-05-01\n\nBeen a bit quieter for last few days as changes were quite significant, but finally here we are...\n\n- Updated core libraries: Gradio, Diffusers, Transformers\n- Added support for **Intel ARC** GPUs via Intel OneAPI IPEX (auto-detected)\n- Added support for **TorchML** (set by default when running on non-compatible GPU or on CPU)\n- Enhanced support for AMD GPUs with **ROCm**\n- Enhanced support for Apple **M1/M2**\n- Redesigned command params: run `webui --help` for details\n- Redesigned API and script processing\n- Experimental support for multiple **Torch compile** options\n- Improved sampler support\n- Google Colab: <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/126cDNwHfifCyUpCCQF9IHpEdiXRfHrLN>  \n  Maintained by <https://github.com/Linaqruf/sd-notebook-collection>\n- Fixes, fixes, fixes...\n\nTo take advantage of new out-of-the-box tunings, its recommended to delete your `config.json` so new defaults are applied. its not necessary, but otherwise you may need to play with UI Settings to get the best of Intel ARC, TorchML, ROCm or Apple M1/M2.\n\n## Update for 2023-04-27\n\na bit shorter list as:\n\n- ive been busy with bugfixing  \n  there are a lot of them, not going to list each here.  \n  but seems like critical issues backlog is quieting down and soon i can focus on new features development.  \n- ive started collaboration with couple of major projects,\n  hopefully this will accelerate future development.\n\nwhats new:\n\n- ability to view/add/edit model description shown in extra networks cards  \n- add option to specify fallback sampler if primary sampler is not compatible with desired operation  \n- make clip skip a local parameter  \n- remove obsolete items from UI settings  \n- set defaults for AMD ROCm  \n  if you have issues, you may want to start with a fresh install so configuration can be created from scratch\n- set defaults for Apple M1/M2  \n  if you have issues, you may want to start with a fresh install so configuration can be created from scratch\n\n## Update for 2023-04-25\n\n- update process image -> info\n- add VAE info to metadata\n- update GPU utility search paths for better GPU type detection\n- update git flags for wider compatibility\n- update environment tuning\n- update ti training defaults\n- update VAE search paths\n- add compatibility opts for some old extensions\n- validate script args for always-on scripts  \n  fixes: deforum with controlnet  \n\n## Update for 2023-04-24\n\n- identify race condition where generate locks up while fetching preview\n- add pulldowns to x/y/z script\n- add VAE rollback feature in case of NaNs\n- use samples format for live preview\n- add token merging\n- use **Approx NN** for live preview\n- create default `styles.csv`\n- fix setup not installing `tensorflow` dependencies\n- update default git flags to reduce number of warnings\n\n## Update for 2023-04-23\n\n- fix VAE dtype  \n  should fix most issues with NaN or black images  \n- add built-in Gradio themes  \n- reduce requirements  \n- more AMD specific work\n- initial work on Apple platform support\n- additional PR merges\n- handle torch cuda crashing in setup\n- fix setup race conditions\n- fix ui lightbox\n- mark tensorflow as optional\n- add additional image name templates\n\n## Update for 2023-04-22\n\n- autodetect which system libs should be installed  \n  this is a first pass of autoconfig for **nVidia** vs **AMD** environments  \n- fix parse cmd line args from extensions  \n- only install `xformers` if actually selected as desired cross-attention method\n- do not attempt to use `xformers` or `sdp` if running on cpu\n- merge tomesd token merging  \n- merge 23 PRs pending from a1111 backlog (!!)\n\n*expect shorter updates for the next few days as ill be partially ooo*\n\n## Update for 2023-04-20\n\n- full CUDA tuning section in UI Settings\n- improve exif/pnginfo metadata parsing  \n  it can now handle 3rd party images or images edited in external software\n- optimized setup performance and logging\n- improve compatibility with some 3rd party extensions\n  for example handle extensions that install packages directly from github urls\n- fix initial model download if no models found\n- fix vae not found issues\n- fix multiple git issues\n\nnote: if you previously had command line optimizations such as --no-half, those are now ignored and moved to ui settings\n\n## Update for 2023-04-19\n\n- fix live preview\n- fix model merge\n- fix handling of user-defined temp folders\n- fix submit benchmark\n- option to override `torch` and `xformers` installer\n- separate benchmark data for system-info extension\n- minor css fixes\n- created initial merge backlog from pending prs on a1111 repo  \n  see #258 for details\n\n## Update for 2023-04-18\n\n- reconnect ui to active session on browser restart  \n  this is one of most frequently asked for items, finally figured it out  \n  works for text and image generation, but not for process as there is no progress bar reported there to start with  \n- force unload `xformers` when not used  \n  improves compatibility with AMD/M1 platforms  \n- add `styles.csv` to UI settings to allow customizing path  \n- add `--skip-git` to cmd flags for power users that want  \n  to skip all git checks and operations and perform manual updates\n- add `--disable-queue` to cmd flags that disables Gradio queues (experimental)\n  this forces it to use HTTP instead of WebSockets and can help on unreliable network connections  \n- set scripts & extensions loading priority and allow custom priorities  \n  fixes random extension issues:  \n  `ScuNet` upscaler disappearing, `Additional Networks` not showing up on XYZ axis, etc.\n- improve html loading order\n- remove some `asserts` causing runtime errors and replace with user-friendly messages\n- update README.md\n\n## Update for 2023-04-17\n\n- **themes** are now dynamic and discovered

integrated **image info** functionality into **process image** tab and removed separate **image info** tab\n- more installer improvements\n- fix urls\n- updated github integration\n- make model download as optional if no models found\n\n## Update for 2023-04-16\n\n- support for ui themes! to to *settings* -> *user interface* -> \"ui theme*\n  includes 12 predefined themes\n- ability to restart server from ui\n- updated requirements\n- removed `styles.csv` from repo, its now fully under user control\n- removed model-keyword extension as overly aggressive\n- rewrite of the fastapi middleware handlers\n- install bugfixes, hopefully new installer is now ok  \\\n  i really want to focus on features and not troubleshooting installer\n\n## Update for 2023-04-15\n\n- update default values\n- remove `ui-config.json` from repo, its now fully under user control\n- updated extensions manager\n- updated locon/lycoris plugin\n- enable quick launch by default\n- add multidiffusion

changes\n\n- New launcher\n  - `webui.bat` and `webui.sh`:  \n    Platform specific wrapper scripts that starts `launch.py` in Python virtual environment  \n    *Note*: Server can run without virtual environment, but it is recommended to use it  \n    This is carry-over from original repo  \n    **If youre unsure which launcher to use, this is the one you want**  \n  - `launch.py`:  \n    Main startup script  \n    Can be used directly to start server in manually activated `venv` or to run it without `venv`  \n  - `installer.py`:  \n    Main installer, used by `launch.py`  \n  - `webui.py`:  \n    Main server script  \n- New logger\n- New exception handler\n- Built-in performance profiler\n- New requirements handling\n- Move of most of command line flags into UI Settings\n"

By contrast,\nour General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights\nwith two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer\nyou this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\nand/or modify the software.\n\n  A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that\nimprovements made in alternate versions of the program, if they\nreceive widespread use, become available for other developers to\nincorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and\nencouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of\nsoftware used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.\nThe GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and\nletting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its\nsource code to the public.\n\n  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to\nensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available\nto the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to\nprovide the source code of the modified version running there to the\nusers of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on\na publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source\ncode of the modified version.\n\n  An older license, called the Affero General Public License and\npublished by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is\na different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has\nreleased a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under\nthis license.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0.

The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.

Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the\nProgram, your modified version must prominently offer all users\ninteracting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version\nsupports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding\nSource of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source\nfrom a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary\nmeans of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source\nshall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3\nof the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the\nfollowing paragraph.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version\n3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions\nwill be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published\n    by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU Affero General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer\nnetwork, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to\nget its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its\ninterface could display a \"Source\" link that leads users to an archive\nof the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different\nsolutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the\nspecific requirements.\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n"

models](https://vladmandic.github.io/sdnext-docs/Model-Support/) and [model specs](https://vladmandic.github.io/sdnext-docs/Models/)  \n\n## Platform support\n\n- *nVidia* GPUs using **CUDA** libraries on both *Windows and Linux*  \n- *AMD* GPUs using **ROCm** libraries on *Linux*  \n  Support will be extended to *Windows* once AMD releases ROCm for Windows  \n- *Intel Arc* GPUs using **OneAPI** with *IPEX XPU* libraries on both *Windows and Linux*  \n- Any GPU compatible with *DirectX* on *Windows* using **DirectML** libraries  \n  This includes support for AMD GPUs that are not supported by native ROCm libraries  \n- Any GPU or device compatible with **OpenVINO** libraries on both *Windows and Linux*  \n- *Apple M1/M2* on *OSX* using built-in support in Torch with **MPS** optimizations  \n- *ONNX/Olive*  \n- *AMD* GPUs on Windows using **ZLUDA** libraries  \n\n## Getting started\n\n- Get started with **SD.Next** by following the [installation instructions](https://vladmandic.github.io/sdnext-docs/Installation/)  \n- For more details, check out [advanced installation](https://vladmandic.github.io/sdnext-docs/Advanced-Install/) guide  \n-
