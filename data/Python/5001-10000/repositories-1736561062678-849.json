If jadx is not present in your system, it will prompt you to download it.\n\n## Usage\n\nSimply,\n\n```bash\n$ apkleaks -f ~/path/to/file.apk\n# from Source\n$ python3 apkleaks.py -f ~/path/to/file.apk\n# or with Docker\n$ docker run -it --rm -v /tmp:/tmp dwisiswant0/apkleaks:latest -f /tmp/file.apk\n```\n\n## Options\n\nHere are all the options it supports.\n\n| **Argument**  \t| **Description**                             \t| **Example**                                                   |\n|---------------\t|---------------------------------------------\t|-------------------------------------------------------------  |\n| -f, --file    \t| APK file to scanning                        \t| `apkleaks -f file.apk`                                        |\n| -o, --output  \t| Write to file results _(random if not set)_ \t| `apkleaks -f file.apk -o results.txt`                         |\n| -p, --pattern \t| Path to custom patterns JSON                \t| `apkleaks -f file.apk -p custom-rules.json`                   |\n| -a, --args    \t| Disassembler arguments                      \t| `apkleaks -f file.apk --args=\"--deobf --log-level DEBUG\"`     |\n|     --json      | Save as JSON format                         \t| `apkleaks -f file.apk -o results.json --json`                 |\n\n### Output\n\nIn general, if you don't provide `-o` argument, then it will generate results file automatically.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> By default it will also save the results in text format, use `--json` argument if you want JSON output format.\n\n### Pattern\n\nCustom patterns can be added with the following argument to provide sensitive _search rules_ in the JSON file format: `--pattern /path/to/custom-rules.json`. If no file is set, the tool will use the default patterns found in [regexes.json](https://github.com/dwisiswant0/apkleaks/blob/master/config/regexes.json) file.\n\nHere's an example of what a custom pattern file could look like:\n\n```json\n// custom-rules.json\n{\n  \"Amazon AWS Access Key ID\": \"AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}\",\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nTo run the tool using these custom rules, use the following command:\n\n```bash\n$ apkleaks -f /path/to/file.apk -p rules.json -o ~/Documents/apkleaks-results.txt\n```\n\n### Arguments (disassembler)\n\nWe give user complete discretion to pass the disassembler arguments. For example, if you want to activate threads in `jadx` decompilation process, you can add it with `-a/--args` argument, example: `--args=\"--threads-count 5\"`.\n\n```\n$ apkleaks -f /path/to/file.apk -a \"--deobf --log-level DEBUG\"\n```\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Please pay attention to the default disassembler arguments we use to prevent collisions.\n\n## License\n\n`apkleaks` is distributed under Apache 2.\n\n## Acknowledments\n\nSince this tool includes some contributions, and I'm not an asshole, I'll publically thank the following users for their helps and resources:\n\n- [@ndelphit](https://github.com/ndelphit) - for his inspiring `apkurlgrep`, that's why this tool was made.\n- [@dxa4481](https://github.com/dxa4481) and y'all who contribute to `truffleHogRegexes`.\n- [@GerbenJavado](https://github.com/GerbenJavado) & [@Bankde](https://github.com/Bankde) - for awesome pattern to discover URLs, endpoints & their parameters from `LinkFinder`.\n- [@tomnomnom](https://github.com/tomnomnom/gf) - a `gf` patterns.\n- [@pxb1988](https://github.com/pxb1988) - for awesome APK dissambler `dex2jar`.\n- [@subho007](https://github.com/ph4r05) for standalone APK parser.\n- `SHA2048#4361` _(Discord user)_ that help me porting code to Python3.\n- [@Ry0taK](https://github.com/Ry0taK) because he had reported an [OS command injection bug](https://github.com/dwisiswant0/apkleaks/security/advisories/GHSA-8434-v7xw-8m9x).\n- [@dee__see](https://twitter.com/dee__see) - for curated potentially sensitive tokens, `NotKeyHacks`.\n- [All contributors](https://github.com/dwisiswant0/apkleaks/graphs/contributors).\n"
