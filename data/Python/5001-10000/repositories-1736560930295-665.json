(#6597)\n- TCP throughput when sending data is slightly faster. (#12334)\n\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n\n- twisted.internet.endpoints.clientFromString can handle \"tls:\" endpoints with default `bindAddress`.\n  This was a regression introduced in 24.10.0. (#12350)\n- HTTP server can handle listening on filesystem UNIX sockets.\n  This was a regression introduced in 24.10.0. (#12365)\n- twisted.internet.tcp.Connection.setTcpNoDelay was updated to fix a potential failure when setting TCP_NODELAY on macOS. (#12372)\n\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n\n- twisted.python.constants, deprecated since 16.5.0, has been removed. (#12361)\n\n\nMisc\n----\n\n- #12354, #12355, #12356, #12357, #12367, #11869, #12377\n\n\nConch\n-----\n\nNo significant changes.\n\n\nWeb\n---\n\nNo significant changes.\n\n\nMail\n----\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.mail.imap.IMAPServer.arg_fetchatt can now detect that a IMAP partial request has been made that is longer than the original message and alter the output of the response in order to match the IMAPRev4 spec. (#12345)\n\n\nWords\n-----\n\nNo significant changes.\n\n\nNames\n-----\n\nNo significant changes.\n\n\nTrial\n-----\n\nNo significant changes.\n\n\nTwisted 24.10.0 (2024-10-28)\n============================\n\nNo changes since 24.10.0.rc1.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- Python 3.13 is now supported. (#11750)\n- twisted.internet.defer.succeed() is significantly faster, and awaiting Deferred has also been sped up. (#12225)\n- twisted.python.failure.Failure creation no longer records the place where it was created. This reduces creation time by 60% at least, thereby speeding up Deferred error handling. (#12230)\n- twisted.internet.defer.Deferred no longer removes the traceback object from Failures. This may result in more objects staying in memory if you don't clean up failed Deferreds, but it speeds up error handling and enables improvements to traceback reporting. (#12234)\n- twisted.internet.defer APIs are 2%-4% faster in many cases. (#12237)\n- twisted.internet.defer.Deferred runs callbacks with chained Deferreds a little faster. (#12284)\n- The reactor now will use a little less CPU when events have been scheduled with callLater(). (#12286)\n- Creation of twisted.python.failure.Failure is now faster. (#12288)\n\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n\n- Fixed unreleased regression caused by PR 12109. (#12279)\n- twisted.logger.eventAsText can now format the output having types/classes as input.\n  This was a regression introduced in Twisted 24.3.0. (#12323)\n- twisted.internet.endpoints.clientFromString for TLS endpoints with \"bindAddress=\"  no longer crashes during connect. twisted.internet.endpoints.HostnameEndpoint() no longer crashes when given a bindAddress= argument that is just a string, and that argument now accepts either address strings or (address, port) tuples. (#12325)\n- The URLs from README and pyproject.toml were updated. (#12327)\n\n\nMisc\n----\n\n- #11236, #12060, #12062, #12099, #12219, #12290, #12296, #12305, #12329, #12331, #12339\n\n\nConch\n-----\n\nFeatures\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.conch.ssh.keys.Key can now load public blob keys of type sk-ssh-ed25519@openssh.com and sk-ecdsa-sha2-nistp256@openssh.com. (#12211)\n\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.conch tests no longer rely on OpenSSH supporting DSA keys, fixing compatibility with OpenSSH >= 9.8. (#12273)\n- twisted.conch.ssh.SSHCiphers no longer supports the cast128-ctr, cast128-cbc, blowfish-ctr, and blowfish-cbc ciphers.\n  The Blowfish and CAST5 ciphers were removed as they were deprecated by the Python cryptography library. (#12308)\n\n\nMisc\n~~~~\n\n- #12313\n\n\nWeb\n---\n\nFeatures\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- The twisted.web HTTP server and client now reject HTTP header names containing whitespace or other invalid characters by raising twisted.web.http_headers.InvalidHeaderName, improving compliance with RFC 9110. As a side effect, the server is slightly faster. (#12191)\n- twisted.web.client and twisted.web.server now disable the Nagle algorithm (enable TCP_NODELAY), reducing the latency of small HTTP queries. (#12311)\n- twisted.web.server is 1-2% faster in some cases. (#12318)\n\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.web's HTTP/1.1 server now rejects header values containing a NUL byte with a 400 error, in compliance with RFC 9110. (#12228)\n- twisted.internet.address no longer raises DeprecationWarning when used with attrs>=24.1.0. (#12277)\n- twisted.web's HTTP/1.1 server now accepts '&' within tokens (methods, header field names, etc.), in compliance with RFC 9110. (#12301)\n\n\nMisc\n~~~~\n\n- #9743, #12276\n\n\nMail\n----\n\nNo significant changes.\n\n\nWords\n-----\n\nNo significant changes.\n\n\nNames\n-----\n\nNo significant changes.\n\n\nTrial\n-----\n\nFeatures\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- Trial's ``-j`` flag now accepts an ``auto`` keyword to spawn a number of workers based on the available CPUs. (#5824)\n\n\nTwisted 24.7.0 (2024-08-08)\n===========================\n\n24.7.0.rc2 fixed an unreleased regression caused by PR 12109. (#12279)\nNo other changes since 24.7.0.rc2\n\n\nSecurity Advisories\n-------------------\n\n- twisted.web.util.redirectTo now HTML-escapes the provided URL in the fallback response body it returns (GHSA-cf56-g6w6-pqq2, CVE-2024-41810). (#9839)\n- The HTTP 1.0 and 1.1 server provided by twisted.web could process pipelined HTTP requests out-of-order, possibly resulting in information disclosure (CVE-2024-41671/GHSA-c8m8-j448-xjx7) (#12248)\n\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- twisted.protocols.ftp now supports the IPv6 extensions defined in RFC 2428. (#9645)\n- twisted.internet.defer.inlineCallbacks can now yield a coroutine. (#9972)\n- twisted.python._shellcomp.ZshArgumentsGenerator was updated for Python 3.13. (#12065)\n- twisted.web.wsgi request environment now contains the peer port number as `REMOTE_PORT`. (#12096)\n- twisted.internet.defer.Deferred.callback() and twisted.internet.defer.Deferred.addCallbacks() no longer use `assert` to check the type of the arguments. You should now use type checking to validate your code. These changes were done to reduce the CPU usage. (#12122)\n- Added two new methods, twisted.logger.Logger.failuresHandled and twisted.logger.Logger.failureHandler, which allow for more concise and convenient handling of exceptions when dispatching out to application code.  The former can arbitrarily customize failure handling at the call site, and the latter can be used for performance-sensitive cases where no additional information needs to be logged. (#12188)\n- twisted.internet.defer.Deferred.addCallback now runs about 10% faster. (#12223)\n- twisted.internet.defer.Deferred error handling is now faster, taking 40% less time to run. (#12227)\n\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n\n- twisted.internet.ssl.Certificate.__repr__ can now handle certificates without a common name (CN) in the certificate itself or the signing CA. (#5851)\n- Type annotations have been added to twisted.conch.interfaces.IKnownHostEntry and its implementations, twisted.conch.client.knownhosts.PlainHost and twisted.conch.client.knownhosts.HashedHost, correcting a variety of type confusion issues throughout the conch client code. (#9713)\n- twisted.python.failure.Failure once again utilizes the custom pickling logic it used to in the past. (#12112)\n- twisted.conch.client.knownhosts.KnownHostsFile.verifyHostKey no longer logs an exception when automatically adding an IP address host key, which means the interactive `conch` command-line no longer will either. (#12141)\n\n\nImproved Documentation\n----------------------\n\n- The IRC server example found in the documentation was updated for readability. (#12097)\n- Remove contextvars from list of optional dependencies. (#12128)\n- The documentation for installing Twisted was moved into a single page. (#12145)\n- The project's compatibility policy now clearly indicates that the GitHub Actions test matrix defines the supported platforms. (#12167)\n- Updated imap4client.py example, it no longer references Python 2. (#12252)\n\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n\n- twisted.internet.defer.returnValue has been deprecated. You can replace it with the standard `return` statement. (#9930)\n- The `twisted-iocpsupport` is no longer a hard dependency on Windows.\n  The IOCP support is now installed together with the other Windows soft\n  dependencies via `twisted[windows-platform]`. (#11893)\n- twisted.python.deprecate helper function will now always strip whitespaces from the docstrings.\n  This is done to have the same behaviour as with Python 3.13. (#12063)\n- twisted.conch.manhole.ManholeInterpreter.write, twisted.conch.manhole.ManholeInterpreter.addOutput, twisted.mail.imap4.IMAP4Server.sendUntaggedResponse `async` argument, deprecated since 18.9.0, has been removed. (#12130)\n- twisted.web.soap was removed.\n  The SOAP support was already broken, for at least the last 4 years.\n  The SOAP support in Twisted has no active maintainer. (#12146)\n\n\nMisc\n----\n\n- #11744, #11771, #12113, #12154, #12169, #12179, #12193, #12195, #12197, #12215, #12221, #12243, #12249, #12254, #12259, #12669\n\n\nConch\n-----\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.conch.insults.window.Widget.functionKeyReceived now dispatches functional key events to corresponding `func_KEYNAME` methods, where `KEYNAME` can be `F1`, `F2`, `HOME`, `UP_ARROW` etc. This is a regression introduced with #8214 in Twisted 16.5.0, where events changed from `const` objects to bytestrings in square brackets like `[F1]`. (#12046)\n\n\nWeb\n---\n\nFeatures\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.web.agent.Agent now allows duplicate Content-Length headers having the same value, per RFC 9110 section 8.6. It is otherwise more strict when parsing Content-Length header values. (#9064)\n- twisted.web.client.HTTPConnectionPool used by HTTP clients now runs faster by using a little less CPU. (#12108)\n- twisted.web.http_headers now uses less CPU, making a small HTTP client request 10% faster or so. (#12116)\n- twisted.web's HTTP/1.1 server now runs a little faster, with about 10% lower CPU overhead. (#12133)\n- twisted.web's HTTP 1.1 server is an additional 5% faster. (#12155)\n\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.web.http.IM_A_TEAPOT was added and returns `I'm a teapot`\n  as default message for the status code 418,\n  as defined in RFC 2324 section 2.3.2. (#12104)\n- The HTTP 1.0/1.1 server provided by twisted.web is now more picky about the first line of a request, improving compliance with RFC 9112. (#12233)\n- The HTTP 1.0/1.1 server provided by twisted.web now constraints the character set of HTTP header names, improving compliance with RFC 9110. (#12235)\n\n\n\nImproved Documentation\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Fix ReverseProxyResource example in developer guide. (#12152)\n\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.web.util.ChildRedirector, which has never worked on Python 3, has been removed. (#9591)\n- ``twisted.web.http.Request.setResponseCode()`` no longer validates the types of inputs; we encourage you to use a type checker like mypy to catch these sort of errors. The long-deprecated ``twisted.web.server.string_date_time()`` and ``twisted.web.server.date_time_string()`` APIs were removed altogether. (#12133)\n- twisted.web.http.HTTPClient is now deprecated in favor of twisted.web.client.Agent (#12158)\n\n\nMisc\n~~~~\n\n- #12098, #12194, #12200, #12241, #12257\n\n\nMail\n----\n\nNo significant changes.\n\n\nWords\n-----\n\nNo significant changes.\n\n\nNames\n-----\n\nNo significant changes.\n\n\nTrial\n-----\n\nNo significant changes.\n\n\nTwisted 24.3.0 (2024-03-01)\n===========================\n\nThis release supports PyPy v7.3.14.\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n\n- twisted.logger.formatEvent now honors dotted method names, not just flat\n  function names, in format strings, as it has long been explicitly documented to\n  do.  So, you will now get the expected result from `formatEvent(\"here's the\n  result of calling a method at log-format time: {obj.method()}\", obj=...)` (#9347)\n- twisted.web.http.HTTPChannel now ignores the trailer headers provided in the last chunk of a chunked encoded response, rather than raising an exception. (#11997)\n- twisted.protocols.tls.BufferingTLSTransport, used by default by twisted.protocols.tls.TLSMemoryBIOFactory, was refactored for improved performance when doing a high number of small writes. (#12011)\n- twisted.python.failure.Failure now throws exception for generators without triggering a deprecation warnings on Python 3.12. (#12026)\n- twisted.internet.process.Process, used by ``reactor.spawnProcess``, now copies the parent environment when the `env=None` argument is passed on Posix systems and ``os.posix_spawnp`` is used internally. (#12068)\n- twisted.internet.defer.inlineCallbacks.returnValue's stack introspection was adjusted for the latest PyPy 7.3.14 release, allowing legacy @inlineCallbacks to run on new PyPY versions. (#12084)\n\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n\n- twisted.trial.reporter.TestRun.startTest() is no longer called for tests\n  with skip annotation or skip attribute for Python 3.12.1 or newer.\n  This is the result of upstream Python gh-106584 change.\n  The behavior is not change in 3.12.0 or older. (#12052)\n\n\nMisc\n----\n\n- #11902, #12018, #12023, #12031, #12032, #12052, #12056, #12067, #12076, #12078, #12087, #12095\n\n\nConch\n-----\n\nNo significant changes.\n\n\nWeb\n---\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- The documentation for twisted.web.client.CookieAgent no longer references\n  long-deprecated ``cookielib`` and ``urllib2`` standard library modules. (#12044)\n\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.web.http.Request now parses the `multipart/form-data` using `email.message_from_bytes`.\n  The usage of `cgi.parse_multipart` was removed as the `cgi` module will be removed in Python 3.13. (#11848)\n\n\nMisc\n~~~~\n\n- #12015\n\n\nMail\n----\n\nNo significant changes.\n\n\nWords\n-----\n\nImproved Documentation\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- The documented IRC example was updated for Python3 usage.

Additionally, FilePath is now generic, describing its mode, so you can annotate variables as FilePath[str] or FilePath[bytes] depending on the types that you wish to get back from the 'path' attribute and related methods like 'basename'. (#11822)\n- When using `CPython`, functions wrapped by `twisted.internet.defer.inlineCallbacks` can have their arguments and return values freed immediately after completion (due to there no longer being circular references). (#11885)\n\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n\n- Fix TypeError on t.i.cfreactor due to 3.10 type annotation syntax (#11965)\n- Fix the type annotations of DeferredLock.run, DeferredSemaphore.run, maybeDeferred, ensureDeferred, inlineCallbacks and fromCoroutine that used to return Deferred[Any] to return the result of the passed Coroutine/Coroutine function (#11985)\n- Fixed significant performance overhead (CPU and bandwidth) when doing small writes to a TLS transport. Specifically, small writes to a TLS transport are now buffered until the next reactor iteration. (#11989)\n- fix mypy due to hypothesis 6.85 (#11995)\n\n\nImproved Documentation\n----------------------\n\n- The search and version navigation for the documentation hosted on\n  Read The Docs was fixed.\n  This was a regression introduced with 23.8.0. (#12012)\n\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n\n- Drop support for Python 3.7. Remove twisted[contextvars] extra (contextvars are always available in Python 3.7+) (#11913)\n\n\nMisc\n----\n\n- #5206, #11583, #11787, #11871, #11912, #11921, #11922, #11926, #11932, #11934, #11936, #11938, #11940, #11942, #11945, #11948, #11952, #11953, #11955, #11957, #11959, #11961, #11964, #11973, #11977, #11980, #11982, #11993, #11999, #12004, #12005, #12009\n\n\nConch\n-----\n\nNo significant changes.\n\n\nWeb\n---\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- In Twisted 16.3.0, we changed twisted.web to stop dispatching HTTP/1.1\n  pipelined requests to application code.  There was a bug in this change which\n  still allowed clients which could send multiple full HTTP requests in a single\n  TCP segment to trigger asynchronous processing of later requests, which could\n  lead to out-of-order responses.  This has now been corrected and twisted.web\n  should never process a pipelined request over HTTP/1.1 until the previous\n  request has fully completed. (CVE-2023-46137, GHSA-cq7q-gv5w-rwx2) (#11976)\n\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.dom.microdom and twisted.web.domhelpers are now deprecated.

(2023-08-28)\n============================\n\nThis is the last release with support for Python 3.7.\n\nNo changes since 23.8.0.rc1.\n\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- reactor.spawnProcess() now uses posix_spawnp when possible, making it much more efficient (#5710)\n- Twisted now officially supports Python 3.11. (#10343)\n- twisted.internet.defer.Deferred.fromFuture now has a more precise type annotation. (#11753)\n- twisted.internet.defer._ConcurrencyPrimitive.__aexit__ now has a more precise type annotation. (#11795)\n- `twisted.internet.defer.race` has been added as a way to get the first available result from a list of Deferreds. (#11817)\n- The CI suite was updated to execute the tests using a Python 3.12 pre-release (#11857)\n\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n\n- twisted.conch.scripts.ckeygen now substitutes a default of \"~/.ssh/id_rsa\" if no keyfile is specified. (#6607)\n- Correct type hints for `IHostnameResolver.resolveHostName` and `IResolverSimple.getHostByName`. (#10276)\n- `twist conch --auth=sshkey` can now authenticate users without a traceback again, thanks to twisted.conch.unix.UnixConchUser no longer being incorrectly instantiated with `bytes`.  In the course of this fix, some type hinting has also been applied to `twisted.cred.portal`. (#11626)\n- twisted.internet.gireactor now works with Gtk4, and is tested and supported in CI again. (#11705)\n- When interrupted with control-C, `trial -j` no longer obscures tracebacks for\n  any errors caused by that interruption with an `UnboundLocalError` due to a bug\n  in its own implementation.  Note that there are still several internal\n  tracebacks that will be emitted upon exiting, because tearing down the test\n  runner mid-suite is still not an entirely clean operation, but it should at\n  least be possible to see errors reported from, for example, a test that is\n  hanging more clearly. (#11707)\n- PortableGIReactor and PortableGtkReactor are no longer necessary and are now aliases of GIReactor and Gtk2Reactor respectively, improving the performance of any applications using them. (#11738)\n- The Twisted package dependencies were updated to minimum versions that\n  will work with latest Twisted codebase. (#11740)\n- Deferred's type annotations have been made more comprehensive, precise, correct, and strict.  You may notice new type errors in your applications; be sure to check on those because they may represent real type errors! (#11772)\n- To prevent parsing errors and ensure validity when serializing HTML comments, twisted.web.template.flattenString has been updated to escape the --> sequence within comments. (#11804)\n- BadZipfile (with a small f) has been deprecated since Python 3.2,\n  use BadZipFile (big F) instead, added in 3.2. (#11821)\n- `twisted.web.template` now avoids unnecessary copying and is faster, particularly for templates with deep nesting. (#11834)\n- `twisted.web.template` now avoids some unecessary evaluation of type annotations and is faster. (#11835)\n- utcfromtimestamp has been deprecated since Python 3.12,\n  use fromtimestamp(x, timezone.utc).replace(tzinfo=None) instead. (#11908)\n\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n\n- Optional dependency \"extras\" names like `conch_nacl` now use hyphens rather than underscores to comply with PEP 685. The old names will be supported until the end of 2023. (#11655)\n- twisted.internet.gtk2reactor, twisted.internet.gtk3reactor, and twisted.internet.glib2reactor are now deprecated in favor of twisted.internet.gireactor. (#11705)\n- The minimum supported version of PyPy has been updated to 3.9.

(#11843)\n- Due to changes in the way raw private key byte serialization are handled in Cryptography, and widespread support for Ed25519 in current versions of OpenSSL, we no longer support PyNaCl as a fallback for Ed25519 keys in Conch.

This is a more reliable mechanism for choosing among several inherited descriptors. (#8147)\n\n\n\nImproved Documentation\n----------------------\n\n- The ``systemd`` endpoint parser's ``index`` parameter is now documented as leading to non-deterministic results in which descriptor is selected.  The new ``name`` parameter is now documented as preferred. (#8146)\n- The implementers of Zope interfaces are once more displayed in the documentations. (#11690)\n\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n\n- twisted.protocols.dict, which was deprecated in 17.9, has been removed.

(#11638)\n\n\nWeb\n---\n\nFeatures\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- The twisted.web.pages.errorPage, notFound, and forbidden each return an IResource that displays an HTML error pages safely rendered using twisted.web.template. (#11716)\n\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.web.error.Error.__str__ no longer raises an exception when the error's message attribute is None. Additionally, it validates that code is a plausible 3-digit HTTP status code. (#10271)\n- The typing of the twisted.web.http_headers.Headers methods addRawHeader() and setRawHeaders() now allow mixing str and bytes, matching the runtime behavior. (#11635)\n- twisted.web.vhost.NameVirtualHost no longer echoes HTML received in the Host header without escaping it (CVE-2022-39348, GHSA-vg46-2rrj-3647). (#11716)\n\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.web.resource.Resource.putChild now raises TypeError when the path argument is not bytes, rather than issuing a deprecation warning. (#8985)\n- The twisted.web.resource.ErrorPage, NoResource, and ForbiddenResource classes have been deprecated in favor of new implementations twisted.web.pages module because they permit HTML injection.

(#11657)\n\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- The implementation of ``trial -jN ...`` now handles test errors and failures larger than 64 kB.  It also handles other internal communication errors by logging them in the worker and attempting to send them to the parent process -- instead of crashing with ``UnknownRemoteError`` and no additional details. (#10314)\n- `trial -jN --logfile path` no longer hangs if *path* contains a directory separator. (#11580)\n\n\nMisc\n~~~~\n\n- #11649, #11661, #11677, #11710\n\n\nTwisted 22.8.0 (2022-09-06)\n===========================\n\nTwisted 22.8.0rc1 release candidate was released on 2022-08-28 and there are\nno changes between the release candidate and the final release.\n\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- twisted.internet.defer.maybeDeferred will now schedule a coroutine result as asynchronous operation and return a Deferred that fires with the result of the coroutine. (#10327)\n- Twisted now works with Cryptography versions 37 and above, and as a result, its minimum TLS protocol version has been upgraded to TLSv1.2. (#10377)\n\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n\n- ``twisted.internet.base.DelayedCall.__repr__`` will no longer raise ``AttributeError`` if the ``DelayedCall`` was created before debug mode was enabled.  As a side-effect, ``twisted.internet.base.DelayedCall.creator`` is now defined as ``None`` in cases where previously it was undefined. (#8306)\n- twisted.internet.iocpreactor.udp now properly re-queues its listener when there is a failure condition on the read from the socket. (#10052)\n- twisted.internet.defer.inlineCallbacks no longer causes confusing StopIteration tracebacks to be added to the top of tracebacks originating in triggered callbacks (#10260)\n- The typing of twisted.internet.task.react no longer constrains the type of argv. (#10289)\n- `ContextVar.reset()` now works correctly inside `inlineCallbacks` functions and coroutines. (#10301)\n- Implement twisted.python.failure._Code.co_positions for compatibility with Python 3.11.

(#10286)\n- twisted.conch.ssh.SSHSession.request_env no longer gives a warning if the session does not implement ISessionSetEnv. (#10347)\n- The cftp command line (and `twisted.conch.scripts.cftp.SSHSession.extReceived`) no longer raises an unhandled error when receiving data on stderr from the server. (#10351)\n\n\nMisc\n~~~~\n\n- #10330\n\n\nWeb\n---\n\nFeatures\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.web.template.renderElement now combines consecutive, sychronously-available bytes up to a fixed size limit into a single string to pass to ``IRequest.write`` instead of passing them all separately.

(#10182)\n\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.web.http had several several defects in HTTP request parsing that could permit HTTP request smuggling. It now disallows signed Content-Length headers, forbids illegal characters in chunked extensions, forbids a ``0x`` prefix to chunk lengths, and only strips spaces and horizontal tab characters from header values. These changes address CVE-2022-24801 and GHSA-c2jg-hw38-jrqq. (#10323)\n\n\nMail\n----\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.mail.pop3.APOPCredentials is now correctly marked as implementing twisted.cred.credentials.IUsernamHashedPassword, rather than IUsernamePassword.

(#10139)\n- twisted.web.http_headers.getRawHeaders and twisted.web.http_headers.getAllRawHeaders are now typed to return immutable sequences of header values instead of lists.\n  twisted.web.http_headers.getRawHeaders is now typed to return a non-optional value if a non-None default value is given. (#10142)\n- Fixed type hint for addr argument to twisted.internet.interfaces.buildProtocol. (#10147)\n- twisted.trial._dist.worker.LocalWorker.connectionMade now always writes the\n  log file using UTF-8 encoding.\n  In previous versions it was using the system default encoding.\n  This was causing encoding errors as the distributed trial workers are sending\n  Unicode data and the system default encoding might not always be Unicode compatible.\n  For example, it can be CP1252 on Windows. (#10157)\n- twisted.words.protocols.irc.ctcpExtract was updated to work with PYPY 3.7.4.

(#10136)\n- The server-side HTTP/1.1 chunking implementation now rejects invalid chunk boundaries, preventing unbounded buffering. (#10137)\n- The server-side HTTP/1.1 chunking implementation now limits the length of the chunk size line (which includes chunk extensions) to twisted.web.http.maxChunkSizeLineLength — 1 KiB — so that it may not consume an unbounded amount of memory.

Also, due to\n  session-related bugs, it defaults to False. (#9583)\n- twisted.internet.defer.inlineCallbacks and ensureDeferred will now associate a contextvars.Context with the coroutines they run, meaning that ContextVar objects will maintain their value within the same coroutine, similarly to asyncio Tasks. This functionality requires Python 3.7+, or the contextvars PyPI backport to be installed for Python 3.5-3.6. (#9719, #9826)\n- twisted.internet.defer.Deferred.fromCoroutine has been added. This is similar to the existing ensureDeferred function, but is named more consistently inside Twisted and does not pass through Deferreds. (#9825)\n- trial now allows the @unittest.skipIf decorator to specify that an entire test class should be skipped. (#9829)\n- The twisted.python.deprecate.deprecatedKeywordParameter decorator can be used to mark a keyword paramater of a function or method as deprecated. (#9844)\n- Projects using Twisted can now perform type checking against a Twisted\n  installation, for example using mypy. (#9908)\n- twisted.python.util.InsensitiveDict now fully implements MutableMapping. (#9919)\n- Python 3.8 is now tested and supported. (#9955)\n- Support a coroutine function in twisted.internet.task.react (#9974)\n- PyPy 3.7 is now tested and supported. (#10093)\n\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n\n- twisted.web.twcgi.CGIProcessProtocol.processEnded(...) now handles an already-finished request, for example when request.connectionLost(...) was called previously. (#9468)\n- Twisted's dependency on PyHamcrest has been moved from the base package to the new \"test\" extra. Consequently the test extra must be installed for Twisted's test suite to pass. (#9509)\n- Fixed serialization of timedelta, date, and time objects in twisted.spread. (#9716)\n- twisted.internet.asyncioreactor.AsyncioSelectorReactor now raises an exception if instantiated with an event loop which is not compatible with asyncio.SelectorEventLoop. This fixes the AsyncioSelectorReactor in Python 3.8+ on Windows, where in bp-34687 the default Windows asyncio event loop was changed to ProactorEventLoop.  Applications that use AsyncioSelectorReactor on Windows with Python 3.8+ must call asyncio.set_event_loop_policy(asyncio.WindowsSelectorEventLoopPolicy()) before instantiating and running AsyncioSelectorReactor. (#9766)\n- twisted.internet.process.registerReapProcessHandler and ._BaseProcess.reapProcess will no longer raise a TypeError when processing a None PID (#9775)\n- INotify will close its file descriptor if a directory is automatically removed by twisted from the watchlist because it's deleted, avoiding orphaned filedescriptors. (#9777)\n- DelayedCall.reset() is now working properly with asyncioreactor (#9780)\n- AsyncioSelectorReactor.seconds() now correctly returns an epoch time. (#9787)\n- The _connDone parameter has been removed from twisted.internet.abstract.FileDescriptor.loseConnection()'s signature in order to match the signature in the base class twisted.internet._newtls.ConnectionMixin loseConnection(). (#9849)\n- The Gtk3 reactor now runs on Wayland-only sessions (#9904)\n- Descriptive error messages from twisted.internet.error are now present when running with 'python -OO'. (#9918)\n- Comparator methods such as __eq__() now always return NotImplemented for uncomparable types. (#9919)\n- When installing Twisted it now requires a minimum Python 3.5.4 version to match the version used with automated testing. This is the minimum Python version that we know that Twisted works with. (#10098)\n\n\nImproved Documentation\n----------------------\n\n- The narrative docs now contains the associated Twisted version and the date\n  when they were generated. (#3945)\n- The \"Writing a twistd plugin\" howto now explains how to deploy twistd plugins using Python packaging and pip (#9243)\n-  (#9868, #9873, #9874)\n- Fix a typo in \"Introduction to Deferreds\" document. (#9948)\n- The Twisted Coding Standard has been changed to refer to The Black code style for guidelines regarding whitespace and line lengths. (#9957)\n- Exempt ``__repr__``, ``__slots__`` and other ``@attrs.define`` related changes from compatibility policy. (#9982)\n- Fix many docstring mistakes flagged by new sanity checks in pydoctor. (#10021)\n- Fix a few dozen broken links to API documentation pages. (#10057)\n\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n\n- twisted.cred.credentials.UsernameHashedPassword is now deprecated because it doesn't hash the password, causing it to return the wrong result. (#8368)\n- twisted.news is now removed from the codebase. (This module was never installed on Python 3.) (#9782)\n- Support for Python 2.7 has been removed. Twisted now supports only Python versions 3.5/3.6/3.7. (#9790)\n- twisted.pair.ethernet.IEthernetProtocol.addProto()'s interface was changed to match the existing implementations in the Twisted source code. (#9877)\n- twisted.python.filepath.FilePath.statinfo was deprecated in Twisted 15.0.0 and has now been removed. (#9881)\n- The parameters to twisted.internet.base.ReactorBase.addSystemEventTrigger(), twisted.internet.base.ReactorBase.callWhenRunning(), twisted.internet.base.ReactorBase.callLater(), twisted.internet.task.Clock.callLater() have been renamed to match the parameters defined in the following interfaces: twisted.internet.interfaces.IReactorCore, twisted.internet.interfaces.IReactorTime. (#9897)\n- Functions and types in twisted.python.compat that existed to support the transition from Python 2 to 3 have been deprecated. (#9922)\n- twisted.logger.LoggingFile.softspace has been deprecated. (#10042)\n- twisted.python.win32.WindowsError and FakeWindowsError have been deprecated.

(#4632)\n- twisted.application.internet.ClientService now accepts a function to initialize or validate a connection before it is returned by the whenConnected method as the prepareConnection argument. (#8375)\n- Traceback generated for twisted.internet.defer.inlineCallbacks now includes the full stack of inlineCallbacks generators between catcher and raiser (before it only contained raiser's stack). (#9176)\n- Add optional cwd argument to twisted.runner.procmon.ProcMon.addProcess (#9287)\n- twisted.python.failure.Failure tracebacks generated by coroutines scheduled with twisted.internet.defer.ensureDeferred - i.e. any Deferred-awaiting coroutine - now contain fewer extraneous frames from the trampoline implementation, and correctly indicate the source of exceptions raised in other call stacks - i.e. the function that raised the exception.  In other words: if you 'await' a function that raises an exception, you'll be able to see where the error came from. (#9459)\n\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n\n- On UNIX-like platforms, Twisted attempts to recover from EMFILE when accepting connections on TCP and UNIX ports by shedding incoming clients. (#5368)\n- The documentation of IReactorTime.getDelayedCalls() has been corrected to indicate that the method returns a list, not a tuple. (#9418)\n- \"python -m twisted web --help\" now refers to \"--listen\" instead of the non-existing \"--http\" (#9434)\n- twisted.python.htmlizer.TokenPrinter now explicitly works on bytestrings.

(#9442)\n\n\nWeb\n---\n\nFeatures\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- Added support for SameSite cookies in ``http.Request.addCookie``. (#9387)\n\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.web.server.GzipEncoderFactory would sometimes fail to gzip requests if the Accept-Encoding header contained whitespace between the comma-separated acceptable encodings.

The --listen argument can be given multiple times to listen on\n  multiple ports. (#6670)\n- Twisted now requires zope.interface 4.4.2 or higher across all platforms and\n  Python versions. (#8149)\n- The osx_platform setuptools extra has been renamed to macos_platform, with\n  the former name being a compatibility alias. (#8848)\n- Zsh completions are now provided for the twist command. (#9338)\n- twisted.internet.endpoints.HostnameEndpoint now has a __repr__ method which\n  includes the host and port to which the endpoint connects. (#9341)\n\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n\n- twistd now uses the UID's default GID to initialize groups when --uid is\n  given but --gid is not. This prevents an unhandled TypeError from being\n  raised when os.initgroups() is called. (#4442)\n- twisted.protocols.basic.LineReceiver checks received lines' lengths against\n  its MAX_LENGTH only after receiving a complete delimiter. A line ending in a\n  multi-byte delimiter like '\\r\\n' might be split by the network, with the\n  first part arriving before the rest; previously, LineReceiver erroneously\n  disconnected if the first part, e.g. 'zzzz....\\r' exceeded MAX_LENGTH.\n  LineReceiver now checks received data against MAX_LENGTH plus the delimiter's\n  length, allowing short reads to complete a line. (#6556)\n- twisted.protocols.basic.LineOnlyReceiver disconnects the transport after\n  receiving a line that exceeds MAX_LENGTH, like LineReceiver. (#6557)\n- twisted.web.http.Request.getClientIP now returns the host part of the\n  client's address when connected over IPv6. (#7704)\n- twisted.application.service.IService is now documented as requiring the\n  'running', 'name' and 'parent' attributes (the documentation previously\n  implied they were required, but was unclear). (#7922)\n- twisted.web.wsgi.WSGIResource no longer raises an exception when a client\n  connects over IPv6. (#8241)\n- When using TLS enable automatic ECDH curve selection on OpenSSL 1.0.2+\n  instead of only supporting P-256 (#9210)\n- twisted.trial._dist.worker and twisted.trial._dist.workertrial consistently\n  pass bytes, not unicode to AMP. This fixes \"trial -j\" on Python 3. (#9264)\n- twisted.trial.runner now uses the 'importlib' module instead of the 'imp'\n  module on Python 3+. This eliminates DeprecationWarnings caused by importing\n  'imp' on Python 3. (#9275)\n- twisted.web.client.HTTP11ClientProtocol now closes the connection when the\n  server is sending a header line which is longer than he line limit of\n  twisted.protocols.basic.LineReceiver.MAX_LENGTH. (#9295)\n- twisted.python.failure now handles long stacktraces better; in particular it\n  will log tracebacks for stack overflow errors. (#9301)\n- The \"--_shell-completion\" argument to twistd now works on Python 3. (#9303)\n- twisted.python.failure.Failure now raises the wrapped exception in Python3,\n  and self (Failure) n Python2 when trap() is called without a matching\n  exception (#9307)\n- Writing large amounts of data no longer implies repeated, expensive copying\n  under Python 3. Python 3's write speeds are now as fast as Python 2's.\n  (#9324)\n- twisted.protocols.postfix now properly encodes errors which are unicode\n  strings to bytes. (#9335)\n- twisted.protocols.policies.ProtocolWrapper and\n  twisted.protocols.tls.TLSMemoryBIOProtocol no longer create circular\n  references that keep protocol instances in memory after connection is closed.\n  (#9374)\n- twisted.conch.ssh.transport.SSHTransportBase no longer strips trailing spaces\n  from the SSH version string of the connected peer. (#9377)\n- `trial -j` no longer crashes on Python 2 on test failure messages containing\n  non-ASCII bytes. (#9378)\n- RSA keys replaced with 2048bit ones in twisted.conch.test.keydata in order to\n  be compatible with OpenSSH 7.6. (#9388)\n- AsyncioSelectorReactor uses the global policy's event loop. asyncio libraries\n  that retrieve the running event loop with get_event_loop() will now receive\n  the one used by AsyncioSelectorReactor. (#9390)\n\n\nImproved Documentation\n----------------------\n\n- public attributes of `twisted.logger.Logger` are now documented as\n  attributes. (#8157)\n- List indentation formatting errors have been corrected throughout the\n  documentation. (#9256)\n\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n\n- twisted.protocols.basic.LineOnlyReceiver.lineLengthExceeded no longer returns\n  twisted.internet.error.ConnectionLost. It instead directly disconnects the\n  transport and returns None. (#6557)\n- twisted.python.win32.getProgramsMenuPath and\n  twisted.python.win32.getProgramFilesPath were deprecated in Twisted 15.3.0\n  and have now been removed.

In addition, passwords which are encrypted with\n  SHA512 and SH256 are properly verified. This fixes running a conch server\n  with: \"twistd -n conch -d /etc/ssh/ --auth=unix\". (#9130)\n- In twisted.conch.scripts.conch, on Python 3 do not write bytes directly to\n  sys.stderr. On Python 3, this fixes remote SSH execution of a command which\n  fails. (#9344)\n\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.conch.ssh.filetransfer.FileTransferClient.wasAFile attribute has been\n  removed as it serves no purpose.

(#5739)\n- twisted.web.server.Request and any Twisted web server using it now support\n  automatic fast responses to HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 OPTIONS * requests, and\n  reject any other verb using the * URL form. (#9190)\n- --add-header \"HeaderName: Value\" can be passed to twist web in order to set\n  extra headers on all responses (#9241)\n\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.web.client.HTTPClientFactory(...).gotHeaders(...) now handles a wrong\n  Set-Cookie header without a traceback. (#9136)\n- twisted.python.web.http.HTTPFactory now always opens logFile in binary mode\n  and writes access logs in UTF-8, to avoid encoding issues and newline\n  differences on Windows. (#9143)\n- The code examples in \"Using the Twisted Web Client\" now work on Python 3.\n  (#9172)\n- twisted.web.server.Request and all web servers that use it now no longer send\n  a default Content-Type header on responses that do not have a body (i.e. that\n  set Content-Length: 0 or that send a 204 status code). (#9191)\n- twisted.web.http.Request and all subclasses now correctly fire Deferreds\n  returned from notifyFinish with errbacks when errors are encountered in\n  HTTP/2 streams. (#9208)\n- twisted.web.microdom, twisted.web.domhelpers, and twisted.web.sux now work on\n  Python 3. (#9222)\n\n\nMail\n----\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- Sending a list of recipients with twisted.smtp.SenderFactory has been fixed.\n  This fixes a problem found when running buildbot. (#9180)\n- twisted.mail.imap4.IMAP4Server parses empty string literals even when they\n  are the last argument to a command, such as LOGIN. (#9207)\n\n\nWords\n-----\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.words.tap has been ported to Python 3 (#9169)\n\n\nMisc\n~~~~\n\n- #9246\n\n\nNames\n-----\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- Queries for unknown record types no longer incorrectly result in a server\n  error. (#9095)\n- Failed TCP connections for AFXR queries no longer raise an AttributeError.\n  (#9174)\n\n\nTwisted 17.5.0 (2017-06-04)\n===========================\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n\n- spawnProcess no longer opens an unwanted console on Windows (#5726)\n- The transition to the hyperlink package adds IPv6 support to\n  twisted.python.url.URL. This is now deprecated and new code should use\n  hyperlink directly (see #9126). (#8069)\n- twisted.logger now buffers only 200 events by default (reduced from 65536)\n  while waiting for observers to be configured. (#8164)\n- The transition of twisted.python.url to using the hyperlink package enables a\n  URL.click() with no arguments (or 0-length string argument) to resolve dot\n  segments in the path. (#8184)\n- twisted.protocols.finger now works on Python 3. (#8230)\n- TLS-related tests now pass when run with OpenSSL 1.1.0. This makes tests pass\n  again on macOS and Windows, as cryptography 1.8 and later include OpenSSL\n  1.1.0. (#8898)\n- UNIX socket endpoints now process all messages from recvmsg's ancillary data\n  via twisted.internet.unix.Server.doRead/twisted.internet.unix.Client.doRead,\n  while discarding and logging ones that don't contain file descriptors.\n  (#8912)\n- twisted.internet.endpoints.HostnameEndpoint and twisted.web.client.Agent work\n  again with reactors that do not provide IReactorPluggableNameResolver. This\n  undoes the changes that broke downstream users such as treq.testing. Note\n  that passing reactors that do not provide IReactorPluggableNameResolver to\n  either is deprecated. (#9032)\n- A Python 3 Perspective Broker server which receives a remote call with\n  keyword arguments from a Python 2 client will now decode any keys which are\n  binary to strings instead of crashing. This fixes interoperability between\n  Python 2 Buildbot clients and Python 3 Buildbot servers. (#9047)\n- twisted.internet._threadedselect now works on both Python 2 and 3. (#9053)\n- twisted.internet.interfaces.IResolverSimple implementers will now always be\n  passed bytes, properly IDNA encoded if required, on Python 2. On Python 3,\n  they will now be passed correctly IDNA-encoded Unicode forms of the domain,\n  taking advantage of the idna library from PyPI if possible. This is to avoid\n  Python's standard library (which has an out of date idna module) from mis-\n  encoding domain names when non-ASCII Unicode is passed to it. (#9137)\n\n\nImproved Documentation\n----------------------\n\n- The examples in Twisted howto \"Using the Twisted Application Framework\",\n  section \"Customizing twistd logging\" have been updated to use latest logging\n  modules and syntax (#9084)\n\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- twisted.internet.defer.Deferred.asFuture and\n  twisted.internet.defer.Deferred.fromFuture were added, allowing for easy\n  transitions between asyncio coroutines (which await Futures) and twisted\n  coroutines (which await Deferreds). (#8748)\n- twisted.application.internet.ClientService.whenConnected now accepts an\n  argument \"failAfterFailures\". If you set this to 1, the Deferred returned by\n  whenConnected will errback when the connection attempt fails, rather than\n  retrying forever. This lets you react (probably by stopping the\n  ClientService) to connection errors that are likely to be persistent, such as\n  using the wrong hostname, or not being connected to the internet at all.\n  (#9116)\n- twisted.protocols.tls.TLSMemoryBIOProtocol and anything that uses it\n  indirectly including the TLS client and server endpoints now enables TLS 1.3\n  cipher suites. (#9128)\n\n\nMisc\n----\n\n- #8133, #8995, #8997, #9003, #9015, #9021, #9026, #9027, #9049, #9057, #9062,\n  #9065, #9069, #9070, #9072, #9074, #9075, #9111, #9117, #9140, #9144, #9145\n\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n\n- twisted.runner.inetdconf.InvalidRPCServicesConfError,\n  twisted.runner.inetdconf.RPCServicesConf, twisted.runner.inetdtap.RPCServer,\n  and twisted.runner.portmap, deprecated since 16.2.0, have been removed.\n  (#8464)\n- twisted.python.url and twisted.python._url were modified to rely on\n  hyperlink, a new package based on the Twisted URL implementation. Hyperlink\n  adds support for IPv6 (fixing #8069), correct username/password encoding,\n  better scheme/netloc inference, improved URL.click() behavior (fixing #8184),\n  and more. For full docs see hyperlink.readthedocs.io and the CHANGELOG in the\n  hyperlink GitHub repo. (#9126)\n\n\nConch\n-----\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- History-aware terminal protocols like twisted.conch.manhole.Manhole no longer\n  raise a TypeError when a user visits a partial line they added to the command\n  line history by pressing up arrow before return. (#9031)\n- The telnet_echo.tac example had conflicting port callouts between runtime and\n  documentation. File was altered to run on documented port, 6023. (#9055)\n\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Remove diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 from twisted.conch. See https://weakdh.org/\n  (#9019)\n- Removed small and obscure elliptic curves from conch. The only curves conch\n  supports now are the ones also supported by OpenSSH. (#9088)\n\n\nMail\n----\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.mail.smtp has been ported to Python 3. (#8770)\n\n\nNames\n-----\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- RRHeader now converts its ttl argument to an integer, raising a TypeError if\n  it cannot. (#8340)\n\n\nWeb\n---\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.web.cgi now works on Python 3 (#8009)\n- twisted.web.distrib now works on Python 3 (#8010)\n- twisted.web.http.HTTPFactory now propagates its reactor's callLater method to\n  the HTTPChannel object, rather than having callLater grab the global reactor.\n  This prevents the possibility of HTTPFactory logging using one reactor, but\n  HTTPChannel running timeouts on another. (#8904)\n\n\nImproved Documentation\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.web.template.flattenString docstring now correctly references\n  io.BytesIO (rather than NativeStringIO). (#9028)\n\n\nFeatures\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.web.client now exposes the RequestGenerationFailed exception type.\n  (#5310)\n- twisted.web.client.Agent will now parse responses that begin with a status\n  line that is missing a phrase. (#7673)\n- twisted.web.http.HTTPChannel and twisted.web._http2.H2Connection have been\n  enhanced so that after they time out they wait a small amount of time to\n  allow the connection to close gracefully and, if it does not, they forcibly\n  close it to avoid allowing malicious clients to forcibly keep the connection\n  open. (#8902)\n\n\nMisc\n~~~~\n\n- #8981, #9018, #9067, #9090, #9092, #9093, #9096\n\n\nWords\n-----\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- twisted.words.protocols.oscar, which is client code for Oscar/ICQ, was\n  deprecated in 16.2.0 and has now been removed. (#9024)\n\n\nTwisted Core 17.1.0 (2017-02-04)\n================================\n\nFeatures\n--------\n - Added a new interface,\n   twisted.internet.interfaces.IHostnameResolver, which is an\n   improvement to twisted.internet.interfaces.IResolverSimple that\n   supports resolving multiple addresses as well as resolving IPv6\n   addresses.  This is a native, asynchronous, Twisted analogue to\n   getaddrinfo. (#4362)\n - twisted.web.client.Agent now uses HostnameEndpoint internally; as a\n   consequence, it now supports IPv6, as well as making connections\n   faster and more reliably to hosts that have more than one DNS name.\n   (#6712)\n - twisted.internet.ssl.CertificateOptions now has the new constructor\n   argument 'raiseMinimumTo', allowing you to increase the minimum TLS\n   version to this version or Twisted's default, whichever is higher.\n   The additional new constructor arguments 'lowerMaximumSecurityTo'\n   and 'insecurelyLowerMinimumTo' allow finer grained control over\n   negotiated versions that don't honour Twisted's defaults, for\n   working around broken peers, at the cost of reducing the security\n   of the TLS it will negotiate. (#6800)\n - twisted.internet.ssl.CertificateOptions now sets the OpenSSL\n   context's mode to MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS, which will free the\n   read/write buffers on idle TLS connections to save memory. (#8247)\n - trial --help-reactors will only list reactors which can be\n   imported.  (#8745)\n - twisted.internet.endpoints.HostnameEndpoint now uses the passed\n   reactor's implementation of\n   twisted.internet.interfaces.IReactorPluggableResolver to resolve\n   hostnames rather than its own deferToThread/getaddrinfo wrapper;\n   this makes its hostname resolution pluggable via a public API.\n   (#8922)\n - twisted.internet.reactor.spawnProcess now does not emit a\n   deprecation warning on Unicode arguments. It will encode Unicode\n   arguments down to bytes using the filesystem encoding on UNIX and\n   Python 2 on Windows, and pass Unicode through unchanged on Python 3\n   on Windows. (#8941)\n - twisted.trial._dist.test.test_distreporter now works on Python 3.\n   (#8943)\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n - trial --help-reactors will now display iocp and win32er reactors\n   with Python 3. (#8745)\n - twisted.logger._flatten.flattenEvent now handles log_format being\n   None instead of assuming the value is always a string. (#8860)\n - twisted.protocol.ftp is now Python 3 compatible (#8865)\n - twisted.names.client.Resolver can now resolve names with IPv6 DNS\n   servers. (#8877)\n - twisted.application.internet.ClientService now waits for existing\n   connections to disconnect before trying to connect again when\n   restarting. (#8899)\n - twisted.internet.unix.Server.doRead and\n   twisted.internet.unix.Client.doRead no longer fail if recvmsg's\n   ancillary data contains more than one file descriptor. (#8911)\n - twist on Python 3 now correctly prints the help text when given no\n   plugin to run. (#8918)\n - twisted.python.sendmsg.sendmsg no longer segfaults on Linux +\n   Python 2. (#8969)\n - IHandshakeListener providers connected via SSL4ClientEndpoint will\n   now have their handshakeCompleted methods called. (#8973)\n - The twist script now respects the --reactor option. (#8983)\n - Fix crash when using SynchronousTestCase with Warning object which\n   does not store a string as its first argument (like\n   libmysqlclient). (#9005)\n - twisted.python.compat.execfile() does not open files with the\n   deprecated 'U' flag on Python 3. (#9012)\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n - twisted.internet.ssl.CertificateOption's 'method' constructor\n   argument is now deprecated, in favour of the new 'raiseMinimumTo',\n   'lowerMaximumSecurityTo', and 'insecurelyLowerMinimumTo' arguments.\n   (#6800)\n - twisted.protocols.telnet (not to be confused with the supported\n   twisted.conch.telnet), deprecated since Twisted 2.5, has been\n   removed. (#8925)\n - twisted.application.strports.parse, as well as the deprecated\n   default arguments in strports.service/listen, deprecated since\n   Twisted 10.2, has been removed. (#8926)\n - twisted.web.client.getPage and twisted.web.client.downloadPage have\n   been deprecated in favour of https://pypi.org/project/treq and\n   twisted.web.client.Agent. (#8960)\n - twisted.internet.defer.timeout is deprecated in favor of\n   twisted.internet.defer.Deferred.addTimeout (#8971)\n\nOther\n-----\n - #7879, #8583, #8764, #8809, #8859, #8906, #8910, #8913, #8916,\n   #8934, #8945, #8949, #8950, #8952, #8953, #8959, #8962, #8963,\n   #8967, #8975, #8976, #8993, #9013\n\n\nTwisted Conch 17.1.0 (2017-02-04)\n=================================\n\nFeatures\n--------\n - twisted.conch.manhole now works on Python 3. (#8327)\n - Twisted Conch now supports ECDH key exchanges. (#8730)\n - Add support in twisted.conch.ssh for hmac-sha2-384 (#8784)\n - conch and cftp scripts now work on Python 3. (#8791)\n - twisted.conch.ssh supports ECDH key exchange. (#8811)\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n - twisted.conch.ssh.keys.Key.fromString now supports OpenSSL private\n   keys with Windows line endings (\\r\\n) again (broken since 16.6.0).\n   (#8928)\n\nImproved Documentation\n----------------------\n - The documentation for\n   twisted.conch.endpoints.SSHCommandClientEndpoint.existingConnection\n   now describes where the value for the connection parameter might\n   come from. (#8892)\n\nOther\n-----\n - #8890, #8894, #8957, #8958, #8968\n\n\nTwisted Mail 17.1.0 (2017-02-04)\n================================\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n - twisted.mail.tap (the twist plugin for mail) no longer accepts the\n   --pop3s option or implicit port numbers to --pop3 and --smtp. This\n   functionality has been deprecated since 11.0. (#8920)\n\n\nTwisted Names 17.1.0 (2017-02-04)\n=================================\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n - twisted.names.authority.BindAuthority has been ported to Python 3.\n   (#8880)\n\n\nTwisted News 17.1.0 (2017-02-04)\n================================\n\nNo significant changes have been made for this release.\n\n\nTwisted Pair 17.1.0 (2017-02-04)\n================================\n\nNo significant changes have been made for this release.\n\n\nTwisted Runner 17.1.0 (2017-02-04)\n==================================\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n - On Python 3, procmon now handles process output without exceptions\n   (#8919)\n\n\nTwisted Web 17.1.0 (2017-02-04)\n===============================\n\nFeatures\n--------\n - twisted.web.client.Agent now sets ``Content-Length: 0`` for PUT and\n   POST requests made without a body producer. (#8984)\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n - twisted.web.http.HTTPFactory now times connections out after one\n   minute of no data from the client being received, before the\n   request is complete, rather than twelve hours. (#3746)\n - twisted.web.http.HTTPChannel, the server class for Twisted's\n   HTTP/1.1 server, now exerts backpressure against clients that do\n   not read responses. This means that if a client stops reading from\n   a socket for long enough, Twisted will stop reading further\n   requests from that client until it consumes some responses. (#8868)\n - twisted.web.http_headers.Headers.getRawHeaders no longer attempts\n   to decode the default value when called with a unicode header name.\n   (#8974)\n - twisted.web.http.HTTPChannel is less likely to leak file\n   descriptors when timing out clients using HTTPS connections. In\n   some cases it is still possible to leak a file descriptor when\n   timing out HTTP clients: further patches will address this issue.\n   (#8992)\n\nOther\n-----\n - #7744, #8909, #8935\n\n\nTwisted Words 17.1.0 (2017-02-04)\n=================================\n\nNo significant changes have been made for this release.\n\n\nTwisted Core 16.6.0 (2016-11-17)\n================================\n\nFeatures\n--------\n - The twist script can now be run by invoking python -m twisted.\n   (#8657)\n - twisted.protocols.sip has been ported to Python 3. (#8669)\n - twisted.persisted.dirdbm has been ported to Python 3. (#8888)\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n - twisted.internet.defer.Deferred now implements send, not __send__,\n   which means that it is now a conforming generator. (#8861)\n - The IOCP reactor no longer transmits the contents of uninitialized\n   memory when writing large amounts of data. (#8870)\n - Deferreds awaited/yielded from in a\n   twisted.internet.defer.ensureDeferred wrapped coroutine will now\n   properly raise exceptions. Additionally, it more closely models\n   asyncio.ensure_future and will pass through Deferreds. (#8878)\n - Deferreds that are paused or chained on other Deferreds will now\n   return a result when yielded/awaited in a twisted.internet.defer\n   .ensureDeferred-wrapped coroutine, instead of returning the\n   Deferred it was chained to. (#8890)\n\nImproved Documentation\n----------------------\n - twisted.test.proto_helpers is now explicitly covered by the\n   compatibility policy. (#8857)\n\nOther\n-----\n - #8281, #8823, #8862\n\n\nTwisted Conch 16.6.0 (2016-11-17)\n=================================\n\nFeatures\n--------\n - twisted.conch.ssh.keys supports ECDSA keys (#8798)\n - scripts/ckeygen can now generate ecdsa keys. (#8828)\n - ckeygen has been ported to Python 3 (#8855)\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n - twisted.conch.ssh no longer uses gmpy, if available. gmpy is\n   unmaintained, does not have binary wheels for any platforms, and an\n   alternative for higher performance is available in the form of\n   PyPy. (#8079)\n\n\nTwisted Mail 16.6.0 (2016-11-17)\n================================\n\nNo significant changes have been made for this release.\n\n\nTwisted Names 16.6.0 (2016-11-17)\n=================================\n\nNo significant changes have been made for this release.\n\n\nTwisted News 16.6.0 (2016-11-17)\n================================\n\nNo significant changes have been made for this release.\n\n\nTwisted Pair 16.6.0 (2016-11-17)\n================================\n\nNo significant changes have been made for this release.\n\n\nTwisted Runner 16.6.0 (2016-11-17)\n==================================\n\nNo significant changes have been made for this release.\n\n\nTwisted Web 16.6.0 (2016-11-17)\n===============================\n\nFeatures\n--------\n - twisted.web.server.Site's HTTP/2 server support now emits vastly\n   fewer WINDOW_UPDATE frames than previously. (#8681)\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n - twisted.web.Agent now tolerates receiving unexpected status codes\n   in the 100 range by discarding them, which is what RFC 7231\n   recommends doing. (#8885)\n - twisted.web._http.H2Stream's getHost and getPeer implementations\n   now actually return the host and peer instead of None. (#8893)\n\n\nTwisted Words 16.6.0 (2016-11-17)\n=================================\n\nFeatures\n--------\n - twisted.words.protocols.irc has been ported to Python 3 (#6320)\n\n\nTwisted Core 16.5.0 (2016-10-28)\n================================\n\nFeatures\n--------\n - Added twisted.internet.defer.Deferred.addTimeout method to enable\n   timeouts of deferreds. (#5786)\n - Perspective Broker (the twisted.spread package) has been ported to\n   Python 3 (#7598)\n - 'yield from' can now be used on Deferreds inside generators, when\n   the generator is wrapped with\n   twisted.internet.defer.ensureDeferred. (#8087)\n - twisted.internet.asyncioreactor has been added, which is a Twisted\n   reactor on top of Python 3.4+'s native asyncio reactor. It can be\n   selected by passing \"--reactor=asyncio\" to Twisted tools (twistd,\n   Trial, etc) on platforms that support it (Python 3.4+). (#8367)\n - twisted.python.zippath now works on Windows with Python 3. (#8747)\n - twisted.internet.cfreactor is ported to Python 3 and supported on\n   2.7 and 3.5+. (#8838)\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n - twisted.internet.test.test_iocp and twisted.internet.test.test_tcp\n   have been fixed to work under Python 3 with the Windows IOCP\n   reactor (#8631)\n - Arguments to processes on Windows are now passed mbcs-encoded\n   arguments.  This prevents process-related tests from hanging on\n   Windows with Python 3. (#8735)\n - Client and server TLS connections made via the client TLS endpoint\n   and the server SSL endpoint, as well as any other code that uses\n   twisted.internet.ssl.CertificateOptions, no longer accept 3DES-\n   based cipher suites by default, to defend against SWEET32. (#8781)\n - twisted.logger.jsonFileLogObserver no longer emits non-JSON\n   tracebacks into its file; additionally,\n   twisted.logger.formatEventAsClassicLogText now includes traceback\n   information for the log event it formats. (#8858)\n - twisted.python.version now exports a version of Incremental that is\n   16.10.1 or higher, making t.p.v.Version package name comparisons\n   case-insensitive. (#8863)\n - twisted.python.reflect.safe_str encodes unicode as ascii with\n   backslashreplace error handling on Python 2. (#8864)\n\nImproved Documentation\n----------------------\n - The twisted.internet.interfaces.IProtocol.dataReceived() method\n   takes one parameter of type bytes.  This has been clarified in the\n   doc string. (#8763)\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n - twisted.python.constants is deprecated in preference to constantly\n   on PyPI, which is the same code rolled into its own package.\n   (#7351)\n - twisted.python.dist3 has been made private API. (#8761)\n - When the source code is checked out, bin/trial is no longer in the\n   tree.

Add twisted.application.runner API,\n   currently private, which twist is built on. (#5705)\n - The new interface IHandshakeListener that can be implemented by any\n   Protocol provides a callback that is called when the TLS handshake\n   has been completed, allowing Protocols to make decisions about the\n   TLS configuration before application data is sent. (#6024)\n - twisted.python.syslog has been ported to Python 3. (#7957)\n - twisted.internet.defer.ensureDeferred has been added, similar to\n   asyncio's ensure_future. Wrapping a coroutine (the result of a\n   function defined using async def, available only on Python 3.5+)\n   with it allows you to use the \"await\" keyword with Deferreds inside\n   the coroutine, similar to \"yield\" when using inlineCallbacks.\n   (#8088)\n - twisted.internet.inotify have been ported to Python 3 (#8211)\n - twisted.enterprise has been ported to Python 3. The third-party\n   pysqlite2 package has not been ported to Python 3, so any database\n   connector based on pysqlite2 cannot be used. Instead the sqlite3\n   module included with Python 3 should be used. (#8303)\n - Scripts such as cftp, ckeygen, conch, mailmail, pyhtmlizer,\n   tkconch, twistd and trial have been updated to be setuptools\n   console scripts.  (#8491)\n - twisted.pair.raw and twisted.pair.rawudp have been ported to Python\n   3 (#8545)\n - twisted.internet.baseprocess has been ported to Python 3. (#8546)\n - twisted.python.dist has been ported to Python 3 (#8556)\n - twisted.internet.interfaces.IOpenSSLContextFactory has been added,\n   which defines the interface provided both by the old-style\n   twisted.internet.ssl.ContextFactory class and the newer\n   twisted.interface.ssl.CertificateOptions class. This is a precursor\n   to formally deprecating the former class in favour of the latter.\n   (#8597)\n - twisted.python.zipstream has been ported to Python 3 (#8607)\n - Zip file entries returned by ChunkingZipFile.readfile() are now\n   context managers. (#8641)\n - twisted.protocols.socks has been ported to Python 3 (#8665)\n - twisted.spread.banana has been ported to Python 3 (#8667)\n - Trial can now be invoked via \"python -m twisted.trial\".

(#8726)\n - twisted.protocols.dict has been ported to Python 3 (#8732)\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n - pip install -e \".[dev]\" now works on Python 3, but it will not\n   install twistedchecker or pydoctor, which have not yet been ported.\n   (#7807)\n - twistd can now properly daemonize on Linux/Unix when run under\n   Python3 and will not hang indefinitely. (#8155)\n - tox can now be used to run Twisted's tests on Windows (#8578)\n - twisted.python.filepath.setContent() and\n   twisted.python.filepath.moveTo() now work on Windows with Python 3\n   (#8610)\n - twisted.internet.win32eventreactor works on Python 3 in Windows\n   (#8626)\n - The TLS payload buffer size was reduced in\n   twisted.protocols.tls.TLSMemoryBIOProtocol.  This fixes writing of\n   very long strings using the TLSv1_1 method from the OpenSSL\n   library. (#8693)\n - twisted.logger._flatten.flattenEvent() now does not crash if passed\n   a unicode string. (#8699)\n - twisted.application.strports.service (and thus twistd) no longer\n   swallow asynchronous exceptions from IStreamServerEndpoint.listen.\n   (#8710)\n - _twistd_unix now reports the name and encoded message of an\n   exception raised during daemonization on Python 2 and 3. (#8731)\n - twisted.protocols.amp now handles floats on Python 3. Previously,\n   sending a float would raise a ValueError. (#8746)\n\nImproved Documentation\n----------------------\n - Some broken links to xprogramming in the unit test documentation\n   have been fixed. (#8579)\n - The Twisted Tutorial \"The Evolution of Finger\" has been updated to\n   use endpoints throughout. (#8588)\n - Updated the mail examples to use endpoints and better TLS. (#8595)\n - Changed the Twisted Web howto to use endpoints and modern TLS.\n   (#8596)\n - Updated bug report URL in man pages. (#8600)\n - In twisted.internet.udp.Port, write() takes a parameter of type\n   bytes.  This is clarified in the docstring. (#8635)\n - twisted.internet.interfaces.ITransport.write() and\n   twisted.internet.interfaces.ITransport.writeSequence() take bytes\n   parameters. (#8636)\n - twisted.python.filepath.AbstractFilePath.getContent() returns\n   bytes.  The docstring was updated to clarify this. (#8637)\n - Updated release notes to reflect that 15.4 is the last version that\n   supported Python 2.6, not 15.5. (#8651)\n - A missing space in defer.rst resulted in badly rendered output. The\n   space was added. (#8723)\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n - Dropped support for pyOpenSSL versions less than 16.0.0.

(#8191)\n - twisted.web.http.HTTPChannel now has a HTTP/2 implementation which\n   will be used if the transport has negotiated using it through\n   ALPN/NPN (see #8188). (#8194)\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n - twisted.web.client.Agent and twisted.web.client.ProxyAgent now add\n   brackets to IPv6 literal addresses in the host header they send.\n   (#8369)\n - The HTTP server now correctly times connections out. (broken in\n   16.2) (#8481)\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n - twisted.web would previously dispatch pipelined requests\n   simultaneously and queue the responses. This behaviour did not\n   enforce any of the guarantees required by RFC 7230 or make it\n   possible for users to enforce those requirements. For this reason,\n   the parallel dispatch of requests has been removed. Pipelined\n   requests are now processed serially.

(#8235)\n\nBugfixes\n--------\n - twisted.application-using applications (trial, twistd, etc) now\n   work with the --reactor option on Python 3. (#8299)\n - Failures are now logged by STDLibLogObserver. (#8316)\n\nImproved Documentation\n----------------------\n - Deprecation documentation was extended to include a quick check\n   list for developers. (#5645)\n - The Twisted Deprecation Policy is now documented in the Twisted\n   Development Policy. (#8082)\n - The documentation examples for UDP now work on Python 3. (#8280)\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n - Passing a factory that produces log observers that do not implement\n   twisted.logger.ILogObserver or twisted.python.log.ILogObserver to\n   twisted.application.app.AppLogger has been deprecated. This is\n   primarily used by twistd's --logger option. Please use factories\n   that produce log observers implementing twisted.logger.ILogObserver\n   or the legacy twisted.python.log.ILogObserver.

          "content": "# Report a security issue\n\n[//]: # (ATTENTION: This is the .MD version of docs/security.rst. Any changes should also be made in the RST version.)\n\nWe take security very seriously.\nYour input and feedback on our security\nis always appreciated.\n\nYou can send urgent or sensitive reports via [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/twisted/twisted/security/advisories/new).\n\nIf you prefer, you can send via email to <security@twistedmatrix.com>.\nYou may use our PGP public key if you wish. We will create a GitHub\nsecurity advisory to coordinate a fix. Include your GitHub username so\nthat we add you as a collaborator on the advisory. See\n[GHSA-c2jg-hw38-jrqq](https://github.com/twisted/twisted/security/advisories/GHSA-c2jg-hw38-jrqq)\nfor an example. We'll get back to you as soon as we can.\n\nTwisted is an all volunteer project and there may be some delay before\nwe can respond.\n\nFeel free to follow up if you think an unreasonable amount of time has\nelapsed without a response!\n\nAll releases, including security releases, are announced on the mailing\nlist. Consider subscribing to receive notification about the\navailability of a security fix.\n\n# Security Procedure for Developers\n\nThe goal of the normal Twisted development procedure is to make all\nsteps transparent and record all information at all times in a public\nlocation - either the issue tracker or a branch.\n\nThe goal of the security variation of the Twisted development procedure\nis to keep track of progress resolving security issues while minimizing\nthe window of time where information useful to attackers is available\nbefore a fix for the issue is available to Twisted users.\n\nThis process is intended as a helpful recommendation. Elements of it may\nbe followed more or less strictly depending on the severity of the issue\nin question:\n\n1.  Begin by filing a ticket which does not describe the issue and\n    simply says 'security issue, description pending' and has the\n    'security' keyword.\n2.  Create a security advisory in GitHub using the [GitHub\n    UI](https://github.com/twisted/twisted/security/advisories/new).\n    This will trigger the creation of a private repository that can be\n    use for developing a patch. This automatically created private\n    repository is also used to review the PR in private.\n3.  Make the required changes to fix the security issue in the new\n    private repository.\n4.  Create a new PR using the GitHub security advisory UI. This will\n    generate a private PR. Request the review and get the approval for\n    the PR. Don't merge the PR after approval. In the PR description\n    define the desired merge commit message. The PR will be merged by\n    the release manager at the same time with the first release\n    candidate.\n5.  Automated notifications for the private repository and private PR\n    are limited. Try to communicate over IRC, gitter or other means to\n    find a person to review the new PR. Coordinate with the release\n    manager. More info about the release process can be found on the\n    [release process](docs/development/release-process.rst) dedicated page.\n6.  We are not aware of a way to securely transmit our code to our\n    public continuous integration systems. Reviewers should manually run\n    the automated tests on their local forks of the new private\n    repository.\n\nAside from hiding the details of the issue while development is ongoing,\nall of the normal policies apply. Security fixes require unit tests,\ncode review, etc.\n\n## PGP key for email communication\n\nBelow is the PGP key for <security@twistedmatrix.com>:\n\n    -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\n

This document\nlist the sort of things you want to look for when doing this, or when\nwriting your own code.\n\n## Bad input\n\nAny place we receive untrusted data, we need to be careful. In some\ncases we are not careful enough. For example, in HTTP there are many\nplaces where strings need to be converted to ints, so we use `int()` .\nThe problem is that this will accept negative or hexadecimal\n(<span class=\"title-ref\">0x123</span>) numbers as well, whereas the\nprotocol should only accept positive numbers.\n\n## Resource Exhaustion and DoS\n\nMake sure we never allow users to create arbitrarily large strings or\nfiles. Some of the protocols still have issues like this. Place a limit\nwhich allows reasonable use but will cut off huge requests, and allow\nchanging of this limit.\n\nAnother operation to look out for are exceptions. They can fill up logs\nand take a lot of CPU time to render in web pages.\npandoc version 3.1.8"
