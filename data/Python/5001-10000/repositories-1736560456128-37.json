(`#13046 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/13046>`_)\n\n24.3 (2024-10-27)\n=================\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n\n- Deprecate wheel filenames that are not compliant with :pep:`440`. (`#12918 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12918>`_)\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- Detect recursively referencing requirements files and help users identify\n  the source. (`#12653 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12653>`_)\n- Support for :pep:`730` iOS wheels. (`#12961 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12961>`_)\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Display a better error message when an already installed package has an invalid requirement. (`#12953 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12953>`_)\n- Ignore ``PIP_TARGET`` and ``pip.conf`` ``global.target`` when preparing a build environment. (`#8438 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8438>`_)\n- Restore support for macOS 10.12 and older (via truststore). (`#12901 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12901>`_)\n- Allow installing pip in editable mode in a virtual environment on Windows. (`#12666 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12666>`_)\n\nVendored Libraries\n------------------\n\n- Upgrade certifi to 2024.8.30\n- Upgrade distlib to 0.3.9\n- Upgrade truststore to 0.10.0\n- Upgrade urllib3 to 1.26.20\n\n24.2 (2024-07-28)\n=================\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n\n- Deprecate ``pip install --editable`` falling back to ``setup.py develop``\n  when using a setuptools version that does not support :pep:`660`\n  (setuptools v63 and older). (`#11457 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11457>`_)\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- Check unsupported packages for the current platform. (`#11054 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11054>`_)\n- Use system certificates *and* certifi certificates to verify HTTPS connections on Python 3.10+.\n  Python 3.9 and earlier only use certifi.\n\n  To revert to previous behaviour, pass the flag ``--use-deprecated=legacy-certs``. (`#11647 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11647>`_)\n- Improve discovery performance of installed packages when the ``importlib.metadata``\n  backend is used to load distribution metadata (used by default under Python 3.11+). (`#12656 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12656>`_)\n- Improve performance when the same requirement string appears many times during\n  resolution, by consistently caching the parsed requirement string. (`#12663 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12663>`_)\n- Minor performance improvement of finding applicable package candidates by not\n  repeatedly calculating their versions (`#12664 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12664>`_)\n- Disable pip's self version check when invoking a pip subprocess to install\n  PEP 517 build requirements. (`#12683 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12683>`_)\n- Improve dependency resolution performance by caching platform compatibility\n  tags during wheel cache lookup. (`#12712 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12712>`_)\n- ``wheel`` is no longer explicitly listed as a build dependency of ``pip``.\n  ``setuptools`` injects this dependency in the ``get_requires_for_build_wheel()``\n  hook and no longer needs it on newer versions. (`#12728 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12728>`_)\n- Ignore ``--require-virtualenv`` for ``pip check`` and ``pip freeze`` (`#12842 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12842>`_)\n- Improve package download and install performance.\n\n  Increase chunk sizes when downloading (256 kB, up from 10 kB) and reading files (1 MB, up from 8 kB).\n  This reduces the frequency of updates to pip's progress bar. (`#12810 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12810>`_)\n- Improve pip install performance.\n\n  Files are now extracted in 1MB blocks, or in one block matching the file size for\n  smaller files. A decompressor is no longer instantiated when extracting 0 bytes files,\n  it is not necessary because there is no data to decompress. (`#12803 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12803>`_)\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Set ``no_color`` to global ``rich.Console`` instance. (`#11045 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11045>`_)\n- Fix resolution to respect ``--python-version`` when checking ``Requires-Python``. (`#12216 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12216>`_)\n- Perform hash comparisons in a case-insensitive manner. (`#12680 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12680>`_)\n- Avoid ``dlopen`` failure for glibc detection in musl builds (`#12716 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12716>`_)\n- Avoid keyring logging crashes when pip is run in verbose mode. (`#12751 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12751>`_)\n- Fix finding hardlink targets in tar files with an ignored top-level directory. (`#12781 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12781>`_)\n- Improve pip install performance by only creating required parent\n  directories once, instead of before extracting every file in the wheel. (`#12782 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12782>`_)\n- Improve pip install performance by calculating installed packages printout\n  in linear time instead of quadratic time. (`#12791 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12791>`_)\n\nVendored Libraries\n------------------\n\n- Remove vendored tenacity.\n- Update the preload list for the ``DEBUNDLED`` case, to replace ``pep517`` that has been renamed to ``pyproject_hooks``.\n- Use tomllib from the stdlib if available, rather than tomli\n- Upgrade certifi to 2024.7.4\n- Upgrade platformdirs to 4.2.2\n- Upgrade pygments to 2.18.0\n- Upgrade setuptools to 70.3.0\n- Upgrade typing_extensions to 4.12.2\n\nImproved Documentation\n----------------------\n\n- Correct ``—-ignore-conflicts`` (including an em dash) to ``--ignore-conflicts``. (`#12851 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12851>`_)\n\n24.1.2 (2024-07-07)\n===================\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Fix finding hardlink targets in tar files with an ignored top-level directory. (`#12781 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12781>`_)\n\n24.1.1 (2024-06-26)\n===================\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Actually use system trust stores when the truststore feature is enabled.\n\nVendored Libraries\n------------------\n\n- Upgrade requests to 2.32.3\n\n\n24.1 (2024-06-20)\n=================\n\nVendored Libraries\n------------------\n\n- Upgrade truststore to 0.9.1.\n\n\n24.1b2 (2024-06-12)\n===================\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- Report informative messages about invalid requirements. (`#12713 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12713>`_)\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Eagerly import the self version check logic to avoid crashes while upgrading or downgrading pip at the same time. (`#12675 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12675>`_)\n- Accommodate for mismatches between different sources of truth for extra names, for packages generated by ``setuptools``. (`#12688 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12688>`_)\n- Accommodate for development versions of CPython ending in ``+`` in the version string. (`#12691 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12691>`_)\n\nVendored Libraries\n------------------\n\n- Upgrade packaging to 24.1\n- Upgrade requests to 2.32.0\n- Remove vendored colorama\n- Remove vendored six\n- Remove vendored webencodings\n- Remove vendored charset_normalizer\n\n  ``requests`` provides optional character detection support on some APIs when processing ambiguous bytes. This isn't relevant for pip to function and we're able to remove it due to recent upstream changes.\n\n24.1b1 (2024-05-06)\n===================\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n\n- Drop support for EOL Python 3.7. (`#11934 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11934>`_)\n- Remove support for legacy versions and dependency specifiers.\n\n  Packages with non standard-compliant versions or dependency specifiers are now ignored by the resolver.\n  Already installed packages with non standard-compliant versions or dependency specifiers\n  must be uninstalled before upgrading them. (`#12063 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12063>`_)\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- Improve performance of resolution of large dependency trees, with more caching. (`#12453 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12453>`_)\n- Further improve resolution performance of large dependency trees, by caching hash calculations.

(`#11394 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11394>`_)\n- Normalize extras according to :pep:`685` from package metadata in the resolver\n  for comparison. This ensures extras are correctly compared and merged as long\n  as the package providing the extra(s) is built with values normalized according\n  to the standard. Note, however, that this *does not* solve cases where the\n  package itself contains unnormalized extra values in the metadata.

(`#12350 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12350>`_)\n- pip uses less memory when caching large packages. As a result, there is a new on-disk cache format stored in a new directory ($PIP_CACHE_DIR/http-v2).

This only affects the egg *distribution format* (with the ``.egg`` extension); distributions using the ``.egg-info`` *metadata format* (but are not actually eggs) are not affected. For more information about eggs, see `relevant section in the setuptools documentation <https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/stable/deprecated/python_eggs.html>`__.\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n\n- Deprecate legacy version and version specifiers that don't conform to the\n  :ref:`specification <pypug:version-specifiers>`.\n  (`#12063 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12063>`_)\n- ``freeze`` no longer excludes the ``setuptools``, ``distribute``, and ``wheel``\n  from the output when running on Python 3.12 or later, where they are not\n  included in a virtual environment by default. Use ``--exclude`` if you wish to\n  exclude any of these packages. (`#4256 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/4256>`_)\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- make rejection messages slightly different between 1 and 8, so the user can make the difference.

(`#12067 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12067>`_)\n- Fix slowness when using ``importlib.metadata`` (the default way for pip to read metadata in Python 3.11+) and there is a large overlap between already installed and to-be-installed packages. (`#12079 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12079>`_)\n- Pass the ``-r`` flag to mercurial to be explicit that a revision is passed and protect\n  against ``hg`` options injection as part of VCS URLs. Users that do not have control on\n  VCS URLs passed to pip are advised to upgrade.

(`#11358 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11358>`_)\n- ``--no-binary`` does not imply ``setup.py install`` anymore. Instead a wheel will be\n  built locally and installed. (`#11451 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11451>`_)\n- ``--no-binary`` does not disable the cache of locally built wheels anymore. It only\n  means \"don't download wheels\". (`#11453 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11453>`_)\n- Deprecate ``--build-option`` and ``--global-option``. Users are invited to switch to\n  ``--config-settings``. (`#11859 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11859>`_)\n- Using ``--config-settings`` with projects that don't have a ``pyproject.toml`` now prints\n  a deprecation warning. In the future the presence of config settings will automatically\n  enable the default build backend for legacy projects and pass the settings to it. (`#11915 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11915>`_)\n- Remove ``setup.py install`` fallback when building a wheel failed for projects without\n  ``pyproject.toml``. (`#8368 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8368>`_)\n- When the ``wheel`` package is not installed, pip now uses the default build backend\n  instead of ``setup.py install`` and ``setup.py develop`` for project without\n  ``pyproject.toml``. (`#8559 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8559>`_)\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- Specify egg-link location in assertion message when it does not match installed location to provide better error message for debugging. (`#10476 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10476>`_)\n- Present conflict information during installation after each choice that is rejected (pass ``-vv`` to ``pip install`` to show it) (`#10937 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10937>`_)\n- Display dependency chain on each Collecting/Processing log line. (`#11169 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11169>`_)\n- Support a per-requirement ``--config-settings`` option in requirements files. (`#11325 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11325>`_)\n- The ``--config-settings``/``-C`` option now supports using the same key multiple\n  times. When the same key is specified multiple times, all values are passed to\n  the build backend as a list, as opposed to the previous behavior, where pip would\n  only pass the last value if the same key was used multiple times. (`#11681 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11681>`_)\n- Add ``-C`` as a short version of the ``--config-settings`` option. (`#11786 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11786>`_)\n- Reduce the number of resolver rounds, since backjumping makes the resolver more efficient in finding solutions. This also makes pathological cases fail quicker. (`#11908 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11908>`_)\n- Warn if ``--hash`` is used on a line without requirement in a requirements file. (`#11935 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11935>`_)\n- Stop propagating CLI ``--config-settings`` to the build dependencies. They already did\n  not propagate to requirements provided in requirement files. To pass the same config\n  settings to several requirements, users should provide the requirements as CLI\n  arguments. (`#11941 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11941>`_)\n- Support wheel cache when using ``--require-hashes``. (`#5037 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/5037>`_)\n- Add ``--keyring-provider`` flag. See the Authentication page in the documentation for more info. (`#8719 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8719>`_)\n- In the case of virtual environments, configuration files are now also included from the base installation. (`#9752 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9752>`_)\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Fix grammar by changing \"A new release of pip available:\" to \"A new release of pip is available:\" in the notice used for indicating that. (`#11529 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11529>`_)\n- Normalize paths before checking if installed scripts are on PATH. (`#11719 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11719>`_)\n- Correct the way to decide if keyring is available. (`#11774 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11774>`_)\n- More consistent resolution backtracking by removing legacy hack related to setuptools resolution (`#11837 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11837>`_)\n- Include ``AUTHORS.txt`` in pip's wheels. (`#11882 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11882>`_)\n- The ``uninstall`` and ``install --force-reinstall`` commands no longer call\n  ``normalize_path()`` repeatedly on the same paths. Instead, these results are\n  cached for the duration of an uninstall operation, resulting in improved\n  performance, particularly on Windows. (`#11889 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11889>`_)\n- Fix and improve the parsing of hashes embedded in URL fragments. (`#11936 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11936>`_)\n- When package A depends on package B provided as a direct URL dependency including a hash\n  embedded in the link, the ``--require-hashes`` option did not warn when user supplied hashes\n  were missing for package B. (`#11938 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11938>`_)\n- Correctly report ``requested_extras`` in the installation report when extras are\n  specified for a local directory installation. (`#11946 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11946>`_)\n- When installing an archive from a direct URL or local file, populate\n  ``download_info.info.hashes`` in the installation report, in addition to the legacy\n  ``download_info.info.hash`` key.

(`#11312 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11312>`_)\n- Implement logic to read the ``EXTERNALLY-MANAGED`` file as specified in :pep:`668`.\n  This allows a downstream Python distributor to prevent users from using pip to\n  modify the externally managed environment. (`#11381 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11381>`_)\n- Enable the use of ``keyring`` found on ``PATH``. This allows ``keyring``\n  installed using ``pipx`` to be used by ``pip``. (`#11589 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11589>`_)\n- The inspect and installation report formats are now declared stable, and their version\n  has been bumped from ``0`` to ``1``.

(`#11598 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11598>`_)\n- Deprecated a historical ambiguity in how ``egg`` fragments in URL-style\n  requirements are formatted and handled. ``egg`` fragments that do not look\n  like :pep:`508` names now produce a deprecation warning. (`#11617 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11617>`_)\n- Fix scripts path in isolated build environment on Debian. (`#11623 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11623>`_)\n- Make ``pip show`` show the editable location if package is editable (`#11638 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11638>`_)\n- Stop checking that ``wheel`` is present when ``build-system.requires``\n  is provided without ``build-system.build-backend`` as ``setuptools``\n  (which we still check for) will inject it anyway. (`#11673 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11673>`_)\n- Fix an issue when an already existing in-memory distribution would cause\n  exceptions in ``pip install`` (`#11704 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11704>`_)\n\nVendored Libraries\n------------------\n\n- Upgrade certifi to 2022.12.7\n- Upgrade chardet to 5.1.0\n- Upgrade colorama to 0.4.6\n- Upgrade distro to 1.8.0\n- Remove pep517 from vendored packages\n- Upgrade platformdirs to 2.6.2\n- Add pyproject-hooks 1.0.0\n- Upgrade requests to 2.28.2\n- Upgrade rich to 12.6.0\n- Upgrade urllib3 to 1.26.14\n\nImproved Documentation\n----------------------\n\n- Fixed the description of the option \"--install-options\" in the documentation (`#10265 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10265>`_)\n- Remove mention that editable installs are necessary for pip freeze to report the VCS\n  URL. (`#11675 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11675>`_)\n- Clarify that the egg URL fragment is only necessary for editable VCS installs, and\n  otherwise not necessary anymore. (`#11676 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11676>`_)\n\n\n22.3.1 (2022-11-05)\n===================\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Fix entry point generation of ``pip.X``, ``pipX.Y``, and ``easy_install-X.Y``\n  to correctly account for multi-digit Python version segments (e.g. the \"11\"\n  part of 3.11). (`#11547 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11547>`_)\n\n\n22.3 (2022-10-15)\n=================\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n\n- Deprecate ``--install-options`` which forces pip to use the deprecated ``install``\n  command of ``setuptools``. (`#11358 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11358>`_)\n- Deprecate installation with 'setup.py install' when no-binary is enabled for\n  source distributions without 'pyproject.toml'.

(`#9789 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9789>`_)\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- Use ``shell=True`` for opening the editor with ``pip config edit``. (`#10716 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10716>`_)\n- Use the ``data-dist-info-metadata`` attribute from :pep:`658` to resolve distribution metadata without downloading the dist yet. (`#11111 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11111>`_)\n- Add an option to run the test suite with pip built as a zipapp. (`#11250 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11250>`_)\n- Add a ``--python`` option to allow pip to manage Python environments other\n  than the one pip is installed in. (`#11320 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11320>`_)\n- Document the new (experimental) zipapp distribution of pip.

(`#11276 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11276>`_)\n- Ensure that the candidate ``pip`` executable exists, when checking for a new version of pip. (`#11309 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11309>`_)\n- Ignore distributions with invalid ``Name`` in metadata instead of crashing, when\n  using the ``importlib.metadata`` backend. (`#11352 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11352>`_)\n- Raise RequirementsFileParseError when parsing malformed requirements options that can't be successfully parsed by shlex.

(`#11357 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11357>`_)\n\n\n22.2.2 (2022-08-03)\n===================\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Avoid  ``AttributeError`` when removing the setuptools-provided ``_distutils_hack`` and it is missing its implementation. (`#11314 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11314>`_)\n- Fix import error when reinstalling pip in user site. (`#11319 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11319>`_)\n- Show pip deprecation warnings by default. (`#11330 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11330>`_)\n\n\n22.2.1 (2022-07-27)\n===================\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Send the pip upgrade prompt to stderr. (`#11282 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11282>`_)\n- Ensure that things work correctly in environments where setuptools-injected\n  ``distutils`` is available by default. This is done by cooperating with\n  setuptools' injection logic to ensure that pip uses the ``distutils`` from the\n  Python standard library instead. (`#11298 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11298>`_)\n- Clarify that ``pip cache``'s wheels-related output is about locally built wheels only. (`#11300 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11300>`_)\n\n\n22.2 (2022-07-21)\n=================\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n\n- Remove the ``html5lib`` deprecated feature flag. (`#10825 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10825>`_)\n- Remove ``--use-deprecated=backtrack-on-build-failures``. (`#11241 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11241>`_)\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- Add support to use `truststore <https://pypi.org/project/truststore/>`_ as an\n  alternative SSL certificate verification backend. The backend can be enabled on Python\n  3.10 and later by installing ``truststore`` into the environment, and adding the\n  ``--use-feature=truststore`` flag to various pip commands.\n\n  ``truststore`` differs from the current default verification backend (provided by\n  ``certifi``) in it uses the operating system’s trust store, which can be better\n  controlled and augmented to better support non-standard certificates. Depending on\n  feedback, pip may switch to this as the default certificate verification backend in\n  the future. (`#11082 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11082>`_)\n- Add ``--dry-run`` option to ``pip install``, to let it print what it would install but\n  not actually change anything in the target environment. (`#11096 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11096>`_)\n- Record in wheel cache entries the URL of the original artifact that was downloaded\n  to build the cached wheels. The record is named ``origin.json`` and uses the PEP 610\n  Direct URL format. (`#11137 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11137>`_)\n- Support `PEP 691 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0691/>`_. (`#11158 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11158>`_)\n- pip's deprecation warnings now subclass the built-in ``DeprecationWarning``, and\n  can be suppressed by running the Python interpreter with\n  ``-W ignore::DeprecationWarning``. (`#11225 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11225>`_)\n- Add ``pip inspect`` command to obtain the list of installed distributions and other\n  information about the Python environment, in JSON format. (`#11245 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11245>`_)\n- Significantly speed up isolated environment creation, by using the same\n  sources for pip instead of creating a standalone installation for each\n  environment. (`#11257 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11257>`_)\n- Add an experimental ``--report`` option to the install command to generate a JSON report\n  of what was installed. In combination with ``--dry-run`` and ``--ignore-installed`` it\n  can be used to resolve the requirements. (`#53 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/53>`_)\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Fix ``pip install --pre`` for packages with pre-release build dependencies defined\n  both in ``pyproject.toml``'s ``build-system.requires`` and ``setup.py``'s\n  ``setup_requires``. (`#10222 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10222>`_)\n- When pip rewrites the shebang line in a script during wheel installation,\n  update the hash and size in the corresponding ``RECORD`` file entry. (`#10744 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10744>`_)\n- Do not consider a ``.dist-info`` directory found inside a wheel-like zip file\n  as metadata for an installed distribution. A package in a wheel is (by\n  definition) not installed, and is not guaranteed to work due to how a wheel is\n  structured. (`#11217 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11217>`_)\n- Use ``importlib.resources`` to read the ``vendor.txt`` file in ``pip debug``.\n  This makes the command safe for use from a zipapp. (`#11248 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11248>`_)\n- Make the ``--use-pep517`` option of the ``download`` command apply not just\n  to the requirements specified on the command line, but to their dependencies,\n  as well. (`#9523 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9523>`_)\n\nProcess\n-------\n\n- Remove reliance on the stdlib cgi module, which is deprecated in Python 3.11.\n\nVendored Libraries\n------------------\n\n- Remove html5lib.\n- Upgrade certifi to 2022.6.15\n- Upgrade chardet to 5.0.0\n- Upgrade colorama to 0.4.5\n- Upgrade distlib to 0.3.5\n- Upgrade msgpack to 1.0.4\n- Upgrade pygments to 2.12.0\n- Upgrade pyparsing to 3.0.9\n- Upgrade requests to 2.28.1\n- Upgrade rich to 12.5.1\n- Upgrade typing_extensions to 4.3.0\n- Upgrade urllib3 to 1.26.10\n\n\n22.1.2 (2022-05-31)\n===================\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Revert `#10979 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10979>`_ since it introduced a regression in certain edge cases. (`#10979 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10979>`_)\n- Fix an incorrect assertion in the logging logic, that prevented the upgrade prompt from being presented. (`#11136 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11136>`_)\n\n\n22.1.1 (2022-05-20)\n===================\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Properly filter out optional dependencies (i.e. extras) when checking build environment distributions. (`#11112 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11112>`_)\n- Change the build environment dependency checking to be opt-in. (`#11116 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11116>`_)\n- Allow using a pre-release version to satisfy a build requirement. This helps\n  manually populated build environments to more accurately detect build-time\n  requirement conflicts. (`#11123 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11123>`_)\n\n\n22.1 (2022-05-11)\n=================\n\nProcess\n-------\n\n- Enable the ``importlib.metadata`` metadata implementation by default on\n  Python 3.11 (or later). The environment variable ``_PIP_USE_IMPORTLIB_METADATA``\n  can still be used to enable the implementation on 3.10 and earlier, or disable\n  it on 3.11 (by setting it to ``0`` or ``false``).\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Revert `#9243 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9243>`_ since it introduced a regression in certain edge cases. (`#10962 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10962>`_)\n- Fix missing ``REQUESTED`` metadata when using URL constraints. (`#11079 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11079>`_)\n- ``pip config`` now normalizes names by converting underscores into dashes. (`#9330 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9330>`_)\n\n\n22.1b1 (2022-04-30)\n===================\n\nProcess\n-------\n\n- Start migration of distribution metadata implementation from ``pkg_resources``\n  to ``importlib.metadata``. The new implementation is currently not exposed in\n  any user-facing way, but included in the code base for easier development.\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n\n- Drop ``--use-deprecated=out-of-tree-build``, according to deprecation message. (`#11001 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11001>`_)\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- Add option to install and uninstall commands to opt-out from running-as-root warning. (`#10556 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10556>`_)\n- Include Project-URLs in ``pip show`` output. (`#10799 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10799>`_)\n- Improve error message when ``pip config edit`` is provided an editor that\n  doesn't exist. (`#10812 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10812>`_)\n- Add a user interface for supplying config settings to build backends. (`#11059 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11059>`_)\n- Add support for Powershell autocompletion.

(`#10696 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10696>`_)\n- Fallback to pyproject.toml-based builds if ``setup.py`` is present in a project, but ``setuptools`` cannot be imported. (`#10717 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10717>`_)\n- When checking for conflicts in the build environment, correctly skip requirements\n  containing markers that do not match the current environment. (`#10883 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10883>`_)\n- Disable brotli import in vendored urllib3 so brotli could be uninstalled/upgraded by pip. (`#10950 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10950>`_)\n- Prioritize URL credentials over netrc. (`#10979 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10979>`_)\n- Filter available distributions using hash declarations from constraints files.

(`#9691 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9691>`_)\n\nVendored Libraries\n------------------\n\n- Upgrade CacheControl to 0.12.11\n- Upgrade distro to 1.7.0\n- Upgrade platformdirs to 2.5.2\n- Remove ``progress`` from vendored dependencies.\n- Upgrade ``pyparsing`` to 3.0.8 for startup performance improvements.\n- Upgrade rich to 12.2.0\n- Upgrade tomli to 2.0.1\n- Upgrade typing_extensions to 4.2.0\n\nImproved Documentation\n----------------------\n\n- Add more dedicated topic and reference pages to the documentation. (`#10899 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10899>`_)\n- Capitalise Y as the default for \"Proceed (y/n)?\" when uninstalling. (`#10936 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10936>`_)\n- Add ``scheme://`` requirement to ``--proxy`` option's description (`#10951 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10951>`_)\n- The wheel command now references the build interface section instead of stating the legacy\n  setuptools behavior as the default.

(`#10791 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10791>`_)\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Only calculate topological installation order, for packages that are going to be installed/upgraded.\n\n  This fixes an `AssertionError` that occurred when determining installation order, for a very specific combination of upgrading-already-installed-package + change of dependencies + fetching some packages from a package index. This combination was especially common in Read the Docs' builds. (`#10851 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10851>`_)\n- Use ``html.parser`` by default, instead of falling back to ``html5lib`` when ``--use-deprecated=html5lib`` is not passed. (`#10869 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10869>`_)\n\nImproved Documentation\n----------------------\n\n- Clarify that using per-requirement overrides disables the usage of wheels. (`#9674 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9674>`_)\n\n\n22.0.2 (2022-01-30)\n===================\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n\n- Instead of failing on index pages that use non-compliant HTML 5, print a deprecation warning and fall back to ``html5lib``-based parsing for now. This simplifies the migration for non-compliant index pages, by letting such indexes function with a warning. (`#10847 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10847>`_)\n\n\n22.0.1 (2022-01-30)\n===================\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Accept lowercase ``<!doctype html>`` on index pages.

(`#10462 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10462>`_)\n- Drop support for Python 3.6. (`#10641 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10641>`_)\n- Disable location mismatch warnings on Python versions prior to 3.10.\n\n  These warnings were helping identify potential issues as part of the sysconfig -> distutils transition, and we no longer need to rely on reports from older Python versions for information on the transition. (`#10840 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10840>`_)\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- Changed ``PackageFinder`` to parse HTML documents using the stdlib :class:`html.parser.HTMLParser` class instead of the ``html5lib`` package.\n\n  For now, the deprecated ``html5lib`` code remains and can be used with the ``--use-deprecated=html5lib`` command line option. However, it will be removed in a future pip release. (`#10291 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10291>`_)\n- Utilise ``rich`` for presenting pip's default download progress bar. (`#10462 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10462>`_)\n- Present a better error message when an invalid wheel file is encountered, providing more context where the invalid wheel file is. (`#10535 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10535>`_)\n- Documents the ``--require-virtualenv`` flag for ``pip install``. (`#10588 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10588>`_)\n- ``pip install <tab>`` autocompletes paths. (`#10646 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10646>`_)\n- Allow Python distributors to opt-out from or opt-in to the ``sysconfig`` installation scheme backend by setting ``sysconfig._PIP_USE_SYSCONFIG`` to ``True`` or ``False``. (`#10647 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10647>`_)\n- Make it possible to deselect tests requiring cryptography package on systems where it cannot be installed. (`#10686 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10686>`_)\n- Start using Rich for presenting error messages in a consistent format. (`#10703 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10703>`_)\n- Improve presentation of errors from subprocesses. (`#10705 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10705>`_)\n- Forward pip's verbosity configuration to VCS tools to control their output accordingly. (`#8819 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8819>`_)\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Optimize installation order calculation to improve performance when installing requirements that form a complex dependency graph with a large amount of edges. (`#10557 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10557>`_)\n- When a package is requested by the user for upgrade, correctly identify that the extra-ed variant of that same package depended by another user-requested package is requesting the same package, and upgrade it accordingly. (`#10613 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10613>`_)\n- Prevent pip from installing yanked releases unless explicitly pinned via the ``==`` or ``===`` operators. (`#10617 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10617>`_)\n- Stop backtracking on build failures, by instead surfacing them to the user and aborting immediately. This behaviour provides more immediate feedback when a package cannot be built due to missing build dependencies or platform incompatibility. (`#10655 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10655>`_)\n- Silence ``Value for <location> does not match`` warning caused by an erroneous patch in Slackware-distributed Python 3.9. (`#10668 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10668>`_)\n- Fix an issue where pip did not consider dependencies with and without extras to be equal (`#9644 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9644>`_)\n\nVendored Libraries\n------------------\n\n- Upgrade CacheControl to 0.12.10\n- Upgrade certifi to 2021.10.8\n- Upgrade distlib to 0.3.4\n- Upgrade idna to 3.3\n- Upgrade msgpack to 1.0.3\n- Upgrade packaging to 21.3\n- Upgrade platformdirs to 2.4.1\n- Add pygments 2.11.2 as a vendored dependency.\n- Tree-trim unused portions of vendored pygments, to reduce the distribution size.\n- Upgrade pyparsing to 3.0.7\n- Upgrade Requests to 2.27.1\n- Upgrade resolvelib to 0.8.1\n- Add rich 11.0.0 as a vendored dependency.\n- Tree-trim unused portions of vendored rich, to reduce the distribution size.\n- Add typing_extensions 4.0.1 as a vendored dependency.\n- Upgrade urllib3 to 1.26.8\n\n\n21.3.1 (2021-10-22)\n===================\n\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n\n- Always refuse installing or building projects that have no ``pyproject.toml`` nor\n  ``setup.py``. (`#10531 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10531>`_)\n- Tweak running-as-root detection, to check ``os.getuid`` if it exists, on Unix-y and non-Linux/non-MacOS machines. (`#10565 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10565>`_)\n- When installing projects with a ``pyproject.toml`` in editable mode, and the build\n  backend does not support :pep:`660`, prepare metadata using\n  ``prepare_metadata_for_build_wheel`` instead of ``setup.py egg_info``. Also, refuse\n  installing projects that only have a ``setup.cfg`` and no ``setup.py`` nor\n  ``pyproject.toml``. These restore the pre-21.3 behaviour. (`#10573 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10573>`_)\n- Restore compatibility of where configuration files are loaded from on MacOS (back to ``Library/Application Support/pip``, instead of ``Preferences/pip``). (`#10585 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10585>`_)\n\nVendored Libraries\n------------------\n\n\n- Upgrade pep517 to 0.12.0\n\n\n21.3 (2021-10-11)\n=================\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n\n- Improve deprecation warning regarding the copying of source trees when installing from a local directory. (`#10128 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10128>`_)\n- Suppress location mismatch warnings when pip is invoked from a Python source\n  tree, so ``ensurepip`` does not emit warnings on CPython ``make install``. (`#10270 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10270>`_)\n- On Python 3.10 or later, the installation scheme backend has been changed to use\n  ``sysconfig``. This is to anticipate the deprecation of ``distutils`` in Python\n  3.10, and its scheduled removal in 3.12. For compatibility considerations, pip\n  installations running on Python 3.9 or lower will continue to use ``distutils``. (`#10358 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10358>`_)\n- Remove the ``--build-dir`` option and aliases, one last time. (`#10485 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10485>`_)\n- In-tree builds are now the default. ``--use-feature=in-tree-build`` is now\n  ignored. ``--use-deprecated=out-of-tree-build`` may be used temporarily to ease\n  the transition. (`#10495 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10495>`_)\n- Un-deprecate source distribution re-installation behaviour. (`#8711 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8711>`_)\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- Replace vendored appdirs with platformdirs. (`#10202 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10202>`_)\n- Support `PEP 610 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0610/>`_ to detect\n  editable installs in ``pip freeze`` and  ``pip list``. The ``pip list`` column output\n  has a new ``Editable project location`` column, and the JSON output has a new\n  ``editable_project_location`` field. (`#10249 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10249>`_)\n- ``pip freeze`` will now always fallback to reporting the editable project\n  location when it encounters a VCS error while analyzing an editable\n  requirement. Before, it sometimes reported the requirement as non-editable. (`#10410 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10410>`_)\n- ``pip show`` now sorts ``Requires`` and ``Required-By`` alphabetically. (`#10422 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10422>`_)\n- Do not raise error when there are no files to remove with ``pip cache purge/remove``.\n  Instead log a warning and continue (to log that we removed 0 files). (`#10459 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10459>`_)\n- When backtracking during dependency resolution, prefer the dependencies which are involved in the most recent conflict. This can significantly reduce the amount of backtracking required. (`#10479 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10479>`_)\n- Cache requirement objects, to improve performance reducing reparses of requirement strings. (`#10550 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10550>`_)\n- Support editable installs for projects that have a ``pyproject.toml`` and use a\n  build backend that supports :pep:`660`. (`#8212 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8212>`_)\n- When a revision is specified in a Git URL, use git's partial clone feature to speed up source retrieval. (`#9086 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9086>`_)\n- Add a ``--debug`` flag, to enable a mode that doesn't log errors and propagates them to the top level instead. This is primarily to aid with debugging pip's crashes. (`#9349 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9349>`_)\n- If a host is explicitly specified as trusted by the user (via the --trusted-host option), cache HTTP responses from it in addition to HTTPS ones. (`#9498 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9498>`_)\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Present a better error message, when a ``file:`` URL is not found. (`#10263 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10263>`_)\n- Fix the auth credential cache to allow for the case in which\n  the index url contains the username, but the password comes\n  from an external source, such as keyring. (`#10269 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10269>`_)\n- Fix double unescape of HTML ``data-requires-python`` and ``data-yanked`` attributes. (`#10378 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10378>`_)\n- New resolver: Fixes depth ordering of packages during resolution, e.g. a dependency 2 levels deep will be ordered before a dependency 3 levels deep. (`#10482 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10482>`_)\n- Correctly indent metadata preparation messages in pip output. (`#10524 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10524>`_)\n\nVendored Libraries\n------------------\n\n- Remove appdirs as a vendored dependency.\n- Upgrade distlib to 0.3.3\n- Upgrade distro to 1.6.0\n- Patch pkg_resources to use platformdirs rather than appdirs.\n- Add platformdirs as a vendored dependency.\n- Upgrade progress to 1.6\n- Upgrade resolvelib to 0.8.0\n- Upgrade urllib3 to 1.26.7\n\nImproved Documentation\n----------------------\n\n- Update links of setuptools as setuptools moved these documents. The Simple Repository link now points to PyPUG as that is the canonical place of packaging specification, and setuptools's ``easy_install`` is deprecated. (`#10430 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10430>`_)\n- Create a \"Build System Interface\" reference section, for documenting how pip interacts with build systems. (`#10497 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10497>`_)\n\n\n21.2.4 (2021-08-12)\n===================\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Fix 3.6.0 compatibility in link comparison logic. (`#10280 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10280>`_)\n\n\n21.2.3 (2021-08-06)\n===================\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Modify the ``sysconfig.get_preferred_scheme`` function check to be\n  compatible with CPython 3.10’s alphareleases. (`#10252 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10252>`_)\n\n\n21.2.2 (2021-07-31)\n===================\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- New resolver: When a package is specified with extras in constraints, and with\n  extras in non-constraint requirements, the resolver now correctly identifies the\n  constraint's existence and avoids backtracking. (`#10233 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10233>`_)\n\n\n21.2.1 (2021-07-25)\n===================\n\nProcess\n-------\n\n- The source distribution re-installation feature removal has been delayed to 21.3.\n\n\n21.2 (2021-07-24)\n=================\n\nProcess\n-------\n\n- ``pip freeze``, ``pip list``, and ``pip show`` no longer normalize underscore\n  (``_``) in distribution names to dash (``-``). This is a side effect of the\n  migration to ``importlib.metadata``, since the underscore-dash normalization\n  behavior is non-standard and specific to setuptools. This should not affect\n  other parts of pip (for example, when feeding the ``pip freeze`` result back\n  into ``pip install``) since pip internally performs standard PEP 503\n  normalization independently to setuptools.\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n\n- Git version parsing is now done with regular expression to prepare for the\n  pending upstream removal of non-PEP-440 version parsing logic. (`#10117 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10117>`_)\n- Re-enable the \"Value for ... does not match\" location warnings to field a new\n  round of feedback for the ``distutils``-``sysconfig`` transition. (`#10151 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10151>`_)\n- Remove deprecated ``--find-links`` option in ``pip freeze`` (`#9069 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9069>`_)\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- New resolver: Loosen URL comparison logic when checking for direct URL reference\n  equivalency. The logic includes the following notable characteristics:\n\n  * The authentication part of the URL is explicitly ignored.\n  * Most of the fragment part, including ``egg=``, is explicitly ignored. Only\n    ``subdirectory=`` and hash values (e.g. ``sha256=``) are kept.\n  * The query part of the URL is parsed to allow ordering differences. (`#10002 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10002>`_)\n- Support TOML v1.0.0 syntax in ``pyproject.toml``. (`#10034 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10034>`_)\n- Added a warning message for errors caused due to Long Paths being disabled on Windows. (`#10045 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10045>`_)\n- Change the encoding of log file from default text encoding to UTF-8. (`#10071 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10071>`_)\n- Log the resolved commit SHA when installing a package from a Git repository. (`#10149 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10149>`_)\n- Add a warning when passing an invalid requirement to ``pip uninstall``. (`#4958 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/4958>`_)\n- Add new subcommand ``pip index`` used to interact with indexes, and implement\n  ``pip index version`` to list available versions of a package. (`#7975 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/7975>`_)\n- When pip is asked to uninstall a project without the dist-info/RECORD file\n  it will no longer traceback with FileNotFoundError,\n  but it will provide a better error message instead, such as::\n\n      ERROR: Cannot uninstall foobar 0.1, RECORD file not found. You might be able to recover from this via: 'pip install --force-reinstall --no-deps foobar==0.1'.\n\n  When dist-info/INSTALLER is present and contains some useful information, the info is included in the error message instead::\n\n      ERROR: Cannot uninstall foobar 0.1, RECORD file not found. Hint: The package was installed by rpm.\n\n  (`#8954 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8954>`_)\n- Add an additional level of verbosity. ``--verbose`` (and the shorthand ``-v``) now\n  contains significantly less output, and users that need complete full debug-level output\n  should pass it twice (``--verbose --verbose`` or ``-vv``). (`#9450 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9450>`_)\n- New resolver: The order of dependencies resolution has been tweaked to traverse\n  the dependency graph in a more breadth-first approach. (`#9455 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9455>`_)\n- Make \"yes\" the default choice in ``pip uninstall``'s prompt. (`#9686 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9686>`_)\n- Add a special error message when users forget the ``-r`` flag when installing. (`#9915 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9915>`_)\n- New resolver: A distribution's ``Requires-Python`` metadata is now checked\n  before its Python dependencies. This makes the resolver fail quicker when\n  there's an interpreter version conflict. (`#9925 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9925>`_)\n- Suppress \"not on PATH\" warning when ``--prefix`` is given. (`#9931 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9931>`_)\n- Include ``rustc`` version in pip's ``User-Agent``, when the system has ``rustc``. (`#9987 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9987>`_)\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Update vendored six to 1.16.0 and urllib3 to 1.26.5 (`#10043 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10043>`_)\n- Correctly allow PEP 517 projects to be detected without warnings in ``pip freeze``. (`#10080 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10080>`_)\n- Strip leading slash from a ``file://`` URL built from an path with the Windows\n  drive notation. This fixes bugs where the ``file://`` URL cannot be correctly\n  used as requirement, constraint, or index URLs on Windows. (`#10115 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10115>`_)\n- New resolver: URL comparison logic now treats ``file://localhost/`` and\n  ``file:///`` as equivalent to conform to RFC 8089. (`#10162 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10162>`_)\n- Prefer credentials from the URL over the previously-obtained credentials from URLs of the same domain, so it is possible to use different credentials on the same index server for different ``--extra-index-url`` options. (`#3931 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/3931>`_)\n- Fix extraction of files with utf-8 encoded paths from tars. (`#7667 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/7667>`_)\n- Skip distutils configuration parsing on encoding errors. (`#8931 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8931>`_)\n- New resolver: Detect an unnamed requirement is user-specified (by building its\n  metadata for the project name) so it can be correctly ordered in the resolver. (`#9204 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9204>`_)\n- Fix :ref:`pip freeze` to output packages :ref:`installed from git <vcs support>`\n  in the correct ``git+protocol://git.example.com/MyProject#egg=MyProject`` format\n  rather than the old and no longer supported ``git+git@`` format. (`#9822 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9822>`_)\n- Fix warnings about install scheme selection for Python framework builds\n  distributed by Apple's Command Line Tools. (`#9844 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9844>`_)\n- Relax interpreter detection to quelch a location mismatch warning where PyPy\n  is deliberately breaking backwards compatibility. (`#9845 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9845>`_)\n\nVendored Libraries\n------------------\n\n- Upgrade certifi to 2021.05.30.\n- Upgrade idna to 3.2.\n- Upgrade packaging to 21.0\n- Upgrade requests to 2.26.0.\n- Upgrade resolvelib to 0.7.1.\n- Upgrade urllib3 to 1.26.6.\n\n\n21.1.3 (2021-06-26)\n===================\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Remove unused optional ``tornado`` import in vendored ``tenacity`` to prevent old versions of Tornado from breaking pip. (`#10020 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10020>`_)\n- Require ``setup.cfg``-only projects to be built via PEP 517, by requiring an explicit dependency on setuptools declared in pyproject.toml. (`#10031 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/10031>`_)\n\n\n21.1.2 (2021-05-23)\n===================\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- New resolver: Correctly exclude an already installed package if its version is\n  known to be incompatible to stop the dependency resolution process with a clear\n  error message. (`#9841 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9841>`_)\n- Allow ZIP to archive files with timestamps earlier than 1980. (`#9910 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9910>`_)\n- Emit clearer error message when a project root does not contain either\n  ``pyproject.toml``, ``setup.py`` or ``setup.cfg``. (`#9944 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9944>`_)\n- Fix detection of existing standalone pip instance for PEP 517 builds. (`#9953 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9953>`_)\n\n\n21.1.1 (2021-04-30)\n===================\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n\n- Temporarily set the new \"Value for ... does not match\" location warnings level\n  to *DEBUG*, to hide them from casual users. This prepares pip 21.1 for CPython\n  inclusion, while pip maintainers digest the first intake of location mismatch\n  issues for the ``distutils``-``sysconfig`` transition. (`#9912 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9912>`_)\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- This change fixes a bug on Python <=3.6.1 with a Typing feature added in 3.6.2 (`#9831 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9831>`_)\n- Fix compatibility between distutils and sysconfig when the project name is unknown outside of a virtual environment. (`#9838 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9838>`_)\n- Fix Python 3.6 compatibility when a PEP 517 build requirement itself needs to be\n  built in an isolated environment. (`#9878 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9878>`_)\n\n\n21.1 (2021-04-24)\n=================\n\nProcess\n-------\n\n- Start installation scheme migration from ``distutils`` to ``sysconfig``. A\n  warning is implemented to detect differences between the two implementations to\n  encourage user reports, so we can avoid breakages before they happen.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- Add the ability for the new resolver to process URL constraints. (`#8253 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8253>`_)\n- Add a feature ``--use-feature=in-tree-build`` to build local projects in-place\n  when installing. This is expected to become the default behavior in pip 21.3;\n  see `Installing from local packages <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#installing-from-local-packages>`_\n  for more information. (`#9091 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9091>`_)\n- Bring back the \"(from versions: ...)\" message, that was shown on resolution failures. (`#9139 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9139>`_)\n- Add support for editable installs for project with only setup.cfg files. (`#9547 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9547>`_)\n- Improve performance when picking the best file from indexes during ``pip install``. (`#9748 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9748>`_)\n- Warn instead of erroring out when doing a PEP 517 build in presence of\n  ``--build-option``. Warn when doing a PEP 517 build in presence of\n  ``--global-option``. (`#9774 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9774>`_)\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Fixed ``--target`` to work with ``--editable`` installs. (`#4390 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/4390>`_)\n- Add a warning, discouraging the usage of pip as root, outside a virtual environment. (`#6409 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/6409>`_)\n- Ignore ``.dist-info`` directories if the stem is not a valid Python distribution\n  name, so they don't show up in e.g. ``pip freeze``. (`#7269 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/7269>`_)\n- Only query the keyring for URLs that actually trigger error 401.\n  This prevents an unnecessary keyring unlock prompt on every pip install\n  invocation (even with default index URL which is not password protected). (`#8090 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8090>`_)\n- Prevent packages already-installed alongside with pip to be injected into an\n  isolated build environment during build-time dependency population. (`#8214 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8214>`_)\n- Fix ``pip freeze`` permission denied error in order to display an understandable error message and offer solutions. (`#8418 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8418>`_)\n- Correctly uninstall script files (from setuptools' ``scripts`` argument), when installed with ``--user``. (`#8733 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8733>`_)\n- New resolver: When a requirement is requested both via a direct URL\n  (``req @ URL``) and via version specifier with extras (``req[extra]``), the\n  resolver will now be able to use the URL to correctly resolve the requirement\n  with extras. (`#8785 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8785>`_)\n- New resolver: Show relevant entries from user-supplied constraint files in the\n  error message to improve debuggability. (`#9300 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9300>`_)\n- Avoid parsing version to make the version check more robust against lousily\n  debundled downstream distributions. (`#9348 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9348>`_)\n- ``--user`` is no longer suggested incorrectly when pip fails with a permission\n  error in a virtual environment. (`#9409 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9409>`_)\n- Fix incorrect reporting on ``Requires-Python`` conflicts. (`#9541 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9541>`_)\n- Make wheel compatibility tag preferences more important than the build tag (`#9565 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9565>`_)\n- Fix pip to work with warnings converted to errors. (`#9779 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9779>`_)\n- **SECURITY**: Stop splitting on unicode separators in git references,\n  which could be maliciously used to install a different revision on the\n  repository. (`#9827 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9827>`_)\n\nVendored Libraries\n------------------\n\n- Update urllib3 to 1.26.4 to fix CVE-2021-28363\n- Remove contextlib2.\n- Upgrade idna to 3.1\n- Upgrade pep517 to 0.10.0\n- Upgrade vendored resolvelib to 0.7.0.\n- Upgrade tenacity to 7.0.0\n\nImproved Documentation\n----------------------\n\n- Update \"setuptools extras\" link to match upstream.

(`#7327 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/7327>`_)\n- Remove interpreter-specific major version tag e.g. ``cp3-none-any``\n  from consideration. This behavior was not documented strictly, and this\n  tag in particular is `not useful <https://snarky.ca/the-challenges-in-designing-a-library-for-pep-425/>`_.\n  Anyone with a use case can create an issue with pypa/packaging. (`#7355 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/7355>`_)\n- Wheel processing no longer permits wheels containing more than one top-level\n  .dist-info directory. (`#7487 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/7487>`_)\n- Support for the ``git+git@`` form of VCS requirement is being deprecated and\n  will be removed in pip 21.0. Switch to ``git+https://`` or\n  ``git+ssh://``. ``git+git://`` also works but its use is discouraged as it is\n  insecure.

(`#6673 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/6673>`_)\n- Cache wheels that ``pip wheel`` built locally, matching what\n  ``pip install`` does. This particularly helps performance in workflows where\n  ``pip wheel`` is used for `building before installing\n  <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#installing-from-local-packages>`_.\n  Users desiring the original behavior can use ``pip wheel --no-cache-dir``. (`#6852 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/6852>`_)\n- Display CA information in ``pip debug``. (`#7146 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/7146>`_)\n- Show only the filename (instead of full URL), when downloading from PyPI. (`#7225 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/7225>`_)\n- Suggest a more robust command to upgrade pip itself to avoid confusion when the\n  current pip command is not available as ``pip``. (`#7376 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/7376>`_)\n- Define all old pip console script entrypoints to prevent import issues in\n  stale wrapper scripts. (`#7498 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/7498>`_)\n- The build step of ``pip wheel`` now builds all wheels to a cache first,\n  then copies them to the wheel directory all at once.\n  Before, it built them to a temporary directory and moved\n  them to the wheel directory one by one. (`#7517 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/7517>`_)\n- Expand ``~`` prefix to user directory in path options, configs, and\n  environment variables. Values that may be either URL or path are not\n  currently supported, to avoid ambiguity:\n\n  * ``--find-links``\n  * ``--constraint``, ``-c``\n  * ``--requirement``, ``-r``\n  * ``--editable``, ``-e`` (`#980 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/980>`_)\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Correctly handle system site-packages, in virtual environments created with venv (PEP 405).

(`#6783 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/6783>`_)\n- Change method from shutil.remove to shutil.rmtree in noxfile.py. (`#7191 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/7191>`_)\n- Skip running tests which require subversion, when svn isn't installed (`#7193 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/7193>`_)\n- Fix not sending client certificates when using ``--trusted-host``. (`#7207 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/7207>`_)\n- Make sure ``pip wheel`` never outputs pure python wheels with a\n  python implementation tag. Better fix/workaround for\n  `#3025 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/3025>`_ by\n  using a per-implementation wheel cache instead of caching pure python\n  wheels with an implementation tag in their name. (`#7296 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/7296>`_)\n- Include ``subdirectory`` URL fragments in cache keys. (`#7333 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/7333>`_)\n- Fix typo in warning message when any of ``--build-option``, ``--global-option``\n  and ``--install-option`` is used in requirements.txt (`#7340 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/7340>`_)\n- Fix the logging of cached HTTP response shown as downloading. (`#7393 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/7393>`_)\n- Effectively disable the wheel cache when it is not writable, as is the\n  case with the http cache.

(#5319)\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Update pip's self-check logic to not use a virtualenv specific file and honor cache-dir. (#3905)\n- Remove compiled pyo files for wheel packages. (#4471)\n- Speed up printing of newly installed package versions. (#5127)\n- Restrict install time dependency warnings to directly-dependant packages. (#5196, #5457)\n\n  Warning about the entire package set has resulted in users getting confused as\n  to why pip is printing these warnings.\n- Improve handling of PEP 518 build requirements: support environment markers and extras. (#5230, #5265)\n- Remove username/password from log message when using index with basic auth. (#5249)\n- Remove trailing os.sep from PATH directories to avoid false negatives. (#5293)\n- Fix \"pip wheel pip\" being blocked by the \"don't use pip to modify itself\" check. (#5311, #5312)\n- Disable pip's version check (and upgrade message) when installed by a different package manager. (#5346)\n\n  This works better with Linux distributions where pip's upgrade message may\n  result in users running pip in a manner that modifies files that should be\n  managed by the OS's package manager.\n- Check for file existence and unlink first when clobbering existing files during a wheel install. (#5366)\n- Improve error message to be more specific when no files are found as listed in as listed in PKG-INFO. (#5381)\n- Always read ``pyproject.toml`` as UTF-8. This fixes Unicode handling on Windows and Python 2. (#5482)\n- Fix a crash that occurs when PATH not set, while generating script location warning. (#5558)\n- Disallow packages with ``pyproject.toml`` files that have an empty build-system table. (#5627)\n\nVendored Libraries\n------------------\n\n- Update CacheControl to 0.12.5.\n- Update certifi to 2018.4.16.\n- Update distro to 1.3.0.\n- Update idna to 2.7.\n- Update ipaddress to 1.0.22.\n- Update pkg_resources to 39.2.0 (via setuptools).\n- Update progress to 1.4.\n- Update pytoml to 0.1.16.\n- Update requests to 2.19.1.\n- Update urllib3 to 1.23.\n\nImproved Documentation\n----------------------\n\n- Document how to use pip with a proxy server. (#512, #5574)\n- Document that the output of pip show is in RFC-compliant mail header format. (#5261)\n\n\n10.0.1 (2018-04-19)\n===================\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- Switch the default repository to the new \"PyPI 2.0\" running at\n  https://pypi.org/. (#5214)\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Fix a bug that made get-pip.py unusable on Windows without renaming. (#5219)\n- Fix a TypeError when loading the cache on older versions of Python 2.7.\n  (#5231)\n- Fix and improve error message when EnvironmentError occurs during\n  installation. (#5237)\n- A crash when reinstalling from VCS requirements has been fixed. (#5251)\n- Fix PEP 518 support when pip is installed in the user site. (#5524)\n\nVendored Libraries\n------------------\n\n- Upgrade distlib to 0.2.7\n\n\n10.0.0 (2018-04-14)\n===================\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Prevent false-positive installation warnings due to incomplete name\n  normalization. (#5134)\n- Fix issue where installing from Git with a short SHA would fail. (#5140)\n- Accept pre-release versions when checking for conflicts with pip check or pip\n  install. (#5141)\n- ``ioctl(fd, termios.TIOCGWINSZ, ...)`` needs 8 bytes of data (#5150)\n- Do not warn about script location when installing to the directory containing\n  sys.executable. This is the case when 'pip install'ing without activating a\n  virtualenv. (#5157)\n- Fix PEP 518 support. (#5188)\n- Don't warn about script locations if ``--target`` is specified. (#5203)\n\n\n10.0.0b2 (2018-04-02)\n=====================\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Fixed line endings in CA Bundle - 10.0.0b1 was inadvertently released with Windows\n  line endings. (#5131)\n\n\n10.0.0b1 (2018-03-31)\n=====================\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n-------------------------\n\n- Removed the deprecated ``--egg`` parameter to ``pip install``. (#1749)\n- Removed support for uninstalling projects which have been installed using\n  distutils. distutils installed projects do not include metadata indicating\n  what files belong to that install and thus it is impossible to *actually*\n  uninstall them rather than just remove the metadata saying they've been\n  installed while leaving all of the actual files behind. (#2386)\n- Removed the deprecated ``--download`` option to ``pip install``. (#2643)\n- Removed the deprecated --(no-)use-wheel flags to ``pip install`` and ``pip\n  wheel``. (#2699)\n- Removed the deprecated ``--allow-external``, ``--allow-all-external``, and\n  ``--allow-unverified`` options. (#3070)\n- Switch the default for ``pip list`` to the columns format, and deprecate the\n  legacy format. (#3654, #3686)\n- Deprecate support for Python 3.3. (#3796)\n- Removed the deprecated ``--default-vcs`` option. (#4052)\n- Removed the ``setup.py test`` support from our sdist as it wasn't being\n  maintained as a supported means to run our tests. (#4203)\n- Dropped support for Python 2.6. (#4343)\n- Removed the --editable flag from pip download, as it did not make sense\n  (#4362)\n- Deprecate SVN detection based on dependency links in ``pip freeze``. (#4449)\n- Move all of pip's APIs into the pip._internal package, properly reflecting\n  the fact that pip does not currently have any public APIs. (#4696, #4700)\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- Add `--progress-bar <progress_bar>` to ``pip download``, ``pip install`` and\n  ``pip wheel`` commands, to allow selecting a specific progress indicator or,\n  to completely suppress, (for example in a CI environment) use\n  ``--progress-bar off```. (#2369, #2756)\n- Add `--no-color` to `pip`. All colored output is disabled if this flag is\n  detected. (#2449)\n- pip uninstall now ignores the absence of a requirement and prints a warning.\n  (#3016, #4642)\n- Improved the memory and disk efficiency of the HTTP cache. (#3515)\n- Support for packages specifying build dependencies in pyproject.toml (see\n  `PEP 518 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/>`__). Packages which\n  specify one or more build dependencies this way will be built into wheels in\n  an isolated environment with those dependencies installed. (#3691)\n- pip now supports environment variable expansion in requirement files using\n  only ``${VARIABLE}`` syntax on all platforms. (#3728)\n- Allowed combinations of -q and -v to act sanely. Then we don't need warnings\n  mentioned in the issue. (#4008)\n- Add `--exclude-editable` to ``pip freeze`` and ``pip list`` to exclude\n  editable packages from installed package list. (#4015, #4016)\n- Improve the error message for the common ``pip install ./requirements.txt``\n  case. (#4127)\n- Add support for the new ``@ url`` syntax from PEP 508. (#4175)\n- Add setuptools version to the statistics sent to BigQuery. (#4209)\n- Report the line which caused the hash error when using requirement files.\n  (#4227)\n- Add a pip config command for managing configuration files. (#4240)\n- Allow ``pip download`` to be used with a specific platform when ``--no-deps``\n  is set. (#4289)\n- Support build-numbers in wheel versions and support sorting with\n  build-numbers. (#4299)\n- Change pip outdated to use PackageFinder in order to do the version lookup so\n  that local mirrors in Environments that do not have Internet connections can\n  be used as the Source of Truth for latest version. (#4336)\n- pip now retries on more HTTP status codes, for intermittent failures.\n  Previously, it only retried on the standard 503. Now, it also retries on 500\n  (transient failures on AWS S3), 520 and 527 (transient failures on\n  Cloudflare). (#4473)\n- pip now displays where it is looking for packages, if non-default locations\n  are used. (#4483)\n- Display a message to run the right command for modifying pip on Windows\n  (#4490)\n- Add Man Pages for pip (#4491)\n- Make uninstall command less verbose by default (#4493)\n- Switch the default upgrade strategy to be 'only-if-needed' (#4500)\n- Installing from a local directory or a VCS URL now builds a wheel to install,\n  rather than running ``setup.py install``. Wheels from these sources are not\n  cached. (#4501)\n- Don't log a warning when installing a dependency from Git if the name looks\n  like a commit hash. (#4507)\n- pip now displays a warning when it installs scripts from a wheel outside the\n  PATH. These warnings can be suppressed using a new --no-warn-script-location\n  option. (#4553)\n- Local Packages can now be referenced using forward slashes on Windows.\n  (#4563)\n- pip show learnt a new Required-by field that lists currently installed\n  packages that depend on the shown package (#4564)\n- The command-line autocompletion engine ``pip show`` now autocompletes\n  installed distribution names. (#4749)\n- Change documentation theme to be in line with Python Documentation (#4758)\n- Add auto completion of short options. (#4954)\n- Run 'setup.py develop' inside pep518 build environment. (#4999)\n- pip install now prints an error message when it installs an incompatible\n  version of a dependency. (#5000)\n- Added a way to distinguish between pip installed packages and those from the\n  system package manager in 'pip list'. Specifically, 'pip list -v' also shows\n  the installer of package if it has that meta data. (#949)\n- Show install locations when list command ran with \"-v\" option. (#979)\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Allow pip to work if the ``GIT_DIR`` and ``GIT_WORK_TREE`` environment\n  variables are set. (#1130)\n- Make ``pip install --force-reinstall`` not require passing ``--upgrade``.\n  (#1139)\n- Return a failing exit status when `pip install`, `pip download`, or `pip\n  wheel` is called with no requirements. (#2720)\n- Interactive setup.py files will no longer hang indefinitely. (#2732, #4982)\n- Correctly reset the terminal if an exception occurs while a progress bar is\n  being shown. (#3015)\n- \"Support URL-encoded characters in URL credentials.\" (#3236)\n- Don't assume sys.__stderr__.encoding exists (#3356)\n- Fix ``pip uninstall`` when ``easy-install.pth`` lacks a trailing newline.\n  (#3741)\n- Keep install options in requirements.txt from leaking. (#3763)\n- pip no longer passes global options from one package to later packages in the\n  same requirement file. (#3830)\n- Support installing from Git refs (#3876)\n- Use pkg_resources to parse the entry points file to allow names with colons.\n  (#3901)\n- ``-q`` specified once correctly sets logging level to WARNING, instead of\n  CRITICAL. Use `-qqq` to have the previous behavior back. (#3994)\n- Shell completion scripts now use correct executable names (e.g., ``pip3``\n  instead of ``pip``) (#3997)\n- Changed vendored encodings from ``utf8`` to ``utf-8``. (#4076)\n- Fixes destination directory of data_files when ``pip install --target`` is\n  used. (#4092)\n- Limit the disabling of requests' pyopenssl to Windows only. Fixes\n  \"SNIMissingWarning / InsecurePlatformWarning not fixable with pip 9.0 /\n  9.0.1\" (for non-Windows) (#4098)\n- Support the installation of wheels with non-PEP 440 version in their\n  filenames. (#4169)\n- Fall back to sys.getdefaultencoding() if locale.getpreferredencoding()\n  returns None in `pip.utils.encoding.auto_decode`. (#4184)\n- Fix a bug where `SETUPTOOLS_SHIM` got called incorrectly for relative path\n  requirements by converting relative paths to absolute paths prior to calling\n  the shim. (#4208)\n- Return the latest version number in search results. (#4219)\n- Improve error message on permission errors (#4233)\n- Fail gracefully when ``/etc/image_version`` (or another distro version file)\n  appears to exists but is not readable. (#4249)\n- Avoid importing setuptools in the parent pip process, to avoid a race\n  condition when upgrading one of setuptools dependencies. (#4264)\n- Fix for an incorrect ``freeze`` warning message due to a package being\n  included in multiple requirements files that were passed to ``freeze``.\n  Instead of warning incorrectly that the package is not installed, pip now\n  warns that the package was declared multiple times and lists the name of each\n  requirements file that contains the package in question. (#4293)\n- Generalize help text for ``compile``/``no-compile`` flags. (#4316)\n- Handle the case when ``/etc`` is not readable by the current user by using a\n  hardcoded list of possible names of release files. (#4320)\n- Fixed a ``NameError`` when attempting to catch ``FileNotFoundError`` on\n  Python 2.7. (#4322)\n- Ensure USER_SITE is correctly initialised. (#4437)\n- Reinstalling an editable package from Git no longer assumes that the\n  ``master`` branch exists. (#4448)\n- This fixes an issue where when someone who tries to use git with pip but pip\n  can't because git is not in the path environment variable. This clarifies the\n  error given to suggest to the user what might be wrong. (#4461)\n- Improve handling of text output from build tools (avoid Unicode errors)\n  (#4486)\n- Fix a \"No such file or directory\" error when using --prefix. (#4495)\n- Allow commands to opt out of --require-venv. This allows pip help to work\n  even when the environment variable PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV is set. (#4496)\n- Fix warning message on mismatched versions during installation. (#4655)\n- pip now records installed files in a deterministic manner improving\n  reproducibility. (#4667)\n- Fix an issue where ``pip install -e`` on a Git url would fail to update if a\n  branch or tag name is specified that happens to match the prefix of the\n  current ``HEAD`` commit hash. (#4675)\n- Fix an issue where a variable assigned in a try clause was accessed in the\n  except clause, resulting in an undefined variable error in the except clause.\n  (#4811)\n- Use log level `info` instead of `warning` when ignoring packages due to\n  environment markers. (#4876)\n- Replaced typo mistake in subversion support. (#4908)\n- Terminal size is now correctly inferred when using Python 3 on Windows.\n  (#4966)\n- Abort if reading configuration causes encoding errors. (#4976)\n- Add a ``--no-user`` option and use it when installing build dependencies.\n  (#5085)\n\nVendored Libraries\n------------------\n\n- Upgraded appdirs to 1.4.3.\n- Upgraded CacheControl to 0.12.3.\n- Vendored certifi at 2017.7.27.1.\n- Vendored chardet at 3.0.4.\n- Upgraded colorama to 0.3.9.\n- Upgraded distlib to 0.2.6.\n- Upgraded distro to 1.2.0.\n- Vendored idna at idna==2.6.\n- Upgraded ipaddress to 1.0.18.\n- Vendored msgpack-python at 0.4.8.\n- Removed the vendored ordereddict.\n- Upgraded progress to 1.3.\n- Upgraded pyparsing to 2.2.0.\n- Upgraded pytoml to 0.1.14.\n- Upgraded requests to 2.18.4.\n- Upgraded pkg_resources (via setuptools) to 36.6.0.\n- Upgraded six to 1.11.0.\n- Vendored urllib3 at 1.22.\n- Upgraded webencodings to 0.5.1.\n\nImproved Documentation\n----------------------\n\n- Added documentation on usage of --build command line option (#4262)\n-  (#4358)\n- Document how to call pip from your code, including the fact that we do not\n  provide a Python API. (#4743)\n\n\n9.0.3 (2018-03-21)\n==================\n\n- Fix an error where the vendored requests was not correctly containing itself\n  to only the internal vendored prefix.\n- Restore compatibility with 2.6.\n\n\n9.0.2 (2018-03-16)\n==================\n\n- Fallback to using SecureTransport on macOS when the linked OpenSSL is too old\n  to support TLSv1.2.\n\n\n9.0.1 (2016-11-06)\n==================\n\n- Correct the deprecation message when not specifying a --format so that it\n  uses the correct setting name (``format``) rather than the incorrect one\n  (``list_format``). (#4058)\n- Fix ``pip check`` to check all available distributions and not just the\n  local ones. (#4083)\n- Fix a crash on non ASCII characters from `lsb_release`. (#4062)\n- Fix an SyntaxError in an unused module of a vendored dependency. (#4059)\n- Fix UNC paths on Windows. (#4064)\n\n\n9.0.0 (2016-11-02)\n==================\n\n- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Remove the attempted autodetection of requirement\n  names from URLs, URLs must include a name via ``#egg=``.\n- **DEPRECATION** ``pip install --egg`` have been deprecated and will be\n  removed in the future. This \"feature\" has a long list of drawbacks which\n  break nearly all of pip's other features in subtle and hard-to-diagnose\n  ways.\n- **DEPRECATION** ``--default-vcs`` option. (#4052)\n- **WARNING** pip 9 cache can break forward compatibility with previous pip\n  versions if your package repository allows chunked responses. (#4078)\n- Add an ``--upgrade-strategy`` option to ``pip install``, to control how\n  dependency upgrades are managed. (#3972)\n- Add a ``pip check`` command to check installed packages dependencies. (#3750)\n- Add option allowing user to abort pip operation if file/directory exists\n- Add Appveyor CI\n- Uninstall existing packages when performing an editable installation of\n  the same packages. (#1548)\n- ``pip show`` is less verbose by default. ``--verbose`` prints multiline\n  fields. (#3858)\n- Add optional column formatting to ``pip list``. (#3651)\n- Add ``--not-required`` option to ``pip list``, which lists packages that are\n  not dependencies of other packages.\n- Fix builds on systems with symlinked ``/tmp`` directory for custom\n  builds such as numpy. (#3701)\n- Fix regression in ``pip freeze``: when there is more than one git remote,\n  priority is given to the remote named ``origin``. (#3708, #3616).\n- Fix crash when calling ``pip freeze`` with invalid requirement installed.\n  (#3704, #3681)\n- Allow multiple ``--requirement`` files in ``pip freeze``. (#3703)\n- Implementation of pep-503 ``data-requires-python``. When this field is\n  present for a release link, pip will ignore the download when\n  installing to a Python version that doesn't satisfy the requirement.\n- ``pip wheel`` now works on editable packages too (it was only working on\n  editable dependencies before); this allows running ``pip wheel`` on the result\n  of ``pip freeze`` in presence of editable requirements. (#3695, #3291)\n- Load credentials from ``.netrc`` files. (#3715, #3569)\n- Add ``--platform``, ``--python-version``, ``--implementation`` and ``--abi``\n  parameters to ``pip download``. These allow utilities and advanced users to\n  gather distributions for interpreters other than the one pip is being run on.\n  (#3760)\n- Skip scanning virtual environments, even when venv/bin/python is a dangling\n  symlink.\n- Added ``pip completion`` support for the ``fish`` shell.\n- Fix problems on Windows on Python 2 when username or hostname contains\n  non-ASCII characters. (#3463, #3970, #4000)\n- Use ``git fetch --tags`` to fetch tags in addition to everything else that\n  is normally fetched; this is necessary in case a git requirement url\n  points to a tag or commit that is not on a branch. (#3791)\n- Normalize package names before using in ``pip show`` (#3976)\n- Raise when Requires-Python do not match the running version and add\n  ``--ignore-requires-python`` option as escape hatch. (#3846)\n- Report the correct installed version when performing an upgrade in some\n  corner cases. (#2382\n- Add ``-i`` shorthand for ``--index`` flag in ``pip search``.\n- Do not optionally load C dependencies in requests. (#1840, #2930, #3024)\n- Strip authentication from SVN url prior to passing it to ``svn``.\n  (#3697, #3209)\n- Also install in platlib with ``--target`` option. (#3694, #3682)\n- Restore the ability to use inline comments in requirements files passed to\n  ``pip freeze``. (#3680)\n\n\n8.1.2 (2016-05-10)\n==================\n\n- Fix a regression on systems with uninitialized locale. (#3575)\n- Use environment markers to filter packages before determining if a required\n  wheel is supported. (#3254)\n- Make glibc parsing for `manylinux1` support more robust for the variety of\n  glibc versions found in the wild. (#3588)\n- Update environment marker support to fully support legacy and PEP 508 style\n  environment markers. (#3624)\n- Always use debug logging to the ``--log`` file. (#3351)\n- Don't attempt to wrap search results for extremely narrow terminal windows.\n  (#3655)\n\n\n8.1.1 (2016-03-17)\n==================\n\n- Fix regression with non-ascii requirement files on Python 2 and add support\n  for encoding headers in requirement files. (#3548, #3547)\n\n\n8.1.0 (2016-03-05)\n==================\n\n- Implement PEP 513, which adds support for the manylinux1 platform tag,\n  allowing carefully compiled binary wheels to be installed on compatible Linux\n  platforms.\n- Allow wheels which are not specific to a particular Python interpreter but\n  which are specific to a particular platform. (#3202)\n- Fixed an issue where ``call_subprocess`` would crash trying to print debug\n  data on child process failure. (#3521, #3522)\n- Exclude the wheel package from the `pip freeze` output (like pip and\n  setuptools). (#2989)\n- Allow installing modules from a subdirectory of a vcs repository in\n  non-editable mode. (#3217, #3466)\n- Make pip wheel and pip download work with vcs urls with subdirectory option.\n  (#3466)\n- Show classifiers in ``pip show``.\n- Show PEP376 Installer in ``pip show``. (#3517)\n- Unhide completion command. (#1810)\n- Show latest version number in ``pip search`` results. (#1415)\n- Decode requirement files according to their BOM if present. (#3485, #2865)\n- Fix and deprecate package name detection from url path. (#3523, #3495)\n- Correct the behavior where interpreter specific tags (such as cp34) were\n  being used on later versions of the same interpreter instead of only for that\n  specific interpreter. (#3472)\n- Fix an issue where pip would erroneously install a 64 bit wheel on a 32 bit\n  Python running on a 64 bit macOS machine.\n- Do not assume that all git repositories have an origin remote.\n- Correctly display the line to add to a requirements.txt for an URL based\n  dependency when ``--require-hashes`` is enabled.\n\n\n8.0.3 (2016-02-25)\n==================\n\n- Make ``install --quiet`` really quiet. (#3418)\n- Fix a bug when removing packages in python 3: disable INI-style parsing of the\n  entry_point.txt file to allow entry point names with colons. (#3434)\n- Normalize generated script files path in RECORD files. (#3448)\n- Fix bug introduced in 8.0.0 where subcommand output was not shown,\n  even when the user specified ``-v`` / ``--verbose``. (#3486)\n- Enable python -W with respect to PipDeprecationWarning. (#3455)\n- Upgrade distlib to 0.2.2.\n- Improved support for Jython when quoting executables in output scripts.\n  (#3467)\n- Add a `--all` option to `pip freeze` to include usually skipped package\n  (like pip, setuptools and wheel) to the freeze output. (#1610)\n\n\n8.0.2 (2016-01-21)\n==================\n\n- Stop attempting to trust the system CA trust store because it's extremely\n  common for them to be broken, often in incompatible ways. (#3416)\n\n\n8.0.1 (2016-01-21)\n==================\n\n- Detect CAPaths in addition to CAFiles on platforms that provide them.\n- Installing argparse or wsgiref will no longer warn or error - pip will allow\n  the installation even though it may be useless (since the installed thing\n  will be shadowed by the standard library).\n- Upgrading a distutils installed item that is installed outside of a virtual\n  environment, while inside of a virtual environment will no longer warn or\n  error.\n- Fix a bug where pre-releases were showing up in ``pip list --outdated``\n  without the ``--pre`` flag.\n- Switch the SOABI emulation from using RuntimeWarnings to debug logging.\n- Rollback the removal of the ability to uninstall distutils installed items\n  until a future date.\n\n\n8.0.0 (2016-01-19)\n==================\n\n- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Drop support for Python 3.2.\n- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Remove the ability to find any files other than the\n  ones directly linked from the index or find-links pages.\n- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Remove the ``--download-cache`` which had been\n  deprecated and no-op'd in 6.0.\n- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Remove the ``--log-explicit-levels`` which had been\n  deprecated in 6.0.\n- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Change pip wheel --wheel-dir default path from\n  <cwd>/wheelhouse to <cwd>.\n- Deprecate and no-op the ``--allow-external``, ``--allow-all-external``, and\n  ``--allow-unverified`` functionality that was added as part of PEP 438. With\n  changes made to the repository protocol made in PEP 470, these options are no\n  longer functional.\n- Allow ``--trusted-host`` within a requirements file. (#2822)\n- Allow ``--process-dependency-links`` within a requirements file. (#1274)\n- Allow ``--pre`` within a requirements file. (#1273)\n- Allow repository URLs with secure transports to count as trusted. (E.g.,\n  \"git+ssh\" is okay.) (#2811)\n- Implement a top-level ``pip download`` command and deprecate\n  ``pip install --download``.\n- When uninstalling, look for the case of paths containing symlinked\n  directories (#3141, #3154)\n- When installing, if building a wheel fails, clear up the build directory\n  before falling back to a source install. (#3047)\n- Fix user directory expansion when ``HOME=/``. Workaround for Python bug\n  https://bugs.python.org/issue14768. (#2996)\n- Correct reporting of requirements file line numbers. (#3009, #3125)\n- Fixed Exception(IOError) for ``pip freeze`` and ``pip list`` commands with\n  subversion >= 1.7. (#1062, #3346)\n- Provide a spinner showing that progress is happening when installing or\n  building a package via ``setup.py``. This will alleviate concerns that\n  projects with unusually long build times have with pip appearing to stall.\n- Include the functionality of ``peep`` into pip, allowing hashes to be baked\n  into a requirements file and ensuring that the packages being downloaded\n  match one of those hashes. This is an additional, opt-in security measure\n  that, when used, removes the need to trust the repository.\n- Fix a bug causing pip to not select a wheel compiled against an OSX SDK later\n  than what Python itself was compiled against when running on a newer version\n  of OSX.\n- Add a new ``--prefix`` option for ``pip install`` that supports wheels and\n  sdists. (#3252)\n- Fixed issue regarding wheel building with setup.py using a different encoding\n  than the system. (#2042)\n- Drop PasteScript specific egg_info hack. (#3270)\n- Allow combination of pip list options --editable with --outdated/--uptodate.\n  (#933)\n- Gives VCS implementations control over saying whether a project is under\n  their control. (#3258)\n- Git detection now works when ``setup.py`` is not at the Git repo root\n  and when ``package_dir`` is used, so ``pip freeze`` works in more\n  cases. (#3258)\n- Correctly freeze Git develop packages in presence of the &subdirectory\n  option (#3258)\n- The detection of editable packages now relies on the presence of ``.egg-link``\n  instead of looking for a VCS, so ``pip list -e`` is more reliable. (#3258)\n- Add the ``--prefix`` flag to ``pip install`` which allows specifying a root\n  prefix to use instead of ``sys.prefix``. (#3252)\n- Allow duplicate specifications in the case that only the extras differ, and\n  union all specified extras together. (#3198)\n- Fix the detection of the user's current platform on OSX when determining the\n  OSX SDK version. (#3232)\n- Prevent the automatically built wheels from mistakenly being used across\n  multiple versions of Python when they may not be correctly configured for\n  that by making the wheel specific to a specific version of Python and\n  specific interpreter. (#3225)\n- Emulate the SOABI support in wheels from Python 2.x on Python 2.x as closely\n  as we can with the information available within the interpreter. (#3075)\n- Don't roundtrip to the network when git is pinned to a specific commit hash\n  and that hash already exists locally. (#3066)\n- Prefer wheels built against a newer SDK to wheels built against an older SDK\n  on OSX. (#3163)\n- Show entry points for projects installed via wheel. (#3122)\n- Improve message when an unexisting path is passed to --find-links option.\n  (#2968)\n- pip freeze does not add the VCS branch/tag name in the #egg=... fragment\n  anymore. (#3312)\n- Warn on installation of editable if the provided #egg=name part does not\n  match the metadata produced by `setup.py egg_info`. (#3143)\n- Add support for .xz files for python versions supporting them (>= 3.3). (#722)\n\n\n7.1.2 (2015-08-22)\n==================\n\n- Don't raise an error if pip is not installed when checking for the latest pip\n  version.\n\n\n7.1.1 (2015-08-20)\n==================\n\n- Check that the wheel cache directory is writable before we attempt to write\n  cached files to them.\n- Move the pip version check until *after* any installs have been performed,\n  thus removing the extraneous warning when upgrading pip.\n- Added debug logging when using a cached wheel.\n- Respect platlib by default on platforms that have it separated from purelib.\n- Upgrade packaging to 15.3.\n  - Normalize post-release spellings for rev/r prefixes.\n- Upgrade distlib to 0.2.1.\n  - Updated launchers to decode shebangs using UTF-8.

(#2731)\n- Accept --no-binary and --only-binary via pip.conf. (#2867)\n- Allow ``--allow-all-external`` within a requirements file.\n- Fixed an issue where ``--user`` could not be used when ``--prefix`` was used\n  in a distutils configuration file.\n- Fixed an issue where the SOABI tags were not correctly being generated on\n  Python 3.5.\n- Fixed an issue where we were advising windows users to upgrade by directly\n  executing pip, when that would always fail on Windows.\n- Allow ``~`` to be expanded within a cache directory in all situations.\n\n\n7.0.3 (2015-06-01)\n==================\n\n- Fixed a regression where ``--no-cache-dir`` would raise an exception. (#2855)\n\n\n7.0.2 (2015-06-01)\n==================\n\n- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Revert the change (released in v7.0.0) that\n  required quoting in requirements files around specifiers containing\n  environment markers. (#2841)\n- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Revert the accidental introduction of support for\n  options interleaved with requirements, version specifiers etc in\n  ``requirements`` files. (#2841)\n- Expand ``~`` in the cache directory when caching wheels. (#2816)\n- Use ``python -m pip`` instead of ``pip`` when recommending an upgrade command\n  to Windows users.\n\n\n7.0.1 (2015-05-22)\n==================\n\n- Don't build and cache wheels for non-editable installations from VCSs.\n- Allow ``--allow-all-external`` inside of a requirements.txt file, fixing a\n  regression in 7.0.\n\n\n7.0.0 (2015-05-21)\n==================\n\n- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Removed the deprecated ``--mirror``,\n  ``--use-mirrors``, and ``-M`` options.\n- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Removed the deprecated ``zip`` and ``unzip``\n  commands.\n- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Removed the deprecated ``--no-install`` and\n  ``--no-download`` options.\n- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** No longer implicitly support an insecure origin\n  origin, and instead require insecure origins be explicitly trusted with the\n  ``--trusted-host`` option.\n- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Removed the deprecated link scraping that attempted\n  to parse HTML comments for a specially formatted comment.\n- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Requirements in requirements files containing\n  markers must now be quoted due to parser changes.  For example, use\n  ``\"SomeProject; python_version < '2.7'\"``, not simply\n  ``SomeProject; python_version < '2.7'`` (#2697, #2725)\n- `get-pip.py` now installs the \"wheel\" package, when it's not already\n  installed. (#2800)\n- Ignores bz2 archives if Python wasn't compiled with bz2 support. (#497)\n- Support ``--install-option`` and ``--global-option`` per requirement in\n  requirement files.

(#2618)\n- Allow fine grained control over the use of wheels and source builds. (#2699)\n- ``--no-use-wheel`` and ``--use-wheel`` are deprecated in favour of new\n  options ``--no-binary`` and ``--only-binary``. The equivalent of\n  ``--no-use-wheel`` is ``--no-binary=:all:``. (#2699)\n- The use of ``--install-option``, ``--global-option`` or ``--build-option``\n  disable the use of wheels, and the autobuilding of wheels. (#2711, #2677)\n- Improve logging when a requirement marker doesn't match your environment.\n  (#2735)\n- Removed the temporary modifications (that began in pip v1.4 when distribute\n  and setuptools merged) that allowed distribute to be considered a conflict to\n  setuptools. ``pip install -U setuptools`` will no longer upgrade \"distribute\"\n  to \"setuptools\".  Instead, use ``pip install -U distribute``. (#2767)\n- Only display a warning to upgrade pip when the newest version is a final\n  release and it is not a post release of the version we already have\n  installed. (#2766)\n- Display a warning when attempting to access a repository that uses HTTPS when\n  we don't have Python compiled with SSL support.

(#2785)\n- Fix an infinite loop when the cache directory is stored on a file system\n  which does not support hard links. (#2796)\n- Remove the implicit debug log that was written on every invocation, instead\n  users will need to use ``--log`` if they wish to have one. (#2798)\n\n\n6.1.1 (2015-04-07)\n==================\n\n- No longer ignore dependencies which have been added to the standard library,\n  instead continue to install them.\n\n\n6.1.0 (2015-04-07)\n==================\n\n- Fixes upgrades failing when no potential links were found for dependencies\n  other than the current installation. (#2538, #2502)\n- Use a smoother progress bar when the terminal is capable of handling it,\n  otherwise fallback to the original ASCII based progress bar.\n- Display much less output when `pip install` succeeds, because on success,\n  users probably don't care about all the nitty gritty details of compiling and\n  installing. When `pip install` fails, display the failed install output once\n  instead of twice, because once is enough. (#2487)\n- Upgrade the bundled copy of requests to 2.6.0, fixing CVE-2015-2296.\n- Display format of latest package when using ``pip list --outdated``. (#2475)\n- Don't use pywin32 as ctypes should always be available on Windows, using\n  pywin32 prevented uninstallation of pywin32 on Windows. (:pull:`2467`)\n- Normalize the ``--wheel-dir`` option, expanding out constructs such as ``~``\n  when used. (#2441)\n- Display a warning when an undefined extra has been requested. (#2142)\n- Speed up installing a directory in certain cases by creating a sdist instead\n  of copying the entire directory. (#2535)\n- Don't follow symlinks when uninstalling files (#2552)\n- Upgrade the bundled copy of cachecontrol from 0.11.1 to 0.11.2.

The common cases should all function\n  similarly to before.\n- **DEPRECATION** ``pip install --download-cache`` and\n  ``pip wheel --download-cache`` command line flags have been deprecated and\n  the functionality removed. Since pip now automatically configures and uses\n  it's internal HTTP cache which supplants the ``--download-cache`` the\n  existing options have been made non functional but will still be accepted\n  until their removal in pip v8.0. For more information please see\n  https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install.html#caching\n- **DEPRECATION** ``pip install --build`` and ``pip install --no-clean`` are now\n  *NOT* deprecated.  This reverses the deprecation that occurred in v1.5.3.\n  (#906)\n- **DEPRECATION** Implicitly accessing URLs which point to an origin which is\n  not a secure origin, instead requiring an opt-in for each host using the new\n  ``--trusted-host`` flag (``pip install --trusted-host example.com foo``).\n- Allow the new ``--trusted-host`` flag to also disable TLS verification for\n  a particular hostname.\n- Added a ``--user`` flag to ``pip freeze`` and ``pip list`` to check the\n  user site directory only.\n- Silence byte compile errors when installation succeed. (#1873)\n- Added a virtualenv-specific configuration file. (#1364)\n- Added site-wide configuration files.

(#1606, #1369)\n- Add ``--client-cert`` option for SSL client certificates. (#1424)\n- `pip show --files` was broken for wheel installs. (#1635, #1484)\n- install_lib should take precedence when reading distutils config.\n  (#1642, #1641)\n- Send `Accept-Encoding: identity` when downloading files in an attempt to\n  convince some servers who double compress the downloaded file to stop doing\n  so. (#1688)\n- Stop breaking when given pip commands in uppercase (#1559, #1725)\n- pip no longer adds duplicate logging consumers, so it won't create duplicate\n  output when being called multiple times. (#1618, #1723)\n- `pip wheel` now returns an error code if any wheels fail to build. (#1769)\n- `pip wheel` wasn't building wheels for dependencies of editable requirements.\n  (#1775)\n- Allow the use of ``--no-use-wheel`` within a requirements file. (#1859)\n- Attempt to locate system TLS certificates to use instead of the included\n  CA Bundle if possible. (#1680, #1866)\n- Allow use of Zip64 extension in Wheels and other zip files.

(#798, #1060, #1926)\n- Disabled warning about insecure index host when using localhost. Based off of\n  Guy Rozendorn's work in #1718. (#1456, #1967)\n- Allow the use of OS standard user configuration files instead of ones simply\n  based around ``$HOME``. (#2021)\n- When installing directly from wheel paths or urls, previous versions were not\n  uninstalled. (#1825, #804, #1838)\n- Detect the location of the ``.egg-info`` directory by looking for any file\n  located inside of it instead of relying on the record file listing a\n  directory. (#2075, #2076)\n- Use a randomized and secure default build directory when possible.\n  (#1964, #1935, #676, #2122, CVE-2014-8991)\n- Support environment markers in requirements.txt files. (#1433, #2134)\n- Automatically retry failed HTTP requests by default. (#1444, #2147)\n- Handle HTML Encoding better using a method that is more similar to how\n  browsers handle it. (#1100, #1874)\n- Reduce the verbosity of the pip command by default. (#2175, #2177, #2178)\n- Fixed :issue:`2031` - Respect sys.executable on OSX when installing from\n  Wheels.\n- Display the entire URL of the file that is being downloaded when downloading\n  from a non PyPI repository.

Thanks Daniel Holth,\n  Marcus Smith, Paul Moore, and Michele Lacchia (#845)\n- Applied security patch to pip's ssl support related to certificate DNS\n  wildcard matching (https://bugs.python.org/issue17980).\n- To satisfy pip's setuptools requirement, pip now recommends setuptools>=0.8,\n  not distribute. setuptools and distribute are now merged into one project\n  called 'setuptools'. (#1003)\n- pip will now warn when installing a file that is either hosted externally to\n  the index or cannot be verified with a hash. In the future pip will default\n  to not installing them and will require the flags --allow-external NAME, and\n  --allow-insecure NAME respectively. (#985)\n- If an already-downloaded or cached file has a bad hash, re-download it rather\n  than erroring out. (#963)\n- ``pip bundle`` and support for installing from pybundle files is now\n  considered deprecated and will be removed in pip v1.5.\n- Fix a number of issues related to cleaning up and not reusing build\n  directories.

(#131)\n- Added `--root` option for \"pip install\" to specify root directory. Behaves\n  like the same option in distutils but also plays nice with pip's egg-info.\n  Thanks Przemek Wrzos. (#253, #693)\n\n\n1.2.1 (2012-09-06)\n==================\n\n- Fixed a regression introduced in 1.2 about raising an exception when\n  not finding any files to uninstall in the current environment. Thanks for\n  the fix, Marcus Smith.\n\n\n1.2 (2012-09-01)\n================\n\n- **Dropped support for Python 2.4** The minimum supported Python version is\n  now Python 2.5.\n- Fixed PyPI mirror support being broken on some DNS responses. Thanks\n  philwhin. (#605)\n- Fixed pip uninstall removing files it didn't install.

(#3)\n- Prevent e.g. ``gmpy2-2.0.tar.gz`` from matching a request to\n  ``pip install gmpy``; sdist filename must begin with full project name\n  followed by a dash. Thanks casevh for the report. (#510)\n- Allow package URLS to have querystrings. Thanks W. Trevor King. (#504)\n- pip freeze now falls back to non-editable format rather than blowing up if it\n  can't determine the origin repository of an editable. Thanks Rory McCann.\n  (#58)\n- Added a `__main__.py` file to enable `python -m pip` on Python versions\n  that support it. Thanks Alexey Luchko.\n- Fixed upgrading from VCS url of project that does exist on index. Thanks\n  Andrew Knapp for the report. (#487)\n- Fix upgrade from VCS url of project with no distribution on index.\n  Thanks Andrew Knapp for the report. (#486)\n- Add a clearer error message on a malformed VCS url.

(#82)\n- Only warn about version conflicts if there is actually one. This re-enables\n  using ``==dev`` in requirements files. (#436)\n- Moved tests to be run on Travis CI: https://travis-ci.org/pypa/pip\n- Added a better help formatter.\n\n\n1.1 (2012-02-16)\n================\n\n- Don't crash when a package's setup.py emits UTF-8 and then fails. Thanks\n  Marc Abramowitz. (#326)\n- Added ``--target`` option for installing directly to arbitrary directory.\n  Thanks Stavros Korokithakis.\n- Added support for authentication with Subversion repositories. Thanks\n  Qiangning Hong.\n- ``--download`` now downloads dependencies as well. Thanks Qiangning Hong.\n  (#315)\n- Errors from subprocesses will display the current working directory.\n  Thanks Antti Kaihola.\n- Fixed  compatibility with Subversion 1.7. Thanks Qiangning Hong. Note that\n  setuptools remains incompatible with Subversion 1.7; to get the benefits of\n  pip's support you must use Distribute rather than setuptools. (#369)\n- Ignore py2app-generated macOS mpkg zip files in finder. Thanks Rene Dudfield.\n  (#57)\n- Log to ~/Library/Logs/ by default on macOS framework installs. Thanks\n  Dan Callahan for report and patch. (#182)\n- Understand version tags without minor version (\"py3\") in sdist filenames.\n  Thanks Stuart Andrews for report and Olivier Girardot for patch. (#310)\n- pip now supports optionally installing setuptools \"extras\" dependencies; e.g.\n  \"pip install Paste[openid]\". Thanks Matt Maker and Olivier Girardot. (#7)\n- freeze no longer borks on requirements files with --index-url or --find-links.\n  Thanks Herbert Pfennig. (#391)\n- Handle symlinks properly. Thanks lebedov for the patch. (#288)\n- pip install -U no longer reinstalls the same versions of packages. Thanks\n  iguananaut for the pull request. (#49)\n- Removed ``-E``/``--environment`` option and ``PIP_RESPECT_VIRTUALENV``;\n  both use a restart-in-venv mechanism that's broken, and neither one is\n  useful since every virtualenv now has pip inside it.  Replace ``pip -E\n  path/to/venv install Foo`` with ``virtualenv path/to/venv &&\n  path/to/venv/pip install Foo``.\n- Fixed pip throwing an IndexError when it calls `scraped_rel_links`. (#366)\n- pip search should set and return a useful shell status code. (#22)\n- Added global ``--exists-action`` command line option to easier script file\n  exists conflicts, e.g. from editable requirements from VCS that have a\n  changed repo URL. (#351, #365)\n\n\n1.0.2 (2011-07-16)\n==================\n\n- Fixed docs issues.\n- Reinstall a package when using the ``install -I`` option. (#295)\n- Finds a Git tag pointing to same commit as origin/master. (#283)\n- Use absolute path for path to docs in setup.py. (#279)\n- Correctly handle exceptions on Python3. (#314)\n- Correctly parse ``--editable`` lines in requirements files. (#320)\n\n\n1.0.1 (2011-04-30)\n==================\n\n- Start to use git-flow.\n- `find_command` should not raise AttributeError. (#274)\n- Respect Content-Disposition header. Thanks Bradley Ayers. (#273)\n- pathext handling on Windows. (#233)\n- svn+svn protocol. (#252)\n- multiple CLI searches. (#44)\n- Current working directory when running setup.py clean. (#266)\n\n\n1.0 (2011-04-04)\n================\n\n- Added Python 3 support! Huge thanks to Vinay Sajip, Vitaly Babiy, Kelsey\n  Hightower, and Alex Gronholm, among others.\n- Download progress only shown on a real TTY. Thanks Alex Morega.\n- Fixed finding of VCS binaries to not be fooled by same-named directories.\n  Thanks Alex Morega.\n- Fixed uninstall of packages from system Python for users of Debian/Ubuntu\n  python-setuptools package (workaround until fixed in Debian and Ubuntu).\n- Added `get-pip.py <https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py>`_\n  installer. Simply download and execute it, using the Python interpreter of\n  your choice::\n\n    $ curl -O https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py\n    $ python get-pip.py\n\n  This may have to be run as root.\n\n  .. note::\n\n      Make sure you have `distribute <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute>`_\n      installed before using the installer!\n\n\n0.8.3\n=====\n\n- Moved main repository to GitHub: https://github.com/pypa/pip\n- Transferred primary maintenance from Ian to Jannis Leidel, Carl Meyer,\n  Brian Rosner\n- Fixed no uninstall-on-upgrade with URL package. Thanks Oliver Tonnhofer.\n  (#14)\n- Fixed egg name not properly resolving. Thanks Igor Sobreira. (#163)\n- Fixed Non-alphabetical installation of requirements. Thanks Igor Sobreira.\n  (#178)\n- Fixed documentation mentions --index instead of --index-url. Thanks\n  Kelsey Hightower (#199)\n- rmtree undefined in mercurial.py. Thanks Kelsey Hightower. (#204)\n- Fixed bug in Git vcs backend that would break during reinstallation.\n- Fixed bug in Mercurial vcs backend related to pip freeze and branch/tag\n  resolution.\n- Fixed bug in version string parsing related to the suffix \"-dev\".\n\n\n0.8.2\n=====\n\n- Avoid redundant unpacking of bundles (from pwaller)\n- Fixed checking out the correct tag/branch/commit when updating an editable\n  Git requirement. (#32, #150, #161)\n- Added ability to install version control requirements without making them\n  editable, e.g.::\n\n    pip install git+https://github.com/pypa/pip/\n\n  (#49)\n- Correctly locate build and source directory on macOS. (#175)\n- Added ``git+https://`` scheme to Git VCS backend.\n\n\n0.8.1\n=====\n\n- Added global --user flag as shortcut for --install-option=\"--user\". From\n  Ronny Pfannschmidt.\n- Added support for `PyPI mirrors <http://pypi.python.org/mirrors>`_ as\n  defined in `PEP 381 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0381/>`_, from\n  Jannis Leidel.\n- Fixed git revisions being ignored. Thanks John-Scott Atlakson. (#138)\n- Fixed initial editable install of github package from a tag failing. Thanks\n  John-Scott Atlakson. (#95)\n- Fixed installing if a directory in cwd has the same name as the package\n  you're installing. (#107)\n- --install-option=\"--prefix=~/.local\" ignored with -e. Thanks\n  Ronny Pfannschmidt and Wil Tan. (#39)\n\n\n0.8\n===\n\n- Track which ``build/`` directories pip creates, never remove directories\n  it doesn't create.  From Hugo Lopes Tavares.\n- pip now accepts file:// index URLs. Thanks Dave Abrahams.\n- Various cleanup to make test-running more consistent and less fragile.\n  Thanks Dave Abrahams.\n- Real Windows support (with passing tests). Thanks Dave Abrahams.\n- ``pip-2.7`` etc. scripts are created (Python-version specific scripts)\n- ``contrib/build-standalone`` script creates a runnable ``.zip`` form of\n  pip, from Jannis Leidel\n- Editable git repos are updated when reinstalled\n- Fix problem with ``--editable`` when multiple ``.egg-info/`` directories\n  are found.\n- A number of VCS-related fixes for ``pip freeze``, from Hugo Lopes Tavares.\n- Significant test framework changes, from Hugo Lopes Tavares.\n\n\n0.7.2\n=====\n\n- Set zip_safe=False to avoid problems some people are encountering where\n  pip is installed as a zip file.\n\n\n0.7.1\n=====\n\n- Fixed opening of logfile with no directory name. Thanks Alexandre Conrad.\n- Temporary files are consistently cleaned up, especially after\n  installing bundles, also from Alex Conrad.\n- Tests now require at least ScriptTest 1.0.3.\n\n\n0.7\n===\n\n- Fixed uninstallation on Windows\n- Added ``pip search`` command.\n- Tab-complete names of installed distributions for ``pip uninstall``.\n- Support tab-completion when there is a global-option before the\n  subcommand.\n- Install header files in standard (scheme-default) location when installing\n  outside a virtualenv. Install them to a slightly more consistent\n  non-standard location inside a virtualenv (since the standard location is\n  a non-writable symlink to the global location).\n- pip now logs to a central location by default (instead of creating\n  ``pip-log.txt`` all over the place) and constantly overwrites the\n  file in question. On Unix and macOS this is ``'$HOME/.pip/pip.log'``\n  and on Windows it's ``'%HOME%\\\\pip\\\\pip.log'``. You are still able to\n  override this location with the ``$PIP_LOG_FILE`` environment variable.\n  For a complete (appended) logfile use the separate ``'--log'`` command line\n  option.\n- Fixed an issue with Git that left an editable package as a checkout of a\n  remote branch, even if the default behaviour would have been fine, too.\n- Fixed installing from a Git tag with older versions of Git.\n- Expand \"~\" in logfile and download cache paths.\n- Speed up installing from Mercurial repositories by cloning without\n  updating the working copy multiple times.\n- Fixed installing directly from directories (e.g.\n  ``pip install path/to/dir/``).\n- Fixed installing editable packages with ``svn+ssh`` URLs.\n- Don't print unwanted debug information when running the freeze command.\n- Create log file directory automatically. Thanks Alexandre Conrad.\n- Make test suite easier to run successfully. Thanks Dave Abrahams.\n- Fixed \"pip install .\" and \"pip install ..\"; better error for directory\n  without setup.py. Thanks Alexandre Conrad.\n- Support Debian/Ubuntu \"dist-packages\" in zip command. Thanks duckx.\n- Fix relative --src folder. Thanks Simon Cross.\n- Handle missing VCS with an error message. Thanks Alexandre Conrad.\n- Added --no-download option to install; pairs with --no-install to separate\n  download and installation into two steps. Thanks Simon Cross.\n- Fix uninstalling from requirements file containing -f, -i, or\n  --extra-index-url.\n- Leftover build directories are now removed. Thanks Alexandre Conrad.\n\n\n0.6.3\n=====\n\n- Fixed import error on Windows with regard to the backwards compatibility\n  package\n\n0.6.2\n=====\n\n- Fixed uninstall when /tmp is on a different filesystem.\n- Fixed uninstallation of distributions with namespace packages.\n\n\n0.6.1\n=====\n\n- Added support for the ``https`` and ``http-static`` schemes to the\n  Mercurial and ``ftp`` scheme to the Bazaar backend.\n- Fixed uninstallation of scripts installed with easy_install.\n- Fixed an issue in the package finder that could result in an\n  infinite loop while looking for links.\n- Fixed issue with ``pip bundle`` and local files (which weren't being\n  copied into the bundle), from Whit Morriss.\n\n\n0.6\n===\n\n- Add ``pip uninstall`` and uninstall-before upgrade (from Carl Meyer).\n- Extended configurability with config files and environment variables.\n- Allow packages to be upgraded, e.g., ``pip install Package==0.1``\n  then ``pip install Package==0.2``.\n- Allow installing/upgrading to Package==dev (fix \"Source version does not\n  match target version\" errors).\n- Added command and option completion for bash and zsh.\n- Extended integration with virtualenv by providing an option to\n  automatically use an active virtualenv and an option to warn if no active\n  virtualenv is found.\n- Fixed a bug with pip install --download and editable packages, where\n  directories were being set with 0000 permissions, now defaults to 755.\n- Fixed uninstallation of easy_installed console_scripts.\n- Fixed uninstallation on macOS Framework layout installs\n- Fixed bug preventing uninstall of editables with source outside venv.\n- Creates download cache directory if not existing.\n\n\n0.5.1\n=====\n\n- Fixed a couple little bugs, with git and with extensions.\n\n\n0.5\n===\n\n- Added ability to override the default log file name (``pip-log.txt``)\n  with the environmental variable ``$PIP_LOG_FILE``.\n- Made the freeze command print installed packages to stdout instead of\n  writing them to a file. Use simple redirection (e.g.\n  ``pip freeze > stable-req.txt``) to get a file with requirements.\n- Fixed problem with freezing editable packages from a Git repository.\n- Added support for base URLs using ``<base href='...'>`` when parsing\n  HTML pages.\n- Fixed installing of non-editable packages from version control systems.\n- Fixed issue with Bazaar's bzr+ssh scheme.\n- Added --download-dir option to the install command to retrieve package\n  archives. If given an editable package it will create an archive of it.\n- Added ability to pass local file and directory paths to ``--find-links``,\n  e.g. ``--find-links=file:///path/to/my/private/archive``\n- Reduced the amount of console log messages when fetching a page to find a\n  distribution was problematic. The full messages can be found in pip-log.txt.\n- Added ``--no-deps`` option to install ignore package dependencies\n- Added ``--no-index`` option to ignore the package index (PyPI) temporarily\n- Fixed installing editable packages from Git branches.\n- Fixes freezing of editable packages from Mercurial repositories.\n- Fixed handling read-only attributes of build files, e.g. of Subversion and\n  Bazaar on Windows.\n- When downloading a file from a redirect, use the redirected\n  location's extension to guess the compression (happens specifically\n  when redirecting to a bitbucket.org tip.gz file).\n- Editable freeze URLs now always use revision hash/id rather than tip or\n  branch names which could move.\n- Fixed comparison of repo URLs so incidental differences such as\n  presence/absence of final slashes or quoted/unquoted special\n  characters don't trigger \"ignore/switch/wipe/backup\" choice.\n- Fixed handling of attempt to checkout editable install to a\n  non-empty, non-repo directory.\n\n\n0.4\n===\n\n- Make ``-e`` work better with local hg repositories\n- Construct PyPI URLs the exact way easy_install constructs URLs (you\n  might notice this if you use a custom index that is\n  slash-sensitive).\n- Improvements on Windows (from `Ionel Maries Cristian\n  <https://ionelmc.wordpress.com/>`_).\n- Fixed problem with not being able to install private git repositories.\n- Make ``pip zip`` zip all its arguments, not just the first.\n- Fix some filename issues on Windows.\n- Allow the ``-i`` and ``--extra-index-url`` options in requirements\n  files.\n- Fix the way bundle components are unpacked and moved around, to make\n  bundles work.\n- Adds ``-s`` option to allow the access to the global site-packages if a\n  virtualenv is to be created.\n- Fixed support for Subversion 1.6.\n\n\n0.3.1\n=====\n\n- Improved virtualenv restart and various path/cleanup problems on win32.\n- Fixed a regression with installing from svn repositories (when not\n  using ``-e``).\n- Fixes when installing editable packages that put their source in a\n  subdirectory (like ``src/``).\n- Improve ``pip -h``\n\n\n0.3\n===\n\n- Added support for editable packages created from Git, Mercurial and Bazaar\n  repositories and ability to freeze them. Refactored support for version\n  control systems.\n- Do not use ``sys.exit()`` from inside the code, instead use a\n  return.  This will make it easier to invoke programmatically.\n- Put the install record in ``Package.egg-info/installed-files.txt``\n  (previously they went in\n  ``site-packages/install-record-Package.txt``).\n- Fix a problem with ``pip freeze`` not including ``-e svn+`` when an\n  svn structure is peculiar.\n- Allow ``pip -E`` to work with a virtualenv that uses a different\n  version of Python than the parent environment.\n- Fixed Win32 virtualenv (``-E``) option.\n- Search the links passed in with ``-f`` for packages.\n- Detect zip files, even when the file doesn't have a ``.zip``\n  extension and it is served with the wrong Content-Type.\n- Installing editable from existing source now works, like ``pip\n  install -e some/path/`` will install the package in ``some/path/``.\n  Most importantly, anything that package requires will also be\n  installed by pip.\n- Add a ``--path`` option to ``pip un/zip``, so you can avoid zipping\n  files that are outside of where you expect.\n- Add ``--simulate`` option to ``pip zip``.\n\n\n0.2.1\n=====\n\n- Fixed small problem that prevented using ``pip.py`` without actually\n  installing pip.\n- Fixed ``--upgrade``, which would download and appear to install\n  upgraded packages, but actually just reinstall the existing package.\n- Fixed Windows problem with putting the install record in the right\n  place, and generating the ``pip`` script with Setuptools.\n- Download links that include embedded spaces or other unsafe\n  characters (those characters get %-encoded).\n- Fixed use of URLs in requirement files, and problems with some blank\n  lines.\n- Turn some tar file errors into warnings.\n\n\n0.2\n===\n\n- Renamed to ``pip``, and to install you now do ``pip install\n  PACKAGE``\n- Added command ``pip zip PACKAGE`` and ``pip unzip PACKAGE``.  This\n  is particularly intended for Google App Engine to manage libraries\n  to stay under the 1000-file limit.\n- Some fixes to bundles, especially editable packages and when\n  creating a bundle using unnamed packages (like just an svn\n  repository without ``#egg=Package``).\n\n\n0.1.4\n=====\n\n- Added an option ``--install-option`` to pass options to pass\n  arguments to ``setup.py install``\n- ``.svn/`` directories are no longer included in bundles, as these\n  directories are specific to a version of svn -- if you build a\n  bundle on a system with svn 1.5, you can't use the checkout on a\n  system with svn 1.4.  Instead a file ``svn-checkout.txt`` is\n  included that notes the original location and revision, and the\n  command you can use to turn it back into an svn checkout.  (Probably\n  unpacking the bundle should, maybe optionally, recreate this\n  information -- but that is not currently implemented, and it would\n  require network access.)\n- Avoid ambiguities over project name case, where for instance\n  MyPackage and mypackage would be considered different packages.\n  This in particular caused problems on Macs, where ``MyPackage/`` and\n  ``mypackage/`` are the same directory.\n- Added support for an environmental variable\n  ``$PIP_DOWNLOAD_CACHE`` which will cache package downloads, so\n  future installations won't require large downloads.  Network access\n  is still required, but just some downloads will be avoided when\n  using this.\n\n\n0.1.3\n=====\n\n- Always use ``svn checkout`` (not ``export``) so that\n  ``tag_svn_revision`` settings give the revision of the package.\n- Don't update checkouts that came from ``.pybundle`` files.\n\n\n0.1.2\n=====\n\n- Improve error text when there are errors fetching HTML pages when\n  seeking packages.\n- Improve bundles: include empty directories, make them work with\n  editable packages.\n- If you use ``-E env`` and the environment ``env/`` doesn't exist, a\n  new virtual environment will be created.\n- Fix ``dependency_links`` for finding packages.\n\n\n0.1.1\n=====\n\n- Fixed a NameError exception when running pip outside of a virtualenv\n  environment.\n- Added HTTP proxy support (from Prabhu Ramachandran)\n- Fixed use of ``hashlib.md5`` on python2.5+ (also from Prabhu Ramachandran)\n\n\n0.1\n===\n\n- Initial release\n"
