          "content": "Changelog\n=========\n\n2024.06.0 - 2024-06\n-------------------\n\nFor full details see the [releases page](https://mailu.io/2024.06/releases.html)\n\nFor the upgrade create a new docker-compose.yml file and mailu.env file via setup.mailu.io. After that any old settings can be reapplied to mailu.env. Before making any changes, carefully read the [configuration reference](https://mailu.io/2.0/configuration.html). New settings have been introduced and some settings have been removed. Multiple changes have been made to the docker-compose.yml file and mailu.env file. If Tika is enabled, then 1GB to 2GB of extra memory is required.\n\nBefore starting the new Mailu deployment, check the following two topics:\nPOSTFIX_LOG_FILE has been deprecated and is ignored by Mailu. If POSTFIX_LOG_FILE was used, then refer to the the new FAQ entry `How can I view and export the logs of a Mailu container?` how to configure similar functionality.\n\nIf a reverse proxy is used on the same host, consider switching to traefik using the updated instructions. Refer to `Using an external reverse proxy` on mailu.io. With these updated instructions Mailu will handle requesting all certificates. It is not required anymore to copy certificates from the reverse proxy to Mailu.\n\nAfter starting the new Mailu deployment, check the following two topics.\nThe dovecot full-text-search indexes should be recreated:\nFrom `bash` run:\n```\nfind /mailu/mail -type d -name xapian-indexes -prune -exec rm -r {} \\+\n```\nVia docker compose run (to force reindexing):\n```\ndocker compose exec imap doveadm fts rescan -A\ndocker compose exec imap doveadm user '*'|while read u; do echo \"re-indexing $u\";docker compose exec -T imap doveadm index -u $u '*'; done\n```\n\nCheck if the the hardened memory allocator can be enabled.\nView the admin container logs via `docker compose logs admin`\n```\nWARNING:root:Your CPU has Advanced Vector Extensions available, we recommend you enable hardened-malloc earlier in the boot process by adding LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libhardened_malloc.so to your mailu.env\n```\n\n**Only** if the above message is logged, then the hardened malloc can be enabled sooner by adding the following line to `mailu.env`.\n```\nLD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libhardened_malloc.so\n```\nRecreate all docker containers (`docker compose up -d`) for the changes to be propagated.\n\n\nPlease note that once you have upgraded to 2024.06, you won't be able to roll-back to earlier versions.\n\n\n- Features: Introduce new settings for configuring proxying and TLS. Disable POP3, IMAP and SUBMISSION by default, see https://nostarttls.secvuln.info/\n  - Drop TLS_FLAVOR=mail-*\n  - Change the meaning of PROXY_PROTOCOL, introduce PORTS\n  - Disable POP3, IMAP and SUBMISSION ports by default, to re-enable ensure PORTS include 110, 143 and 587\n  - MANAGESIEVE with implicit TLS is not a thing clients support... so 4190 is enabled by default. ([#3061](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/3061))\n- Features: Add belarusian translation ([#3207](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/3207))\n- Features: Add support for managesieve ([#81](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/81))\n- Features: Enhance RESTful API user retrieval with quota used bytes. This is the current size of the user's email box in bytes. ([#2824](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2824))\n- Features: Implement a feature to force users to change their password\n  Prune all active sessions of users when their password is changed ([#2877](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2877))\n- Features: Add ukrainian translation ([#2936](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2936))\n- Features: Add Traditional Chinese translation ([#2948](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2948))\n- Features: Enhance RESTful API with functionality for managing authentication tokens of users ([#2974](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2974))\n- Features: Add \"download zonefile\" button to domain configuration and un-split dkim key in dns table ([#3023](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/3023))\n- Features: Ensure that we encourage users to also pin ISRG X2 in their TLSA records ([#3191](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/3191))\n- Bugfixes: Letsencrypt only works if port 80 is reachable. Users behind reverse-proxies don't read instructions... this makes the common misconfiguration work too. ([#2720](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2720))\n- Bugfixes: Fix breaking bug in config-import command line command.\n  Import yml's containing dkim keys (the element 'dkim_key:') failed to import using `config-import`.

LD_PRELOAD may have already been removed from ENV ([#2789](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2789))\n- Bugfixes: The SMTP container wasn't logging things like it should\n  The health-check of dovecot was creating zombies\n  Document that COMPRESSION=zstd is now possible (see #2139) ([#2793](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2793))\n- Bugfixes: Allow other supported languages in Roundcube's spellchecker ([#2798](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2798))\n- Bugfixes: Improve auth-related logging ([#2803](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2803))\n- Bugfixes: Fix SCAN_MACROS: OLETOOLS wasn't always enabled/disabled like it should have been ([#2805](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2805))\n- Bugfixes: Healthcheck of clamav image created zombie processes ([#2811](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2811))\n- Bugfixes: Don't send out of office messages to no\\-?reply@ ([#2823](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2823))\n- Bugfixes: Authentication failed for email clients when the password contained a non latin-1 character. ([#2837](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2837))\n- Bugfixes: Increase the number of postfix workers, this should reduce the number of time Mailu replies with \"451 4.3.2 Internal server error\". To be clear, well behaved MTAs will retry so no email have been lost. ([#2869](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2869))\n- Bugfixes: Setup:\n  Regular expression for checking the Mailu storage path was invalid.\n  Added checks to make sure JavaScript is enabled and that all JS files could be loaded. The setup site malfunctions if this is not the case.\n  Added server side validation of entered values in setup.\n  Simplified setup by removing the settings for configuring the WEB_* settings. Advanced users can still modify mailu.env. ([#2890](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2890))\n- Bugfixes: Fix GPG operations from Roundcube - calling gpg with full path was blocked ([#2892](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2892))\n- Bugfixes: Switch the admin container from port 80 to port 8080. This should solve issues related to capabilities not working as expected\n  Document that systemd-resolve may need to be configured to validate DNSSEC\n  Ensure that dovecot is not attempting to bind a v6 socket if SUBNET6 is not configured ([#2906](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2906))\n- Bugfixes: Moving emails to the Junk folder may have created zombies (rspamc)\n  Ensure that the spam reporting works even if the email isn't COPYed to the mailbox ([#2908](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2908))\n- Bugfixes: Ensure that we delete any pre-exising PID files\n  Make Rspamd retry for longer when connecting to clamav ([#2917](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2917))\n- Bugfixes: fix fetchmail when used with POP3: disregard \"folders\" ([#2928](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2928))\n- Bugfixes: Upgrade to alpine 3.18.4: this will fix a bug whereby musl wasn't retrying using TCP when it received truncated DNS replies from its upstream. In practice, this has been seen in the wild when postfix complains of:\n\n  \"Host or domain name not found. Name service error for name=outlook-com.olc.protection.outlook.com type=AAAA: Host found but no data record of requested type\" ([#2934](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2934))\n- Bugfixes: forbidden_file_extension.map could not be overridden.

([#2937](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2937))\n- Bugfixes: Fixed log filter not filtering out log messages for dovecot/nginx/postfix.\n  Fixed postfix not logging to standard out.\n  Fixed not all containers logging to journald.\n  Removed POSTFIX_LOG_FILE functionality. Added documentation on how to achieve the same (log to file) via journald & rsyslogd (see new FAQ entry 'How can I view and export the logs of a Mailu container?'). ([#2939](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2939))\n- Bugfixes: Upgrade webmails: roundcube 1.6.3, rcmcarddav 5.1.0, snappymail 2.28.4 ([#2945](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2945))\n- Bugfixes: Update hardened malloc as the original package is not available from alpine anymore.\n  The newer version of hardened malloc requires AVX2: Disable it by default at startup and hint in the logs when it should be enabled instead.\n  Upgrade snappymail to v2.29.1 ([#2959](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2959))\n- Bugfixes: Fix letsencrypt on master ([#2962](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2962))\n- Bugfixes: - Switch from fts-xapian to fts-flatcurve. This should address the problem with indexes getting too big and will be the default in dovecot 2.4\n  - Enable full-text search of email attachments if configured (via Tika: you'll need to re-run setup)\n\n  If you would like more than english to be supported, please ensure you update your FULL_TEXT_SEARCH configuration variable.\n\n  You may also want to dispose of old indexes using a command such as:\n\n  find /mailu/mail -type d -name xapian-indexes -prune -exec rm -r {} \\+\n\n  And proactively force a reindexing using:\n\n  docker compose exec imap doveadm fts rescan -A\n  docker compose exec imap doveadm user '*'|while read u; do docker compose exec imap doveadm index -u $u '*'; done ([#2971](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2971))\n- Bugfixes: Ensure that we do not silently discard PUAs flagged by clamav. Instead we will reject emails. ([#3048](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/3048))\n- Bugfixes: Slow down the turtle policy (see #3075) ([#3075](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/3075))\n- Bugfixes: Ensure we do not block logins from webmails when there is a valid SSO session ([#3094](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/3094))\n- Bugfixes: Ensure that the form validator related to forwarding addresses allows for uppercase ([#3095](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/3095))\n- Bugfixes: Long term fix against SMTP smuggling (disable bare_newline), see https://www.postfix.org/smtp-smuggling.html ([#3101](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/3101))\n- Bugfixes: Add required quotes to traefik-certdumper to ensure that shell characters are usable.

In the old system, all files were placed in the Rspamd overrides folder.\n  These overrides would override everything, including the Mailu Rspamd config.\n\n  Now overrides are placed in /overrides.\n  If you use your own map files, change the location to /override/myMapFile.map in the corresponding conf file.\n  It works as following.\n  * If the override file overrides a Mailu defined config file,\n    it will be included in the Mailu config file with lowest priority.\n    It will merge with existing sections.\n  * If the override file does not override a Mailu defined config file,\n    then the file will be placed in the rspamd local.d folder.\n    It will merge with existing sections.\n\n  For more information, see the description of the local.d folder on the rspamd website:\n  https://www.rspamd.com/doc/faq.html#what-are-the-locald-and-overrided-directories ([#2555](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2555))\n- Features: Adds a button to the roundcube interface that gets you back to the admin interface ([#2591](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2591))\n- Features: Drop postfix rsyslog localhost messages with IPv6 address ([#2594](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2594))\n- Features: Isolate radicale and webmail on their own network. This ensures they don't have privileged access to any of the other containers. ([#2613](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2613))\n- Features: Improved IPv6 support ([#2630](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/2630))\n- Features: Provide a changelog for minor releases. The github release will now:\n  * Provide the changelog message from the newsfragment of the PR that triggered the backport.\n  * Provide a github link to the PR/issue of the PR that was backported.\n\n  Switch to building multi-arch images. The images build for pull requests, master and production\n  are now multi-arch images for the architectures:\n  * linux/amd64\n  * linux/arm64/v8\n  * linux/arm/v7\n\n  Enhance CI/CD workflow with retry functionality. All steps for building images are now automatically\n  retried. If a build temporarily fails due to a network error, the retried step will still succeed.

Please note that once you have upgraded to 1.9 you won't be able to roll-back to earlier versions without resetting user passwords.\n\nIf you use a reverse proxy in front of Mailu, it is vital to configure the newly introduced env variables REAL_IP_HEADER and REAL_IP_FROM.\nThese settings tell Mailu that the HTTP header with the remote client IP address from the reverse proxy can be trusted.\nFor more information see the [configuration reference](https://mailu.io/1.9/configuration.html#advanced-settings).\n\nOne major change for the docker compose file is that the antispam container needs a fixed hostname [#1837](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1837).\nThis is handled when you regenerate the docker compose file. A fixed hostname is required to retain rspamd history.\n\nAfter changing mailu.env, it is required to recreate all containers for the changes to be propagated.\n\nPlease note that the shipped image for PostgreSQL database is fully deprecated now. To migrate to the official PostgreSQL image, you can follow our guide [here](https://mailu.io/master/database.html#mailu-postgresql)\n\n- Features: Document how to setup client autoconfig using an override ([#224](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/224))\n- Features: Add support for timezones ([#1154](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1154))\n- Features: Ensure that RCVD_NO_TLS_LAST doesn't add to the spam score (as TLS usage can't be determined) ([#1705](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1705))\n- Features: Add support for ECDSA certificates when letsencrypt is used. This means dropping compatibility for android < 4.1.1\n  Add LETSENCRYPT_SHORTCHAIN to your configuration to avoid sending ISRG Root X1 (this will break compatibility with android < 7.1.1)\n  Disable AUTH command on port 25\n  Disable TLS tickets, reconfigure the cache to improve Forward Secrecy\n  Prevent clear-text credentials from being sent to relays ([#1922](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1922))\n- Features: Improved the SSO page. Warning! The new endpoints /sso and /static are introduced.\n  These endpoints are now used for handling sign on requests and shared static files.\n  You may want to update your reverse proxy to proxy /sso and /static to Mailu (to the front service).\n  The example section of using a reverse proxy is updated with this information.\n   - New SSO page is used for logging in Admin or Webmail.\n   - Made SSO page available separately. SSO page can now be used without Admin accessible (ADMIN=false).\n   - Introduced stub /static which is used by all sites for accessing static files.\n   - Removed the /admin/ prefix to reduce complexity of routing with Mailu. Admin is accessible directly via /admin instead of /admin/ui\n  Note: Failed logon attempts are logged in the logs of admin. You can watch this with fail2ban. ([#1929](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1929))\n- Features: Make unbound work with ipv6\n  Add a cache-min-ttl of 5minutes\n  Enable qname minimisation (privacy) ([#1992](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/issues/1992))\n- Features: Disable the login page if SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE is incompatible with how Mailu is accessed as this seems to be a common misconfiguration.

E.g. 1.8.0, 1.8.1 etc.\n    - docker repo will contain x.y (latest) and x.y.z (pinned version) images.\n    - The X.Y.Z tag is incremented automatically. E.g. if 1.8.0 already exists, then the next merge on 1.8 will result in the new tag 1.8.1 being used.\n  - Make the version available in the image.\n    -  For X.Y and X.Y.Z write the version (X.Y.Z) into /version on the image and add a label with version=X.Y.Z\n  \t  -  This means that the latest X.Y image shows the pinned version (X.Y.Z e.g. 1.8.1) it was based on. Via the tag X.Y.Z you can see the commit hash that triggered the built.\n    -  For master write the commit hash into /version on the image and add a label with version={commit hash}\n  -  Automatic releases. For x.y triggered builts (e.g. merge on 1.9) do a new github release for the pinned x.y.z (e.g. 1.9.2).\n    -  Release shows a static message (see RELEASE_TEMPLATE.md) that explains how to reach the newsfragments folder and change the branch to the tag (x.y.z) mentioned in the release. Now you can get the changelog by reading all newsfragment files in this folder.

The bug report should follow the issue template and provide clear replication steps and logs.\nFor **user-support questions**, reach out to us  on [matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#mailu:tedomum.net) or [disussions](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/discussions/categories/user-support).\n\nFor anything but bug reports use the [matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#mailu:tedomum.net) or [disussions](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/discussions).\nSo use discussions for topics such as\n\n* Checking announcements.\n* General discussion about Mailu usage or using Mail software in general.\n* Feature requests\n* User support.\n\nTo be able to help you best, we need some more information.\n\nBefore you open your issue\n- Check if no issue or pull-request for this already exists.\n- Check [documentation](https://mailu.io/master/) and [FAQ](https://mailu.io/master/faq.html). (Tip, use the search function on the documentation page)\n- You understand `Mailu` is made by volunteers in their **free time** — be concise, civil and accept that delays can occur.\n- The title of the issue should be short and simple. It should contain specific terms related to the actual issue. Be specific while writing the title.\n- You understand issues are only meant for bug reports that follow the issue template. Non bug reports or bug reports that do not follow the template will be moved to [disussions](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/discussions)\n\nPlease put your text outside of the comment blocks to be visible. You can use the button \"Preview\" above to check.\n\nIf you do not follow the issue template suggested below your issue may be summarily closed.\n\n-->\n\n## Environment & Version\n\n- `docker compose version`\n- Version: `master`\n\n<!--\nTo find your version, get the image name of a mailu container and read  the version from the tag (example for version 1.7).\n\n$> docker ps -a | grep mailu\n140b09d4b09c    mailu/roundcube:1.7    \"docker-php-entrypoi…\"    2 weeks ago    Up 2 days (healthy)    80/tcp\n$> grep MAILU_VERSION docker-compose.yml mailu.env\n-->\n\nIf you are not using docker compose do not file any new issue here.\nKubernetes related issues belong to https://github.com/Mailu/helm-charts/issues\nIf you are not using docker compose or kubernetes, create a new thread on user support in [disussions](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/discussions/categories/user-support).\nNon-bug reports (or bug reports that do not follow the template) are moved to [disussions](https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/discussions).\n\n## Description\n<!--\nFurther explain the bug in a few words.

To update your Mailu installation simply pull the latest images `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`.\nThe pinned version X.Y.Z (e.g. 2.1.1) is not updated. It is pinned to the commit that was used for creating this release. You can use a pinned version to make sure your Mailu installation is not suddenly updated when recreating containers. The pinned version allows the user to manually update. It also allows to go back to a previous pinned version.\n\nTo check what was changed:\n- Go to https://github.com/Mailu/Mailu/tree/master/towncrier/newsfragments\n- Change the branch to the tag of this release.\n- Read the news fragment files to check what was changed.\n\nThe release notes of the original release can be accessed via menu item 'Release notes' on [mailu.io](https://mailu.io/).\n"
