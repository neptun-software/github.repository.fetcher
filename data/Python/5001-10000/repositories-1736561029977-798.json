Whether it's a bug report, new feature, correction, or additional\ndocumentation, we greatly value feedback and contributions from our community.\n\nPlease read through this document before submitting any issues or pull requests to ensure we have all the necessary\ninformation to effectively respond to your bug report or contribution.\n\n## Table of Contents\n1. [Reporting Bugs/Feature Requests](#Reporting)\n2. [Contributing via Pull Requests](#Pulls)\n4. [Linking External Example](#Extern)\n5. [Style and Formatting](#Style)\n6. [Finding Contributions to Work On](#Finding)\n7. [Adding Learning Resources](#Resources)\n8. [Code of Conduct](#CoC)\n9. [Security Issue Notifications](#Security)\n10. [Licensing](#License)\n\n## Reporting Bugs/Feature Requests <a name=\"Reporting\"></a>\n\nWe welcome you to use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs or suggest features.\n\nWhen filing an issue, please check [existing open](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cdk-examples/issues), or [recently closed](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cdk-examples/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20), issues to make sure somebody else hasn't already reported the issue. Please try to include as much information as you can. Details like these are incredibly useful:\n\n* A reproducible test case or series of steps\n* The version of our code being used\n* Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug\n* Anything unusual about your environment or deployment\n\n## Contributing via Pull Requests <a name=\"Pulls\"></a>\nContributions via pull requests are much appreciated. Before sending us a pull request, please ensure that:\n\n1. You are working against the latest source on the *master* branch.\n2. You check existing open, and recently merged, pull requests to make sure someone else hasn't addressed the problem already.\n\nTo send us a pull request, please:\n\n1. Fork the repository.\n2. Modify the source; please focus on the specific change you are contributing. If you also reformat all the code, it will be hard for us to focus on your change.\n4. Ensure your example passes `cdk synth` or indicate in the PR why it does not. \n3. Ensure local tests pass automated tests (check the [scripts](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cdk-examples/tree/master/scripts) directory)\n4. Commit to your fork using clear commit messages.\n5. Send us a pull request, answering any default questions in the pull request interface.\n6. Pay attention to any automated CI failures reported in the pull request, and stay involved in the conversation.\n\nGitHub provides additional document on [forking a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and\n[creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).\n\n### Added Value\nAs an official learning resource, it is important that any new examples add value to our learning resources. This means that it should not duplicate an existing example, and cover one of the following topics:\n\n* Document a common infrastructure pattern - _(static website, cron triggered lambda, etc.)_\n* Outline usage of an L2 construct\n* Cover a less-obvious implementation of one or more constructs - _(cross-stack resource sharing, escape hatches, using SSM values during synthesis, etc.)_\n\nWhen we are considering merging a new contribution we will review the above criteria as well as evaluating quality based on the criteria in the following sections.\n\n### Components\n\nWhen adding a new example, there are several required components. The majority of these will be added when running `cdk init`.\n\n1. General Structure\n\nThe best way to create the structure for the new example to be added is to run `npx cdk init app --language [LANGUAGE]` on an empty directory with the example name. This will generate all language-specific components needed for your new example. Please keep the suggested structure for the application (eg. typescript apps start in `./bin/example-name.ts`, and store the stack/s in `./lib/example-name-stack.ts`).\n\nWhen submitting the PR, please ensure that the directory includes all relevant package manager and configuration files so that someone else viewing it only needs to run the build commands and `cdk deploy` to get the example running.\n\n2. `README.md`\n\nEvery example needs a comprehensive README at the root of its directory. This README can vary depending on the example, but has several required components:\n  - Stability Banner: You can use the banner code below to indicate whether an example consists of modules that are \"Stable\", \"Dev-Preview\", or \"Cfn-Only\" (for more information on state, see the [Module Lifecycle guide](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk-rfcs/blob/master/text/0107-construct-library-module-lifecycle.md). Please reference the lowest common denominator (if all modules are stable except for one that is dev-preview, you must mark the example as dev-preview)\n\n    - __Stable__\n```md\n<!--BEGIN STABILITY BANNER-->\n---\n\n![Stability: Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-Stable-success.svg?style=for-the-badge)\n\n> **This is a stable example. It should successfully build out of the box**\n>\n> This example is built on Construct Libraries marked \"Stable\" and does not have any infrastructure prerequisites to build.\n---\n<!--END STABILITY BANNER-->\n```\n\n- __Dev Preview__\n```md\n<!--BEGIN STABILITY BANNER-->\n---\n\n![Stability: Developer Preview](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-Developer--Preview-important.svg?style=for-the-badge)\n\n> **This is an experimental example. It may not build out of the box**\n>\n> This example is built on Construct Libraries marked \"Developer Preview\" and may not be updated for latest breaking changes.\n>\n> It may additionally requires infrastructure prerequisites that must be created before successful build.\n>\n> If build is unsuccessful, please create an [issue](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cdk-examples/issues/new) so that we may debug the problem \n---\n<!--END STABILITY BANNER-->\n```\n\n  - Overview: This should be a description of the example including, but not limited to, an overview of resources being created in the example, a description of any standard/common patterns being used, as well as the overall function of the example.\n  - Structure: If the example is more complex than a single stack, or the stack contains more than a couple resources, please describe the structure of application being deployed. This can be as simple as a bulleted list of resources, or as intricate as a complete infrastructure diagram.\n  - Build/Deploy: Finally, the README must include the basic build/deploy instructions required for that example in said language.\n\n### Linking External Examples <a name=\"Extern\"></a>\n\nIf you have an example project that is out of scope or too large for this repo based on the criteria listed above, but you still think it would be a good learning resource for CDK users, you may contribute it to this repo as an external link.\n\nSimply create a Pull Request to the README of this repo, adding the link to your repo in the [\"Additional Examples\" section](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cdk-examples#AddEx). The pull request can be used to discuss the function and content of the linked repo with the CDK team and other contributors. If the repo is not a learning resource, but rather a tool or library based-on, or for use with the CDK consider requesting it be added to the [Awesome CDK repo](https://github.com/kolomied/awesome-cdk).\n\n## Style and Formatting <a name=\"Style\"></a>\n\nWe strive to keep examples consistent in style and formatting. This hopefully makes navigating examples easier for users. Since the examples span different languages, we try to keep example code as idiomatic as possible.\n\nNew guidelines for various languages will be added as we define them.\n\n### Typescript\n1. You can use [eslint](https://eslint.org/) with the standard configuration to check code syntax and style.\n\n### Java\n1. Use builders wherever possible. Some classes are unable to have builders generated in JSII but for those that do, prefer them over constructing by hand.\n2. Format your code with [google-java-format](https://github.com/google/google-java-format). If you're using visual studio code, [see this comment](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-java/issues/419#issuecomment-360820321) to get a formatter task setup.\n\n## Finding Contributions to Work On <a name=\"Finding\"></a>\nLooking at the existing issues is a great way to find something to contribute on. As our projects, by default, use the default GitHub issue labels (enhancement/bug/duplicate/help wanted/invalid/question/wontfix), looking at any ['help wanted'](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cdk-examples/labels/help%20wanted) issues is a great place to start.\n\n## Adding Learning Resources <a name=\"Resources\"></a>\nOn the main README of this repo, we maintain a shortlist of additional learning resources related to the CDK. The \"Officially Supported\" section will be maintained by CDK project maintainers, however if you have a resource (workshop, example-set, etc.) you think should be added to the list, create a PR with your reasoning for adding in the description and a CDK maintainer will discuss with you in PR reviews.\n\nWhen adding a resource (or external example), please make the same considerations you would for [adding a new example](#Pulls).\n\n## Code of Conduct <a name=\"CoC\"></a>\nThis project has adopted the [Amazon Open Source Code of Conduct](https://aws.github.io/code-of-conduct).\nFor more information see the [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://aws.github.io/code-of-conduct-faq) or contact\nopensource-codeofconduct@amazon.com with any additional questions or comments.\n\n\n## Security Issue Notifications <a name=\"Security\"></a>\nIf you discover a potential security issue in this project we ask that you notify AWS/Amazon Security via our [vulnerability reporting page](http://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting/). Please do **not** create a public github issue.\n\n\n## Licensing <a name=\"License\"></a>\n\nSee the [LICENSE](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cdk-examples/blob/master/LICENSE) file for our project's licensing. We will ask you to confirm the licensing of your contribution.\n\nWe may ask you to sign a [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement) for larger changes.\n"

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n"

[License](#License)\n\n## About this Repo <a name=\"About\"></a>\nThis repo is our official list of CDK example code. The repo is subdivided into sections for each language (see [\"Examples\"](#Examples)). Each language has its own subsection of examples with the ultimate aim of complete language parity (same subset of examples exist in each language). These examples each provide a demonstration of a common service implementation, or infrastructure pattern that could be useful in your use of the CDK for building your own infrastructure.\n\nWe welcome contributions to this repo in the form of fixes to existing examples or addition of new examples. For more information on contributing, please see the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cdk-examples/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.\n\nThis is considered an intermediate learning resource and should typically be referenced after reading the Developer Guide or CDK Workshop (please see [Learning Resources](#Learning) for more information on these resources).\n\n## Examples <a name=\"Examples\"></a>\nThis repo contains examples in each language supported by the CDK. Some languages are fully supported by [JSII](https://github.com/aws/jsii), but as additional languages are added, you will see those marked as `Developer Preview`. You can find the examples for each of those languages at the following links:\n\n| Language | JSII Language-Stability |\n|----------|-------------------------|\n| [Typescript Examples](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cdk-examples/tree/master/typescript) | _Stable_ |\n| [Python Examples](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cdk-examples/tree/master/python) | _Stable_ |\n| [.NET Examples](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cdk-examples/tree/master/csharp) | _Stable_ |\n| [Java Examples](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cdk-examples/tree/master/java) | _Stable_ |\n| [Go Examples](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cdk-examples/tree/master/go) | _Stable_ |\n\n\n## Learning Resources <a name=\"Learning\"></a>\nWhile this is an excellent learning resource for the CDK, there are other resources that can be referenced to assist with your learning/development process.\n\n### Official Resources\n- [Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/home.html)\n- [API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-construct-library.html)\n- [CDK Repository](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk)\n- [CDK Construct Hub](https://constructs.dev/)\n- [CDK Workshop](https://cdkworkshop.com/)\n\n### Unofficial/Community Resources\n- [AwesomeCDK](https://github.com/kolomied/awesome-cdk)\n\n> If you have created a CDK learning resource and would like it to be listed here, please read the related [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cdk-examples/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#Resources) section for more info.\n\n## Additional Examples <a name=\"AddEx\"></a>\n\nThe examples listed below are larger examples hosted in their own repositories that demonstrate more complex or complete CDK applications. \n>If you would like your repo to be listed here, please read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cdk-examples/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#Resources) guide for more details.\n\n| Example | Description | Owner |\n|---------|-------------|-------|\n| [aws-cdk-changelogs-demo](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cdk-changelogs-demo) | A full serverless Node.js application stack deployed using CDK.
