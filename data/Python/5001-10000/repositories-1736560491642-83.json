(You may already it installed. To see your version, use `python -V` at the command line.)\n- Install [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/install/). Some installation options:\n  - `brew install hatch`\n  - `pipx install hatch`\n\nAnd you'll need [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to run some validation checks:\n\n```bash\npipx install pre-commit\n# or `pip install pre-commit` if you have a virtualenv\n# or `brew install pre-commit`\n```\n\nYou can optionally install pre-commit hooks to automatically run the validation checks\nwhen making a commit:\n\n```bash\npre-commit install\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\n> As an alternative to building from source, you can try developing\n> [in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo).\n> Note that developing in Gitpod is not officially supported by the marimo\n> team.\n\n## Building from source\n\nBe sure to install the dependencies above before building from source.\n\n### Build from source\n\nAfter installing the dependencies, you can use either the traditional method (installing an editable wheel in your current venv) or use Hatch:\n\nTraditional method:\n\n```bash\nmake fe && make py\n```\n\nUsing Hatch:\n\n```bash\nmake fe\nhatch shell\n```\n\n`make fe` builds the frontend. `make py` does an [editable install](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/development_mode.html) of marimo, while `hatch shell` creates a Hatch environment with an editable install of marimo.\n\n(All `make` commands should be run in the project's root directory.)\n\n### Building from source, unminified\n\nTo build the frontend unminified, run:\n\n```bash\nNODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=8192 NODE_ENV=development make fe -B\n```\n\n## `make` commands\n\n| Command        | Category  | Description                                                    |\n| -------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `help`         | General   | Show this help                                                 |\n| `py`           | Setup     | Editable python install; only need to run once                 |\n| `install-all`  | Setup     | Install everything; takes a long time due to editable install  |\n| `fe`           | Build     | Package frontend into `marimo/`                                |\n| `fe-codegen`   | Build     | Build [api specification](./development_docs/openapi.md)       |\n| `wheel`        | Build     | Build wheel                                                    |\n| `check`        | Test      | Run all checks                                                 |\n| `check-test`   | Test      | Run all checks and tests                                       |\n| `test`         | Test      | Run all tests                                                  |\n| `fe-check`     | Lint/Test | Check frontend                                                 |\n| `fe-test`      | Test      | Test frontend                                                  |\n| `e2e`          | Test      | Test end-to-end                                                |\n| `fe-lint`      | Lint      | Lint frontend                                                  |\n| `fe-typecheck` | Lint      | Typecheck frontend                                             |\n| `py-check`     | Lint      | Check python                                                   |\n| `py-test`      | Test      | Test python                                                    |\n| `py-snapshots` | Test      | Update HTML snapshots                                          |\n| `storybook`    | Docs      | Run Storybook                                                  |\n| `docs`         | Docs      | Build docs.

Some changes\nshould also be accompanied by end-to-end tests.\n\nTo run all tests:\n\n```bash\nmake test\n```\n\nThis can take some time. To run just frontend tests, just Python tests, or just\nend-to-end tests, read below.\n\n### Frontend\n\nIn the root directory, run:\n\n```bash\nmake fe-test\n```\n\n### Python\n\nUsing Make:\n\n```bash\nmake py-test\n```\n\n#### Using Hatch\n\n**Run a specific tests.**\n\n```bash\nhatch run test:test tests/_ast/\n```\n\n**Run a specific test with optional dependencies.**\n\n```bash\nhatch run test-optional:test tests/_ast/\n```\n\n**Run tests with a specific Python version.**\n\n```bash\nhatch run +py=3.10 test:test tests/_ast/\n# or\nhatch run +py=3.10 test-optional:test tests/_ast/\n```\n\n**Run all tests across all Python versions.**\n\nNot recommended since it takes a long time.\n\n```bash\nhatch run test:test\n```\n\n### End-to-end\n\nWe use playwright to write and run end-to-end tests, which exercise both the\nmarimo library and the frontend.\n\n(The first time you run, you may be prompted by playwright to install some\ndependencies; follow those instructions.)\n\nFor best practices on writing end-to-end tests, check out the [Best Practices\ndoc](https://playwright.dev/docs/best-practices).\n\nFor frontend tests, you want to build the frontend first with `make fe` so that Playwright works on your latest changes.\n\n**Run end-to-end tests.**\n\nIn the root directory, run:\n\n```bash\nmake e2e\n```\n\n**Run tests interactively.**\n\nIn `frontend/`:\n\n```bash\npnpm playwright test --ui\n```\n\n**Run a specific test.**\n\nIn `frontend/`:\n\n```bash\npnpm playwright test <filename> --ui\n# e.g.\npnpm playwright test cells.test.ts --ui\n```\n\nor\n\n```bash\npnpm playwright test --debug <filename>\n```\n\n## Storybook\n\nTo open Storybook, run the following:\n\n```bash\ncd frontend/\npnpm storybook\n```\n\n## Hot reloading / development mode\n\nYou can develop on marimo with hot reloading on the frontend and/or development\nmode on the server (which automatically restarts the server on code changes).\nThese modes are especially helpful when you're making many small changes and\nwant to see changes end-to-end very quickly.\n\nFor the frontend, you can run either\n\n```bash\n# starts a dev server on localhost:3000 and proxy requests to your marimo server\n# has hot reloading and the fastest way to develop the frontend\n# read caveats below\npnpm dev\n```\n\n### OR\n\n```bash\n# OR, in order to test closer to production, you can build the frontend and watch for changes\npnpm build:watch\n```\n\nFor the backend, we recommend running without auth (`--no-token`):\n\n```bash\nmarimo edit --no-token\n# or in debug mode\nmarimo -d edit --no-token\n```\n\n- **When to run with hot-reloading?**: When you are developing on the frontend\n  and want to see changes immediately. This is useful for styling, layout, new\n  plugins, etc. Developing through the Vite server may have inconsistent\n  behavior due to proxied api/websocket request and since the marimo Python\n  server is not serving the HTML.\n- **When to develop with the frontend in watch mode?**: When you are making few\n  frontend changes, or when you want to test the frontend in a way that is\n  closer to production.\n- **When to run marimo CLI with development mode?**: When you are making\n  changes to the backend and want to see debug logs.\n  When developing on marimo plugins, you can run with \"On module change\" as \"autorun\" to see changes immediately.\n\n**Caveats for running `pnpm dev`**\n\nRunning `pnpm dev` will serve the frontend from a Vite dev server, not from the\nmarimo server. This means that:\n\n1. You will want to run your marimo server with `--headless` and `--no-token` so it does not open a new browser tab, as it will interfere with the frontend dev server.\n1. The tradeoff of using the frontend dev server is that it is faster to\n   develop on the frontend, but you will not be able to test the frontend in\n   the same way that it will be used in production.\n\n## Editor settings\n\nIf you use vscode, you might find the following `settings.json` useful:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"editor.formatOnSave\": true,\n  \"editor.formatOnPaste\": false,\n  \"[typescript]\": {\n    \"editor.defaultFormatter\": \"biomejs.biome\"\n  },\n  \"[typescriptreact]\": {\n    \"editor.defaultFormatter\": \"biomejs.biome\"\n  }\n}\n```\n"

          "content": "# **Governance Structure**\n\nThis document describes the formal governance structure of the marimo project.\n\n## **Mission**\n\nThe marimo project builds next-generation developer tools for working with\ndata that are reproducible and scalable, and that create easy-to-share\nartifacts. Our main project is the marimo notebook.\n\nmarimo is a reactive Python notebook: run a cell or interact with a UI\nelement, and marimo automatically runs dependent cells (or marks them as\nstale), keeping code and outputs consistent. marimo notebooks are stored as\npure Python, executable as scripts, and deployable as apps. marimo\nprovides a batteries-included programming environment designed specifically\nfor working with data. marimo aims to be easy to get started with, while\nproviding expressivity and extensibility for power users.\n\n## **Code of Conduct**\n\nThe marimo community strongly values inclusivity and diversity. Everyone should\ntreat others with the utmost respect. Everyone in the community must adhere to\nthe Code of Conduct specified in [the marimo GitHub\nrepository](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\nViolations of this code of conduct may be reported confidentially to Project\nMaintainers indicated at that link.\n\n## **Entities**\n\nThis section outlines the different entities that exist within the marimo project, their basic role, and how membership of each entity is determined.\n\n### **Benevolent Dictator For Life**\n\nDue to his role in the creation of marimo, [Akshay Agrawal](https://akshayagrawal.com/) holds the title of [Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life).\n\n### **Project Maintainers**\n\nProject Maintainers lead the technical development of the marimo project, and\nthey are the ultimate authority on the direction of the marimo project. The\ncurrent Project Maintainers are:\n\n- Akshay Agrawal ([@akshaya](https://github.com/akshayka))\n- Myles Scolnick ([@mscolnick](https://github.com/mscolnick))\n\nA new maintainer may be added by consensus of the current Project Maintainers\nand notification to the Steering Committee.\n\nBefore becoming a maintainer, it is expected that the community member will\nhave been an active participant in the development and maintenance of the marimo\nrepository for a sustained period of time. This includes triaging issues,\nproposing and reviewing pull requests, and updating continuous integration\nas needed.\n\n### **Emeritus Project Maintainers**\n\nEmeritus Project Maintainers are community members who were Project\nMaintainers, but have stepped back to a less active role. A Project Maintainer\nmay choose to switch to emeritus status by informing the other Project\nMaintainers and the Steering Committee.\n\n### **Steering Committee**\n\nThe Steering Committee supports the Project Maintainers by representing marimo\nin all administrative and legal capacities. In addition, the Steering\nCommittee:\n\n- Approves expenditures related to marimo.\n- Negotiates and approves contracts with external contractors who provide paid work to marimo.\n\nThe current members of the Steering Committee are:\n\n- Akshay Agrawal ([@akshaya](https://github.com/akshayka))\n- Myles Scolnick ([@mscolnick](https://github.com/mscolnick))\n\nA member of the Steering Committee may leave the committee by notifying the\nSteering Committee and Project Maintainers. The remaining Steering Committee\nmembers, in consultation with the Project Maintainers, will invite a member of\nthe community to join in order to maintain a quorum of five members.\n\n## **Decision Making Process**\n\nThis section outlines how financial and non-financial decisions are made in the\nmarimo project.\n\n### **Financial Decisions**\n\nAll financial decisions are made by the Steering Committee to ensure any funds\nare spent in a manner that furthers the mission of marimo. Financial decisions\nrequire majority approval by Steering Committee members.\n\nCommunity members proposing decisions with a financial aspect should contact\nthe Steering Committee directly.\n\n### **Non-financial Decisions**\n\nAll non-financial decisions are made via consensus of the Project Maintainers.\nEmeritus Project Maintainers are not considered to be Project Maintainers for\nthis purpose.\n\nCode-related decisions, such as when a pull request is ready to be accepted and\nmerged, should be discussed via the relevant GitHub issues and pull requests.\nIf consensus cannot be achieved, the community member proposing the change may\nbe invited by a project maintainer to present their proposal at a developer\ncall for further discussion and community input.\n\nChanges to any public API require explicit approval (in the form of an\n\"Approval\" on a GitHub review) from a majority of the Project Maintainers.\n\nNon-code-related decisions, such as long-term strategic planning for marimo,\nshould either be discussed in a GitHub issue, or tabled as an agenda item and\ndiscussed on a developer call.\n\nIf consensus on a non-financial decision cannot be achieved, the final decision\nwill be made by the BDFL.\n\nThe Steering Committee can gain additional decision-making power if the Project\nMaintainers decide to delegate.\n\n### **Conflict of Interest**\n\nIt is expected that community members will be employed at a wide range of\ncompanies, universities and non-profit organizations. Because of this, it is\npossible that members will have conflicts of interest. Such conflicts of\ninterest include, but are not limited to:\n\n- Financial interests, such as investments, employment or contracting work, outside of marimo that may influence their work on marimo.\n- Access to proprietary information of their employer that could potentially leak into their work with marimo.\n\nAll members of the Steering Committee shall disclose to the Steering Committee\nany conflict of interest they may have. Members with a conflict of interest in\na particular issue may participate in Steering Committee discussions on that\nissue, but must recuse themselves from voting.\n\nProject Maintainers and repository maintainers should also disclose conflicts\nof interest with other Project Maintainers and step back from decisions when\nconflicts of interests are in play.\n\n## **GitHub Permissions**\n\nGitHub permissions are used to control access to the marimo GitHub repository.\n\nAnyone with commit access to the repository is trusted to use it in a way that\nis consistent with the Decision Making Process. Those with permissions should\nprefer pull requests over direct pushes, ask for feedback on changes if they\nare not sure there is a consensus, and follow marimo’s [style\nguide](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and\ndevelopment processes.\n\n### **Project Maintainers**\n\nProject Maintainers are added as\n[Owners](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/permission-levels-for-an-organization#permission-levels-for-an-organization)\nof the marimo GitHub organization.\n\n### **Emeritus Project Maintainers**\n\nEmeritus Project Maintainers retain the same commit rights as Project\nMaintainers, unless they choose to surrender them.\n\n## **Community Involvement**\n\nThe marimo project highly values the contributions made by members of the\ncommunity. As an open-source project, marimo is both made for the community,\nand by the community.\n\nThere are three channels that marimo uses to engage with the community.\n\n### **Discord Server**\n\nDiscussions focused on marimo’s development are conducted on a [Discord Server](https://marimo.io/discord?ref=governance). The server is public but requires email verification.\n\nThe server consists of several channels with different permissions based on the\nconcept of Discord roles. The named roles are “Project Maintainer” and\n“Contributor.” The Project Maintainers have write access to all channels and\nalso have a private channel.\n\nIndividuals who have contributed significantly to the development of marimo,\nfor example by proposing and merging at least one substantial pull request, may\nbe invited to the Discord server as Contributors. Project Maintainers may grant\nthe Contributor role within Discord at their discretion, and may create\nadditional channels for specific long-term projects in marimo’s development.\n\n### **Developer Calls**\n\nThe Steering Committee hosts semiannual developer calls to discuss\nmarimo-related business.\n\nThe precise time of a given call is determined one month ahead of time by discussions on the “developer-calls” channel of the marimo Discord Server.\n"

Delete a cell and marimo scrubs its variables from program\nmemory, eliminating hidden state.\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marimo-team/marimo/main/docs/_static/reactive.gif\" width=\"700px\" />\n\n<a name=\"expensive-notebooks\"></a>\n\n**Compatible with expensive notebooks.** marimo lets you [configure the runtime\nto be\nlazy](https://docs.marimo.io/guides/configuration/runtime_configuration.html),\nmarking affected cells as stale instead of automatically running them. This\ngives you guarantees on program state while preventing accidental execution of\nexpensive cells.\n\n**Synchronized UI elements.** Interact with [UI\nelements](https://docs.marimo.io/guides/interactivity.html) like [sliders](https://docs.marimo.io/api/inputs/slider.html#slider),\n[dropdowns](https://docs.marimo.io/api/inputs/dropdown.html), [dataframe\ntransformers](https://docs.marimo.io/api/inputs/dataframe.html), and [chat\ninterfaces](https://docs.marimo.io/api/inputs/chat.html), and the cells that\nuse them are automatically re-run with their latest values.\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marimo-team/marimo/main/docs/_static/readme-ui.gif\" width=\"700px\" />\n\n**Interactive dataframes.** [Page through, search, filter, and\nsort](https://docs.marimo.io/guides/working_with_data/dataframes.html)\nmillions of rows blazingly fast, no code required.\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marimo-team/marimo/main/docs/_static/docs-df.gif\" width=\"700px\" />\n\n**Performant runtime.** marimo runs only those cells that need to be run by\nstatically analyzing your code.\n\n**Dynamic markdown and SQL.** Use markdown to tell dynamic stories that depend on\nPython data. Or build [SQL](https://docs.marimo.io/guides/working_with_data/sql.html) queries\nthat depend on Python values and execute them against dataframes, databases,\nCSVs, Google Sheets, or anything else using our built-in SQL engine, which\nreturns the result as a Python dataframe.\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marimo-team/marimo/main/docs/_static/readme-sql-cell.png\" width=\"700px\" />\n\nYour notebooks are still pure Python, even if they use markdown or SQL.\n\n**Deterministic execution order.** Notebooks are executed in a deterministic\norder, based on variable references instead of cells' positions on the page.\nOrganize your notebooks to best fit the stories you'd like to tell.\n\n**Built-in package management.** marimo has built-in support for all major\npackage managers, letting you [install packages on import](https://docs.marimo.io/guides/editor_features/package_management.html). marimo can even\n[serialize package\nrequirements](https://docs.marimo.io/guides/package_reproducibility.html)\nin notebook files, and auto install them in\nisolated venv sandboxes.\n\n**Batteries-included.** marimo comes with GitHub Copilot, AI assistants, Ruff\ncode formatting, HTML export, fast code completion, a [VS Code\nextension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marimo-team.vscode-marimo),\nan interactive dataframe viewer, and [many more](https://docs.marimo.io/guides/editor_features/index.html)\nquality-of-life features.\n\n## Quickstart\n\n**Installation.** In a terminal, run\n\n```bash\npip install marimo  # or conda install -c conda-forge marimo\nmarimo tutorial intro\n```\n\n**Create notebooks.**\n\nCreate or edit notebooks with\n\n```bash\nmarimo edit\n```\n\n**Run apps.** Run your notebook as a web app, with Python\ncode hidden and uneditable:\n\n```bash\nmarimo run your_notebook.py\n```\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marimo-team/marimo/main/docs/_static/docs-model-comparison.gif\" style=\"border-radius: 8px\" width=\"450px\" />\n\n**Execute as scripts.** Execute a notebook as a script at the\ncommand line:\n\n```bash\npython your_notebook.py\n```\n\n**Automatically convert Jupyter notebooks.** Automatically convert Jupyter\nnotebooks to marimo notebooks with the CLI\n\n```bash\nmarimo convert your_notebook.ipynb > your_notebook.py\n```\n\nor use our [web interface](https://marimo.io/convert).\n\n**Tutorials.**\nList all tutorials:\n\n```bash\nmarimo tutorial --help\n```\n\n## Questions?\n\nSee the [FAQ](https://docs.marimo.io/faq.html) at our docs.\n\n## Learn more\n\nmarimo is easy to get started with, with lots of room for power users.\nFor example, here's an embedding visualizer made in marimo\n([video](https://marimo.io/videos/landing/full.mp4)):\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marimo-team/marimo/main/docs/_static/embedding.gif\" width=\"700px\" />\n\nCheck out our [docs](https://docs.marimo.io),\nthe [`examples/`](examples/) folder, and our [gallery](https://marimo.io/gallery) to learn more.\n\n<table border=\"0\">\n  <tr>\n    <td>\n      <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.marimo.io/getting_started/key_concepts.html\">\n        <img src=\"https://docs.marimo.io/_static/reactive.gif\" style=\"max-height: 150px;

With marimo, we hope to provide the Python community with a\nbetter programming environment to do research and communicate it; to experiment\nwith code and share it; to learn computational science and teach it.\n\nOur inspiration comes from many places and projects, especially\n[Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl),\n[ObservableHQ](https://observablehq.com/tutorials), and\n[Bret Victor's essays](http://worrydream.com/). marimo is part of\na greater movement toward reactive dataflow programming. From\n[IPyflow](https://github.com/ipyflow/ipyflow), [streamlit](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit),\n[TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow),\n[PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/tree/main),\n[JAX](https://github.com/google/jax), and\n[React](https://github.com/facebook/react), the ideas of functional,\ndeclarative, and reactive programming are transforming a broad range of tools\nfor the better.\n\n<p align=\"right\">\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marimo-team/marimo/main/docs/_static/marimo-logotype-horizontal.png\" height=\"200px\">\n</p>\n"

href=\"#expensive-notebooks\">标记为过时单元格</a>），从而保持代码和输出的一致性。**marimo** 笔记本以纯 Python 格式存储，可作为脚本执行，也可作为应用程序部署。\n\n**为什么选择 marimo**\n\n- 🚀 **功能齐全:** 替代 `jupyter`、`streamlit`、`jupytext`、`ipywidgets`、`papermill` 等更多工具\n- ⚡️ **响应式**: 运行一个单元格，marimo 会响应式地[运行所有依赖单元格](https://docs.marimo.io/guides/reactivity.html) 或 <a href=\"#expensive-notebooks\">将它们标记为陈旧</a>\n- 🖐️ **交互性:** [绑定滑块、表格、图表等 UI 元素](https://docs.marimo.io/guides/interactivity.html) 到 Python——无需回调\n- 🔬 **可复现:** [无隐藏状态](https://docs.marimo.io/guides/reactivity.html#no-hidden-state)，确定性执行\n- 🏃‍♂️ **可执行:** [作为 Python 脚本执行](https://docs.marimo.io/guides/scripts.html)，通过命令行调整参数\n- 🛜 **可分享**: [部署为交互式 Web 应用](https://docs.marimo.io/guides/apps.html) 或 [幻灯片](https://docs.marimo.io/guides/apps.html#slides-layout)，[通过 WASM 在浏览器中运行](https://docs.marimo.io/guides/wasm.html)\n- 🛢️ **为数据设计**: 使用 [SQL](https://docs.marimo.io/guides/working_with_data/sql.html) 查询数据框和数据库，过滤和搜索 [数据框](https://docs.marimo.io/guides/working_with_data/dataframes.html)\n- 🐍 **支持 Git:** 笔记本以 `.py` 文件格式存储\n- ⌨️ **现代编辑器**: GitHub Copilot、AI 助手、vim 快捷键、变量浏览器，和 [更多功能](https://docs.marimo.io/guides/editor_features/index.html)\n\n```python\npip install marimo && marimo tutorial intro\n```\n\n_在浏览器中运行[在线体验平台](https://marimo.app/l/c7h6pz)！_\n\n_跳转到[快速起步](#快速起步)，了解命令行工具。_\n\n## 响应式编程环境\n\nMarimo 确保了您的代码、输出和程序的状态始的一致性，解决了与 Jupyter 等传统笔记本相关的许多[问题](https://docs.marimo.io/faq.html#faq-problems)。\n\n**独有的响应式设计**\n运行一个单元格，marimo 就会自动运行引用其变量的单元格，从而避免了手动重新运行单元格这一容易出错的工作。删除单元格，marimo 会从程序内存中删除其变量，消除隐藏状态。\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marimo-team/marimo/main/docs/_static/reactive.gif\" width=\"700px\" />\n\n<a name=\"expensive-notebooks\"></a>\n\n**与计算成本高昂的笔记兼容** marimo 允许你将运行时配置为 “懒惰”模式，将受影响的单元标记为过时单元，而不是自动运行它们。这样既能保证程序状态，又能防止意外执行昂贵的单元。\n\n**同步的 UI 元素** 与滑块、下拉菜单和数据框转换器等 UI 元素交互，使用这些元素的单元格会自动以最新值重新运行。\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marimo-team/marimo/main/docs/_static/readme-ui.gif\" width=\"700px\" />\n\n**高效运行** 通过静态分析代码，marimo 只运行需要运行的单元。\n\n**动态的 Markdown 与 SQL** 使用 Markdown 编写 Python 代码的输出动态进行更新的文档。同时，使用内置 [SQL](https://docs.marimo.io/guides/working_with_data/sql.html) 引擎，可创建依赖于 Python 值的 SQL 查询，并针对数据框、数据库、CSV、Google Sheets 或其他任何内容执行查询，SQL 引擎会将结果返回为 Python 数据框。\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marimo-team/marimo/main/docs/_static/readme-sql-cell.png\" width=\"700px\" />\n\n即使笔记本（notebook）使用了 markdown 或 SQL，它仍然是纯 Python 程序。\n\n**确定性的执行顺序** 笔记本的执行顺序是确定的，基于变量引用，而不是单元格在页面上的位置。根据你顺序逻辑来组织笔记本。\n\n**易用且强大** Marimo 集成了包括 GitHub Copilot、Ruff 代码格式化、HTML 导出、快速代码补全、[VSCode 扩展](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marimo-team.vscode-marimo)、交互式数据框查看器等非常有用的功能。\n\n## 快速起步\n\n**安装** 在终端运行以下代码：\n\n```bash\npip install marimo  # or conda install -c conda-forge marimo\nmarimo tutorial intro\n```\n\n**或者在 Gitpod 运行**\n\n单击此链接以在 Gitpod 工作区中打开存储库：\n\n[https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo)\n\n**创建新的笔记本**\n\n使用以下命令创建或编辑笔记本\n\n```bash\nmarimo edit\n```\n\n**运行应用** 将笔记本作为网络应用程序运行，隐藏 Python 代码，且不可编辑：\n\n```bash\nmarimo run your_notebook.py\n```\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marimo-team/marimo/main/docs/_static/docs-model-comparison.gif\" style=\"border-radius: 8px\" width=\"450px\" />\n\n**作为脚本执行**

If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.
