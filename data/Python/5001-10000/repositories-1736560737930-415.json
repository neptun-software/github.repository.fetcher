It introduces two important features which are crucial for advanced recommendation system: \n* collisionless embedding tables guarantees unique represeantion for different id features\n* real time training captures the latest hotspots and help users to discover new intersts rapidly\n\nMonolith is built on the top of TensorFlow and supports batch/real-time training and serving.\n\n\n## Discussion Group\n\n### Join us at Discord\n\nhttps://discord.gg/QYTDeKxGMX\n\n## Quick start\n\n### Build from source\n\nCurrently, we only support compilation on the Linux.\n\nFirst, download bazel 3.1.0\n```bash\nwget https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/download/3.1.0/bazel-3.1.0-installer-linux-x86_64.sh && \\\n  chmod +x bazel-3.1.0-installer-linux-x86_64.sh && \\\n  ./bazel-3.1.0-installer-linux-x86_64.sh && \\\n  rm bazel-3.1.0-installer-linux-x86_64.sh\n```\n\nThen, prepare a python environment\n```bash\npip install -U --user pip numpy wheel packaging requests opt_einsum\npip install -U --user keras_preprocessing --no-deps\n```\n\nFinally, you can build any target in the monolith.\nFor example,\n```bash\nbazel run //monolith/native_training:demo --output_filter=IGNORE_LOGS\n```\n\n### Demo and tutorials\n\nThere are a tutorial in [markdown/demo](markdown/demo) on how to run distributed async training, and few guides on how to use the `MonolithModel` API [here](markdown).
