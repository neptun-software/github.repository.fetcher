In the evaluation of data sets in semantics, mathematics, reasoning, code, and knowledge, **GLM-4-9B**\nand its human preference-aligned version **GLM-4-9B-Chat** have shown superior performance beyond Llama-3-8B. In\naddition to multi-round conversations, GLM-4-9B-Chat also has advanced features such as web browsing, code execution,\ncustom tool calls (Function Call), and long text reasoning (supporting up to 128K context).\nThis generation of models has added multi-language support, supporting 26 languages including Japanese, Korean,\nand German. We have also launched the **GLM-4-9B-Chat-1M** model that supports 1M\ncontext length (about 2 million Chinese characters) and the multimodal model GLM-4V-9B based on GLM-4-9B.\n**GLM-4V-9B** possesses dialogue capabilities in both Chinese and English at a high resolution of 1120*1120.\nIn various multimodal evaluations, including comprehensive abilities in Chinese and English, perception & reasoning,\ntext recognition, and chart understanding, GLM-4V-9B demonstrates superior performance compared to\nGPT-4-turbo-2024-04-09, Gemini 1.0 Pro, Qwen-VL-Max, and Claude 3 Opus.\n\n## Model List\n\n|        Model        | Type | Seq Length | Transformers Version |                                                                                                      Download                                                                                                       |                                                                                        Online Demo                                                                                         |\n|:-------------------:|:----:|:----------:|:--------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|\n|      GLM-4-9B       | Base |     8K     |  `4.44.0 -
