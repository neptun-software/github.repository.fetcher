See the [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)\nfor different ways to help and details about how this project handles them. Please make sure to read\nthe relevant section before making your contribution. It will make it a lot easier for us maintainers\nand smooth out the experience for all involved. The community looks forward to your contributions.\n\n> And if you like the project, but just don't have time to contribute, that's fine. There are other easy\n> ways to support the project and show your appreciation, which we would also be very happy about:\n> - Star the project\n> - Tweet about it\n> - Refer this project in your project's readme\n> - Mention the project at local meetups and tell your friends/colleagues\n\n<!-- omit in toc -->\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [I Have a Question](#i-have-a-question)\n- [I Want To Contribute](#i-want-to-contribute)\n  - [Reporting Bugs](#reporting-bugs)\n  - [Suggesting Enhancements](#suggesting-enhancements)\n  - [Your First Code Contribution](#your-first-code-contribution)\n  - [Improving The Documentation](#improving-the-documentation)\n- [Styleguides](#styleguides)\n  - [Commit Messages](#commit-messages)\n\n\n\n\n## I Have a Question\n\n> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available\n> [Documentation](https://github.com/andrewyng/aisuite/blob/main/README.md).\n\nBefore you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/andrewyng/aisuite/issues)\nthat might help you. If you find a relevant issue that already exists and still need clarification, please add your question to that existing issue. We also recommend reaching out to the community in the aisuite [Discord](https://discord.gg/T6Nvn8ExSb) server.\n\nIf you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:\n\n- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/andrewyng/aisuite/issues/new).\n- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.\n- Provide project and platform versions (python, OS, etc.), depending on what seems relevant.\n\nWe (or someone in the community) will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.\n\n\n## I Want To Contribute\n\n> ### Legal Notice <!-- omit in toc -->\n> When contributing to this project, you must agree that you have authored 100% of the content, that\n> you have the necessary rights to the content and that the content you contribute may be provided\n> under the project license.\n\n### Reporting Bugs\n\n<!-- omit in toc -->\n#### Before Submitting a Bug Report\n\nA good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask\nyou to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please\ncomplete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.\n\n- Make sure that you are using the latest version.\n- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment \n  components/versions (Make sure that you have read the [documentation](https://github.com/andrewyng/aisuite/blob/main/README.md).\n  If you are looking for support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).\n- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having,\n  check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](https://github.com/andrewyng/aisuite?q=label%3Abug).\n- Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside of the GitHub\n  community have discussed the issue.\n- Collect information about the bug:\n  - Stack trace (Traceback)\n  - OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)\n  - Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package manager, depending on\n    what seems relevant.\n  - Possibly your input and the output\n  - Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?\n\n<!-- omit in toc -->\n#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?\n\n> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to\n> the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to <joaquin.dominguez@proton.me>.\n<!-- You may add a PGP key to allow the messages to be sent encrypted as well. -->\n\nWe use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:\n\n- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/andrewyng/aisuite/issues/new). (Since we can't be sure at\n  this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.)\n- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.\n- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can\n  follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you\n  should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.\n- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.\n\nOnce it's filed:\n\n- The project team will label the issue accordingly.\n- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction \n  steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the\n  issue as `needs-repro`. Bugs with the `needs-repro` tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.\n- If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked `needs-fix`, as well as possibly other\n  tags (such as `critical`), and the issue will be left to be\n  [implemented by someone](#your-first-code-contribution).\n\nPlease use the issue templates provided.\n\n\n### Suggesting Enhancements\n\nThis section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for aisuite,\n**including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these\nguidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.\n\n<!-- omit in toc -->\n#### Before Submitting an Enhancement\n\n- Make sure that you are using the latest version.\n- Read the [documentation](https://github.com/andrewyng/aisuite/blob/main/README.md) carefully\n  and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.\n- Perform a [search](https://github.com/andrewyng/aisuite/issues) to see if the enhancement has\n  already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.\n- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong\n  case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just targeting a minority of users, consider writing an add-on/plugin library.\n\n<!-- omit in toc -->\n#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?\n\nEnhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/andrewyng/aisuite/issues).\n\n- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.\n- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.\n- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.\n  At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.\n- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most aisuite users. You may also want to\n  point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.\n\n\n### Your First Code Contribution\n\n#### Pre-requisites\n\nYou should first [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo)\nthe `aisuite` repository and then clone your forked repository:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USER>/aisuite.git\n```\n\n\n\nOnce in the cloned repository directory, make a branch on the forked repository with your username and\ndescription of PR:\n```bash\ngit checkout -B <username>/<description>\n```\n\nPlease install the development and test dependencies:\n```bash\npoetry install --with dev,test\n```\n\n`aisuite` uses pre-commit to ensure the formatting is consistent:\n```bash\npre-commit install\n```\n\n**Make suggested changes**\n\nAfterwards, our suite of formatting tests will run automatically before each `git commit`. You can also\nrun these manually:\n```bash\npre-commit run --all-files\n```\n\nIf a formatting test fails, it will fix the modified code in place and abort the `git commit`. After looking\nover the changes, you can `git add <modified files>` and then repeat the previous git commit command.\n\n**Note**: a github workflow will check the files with the same formatter and reject the PR if it doesn't\npass, so please make sure it passes locally.\n\n\n#### Testing\n`aisuite` tracks unit tests. Pytest is used to execute said unit tests in `tests/`:\n\n```bash\npoetry run pytest tests\n```\n\nIf your code changes implement a new function, please make a corresponding unit test to the `test/*` files.\n\n#### Contributing Workflow\nWe actively welcome your pull requests.\n\n1. Create your new branch from main in your forked repo, with your username and a name describing the work\n   you're completing e.g. user-123/add-feature-x.\n2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests. Ensure all tests pass. See the testing section\n   for more information.\n3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.\n4. Make sure your code lints.\n\n\n\n### Improving The Documentation\nWe welcome valuable contributions in the form of new documentation or revised documentation that provide\nfurther clarity or accuracy. Each function should be clearly documented. Well-documented code is easier\nto review and understand/extend.\n\n## Styleguides\nFor code documentation, please follow the [Google styleguide](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#38-comments-and-docstrings).\n"

Using an interface similar to OpenAI's, `aisuite` makes it easy to interact with the most popular LLMs and compare the results. It is a thin wrapper around python client libraries, and allows creators to seamlessly swap out and test responses from different LLM providers without changing their code. Today, the library is primarily focussed on chat completions. We will expand it cover more use cases in near future.\n\nCurrently supported providers are -\nOpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, Google, AWS, Groq, Mistral, HuggingFace Ollama, Sambanova and Watsonx.\nTo maximize stability, `aisuite` uses either the HTTP endpoint or the SDK for making calls to the provider.\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can install just the base `aisuite` package, or install a provider's package along with `aisuite`.\n\nThis installs just the base package without installing any provider's SDK.\n\n```shell\npip install aisuite\n```\n\nThis installs aisuite along with anthropic's library.\n\n```shell\npip install 'aisuite[anthropic]'\n```\n\nThis installs all the provider-specific libraries\n\n```shell\npip install 'aisuite[all]'\n```\n\n## Set up\n\nTo get started, you will need API Keys for the providers you intend to use. You'll need to\ninstall the provider-specific library either separately or when installing aisuite.\n\nThe API Keys can be set as environment variables, or can be passed as config to the aisuite Client constructor.\nYou can use tools like [`python-dotenv`](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) or [`direnv`](https://direnv.net/) to set the environment variables manually. Please take a look at the `examples` folder to see usage.\n\nHere is a short example of using `aisuite` to generate chat completion responses from gpt-4o and claude-3-5-sonnet.\n\nSet the API keys.\n\n```shell\nexport OPENAI_API_KEY=\"your-openai-api-key\"\nexport ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=\"your-anthropic-api-key\"\n```\n\nUse the python client.\n\n```python\nimport aisuite as ai\nclient = ai.Client()\n\nmodels = [\"openai:gpt-4o\", \"anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\"]\n\nmessages = [\n    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Respond in Pirate English.\"},\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Tell me a joke.\"},\n]\n\nfor model in models:\n    response = client.chat.completions.create(\n        model=model,\n        messages=messages,\n        temperature=0.75\n    )\n    print(response.choices[0].message.content)\n\n```\n\nNote that the model name in the create() call uses the format - `<provider>:<model-name>`.\n`aisuite` will call the appropriate provider with the right parameters based on the provider value.\nFor a list of provider values, you can look at the directory - `aisuite/providers/`. The list of supported providers are of the format - `<provider>_provider.py` in that directory. We welcome  providers adding support to this library by adding an implementation file in this directory. Please see section below for how to contribute.\n\nFor more examples, check out the `examples` directory where you will find several notebooks that you can run to experiment with the interface.\n\n## License\n\naisuite is released under the MIT License. You are free to use, modify, and distribute the code for both commercial and non-commercial purposes.\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you would like to contribute, please read our [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/andrewyng/aisuite/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/T6Nvn8ExSb) server!\n\n## Adding support for a provider\n\nWe have made easy for a provider or volunteer to add support for a new platform.\n\n### Naming Convention for Provider Modules\n\nWe follow a convention-based approach for loading providers, which relies on strict naming conventions for both the module name and the class name. The format is based on the model identifier in the form `provider:model`.\n\n- The provider's module file must be named in the format `<provider>_provider.py`.\n- The class inside this module must follow the format: the provider name with the first letter capitalized, followed by the suffix `Provider`.\n\n#### Examples\n\n- **Hugging Face**:\n  The provider class should be defined as:\n\n  ```python\n  class HuggingfaceProvider(BaseProvider)\n  ```\n\n  in providers/huggingface_provider.py.\n  \n- **OpenAI**:\n  The provider class should be defined as:\n\n  ```python\n  class OpenaiProvider(BaseProvider)\n  ```\n\n  in providers/openai_provider.py\n\nThis convention simplifies the addition of new providers and ensures consistency across provider implementations.\n"
