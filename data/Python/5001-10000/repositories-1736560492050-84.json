Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.

This is not a catalog of all the libraries, just a starting point for your explorations. Inspired by [awesome-python](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python). Other amazingly awesome lists can be found in the [awesome-awesomeness](https://github.com/bayandin/awesome-awesomeness) list.\n\nAlso awesome is [Scaladex](https://index.scala-lang.org/), the searchable, tagged, and centralized index of Scala libraries.\n\nProjects with over 500 stargazers are in bold.\n\n## Contributing\n\nYour contributions are always welcome! Please submit a pull request or create an issue to add a new framework, library or software to the list. Do not submit a project that hasn’t been updated in the past 6 months or is not awesome.\n\nDon't modify `README.md` in your pull request. It is automatically generated. Modify `template.md` instead.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Learning Scala](#learning-scala)\n- [Projects](#projects)\n    - [Android](#android)\n    - [Archive and Compression](#archive-and-compression)\n    -
