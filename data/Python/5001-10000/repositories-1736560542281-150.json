There are a bunch of colorschemes included with `pywal` and I will happily accept PRs to add more.\n\n- `wal --theme` lists all available built-in themes.\n- `wal --theme theme-name` applies a theme.\n- `wal --theme random` applies a theme at random.\n- Themes can be added locally at `~/.config/wal/colorschemes`.\n- `wal --theme` can be used with colorschemes exported in `json` format from https://terminal.sexy/.\n` wal --theme /path/to/file` loads a scheme from a file.\n\n## [1.3.3] - 2018-03-03\n\n- rofi: Added colon to template.\n- tty.sh: Cleanup.\n- sequences: Fixed terminal highlight colors.\n- templates: Added octal color format. @MitchWeaver\n- macOS: Fixed error with `.DS_Store` files. @blahsd\n- macOS: Disabled travis (*It's really broken*)\n\n\n## [1.3.2] - 2018-02-04\n\n- Fixed comment colors not being a shade of grey.\n- Added version to cache files.\n- Removed broken notifications.\n\n## [1.3.0] - 2018-02-03\n\n- Added light colorscheme support.\n    - Use `-l` to generate a light scheme.\n    - You can use `wal -R -l` (swap to light) and `wal -R` (swap to dark) to swap between light and dark.\n\n![scrot](https://i.imgur.com/VFzC7Vc.jpg)\n\n## [1.2.3] - 2018-02-01\n\n- Fixed typo in help. @gillescastel\n- Scheme files are now versioned.\n- Changed rofi theme to use the new `rasi` format.\n    - New instructions: https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal/wiki/Customization#rofi\n- Added light/dark themes for rofi.\n- Oomox is now **off** by default.\n    - `-g` now enables oomox.\n\n## [1.2.2] - 2018-01-09\n\n- Added `-g` to skip generating a theme with `oomox`.\n\n## [1.2.1] - 2018-01-08\n\nRemember to use wal -c after every release.\n\n- reload: Call oomox last so it doesn't block.\n\n## [1.2.0] - 2018-01-08\n\nRemember to use wal -c after every release.\n\n- Added support for `oomox`.\n    - See: https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal/wiki/Customization#gtk2gtk3\n- Removed support for `flatabulous-wal`.\n\n## [1.1.2] - 2018-01-07\n\nRemember to use `wal -c` after every release.\n\n- fixed bug related to palette sorting.\n- use color blending to create a better white.\n\n## [1.1.1] - 2018-01-06\n\nreload: Fixed permissions error.\n\n## [1.1.0] - 2018-01-03\n\n**general**\n\n- Added support for changing colors in linux `ttys`.\n- Fixed bug with transparency in urxvt.\n- Added `imagemagick display` as a wallpaper setter fallback.\n\n**api**\n\n- Added missing export options.\n\n**misc**\n\n- Code cleanup.\n- Minor optimizations.\n\n## [1.0.4] - 2017-12-31\n\n- reload: Fixed issue with rofi.\n- reload: Speed up `xrdb` by using `-nocpp`\n\n## [1.0.3] - 2017-12-31\n\n- shuffle: Better error handling\n- export: Added missing rofi option.\n\n## [1.0.2] - 2017-12-29\n\n- Add back `-r` for compatibility with `wpgtk`.\n    - It's still deprecated.\n    - An error message is still displayed.\n\n## [1.0.1] - 2017-12-29\n\n- colors: Improve background contrast.\n- colors: Improve forground brightness and contrast.\n- general: Fix `pywal` causing pc beeps.\n\n## [1.0.0] - 2017-12-27\n\n\\[[Installation](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal/wiki/Installation)\\] \\[[Getting Started](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal/wiki/Getting-Started)\\] \\[[Customization](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal/wiki/Customization)\\] \\[[Wiki](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal/wiki)\\]\n\n\nThis release of `pywal` contains some large changes and may very well break things for some users. Expect bugs and expect additional releases to fix them. The version has been bumped to `1.0.0` as I'm now happy with where `pywal` is feature-wise.\n\nThe goal for the future is improving the schemes that `pywal` generates. Feel free to send me your wallpapers that generate subpar schemes and I'll use them in my testing data.\n\n\n### Removal of `-r`\n\nThe flag `-r` was removed as it was basically a glorified `cat` of the `sequences` file with **300ms** of python overhead. The new recommended way to load the schemes is to replace `wal -r` with `cat ~/.cache/wal/sequences`.\n\n\n### Removal of `-t`\n\nYup! The `-t` flag to fix garbage in VTE terminals (termite, xfce4-terminal, gnome-terminal) is no longer needed. I've come up with a workaround that really **shouldn't work** but does. ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\nThe problem: The sequence  `\\033[708;#000000\\007` is unsupported by VTE and VTE's sequence parsing doesn't hide unknown sequences, instead it just displays them as plain text. We can't add an if statement or a check for VTE terminals as we're writing to each terminal via it's file descriptor. The only thing that is interpreted is escape sequences.\n\nThe workaround: The problem sequence is wrapped in a series of other escape sequences so that the unsupported sequence isn't echo'd to the terminal.\n\nHow it works:\n\n```\n# \\0337                # Save cursor position.\n# \\033[1000H           # Move the cursor off screen.\n# \\033[8m              # Conceal text.\n# \\033]708;#000000\\007 # Garbage sequence.\n# \\0338                # Restore cursor position.\n\n\\0337\\033[1000H\\033[8m\\033]708;#000000\\007\\0338\n```\n\nThis took a lot of trial and error to make sure it works across all terminals and doesn't cause issues for underlying terminal programs.\n\n\n### Added User Template Support\n\nYou can now define your own custom `pywal` template files or you can overwrite the default template files. Any files stored in `~/.config/wal/templates` will be processed and exported to `~/.cache/wal/` under the same name.\n\nThe user template files follow the exact same syntax as the built-in templates. See the built-in templates for syntax examples: https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal/tree/master/pywal/templates\n\nFor example: To define a custom `rofi` template file to set the background transparent.\n\nSave this file to `~/.config/wal/templates/colors-rofi.Xresources` and re-run wal. Rofi will now use the colors defined below instead.\n\n```\n#define BG #CC{background.strip}\n#define HI #CC{color1.strip}\n#define FG {color15}\n#define TX {color15}\n\n! State:           bg, fg, bg2,  hlbg, hlfg\nrofi.color-normal: BG, FG, BG,   HI,   TX\nrofi.color-active: BG, FG, BG,   HI,   TX\nrofi.color-urgent: BG, HI, BG,   HI,   FG\nrofi.color-window: BG, BG, BG\n```\n\n### Templates\n\n- Added template file for `rofi`.\n- Added template file for `st`.\n- Added template file for `tabbed`.\n- Added template file for `dwm`.\n\n\n### Args\n\n- Added `-s` to disable changing terminal colors on the fly.\n\n## [0.7.5] - 2017-12-19\n\n- Really fixed wallpaper bug.\n\n## [0.7.4] - 2017-12-19\n\n- Fixed wallpaper not changing in WMs.\n\n## [0.7.3] - 2017-12-17\n\n- Fixed lint error.\n\n## [0.7.2] - 2017-12-17\n\n- Fixed license file not appearing in release tarballs.\n- Fixed bug when using `pywal.reload.colors()`.\n- Fixed shuffle not working with some file types.\n- Fixed yaml error.\n- Fixed sway error.\n- Added sway wallpaper support.\n- Made wallpaper setting faster for WMs.\n\n## [0.7.0] - 2017-10-19\n\n- Fixed failing tests on macOS. @linuxunil\n- Added workaround for cursor color issues.\n- Use run instead of popen so that things are closed correctly. @linuxunil\n- Added resource file for Sway. @ranisalt\n- Set `fzf` colors.\n\n## [0.6.9] - 2017-08-27\n\n- sequences: Fix flash on color reload.\n\n## [0.6.8] - 2017-08-27\n\n- Fixed `File not found` error on Windows.\n\n## [0.6.7] - 2017-08-25\n\n- os: Added support for Windows.\n    - Cache dir on Windows is: `%UserProfile%\\.cache\\wal`\n    - Wallpaper setting works on un-activated Windows copies (*neat*).\n    - Note: Changing terminal colors doesn't work on Windows.\n- xres: Fixed URxvt border not having transparency applied. @JoshuaRLi\n- xres: Added `emacs` background/foreground. @adamsdarlingtower\n\n\n\n## [0.6.6] - 2017-08-16\n\n- reload: Fixed bug on macOS systems with XQuartz.\n\n## [0.6.4] - 2017-08-15\n\n- image: Fixed issue with relative file paths.\n\n## [0.6.3] - 2017-08-13\n\n- wallpaper: Remove useless print.\n\n## [0.6.2] - 2017-08-13\n\n- wallpaper: Fix `urllib` error when using GNOME or MATE.\n\n## [0.6.1] - 2017-08-13\n\n- wallpaper: Correctly encode file path to URI.\n\n## [0.6.0] - 2017-08-12\n\n- python: Added support for Python 3.5.\n- api: `Path` types are no longer accepted by the api.

It then applies the colors system-wide and on-the-fly in all of your favourite programs.  \n\nThere are currently 5 supported color generation backends, each providing a different palette of colors from each image. You're bound to find an appealing color-scheme.\n\nPywal also supports predefined themes and has over 250 themes built-in. You can also create your own theme files to share with others.\n\nThe goal of Pywal was to be as out of the way as possible. It doesn't modify any of your existing configuration files. Instead it works around them and provides tools to integrate your system as you see fit.\n\nTerminal emulators and TTYs have their color-schemes updated in real-time with no delay. With minimal configuration this functionality can be extended to almost anything running on your system.\n\n### More: \\[[Installation](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal/wiki/Installation)] \\[[Getting Started](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal/wiki/Getting-Started)] \\[[Customization](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal/wiki/Customization)] \\[[Wiki](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal/wiki)] \\[[Screenshots](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/search?q=wal&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)]\n"
