          "content": "# How to contribute to 🤗 LeRobot?\n\nEveryone is welcome to contribute, and we value everybody's contribution. Code\nis thus not the only way to help the community. Answering questions, helping\nothers, reaching out and improving the documentations are immensely valuable to\nthe community.\n\nIt also helps us if you spread the word: reference the library from blog posts\non the awesome projects it made possible, shout out on Twitter when it has\nhelped you, or simply ⭐️ the repo to say \"thank you\".\n\nWhichever way you choose to contribute, please be mindful to respect our\n[code of conduct](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n## You can contribute in so many ways!\n\nSome of the ways you can contribute to 🤗 LeRobot:\n* Fixing outstanding issues with the existing code.\n* Implementing new models, datasets or simulation environments.\n* Contributing to the examples or to the documentation.\n* Submitting issues related to bugs or desired new features.\n\nFollowing the guides below, feel free to open issues and PRs and to coordinate your efforts with the community on our [Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/VjFz58wn3R). For specific inquiries, reach out to [Remi Cadene](mailto:remi.cadene@huggingface.co).\n\nIf you are not sure how to contribute or want to know the next features we working on, look on this project page: [LeRobot TODO](https://github.com/orgs/huggingface/projects/46)\n\n## Submitting a new issue or feature request\n\nDo your best to follow these guidelines when submitting an issue or a feature\nrequest. It will make it easier for us to come back to you quickly and with good\nfeedback.\n\n### Did you find a bug?\n\nThe 🤗 LeRobot library is robust and reliable thanks to the users who notify us of\nthe problems they encounter. So thank you for reporting an issue.\n\nFirst, we would really appreciate it if you could **make sure the bug was not\nalready reported** (use the search bar on Github under Issues).\n\nDid not find it? :( So we can act quickly on it, please follow these steps:\n\n* Include your **OS type and version**, the versions of **Python** and **PyTorch**.\n* A short, self-contained, code snippet that allows us to reproduce the bug in\n  less than 30s.\n* The full traceback if an exception is raised.\n* Attach any other additional information, like screenshots, you think may help.\n\n### Do you want a new feature?\n\nA good feature request addresses the following points:\n\n1. Motivation first:\n* Is it related to a problem/frustration with the library? If so, please explain\n  why. Providing a code snippet that demonstrates the problem is best.\n* Is it related to something you would need for a project? We'd love to hear\n  about it!\n* Is it something you worked on and think could benefit the community?\n  Awesome! Tell us what problem it solved for you.\n2. Write a *paragraph* describing the feature.\n3. Provide a **code snippet** that demonstrates its future use.\n4. In case this is related to a paper, please attach a link.\n5. Attach any additional information (drawings, screenshots, etc.) you think may help.\n\nIf your issue is well written we're already 80% of the way there by the time you\npost it.\n\n## Adding new policies, datasets or environments\n\nLook at our implementations for [datasets](./lerobot/common/datasets/), [policies](./lerobot/common/policies/),\nenvironments ([aloha](https://github.com/huggingface/gym-aloha),\n[xarm](https://github.com/huggingface/gym-xarm),\n[pusht](https://github.com/huggingface/gym-pusht))\nand follow the same api design.\n\nWhen implementing a new dataset loadable with LeRobotDataset follow these steps:\n- Update `available_datasets_per_env` in `lerobot/__init__.py`\n\nWhen implementing a new environment (e.g. `gym_aloha`), follow these steps:\n- Update `available_tasks_per_env` and `available_datasets_per_env` in `lerobot/__init__.py`\n\nWhen implementing a new policy class (e.g. `DiffusionPolicy`) follow these steps:\n- Update `available_policies` and `available_policies_per_env`, in `lerobot/__init__.py`\n- Set the required `name` class attribute.\n- Update variables in `tests/test_available.py` by importing your new Policy class\n\n## Submitting a pull request (PR)\n\nBefore writing code, we strongly advise you to search through the existing PRs or\nissues to make sure that nobody is already working on the same thing. If you are\nunsure, it is always a good idea to open an issue to get some feedback.\n\nYou will need basic `git` proficiency to be able to contribute to\n🤗 LeRobot. `git` is not the easiest tool to use but it has the greatest\nmanual. Type `git --help` in a shell and enjoy. If you prefer books, [Pro\nGit](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is a very good reference.\n\nFollow these steps to start contributing:\n\n1. Fork the [repository](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot) by\n   clicking on the 'Fork' button on the repository's page. This creates a copy of the code\n   under your GitHub user account.\n\n2. Clone your fork to your local disk, and add the base repository as a remote. The following command\n   assumes you have your public SSH key uploaded to GitHub. See the following guide for more\n   [information](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone git@github.com:<your Github handle>/lerobot.git\n   cd lerobot\n   git remote add upstream https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot.git\n   ```\n\n3. Create a new branch to hold your development changes, and do this for every new PR you work on.\n\n   Start by synchronizing your `main` branch with the `upstream/main` branch (more details in the [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork)):\n\n   ```bash\n   git checkout main\n   git fetch upstream\n   git rebase upstream/main\n   ```\n\n   Once your `main` branch is synchronized, create a new branch from it:\n\n   ```bash\n   git checkout -b a-descriptive-name-for-my-changes\n   ```\n\n   🚨 **Do not** work on the `main` branch.\n\n4. for development, we use `poetry` instead of just `pip` to easily track our dependencies.\n   If you don't have it already, follow the [instructions](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) to install it.\n\n   Set up a development environment with conda or miniconda:\n   ```bash\n   conda create -y -n lerobot-dev python=3.10 && conda activate lerobot-dev\n   ```\n\n   To develop on 🤗 LeRobot, you will at least need to install the `dev` and `test` extras dependencies along with the core library:\n   ```bash\n   poetry install --sync --extras \"dev test\"\n   ```\n\n   You can also install the project with all its dependencies (including environments):\n   ```bash\n   poetry install --sync --all-extras\n   ```\n\n   > **Note:** If you don't install simulation environments with `--all-extras`, the tests that require them will be skipped when running the pytest suite locally. However, they *will* be tested in the CI. In general, we advise you to install everything and test locally before pushing.\n\n   Whichever command you chose to install the project (e.g. `poetry install --sync --all-extras`), you should run it again when pulling code with an updated version of `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` in order to synchronize your virtual environment with the new dependencies.\n\n   The equivalent of `pip install some-package`, would just be:\n   ```bash\n   poetry add some-package\n   ```\n\n   When making changes to the poetry sections of the `pyproject.toml`, you should run the following command to lock dependencies.\n   ```bash\n   poetry lock --no-update\n   ```\n\n5. Develop the features on your branch.\n\n   As you work on the features, you should make sure that the test suite\n   passes. You should run the tests impacted by your changes like this (see\n   below an explanation regarding the environment variable):\n\n   ```bash\n   pytest tests/<TEST_TO_RUN>.py\n   ```\n\n6. Follow our style.\n\n   `lerobot` relies on `ruff` to format its source code\n   consistently. Set up [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) to run these checks\n   automatically as Git commit hooks.\n\n   Install `pre-commit` hooks:\n   ```bash\n   pre-commit install\n   ```\n\n   You can run these hooks whenever you need on staged files with:\n   ```bash\n   pre-commit\n   ```\n\n   Once you're happy with your changes, add changed files using `git add` and\n   make a commit with `git commit` to record your changes locally:\n\n   ```bash\n   git add modified_file.py\n   git commit\n   ```\n\n   Note, if you already commited some changes that have a wrong formatting, you can use:\n   ```bash\n   pre-commit run --all-files\n   ```\n\n   Please write [good commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).\n\n   It is a good idea to sync your copy of the code with the original\n   repository regularly. This way you can quickly account for changes:\n\n   ```bash\n   git fetch upstream\n   git rebase upstream/main\n   ```\n\n   Push the changes to your account using:\n\n   ```bash\n   git push -u origin a-descriptive-name-for-my-changes\n   ```\n\n6. Once you are satisfied (**and the checklist below is happy too**), go to the\n   webpage of your fork on GitHub. Click on 'Pull request' to send your changes\n   to the project maintainers for review.\n\n7. It's ok if maintainers ask you for changes. It happens to core contributors\n   too! So everyone can see the changes in the Pull request, work in your local\n   branch and push the changes to your fork. They will automatically appear in\n   the pull request.\n\n\n### Checklist\n\n1. The title of your pull request should be a summary of its contribution;\n2. If your pull request addresses an issue, please mention the issue number in\n   the pull request description to make sure they are linked (and people\n   consulting the issue know you are working on it);\n3. To indicate a work in progress please prefix the title with `[WIP]`, or preferably mark\n   the PR as a draft PR. These are useful to avoid duplicated work, and to differentiate\n   it from PRs ready to be merged;\n4. Make sure existing tests pass;\n<!-- 5. Add high-coverage tests. No quality testing = no merge.\n\nSee an example of a good PR here: https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot/pull/ -->\n\n### Tests\n\nAn extensive test suite is included to test the library behavior and several examples. Library tests can be found in the [tests folder](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot/tree/main/tests).\n\nInstall [git lfs](https://git-lfs.com/) to retrieve test artifacts (if you don't have it already).\n\nOn Mac:\n```bash\nbrew install git-lfs\ngit lfs install\n```\n\nOn Ubuntu:\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install git-lfs\ngit lfs install\n```\n\nPull artifacts if they're not in [tests/data](tests/data)\n```bash\ngit lfs pull\n```\n\nWe use `pytest` in order to run the tests. From the root of the\nrepository, here's how to run tests with `pytest` for the library:\n\n```bash\npython -m pytest -sv ./tests\n```\n\n\nYou can specify a smaller set of tests in order to test only the feature\nyou're working on.\n"

See below.)\n\n## Walkthrough\n\n```\n.\n├── examples             # contains demonstration examples, start here to learn about LeRobot\n|   └── advanced         # contains even more examples for those who have mastered the basics\n├── lerobot\n|   ├── configs          # contains hydra yaml files with all options that you can override in the command line\n|   |   ├── default.yaml   # selected by default, it loads pusht environment and diffusion policy\n|   |   ├── env            # various sim environments and their datasets: aloha.yaml, pusht.yaml, xarm.yaml\n|   |   └── policy         # various policies: act.yaml, diffusion.yaml, tdmpc.yaml\n|   ├── common           # contains classes and utilities\n|   |   ├── datasets       # various datasets of human demonstrations: aloha, pusht, xarm\n|   |   ├── envs           # various sim environments: aloha, pusht, xarm\n|   |   ├── policies       # various policies: act, diffusion, tdmpc\n|   |   ├── robot_devices  # various real devices: dynamixel motors, opencv cameras, koch robots\n|   |   └── utils          # various utilities\n|   └── scripts          # contains functions to execute via command line\n|       ├── eval.py                 # load policy and evaluate it on an environment\n|       ├── train.py                # train a policy via imitation learning and/or reinforcement learning\n|       ├── control_robot.py        # teleoperate a real robot, record data, run a policy\n|       ├── push_dataset_to_hub.py  # convert your dataset into LeRobot dataset format and upload it to the Hugging Face hub\n|       └── visualize_dataset.py    # load a dataset and render its demonstrations\n├── outputs               # contains results of scripts execution: logs, videos, model checkpoints\n└── tests                 # contains pytest utilities for continuous integration\n```\n\n### Visualize datasets\n\nCheck out [example 1](./examples/1_load_lerobot_dataset.py) that illustrates how to use our dataset class which automatically downloads data from the Hugging Face hub.\n\nYou can also locally visualize episodes from a dataset on the hub by executing our script from the command line:\n```bash\npython lerobot/scripts/visualize_dataset.py \\\n    --repo-id lerobot/pusht \\\n    --episode-index 0\n```\n\nor from a dataset in a local folder with the `root` option and the `--local-files-only` (in the following case the dataset will be searched for in `./my_local_data_dir/lerobot/pusht`)\n```bash\npython lerobot/scripts/visualize_dataset.py \\\n    --repo-id lerobot/pusht \\\n    --root ./my_local_data_dir \\\n    --local-files-only 1 \\\n    --episode-index 0\n```\n\n\nIt will open `rerun.io` and display the camera streams, robot states and actions, like this:\n\nhttps://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/4681518/328035972-fd46b787-b532-47e2-bb6f-fd536a55a7ed.mov?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAVCODYLSA53PQK4ZA%2F20240505%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20240505T172924Z&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-Signature=d680b26c532eeaf80740f08af3320d22ad0b8a4e4da1bcc4f33142c15b509eda&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&actor_id=24889239&key_id=0&repo_id=748713144\n\n\nOur script can also visualize datasets stored on a distant server. See `python lerobot/scripts/visualize_dataset.py --help` for more instructions.\n\n### The `LeRobotDataset` format\n\nA dataset in `LeRobotDataset` format is very simple to use. It can be loaded from a repository on the Hugging Face hub or a local folder simply with e.g. `dataset = LeRobotDataset(\"lerobot/aloha_static_coffee\")` and can be indexed into like any Hugging Face and PyTorch dataset. For instance `dataset[0]` will retrieve a single temporal frame from the dataset containing observation(s) and an action as PyTorch tensors ready to be fed to a model.\n\nA specificity of `LeRobotDataset` is that, rather than retrieving a single frame by its index, we can retrieve several frames based on their temporal relationship with the indexed frame, by setting `delta_timestamps` to a list of relative times with respect to the indexed frame. For example, with `delta_timestamps = {\"observation.image\": [-1, -0.5, -0.2, 0]}`  one can retrieve, for a given index, 4 frames: 3 \"previous\" frames 1 second, 0.5 seconds, and 0.2 seconds before the indexed frame, and the indexed frame itself (corresponding to the 0 entry). See example [1_load_lerobot_dataset.py](examples/1_load_lerobot_dataset.py) for more details on `delta_timestamps`.\n\nUnder the hood, the `LeRobotDataset` format makes use of several ways to serialize data which can be useful to understand if you plan to work more closely with this format. We tried to make a flexible yet simple dataset format that would cover most type of features and specificities present in reinforcement learning and robotics, in simulation and in real-world, with a focus on cameras and robot states but easily extended to other types of sensory inputs as long as they can be represented by a tensor.\n\nHere are the important details and internal structure organization of a typical `LeRobotDataset` instantiated with `dataset = LeRobotDataset(\"lerobot/aloha_static_coffee\")`. The exact features will change from dataset to dataset but not the main aspects:\n\n```\ndataset attributes:\n  ├ hf_dataset: a Hugging Face dataset (backed by Arrow/parquet). Typical features example:\n  │  ├ observation.images.cam_high (VideoFrame):\n  │  │   VideoFrame = {'path': path to a mp4 video, 'timestamp' (float32): timestamp in the video}\n  │  ├ observation.state (list of float32): position of an arm joints (for instance)\n  │  ... (more observations)\n  │  ├ action (list of float32): goal position of an arm joints (for instance)\n  │  ├ episode_index (int64): index of the episode for this sample\n  │  ├ frame_index (int64): index of the frame for this sample in the episode ; starts at 0 for each episode\n  │  ├ timestamp (float32): timestamp in the episode\n  │  ├ next.done (bool): indicates the end of en episode ; True for the last frame in each episode\n  │  └ index (int64): general index in the whole dataset\n  ├ episode_data_index: contains 2 tensors with the start and end indices of each episode\n  │  ├ from (1D int64 tensor): first frame index for each episode — shape (num episodes,) starts with 0\n  │  └ to: (1D int64 tensor): last frame index for each episode — shape (num episodes,)\n  ├ stats: a dictionary of statistics (max, mean, min, std) for each feature in the dataset, for instance\n  │  ├ observation.images.cam_high: {'max': tensor with same number of dimensions (e.g. `(c, 1, 1)` for images, `(c,)` for states), etc.}\n  │  ...\n  ├ info: a dictionary of metadata on the dataset\n  │  ├ codebase_version (str): this is to keep track of the codebase version the dataset was created with\n  │  ├ fps (float): frame per second the dataset is recorded/synchronized to\n  │  ├ video (bool): indicates if frames are encoded in mp4 video files to save space or stored as png files\n  │  └ encoding (dict): if video, this documents the main options that were used with ffmpeg to encode the videos\n  ├ videos_dir (Path): where the mp4 videos or png images are stored/accessed\n  └ camera_keys (list of string): the keys to access camera features in the item returned by the dataset (e.g. `[\"observation.images.cam_high\", ...]`)\n```\n\nA `LeRobotDataset` is serialised using several widespread file formats for each of its parts, namely:\n- hf_dataset stored using Hugging Face datasets library serialization to parquet\n- videos are stored in mp4 format to save space\n- metadata are stored in plain json/jsonl files\n\nDataset can be uploaded/downloaded from the HuggingFace hub seamlessly. To work on a local dataset, you can use the `local_files_only` argument and specify its location with the `root` argument if it's not in the default `~/.cache/huggingface/lerobot` location.\n\n### Evaluate a pretrained policy\n\nCheck out [example 2](./examples/2_evaluate_pretrained_policy.py) that illustrates how to download a pretrained policy from Hugging Face hub, and run an evaluation on its corresponding environment.\n\nWe also provide a more capable script to parallelize the evaluation over multiple environments during the same rollout. Here is an example with a pretrained model hosted on [lerobot/diffusion_pusht](https://huggingface.co/lerobot/diffusion_pusht):\n```bash\npython lerobot/scripts/eval.py \\\n    -p lerobot/diffusion_pusht \\\n    eval.n_episodes=10 \\\n    eval.batch_size=10\n```\n\nNote: After training your own policy, you can re-evaluate the checkpoints with:\n\n```bash\npython lerobot/scripts/eval.py -p {OUTPUT_DIR}/checkpoints/last/pretrained_model\n```\n\nSee `python lerobot/scripts/eval.py --help` for more instructions.\n\n### Train your own policy\n\nCheck out [example 3](./examples/3_train_policy.py) that illustrates how to train a model using our core library in python, and [example 4](./examples/4_train_policy_with_script.md) that shows how to use our training script from command line.\n\nIn general, you can use our training script to easily train any policy. Here is an example of training the ACT policy on trajectories collected by humans on the Aloha simulation environment for the insertion task:\n\n```bash\npython lerobot/scripts/train.py \\\n    policy=act \\\n    env=aloha \\\n    env.task=AlohaInsertion-v0 \\\n    dataset_repo_id=lerobot/aloha_sim_insertion_human \\\n```\n\nThe experiment directory is automatically generated and will show up in yellow in your terminal. It looks like `outputs/train/2024-05-05/20-21-12_aloha_act_default`. You can manually specify an experiment directory by adding this argument to the `train.py` python command:\n```bash\n    hydra.run.dir=your/new/experiment/dir\n```\n\nIn the experiment directory there will be a folder called `checkpoints` which will have the following structure:\n\n```bash\ncheckpoints\n├── 000250  # checkpoint_dir for training step 250\n│   ├── pretrained_model  # Hugging Face pretrained model dir\n│   │   ├── config.json  # Hugging Face pretrained model config\n│   │   ├── config.yaml  # consolidated Hydra config\n│   │   ├── model.safetensors  # model weights\n│   │   └── README.md  # Hugging Face model card\n│   └── training_state.pth  # optimizer/scheduler/rng state and training step\n```\n\nTo resume training from a checkpoint, you can add these to the `train.py` python command:\n```bash\n    hydra.run.dir=your/original/experiment/dir resume=true\n```\n\nIt will load the pretrained model, optimizer and scheduler states for training. For more information please see our tutorial on training resumption [here](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot/blob/main/examples/5_resume_training.md).\n\nTo use wandb for logging training and evaluation curves, make sure you've run `wandb login` as a one-time setup step. Then, when running the training command above, enable WandB in the configuration by adding:\n\n```bash\n    wandb.enable=true\n```\n\nA link to the wandb logs for the run will also show up in yellow in your terminal. Here is an example of what they look like in your browser. Please also check [here](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot/blob/main/examples/4_train_policy_with_script.md#typical-logs-and-metrics) for the explanation of some commonly used metrics in logs.\n\n![](media/wandb.png)\n\nNote: For efficiency, during training every checkpoint is evaluated on a low number of episodes. You may use `eval.n_episodes=500` to evaluate on more episodes than the default. Or, after training, you may want to re-evaluate your best checkpoints on more episodes or change the evaluation settings. See `python lerobot/scripts/eval.py --help` for more instructions.\n\n#### Reproduce state-of-the-art (SOTA)\n\nWe have organized our configuration files (found under [`lerobot/configs`](./lerobot/configs)) such that they reproduce SOTA results from a given model variant in their respective original works. Simply running:\n\n```bash\npython lerobot/scripts/train.py policy=diffusion env=pusht\n```\n\nreproduces SOTA results for Diffusion Policy on the PushT task.\n\nPretrained policies, along with reproduction details, can be found under the \"Models\" section of https://huggingface.co/lerobot.\n\n## Contribute\n\nIf you would like to contribute to 🤗 LeRobot, please check out our [contribution guide](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n### Add a new dataset\n\nTo add a dataset to the hub, you need to login using a write-access token, which can be generated from the [Hugging Face settings](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens):\n```bash\nhuggingface-cli login --token ${HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN} --add-to-git-credential\n```\n\nThen point to your raw dataset folder (e.g. `data/aloha_static_pingpong_test_raw`), and push your dataset to the hub with:\n```bash\npython lerobot/scripts/push_dataset_to_hub.py \\\n--raw-dir data/aloha_static_pingpong_test_raw \\\n--out-dir data \\\n--repo-id lerobot/aloha_static_pingpong_test \\\n--raw-format aloha_hdf5\n```\n\nSee `python lerobot/scripts/push_dataset_to_hub.py --help` for more instructions.\n\nIf your dataset format is not supported, implement your own in `lerobot/common/datasets/push_dataset_to_hub/${raw_format}_format.py` by copying examples like [pusht_zarr](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot/blob/main/lerobot/common/datasets/push_dataset_to_hub/pusht_zarr_format.py), [umi_zarr](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot/blob/main/lerobot/common/datasets/push_dataset_to_hub/umi_zarr_format.py), [aloha_hdf5](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot/blob/main/lerobot/common/datasets/push_dataset_to_hub/aloha_hdf5_format.py), or [xarm_pkl](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot/blob/main/lerobot/common/datasets/push_dataset_to_hub/xarm_pkl_format.py).\n\n\n### Add a pretrained policy\n\nOnce you have trained a policy you may upload it to the Hugging Face hub using a hub id that looks like `${hf_user}/${repo_name}` (e.g. [lerobot/diffusion_pusht](https://huggingface.co/lerobot/diffusion_pusht)).\n\nYou first need to find the checkpoint folder located inside your experiment directory (e.g. `outputs/train/2024-05-05/20-21-12_aloha_act_default/checkpoints/002500`). Within that there is a `pretrained_model` directory which should contain:\n- `config.json`: A serialized version of the policy configuration (following the policy's dataclass config).\n- `model.safetensors`: A set of `torch.nn.Module` parameters, saved in [Hugging Face Safetensors](https://huggingface.co/docs/safetensors/index) format.\n- `config.yaml`: A consolidated Hydra training configuration containing the policy, environment, and dataset configs. The policy configuration should match `config.json` exactly. The environment config is useful for anyone who wants to evaluate your policy. The dataset config just serves as a paper trail for reproducibility.\n\nTo upload these to the hub, run the following:\n```bash\nhuggingface-cli upload ${hf_user}/${repo_name} path/to/pretrained_model\n```\n\nSee [eval.py](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot/blob/main/lerobot/scripts/eval.py) for an example of how other people may use your policy.\n\n\n### Improve your code with profiling\n\nAn example of a code snippet to profile the evaluation of a policy:\n```python\nfrom torch.profiler import profile, record_function, ProfilerActivity\n\ndef trace_handler(prof):\n    prof.export_chrome_trace(f\"tmp/trace_schedule_{prof.step_num}.json\")\n\nwith profile(\n    activities=[ProfilerActivity.CPU, ProfilerActivity.CUDA],\n    schedule=torch.profiler.schedule(\n        wait=2,\n        warmup=2,\n        active=3,\n    ),\n    on_trace_ready=trace_handler\n) as prof:\n    with record_function(\"eval_policy\"):\n        for i in range(num_episodes):\n            prof.step()\n            # insert code to profile, potentially whole body of eval_policy function\n```\n\n## Citation\n\nIf you want, you can cite this work with:\n```bibtex\n@misc{cadene2024lerobot,\n    author = {Cadene, Remi and Alibert, Simon and Soare, Alexander and Gallouedec, Quentin and Zouitine, Adil and Wolf, Thomas},\n    title = {LeRobot: State-of-the-art Machine Learning for Real-World Robotics in Pytorch},\n    howpublished = \"\\url{https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot}\",\n    year = {2024}\n}\n```\n\nAdditionally, if you are using any of the particular policy architecture, pretrained models, or datasets, it is recommended to cite the original authors of the work as they appear below:\n\n- [Diffusion Policy](https://diffusion-policy.cs.columbia.edu)\n```bibtex\n@article{chi2024diffusionpolicy,\n\tauthor = {Cheng Chi and Zhenjia Xu and Siyuan Feng and Eric Cousineau and Yilun Du and Benjamin Burchfiel and Russ Tedrake and Shuran Song},\n\ttitle ={Diffusion Policy: Visuomotor Policy Learning via Action Diffusion},\n\tjournal = {The International Journal of Robotics Research},\n\tyear = {2024},\n}\n```\n- [ACT or ALOHA](https://tonyzhaozh.github.io/aloha)\n```bibtex\n@article{zhao2023learning,\n  title={Learning fine-grained bimanual manipulation with low-cost hardware},\n  author={Zhao, Tony Z and Kumar, Vikash and Levine, Sergey and Finn, Chelsea},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2304.13705},\n  year={2023}\n}\n```\n\n- [TDMPC](https://www.nicklashansen.com/td-mpc/)\n\n```bibtex\n@inproceedings{Hansen2022tdmpc,\n\ttitle={Temporal Difference Learning for Model Predictive Control},\n\tauthor={Nicklas Hansen and Xiaolong Wang and Hao Su},\n\tbooktitle={ICML},\n\tyear={2022}\n}\n```\n\n- [VQ-BeT](https://sjlee.cc/vq-bet/)\n```bibtex\n@article{lee2024behavior,\n  title={Behavior generation with latent actions},\n  author={Lee, Seungjae and Wang, Yibin and Etukuru, Haritheja and Kim, H Jin and Shafiullah, Nur Muhammad Mahi and Pinto, Lerrel},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2403.03181},\n  year={2024}\n}\n```\n"
