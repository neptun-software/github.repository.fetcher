An evaluation\nframework is also provided to judge the quality of deduplication for a given dataset.\n\nFollowing details the functionality provided by the package:\n\n- Finding duplicates in a directory using one of the following algorithms:\n  - [Convolutional Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02244#:~:text=MobileNetV3%20is%20tuned%20to%20mobile,improved%20through%20novel%20architecture%20advances.) (CNN) - Select from several prepackaged models or provide your own custom model.\n  - [Perceptual hashing](http://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/432-Looks-Like-It.html) (PHash)\n  - [Difference hashing](http://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/529-Kind-of-Like-That.html) (DHash)\n  - [Wavelet hashing](https://fullstackml.com/wavelet-image-hash-in-python-3504fdd282b5) (WHash)\n  - [Average hashing](http://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/432-Looks-Like-It.html) (AHash)\n- Generation of encodings for images using one of the above stated algorithms.\n- Framework to evaluate effectiveness of deduplication  given a ground truth mapping.\n- Plotting duplicates found for a given image file.\n\nDetailed documentation for the package can be found at: [https://idealo.github.io/imagededup/](https://idealo.github.io/imagededup/)\n\nimagededup is compatible with Python 3.8+ and runs on Linux, MacOS X and Windows.\nIt is distributed under the Apache 2.0 license.\n\n## 📖 Contents\n\n- [Installation](#%EF%B8%8F-installation)\n- [Quick Start](#-quick-start)\n- [Benchmarks](#-benchmarks)\n- [Contribute](#-contribute)\n- [Citation](#-citation)\n- [Maintainers](#-maintainers)\n- [License](#-copyright)\n\n## ⚙️ Installation\n\nThere are two ways to install imagededup:\n\n- Install imagededup from PyPI (recommended):\n\n```\npip install imagededup\n```\n\n- Install imagededup from the GitHub source:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/idealo/imagededup.git\ncd imagededup\npip install \"cython>=0.29\"\npython setup.py install\n```  \n\n## 🚀 Quick Start\n\nIn order to find duplicates in an image directory using perceptual hashing, following workflow can be used:\n\n- Import perceptual hashing method\n\n```python\nfrom imagededup.methods import PHash\nphasher = PHash()\n```\n\n- Generate encodings for all images in an image directory\n\n```python\nencodings = phasher.encode_images(image_dir='path/to/image/directory')\n```\n\n- Find duplicates using the generated encodings\n\n```python\nduplicates = phasher.find_duplicates(encoding_map=encodings)\n```\n\n- Plot duplicates obtained for a given file (eg: 'ukbench00120.jpg') using the duplicates dictionary\n\n```python\nfrom imagededup.utils import plot_duplicates\nplot_duplicates(image_dir='path/to/image/directory',\n                duplicate_map=duplicates,\n                filename='ukbench00120.jpg')\n```\n\nThe output looks as below:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"readme_figures/plot_dups.png\" width=\"600\" />\n</p>\n\nThe complete code for the workflow is:\n\n```python\nfrom imagededup.methods import PHash\nphasher = PHash()\n\n# Generate encodings for all images in an image directory\nencodings = phasher.encode_images(image_dir='path/to/image/directory')\n\n# Find duplicates using the generated encodings\nduplicates = phasher.find_duplicates(encoding_map=encodings)\n\n# plot duplicates obtained for a given file using the duplicates dictionary\nfrom imagededup.utils import plot_duplicates\nplot_duplicates(image_dir='path/to/image/directory',\n                duplicate_map=duplicates,\n                filename='ukbench00120.jpg')\n```\nIt is also possible to use your own custom models for finding duplicates using the CNN method.\n\nFor examples, refer [this](https://github.com/idealo/imagededup/tree/master/examples) part of the\nrepository.\n\nFor more detailed usage of the package functionality, refer: [https://idealo.github.io/imagededup/](https://idealo.github.io/imagededup/)\n\n## ⏳ Benchmarks\n\n**Update**: Provided benchmarks are only valid upto `imagededup v0.2.2`. The next releases have significant changes to all methods, so the current benchmarks may not hold.\n\nDetailed benchmarks on speed and classification metrics for different methods have been provided in the [documentation](https://idealo.github.io/imagededup/user_guide/benchmarks/).\nGenerally speaking, following conclusions can be made:\n\n- CNN works best for near duplicates and datasets containing transformations.\n- All deduplication methods fare well on datasets containing exact duplicates, but Difference hashing is the fastest.\n\n## 🤝 Contribute\n\nWe welcome all kinds of contributions.\nSee the [Contribution](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide for more details.\n\n## 📝 Citation\n\nPlease cite Imagededup in your publications if this is useful for your research.
