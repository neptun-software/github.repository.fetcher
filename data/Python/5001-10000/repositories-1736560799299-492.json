The fixes are now included in the newly released version (v0.26), available as of today.\n\n### December 25, 2024\n\nThe `review` tool previously included a legacy feature for providing code suggestions (controlled by '--pr_reviewer.num_code_suggestion'). This functionality has been deprecated. Use instead the [`improve`](https://qodo-merge-docs.qodo.ai/tools/improve/) tool, which offers higher quality and more actionable code suggestions.\n\n### December 2, 2024\n\nOpen-source repositories can now freely use Qodo Merge Pro, and enjoy easy one-click installation using a marketplace [app](https://github.com/apps/qodo-merge-pro-for-open-source).\n\n<kbd><img

about installing Qodo Merge Pro for private repositories.\n\n\n### November 18, 2024\n\nA new mode was enabled by default for code suggestions - `--pr_code_suggestions.focus_only_on_problems=true`:\n\n- This option reduces the number of code suggestions received\n- The suggestions will focus more on identifying and fixing code problems, rather than style considerations like best practices, maintainability, or readability.\n- The suggestions will be categorized into just two groups: \"Possible Issues\" and \"General\".\n\nStill, if you prefer the previous mode, you can set `--pr_code_suggestions.focus_only_on_problems=false` in the [configuration file](https://qodo-merge-docs.qodo.ai/usage-guide/configuration_options/).\n\n**Example

PR-Agent instantly on _your public GitHub repository_. Just mention `@CodiumAI-Agent` and add the desired command in any PR comment. The agent will generate a response based on your command.\nFor example, add a comment to any pull request with the following text:\n```\n@CodiumAI-Agent /review\n```\nand the agent will respond with a review of your PR.\n\nNote that this is a promotional bot, suitable only for initial experimentation.\nIt does not have 'edit' access to your repo, for example, so it cannot update the PR description or add labels (`@CodiumAI-Agent /describe` will publish PR description as a comment). In addition, the bot cannot be used on private repositories, as it does not have access to the files there.\n\n\n![Review generation process](https://www.codium.ai/images/demo-2.gif)\n\n\nTo set up your own PR-Agent, see the [Installation](https://pr-agent-docs.codium.ai/installation/) section below.\nNote that when you set your own PR-Agent or use CodiumAI hosted PR-Agent, there is no need to mention `@CodiumAI-Agent ...`. Instead, directly start with the command, e.g., `/ask ...`.\n\n---\n\n\n## PR-Agent Pro 💎\n[PR-Agent Pro](https://www.codium.ai/pricing/) is a hosted version of PR-Agent, provided by CodiumAI. It is available for a monthly fee, and provides the following benefits:\n1. **Fully managed** - We take care of everything for you - hosting, models, regular updates, and more. Installation is as simple as signing up and adding the PR-Agent app to your GitHub\\GitLab\\BitBucket repo.\n2. **Improved privacy** - No data will be stored or used to train models. PR-Agent Pro will employ zero data retention, and will use an OpenAI account with zero data retention.\n3. **Improved support** - PR-Agent Pro users will receive priority support, and will be able to request new features and capabilities.\n4. **Extra features** -In addition to the benefits listed above, PR-Agent Pro will emphasize more customization, and the usage of static code analysis, in addition to LLM logic, to improve results.\nSee [here](https://qodo-merge-docs.qodo.ai/overview/pr_agent_pro/) for a list of features available in PR-Agent Pro.\n\n\n\n## How it works\n\nThe following diagram illustrates PR-Agent tools and their flow:\n\n![PR-Agent Tools](https://codium.ai/images/pr_agent/diagram-v0.9.png)\n\nCheck out the [PR Compression strategy](https://pr-agent-docs.codium.ai/core-abilities/#pr-compression-strategy) page for more details on how we convert a code diff to a manageable LLM prompt\n\n## Why use PR-Agent?\n\nA reasonable question that can be asked is: `\"Why use PR-Agent? What makes it stand out from existing tools?\"`\n\nHere are some advantages of PR-Agent:\n\n- We emphasize **real-life practical usage**. Each tool (review, improve, ask, ...) has a single GPT-4 call, no more. We feel that this is critical for realistic team usage - obtaining an answer quickly (~30 seconds) and affordably.\n- Our [PR Compression strategy](https://pr-agent-docs.codium.ai/core-abilities/#pr-compression-strategy)  is a core ability that enables to effectively tackle both short and long PRs.\n- Our JSON prompting strategy enables to have **modular, customizable tools**. For example, the '/review' tool categories can be controlled via the [configuration](pr_agent/settings/configuration.toml) file. Adding additional categories is easy and accessible.\n- We support **multiple git providers** (GitHub, Gitlab, Bitbucket), **multiple ways** to use the tool (CLI, GitHub Action, GitHub App, Docker, ...), and **multiple models** (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Anthropic, Cohere, Llama2).\n\n\n## Data privacy\n\n### Self-hosted PR-Agent\n\n- If you host PR-Agent with your OpenAI API key, it is between you and OpenAI. You can read their API data privacy policy here:\nhttps://openai.com/enterprise-privacy\n\n### CodiumAI-hosted PR-Agent Pro 💎\n\n- When using PR-Agent Pro 💎, hosted by CodiumAI, we will not store any of your data, nor will we use it for training. You will also benefit from an OpenAI account with zero data retention.\n\n- For certain clients, CodiumAI-hosted PR-Agent Pro will use CodiumAI’s proprietary models — if this is the case, you will be notified.\n\n- No passive collection of Code and Pull Requests’ data — PR-Agent will be active only when you invoke it, and it will then extract and analyze only data relevant to the executed command and queried pull request.\n\n### PR-Agent Chrome extension\n\n- The [PR-Agent Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/pr-agent-chrome-extension/ephlnjeghhogofkifjloamocljapahnl) serves solely to modify the visual appearance of a GitHub PR screen. It does not transmit any user's repo or pull request code. Code is only sent for processing when a user submits a GitHub comment that activates a PR-Agent tool, in accordance with the standard privacy policy of PR-Agent.\n\n## Links\n\n[![Join our Discord community](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Codium-ai/codiumai-vscode-release/main/media/docs/Joincommunity.png)](https://discord.gg/kG35uSHDBc)\n\n- Discord community: https://discord.gg/kG35uSHDBc\n- CodiumAI site: https://codium.ai\n- Blog: https://www.codium.ai/blog/\n- Troubleshooting: https://www.codium.ai/blog/technical-faq-and-troubleshooting/\n- Support: support@codium.ai\n"
