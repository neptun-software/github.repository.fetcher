3.0-3.5\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nPython 3.5 is EOL so we decide to drop its support. Version ``1.7.1`` is\nthe last one supporting Python 3.0-3.5.\n\nRequire cryptography >= 3\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nDrop support for PyCrypto and ECDSA\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nWe've kept this around for a long time, mostly for environments that\ndidn't allow installing cryptography.\n\nDrop CLI\n^^^^^^^^\n\nDropped the included cli entry point.\n\nImprove typings\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nWe no longer need to use mypy Python 2 compatibility mode (comments)\n\n``jwt.encode(...)`` return type\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nTokens are returned as string instead of a byte string\n\nDropped deprecated errors\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nRemoved ``ExpiredSignature``, ``InvalidAudience``, and\n``InvalidIssuer``. Use ``ExpiredSignatureError``,\n``InvalidAudienceError``, and ``InvalidIssuerError`` instead.\n\nDropped deprecated ``verify_expiration`` param in ``jwt.decode(...)``\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nUse\n``jwt.decode(encoded, key, algorithms=[\"HS256\"], options={\"verify_exp\": False})``\ninstead.\n\nDropped deprecated ``verify`` param in ``jwt.decode(...)``\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nUse ``jwt.decode(encoded, key, options={\"verify_signature\": False})``\ninstead.\n\nRequire explicit ``algorithms`` in ``jwt.decode(...)`` by default\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nExample: ``jwt.decode(encoded, key, algorithms=[\"HS256\"])``.\n\nDropped deprecated ``require_*`` options in ``jwt.decode(...)``\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nFor example, instead of\n``jwt.decode(encoded, key, algorithms=[\"HS256\"], options={\"require_exp\": True})``,\nuse\n``jwt.decode(encoded, key, algorithms=[\"HS256\"], options={\"require\": [\"exp\"]})``.\n\nAnd the old v1.x syntax\n``jwt.decode(token, verify=False)``\nis now:\n``jwt.decode(jwt=token, key='secret', algorithms=['HS256'], options={\"verify_signature\": False})``\n\nAdded\n~~~~~\n\nIntroduce better experience for JWKs\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nIntroduce ``PyJWK``, ``PyJWKSet``, and ``PyJWKClient``.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    import jwt\n    from jwt import PyJWKClient\n\n    token = \"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6Ik5FRTFRVVJCT1RNNE16STVSa0ZETlRZeE9UVTFNRGcyT0Rnd1EwVXpNVGsxUWpZeVJrUkZRdyJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2Rldi04N2V2eDlydS5hdXRoMC5jb20vIiwic3ViIjoiYVc0Q2NhNzl4UmVMV1V6MGFFMkg2a0QwTzNjWEJWdENAY2xpZW50cyIsImF1ZCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vZXhwZW5zZXMtYXBpIiwiaWF0IjoxNTcyMDA2OTU0LCJleHAiOjE1NzIwMDY5NjQsImF6cCI6ImFXNENjYTc5eFJlTFdVejBhRTJINmtEME8zY1hCVnRDIiwiZ3R5IjoiY2xpZW50LWNyZWRlbnRpYWxzIn0.PUxE7xn52aTCohGiWoSdMBZGiYAHwE5FYie0Y1qUT68IHSTXwXVd6hn02HTah6epvHHVKA2FqcFZ4GGv5VTHEvYpeggiiZMgbxFrmTEY0csL6VNkX1eaJGcuehwQCRBKRLL3zKmA5IKGy5GeUnIbpPHLHDxr-GXvgFzsdsyWlVQvPX2xjeaQ217r2PtxDeqjlf66UYl6oY6AqNS8DH3iryCvIfCcybRZkc_hdy-6ZMoKT6Piijvk_aXdm7-QQqKJFHLuEqrVSOuBqqiNfVrG27QzAPuPOxvfXTVLXL2jek5meH6n-VWgrBdoMFH93QEszEDowDAEhQPHVs0xj7SIzA\"\n    kid = \"NEE1QURBOTM4MzI5RkFDNTYxOTU1MDg2ODgwQ0UzMTk1QjYyRkRFQw\"\n    url = \"https://dev-87evx9ru.auth0.com/.well-known/jwks.json\"\n\n    jwks_client = PyJWKClient(url)\n    signing_key = jwks_client.get_signing_key_from_jwt(token)\n\n    data = jwt.decode(\n        token,\n        signing_key.key,\n        algorithms=[\"RS256\"],\n        audience=\"https://expenses-api\",\n        options={\"verify_exp\": False},\n    )\n    print(data)\n\nSupport for JWKs containing ECDSA keys\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nAdd support for Ed25519 / EdDSA\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nPull Requests\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n-  Add PyPy3 to the test matrix (#550) by @jdufresne\n-  Require tweak (#280) by @psafont\n-  Decode return type is dict[str, Any] (#393) by @jacopofar\n-  Fix linter error in test\\_cli (#414) by @jaraco\n-  Run mypy with tox (#421) by @jpadilla\n-  Document (and prefer) pyjwt[crypto] req format (#426) by @gthb\n-  Correct type for json\\_encoder argument (#438) by @jdufresne\n-  Prefer https:// links where available (#439) by @jdufresne\n-  Pass python\\_requires argument to setuptools (#440) by @jdufresne\n-  Rename [wheel] section to [bdist\\_wheel] as the former is legacy\n   (#441) by @jdufresne\n-  Remove setup.py test command in favor of pytest and tox (#442) by\n   @jdufresne\n-  Fix mypy errors (#449) by @jpadilla\n-  DX Tweaks (#450) by @jpadilla\n-  Add support of python 3.8 (#452) by @Djailla\n-  Fix 406 (#454) by @justinbaur\n-  Add support for Ed25519 / EdDSA, with unit tests (#455) by\n   @Someguy123\n-  Remove Python 2.7 compatibility (#457) by @Djailla\n-  Fix simple typo: encododed -> encoded (#462) by @timgates42\n-  Enhance tracebacks.
