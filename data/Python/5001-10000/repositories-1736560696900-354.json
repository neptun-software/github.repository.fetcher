setup.py\n* Fetch all spreadsheets in Spreadsheet.list_spreadsheet_files (#522 by @aiguofer)\n\n\n2.0.0 (2018-03-11)\n------------------\n\n* Ported the library to Google Sheets API v4.\n\n  This is a transition release. The v3-related code is untouched,\n  but v4 is used by default. It is encouraged to move to v4 since\n  the API is faster and has more features.\n\n  API v4 is a significant change from v3. Some methods are not\n  backward compatible, so there's no support for this compatibility\n  in gspread either.\n\n  These methods and properties are not supported in v4:\n\n  * `Spreadsheet.updated`\n  * `Worksheet.updated`\n  * `Worksheet.export()`\n  * `Cell.input_value`\n\n\n0.6.2 (2016-12-20)\n------------------\n\n* Remove deprecated HTTPError\n\n0.6.1 (2016-12-20)\n------------------\n\n* Fixed error when inserting permissions #431\n\n0.6.0 (2016-12-15)\n------------------\n\n* Added spreadsheet sharing functionality\n* Added csv import\n* Fixed bug where list of sheets isn't cleared on refetch\n  #429, #386\n\n\n0.5.1 (2016-12-12)\n------------------\n\n* Fixed a missing return value in `utils.a1_to_rowcol`\n* Fixed url parsing in `Client.open_by_url`\n* Added `updated` property to `Spreadsheet` objects\n\n\n0.5.0 (2016-12-12)\n------------------\n\n* Added method to create blank spreadsheets #253\n* Added method to clear worksheets #156\n* Added method to delete a row in a worksheet #337\n* Changed `Worksheet.range` method to accept integers as coordinates #142\n* Added `default_blank` parameter to `Worksheet.get_all_records` #423\n* Use xml.etree.cElementTree when available to reduce memory usage #348\n* Fixed losing input_value data from following cells in `Worksheet.insert_row` #338\n* Deprecated `Worksheet.get_int_addr` and `Worksheet.get_addr_int`\n  in favour of `utils.a1_to_rowcol` and `utils.rowcol_to_a1` respectively\n\n\n0.4.1 (2016-07-17)\n------------------\n\n* Fix exception format to support Python 2.6\n\n\n0.4.0 (2016-06-30)\n------------------\n\n* Use request session's connection pool in HTTPSession\n\n* Removed deprecated ClientLogin\n\n\n0.3.0 (2015-12-15)\n------------------\n\n* Use Python requests instead of the native HTTPConnection object\n\n* Optimized row_values and col_values\n\n* Optimized row_values and col_values\n  Removed the _fetch_cells call for each method. This eliminates the\n  adverse effect on runtime for large worksheets.\n\n  Fixes #285, #190, #179, and #113\n\n* Optimized row_values and col_values\n  Removed the _fetch_cells call for each method. This eliminates the\n  adverse effect on runtime for large worksheets.\n\n  Fixes #285, #190, #179, and #113\n\n* Altered insert_row semantics to utilize range\n  This avoids issuing one API request per cell to retrieve the Cell\n  objects after the insertion row.

[Create credentials in Google API Console](http://gspread.readthedocs.org/en/latest/oauth2.html)\n\n2. Start using gspread\n\n```python\nimport gspread\n\ngc = gspread.service_account()\n\n# Open a sheet from a spreadsheet in one go\nwks = gc.open(\"Where is the money Lebowski?\").sheet1\n\n# Update a range of cells using the top left corner address\nwks.update([[1, 2], [3, 4]], \"A1\")\n\n# Or update a single cell\nwks.update_acell(\"B42\", \"it's down there somewhere, let me take another look.\")\n\n# Format the header\nwks.format('A1:B1', {'textFormat': {'bold': True}})\n```\n\n## v5.12 to v6.0 Migration Guide\n\n### Upgrade from Python 3.7\n\nPython 3.7 is [end-of-life](https://devguide.python.org/versions/). gspread v6 requires a minimum of Python 3.8.\n\n### Change `Worksheet.update` arguments\n\nThe first two arguments (`values` & `range_name`) have swapped (to `range_name` & `values`). Either swap them (works in v6 only), or use named arguments (works in v5 & v6).\n\nAs well, `values` can no longer be a list, and must be a 2D array.\n\n```diff\n- file.sheet1.update([[\"new\", \"values\"]])\n+ file.sheet1.update([[\"new\", \"values\"]]) # unchanged\n\n- file.sheet1.update(\"B2:C2\", [[\"54\", \"55\"]])\n+ file.sheet1.update([[\"54\", \"55\"]], \"B2:C2\")\n# or\n+ file.sheet1.update(range_name=\"B2:C2\", values=[[\"54\", \"55\"]])\n```\n\n### More\n\n<details><summary>See More Migration Guide</summary>\n\n### Change colors from dictionary to text\n\nv6 uses hexadecimal color representation. Change all colors to hex. You can use the compatibility function `gspread.utils.convert_colors_to_hex_value()` to convert a dictionary to a hex string.\n\n```diff\n- tab_color = {\"red\": 1, \"green\": 0.5, \"blue\": 1}\n+ tab_color = \"#FF7FFF\"\nfile.sheet1.update_tab_color(tab_color)\n```\n\n### Switch lastUpdateTime from property to method\n\n```diff\n- age = spreadsheet.lastUpdateTime\n+ age = spreadsheet.get_lastUpdateTime()\n```\n\n### Replace method `Worksheet.get_records`\n\nIn v6 you can now only get *all* sheet records, using `Worksheet.get_all_records()`. The method `Worksheet.get_records()` has been removed. You can get some records using your own fetches and combine them with `gspread.utils.to_records()`.\n\n```diff\n+ from gspread import utils\n  all_records = spreadsheet.get_all_records(head=1)\n- some_records = spreadsheet.get_all_records(head=1, first_index=6, last_index=9)\n- some_records = spreadsheet.get_records(head=1, first_index=6, last_index=9)\n+ header = spreadsheet.get(\"1:1\")[0]\n+ cells = spreadsheet.get(\"6:9\")\n+ some_records = utils.to_records(header, cells)\n```\n\n### Silence warnings\n\nIn version 5 there are many warnings to mark deprecated feature/functions/methods.\nThey can be silenced by setting the `GSPREAD_SILENCE_WARNINGS` environment variable to `1`\n\n### Add more data to `gspread.Worksheet.__init__`\n\n```diff\n  gc = gspread.service_account(filename=\"google_credentials.json\")\n  spreadsheet = gc.open_by_key(\"{{key}}\")\n  properties = spreadsheet.fetch_sheet_metadata()[\"sheets\"][0][\"properties\"]\n- worksheet = gspread.Worksheet(spreadsheet, properties)\n+ worksheet = gspread.Worksheet(spreadsheet, properties, spreadsheet.id, gc.http_client)\n```\n\n</details>\n\n## More Examples\n\n### Opening a Spreadsheet\n\n```python\n# You can open a spreadsheet by its title as it appears in Google Docs\nsh = gc.open('My poor gym results') # <-- Look ma, no keys!\n\n# If you want to be specific, use a key (which can be extracted from\n# the spreadsheet's url)\nsht1 = gc.open_by_key('0BmgG6nO_6dprdS1MN3d3MkdPa142WFRrdnRRUWl1UFE')\n\n# Or, if you feel really lazy to extract that key, paste the entire url\nsht2 = gc.open_by_url('https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Bm...FE&hl')\n```\n\n### Creating a Spreadsheet\n\n```python\nsh = gc.create('A new spreadsheet')\n\n# But that new spreadsheet will be visible only to your script's account.\n# To be able to access newly created spreadsheet you *must* share it\n# with your email. Which brings us to…\n```\n\n### Sharing a Spreadsheet\n\n```python\nsh.share('otto@example.com', perm_type='user', role='writer')\n```\n\n### Selecting a Worksheet\n\n```python\n# Select worksheet by index. Worksheet indexes start from zero\nworksheet = sh.get_worksheet(0)\n\n# By title\nworksheet = sh.worksheet(\"January\")\n\n# Most common case: Sheet1\nworksheet = sh.sheet1\n\n# Get a list of all worksheets\nworksheet_list = sh.worksheets()\n```\n\n### Creating a Worksheet\n\n```python\nworksheet = sh.add_worksheet(title=\"A worksheet\", rows=\"100\", cols=\"20\")\n```\n\n### Deleting a Worksheet\n\n```python\nsh.del_worksheet(worksheet)\n```\n\n### Getting a Cell Value\n\n```python\n# With label\nval = worksheet.get('B1').first()\n\n# With coords\nval = worksheet.cell(1, 2).value\n```\n\n### Getting All Values From a Row or a Column\n\n```python\n# Get all values from the first row\nvalues_list = worksheet.row_values(1)\n\n# Get all values from the first column\nvalues_list = worksheet.col_values(1)\n```\n\n### Getting All Values From a Worksheet as a List of Lists\n\n```python\nfrom gspread.utils import GridRangeType\nlist_of_lists = worksheet.get(return_type=GridRangeType.ListOfLists)\n```\n\n### Getting a range of values\n\nReceive only the cells with a value in them.\n\n```python\n>>> worksheet.get(\"A1:B4\")\n[['A1', 'B1'], ['A2']]\n```\n\nReceive a rectangular array around the cells with values in them.\n\n```python\n>>> worksheet.get(\"A1:B4\", pad_values=True)\n[['A1', 'B1'], ['A2', '']]\n```\n\nReceive an array matching the request size regardless of if values are empty or not.\n\n```python\n>>> worksheet.get(\"A1:B4\", maintain_size=True)\n[['A1', 'B1'], ['A2', ''], ['', ''], ['', '']]\n```\n\n### Finding a Cell\n\n```python\n# Find a cell with exact string value\ncell = worksheet.find(\"Dough\")\n\nprint(\"Found something at R%sC%s\" % (cell.row, cell.col))\n\n# Find a cell matching a regular expression\namount_re = re.compile(r'(Big|Enormous) dough')\ncell = worksheet.find(amount_re)\n```\n\n### Finding All Matched Cells\n\n```python\n# Find all cells with string value\ncell_list = worksheet.findall(\"Rug store\")\n\n# Find all cells with regexp\ncriteria_re = re.compile(r'(Small|Room-tiering) rug')\ncell_list = worksheet.findall(criteria_re)\n```\n\n### Updating Cells\n\n```python\n# Update a single cell\nworksheet.update_acell('B1', 'Bingo!')\n\n# Update a range\nworksheet.update([[1, 2], [3, 4]], 'A1:B2')\n\n# Update multiple ranges at once\nworksheet.batch_update([{\n    'range': 'A1:B2',\n    'values': [['A1', 'B1'], ['A2', 'B2']],\n}, {\n    'range': 'J42:K43',\n    'values': [[1, 2], [3, 4]],\n}])\n```\n\n### Get unformatted cell value or formula\n\n```python\nfrom gspread.utils import ValueRenderOption\n\n# Get formatted cell value as displayed in the UI\n>>> worksheet.get(\"A1:B2\")\n[['$12.00']]\n\n# Get unformatted value from the same cell range\n>>> worksheet.get(\"A1:B2\", value_render_option=ValueRenderOption.unformatted)\n[[12]]\n\n# Get formula from a cell\n>>> worksheet.get(\"C2:D2\", value_render_option=ValueRenderOption.formula)\n[['=1/1024']]\n```\n\n### Add data validation to a range\n\n```python\nimport gspread\nfrom gspread.utils import ValidationConditionType\n\n# Restrict the input to greater than 10 in a single cell\nworksheet.add_validation(\n  'A1',\n  ValidationConditionType.number_greater,\n  [10],\n  strict=True,\n  inputMessage='Value must be greater than 10',\n)\n\n# Restrict the input to Yes/No for a specific range with dropdown\nworksheet.add_validation(\n  'C2:C7',\n   ValidationConditionType.one_of_list,\n   ['Yes',\n   'No',]\n   showCustomUi=True\n)\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\n[Documentation]\\: [https://gspread.readthedocs.io/][Documentation]\n\n[Documentation]: https://gspread.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\n### Ask Questions\n\nThe best way to get an answer to a question is to ask on [Stack Overflow with a gspread tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/gspread?sort=votes&pageSize=50).\n\n## Contributors\n\n[List of contributors](https://github.com/burnash/gspread/graphs/contributors)\n\n## How to Contribute\n\nPlease make sure to take a moment and read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/burnash/gspread/blob/master/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n### Report Issues\n\nPlease report bugs and suggest features via the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/burnash/gspread/issues).\n\nBefore opening an issue, search the tracker for possible duplicates.
