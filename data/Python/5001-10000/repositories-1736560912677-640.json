Clone repository:\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/mitre/caldera.git --recursive\n```\n\n2. Create a virtualenv:\n```\npython3 -m venv venv\n. venv/bin/activate\n```\n\n3. Install dependencies:\n```\npip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt\n```\n\n4. Install the pre-commit hooks:\n```\npre-commit install --install-hooks\n```\n\n# Developing\nWe use the basic feature branch GIT flow. Fork this repository and create a feature branch off of master and when ready, submit a merge request. Make branch names and commits descriptive. A merge request should solve one problem, not many.\n\n* Tests should cover any code changes that you have made. The test that you write should fail without your patch.\n* [Run tests](#run-the-tests)\n\n# Run the tests\nTests can be run by executing:\n```\npython -m pytest --asyncio-mode=auto\n```\nThis will run all unit tests in your current development environment. Depending on the level of the change, you might need to run the test suite on various versions of Python. The unit testing pipeline will run the entire suite across multiple Python versions that we support when you submit your PR.\n\nWe utilize `tox` to test Caldera in multiple versions of Python. This will only run if the interpreter is present on your system. To run tox, execute:\n```\ntox\n```\n\n# Code Coverage\nYou can generate code coverage reports manually or by running `tox`. To run them manually, you must have `coverage` installed and run the following commands:\n```\ncoverage run -m pytest\ncoverage report\ncoverage html\n```\nYou can find the code coverage report in `htmlcov/index.html`"

This is the framework code, consisting of what is available in this repository. Included is\nan asynchronous command-and-control (C2) server with a REST API and a web interface.\n2) **Plugins**. These repositories expand the core framework capabilities and providing additional functionality. Examples include agents, reporting, collections of TTPs and more.\n\n## Resources & Socials\n* 📜 [Documentation, training, and use-cases](https://caldera.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n* ✍️ [Caldera's blog](https://medium.com/@mitrecaldera/welcome-to-the-official-mitre-caldera-blog-page-f34c2cdfef09)\n* 🌐 [Homepage](https://caldera.mitre.org)\n\n## Plugins\n\n:star: Create your own plugin! Plugin generator: **[Skeleton](https://github.com/mitre/skeleton)** :star:\n\n### Default\nThese plugins are supported and maintained by the Caldera team.\n- **[Access](https://github.com/mitre/access)** (red team initial access tools and techniques)\n- **[Atomic](https://github.com/mitre/atomic)** (Atomic Red Team project TTPs)\n- **[Builder](https://github.com/mitre/builder)** (dynamically compile payloads)\n- **[Caldera for OT](https://github.com/mitre/caldera-ot)** (ICS/OT capabilities for Caldera)\n- **[Compass](https://github.com/mitre/compass)** (ATT&CK visualizations)\n- **[Debrief](https://github.com/mitre/debrief)** (operations insights)\n- **[Emu](https://github.com/mitre/emu)** (CTID emulation plans)\n- **[Fieldmanual](https://github.com/mitre/fieldmanual)** (documentation)\n- **[GameBoard](https://github.com/mitre/gameboard)** (visualize joint red and blue operations)\n- **[Human](https://github.com/mitre/human)** (create simulated noise on an endpoint)\n- **[Magma](https://github.com/mitre/magma)** (VueJS UI for Caldera v5)\n- **[Manx](https://github.com/mitre/manx)** (shell functionality and reverse shell payloads)\n- **[Response](https://github.com/mitre/response)** (incident response)\n- **[Sandcat](https://github.com/mitre/sandcat)** (default agent)\n- **[SSL](https://github.com/mitre/SSL)** (enable https for caldera)\n- **[Stockpile](https://github.com/mitre/stockpile)** (technique and profile storehouse)\n- **[Training](https://github.com/mitre/training)** (certification and training course)\n\n### More\nThese plugins are ready to use but are not included by default and are not maintained by the Caldera team.\n- **[Arsenal](https://github.com/mitre-atlas/arsenal)** (MITRE ATLAS techniques and profiles)\n- **[BountyHunter](https://github.com/fkie-cad/bountyhunter)** (The Bounty Hunter)\n- **[CalTack](https://github.com/mitre/caltack.git)** (embedded ATT&CK website)\n- **[SAML](https://github.com/mitre/saml)** (SAML authentication)\n\n## Requirements\n\nThese requirements are for the computer running the core framework:\n\n* Any Linux or MacOS\n* Python 3.8+ (with Pip3)\n* Recommended hardware to run on is 8GB+ RAM and 2+ CPUs\n* Recommended: GoLang 1.17+ to dynamically compile GoLang-based agents.\n* NodeJS (v16+ recommended for v5 VueJS UI)\n\n## Installation\n\nConcise installation steps:\n```Bash\ngit clone https://github.com/mitre/caldera.git --recursive\ncd caldera\npip3 install -r requirements.txt\npython3 server.py --insecure --build\n```\n\nFull steps:\nStart by cloning this repository recursively, passing the desired version/release in x.x.x format. This will pull in all available plugins.\n```Bash\ngit clone https://github.com/mitre/caldera.git --recursive --tag x.x.x\n```\n\nNext, install the PIP requirements:\n```Bash\npip3 install -r requirements.txt\n```\n**Super-power your Caldera server installation! [Install GoLang (1.19+)](https://go.dev/doc/install)**\n\nFinally, start the server.\n```Bash\npython3 server.py --insecure --build\n```\nThe `--build` flag automatically installs any VueJS UI dependencies, bundles the UI into a dist directory, writes the Magma plugin's `.env` file, and is served by the Caldera server. You will only have to use the `--build` flag again if you add any plugins or make any changes to the UI.\nOnce started, log into http://localhost:8888 using the default credentials red/admin. Then go into Plugins -> Training and complete the capture-the-flag style training course to learn how to use Caldera.\n\nIn some situations the default configuration values can cause the UI to appear unresponsive due to misrouted requests. Modify the `app.frontend.api_base_url` config value and start the server using the --build flag to update the UI's request URL environment variable.\n\nIf you prefer to not use the new VueJS UI, revert to Caldera v4.2.0. Correspondingly, do not use the `--build` flag for earlier versions as not required.\n\n### User Interface Development\n\nIf you'll be developing the UI, there are a few more additional installation steps.\n\n**Requirements**  \n* NodeJS (v16+ recommended)\n\n**Setup**\n\n1. Add the Magma submodule if you haven't already: `git submodule add https://github.com/mitre/magma`\n1. Install NodeJS dependencies: `cd plugins/magma && npm install && cd ..`\n1. Start the Caldera server with an additional flag: `python3 server.py --uidev localhost`\n\nYour Caldera server is available at http://localhost:8888 as usual, but there will now be a hot-reloading development server for the VueJS front-end available at http://localhost:3000. Both logs from the server and the front-end will display in the terminal you launched the server from.\n\n## Docker Deployment\nTo build a Caldera docker image, ensure you have docker installed and perform the following actions:\n```Bash\n# Recursively clone the Caldera repository if you have not done so\ngit clone https://github.com/mitre/caldera.git --recursive\n\n# Build the docker image. Change image tagging as desired.\n# WIN_BUILD is set to true to allow Caldera installation to compile windows-based agents.\n# Alternatively, you can use the docker compose YML file via \"docker-compose build\"\ncd caldera\ndocker build . --build-arg WIN_BUILD=true -t caldera:latest\n\n# Run the image. Change port forwarding configuration as desired.\ndocker run -p 8888:8888 caldera:latest\n```\n\nTo gracefully terminate your docker container, do the following:\n```Bash\n# Find the container ID for your docker container running Caldera\ndocker ps\n\n# Stop the container\ndocker stop [container ID]\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nRefer to our [contributor documentation](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Vulnerability Disclosures\n\nRefer to our [Vulnerability Disclosure Documentation](SECURITY.md) for submitting bugs.\n\n## Licensing\n\nTo discuss licensing opportunities, please reach out to caldera@mitre.org or directly to [MITRE's Technology Transfer Office](https://www.mitre.org/about/corporate-overview/contact-us#technologycontact).\n\n## Caldera Benefactor Program\n\nIf you are interested in partnering to support, sustain, and evolve MITRE Caldera&trade;'s open source capabilities, please contact us at caldera@mitre.org.\n"

          "content": "# Vulnerability Disclosure Policy \n\n## Introduction\n\nThis policy is intended to give security researchers clear guidelines for conducting vulnerability discovery activities and to convey our preferences in how to submit discovered vulnerabilities to us.\n\nThis policy describes **what systems and types of research** are covered under this policy, **how to send us** vulnerability reports, and **how long** we ask security researchers to wait before publicly disclosing vulnerabilities.\n\nWe encourage you to contact us to report potential vulnerabilities in our systems.\n\n**For vulnerability reports email us at <caldera@mitre.org>**. Reports may be submitted anonymously.  \n\n## Authorization \n\nIf you make a good faith effort to comply with this policy during your security research, we will consider your research to be authorized we will work with you to understand and resolve the issue quickly.  \n\n## Guidelines\n\nUnder this policy, \"research\" means activities in which you:\n\n-   Notify us as soon as possible after you discover a real or potential security issue.\n\n-   Only use exploits to the extent necessary to confirm a vulnerability's presence.\n\n-   Provide us a reasonable amount of time to resolve the issue before you disclose it publicly.\n\n-   Do not submit a high volume of low-quality reports.  \n\n## Reporting a vulnerability\n\nInformation submitted under this policy will be used for defensive purposes only, i.e. to mitigate or remediate vulnerabilities. Since Caldera is run by a not-for-profit and is open source by nature, by\nsubmitting a vulnerability, you acknowledge that you have no expectation of payment. However, we will ensure that credit is given to the bug finder.  \n\n## What we would like to see from you\n\nTo help us triage and prioritize submissions, please include the following in your report:\n\n- Affected version of Caldera (committed hash or version number), operating system used, and python version.\n\n- Describe the location the vulnerability was discovered and the potential impact of exploitation.\n\n- Offer a detailed description of the steps needed to reproduce the vulnerability (proof of concept scripts or screenshots are helpful).\n\n- Be in English, if possible.  \n\n## What you can expect from us\n\nWhen you choose to share your contact information with us, we commit to coordinating with you as openly and as quickly as possible.\n\n-   Within ***10 business days***, we will acknowledge that your report has been received.\n\n-   After notifying the Caldera team, we will open reported issues to the public within ***90 days***, or after a fix is released (whichever comes first).\n\n-   To the best of our ability, we will confirm the existence of the vulnerability to you and be as transparent as possible about what steps we are taking during the remediation process, including on issues or challenges that may delay resolution.\n\n-   We will maintain an open dialogue to discuss issues.\n\n-   We will work with you in issuing a CVE and receiving proper credit for helping us secure our platform.  \n\n## Questions\n\nQuestions regarding this policy may be sent to [**caldera@mitre.org**](mailto:caldera@mitre.org). We also invite you to contact us with suggestions for improving this policy.  \n\n## Document change history\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  **Version**   **Date**                                **Description**\n  ------------- --------------------------------------- -----------------------\n  1.0           *Nov 15, 2022*                       First issuance.\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n"
