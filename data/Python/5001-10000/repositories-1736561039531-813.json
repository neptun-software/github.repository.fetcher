          "content": "# Contribution guidelines\n\n## What to work on?\n\nWe have a [public roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/online-ml/projects/3) that lists what has been done, what we're currently doing, and what needs doing. There's also an icebox with high level ideas that need framing. You're welcome to pick anything that takes your fancy and that you deem important. Feel free to [open a discussion](https://github.com/online-ml/river/discussions/new) if you want to clarify a topic and/or want to be formally assigned a task in the board.\n\nOf course, you're welcome to propose and contribute new ideas. We encourage you to [open a discussion](https://github.com/online-ml/river/discussions/new) so that we can align on the work to be done. It's generally a good idea to have a quick discussion before opening a pull request that is potentially out-of-scope.\n\n## Fork/clone/pull\n\nThe typical workflow for contributing to River is:\n\n1. Fork the `main` branch from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/online-ml/river/).\n2. Clone your fork locally.\n3. Commit changes.\n4. Push the changes to your fork.\n5. Send a pull request from your fork back to the original `main` branch.\n\n## Local setup\n\nStart by cloning the repository:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/online-ml/river\n```\n\nNext, you'll need a Python environment. A nice way to manage your Python versions is to use pyenv, which can installed [here](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer). Once you have pyenv, you can install the latest Python version River supports:\n\n```sh\npyenv install -v $(cat .python-version)\n```\n\nYou need a `Rust` compiler you can install it by following this [link](https://www.rust-lang.org/fr/tools/install). You'll also need [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/):\n\n```sh\ncurl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -\n```\n\nNow you're set to install River and activate the virtual environment:\n\n```sh\npoetry install\npoetry shell\n```\n\nFinally, install the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) push hooks. This will run some code quality checks every time you push to GitHub.\n\n```sh\npre-commit install --hook-type pre-push\n```\n\nYou can optionally run `pre-commit` at any time as so:\n\n```sh\npre-commit run --all-files\n```\n\n## Making changes\n\nYou're now ready to make some changes. We strongly recommend that you to check out River's source code for inspiration before getting into the thick of it. How you make the changes is up to you of course. However we can give you some pointers as to how to test your changes. Here is an example workflow that works for most cases:\n\n- Create and open a Jupyter notebook at the root of the directory.\n- Add the following in the code cell:\n\n```py\n%load_ext autoreload\n%autoreload 2\n```\n\n- The previous code will automatically reimport River for you whenever you make changes.\n- For instance, if a change is made to `linear_model.LinearRegression`, then rerunning the following code doesn't require rebooting the notebook:\n\n```py\nfrom river import linear_model\n\nmodel = linear_model.LinearRegression()\n```\n\n## Creating a new estimator\n\n1. Pick a base class from the `base` module.\n2. Check if any of the mixin classes from the `base` module apply to your implementation.\n3. Make you've implemented the required methods, with the following exceptions:\n   1. Stateless transformers do not require a `learn_one` method.\n   2. In case of a classifier, the `predict_one` is implemented by default, but can be overridden.\n4. Add type hints to the parameters of the `__init__` method.\n5. If possible provide a default value for each parameter. If, for whatever reason, no good default exists, then implement the `_unit_test_params` method. This is a private method that is meant to be used for testing.\n6. Write a comprehensive docstring with example usage. Try to have empathy for new users when you do this.\n7. Check that the class you have implemented is imported in the `__init__.py` file of the module it belongs to.\n8. When you're done, run the `utils.check_estimator` function on your class and check that no exceptions are raised.\n\n## Documenting your change\n\nIf you're adding a class or a function, then you'll need to add a docstring. We follow the [Google docstring convention](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html), so please do too.\n\nTo build the documentation, you need to install some extra dependencies:\n\n```sh\npoetry install --with docs\npip install git+https://github.com/MaxHalford/yamp\n```\n\nFrom the root of the repository, you can then run the `make livedoc` command to take a look at the documentation in your browser. This will run a custom script which parses all the docstrings and generate MarkDown files that [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) can render.\n\n## Adding a release note\n\nAll classes and function are automatically picked up and added to the documentation. The only thing you have to do is to add an entry to the relevant file in the [`docs/releases` directory](docs/releases).\n\n## Build Cython and Rust extensions\n\n```sh\npoetry install\n```\n\n## Testing\n\n**Unit tests**\n\nThese tests absolutely have to pass.\n\n```sh\npytest\n```\n\n**Static typing**\n\nThese tests absolutely have to pass.\n\n```sh\nmypy river\n```\n\n**Web dependent tests**\n\nThis involves tests that need an internet connection, such as those in the `datasets` module which requires downloading some files. In most cases you probably don't need to run these.\n\n```sh\npytest -m web\n```\n\n**Notebook tests**\n\nYou don't have to worry too much about these, as we only check them before each release. If you break them because you changed some code, then it's probably because the notebooks have to be modified, not the other way around.\n\n```sh\nmake execute-notebooks\n```\n\n## Making a new release\n\n1. Checkout `main`\n2. Run `make execute-notebooks` just to be safe\n3. Run the [benchmarks](benchmarks)\n4. Bump the version in `river/__version__.py`\n5. Bump the version in `pyproject.toml`\n6. Tag and date the `docs/releases/unreleased.md` file\n7. Commit and push\n8. Wait for CI to [run the unit tests](https://github.com/online-ml/river/actions/workflows/ci.yml)\n9. Push the tag:\n\n```sh\nRIVER_VERSION=$(python -c \"import river; print(river.__version__)\")\necho $RIVER_VERSION\n```\n\n```sh\ngit tag $RIVER_VERSION\ngit push origin $RIVER_VERSION\n```\n\n9. Wait for CI to [ship to PyPI](https://github.com/online-ml/river/actions/workflows/pypi.yml) and [publish the new docs](https://github.com/online-ml/river/actions/workflows/release-docs.yml)\n10. Create a [release](https://github.com/online-ml/river/releases):\n\n```sh\nRELEASE_NOTES=$(cat <<-END\n- https://riverml.xyz/${RIVER_VERSION}/releases/${RIVER_VERSION}/\n- https://pypi.org/project/river/${RIVER_VERSION}/\nEND\n)\nbrew update && brew install gh\ngh release create $RIVER_VERSION --notes $RELEASE_NOTES\n```\n\n11. Pyodide needs to be told there is a new release. This can done by updating [`packages/river`](https://github.com/online-ml/pyodide/tree/main/packages/river) in [online-ml/pyodide](https://github.com/online-ml/pyodide)\n"

It aims to be the most user-friendly library for doing machine learning on streaming data. River is the result of a merger between <a href=\"https://github.com/MaxHalford/creme\">creme</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/scikit-multiflow/scikit-multiflow\">scikit-multiflow</a>.\n</p>\n\n## ⚡️ Quickstart\n\nAs a quick example, we'll train a logistic regression to classify the [website phishing dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Website+Phishing). Here's a look at the first observation in the dataset.\n\n```python\n>>> from pprint import pprint\n>>> from river import datasets\n\n>>> dataset = datasets.Phishing()\n\n>>> for x, y in dataset:\n...     pprint(x)\n...     print(y)\n...     break\n{'age_of_domain': 1,\n 'anchor_from_other_domain': 0.0,\n 'empty_server_form_handler': 0.0,\n 'https': 0.0,\n 'ip_in_url': 1,\n 'is_popular': 0.5,\n 'long_url': 1.0,\n 'popup_window': 0.0,\n 'request_from_other_domain': 0.0}\nTrue\n\n```\n\nNow let's run the model on the dataset in a streaming fashion. We sequentially interleave predictions and model updates. Meanwhile, we update a performance metric to see how well the model is doing.\n\n```python\n>>> from river import compose\n>>> from river import linear_model\n>>> from river import metrics\n>>> from river import preprocessing\n\n>>> model = compose.Pipeline(\n...     preprocessing.StandardScaler(),\n...     linear_model.LogisticRegression()\n... )\n\n>>> metric = metrics.Accuracy()\n\n>>> for x, y in dataset:\n...     y_pred = model.predict_one(x)      # make a prediction\n...     metric.update(y, y_pred)  # update the metric\n...     model.learn_one(x, y)              # make the model learn\n\n>>> metric\nAccuracy: 89.28%\n\n```\n\nOf course, this is just a contrived example. We welcome you to check the [introduction](https://riverml.xyz/dev/introduction/installation/) section of the documentation for a more thorough tutorial.\n\n## 🛠 Installation\n\nRiver is intended to work with **Python 3.10 and above**. Installation can be done with `pip`:\n\n```sh\npip install river\n```\n\nThere are [wheels available](https://pypi.org/project/river/#files) for Linux, MacOS, and Windows. This means you most probably won't have to build River from source.\n\nYou can install the latest development version from GitHub as so:\n\n```sh\npip install git+https://github.com/online-ml/river --upgrade\npip install git+ssh://git@github.com/online-ml/river.git --upgrade  # using SSH\n```\n\nThis method requires having Cython and Rust installed on your machine.\n\n## 🔮 Features\n\nRiver provides online implementations of the following family of algorithms:\n\n- Linear models, with a wide array of optimizers\n- Decision trees and random forests\n- (Approximate) nearest neighbors\n- Anomaly detection\n- Drift detection\n- Recommender systems\n- Time series forecasting\n- Bandits\n- Factorization machines\n- Imbalanced learning\n- Clustering\n- Bagging/boosting/stacking\n- Active learning\n\nRiver also provides other online utilities:\n\n- Feature extraction and selection\n- Online statistics and metrics\n- Preprocessing\n- Built-in datasets\n- Progressive model validation\n- Model pipelines\n\nCheck out [the API](https://riverml.xyz/latest/api/overview/) for a comprehensive overview\n\n## 🤔 Should I be using River?\n\nYou should ask yourself if you need online machine learning. The answer is likely no. Most of the time batch learning does the job just fine. An online approach might fit the bill if:\n\n- You want a model that can learn from new data without having to revisit past data.\n- You want a model which is robust to [concept drift](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Concept_drift).\n- You want to develop your model in a way that is closer to what occurs in a production context, which is usually event-based.\n\nSome specificities of River are that:\n\n- It focuses on clarity and user experience, more so than performance.\n- It's very fast at processing one sample at a time. Try it, you'll see.\n- It plays nicely with the rest of Python's ecosystem.\n\n## 🔗 Useful links\n\n- [Documentation](https://riverml.xyz)\n- [Package releases](https://pypi.org/project/river/#history)\n- [awesome-online-machine-learning](https://github.com/online-ml/awesome-online-machine-learning)\n- [2022 presentation at GAIA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzFTmJnIakk&list=PLIU25-FciwNaz5PqWPiHmPCMOFYoEsJ8c&index=5)\n- [Online Clustering: Algorithms, Evaluation, Metrics, Applications and Benchmarking](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3534678.3542600) from [KDD'22](https://kdd.org/kdd2022/).\n\n## 👐 Contributing\n\nFeel free to contribute in any way you like, we're always open to new ideas and approaches.\n\n- [Open a discussion](https://github.com/online-ml/river/discussions/new) if you have any question or enquiry whatsoever.
