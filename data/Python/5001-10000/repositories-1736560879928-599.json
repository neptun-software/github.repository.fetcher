Click [here](https://github.com/tyiannak/pyAudioAnalysis/wiki) for the complete wiki and [here](https://hackernoon.com/audio-handling-basics-how-to-process-audio-files-using-python-cli-jo283u3y) for a more generic intro to audio data handling*\n\n## News\n * [2022-01-01] If you are not interested in training audio models from your own data, you can check the [Deep Audio API](https://labs-repos.iit.demokritos.gr/MagCIL/deep_audio_api.html), were you can directly send audio data and receive predictions with regards to the respective audio content (speech vs silence, musical genre, speaker gender, etc). \n * [2021-08-06] [deep-audio-features](https://github.com/tyiannak/deep_audio_features) deep audio classification and feature extraction using CNNs and Pytorch \n * Check out [paura](https://github.com/tyiannak/paura) a Python script for realtime recording and analysis of audio data\n\n## General\npyAudioAnalysis is a Python library covering a wide range of audio analysis tasks. Through pyAudioAnalysis you can:\n * Extract audio *features* and representations (e.g. mfccs, spectrogram, chromagram)\n * *Train*, parameter tune and *evaluate* classifiers of audio segments\n * *Classify* unknown sounds\n * *Detect* audio events and exclude silence periods from long recordings\n * Perform *supervised segmentation* (joint segmentation - classification)\n * Perform *unsupervised segmentation* (e.g. speaker diarization) and extract audio *thumbnails*\n * Train and use *audio regression* models (example application: emotion recognition)\n * Apply dimensionality reduction to *visualize* audio data and content similarities\n\n## Installation\n * Clone the source of this library: `git clone https://github.com/tyiannak/pyAudioAnalysis.git`\n * Install dependencies: `pip install -r ./requirements.txt `\n * Install using pip: `pip install -e .`\n\n## An audio classification example\n> More examples and detailed tutorials can be found [at the wiki](https://github.com/tyiannak/pyAudioAnalysis/wiki)\n\npyAudioAnalysis provides easy-to-call wrappers to execute audio analysis tasks. Eg, this code first trains an audio segment classifier, given a set of WAV files stored in folders (each folder representing a different class) and then the trained classifier is used to classify an unknown audio WAV file\n\n```python\nfrom pyAudioAnalysis import audioTrainTest as aT\naT.extract_features_and_train([\"classifierData/music\",\"classifierData/speech\"], 1.0, 1.0, aT.shortTermWindow, aT.shortTermStep, \"svm\", \"svmSMtemp\", False)\naT.file_classification(\"data/doremi.wav\", \"svmSMtemp\",\"svm\")\n```\n\n>Result:\n(0.0, array([ 0.90156761,  0.09843239]), ['music', 'speech'])\n\nIn addition, command-line support is provided for all functionalities. E.g. the following command extracts the spectrogram of an audio signal stored in a WAV file: `python audioAnalysis.py fileSpectrogram -i data/doremi.wav`\n\n## Further reading\n\nApart from this README file, to bettern understand how to use this library one should read the following:\n  * [Audio Handling Basics: Process Audio Files In Command-Line or Python](https://hackernoon.com/audio-handling-basics-how-to-process-audio-files-using-python-cli-jo283u3y), if you want to learn how to handle audio files from command line, and some basic programming on audio signal processing. Start with that if you don't know anything about audio. \n  * [Intro to Audio Analysis: Recognizing Sounds Using Machine Learning](https://hackernoon.com/intro-to-audio-analysis-recognizing-sounds-using-machine-learning-qy2r3ufl) This goes a bit deeper than the previous article, by providing a complete intro to theory and practice of audio feature extraction, classification and segmentation (includes many Python examples).\n * [The library's wiki](https://github.com/tyiannak/pyAudioAnalysis/wiki)\n * [How to Use Machine Learning to Color Your Lighting Based on Music Mood](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-use-machine-learning-to-color-your-lighting-based-on-music-mood-bi163u8l). An interesting use-case of using this lib to train a real-time music mood estimator.\n  * A more general and theoretic description of the adopted methods (along with several experiments on particular use-cases) is presented [in this publication](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0144610). *Please use the following citation when citing pyAudioAnalysis in your research work*:\n```python\n@article{giannakopoulos2015pyaudioanalysis,\n  title={pyAudioAnalysis: An Open-Source Python Library for Audio Signal Analysis},\n  author={Giannakopoulos, Theodoros},\n  journal={PloS one},\n  volume={10},\n  number={12},\n  year={2015},\n  publisher={Public Library of Science}\n}\n```\n\nFor Matlab-related audio analysis material check  [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Audio-Analysis-MATLAB%C2%AE-Approach/dp/0080993885).\n\n## Author\n<img src=\"https://tyiannak.github.io/files/3.JPG\" align=\"left\" height=\"100\"/>\n\n[Theodoros Giannakopoulos](https://tyiannak.github.io),\nPrincipal Researcher of Multimodal Machine Learning at the [Multimedia Analysis Group of the Computational Intelligence Lab (MagCIL)](https://labs-repos.iit.demokritos.gr/MagCIL/index.html) of the Institute of Informatics and Telecommunications, of the National Center for Scientific Research \"Demokritos\"\n\n"
