Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

It is a part of the [OpenMMLab](https://openmmlab.com/) project.\n\nThe main branch works with **PyTorch 1.8+**.\n\n![demo image](resources/mmdet3d_outdoor_demo.gif)\n\n<details open>\n<summary>Major features</summary>\n\n- **Support multi-modality/single-modality detectors out of box**\n\n  It directly supports multi-modality/single-modality detectors including MVXNet, VoteNet, PointPillars, etc.\n\n- **Support indoor/outdoor 3D detection out of box**\n\n  It directly supports popular indoor and outdoor 3D detection datasets, including ScanNet, SUNRGB-D, Waymo, nuScenes, Lyft, and KITTI. For nuScenes dataset, we also support [nuImages dataset](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection3d/tree/main/configs/nuimages).\n\n- **Natural integration with 2D detection**\n\n  All the about **300+ models, methods of 40+ papers**, and modules supported in [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/blob/3.x/docs/en/model_zoo.md) can be trained or used in this codebase.\n\n- **High efficiency**\n\n  It trains faster than other codebases. The main results are as below. Details can be found in [benchmark.md](./docs/en/notes/benchmarks.md). We compare the number of samples trained per second (the higher, the better). The models that are not supported by other codebases are marked by `✗`.\n\n  |       Methods       | MMDetection3D | [OpenPCDet](https://github.com/open-mmlab/OpenPCDet) | [votenet](https://github.com/facebookresearch/votenet) | [Det3D](https://github.com/poodarchu/Det3D) |\n  | :-----------------: | :-----------: | :--------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------------: |\n  |       VoteNet       |      358      |                          ✗                           |                           77                           |                      ✗                      |\n  |  PointPillars-car   |      141      |                          ✗                           |                           ✗                            |                     140                     |\n  | PointPillars-3class |      107      |                          44                          |                           ✗                            |                      ✗                      |\n  |       SECOND        |      40       |                          30                          |                           ✗                            |                      ✗                      |\n  |       Part-A2       |      17       |                          14                          |                           ✗                            |                      ✗                      |\n\n</details>\n\nLike [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection) and [MMCV](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv), MMDetection3D can also be used as a library to support different projects on top of it.\n\n## What's New\n\n### Highlight\n\nIn version 1.4, MMDetecion3D refactors the Waymo dataset and accelerates the preprocessing, training/testing setup, and evaluation of Waymo dataset. We also extends the support for camera-based, such as Monocular and BEV, 3D object detection models on Waymo.

简介\n\nMMDetection3D 是一个基于 PyTorch 的目标检测开源工具箱，下一代面向 3D 检测的平台。它是 [OpenMMlab](https://openmmlab.com/) 项目的一部分。\n\n主分支代码目前支持 PyTorch 1.8 以上的版本。\n\n![demo image](resources/mmdet3d_outdoor_demo.gif)\n\n<details open>\n<summary>主要特性</summary>\n\n- **支持多模态/单模态的检测器**\n\n  支持多模态/单模态检测器，包括 MVXNet，VoteNet，PointPillars 等。\n\n- **支持户内/户外的数据集**\n\n  支持室内/室外的 3D 检测数据集，包括 ScanNet，SUNRGB-D，Waymo，nuScenes，Lyft，KITTI。对于 nuScenes 数据集，我们也支持 [nuImages 数据集](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection3d/tree/main/configs/nuimages)。\n\n- **与 2D 检测器的自然整合**\n\n  [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/blob/3.x/docs/zh_cn/model_zoo.md) 支持的 **300+ 个模型，40+ 的论文算法**，和相关模块都可以在此代码库中训练或使用。\n\n- **性能高**\n\n  训练速度比其他代码库更快。下表可见主要的对比结果。更多的细节可见[基准测评文档](./docs/zh_cn/notes/benchmarks.md)。我们对比了每秒训练的样本数（值越高越好）。其他代码库不支持的模型被标记为 `✗`。\n\n  |       Methods       | MMDetection3D |
