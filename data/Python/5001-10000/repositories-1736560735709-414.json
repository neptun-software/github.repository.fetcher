The aim of this project is to provide\na quick and simple working example for many of the cool VAE models out there. All the models are trained on the [CelebA dataset](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html)\nfor consistency and comparison. The architecture of all the models are kept as similar as possible with the same layers, except for cases where the original paper necessitates \na radically different architecture (Ex. VQ VAE uses Residual layers and no Batch-Norm, unlike other models).\nHere are the [results](https://github.com/AntixK/PyTorch-VAE/blob/master/README.md#--results) of each model.\n\n### Requirements\n- Python >= 3.5\n- PyTorch >= 1.3\n- Pytorch Lightning >= 0.6.0 ([GitHub Repo](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/tree/deb1581e26b7547baf876b7a94361e60bb200d32))\n- CUDA enabled computing device\n\n### Installation\n```\n$ git clone https://github.com/AntixK/PyTorch-VAE\n$ cd PyTorch-VAE\n$ pip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n### Usage\n```\n$ cd PyTorch-VAE\n$ python run.py -c configs/<config-file-name.yaml>\n```\n**Config file template**\n\n```yaml\nmodel_params:\n  name: \"<name of VAE model>\"\n  in_channels: 3\n  latent_dim: \n    .         # Other parameters required by the model\n    .\n    .\n\ndata_params:\n  data_path: \"<path to the celebA dataset>\"\n  train_batch_size: 64 # Better to have a square number\n  val_batch_size:  64\n  patch_size: 64  # Models are designed to work for this size\n  num_workers: 4\n  \nexp_params:\n  manual_seed: 1265\n  LR: 0.005\n  weight_decay:\n    .         # Other arguments required for training, like scheduler etc.\n    .\n    .\n\ntrainer_params:\n  gpus: 1         \n  max_epochs: 100\n  gradient_clip_val: 1.5\n    .\n    .\n    .\n\nlogging_params:\n  save_dir: \"logs/\"\n  name: \"<experiment name>\"\n```\n\n**View TensorBoard Logs**\n```\n$ cd logs/<experiment name>/version_<the version you want>\n$ tensorboard --logdir .\n```\n\n**Note:** The default dataset is CelebA. However, there has been many issues with downloading the dataset from google drive (owing to some file structure changes). So, the recommendation is to download the [file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m8-EBPgi5MRubrm6iQjafK2QMHDBMSfJ/view?usp=sharing) from google drive directly and extract to the path of your choice. The default path assumed in the config files is `Data/celeba/img_align_celeba'. But you can change it acording to your preference.\n\n\n----\n<h2 align=\"center\">\n  <b>Results</b><br>\n</h2>\n\n\n| Model                                                                  | Paper
