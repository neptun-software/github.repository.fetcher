The inference time can be reduced by using fewer DDIM steps.\n\n\n\n## ⚙️ Setup\n\n### Install Environment via Anaconda (Recommended)\n```bash\nconda create -n tooncrafter python=3.8.5\nconda activate tooncrafter\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n\n## 💫 Inference\n### 1. Command line\n\nDownload pretrained ToonCrafter_512 and put the `model.ckpt` in `checkpoints/tooncrafter_512_interp_v1/model.ckpt`.\n```bash\n  sh scripts/run.sh\n```\n\n\n### 2. Local Gradio demo\n\nDownload the pretrained model and put it in the corresponding directory according to the previous guidelines.\n```bash\n  python gradio_app.py \n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 🤝 Community Support\n1.

Please be cautious.\n\nCalm down. Our framework opens up the era of generative cartoon interpolation, but due to the variaity of generative video prior, the success rate is not guaranteed.\n\n⚠️This is an open-source research exploration, instead of commercial products. It can't meet all your expectations.\n\nThis project strives to impact the domain of AI-driven video generation positively.
