A lot of well-trained models and various real-world applications in both industry and academia help users conveniently build hands-on experiences in image segmentation.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/shiyutang/files/raw/main/teasor_new.gif\"  width = \"800\" />  \n</div>\n\n\n## <img src=\"./docs/images/feature.png\" width=\"20\"/> Features\n\n* **High-Performance Model**: Following the state of the art segmentation methods and using high-performance backbone networks, we provide 45+ models and 150+ high-quality pre-training models, which are better than other open-source implementations.\n\n* **High Efficiency**: PaddleSeg provides multi-process asynchronous I/O, multi-card parallel training, evaluation, and other acceleration strategies, combined with the memory optimization function of the PaddlePaddle, which can greatly reduce the training overhead of the segmentation model, all these allowing developers to train image segmentation models more efficiently and at a lower cost.\n\n* **Modular Design**: We build PaddleSeg with the modular design philosophy. Therefore, based on actual application scenarios, developers can assemble diversified training configurations with *data augmentation strategies*, *segmentation models*, *backbone networks*, *loss functions*, and other different components to meet different performance and accuracy requirements.\n\n* **Complete Flow**: PaddleSeg supports image labeling, model designing, model training, model compression, and model deployment. With the help of PaddleSeg, developers can easily finish all tasks in the entire workflow.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n<img
