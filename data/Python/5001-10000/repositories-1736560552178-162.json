This includes all channels of\ncommunication. We take reports of harassment or unwelcoming behavior very seriously. To report such behavior, please \ncontact us via [email](mailto:help@metaflow.org). \n\n### Code style\n\nWe use [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) as a code formatter. The easiest way to ensure your commits are always formatted with the correct version of `black` it is to use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/): install it and then run `pre-commit install` once in your local copy of the repo.\n\nWe also follow the [numpydoc](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) docstring style to enable automatic documentation using [nbdoc](https://github.com/outerbounds/nbdoc).\n"

Metaflow was [originally developed at Netflix](https://netflixtechblog.com/open-sourcing-metaflow-a-human-centric-framework-for-data-science-fa72e04a5d9) to boost productivity of data scientists who work on a wide variety of projects from classical statistics to state-of-the-art deep learning.\n\nFor more information, see [Metaflow's website](https://metaflow.org) and [documentation](https://docs.metaflow.org).\n\n## From prototype to production (and back)\n\nMetaflow provides a simple, friendly API that covers foundational needs of ML, AI, and data science projects:\n<img src=\"./docs/prototype-to-prod.png\" width=\"800px\">\n\n1. [Rapid local prototyping](https://docs.metaflow.org/metaflow/basics), [support for notebooks](https://docs.metaflow.org/metaflow/visualizing-results), and [built-in experiment tracking and versioning](https://docs.metaflow.org/metaflow/client).\n2. [Horizontal and vertical scalability to the cloud](https://docs.metaflow.org/scaling/remote-tasks/introduction), utilizing both CPUs and GPUs, and [fast data access](https://docs.metaflow.org/scaling/data).\n3. [Managing dependencies](https://docs.metaflow.org/scaling/dependencies) and [one-click deployments to highly available production orchestrators](https://docs.metaflow.org/production/introduction).\n\n\n## Getting started\n\nGetting up and running is easy. If you don't know where to start, [Metaflow sandbox](https://outerbounds.com/sandbox) will have you running and exploring Metaflow in seconds.\n\n### Installing Metaflow in your Python environment\n\nTo install Metaflow in your local environment, you can install from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/metaflow/):\n\n```sh\npip install metaflow\n```\nAlternatively, you can also install from [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/metaflow):\n\n```sh\nconda install -c conda-forge metaflow\n```\nIf you are eager to try out Metaflow in practice, you can start with the [tutorial](https://docs.metaflow.org/getting-started/tutorials). After the tutorial, you can learn more about how Metaflow works [here](https://docs.metaflow.org/metaflow/basics).\n\n### Deploying infrastructure for Metaflow in your cloud\n<img src=\"./docs/multicloud.png\" width=\"800px\">\n\n\nWhile you can get started with Metaflow easily on your laptop, the main benefits of Metaflow lie in its ability to [scale out to external compute clusters](https://docs.metaflow.org/scaling/remote-tasks/introduction) \nand to [deploy to production-grade workflow orchestrators](https://docs.metaflow.org/production/introduction). To benefit from these features, follow this [guide](https://outerbounds.com/engineering/welcome/) to \nconfigure Metaflow and the infrastructure behind it appropriately.\n\n## [Resources](https://docs.metaflow.org/introduction/metaflow-resources)\n\n### [Slack Community](http://slack.outerbounds.co/)\nAn active [community](http://slack.outerbounds.co/) of thousands of data scientists and ML engineers discussing the ins-and-outs of applied machine learning.\n\n### [Tutorials](https://outerbounds.com/docs/tutorials-index/)\n- [Introduction to Metaflow](https://outerbounds.com/docs/intro-tutorial-overview/)\n- [Natural Language Processing with Metaflow](https://outerbounds.com/docs/nlp-tutorial-overview/)\n- [Computer Vision with Metaflow](https://outerbounds.com/docs/cv-tutorial-overview/)\n- [Recommender Systems with Metaflow](https://outerbounds.com/docs/recsys-tutorial-overview/)\n- And more advanced content [here](https://outerbounds.com/docs/tutorials-index/)\n\n### [Generative AI and LLM use cases](https://outerbounds.com/blog/?category=Foundation%20Models)\n- [Infrastructure Stack for Large Language Models](https://outerbounds.com/blog/llm-infrastructure-stack/)\n- [Parallelizing Stable Diffusion for Production Use Cases](https://outerbounds.com/blog/parallelizing-stable-diffusion-production-use-cases/)\n- [Whisper with Metaflow on Kubernetes](https://outerbounds.com/blog/whisper-kubernetes/)\n- [Training a Large Language Model With Metaflow, Featuring Dolly](https://outerbounds.com/blog/train-dolly-metaflow/)\n\n## Get in touch\nThere are several ways to get in touch with us:\n- [Slack Community](http://slack.outerbounds.co/)\n- [Github Issues](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/issues)\n\n## Contributing\nWe welcome contributions to Metaflow.
