This allows users to provide incomplete themes. Missing theme files will be provided from the built-in core theme\n- CTFd will now pass the title of a Page over to the template when rendering\n- No longer show the token type in user settings\n- Added `window.BETA_sortChallenges` to `/challenges` so that theme code can more easily define how to sort challenges\n  - Note that this functionality is beta because we expect to revamp the entire themes system\n- Added `window.updateChallengeBoard` to `/challenges` so that theme code can more easily define when to update challenges\n  - Note that this functionality is beta because we expect to revamp the entire themes system\n- Added `window.updateScoreboard` to `/scoreboard` so that theme code can more easily define when to update the scoreboard\n  - Note that this functionality is beta because we expect to revamp the entire themes system\n\n**Plugins**\n\n- Added `Challenges.plugin_class` to the Challenges model to access the challenge type plugin class from the Model\n  - Allows templates to access the plugin class more easily\n  - Allows plugins to access the plugin class without having to load the class explicitly\n\n**Admin Panel**\n\n- Reworked the Challenge Requirements UI\n  - Officially support the concept of anonymized challenges if prerequisites aren't met\n- Added ability for Pages to be written in direct HTML instead of Markdown\n- Pages now have access to variables `ctf_name`, `ctf_description`, `ctf_start`, `ctf_end`, `ctf_freeze`\n  - `ctf_start`, `ctf_end`, `ctf_freeze` are represented as ISO8601 timestamps\n- Make it easier to change the user mode without having to delete all accounts. Instead we will only delete all submissions.\n- When in team mode, user pages will now show their team's score instead of their own personal score\n- Show a team member's individual score on their team's page\n- Made the challenge creation form wider\n\n**Deployment**\n\n- The `THEME_FALLBACK` config is now set to true by default\n- Replace installation and usage of `mysqladmin` (specifically `mysqladmin ping`) with a custom Python script\n- Bump version of `pybluemonday` to 0.0.7 (fixes HTML sanitization bypasses and allows comments in HTML)\n- Bump `pydantic` from 1.5.1 to 1.6.2\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\n- Make `.dockerignore` ignore `node_modules` in any subdirectory\n- Added `solves` and `solved_by_me` fields to the Swagger documentation for Challenges\n- Dynamic challenges will now take their initial valuation from the `inital` keyword instead of the previous `value` keyword.\n  - This allows ctfcli to manage dynamic challenges. See https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd/issues/1875\n- Added a timestamp to a CTFd export's filename\n- Deleting uploads under the Filesystem upload provider will now delete the parent folder as well as the target file\n\n# 3.3.1 / 2021-07-15\n\n**Security**\n\n- Fixes an issue where users could join teams without knowing the team password or having a team invite\n\n# 3.3.0 / 2021-03-26\n\n**General**\n\n- Don't require a team for viewing challenges if Challenge visibility is set to public\n- Add a `THEME_FALLBACK` config to help develop themes. See **Themes** section for details.\n\n**API**\n\n- Implement a faster `/api/v1/scoreboard` endpoint in Teams Mode\n- Add the `solves` item to both `/api/v1/challenges` and `/api/v1/challenges/[challenge_id]` to more easily determine how many solves a challenge has\n- Add the `solved_by_me` item to both `/api/v1/challenges` and `/api/v1/challenges/[challenge_id]` to more easily determine if the current account has solved the challenge\n- Prevent admins from deleting themselves through `DELETE /api/v1/users/[user_id]`\n- Add length checking to some sensitive fields in the Pages and Challenges schemas\n- Fix issue where `PATCH /api/v1/users[user_id]` returned a list instead of a dict\n- Fix exception that occured on demoting admins through `PATCH /api/v1/users[user_id]`\n- Add `team_id` to `GET /api/v1/users` to determine if a user is already in a team\n- Provide a more useful error message when using an expired token\n\n**Themes**\n\n- Add a `THEME_FALLBACK` config to help develop themes.\n  - `THEME_FALLBACK` will configure CTFd to try to find missing theme files in the default built-in `core` theme.\n  - This makes it easier to develop themes or use incomplete themes.\n- Allow for one theme to reference and inherit from another theme through approaches like `{% extends \"core/page.html\" %}`\n- Allow for the automatic date rendering format to be overridden by specifying a `data-time-format` attribute.\n- Add styling for the `<blockquote>` element.\n- Change `users/private.html`, `users/public.html` to show awards before a user gets a solve\n- Change `teams/private.html`, `teams/public.html` to show awards before a team gets a solve\n- Change `colorHash` function to use HSL color values to avoid generating too light/dark colors\n- Fix an issue where hidden users couldn't see their graphing data on their private user page (`/user`)\n- Fix scoreboard table identifier to switch between User/Team depending on configured user mode\n- Switch the challenges page in core to use the new API information in `/api/v1/challenges` to mark solves and display solve counts\n- Switch to using Bootstrap's scss in `core/main.scss` to allow using Bootstrap variables\n- Consolidate Jinja error handlers into a single function and better handle issues where error templates can't be found\n\n**Plugins**\n\n- Set plugin migration version after successful migrations\n- Fix issue where Page URLs injected into the navbar were relative instead of absolute\n\n**Admin Panel**\n\n- Add User standings as well as Teams standings to the admin scoreboard when in Teams Mode\n- Add a UI for adding members to a team from the team's admin page\n- Add ability for admins to disable public team creation\n- Link directly to users who submitted something in the submissions page if the CTF is in Teams Mode\n- Fix Challenge Requirements interface in Admin Panel to not allow empty/null requirements to be added\n- Fixed an issue where config times (start, end, freeze times) could not be removed\n- Fix an exception that occurred when demoting an Admin user\n- Adds a temporary hack for re-enabling Javascript snippets in Flag editor templates. (See #1779)\n\n**Deployment**\n\n- Fix boolean configs from the `config.ini` optional section\n- Install `python3-dev` instead of `python-dev` in apt\n- Require `pybluemonday` as pip dependency\n- Remove `lxml` and `html5lib` from pip dependencies\n- Bump `Jinja2` to 2.11.3\n- Bump `pip-tools` to 5.4.0\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\n- Rewrite the HTML santiziation feature (controlled by `HTML_SANITIZATION`) to use the `pybluemonday` library instead of `lxml`/`html5lib`\n  - Note that this feature is still in beta\n- Cache Docker builds more by copying and installing Python dependencies before copying CTFd\n- Change the default emails slightly and rework confirmation email page to make some recommendations clearer\n- Use `examplectf.com` as testing/development domain instead of `ctfd.io`\n- Fix issue where user's name and email would not appear in logs properly\n- Add more linting by also linting with `flake8-comprehensions` and `flake8-bugbear`\n- Add `.pyc` files and `__pycache__` to `.dockerignore`\n\n# 3.2.1 / 2020-12-09\n\n- Fixed an issue where Users could not unlock Hints\n\n# 3.2.0 / 2020-12-07\n\n**General**\n\n- Add Team invites.\n  - Team invites are links containing a token that allow a user to join a team without knowing the team password\n  - Captains can generate invite tokens for their teams\n  - Admins can generate Team invite links as well\n- Improved Team handling\n  - Prevent team joining while already on a team\n  - Return 403 instead of 200 for team join/create errors\n  - Allow team captains whose teams haven't done anything to disband their team\n- Allow for uploading navbar logo, favicon, and index page banner during initial setup\n- Fixed issue in teams mode where a user couldn't unlock a hint despite their team having enough points\n  - The fix for this is essentially to allow the user's points to go negative\n- Imports have been made more stable\n  - This is primarily done by killing MySQL processes that are locking metadta\n  - This is a subpar approach but it seems to be the only solution to avoid a metadata lock in MySQL. This approach did not appear to be needed under Postgres or SQLite\n\n**API**\n\n- Addition of `POST /api/v1/teams/me/members` to generate invite tokens for teams\n- Fixed an issue in `POST /api/v1/awards` where CTFd would 500 when a user could not be found by the provided `user_id`\n- `POST /api/v1/unlocks` in teams mode now uses the team's score to determine if a user can purchase a hint\n  - Properly check for existing unlocks in teams mode in `POST /api/v1/unlocks`\n- `/api/v1/notifications` and `/api/v1/notifications/[notification_id]` now have an html parameter which specifies the rendered content of the notification content\n\n**Themes**\n\n- Add Team Invite icon and Disband Team icon to teams/private.html\n- Add teams/invite.html file to handle team joining with invites\n- Added syntax highlighting to challenge descriptions, pages, hints, notifications, comments, and markdown editors\n  - This is done with `highlight.js` which has been added to `package.json`\n- Fix notifications to properly fix/support Markdown and HTML notifications\n  - Notifications SQL Model now has an html propery\n  - Notifications API schemas now has an html field\n- Removed MomentJS (see https://momentjs.com/docs/#/-project-status/) in favor of dayjs\n  - dayjs is mostly API compatible with MomentJS. The only major changes were:\n    - dayjs always uses browser local time so you don't need to call `.local()`\n    - dayjs segments out some MomentJS functionality into plugins which need to be imported in before using those features\n- Fixed issue in `challenge.html` where the current attempt count would have a typo\n- Fixed issue in `challenge.html` where the max attempts for a challenge would not show if it was set to 1\n- Edit donut charts to have easier to read legends and labels\n- Make data zoom bars thinner and more transparent\n- Add logo, banner, and favicon settings to the setup.html\n\n**Plugins**\n\n- The `auth.register` (`/register`) endpoint now accepts a `?next=` parameter to define where to redirect to after registration\n- There is now a `registered_only` decorator to redirect users to `auth.register` (`/register`) instead of `auth.login` (`/login`)\n- Don't run `db.create_all()` as much during plugin upgrade or during imports\n  - By avoiding this we can let alembic and migrations do more of the table creation work but this means that plugins specifically opt into `app.db.create_all()` and will not implicitly get it through `upgrade()`.\n  - This means plugins that run `upgrade()` without a migrations folder (no idea who would do this really) will need to upgrade their code.\n- The plugin `upgrade()` function now accepts a `lower` parameter which specifies what lower revision should be used to start from.\n  - This is used to support plugin migrations during import so that we can import data directly at the point that the import was taken from\n  - `lower=\"current\"` means to use the current revision and `lower=None` would mean to use the absolute base revision (e.g. plugin's first installation)\n  - By default this doesn't change `upgrade()` behavior\n\n**Admin Panel**\n\n- Add Favicon uploading to the Admin Panel\n- Move Logo uploading to the Theme tab in the Admin Panel\n- The challenge left side bar tabs have been rewritten into VueJS components.\n  - This fixes a number of issues with the consistency of what data is deleted/edited in the challenge editor\n  - This also prevents having to refresh the page in most challenge editing situations\n- Fixed a possible bug where the update available alert wouldn't go away on server restart\n- Examples for regex flags are now provided\n- Wrong submissions has been renamed to Incorrect Submissions\n- Graphs in the Admin Statistics page will now scroll with mouse wheel to improve browsing large datasets\n- Fixed an issue where Users/Teams could be created with a null password\n\n**Deployment**\n\n- A restart policy set to `always` has been added to nginx in docker-compose\n- Rename `requirements.txt` to `requirements.in` and generate `requirements.txt` using `pip-tools` under Python 3.6\n- `UPLOAD_PROVIDER` no longer has a default `filesystem` set in config.ini. Instead it is defaulted through `config.py`\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\n- The `psycopg2` dependency in development.txt has been removed in favor of `psycopg2-binary` which was updated to 2.8.6\n- The `moto` dependency in development.txt has been updated to 1.3.16\n- Add `pip-tools` to `development.txt`\n- Add `import_ctf` and `export_ctf` commands to `manage.py` and deprecate `import.py` and `export.py`\n- Override the `MAIL_SERVER` config with the `TESTING_MAIL_SERVER` envvar during tests\n- `ping` events in the notification event handler have been fixed to not send duplicates\n\n# 3.1.1 / 2020-09-22\n\n**General**\n\n- Fix notification deliverability when there are multiple tabs open\n- Only play notification sounds in the master tab that receives the notification\n\n**Admin Panel**\n\n- Fix issue preventing admins from emailing users through the Admin Panel\n- Improve Notification UI\n  - Clears notification form after notification submission\n  - Add notification to notification list after creation\n\n**Themes**\n\n- Add fix for trying to increment solves when solves are hidden\n- Update JS dependencies to fix a transpiliation error preventing optional custom fields from being left empty\n  - `@babel/core`, `@babel/preset-env`, `@fortawesome/fontawesome-free`, `babel-loader`, and `@babel/polyfill` were updated but only `@babel/core` needs to be updated to resolve the transpiliation issue\n- Remove `console.log` statements from minified production JS\n- Compress notification sound and document the compression command\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\n- Add the ability to override the sender header of email sent via SMTP with the `MAILSENDER_ADDR` config value\n\n# 3.1.0 / 2020-09-08\n\n**General**\n\n- Loosen team password confirmation in team settings to also accept the team captain's password to make it easier to change the team password\n- Adds the ability to add custom user and team fields for registration/profile settings.\n- Improve Notifications pubsub events system to use a subscriber per server instead of a subscriber per browser. This should improve the reliability of CTFd at higher load and make it easier to deploy the Notifications system\n\n**Admin Panel**\n\n- Add a comments functionality for admins to discuss challenges, users, teams, pages\n- Adds a legal section in Configs where users can add a terms of service and privacy policy\n- Add a Custom Fields section in Configs where admins can add/edit custom user/team fields\n- Move user graphs into a modal for Admin Panel\n\n**API**\n\n- Add `/api/v1/comments` to manipulate and create comments\n\n**Themes**\n\n- Make scoreboard caching only cache the score table instead of the entire page. This is done by caching the specific template section. Refer to #1586, specifically the changes in `scoreboard.html`.\n- Add custom field inputs to profile pages (`teams/public.html`, `teams/private.html`, `users/public.html`, `users/private.html`), registration pages (`register.html`), and settings pages (`settings.html`).\n  - This is implemented in the core theme with `form.extra` & `user.fields` with a special helper (`render_extra_fields`) defined in `macros/forms.html`. The best way to implement this is to look at how the core theme handles it and copy the relevant behavior.\n- Add rel=noopener to external links to prevent tab napping attacks\n- Change the registration page to reference links to Terms of Service and Privacy Policy if specified in configuration\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\n- Make team settings modal larger in the core theme\n- Update tests in Github Actions to properly test under MySQL and Postgres\n- Make gevent default in serve.py and add a `--disable-gevent` switch in serve.py\n- Add `tenacity` library for retrying logic\n- Add `pytest-sugar` for slightly prettier pytest output\n- Add a `listen()` method to `CTFd.utils.events.EventManager` and `CTFd.utils.events.RedisEventManager`.\n  - This method should implement subscription for a CTFd worker to whatever underlying notification system there is. This should be implemented with gevent or a background thread.\n  - The `subscribe()` method (which used to implement the functionality of the new `listen()` function) now only handles passing notifications from CTFd to the browser. This should also be implemented with gevent or a background thread.\n\n# 3.0.2 / 2020-08-23\n\n**Admin Panel**\n\n- Fix submission searching in Admin Panel\n- Fix update banner being hidden behind navbar\n\n**Plugins**\n\n- Change default `input` & `submit` blocks in `challenge.html` to use the default values specified in the original challenge type plugins\n\n# 3.0.1 / 2020-08-12\n\n**General**\n\n- Fix issue where admins could not see user graphs/api data if score visibility was set to hidden\n\n**Admin Panel**\n\n- Allow the Admin Panel Submissions page to filter by Account IDs, Challenge IDs, and Challenge Names\n- Link to correct submissions for challenge from the challenge page\n\n**API**\n\n- Fix regression for creating hints via ctfcli. See #1582 for details. https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd/issues/1582.\n- Deprecate `CTFd.api.v1.helpers.models.build_model_filters` and wrap it to `CTFd.utils.helpers.models.build_model_filters`\n\n**Themes**\n\n- Fix team pages to use the correct core errors component\n\n**Plugins**\n\n- Fix issues with previewing challenges under some challenge type plugins\n\n**Deployment**\n\n- Values specified in `config.ini` will now supercede values specified via environment variable. Config behavior is as follows:\n  1. Config Key exists in `config.ini` and is set to a value. That value becomes the app config.\n  2. Config Key exists in `config.ini` but is set to an empty string. An envvar with the same name is looked up. The envvar's value is used as the app config.\n  3. If the envvar is not found, fall back to the default specified value in `config.py`\n  4. If there is no default, use None or an empty string\n\n# 3.0.0 / 2020-07-27\n\n## Changelog Summary\n\nThe CTFd v3 Changelog represents the changes from v2.5.0 to v3. It is a summarized version of the changes that occured in all CTFd v3 beta/alpha releases.\n\nCTFd v3 contains some breaking changes but many plugins remain compatible. Themes will need some minor changes to be compatible with v3.\n\nThese changes are made with great consideration to existing installations and for the health of the overall CTFd project. If you rely on specific behavior, you can always download the last CTFd v2 release on Github. Official plugin/theme updates will be sent to the email addresses on file.\n\nThe major changes in CTFd v3 are as follows with the detailed changelog beneath:\n\n- ### Server Side HTML/Markdown Rendering\n\nHTML rendering in some cases (challenge description rendering, hint content rendering) has been moved to the server side. Previously it was rendered by the browser but this led to a lot of duplicated behavior and complexity in some plugins. Rendering that HTML content on the server allows CTFd to take more advantage of theme content and reduce duplicated code across themes.\n\nIn addition, HTML sanitization can be enabled on the CTFd installation to prevent the injection of malicious scripts in HTML content.\n\n- ### CommonMark\n\nCTFd now uses [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) for HTML/Markdown rendering. This leads to much more consistent rendering of HTML/Markdown content.\n\nIn some cases, this can break your HTML output. You can use our [development testing script](https://gist.github.com/ColdHeat/085c47359ab86c18864135a198cbe505) to check if your HTML output will change and correct it accordingly.\n\n- ### Forms, Nonces, Sessions\n\nCTFd no longer directly injects values into the global session object for a theme. You may have used this as `{{ nonce }}` or `{{ id }}`. Instead these values should be accessed via the `Session` global as so: `{{ Session.nonce }}`.\n\nAll of the public facing forms in CTFd have been converted to form globals with WTForms. You can access them via the `Form` global in Jinja. For example, `{{ Forms.auth.LoginForm() }}`. A `{{ form.nonce() }}` function is available on all forms for easier access to the CSRF nonce as well.\n\nOld forms will still work if the nonce used in the form is updated to `{{ Session.nonce }}`.\n\nValues provided by configuration and plugins can now be accessed via the `Configs` and `Plugins` globals. For example `{{ Configs.ctf_name }}` and `{{ Plugins.scripts }}`. See the `base.html` file of the core theme to get an idea of how to use these values.\n\n- ### Challenge Type Plugin Enhancements\n\nChallenge type plugins now have better re-useability with the rest of CTFd. Plugin code no longer needs to copy unchanged methods over from the base challenge plugin classes.\n\nIn addition, challenge HTML is now rendered on the server side using a new `challenge.html` file provided by the current theme. This means that the theme effectively controls how a challenge should look overall, but the challenge plugin controls the overall content.\n\n- ### Python 3\n\nCTFd v3 is Python 3 only.\n\n- ### Docker image based on Debian\n\nThe Docker image used in CTFd is now based on Debian.\n\n- ### config.ini\n\nInstead of editting `config.py` directly, it's now a better idea to edit `config.ini` or provide your configuration via environment variables\n\n## Detailed Changelog\n\n**General**\n\n- CTFd is now Python 3 only\n- Render markdown with the CommonMark spec provided by `cmarkgfm`\n- HTML/Markdown content is now rendered on the server side in most cases.\n  - This includes challenge descriptions, hint content, and page content\n- Ability to render markdown stripped of any malicious JavaScript or HTML.\n  - Controlled via the `HTML_SANITIZATION` server side configuration value\n- Inject `Config`, `User`, `Team`, `Session`, and `Plugin` globals into Jinja\n- User sessions no longer store any user-specific attributes.\n  - Sessions only store the user's ID, CSRF nonce, and an hmac of the user's password\n  - This allows for session invalidation on password changes\n- The user facing side of CTFd now has user and team searching\n- Accept additional profile fields during registration (affiliation, website, country)\n  - This does not add additional inputs.

In some configurations the column would be exported as a string.\n  - Legacy string columns will still be imported properly.\n- Exports from old 2.x CTFd versions should upgrade and be installed properly\n  - Any failure to do so should be considered a bug\n\n**Deployment**\n\n- User is no longer `root` in Docker image\n  - Errors in writing log files will now fail silently as we expect a future rewrite\n  - Logs will now also go to stdout\n- Update Dockerfile to create and chown/chmod the folders used by `docker-compose` to store files/logs (`/var/log/CTFd`, `/var/uploads`)\n  - This allows the container to write to the folder despite it being a volume mounted from the host\n- Default worker changed back to `gevent`\n- Removed Flask-SocketIO dependency\n  -

This resolves an issue where tables created by plugins would be missing after an import.\n\n# 2.0.4 / 2019-01-30\n\n**General**\n\n- Block user & team name changes if name changes are disabled (Closes #835)\n- Set accounts to unconfirmed if email is changed while `verify_emails` is enabled\n- Only allow users to change their email to emails with domains in the whitelist.\n- Add `email.check_email_is_whitelisted()` to verify that a user's email is whitelisted.\n- Create a `get_config` wrapper around the internal `_get_config` to let us set a default config value (Closes #659)\n- Remove `utils.get_app_config()` from memoization and also give it a `default` parameter\n- Move `utils.logging.init_logs()` into `utils.initialization` and properly call `init_logs()` to save logs to the logs folder\n- Block the creation of users/teams from MLC if registration_visibility is private\n- Fix showing incorrect 'CTF has ended' error if `view_after_ctf` is set.\n- Fix creating users from the admin panel while name changes are disabled.\n\n**API**\n\n- `/api/v1/teams/<team_id>` now coerced to an int (i.e. `/api/v1/teams/<int:team_id>`)\n\n**Deployment**\n\n- Re-add the `LOG_FOLDER` envvar to docker-compose so we don't try to write to the read-only host\n- Stop gunicorn from logging to `LOG_FOLDER` in docker without explicit opt-in\n- Add `ACCESS_LOG` and `ERROR_LOG` envvars to docker to specify where gunicorn will log to\n- Allow `DATABASE_URL` to contain custom MySQL ports for `docker-entrypoint.sh`\n- Drop `WORKERS` count to 1 to avoid dealing with Flask-SocketIO sticky sessions'\n- Install `gevent-websocket` and use it by default until we have a better solution\n- NOTE: In future releases, websockets functionality will likely be removed. (#852)\n\n# 2.0.3 / 2019-01-12\n\n**Security Release**\n\nThis release resolves a security issue that allowed malicious users to hijack admin browser sessions in certain browsers under certain configurations.\n\nThe implemented fix is to require the new `CSRF-Token` header on state-changing requests with a Content-Type of application/json.\nThe same nonce used for standard POST requests is re-used for the `CSRF-Token` header.\n\nBecause of the necessary changes to the API, the previously used call to `fetch()` in themes should now be replaced with `CTFd.fetch()`.\n\n**Security**\n\n- Require `CSRF-Token` header on all API requests.\n- Require CSRF protection on all HTTP methods except `GET`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, and `TRACE`.\n- Default session cookie to `SameSite=Lax`\n- Send initial user information request to MajorLeagueCyber over HTTPS\n\n**General**\n\n- Fix `update_check()` logic so that we don't accidentally remove the update notification.\n\n**Themes**\n\n- Remove explicit usage of `script_root` in public JS.\n  - In custom themes, use the `CTFd.fetch()` function (defined in `CTFd.js`) and properly register the url root and CSRF nonce in `base.html` as shown below:\n  ```javascript\n  var script_root = \"{{ request.script_root }}\";\n  var csrf_nonce = \"{{ nonce }}\";\n  CTFd.options.urlRoot = script_root;\n  CTFd.options.csrfNonce = csrf_nonce;\n  ```\n- Reduce required amount of parameters required for static theme files.\n  - i.e. `url_for('views.themes')` no longer requires the themes parameter. It now defaults to the currently in-use theme.\n\n# 2.0.2 / 2019-01-03\n\n**General**\n\n- Fix regression where public challenges could not be attempted by unauthed users.\n- Admin Config Panel UI no longer allows changing of user mode.\n- Show notification titles and allow for deleting notifications\n  - Update notification UI in admin panel to be similar to the public-facing UI\n- Fix subdirectory deployments in a generic manner by modifying `request.path` to combine both `request.script_root` and `request.path`.\n  - Also create a request preprocessor to redirect users into the true CTFd app when deploying on a subdirectory.\n  - Redirect to `request.full_path` instead of just `request.path`.\n- Fix `TestingConfig.SAFE_MODE` not being reset between tests.\n- Disable `value` input in dynamic challenge update field since we calculate it on the user's behalf.\n- Fix displaying incorrect account link in the solves tab of a challenge modal.\n- Pin `normality` version because of an upstream issue in `dataset`.\n- Fix `500`'s when users submit non-integer values to `?page=1`\n\n**API**\n\n- Add `/api/v1/notifications/<id>` to allow accessing notifactions by ID.\n  - This is currently public but will become permission based later in the future\n- Add `account_url` field to the response of `/api/v1/<challenge_id>/solves` so the client knows where an account is located.\n\n**Plugins**\n\n- Add new plugin utilities to register javascript and css files for the admin panel.\n  - Also fixed issue where those scripts and files were shared between generated applications\n\n# 2.0.1 / 2018-12-09\n\n2.0.1 is a patch release to fix regressions and bugs in 2.0.0.\n\nIf you are upgrading from a version prior to 2.0.0 please read the 2.0.0 change notes for instructions on updating to\n2.0.0 before updating to 2.0.1.\n\n**General**\n\n- Fix setting auth for `get_smtp()`.\n  - Add `MAIL_USEAUTH` to `config.py`.\n- Add more mail documentation to `config.py`.\n- Disable jinja cache properly by setting `cache_size` to 0 (#662)\n  Regression from 1.2.0.\n- Fix downloading files as an anonymous user.\n- Fix viewing challenges anonymously if they have empty requirements.

If you're having trouble updating your plugins\nplease join [the CTFd Slack](https://slack.ctfd.io/) for help and discussion.\n\nIf you are upgrading from a prior version be sure to make backups and have a reversion plan before upgrading.\n\n- If upgrading from 1.2.0 please make use of the `migrations/1_2_0_upgrade_2_0_0.py` script as follows:\n  1. Make all necessary backups. Backup the database, uploads folder, and source code directory.\n  2. Upgrade the source code directory (i.e. `git pull`) but do not run any updated code yet.\n  3. Set the `DATABASE_URL` in `CTFd/config.py` to point to your existing CTFd database.\n  4. Run the upgrade script from the CTFd root folder i.e. `python migrations/1_2_0_upgrade_2_0_0.py`.\n     - This migration script will attempt to migrate data inside the database to 2.0.0 but it cannot account for every situation.\n     - Examples of situations where you may need to manually migrate data:\n       - Tables/columns created by plugins\n       - Tables/columns created by forks\n       - Using databases which are not officially supported (e.g. sqlite, postgres)\n  5.

It comes with everything you need to run a CTF and it's easy to customize with plugins and themes.\n\n![CTFd is a CTF in a can.](https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd/blob/master/CTFd/themes/core/static/img/scoreboard.png?raw=true)\n\n## Features\n\n- Create your own challenges, categories, hints, and flags from the Admin Interface\n  - Dynamic Scoring Challenges\n  - Unlockable challenge support\n  - Challenge plugin architecture to create your own custom challenges\n  - Static & Regex based flags\n    - Custom flag plugins\n  - Unlockable hints\n  - File uploads to the server or an Amazon S3-compatible backend\n  - Limit challenge attempts & hide challenges\n  - Automatic bruteforce protection\n- Individual and Team based competitions\n  - Have users play on their own or form teams to play together\n- Scoreboard with automatic tie resolution\n  - Hide Scores from the public\n  - Freeze Scores at a specific time\n- Scoregraphs comparing the top 10 teams and team progress graphs\n- Markdown content management system\n- SMTP + Mailgun email support\n  - Email confirmation support\n  - Forgot password support\n- Automatic competition starting and ending\n- Team management, hiding, and banning\n- Customize everything using the [plugin](https://docs.ctfd.io/docs/plugins/overview) and [theme](https://docs.ctfd.io/docs/themes/overview) interfaces\n- Importing and Exporting of CTF data for archival\n- And a lot more...\n\n## Install\n\n1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n   1. You can also use the `prepare.sh` script to install system dependencies using apt.\n2. Modify [CTFd/config.ini](https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd/blob/master/CTFd/config.ini) to your liking.\n3. Use `python serve.py` or `flask run` in a terminal to drop into debug mode.\n\nYou can use the auto-generated Docker images with the following command:\n\n`docker run -p 8000:8000 -it ctfd/ctfd`\n\nOr you can use Docker Compose with the following command from the source repository:\n\n`docker compose up`\n\nCheck out the [CTFd docs](https://docs.ctfd.io/) for [deployment options](https://docs.ctfd.io/docs/deployment/installation) and the [Getting Started](https://docs.ctfd.io/tutorials/getting-started/) guide\n\n## Live Demo\n\nhttps://demo.ctfd.io/\n\n## Support\n\nTo get basic support, you can join the [MajorLeagueCyber Community](https://community.majorleaguecyber.org/): [![MajorLeagueCyber Discourse](https://img.shields.io/discourse/status?server=https%3A%2F%2Fcommunity.majorleaguecyber.org%2F)](https://community.majorleaguecyber.org/)\n\nIf you prefer commercial support or have a special project, feel free to [contact us](https://ctfd.io/contact/).\n\n## Managed Hosting\n\nLooking to use CTFd but don't want to deal with managing infrastructure? Check out [the CTFd website](https://ctfd.io/) for managed CTFd deployments.\n\n## MajorLeagueCyber\n\nCTFd is heavily integrated with [MajorLeagueCyber](https://majorleaguecyber.org/). MajorLeagueCyber (MLC) is a CTF stats tracker that provides event scheduling, team tracking, and single sign on for events.\n\nBy registering your CTF event with MajorLeagueCyber users can automatically login, track their individual and team scores, submit writeups, and get notifications of important events.\n\nTo integrate with MajorLeagueCyber, simply register an account, create an event, and install the client ID and client secret in the relevant portion in `CTFd/config.py` or in the admin panel:\n\n```python\nOAUTH_CLIENT_ID = None\nOAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET = None\n```\n\n## Credits\n\n- Logo by [Laura Barbera](http://www.laurabb.com/)\n- Theme by [Christopher Thompson](https://github.com/breadchris)\n- Notification Sound by [Terrence Martin](https://soundcloud.com/tj-martin-composer)\n"
