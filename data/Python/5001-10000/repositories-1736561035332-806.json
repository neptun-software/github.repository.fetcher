However, event producers tend to describe events\ndifferently.\n\nThe lack of a common way of describing events means developers must constantly\nre-learn how to consume events. This also limits the potential for libraries,\ntooling and infrastructure to aide the delivery of event data across\nenvironments, like SDKs, event routers or tracing systems. The portability and\nproductivity we can achieve from event data is hindered overall.\n\nCloudEvents is a specification for describing event data in common formats to\nprovide interoperability across services, platforms and systems.\n\nCloudEvents has received a large amount of industry interest, ranging from major\ncloud providers to popular SaaS companies.

See \"Integrations\".\n- [Contributors](docs/contributors.md): people and organizations who helped\n  us get started or are actively working on the CloudEvents specification.\n- [Presentations, notes and other misc shared\n  docs](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eKH-tVNV25jwkuBEoi3ESqvVjNRlJqYX?usp=sharing)\n- [Demos & open source](docs/README.md) -- if you have something to share\n  about your use of CloudEvents, please submit a PR!\n- [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md)\n\n### Security Concerns\n\nIf there is a security concern with one of the CloudEvents specifications, or\nwith one of the project's SDKs, please send an email to\n[cncf-cloudevents-security@lists.cncf.io](mailto:cncf-cloudevents-security@lists.cncf.io).\n\nA security assessment was performed by\n[Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com/) in October 2022. The report\ncan be found [here](docs/CE-SecurityAudit-2022-10.pdf) or on the Trail of Bits\n[website](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/CloudEvents.pdf).\n\n### Communications\n\nThe main mailing list for e-mail communications:\n\n- Send emails to: [cncf-cloudevents](mailto:cncf-cloudevents@lists.cncf.io)\n- To subscribe see: https://lists.cncf.io/g/cncf-cloudevents\n- Archives are at: https://lists.cncf.io/g/cncf-cloudevents/topics\n\nAnd a #cloudevents Slack channel under\n[CNCF's Slack workspace](http://slack.cncf.io/).\n\nFor SDK related comments and questions:\n\n- Email to: [cncf-cloudevents-sdk](mailto:cncf-cloudevents-sdk@lists.cncf.io)\n- To subscribe see: https://lists.cncf.io/g/cncf-cloudevents-sdk\n- Archives are at: https://lists.cncf.io/g/cncf-cloudevents-sdk/topics\n- Slack: #cloudeventssdk on [CNCF's Slack workspace](http://slack.cncf.io/)\n\nFor SDK specific communications, please see the main README in each\nSDK's github repo - see the [list of SDKs](#sdks).\n\n### Meeting Time\n\nSee the [CNCF public events calendar](https://www.cncf.io/community/calendar/).\nThis specification is being developed by the\n[CNCF Serverless Working Group](https://github.com/cncf/wg-serverless). This\nworking group meets every Thursday at 9AM PT (USA Pacific)\n([World Time Zone Converter](http://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/?t=9:00%20am&tz=San%20Francisco&)):\n\nPlease see the\n[meeting minutes doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OVF68rpuPK5shIHILK9JOqlZBbfe91RNzQ7u_P7YCDE/edit#)\nfor the latest information on how to join the calls.\n\nRecording from our calls are available \n[here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLO-qzjSpLN1BEyKjOVX_nMg7ziHXUYwec), and\nolder ones are\n[here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj6h78yzYM2Ph7YoBIgsZNW_RGJvNlFOt).\n\nPeriodically, the group may have in-person meetings that coincide with a major\nconference.
