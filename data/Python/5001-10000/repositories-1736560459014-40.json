Code\ncontributions are not the only way to help the community. Answering questions, helping\nothers, and improving the documentation are also immensely valuable.\n\nIt also helps us if you spread the word! Reference the library in blog posts\nabout the awesome projects it made possible, shout out on Twitter every time it has\nhelped you, or simply ⭐️ the repository to say thank you.\n\nHowever you choose to contribute, please be mindful and respect our\n[code of conduct](https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n**This guide was heavily inspired by the awesome [scikit-learn guide to contributing](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).**\n\n## Ways to contribute\n\nThere are several ways you can contribute to text-generation-inference.\n\n* Fix outstanding issues with the existing code.\n* Submit issues related to bugs or desired new features.\n* Contribute to the examples or to the documentation.\n\n> All contributions are equally valuable to the community. 🥰\n\n## Fixing outstanding issues\n\nIf you notice an issue with the existing code and have a fix in mind, feel free to [start contributing](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) and open\na Pull Request!\n\n## Submitting a bug-related issue or feature request\n\nDo your best to follow these guidelines when submitting a bug-related issue or a feature\nrequest. It will make it easier for us to come back to you quickly and with good\nfeedback.\n\n### Did you find a bug?\n\nThe text-generation-inference library is robust and reliable thanks to users who report the problems they encounter.\n\nBefore you report an issue, we would really appreciate it if you could **make sure the bug was not\nalready reported** (use the search bar on GitHub under Issues). Your issue should also be related to bugs in the\nlibrary itself, and not your code.\n\nOnce you've confirmed the bug hasn't already been reported, please include the following information in your issue so\nwe can quickly resolve it:\n\n* Your **OS type and version**, as well as your environment versions (versions of rust, python, and dependencies).\n* A short, self-contained, code snippet that allows us to reproduce the bug.\n* The *full* traceback if an exception is raised.\n* Attach any other additional information, like screenshots, you think may help.\n\nTo get the OS and software versions automatically, you can re-run the launcher with the `--env` flag:\n\n```bash\ntext-generation-launcher --env\n```\n\nThis will precede the launch of the model with the information relative to your environment. We recommend pasting\nthat in your issue report.\n\n### Do you want a new feature?\n\nIf there is a new feature you'd like to see in text-generation-inference, please open an issue and describe:\n\n1. What is the *motivation* behind this feature? Is it related to a problem or frustration with the library? Is it\n   a feature related to something you need for a project? Is it something you worked on and think it could benefit\n   the community?\n\n   Whatever it is, we'd love to hear about it!\n\n2. Describe your requested feature in as much detail as possible. The more you can tell us about it, the better\n   we'll be able to help you.\n3. Provide a *code snippet* that demonstrates the feature's usage.\n4. If the feature is related to a paper, please include a link.\n\nIf your issue is well written we're already 80% of the way there by the time you create it.\n\nWe have added [templates](https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference/tree/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE)\nto help you get started with your issue.\n\n## Do you want to implement a new model?\n\nNew models are constantly released and if you want to implement a new model, please provide the following information:\n\n* A short description of the model and a link to the paper.\n* Link to the implementation if it is open-sourced.\n* Link to the model weights if they are available.\n\nIf you are willing to contribute the model yourself, let us know so we can help you add it to text-generation-inference!\n\n## Do you want to add documentation?\n\nWe're always looking for improvements to the documentation that make it more clear and accurate. Please let us know\nhow the documentation can be improved such as typos and any content that is missing, unclear or inaccurate. We'll be\nhappy to make the changes or help you make a contribution if you're interested!\n\n## I want to become a maintainer of the project. How do I get there?\n\nTGI is a project led and managed by Hugging Face as it powers our internal services. However, we are happy to have\nmotivated individuals from other organizations join us as maintainers with the goal of making TGI the best inference\nservice.\n\nIf you are such an individual (or organization), please reach out to us and let's collaborate.\n"

TGI enables high-performance text generation for the most popular open-source LLMs, including Llama, Falcon, StarCoder, BLOOM, GPT-NeoX, and [more](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/supported_models). TGI implements many features, such as:\n\n- Simple launcher to serve most popular LLMs\n- Production ready (distributed tracing with Open Telemetry, Prometheus metrics)\n- Tensor Parallelism for faster inference on multiple GPUs\n- Token streaming using Server-Sent Events (SSE)\n- Continuous batching of incoming requests for increased total throughput\n- [Messages API](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/en/messages_api) compatible with Open AI Chat Completion API\n- Optimized transformers code for inference using [Flash Attention](https://github.com/HazyResearch/flash-attention) and [Paged Attention](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) on the most popular architectures\n- Quantization with :\n  - [bitsandbytes](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes)\n  - [GPT-Q](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17323)\n  - [EETQ](https://github.com/NetEase-FuXi/EETQ)\n  - [AWQ](https://github.com/casper-hansen/AutoAWQ)\n  - [Marlin](https://github.com/IST-DASLab/marlin)\n  - [fp8](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-arm-and-intel-publish-fp8-specification-for-standardization-as-an-interchange-format-for-ai/)\n- [Safetensors](https://github.com/huggingface/safetensors) weight loading\n- Watermarking with [A Watermark for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10226)\n- Logits warper (temperature scaling, top-p, top-k, repetition penalty, more details see [transformers.LogitsProcessor](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/internal/generation_utils#transformers.LogitsProcessor))\n- Stop sequences\n- Log probabilities\n- [Speculation](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/conceptual/speculation) ~2x latency\n- [Guidance/JSON](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/conceptual/guidance). Specify output format to speed up inference and make sure the output is valid according to some specs..\n- Custom Prompt Generation: Easily generate text by providing custom prompts to guide the model's output\n- Fine-tuning Support: Utilize fine-tuned models for specific tasks to achieve higher accuracy and performance\n\n### Hardware support\n\n- [Nvidia](https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference/pkgs/container/text-generation-inference)\n- [AMD](https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference/pkgs/container/text-generation-inference) (-rocm)\n- [Inferentia](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-neuron/tree/main/text-generation-inference)\n- [Intel GPU](https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference/pull/1475)\n- [Gaudi](https://github.com/huggingface/tgi-gaudi)\n- [Google TPU](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum-tpu/howto/serving)\n\n\n## Get Started\n\n### Docker\n\nFor a detailed starting guide, please see the [Quick Tour](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/quicktour). The easiest way of getting started is using the official Docker container:\n\n```shell\nmodel=HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta\n# share a volume with the Docker container to avoid downloading weights every run\nvolume=$PWD/data\n\ndocker run --gpus all --shm-size 1g -p 8080:80 -v $volume:/data \\\n3.0.0   ghcr.io/huggingface/text-generation-inference:3.0.0 --model-id $model\n```\n\nAnd then you can make requests like\n\n```bash\ncurl 127.0.0.1:8080/generate_stream \\\n    -X POST \\\n    -d '{\"inputs\":\"What is Deep Learning?\",\"parameters\":{\"max_new_tokens\":20}}' \\\n    -H 'Content-Type: application/json'\n```\n\nYou can also use [TGI's Messages API](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/en/messages_api) to obtain Open AI Chat Completion API compatible responses.\n\n```bash\ncurl localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions \\\n    -X POST \\\n    -d '{\n  \"model\": \"tgi\",\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\n      \"role\": \"system\",\n      \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"What is deep learning?\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"stream\": true,\n  \"max_tokens\": 20\n}' \\\n    -H 'Content-Type: application/json'\n```\n\n**Note:** To use NVIDIA GPUs, you need to install the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html). We also recommend using NVIDIA drivers with CUDA version 12.2 or higher. For running the Docker container on a machine with no GPUs or CUDA support, it is enough to remove the `--gpus all` flag and add `--disable-custom-kernels`, please note CPU is not the intended platform for this project, so performance might be subpar.\n\n**Note:** TGI supports AMD Instinct MI210 and MI250 GPUs. Details can be found in the [Supported Hardware documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/installation_amd#using-tgi-with-amd-gpus). To use AMD GPUs, please use `docker run --device /dev/kfd --device /dev/dri --shm-size 1g -p 8080:80 -v $volume:/data ghcr.io/huggingface/text-generation-inference:3.0.0-rocm --model-id $model` instead of the command above.\n\nTo see all options to serve your models (in the [code](https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference/blob/main/launcher/src/main.rs) or in the cli):\n```\ntext-generation-launcher --help\n```\n\n### API documentation\n\nYou can consult the OpenAPI documentation of the `text-generation-inference` REST API using the `/docs` route.\nThe Swagger UI is also available at: [https://huggingface.github.io/text-generation-inference](https://huggingface.github.io/text-generation-inference).\n\n### Using a private or gated model\n\nYou have the option to utilize the `HF_TOKEN` environment variable for configuring the token employed by\n`text-generation-inference`. This allows you to gain access to protected resources.\n\nFor example, if you want to serve the gated Llama V2 model variants:\n\n1. Go to https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens\n2. Copy your CLI READ token\n3. Export `HF_TOKEN=<your CLI READ token>`\n\nor with Docker:\n\n```shell\nmodel=meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct\nvolume=$PWD/data # share a volume with the Docker container to avoid downloading weights every run\ntoken=<your cli READ token>\n\ndocker run --gpus all --shm-size 1g -e HF_TOKEN=$token -p 8080:80 -v $volume:/data ghcr.io/huggingface/text-generation-inference:3.0.0 --model-id $model\n```\n\n### A note on Shared Memory (shm)\n\n[`NCCL`](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/nccl/user-guide/docs/index.html) is a communication framework used by\n`PyTorch` to do distributed training/inference. `text-generation-inference` makes\nuse of `NCCL` to enable Tensor Parallelism to dramatically speed up inference for large language models.\n\nIn order to share data between the different devices of a `NCCL` group, `NCCL` might fall back to using the host memory if\npeer-to-peer using NVLink or PCI is not possible.\n\nTo allow the container to use 1G of Shared Memory and support SHM sharing, we add `--shm-size 1g` on the above command.\n\nIf you are running `text-generation-inference` inside `Kubernetes`. You can also add Shared Memory to the container by\ncreating a volume with:\n\n```yaml\n- name: shm\n  emptyDir:\n   medium: Memory\n   sizeLimit: 1Gi\n```\n\nand mounting it to `/dev/shm`.\n\nFinally, you can also disable SHM sharing by using the `NCCL_SHM_DISABLE=1` environment variable. However, note that\nthis will impact performance.\n\n### Distributed Tracing\n\n`text-generation-inference` is instrumented with distributed tracing using OpenTelemetry. You can use this feature\nby setting the address to an OTLP collector with the `--otlp-endpoint` argument. The default service name can be\noverridden with the `--otlp-service-name` argument\n\n### Architecture\n\n![TGI architecture](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/TGI.png)\n\nDetailed blogpost by Adyen on TGI inner workings: [LLM inference at scale with TGI (Martin Iglesias Goyanes - Adyen, 2024)](https://www.adyen.com/knowledge-hub/llm-inference-at-scale-with-tgi)\n\n### Local install\n\nYou can also opt to install `text-generation-inference` locally.\n\nFirst clone the repository and change directory into it:\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference\ncd text-generation-inference\n```\n\nThen [install Rust](https://rustup.rs/) and create a Python virtual environment with at least\nPython 3.9, e.g. using `conda` or `python venv`:\n\n```shell\ncurl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh\n\n#using conda\nconda create -n text-generation-inference python=3.11\nconda activate text-generation-inference\n\n#using python venv\npython3 -m venv .venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate\n```\n\nYou may also need to install Protoc.\n\nOn Linux:\n\n```shell\nPROTOC_ZIP=protoc-21.12-linux-x86_64.zip\ncurl -OL https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v21.12/$PROTOC_ZIP\nsudo unzip -o $PROTOC_ZIP -d /usr/local bin/protoc\nsudo unzip -o $PROTOC_ZIP -d /usr/local 'include/*'\nrm -f $PROTOC_ZIP\n```\n\nOn MacOS, using Homebrew:\n\n```shell\nbrew install protobuf\n```\n\nThen run:\n\n```shell\nBUILD_EXTENSIONS=True make install # Install repository and HF/transformer fork with CUDA kernels\ntext-generation-launcher --model-id mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2\n```\n\n**Note:** on some machines, you may also need the OpenSSL libraries and gcc. On Linux machines, run:\n\n```shell\nsudo apt-get install libssl-dev gcc -y\n```\n\n### Local install (Nix)\n\nAnother option is to install `text-generation-inference` locally using [Nix](https://nixos.org). Currently,\nwe only support Nix on x86_64 Linux with CUDA GPUs. When using Nix, all dependencies can\nbe pulled from a binary cache, removing the need to build them locally.\n\nFirst follow the instructions to [install Cachix and enable the TGI cache](https://app.cachix.org/cache/text-generation-inference).\nSetting up the cache is important, otherwise Nix will build many of the dependencies\nlocally, which can take hours.\n\nAfter that you can run TGI with `nix run`:\n\n```shell\nnix run . -- --model-id meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct\n```\n\n**Note:** when you are using Nix on a non-NixOS system, you have to [make some symlinks](https://danieldk.eu/Nix-CUDA-on-non-NixOS-systems#make-runopengl-driverlib-and-symlink-the-driver-library)\nto make the CUDA driver libraries visible to Nix packages.\n\nFor TGI development, you can use the `impure` dev shell:\n\n```shell\nnix develop .#impure\n\n# Only needed the first time the devshell is started or after updating the protobuf.\n(\ncd server\nmkdir text_generation_server/pb || true\npython -m grpc_tools.protoc -I../proto/v3 --python_out=text_generation_server/pb \\\n       --grpc_python_out=text_generation_server/pb --mypy_out=text_generation_server/pb ../proto/v3/generate.proto\nfind text_generation_server/pb/ -type f -name \"*.py\" -print0 -exec sed -i -e 's/^\\(import.*pb2\\)/from . \\1/g' {} \\;\ntouch text_generation_server/pb/__init__.py\n)\n```\n\nAll development dependencies (cargo, Python, Torch), etc. are available in this\ndev shell.\n\n## Optimized architectures\n\nTGI works out of the box to serve optimized models for all modern models. They can be found in [this list](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/supported_models).\n\nOther architectures are supported on a best-effort basis using:\n\n`AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(<model>, device_map=\"auto\")`\n\nor\n\n`AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(<model>, device_map=\"auto\")`\n\n\n\n## Run locally\n\n### Run\n\n```shell\ntext-generation-launcher --model-id mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2\n```\n\n### Quantization\n\nYou can also run pre-quantized weights (AWQ, GPTQ, Marlin) or on-the-fly quantize weights with bitsandbytes, EETQ, fp8, to reduce the VRAM requirement:\n\n```shell\ntext-generation-launcher --model-id mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 --quantize\n```\n\n4bit quantization is available using the [NF4 and FP4 data types from bitsandbytes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14314.pdf). It can be enabled by providing `--quantize bitsandbytes-nf4` or `--quantize bitsandbytes-fp4` as a command line argument to `text-generation-launcher`.\n\nRead more about quantization in the [Quantization documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/en/conceptual/quantization).\n\n## Develop\n\n```shell\nmake server-dev\nmake router-dev\n```\n\n## Testing\n\n```shell\n# python\nmake python-server-tests\nmake python-client-tests\n# or both server and client tests\nmake python-tests\n# rust cargo tests\nmake rust-tests\n# integration tests\nmake integration-tests\n```\n"
