This page details a few notes, \nworkflows and suggestions for how to make contributions most effective and help us all build a better MicroK8s for everyone - please give them a read before\nworking on any contributions.\n\n## Licensing\n\nMicroK8s has been created under the [Apache License 2.0](./LICENSE), which will cover any contributions you may make to this project. Please familiarise\nyourself with the terms of the license.\n\nAdditionally, MicroK8s uses the Harmony CLA agreement.  It’s the easiest way for you to give us permission to use your contributions. \nIn effect, you’re giving us a licence, but you still own the copyright — so you retain the right to modify your code and use it in\nother projects. Please [sign the CLA here](https://ubuntu.com/legal/contributors/agreement) before making any contributions.\n\n## Code of conduct\n\nMicroK8s has adopted the Ubuntu code of Conduct. You can read this in full [here](https://ubuntu.com/community/code-of-conduct).\n\n## Contributing code\n\nThe workflow for contributing code is as follows:\n\n1. **Create/choose an issue**: MicroK8s tracks issues at [https://github.com/canonical/microk8s/issues](https://github.com/canonical/microk8s/issues). If you\n   want to work on a new feature, create an issue first! This gives everyone a place to discuss scope and implementation.\n2. **Create a fork of the MicroK8s repo**\n3. **Make a new branch for your contribution**. Write your code there.\n4. For details on how to **build and test MicroK8s**, see the [build instructions](./docs/build.md). Add new tests as needed,\n   and make sure the existing tests continue to pass when your changes are complete.\n5. **Submit a pull request** to get changes from your branch into master. You can add \"#Fixes xxx\" where `xxx` is the issue number to \n   automatically link to the issue you chose or created earlier.\n6. Someone will review your PR and may make suggestions or have comments, so **keep an eye on the PR status** in case there are changes to make\n7. **Please make sure you have submitted your [CLA form](https://ubuntu.com/legal/contributors/agreement) if you are a first time contributor**.\n8. Thanks!\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocs for MicroK8s are published online at [https://microk8s.io/docs](https://microk8s.io/docs). You can make suggestions and edit the pages themselves by joining \nthe Kubernetes discourse at [discuss.kubernetes.io](https://discuss.kubernetes.io/t/introduction-to-microk8s/11243) or follow the link at\nthe bottom of any of the pages published at [https://microk8s.io/docs](https://microk8s.io/docs)\nThere is a documentation page which describes how to write and edit docs, [published as part of the documentation](https://microk8s.io/docs/docs).\n\n"

Perfect for:\n\n- Developer workstations\n- IoT\n- Edge\n- CI/CD\n\n > Canonical might have assembled the easiest way to provision a single node Kubernetes cluster - [Kelsey Hightower](https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower/status/1120834594138406912)\n\n## Why MicroK8s?\n\n- **Small**. Developers want the smallest K8s for laptop and workstation\n  development.  MicroK8s provides a standalone K8s compatible with Azure\n  AKS, Amazon EKS, Google GKE when you run it on Ubuntu.\n\n- **Simple**. Minimize administration and operations with a single-package\n  install that has no moving parts for simplicity and certainty. All\n  dependencies and batteries included.\n\n- **Secure**. Updates are available for all security issues and can be\n  applied immediately or scheduled to suit your maintenance cycle.\n\n- **Current**. MicroK8s tracks upstream and releases beta, RC and final bits\n  the same day as upstream K8s. You can track latest K8s or stick to any\n  release version from 1.10 onwards.\n\n- **Comprehensive**. MicroK8s includes a curated collection of manifests for\n  common K8s capabilities and services:\n\n  - Service Mesh: Istio, Linkerd\n  - Serverless: Knative\n  - Monitoring: Fluentd, Prometheus, Grafana, Metrics\n  - Ingress, DNS, Dashboard, Clustering\n  - Automatic updates to the latest Kubernetes version\n  - GPGPU bindings for AI/ML\n\nDrop us a line at [MicroK8s in the Wild](docs/community.md) if you are\ndoing something fun with MicroK8s!\n\n## Quickstart\n\nInstall MicroK8s with:\n\n```\nsnap install microk8s --classic\n```\n\nMicroK8s includes a `microk8s kubectl` command:\n\n```\nsudo microk8s kubectl get nodes\nsudo microk8s kubectl get services\n```\n\nTo use MicroK8s with your existing kubectl:\n\n```\nsudo microk8s kubectl config view --raw > $HOME/.kube/config\n```\n\n#### User access without sudo\nThe *microk8s* user group is created during the snap installation. Users in that group\nare granted access to `microk8s` commands. To add a user to that group:\n```\nsudo usermod -a -G microk8s <username>\n```\n\n\n#### Kubernetes add-ons\n\nMicroK8s installs a barebones upstream Kubernetes. Additional services like dns and the Kubernetes dashboard can be enabled using the `microk8s enable` command.\n\n```\nsudo microk8s enable dns\nsudo microk8s enable dashboard\n```\n\nUse `microk8s status` to see a list of enabled and available addons. You can find the addon manifests and/or scripts under `${SNAP}/actions/`, with `${SNAP}` pointing by default to `/snap/microk8s/current`.\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe [official docs](https://microk8s.io/docs/) are maintained in the\nKubernetes upstream Discourse.\n\nTake a look at the [build instructions](docs/build.md) if you want to\ncontribute to MicroK8s.\n\n<a href=\"https://snapcraft.io/microk8s\" title=\"Get it from the Snap Store\">\n            <img src=\"https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-white.svg\" alt=\"Get it from the Snap Store\" width=\"200\" />\n          </a>\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/canonical/microk8s/graphs/contributors\">\n  <img src=\"https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=canonical/microk8s\" />\n</a>\n"
