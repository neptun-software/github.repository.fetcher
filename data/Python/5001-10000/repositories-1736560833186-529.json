Original source can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwUzUzpG8aM&t=4s).\n\n## Getting Started\n\n#### SAMURAI Installation \n\nSAM 2 needs to be installed first before use. The code requires `python>=3.10`, as well as `torch>=2.3.1` and `torchvision>=0.18.1`. Please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2?tab=readme-ov-file) to install both PyTorch and TorchVision dependencies. You can install **the SAMURAI version** of SAM 2 on a GPU machine using:\n```\ncd sam2\npip install -e .\npip install -e \".[notebooks]\"\n```\n\nPlease see [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2/blob/main/INSTALL.md) from the original SAM 2 repository for FAQs on potential issues and solutions.\n\nInstall other requirements:\n```\npip install matplotlib==3.7 tikzplotlib jpeg4py opencv-python lmdb pandas scipy loguru\n```\n\n#### SAM 2.1 Checkpoint Download\n\n```\ncd checkpoints && \\\n./download_ckpts.sh && \\\ncd ..\n```\n\n#### Data Preparation\n\nPlease prepare the data in the following format:\n```\ndata/LaSOT\n├── airplane/\n│   ├── airplane-1/\n│   │   ├── full_occlusion.txt\n│   │   ├── groundtruth.txt\n│   │   ├── img\n│   │   ├── nlp.txt\n│   │   └── out_of_view.txt\n│   ├── airplane-2/\n│   ├── airplane-3/\n│   ├── ...\n├── basketball\n├── bear\n├── bicycle\n...\n├── training_set.txt\n└── testing_set.txt\n```\n\n#### Main Inference\n```\npython scripts/main_inference.py \n```\n\n## Demo on Custom Video\n\nTo run the demo with your custom video or frame directory, use the following examples:\n\n**Note:** The `.txt` file contains a single line with the bounding box of the first frame in `x,y,w,h` format while the SAM 2 takes `x1,y1,x2,y2` format as bbox input.\n\n### Input is Video File\n\n```\npython scripts/demo.py --video_path <your_video.mp4> --txt_path <path_to_first_frame_bbox.txt>\n```\n\n### Input is Frame Folder\n```\n# Only JPG images are supported\npython scripts/demo.py --video_path <your_frame_directory> --txt_path <path_to_first_frame_bbox.txt>\n```\n\n## FAQs\n**Question 1:** Does SAMURAI need training? [issue 34](https://github.com/yangchris11/samurai/issues/34)\n\n**Answer 1:** Unlike real-life samurai, the proposed samurai do not require additional training. It is a zero-shot method, we directly use the weights from SAM 2.1 to conduct VOT experiments. The Kalman filter is used to estimate the current and future state (bounding box location and scale in our case) of a moving object based on measurements over time, it is a common approach that had been adopted in the field of tracking for a long time, which does not require any training. Please refer to code for more detail.\n\n**Question 2:** Does SAMURAI support streaming input (e.g. webcam)?\n\n**Answer 2:** Not yet. The existing code doesn't support live/streaming video as we inherit most of the codebase from the amazing SAM 2. Some discussion that you might be interested in: facebookresearch/sam2#90, facebookresearch/sam2#388 (comment).\n\n**Question 3:** How to use SAMURAI in longer video?\n\n**Answer 3:** See the discussion from sam2 https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2/issues/264.\n\n**Question 4:** How do you run the evaluation on the VOT benchmarks?\n\n**Answer 4:** For LaSOT, LaSOT-ext, OTB, NFS please refer to the [issue 74](https://github.com/yangchris11/samurai/issues/74) for more details. For GOT-10k-test and TrackingNet, please refer to the official portal for submission.\n\n## Acknowledgment\n\nSAMURAI is built on top of [SAM 2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2?tab=readme-ov-file) by Meta FAIR.\n\nThe VOT evaluation code is modifed from [VOT Toolkit](https://github.com/votchallenge/toolkit) by Luka Čehovin Zajc.\n\n## Citation\n\nPlease consider citing our paper and the wonderful `SAM 2` if you found our work interesting and useful.\n```\n@article{ravi2024sam2,\n  title={SAM 2: Segment Anything in Images and Videos},\n  author={Ravi, Nikhila and Gabeur, Valentin and Hu, Yuan-Ting and Hu, Ronghang and Ryali, Chaitanya and Ma, Tengyu and Khedr, Haitham and R{\\\"a}dle, Roman and Rolland, Chloe and Gustafson, Laura and Mintun, Eric and Pan, Junting and Alwala, Kalyan Vasudev and Carion, Nicolas and Wu, Chao-Yuan and Girshick, Ross and Doll{\\'a}r, Piotr and Feichtenhofer, Christoph},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2408.00714},\n  url={https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00714},\n  year={2024}\n}\n\n@misc{yang2024samurai,\n  title={SAMURAI: Adapting Segment Anything Model for Zero-Shot Visual Tracking with Motion-Aware Memory}, \n  author={Cheng-Yen Yang and Hsiang-Wei Huang and Wenhao Chai and Zhongyu Jiang and Jenq-Neng Hwang},\n  year={2024},\n  eprint={2411.11922},\n  archivePrefix={arXiv},\n  primaryClass={cs.CV},\n  url={https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11922}, \n}\n```\n"
