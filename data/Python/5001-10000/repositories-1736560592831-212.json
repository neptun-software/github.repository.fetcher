[#1154](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/1154)\n- Retrieve the candidate metadata by parsing the `pyproject.toml` rather than building it. [#1156](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/1156)\n- Update the format converters to support the new `[tool.pdm.build]` table. [#1157](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/1157)\n- Scripts are now available as root command if they don't conflict with any builtin or plugin-contributed command. [#1159](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/1159)\n- Add a `post_use` hook triggered after successfully switching Python version. [#1163](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/1163)\n- Add project configuration `respect-source-order` under `[tool.pdm.resolution]` to respect the source order in the `pyproject.toml` file.

          "content": "# Contributing to PDM\n\nFirst off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! Contributions include but are not restricted to:\n\n- Reporting bugs\n- Contributing to code\n- Writing tests\n- Writing documentation\n\nThe following is a set of guidelines for contributing.\n\n## A recommended flow of contributing to an Open Source project\n\nThis section is for beginners to OSS. If you are an experienced OSS developer, you can skip\nthis section.\n\n1. First, fork this project to your own namespace using the fork button at the top right of the repository page.\n2. Clone the **upstream** repository to local:\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm.git\n   # Or if you prefer SSH clone:\n   git clone git@github.com:pdm-project/pdm.git\n   ```\n3. Add the fork as a new remote:\n   ```bash\n   git remote add fork https://github.com/yourname/pdm.git\n   git fetch fork\n   ```\n   where `fork` is the remote name of the fork repository.\n\n**ProTips:**\n\n1. Don't modify code on the main branch, the main branch should always keep track of origin/main.\n\n   To update main branch to date:\n\n   ```bash\n   git pull origin main\n   # In rare cases that your local main branch diverges from the remote main:\n   git fetch origin && git reset --hard main\n   ```\n\n2. Create a new branch based on the up-to-date main branch for new patches.\n3. Create a Pull Request from that patch branch.\n\n## Local development\n\nWe recommend working in a virtual environment.\nFeel free to create a virtual environment with either the `venv` module or the `virtualenv` tool.\nFor example:\n\n```bash\npython -m venv .venv\n. .venv/bin/activate  # linux\n.venv/Scripts/activate  # windows\n```\n\nMake sure your `pip` is newer than `21.3` to install PDM in develop/editable mode.\n\n```bash\npython -m pip install -U \"pip>=21.3\"\npython -m pip install -e .\n```\n\nMake sure PDM uses the virtual environment you just created:\n\n```bash\npdm config -l python.use_venv true\npdm config -l venv.in_project true\n```\n\nInstall PDM development dependencies:\n\n```bash\npdm install\n```\n\nNow, all dependencies are installed into the Python environment you chose, which will be used for development after this point.\n\n### Run tests\n\n```bash\npdm run test\n```\n\nThe test suite is still simple and needs expansion! Please help write more test cases.\n\n!!! note\n    You can also run your test suite against all supported Python version using `tox` with the `tox-pdm` plugin.\n    You can either run it by yourself with:\n\n    ```shell\n    tox\n    ```\n\n    or from `pdm` with:\n\n    ```shell\n    pdm run tox\n    ```\n\n### Code style\n\nPDM uses `pre-commit` for linting. Install `pre-commit` first, for example with pip or [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx):\n\n```bash\npython -m pip install pre-commit\n```\n\n```bash\npipx install pre-commit\n```\n\nThen initialize `pre-commit`:\n\n```bash\npre-commit install\n```\n\nYou can now lint the code with:\n\n```bash\npdm run lint\n```\n\nPDM uses `black` for code style and `isort` for sorting import statements. If you are not following them,\nthe CI will fail and your Pull Request will not be merged.\n\n### News fragments\n\nWhen you make changes such as fixing a bug or adding a feature, you must add a news fragment describing\nyour change. News fragments are placed in the `news/` directory, and should be named according to this pattern: `<issue_num>.<issue_type>.md` (e.g., `566.bugfix.md`).\n\n#### Issue Types\n\n- `feature`: Features and improvements\n- `bugfix`: Bug fixes\n- `refactor`: Code restructures\n- `doc`: Added or improved documentation\n- `dep`: Changes to dependencies\n- `removal`: Removals or deprecations in the API\n- `misc`: Miscellaneous changes that don't fit any of the other categories\n\nThe contents of the file should be a single sentence in the imperative\nmood that describes your changes. (e.g., `Deduplicate the plugins list.` ) See entries in the [Change Log](/CHANGELOG.md) for more examples.\n\n### Preview the documentation\n\nPDM docs development requires a few additional dependencies. Install them as:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install libffi-dev # Or equivalent with the package manager of your choice\n```\n\nNow, whenever you make some changes to the `docs/` and you want to preview the build result, simply do:\n\n```bash\npdm run doc\n```\n\n## Release\n\nOnce all changes are done and ready to release, you can preview the changelog contents by running:\n\n```bash\npdm run release --dry-run\n```\n\nMake sure the next version and the changelog are as expected in the output.\n\nThen cut a release on the **main** branch:\n\n```bash\npdm run release\n```\n\nGitHub action will create the release and upload the distributions to PyPI.\n\nRead more options about version bumping by `pdm run release --help`.\n"

If you feel you are going well\nwith `Pipenv` or `Poetry` and don't want to introduce another package manager,\njust stick to it. But if you are missing something that is not present in those tools,\nyou can probably find some goodness in `pdm`.\n\n## Highlights of features\n\n- Simple and fast dependency resolver, mainly for large binary distributions.\n- A [PEP 517] build backend.\n- [PEP 621] project metadata.\n- Flexible and powerful plug-in system.\n- Versatile user scripts.\n- Install Pythons using [indygreg's python-build-standalone](https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone).\n- Opt-in centralized installation cache like [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/motivation#saving-disk-space-and-boosting-installation-speed).\n\n[pep 517]: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0517\n[pep 621]: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0621\n[pnpm]: https://pnpm.io/motivation#saving-disk-space-and-boosting-installation-speed\n\n## Comparisons to other alternatives\n\n### [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io)\n\nPipenv is a dependency manager that combines `pip` and `venv`, as the name implies.\nIt can install packages from a non-standard `Pipfile.lock` or `Pipfile`.\nHowever, Pipenv does not handle any packages related to packaging your code,\nso it’s useful only for developing non-installable applications (Django sites, for example).\nIf you’re a library developer, you need `setuptools` anyway.\n\n### [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org)\n\nPoetry manages environments and dependencies in a similar way to Pipenv,\nbut it can also build .whl files with your code, and it can upload wheels and source distributions to PyPI.\nIt has a pretty user interface and users can customize it via a plugin. Poetry uses the `pyproject.toml` standard,\nbut it does not follow the standard specifying how metadata should be represented in a pyproject.toml file ([PEP 621]),\ninstead using a custom `[tool.poetry]` table. This is partly because Poetry came out before PEP 621.\n\n### [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io)\n\nHatch can also manage environments, allowing multiple environments per project. By default it has a central location for all environments but it can be configured to put a project's environment(s) in the project root directory. It can manage packages but without lockfile support. It can also be used to package a project (with PEP 621 compliant pyproject.toml files) and upload it to PyPI.\n\n### This project\n\nPDM can manage virtual environments (venvs) in both project and centralized locations, similar to Pipenv. It reads project metadata from a standardized `pyproject.toml` file and supports lockfiles. Users can add additional functionality through plugins, which can be shared by uploading them as distributions.\n\nUnlike Poetry and Hatch, PDM is not limited to a specific build backend; users have the freedom to choose any build backend they prefer.\n\n## Installation\n\n<a href=\"https://repology.org/project/pdm/versions\">\n    <img src=\"https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/pdm.svg\" alt=\"Packaging status\" align=\"right\">\n</a>\n\nPDM requires python version 3.9 or higher.\n\n### Via Install Script\n\nLike Pip, PDM provides an installation script that will install PDM into an isolated environment.\n\n**For Linux/Mac**\n\n```bash\ncurl -sSL https://pdm-project.org/install-pdm.py | python3 -\n```\n\n**For Windows**\n\n```powershell\npowershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c \"irm https://pdm-project.org/install-pdm.py | py -\"\n```\n\nFor security reasons, you should verify the checksum of `install-pdm.py`.\nIt can be downloaded from [install-pdm.py.sha256](https://pdm-project.org/install-pdm.py.sha256).\n\nThe installer will install PDM into the user site and the location depends on the system:\n\n- `$HOME/.local/bin` for Linux\n- `$HOME/Library/Python/<version>/bin` for MacOS\n- `%APPDATA%\\Python\\Scripts` on Windows\n\nYou can pass additional options to the script to control how PDM is installed:\n\n```\nusage: install-pdm.py [-h] [-v VERSION] [--prerelease] [--remove] [-p PATH] [-d DEP]\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  -v VERSION, --version VERSION | envvar: PDM_VERSION\n                        Specify the version to be installed, or HEAD to install from the main branch\n  --prerelease | envvar: PDM_PRERELEASE    Allow prereleases to be installed\n  --remove | envvar: PDM_REMOVE            Remove the PDM installation\n  -p PATH, --path PATH | envvar: PDM_HOME  Specify the location to install PDM\n  -d DEP, --dep DEP | envvar: PDM_DEPS     Specify additional dependencies, can be given multiple times\n```\n\nYou can either pass the options after the script or set the env var value.\n\n### Alternative Installation Methods\n\nIf you are on macOS and using `homebrew`, install it by:\n\n```bash\nbrew install pdm\n```\n\nIf you are on Windows and using [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/), install it by:\n\n```\nscoop bucket add frostming https://github.com/frostming/scoop-frostming.git\nscoop install pdm\n```\n\nOtherwise, it is recommended to install `pdm` in an isolated environment with `pipx`:\n\n```bash\npipx install pdm\n```\n\nOr you can install it under a user site:\n\n```bash\npip install --user pdm\n```\n\nWith [asdf-vm](https://asdf-vm.com/)\n\n```bash\nasdf plugin add pdm\nasdf install pdm latest\n```\n\n## Quickstart\n\n**Initialize a new PDM project**\n\n```bash\npdm init\n```\n\nAnswer the questions following the guide, and a PDM project with a `pyproject.toml` file will be ready to use.\n\n**Install dependencies**\n\n```bash\npdm add requests flask\n```\n\nYou can add multiple dependencies in the same command. After a while, check the `pdm.lock` file to see what is locked for each package.\n\n## Badges\n\nTell people you are using PDM in your project by including the markdown code in README.md:\n\n```markdown\n[![pdm-managed](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2Fpdm-project%2F.github%2Fbadge.json)](https://pdm-project.org)\n```\n\n[![pdm-managed](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2Fpdm-project%2F.github%2Fbadge.json)](https://pdm-project.org)\n\n## PDM Eco-system\n\n[Awesome PDM](https://github.com/pdm-project/awesome-pdm) is a curated list of awesome PDM plugins and resources.\n\n## Sponsors\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <a href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/pdm-project/sponsors/sponsors.svg\">\n        <img src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/pdm-project/sponsors/sponsors.svg\"/>\n    </a>\n</p>\n\n## Credits\n\nThis project is strongly inspired by [pyflow] and [poetry].\n\n[pyflow]: https://github.com/David-OConnor/pyflow\n[poetry]: https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry\n\n## License\n\nThis project is open sourced under MIT license, see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for more details.\n"

这个项目是啥?\n\nPDM 旨在成为下一代 Python 软件包管理工具。它最初是为个人兴趣而诞生的。如果你觉得 `pipenv` 或者\n`poetry` 用着非常好，并不想引入一个新的包管理器，那么继续使用它们吧；但如果你发现有些东西这些\n工具不支持，那么你很可能可以在 `pdm` 中找到。\n\n## 主要特性\n\n- 一个简单且相对快速的依赖解析器，特别是对于大的二进制包发布。\n- 兼容 [PEP 517] 的构建后端，用于构建发布包(源码格式与 wheel 格式)\n- 灵活且强大的插件系统\n- [PEP 621] 元数据格式\n- 功能强大的用户脚本\n- 支持从 [indygreg's python-build-standalone](https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone) 安装 Python。\n- 像 [pnpm] 一样的中心化安装缓存，节省磁盘空间\n\n[pep 517]: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0517\n[pep 621]: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0621\n[pnpm]: https://pnpm.io/motivation#saving-disk-space-and-boosting-installation-speed\n\n## 与其他包管理器的比较\n\n### [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io)\n\nPipenv 是一个依赖管理器，它结合了 `pip` 和 `venv`，正如其名称所暗示的。它可以从一种自定义格式文件 `Pipfile.lock` 或 `Pipfile` 中安装软件包。\n然而，Pipenv 并不处理任何与构建、打包和发布相关的工作。所以它只适用于开发不可安装的应用程序（例如 Django 网站）。\n如果你是一个库的开发者，无论如何你都需要 `setuptools`。\n\n### [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org)\n\nPoetry 以类似于 Pipenv 的方式管理环境和依赖，它也可以从你的代码构建 `.whl` 文件，并且可以将轮子和源码发行版上传到 PyPI。\n它有一个漂亮的用户界面，用户可以通过贡献插件来定制它。Poetry 使用 `pyproject.toml` 标准。但它并不遵循指定元数据应如何在 `pyproject.toml` 文件中表示的标准（[PEP 621]）。而是使用一个自定义的 `[tool.poetry]` 表。这部分是因为 Poetry 诞生在 PEP 621 出现之前。\n\n### [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io)\n\nHatch 也可以管理环境（它允许每个项目有多个环境，但不允许把它们放在项目目录中），并且可以管理包（但不支持 lockfile）。Hatch 也可以用来打包一个项目（用符合 PEP 621 标准的 `pyproject.toml` 文件）并上传到 PyPI。\n\n### 本项目\n\nPDM 也可以像 Pipenv 那样在项目或集中的位置管理 venvs。它从一个标准化的 `pyproject.toml` 文件中读取项目元数据，并支持 lockfile。用户可以在插件中添加更多的功能，并将其作为一个发行版上传，以供分享。\n\n此外，与 Poetry 和 Hatch 不同，PDM 并没有被和一个特定的构建后端绑定，你可以选择任何你喜欢的构建后端。\n\n## 安装\n\n<a href=\"https://repology.org/project/pdm/versions\">\n    <img src=\"https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/pdm.svg\" alt=\"Packaging status\" align=\"right\">\n</a>\n\nPDM 需要 Python 3.9 或更高版本。\n\n### 通过安装脚本\n\n像 pip 一样，PDM 也提供了一键安装脚本，用来将 PDM 安装在一个隔离的环境中。\n\n**Linux/Mac 安装命令**\n\n```bash\ncurl -sSL https://pdm-project.org/install-pdm.py | python3 -\n```\n\n**Windows 安装命令**\n\n```powershell\npowershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c \"irm https://pdm-project.org/install-pdm.py | py -\"\n```\n\n为安全起见，你应该检查 `install-pdm.py` 文件的正确性。\n校验和文件下载地址：[install-pdm.py.sha256](https://pdm-project.org/install-pdm.py.sha256)\n\n默认情况下，此脚本会将 PDM 安装在 Python 的用户目录下，具体位置取决于当前系统：\n\n- Unix 上是 `$HOME/.local/bin`\n- MacOS 上是 `$HOME/Library/Python/<version>/bin`\n- Windows 上是 `%APPDATA%\\Python\\Scripts`\n\n你还可以通过命令行的选项来改变安装脚本的行为：\n\n```\nusage: install-pdm.py [-h] [-v VERSION] [--prerelease] [--remove] [-p PATH] [-d DEP]\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n  -v VERSION, --version VERSION | envvar: PDM_VERSION\n                        Specify the version to be installed, or HEAD to install from the main branch\n  --prerelease | envvar: PDM_PRERELEASE    Allow prereleases to be installed\n  --remove | envvar: PDM_REMOVE            Remove the PDM installation\n  -p PATH, --path PATH | envvar: PDM_HOME  Specify the location to install PDM\n  -d DEP, --dep DEP | envvar: PDM_DEPS     Specify additional dependencies, can be given multiple times\n```\n\n你既可以通过直接增加选项，也可以通过设置对应的环境变量来达到这一效果。\n\n### 其他安装方法\n\n如果你使用的是 macOS 并且安装了 `homebrew`：\n\n```bash\nbrew install pdm\n```\n\n如果你在 Windows 上使用 [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/), 运行以下命令安装：\n\n```\nscoop bucket add frostming https://github.com/frostming/scoop-frostming.git\nscoop install pdm\n```\n\n否则，强烈推荐把 `pdm` 安装在一个隔离环境中， 用 `pipx` 是最好的。\n\n```bash\npipx install pdm\n```\n\n或者你可以将它安装在用户目录下:\n\n```bash\npip install --user pdm\n```\n\n[asdf-vm](https://asdf-vm.com/)\n\n```bash\nasdf plugin add pdm\nasdf install pdm latest\n```\n\n## 快速上手\n\n**初始化一个新的 PDM 项目**\n\n```bash\npdm init\n```\n\n按照指引回答提示的问题，一个 PDM 项目和对应的`pyproject.toml`文件就创建好了。\n\n**添加依赖**\n\n```bash\npdm add requests flask\n```\n\n你可以在同一条命令中添加多个依赖。稍等片刻完成之后，你可以查看`pdm.lock`文件看看有哪些依赖以及对应版本。\n\n## 徽章\n\n在 README.md 中加入以下 Markdown 代码，向大家展示项目正在使用
