Waddles\n2. Pebbles\n3. Bubbles\n4. Flappy\n5. Chilly\n```\nRead the [usage instructions](https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/usage.html) for more.\n\n## Installing a model that runs on your own machine\n\n[LLM plugins](https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/plugins/index.html) can add support for alternative models, including models that run on your own machine.\n\nTo download and run Mistral 7B Instruct locally, you can install the [llm-gpt4all](https://github.com/simonw/llm-gpt4all) plugin:\n```bash\nllm install llm-gpt4all\n```\nThen run this command to see which models it makes available:\n```bash\nllm models\n```\n```\ngpt4all: all-MiniLM-L6-v2-f16 - SBert, 43.76MB download, needs 1GB RAM\ngpt4all: orca-mini-3b-gguf2-q4_0 - Mini Orca (Small), 1.84GB download, needs 4GB RAM\ngpt4all: mistral-7b-instruct-v0 - Mistral Instruct, 3.83GB download, needs 8GB RAM\n...\n```\nEach model file will be downloaded once the first time you use it. Try Mistral out like this:\n```bash\nllm -m mistral-7b-instruct-v0 'difference between a pelican and a walrus'\n```\nYou can also start a chat session with the model using the `llm chat` command:\n```bash\nllm chat -m mistral-7b-instruct-v0\n```\n```\nChatting with mistral-7b-instruct-v0\nType 'exit' or 'quit' to exit\nType '!multi' to enter multiple lines, then '!end' to finish\n> \n```\n\n## Using a system prompt\n\nYou can use the `-s/--system` option to set a system prompt, providing instructions for processing other input to the tool.\n\nTo describe how the code in a file works, try this:\n\n```bash\ncat mycode.py | llm -s \"Explain this code\"\n```\n\n## Help\n\nFor help, run:\n\n    llm --help\n\nYou can also use:\n\n    python -m llm --help\n"
