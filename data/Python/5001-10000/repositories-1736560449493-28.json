The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4.

A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version.\n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version.

Otherwise it will try all passwords already found as windows passwords. \n```\nlaZagne.exe all -password ZapataVive\n```\n\n__Note: For wifi passwords \\ Windows Secrets, launch it with administrator privileges (UAC Authentication / sudo)__\n\nMac OS\n----\n__Note: In Mac OS System, without the user password it is very difficult to retrieve passwords stored on the computer.__ \nSo, I recommend using one of these options\n\n* If you know the user password, add it in the command line \n```\nlaZagne all --password SuperSecurePassword\n```\n* You could use the interactive mode that will prompt a dialog box to the user until the password will be correct \n```\nlaZagne all -i\n```\n\nSupported software\n----\n\n|  | Windows    | Linux  | Mac |\n| -- | -- | -- | -- |\n| Browsers | 7Star<br> Amigo<br> Basilisk <br> BlackHawk<br> Brave<br> Centbrowser<br> Chedot<br> Chrome Beta<br> Chrome Canary<br> Chromium<br> Coccoc<br> Comodo Dragon<br> Comodo IceDragon<br> Cyberfox<br> DCBrowser <br> Elements Browser<br> Epic Privacy Browser<br> Firefox<br> Google Chrome<br> Icecat<br> K-Meleon<br> Kometa<br> Microsoft Edge<br> Opera<br> Opera GX<br> Orbitum <br> QQBrowser <br> pale Moon <br> SogouExplorer <br> Sputnik<br> Torch<br> Uran<br> Vivaldi<br> | Brave<br> Chromium<br> Dissenter-Browser<br> Firefox<br> Google Chrome<br> IceCat<br> Microsoft Edge<br> Opera<br> SlimJet<br> Vivaldi | Chrome<br> Firefox |\n| Chats | Pidgin<br> Psi<br> Skype| Pidgin<br> Psi |  |\n| Databases | DBVisualizer<br> Postgresql<br> Robomongo<br> Squirrel<br> SQLdevelopper | DBVisualizer<br> Squirrel<br> SQLdevelopper  |  |\n| Games | GalconFusion<br> Kalypsomedia<br> RogueTale<br> Turba |  |  |\n| Git | Git for Windows |  |  |\n| Mails | Epyrus <br> Interlink <br> Outlook<br> Thunderbird  | Clawsmail<br> Thunderbird |  |\n| Maven | Maven Apache<br> |  |  |\n| Dumps from memory | Keepass<br> Mimikatz method | System Password |  |\n| Multimedia | EyeCON<br> |  |  |\n| PHP | Composer<br> |  |  |\n| SVN | Tortoise  | | |\n| Sysadmin | Apache Directory Studio<br> CoreFTP<br> CyberDuck<br> FileZilla<br> FileZilla Server<br> FTPNavigator<br> OpenSSH<br> OpenVPN<br> mRemoteNG <br> KeePass Configuration Files (KeePass1, KeePass2)<br> PuttyCM<br>Rclone<br>RDPManager<br> VNC<br> WinSCP<br> Windows Subsystem for Linux | Apache Directory Studio<br> AWS<br>  Docker<br> Environnement variable<br> FileZilla<br> gFTP<br> History files<br> Shares <br> SSH private keys <br> KeePass Configuration Files (KeePassX, KeePass2) <br> Grub <br> Rclone |  |\n| Wifi | Wireless Network | Network Manager<br> WPA Supplicant |  |\n| Internal mechanism passwords storage | Autologon<br> MSCache<br> Credential Files<br> Credman <br> DPAPI Hash <br> Hashdump (LM/NT)<br> LSA secret<br> Vault Files | GNOME Keyring<br> Kwallet<br> Hashdump | Keychains<br> Hashdump |\n\n\nCompile\n----\n\n* Using Pyinstaller\n```\npyinstaller --additional-hooks-dir=. -F --onefile laZagne.py\n```\n* Using Nuitka\n```\npython3 -m nuitka --standalone --onefile --include-package=lazagne laZagne.py\n```\n\nFor developers\n----\nPlease refer to the wiki before opening an issue to understand how to compile the project or to develop a new module.\nhttps://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne/wiki\n\nDonation\n----\nIf you want to support my work doing a donation, I will appreciate a lot:\n* Via BTC: 16zJ9wTXU4f1qfMLiWvdY3woUHtEBxyriu\n* Via Paypal: https://www.paypal.me/lazagneproject\n\nSpecial thanks\n----\n* Harmjoy for [KeeThief](https://github.com/HarmJ0y/KeeThief/)\n* n1nj4sec for his [mimipy](https://github.com/n1nj4sec/mimipy) module\n* Benjamin DELPY for [mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz), which helps me to understand some Windows API.\n* @skelsec for [Pypykatz](https://github.com/skelsec/pypykatz)\n* Moyix for [Creddump](https://github.com/moyix/creddump)\n* N0fat for [Chainbreaker](https://github.com/n0fate/chainbreaker/)\n* Richard Moore for the [AES module](https://github.com/ricmoo/pyaes)\n* Todd Whiteman for the [DES module](https://github.com/toddw-as/pyDes)\n* mitya57 for [secretstorage](https://github.com/mitya57/secretstorage)\n* All [contributors](https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne/graphs/contributors) who help me on this project\n\n"
