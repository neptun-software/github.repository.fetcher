Read the file `COPYING.LGPLv2.1` for details. Some other\n   files have MIT/X11/BSD-style licenses. In combination the LGPL v2.1+ applies to\n   FFmpeg.\n\n   Some optional parts of FFmpeg are licensed under the GNU General Public License\n   version 2 or later (GPL v2+). See the file `COPYING.GPLv2` for details. None of\n   these parts are used by default, you have to explicitly pass `--enable-gpl` to\n   configure to activate them. In this case, FFmpeg's license changes to GPL v2+.\n\n   Specifically, the GPL parts of FFmpeg are:\n\n   - libpostproc\n   - optional x86 optimization in the files\n       - `libavcodec/x86/flac_dsp_gpl.asm`\n       - `libavcodec/x86/idct_mmx.c`\n       - `libavfilter/x86/vf_removegrain.asm`\n   - the following building and testing tools\n       - `compat/solaris/make_sunver.pl`\n       - `doc/t2h.pm`\n       - `doc/texi2pod.pl`\n       - `libswresample/tests/swresample.c`\n       - `tests/checkasm/*`\n       - `tests/tiny_ssim.c`\n   - the following filters in libavfilter:\n       - `signature_lookup.c`\n       - `vf_blackframe.c`\n       - `vf_boxblur.c`\n       - `vf_colormatrix.c`\n       - `vf_cover_rect.c`\n       - `vf_cropdetect.c`\n       - `vf_delogo.c`\n       - `vf_eq.c`\n       - `vf_find_rect.c`\n       - `vf_fspp.c`\n       - `vf_histeq.c`\n       - `vf_hqdn3d.c`\n       - `vf_kerndeint.c`\n       - `vf_lensfun.c` (GPL version 3 or later)\n       - `vf_mcdeint.c`\n       - `vf_mpdecimate.c`\n       - `vf_nnedi.c`\n       - `vf_owdenoise.c`\n       - `vf_perspective.c`\n       - `vf_phase.c`\n       - `vf_pp.c`\n       - `vf_pp7.c`\n       - `vf_pullup.c`\n       - `vf_repeatfields.c`\n       - `vf_sab.c`\n       - `vf_signature.c`\n       - `vf_smartblur.c`\n       - `vf_spp.c`\n       - `vf_stereo3d.c`\n       - `vf_super2xsai.c`\n       - `vf_tinterlace.c`\n       - `vf_uspp.c`\n       - `vf_vaguedenoiser.c`\n       - `vsrc_mptestsrc.c`\n\n   Should you, for whatever reason, prefer to use version 3 of the (L)GPL, then\n   the configure parameter `--enable-version3` will activate this licensing option\n   for you. Read the file `COPYING.LGPLv3` or, if you have enabled GPL parts,\n   `COPYING.GPLv3` to learn the exact legal terms that apply in this case.\n\n   There are a handful of files under other licensing terms, namely:\n\n   * The files `libavcodec/jfdctfst.c`, `libavcodec/jfdctint_template.c` and\n     `libavcodec/jrevdct.c` are taken from libjpeg, see the top of the files for\n     licensing details. Specifically note that you must credit the IJG in the\n     documentation accompanying your program if you only distribute executables.\n     You must also indicate any changes including additions and deletions to\n     those three files in the documentation.\n   * `tests/reference.pnm` is under the expat license.\n\n\n   ## External libraries\n\n   FFmpeg can be combined with a number of external libraries, which sometimes\n   affect the licensing of binaries resulting from the combination.\n\n   ### Compatible libraries\n\n   The following libraries are under GPL version 2:\n   - avisynth\n   - frei0r\n   - libcdio\n   - libdavs2\n   - librubberband\n   - libvidstab\n   - libx264\n   - libx265\n   - libxavs\n   - libxavs2\n   - libxvid\n\n   When combining them with FFmpeg, FFmpeg needs to be licensed as GPL as well by\n   passing `--enable-gpl` to configure.\n\n   The following libraries are under LGPL version 3:\n   - gmp\n   - libaribb24\n   - liblensfun\n\n   When combining them with FFmpeg, use the configure option `--enable-version3` to\n   upgrade FFmpeg to the LGPL v3.\n\n   The VMAF, mbedTLS, RK MPI, OpenCORE and VisualOn libraries are under the Apache License\n   2.0. That license is incompatible with the LGPL v2.1 and the GPL v2, but not with\n   version 3 of those licenses. So to combine these libraries with FFmpeg, the\n   license version needs to be upgraded by passing `--enable-version3` to configure.\n\n   The smbclient library is under the GPL v3, to combine it with FFmpeg,\n   the options `--enable-gpl` and `--enable-version3` have to be passed to\n   configure to upgrade FFmpeg to the GPL v3.\n\n   ### Incompatible libraries\n\n   There are certain libraries you can combine with FFmpeg whose licenses are not\n   compatible with the GPL and/or the LGPL. If you wish to enable these\n   libraries, even in circumstances that their license may be incompatible, pass\n   `--enable-nonfree` to configure. This will cause the resulting binary to be\n   unredistributable.\n\n   The Fraunhofer FDK AAC and OpenSSL libraries are under licenses which are\n   incompatible with the GPLv2 and v3. To the best of our knowledge, they are\n   compatible with the LGPL.\n\n   ```\n\n## Hydra-core [MIT License](https://github.com/facebookresearch/hydra/blob/main/LICENSE)\n\n   ```\n\n   MIT License\n\n   Copyright (c) Facebook, Inc. and its affiliates.\n\n   Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\n   of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\n   in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\n   to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\n   copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\n   furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\n   The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\n   copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\n   THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\n   IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\n   FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The background is dominated by rows of boxes, \\\nsuggesting a highly organized storage system. The floor is lined with wooden pallets, enhancing the industrial setting. \\\nThe camera remains static, capturing the robot's poised stance amidst the orderly environment, with a shallow depth of \\\nfield that keeps the focus on the robot while subtly blurring the background for a cinematic effect.\"\n\n# Example using 7B model\nPYTHONPATH=$(pwd) python cosmos1/models/diffusion/inference/text2world.py \\\n    --checkpoint_dir checkpoints \\\n    --diffusion_transformer_dir Cosmos-1.0-Diffusion-7B-Text2World \\\n    --prompt \"$PROMPT\" \\\n    --offload_prompt_upsampler \\\n    --video_save_name Cosmos-1.0-Diffusion-7B-Text2World\n```\n\n<video src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db7bebfe-5314-40a6-b045-4f6ce0a87f2a\">\n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\n</video>\n\nWe also offer [multi-GPU inference](cosmos1/models/diffusion/nemo/inference/README.md) support for Diffusion Text2World WFM models through NeMo Framework.\n\n### Post-training\n\nNeMo Framework provides GPU accelerated post-training with general post-training for both [diffusion](cosmos1/models/diffusion/nemo/post_training/README.md) and [autoregressive](cosmos1/models/autoregressive/nemo/post_training/README.md) models, with other types of post-training coming soon.\n\n## License and Contact\n\nThis project will download and install additional third-party open source software projects.
