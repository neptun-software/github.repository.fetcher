          "content": "# Making the documentation\n\nA brief overview of the files in this repo, and the make-targets in the `Makefile`, and how it all hangs together to build the final output html files from the initial adoc input files.\n\n**TL;DR version**: To build the 'regular' documentation site, run `make clean; make`. To build the documentation site with pico-sdk API docs included, run `make clean; make build_doxygen_adoc; make`.\n\n## Files in the repo\n\n* `documentation/asciidoc/` all our \"regular\" asciidoc documentation (referred to as `$(ASCIIDOC_DIR)` in the `Makefile`)\n* `documentation/images/` the images shown on the \"boxes\"\n* `documentation/pico-sdk/` [pico-sdk](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk) submodule (initially empty) (referred to as `$(PICO_SDK_DIR)` in the `Makefile`)\n* `documentation/pico-examples/` [pico-examples](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples) submodule (initially empty) (referred to as `$(PICO_EXAMPLES_DIR)` in the `Makefile`)\n* `jekyll-assets/` various styling stuff used by the jekyll build (referred to as `$(JEKYLL_ASSETS_DIR)` in the `Makefile`)\n* `scripts/` various Python build-scripts (referred to as `$(SCRIPTS_DIR)` in the `Makefile`)\n* `Makefile` top-level Makefile that runs the build\n\n## When you clone the repo and run `make`\n\n1. `.DEFAULT_GOAL := html` is set in the `Makefile`, which means that `make` actually does `make html`.\n    1. The `html` target has the `run_ninja` target as a prerequisite\n        1. The `run_ninja` target has `$(AUTO_NINJABUILD)` (i.e. `build/autogenerated.ninja`) as a prerequisite\n            1. `build/autogenerated.ninja` has `$(BUILD_DIR)` (i.e. `build/`) as a prerequisite\n                1. So the `build/` directory gets created\n            1. Then `build/autogenerated.ninja` gets created\n       1. Then `ninja` gets invoked, which uses `build.ninja` (which includes `build/autogenerated.ninja`) to create a whole bunch of files in the `build/` directory\n    1. Then `jekyll` gets invoked, which uses all the files in the `build/` directory to create all the final output files in the `$(HTML_DIR)` (i.e. `documentation/html/`) directory\n\nIf you run `make` a second time, then `make` and `ninja` will spot that everything is up to date, and only re-run the `jekyll` stage.\n   \n## When you run `make clean`\n \n1. The `clean` target has the `clean_html` and `clean_doxygen_adoc` targets as prerequisites\n    1. In this case `clean_doxygen_adoc` doesn't do anything, but `clean_html` deletes the `documentation/html/` directory\n1. Then the `build/` directory is deleted\n \n## When you run `make build_doxygen_adoc`\n \n1. The `build_doxygen_adoc` target has `$(ASCIIDOC_DOXYGEN_DIR)/index_doxygen.adoc` (i.e. `documentation/asciidoc/pico-sdk/index_doxygen.adoc`) as a prerequisite\n    1. `documentation/asciidoc/pico-sdk/index_doxygen.adoc` has `$(DOXYGEN_HTML_DIR)` (i.e. `build-pico-sdk-docs/docs/doxygen/html/`) and `$(ASCIIDOC_DOXYGEN_DIR)` (i.e. `documentation/asciidoc/pico-sdk/`) as prerequisites\n        1. So the `documentation/asciidoc/pico-sdk/` directory gets created\n        1. `build-pico-sdk-docs/docs/doxygen/html/` has `$(ALL_SUBMODULE_CMAKELISTS)` (i.e. `documentation/pico-sdk/CMakeLists.txt` and `documentation/pico-examples/CMakeLists.txt`) and `$(DOXYGEN_PICO_SDK_BUILD_DIR)` (i.e. `build-pico-sdk-docs/`) as prerequisites\n            1. So the `build-pico-sdk-docs/` directory gets created\n            1. `documentation/pico-sdk/CMakeLists.txt` gets created by initialising the `pico-sdk` submodule\n            1. `documentation/pico-examples/CMakeLists.txt` gets created by initialising the `pico-examples` submodule\n        1. Then `cmake` gets invoked for `pico-sdk/`, which creates `build-pico-sdk-docs/Makefile`\n        1. Then we run the `docs` target in `build-pico-sdk-docs/Makefile` which runs `doxygen` and creates a bunch of HTML files in `build-pico-sdk-docs/docs/doxygen/html/` (referred to as `$(DOXYGEN_HTML_DIR)` in the `Makefile`)\n1. Then we run the new `scripts/transform_doxygen_html.py` to convert the HTML files from `build-pico-sdk-docs/docs/doxygen/html/` into adoc files in `documentation/asciidoc/pico-sdk/`\n\nIf you run `make build_doxygen_adoc` a second time, then `make` will detect that everything is already up to date, and so not do anything.\n \nIf we **now** run `make` (see the `make html` description above), it will now find `documentation/asciidoc/pico-sdk/` and include that in the \"tabs\" in the output html files in `documentation/html/`.\n\nAnd if we then run a `make clean`, the presence of `documentation/asciidoc/pico-sdk/` will cause the `clean_doxygen_adoc` target to delete the files in the `build/` directory (to prevent things getting into an \"invalid state\"), and then delete the `documentation/asciidoc/pico-sdk/` directory.\nNote that `build-pico-sdk-docs/` (the raw Doxygen output) **isn't** deleted by `make clean`, because it's basically \"static content\" which can take a while to regenerate. To _also_ get rid of `build-pico-sdk-docs/` you can either `make clean_doxygen_html` or `make clean_everything` (with the latter also deinitialising the submodules).\n\n## Makefile targets\n\nTargets which might be useful for getting things to / from a particular state.\n\n* `make fetch_submodules` populates (initialises) the `documentation/pico-sdk/` and `documentation/pico-examples/` submodule directories\n* `make clean_submodules` deinitialises the submodule directories, i.e. is the opposite of `fetch_submodules`\n* `make build_doxygen_html` runs the `cmake` and `make` steps required to create the Doxygen HTML files (in `build-pico-sdk-docs/docs/doxygen/html/`) from the `pico-sdk` submodule\n* `make clean_doxygen_html` deletes the `build-pico-sdk-docs/` directory i.e. is the opposite of `build_doxygen_html`\n* `make build_doxygen_adoc` described in an earlier section, converts html files from `build-pico-sdk-docs/docs/doxygen/html/` to adoc files in `documentation/asciidoc/pico-sdk/`\n* `make clean_doxygen_adoc` deletes the `documentation/asciidoc/pico-sdk/` directory i.e. is the opposite of `build_doxygen_adoc`\n* `make run_ninja` converts adoc files from `documentation/asciidoc/` into adoc files in `build/`\n* `make clean_ninja` deletes the files in `build/` i.e. is the opposite of `run_ninja`\n* `make html` described in an earlier section, converts adoc files from `build/` into html files in `documentation/html/`. The default target invoked when no explicit target is given.\n* `make clean_html` deletes the `documentation/html/` directory, i.e. is the opposite of `html`\n* `make serve_html` converts adoc files from `build/` into html files in `documentation/html/` and then runs a mini webserver so that you can preview the output\n* `make clean` runs both of `clean_html` & `clean_doxygen_adoc` and also deletes `build/` \n* `make clean_everything` runs all of `clean_submodules`, `clean_doxygen_html` and `clean` i.e. returns your local directory to a fairly pristine state\n\nNote that for day-to-day usage, you'll typically only use the `make clean`, `make`, `make build_doxygen_adoc` and `make serve_html` commands - the dependencies in the `Makefile` are all set up so that any necessary intermediate steps are performed automatically.\n\nBad ASCII-art time:\n\n```\n+---------------+                               \n| 'clean' state |--> make build_doxygen_adoc\n+---------------+              |\n |    |       ^                V\n |    V       |            +-----------------------------------------+\n |  make    make clean <---| documentation/asciidoc/pico-sdk/ exists |\n |    |       ^            +-----------------------------------------+\n |    |       |                       |        |\n |    |       |                       V        |\n |    V       |                      make      |\n |  +----------------------------+    |        |\n |  | documentation/html/ exists |<---+        |\n |  +----------------------------+             |\n |        |                  ^                 |\n |        V                  |                 |\n +---> make serve_html <-----------------------+\n          |                  |\n          |                Ctrl-C\n          |                  ^\n          V                  |\n+----------------------------------------------------------+\n| documentation/html/ exists and preview webserver running |\n+----------------------------------------------------------+\n```\n\n"

Create a fork of this repository on your GitHub account.\n\n1. Make changes in your fork. Start from the default `develop` branch.\n\n1. Read our [style guide](https://github.com/raspberrypi/style-guide/blob/master/style-guide.md) to ensure that your changes are consistent with the rest of our documentation. Since Raspberry Pi is a British company, be sure to include all of your extra `u`s and transfigure those `z`s (pronounced 'zeds') into `s`s!\n\n1. [Open a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) against this repository.\n\n1. The maintainers will assess and copy-edit the PR. This can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few days, depending on the size of your PR, the time of year, and the availability of the maintainers.\n\n1. After making any requested improvements to your PR, the maintainers will accept the PR and merge your changes into `develop`.\n\n1. When the maintainers next release the documentation by merging `develop` into `master`, your changes will go public on the production documentation site.\n\nAlternatively, [open an issue](https://github.com/raspberrypi/documentation/issues) to discuss proposed changes.\n\n## Build\n\n### Install dependencies\n\nTo build the Raspberry Pi documentation locally, you'll need Ruby, Python, and the Ninja build system.\n\n#### Linux\n\nUse `apt` to install the dependencies:\n\n```console\n$ sudo apt install -y ruby ruby-dev python3 python3-pip make ninja-build\n```\n\nThen, append the following lines to your `~/.bashrc` file (or equivalent shell configuration):\n\n```bash\nexport GEM_HOME=\"$(ruby -e 'puts Gem.user_dir')\"\nexport PATH=\"$PATH:$GEM_HOME/bin\"\n```\n\nClose and re-launch your terminal window to use the new dependencies and configuration.\n\n#### macOS\n\nIf you don't already have it, we recommend installing the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager: \n\n```console\n$ /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)\"\n```\n\nNext, use Homebrew to install Ruby:\n\n```console\n$ brew install ruby\n```\n\nAfter installing Ruby, follow the instructions provided by Homebrew to make your new Ruby version easily accessible from the command line.\n\nThen, use Homebrew to install the most recent version of Python:\n\n```console\n$ brew install python\n```\n\nThen, install the [Ninja build system](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ninja#default):\n\n```console\n$ brew install ninja\n```\n\n### Set up environment\n\nUse the `gem` package manager to install the [Ruby bundler](https://bundler.io/), which this repository uses to manage Ruby dependencies:\n\n```console\n$ gem install bundler\n```\n\nConfigure a Python virtual environment for this project:\n\n```console\n$ python -m venv .env\n```\n\nActivate the virtual environment:\n\n```console\n$ source .env/bin/activate\n```\n\n> [!TIP]\n> When you're using a virtual environment, you should see a `(.venv)` prefix at the start of your terminal prompt. At any time, run the `deactivate` command to exit the virtual environment.\n\nIn the virtual environment, install the [YAML module for Python 3](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/pyyaml#default):\n\n```console\n$ pip3 install pyyaml\n```\n\n### Build HTML\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> If you configured a Python virtual environment as recommended in the previous step, **always** run `source .env/bin/activate` before building. You must activate the virtual environment to access to all of the Python dependencies installed in that virtual environment.\n\nTo build the documentation and start a local server to preview the built site, run the following command:\n\n```console\n$ make serve_html\n```\n\nYou can access the virtual server at [http://127.0.0.1:4000/documentation/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/documentation/).\n\n> [!TIP]\n> To delete and rebuild the documentation site, run `make clean`, then re-run the build command. You'll need to do this every time you add or remove an Asciidoc, image, or video file.\n\n\n### Build the Pico C SDK Doxygen documentation\n\nThe Raspberry Pi documentation site includes a section of generated Asciidoc that we build from the [Doxygen Pico SDK documentation](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk).\n\nWe use the tooling in this repository and [doxygentoasciidoc](https://github.com/raspberrypi/doxygentoasciidoc) to generate that documentation section. By default, local documentation builds don't include this section because it takes a bit longer to build (tens of seconds) than the rest of the site.\n\nBuilding the Pico C SDK Doxygen documentation requires the following additional package dependencies:\n\n```console\n$ sudo apt install -y cmake gcc-arm-none-eabi doxygen graphviz\n```\n\nThen, initialise the Git submodules used in the Pico C SDK section build:\n\n```console\n$ git submodule update --init\n```\n\nRun the following command to build the Pico C SDK section Asciidoc files from the Doxygen source:\n\n```console\n$ make build_doxygen_adoc\n```\n\nThe next time you build the documentation site, you'll see the Pico C SDK section in your local preview.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> To delete and rebuild the generated files, run `make clean_doxygen_xml`, then re-run the build command.\n\n"

The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\n\n* __Considerations for licensors:__ Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. [More considerations for licensors](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors_and_licensees#Considerations_for_licensors).\n\n* __Considerations for the public:__ By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable. [More considerations for the public](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors_and_licensees#Considerations_for_licensees).\n\n## Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License\n\nBy exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License (\"Public License\"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\n\n### Section 1 – Definitions.\n\na. __Adapted Material__ means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n\nb. __Adapter's License__ means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\nc. __BY-SA Compatible License__ means a license listed at [creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses](http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses), approved by Creative Commons as essentially the equivalent of this Public License.\n\nd. __Copyright and Similar Rights__ means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\ne. __Effective Technological Measures__ means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.\n\nf. __Exceptions and Limitations__ means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\ng. __License Elements__ means the license attributes listed in the name of a Creative Commons Public License. The License Elements of this Public License are Attribution and ShareAlike.\n\nh. __Licensed Material__ means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.\n\ni. __Licensed Rights__ means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\n\nj. __Licensor__ means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.\n\nk. __Share__ means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.\n\nl. __Sui Generis Database Rights__ means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\n\nm. __You__ means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. __Your__ has a corresponding meaning.\n\n### Section 2 – Scope.\n\na. ___License grant.___\n\n   1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\n       A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and\n\n       B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n\n   2. __Exceptions and Limitations.__ For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.\n\n   3. __Term.__ The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).\n\n   4. __Media and formats; technical modifications allowed.__ The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n   5. __Downstream recipients.__\n\n       A. __Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material.__ Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n       B. __Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material.__ Every recipient of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.\n\n       C. __No downstream restrictions.__ You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.\n\n   6. __No endorsement.__ Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\nb. ___Other rights.___\n\n   1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n   2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.\n\n   3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n### Section 3 – License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.\n\na. ___Attribution.___\n\n   1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:\n\n       A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:\n\n         i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);\n\n         ii. a copyright notice;\n\n         iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n         iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;\n\n         v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;\n\n       B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n       C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n   2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.\n\n   3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.\n\nb. ___ShareAlike.___\n\nIn addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.\n\n1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons license with the same License Elements, this version or later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.\n\n2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share Adapted Material.\n\n3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.\n\n### Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\na. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;\n\nb. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and\n\nc. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n### Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\na. __Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.__\n\nb. __To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.__\n\nc. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\n\n### Section 6 – Term and Termination.\n\na. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\n\nb. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n   1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\n\n   2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n   For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\n\nc. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\n\nd. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\n\n### Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.\n\na. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\nb. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n### Section 8 – Interpretation.\n\na. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\n\nb. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\n\nc. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\n\nd. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n> Creative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.
