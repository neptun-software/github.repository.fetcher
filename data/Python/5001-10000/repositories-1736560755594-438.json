Clients can request partial file\n  downloads by adding a ``Range`` header to their media request (`#1050`_).\n- New: `Renderer classes`_. ``RENDERER`` allows to change enabled renderers.\n  Defaults to ``['eve.render.JSONRenderer', 'eve.render.XMLRenderer']``. You\n  can create your own renderer by subclassing ``eve.render.Renderer``. Each\n  renderer should set valid mime attr and have ``.render()`` method\n  implemented. Please note that at least one renderer must always be enabled\n  (`#1092`_).\n- New: ``on_delete_resource_originals`` fired when soft deletion occurs\n  (`#1030`_).\n- New: ``before_aggregation`` and ``after_aggregation`` event hooks allow to\n  attach `custom callbacks to aggregation endpoints`_ (`#1057`_).\n- New: ``JSON_REQUEST_CONTENT_TYPES`` or supported JSON content types. Useful\n  when you need support for vendor-specific json types. Please note: responses\n  will still carry the standard ``application/json`` type. Defaults to\n  ``['application/json']`` (`#1024`_).\n- New: when the media endpoint is enabled, the default authentication class\n  will be used to secure  it. (`#1083`_; `#1049`_).\n- New: ``MERGE_NESTED_DOCUMENTS``. If ``True``, updates to nested fields are\n  merged with the current data on ``PATCH``. If ``False``, the updates\n  overwrite the current data. Defaults to ``True`` (`#1140`_).\n- New: support for MongoDB decimal type ``bson.decimal128.Decimal128``\n  (`#1045`_).\n- New: Support for ``Feature`` and ``FeatureCollection`` GeoJSON objects\n  (`#769`_).\n- New: Add support for MongoDB ``$box`` geo query operator (`#1122`_).\n- New: ``ALLOW_CUSTOM_FIELDS_IN_GEOJSON`` allows custom fields in GeoJSON\n  (`#1004`_).\n- New: Add support for MongoDB ``$caseSensitive`` and ``$diactricSensitive``\n  query operators (`#1126`_).\n- New: Add support for MongoDB bitwise query operators ``$bitsAllClear``,\n  ``$bitsAllSet``, ``$bitsAnyClear``, ``$bitsAnySet`` (`#1053`_).\n- New: support for ``MONGO_AUTH_MECHANISM`` and\n  ``MONGO_AUTH_MECHANISM_PROPERTIES``.\n- New: ``MONGO_DBNAME`` can now be used in conjuction with ``MONGO_URI``.\n  Previously, if ``MONGO_URI`` was missing the database name, an exception\n  would be rised (`#1037`_).\n- Fix: OPLOG skipped even if ``OPLOG = True`` (`#1074`_).\n- Fix: Cannot define default projection and request specific field. (`#1036`_).\n- Fix: ``VALIDATE_FILTERS`` and ``ALLOWED_FILTERS`` do not work with\n  sub-document fields. (`#1123`_).\n- Fix: Aggregation query parameter does not replace keys in the lists\n  (`#1025`_).\n- Fix: serialization bug that randomly skips fields if \"x_of\" is encountered\n  (`#1042`_)\n- Fix: PUT behavior with User Restricted Resource Access. Ensure that, under\n  every circumstance, users are unable to overwrite items owned by other users\n  (`#1130`_).\n- Fix: Crash with Cerberus 1.2 (`#1137`_).\n- Fix documentation typos (`#1114`_, `#1102`_)\n- Fix: broken documentation links to Cerberus validation rules.\n- Fix: add sphinxcontrib-embedly to dev-requirements.txt.\n- Fix: Removed OrderedDict dependency; use ``OrderedDict`` from\n  ``backport_collections`` instead (`#1070`_).\n- Performance improved on retrieving a list of embedded documents (`#1029`_).\n- Dev: Refactor index creation. We now have a new\n  ``eve.io.mongo.ensure_mongo_indexes()`` function which ensures that eventual\n  ``mongo_indexes`` defined for a resource are created on the active database.\n  The function can be imported and invoked, for example in multi-db workflows\n  where a db is activated based on the authenticated user performing the\n  request (via custom auth classes).\n- Dev: Add a `Makefile with shortcuts`_ for testing, docs building, and\n  development install.\n- Dev: Switch to pytest as the standard testing tool.\n- Dev: Drop ``requiments.txt`` and ``dev-requirements.txt``. Use ``pip install\n  -e .[dev|tests|docs]`` instead.\n- Tests: finally acknowledge the existence of modern APIs for both Mongo and\n  Python (get rid of most deprecation warnings).\n- Change: Support for Cerberus 1.0+ (`#776`_).\n- Change: ``JSON`` and ``XML`` settings are deprecated and will be removed in\n  a future update. Use ``RENDERERS`` instead (`#1092`_).\n- Flask dependency set to >=1.0 (`#1111`_).\n- PyMongo dependency set to >=3.5.\n- Events dependency set to >=v0.3.\n- Drop Flask-PyMongo dependency, use custom code instead (`#855`_).\n- Docs: Comprehensive rewrite of the `How to contribute`_ page.\n- Docs: Drop the testing page; merge its contents with `How to contribute`_.\n- Docs: Add link to the `Eve course`_. It was authored by the project author,\n  and it is hosted by TalkPython Training.\n- Docs: code snippets are now Python 3 compatibile (Pahaz Blinov).\n- Dev: Delete and cleanup of some unnecessary code.\n- Dev: after the latest update (May 4th) travis-ci would not run tests on\n  Python 2.6.\n- Dev: all branches are now tested on travis-ci. Previously, only 'master' was\n  being tested.\n- Dev: fix insidious bug in ``tests.methods.post.TestPost`` class.\n\n.. _breaking_changes:\n\nBreaking Changes\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n- Python 2.6 and Python 3.3 are no longer supported (`#1129`_).\n- Eve now relies on `Cerberus`_ 1.1+  (`#776`_). It allows for many new\n  powerful validation and trasformation features (like `schema registries`_),\n  improved performance and, in general, a more streamlined API. It also brings\n  some notable breaking changes.\n\n    - ``keyschema`` was renamed to ``valueschema``, and ``propertyschema`` to\n      ``keyschema``.\n    - A PATCH on a document which misses a field having a default value will\n      now result in setting this value, even if the field was not provided in\n      the PATCH's payload.\n    - Error messages for ``keyschema`` are now returned as dictionary. Example:\n      ``{'a_dict': {'a_field': \"value does not match regex '[a-z]+'\"}}``.\n    - Error messages for type validations are `different now`_.\n    - It is no longer valid to have a field with ``default = None`` and\n      ``nullable = False`` (see\n      *patch.py:test_patch_nested_document_nullable_missing*).\n    - And more. A complete list of breaking changes  is available here_. For\n      detailed upgrade instructions, see Cerberus `upgrade notes`_. An in-depth\n      analysis of changes made to the codebase (useful if you wrote a custom\n      validator which needs to be upgraded) is available with `this commit\n      message`_.\n    - Special thanks to Dominik Kellner and Brad P. Crochet for the amazing job\n      done on this upgrade.\n\n- Config setting ``MONGO_AUTHDBNAME`` renamed into ``MONGO_AUTH_SOURCE`` for\n  naming consistency with PyMongo.\n- Config options ``MONGO_MAX_POOL_SIZE``, ``MONGO_SOCKET_TIMEOUT_MS``,\n  ``MONGO_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS``, ``MONGO_REPLICA_SET``,\n  ``MONGO_READ_PREFERENCE`` removed. Use ``MONGO_OPTIONS`` or ``MONGO_URI``\n  instead.\n- Be aware that ``DELETE`` on sub-resource endpoint will now only delete the\n  documents matching endpoint semantics. A delete operation on\n  ``people/51f63e0838345b6dcd7eabff/invoices`` will delete all documents\n  matching the followig query: ``{'contact_id': '51f63e0838345b6dcd7eabff'}``\n  (`#1010`_).\n\n.. _#1140: https://github.com/pyeve/eve/pull/1140\n.. _#1111: https://github.com/pyeve/eve/issues/1111\n.. _#1129: https://github.com/pyeve/eve/issues/1129\n.. _#1057: https://github.com/pyeve/eve/issues/1057\n.. _#1137: https://github.com/pyeve/eve/issues/1137\n.. _#1122: https://github.com/pyeve/eve/issues/1122\n.. _#1050: https://github.com/pyeve/eve/pull/1050\n.. _#1130: https://github.com/pyeve/eve/pull/1130\n.. _#1074: https://github.com/pyeve/eve/issues/1074\n.. _#1036: https://github.com/pyeve/eve/issues/1036\n.. _#1128: https://github.com/pyeve/eve/pull/1128\n.. _#1126: https://github.com/pyeve/eve/pull/1126\n.. _#1123: https://github.com/pyeve/eve/issues/1123\n.. _#1102: https://github.com/pyeve/eve/pull/1102\n.. _#1114: https://github.com/pyeve/eve/pull/1114\n.. _#1092: https://github.com/pyeve/eve/pull/1092\n.. _#1083: https://github.com/pyeve/eve/issues/1083\n.. _#1049: https://github.com/pyeve/eve/issues/1049\n.. _#1053: https://github.com/pyeve/eve/issues/1053\n.. _#1070: https://github.com/pyeve/eve/pull/1070\n.. _#1045: https://github.com/pyeve/eve/issues/1045\n.. _#1042: https://github.com/pyeve/eve/pull/1042\n.. _#1030: https://github.com/pyeve/eve/pull/1030\n.. _#1037: https://github.com/pyeve/eve/issues/1037\n.. _#1029: https://github.com/pyeve/eve/issues/1029\n.. _#1024: https://github.com/pyeve/eve/issues/1024\n.. _#769: https://github.com/pyeve/eve/issues/769\n.. _#1004: https://github.com/pyeve/eve/issues/1004\n.. _#776: https://github.com/pyeve/eve/issues/776\n.. _#855: https://github.com/pyeve/eve/issues/855\n.. _#1010: https://github.com/pyeve/eve/issues/1010\n.. _#1025: https://github.com/pyeve/eve/issues/1025\n.. _Cerberus: http://python-cerberus.org\n.. _`schema registries`: http://docs.python-cerberus.org/en/stable/schemas.html#registries\n.. _`different now`: http://docs.python-cerberus.org/en/stable/upgrading.html#data-types\n.. _here: http://docs.python-cerberus.org/en/stable/changelog.html#breaking-changes\n.. _`upgrade notes`: http://python-cerberus.org/en/stable/upgrading.html\n.. _`this commit message`: https://github.com/pyeve/eve/pull/1001/commits/1110f807b478efa9f13ad1d217d22ceaa2a9e42d\n.. _`partial media requests`: http://python-eve.org/features.html#partial-media-downloads\n.. _`custom callbacks to aggregation endpoints`: http://python-eve.org/features.html#aggregation-event-hooks\n.. _`Renderer classes`: http://python-eve.org/features.html#rendering\n.. _`makefile with shortcuts`: http://python-eve.org/contributing.html#make-targets\n.. _`How to contribute`: http://python-eve.org/contributing.html\n.. _`Eve course`: https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/explore_eve/eve-building-restful-mongodb-backed-apis-course\n\nVersion 0.7.10\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nReleased on July 15, 2018.\n\n- Fix: Pin Flask-PyMongo dependency to avoid crash with Flask-PyMongo 2.\n  Closes #1172.\n\nVersion 0.7.9\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nReleased on May 10, 2018\n\n- Python 2.6 and Python 3.3 are deprecated.

Closes #994.\n- Fix: When there is ``MONGO_URI`` defined it will be used no matter if the\n  resource is using a prefix or not (Petr Jašek).\n- Docs: Add code snippet with an example of how to implement a simple list of\n  items that supports both list-level and item-level CRUD operations (John\n  Chang).\n\nVersion 0.7.1\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nReleased on 14 February, 2017\n\n- Fix: \"Cannot create a consistent method resolution order\" on Python 3.5.2 and\n  3.6 since Eve 0.7. Closes #984.\n\n- Docs: update README with svg bade (Sobolev Nikita).\n- Docs: fix typo and dead link to Nicola's website (Dominik Kellner).\n\n- ``develop`` branch has been dropped. ``master`` is now the default project\n  branch.\n\nVersion 0.7\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nReleased on 6 February, 2017\n\n- New: Add Python 3.6 as a supported interpreter.\n\n- New: ``OPTIMIZE_PAGINATION_FOR_SPEED``. Set this to ``True`` to improve\n  pagination performance. When optimization is active no count operation, which\n  can be slow on large collections, is performed on the database. This does\n  have a few consequences. Firstly, no document count is returned. Secondly,\n  ``HATEOAS`` is less accurate: no last page link is available, and next page\n  link is always included, even on last page. On big collections, switching\n  this feature on can greatly improve performance. Defaults to ``False``\n  (slower performance; document count included; accurate ``HATEOAS``). Closes\n  #944 and #853.\n\n\n- New: ``Location`` header is returned on ``201 Created`` POST responses. If\n  will contain the URI to the created document. If bulk inserts are enabled,\n  only the first document URI is returned. Closes #795.\n\n- New: Pretty printing.You can pretty print the response by specifying a query\n  parameter named ``?pretty`` (Hasan Pekdemir).\n\n- New: ``AUTO_COLLAPSE_MULTI_KEYS``. If set to ``True``, multiple values sent\n  with the same key, submitted using the ``application/x-www-form-urlencoded``\n  or ``multipart/form-data`` content types, will automatically be converted to\n  a list of values. When using this together with ``AUTO_CREATE_LISTS`` it\n  becomes possible to use lists of media fields. Defaults to ``False``. Closes\n  #932 (Conrad Burchert).\n\n- New: ``AUTO_CREATE_LISTS``. When submitting a non ``list`` type value for\n  a field with type ``list``, automatically create a one element list before\n  running the validators. Defaults to ``False`` (Conrad Burchert).\n\n- New: Flask-PyMongo compatibility for for ``MONGO_CONNECT`` config setting\n  (Massimo Scamarcia).\n\n- New: Add Python 3.5 as a supported interpreter (Mattias Lundberg).\n\n- New: ``MONGO_OPTIONS`` allows MongoDB arguments to be passed to the\n  MongoClient object. Defaults to ``{}`` (Massimo Scamarcia).\n\n- New: Regexes are allowed by setting ``X_DOMAINS_RE`` values. This allows CORS\n  to support websites with dynamic ranges of subdomains. Closes #660 and #974.\n\n- New: If ``ENFORCE_IF_MATCH`` option is active, then all requests are expected\n  to include the ``If-Match`` or they will be rejected (same as old behavior).\n  However, if ``ENFORCE_IF_MATCH`` is disabled, then client determines whether\n  request is conditional. When ``If-Match`` is included, then request is\n  conditional, otherwise the request is processed with no conditional checks.\n  Closes #657 (Arthur Burkart).\n\n- New: Allow old document versions to be cache validated using ETags (Nick\n  Park).\n\n- New: Support weak ETags, commonly applied by servers transmitting gzipped\n  content (Nick Park).\n\n- New: ``on_oplog_push`` event is fired when OPLOG is about to be updated.\n  Callbacks receive two arguments: ``resource`` (resource name) and ``entries``\n  (list of oplog entries which are about to be written).\n\n- New: optional ``extra`` field is available for OPLOG entries. Can be updated\n  by callbacks hooked to the new ``on_oplog_push`` event.\n\n- New: OPLOG audit now include the username or token when available. Closes\n  #846.\n\n- New ``get_internal`` and ``getitem_internal`` functions can be used for\n  internal GET calls. These methods are not rate limited, authentication is not\n  checked and pre-request events are not raised.\n\n- New: Add support for MongoDB ``DBRef`` fields (Roman Gavrilov).\n\n- New: ``MULTIPART_FORM_FIELDS_AS_JSON``. In case you are submitting your\n  resource as ``multipart/form-data`` all form data fields will be submitted as\n  strings, breaking any validation rules you might have on the resource fields.\n  If you want to treat all submitted form data as JSON strings you will have to\n  activate this setting. Closes #806 (Stratos Gerakakis).\n\n- New: Support for MongoDB Aggregation Framework. Endpoints can respond with\n  aggregation results. Clients can optionally influence aggregation\n  results by using the new ``aggregate`` option: ``aggregate={\"$year\": 2015}``.\n\n- New: Flask views (``@app.route``) can now set ``mongo_prefix`` via Flask's\n  ``g`` object: ``g.mongo_prefix = 'MONGO2'`` (Gustavo Vargas).\n\n- New: Query parameters not recognised by Eve are now returned in HATEOAS URLs\n  (Mugur Rus).\n\n- New: ``OPLOG_CHANGE_METHODS`` is a list of HTTP methods which operations will\n  include changes into the OpLog (mmizotin).\n\n- Change: Return ``428 Precondition Required`` instead of a generic ``403\n  Forbidden`` when the ``If-Match`` request header is missing (Arnau Orriols).\n\n- Change: ETag response header now conforms to RFC 7232/2.3 and is surrounded\n  by double quotes. Closes #794.\n\n- Fix: Better locating of ``settings.py``. On startup, if settings flag is\n  omitted in constructor, Eve will try to locate file named settings.py, first\n  in the application folder and then in one of the application's subfolders.\n  You can choose an alternative filename/path, just pass it as an argument when\n  you instantiate the application. If the file path is relative, Eve will try\n  to locate it recursively in one of the folders in your sys.path, therefore\n  you have to be sure that your application root is appended to it. This is\n  useful, for example, in testing environments, when settings file is not\n  necessarily located in the root of your application. Closes #820 (Mario\n  Kralj).\n\n- Fix: Versioning does not work with User Restricted Resource Access. Closes\n  #967 (Kris Lambrechts)\n\n- Fix: ``test_create_indexes()`` typo. Closes 960.\n\n- Fix: fix crash when attempting to modify a document ``_id`` on MongoDB 3.4\n  (Giorgos Margaritis)\n\n- Fix: improve serialization of boolean values. Closes #947 (NotSpecial).\n\n- Fix: fix intermittently failing test. Closes #934 (Conrad Burchert).\n\n- Fix: Multiple, fast (within a 1 second window) and neutral (no actual\n  changes) PATCH requests should not raise ``412 Precondition Failed``.\n  Closes #920.\n\n- Fix: Resource titles are not properly escaped during the XML rendering of the\n  root document (Kris Lambrechts).\n\n- Fix: ETag request headers which conform to RFC 7232/2.3 (double quoted value)\n  are now properly processed. Addresses #794.\n\n- Fix: Deprecation warning from Flask. Closes #898 (George Lestaris).\n\n- Fix: add Support serialization on lists using anyof, oneof, allof, noneof.\n  Closes #876 (Carles Bruguera).\n\n- Fix: update security example snippets to match with current API (Stanislav\n  Filin).\n\n- Fix: ``notifications.py`` example snippet crashes due to lack of ``DOMAIN``\n  setting (Stanislav Filin).\n\n- Docs: clarify documentation for custom validators: Cerberus dependency is\n  still pinned to version 0.9.2. Upgrade to Cerberus 1.0+ is planned with v0.8.\n  Closes #796.\n- Docs: remove the deprecated ``--ditribute`` virtualenv option (Eugene\n  Prikazchikov).\n- Docs: add date and subdocument fields filtering examples. Closes #924.\n- Docs: add Eve-Neo4j to the extensions page (Rodrigo Rodriguez).\n- Docs: stress that alternate backends are supported via community extensions.\n- Docs: clarify that Redis is an optional dependency (Mateusz Łoskot).\n\n- Update license to 2017. Closes #955.\n- Update: Flask 0.12. Closes #945, #904 and #963.\n- Update: PyMongo 3.4 is now required. Closes #964.\n\nVersion 0.6.4\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nReleased on 8 June, 2016\n\n- Fix: Cannot serialize data when a field that has a ``valueschema`` that is of\n  ``dict`` type. Closes #874.\n- Fix: Authorization header bearer tokens not parsed correctly. Closes #866\n  (James Stewart).\n- Fix: TokenAuth prevents base64 decoding of Tokens. Closes #840.\n- Fix: If datasource source is specified no fields are included by default.\n  Closes #842.\n\n- Docs: streamline Quickstart guide. Closes #868.\n- Docs: fix broken link in Installation page. Closes #861.\n- Docs: Resource configuration doesn't mention ``versioning`` override. Closes\n  #845.\n\nVersion 0.6.3\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nReleased on 16 March, 2016\n\n- Fix: Since 0.6.2, static projections are not honoured. Closes #837.\n\n\nVersion 0.6.2\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nReleased on 14 March, 2016\n\n- Fix: ``Access-Control-Allow-Max-Age`` should actually be\n  ``Access-Control-Max-Age``. Closes #829.\n- Fix: ``unique`` validation rule is checked against soft deleted documents.\n  Closes #831.\n- Fix: Mongo does not allow ``$`` and ``.`` in field names. Apply this\n  validation in schemas and dict fields. Closes #780.\n- Fix: Remove \"ensure uniqueness of (custom) id fields\" feature. Addresses\n  #788.\n- Fix: ``409 Conflict`` not reported since upgrading to PyMongo 3. Closes #680.\n- Fix: when a document is soft deleted, the OPLOG `_updated` field is not the\n  time of the deletion but the time of the previous last update (Cyril\n  Bonnard).\n- Fix: TokenAuth. When the tokens are passed as \"Authorization: \" or\n  \"Authorization: Token \" headers, werkzeug does not recognize them as valid\n  authorization header, therefore the ``request.authorization`` field is empty\n  (Luca Di Gaspero).\n- Fix: ``SCHEMA_ENDPOINT`` does not work when schema has lambda function as\n  ``coerce`` rule. Closes #790.\n- Fix: CORS pre-flight requests malfunction on ``SCHEMA_ENDPOINT`` endpoint\n  (Valerie Coffman).\n- Fix: do not attempt to parse ``number`` values as strings when they are\n  numerical (Nick Park).\n- Fix: the ``__init__.py`` ``ITEM_URL`` does not match default_settings.py.\n  Closes #786 (Ralph Smith).\n- Fix: startup crash when both ``SOFT_DELETE`` and ``ALLOW_UNKNOWN`` are\n  enabled. Closes #800.\n- Fix: Serialize inside ``of`` and ``of_type`` rules new in Cerberus 0.9.\n  Closes #692 (Arnau Orriols).\n- Fix: In ``put_internal`` Validator is not set when ``skip_validation`` is\n  ``true`` (Wei Guan).\n- Fix: In ``patch_internal`` Validator is not set when ``skip_validation`` is\n  ``true`` (Stratos Gerakakis).\n- Fix: Add missing serializer for fields of type ``number`` (Arnau Orriols).\n- Fix: Skip any null value from serialization (Arnau Orriols).\n- Fix: When ``SOFT_DELETE`` is active an exclusive ``datasource.projection``\n  causes a ``500`` error. Closes #752.\n\n- Update: PyMongo 3.2 is now required.\n- Update: Flask-PyMongo 0.4+ is now required.\n- Update: Werkzeug up to 0.11.4 is now required\n- Change: simplejson v3.8.2 is now required.\n\n- Docs: fix some typos (Manquer, Patrick Decat).\n- Docs: add missing imports to authentication docs (Hamdy)\n- Update license to 2016 (Prayag Verma)\n\nVersion 0.6.1\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nReleased on 29 October, 2015\n\n- New: ``BULK_ENABLED`` enables/disables bulk insert. Defaults to ``True``\n  (Julian Hille).\n- New: ``VALIDATE_FILTERS`` enables/disables validating of query filters\n  against resource schema. Closes #728 (Stratos Gerakakis).\n- New: ``TRANSPARENT_SCHEMA_RULES`` enables/disables schema validation globally\n  and ``transparent_schema_rules`` per resource (Florian Rathgeber).\n- New: ``ALLOW_OVERRIDE_HTTP_METHOD`` enables/disables support for overriding\n  request methods with ``X-HTTP-Method-Override`` headers (Julian Hille).\n\n- Fix: flake8 fails on Python 3. Closes #747 (Simon Schönfeld).\n- Fix: recursion for dotted field normalization (Matt Tucker).\n- Fix: dependendencies on sub-document fields always return 422. Closes #706.\n- Fix: invoking ``post_internal`` with ``skpi_validation = True`` causes\n  a ``422`` response. Closes #726.\n- Fix: explict inclusive datasource projection is ignored. Closes #722.\n\n- Dev: fix rate limiting tests so they don't occasionally fail.\n- Dev: make sure connections opened by test suite are properly closed on\n  teardown.\n- Dev: use middleware to parse overrides and eventually update request method\n  (Julian Hille).\n- Dev: optimize versioning by building specific versions without deepcopying\n  the root document (Nick Park).\n- Dev: ``_client_projection`` method has been moved up from the mongo layer to\n  the base DataLayer class. It is now available for other data layers\n  implementations, such as Eve-SQLAlchemy (Gonéri Le Bouder).\n\n- Docs: add instructions for installing dependencies and building docs (Florian\n  Rathgeber).\n- Docs: fix link to contributing guidelines (Florian Rathgeber).\n- Docs: fix some typos (Stratos Gerakakis, Julian Hille).\n- Docs: add Eve-Swagger to Extensions page.\n- Docs: fix broken link to Mongo's capped collections (Nathan Reynolds).\n\n\nVersion 0.6\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nReleased on 28 September, 2015\n\n- New: support for embedding simple ObjectId fields: you can now use the\n  ``data_relation`` rule on them (Gonéri Le Bouder).\n- New: support for multiple layers of embedding (Gonéri Le Bouder).\n- New: ``SCHEMA_ENDPOINT`` allows resource schema to be returned from an API\n  endpoint (Nick Park).\n- New: HATEOAS links can be customized from within callback functions (Magdas\n  Adrian).\n- New: ``_INFO``: string value to include an info section, with the given INFO\n  name, at the Eve homepage (suggested value ``_info``). The info section will\n  include Eve server version and API version (API_VERSION, if set).  ``None``\n  otherwise, if you do not want to expose any server info. Defaults to ``None``\n  (Stratos Gerakakis).\n- New: ``id_field`` sets a field used to uniquely identify resource items\n  within the database. Locally overrides ``ID_FIELD`` (Dominik Kellner).\n- New: ``UPSERT_ON_PUT`` allows document creation on PUT if the document does\n  not exist. Defaults to ``True``. See below for details.\n- New: PUT attempts to create a document if it does not exist. The URL endpoint\n  will be used as ``ID_FIELD`` value (if ``ID_FIELD`` is included with the\n  payload, it will be ignored). Normal validation rules apply. The response\n  will be a ``201 Created`` on successful creation. Response payload will be\n  identical the one you would get by performing a single document POST to the\n  resource endpoint. Set ``UPSET_ON_PUT`` to ``False`` to disable this\n  behaviour, and get a ``404`` instead.  Closes #634.\n- New: POST accepts documents which include ``ID_FIELD`` (``_id``) values. This\n  is in addition to the old behaviour of auto-generating ``ID_FIELD`` values\n  when the submitted document does not contain it. Please note that, while you\n  can add ``ID_FIELD`` to the schema (previously not allowed), you don't really\n  have to, unless its type is different from the ``ObjectId`` default. This\n  means that in most cases you can start storing ``ID_FIELD``-included\n  documents right away, without making any changes.\n- New: Log MongoDB and HTTP methods exceptions (Sebastien Estienne).\n- New: Enhanced Logging.\n- New: ``VALIDATION_ERROR_AS_LIST``. If ``True`` even single field errors will\n  be returned in a list. By default single field errors are returned as strings\n  while multiple field errors are bundled in a list. If you want to standardize\n  the field errors output, set this setting to ``True`` and you will always get\n  a list of field issues. Defaults to ``False``. Closes #536.\n- New: ``STANDARD_ERRORS`` is a list of HTTP codes that will be served with the\n  canonical API response format, which includes a JSON body providing both\n  error code and description. Addresses #586.\n- New: ``anyof`` validation rule allows you to list multiple sets of rules to\n  validate against.\n- New: ``alloff`` validation rule, same as ``anyof`` except that all rule\n  collections in the list must validate.\n- New: ``noneof`` validation rule. Same as ``anyof`` except that it requires no\n  rule collections in the list to validate.\n- New: ``oneof`` validation rule. Same as ``anyof`` except that only one rule\n  collections in the list can validate.\n- New: ``valueschema`` validation rules replaces the now deprecated\n  ``keyschema`` rule.\n- New: ``propertyschema`` is the counterpart to ``valueschema`` that validates\n  the keys of a dict.\n- New: ``coerce`` validation rule. Type coercion allows you to apply a callable\n  to a value before any other validators run.\n- New: ``MONGO_AUTHDBNAME`` allows to specify a MongoDB authorization database.\n  Defaults to ``None`` (David Wood).\n- New: ``remove`` method in Mongo data layer now returns the deletion status or\n  ``None`` if write acknowledgement is disabled (Mayur Dhamanwala).\n- New: ``unique_to_user`` validation rule allows to validate that a field value\n  is unique to the user. Different users can share the same value for the\n  field. This is useful when User Restricted Resource Access is enabled on an\n  endpoint. If URRA is not active on the endpoint, this rule behaves like\n  ``unique``. Closes #646.\n- New: ``MEDIA_BASE_URL`` allows to set a custom base URL to be used when\n  ``RETURN_MEDIA_AS_URL`` is active (Henrique Barroso).\n- New: ``SOFT_DELETE`` enables soft deletes when set to ``True`` (Nick Park.)\n- New: ``mongo_indexes`` allows for creation of MongoDB indexes at application\n  launch (Pau Freixes.)\n- New: clients can opt out of default embedded fields:\n  ``?embedded={\"author\":0}`` would cause the embedded author not to be included\n  with response payload. (Tobias Betz.)\n- New: CORS: Support for ``X-ALLOW-CREDENTIALS`` (Cyprien Pannier.)\n- New: Support for dot notation in POST, PATCH and PUT methods. Be aware that,\n  for PATCH and PUT, if dot notation is used even on just one field, the whole\n  sub-document will be replaced. So if this document is stored:\n\n  ``{\"name\": \"john\", \"location\": {\"city\": \"New York\", \"address\": \"address\"}}``\n\n  A PATCH like this:\n\n    ``{\"location.city\": \"Boston\"}``\n\n  (which is exactly equivalent to:)\n\n    ``{\"location\": {\"city\": \"a nested city\"}}``\n\n  Will update the document to:\n\n  ``{\"name\": \"john\", \"location\": {\"city\": \"Boston\"}}``\n\n- New: JSONP Support (Tim Jacobi.)\n- New: Support for multiple MongoDB databases and/or servers.\n\n  - ``mongo_prefix`` resource setting allows overriding of the default\n    ``MONGO`` prefix used when retrieving MongoDB settings from configuration.\n    For example, set a resource ``mongo_prefix`` to ``MONGO2`` to read/write\n    from the database configured with that prefix in your settings file\n    (``MONGO2_HOST``, ``MONGO2_DBNAME``, etc.)\n  - ``set_mongo_prefix()`` and ``get_mongo_prefix()`` have been added to\n    ``BasicAuth`` class and derivates. These can be used to arbitrarily set\n    the target database depending on the token/client performing the request.\n\n  Database connections are cached in order to not to loose performance. Also,\n  this change only affects the MongoDB engine, so extensions currently\n  targetting other databases should not need updates (they will not inherit\n  this feature however.)\n- New: Enable ``on_pre_GET`` hook for HEAD requests (Daniel Lytkin.).\n- New: Add ``X-Total-Count`` header for collection GET/HEAD requests (Daniel\n  Lytkin.).\n- New: ``RETURN_MEDIA_AS_URL``, ``MEDIA_ENDPOINT`` and ``MEDIA_URL`` allow for\n  serving files at a dedicated media endpoint while urls are returned in\n  document media fields (Daniel Lytkin.)\n- New: ``etag_ignore_fields``. Resource setting with a list of fields belonging\n  to the schema that won't be used to compute the ETag value. Defaults to\n  ``None`` (Olivier Carrère.)\n\n- Change: when HATEOAS is off the home endpoint will respond with ``200 OK``\n  instead of ``404 Not Found`` (Stratos Gerakakis).\n- Change: PUT does not return ``404`` if a document URL does not exist. It will\n  attempt to create the document instead. Set ``UPSET_ON_PUT`` to ``False`` to\n  disable this behaviour and get a ``404`` instead.\n- Change: A PATCH including an ``ID_FIELD`` field which value is different than\n  the original will get a ``400 Bad Request``, along with an explanation in the\n  message body that the field is immutable. Previously, it would get an\n  ``unknown field`` validation error.\n\n- Dev: Improve GET perfomance on large versioned documents (Nick Park.)\n- Dev: The ``MediaStorage`` base class now accepts the active resource as an\n  argument for its methods. This allows data-layers to avoid resorting to the\n  Flask request object to determine the active resource. To preserve backward\n  compatibility the new ``resource`` argument defaults to ``None`` (Magdas\n  Adrian).\n- Dev: The Mongo data-layer is not dependant on the Flask request object\n  anymore. It will still fallback to it if the ``resource`` argument is\n  ``None``. Closes #632. (Magdas Adrian).\n\n- Fix: store versions in the same mongo collection when ``datasource`` is used\n  (Magdas Adrian).\n- Fix: Update ``serialize`` to gracefully handle non-dictionary values in dict\n  type fields (Nick Park).\n- Fix: changes to the ``updates`` argument, applied by callbacks hooked to the\n  ``on_updated`` event, were not persisted to the database (Magdas Adrian).\n  Closes #682.\n- Fix: Changes applied to the ``updates`` argument``on_updated`` returns the\n  whole updated document. Previously, it was only returning the updates sent\n  with the request. Closes #682.\n- Fix: Replace the Cerberus rule ``keyschema``, now deprecated, with the new\n  ``propertyschema`` (Julian Hille).\n- Fix: some error message are not filtered out of debug mode anymore, as they\n  are useful for users and do not leak information. Closes #671 (Sebastien\n  Estienne).\n- Fix: reinforce Content-Type Header handling to avoid possible crash when it\n  is missing (Sebastien Estienne).\n- Fix: some schema errors were not being reported as SchemaError exceptions.\n  A more generic 'DOMAIN missing or wrong' message was returned instead.\n- Fix: When versioning is enabled on a resource with a custom ID_FIELD,\n  versioning documents will inherit their ID from the versioned document,\n  making any update of the document result in a DuplicateKeyError (Matthieu\n  Prat).\n- Fix: Filter validation fails to validate query selectors that contain a value\n  of the list data-type, which is not a list of sub-queries. See #674 (Matthieu\n  Prat).\n- Fix: ``_validate_dependencies`` always returns ``None``.\n- Fix: ``412 Precondition Failed`` does not return a JSON body. Closes #661.\n- Fix: ``embedded_fields`` may point on a field that come from another embedded\n  document. For example, ``['a.b.c', 'a.b', 'a']`` (Gonéri Le Bouder).\n- Fix: add handling of sub-resource resolving for PUT method (Olivier Poitrey).\n- Fix: ``dependencies`` rule would mistakenly validate documents when target\n  fields happened to also have a ``default`` value.\n- Fix: According to RFC2617 the separator should be (=) instead of (:). This\n  caused at least Chrome not to prompt user for the credentials, and not to\n  send the Authorization header even when credentials were in the url (Samuli\n  Tuomola).\n- Fix: make sure ``unique`` validation rule is consistent between HTTP methods.\n  A field value must be unique within the datasource, regardless of the user\n  who created it. Closes #646.\n- Fix: OpLog domain entry is not created if ``OPLOG_ENDPOINT`` is ``None``.\n  Closes #628.\n- Fix: Do not overwrite ``ID_FIELD`` as it is not a sub resource. See #641 for\n  details (Olivier Poitrey).\n- Fix: ETag computation crash when non-standard json serializers are used\n  (Kevin Roy.)\n- Fix: Remove duplicate item in Mongo operators list. Closes #619.\n- Fix: Versioning: invalidate cache when ``_latest_version`` changes in\n  versioned doc (Nick Park.)\n- Fix: snippet in account management tutorial (xgddsg.)\n- Fix: ``MONGO_REPLICA_SET`` and other significant Flask-PyMongo settings have\n  been added to the documentation. Closes #615.\n- Fix: Serialization of lists of lists (Nick Park.)\n- Fix: Make sure ``original`` is not modified during ``PATCH``. Closes #611\n  (Petr Jašek.)\n- Fix: Route parameters are applied to new documents before they are validated.\n  This ensures that documents with required fields will be populated before\n  they are validated. Addresses #354. (Matthew Ellison.)\n- Fix: ``GridFSMediaStorage`` does not save filename. Closes #605 (Sam Luu).\n- Fix: Reinforce GeoJSON validation (Joakim Uddholm.)\n- Fix: Geopoint coordinates do not accept integers. Closes #591 (Joakim\n  Uddholm.)\n- Fix: OpLog enabled makes PUT return wrong Etag. Closes #590.\n\n- Update: Cerberus 0.9.2 is now required.\n- Update: PyMongo 2.8 is now required (which in turn supports MongoDB 3.0)\n\nVersion 0.5.3\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nReleased on 17 March, 2015.\n\n- Fix: Support for Cerberus 0.8.1.\n- Fix: Don't block on first field serialization exception. Closes #568.\n- Fix: Ignore read-only fields in ``PUT`` requests when their values aren't\n  changed compared to the stored document (Bjorn Andersson.)\n\n- Docs: replace ``file`` with ``media`` type.

You now get\n  ``games/<game_id>/images`` where previously you would get\n  ``games/<regex('[a-f0-9]{24}'):game_id>/images``). Closes #466.\n- New: ``JSON_SORT_KEYS`` enables JSON key sorting (Matt Creenan).\n- New: Add the current query string to the self link for responses with\n  multiple documents. Closes #464 (Jen Montes).\n- New: When document versioning is on, add ``?version=<version_num>`` to\n  HATEOAS self links. Also adds pagination links for ``?version=all`` and\n  ``?version=diffs`` requests when the number exceeds the max results.\n  Partially addresses #475 (Jen Montes).\n- New: ``QUERY_WHERE`` allows to set the query parameter key for filters.\n  Defaults to ``where``.\n- New: ``QUERY_SORT`` allows to set the query parameter key for sorting.\n  Defaults to ``sort``.\n- New: ``QUERY_PAGE`` allows to set the query parameter key for pagination.\n  Defaults to ``page``.\n- New: ``QUERY_PROJECTION`` allows to set the query parameter key for\n  projections.

Closes #398 #401.\n- Change: If-Modified-Since has been disabled on resource (collections)\n  endpoints. Same functionality is available with a ``?where={\"_udpated\":\n  {\"$gt\": \"<RFC1123 date>\"}}`` request. The OpLog also allows retrieving\n  detailed changes happened at any endpoint, deleted documents included.\n  Closes #334.\n- Change: etags are now persisted with the documents. This ensures that etags\n  are consistent across queries, even when projection queries are issued.\n  Please note that etags will only be stored along with new documents created\n  and/or edited via API methods (POST/PUT/PATCH). Documents inserted by other\n  means and those stored with v0.4 and below will keep working as previously:\n  their etags will be computed on-the-fly and you will get still be getting\n  inconsistent etags when projection queries are issued.

Closes #415.\n- Fix: Recursively validate the whole query string.\n- Fix: If the data layer supports a list of allowed query operators, take\n  them into consideration when validating a query string. Closes #388.\n- Fix: Abort with 400 if unsupported query operators are used. Closes #387.\n- Fix: Return the error if a blacklisted MongoDB operator is used in a query\n  (debug mode).\n- Fix: Invalid sort syntax raises 500 instead of 400. Addresses #378.\n- Fix: Fix serialization when `type` is missing in schema. #404 (Jaroslav\n  Semančík).\n- Fix: When PUTting or PATCHing media fields, they would not be properly\n  replaced as needed (Stanislav Heller).\n- Fix: ``test_get_sort_disabled`` occasional failure.\n- Fix: A POST with an empty array leads to a server crash.

Closes #365\n  (Olivier Poitrey).\n- [new] Apply sub-request route's params to the created document if matching\n  the schema, e.g. a POST on ``/people/1234…/invoices`` will set the\n  ``contact_id`` field to 1234… so created invoice is automatically associated\n  with the parent resource (Olivier Poitrey).\n- [new] Allow some more HTTP errors (403 and 404) to be thrown from db hooks\n  (Olivier Poitrey).\n- [new] ``ALLOWED_READ_ROLES``. A list of allowed `roles` for resource\n  endpoints with GET and OPTIONS methods (Olivier Poitrey).\n- [new] ``ALLOWED_WRITE_ROLES``. A list of allowed `roles` for resource\n  endpoints with POST, PUT and DELETE methods (Olivier Poitrey).\n- [new] ``ALLOWED_ITEM_READ_ROLES``. A list of allowed `roles` for item\n  endpoints with GET and OPTIONS methods (Olivier Poitrey).\n- [new] ``ALLOWED_ITEM_WRITE_ROLES``. A list of allowed `roles` for item\n  endpoints with PUT, PATCH and DELETE methods (Olivier Poitrey).\n- [new] 'dependencies' validation rule.\n- [new] 'keyschema' validation rule.\n- [new] 'regex' validation rule.\n- [new] 'set' as a core data type.\n- [new] 'min' and 'max' now apply to floats and numbers too.\n- [new] File Storage. ``EXTENDED_MEDIA_INFO`` allows a list of meta fields\n  (file properties) to forward from the file upload driver (Ben Demaree).\n- [new] Python 3.4 is now supported.\n- [new] Support for default values in documents with more than one level of\n  data (Javier Gonel).\n- [new] Ability to send entire document in write responses. ``BANDWITH_SAVER``\n  aka Coherence Mode (Josh Villbrandt).\n- [new] ``on_pre_<METHOD>`` events expose the `lookup` dictionary which allows\n  for setting up dynamic database lookups on both resource and item endpoints.\n- [new] Return a 400 response on pymongo DuplicateKeyError, with exception\n  message if debug mode is on (boosh).\n- [new] PyPy officially supported and tested (Javier Gonel).\n- [new] tox support (Javier Gonel).\n- [new] Post database events (Javier Gonel). Addresses #272.\n- [new] Versioned Documents (Josh Villbrandt). Closes #224.\n- [new] Python trove classifiers added to setup.py.\n- [new] Client projections are also honored at item endpoints.\n- [new] validate that ID_FIELD is not set as a resource ``auth_field``.\n  Addresses #266.\n- [new] ``URL_PROTOCOL`` defines the HTTP protocol used when building HATEOAS\n  links. Defaults to ``''`` for relative paths (Junior Vidotti).\n- [new] ``on_delete_item`` and ``on_deleted_item`` is raised on DELETE requests\n  sent to document endpoints. Addresses #232.\n- [new] ``on_delete_resource`` and ``on_deleted_resource`` is raised on DELETE\n  requests sent to resource endpoints. Addresses #232.\n- [new] ``on_update`` is raised on PATCH requests, when a document is about to\n  be updated on the database. Addresses #232.\n- [new] ``on_replace`` is raised on PUT requests, when a document is about to\n  be replaced on the database.

Addresses #378.\n- [change] Events 0.2.1 is now required.\n- [change] MarkupSafe 0.23 is now required.\n- [change] For bulk and non-bulk inserts, response status now always either 201\n  when everything was ok or 400 when something went wrong. For bulk inserts, if\n  at least one document doesn't validate, the whole request is rejected, and\n  none of the documents are inserted into the database. Additionnaly, this\n  commit adopts the same response format as collections: responses are always\n  a dict with a ``_status`` field at its root and an eventual ``_error`` object\n  if ``_status`` is ``ERR`` to comply with #366. Documents status are stored in\n  the ``_items`` field (Olivier Poitrey).\n- [change] Callbacks get whole json response on ``on_fetched``. This allows for\n  callbacks functions to alter the whole payload, even when HATEOAS is enabled\n  and ``_items`` and ``_links`` metafields are present.\n- [change] ``on_insert`` is not raised anymore on PUT requests (replaced by\n  above mentioned ``on_replace``).\n- [change] ``auth.request_auth_value`` is no more. Yay. See below.\n- [change] ``auth.set_request_auth_value()`` allows to set the ``auth_field``\n  value for the current request.\n- [change] ``auth.get_request_auth_value()`` allows to retrieve the\n  ``auth_field`` value for the current request.\n- [change] ``on_update(ed)`` and ``on_replace(ed)`` callbacks now receive both\n  the original document and the updates (Jaroslav Semančík).\n- [change] Review event names (Javier Gonel).\n\n- [fix] return 500 instead of 404 if CORS is enabled. Closes #381.\n- [fix] Crash on GET requests on resource endpoints when ID_FIELD is missing on\n  one or more documents. Closes #351.\n- [fix] Cannot change a nullable objectid type field to contain null. Closes\n  #341.\n- [fix] HATEOAS links as business unit values even when regexes are configured\n  for the endpoint.\n- [fix] Documentation improvements (Jen Montes).\n- [fix] KeyError exception was raised when field specified in schema as\n  embeddable was missing in a particular document (Jaroslav Semančík).\n- [fix] Tests on HEAD requests would very occasionally fail. See #316.\n- [change] PyMongo 2.7.1 is now required.\n- [fix] Automatic fields such as ``DATE_CREATD`` and ``DATE_CREATED`` are\n  correctly handled in client projections (Josh Villbrandt). Closes #282.\n- [fix] Make codebase compliant with latest PEP8/flake8 release (Javier Gonel).\n- [fix] If you had a media field, and set datasource projection to 0 for that\n  field, the media would not be deleted. Closes #284.\n- [fix] tests cleanup (Javier Gonel).\n- [fix] tests now run on any system without needing to set ``ulimit`` to\n  a higher value (Javier Gonel).\n- [fix] media files: don't try to delete a field that does not exist (Taylor\n  Brown).\n- [fix] Occasional KeyError while building ``_media`` helper dict. See #271\n  (Alexander Hendorf).\n- [fix] ``If-Modified-Since`` misbehaviour when a datasource filter is set.\n  Closes #258.\n- [fix] Trouble serializing list of dicts. Closes #265 and #244.\n- [fix] ``HATEOAS`` item links are now coherent actual endpoint URL even when\n  natural immutable keys are used in URLs (Junior Vidotti). Closes #256.\n- [fix] Replaced ``ID_FIELD`` by ``item_lookup_field`` on self link.\n  item_lookup_field will default to ``ID_FIELD`` if blank.\n\nVersion 0.3\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nReleased on 14 February, 2014.\n\n- [fix] Serialization of sub-documents (Hannes Tiede). Closes #244.\n- [new] ``X_MAX_AGE`` allows to configure CORS Access-Control-Max-Age (David\n  Buchmann).\n- [fix] ``GET`` with ``If-Modified-Since`` on list endpoint returns incorrect\n  304 if resource is empty. Closes #243.\n- [change] ``POST`` will return ``201 Created`` if at least one document was\n  accepted for insertion; ``200 OK`` otherwise (meaning the request was\n  accepted and processed). It is still client's responsability to parse the\n  response payload to check if any document did not pass validation. Addresses\n  #201 #202 #215.\n- [new] ``number`` data type. Allows both integers and floats as field values.\n- [fix] Using primary keys other than _id. Closes #237.\n- [fix] Add tests for ``PUT`` when User Restricted Resource Access is active.\n- [fix] Auth field not set if resource level authentication is set. Fixes #231.\n- [fix] RateLimit check was occasionally failing and returning a 429 (John\n  Deng).\n- [change] Jinja2 2.7.2 is now required.\n- [new] media files (images, pdf, etc.) can be uploaded as ``media`` document\n  fields. When a document is requested, eventual media files will be returned\n  as Base64 strings. Upload is done via ``POST``, ``PUT`` and ``PATCH`` using\n  the ``multipart/form-data`` content-type. For optmized performance, by\n  default files are stored in GridFS, however custom ``MediaStorage`` classes\n  can be provided to support alternative storage systems. Clients and API\n  maintainers can exploit the projections feature to include/exclude media\n  fields from requests. For example, a request like\n  ``/url/<id>?projection={\"image\": 0}`` will return the document without the\n  image field. Also, while setting a resource ``datasource`` it is possible to\n  explicitly exclude media fields from standard responses (clients will need to\n  explicitly add them to the payload with ``?projection={\"image\": 1}``).\n- [new] ``media`` type for schema fields.\n- [new] ``media`` application argument. Allows to specify a media storage class\n  to be used to store media files. Defaults to ``GridFSMediaStorage``.\n- [new] ``GridFSMediaStorage`` class. Stores files into GridFS.\n- [new] ``MediaStorage`` class provides a standardized API for storing files,\n  along with a set of default behaviors that all other storage systems can\n  inherit or override as necessary.\n- [new] ``file`` data type support and validation for resource schema.\n- [new] ``multipart/form-data`` content-type is now supported for requests.\n- [fix] Field exclusion (``?projection={\"fieldname\": 0}``) now supported in\n  client projections. Remember, mixing field inclusion and exclusion is still\n  not supported by MongoDB.\n- [fix] ``URL_PREFIX`` and ``API_VERSION`` are correctly reported in HATOEAS\n  links.\n- [fix] ``DELETE`` on sub-resources should only delete documents referenced by\n  the parent. Closes #212.\n- [fix] ``DELETE`` on a resource endpoint honors User-Restricted Resource\n  Access. Closes #213.\n- [new] ``JSON`` allows to enable/disable JSON responses. Defaults to ``True``\n  (JSON enabled).\n- [new] ``XML`` allows to enable/disable XML responses. Defaults to ``True``\n  (XML enabled).\n- [fix] XML properly honors ``_LINKS`` and ``_ITEMS`` settings.\n- [fix] return all document fields when resource schema is empty.\n- [new] pytest.ini for pytest support.\n- [fix] All tests should now run with nose and pytest. Closes #209.\n- [new] ``query_objectid_as_string`` resource setting. Defaults to ``False``.\n  Addresses #207.\n- [new] ``ETAG`` allows to customize the etag field. Defaults to ``_etag``.\n- [change] ``etag`` is now ``_etag`` in all default response payloads (see\n  above).\n- [change] ``STATUS`` defaults to '_status'.\n- [change] ``ISSUES`` defaults to '_issues'.\n- [change] ``DATE_CREATED`` defaults to '_created'. Upgrade existing\n  collections by running ``db.<collection>.update({}, { $rename: { \"created\":\n  \"_created\" } }, { multi: true })`` in the mongo shell. If an index exists on\n  the field, drop it and create a new one using the new field name.\n- [change] ``LAST_UPDATED`` defaults to '_updated'. Upgrade existing\n  collections by running ``db.<collection>.update({}, { $rename: { \"updated\":\n  \"_updated\" } }, { multi: true })`` in the mongo shell. If an index exists on\n  the field, drop it and create a new one usung the new field name.\n- [change] Exclude ``etag`` from both response payload and headers if\n  concurrency control is disabled (``IF_MATCH`` = ``False``). Closes #205.\n- [fix] Custom ``ID_FIELD`` would fail on update/insert methods. Fixes #203\n  (Jaroslav Semančík).\n- [change] GET: when If-Modified-Since header is present, either no documents\n  (304) or all documents (200) are sent per the HTTP spec. Original behavior\n  can be achieved with:\n  ``/resource?where={\"updated\":{\"$gt\":\"if-modified-since-date\"}}`` (Josh\n  Villbrandt).\n- [change] Validation errors are now reported as a dictionary with offending\n  fields as keys and issues descriptions as values.\n- [change] Cerberus v0.6 is now required.\n\nVersion 0.2\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nReleased on 30 November, 2013.\n\n- [new] Sub-Resources. It is now possible to configure endpoints such as:\n  ``/companies/<company_id>/invoices``. Also, the corresponding item endpoints,\n  such as ``/companies/<company_id>/invoices/<invoice_id>``, are available. All\n  CRUD operations on these endpoints are allowed. Closes 156.\n- [new] ``resource_title`` allows to customize the endpoint title (HATEOAS).\n- [new][dev] ``extra`` cursor property, when present, will be added to ``GET``\n  responses (with same key). This feature can be used by Eve extensions to\n  inject proprietary data into the response stream (Petr Jašek).\n- [new] ``IF_MATCH`` allows to disable checks for ETag matches on edit, replace\n  and delete requests. If disabled, requests without an If-Match header will be\n  honored without returning a 403 error. Defaults to True (enabled by default).\n- [new] ``LINKS`` allows to customize the links field. Default to '_links'.\n- [new] ``ITEMS`` allows to customize the items field. Default to '_items'.\n- [new] ``STATUS`` allows to customize the status field. Default to 'status'.\n- [new] ``ISSUES`` allows to customize the issues field. Default to 'issues'.\n- [new] Handling custom ID fields tutorial.\n- [new] A new ``json_encoder`` initialization argument is available. It allows\n  to pass custom JSONEncoder or eve.io.BaseJSONEncoder to the Eve instance.\n- [new] A new ``url_converters`` initialization argument is available. It\n  allows to pass custom Flask url converters to the Eve constructor.\n- [new] ID_FIELD fields can now be of arbitrary types, not only ObjectIds.\n  Thanks to Kelvin Hammond for contributing to this one.  Closes #136.\n- [new] ``pre_<method>`` and ``pre_<method>_<resource>`` event hooks are now\n  available. They are raised when a request is received and before processing\n  it. The resource involved and the Flask request object are returned to the\n  callback function (dccrazyboy).\n- [new] ``embedded_fields`` activates default Embedded Resource Serialization\n  on a list of selected document fields. Eventual embedding requests by clients\n  will be processed along with default embedding. In order for default\n  embedding to work, the field must be defined as embeddable, and embedding\n  must be active for the resource (with help from Christoph Witzany).\n- [new] ``default_sort`` option added to the ``datasource`` resource setting.\n  It allows to set default sorting for the endpoint. Default sorting will be\n  overriden by a client request that happens to include a ``?sort`` argument\n  within the query string (with help from Christoph Witzany).\n- [new] You can now choose to provide custom settings as a Python dictionary.\n- [new] New method ``Eve.register_resource()`` for registering new resource\n  after initialization of Eve object. This is needed for simpler initialization\n  API of all ORM/ODM extensions (Stanislav Heller).\n- [change] Rely on Flask endpoints to map urls to resources.\n- [change] For better consistency with new ``pre_<method>`` hooks,\n  ``on_<method>`` event hooks have been renamed to ``on_post_<method>``.\n- [change] Custom authentication classes can now be set at endpoint level. When\n  set, an endpoint-level auth class will override the eventual global level\n  auth class.  Authentication docs have been updated (and greatly revised)\n  accordingly.  Closes #89.\n- [change] JSON encoding is now handled at the DataLayer level allowing for\n  specialized, granular, data-aware encoding. Also, since the JSON encoder is\n  now a class attribute, extensions can replace the pre-defined data layer\n  encoder with their own implementation. Closes #102.\n- [fix] HMAC example and docs updated to align with new hmac in Python 2.7.3,\n  which is only accepting bytes string. Closes #199.\n- [fix] Properly escape leaf values in XML responses (Florian Rathgeber).\n- [fix] A read-only field with a default value would trigger a validation error\n  on POST and PUT methods.\n\nVersion 0.1.1\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nReleased on October 31th, 2013.\n\n- DELETE now uses the original document ID_FIELD when issuing the delete\n  command to the underlying data layer (Xavi Cubillas).\n- Embedded Resource Serialization also available at item endpoints\n  (``/invoices/<id>/?embedded={'person':1}``),\n- ``collection`` (used when setting up a data relation, see Embedded Resource\n  Serialization) has been renamed to ``resource`` in order to avoid confusion\n  between the Eve schema and underlying MongoDB collections.\n- Nested endpoints. Endpoints with deep paths like ``/contacts/overseas`` can\n  now function in conjuction with top-level endpoints (``/contacts``).\n  Endpoints are completely independent: each can allow item lookups\n  (``/contacts/<id>`` and ``contacts/overseas/<id>``) and different access\n  methods. Previously, while you could have complex urls, you could not get\n  nested endpoints to work properly.\n- PyMongo 2.6.3 is now supported.\n- item-id wrappers have been removed from POST/PATCH/PUT requests and\n  responses. Requests for single document insertion/edition are now performed\n  by just submitting the relevant document. Bulk insert requests are performed\n  by submitting a list of documents. The response to bulk requests is a list\n  itself in which every list item contains the state of the corresponding\n  request document. Please note that this is a breaking change. Also be aware\n  that when the request content-type is ``x-www-form-urlencoded``, single\n  document insert is performed. Closes #139.\n- ObjectId are properly serialized on POST/PATCH/PUT methods.\n- Queries on ObjectId and datetime values in nested documents.\n- ``auth.user_id`` renamed to ``auth.request_auth_value`` for better\n  consistency with the ``auth_field`` setting. Closes #132 (Ryan Shea).\n- Same behavior as Flask, SERVER_NAME now defaults to None. It allows much\n  easier development on distant machine that may changes IP (Ronan Delacroix).\n\n- CORS support was not available for ``additional_lookup`` urls (Petr Jašek.)\n- 'default' field values that could be assimilated to ``None`` (0, None, \"\")\n  would be ignored.\n- POST and PUT would fail with 400 if there was no auth class while\n  ``auth_field`` was set for a resource.\n- Fix order of string arguments in exception message in\n  flaskapp.validate_schema() (Roy Smith).\n\nVersion 0.1\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nReleased on September 30th, 2013.\n\n- ``PUT`` method for completely replace a document while keeping the same\n  unique identifier. Closes #96.\n- Embedded Resource Serialization. If a document field is referencing\n  a document in another resource, clients can request the referenced document\n  to be embedded within the requested document (Bryan Cattle).  Closes #68.\n- \"No trailing slash\" URLs are now supported. Closes #118.\n- HATEOAS is now optional and can be disabled both at global and resource\n  level.\n- ``X-HTTP-Method-Override`` supported for all HTTP Methods. Closes #95.\n- HTTP method is now passed into ``authenticate()`` and ``check_auth()`` (Ken\n  Carpenter). Closes #90 .\n- Cleanup and hardening of User-Restricted Resource Access Edit (Bryan Cattle).\n- Account Management tutorial updated to reflect the event hooks naming update\n  introduced in v0.0.9.\n- Some more Python 3 refactoring (Dong Wei Ming).\n- Events 0.2.0 is now supported.\n- PyMongo 2.6.2 is now supported.\n- Cerberus 0.4.0 is now supported.\n\n- Item ``GET`` on documents with non-existent 'created' field (because\n  stored outside of API context) were not returning a default value for the\n  field.\n- Edits on documents with non-existent 'created' or 'updated' fields\n  (because stored outside of the API context) were returning ``412 Precondition\n  Failed``. Closes #123.\n- ``on_insert`` is raised when a ``PUT`` (replace action) is about to be\n  performed. Closes #120.\n- Installation on Windows with Python 3 was returning encoding errors.\n- Fixed #99: malformed XML render when href includes forbidden URI/URL chars.\n- Fixed a bug introduced with 0.0.9 and Python 3 support. Filters (``?where``)\n  on datetime values were not working when running on Python 2.x.\n- Fixed some typos and minor grammatical errors all across the documentation\n  (Ken Carpenter, Jean Boussier, Kracekumar, Francisco Corrales Morales).\n\nVersion 0.0.9\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nReleased on August 29, 2013\n\n- PyMongo 2.6 is now supported.\n- ``FILTERS`` boolean replaced by ``ALLOWED_FILTERS`` list which allows for\n  explicit whitelisting of filter-enabled fields (Bryan Cattle). Closes #78.\n- Custom user ids for User-Restricted Resource Access, allowing for more\n  flexibility and token revocation with token-based authentication. Closes #73.\n- ``AUTH_USERNAME_FIELD`` renamed to ``AUTH_FIELD``.\n- ``auth_username_field`` renamed to ``auth_field``.\n- BasicAuth and subclasses now support ``user_id`` property.\n- Updated the event hooks naming system to be more robuts and consistent.\n  Closes #80.\n- To emphasize the fact that they are tied to a method, all ``on_<method>``\n  hooks now have ``<method>`` in uppercase.\n- ``on_getting`` hook renamed to ``on_fetch_resource``.\n- ``on_getting_<resource>`` hook renamed to ``on_fetch_resource_<resource>``\n- ``on_getting_item`` hook renamed to ``on_fetch_item``.\n- ``on_getting_item_<item_title>`` hook renamed to\n  ``on_fetch_item_<item_title>``.\n- ``on_posting`` hook renamed to ``on_insert``.\n- Datasource  projections always include automatic fields (``ID_FIELD``,\n  ``LAST_UPDATED``, ``DATE_CREATED``). Closes #85.\n- Public HTTP methods now override `auth_username_field` Edit. Closes #70\n  (Bryan Cattle).\n- Response date fields are now using GMT instead of UTC. Closes #83.\n- Handle the case of 'additional_lookup' field being an integer. If this is the\n  case you can omit the 'url' key, as it will be ignored, and the integer value\n  correctly parsed.\n- More informative HTTP error messages. Some more informative error messages\n  have been added for HTTP 400/3/12 and 500 errors. The error messages only\n  show if DEBUG==True (Bryan Cattle).\n- ``on_getting(resource, documents)`` is now ``on_getting_resource(resource,\n  documents)``; ``on_getting_<resource>(documents) is now known as\n  ``on_getting_resource_<resource>(documents)`` (Ryan Shea).\n- Added a new event hook: ``on_getting_item_<title>(_id, document)`` (Ryan\n  Shea).\n- Allow ``auth_username_field`` to be set to ``ID_FIELD`` (Bryan Cattle).\n- Python 3.3 is now supported.\n- Flask 0.10.1 is now supported.\n- Werkzeug 0.9.4 is now supported.\n- Copyright finally updated to 2013.\n\nVersion 0.0.8\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nReleased on July 25th 2013.\n\n- Only run RateLimiting tests if redis-py is installed and redis-server is\n  running.\n- CORS ``Access-Control-Allow-Headers`` header support (Garrin Kimmell).\n- CORS ``OPTIONS`` support for resource and items endpoints (Garrin Kimmell).\n- ``float`` is now available as a data-type in the schema definition ruleset.\n- ``nullable`` field schema rule is now available. If ``True`` the field value\n  can be set to null. Defaults to ``False``.\n- v0.3.0 of Cerberus is now a requirement.\n- ``on_getting``, ``on_getting_<resource>`` and ``on_getting_item`` event\n  hooks. These events are raised when documents have just been read from the\n  database and are about to be sent to the client. Registered callback\n  functions can eventually manipulate the documents as needed. Please be aware\n  that ``last_modified`` and ``etag`` headers will always be consistent with\n  the state of the documents on the database (they  won't be updated to reflect\n  changes eventually applied by the callback functions). Closes #65.\n- Documentation fix: ``AUTH_USERFIELD_NAME`` renamed to ``AUTH_USERNAME_FIELD``\n  (Julien Barbot).\n- Responses to GET requests for resource endpoints now include a ``last`` item\n  in the `_links` dictionary. The value is a link to the last page available.\n  The item itself is only provided if pagination is enabled and the page being\n  requested isn't the last one. Closes #62.\n- It is now possible to set the MongoDB write concern level at both global\n  (``MONGO_WRITE_CONCERN``) and endpoint (``mongo_write_concern``) levels. The\n  value is a dictionary with all valid MongoDB write_concern settings (w,\n  wtimeout, j and fsync) as keys. ``{'w': 1}`` is the default, which is also\n  MongoDB's default setting.\n- ``TestMininal`` class added to the test suite. This will allow to start the\n  building of the tests for an application based on Eve, by subclassing the\n  TestMinimal class (Daniele Pizzolli).\n\nVersion 0.0.7\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nReleased on June 18th 2013.\n\n- Pinned Werkzeug requirement to v0.8.3 to avoid issues with the latest release\n  which breaks backward compatibility (actually a Flask 0.9 requirements issue,\n  which backtracked to Eve).\n- Support for Rate Limiting on all HTTP methods. Closes #58. Please note: to\n  successfully execute the tests in 'eve.tests.methods.ratelimit.py`, a running\n  redis server is needed.\n- ``utils.request_method`` internal helper function added, which allowed  for\n  some nice code cleanup (DRY).\n- Setting the default 'field' value would not happen if a 'data_relation' was\n  nested deeper than the first schema level. Fixes #60.\n- Support for ``EXTRA_RESPONSE_FIELDS``. It is now possible to configure a list\n  of additonal document fields that should be provided with POST responses.\n  Normally only automatically handled fields (``ID_FIELD``, ``LAST_UPDATED``,\n  ``DATE_CREATED``, ``etag``) are included in POST payloads.\n  ``EXTRA_RESPONSE_FIELDS`` is a global setting that will apply to all resource\n  endpoint . Defaults to ``[]``, effectively disabling the feature.\n  ``extra_response_fields`` is a local resource setting and will override\n  ``EXTRA_RESPONSE_FIELDS`` when present.\n- ``on_posting`` and ``on_posting_<resource>`` event hooks. ``on_posting`` and\n  ``on_posting_<resource>`` events are raised when documents are about to be\n  stored. Among other things this allows callback functions to arbitrarily\n  update the documents being inserted. ``on_posting(resource, documents)`` is\n  raised on every successful POST while ``on_posting_<resource>(documents)`` is\n  only raised when <resource> is being updated. In both circumstances events\n  will be raised only if at least one document passed validation and is going\n  to be inserted.\n- Flask native ``request.json`` is now used when decoding request payloads.\n- *resource* argument added to Authorization classes. The ``check_auth()``\n  method of all classes in the ``eve.auth`` package (``BasicAuth``,\n  ``HMACAuth``, ``TokenAuth``) now supports the *resource* argument. This\n  allows subclasses to eventually build their custom authorization logic around\n  the resource being accessed.\n- ``MONGO_QUERY_BLACKLIST`` option added. Allows to blacklist mongo query\n  operators that should not be allowed in resource queries (``?where=``).\n  Defaults to ['$where', '$regex']. Mongo Javascript operators are disabled by\n  default as they might be used as vectors for injection attacks. Javascript\n  queries also tend to be slow and generally can be easily replaced with the\n  (very rich) Mongo query dialect.\n- ``MONGO_HOST`` defaults to 'localhost'.\n- ``MONGO_PORT`` defaults to 27017.\n- Support alternative hosts/ports for the test suite (Paul Doucet).\n\nVersion 0.0.6\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nReleased on May 13th 2013.\n\n- Content-Type header now properly parsed when additional arguments are\n  included (Ondrej Slinták).\n- Only fields defined in the resource schema are now returned from the\n  database. Closes #52.\n- Default ``SERVER_NAME`` is now set to ``127.0.0.1:5000``.\n- ``auth_username_field`` is honored even when there is no query in the request\n  (Thomas Sileo).\n- Pagination links in XML payloads are now properly escaped. Fixes #49.\n- HEAD requests supported. Closes #48.\n- Event Hooks. Each time a GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE method has been executed,\n  both global ``on_<method>`` and resource-level ``on_<method>_<resource>``\n  events will be raised. You can subscribe to these events with multiple\n  callback functions. Callbacks will receive the original flask.request object\n  and the response payload as arguments.\n- Proper ``max_results`` handling in ``eve.utils.parse_request``, refactored\n  tests (Tomasz Jezierski).\n- Projections. Projections are conditional queries where the client dictates\n  which fields should be returned by the API (Nicolas Bazire).\n- ``ALLOW_UNKNOWN`` option, and the corresponding ``allow_options`` local\n  setting, allow for a less strict schema validation. Closes #34.\n- ETags are now provided with POST responses. Closes #36.\n- PATCH performance improvement: ETag is now computed in memory; performing an\n  extra database lookup is not needed anymore.\n- Bulk Inserts on the database. POST method heavily refactored to take\n  advantage of MongoDB native support for Bulk Inserts. Please note: validation\n  constraints are checked against the database, and not between the payload\n  documents themselves. This causes an interesting corner case: in the event of\n  a multiple documents payload where two or more documents carry the same value\n  for a field where the ``unique`` constraint is set, the payload will validate\n  successfully, as there are no duplicates in the database (yet). If this is an\n  issue, the client can always send the documents once at a time for insertion,\n  or validate locally before submitting the payload to the API.\n- Responses to document GET requests now include the ETag in both the header\n  and the payload. Closes #29.\n- ``methods`` settings keyword renamed to ``resource_methods`` for coherence\n  with the global ``RESOURCE_METHODS`` (Nicolas Carlier).\n\nVersion 0.0.5\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nReleased on April 11th 2013.\n\n- Fixed an issue that apparently caused the test suite to only run successfully\n  on the dev box. Thanks Chronidev for reporting this.\n- Referential integrity validation via the new ``data_relation`` schema\n  keyword.  Closes #25.\n- Support for ``Content-Type: application/json`` for POST and PATCH methods.\n  Closes #28.\n- User-restricted resource access. Works in conjunction with Authentication.\n  When enabled, users can only read/update/delete resource items created by\n  themselves. Can be switched on and off at global level via the\n  ``AUTH_USERFIELD_NAME`` keywork, or at single resource endpoints with the\n  user_userfield_name keyword (the latter will override the former). The\n  keyword contains the actual name of the field used to store the username of\n  the user who created the resource item. Defaults to '', which disables the\n  feature (Thomas Sileo).\n- ``PAGING_LIMIT`` keyword setting renamed to ``PAGINATION_LIMIT`` for better\n  coherency with the new ``PAGINATION`` keyword. This could break backward\n  compatibility in some cases.\n- ``PAGING_DEFAULT`` keyword settings renamed to ``PAGINATION_DEFAULT`` for\n  better coherence with the new ``PAGINATION`` keyword. This could break\n  backward compatibility in some cases.\n- ``ITEM_CACHE_CONTROL`` removed as it seems unnecessary at the moment.\n- Added an example on how to handle events to perform custom actions. Closes\n  #23 and #22.\n- ``eve.validation_schema()`` now collects offending items and returns all of\n  them into the exception message. Closes #24.\n- Filters (``?where=``), sorting (``?sort=``) and pagination (``?page=10``) can\n  now be be disabled at both global and endpoint level. Closes #7.\n- CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) support. The new ``X-DOMAINS`` keywords\n  allows API maintainers to specify which domains are allowed to perform CORS\n  requests. Allowed values are: None, a list of domains, or '*' for a wide-open\n  API. Closes #1.\n- HMAC (Hash Message Authentication Code) based Autentication.\n- Token Based Authentication, a variation of Basic Authentication. Closes #20.\n- Orphan function removed (``eve.methods.get.standard_links`` ).\n- ``DATE_CREATED`` and ``LAST_UPDATED`` fields now show default values for\n  documents created outside the API context. Fixes #18.\n\nVersion 0.0.4\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nReleased on February 25th 2013.\n\n- Consistent ETag computation between runs/instances. Closes #16.\n- Support for Basic Authentication (RFC2617).\n- Support for fine-tuning authentication with ``PUBLIC_METHODS`` and\n  ``PUBLIC_ITEM_METHODS``. By default, access is restricted to *all* endpoints,\n  for *all* HTTP verbs (methods), effectively locking down the whole API.\n- Supporto for role-based access control with ``ALLOWED_ROLES`` and\n  ``allowed_roles``.\n- Support for all standard Flask initialization parameters.\n- Support for default values in resource fields. The new ``default`` keyword\n  can now be used when defining a field rule set.  Please note: currently\n  default values are supported only for main document fields. Default values\n  for fields in embedded documents will be ignored.\n- Multiple API endpoints can now target the same database collection. For\n  example now you can set both ``/admins/`` and ``/users/`` to read and write\n  from the same collection on the db, *people*.  The new ``datasource`` setting\n  allows to explicitly link API resources to database collections. It is\n  a dictionary with two allowed keys: *source* and *filter*. *source* dictates\n  the database collection consumed by the resource.  *filter* is the underlying\n  query, applied by the API when retrieving and validating data for the\n  resource.  Previously, the resource name would dictate the linked datasource\n  (and of course you could not have two resources with the same name). This\n  remains the default behaviour: if you omit the ``datasource`` setting for\n  a resource, its name will be used to determine the database collection.\n- It is now possibile to set predefined db filters for each resource.\n  Predefined filters run on top of user queries (GET requests with ``where``\n  clauses) and standard conditional requests (``If-Modified-Since``, etc.)\n  Please note that datasource filters are applied on GET, PATCH and DELETE\n  requests. If your resource allows for POST requests (document insertions),\n  then you will probably want to set the validation rules accordingly (in our\n  example, 'username' should probably be a required field).\n- JSON-Datetime dependency removed.\n- Support for Cerberus v0.0.3 and later.\n- Support for Flask-PyMongo v0.2.0 and later.\n- Repeated XML requests to the same endpoint could occasionally return an\n  Internal Server Error (Fixes #8).\n\nVersion 0.0.3\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nReleased on January 22th 2013.\n\n- XML rendering love. Lots of love.\n- JSON links are always wrapped in a ``_links`` dictionary. Key values match\n  the relation between the item being represented and the linked resource.\n- Streamlined JSON responses. Superflous ``response`` root key has been removed\n  from JSON payloads. GET requests to resource endpoints: items are now wrapped\n  with an ``_items`` list. GET requests to item endpoints: item is now at root\n  level, with no wrappers around it.\n- Support for API versioning through the new API_VERSION configuration setting.\n- Boolean values in request forms are now correctly parsed.\n- Tests now run under Python 2.6.\n\n\nVersion 0.0.2\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nReleased on November 27th 2012.\n\n- Homepage/api entry point resource links fixed. They had bad 'href'\n  tags which also caused XML validation issues when processing responses\n  (especially when accessing the API via browser).\n- Version number in 'Server' response headers.\n- Added support for DELETE at resource endpoints. Expected behavior:\n  will delete all items in the collection. Disabled by default.\n- :class:`eve.io.mongo.Validator` now supports :class:`~cerberus.Validator`\n  signature, allowing for further subclassing.\n\nVersion 0.0.1\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nReleased on November 20th 2012.\n\n- First public preview release.\n"

No problem!\nThere are many ways to contribute to open source projects: reporting bugs,\nhelping with the documentation, spreading the word and of course, adding\nnew features and patches.\n\nSupport questions\n-----------------\n\nPlease, don't use the issue tracker for this. Use one of the following\nresources for questions about your own code:\n\n* Ask on `Stack Overflow`_. Search with Google first using: ``site:stackoverflow.com eve {search term, exception message, etc.}``\n* The `mailing list`_ is intended to be a low traffic resource for both developers/contributors and API maintainers looking for help or requesting feedback.\n* The IRC channel ``#python-eve`` on FreeNode.\n\n.. _Stack Overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/eve?sort=linked\n.. _`mailing list`: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/python-eve\n\nReporting issues\n----------------\n\n- Describe what you expected to happen.\n- If possible, include a `minimal, complete, and verifiable example`_ to help\n  us identify the issue. This also helps check that the issue is not with your\n  own code.\n- Describe what actually happened. Include the full traceback if there was an\n  exception.\n- List your Python and Eve versions. If possible, check if this issue is\n  already fixed in the repository.\n\n.. _minimal, complete, and verifiable example: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\n\nSubmitting patches\n------------------\n\n- Include tests if your patch is supposed to solve a bug, and explain\n  clearly under which circumstances the bug happens. Make sure the test fails\n  without your patch.\n- Enable and install pre-commit_ to ensure styleguides and codechecks are\n  followed. CI will reject a change that does not conform to the guidelines.\n\n.. _pre-commit: https://pre-commit.com/\n\nFirst time setup\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Download and install the `latest version of git`_.\n- Configure git with your `username`_ and `email`_::\n\n        git config --global user.name 'your name'\n        git config --global user.email 'your email'\n\n- Make sure you have a `GitHub account`_.\n- Fork Eve to your GitHub account by clicking the `Fork`_ button.\n- `Clone`_ your GitHub fork locally::\n\n        git clone https://github.com/{username}/eve\n        cd eve\n\n- Add the main repository as a remote to update later::\n\n        git remote add pyeve https://github.com/pyeve/eve\n        git fetch pyeve\n\n- Create a virtualenv::\n\n        python3 -m venv env\n        . env/bin/activate\n        # or \"env\\Scripts\\activate\" on Windows\n\n- Install Eve in editable mode with development dependencies::\n\n        pip install -e \".[dev]\"\n\n- Install pre-commit_ and then activate its hooks. pre-commit is a framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks. Eve uses pre-commit to ensure code-style and code formatting is the same::\n\n    $ pip install --user pre-commit\n    $ pre-commit install\n\n  Afterwards, pre-commit will run whenever you commit.\n\n\n.. _GitHub account: https://github.com/join\n.. _latest version of git: https://git-scm.com/downloads\n.. _username: https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-username-in-git/\n.. _email: https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git/\n.. _Fork: https://github.com/pyeve/eve/fork\n.. _Clone: https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/#step-2-create-a-local-clone-of-your-fork\n\nStart coding\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Create a branch to identify the issue you would like to work on (e.g.\n  ``fix_for_#1280``)\n- Using your favorite editor, make your changes, `committing as you go`_.\n- Follow `PEP8`_.\n- Include tests that cover any code changes you make. Make sure the test fails\n  without your patch. `Run the tests. <contributing-testsuite_>`_.\n- Push your commits to GitHub and `create a pull request`_.\n- Celebrate 🎉\n\n.. _committing as you go: http://dont-be-afraid-to-commit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/commandlinegit.html#commit-your-changes\n.. _PEP8: https://pep8.org/\n.. _create a pull request: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/\n\n.. _contributing-testsuite:\n\nRunning the tests\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nYou should have Python 3.9+  available in your system. Now\nrunning tests is as simple as issuing this command::\n\n    $ tox -e linting,py310,py39\n\nThis command will run tests via the \"tox\" tool against Python 3.10 and 3.9 and\nalso perform \"lint\" coding-style checks.\n\nYou can pass different options to ``tox``. For example, to run tests on Python\n3.10 and pass options to pytest (e.g. enter pdb on failure) to pytest you can\ndo::\n\n    $ tox -e py310 -- --pdb\n\nOr to only run tests in a particular test module on Python 3.6::\n\n    $ tox -e py310 -- -k TestGet\n\nCI will run the full suite when you submit your pull request. The full\ntest suite takes a long time to run because it tests multiple combinations of\nPython and dependencies. You need to have Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 and PyPy\ninstalled to run all of the environments. Then run::\n\n    tox\n\nPlease note that you need an active MongoDB instance running on localhost in\norder for the tests run. Save yourself some time and headache by creating a\nMongoDB user with the password defined in the `test_settings.py` file in the\nadmin database (the pre-commit process is unforgiving if you don't want to\ncommit your admin credentials but still have the file modified, which would be\nnecessary for tox). If you want to run a local MongoDB instance along with an\nSSH tunnel to a remote instance, if you can, have the local use the default\nport and the remote use some other port. If you can't, fixing the tests that\nwon't play nicely is probably more trouble than connecting to the remote and\nlocal instances one at a time. Also, be advised that in order to execute the\n:ref:`ratelimiting` tests you need a running Redis_ server. The Rate-Limiting\ntests are silently skipped if any of the two conditions are not met.\n\nBuilding the docs\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nBuild the docs in the ``docs`` directory using Sphinx::\n\n    cd docs\n    make html\n\nOpen ``_build/html/index.html`` in your browser to view the docs.\n\nRead more about `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_.\n\nmake targets\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\nEve provides a ``Makefile`` with various shortcuts. They will ensure that\nall dependencies are installed.\n\n- ``make test`` runs the basic test suite with ``pytest``\n- ``make test-all`` runs the full test suite with ``tox``\n- ``make docs`` builds the HTML documentation\n- ``make check`` performs some checks on the package\n- ``make install-dev`` install Eve in editable mode with all development dependencies.\n\nFirst time contributor?\n-----------------------\nIt's alright. We've all been there. See next chapter.\n\nDon't know where to start?\n--------------------------\nThere are usually several TODO comments scattered around the codebase, maybe\ncheck them out and see if you have ideas, or can help with them. Also, check\nthe `open issues`_ in case there's something that sparks your interest. And\nwhat about documentation? I suck at English, so if you're fluent with it (or\nnotice any typo and/or mistake), why not help with that? In any case, other\nthan GitHub help_ pages, you might want to check this excellent `Effective\nGuide to Pull Requests`_\n\n.. _`the repository`: http://github.com/pyeve/eve\n.. _AUTHORS: https://github.com/pyeve/eve/blob/master/AUTHORS\n.. _`open issues`: https://github.com/pyeve/eve/issues\n.. _`new issue`: https://github.com/pyeve/eve/issues/new\n.. _GitHub: https://github.com/\n.. _`proper format`: http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html\n.. _flake8: http://flake8.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\n.. _tox: http://tox.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\n.. _help: https://help.github.com/\n.. _`Effective Guide to Pull Requests`: http://codeinthehole.com/writing/pull-requests-and-other-good-practices-for-teams-using-github/\n.. _`fork and edit`: https://github.com/blog/844-forking-with-the-edit-button\n.. _`Pull Request`: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request\n.. _`running the tests`: http://python-eve.org/testing#running-the-tests\n.. _Redis: https://redis.io\n"
