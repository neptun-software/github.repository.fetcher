If possible, encrypt your message with our PGP key; please download it from the [Microsoft Security Response Center PGP Key page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/pgp-key-msrc).\n\nYou should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message. Additional information can be found at [microsoft.com/msrc](https://www.microsoft.com/msrc). \n\nPlease include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:\n\n  * Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)\n  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue\n  * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)\n  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue\n  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue\n  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)\n  * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue\n\nThis information will help us triage your report more quickly.\n\nIf you are reporting for a bug bounty, more complete reports can contribute to a higher bounty award. Please visit our [Microsoft Bug Bounty Program](https://microsoft.com/msrc/bounty) page for more details about our active programs.\n\n## Preferred Languages\n\nWe prefer all communications to be in English.\n\n## Policy\n\nMicrosoft follows the principle of [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/cvd).\n\n<!-- END MICROSOFT SECURITY.MD BLOCK -->"
