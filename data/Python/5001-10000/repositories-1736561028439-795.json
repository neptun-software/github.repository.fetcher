This re-implementation serves as a proof of concept and is not intended for reproduction of the results reported in [1].\n\nThis implementation makes use of the Cora dataset from [2].\n\n## Installation\n\n```python setup.py install```\n\n## Requirements\n\n  * PyTorch 0.4 or 0.5\n  * Python 2.7 or 3.6\n\n## Usage\n\n```python train.py```\n\n## References\n\n[1] [Kipf & Welling, Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks, 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907)\n\n[2] [Sen et al., Collective Classification in Network Data, AI Magazine 2008](http://linqs.cs.umd.edu/projects/projects/lbc/)\n\n## Cite\n\nPlease cite our paper if you use this code in your own work:\n\n```\n@article{kipf2016semi,\n  title={Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks},\n  author={Kipf, Thomas N and Welling, Max},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.02907},\n  year={2016}\n}\n```\n"
