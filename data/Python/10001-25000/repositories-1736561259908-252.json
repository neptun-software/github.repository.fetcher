          "content": "# Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs)\n\n> **_ATTENTION_**: The EIPs repository has recently [undergone](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/7206) a separation of ERCs and EIPs. ERCs are now accessible at [https://github.com/ethereum/ercs](https://github.com/ethereum/ercs). All new ERCs and updates to existing ones must be directed at this new repository. The editors apologize for this inconvenience.\n\nThe goal of the EIP project is to standardize and provide high-quality documentation for Ethereum itself and conventions built upon it. This repository tracks past and ongoing improvements to Ethereum in the form of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs). [EIP-1](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1) governs how EIPs are published.\n\nThe [status page](https://eips.ethereum.org/) tracks and lists EIPs, which can be divided into the following categories:\n\n- [Core EIPs](https://eips.ethereum.org/core) are improvements to the Ethereum consensus protocol.\n- [Networking EIPs](https://eips.ethereum.org/networking) specify the peer-to-peer networking layer of Ethereum.\n- [Interface EIPs](https://eips.ethereum.org/interface) standardize interfaces to Ethereum, which determine how users and applications interact with the blockchain.\n- [ERCs](https://eips.ethereum.org/erc) specify application layer standards, which determine how applications running on Ethereum can interact with each other.\n- [Meta EIPs](https://eips.ethereum.org/meta) are miscellaneous improvements that nonetheless require some sort of consensus.\n- [Informational EIPs](https://eips.ethereum.org/informational) are non-standard improvements that do not require any form of consensus.\n\n**Before you write an EIP, ideas MUST be thoroughly discussed on [Ethereum Magicians](https://ethereum-magicians.org/) or [Ethereum Research](https://ethresear.ch/t/read-this-before-posting/8). Once consensus is reached, thoroughly read and review [EIP-1](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1), which describes the EIP process.**\n\nPlease note that this repository is for documenting standards and not for help implementing them. These types of inquiries should be directed to the [Ethereum Stack Exchange](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com). For specific questions and concerns regarding EIPs, it's best to comment on the relevant discussion thread of the EIP denoted by the `discussions-to` tag in the EIP's preamble.\n\nIf you would like to become an EIP Editor, please read [EIP-5069](./EIPS/eip-5069.md).\n\n## Preferred Citation Format\n\nThe canonical URL for an EIP that has achieved draft status at any point is at <https://eips.ethereum.org/>. For example, the canonical URL for EIP-1 is <https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1>.\n\nConsider any document not published at <https://eips.ethereum.org/> as a working paper. Additionally, consider published EIPs with a status of \"draft\", \"review\", or \"last call\" to be incomplete drafts, and note that their specification is likely to be subject to change.\n\n## Validation and Automerging\n\nAll pull requests in this repository must pass automated checks before they can be automatically merged:\n\n- [eip-review-bot](https://github.com/ethereum/eip-review-bot/) determines when PRs can be automatically merged [^1]\n- EIP-1 rules are enforced using [`eipw`](https://github.com/ethereum/eipw)[^2]\n- HTML formatting and broken links are enforced using [HTMLProofer](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer)[^2]\n- Spelling is enforced with [CodeSpell](https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell)[^2]\n  - False positives sometimes occur. When this happens, please submit a PR editing [.codespell-whitelist](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/config/.codespell-whitelist) and **ONLY** .codespell-whitelist\n- Markdown best practices are checked using [markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint)[^2]\n\n[^1]: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/.github/workflows/auto-review-bot.yml\n[^2]: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci.yml\n\nIt is possible to run the EIP validator locally:\n\n```sh\ncargo install eipv\neipv <INPUT FILE / DIRECTORY>\n```\n\n## Build the status page locally\n\n### Install prerequisites\n\n1. Open Terminal.\n\n2. Check whether you have Ruby 3.1.4 installed. Later [versions are not supported](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14351272/undefined-method-exists-for-fileclass-nomethoderror).\n\n   ```sh\n   ruby --version\n   ```\n\n3. If you don't have Ruby installed, install Ruby 3.1.4.\n\n4. Install Bundler:\n\n   ```sh\n   gem install bundler\n   ```\n\n5. Install dependencies:\n\n   ```sh\n   bundle install\n   ```\n\n### Build your local Jekyll site\n\n1. Bundle assets and start the server:\n\n   ```sh\n   bundle exec jekyll serve\n   ```\n\n2. Preview your local Jekyll site in your web browser at `http://localhost:4000`.\n\nMore information on Jekyll and GitHub Pages [here](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.14/user/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll).\n"

After you have filled in the requisite fields, please delete these comments.\n\n  Note that an EIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your EIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `eip-draft_title_abbrev.md`.\n\n  The title should be 44 characters or less. It should not repeat the EIP number in title, irrespective of the category.\n\n  TODO: Remove this comment before submitting\n-->\n\n## Abstract\n\n<!--\n  The Abstract is a multi-sentence (short paragraph) technical summary. This should be a very terse and human-readable version of the specification section. Someone should be able to read only the abstract to get the gist of what this specification does.\n\n  TODO: Remove this comment before submitting\n-->\n\n## Motivation\n\n<!--\n  This section is optional.\n\n  The motivation section should include a description of any nontrivial problems the EIP solves. It should not describe how the EIP solves those problems, unless it is not immediately obvious. It should not describe why the EIP should be made into a standard, unless it is not immediately obvious.\n\n  With a few exceptions, external links are not allowed. If you feel that a particular resource would demonstrate a compelling case for your EIP, then save it as a printer-friendly PDF, put it in the assets folder, and link to that copy.\n\n  TODO: Remove this comment before submitting\n-->\n\n## Specification\n\n<!--\n  The Specification section should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Ethereum platforms (besu, erigon, ethereumjs, go-ethereum, nethermind, or others).\n\n  It is recommended to follow RFC 2119 and RFC 8170. Do not remove the key word definitions if RFC 2119 and RFC 8170 are followed.\n\n  TODO: Remove this comment before submitting\n-->\n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.\n\n## Rationale\n\n<!--\n  The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages.\n\n  The current placeholder is acceptable for a draft.\n\n  TODO: Remove this comment before submitting\n-->\n\nTBD\n\n## Backwards Compatibility\n\n<!--\n\n  This section is optional.\n\n  All EIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The EIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. EIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.\n\n  The current placeholder is acceptable for a draft.\n\n  TODO: Remove this comment before submitting\n-->\n\nNo backward compatibility issues found.\n\n## Test Cases\n\n<!--\n  This section is optional for non-Core EIPs.\n\n  The Test Cases section should include expected input/output pairs, but may include a succinct set of executable tests. It should not include project build files. No new requirements may be introduced here (meaning an implementation following only the Specification section should pass all tests here.)\n  If the test suite is too large to reasonably be included inline, then consider adding it as one or more files in `../assets/eip-####/`. External links will not be allowed\n\n  TODO: Remove this comment before submitting\n-->\n\n## Reference Implementation\n\n<!--\n  This section is optional.\n\n  The Reference Implementation section should include a minimal implementation that assists in understanding or implementing this specification. It should not include project build files. The reference implementation is not a replacement for the Specification section, and the proposal should still be understandable without it.\n  If the reference implementation is too large to reasonably be included inline, then consider adding it as one or more files in `../assets/eip-####/`. External links will not be allowed.\n\n  TODO: Remove this comment before submitting\n-->\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n<!--\n  All EIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. For example, include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. EIP submissions missing the \"Security Considerations\" section will be rejected. An EIP cannot proceed to status \"Final\" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.\n\n  The current placeholder is acceptable for a draft.\n\n  TODO: Remove this comment before submitting\n-->\n\nNeeds discussion.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](../LICENSE.md).\n"

Network upgrades are discussed separately in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/pm/\">Ethereum Project Management</a> repository.</p>\n\n<h2>Contributing</h2>\n<p>First review <a href=\"EIPS/eip-1\">EIP-1</a>. Then clone the repository and add your EIP to it. There is a <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/eip-template.md?plain=1\">template EIP here</a>. Then submit a Pull Request to Ethereum's <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs\">EIPs repository</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>EIP status terms</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Idea</strong> - An idea that is pre-draft. This is not tracked within the EIP Repository.\n  <li><strong>Draft</strong> - The first formally tracked stage of an EIP in development. An EIP is merged by an EIP Editor into the EIP repository when properly formatted.</li>\n  <li><strong>Review</strong> - An EIP Author marks an EIP as ready for and requesting Peer Review.</li>\n  <li><strong>Last Call</strong> - This is the final review window for an EIP before moving to FINAL. An EIP editor will assign Last Call status and set a review end date (`last-call-deadline`), typically 14 days later. If this period results in necessary normative changes it will revert the EIP to Review.</li>\n  <li><strong>Final</strong> - This EIP represents the final standard. A Final EIP exists in a state of finality and should only be updated to correct errata and add non-normative clarifications.</li>\n  <li><strong>Stagnant</strong> - Any EIP in Draft or Review if inactive for a period of 6 months or greater is moved to Stagnant. An EIP may be resurrected from this state by Authors or EIP Editors through moving it back to Draft.</li>\n  <li><strong>Withdrawn</strong> - The EIP Author(s) have withdrawn the proposed EIP. This state has finality and can no longer be resurrected using this EIP number. If the idea is pursued at later date it is considered a new proposal.</li>\n  <li><strong>Living</strong> - A special status for EIPs that are designed to be continually updated and not reach a state of finality. This includes most notably EIP-1.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>EIP Types</h2>\n\n<p>EIPs are separated into a number of types, and each has its own list of EIPs.</p>\n\n<h3>Standards Track ({{site.pages|where:\"type\",\"Standards Track\"|size}})</h3>\n<p>Describes any change that affects most or all Ethereum implementations, such as a change to the network protocol, a change in block or transaction validity rules, proposed application standards/conventions, or any change or addition that affects the interoperability of applications using Ethereum. Furthermore Standard EIPs can be broken down into the following categories.</p>\n\n<h4><a href=\"{{\"core\"|relative_url}}\">Core</a> ({{site.pages|where:\"type\",\"Standards Track\"|where:\"category\",\"Core\"|size}})</h4>\n<p>Improvements requiring a consensus fork (e.g. <a href=\"./EIPS/eip-5\">EIP-5</a>, <a href=\"./EIPS/eip-211\">EIP-211</a>), as well as changes that are not necessarily consensus critical but may be relevant to “core dev” discussions (for example, the PoA algorithm for testnets described in <a href=\"./EIPS/eip-225\">EIP-225</a>).</p>\n\n<h4><a href=\"{{\"networking\"|relative_url}}\">Networking</a> ({{site.pages|where:\"type\",\"Standards Track\"|where:\"category\",\"Networking\"|size}})</h4>\n<p>Includes improvements around devp2p (<a href=\"./EIPS/eip-8\">EIP-8</a>) and Light Ethereum Subprotocol, as well as proposed improvements to network protocol specifications of whisper and swarm.</p>\n\n<h4><a href=\"{{\"interface\"|relative_url}}\">Interface</a> ({{site.pages|where:\"type\",\"Standards Track\"|where:\"category\",\"Interface\"|size}})</h4>\n<p>Includes improvements around client API/RPC specifications and standards, and also certain language-level standards like method names (<a href=\"./EIPS/eip-6\">EIP-6</a>) and contract ABIs. The label “interface” aligns with the interfaces repo and discussion should primarily occur in that repository before an EIP is submitted to the EIPs repository.</p>\n\n<h4><a href=\"{{\"erc\"|relative_url}}\">ERC</a> ({{site.pages|where:\"type\",\"Standards Track\"|where:\"category\",\"ERC\"|size}})</h4>\n<p>Application-level standards and conventions, including contract standards such as token standards (<a href=\"./EIPS/eip-20\">EIP-20</a>), name registries (<a href=\"./EIPS/eip-137\">EIP-137</a>), URI schemes (<a href=\"./EIPS/eip-681\">EIP-681</a>), library/package formats (<a href=\"./EIPS/eip-190\">EIP-190</a>), and account abstraction (<a href=\"./EIPS/eip-4337\">EIP-4337</a>).</p>\n\n<h3><a href=\"{{\"meta\"|relative_url}}\">Meta</a> ({{site.pages|where:\"type\",\"Meta\"|size}})</h3>\n<p>Describes a process surrounding Ethereum or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process EIPs are like Standards Track EIPs but apply to areas other than the Ethereum protocol itself. They may propose an implementation, but not to Ethereum's codebase; they often require community consensus; unlike Informational EIPs, they are more than recommendations, and users are typically not free to ignore them. Examples include procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and changes to the tools or environment used in Ethereum development. Any meta-EIP is also considered a Process EIP.</p>\n\n<h3><a href=\"{{\"informational\"|relative_url}}\">Informational</a> ({{site.pages|where:\"type\",\"Informational\"|size}})</h3>\n<p>Describes a Ethereum design issue, or provides general guidelines or information to the Ethereum community, but does not propose a new feature. Informational EIPs do not necessarily represent Ethereum community consensus or a recommendation, so users and implementers are free to ignore Informational EIPs or follow their advice.</p>\n"
