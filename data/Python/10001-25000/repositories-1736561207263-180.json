By simplifying the architecture and model memory requirements, as well as leveraging open-source code and pre-trained models, we were able to create a model that is 27 times smaller than the original DALL·E and train it on a single TPU v3-8 for only 3 days. DALL·E mini achieves impressive results, albeit of a lower quality than the original system. It can be used for exploration and further experimentation on commodity hardware.\"\nauthors: \n  -\n    family-names: Dayma\n    given-names: Boris\n  -\n    family-names: Patil\n    given-names: Suraj\n  -\n    family-names: Cuenca\n    given-names: Pedro\n  -\n    family-names: Saifullah\n    given-names: Khalid\n  -\n    family-names: Abraham\n    given-names: Tanishq\n  -\n    family-names: \"Lê Khắc\"\n    given-names: \"Phúc\"\n  -\n    family-names: Melas\n    given-names: Luke\n  -\n    family-names: Ghosh\n    given-names: Ritobrata\ncff-version: \"1.1.0\"\ndate-released: 2021-07-29\nidentifiers: \nkeywords: \n  - dalle\n  - \"text-to-image generation\"\n  - transformer\n  - \"zero-shot\"\n  - JAX\nlicense: \"Apache-2.0\"\ndoi: 10.5281/zenodo.5146400\nmessage: \"If you use this project, please cite it using these metadata.\"\nrepository-code: \"https://github.com/borisdayma/dalle-mini\"\ntitle: \"DALL·E Mini\"\nversion: \"v0.1-alpha\"\n..."
