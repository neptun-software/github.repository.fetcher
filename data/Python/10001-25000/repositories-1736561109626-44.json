          "content": "# Changelog\n\nAll notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.\n\nThe format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).\n\n## [1.4.0a1] - 2024-06-03\n\nAdding new metric PesqMetric ([Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6549559))\n\nAdding multiple audio augmentation functions: generating pink noises, up-/downsampling, low-/highpass filtering, banpass filtering, smoothing, duck masking, boosting. All are wrapped in the `audiocraft.utils.audio_effects.AudioEffects` and can be called with the API `audiocraft.utils.audio_effects.select_audio_effects`.\n\nAdd training code for AudioSeal (https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17264) along with the [hf checkpoints]( https://huggingface.co/facebook/audioseal).\n\n## [1.3.0] - 2024-05-02\n\nAdding the MAGNeT model (https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04577) along with hf checkpoints and a gradio demo app.\n\nTypo fixes.\n\nFixing setup.py to install only audiocraft, not the unit tests and scripts.\n\nFix FSDP support with PyTorch 2.1.0. \n\n## [1.2.0] - 2024-01-11\n\nAdding stereo models.\n\nFixed the commitment loss, which was until now only applied to the first RVQ layer.\n\nRemoved compression model state from the LM checkpoints, for consistency, it\nshould always be loaded from the original `compression_model_checkpoint`.\n\n\n## [1.1.0] - 2023-11-06\n\nNot using torchaudio anymore when writing audio files, relying instead directly on the commandline ffmpeg. Also not using it anymore for reading audio files, for similar reasons.\n\nFixed DAC support with non default number of codebooks.\n\nFixed bug when `two_step_cfg` was overriden when calling `generate()`.\n\nFixed samples being always prompted with audio, rather than having both prompted and unprompted.\n\n**Backward incompatible change:** A `torch.no_grad` around the computation of the conditioning made its way in the public release.\n\tThe released models were trained without this. Those impact linear layers applied to the output of the T5 or melody conditioners.\n\tWe removed it, so you might need to retrain models.\n\n**Backward incompatible change:** Fixing wrong sample rate in CLAP (WARNING if you trained model with CLAP before).\n\n**Backward incompatible change:** Renamed VALLEPattern to CoarseFirstPattern, as it was wrongly named. Probably no one\n\tretrained a model with this pattern, so hopefully this won't impact you!\n\n\n## [1.0.0] - 2023-09-07\n\nMajor revision, added training code for EnCodec, AudioGen, MusicGen, and MultiBandDiffusion.\nAdded pretrained model for AudioGen and MultiBandDiffusion.\n\n## [0.0.2] - 2023-08-01\n\nImproved demo, fixed top p (thanks @jnordberg).\n\nCompressor tanh on output to avoid clipping with some style (especially piano).\nNow repeating the conditioning periodically if it is too short.\n\nMore options when launching Gradio app locally (thanks @ashleykleynhans).\n\nTesting out PyTorch 2.0 memory efficient attention.\n\nAdded extended generation (infinite length) by slowly moving the windows.\nNote that other implementations exist: https://github.com/camenduru/MusicGen-colab.\n\n## [0.0.1] - 2023-06-09\n\nInitial release, with model evaluation only.\n"

Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights\n     under this Public License.\n\n  i. NonCommercial means not primarily intended for or directed towards\n     commercial advantage or monetary compensation.

Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n          6(a).\n\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n       5. Downstream recipients.\n\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\n            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n               Material.\n\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b. Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when\n          the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial\n          purposes.\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes\n     only;\n\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  b.

WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a.

AudioCraft contains inference and training code\nfor two state-of-the-art AI generative models producing high-quality audio: AudioGen and MusicGen.\n\n\n## Installation\nAudioCraft requires Python 3.9, PyTorch 2.1.0. To install AudioCraft, you can run the following:\n\n```shell\n# Best to make sure you have torch installed first, in particular before installing xformers.\n# Don't run this if you already have PyTorch installed.\npython -m pip install 'torch==2.1.0'\n# You might need the following before trying to install the packages\npython -m pip install setuptools wheel\n# Then proceed to one of the following\npython -m pip install -U audiocraft  # stable release\npython -m pip install -U git+https://git@github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft#egg=audiocraft  # bleeding edge\npython -m pip install -e .  # or if you cloned the repo locally (mandatory if you want to train).\npython -m pip install -e '.[wm]'  # if you want to train a watermarking model\n```\n\nWe also recommend having `ffmpeg` installed, either through your system or Anaconda:\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install ffmpeg\n# Or if you are using Anaconda or Miniconda\nconda install \"ffmpeg<5\" -c conda-forge\n```\n\n## Models\n\nAt the moment, AudioCraft contains the training code and inference code for:\n* [MusicGen](./docs/MUSICGEN.md): A state-of-the-art controllable text-to-music model.\n* [AudioGen](./docs/AUDIOGEN.md): A state-of-the-art text-to-sound model.\n* [EnCodec](./docs/ENCODEC.md): A state-of-the-art high fidelity neural audio codec.\n* [Multi Band Diffusion](./docs/MBD.md): An EnCodec compatible decoder using diffusion.\n* [MAGNeT](./docs/MAGNET.md): A state-of-the-art non-autoregressive model for text-to-music and text-to-sound.\n* [AudioSeal](./docs/WATERMARKING.md): A state-of-the-art audio watermarking.\n* [MusicGen Style](./docs/MUSICGEN_STYLE.md): A state-of-the-art text-and-style-to-music model.\n\n## Training code\n\nAudioCraft contains PyTorch components for deep learning research in audio and training pipelines for the developed models.\nFor a general introduction of AudioCraft design principles and instructions to develop your own training pipeline, refer to\nthe [AudioCraft training documentation](./docs/TRAINING.md).\n\nFor reproducing existing work and using the developed training pipelines, refer to the instructions for each specific model\nthat provides pointers to configuration, example grids and model/task-specific information and FAQ.\n\n\n## API documentation\n\nWe provide some [API documentation](https://facebookresearch.github.io/audiocraft/api_docs/audiocraft/index.html) for AudioCraft.\n\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Is the training code available?\n\nYes! We provide the training code for [EnCodec](./docs/ENCODEC.md), [MusicGen](./docs/MUSICGEN.md) and [Multi Band Diffusion](./docs/MBD.md).\n\n#### Where are the models stored?\n\nHugging Face stored the model in a specific location, which can be overridden by setting the `AUDIOCRAFT_CACHE_DIR` environment variable for the AudioCraft models.\nIn order to change the cache location of the other Hugging Face models, please check out the [Hugging Face Transformers documentation for the cache setup](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/installation#cache-setup).\nFinally, if you use a model that relies on Demucs (e.g. `musicgen-melody`) and want to change the download location for Demucs, refer to the [Torch Hub documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/hub.html#where-are-my-downloaded-models-saved).\n\n\n## License\n* The code in this repository is released under the MIT license as found in the [LICENSE file](LICENSE).\n* The models weights in this repository are released under the CC-BY-NC 4.0 license as found in the [LICENSE_weights file](LICENSE_weights).\n\n\n## Citation\n\nFor the general framework of AudioCraft, please cite the following.\n```\n@inproceedings{copet2023simple,\n    title={Simple and Controllable Music Generation},\n    author={Jade Copet and Felix Kreuk and Itai Gat and Tal Remez and David Kant and Gabriel Synnaeve and Yossi Adi and Alexandre Défossez},\n    booktitle={Thirty-seventh Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\n    year={2023},\n}\n```\n\nWhen referring to a specific model, please cite as mentioned in the model specific README, e.g\n[./docs/MUSICGEN.md](./docs/MUSICGEN.md), [./docs/AUDIOGEN.md](./docs/AUDIOGEN.md), etc.\n"
