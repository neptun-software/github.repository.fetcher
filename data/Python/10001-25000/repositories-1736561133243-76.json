This release includes a number of significant features, enhancements, and bug fixes.\n\n### Major New Features\n\n- **ChatModel enhancements** - ChatModel now adopts `ChatCompletionRequest` and `ChatCompletionResponse` as its new schema. The `predict_stream` interface uses `ChatCompletionChunk` to deliver true streaming responses. Additionally, the `custom_inputs` and `custom_outputs` fields in ChatModel now utilize `AnyType`, enabling support for a wider variety of data types. **Note:** In a future version of MLflow, `ChatParams` (and by extension, `ChatCompletionRequest`) will have the default values for `n`, `temperature`, and `stream` removed. (#13782, #13857, @stevenchen-db)\n\n- **Tracing improvements** - [MLflow Tracing](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/tracing/index.html) now supports both automatic and manual tracing for DSPy, LlamaIndex and Langchain flavors. Tracing feature is also auto-enabled for mlflow evaluation for all supported flavors. (#13790, #13793, #13795, #13897, @B-Step62)\n\n- **New Tracing Integrations** - [MLflow Tracing](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/tracing/index.html) now supports **CrewAI** and **Anthropic**, enabling a one-line, fully automated tracing experience. (#13903, @TomeHirata, #13851, @gabrielfu)\n\n- **Any Type in model signature** - MLflow now supports AnyType in model signature. It can be used to host any data types that were not supported before. (#13766, @serena-ruan)\n\nOther Features:\n\n- [Tracking] Add `update_current_trace` API for adding tags to an active trace. (#13828, @B-Step62)\n- [Deployments] Update databricks deployments to support AI gateway & additional update endpoints (#13513, @djliden)\n- [Models] Support uv in mlflow.models.predict (#13824, @serena-ruan)\n- [Models] Add type hints support including pydantic models (#13924, @serena-ruan)\n- [Tracking] Add the `trace.search_spans()` method for searching spans within traces (#13984, @B-Step62)\n\nBug fixes:\n\n- [Tracking] Allow passing in spark connect dataframes in mlflow evaluate API (#13889, @WeichenXu123)\n- [Tracking] Fix `mlflow.end_run` inside a MLflow run context manager (#13888, @WeichenXu123)\n- [Scoring] Fix spark_udf conditional check on remote spark-connect client or Databricks Serverless (#13827, @WeichenXu123)\n- [Models] Allow changing max_workers for built-in LLM-as-a-Judge metrics (#13858, @B-Step62)\n- [Models] Support saving all langchain runnables using code-based logging (#13821, @serena-ruan)\n- [Model Registry] return empty array when DatabricksSDKModelsArtifactRepository.list_artifacts is called on a file (#14027, @shichengzhou-db)\n- [Tracking] Stringify param values in client.log_batch() (#14015, @B-Step62)\n- [Tracking] Remove deprecated squared parameter (#14028, @B-Step62)\n- [Tracking] Fix request/response field in the search_traces output (#13985, @B-Step62)\n\nDocumentation updates:\n\n- [Docs] Add Ollama and Instructor examples in tracing doc (#13937, @B-Step62)\n\nSmall bug fixes and documentation updates:\n\n#13972, #13968, #13917, #13912, #13906, #13846, @serena-ruan; #13969, #13959, #13957, #13958, #13925, #13882, #13879, #13881, #13869, #13870, #13868, #13854, #13849, #13847, #13836, #13823, #13811, #13820, #13775, #13768, #13764, @harupy; #13960, #13914, #13862, #13892, #13916, #13918, #13915, #13878, #13891, #13863, #13859, #13850, #13844, #13835, #13818, #13762, @B-Step62; #13913, #13848, #13774, @TomeHirata; #13936, #13954, #13883, @daniellok-db; #13947, @AHB102; #13929, #13922, @Ajay-Satish-01; #13857, @stevenchen-db; #13773, @BenWilson2; #13705, @williamjamir; #13745, #13743, @WeichenXu123; #13895, @chenmoneygithub; #14023, @theBeginner86\n\n## 2.18.0 (2024-11-18)\n\nWe are excited to announce the release of MLflow 2.18.0! This release includes a number of significant features, enhancements, and bug fixes.\n\n### Python Version Update\n\nPython 3.8 is now at an end-of-life point. With official support being dropped for this legacy version, **MLflow now requires Python 3.9**\nas a minimum supported version.\n\n> Note: If you are currently using MLflow's `ChatModel` interface for authoring custom GenAI applications, please ensure that you\n> have read the future breaking changes section below.\n\n### Major New Features\n\n- **🦺 Fluent API Thread/Process Safety** - MLflow's fluent APIs for tracking and the model registry have been overhauled to add support for both thread and multi-process safety. You are now no longer forced to use the Client APIs for managing experiments, runs, and logging from within multiprocessing and threaded applications. (#13456, #13419, @WeichenXu123)\n\n- **🧩 DSPy flavor** - MLflow now supports logging, loading, and tracing of `DSPy` models, broadening the support for advanced GenAI authoring within MLflow. Check out the [MLflow DSPy Flavor](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/dspy/index.html) documentation to get started! (#13131, #13279, #13369, #13345, @chenmoneygithub, #13543, #13800, #13807, @B-Step62, #13289, @michael-berk)\n\n- **🖥️ Enhanced Trace UI** - [MLflow Tracing](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/tracing/index.html)'s UI has undergone\n  a significant overhaul to bring usability and quality of life updates to the experience of auditing and investigating the contents of GenAI traces, from enhanced span content rendering using markdown to a standardized span component structure, (#13685, #13357, #13242, @daniellok-db)\n\n- **🚄 New Tracing Integrations** - [MLflow Tracing](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/tracing/index.html) now supports **DSPy**, **LiteLLM**, and **Google Gemini**, enabling a one-line, fully automated tracing experience. These integrations unlock enhanced observability across a broader range of industry tools. Stay tuned for upcoming integrations and updates! (#13801, @TomeHirata, #13585, @B-Step62)\n\n- **📊 Expanded LLM-as-a-Judge Support** - MLflow now enhances its evaluation capabilities with support for additional providers, including `Anthropic`, `Bedrock`, `Mistral`, and `TogetherAI`, alongside existing providers like `OpenAI`. Users can now also configure proxy endpoints or self-hosted LLMs that follow the provider API specs by using the new `proxy_url` and `extra_headers` options. Visit the [LLM-as-a-Judge](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/llm-evaluate/index.html#llm-as-a-judge-metrics) documentation for more details! (#13715, #13717, @B-Step62)\n\n\n- **⏰ Environment Variable Detection** - As a helpful reminder for when you are deploying models, MLflow now detects and reminds users of environment variables set during model logging, ensuring they are configured for deployment. In addition to this, the `mlflow.models.predict` utility has also been updated to include these variables in serving simulations, improving pre-deployment validation. (#13584, @serena-ruan)\n\n\n### Breaking Changes to ChatModel Interface\n\n- **ChatModel Interface Updates** - As part of a broader unification effort within MLflow and services that rely on or deeply integrate\n  with MLflow's GenAI features, we are working on a phased approach to making a consistent and standard interface for custom GenAI\n  application development and usage. In the first phase (planned for release in the next few releases of MLflow), we are marking\n  several interfaces as deprecated, as they will be changing. These changes will be:\n\n  - **Renaming of Interfaces**:\n    - `ChatRequest` → `ChatCompletionRequest` to provide disambiguation for future planned request interfaces.\n    - `ChatResponse` → `ChatCompletionResponse` for the same reason as the input interface.\n    - `metadata` fields within `ChatRequest` and `ChatResponse` → `custom_inputs` and `custom_outputs`, respectively.\n  - **Streaming Updates**:\n    - `predict_stream` will be updated to enable true streaming for custom GenAI applications. Currently, it returns a generator with synchronous outputs from predict. In a future release, it will return a generator of `ChatCompletionChunks`, enabling asynchronous streaming. While the API call structure will remain the same, the returned data payload will change significantly, aligning with LangChain’s implementation.\n  - **Legacy Dataclass Deprecation**:\n    - Dataclasses in `mlflow.models.rag_signatures` will be deprecated, merging into unified `ChatCompletionRequest`, `ChatCompletionResponse`, and `ChatCompletionChunks`.\n\nOther Features:\n\n- [Evaluate] Add Huggingface BLEU metrics to MLflow Evaluate (#12799, @nebrass)\n- [Models / Databricks] Add support for `spark_udf` when running on Databricks Serverless runtime, Databricks connect, and prebuilt python environments (#13276, #13496, @WeichenXu123)\n- [Scoring] Add a `model_config` parameter for `pyfunc.spark_udf` for customization of batch inference payload submission (#13517, @WeichenXu123)\n- [Tracing] Standardize retriever span outputs to a list of MLflow `Document`s (#13242, @daniellok-db)\n- [UI] Add support for visualizing and comparing nested parameters within the MLflow UI (#13012, @jescalada)\n- [UI] Add support for comparing logged artifacts within the Compare Run page in the MLflow UI (#13145, @jescalada)\n- [Databricks] Add support for `resources` definitions for `Langchain` model logging (#13315, @sunishsheth2009)\n- [Databricks] Add support for defining multiple retrievers within `dependencies` for Agent definitions (#13246, @sunishsheth2009)\n\nBug fixes:\n\n- [Database] Cascade deletes to datasets when deleting experiments to fix a bug in MLflow's `gc` command when deleting experiments with logged datasets (#13741, @daniellok-db)\n- [Models] Fix a bug with `Langchain`'s `pyfunc` predict input conversion (#13652, @serena-ruan)\n- [Models] Fix signature inference for subclasses and `Optional` dataclasses that define a model's signature (#13440, @bbqiu)\n- [Tracking] Fix an issue with async logging batch splitting validation rules (#13722, @WeichenXu123)\n- [Tracking] Fix an issue with `LangChain`'s autologging thread-safety behavior (#13672, @B-Step62)\n- [Tracking] Disable support for running spark autologging in a threadpool due to limitations in Spark (#13599, @WeichenXu123)\n- [Tracking] Mark `role` and `index` as required for chat schema (#13279, @chenmoneygithub)\n- [Tracing] Handle raw response in openai autolog (#13802, @harupy)\n- [Tracing] Fix a bug with tracing source run behavior when running inference with multithreading on `Langchain` models (#13610, @WeichenXu123)\n\n\nDocumentation updates:\n\n- [Docs] Add docstring warnings for upcoming changes to ChatModel (#13730, @stevenchen-db)\n- [Docs] Add a contributor's guide for implementing tracing integrations (#13333, @B-Step62)\n- [Docs] Add guidance in the use of `model_config` when logging models as code (#13631, @sunishsheth2009)\n- [Docs] Add documentation for the use of custom library artifacts with the `code_paths` model logging feature (#13702, @TomeHirata)\n- [Docs] Improve `SparkML` `log_model` documentation with guidance on how return probabilities from classification models (#13684, @WeichenXu123)\n\nSmall bug fixes and documentation updates:\n\n #13775, #13768, #13764, #13744, #13699, #13742, #13703, #13669, #13682, #13569, #13563, #13562, #13539, #13537, #13533, #13408, #13295, @serena-ruan;

This release includes several enhancements to extend the\nfunctionality of MLflow's ChatModel interface to further extend its versatility for handling custom GenAI application use cases. \nAdditionally, we've improved the interface within the tracing UI to provide a structured output for retrieved documents,\nenhancing the ability to read the contents of those documents within the UI.\nWe're also starting the work on improving both the utility and the versatility of MLflow's evaluate functionality for GenAI,\ninitially with support for callable GenAI evaluation metrics. \n\n### Major Features and notifications:\n\n- **ChatModel enhancements** - As the GenAI-focused 'cousin' of `PythonModel`, `ChatModel` is getting some sizable functionality\n  extensions. From native support for tool calling (a requirement for creating a custom agent), simpler conversions to the\n  internal dataclass constructs needed to interface with `ChatModel` via the introduction of `from_dict` methods to all data structures,\n  the addition of a `metadata` field to allow for full input payload customization, handling of the new `refusal` response type, to the\n  inclusion of the interface type to the response structure to allow for greater integration compatibility.\n  (#13191, #13180, #13143, @daniellok-db, #13102, #13071, @BenWilson2)\n\n- **Callable GenAI Evaluation Metrics** - As the intial step in a much broader expansion of the functionalities of `mlflow.evaluate` for\n  GenAI use cases, we've converted the GenAI evaluation metrics to be callable. This allows you to use them directly in packages that support\n  callable GenAI evaluation metrics, as well as making it simpler to debug individual responses when prototyping solutions. (#13144, @serena-ruan)\n\n- **Audio file support in the MLflow UI** - You can now directly 'view' audio files that have been logged and listen to them from within the MLflow UI's\n  artifact viewer pane.\n\n- **MLflow AI Gateway is no longer deprecated** - We've decided to revert our deprecation for the AI Gateway feature. We had renamed it to the\n  MLflow Deployments Server, but have reconsidered and reverted the naming and namespace back to the original configuration.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- [Tracing] Add Standardization to retriever span outputs within MLflow tracing (#13242, @daniellok-db)\n- [Models] Add support for LlamaIndex `Workflows` objects to be serialized when calling `log_model()` (#13277, #13305, #13336, @B-Step62)\n- [Models] Add tool calling support for ChatModel (#13191, @daniellok-db)\n- [Models] Add `from_dict()` function to ChatModel dataclasses (#13180, @daniellok-db)\n- [Models] Add metadata field for ChatModel (#13143, @daniellok-db)\n- [Models] Update ChatCompletionResponse to populate object type (#13102, @BenWilson2)\n- [Models] Add support for LLM response refusal (#13071, @BenWilson2)\n- [Models] Add support for resources to be passed in via `langchain.log_model()` (#13315, @sunishsheth2009)\n- [Tracking] Add support for setting multiple retrievers' schema via `set_retriever_schema` (#13246, @sunishsheth2009)\n- [Eval] Make Evaluation metrics callable (#13144, @serena-ruan)\n- [UI] Add audio support to artifact viewer UI (#13017, @sydneyw-spotify)\n- [Databricks] Add support for route_optimized parameter in databricks deployment client (#13222, @prabhatkgupta)\n\nBug fixes:\n\n- [Tracking] Fix tracing for LangGraph (#13215, @B-Step62)\n- [Tracking] Fix an issue with `presigned_url_artifact` requests being in the wrong format (#13366, @WeichenXu123)\n- [Models] Update Databricks dependency extraction functionality to work with the `langchain-databricks` partner package.

This release includes many major features and improvements!\n\n### Major features:\n\n- **LlamaIndex Flavor**🦙 - MLflow now offers a native integration with [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/), one of the most popular libraries for building GenAI apps centered around custom data. This integration allows you to log LlamaIndex indices within MLflow, allowing for the loading and deployment of your indexed data for inference tasks  with different engine types. MLflow also provides comprehensive tracing support for LlamaIndex operations, offering unprecedented transparency into complex queries. Check out the [MLflow LlamaIndex documentation](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/llama-index/index.html) to get started! (#12633, @michael-berk, @B-Step62)\n\n- **OpenAI Tracing**🔍 - We've enhanced our OpenAI integration with a new tracing feature that works seamlessly with MLflow OpenAI autologging. You can now enable tracing of their OpenAI API usage with a single `mlflow.openai.autolog()` call, thereby MLflow will  automatically log valuable metadata such as token usage and a history of your interactions, providing deeper insights into your OpenAI-powered applications. To start exploring this new capability, please check out [the tracing documentation](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/tracing/index.html#automatic-tracing)! (#12267, @gabrielfu)\n\n- **Enhanced Model Deployment with New Validation Feature**✅ - To improve the reliability of model deployments, MLflow has added a new method to validate your model before deploying it to an inference endpoint. This feature helps to eliminate typical errors in input and output handling, streamlining the process of model deployment and increasing confidence in your deployed models. By catching potential issues early, you can ensure a smoother transition from development to production. (#12710, @serena-ruan)\n\n- **Custom Metrics Definition Recording for Evaluations**📊 - We've strengthened the flexibility of defining custom metrics for model evaluation by automatically logging and versioning metrics definitions, including models used as judges and prompt templates. With this new capability, you can ensure reproducibility of evaluations across different runs and easily reuse evaluation setups for consistency, facilitating more meaningful comparisons between different models or versions. (#12487, #12509, @xq-yin)\n\n- **Databricks SDK Integration**🔐 - MLflow's interaction with Databricks endpoints has been fully migrated to use the [Databricks SDK](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/sdk-python.html). This change brings more robust and reliable connections between MLflow and Databricks, and access to the latest Databricks features and capabilities. We mark the legacy databricks-cli support as deprecated and will remove in the future release.  (#12313, @WeichenXu123)\n\n- **Spark VectorUDT Support**💥 - MLflow's [Model Signature](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/model/signatures.html) framework now supports Spark Vector UDT (User Defined Type), enabling logging and deployment of models using Spark VectorUDT with robust type validation. (#12758, @WeichenXu123)\n\n### Other Notable Changes\n\nFeatures:\n\n- [Tracking] Add `parent_id` as a parameter to the `start_run` fluent API for alternative control flows (#12721, @Flametaa)\n- [Tracking] Add U2M authentication support for connecting to Databricks from MLflow (#12713, @WeichenXu123)\n- [Tracking] Support deleting remote artifacts with `mlflow gc` (#12451, @M4nouel)\n- [Tracing] Traces can now be deleted conveniently via UI from the Traces tab in the experiments page (#12641, @daniellok-db)\n- [Models] Introduce additional parameters for the `ChatModel` interface for GenAI flavors (#12612, @WeichenXu123)\n- [Models] [Transformers] Support input images encoded with b64.encodebytes (#12087, @MadhuM02)\n- [Models Registry] Add support for AWS KMS encryption for the Unity Catalog model registry integration (#12495, @artjen)\n- [Models] Fix MLflow Dataset hashing logic for Pandas dataframe to use `iloc` for accessing rows (#12410, @julcsii)\n- [Models Registry] Support presigned urls without headers for artifact location (#12349, @artjen)\n- [UI] The experiments page in the MLflow UI has an updated look, and comes with some performance optimizations for line charts (#12641, @hubertzub-db)\n- [UI] Line charts can now be configured to ignore outliers in the data (#12641, @daniellok-db)\n- [UI] Creating compatibility with Kubeflow Dashboard UI (#12663, @cgilviadee) \n- [UI] Add a new section to the artifact page in the Tracking UI, which shows code snippet to validate model input format before deployment (#12729, @serena-ruan)\n\nBug fixes:\n\n- [Tracking] Fix the model construction bug in MLflow SHAP evaluation for scikit-learn model (#12599, @serena-ruan)\n- [Tracking] File store get_experiment_by_name returns all stage experiments (#12788, @serena-ruan)\n- [Tracking] Fix Langchain callback injection logic for async/streaming request (#12773, @B-Step62)\n- [Tracing] [OpenAI] Fix stream tracing for OpenAI to record the correct chunk structure (#12629, @BenWilson2)\n- [Tracing] [LangChain] Fix LangChain tracing bug for `.batch` call due to thread unsafety (#12701, @B-Step62)\n- [Tracing] [LangChain] Fix nested trace issue in LangChain tracing.

This feature simplifies the creation and management of dynamic prompts, enhancing user interaction with AI models and streamlining prompt engineering processes. (#11311, #11385 @brynn-code)\n\n- **Enhanced Metadata Sharing for Unity Catalog**: MLflow now supports the ability to share metadata (and not model weights) within Databricks Unity Catalog. When logging a model, this functionality enables the automatic duplication of metadata into a dedicated subdirectory, distinct from the model’s actual storage location, allowing for different sharing permissions and access control limits. (#11357, #11720 @WeichenXu123)\n\n- **Code Paths Unification and Standardization**: We have unified and standardized the `code_paths` parameter across all MLflow flavors to ensure a cohesive and streamlined user experience. This change promotes consistency and reduces complexity in the model deployment lifecycle. (#11688, @BenWilson2)\n\n- **ChatOpenAI and AzureChatOpenAI Support**: Support for the ChatOpenAI and AzureChatOpenAI interfaces has been integrated into the LangChain flavor, facilitating seamless deployment of conversational AI models. This development opens new doors for building sophisticated and responsive chat applications leveraging cutting-edge language models. (#11644, @B-Step62)\n\n- **Custom Models in Sentence-Transformers**: The sentence-transformers flavor now supports custom models, allowing for a greater flexibility in deploying tailored NLP solutions. (#11635, @B-Step62)\n\n- **Image Support for Log Table**: With the addition of image support in `log_table`, MLflow enhances its capabilities in handling rich media. This functionality allows for direct logging and visualization of images within the platform, improving the interpretability and analysis of visual data. (#11535, @jessechancy)\n\n- **Streaming Support for LangChain**: The newly introduced `predict_stream` API for LangChain models supports streaming outputs, enabling real-time output for chain invocation via pyfunc. This feature is pivotal for applications requiring continuous data processing and instant feedback. (#11490, #11580 @WeichenXu123)\n\n### Security Fixes:\n\n- **Security Patch**: Addressed a critical Local File Read/Path Traversal vulnerability within the Model Registry, ensuring robust protection against unauthorized access and securing user data integrity.

From grouping to large-scale metric plotting throughout\n  the iterations of a DL model's training cycle, there are a large number of quality of life improvements to enhance your Deep Learning MLOps workflow.  \n\n- Support for the popular [PEFT](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/transformers/guide/index.html#peft-models-in-mlflow-transformers-flavor) library from HuggingFace is now available\n  in the `mlflow.transformers` flavor. In addition to PEFT support, we've removed the restrictions on Pipeline types\n  that can be logged to MLflow, as well as the ability to, when developing and testing models, log a transformers pipeline without copying foundational model weights. These\n  enhancements strive to make the transformers flavor more useful for cutting-edge GenAI models, new pipeline types, and to simplify the development process of prompt engineering, fine-tuning,\n  and to make iterative development faster and cheaper. Give the updated flavor a try today! (#11240, @B-Step62)\n\n- We've added support to both [PyTorch](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.pytorch.html#mlflow.pytorch.autolog) and\n  [TensorFlow](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.tensorflow.html#mlflow.tensorflow.autolog) for automatic model weights checkpointing (including resumption from a\n  previous state) for the auto logging implementations within both flavors. This highly requested feature allows you to automatically configure long-running Deep Learning training\n  runs to keep a safe storage of your best epoch, eliminating the risk of a failure late in training from losing the state of the model optimization. (#11197, #10935, @WeichenXu123)\n\n- We've added a new interface to Pyfunc for GenAI workloads. The new `ChatModel` interface allows for interacting with a deployed GenAI chat model as you would with any other provider.\n  The simplified interface (no longer requiring conformance to a Pandas DataFrame input type) strives to unify the API interface experience. (#10820, @daniellok-db)\n\n- We now support Keras 3. This large overhaul of the Keras library introduced new fundamental changes to how Keras integrates with different DL frameworks, bringing with it\n  a host of new functionality and interoperability. To learn more, see the [Keras 3.0 Tutorial](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/deep-learning/keras/quickstart/quickstart_keras.html)\n  to start using the updated model flavor today! (#10830, @chenmoneygithub)\n\n- [Mistral AI](https://mistral.ai/) has been added as a native [provider](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/deployments/index.html#providers) for the MLflow Deployments Server. You can\n  now create proxied connections to the Mistral AI services for completions and embeddings with their powerful GenAI models. (#11020, @thnguyendn)\n\n- We've added compatibility support for the OpenAI 1.x SDK. Whether you're using an OpenAI LLM for model evaluation or calling OpenAI within a LangChain model, you'll now be able to\n  utilize the 1.x family of the OpenAI SDK without having to point to deprecated legacy APIs.

The new site landing page is fresh, modern, and contains more content than ever. We're adding new content and blogs all of the time.\n\n- Objects and Arrays are now available as configurable input and output schema elements. These new types are particularly useful for GenAI-focused flavors that can have complex input and output types. See the new [Signature and Input Example documentation](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/model/signatures.html) to learn more about how to use these new signature types.\n\n- LangChain has autologging support now! When you invoke a chain, with autologging enabled, we will automatically log most chain implementations, recording and storing your configured LLM application for you.  See the new [Langchain documentation](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/langchain/index.html#mlflow-langchain-autologging) to learn more about how to use this feature.\n\n- The MLflow `transformers` flavor now supports prompt templates. You can now specify an application-specific set of instructions to submit to your GenAI pipeline in order to simplify, streamline, and integrate sets of system prompts to be supplied with each input request. Check out the updated [guide to transformers](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/transformers/index.html) to learn more and see examples!\n\n - The [MLflow Deployments Server](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/deployments/index.html) now supports two new requested features: (1) OpenAI endpoints that support streaming responses. You can now configure an endpoint to return realtime responses for Chat and Completions instead of waiting for the entire text contents to be completed.

We recommend\nthat you upgrade to Python 3 - see https://docs.python.org/3/howto/pyporting.html for a migration\nguide.\n\nBreaking changes to Model Registry REST APIs:\n\nModel Registry REST APIs have been updated to be more consistent with the other MLflow APIs. With\nthis release Model Registry APIs are intended to be stable until the next major version.\n\n- Python and Java client APIs for Model Registry have been updated to use the new REST APIs. When using an MLflow client with a server using updated REST endpoints, you won't need to change any code but will need to upgrade to a new client version. The client APIs contain deprecated arguments, which for this release are backward compatible, but will be dropped in future releases.

Some store implementations may support longer tag values (#1687, @ankitmathur-db)\n- Gunicorn options can now be configured for the `mlflow models serve` CLI with the `GUNICORN_CMD_ARGS` environment variable (#1557, @LarsDu)\n- Jsonnet artifacts can now be previewed in the UI (#1683, @ankitmathur-db)\n- Adds an optional `python_version` argument to `mlflow_install` for specifying the Python version (e.g. \"3.5\") to use within the conda environment created for installing the MLflow CLI. If `python_version` is unspecified, `mlflow_install` defaults to using Python 3.6. (#1722, @smurching)\n\n**Bug fixes and documentation updates**\n\n- [Tracking] The Autologging feature is now more resilient to tracking errors (#1690, @apurva-koti)\n- [Tracking] The `runs` field in in the `GetExperiment.Response` proto has been deprecated & will be removed in MLflow 2.0. Please use the `Search Runs` API for fetching runs instead (#1647, @dbczumar)\n- [Projects] Fixed a bug that prevented docker-based MLflow Projects from logging artifacts to the `LocalArtifactRepository` (#1450, @nlaille)\n- [Projects] Running MLflow projects with the `--no-conda` flag in R no longer requires Anaconda to be installed (#1650, @spadarian)\n- [Models/Scoring] Fixed a bug that prevented Spark UDFs from being loaded on Databricks (#1658, @smurching)\n- [UI] AJAX requests made by the MLflow Server Frontend now specify correct MIME-Types (#1679, @ynotzort)\n- [UI] Previews now render correctly for artifacts with uppercase file extensions (e.g., `.JSON`, `.YAML`) (#1664, @ankitmathur-db)\n- [UI] Fixed a bug that caused search API errors to surface a Niagara Falls page (#1681, @dbczumar)\n- [Installation] MLflow dependencies are now selected properly based on the target installation platform (#1643, @akshaya-a)\n- [UI] Fixed a bug where the \"load more\" button in the experiment view did not appear on browsers in Windows (#1718, @Zangr)\n\nSmall bug fixes and doc updates (#1663, #1719, @dbczumar; #1693, @max-allen-db; #1695, #1659, @smurching; #1675, @jdlesage; #1699, @ankitmathur-db; #1696, @aarondav; #1710, #1700, #1656, @apurva-koti)\n\n## 1.1 (2019-07-22)\n\nMLflow 1.1 includes several major features and improvements:\n\nIn MLflow Tracking:\n\n- Experimental support for autologging from Tensorflow and Keras. Using `mlflow.tensorflow.autolog()` will enable automatic logging of metrics and optimizer parameters from TensorFlow to MLflow. The feature will work with TensorFlow versions `1.12 <= v < 2.0`. (#1520, #1601, @apurva-koti)\n- Parallel coordinates plot in the MLflow compare run UI. Adds out of the box support for a parallel coordinates plot. The plot allows users to observe relationships between a n-dimensional set of parameters to metrics. It visualizes all runs as lines that are color-coded based on the value of a metric (e.g. accuracy), and shows what parameter values each run took on. (#1497, @Zangr)\n- Pandas based search API. Adds the ability to return the results of a search as a pandas dataframe using the new `mlflow.search_runs` API. (#1483, #1548, @max-allen-db)\n- Java fluent API. Adds a new set of APIs to create and log to MLflow runs. This API contrasts with the existing low level `MlflowClient` API which simply wraps the REST APIs. The new fluent API allows you to create and log runs similar to how you would using the Python fluent API. (#1508, @andrewmchen)\n- Run tags improvements. Adds the ability to add and edit tags from the run view UI, delete tags from the API, and view tags in the experiment search view. (#1400, #1426, @Zangr; #1548, #1558, @ankitmathur-db)\n- Search API improvements. Adds order by and pagination to the search API. Pagination allows you to read a large set of runs in small page sized chunks. This allows clients and backend implementations to handle an unbounded set of runs in a scalable manner. (#1444, @sueann; #1437, #1455, #1482, #1485, #1542, @aarondav; #1567, @max-allen-db; #1217, @mparkhe)\n- Windows support for running the MLflow tracking server and UI. (#1080, @akshaya-a)\n\nIn MLflow Projects:\n\n- Experimental support to run Docker based MLprojects in Kubernetes. Adds the first fully open source remote execution backend for MLflow projects. With this, you can leverage elastic compute resources managed by kubernetes for their ML training purposes. For example, you can run grid search over a set of hyperparameters by running several instances of an MLproject in parallel. (#1181, @marcusrehm, @tomasatdatabricks, @andrewmchen; #1566, @stbof, @dbczumar; #1574 @dbczumar)\n\n**More features and improvements**\n\nIn MLflow Tracking:\n\n- Paginated “load more” and backend sorting for experiment search view UI. This change allows the UI to scalably display the sorted runs from large experiments. (#1564, @Zangr)\n- Search results are encoded in the URL. This allows you to share searches through their URL and to deep link to them. (#1416, @apurva-koti)\n- Ability to serve MLflow UI behind `jupyter-server-proxy` or outside of the root path `/`. Previous to MLflow 1.1, the UI could only be hosted on `/` since the Javascript makes requests directly to `/ajax-api/...`. With this patch, MLflow will make requests to `ajax-api/...` or a path relative to where the HTML is being served. (#1413, @xhochy)\n\nIn MLflow Models:\n\n- Update `mlflow.spark.log_model()` to accept descendants of pyspark.Model (#1519, @ankitmathur-db)\n- Support for saving custom Keras models with `custom_objects`. This field is semantically equivalent to custom_objects parameter of `keras.models.load_model()` function (#1525, @ankitmathur-db)\n- New more performant split orient based input format for pyfunc scoring server (#1479, @lennon310)\n- Ability to specify gunicorn server options for pyfunc scoring server built with `mlflow models build-docker`. #1428, @lennon310)\n\n**Bug fixes and documentation updates**\n\n- [Tracking] Fix database migration for MySQL. `mlflow db upgrade` should now work for MySQL backends. (#1404, @sueann)\n- [Tracking] Make CLI `mlflow server` and `mlflow ui` commands to work with SQLAlchemy URIs that specify a database driver. (#1411, @sueann)\n- [Tracking] Fix usability bugs related to FTP artifact repository. (#1398, @kafendt; #1421, @nlaille)\n- [Tracking] Return appropriate HTTP status codes for MLflowException (#1434, @max-allen-db)\n- [Tracking] Fix sorting by user ID in the experiment search view. (#1401, @andrewmchen)\n- [Tracking] Allow calling log_metric with NaNs and infs. (#1573, @tomasatdatabricks)\n- [Tracking] Fixes an infinite loop in downloading artifacts logged via dbfs and retrieved via S3. (#1605, @sueann)\n- [Projects] Docker projects should preserve directory structure (#1436, @ahutterTA)\n- [Projects] Fix conda activation for newer versions of conda. (#1576, @avinashraghuthu, @smurching)\n- [Models] Allow you to log Tensorflow keras models from the `tf.keras` module. (#1546, @tomasatdatabricks)\n\nSmall bug fixes and doc updates (#1463, @mateiz; #1641, #1622, #1418, @sueann; #1607, #1568, #1536, #1478, #1406, #1408, @smurching; #1504, @LizaShak; #1490, @acroz; #1633, #1631, #1603, #1589, #1569, #1526, #1446, #1438, @apurva-koti; #1456, @Taur1ne; #1547, #1495, @aarondav; #1610, #1600, #1492, #1493, #1447, @tomasatdatabricks; #1430, @javierluraschi; #1424, @nathansuh; #1488, @henningsway; #1590, #1427, @Zangr; #1629, #1614, #1574, #1521, #1522, @dbczumar; #1577, #1514, @ankitmathur-db; #1588, #1566, @stbof; #1575, #1599, @max-allen-db; #1592, @abaveja313; #1606, @andrewmchen)\n\n## 1.0 (2019-06-03)\n\nMLflow 1.0 includes many significant features and improvements. From this version, MLflow is no longer beta, and all APIs except those marked as experimental are intended to be stable until the next major version. As such, this release includes a number of breaking changes.\n\nMajor features, improvements, and breaking changes\n\n- Support for recording, querying, and visualizing metrics along a new “step” axis (x coordinate), providing increased flexibility for examining model performance relative to training progress. For example, you can now record performance metrics as a function of the number of training iterations or epochs. MLflow 1.0’s enhanced metrics UI enables you to visualize the change in a metric’s value as a function of its step, augmenting MLflow’s existing UI for plotting a metric’s value as a function of wall-clock time. (#1202, #1237, @dbczumar; #1132, #1142, #1143, @smurching; #1211, #1225, @Zangr; #1372, @stbof)\n- Search improvements. MLflow 1.0 includes additional support in both the API and UI for searching runs within a single experiment or a group of experiments. The search filter API supports a simplified version of the `SQL WHERE` clause. In addition to searching using run's metrics and params, the API has been enhanced to support a subset of run attributes as well as user and [system tags](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#system-tags). For details see [Search syntax](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/search-syntax.html#syntax) and [examples for programmatically searching runs](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/search-syntax.html#programmatically-searching-runs). (#1245, #1272, #1323, #1326, @mparkhe; #1052, @Zangr; #1363, @aarondav)\n- Logging metrics in batches. MLflow 1.0 now has a `runs/log-batch` REST API endpoint for logging multiple metrics, params, and tags in a single API request. The endpoint useful for performant logging of multiple metrics at the end of a model training epoch (see [example](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/bb8c7602dcb6a3a8786301fe6b98f01e8d3f288d/examples/hyperparam/search_hyperopt.py#L161)), or logging of many input model parameters at the start of training. You can call this batched-logging endpoint from Python (`mlflow.log_metrics`, `mlflow.log_params`, `mlflow.set_tags`), R (`mlflow_log_batch`), and Java (`MlflowClient.logBatch`). (#1214, @dbczumar; see 0.9.1 and 0.9.0 for other changes)\n- Windows support for MLflow Tracking. The Tracking portion of the MLflow client is now supported on Windows. (#1171, @eedeleon, @tomasatdatabricks)\n- HDFS support for artifacts. Hadoop artifact repository with Kerberos authorization support was added, so you can use HDFS to log and retrieve models and other artifacts. (#1011, @jaroslawk)\n- CLI command to build Docker images for serving. Added an `mlflow models build-docker` CLI command for building a Docker image capable of serving an MLflow model. The model is served at port 8080 within the container by default. Note that this API is experimental and does not guarantee that the arguments nor format of the Docker container will remain the same. (#1329, @smurching, @tomasatdatabricks)\n- New `onnx` model flavor for saving, loading, and evaluating ONNX models with MLflow. ONNX flavor APIs are available in the `mlflow.onnx` module. (#1127, @avflor, @dbczumar; #1388, #1389, @dbczumar)\n- Major breaking changes:\n\n  - Some of the breaking changes involve database schema changes in the SQLAlchemy tracking store. If your database instance's schema is not up-to-date, MLflow will issue an error at the start-up of `mlflow server` or `mlflow ui`. To migrate an existing database to the newest schema, you can use the `mlflow db upgrade` CLI command. (#1155, #1371, @smurching; #1360, @aarondav)\n  - [Installation] The MLflow Python package no longer depends on `scikit-learn`, `mleap`, or `boto3`. If you want to use the `scikit-learn` support, the `MLeap` support, or `s3` artifact repository / `sagemaker` support, you will have to install these respective dependencies explicitly. (#1223, @aarondav)\n  - [Artifacts] In the Models API, an artifact's location is now represented as a URI. See the [documentation](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#artifact-locations) for the list of accepted URIs. (#1190, #1254, @dbczumar; #1174, @dbczumar, @sueann; #1206, @tomasatdatabricks; #1253, @stbof)\n\n    - The affected methods are:\n\n      - Python: `<model-type>.load_model`, `azureml.build_image`, `sagemaker.deploy`, `sagemaker.run_local`, `pyfunc._load_model_env`, `pyfunc.load_pyfunc`, and `pyfunc.spark_udf`\n      - R: `mlflow_load_model`, `mlflow_rfunc_predict`, `mlflow_rfunc_serve`\n      - CLI: `mlflow models serve`, `mlflow models predict`, `mlflow sagemaker`, `mlflow azureml` (with the new `--model-uri` option)\n\n    - To allow referring to artifacts in the context of a run, MLflow introduces a new URI scheme of the form `runs:/<run_id>/relative/path/to/artifact`. (#1169, #1175, @sueann)\n\n  - [CLI] `mlflow pyfunc` and `mlflow rfunc` commands have been unified as `mlflow models` (#1257, @tomasatdatabricks; #1321, @dbczumar)\n  - [CLI] `mlflow artifacts download`, `mlflow artifacts download-from-uri` and `mlflow download` commands have been consolidated into `mlflow artifacts download` (#1233, @sueann)\n  - [Runs] Expose `RunData` fields (`metrics`, `params`, `tags`) as dictionaries. Note that the `mlflow.entities.RunData` constructor still accepts lists of `metric`/`param`/`tag` entities. (#1078, @smurching)\n  - [Runs] Rename `run_uuid` to `run_id` in Python, Java, and REST API. Where necessary, MLflow will continue to accept `run_uuid` until MLflow 1.1. (#1187, @aarondav)\n\nOther breaking changes\n\nCLI:\n\n- The `--file-store` option is deprecated in `mlflow server` and `mlflow ui` commands. (#1196, @smurching)\n- The `--host` and `--gunicorn-opts` options are removed in the `mlflow ui` command. (#1267, @aarondav)\n- Arguments to `mlflow experiments` subcommands, notably `--experiment-name` and `--experiment-id` are now options (#1235, @sueann)\n- `mlflow sagemaker list-flavors` has been removed (#1233, @sueann)\n\nTracking:\n\n- The `user` property of `Run`s has been moved to tags (similarly, the `run_name`, `source_type`, `source_name` properties were moved to tags in 0.9.0). (#1230, @acroz; #1275, #1276, @aarondav)\n- In R, the return values of experiment CRUD APIs have been updated to more closely match the REST API. In particular, `mlflow_create_experiment` now returns a string experiment ID instead of an experiment, and the other APIs return NULL. (#1246, @smurching)\n- `RunInfo.status`'s type is now string. (#1264, @mparkhe)\n- Remove deprecated `RunInfo` properties from `start_run`. (#1220, @aarondav)\n- As deprecated in 0.9.1 and before, the `RunInfo` fields `run_name`, `source_name`, `source_version`, `source_type`, and `entry_point_name` and the `SearchRuns` field `anded_expressions` have been removed from the REST API and Python, Java, and R tracking client APIs. They are still available as tags, documented in the REST API documentation. (#1188, @aarondav)\n\nModels and deployment:\n\n- In Python, require arguments as keywords in `log_model`, `save_model` and `add_to_model` methods in the `tensorflow` and `mleap` modules to avoid breaking changes in the future (#1226, @sueann)\n- Remove the unsupported `jars` argument from ``spark.log_model` in Python (#1222, @sueann)\n- Introduce `pyfunc.load_model` to be consistent with other Models modules. `pyfunc.load_pyfunc` will be deprecated in the near future. (#1222, @sueann)\n- Rename `dst_path` parameter in `pyfunc.save_model` to `path` (#1221, @aarondav)\n- R flavors refactor (#1299, @kevinykuo)\n\n  - `mlflow_predict()` has been added in favor of `mlflow_predict_model()` and `mlflow_predict_flavor()` which have been removed.\n  - `mlflow_save_model()` is now a generic and `mlflow_save_flavor()` is no longer needed and has been removed.\n  - `mlflow_predict()` takes `...` to pass to underlying predict methods.\n  - `mlflow_load_flavor()` now has the signature `function(flavor, model_path)` and flavor authors should implement `mlflow_load_flavor.mlflow_flavor_{FLAVORNAME}`. The flavor argument is inferred from the inputs of user-facing `mlflow_load_model()` and does not need to be explicitly provided by the user.\n\nProjects:\n\n- Remove and rename some `projects.run` parameters for generality and consistency. (#1222, @sueann)\n- In R, the `mlflow_run` API for running MLflow projects has been modified to more closely reflect the Python `mlflow.run` API. In particular, the order of the `uri` and `entry_point` arguments has been reversed and the `param_list` argument has been renamed to `parameters`. (#1265, @smurching)\n\nR:\n\n- Remove `mlflow_snapshot` and `mlflow_restore_snapshot` APIs. Also, the `r_dependencies` argument used to specify the path to a packrat r-dependencies.txt file has been removed from all APIs. (#1263, @smurching)\n- The `mlflow_cli` and `crate` APIs are now private. (#1246, @smurching)\n\nEnvironment variables:\n\n- Prefix environment variables with \"MLFLOW\\_\" (#1268, @aarondav). Affected variables are:\n\n  - [Tracking] `_MLFLOW_SERVER_FILE_STORE`, `_MLFLOW_SERVER_ARTIFACT_ROOT`, `_MLFLOW_STATIC_PREFIX`\n  - [SageMaker] `MLFLOW_SAGEMAKER_DEPLOY_IMG_URL`, `MLFLOW_DEPLOYMENT_FLAVOR_NAME`\n  - [Scoring] `MLFLOW_SCORING_SERVER_MIN_THREADS`, `MLFLOW_SCORING_SERVER_MAX_THREADS`\n\nMore features and improvements\n\n- [Tracking] Non-default driver support for SQLAlchemy backends: `db+driver` is now a valid tracking backend URI scheme (#1297, @drewmcdonald; #1374, @mparkhe)\n- [Tracking] Validate backend store URI before starting tracking server (#1218, @luke-zhu, @sueann)\n- [Tracking] Add `GetMetricHistory` client API in Python and Java corresponding to the REST API. (#1178, @smurching)\n- [Tracking] Add `view_type` argument to `MlflowClient.list_experiments()` in Python. (#1212, @smurching)\n- [Tracking] Dictionary values provided to `mlflow.log_params` and `mlflow.set_tags` in Python can now be non-string types (e.g., numbers), and they are automatically converted to strings. (#1364, @aarondav)\n- [Tracking] R API additions to be at parity with REST API and Python (#1122, @kevinykuo)\n- [Tracking] Limit number of results returned from `SearchRuns` API and UI for faster load (#1125, @mparkhe; #1154, @andrewmchen)\n- [Artifacts] To avoid having many copies of large model files in serving, `ArtifactRepository.download_artifacts` no longer copies local artifacts (#1307, @andrewmchen; #1383, @dbczumar)\n- [Artifacts/Projects] Support GCS in download utilities. `gs://bucket/path` files are now supported by the `mlflow artifacts download` CLI command and as parameters of type `path` in MLProject files. (#1168, @drewmcdonald)\n- [Models] All Python models exported by MLflow now declare `mlflow` as a dependency by default. In addition, we introduce a flag `--install-mlflow` users can pass to `mlflow models serve` and `mlflow models predict` methods to force installation of the latest version of MLflow into the model's environment. (#1308, @tomasatdatabricks)\n- [Models] Update model flavors to lazily import dependencies in Python. Modules that define Model flavors now import extra dependencies such as `tensorflow`, `scikit-learn`, and `pytorch` inside individual _methods_, ensuring that these modules can be imported and explored even if the dependencies have not been installed on your system. Also, the `DEFAULT_CONDA_ENVIRONMENT` module variable has been replaced with a `get_default_conda_env()` function for each flavor. (#1238, @dbczumar)\n- [Models] It is now possible to pass extra arguments to `mlflow.keras.load_model` that will be passed through to `keras.load_model`. (#1330, @yorickvP)\n- [Serving] For better performance, switch to `gunicorn` for serving Python models. This does not change the user interface.

We have also included a one breaking API change in preparation for additions in MLflow 1.0 and later. This release also includes significant improvements to the Search API.\n\nBreaking changes:\n\n- [Tracking] Generalized experiment_id to string (from a long) to be more permissive of different ID types in different backend stores. While breaking for the REST API, this change is backwards compatible for python and R clients. (#1067, #1034 @eedeleon)\n\nMore features and improvements:\n\n- [Search/API] Moving search filters into a query string based syntax, with Java client, Python client, and UI support. This also improves quote, period, and special character handling in query strings and adds the ability to search on tags in filter string. (#1042, #1055, #1063, #1068, #1099, #1106 @mparkhe; #1025 @andrewmchen; #1060 @smurching)\n- [Tracking] Limits and validations to batch-logging APIs in OSS server (#958 @smurching)\n- [Tracking/Java] Java client API for batch-logging (#1081 @mparkhe)\n- [Tracking] Improved consistency of handling multiple metric values per timestamp across tracking stores (#972, #999 @dbczumar)\n\nBug fixes and documentation updates:\n\n- [Tracking/Python] Reintroduces the parent_run_id argument to MlflowClient.create_run. This API is planned for removal in MLflow 1.0 (#1137 @smurching)\n- [Tracking/Python] Provide default implementations of AbstractStore log methods (#1051 @acroz)\n- [R] (Released on CRAN as MLflow 0.9.0.1) Small bug fixes with R (#1123 @smurching; #1045, #1017, #1019, #1039, #1048, #1098, #1101, #1107, #1108, #1119 @tomasatdatabricks)\n\nSmall bug fixes and doc updates (#1024, #1029 @bayethiernodiop; #1075 @avflor; #968, #1010, #1070, #1091, #1092 @smurching; #1004, #1085 @dbczumar; #1033, #1046 @sueann; #1053 @tomasatdatabricks; #987 @hanyucui; #935, #941 @jimthompson5802; #963 @amilbourne; #1016 @andrewmchen; #991 @jaroslawk; #1007 @mparkhe)\n\n## 0.9.0.1 (2019-04-09)\n\nBugfix release (PyPI only) with the following changes:\n\n- Rebuilt MLflow JS assets to fix an issue where form input was broken in MLflow 0.9.0 (identified\n  in #1056, #1113 by @shu-yusa, @timothyjlaurent)\n\n  0.9.0 (2019-03-13)\n\nMajor features:\n\n- Support for running MLflow Projects in Docker containers. This allows you to include non-Python dependencies in their project environments and provides stronger isolation when running projects. See the [Projects documentation](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/projects.html) for more information. (#555, @marcusrehm; #819, @mparkhe; #970, @dbczumar)\n- Database stores for the MLflow Tracking Server. Support for a scalable and performant backend store was one of the top community requests. This feature enables you to connect to local or remote SQLAlchemy-compatible databases (currently supported flavors include MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and MS SQL) and is compatible with file backed store. See the [Tracking Store documentation](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#storage) for more information. (#756, @AndersonReyes; #800, #844, #847, #848, #860, #868, #975, @mparkhe; #980, @dbczumar)\n- Simplified custom Python model packaging. You can easily include custom preprocessing and postprocessing logic, as well as data dependencies in models with the `python_function` flavor using updated `mlflow.pyfunc` Python APIs. For more information, see the [Custom Python Models documentation](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#custom-python-models). (#791, #792, #793, #830, #910, @dbczumar)\n- Plugin systems allowing third party libraries to extend MLflow functionality. The [proposal document](https://gist.github.com/zblz/9e337a55a7ba73314890be68370fa69a) gives the full detail of the three main changes:\n\n  - You can register additional providers of tracking stores using the `mlflow.tracking_store` entrypoint. (#881, @zblz)\n  - You can register additional providers of artifact repositories using the `mlflow.artifact_repository` entrypoint. (#882, @mociarain)\n  - The logic generating run metadata from the run context (e.g. `source_name`, `source_version`) has been refactored into an extendable system of run context providers. Plugins can register additional providers using the `mlflow.run_context_provider` entrypoint, which add to or overwrite tags set by the base library. (#913, #926, #930, #978, @acroz)\n\n- Support for HTTP authentication to the Tracking Server in the R client. Now you can connect to secure Tracking Servers using credentials set in environment variables, or provide custom plugins for setting the credentials. As an example, this release contains a Databricks plugin that can detect existing Databricks credentials to allow you to connect to the Databricks Tracking Server. (#938, #959, #992, @tomasatdatabricks)\n\nBreaking changes:\n\n- [Scoring] The `pyfunc` scoring server now expects requests with the `application/json` content type to contain json-serialized pandas dataframes in the split format, rather than the records format. See the [documentation on deployment](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#deploy-a-python-function-model-as-a-local-rest-api-endpoint) for more detail. (#960, @dbczumar) Also, when reading the pandas dataframes from JSON, the scoring server no longer automatically infers data types as it can result in unintentional conversion of data types (#916, @mparkhe).\n- [API] Remove `GetMetric` & `GetParam` from the REST API as they are subsumed by `GetRun`. (#879, @aarondav)\n\nMore features and improvements:\n\n- [UI] Add a button for downloading artifacts (#967, @mateiz)\n- [CLI] Add CLI commands for runs: now you can `list`, `delete`, `restore`, and `describe` runs through the CLI (#720, @DorIndivo)\n- [CLI] The `run` command now can take `--experiment-name` as an argument, as an alternative to the `--experiment-id` argument. You can also choose to set the `_EXPERIMENT_NAME_ENV_VAR` environment variable instead of passing in the value explicitly. (#889, #894, @mparkhe)\n- [Examples] Add Image classification example with Keras. (#743, @tomasatdatabricks )\n- [Artifacts] Add `get_artifact_uri()` and `_download_artifact_from_uri` convenience functions (#779)\n- [Artifacts] Allow writing Spark models directly to the target artifact store when possible (#808, @smurching)\n- [Models] PyTorch model persistence improvements to allow persisting definitions and dependencies outside the immediate scope:\n  - Add a `code_paths` parameter to `mlflow.pytorch.save_model` and `mlflow.pytorch.log_model` to allow external module dependencies to be specified as paths to python files. (#842, @dbczumar)\n  - Improve `mlflow.pytorch.save_model` to capture class definitions from notebooks and the `__main__` scope (#851, #861, @dbczumar)\n- [Runs/R] Allow client to infer context info when creating new run in fluent API (#958, @tomasatdatabricks)\n- [Runs/UI] Support Git Commit hyperlink for Gitlab and Bitbucket. Previously the clickable hyperlink was generated only for Github pages. (#901)\n- [Search]/API] Allow param value to have any content, not just alphanumeric characters, `.`, and `-` (#788, @mparkhe)\n- [Search/API] Support \"filter\" string in the `SearchRuns` API. Corresponding UI improvements are planned for the future (#905, @mparkhe)\n- [Logging] Basic support for LogBatch. NOTE: The feature is currently experimental and the behavior is expected to change in the near future. (#950, #951, #955, #1001, @smurching)\n\nBug fixes and documentation updates:\n\n- [Artifacts] Fix empty-file upload to DBFS in `log_artifact` and `log_artifacts` (#895, #818, @smurching)\n- [Artifacts] S3 artifact store: fix path resolution error when artifact root is bucket root (#928, @dbczumar)\n- [UI] Fix a bug with Databricks notebook URL links (#891, @smurching)\n- [Export] Fix for missing run name in csv export (#864, @jimthompson5802)\n- [Example] Correct missing tensorboardX module error in PyTorch example when running in MLflow Docker container (#809, @jimthompson5802)\n- [Scoring/R] Fix local serving of rfunc models (#874, @kevinykuo)\n- [Docs] Improve flavor-specific documentation in Models documentation (#909, @dbczumar)\n\nSmall bug fixes and doc updates (#822, #899, #787, #785, #780, #942, @hanyucui; #862, #904, #954, #806, #857, #845, @stbof; #907, #872, @smurching; #896, #858, #836, #859, #923, #939, #933, #931, #952, @dbczumar; #880, @zblz; #876, @acroz; #827, #812, #816, #829, @jimthompson5802; #837, #790, #897, #974, #900, @mparkhe; #831, #798, @aarondav; #814, @sueann; #824, #912, @mateiz; #922, #947, @tomasatdatabricks; #795, @KevYuen; #676, @mlaradji; #906, @4n4nd; #777, @tmielika; #804, @alkersan)\n\n## 0.8.2 (2019-01-28)\n\nMLflow 0.8.2 is a patch release on top of 0.8.1 containing only bug fixes and no breaking changes or features.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n- [Python API] CloudPickle has been added to the set of MLflow library dependencies, fixing missing import errors when attempting to save models (#777, @tmielika)\n- [Python API] Fixed a malformed logging call that prevented `mlflow.sagemaker.push_image_to_ecr()` invocations from succeeding (#784, @jackblandin)\n- [Models] PyTorch models can now be saved with code dependencies, allowing model classes to be loaded successfully in new environments (#842, #836, @dbczumar)\n- [Artifacts] Fixed a timeout when logging zero-length files to DBFS artifact stores (#818, @smurching)\n\nSmall docs updates (#845, @stbof; #840, @grahamhealy20; #839, @wilderrodrigues)\n\n## 0.8.1 (2018-12-21)\n\nMLflow 0.8.1 introduces several significant improvements:\n\n- Improved UI responsiveness and load time, especially when displaying experiments containing hundreds to thousands of runs.\n- Improved visualizations, including interactive scatter plots for MLflow run comparisons\n- Expanded support for scoring Python models as Spark UDFs. For more information, see the [updated documentation for this feature](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#export-a-python-function-model-as-an-apache-spark-udf).\n- By default, saved models will now include a Conda environment specifying all of the dependencies necessary for loading them in a new environment.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- [API/CLI] Support for running MLflow projects from ZIP files (#759, @jmorefieldexpe)\n- [Python API] Support for passing model conda environments as dictionaries to `save_model` and `log_model` functions (#748, @dbczumar)\n- [Models] Default Anaconda environments have been added to many Python model flavors. By default, models produced by `save_model` and `log_model` functions will include an environment that specifies all of the versioned dependencies necessary to load and serve the models. Previously, users had to specify these environments manually. (#705, #707, #708, #749, @dbczumar)\n- [Scoring] Support for synchronous deployment of models to SageMaker (#717, @dbczumar)\n- [Tracking] Include the Git repository URL as a tag when tracking an MLflow run within a Git repository (#741, @whiletruelearn, @mateiz)\n- [UI] Improved runs UI performance by using a react-virtualized table to optimize row rendering (#765, #762, #745, @smurching)\n- [UI] Significant performance improvements for rendering run metrics, tags, and parameter information (#764, #747, @smurching)\n- [UI] Scatter plots, including run comparsion plots, are now interactive (#737, @mateiz)\n- [UI] Extended CSRF support by allowing the MLflow UI server to specify a set of expected headers that clients should set when making AJAX requests (#733, @aarondav)\n\nBug fixes and documentation updates:\n\n- [Python/Scoring] MLflow Python models that produce Pandas DataFrames can now be evaluated as Spark UDFs correctly. Spark UDF outputs containing multiple columns of primitive types are now supported (#719, @tomasatdatabricks)\n- [Scoring] Fixed a serialization error that prevented models served with Azure ML from returning Pandas DataFrames (#754, @dbczumar)\n- [Docs] New example demonstrating how the MLflow REST API can be used to create experiments and log run information (#750, kjahan)\n- [Docs] R documentation has been updated for clarity and style consistency (#683, @stbof)\n- [Docs] Added clarification about user setup requirements for executing remote MLflow runs on Databricks (#736, @andyk)\n\nSmall bug fixes and doc updates (#768, #715, @smurching; #728, dodysw; #730, mshr-h; #725, @kryptec; #769, #721, @dbczumar; #714, @stbof)\n\n## 0.8.0 (2018-11-08)\n\nMLflow 0.8.0 introduces several major features:\n\n- Dramatically improved UI for comparing experiment run results:\n\n  - Metrics and parameters are by default grouped into a single column, to avoid an explosion of mostly-empty columns. Individual metrics and parameters can be moved into their own column to help compare across rows.\n  - Runs that are \"nested\" inside other runs (e.g., as part of a hyperparameter search or multistep workflow) now show up grouped by their parent run, and can be expanded or collapsed altogether. Runs can be nested by calling `mlflow.start_run` or `mlflow.run` while already within a run.\n  - Run names (as opposed to automatically generated run UUIDs) now show up instead of the run ID, making comparing runs in graphs easier.\n  - The state of the run results table, including filters, sorting, and expanded rows, is persisted in browser local storage, making it easier to go back and forth between an individual run view and the table.\n\n- Support for deploying models as Docker containers directly to Azure Machine Learning Service Workspace (as opposed to the previously-recommended solution of Azure ML Workbench).\n\nBreaking changes:\n\n- [CLI] `mlflow sklearn serve` has been removed in favor of `mlflow pyfunc serve`, which takes the same arguments but works against any pyfunc model (#690, @dbczumar)\n\nFeatures:\n\n- [Scoring] pyfunc server and SageMaker now support the pandas \"split\" JSON format in addition to the \"records\" format. The split format allows the client to specify the order of columns, which is necessary for some model formats. We recommend switching client code over to use this new format (by sending the Content-Type header `application/json; format=pandas-split`), as it will become the default JSON format in MLflow 0.9.0. (#690, @dbczumar)\n- [UI] Add compact experiment view (#546, #620, #662, #665, @smurching)\n- [UI] Add support for viewing & tracking nested runs in experiment view (#588, @andrewmchen; #618, #619, @aarondav)\n- [UI] Persist experiments view filters and sorting in browser local storage (#687, @smurching)\n- [UI] Show run name instead of run ID when present (#476, @smurching)\n- [Scoring] Support for deploying Models directly to Azure Machine Learning Service Workspace (#631, @dbczumar)\n- [Server/Python/Java] Add `rename_experiment` to Tracking API (#570, @aarondav)\n- [Server] Add `get_experiment_by_name` to RestStore (#592, @dmarkhas)\n- [Server] Allow passing gunicorn options when starting mlflow server (#626, @mparkhe)\n- [Python] Cloudpickle support for sklearn serialization (#653, @dbczumar)\n- [Artifacts] FTP artifactory store added (#287, @Shenggan)\n\nBug fixes and documentation updates:\n\n- [Python] Update TensorFlow integration to match API provided by other flavors (#612, @dbczumar;

#560, @andrewmchen)\n- [UI] UI no longer throws an error if all experiments are deleted (#605, @andrewmchen)\n- [Docs] Include diagram of workflow for multistep example (#581, @dennyglee)\n- [Docs] Add reference tags and R and Java APIs to tracking documentation (#514, @stbof)\n- [Docs/R] Use CRAN installation (#686, @javierluraschi)\n\nSmall bug fixes and doc updates (#576, #594, @javierluraschi;

#548 @kevinykuo)\n- [UI] Add support for adding notes to Runs (#396, @aadamson)\n- [Python] Python API, REST API, and UI support for deleting Runs (#418, #473, #526, #579 @andrewmchen)\n- [Python] Set a tag containing the branch name when executing a branch of a Git project (#469, @adrian555)\n- [Python] Add a set_experiment API to activate an experiment before starting runs (#462, @mparkhe)\n- [Python] Add arguments for specifying a parent run to tracking & projects APIs (#547, @andrewmchen)\n- [Java] Add Java set tag API (#495, @smurching)\n- [Python] Support logging a conda environment with sklearn models (#489, @dbczumar)\n- [Scoring] Support downloading MLflow scoring JAR from Maven during scoring container build (#507, @dbczumar)\n\nBug fixes:\n\n- [Python] Print errors when the Databricks run fails to start (#412, @andrewmchen)\n- [Python] Fix Spark ML PyFunc loader to work on Spark driver (#480, @tomasatdatabricks)\n- [Python] Fix Spark ML load_pyfunc on distributed clusters (#490, @tomasatdatabricks)\n- [Python] Fix error when downloading artifacts from a run's artifact root (#472, @dbczumar)\n- [Python] Fix DBFS upload file-existence-checking logic during Databricks project execution (#510, @smurching)\n- [Python] Support multi-line and unicode tags (#502, @mparkhe)\n- [Python] Add missing DeleteExperiment, RestoreExperiment implementations in the Python REST API client (#551, @mparkhe)\n- [Scoring] Convert Spark DataFrame schema to an MLeap schema prior to serialization (#540, @dbczumar)\n- [UI] Fix bar chart always showing in metric view (#488, @smurching)\n\nSmall bug fixes and doc updates (#467 @drorata; #470, #497, #508, #518 @dbczumar; #455, #466, #492, #504, #527 @aarondav; #481, #475, #484, #496, #515, #517, #498, #521, #522, #573 @smurching; #477 @parkerzf; #494 @jainr; #501, #531, #532, #552 @mparkhe;

The [examples](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/tree/master/examples) subdirectory has also been revamped to make it easier to jump in, and examples demonstrating multistep workflows and hyperparameter tuning have been added.\n\nBreaking changes:\n\nWe fixed a few inconsistencies in the the `mlflow.tracking` API, as introduced in 0.5.0:\n\n- `MLflowService` has been renamed `MlflowClient` (#461, @mparkhe)\n- You get an `MlflowClient` by calling `mlflow.tracking.MlflowClient()` (previously, this was `mlflow.tracking.get_service()`) (#461, @mparkhe)\n- `MlflowService.list_runs` was changed to `MlflowService.list_run_infos` to reflect the information actually returned by the call. It now returns a `RunInfo` instead of a `Run` (#334, @aarondav)\n- `MlflowService.log_artifact` and `MlflowService.log_artifacts` now take a `run_id` instead of `artifact_uri`. This now matches `list_artifacts` and `download_artifacts` (#444, @aarondav)\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Java client API added with support for the MLflow Tracking API (analogous to `mlflow.tracking`), allowing users to create and manage experiments, runs, and artifacts. The release includes a [usage example](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/mlflow/java/client/src/main/java/org/mlflow/tracking/samples/QuickStartDriver.java>)and [Javadocs](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/java_api/index.html).

The examples now reside in `examples/` instead of `example/`, too (#399, @mparkhe)\n- Small bug fixes and doc updates (#328, #363, @ToonKBC; #336, #411, @aarondav; #284, @smurching; #377, @mparkhe; #389, gioa; #408, @aadamson; #397, @vfdev-5; #420, @adrian555; #459, #463, @stbof)\n\n## 0.5.2 (2018-08-24)\n\nMLflow 0.5.2 is a patch release on top of 0.5.1 containing only bug fixes and no breaking changes or features.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n- Fix a bug with ECR client creation that caused `mlflow.sagemaker.deploy()` to fail when searching for a deployment Docker image (#366, @dbczumar)\n\n## 0.5.1 (2018-08-23)\n\nMLflow 0.5.1 is a patch release on top of 0.5.0 containing only bug fixes and no breaking changes or features.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n- Fix `with mlflow.start_run() as run` to actually set `run` to the created Run (previously, it was None) (#322, @tomasatdatabricks)\n- Fixes to DBFS artifactory to throw an exception if logging an artifact fails (#309) and to mimic FileStore's behavior of logging subdirectories (#347, @andrewmchen)\n- Fix for Python 3.7 support with tarfiles (#329, @tomasatdatabricks)\n- Fix spark.load_model not to delete the DFS tempdir (#335, @aarondav)\n- MLflow UI now appropriately shows entrypoint if it's not main (#345, @aarondav)\n- Make Python API forward-compatible with newer server versions of protos (#348, @aarondav)\n- Improved API docs (#305, #284, @smurching)\n\n## 0.5.0 (2018-08-17)\n\nMLflow 0.5.0 offers some major improvements, including Keras and PyTorch first-class support as models, SFTP support as an artifactory, a new scatterplot visualization to compare runs, and a more complete Python SDK for experiment and run management.\n\nBreaking changes:\n\n- The Tracking API has been split into two pieces, a \"basic logging\" API and a \"tracking service\" API. The \"basic logging\" API deals with logging metrics, parameters, and artifacts to the currently-active active run, and is accessible in `mlflow` (e.g., `mlflow.log_param`). The tracking service API allow managing experiments and runs (especially historical runs) and is available in `mlflow.tracking`. The tracking service API will look analogous to the upcoming R and Java Tracking Service SDKs. Please be aware of the following breaking changes:\n\n  - `mlflow.tracking` no longer exposes the basic logging API, only `mlflow`. So, code that was written like `from mlflow.tracking import log_param` will have to be `from mlflow import log_param` (note that almost all examples were already doing this).\n  - Access to the service API goes through the `mlflow.tracking.get_service()` function, which relies on the same tracking server set by either the environment variable `MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI` or by code with `mlflow.tracking.set_tracking_uri()`. So code that used to look like `mlflow.tracking.get_run()` will now have to do `mlflow.tracking.get_service().get_run()`. This does not apply to the basic logging API.\n  - `mlflow.ActiveRun` has been converted into a lightweight wrapper around `mlflow.entities.Run` to enable the Python `with` syntax. This means that there are no longer any special methods on the object returned when calling `mlflow.start_run()`. These can be converted to the service API.\n\n  - The Python entities returned by the tracking service API are now accessible in `mlflow.entities` directly. Where previously you may have used `mlflow.entities.experiment.Experiment`, you would now just use `mlflow.entities.Experiment`. The previous version still exists, but is deprecated and may be hidden in a future version.\n\n- REST API endpoint `/ajax-api/2.0/preview/mlflow/artifacts/get` has been moved to `$static_prefix/get-artifact`. This change is coversioned in the JavaScript, so should not be noticeable unless you were calling the REST API directly (#293, @andremchen)\n\nFeatures:\n\n- [Models] Keras integration: we now support logging Keras models directly in the log_model API, model format, and serving APIs (#280, @ToonKBC)\n- [Models] PyTorch integration: we now support logging PyTorch models directly in the log_model API, model format, and serving APIs (#264, @vfdev-5)\n- [UI] Scatterplot added to \"Compare Runs\" view to help compare runs using any two metrics as the axes (#268, @ToonKBC)\n- [Artifacts] SFTP artifactory store added (#260, @ToonKBC)\n- [Sagemaker] Users can specify a custom VPC when deploying SageMaker models (#304, @dbczumar)\n- Pyfunc serialization now includes the Python version, and warns if the major version differs (can be suppressed by using `load_pyfunc(suppress_warnings=True)`) (#230, @dbczumar)\n- Pyfunc serve/predict will activate conda environment stored in MLModel. This can be disabled by adding `--no-conda` to `mlflow pyfunc serve` or `mlflow pyfunc predict` (#225, @0wu)\n- Python SDK formalized in `mlflow.tracking`. This includes adding SDK methods for `get_run`, `list_experiments`, `get_experiment`, and `set_terminated`. (#299, @aarondav)\n- `mlflow run` can now be run against projects with no `conda.yaml` specified. By default, an empty conda environment will be created -- previously, it would just fail. You can still pass `--no-conda` to avoid entering a conda environment altogether (#218, @smurching)\n\nBug fixes:\n\n- Fix numpy array serialization for int64 and other related types, allowing pyfunc to return such results (#240, @arinto)\n- Fix DBFS artifactory calling `log_artifacts` with binary data (#295, @aarondav)\n- Fix Run Command shown in UI to reproduce a run when the original run is targeted at a subdirectory of a Git repo (#294, @adrian555)\n- Filter out ubiquitious dtype/ufunc warning messages (#317, @aarondav)\n- Minor bug fixes and documentation updates (#261, @stbof; #279, @dmatrix; #313, @rbang1, #320, @yassineAlouini; #321, @tomasatdatabricks; #266, #282, #289, @smurching; #267, #265, @aarondav; #256, #290, @ToonKBC; #273, #263, @mateiz; #272, #319, @adrian555; #277, @aadamson; #283, #296, @andrewmchen)\n\n## 0.4.2 (2018-08-07)\n\nBreaking changes: None\n\nFeatures:\n\n- MLflow experiments REST API and `mlflow experiments create` now support providing `--artifact-location` (#232, @aarondav)\n- [UI] Runs can now be sorted by columns, and added a Select All button (#227, @ToonKBC)\n- Databricks File System (DBFS) artifactory support added (#226, @andrewmchen)\n- databricks-cli version upgraded to >= 0.8.0 to support new DatabricksConfigProvider interface (#257, @aarondav)\n\nBug fixes:\n\n- MLflow client sends REST API calls using snake_case instead of camelCase field names (#232, @aarondav)\n- Minor bug fixes (#243, #242, @aarondav; #251, @javierluraschi; #245, @smurching; #252, @mateiz)\n\n## 0.4.1 (2018-08-03)\n\nBreaking changes: None\n\nFeatures:\n\n- [Projects] MLflow will use the conda installation directory given by the `$MLFLOW_CONDA_HOME`\n  if specified (e.g. running conda commands by invoking `$MLFLOW_CONDA_HOME/bin/conda`), defaulting\n  to running \"conda\" otherwise. (#231, @smurching)\n- [UI] Show GitHub links in the UI for projects run from http(s):// GitHub URLs (#235, @smurching)\n\nBug fixes:\n\n- Fix GCSArtifactRepository issue when calling list_artifacts on a path containing nested directories (#233, @jakeret)\n- Fix Spark model support when saving/loading models to/from distributed filesystems (#180, @tomasatdatabricks)\n- Add missing mlflow.version import to sagemaker module (#229, @dbczumar)\n- Validate metric, parameter and run IDs in file store and Python client (#224, @mateiz)\n- Validate that the tracking URI is a remote URI for Databricks project runs (#234, @smurching)\n- Fix bug where we'd fetch git projects at SSH URIs into a local directory with the same name as\n  the URI, instead of into a temporary directory (#236, @smurching)\n\n## 0.4.0 (2018-08-01)\n\nBreaking changes:\n\n- [Projects] Removed the `use_temp_cwd` argument to `mlflow.projects.run()`\n  (`--new-dir` flag in the `mlflow run` CLI). Runs of local projects now use the local project\n  directory as their working directory. Git projects are still fetched into temporary directories\n  (#215, @smurching)\n- [Tracking] GCS artifact storage is now a pluggable dependency (no longer installed by default).\n  To enable GCS support, install `google-cloud-storage` on both the client and tracking server via pip.\n  (#202, @smurching)\n- [Tracking] Clients running MLflow 0.4.0 and above require a server running MLflow 0.4.0\n  or above, due to a fix that ensures clients no longer double-serialize JSON into strings when\n  sending data to the server (#200, @aarondav). However, the MLflow 0.4.0 server remains\n  backwards-compatible with older clients (#216, @aarondav)\n\nFeatures:\n\n- [Examples] Add a more advanced tracking example: using MLflow with PyTorch and TensorBoard (#203)\n- [Models] H2O model support (#170, @ToonKBC)\n- [Projects] Support for running projects in subdirectories of Git repos (#153, @juntai-zheng)\n- [SageMaker] Support for specifying a compute specification when deploying to SageMaker (#185, @dbczumar)\n- [Server] Added --static-prefix option to serve UI from a specified prefix to MLflow UI and server (#116, @andrewmchen)\n- [Tracking] Azure blob storage support for artifacts (#206, @mateiz)\n- [Tracking] Add support for Databricks-backed RestStore (#200, @aarondav)\n- [UI] Enable productionizing frontend by adding CSRF support (#199, @aarondav)\n- [UI] Update metric and parameter filters to let users control column order (#186, @mateiz)\n\nBug fixes:\n\n- Fixed incompatible file structure returned by GCSArtifactRepository (#173, @jakeret)\n- Fixed metric values going out of order on x axis (#204, @mateiz)\n- Fixed occasional hanging behavior when using the projects.run API (#193, @smurching)\n\n- Miscellaneous bug and documentation fixes from @aarondav, @andrewmchen, @arinto, @jakeret, @mateiz, @smurching, @stbof\n\n## 0.3.0 (2018-07-18)\n\nBreaking changes:\n\n- [MLflow Server] Renamed `--artifact-root` parameter to `--default-artifact-root` in `mlflow server` to better reflect its purpose (#165, @aarondav)\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Spark MLlib integration: we now support logging SparkML Models directly in the log_model API, model format, and serving APIs (#72, @tomasatdatabricks)\n- Google Cloud Storage is now supported as an artifact storage root (#152, @bnekolny)\n- Support asychronous/parallel execution of MLflow runs (#82, @smurching)\n- [SageMaker] Support for deleting, updating applications deployed via SageMaker (#145, @dbczumar)\n- [SageMaker] Pushing the MLflow SageMaker container now includes the MLflow version that it was published with (#124, @sueann)\n- [SageMaker] Simplify parameters to SageMaker deploy by providing sane defaults (#126, @sueann)\n- [UI] One-element metrics are now displayed as a bar char (#118, @cryptexis)\n\nBug fixes:\n\n- Require gitpython>=2.1.0 (#98, @aarondav)\n- Fixed TensorFlow model loading so that columns match the output names of the exported model (#94, @smurching)\n- Fix SparkUDF when number of columns >= 10 (#97, @aarondav)\n- Miscellaneous bug and documentation fixes from @emres, @dmatrix, @stbof, @gsganden, @dennyglee, @anabranch, @mikehuston, @andrewmchen, @juntai-zheng\n\n## 0.2.1 (2018-06-28)\n\nThis is a patch release fixing some smaller issues after the 0.2.0 release.\n\n- Switch protobuf implementation to C, fixing a bug related to tensorflow/mlflow import ordering (issues #33 and #77, PR #74, @andrewmchen)\n- Enable running mlflow server without git binary installed (#90, @aarondav)\n- Fix Spark UDF support when running on multi-node clusters (#92, @aarondav)\n\n## 0.2.0 (2018-06-27)\n\n- Added `mlflow server` to provide a remote tracking server. This is akin to `mlflow ui` with new options:\n\n  - `--host` to allow binding to any ports (#27, @mdagost)\n  - `--artifact-root` to allow storing artifacts at a remote location, S3 only right now (#78, @mateiz)\n  - Server now runs behind gunicorn to allow concurrent requests to be made (#61, @mateiz)\n\n- TensorFlow integration: we now support logging TensorFlow Models directly in the log_model API, model format, and serving APIs (#28, @juntai-zheng)\n- Added `experiments.list_experiments` as part of experiments API (#37, @mparkhe)\n- Improved support for unicode strings (#79, @smurching)\n- Diabetes progression example dataset and training code (#56, @dennyglee)\n- Miscellaneous bug and documentation fixes from @Jeffwan, @yupbank, @ndjido, @xueyumusic, @manugarri, @tomasatdatabricks, @stbof, @andyk, @andrewmchen, @jakeret, @0wu, @aarondav\n\n## 0.1.0 (2018-06-05)\n\n- Initial version of mlflow.\n"

          "content": "### Evaluation Criteria\n\nWhen evaluating potential new MLflow committers, the following criteria will be considered:\n\n- **Code Contributions**: Should have multiple non-trivial code contributions accepted and committed to the MLflow codebase. This demonstrates the ability to produce quality code aligned with the project's standards.\n- **Technical Expertise**: Should demonstrate a deep understanding of MLflow's architecture and design principles, evidenced by making appropriate design choices and technical recommendations. History of caring about code quality, testing, maintainability, and ability to critically evaluate technical artifacts (PRs, designs, etc.) and provide constructive suggestions for improvement.\n- **Subject Matter Breadth**: Contributions and learnings span multiple areas of the codebase, APIs, and integration points rather than a narrow niche.\n- **Community Participation**: Active participation for at least 3 months prior to nomination by authoring code contributions and engaging in the code review process. Involvement in mailing lists, Slack channels, Stack Overflow, and GitHub issues is valued but not strictly required.\n- **Communication**: Should maintain a constructive tone in communications, be receptive to feedback, and collaborate well with existing committers and other community members.\n- **Project Commitment**: Demonstrate commitment to MLflow's long-term success, uphold project principles and values, and willingness to pitch in for \"unglamorous\" work.\n\n### Committership Nomination\n\n- Any current MLflow committer can nominate a contributor for committership by emailing MLflow's TSC members with a nomination packet.\n- The nomination packet should provide details on the nominee's salient contributions, as well as justification on how they meet the evaluation criteria. Links to GitHub activity, mailing list threads, and other artifacts should be included.\n- In addition to the nominator, every nomination must have a seconder -- a separate committer who advocates for the nominee. The seconder should be a more senior committer (active committer for >1 year) familiar with the nominee's work.\n- It is the nominator's responsibility to identify a willing seconder and include their recommendation in the nomination packet.\n- If no eligible seconder is available or interested, it may indicate insufficient support to proceed with the nomination at that time. This ensures there are two supporting committers invested in each nomination - the nominator and the seconder. The seconder's seniority and familiarity with the situation also help build more consensus among the TSC members during evaluation.\n\n### Evaluation Process\n\n- When a committer nomination is made, the TSC members closely review the proposal and evaluate the nominee's qualifications.\n- Throughout the review, the nominator is responsible for addressing any questions from the TSC, and providing clarification or additional evidence as requested by TSC members.\n- After adequate discussion (~1 week), the nominator calls for a formal consensus check among the TSC.\n- A positive consensus requires at least 2 TSC +1 binding votes and no vetoes.\n- Any vetoes must be accompanied by a clear rationale that can be debated.\n- If consensus is not achieved, the nomination is rejected at that time.\n- If consensus fails, the nominator summarizes substantive feedback and remaining gaps to the nominee for their growth and potential re-nomination later. Nomination can be tried again in 3 months after addressing any gaps identified.\n\n### Onboarding a new committer\n\n- Upon a positive consensus being reached, one of the TSC members will extend the formal invitation to the nominee to become a committer. They also field the private initial response from the nominee on willingness to accept.\n- If the proposal is accepted, the nominator grants them the commit access and the new committer will be:\n  - Added to the committer list in the README.md\n  - Announced on the MLflow mailing lists, Slack channels, and the MLflow website\n  - Spotlighted through a post on the MLflow LinkedIn and X handles\n- The nominator will work with the new committer to identify well-scoped initial areas for the new committer to focus on, such as improvements to a specific component.\n- The nominator will also set up periodic 1:1 mentorship check-ins with the new committer over their first month to provide guidance where needed.\n"

This is particularly important for [significant\nchanges](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#write-designs-for-significant-changes),\nand will typically be labeled during triage with `needs design`.\n\nAfter you have agreed upon an implementation strategy for your feature\nor patch with an MLflow committer, the next step is to introduce your\nchanges (see [developing\nchanges](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#developing-and-testing-mlflow))\nas a pull request against the MLflow Repository (we recommend pull\nrequests be filed from a non-master branch on a repository fork) or as a\nstandalone MLflow Plugin. MLflow committers actively review pull\nrequests and are also happy to provide implementation guidance for\nPlugins.\n\nOnce your pull request against the MLflow Repository has been merged,\nyour corresponding changes will be automatically included in the next\nMLflow release. Every change is listed in the MLflow release notes and\n[Changelog](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).\n\nCongratulations, you have just contributed to MLflow. We appreciate your\ncontribution\\!\n\n## Contribution guidelines\n\nIn this section, we provide guidelines to consider as you develop new\nfeatures and patches for MLflow.\n\n### Write designs for significant changes\n\nFor significant changes to MLflow, we recommend outlining a design for\nthe feature or patch and discussing it with an MLflow committer before\ninvesting heavily in implementation. During issue triage, we try to\nproactively identify issues require design by labeling them with `needs design`. This is particularly important if your proposed implementation:\n\n- Introduces changes or additions to the [MLflow REST\n  API](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/rest-api.html)\n  - The MLflow REST API is implemented by a variety of open source\n    and proprietary platforms. Changes to the REST API impact all of\n    these platforms. Accordingly, we encourage developers to\n    thoroughly explore alternatives before attempting to introduce\n    REST API changes.\n- Introduces new user-facing MLflow APIs\n  - MLflow's API surface is carefully designed to generalize across\n    a variety of common ML operations. It is important to ensure\n    that new APIs are broadly useful to ML developers, easy to work\n    with, and simple yet powerful.\n- Adds new library dependencies to MLflow\n- Makes changes to critical internal abstractions. Examples include:\n  the Tracking Artifact Repository, the Tracking Abstract Store, and\n  the Model Registry Abstract Store.\n\n### Make changes backwards compatible\n\nMLflow's users rely on specific platform and API behaviors in their\ndaily workflows. As new versions of MLflow are developed and released,\nit is important to ensure that users' workflows continue to operate as\nexpected. Accordingly, please take care to consider backwards\ncompatibility when introducing changes to the MLflow code base. If you\nare unsure of the backwards compatibility implications of a particular\nchange, feel free to ask an MLflow committer or community member for\ninput.\n\nIn addition to public APIs, any Python APIs within MLflow that are designated with the\nannotation `@developer_stable` must remain backwards compatible. Any contribution\nthat adds features, modifies behavior, or otherwise changes the functionality within the\nscope of these classes or methods will be closely reviewed by maintainers, and additional\nbackwards compatibility testing may be requested.\n\n### Consider introducing new features as MLflow Plugins\n\n[MLflow Plugins](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/plugins.html) enable\nintegration of third-party modules with many of MLflow’s components,\nallowing you to maintain and iterate on certain features independently\nof the MLflow Repository. Before implementing changes to the MLflow code\nbase, consider whether your feature might be better structured as an\nMLflow Plugin. MLflow Plugins are a great choice for the following types\nof changes:\n\n1.  Supporting a new storage platform for MLflow artifacts\n2.  Introducing a new implementation of the MLflow Tracking backend\n    ([Abstract\n    Store](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/cdc6a651d5af0f29bd448d2c87a198cf5d32792b/mlflow/store/tracking/abstract_store.py))\n    for a particular platform\n3.  Introducing a new implementation of the Model Registry backend\n    ([Abstract\n    Store](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/cdc6a651d5af0f29bd448d2c87a198cf5d32792b/mlflow/store/model_registry/abstract_store.py))\n    for a particular platform\n4.  Automatically capturing and recording information about MLflow Runs\n    created in specific environments\n\nMLflow committers and community members are happy to provide assistance\nwith the development and review of new MLflow Plugins.\n\nFinally, MLflow maintains a list of Plugins developed by community\nmembers, which is located at\n<https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/plugins.html#community-plugins>. This is\nan excellent way to inform MLflow users about your exciting new Plugins.\nTo list your plugin, simply introduce a new pull request against the\n[corresponding docs section of the MLflow code\nbase](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/cdc6a651d5af0f29bd448d2c87a198cf5d32792b/docs/source/plugins.rst#community-plugins).\n\nFor more information about Plugins, see\n<https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/plugins.html>.\n\n### Python Style Guide\n\n##### Docstrings\n\nWe follow [Google's Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)\nfor writing docstrings. Make sure your docstrings adhere to this style\nguide.\n\n###### Code Style\n\nWe use [prettier](https://prettier.io/),\n[blacken-docs](https://pypi.org/project/blacken-docs/), [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff), and\na number of custom lint checking scripts in our CI via\npre-commit Git hooks. If your code passes the CI checks, it's\nformatted correctly.\n\nTo validate that your local versions of the above libraries\nmatch those in the mlflow CI, refer to [lint-requirements.txt](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/requirements/lint-requirements.txt).\nYou can compare these versions with your local using pip:\n\n```bash\npip show ruff\n```\n\n## Setting up the repository\n\nTo set up the MLflow repository, run the following commands:\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repository\ngit clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:<username>/mlflow.git\n# The alternative way of cloning through https may cause permission error during branch push\n# git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/<username>/mlflow.git\n\n# Add the upstream repository\ncd mlflow\ngit remote add upstream git@github.com:mlflow/mlflow.git\n```\n\nIf you cloned the repository before without `--recurse-submodules`, run\nthis command to fetch submodules:\n\n```bash\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\n```\n\n## Developing and testing MLflow\n\nThe majority of the MLflow codebase is developed in Python. This\nincludes the CLI, Tracking Server, Artifact Repositories (e.g., S3 or\nAzure Blob Storage backends), and of course the Python fluent, tracking,\nand model APIs.\n\n### Environment Setup and Python configuration\n\nHaving a standardized development environment is advisable when working\non MLflow. Creating an environment that contains the required Python\npackages (and versions), linting tools, and environment configurations\nwill help to prevent unnecessary CI failures when filing a PR. A\ncorrectly configured local environment will also allow you to run tests\nlocally in an environment that mimics that of the CI execution\nenvironment.\n\nThere are three means of setting up a base Python development environment\nfor MLflow: GitHub Codespaces, automated (through the\n[dev-env-setup.sh](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/tree/master/dev/dev-env-setup.sh)\nscript) or manual. Even in a manual-based approach (i.e., testing\nfunctionality of a specific version of a model flavor's package\nversion), the automated script can save a great deal of time and reduce\nerrors in creating the environment.\n\n#### GitHub Codespaces\n\n<img src=\"./assets/create-codespace.png\" width=\"60%\"/>\n\n1. Navigate to https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow.git.\n2. Above the file list, click `Code`, then select `Create codespace` and wait for your codespace to be created.\n\nSee [Quickstart for GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/getting-started/quickstart) for more information.\n\n#### Automated Python development environment configuration\n\nThe automated development environment setup script\n([dev-env-setup.sh](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/tree/master/dev/dev-env-setup.sh))\ncan be used to setup a development environment that is configured with\nall of the dependencies required and the environment configuration\nneeded to develop and locally test the Python code portions of MLflow.\nThis CLI tool's readme can be accessed via the root of the mlflow\nrepository as follows:\n\n```bash\ndev/dev-env-setup.sh -h\n```\n\nAn example usage of this script that will build a development\nenvironment using `virtualenv` and the minimum supported Python version\n(to ensure compatibility) is:\n\n```bash\ndev/dev-env-setup.sh -d .venvs/mlflow-dev -q\n```\n\nThe `-q` parameter is to \"quiet\" the pip install processes preventing\nstdout printing during installation.\n\nIt is advised to follow all of the prompts to ensure that the\nconfiguration of the environment, as well as git, are completed so that\nyour PR process is as effortless as possible.\n\n**Note**\n\nFrequently, a specific version of a library is required in order to\nvalidate a feature's compatibility with older versions. Modifying your\nprimary development environment to test one-off compatibility can be\nvery error-prone and result in an environment that is significantly\ndifferent from that of the CI test environment. To support this use\ncase, the automated script can be used to create an environment that can\nbe easily modified to support testing a particular version of a model\nflavor in an isolated environment. Simply run the `dev-env-setup.sh`\nscript, activate the new environment, and install the required version\nfor testing.\n\n</div>\n\nExample of installing an older version of `scikit-learn` to perform\nisolated testing:\n\n```bash\ndev/dev-env-setup.sh -d ~/.venvs/sklearn-test -q\nsource ~/.venvs/sklearn-test/bin/activate\npip freeze | grep \"scikit-learn\"\n>> scikit-learn==1.0.2\npip install scikit-learn==1.0.1\npip freeze | grep \"scikit-learn\"\n>> scikit-learn==1.0.1\n```\n\n#### Manual Python development environment configuration\n\nThe manual process is recommended if you are going to use Conda or if\nyou are fond of terminal setup processes. To start with the manual\nprocess, ensure that you have either conda or virtualenv installed.\n\nFirst, ensure that your name and email are [configured in\ngit](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup)\nso that you can [sign your work](#sign-your-work) when committing code\nchanges and opening pull requests:\n\n```bash\ngit config --global user.name \"Your Name\"\ngit config --global user.email yourname@example.com\n```\n\nFor convenience, we provide a pre-commit git hook that validates that\ncommits are signed-off and runs `ruff check --fix` and `ruff format` to ensure the\ncode will pass the lint check for python. You can enable it by running:\n\n```bash\npre-commit install -t pre-commit -t prepare-commit-msg\n```\n\nThen, install the Python MLflow package from source - this is required\nfor developing & testing changes across all languages and APIs. We\nrecommend installing MLflow in its own conda environment by running the\nfollowing from your checkout of MLflow:\n\n```bash\nconda create --name mlflow-dev-env python=3.8\nconda activate mlflow-dev-env\npip install -e '.[extras]' # installs mlflow from current checkout with some useful extra utilities\n```\n\nIf you plan on doing development and testing, you will also need to\ninstall the following into the conda environment:\n\n```bash\npip install -r requirements/dev-requirements.txt\npip install -e '.[extras]'  # installs mlflow from current checkout\npip install -e tests/resources/mlflow-test-plugin # installs `mlflow-test-plugin` that is required for running certain MLflow tests\n```\n\nYou may need to run `conda install cmake` for the test requirements to\nproperly install, as `onnx` needs `cmake`.\n\nEnsure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is installed.\n\nFinally, we use `pytest` to test all Python contributed code. Install\n`pytest`:\n\n```bash\npip install pytest\n```\n\n### JavaScript and UI\n\nThe MLflow UI is written in JavaScript. `yarn` is required to run the\nJavascript dev server and the tracking UI. You can verify that `yarn` is\non the PATH by running `yarn -v`, and [install\nyarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install) if needed.\n\n#### Install Node Module Dependencies\n\nOn OSX, install the following packages required by the node modules:\n\n```bash\nbrew install pixman cairo pango jpeg\n```\n\nLinux/Windows users will need to source these dependencies using the\nappropriate package manager on their platforms.\n\n#### Install Node Modules\n\nBefore running the Javascript dev server or building a distributable\nwheel, install Javascript dependencies via:\n\n```bash\ncd mlflow/server/js\nyarn install\ncd - # return to root repository directory\n```\n\nIf modifying dependencies in `mlflow/server/js/package.json`, run `yarn upgrade` within `mlflow/server/js` to install the updated dependencies.\n\n#### Launching the Development UI\n\nWe recommend [Running the Javascript Dev\nServer](#running-the-javascript-dev-server) - otherwise, the tracking\nfrontend will request files in the `mlflow/server/js/build` directory,\nwhich is not checked into Git. Alternatively, you can generate the\nnecessary files in `mlflow/server/js/build` as described in [Building a\nDistributable Artifact](#building-a-distributable-artifact).\n\n#### Running the Javascript Dev Server\n\n[Install Node Modules](#install-node-modules), then run the following:\n\nIn one shell:\n\n```bash\nmlflow ui\n```\n\nIn another shell:\n\n```bash\ncd mlflow/server/js\nyarn start\n```\n\nThe Javascript Dev Server will run at <http://localhost:3000> and the\nMLflow server will run at <http://localhost:5000> and show runs logged\nin `./mlruns`.\n\n#### Launching MLflow UI with MLflow AI Gateway for PromptLab\n\n```sh\npython dev/server.py\n```\n\n#### Testing a React Component\n\nAdd a test file in the same directory as the newly created React\ncomponent. For example, `CompareRunBox.test.js` should be added in the\nsame directory as `CompareRunBox.js`. Next, in `mlflow/server/js`, run\nthe following command to start the test.\n\n```bash\n# Run tests in CompareRunBox.test.js\nyarn test CompareRunBox.test.js\n# Run tests with a name that matches 'plot' in CompareRunBox.test.js\nyarn test CompareRunBox.test.js -t 'plot'\n# Run all tests\nyarn test\n```\n\n#### Linting Javascript Code\n\nIn `mlflow/server/js`, run the following command to lint your code.\n\n```bash\n# Note this command only fixes auto-fixable issues (e.g. remove trailing whitespace)\nyarn lint:fix\n```\n\n### R\n\nIf contributing to MLflow's R APIs, install\n[R](https://cloud.r-project.org/) and make sure that you have satisfied\nall the [Environment Setup and Python configuration](#environment-setup-and-python-configuration).\n\nThe `mlflow/R/mlflow` directory contains R wrappers for the Projects,\nTracking and Models components. These wrappers depend on the Python\npackage, so first install the Python package in a conda environment:\n\n```bash\n# Note that we don't pass the -e flag to pip, as the R tests attempt to run the MLflow UI\n# via the CLI, which will not work if we run against the development tracking server\npip install .\n```\n\n[Install R](https://cloud.r-project.org/), then run the following to\ninstall dependencies for building MLflow locally:\n\n```bash\ncd mlflow/R/mlflow\nNOT_CRAN=true Rscript -e 'install.packages(\"devtools\", repos = \"https://cloud.r-project.org\")'\nNOT_CRAN=true Rscript -e 'devtools::install_deps(dependencies = TRUE)'\n```\n\nBuild the R client via:\n\n```bash\nR CMD build .\n```\n\nRun tests:\n\n```bash\nR CMD check --no-build-vignettes --no-manual --no-tests mlflow*tar.gz\ncd tests\nNOT_CRAN=true LINTR_COMMENT_BOT=false Rscript ../.run-tests.R\ncd -\n```\n\nRun linter:\n\n```bash\nRscript -e 'lintr::lint_package()'\n```\n\nIf opening a PR that makes API changes, please regenerate API\ndocumentation as described in [Writing Docs](#writing-docs) and commit\nthe updated docs to your PR branch.\n\nWhen developing, you can make Python changes available in R by running\n(from mlflow/R/mlflow):\n\n```bash\nRscript -e 'reticulate::conda_install(\"r-mlflow\", \"../../../.\", pip = TRUE)'\n```\n\nPlease also follow the recommendations from the [Advanced R - Style\nGuide](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html) regarding naming and styling.\n\n### Java\n\nIf contributing to MLflow's Java APIs or modifying Java documentation,\ninstall [Java](https://www.java.com/) and [Apache\nMaven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).\n\nCertain MLflow modules are implemented in Java, under the `mlflow/java/`\ndirectory. These are the Java Tracking API client (`mlflow/java/client`)\nand the Model Scoring Server for Java-based models like MLeap\n(`mlflow/java/scoring`).\n\nOther Java functionality (like artifact storage) depends on the Python\npackage, so first install the Python package in a conda environment as\ndescribed in [Environment Setup and Python configuration](#environment-setup-and-python-configuration).\n[Install](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)\nthe Java 8 JDK (or above), and\n[download](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and\n[install](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) Maven. You can then\nbuild and run tests via:\n\n```bash\ncd mlflow/java\nmvn compile test\n```\n\nIf opening a PR that makes API changes, please regenerate API\ndocumentation as described in [Writing Docs](#writing-docs) and commit\nthe updated docs to your PR branch.\n\n### Python\n\nIf you are contributing in Python, make sure that you have satisfied all\nthe [Environment Setup and Python configuration](#environment-setup-and-python-configuration), including installing\n`pytest`, as you will need it for the sections described below.\n\n#### Writing Python Tests\n\nIf your PR includes code that isn't currently covered by our tests (e.g.\nadding a new flavor, adding autolog support to a flavor, etc.), you\nshould write tests that cover your new code. Your tests should be added\nto the relevant file under `tests`, or if there is no appropriate file,\nin a new file prefixed with `test_` so that `pytest` includes that file\nfor testing.\n\nIf your tests require usage of a tracking URI, the [pytest\nfixture](https://docs.pytest.org/en/3.2.1/fixture.html)\n[tracking_uri_mock](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/tests/conftest.py#L74)\nis automatically set up for every tests. It sets up a mock tracking URI\nthat will set itself up before your test runs and tear itself down\nafter.\n\nBy default, runs are logged under a local temporary directory that's\nunique to each test and torn down immediately after test execution. To\ndisable this behavior, decorate your test function with\n`@pytest.mark.notrackingurimock`\n\n#### Running Python Tests\n\nVerify that the unit tests & linter pass before submitting a pull\nrequest by running:\n\nWe use [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) to ensure a\nconsistent code format. You can auto-format your code by running:\n\n```bash\nruff format .\nruff check .\n```\n\nThen, verify that the unit tests & linter pass before submitting a pull\nrequest by running:\n\n```bash\npre-commit run --all-files\npytest tests --quiet --requires-ssh --ignore-flavors --serve-wheel \\\n  --ignore=tests/examples --ignore=tests/recipes --ignore=tests/evaluate\n```\n\nWe use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/contents.html) to run\nPython tests. You can run tests for one or more test directories or\nfiles via `pytest [file_or_dir] ... [file_or_dir]`. For example, to run\nall pytest tests, you can run:\n\n```bash\npytest tests/pyfunc\n```\n\nNote: Certain model tests are not well-isolated (can result in OOMs when\nrun in the same Python process), so simply invoking `pytest` or `pytest tests` may not work. If you'd like to run multiple model tests, we\nrecommend doing so via separate `pytest` invocations, e.g. `pytest tests/sklearn && pytest tests/tensorflow`\n\nIf opening a PR that changes or adds new APIs, please update or add\nPython documentation as described in [Writing Docs](#writing-docs) and\ncommit the docs to your PR branch.\n\n#### Python Client\n\nFor the client, if you are adding new model flavors, follow the\ninstructions below.\n\n##### Python Model Flavors\n\nIf you are adding new framework flavor support, you'll need to modify\n`pytest` and Github action configurations so tests for your code can run\nproperly. Generally, the files you'll have to edit are:\n\n1.  `.github/workflows/master.yml`: lines where pytest runs with `--ignore-flavors` flag\n\n    1. Add your tests to the ignore list, where the other frameworks are\n       ignored\n    2. Add a pytest command for your tests along with the other framework\n       tests (as a separate command to avoid OOM issues)\n\n2.  `requirements/test-requirements.txt`: add your framework and version\n    to the list of requirements\n\nYou can see an example of a [flavor\nPR](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/pull/2136/files).\n\n#### Python Server\n\nFor the Python server, you can contribute in these two areas described\nbelow.\n\n##### Building Protobuf Files\n\nTo build protobuf files, simply run `python ./dev/generate_protos.py`. The required\n`protoc` version is `3.19.4`. You can find the URL of a\nsystem-appropriate installation of `protoc` at\n<https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/tag/v3.19.4>, e.g.\n<https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v3.19.4/protoc-3.19.4-osx-x86_64.zip>\nif you're on 64-bit Mac OSX.\n\nThen, run the following to install `protoc`:\n\n```bash\n# Update PROTOC_ZIP if on a platform other than 64-bit Mac OSX\nPROTOC_ZIP=protoc-3.19.4-osx-x86_64.zip\ncurl -OL https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v3.19.4/$PROTOC_ZIP\nsudo unzip -o $PROTOC_ZIP -d /usr/local bin/protoc\nsudo unzip -o $PROTOC_ZIP -d /usr/local 'include/*'\nrm -f $PROTOC_ZIP\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can build protobuf files using Docker:\n\n```bash\npushd dev\nDOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build -t gen-protos -f Dockerfile.protos .\npopd\ndocker run --rm \\\n  -v $(pwd)/mlflow/protos:/app/mlflow/protos \\\n  -v $(pwd)/mlflow/java/client/src/main/java:/app/mlflow/java/client/src/main/java \\\n  -v $(pwd)/generate-protos.sh:/app/generate-protos.sh \\\n  gen-protos ./generate-protos.sh\n```\n\nVerify that .proto files and autogenerated code are in sync by running\n`./dev/test-generate-protos.sh.`\n\n##### Database Schema Changes\n\nMLflow's Tracking component supports storing experiment and run data in\na SQL backend. To make changes to the tracking database schema, run the\nfollowing from your checkout of MLflow:\n\n```bash\n# starting at the root of the project\n$ pwd\n~/mlflow\n$ cd mlflow\n# MLflow relies on Alembic (https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org) for schema migrations.\n$ alembic -c mlflow/store/db_migrations/alembic.ini revision -m \"add new field to db\"\n  Generating ~/mlflow/mlflow/store/db_migrations/versions/b446d3984cfa_add_new_field_to_db.py\n# Update schema files\n$ ./tests/db/update_schemas.sh\n```\n\nThese commands generate a new migration script (e.g., at\n`~/mlflow/mlflow/alembic/versions/12341123_add_new_field_to_db.py`) that\nyou should then edit to add migration logic.\n\n### Developing inside a Docker container (experimental)\n\nInstead of setting up local or virtual environment, it's possible to\nwrite code and tests inside a Docker container that will contain an\nisolated Python environment setup inside. It's possible to build and run\npreconfigured image, then attach with the compatible code editor (e.g.\nVSCode) into a running container. This helps avoiding issues with local\nsetup, e.g. on CPU architectures that are not yet fully compatible with\nall dependency packages (e.g. Apple arm64 architecture).\n\n#### Prerequisites\n\n- Docker runtime installed on a local machine\n  (<https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/>)\n- Code editor compatible capable of running inside containers\n  - Example: VSCode (<https://code.visualstudio.com/download>) with\n    Remote Containers extension\n    (<https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers>)\n\n#### Setup\n\nRun the following command:\n\n```bash\ndev/run-test-container.sh\n```\n\nYou will need to wait until the docker daemon will complete building the\ndocker image. After successful build, the container will be\nautomatically run with `mlflow-test` name. A new shell session running\nin container's context will start in the terminal window, do not close\nit.\n\nNow you can attach to the running container with your code editor.\n\n- Instructions for VSCode:\n\n  - invoke the command palette (`[Ctrl/CMD]+Shift+P`)\n  - find \"Remote-Containers: Attach to Running Container...\" option,\n    confirm with `Enter` key\n  - find the \"mlflow-test\" container, confirm with `Enter` key\n  - a new code editor should appear running inside the context of\n    Docker container\n  - you can now freely change source code and corresponding tests,\n    the changes will be reflected on your machine filesystem\n  - to run code or tests inside container, you can open a terminal\n    with `` [Ctrl/CMD]+Shift+` `` and run any\n    command which will be executed inside container, e.g.\n    `pytest tests/test_version.py`\n\nAfter typing `exit` in the terminal window that executed\n`dev/run-test-container.sh`, the container will be shut down and\nremoved.\n\n### Writing MLflow Examples\n\nThe `mlflow/examples` directory has a collection of quickstart tutorials\nand various simple examples that depict MLflow tracking, project, model\nflavors, model registry, and serving use cases. These examples provide\ndevelopers sample code, as a quick way to learn MLflow Python APIs.\n\nTo facilitate review, strive for brief examples that reflect real user\nworkflows, document how to run your example, and follow the recommended\nsteps below.\n\nIf you are contributing a new model flavor, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Follow instructions in [Python Model Flavors](#python-model-flavors)\n2.  Create a corresponding directory in\n    `mlflow/examples/new-model-flavor`\n3.  Implement your Python training `new-model-flavor` code in this\n    directory\n4.  Convert this directory’s content into an [MLflow\n    Project](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/projects.html) executable\n5.  Add `README.md`, `MLproject`, and `conda.yaml` files and your code\n6.  Read instructions in the `mlflow/test/examples/README.md` and add a\n    `pytest` entry in the `test/examples/test_examples.py`\n7.  Add a short description in the `mlflow/examples/README.md` file\n\nIf you are contributing to the quickstart directory, we welcome changes\nto the `quickstart/mlflow_tracking.py` that make it clearer or simpler.\n\nIf you'd like to provide an example of functionality that doesn't fit\ninto the above categories, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Create a directory with meaningful name in\n    `mlflow/examples/new-program-name` and implement your Python code\n2.  Create `mlflow/examples/new-program-name/README.md` with\n    instructions how to use it\n3.  Read instructions in the `mlflow/test/examples/README.md`, and add a\n    `pytest` entry in the `test/examples/test_examples.py`\n4.  Add a short description in the `mlflow/examples/README.md` file\n\nFinally, before filing a pull request, verify all Python tests pass.\n\n### Building a Distributable Artifact\n\nIf you would like to build a fully functional version of MLflow from your local branch for testing or a local patch fix, first\n[install the Node Modules](#install-node-modules), then run the following:\n\nGenerate JS files in `mlflow/server/js/build`:\n\n```bash\ncd mlflow/server/js\nyarn build\n```\n\nBuild a pip-installable wheel and a compressed code archive in `dist/`:\n\n```bash\ncd -\npython -m build\n```\n\n### TOML formatting\n\nWe use [taplo](https://taplo.tamasfe.dev/) to enforce consistent TOML formatting. You can install it by following the instructions [here](https://taplo.tamasfe.dev/cli/introduction.html).\n\n### Writing Docs\n\nFirst, install dependencies for building docs as described in [Environment Setup and Python configuration](#environment-setup-and-python-configuration).\n\nBuilding documentation requires [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/index.html). It should have already been\ninstalled if you used the automated env setup script\n([dev-env-setup.sh](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/master/dev/dev-env-setup.sh)),\nbut if you are manually installing dependencies, please follow [the official instruction](https://pandoc.org/installing.html).\n\nAlso, check the version of your installation via `pandoc --version` and ensure it is 2.2.1 or above.\nIf you are using Mac OSX, be aware that the Homebrew installation of Pandoc may be outdated. If you are using Linux,\nyou should use a deb installer or install from the source, instead of running `apt` / `apt-get` commands. Pandoc package available on official\nrepositories is an older version and contains several bugs. You can find newer versions at <https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases>.\n\nTo generate a live preview of Python & other rst documentation, run the\nfollowing snippet. Note that R & Java API docs must be regenerated\nseparately after each change and are not live-updated; see subsequent\nsections for instructions on generating R and Java docs.\n\n```bash\ncd docs\nmake livehtml\n```\n\nGenerate R API rst doc files via:\n\n```bash\ncd docs\nmake rdocs\n```\n\n---\n\n**NOTE**\n\nIf you attempt to build the R documentation on an ARM-based platform (Apple silicon M1, M2, etc.)\nyou will likely get an error when trying to execute the Docker build process for the make command.\nTo address this, set the default docker platform environment variable as follows:\n\n```bash\nexport DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64\n```\n\n---\n\nGenerate Java API rst doc files via:\n\n```bash\ncd docs\nmake javadocs\n```\n\nGenerate API docs for all languages via:\n\n```bash\ncd docs\nmake html\n```\n\nGenerate only the main .rst based documentation:\n\n```bash\ncd docs\nmake rsthtml\n```\n\nIf changing existing Python APIs or adding new APIs under existing\nmodules, ensure that references to the modified APIs are updated in\nexisting docs under `docs/source`. Note that the Python doc generation\nprocess will automatically produce updated API docs, but you should\nstill audit for usages of the modified APIs in guides and examples.\n\nIf adding a new public Python module, create a corresponding doc file\nfor the module under `docs/source/python_api` - [see\nhere](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/blob/v0.9.1/docs/source/python_api/mlflow.tracking.rst#mlflowtracking)\nfor an example.\n\n> Note: If you are experiencing issues with rstcheck warning of failures in files that you did not modify, try:\n\n```bash\ncd docs\nmake clean; make html\n```\n\n### Sign your work\n\nIn order to commit your work, you need to sign that you wrote the patch\nor otherwise have the right to pass it on as an open-source patch.

          "content": "# Issue Policy\n\nThe MLflow Issue Policy outlines the categories of MLflow GitHub issues and discusses the guidelines & processes\nassociated with each type of issue.\n\nBefore filing an issue, make sure to [search for related issues](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues) and check if\nthey address yours.\n\nFor support (ex. \"How do I do X?\"), please ask on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\n\n## Issue Categories\n\nOur policy is that GitHub issues fall into one of the following categories:\n\n1. Feature Requests\n2. Bug reports\n3. Documentation fixes\n4. Installation issues\n\nEach category has its own GitHub issue template. Please do not delete the issue template unless you are certain your\nissue is outside its scope.\n\n### Feature Requests\n\n#### Guidelines\n\nFeature requests that are likely to be accepted:\n\n- Are minimal in scope (note that it's always easier to add additional functionality later than remove functionality)\n- Are extensible (e.g. if adding an integration with an ML framework, is it possible to add similar integrations with other frameworks?)\n- Have user impact & value that justifies the maintenance burden of supporting the feature moving forwards. The\n  [JQuery contributor guide](https://contribute.jquery.org/open-source/#contributing-something-new) has an excellent discussion on this.\n\n#### Lifecycle\n\nFeature requests typically go through the following lifecycle:\n\n1. A feature request GitHub Issue is submitted, which contains a high-level description of the proposal and its motivation.\n   We encourage requesters to provide an overview of the feature's implementation as well, if possible.\n2. The [issue is triaged](ISSUE_TRIAGE.rst) to identify whether more information is needed from the author, give an indication of priority, and route feature requests to appropriate committers.\n3. The feature request is discussed with a committer. The committer will provide input on the implementation overview or\n   ask for a more detailed design, if applicable.\n4. After discussion & agreement on the feature request and its implementation, an implementation owner is identified.\n5. The implementation owner begins developing the feature and ultimately files associated pull requests against the\n   MLflow Repository or packages the feature as an MLflow Plugin.\n\n### Bug reports\n\n#### Guidelines\n\nIn order to ensure that maintainers are able to assist in any reported bug:\n\n- Ensure that the bug report template is filled out in its entirety with appropriate levels of detail, particularly in the `Code to reproduce issue` section.\n- Verify that the bug you are reporting meets one of the following criteria:\n  - A recent release of MLflow does not support the operation you are doing that an earlier release did (a regression).\n  - A [documented feature](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html) or functionality does not work properly by executing a provided example from the docs.\n  - Any exception raised is directly from MLflow and is not the result of an underlying package's exception (e.g., don't file an issue that MLflow can't log a model that can't be trained due to a tensorflow Exception)\n- Make a best effort to diagnose and troubleshoot the issue prior to filing.\n- Verify that the environment that you're experiencing the bug in is supported as defined in the docs.\n- Validate that MLflow supports the functionality that you're having an issue with. _A lack of a feature does not constitute a bug_.\n- Read the docs on the feature for the issue that you're reporting. If you're certain that you're following documented guidelines, please file a bug report.\n\nBug reports typically go through the following lifecycle:\n\n1. A bug report GitHub Issue is submitted, which contains a high-level description of the bug and information required to reproduce it.\n2. The [bug report is triaged](ISSUE_TRIAGE.rst) to identify whether more information is needed from the author, give an indication of priority, and route to request appropriate committers.\n3. An MLflow committer reproduces the bug and provides feedback about how to implement a fix.\n4. After an approach has been agreed upon, an owner for the fix is identified. MLflow committers may choose to adopt\n   ownership of severe bugs to ensure a timely fix.\n5. The fix owner begins implementing the fix and ultimately files associated pull requests.\n\n### Documentation fixes\n\nDocumentation issues typically go through the following lifecycle:\n\n1. A documentation GitHub Issue is submitted, which contains a description of the issue and its location(s) in the MLflow documentation.\n2. The [issue is triaged](ISSUE_TRIAGE.rst) to identify whether more information is needed from the author, give an indication of priority, and route the request to appropriate committers.\n3. An MLflow committer confirms the documentation issue and provides feedback about how to implement a fix.\n4. After an approach has been agreed upon, an owner for the fix is identified. MLflow committers may choose to adopt\n   ownership of severe documentation issues to ensure a timely fix.\n5. The fix owner begins implementing the fix and ultimately files associated pull requests.\n\n### Installation issues\n\nInstallation issues typically go through the following lifecycle:\n\n1. An installation GitHub Issue is submitted, which contains a description of the issue and the platforms its affects.\n2. The [issue is triaged](ISSUE_TRIAGE.rst) to identify whether more information is needed from the author, give an indication of priority, and route the issue to appropriate committers.\n3. An MLflow committer confirms the installation issue and provides feedback about how to implement a fix.\n4. After an approach has been agreed upon, an owner for the fix is identified. MLflow committers may choose to adopt\n   ownership of severe installation issues to ensure a timely fix.\n5.

          "content": "\nThis document is a hands-on manual for doing issue and pull request triage for `MLflow issues\non GitHub <https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/issues>`_ .\nThe purpose of triage is to speed up issue management and get community members faster responses.\n\nIssue and pull request triage has three steps:\n\n- assign one or more process labels (e.g. ``needs design`` or ``help wanted``),\n- mark a priority, and\n- label one or more relevant areas, languages, or integrations to help route issues to appropriate contributors or reviewers.\n\nThe remainder of the document describes the labels used in each of these steps and how to apply them.\n\nAssign appropriate process labels\n#######\nAssign at least one process label to every issue you triage.\n\n- ``needs author feedback``: We need input from the author of the issue or PR to proceed.\n- | ``needs design``: This feature is large or tricky enough that we think it warrants a design doc\n  | and review before someone begins implementation.\n- | ``needs committer feedback``: The issue has a design that is ready for committer review, or there is\n  | an issue or pull request that needs feedback from a committer about the approach or appropriateness\n  | of the contribution.\n- | ``needs review``: Use this label for issues that need a more detailed design review or pull\n  | requests ready for review (all questions answered, PR updated if requests have been addressed,\n  | tests passing).\n- ``help wanted``: We would like community help for this issue.\n- ``good first issue``: This would make a good first issue.\n\n\nAssign priority\n#######\n\nYou should assign a priority to each issue you triage. We use `kubernetes-style <https://github.com/\nkubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/issue-triage.md#define-priority>`_ priority\nlabels.\n\n- | ``priority/critical-urgent``: This is the highest priority and should be worked on by\n  | somebody right now. This should typically be reserved for things like security bugs,\n  | regressions, release blockers.\n- | ``priority/important-soon``: The issue is worked on by the community currently or will\n  | be very soon, ideally in time for the next release.\n- | ``priority/important-longterm``: Important over the long term, but may not be staffed or\n  | may need multiple releases to complete. Also used for things we know are on a\n  | contributor's roadmap in the next few months. We can use this in conjunction with\n  | ``help wanted`` to mark issues we would like to get help with. If someone begins actively\n  | working on an issue with this label and we think it may be merged by the next release, change\n  | the priority to ``priority/important-soon``.\n- | ``priority/backlog``: We believe it is useful but don’t see it being prioritized in the\n  | next few months. Use this for issues that are lower priority than ``priority/important-longterm``.\n  | We welcome community members to pick up a ``priority/backlog`` issue, but there may be some\n  | delay in getting support through design review or pull request feedback.\n- | ``priority/awaiting-more-evidence``: Lowest priority. Possibly useful, but not yet enough\n  | support to actually get it done. This is a good place to put issues that could be useful but\n  | require more evidence to demonstrate broad value. Don’t use it as a way to say no.\n  | If we think it doesn’t fit in MLflow, we should just say that and why.\n\nLabel relevant areas\n#######\n\nAssign one more labels for relevant component or interface surface areas, languages, or\nintegrations. As a principle, we aim to have the minimal set of labels needed to help route issues\nand PRs to appropriate contributors. For example, a ``language/python`` label would not be\nparticularly helpful for routing issues to committers, since most PRs involve Python code.\n``language/java`` and ``language/r`` make sense to have, as the clients in these languages differ from the Python client and aren't maintained by many people. As with process labels, we\ntake inspiration from Kubernetes on naming conventions.\n\nComponents\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\n- ``area/artifacts``: Artifact stores and artifact logging\n- ``area/build``: Build and test infrastructure for MLflow\n- ``area/docs``: MLflow documentation pages\n- ``area/examples``: Example code\n- ``area/gateway``: AI Gateway service, Gateway client APIs, third-party Gateway integrations\n- ``area/model-registry``: Model Registry service, APIs, and the fluent client calls for Model Registry\n- ``area/models``: MLmodel format, model serialization/deserialization, flavors\n- ``area/recipes``: Recipes, Recipe APIs, Recipe configs, Recipe Templates\n- ``area/projects``: MLproject format, project execution backends\n- ``area/scoring``: MLflow Model server, model deployment tools, Spark UDFs\n- ``area/server-infra``: MLflow Tracking server backend\n- ``area/tracking``: Tracking Service, tracking client APIs, autologging\n\nInterface Surface\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\n- ``area/uiux``: Front-end, user experience, plotting, JavaScript, JavaScript dev server\n- ``area/docker``: Docker use across MLflow's components, such as MLflow Projects and MLflow Models\n- ``area/sqlalchemy``: Use of SQLAlchemy in the Tracking Service or Model Registry\n- ``area/windows``: Windows support\n\nLanguage Surface\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\n- ``language/r``: R APIs and clients\n- ``language/java``: Java APIs and clients\n- ``language/new``: Proposals for new client languages\n\nIntegrations\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\n- ``integrations/azure``: Azure and Azure ML integrations\n- ``integrations/sagemaker``: SageMaker integrations\n- ``integrations/databricks``: Databricks integrations\n"

An MLflow **Run** should be automatically created, which tracks the training dataset, hyper parameters, performance metrics, the trained model, dependencies, and even more.\n\n```\nmlflow ui\n```\n\n### Serving Models ([Doc](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/deployment/index.html))\n\nYou can deploy the logged model to a local inference server by a one-line command using the MLflow CLI. Visit the documentation for how to deploy models to other hosting platforms.\n\n```bash\nmlflow models serve --model-uri runs:/<run-id>/model\n```\n\n### Evaluating Models ([Doc](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/model-evaluation/index.html))\n\nThe following example runs automatic evaluation for question-answering tasks with several built-in metrics.\n\n```python\nimport mlflow\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Evaluation set contains (1) input question (2) model outputs (3) ground truth\ndf = pd.DataFrame(\n    {\n        \"inputs\": [\"What is MLflow?\", \"What is Spark?\"],\n        \"outputs\": [\n            \"MLflow is an innovative fully self-driving airship powered by AI.\",\n            \"Sparks is an American pop and rock duo formed in Los Angeles.\",\n        ],\n        \"ground_truth\": [\n            \"MLflow is an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning (ML) \"\n            \"lifecycle.\",\n            \"Apache Spark is an open-source, distributed computing system designed for big data \"\n            \"processing and analytics.\",\n        ],\n    }\n)\neval_dataset = mlflow.data.from_pandas(\n    df, predictions=\"outputs\", targets=\"ground_truth\"\n)\n\n# Start an MLflow Run to record the evaluation results to\nwith mlflow.start_run(run_name=\"evaluate_qa\"):\n    # Run automatic evaluation with a set of built-in metrics for question-answering models\n    results = mlflow.evaluate(\n        data=eval_dataset,\n        model_type=\"question-answering\",\n    )\n\nprint(results.tables[\"eval_results_table\"])\n```\n\n### Observability ([Doc](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/tracing/index.html))\n\nMLflow Tracing provides LLM observability for various GenAI libraries such as OpenAI, LangChain, LlamaIndex, DSPy, AutoGen, and more. To enable auto-tracing, call `mlflow.xyz.autolog()` before running your models. Refer to the documentation for customization and manual instrumentation.\n\n```python\nimport mlflow\nfrom openai import OpenAI\n\n# Enable tracing for OpenAI\nmlflow.openai.autolog()\n\n# Query OpenAI LLM normally\nresponse = OpenAI().chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4o-mini\",\n    messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hi!\"}],\n    temperature=0.1,\n)\n```\n\nThen navigate to the \"Traces\" tab in the MLflow UI to find the trace records OpenAI query.\n\n## Community\n\n- For help or questions about MLflow usage (e.g. \"how do I do X?\") visit the [docs](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html)\n  or [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mlflow).\n- Alternatively, you can ask the question to our AI-powered chat bot.
