In order for us to be able to accept your contributions,\nwe will need explicit confirmation from you that you are able and willing to provide them under\nthese terms, and the mechanism we use to do this is called a Developer's Certificate of Origin\n[(DCO)](https://github.com/bloomberg/.github/blob/main/DCO.md). This is very similar to the process\nused by the Linux kernel, Samba, and many other major open source projects.\n\nTo participate under these terms, all that you must do is include a line like the following as the\nlast line of the commit message for each commit in your contribution:\n\n    Signed-Off-By: Random J. Developer <random@developer.example.org>\n\nThe simplest way to accomplish this is to add `-s` or `--signoff` to your `git commit` command.\n\nYou must use your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms, and no anonymous contributions).\n\n## Documentation\n\n**Public** modules, functions, classes, and methods must be documented using [Python\ndocstrings][pep 257]. **Non-public** functions and methods must also be documented for defining the\nAPI contract. In addition to being useful for generating documentation, docstrings add clarity when\nlooking through the source code or using the [built-in help][builtin-help] system, and can be\nleveraged in autocompletion by IDEs.\n\nPlease see [PEP 257][] for details on semantics and conventions associated with Python docstrings.\n\n### Docstring style\n\nDocstrings must follow [Google style docstrings][google-style]. This docstring style is more\npleasant to read when browsing the source.\n\n## Type hints\n\nAll functions and methods should be type annotated. This allows for static analysis and more\nintelligent code completion from tools & IDEs.\n\n## Tests\n\nChanges should always include tests. If this is a bug fix it is a good idea to add the tests as the\nfirst commit of the pull request and the changes to fix the issue in subsequent commits to make it\neasier to validate it.\n\n## Pull requests\n\n### Linting your code\n\nBefore commiting anything, install the pre-commit hooks:\n\n```shell\npython3 -m pip install -r requirements-extra.txt\npre-commit install\n```\n\nThis will ensure that your contribution passes our linting checks.\n\n### PRs should be linked to a GitHub issue\n\nBefore opening a pull request to this repository, first please make sure there is a GitHub issue\nwhere your change has been discussed with the maintainers. Mention the issue number in your pull\nrequest description using one of the\n[supported keywords](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/). For example,\nadding `Closes: #100` in the pull request description will link the PR with the issue and GitHub\nwill automatically close the issue upon merging it.\n\nDo not include the issue reference in your commit messages however, add it only in the description\nof the PR.\n\n<!-- LINKS -->\n\n[pep 257]: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/ \"Docstring Conventions\"\n[pep 484]: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/ \"Type Hints\"\n[google-style]: https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html \"Example Google Style Python Docstrings\"\n[builtin-help]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#help\n\n<!--\nvim: tw=99:spell\n-->\n"

(#693)\n- Fix a crash when a greenlet switch happens after Memray's profile function has been deactivated or replaced. (#700)\n\n\nmemray 1.14.0 (2024-09-09)\n--------------------------\n\nFeatures\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- Wheels are now published for Python 3.13, though we don't yet support free-threaded (no GIL) builds. (#658)\n\n\nBug Fixes\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Fix a lock ordering deadlock in libc between a Memray lock and a lock internal to dlopen. (#549)\n- Ensure flame graphs stay in flame mode when the user has selected it.\n  Previously clicking the \"Hide Irrelevant Frames\" or \"Hide Import System Frames\"\n  checkboxes would switch the flame graph back to icicle mode. (#656)\n- Fix a race condition that was able to cause strange exception messages if two different threads tried to initialize Memray tracking at once. (#667)\n\n\nmemray 1.13.4 (2024-07-18)\n--------------------------\n\nBug Fixes\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n- A backwards-incompatible change released in Textual 0.73 caused the ``memray tree`` reporter to start with no nodes expanded. This release adds a workaround to restore the old behavior of expanding the first child of each node. (#648)\n\n\nmemray 1.13.3 (2024-07-02)\n--------------------------\n\nBug Fixes\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Fix a bug that could result in truncated reports for applications that fork without calling :c:func:`PyOS_BeforeFork`, including by using `multiprocessing` with the \"spawn\" start method (the default on macOS). (#644)\n\n\nmemray 1.13.2 (2024-06-27)\n--------------------------\n\nBug Fixes\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Fix a bug that could in rare circumstances result in a stack overflow while processing native mode stacks. (#639)\n\n\nMiscellaneous\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Upgrade our vendored copy of ``libbacktrace``, used for reporting native stacks, to the latest version. (#639)\n\n\nmemray 1.13.1 (2024-06-23)\n--------------------------\n\nBug Fixes\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Fix a deadlock that could occur on some Linux systems when resolving debug information using debuginfod. (#634)\n\n\nmemray 1.13.0 (2024-06-18)\n--------------------------\n\nFeatures\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- Add :doc:`a tutorial <tutorials/index>` to the Memray documentation. (#590)\n- Include the thread name in the live TUI. (#562)\n- Capture the name attribute of Python `threading.Thread` objects. (#562)\n- Allow using Ctrl+Z to suspend ``memray tree`` and the live mode TUI. (#581)\n- Add a button in the live-mode TUI to show allocations from all threads at once. (#589)\n- Vendor ``libdebuginfod`` into our Linux wheels, so that debuginfod integration can be used without any dependency on system-installed libraries. (#592)\n\n\nBug Fixes\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Fix dynamic toggling between descriptions like \"Pause\" vs \"Unpause\" or \"Show\" vs \"Hide\" in the footer of the live-mode TUI and tree reporter. This was broken by changes introduced in Textual 0.61 (and again by Textual 0.63). (#597)\n- Correctly localize the start and end time in the \"Stats\" modal when an HTML report was generated on a different machine than the one it is being displayed on. (#611)\n- Fix a crash in old macOS versions (<11.0) due to the inavailability of some linker cache APIs. (#615)\n- Fix reporting of \"Own Memory\" in the ``live`` and ``summary`` reporters. A bug in our summation caused us to undercount functions' direct allocations. (#617)\n\n\nMiscellaneous\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Builds from source now work for Python 3.13. Wheels are not yet published for 3.13 because it is not yet ABI stable. (#622)\n- Link our Linux wheels against the latest version of ``elfutils``. (#592)\n\n\nmemray 1.12.0 (2024-03-07)\n--------------------------\n\nFeatures\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- Allow ``--temporal`` and ``--max-memory-records`` to be used with our :ref:`Jupyter magic <Jupyter integration>`. (#538)\n- Automatically use aggregated capture files for the :ref:`Jupyter magic <Jupyter integration>` whenever possible, reducing the amount of disk space needed for temporary files. (#538)\n- Expose the main thread id in the FileReader's metadata attribute. (#560)\n\n\nBug Fixes\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Fix a bug that was causing ``dlopen`` to not load shared libraries that have an RPATH/RUNPATH set. (#525)\n- Fix a bug where the tree reporter would fail to populate the code pane with relevant lines if the line where the allocation occurred was too near the start of the file. (#544)\n- Fix a bug causing the first entry of ``sys.path`` to be erroneously overwritten by ``memray run`` when the Python interpreter was launched with the ``-I`` or ``-P`` flag, or when the ``PYTHONSAFEPATH`` environment variable was set. (#552)\n\n\nmemray 1.11.0 (2023-12-04)\n--------------------------\n\nFeatures\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- Migrate the  :doc:`live TUI <live>` to Textual. This provides a greatly improved user experience, including the ability to scroll to view rows that don't fit on the screen. (#274)\n- Add a new documentation page to serve as :ref:`an overview of memory concepts <memory overview>`, to help users better interpret the memory profiles provided by Memray. (#496)\n- Where possible, leverage ``pkg-config`` when building the extension from source, picking up appropriate compiler and linker flags automatically. (#498)\n- Port the tree reporter to be an interactive Textual App. (#499)\n\n\nBug Fixes\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Fixed a bug that caused ``memray attach`` to fail with newer LLDB versions, including on macOS Sonoma. (#490)\n- Limit the number of memory records displayed in reporters by default. This will help displaying flamegraphs for long capture sessions. (#491)\n- When generating a ``--leaks`` flamegraph, don't show a warning that the ``pymalloc`` allocator is in use if ``--trace-python-allocators`` was used when generating the capture file. (#492)\n- Ensure that we update our terminal progress bars to 100% when processing finishes. (#494)\n\n\nmemray 1.10.0 (2023-10-05)\n--------------------------\n\nFeatures\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- Add support for :ref:`inverted flame graphs`. In an inverted flame graph, the\n  roots are the functions that allocated memory, and the children of any given\n  node represent the percentage of that node's allocations that can be attributed\n  to a particular caller. The inverted flame graph is very helpful in analyzing\n  where memory is being spent in aggregate. You can generate one by passing the\n  ``--inverted`` flag to ``memray flamegraph``. (#439)\n- ``memray attach`` now supports ``--aggregate`` to produce :ref:`aggregated capture files <aggregated capture files>`. (#455)\n- ``memray attach`` has been enhanced to allow tracking for only a set period of\n  time. (#458)\n- A new ``memray detach`` command allows you to manually deactivate tracking that\n  was started by a previous call to ``memray attach``. (#458)\n- Python 3.12 is now supported. (#474)\n\n\nBug Fixes\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Update ``memray attach`` on Linux to prefer GDB over LLDB for injecting itself into the process being attached to. We've had several reports of problems with the Linux LLDB, and hope this change will help give Linux users a better experience by default. You can still explicitly use LLDB on Linux even when GDB is detected by running ``memray attach --method=lldb``. (#449)\n- Fix a memory leak in Memray itself when many different capture files are opened by a single Memray process and native stacks are being reported. This issue primarily affected ``pytest-memray``. (#473)\n- Fix a crash in MacOS Sonoma when using system Framework libraries, like when using the ``pyobjc`` library. (#477)\n\n\nmemray 1.9.1 (2023-08-01)\n-------------------------\n\nBug Fixes\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Fix an issue that stopped Memray's experimental support for ``greenlet`` from working with versions of the ``greenlet`` module older than 1.0. (#432)\n- Fix a bug leading to a deadlock when Memray is used to profile an application that uses the jemalloc implementation of ``malloc``. (#433)\n- Fix a bug causing the ``summary`` reporter to generate empty reports. (#435)\n\n\nmemray 1.9.0 (2023-07-28)\n-------------------------\n\nFeatures\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- Allow to report the current version of Memray via a ``--version/-V`` command line parameter (#420)\n- Add pause/unpause keybindings to the live reporter that allows the user to pause the live reporter to analyse the current results without pausing the running program (#418)\n\n\nBug Fixes\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Support building with Cython 3 (#425)\n\n\nmemray 1.8.1 (2023-06-20)\n-------------------------\n\nFeatures\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- When the high water mark being shown by a temporal flame graph is before the first memory snapshot or after the last one, tell the user so by highlighting a region beyond the end of the memory usage plot. (#399)\n\n\nBug Fixes\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Prevent a totally empty memory plot from being shown on flame graphs when the tracked process completes before any periodic memory snapshots are captured. (#399)\n- Fix a bug that prevented the temporal high water mark flame graph from showing the flame graph of a high water mark that occurred after the final periodic memory snapshot was captured. (#399)\n- Fix a bug that prevented Memray from intercepting functions in shared objects that are part of the dyld shared cache in macOS Ventura. (#401)\n\n\nmemray 1.8.0 (2023-06-09)\n-------------------------\n\nFeatures\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- Allow ``memray stats`` to output a JSON report via ``--json`` flag. (#377)\n- We now publish x86-64 musllinux_1_1 wheels, compatible with Alpine Linux. (#379)\n- We now support :ref:`temporal flame graphs`, which provide an exciting new way of analyzing your process's memory usage over time. (#391)\n\n\nBug Fixes\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Fix a bug where a non-import call on the same line as an ``import`` statement would be hidden by the \"Hide Import System Frames\" checkbox of a flame graph. (#329)\n- Fixed a bug that was hitting an assert when constructing hybrid stack frames in Python 3.11 when no eval symbols are available. (#334)\n- Change the font color used by the ``%%memray_flamegraph`` Jupyter magic's progress updates for better contrast on the JupyterLab dark theme. (#344)\n- Fix a bug that could result in a deadlock when tracking a process linked against an old version of musl libc. (#379)\n\n\nmemray 1.7.0 (2023-02-21)\n-------------------------\n\nFeatures\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- ``memray run`` now supports ``--aggregate`` to produce :ref:`aggregated capture files <aggregated capture files>`, which can be much smaller but aren't able to be used for generating every type of report. (#277)\n- Add integration with debuginfod to automatically download debug information for binaries if it is available. (#308)\n- Flame graphs produced by ``memray flamegraph`` are now around 85% smaller. (#314)\n\n\nBug Fixes\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n- ``memray run --live`` and ``memray run --live-remote`` silently dropped the ``--trace-python-allocators`` flag. This has been fixed, and the flag is now properly propagated from the CLI to the tracker. (#283)\n- Fix a bug that was causing Memray to crash when the Tracker is being destroyed and some other thread is still registering allocations or deallocations (#289)\n- Work around `a bug in GDB versions before 10.1 <https://sourceware.org/git/?p=binutils-gdb.git;a=commit;h=da1df1db9ae43050c8de62e4842428ddda7eb509>`_ that could cause ``memray attach`` to fail. (#310)\n- Work around `a bug in LLDB on Linux <https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/60408>`_ that could cause ``memray attach`` to hang. (#311)\n\n\nmemray 1.6.0 (2023-01-17)\n-------------------------\n\nFeatures\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- Speed up native allocation tracking by up to 45% (#294)\n\n\nBug Fixes\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n- ``memray run --live`` and ``memray run --live-remote`` silently dropped the ``--trace-python-allocators`` flag. This has been fixed, and the flag is now properly propagated from the CLI to the tracker. (#283)\n- Fix a bug that was causing Memray to crash when the Tracker is being destroyed and some other thread is still registering allocations or deallocations (#289)\n\n\nMemray 1.5.0 (2022-12-09)\n-------------------------\n\nFeatures\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- Memray is now fully supported on macOS, and the warnings that macOS support is experimental have been dropped. (#194)\n- Add a checkbox to flamegraphs that allows hiding frames from the import system (#261)\n- ``memray attach`` can be used to :doc:`attach to a running process <attach>` (#266)\n- Consider frames from the import system as \"irrelevant\" in the generated flamegraphs. (#268)\n\n\nmemray 1.4.1 (2022-11-11)\n-------------------------\n\nBug Fixes\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Fix a crash that can happen when two different threads try to register frames at the same time without the GIL held. (#251)\n\n\nmemray 1.4.0 (2022-10-31)\n-------------------------\n\nFeatures\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- Add a new ``transform`` subcomand that allows transforming Memray capture files into output files compatible with other tools. We're starting by supporting conversions to the *gprof2dot* format, which allows producing graph-like reports when combined with *graphviz*. (#200)\n- Added a new ``--temporary-allocations`` option to the ``flamegraph``, ``table``, ``tree``, and ``summary`` reporters for showing the :doc:`temporary allocations </temporary_allocations>` instead of the high water mark ones. (#201)\n- When the ``greenlet`` module is in use, also assign a distinct thread ID to each greenlet. Greenlets aren't threads, but they are distinct threads of execution within a single process, with distinct stacks, so assigning different thread IDs to each makes it easier to interpret reports where ``greenlet`` was used. (#209)\n- Use a monotonic counter to generate thread IDs, rather than using the pthread ID. Those pthread IDs can be reused, making it difficult to tell what thread performed an allocation. (#209)\n- Print a warning when we detect that the Python interpreter was built without debug information or without symbols, letting the user know in advance that these conditions may result in incorrect stack traces or missing filenames and line numbers. (#211)\n- A new ``%%memray_flamegraph`` Jupyter cell magic is provided by ``%load_ext memray``, and can be used to memory profile code directly in a Jupyter notebook. (#237)\n- Add ``csv`` as a possible target format for ``memray transform``, producing a report of all of the allocations that made up the process's high water mark of allocated memory. This CSV file can then be loaded and analyzed using libraries like ``pandas``. (#241)\n\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Up until now, if the program being profiled included a Cython module built with profiling support enabled, those Cython functions would show up in our Python call stacks. This was rarely useful in practice, as most Cython libraries aren't distributed with profiling support enabled, and supporting this had a surprisingly high maintenance cost. We've removed this integration, so you'll need to use ``--native`` mode to see inside of Cython modules. We are not considering this a backwards-incompatible change, since it does not affect any of our public interfaces (though it could affect the contents of reports generated by Memray). (#206)\n\n\nBug Fixes\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Fix a bug that caused incorrect ``--native`` mode stacks on Python 3.11 for allocations performed directly by the interpreter's eval loop. (#209)\n- Fix a crash when an extension module terminates the program using non-Python APIs under tracking. (#228)\n\n\nmemray 1.3.1 (2022-08-30)\n-------------------------\n\nBug Fixes\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Prevent a crash that could occur when forked processes that have been under tracking without ``follow_fork=True`` remove the profiling function with pending frames needed to be flushed to the results file. (#196)\n\n\nmemray 1.3.0 (2022-08-18)\n-------------------------\n\nFeatures\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- We now capture Python stacks for allocations made by threads that existed before the Memray tracker was started. (#130)\n- Add support for Python 3.11 (#138)\n- Add support for MacOS. (#174)\n- Add experimental support for Greenlet. (#185)\n\n\nBug Fixes\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Prevent a crash that could occur if the Memray API was used to stop and later restart tracking while another thread was running Python code. (#152)\n- Prevent a use-after-free bug that could result in a crash if ``sys.setprofile()`` was called while Memray was tracking. Now if ``sys.setprofile()`` is called, all future allocations on that thread will report unknown Python stacks, instead of potentially incorrect stacks. (#176)\n\n\nMemray 1.2.0 (2022-07-11)\n-------------------------\n\nFeatures\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- Add a progress bar indicator to the record processing phases in the different reporters so users can have an approximate idea of how much time processing the result files will take. (#111)\n- The ``memray stats`` reporter is now up to 50% faster, and its output is easier to interpret because it now processes all allocations by default. (#136)\n- Add a line showing the heap size over time to the memory plot in the html-based reporters (which already showed the resident size over time). (#142)\n\n\nDeprecations and Removals\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Remove the ``--include-all-allocations`` / ``-a`` argument to the ``memray stats`` reporter. Previously this was too slow to be used by default, but now that it has been sped up, it doesn't make sense to use anything else. The old default behavior of only processing allocations that made up the high water mark of the application's memory usage was confusing and misleading. (#136)\n\n\nBug Fixes\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Fix a crash with SIGBUS when the file system fills up while ``memray run`` is writing a capture file. (#117)\n- Recognize when a capture file has been truncated (most likely because the tracked process was killed unexpectedly) and ignore any incomplete record at the end of the file. (#129)\n- Fix the histogram used by the ``memray stats`` reporter to choose sane bin sizes when all captured allocations are the same size. (#133)\n- Fix the aggregation by location at the bottom of the ``memray stats`` report when the ``--include-all-allocations`` option is used. (#134)\n- Fix a bug causing deallocations with ``free`` and ``munmap`` to be included in the reported \"Total allocations\" count of ``memray stats --include-all-allocations``. (#136)\n- Fix the two \"largest allocating locations\" sections in the ``memray stats`` report to actually aggregate by location. Previously they were aggregating by distinct stacks, so if two different paths hit the same line of code, it would be counted separately instead of together. (#136)\n- Fix a bug causing memory freed by ``munmap`` to be incorrectly added into the reported \"Total memory allocated\" of ``memray stats --include-all-allocations``. (#136)\n- Exclude ``PYMALLOC_FREE`` from the allocator type distribution (other deallocators were already being ignored, but this recently added one was missed). (#136)\n- Fix the ``memray stats`` histogram to be based on the actual sizes of all allocations. Previously it only saw the sizes after a rollup by stack had already been performed, so it was binning allocation sizes that had already been summed. (#136)\n- Fixed a bug where aggregating native call stacks could give misleading results on aarch64 under some circumstances. (#141)\n- Fix a bug that made ``memray run --live -c`` fail if the command to run contained double quotes. (#147)\n- Ensure our TUI isn't displaying stale data by periodically flushing the latest available data from the tracker (rather than only flushing when a buffer fills up). (#147)\n- Fix the handling of the thread switch commands in the live mode TUI before the first allocation has been seen. (#147)\n\n\nmemray 1.1.0 (2022-05-16)\n-------------------------\n\nFeatures\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- Finalize and document the Memray :doc:`tracking API <api>`. (#42)\n- Ensure that wheels built by ``make dist`` are reproducible (so that running the build twice produces identical artifacts). (#47)\n- Reduce the size of the ``memray run`` capture file by around 20% by using a more efficient encoding for which allocator was used to perform a given allocation and whether we :ref:`captured a native stack <native tracking>` for that allocation. (#52)\n- Support ``memray run -c \"...\"`` to profile an in-line script provided on the command line. (#61)\n- The capture files produced by ``memray run`` are now around 90% smaller thanks to a more efficient encoding scheme for the binary files. (#67)\n- Add support for Alpine Linux and musl libc. (#75)\n- Capture allocations made through the C99 ``aligned_alloc`` function. (#79)\n- By default the capture file will now be compressed using LZ4 after tracking completes. This temporarily requires extra disk space while the compression runs, but results in roughly 75% less disk space required in the end. Compression can be disabled with ``--no-compress``. (#82)\n- Speed up tracking by around 5% by building with link-time optimization (LTO). (#91)\n- Add a new ``--trace-python-allocators`` option to ``memray run`` that allows tracking all allocations made using the Python allocators. This will result in bigger output files and slower profiling but it allows getting insights about all of the interpreter's memory allocations. (#92)\n\n\nBug Fixes\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Previously we attempted to read all allocation records into memory when processing a capture file in our reporters. This could fail on large files, so now we process the file in a streaming fashion instead. (#62)\n- Make ``memray run`` perform the same modifications to `sys.path` as the interpreter itself would when running a script. (#86)\n- Fixed a bug in the :doc:`stats reporter <stats>` that could result in the largest allocations being omitted from the histogram. (#95)\n- Fixed a bug that caused Memray reporters to display incorrect stacks when :ref:`native tracking` was enabled and native allocations from different locations occurred underneath the same Python stack. (#96)\n\n\nMiscellaneous\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Support the latest versions of Rich (previously we pinned to an old version due to some formatting changes in more recent versions). (#98)\n\n\nmemray 1.0.3 (2022-04-21)\n-------------------------\n\nFeatures\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- Add ``memray`` as a command line entry point. (#20)\n\nmemray 1.0.2 (2022-04-12)\n-------------------------\n\nFeatures\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- Add publishing of ManyLinux2010 wheels for 64 and 32 bit systems. (#2)\n\nBug Fixes\n~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Fix 32 bit builds. (#2)\n\n\nmemray 1.0.0 (2022-04-09)\n-------------------------\n\n-  Initial release.\n"

It can track memory allocations in Python code, in native extension\nmodules, and in the Python interpreter itself. It can generate several different types of reports to help you\nanalyze the captured memory usage data. While commonly used as a CLI tool, it can also be used as a library to\nperform more fine-grained profiling tasks.\n\nNotable features:\n\n- 🕵️‍♀️ Traces every function call so it can accurately represent the call stack, unlike sampling profilers.\n- ℭ Also handles native calls in C/C++ libraries so the entire call stack is present in the results.\n- 🏎 Blazing fast! Profiling slows the application only slightly. Tracking native code is somewhat slower,\n  but this can be enabled or disabled on demand.\n- 📈 It can generate various reports about the collected memory usage data, like flame graphs.\n- 🧵 Works with Python threads.\n- 👽🧵 Works with native-threads (e.g. C++ threads in C extensions).\n\nMemray can help with the following problems:\n\n- Analyze allocations in applications to help discover the cause of high memory usage.\n- Find memory leaks.\n- Find hotspots in code that cause a lot of allocations.\n\n> **Note**\n> Memray only works on Linux and MacOS, and cannot be installed on other platforms.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bloomberg/memray/main/docs/_static/images/quotes.png\" width=\"100%\">\n</p>\n\n# Help us improve Memray!\n\nWe are constantly looking for feedback from our awesome community ❤️. If you\nhave used Memray to solve a problem, profile an application, find a memory leak\nor anything else, please let us know! We would love to hear about your\nexperience and how Memray helped you.\n\nPlease, consider writing your story in the [Success\nStories discussion page](https://github.com/bloomberg/memray/discussions/226).\n\nIt really makes a difference!\n\n# Installation\n\nMemray requires Python 3.7+ and can be easily installed using most common Python\npackaging tools. We recommend installing the latest stable release from\n[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/memray/) with pip:\n\n```shell\n    python3 -m pip install memray\n```\n\nNotice that Memray contains a C extension so releases are distributed as binary\nwheels as well as the source code. If a binary wheel is not available for your system\n(Linux x86/x64 or macOS), you'll need to ensure that all the dependencies are satisfied on the\nsystem where you are doing the installation.\n\n## Building from source\n\nIf you wish to build Memray from source you need the following binary dependencies in your system:\n\n- libdebuginfod-dev (for Linux)\n- libunwind (for Linux)\n- liblz4\n\nCheck your package manager on how to install these dependencies (for example `apt-get install build-essential python3-dev libdebuginfod-dev libunwind-dev liblz4-dev` in Debian-based systems\nor `brew install lz4` in MacOS). Note that you may need to teach the compiler where to find the header and library files of the dependencies. For\nexample, in MacOS with `brew` you may need to run:\n\n```shell\nexport CFLAGS=\"-I$(brew --prefix lz4)/include\" LDFLAGS=\"-L$(brew --prefix lz4)/lib -Wl,-rpath,$(brew --prefix lz4)/lib\"\n```\n\nbefore installing `memray`. Check the documentation of your package manager to know the location of the header and library\nfiles for more detailed information.\n\nIf you are building on MacOS, you will also need to set the deployment target.\n\n```shell\nexport MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.14\n```\n\nOnce you have the binary dependencies installed, you can clone the repository and follow with the normal building process:\n\n```shell\ngit clone git@github.com:bloomberg/memray.git memray\ncd memray\npython3 -m venv ../memray-env/  # just an example, put this wherever you want\nsource ../memray-env/bin/activate\npython3 -m pip install --upgrade pip\npython3 -m pip install -e . -r requirements-test.txt -r requirements-extra.txt\n```\n\nThis will install Memray in the virtual environment in development mode (the `-e` of the last `pip install` command).\n\nIf you plan to contribute back, you should install the pre-commit hooks:\n\n```shell\npre-commit install\n```\n\nThis will ensure that your contribution passes our linting checks.\n\n# Documentation\n\nYou can find the latest documentation available [here](https://bloomberg.github.io/memray/).\n\n# Usage\n\nThere are many ways to use Memray. The easiest way is to use it as a command line tool to run your script, application, or library.\n\n```\nusage: memray [-h] [-v] {run,flamegraph,table,live,tree,parse,summary,stats} ...\n\nMemory profiler for Python applications\n\nRun `memray run` to generate a memory profile report, then use a reporter command\nsuch as `memray flamegraph` or `memray table` to convert the results into HTML.\n\nExample:\n\n    $ python3 -m memray run -o output.bin my_script.py\n    $ python3 -m memray flamegraph output.bin\n\npositional arguments:\n  {run,flamegraph,table,live,tree,parse,summary,stats}\n                        Mode of operation\n    run                 Run the specified application and track memory usage\n    flamegraph          Generate an HTML flame graph for peak memory usage\n    table               Generate an HTML table with all records in the peak memory usage\n    live                Remotely monitor allocations in a text-based interface\n    tree                Generate a tree view in the terminal for peak memory usage\n    parse               Debug a results file by parsing and printing each record in it\n    summary             Generate a terminal-based summary report of the functions that allocate most memory\n    stats               Generate high level stats of the memory usage in the terminal\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit\n  -v, --verbose         Increase verbosity. Option is additive and can be specified up to 3 times\n  -V, --version         Displays the current version of Memray\n\nPlease submit feedback, ideas, and bug reports by filing a new issue at https://github.com/bloomberg/memray/issues\n```\n\nTo use Memray over a script or a single python file you can use:\n\n```shell\npython3 -m memray run my_script.py\n```\n\nIf you normally run your application with `python3 -m my_module`, you can use the `-m` flag with `memray run`:\n\n```shell\npython3 -m memray run -m my_module\n```\n\nYou can also invoke Memray as a command line tool without having to use `-m` to invoke it as a module:\n\n```shell\nmemray run my_script.py\nmemray run -m my_module\n```\n\nThe output will be a binary file (like `memray-my_script.2369.bin`) that you can analyze in different ways. One way is to use the `memray flamegraph` command to generate a flame graph:\n\n```shell\nmemray flamegraph my_script.2369.bin\n```\n\nThis will produce an HTML file with a flame graph of the memory usage that you can inspect with your favorite browser. There are multiple other reporters that you can use to generate other types of reports, some of them generating terminal-based output and some of them generating HTML files. Here is an example of a Memray flamegraph:\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/bloomberg/memray/blob/main/docs/_static/images/flamegraph_example.png?raw=true\" align=\"center\"/>\n\n## Pytest plugin\n\nIf you want an easy and convenient way to use `memray` in your test suite, you can consider using [pytest-memray](https://github.com/bloomberg/pytest-memray). Once installed, this pytest plugin allows you to simply add `--memray` to the command line invocation:\n\n```shell\npytest --memray tests/\n```\n\nAnd will automatically get a report like this:\n\n```\npython3 -m pytest tests --memray\n=============================================================================================================================== test session starts ================================================================================================================================\nplatform linux -- Python 3.8.10, pytest-6.2.4, py-1.10.0, pluggy-0.13.1\nrootdir: /mypackage, configfile: pytest.ini\nplugins: cov-2.12.0, memray-0.1.0\ncollected 21 items\n\ntests/test_package.py .....................

This can be especially useful when profiling applications that have C extensions (such as `numpy` or `pandas`) as this gives a holistic vision of how much memory is allocated by the extension and how much is allocated by Python itself.\n\nTo activate native tracking, you need to provide the `--native` argument when using the `run` subcommand:\n\n```shell\nmemray run --native my_script.py\n```\n\nThis will automatically add native information to the result file and it will be automatically used by any reporter (such the flamegraph or table reporters). This means that instead of seeing this in the flamegraphs:\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/bloomberg/memray/blob/main/docs/_static/images/mandelbrot_operation_non_native.png?raw=true\" align=\"center\"/>\n\nYou will now be able to see what's happening inside the Python calls:\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/bloomberg/memray/blob/main/docs/_static/images/mandelbrot_operation_native.png?raw=true\" align=\"center\"/>\n\nReporters display native frames in a different color than Python frames. They can also be distinguished by looking at the file location in a frame (Python frames will generally be generated from files with a .py extension while native frames will be generated from files with extensions like .c, .cpp or .h).\n\n# Live mode\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bloomberg/memray/main/docs/_static/images/live_animated.webp\" alt=\"Memray output\"></p>\n\nMemray's live mode runs a script or a module in a terminal-based interface that allows you to interactively inspect its memory usage while it runs. This is useful for debugging scripts or modules that take a long time to run or that exhibit multiple complex memory patterns. You can use the `--live` option to run the script or module in live mode:\n\n```shell\n    memray run --live my_script.py\n```\n\nor if you want to execute a module:\n\n```shell\n    memray run --live -m my_module\n```\n\nThis will show the following TUI interface in your terminal:\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bloomberg/memray/main/docs/_static/images/live_running.png\" align=\"center\"/>\n\n## Sorting results\n\nThe results are displayed in descending order of total memory allocated by a function and the subfunctions called by it. You can change the ordering with the following keyboard shortcuts:\n\n- t (default): Sort by total memory\n\n- o: Sort by own memory\n\n- a: Sort by allocation count\n\nIn most terminals you can also click the \"Sort by Total\", \"Sort by Own\", and \"Sort by Allocations\" buttons on the footer.\n\nThe sorted column's heading is underlined.\n\n## Viewing different threads\n\nBy default, the live command will present the main thread of the program. You can look at different threads of the program by pressing the greater than and less than keys, `<` and `>`. In most terminals you can also click the \"Previous Thread\" and \"Next Thread\" buttons on the footer.\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/bloomberg/memray/blob/main/docs/_static/images/live_different_thread.png?raw=true\" align=\"center\"/>\n\n# API\n\nIn addition to tracking Python processes from a CLI using `memray run`, it is also possible to programmatically enable tracking within a running Python program.\n\n```py\nimport memray\n\nwith memray.Tracker(\"output_file.bin\"):\n    print(\"Allocations will be tracked until the with block ends\")\n```\n\nFor details, see the [API documentation](https://bloomberg.github.io/memray/api.html).\n\n# License\n\nMemray is Apache-2.0 licensed, as found in the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file.\n\n# Code of Conduct\n\n- [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/bloomberg/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n\nThis project has adopted a Code of Conduct.
