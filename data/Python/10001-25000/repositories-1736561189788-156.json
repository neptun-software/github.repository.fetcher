          "size": 7.05859375,
          "content": "# Contributing\n\nWe work hard to provide a high-quality and useful command line interface, and we greatly value feedback and contributions from our community. Whether it's a new feature, correction, or additional documentation, we welcome your pull requests. Please submit any [issues](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/issues) or [pull requests](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/pulls) through GitHub.\n\nThis document contains guidelines for reporting issues or pull requests and contributing code.\n\n## Reporting Issues\n\n- Check to see if there\\'s an existing issue/pull request for the bug/feature. All issues are at <https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/issues> and pull reqs are at <https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/pulls>.\n- If there isn\\'t an existing issue there, please file an issue. If possible, used one of the suggested issue types when creating a new issue (like a bug report of feature request). These issue types have their own template and required information. In general, the ideal report includes:\n  - A description of the problem/suggestion.\n  - The specific AWS CLI commands you are running. Please include debug logs for these commands by appending the `--debug` option to each command. Be sure to remove any sensitive information from the debug logs.\n  - The AWS CLI version you are using `aws --version`.\n\nThe first thing an AWS CLI developer will do is try to reproduce the issue you are seeing, so try to reduce your issue to the smallest possible set of steps that demonstrate the issue. This will lead to quicker resolution of your issue.\n\n## Contributing Code\n\nThe list below are guidelines to use when submitting pull requests. These are the same set of guidelines that the core contributors use when submitting changes, and we ask the same of all community contributions as well:\n\n- The SDK is released under the [Apache license](http://aws.amazon.com/apache2.0/). Any code you submit will be released under that license.\n- We maintain a high percentage of code coverage in our unit tests. As a general rule of thumb, code changes should not lower the overall code coverage percentage for the project. In practice, this means that **every bug fix and feature addition should include tests.**\n- Code should follow [pep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), although if you are modifying an existing module, it is more important for the code to be consistent if there are any discrepancies. Using [`flake8`](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) can assist in identifying `pep8` compliance issues.\n- Code must work on `python3.7` and higher.\n- The AWS CLI is cross platform and code must work on at least Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. Avoid platform specific behavior.\n- If you would like to implement support for a significant feature that is not yet available in the AWS CLI, please talk to us beforehand to avoid any duplication of effort. You can file an [issue](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/issues) to discuss the feature request further.\n\n## Git Commits and Workflow\n\nWhen sending a pull request, please follow these guidelines:\n\n- The PR should target the `develop` branch. If you send a PR to the `master` branch, the travis CI jobs will fail.\n- Your PR branch should be based off a recent commit of the `develop` branch. Preferably the base commit for the PR should use the latest commit of `develop` at the time the PR was created. This helps to ensure there are no merge conflicts or test failures when the PR is merged back to the develop branch.\n- Make separate commits for logically separate changes. Avoid commits such as \\\"update\\\", \\\"fix typo again\\\", \\\"more updates\\\". Rebase your commits before submitting your PR to ensure they represent a logical change.\n- Avoid merge commits in your PRs. If you want to pull in the latest changes from the `develop` branch, rebase on top of the `develop` branch instead of merging the `develop` branch into your feature branch.\n\nAlso, ensure your commit messages match this format:\n\n    Short (50 characters or less) summary\n\n    After the 50 character summary and a blank line, you can include a body if necessary. Note that the 50 character summary does not end with any punctuation. Describe your changes in the imperative mood, e.g., \"Add foo to bar\", \"Update foo component for bar\", \"Fix race condition for foo\".\n\n    The body of the commit message can include:\n\n    * an explanation of the problem and what this change tries to solve.\n\n    * rationale behind the specific implementation\n\n    * alternatives considered and why they were discarded, if appropriate.\n\n    Please limit the line length in the body of a commit message to 80 characters or less.\n\n### Example Git Workflow\n\nBelow is an example of how you can use git to create a feature branch. First, make sure you've created a fork of `aws/aws-cli`. Then you can run these commands:\n\n    # Clone the repo and set up the remotes.\n\n    $ git clone git@github.com:myusername/aws-cli.git\n    $ cd aws-cli\n    $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/aws/aws-cli.git\n    $ git fetch upstream\n    $ git merge upstream/develop\n\n    # Now to create a feature branch:\n    $ git checkout -b my-branch-name\n\n    # Now add your commits for your features.\n    $ git add path/to/my/files\n\n    # Make sure our commit message matches format described in the\n    # previous section.\n    $ git commit -m \"Add support for foo\"\n\n    # If we want to sync with the latest upstream changes before\n    # sending our pull request we can run:\n    $ git fetch upstream\n    $ git rebase upstream/develop\n\n    # When you're ready to send a PR, make sure you push your commits\n    # to your fork:\n    $ git push origin my-branch-name\n\nWhen you push to your remote, the output will contain a URL you can use to open a pull request.\n\n## CLI Development Version\n\nIf you are interested in using the latest released version of the AWS CLI, please see the [Installation](README.rst#Installation) section in the README. This section is for anyone who wants to install the development version of the CLI. You might need to do this if:\n\n- You are developing a feature for the CLI and plan on submitting a Pull Request.\n- You want to test the latest changes of the CLI before they make it into an official release.\n\nThe latest changes to the CLI are in the `develop` branch on github. This is the default branch when you clone the git repository.\n\nAdditionally, the [`botocore`](https://github.com/boto/botocore) package is developed in lockstep with the CLI.\n\nIf you just want to install a snapshot of the latest development version of the CLI, you can use the `requirements.txt` file included in this repo. This file points to the development version of the above packages:\n\n    $ cd <path_to_awscli>\n    $ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt\n    $ python -m pip install -e .\n\nHowever, to keep up to date, you will continually have to run the `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` file to pull in the latest changes from the develop branch of botocore.\n\nYou can optionally clone each of those repositories and run \\\"python -m pip install -e .\\\":\n\n    $ git clone <botocore> && cd botocore/\n    $ python -m pip install -e . && cd ..\n    $ git clone <awscli> && cd aws-cli/\n    $ python -m pip install -e .\n"

To ensure smooth installation,\nit's recommended to use:\n\n- ``pip``: 9.0.2 or greater\n- ``setuptools``: 36.2.0 or greater\n\nThe safest way to install the AWS CLI is to use\n`pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`__ in a ``virtualenv``:\n\n::\n\n   $ python -m pip install awscli\n\nor, if you are not installing in a ``virtualenv``, to install globally:\n\n::\n\n   $ sudo python -m pip install awscli\n\nor for your user:\n\n::\n\n   $ python -m pip install --user awscli\n\nIf you have the aws-cli package installed and want to upgrade to the\nlatest version, you can run:\n\n::\n\n   $ python -m pip install --upgrade awscli\n\nThis will install the aws-cli package as well as all dependencies.\n\n.. note::\n   On macOS, if you see an error regarding the version of ``six`` that\n   came with ``distutils`` in El Capitan, use the ``--ignore-installed``\n   option:\n\n::\n\n   $ sudo python -m pip install awscli --ignore-installed six\n\nOn Linux and Mac OS, the AWS CLI can be installed using a `bundled\ninstaller <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-linux.html#install-linux-bundled>`__.\nThe AWS CLI can also be installed on Windows via an `MSI\nInstaller <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-windows.html#msi-on-windows>`__.\n\nIf you want to run the ``develop`` branch of the AWS CLI, see the\n`Development Version <CONTRIBUTING.md#cli-development-version>`__ section of\nthe contributing guide.\n\nSee the\n`installation <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv1.html>`__\nsection of the AWS CLI User Guide for more information.\n\nConfiguration\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nBefore using the AWS CLI, you need to configure your AWS credentials.\nYou can do this in several ways:\n\n-  Configuration command\n-  Environment variables\n-  Shared credentials file\n-  Config file\n-  IAM Role\n\nThe quickest way to get started is to run the ``aws configure`` command:\n\n::\n\n   $ aws configure\n   AWS Access Key ID: MYACCESSKEY\n   AWS Secret Access Key: MYSECRETKEY\n   Default region name [us-west-2]: us-west-2\n   Default output format [None]: json\n\nTo use environment variables, do the following:\n\n::\n\n   $ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<access_key>\n   $ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<secret_key>\n\nTo use the shared credentials file, create an INI formatted file like\nthis:\n\n::\n\n   [default]\n   aws_access_key_id=MYACCESSKEY\n   aws_secret_access_key=MYSECRETKEY\n\n   [testing]\n   aws_access_key_id=MYACCESSKEY\n   aws_secret_access_key=MYSECRETKEY\n\nand place it in ``~/.aws/credentials`` (or in\n``%UserProfile%\\.aws/credentials`` on Windows). If you wish to place the\nshared credentials file in a different location than the one specified\nabove, you need to tell aws-cli where to find it. Do this by setting the\nappropriate environment variable:\n\n::\n\n   $ export AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE=/path/to/shared_credentials_file\n\nTo use a config file, create an INI formatted file like this:\n\n::\n\n   [default]\n   aws_access_key_id=<default access key>\n   aws_secret_access_key=<default secret key>\n   # Optional, to define default region for this profile.\n   region=us-west-1\n\n   [profile testing]\n   aws_access_key_id=<testing access key>\n   aws_secret_access_key=<testing secret key>\n   region=us-west-2\n\nand place it in ``~/.aws/config`` (or in ``%UserProfile%\\.aws\\config``\non Windows). If you wish to place the config file in a different\nlocation than the one specified above, you need to tell the AWS CLI\nwhere to find it. Do this by setting the appropriate environment\nvariable:\n\n::\n\n   $ export AWS_CONFIG_FILE=/path/to/config_file\n\nAs you can see, you can have multiple ``profiles`` defined in both the\nshared credentials file and the configuration file. You can then specify\nwhich profile to use by using the ``--profile`` option. If no profile is\nspecified the ``default`` profile is used.\n\nIn the config file, except for the default profile, you **must** prefix\neach config section of a profile group with ``profile``. For example, if\nyou have a profile named \"testing\" the section header would be\n``[profile testing]``.\n\nThe final option for credentials is highly recommended if you are using\nthe AWS CLI on an EC2 instance. `IAM\nRoles <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html>`__\nare a great way to have credentials installed automatically on your\ninstance. If you are using IAM Roles, the AWS CLI will find and use them\nautomatically.\n\nIn addition to credentials, a number of other variables can be\nconfigured either with environment variables, configuration file\nentries, or both. See the `AWS Tools and SDKs Shared Configuration and\nCredentials Reference\nGuide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/overview.html>`__\nfor more information.\n\nFor more information about configuration options, please refer to the\n`AWS CLI Configuration Variables\ntopic <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/topic/config-vars.html#cli-aws-help-config-vars>`__.\nYou can access this topic from the AWS CLI as well by running\n``aws help config-vars``.\n\nBasic Commands\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAn AWS CLI command has the following structure:\n\n::\n\n   $ aws <command> <subcommand> [options and parameters]\n\nFor example, to list S3 buckets, the command would be:\n\n::\n\n   $ aws s3 ls\n\nTo view help documentation, use one of the following:\n\n::\n\n   $ aws help\n   $ aws <command> help\n   $ aws <command> <subcommand> help\n\nTo get the version of the AWS CLI:\n\n::\n\n   $ aws --version\n\nTo turn on debugging output:\n\n::\n\n   $ aws --debug <command> <subcommand>\n\nYou can read more information on the `Using the AWS\nCLI <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-using.html>`__\nchapter of the AWS CLI User Guide.\n\nCommand Completion\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe aws-cli package includes a command completion feature for Unix-like\nsystems. This feature is not automatically installed so you need to\nconfigure it manually. To learn more, read the `AWS CLI Command\ncompletion\ntopic <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-completion.html>`__.\n\nGetting Help\n------------\n\nThe best way to interact with our team is through GitHub. You can `open\nan issue <https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/issues/new/choose>`__ and\nchoose from one of our templates for guidance, bug reports, or feature\nrequests.\n\nYou may find help from the community on `Stack\nOverflow <https://stackoverflow.com/>`__ with the tag\n`aws-cli <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/aws-cli>`__ or on\nthe `AWS Discussion Forum for\nCLI <https://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=150>`__.

          "content": "# CLI Python 3 Migration Guide\n\nPython 2.7 was deprecated by the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf-landing/)\nback on January 1, 2020 following a multi-year process of phasing it out. Because of this, AWS has\ndeprecated support for Python 2.7, meaning versions the AWS CLI v1 released after the deprecation\ndate no longer work with Python 2.7.\n\n-----\n\n**Note**\n\nSince the AWS CLI v2 bundles its own copy of Python, this transition only impacts users of the CLI \nv1. You can upgrade to the AWS CLI v2 to avoid these deprecations in the future.\n\n----\n## Timeline\n\nGoing forward, customers using the CLI v1 should transition to using Python 3, with Python 3.8 becoming\nthe minimum by the end of the transition. The deprecation dates for the affected versions of Python are:\n\n|Python version|Deprecation date|\n|--------------|----------------|\n| Python 2.7|          7/15/2021|\n| Python 3.4 and 3.5|   2/1/2021|\n| Python 3.6|          5/30/2022|\n| Python 3.7|         12/13/2023|\n\n## Impact on the AWS CLI\n\nThe AWS Command Line Interface is built using the Python SDK, so it's affected by this transition. \nAWS CLI v2 isn't affected by this transition, since it bundles its own copy of Python 3. However, \nif you still use the AWS CLI v1, you need to decide whether to \n[upgrade to Python 3](#upgrading-to-python-3) or transition to the \n[AWS CLI v2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html).\n\n## Upgrading to Python 3\n\nBefore starting this process, we highly recommend \n[upgrading to AWS CLI v2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html). \nThis will avoid the requirement for future upgrades and isolate your CLI usage from conflicts \nwith other packages like boto3 and botocore.\n\n### Do I need to upgrade?\n\nFirst, let’s check if you need to upgrade to Python 3. If you have the AWS CLI installed, \nyou can quickly check which version of Python it’s using with this command.\n```bash\n$ aws --version\naws-cli/1.18.191 Python/2.7.18 Darwin/19.6.0 botocore/1.19.31\n```\n\nIf the second portion of the version string, starting with **Python/** isn’t Python/3.8.x\nor higher, you should review the options below.\n\n### Installing CLI with Python 3\n\nIf you’re using the **MSI installer**, you can simply start using these Python 3 based installers\n[[32 bit](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/AWSCLI32PY3.msi)] \n[[64 bit](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/AWSCLI64PY3.msi)].\n\nOtherwise, upgrading Python versions isn’t difficult.\n\n1. To begin, uninstall your existing copy of the AWS CLI. You can find instructions in the \n[CLI v1 installation guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-linux.html).\n2. Now we’ll install Python 3.8 or later. You can get Python from\n[Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads) or using your local package manager. \nIn this example, we’ll use a recent version, Python 3.8.7, to ensure the longest support window. \n3. Next, depending on your installation method, the new Python installation should be available at \none of these locations. Use these commands to verify:\n```bash\n    $ python --version\n    Python 3.8.7\n    \n    $ python3 --version\n    Python 3.8.7\n    \n    $ python3.8 --version\n    Python 3.8.7\n```\n5.  Here, we're using the **python** command from above to make sure we're installing with the right \nversion. Use whichever alias provided the desired Python version.\n```bash\n$ python -m pip install awscli\n```\nAlternatively, if you're using the bundled installer you can use:\n```bash\n$ python awscli-bundle/install -i /usr/local/aws -b /usr/local/bin/aws\n```\n7. If you wish, you may verify that the newly installed copy of the AWS CLI tool, **aws**, is \nusing the correct version of Python. The **aws --version** command reports the **aws** tool's \nversion number, followed by the version of Python it's running under, then the operating system \nversion and the version of botocore. As long as the Python version is at least 3.8,\nyou're ready to go:\n```bash\n    $ aws --version\n    aws-cli/1.18.191 Python/3.8.7 Darwin/19.6.0 botocore/1.19.31\n```\n\n## If you're unable to upgrade to Python 3\n\nIt may be possible that you're unable to upgrade to Python 3. Under these circumstances, you \nshould be prepared for the deprecation date, in order to not be inconvenienced when the time \narrives. If you're using a version of the AWS CLI v1 released prior to the deprecation date, \nit will continue to function after end of support. These versions however will no longer be \nreceiving security or feature updates. If those are required, you will need to migrate to \nPython 3 to start receiving updates again.\n\n### Upgrade a pip-based install\n\nIf you install the AWS CLI using pip, as long as you use pip 10.0 and later, you will \nautomatically install the last available version compatible with Python 2.7.\n\n### Windows MSI Installer\n\nIf you installed the AWS CLI v1 using the Windows MSI Installer for Python 3 \n[[32 bit](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/AWSCLI32PY3.msi)] \n[[64 bit](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/AWSCLI64PY3.msi)], \nyou're not impacted by this transition. These installers stay up-to-date with each release.\n\nIf you're still using the AWS CLI v1 as installed using the Windows MSI Installer for Python 2, \nbe aware that after the deprecation date, the download links for the latest version of the CLI v1 \nWindows MSI Installer will point to the Python 3 MSIs. Previous releases, including those for \nPython 2, will remain available at their version-specific URLs: \n* `https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/AWSCLI32-{VERSION}.msi`\n* `https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/AWSCLI64-{VERSION}.msi`\n\n### Upgrade with the AWS CLI bundled installer\n\nIf you use the AWS CLI bundled installer to install the AWS CLI v1 and cannot upgrade, \nyou will need to ensure you’re downloading a Python 2 compatible version. \nAll versions released prior to the deprecation date should be compatible. \nYou can download a specific installer using the URL \n`https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/awscli-bundle-{VERSION}.zip`, \nwhere \"`{VERSION}`\" is the AWS CLI version you wish to install.\n\nFor example, you could choose version 1.18.200 using the following command:\n\n```bash\ncurl https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/awscli-bundle-1.18.200.zip -o awscli-bundle.zip\n```\n\nOnce you've downloaded the bundle, proceed with step 2 of the bundle-based installation \ninstructions for your platform:\n\n* [Linux](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-linux.html#install-linux-bundled)\n* [macOS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-macos.html#install-macosos-bundled-sudo)\n"
