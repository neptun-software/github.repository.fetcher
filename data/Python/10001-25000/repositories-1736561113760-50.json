You can be as specific as you need, use XPath exported from various XPath element query creation tools. \n(We support LXML `re:test`, `re:match` and `re:replace`.)\n\n## Notifications\n\nChangeDetection.io supports a massive amount of notifications (including email, office365, custom APIs, etc) when a web-page has a change detected thanks to the <a href=\"https://github.com/caronc/apprise\">apprise</a> library.\nSimply set one or more notification URL's in the _[edit]_ tab of that watch.\n\nJust some examples\n\n    discord://webhook_id/webhook_token\n    flock://app_token/g:channel_id\n    gitter://token/room\n    gchat://workspace/key/token\n    msteams://TokenA/TokenB/TokenC/\n    o365://TenantID:AccountEmail/ClientID/ClientSecret/TargetEmail\n    rocket://user:password@hostname/#Channel\n    mailto://user:pass@example.com?to=receivingAddress@example.com\n    json://someserver.com/custom-api\n    syslog://\n \n<a href=\"https://github.com/caronc/apprise#popular-notification-services\">And everything else in this list!</a>\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/master/docs/screenshot-notifications.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\" alt=\"Self-hosted web page change monitoring notifications\"  title=\"Self-hosted web page change monitoring notifications\"  />\n\nNow you can also customise your notification content and use <a target=\"_new\" href=\"https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/templates/\">Jinja2 templating</a> for their title and body!\n\n## JSON API Monitoring\n\nDetect changes and monitor data in JSON API's by using either JSONPath or jq to filter, parse, and restructure JSON as needed.\n\n![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/master/docs/json-filter-field-example.png)\n\nThis will re-parse the JSON and apply formatting to the text, making it super easy to monitor and detect changes in JSON API results\n\n![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/master/docs/json-diff-example.png)\n\n### JSONPath or jq?\n\nFor more complex parsing, filtering, and modifying of JSON data, jq is recommended due to the built-in operators and functions. Refer to the [documentation](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/) for more specific information on jq.\n\nOne big advantage of `jq` is that you can use logic in your JSON filter, such as filters to only show items that have a value greater than/less than etc.\n\nSee the wiki https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/wiki/JSON-Selector-Filter-help for more information and examples\n\n### Parse JSON embedded in HTML!\n\nWhen you enable a `json:` or `jq:` filter, you can even automatically extract and parse embedded JSON inside a HTML page! Amazingly handy for sites that build content based on JSON, such as many e-commerce websites. \n\n```\n<html>\n...\n<script type=\"application/ld+json\">\n\n{\n   \"@context\":\"http://schema.org/\",\n   \"@type\":\"Product\",\n   \"offers\":{\n      \"@type\":\"Offer\",\n      \"availability\":\"http://schema.org/InStock\",\n      \"price\":\"3949.99\",\n      \"priceCurrency\":\"USD\",\n      \"url\":\"https://www.newegg.com/p/3D5-000D-001T1\"\n   },\n   \"description\":\"Cobratype King Cobra Hero Desktop Gaming PC\",\n   \"name\":\"Cobratype King Cobra Hero Desktop Gaming PC\",\n   \"sku\":\"3D5-000D-001T1\",\n   \"itemCondition\":\"NewCondition\"\n}\n</script>\n```  \n\n`json:$..price` or `jq:..price` would give `3949.99`, or you can extract the whole structure (use a JSONpath test website to validate with)\n\nThe application also supports notifying you that it can follow this information automatically\n\n\n## Proxy Configuration\n\nSee the wiki https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/wiki/Proxy-configuration , we also support using [Bright Data proxy services where possible](https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/wiki/Proxy-configuration#brightdata-proxy-support) and [Oxylabs](https://oxylabs.go2cloud.org/SH2d) proxy services.\n\n## Raspberry Pi support?\n\nRaspberry Pi and linux/arm/v6 linux/arm/v7 arm64 devices are supported! See the wiki for [details](https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io/wiki/Fetching-pages-with-WebDriver)\n\n## Import support\n\nEasily [import your list of websites to watch for changes in Excel .xslx file format](https://changedetection.io/tutorial/how-import-your-website-change-detection-lists-excel), or paste in lists of website URLs as plaintext. \n\nExcel import is recommended - that way you can better organise tags/groups of websites and other features.\n\n\n## API Support\n\nSupports managing the website watch list [via our API](https://changedetection.io/docs/api_v1/index.html)\n\n## Support us\n\nDo you use changedetection.io to make money? does it save you time or money?
