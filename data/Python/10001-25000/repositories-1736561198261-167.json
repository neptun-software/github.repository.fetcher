The garbage collection risk has been fixed by holding a strong reference to the task. Additionally, the task is now scheduled eagerly with Python 3.12+ to increase the chance it can be completed immediately and avoid having to hold any references to the task.\n\n\n  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*\n  :issue:`8641`.\n\n\n\n- Fixed incorrectly following symlinks for compressed file variants -- by :user:`steverep`.\n\n\n  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*\n  :issue:`8652`.\n\n\n\n\nRemovals and backward incompatible breaking changes\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n- Removed ``Request.wait_for_disconnection()``, which was mistakenly added briefly in 3.10.0 -- by :user:`Dreamsorcerer`.\n\n\n  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*\n  :issue:`8636`.\n\n\n\n\nContributor-facing changes\n--------------------------\n\n- Fixed monkey patches for ``Path.stat()`` and ``Path.is_dir()`` for Python 3.13 compatibility -- by :user:`steverep`.\n\n\n  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*\n  :issue:`8551`.\n\n\n\n\nMiscellaneous internal changes\n------------------------------\n\n- Improved WebSocket performance when messages are sent or received frequently -- by :user:`bdraco`.\n\n  The WebSocket heartbeat scheduling algorithm was improved to reduce the ``asyncio`` scheduling overhead by decreasing the number of ``asyncio.TimerHandle`` creations and cancellations.\n\n\n  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*\n  :issue:`8608`.\n\n\n\n- Minor improvements to various type annotations -- by :user:`Dreamsorcerer`.\n\n\n  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*\n  :issue:`8634`.\n\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n3.10.1 (2024-08-03)\n========================\n\nBug fixes\n---------\n\n- Fixed WebSocket server heartbeat timeout logic to terminate :py:meth:`~aiohttp.ClientWebSocketResponse.receive` and return :py:class:`~aiohttp.ServerTimeoutError` -- by :user:`arcivanov`.\n\n  When a WebSocket pong message was not received, the :py:meth:`~aiohttp.ClientWebSocketResponse.receive` operation did not terminate. This change causes ``_pong_not_received`` to feed the ``reader`` an error message, causing pending :py:meth:`~aiohttp.ClientWebSocketResponse.receive` to terminate and return the error message. The error message contains the exception :py:class:`~aiohttp.ServerTimeoutError`.\n\n\n  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*\n  :issue:`8540`.\n\n\n\n- Fixed url dispatcher index not matching when a variable is preceded by a fixed string after a slash -- by :user:`bdraco`.\n\n\n  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*\n  :issue:`8566`.\n\n\n\n\nRemovals and backward incompatible breaking changes\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n- Creating :py:class:`aiohttp.TCPConnector`, :py:class:`aiohttp.ClientSession`, :py:class:`~aiohttp.resolver.ThreadedResolver` :py:class:`aiohttp.web.Server`, or :py:class:`aiohttp.CookieJar` instances without a running event loop now raises a :exc:`RuntimeError` -- by :user:`asvetlov`.\n\n  Creating these objects without a running event loop was deprecated in :issue:`3372` which was released in version 3.5.0.\n\n  This change first appeared in version 3.10.0 as :issue:`6378`.\n\n\n  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*\n  :issue:`8555`, :issue:`8583`.\n\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n3.10.0 (2024-07-30)\n========================\n\nBug fixes\n---------\n\n- Fixed server response headers for ``Content-Type`` and ``Content-Encoding`` for\n  static compressed files -- by :user:`steverep`.\n\n  Server will now respond with a ``Content-Type`` appropriate for the compressed\n  file (e.g. ``\"application/gzip\"``), and omit the ``Content-Encoding`` header.\n  Users should expect that most clients will no longer decompress such responses\n  by default.\n\n\n  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*\n  :issue:`4462`.\n\n\n\n- Fixed duplicate cookie expiration calls in the CookieJar implementation\n\n\n  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*\n  :issue:`7784`.\n\n\n\n- Adjusted ``FileResponse`` to check file existence and access when preparing the response -- by :user:`steverep`.\n\n  The :py:class:`~aiohttp.web.FileResponse` class was modified to respond with\n   403 Forbidden or 404 Not Found as appropriate.  Previously, it would cause a\n   server error if the path did not exist or could not be accessed.  Checks for\n   existence, non-regular files, and permissions were expected to be done in the\n   route handler.  For static routes, this now permits a compressed file to exist\n   without its uncompressed variant and still be served.  In addition, this\n   changes the response status for files without read permission to 403, and for\n   non-regular files from 404 to 403 for consistency.\n\n\n  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*\n  :issue:`8182`.\n\n\n\n- Fixed ``AsyncResolver`` to match ``ThreadedResolver`` behavior\n  -- by :user:`bdraco`.\n\n  On system with IPv6 support, the :py:class:`~aiohttp.resolver.AsyncResolver` would not fallback\n  to providing A records when AAAA records were not available.\n  Additionally, unlike the :py:class:`~aiohttp.resolver.ThreadedResolver`, the :py:class:`~aiohttp.resolver.AsyncResolver`\n  did not handle link-local addresses correctly.\n\n  This change makes the behavior consistent with the :py:class:`~aiohttp.resolver.ThreadedResolver`.\n\n\n  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*\n  :issue:`8270`.\n\n\n\n- Fixed ``ws_connect`` not respecting `receive_timeout`` on WS(S) connection.\n  -- by :user:`arcivanov`.\n\n\n  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*\n  :issue:`8444`.\n\n\n\n- Removed blocking I/O in the event loop for static resources and refactored\n  exception handling -- by :user:`steverep`.\n\n  File system calls when handling requests for static routes were moved to a\n  separate thread to potentially improve performance. Exception handling\n  was tightened in order to only return 403 Forbidden or 404 Not Found responses\n  for expected scenarios; 500 Internal Server Error would be returned for any\n  unknown errors.\n\n\n  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*\n  :issue:`8507`.\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- Added a Request.wait_for_disconnection() method, as means of allowing request handlers to be notified of premature client disconnections.\n\n\n  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*\n  :issue:`2492`.\n\n\n\n- Added 5 new exceptions: :py:exc:`~aiohttp.InvalidUrlClientError`, :py:exc:`~aiohttp.RedirectClientError`,\n  :py:exc:`~aiohttp.NonHttpUrlClientError`, :py:exc:`~aiohttp.InvalidUrlRedirectClientError`,\n  :py:exc:`~aiohttp.NonHttpUrlRedirectClientError`\n\n  :py:exc:`~aiohttp.InvalidUrlRedirectClientError`, :py:exc:`~aiohttp.NonHttpUrlRedirectClientError`\n  are raised instead of :py:exc:`ValueError` or :py:exc:`~aiohttp.InvalidURL` when the redirect URL is invalid. Classes\n  :py:exc:`~aiohttp.InvalidUrlClientError`, :py:exc:`~aiohttp.RedirectClientError`,\n  :py:exc:`~aiohttp.NonHttpUrlClientError` are base for them.\n\n  The :py:exc:`~aiohttp.InvalidURL` now exposes a ``description`` property with the text explanation of the error details.\n\n  -- by :user:`setla`, :user:`AraHaan`, and :user:`bdraco`\n\n\n  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*\n  :issue:`2507`, :issue:`3315`, :issue:`6722`, :issue:`8481`, :issue:`8482`.\n\n\n\n- Added a feature to retry closed connections automatically for idempotent methods. -- by :user:`Dreamsorcerer`\n\n\n  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*\n  :issue:`7297`.\n\n\n\n- Implemented filter_cookies() with domain-matching and path-matching on the keys, instead of testing every single cookie.\n  This may break existing cookies that have been saved with `CookieJar.save()`. Cookies can be migrated with this script::\n\n      import pickle\n      with file_path.open(\"rb\") as f:\n          cookies = pickle.load(f)\n\n      morsels = [(name, m) for c in cookies.values() for name, m in c.items()]\n      cookies.clear()\n      for name, m in morsels:\n          cookies[(m[\"domain\"], m[\"path\"].rstrip(\"/\"))][name] = m\n\n      with file_path.open(\"wb\") as f:\n          pickle.dump(cookies, f, pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)\n\n\n  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*\n  :issue:`7583`, :issue:`8535`.\n\n\n\n- Separated connection and socket timeout errors, from ServerTimeoutError.\n\n\n  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*\n  :issue:`7801`.\n\n\n\n- Implemented happy eyeballs\n\n\n  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*\n  :issue:`7954`.\n\n\n\n- Added server capability to check for static files with Brotli compression via a ``.br`` extension -- by :user:`steverep`.\n\n\n  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*\n  :issue:`8062`.\n\n\n\n\nRemovals and backward incompatible breaking changes\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n- The shutdown logic in 3.9 waited on all tasks, which caused issues with some libraries.\n  In 3.10 we've changed this logic to only wait on request handlers. This means that it's\n  important for developers to correctly handle the lifecycle of background tasks using a\n  library such as ``aiojobs``. If an application is using ``handler_cancellation=True`` then\n  it is also a good idea to ensure that any :func:`asyncio.shield` calls are replaced with\n  :func:`aiojobs.aiohttp.shield`.\n\n  Please read the updated documentation on these points: \\\n  https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/web_advanced.html#graceful-shutdown \\\n  https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/web_advanced.html#web-handler-cancellation\n\n  -- by :user:`Dreamsorcerer`\n\n\n  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*\n  :issue:`8495`.\n\n\n\n\nImproved documentation\n----------------------\n\n- Added documentation for ``aiohttp.web.FileResponse``.\n\n\n  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*\n  :issue:`3958`.\n\n\n\n- Improved the docs for the `ssl` params.\n\n\n  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*\n  :issue:`8403`.\n\n\n\n\nContributor-facing changes\n--------------------------\n\n- Enabled HTTP parser tests originally intended for 3.9.2 release -- by :user:`pajod`.\n\n\n  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*\n  :issue:`8088`.\n\n\n\n\nMiscellaneous internal changes\n------------------------------\n\n- Improved URL handler resolution time by indexing resources in the UrlDispatcher.\n  For applications with a large number of handlers, this should increase performance significantly.\n  -- by :user:`bdraco`\n\n\n  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*\n  :issue:`7829`.\n\n\n\n- Added `nacl_middleware <https://github.com/CosmicDNA/nacl_middleware>`_ to the list of middlewares in the third party section of the documentation.\n\n\n  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*\n  :issue:`8346`.\n\n\n\n- Minor improvements to static typing -- by :user:`Dreamsorcerer`.\n\n\n  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*\n  :issue:`8364`.\n\n\n\n- Added a 3.11-specific overloads to ``ClientSession``  -- by :user:`max-muoto`.\n\n\n  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*\n  :issue:`8463`.\n\n\n\n- Simplified path checks for ``UrlDispatcher.add_static()`` method -- by :user:`steverep`.\n\n\n  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*\n  :issue:`8491`.\n\n\n\n- Avoided creating a future on every websocket receive -- by :user:`bdraco`.\n\n\n  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*\n  :issue:`8498`.\n\n\n\n- Updated identity checks for all ``WSMsgType`` type compares -- by :user:`bdraco`.\n\n\n  *Related issues and pull requests on GitHub:*\n  :issue:`8501`.\n\n\n\n- When using Python 3.12 or later, the writer is no longer scheduled on the event loop if it can finish synchronously.

The addition is very important because\nall *aiohttp* docs now uses ``app.add_routes()`` call in code\nsnippets. All your existing code still do register routes / resource\nwithout any warning but you've got the idea for a favorite way: noisy\n``app.router.add_get()`` is replaced by ``app.add_routes()``.\n\nThe library does not make a preference between decorators::\n\n   routes = web.RouteTableDef()\n\n   @routes.get('/')\n   async def hello(request):\n       return web.Response(text=\"Hello, world\")\n\n   app.add_routes(routes)\n\nand route tables as a list::\n\n   async def hello(request):\n       return web.Response(text=\"Hello, world\")\n\n   app.add_routes([web.get('/', hello)])\n\nBoth ways are equal, user may decide basing on own code taste.\n\nAlso we have a lot of minor features, bug fixes and documentation\nupdates, see below.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- Relax JSON content-type checking in the ``ClientResponse.json()`` to allow\n  \"application/xxx+json\" instead of strict \"application/json\".
