[#3256](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/3256)\n- New functions in `plotly.colors`: `get_colorscale()` and `sample_colorscale()` [#3136](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/3136) and [#3186](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/3186) with thanks to [@CarlAndersson](https://github.com/CarlAndersson) for the contributions\n- Faster JSON encoding when `orjson` is present [#2955](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2955)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Pandas and Numpy datetime serialization fixes [#3022](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/3022)\n- Fixed selected points of histograms in FigureWidget [#2771](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2771) with thanks to [@meffmadd](https://github.com/meffmadd) for the contribution\n- Static image export now honors `layout.(width|height)`[#3240](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/3240)\n- Improvements to \"matplotlylib\" conversion utility in `plotly.tools.mpl_to_plotly()` with thanks to [@fdion](https://github.com/fdion) [#3143](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/3143)\n\n\n## [4.14.3] - 2021-01-12\n\n- `px.timeline()` now allows `hover_data` formatting of start and end times [3018](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/3018)\n- Small change to packaging of `plotlywidget` extension for JupyterLab 3 [3021](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/3021)\n\n## [4.14.2] - 2021-01-11\n\n### Updated\n\n- JupyterLab extensions now compatible with JupyterLab 3.x [3016](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/3016)\n- Updated Plotly.js to version 1.58.4. See the [plotly.js CHANGELOG](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/v1.58.4/CHANGELOG.md) for more information. These changes are reflected in the auto-generated `plotly.graph_objects` module. Notable changes include:\n  - fixes for rendering 3d plots on recent Safari versions\n  - fixes to inside ticklabels\n  - regression fixes\n\n### Fixed\n\n- `px.histogram()` Y-axis labels now take into account `histnorm` and `barnorm` [2989](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2989)\n- `px.histogram()` `marginal` and `facet_*` now work correctly together [3014](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/3014)\n\n\n## [4.14.1] - 2020-12-09\n\n### Updated\n\n- Updated Plotly.js to version 1.58.2. See the [plotly.js CHANGELOG](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/v1.58.0/CHANGELOG.md) for more information. These changes are reflected in the auto-generated `plotly.graph_objects` module. Notable changes include:\n  - fixes for new `ticklabelposition` attribute\n  - fixes for a regression related to treemaps in the previous version\n\n\n## [4.14.0] - 2020-12-07\n\n### Added\n\n- `px.imshow` now supports `facet_col` and `animation_frame` arguments for visualizing 3-d and 4-d images [2746](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2746)\n- `px.defaults` now supports `color_discrete_map`, `symbol_map`, `line_dash_map`, `labels` and `category_orders` as well as a `.reset()` method [2957](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2957)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- axes will now auto-type numeric strings as categorical data rather than linear in the default templates [2951](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2951)\n\n### Updated\n\n- Updated Plotly.js to version 1.58.1. See the [plotly.js CHANGELOG](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/v1.58.0/CHANGELOG.md) for more information. These changes are reflected in the auto-generated `plotly.graph_objects` module. Notable changes include:\n  - a new `ticklabelposition` attribute to enable positioning tick labels inside the plotting area\n  - better support for `scaleanchor` and `matches` on cartesian axes for matched square subplots\n  - a new `autotypenumbers` attribute which is now set to `strict` in the default templates\n  - various fixes relating to `automargins` for small figures\n\n\n## [4.13.0] - 2020-11-23\n\n### Added\n- `px.choropleth`, `px.scatter_geo` and `px.line_geo` now support faceting as well as `fitbounds` and `basemap_visible` [2923](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2923)\n- `px.scatter_geo` and `px.line_geo` now support `geojson`/`featureidkey` input [2923](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2923)\n- `px.scatter_geo` now supports `symbol` [2923](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2923)\n- `go.Figure` now has a `set_subplots` method to set subplots on an already\n  existing figure. [2866](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2866)\n- Added `Turbo` colorscale and fancier swatch display functions\n  [2882](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2882)\n- A utility function `image_array_to_data_uri` has been added in\n  `plotly.utils`, in order to transform NumPy arrays to data b64 URIs (which\n  can be passed to the source parameter of `go.Image`, or to layout images).\n  [2879](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2879)\n- the `selector` argument to updater/selector functions now accepts `int`s and `str`s\n  [2894](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2894)\n\n\n### Updated\n\n- the JSON serialization of plotly figures has been accelerated thanks to a\n  different handling of Infinity and NaN values. For example, a figure with a\n  1000x1000 Heatmap should now serialize 2x faster. [2880](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2880)\n- Coding mistakes with \"magic underscores\" now return significantly more ergonomic error\n  messages [2843](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2843)\n- Error messages related to impossible subplot geometries are now much more helpful\n  [2897](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2897)\n\n\n### Fixed\n\n- `px.scatter_geo` support for `text` is fixed [2923](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2923)\n- the `x` and `y` parameters of `px.imshow` are now used also in the case where\n  an Image trace is used (for RGB data or with `binary_string=True`). However,\n  only numerical values are accepted (while the Heatmap trace allows date or\n  string values for `x` and `y`). [2761](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2761)\n\n\n## [4.12.0] - 2020-10-23\n\n### Added\n\n- For `add_trace`, `add_shape`, `add_annotation` and `add_layout_image`, the `row` and/or `col` argument now also accept the string `\"all\"`. `row=\"all\"` adds the object to all the subplot rows and `col=\"all\"` adds the object to all the subplot columns. ([#2840](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2840))\n- Shapes that reference the plot axes in one dimension and the data in another dimension can be added with the new `add_hline`, `add_vline`, `add_hrect`, `add_vrect` functions, which also support the `row=\"all\"` and `col=\"all\"` arguments. ([#2840](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2840))\n- The `add_trace`, `add_shape`, `add_annotation`, `add_layout_image`, `add_hline`, `add_vline`, `add_hrect`, `add_vrect` functions accept an argument `exclude_empty_subplots` which if `True`, only adds the object to subplots already containing traces or layout objects. This is useful in conjunction with the `row=\"all\"` and `col=\"all\"` arguments. ([#2840](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2840))\n- For all `go.Figure` functions accepting a selector argument (e.g., `select_traces`), this argument can now also be a function which is passed each relevant graph object (in the case of `select_traces`, it is passed every trace in the figure). For graph objects where this function returns true, the graph object is included in the selection. ([#2844](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2844))\n\n### Added\n\n- Better magic underscore error messages. For example, `some_fig.update_layout(geo_ltaxis_showgrid=True)` shows `Bad property path:\\ngeo_ltaxis_showgrid\\n   ^` and lists the valid properties for `geo`.\n\n### Updated\n\n- Updated Plotly.js to version 1.57.1. See the [plotly.js CHANGELOG](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/v1.57.1/CHANGELOG.md) for more information. These changes are reflected in the auto-generated `plotly.graph_objects` module.\n\n## [4.11.0] - 2020-10-01\n\n### Updated\n\n- Updated Plotly.js to version 1.56.0. See the [plotly.js CHANGELOG](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/v1.56.0/CHANGELOG.md) for more information. These changes are reflected in the auto-generated `plotly.graph_objects` module.\n\n## [4.10.0] - 2020-09-10\n\n### Added\n\n- Added `plotly.io.full_figure_for_development()` and `plotly.graph_objects.Figure.full_figure_for_development()` ([#2737](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2737))\n\n### Updated\n\n- The JSON serialization of plotly figures had been accelerated by handling\n  differently figures with and without NaN and Inf values ([#2880](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2880)).\n\n### Updated\n\n- Updated Plotly.js to version 1.55.2. See the [plotly.js CHANGELOG](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/v1.55.2/CHANGELOG.md) for more information. These changes are reflected in the auto-generated `plotly.graph_objects` module.\n- `px.imshow` has a new `binary_string` boolean argument, which passes the\n  image data as a b64 binary string when True. Using binary strings allow for\n  faster image rendering and smaller figure size. Additional optional arguments\n  `binary_backend`, `binary_format` and `binary_compression_level` control\n  how to generate the b64 string ([#2691](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2691)\n- `px.imshow` has a new `contrast_rescaling` argument in order to choose how\n  to set data values corresponding to the bounds of the color range\n  ([#2691](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2691)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Plotly Express no longer converts datetime columns of input dataframes to UTC ([#2749](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2749))\n- Plotly Express has more complete support for datetimes as additional `hover_data` ([#2749](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2749))\n- Histogram selection behaviour with `FigureWidget` ([#2711](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2711)) with thanks to [@meffmadd](https://github.com/meffmadd)\n- Behaviour of `full_html()` with `html=False` ([#2469](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2469)) with thanks to [@tallamjr](https://github.com/tallamjr)\n- `ff.distplot()` now only computes traces that will be shown ([#2730](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2730)) with thanks to [@akbo](https://github.com/akbo)\n- Pandas backend `.hist()` works with latest version of Pandas ([#2713](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2713)) with thanks to [@Kerybas](https://github.com/Kerybas)\n\n\n## [4.9.0] - 2020-07-16\n\n### Added\n\n- Added image export support using [Kaleido](https://github.com/plotly/Kaleido). The image export backend can be configured using the new `engine` argument to `plotly.io.to_image` and `plotly.io.write_image`. The `engine` argument may be set to `\"kaleido\"`, `\"orca\"`, or `\"auto\"`. The default is `engine=\"auto\"`, in which case the Kaleido backend is enabled if the `kaleido` package from PyPI is installed, otherwise Orca is used. ([#2613](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2613)).\n- `plotly.express.timeline()` added as an official alternative to `plotly.figure_factories.create_gantt()` ([#2626](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2626))\n- `create_hexbin_mapbox()` added to Figure Factories, with thanks to [@RenaudLN](https://github.com/RenaudLN) for the impressive contribution!\n- `facet_row_spacing` and `facet_col_spacing` added to Plotly Express cartesian 2d functions ([#2614](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2614))\n- `base` added to Plotly Express `bar` and `bar_polar` functions ([#2626](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2626))\n- `px.NO_COLOR` constant to override wide-form color assignment in Plotly Express ([#2614](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2614))\n\n### Fixed\n\n- trendline traces are now of type `scattergl` when `render_mode=\"webgl\"` in Plotly Express ([#2614](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2614))\n- regression from 4.8.1 whereby `\"parent\"` was not accepted as part of `path` for `px.sunburst()` and `px.treemap()` ([#2640](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2640))\n- `create_dendrogram()` figure factory now works correctly with `scipy` 1.5.1 ([#2627](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2627))\n\n### Updated\n\n- Updated Plotly.js to version 1.54.6. See the [plotly.js CHANGELOG](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/v1.54.6/CHANGELOG.md) for more information.\n- Added all cartesian-2d Plotly Express functions, plus `imshow`, to Pandas backend with `kind` option ([#2541](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2541))\n- `plotly.express.imshow` now uses data frame index and columns names and values to populate axis parameters by default ([#2539](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2539))\n- Javascript extensions are now build using Node 12, and have an updated `package-lock.json` with many fewer security warnings ([#2636](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2636))\n\n\n## [4.8.2] - 2020-06-26\n\n### Updated\n\n- Updated Plotly.js to version 1.54.5. See the [plotly.js CHANGELOG](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/v1.54.5/CHANGELOG.md) for more information.\n- `add_traces()` now accepts bare `int`-like values for `rows`/`cols` as well as lists thereof ([#2546](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2546)), with thanks to [@MCBoarder289](https://github.com/MCBoarder289) for the contribution!\n\n### Fixed\n\n- `row`/`col` now accept `int`-like values, not strictly `int` values ([#2451](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2451)), with thanks to [@MCBoarder289](https://github.com/MCBoarder289) for the contribution!\n- Fixed special cases with `px.sunburst` and `px.treemap` with `path` input ([#2524](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2524))\n- Fixed bug in `hover_data` argument of `px` functions, when the column name is changed with labels and `hover_data` is a dictionary setting up a specific format for the hover data ([#2544](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2544)).\n- Made the Plotly Express `trendline` argument more robust and made it work with datetime `x` values ([#2554](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2554))\n- Fixed bug in `px.sunburst` and `px.treemap`: when the `color` and `values` arguments correspond to the same column, a different aggregation function has to be used for the two arguments ([#2591](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2591))\n- Plotly Express wide mode now accepts mixed integer and float columns ([#2598](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2598))\n- Plotly Express `range_(x|y)` should not impact the unlinked range of marginal subplots ([#2600](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2600))\n- `px.line` now sets `line_group=<variable>` in wide mode by default ([#2599](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2599))\n- Corrected some regex warnings ([#2577](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2577)), with thanks to [@georgevdd](https://github.com/georgevdd) for the contribution!\n\n\n## [4.8.1] - 2020-05-28\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed the accidental removal of some functions and submodules from `plotly.colors` and `plotly.express.colors`\n\n## [4.8.0] - 2020-05-26\n\n### Added\n\n- `plotly` now provides a Plotly Express-backed Pandas-compatible plotting backend, which can be activated via `pandas.options.plotting.backend = \"plotly\"`. Note that it is not intended to implement every Pandas plotting function, nor is it intended to replicate the behaviour of every argument, although per the changes below, `x` and `y` should behave similarly. ([#2336](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2336))\n- New datasets have been added to `plotly.express.data`: `stocks`, `experiment`, `medals_wide` and `medals_long`. ([#2336](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2336))\n- plotly `go.Figure` and `go.FigureWidget` now have a `_repr_html_` and a `_repr_mimebundle_` method, which are [standard hooks for integration in systems based on IPython](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config/integrating.html). In particular, with `_repr_html_` plotly figures can now be used within [sphinx-gallery](https://sphinx-gallery.github.io/stable/index.html) without any scraper. These additions should not change anything to the way plotly figures are displayed in notebook environments, since the `_ipython_display_` method (already present in earlier versions) takes precedence over the new methods.\n\n### Updated\n\n- The behaviour of the `x`, `y`, `orientation`, `histfunc`, `violinmode`, `boxmode` and `stripmode` arguments for 2d-cartesian functions in Plotly Express (i.e. `scatter`, `line`, `area`, `bar`, `histogram`, `violin`, `box`, `strip`, `funnel`, `density_heatmap` and `density_contour`) has been refined ([#2336](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2336)):\n    - if `x` or `y` is missing, it is inferred to be the index of `data_frame` if `data_frame` provided, otherwise a stable index of integers starting at 0. In the case of `px.bar`, if the provided value is not continuous, the missing value is treated as a column of 1s named \"count\", so as to behave more like `px.histogram` and to avoid sizing the resulting bars differently based on their position in the column. Previously, missing values defaulted to integers starting at 0 *per trace* which made it potentially inconsistent or misleading.\n    - if `x` (`y`) is missing, `orientation` now defaults to `v` (`h`). Previously it always defaulted to `v` but this is not considered a breaking change, as the cases in which it now defaults to `h` caused unreadable output if set to `v`.\n    - if both `x` and `y` are provided and one of them does not contain continuous values, `orientation` defaults to the value perpendicular to that axis. Previously it always defaulted to `v` but this is not considered a breaking change, as the cases in which it now defaults to `h` caused unreadable output if set to `v`.\n    - if either `x` or `y` (but not both) may now be provided as a list of column references into `data_frame` or columns of data, in which case the imputed data frame will be treated as \"wide\" data and `melt()`ed internally before applying the usual mapping rules, with function-specific defaults.\n    - if neither `x` nor `y` is provided but `data_frame` is, the data frame will be treated as \"wide\" with defaults depending on the value of `orientation` (and `orientation` has accordingly been added to `scatter`, `line`, `density_heatmap`, and `density_contour` for this purpose). Previously this would have resulted in an empty figure.\n    - if both `x` and `y` are provided to `histogram`, and if `x`, `y` and `z` are provided to `density_heatmap` or `density_contour`, then `histfunc` now defaults to `sum` so as to avoid ignoring the provided data, and to cause `histogram` and `bar` to behave more similarly.\n    - `violinmode`, `boxmode` and `stripmode` now default to `overlay` if `x` (`y`) in in `v` (`h`) orientation is also mapped to `color`, to avoid strange spacing issues with the previous default of `group` in all cases.\n- The Plotly Express arguments `color_discrete_map`, `symbol_map` and `line_dash_map` now accept the string `\"identity\"` which causes the corresponding input data to be used as-is rather than mapped into `color_discrete_sequence`, `symbol_sequence` or `line_dash_sequence`, respectively. ([#2336](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2336))\n- Plotly Express now accepts `px.Constant` or `px.Range` objects in the place of column references so as to express constant or increasing integer values. ([#2336](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2336))\n\n\n## [4.7.1] - 2020-05-08\n\n### Fixed\n\n - Fix `AttributeError: module 'plotly.graph_objs' has no attribute 'FigureWidget'` exception on `from plotly.graph_objs import *` when `ipywidgets` is not installed. Error also occurred when importing `plotly.figure_factor`. It is now possible to import `plotly.graph_objs.FigureWidget` when `ipywidgets` is not installed, and an informative `ImportError` exception will be raised in the `FigureWidget` constructor ([#2443](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/2443), [#1111](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1111)).\n - Fix `TypeError: unhashable type: 'Template'` during `Figure` construction when `plotly.io.templates.default` is set to a `Template` object rather than a string.\n\n\n## [4.7.0] - 2020-05-06\n\n### Updated\n\n- Updated Plotly.js to version 1.54.1. See the [plotly.js CHANGELOG](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/v1.54.1/CHANGELOG.md) for more information. The main new feature of this version of Plotly.js is the possibility to draw layout shapes, using custom dragmodes and corresponding modebar buttons.\n- The sphinx-gallery scraper has been updated to work with different structures of galleries [#2149](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2419)\n\n### Added\n\n- The `hover_data` parameter of `px` functions can now be a dictionary. This makes it possible to skip hover information for some arguments or to change the formatting of hover information [#2377](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2377).\n- It's now possible to build a development version of Plotly.py against the build artifacts from a non-`master` branch of Plotly.js, which makes for faster QA and development cycles [#2349](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2349). Thanks [@zouhairm](https://github.com/zouhairm) for this Pull Request!\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Plotly Express trendlines now handle missing data correctly [#2357](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2357)\n\n### Performance\n\nThis version includes several performance improvements ([#2368](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2368), [#2403](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2403)).\n\n - Child graph objects (e.g. `figure.layout.xaxis`) are no longer created eagerly during graph object construction. Instead, they are created lazily the first time the property is accessed.\n - Property validation is now disabled for select internal operations.\n - When used with Python 3.7 and above, plotly.py now takes advantage of [PEP-562](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0562/) to perform submodule imports lazily.  This dramatically improves import times.\n\n## [4.6.0] - 2020-03-31\n\n### Updated\n\n - Updated Plotly.js to version 1.53.0. See the [plotly.js CHANGELOG](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/v1.53.0/CHANGELOG.md) for more information on the numerous new features and bug fixes of this release. The main features of the Plotly.js release are\n    - Introduce range breaks on date axes (for example, to remove week-ends) via `layout.xaxis.rangebreaks`\n    - Introduce a new unified x (or y) hovermode (`layout.hovermode=\"x unified\"`), in which the hover box shows the information for all traces at a given x (or y) position\n    - Add `node.customdata` and `link.customdata` to sankey traces\n- Updated [contributing notes](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/blob/master/contributing.md) for more explanations on how to contribute to plotly.py [#2290](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/2290).

See the [version 4 announcement](https://community.plot.ly/t/introducing-plotly-py-4-0-0rc1/25639) for a summary of the important changes.\n\n### Updated\n - Updated Plotly.js to version 1.48.3. See the\n [plotly.js CHANGELOG](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1483----2019-06-13)\n for more information.\n\n### Added\n - The Plotly Express tech preview (https://medium.com/@plotlygraphs/introducing-plotly-express-808df010143d) has been integrated as the `plotly.express` module ([#1613](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1613))\n - Added a new renderers framework the supports rendering figure in a wide variety of contexts ([#1474](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1474)). See the new [Displaying Plotly Figures](https://plot.ly/python/next/renderers) documentation page for more information.\n - Added `plotly.io.write_html` and `plotly.io.to_html` functions for exporting figures to HTML ([1474](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1474)). Also available as `.write_html` and `.to_html` figure methods.\n - Added new figure methods for batch updating figure properties (`update_layout`, `update_traces`, `update_xaxes`, etc.) ([#1624](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1624)).  See the new [Creating and Updating Figures](https://plot.ly/python/next/creating-and-updating-figures/) documentation page for more details.\n - Added support for all trace types in `make_subplots` ([#1528](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1528))\n - Added support for secondary y-axes in `make_subplots` ([#1564](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1564))\n - Support passing a scalar trace object (rather than a list or tuple of trace objects) as the `data` property to the `Figure` constructor ([#1614](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1614))\n - Added dictionary-style `.pop` method to graph object classes ([#1614](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1614))\n - New `jupyterlab-plotly` JupyterLab extension for rendering figures in JupyterLab. Replaces the `@jupyterlab/plotly-extension` extension, and includes JupyterLab 1.0 support.\n - Added new suite of built-in colorscales to the `plotly.colors` module, and support for specifying this wide range of colorscales by name. Also added support for specifying colorscales as a list of colors, in which case the color spacing is assumed to be uniform ([#1647](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1647)).\n - Added `sphinx-gallery` renderer for embedding plotly figures in [Sphinx-Gallery](https://sphinx-gallery.github.io/) ([#1577](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1577), [plotly/plotly-sphinx-gallery](https://github.com/plotly/plotly-sphinx-gallery)).\n\n### Removed\n - The follow modules for interfacing with the Chart Studio cloud service have been removed from plotly.py and moved to the new `chart-studio` distribution package.  The following modules have been moved to a new top-level `chart_studio` module:\n   - `plotly.plotly` -> `chart_studio.plotly`\n   - `plotly.api` -> `chart_studio.api`\n   - `plotly.dashboard_objs` -> `chart_studio.dashboard_objs`\n   - `plotly.grid_objs` -> `chart_studio.grid_objs`\n   - `plotly.presentation_objs` -> `chart_studio.presentation_objs`\n - The legacy `plotly.widgets.GraphWidget` class for displaying online figures hosted by Chart Studio as ipywidgets has been removed. Please use the offline, and much more capable, `plotly.graph_objects.FigureWidget` class instead.\n - The `fileopt` argument to `chart_studio.plotly.plot` has been removed, so in-place modifications to previously published figures are no longer supported, and a figure will always overwrite a figure with the same name.\n\n### Changed\n - The `'plotly'` template is used as the default theme across all figures.\n - In order to reduce the size of the core `plotly` distribution package, the bundled geographic shape files used by the `create_choropleth` figure factory have been moved to a new optional `plotly-geo` distribution package ([1604](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1604))\n - For consistency with other figure factories, the `create_choropleth`  and `create_gantt` figure factories now always returns `Figure` objects, rather than dictionaries ([#1600](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1600), [#1607](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1607)).\n - Figure add trace methods (`.add_trace`, `.add_traces`, `.add_scatter`, etc.) now return a reference to the calling figure, rather than the newly created trace ([#1624](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1624))\n - `plotly.tools.make_subplots` has been moved to `plotly.subplots.make_subplots`, though it is still available at the previous location for backward compatibility\n - The `plotly.graph_objs` module has been moved to `plotly.graph_objects`, though it is still available at the previous location for backward compatibility ([#1614](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1614))\n - Trace `uid` properties are only generated automatically when a trace is added to a `FigureWidget`.  When a trace is added to a standard `Figure` graph object the input `uid`, if provided, is accepted as is ([#1580](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1580)).\n - `datetime` objects that include timezones are not longer converted to UTC ([#1581](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1581))\n - When a tuple property (e.g. `layout.annotations`) is updated with a list/tuple that is longer than the current value, the extra elements are appended to the end of the tuple.\n\n### Fixed\n - Fixed visibility of `bar` trace error bars in built-in templates ([1656](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1656))\n\n\n## [3.10.0] - 2019-05-31\n\n### Updated\n - Updated Plotly.js to version 1.48.1.

See the\n [plotly.js CHANGELOG](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1431----2018-12-21)\n for more information.\n\n### Changed\n - Plotly.js 1.43 converted `title` properties (e.g. `layout.title`) from\n strings into compound objects that contain the text as the `text` property\n along with new title placement attributes `x`, `y`, `xref`, `yref`, `xanchor`,\n `yanchor` and `pad`. Plotly.py 3.5.0 follows the new schema, but still\n supports specifying `title` as a string, in which case the string is assigned\n to the `title.text` property\n ([#1302](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1302))\n - Plotly.js 1.43 also moved existing `title*` properties\n (e.g. `layout.titlefont`) under the `title` object (e.g. `layout.title.font`).\n Plotly.py 3.5.0 follows the new schema, but still\n supports the legacy `title*` properties by mapping them to the corresponding\n `title.*` property\n ([#1302](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1302))\n - The `update` method on `graph_objs` now returns the updated object in order\n to support chaining multiple update operations together\n ([#1379](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1379))\n - The `show_link` option has been set to `False` by default in the offline\n `plot` and `iplot` functions. Now that the \"send data to cloud\" button has\n been disabled by default in plotly.js 1.43.0, no buttons/links will be\n displayed by default that result in data being sent off of the local machine\n ([#1304](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1304))\n - `config` options that are not known by plotly.py result in a warning but are\n still passed along to plotly.js. Prior to this change these unknown options\n were dropped silently\n ([#1290](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1290))\n - Built-in themes now specify colorscales using the new global\n `layout.colorscale` properties.  Previously the colorscales were defined for\n each trace type individually. This reduces the size of the resulting theme\n files\n ([#1303](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1303))\n - Increased the maximum retry time of the orca integration from 8s to 30s\n ([#1297](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1297))\n\n### Fixed\n - Fixed `FigureWidget` performance regression that, when working with\n large datasets, resulted in a slight freeze of the widget after user\n interactions (pan, zoom, etc)\n ([1305](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1305))\n - Fix orca error when the `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` environment variable is set\n ([#1293](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1293))\n - The `'responsive'` config key was being silently blocked\n ([#1290](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1290))\n - Fixed error when using unicode characters in string properties on Python 2\n ([#1289](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1289))\n - Removed invalid calls to non-existent `validate` and `strip_style` `Figure`\n methods in matplotlylib conversion logic\n ([#1128](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1128))\n\n## [3.4.2] - 2018-11-23\n\n### Fixed\n - `config` options are now supported when using `plotly.offline.iplot` to\n display a figure in JupyterLab. Requires version 0.18.1 of the\n `@jupyterlab/plotly-extension` extension.\n ([#1281](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1281),\n [jupyterlab/jupyter-renderers#168](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyter-renderers/pull/168))\n - Custom `plotly_domain` values are now supported in FigureWidget in both\n the classic notebook and JupyterLab\n ([#1284](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1284))\n\n## [3.4.1] - 2018-11-09\n\n### Updated\n - Updated Plotly.js to version 1.42.5. See the\n [plotly.js CHANGELOG](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1423----2018-11-06)\n for more information.\n\n### Fixed\n - Fixed histogram binning with pandas `Series` or numpy array\n (regression introduced in 3.4.0)\n ([#1257](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1257),\n  [plotly/plotly.js#3211](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/3211))\n - Fixed incorrect validation error on the `args` property of\n  `layout.updatemenu.Button()` when value is a `list` that starts with a `list`\n  ([#1265](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1265))\n - Fixed deadlock causing `plotly.io.write_image` to hang on Windows after\n exporting more than ~25 images\n ([#1255](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1255))\n - Fixed plot display error for `scattergl` trace with `mode='lines'` and\n more than 100k points\n ([#1271](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1271))\n - Fixed responsive resizing error with `iplot` in the classic notebook\n ([#1263](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1263))\n\n## [3.4.0] - 2018-11-02\n\n### Updated\n - Updated Plotly.js to version 1.42.2. Select highlights included below, see\n the [plotly.js CHANGELOG](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1422----2018-11-01)\n for more information.\n\n### Added\n - Default figure properties may now be customized using figure\n templates (themes) and 7 new predefined templates are bundled with\n plotly.py\n ([#1224](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1224))\n - Added Parallel Categories (`parcats`) trace type for the visualization\n of multi-dimensional categorical datasets\n ([plotly/plotly.js#2963](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2963))\n - Added LaTeX typesetting support for figures displayed in the Jupyter\n Notebook using `plotly.offline.iplot` and `plotly.graph_objs.FigureWidget`.\n **Note:** There are still outstanding issues with MathJax rendering in FireFox,\n but it is now working well in Chrome.\n ([#1243](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1243))\n - Added `include_mathjax` argument to `plotly.offline.plot` to support\n the creation of HTML files with LaTeX typesetting\n ([#1243](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1243))\n - Added new `plotly.offline.get_plotlyjs` function that returns the\n contents of the bundled plotly.js library as a string\n ([#637](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/637),\n  [#1246](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1246))\n - Added new `plotly.offline.get_plotlyjs_version` function that returns\n the version of the bundled plotly.js library\n ([#1246](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1246))\n - HTML div strings returned by `plotly.offline.plot` now contain logic\n to automatically resize the figure responsively.

This can be used to point\n   to a plotly.js bundle from an alternative CDN.\n - Added a new `color_threshold` argument to the `create_dendrogram` figure\n factory to control the dendrogram clustering cutoff\n ([#995](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/995),\n  [#1075](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1075),\n  [#1214](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1214))\n - Added support for `autorange='reversed'` in 3D axes\n ([#803](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/803),\n  [plotly/plotly.js#3141](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/3141))\n - Added new gl3d tick and title auto-rotation algorithm that limits text\n overlaps\n ([plotly/plotly.js#3084](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/3084),\n  [plotly/plotly.js#3131](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/3131))\n - Added `modebar` layout style attributes:\n `orientation`, `bgcolor`, `color` and `activecolor`\n ([plotly/plotly.js#3068](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/3068),\n  [plotly/plotly.js#3091](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/3091))\n - Added `title`, `titleposition` and `titlefont` attributes to pie traces\n ([plotly/plotly.js#2987](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2987))\n - Added `hoverlabel.split` attribute to `ohlc` and `candlestick` traces to\n split hover labels into multiple pieces\n ([plotly/plotly.js#2959](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2959))\n - Added support for `line.shape` values `'hv'`, `'vh'`, `'hvh'`\n and `'vhv'` in `scattergl` traces\n ([plotly/plotly.js#3087](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/3087))\n - Added trace, node and link `hoverinfo` for `sankey` traces\n ([#3096](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/3096),\n  [#3150](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/3150))\n - Added per-sector `textfont` settings in pie traces\n ([#3130](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/3130))\n\n\n### Changed\n - Use new Plotly logo in \"Produced with Plotly\" modebar button\n ([plotly/plotly.js#3068](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/3068))\n\n\n### Fixed\n - Plotly's use of MathJax for LaTeX typesetting no longer interferes with\n the Jupyter Notebook's use of MathJax\n ([#445](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/445),\n  [#360](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/360))\n - Fixed several issues with the use of `reversescale=True` in the\n `create_annotated_heatmap` figure factory\n ([#1251](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1251))\n - Fixed case where `plotly.offline.iplot` would fail to render in the classic\n Jupyter Notebook if the notebook contained a Markdown headline with the text\n \"Plotly\"\n ([#816](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/816))\n - `None` values in a `scatter.hovertext` list are now omitted from the\n hover label rather than being displayed as the string `\"None\"`\n ([#1244](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1244))\n - Subplot titles created by `plotly.tools.make_subplots` are now positioned\n properly when custom `row_width`/`column_width` arguments are specified\n ([#1229](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1229))\n - The `bar.width` property may now be specified as a numpy array or a pandas\n series\n ([#1231](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1231),\n [plotly/plotly.js#3169](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/3169))\n - Error bars are now scaled correctly for logarithmic `scatter3d` traces\n ([#1139](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1139))\n - Use `uuid.uuid4` rather than `uuid.uuid1` to work around an upstream\n Python bug\n  ([#1235](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1235),\n   [#1236](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1236))\n - The `layout.grid.subplots` property may now be specified as a 2D list of\n subplot identifiers\n ([#1220](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1220),\n  [#1240](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1240))\n - Fixed `scatter3d` text alignment\n ([#1055](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1055),\n  [plotly/plotly.js#3180](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/3180))\n\n\n### JupyterLab Versions\nFor use with JupyterLab, the following versions of the following packages\nmust be installed:\n\n - Python Packages\n   - plotly==3.4.0\n   - ipywidgets>=7.2\n   - notebook>=5.3\n   - jupyterlab==0.35\n\n - JupyterLab Extensions\n   - plotlywidget@0.5.0\n   - @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager@0.38\n   - @jupyterlab/plotly-extension@0.18\n\n## [3.3.0] - 2018-09-28\n\n### Updated\n - Updated Plotly.js to version 1.41.3.  Select highlights included below, see\n [the plotly.js CHANGELOG](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1413----2018-09-25)\n for more information.\n - Do not create or check permissions on the `~/.plotly` configuration\n directory until a configuration write operation is performed\n ([#1195](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1195)).

The exception is logged and plotly.py continues as if\n the dependency were not installed\n ([#1192](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1192))\n - Fixed invalid dendrogram axis labels when the points being clustered contain\n duplicate values\n ([#1186](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1186))\n - Added missing LICENSE.txt file to PyPI source distribution\n ([#765](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/765))\n\n### JupyterLab Versions\nFor use with JupyterLab, the following versions of the following packages\nmust be installed:\n\n - Python Packages\n   - plotly==3.3.0\n   - ipywidgets>=7.2\n   - notebook>=5.3\n   - jupyterlab==0.34\n\n - JupyterLab Extensions\n   - plotlywidget@0.4.0\n   - @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager@0.37\n   - @jupyterlab/plotly-extension@0.17\n\n## [3.2.1] - 2018-09-14\nThis is a patch release that fixes a few bugs and reintroduces a few\nversion 2 features that were not supported in version 3.\n\nThe bundled version of plotly.js remains at 1.40.1\n\n### JupyterLab Versions\nFor use with JupyterLab, the following versions of the following packages\nmust be installed:\n\n - Python Packages\n   - plotly==3.2.1\n   - ipywidgets>=7.2\n   - notebook>=5.3\n   - jupyterlab==0.34\n\n - JupyterLab Extensions\n   - plotlywidget@0.3.0\n   - @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager@0.37\n   - @jupyterlab/plotly-extension@0.17\n\n### Added\n - An optional `skip_invalid` argument has been added to the `Figure` and\n  `FigureWidget` constructors. By default, `skip_invalid` is `False` and invalid\n  figure properties will result in an exception (this is identical to the\n  previous behavior).  When `skip_invalid` is set to `True`, invalid properties\n  will instead be silently ignored. This argument replaces the `_raise`\n  argument that was available in version 2, and makes it possible to import\n  figure definitions from different plotly versions, where incompatible\n  properties are ignored rather than causing an exception.\n - A `to_ordered_dict` method has been added to the `Figure` and `FigureWidget`\n  classes. This method returns a representation of the figure as a nested\n  structure of `OrderedDict` and `list` instances where the keys in each\n  `OrderedDict` are sorted alphabetically.  This method replaces the\n  `get_ordered` method that was available in version 2, and makes it possible\n  to traverse the nested structure of a figure in a deterministic order.\n\n### Fixed\n - Pandas `Series` and `Index` objects storing `datetime` values were\n   incorrectly cast to numeric arrays\n   ([plotly/plotly.py#1160](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1160),\n    [plotly/plotly.py#1163](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1163))\n - Numpy arrays with `uint64` datatype caused a `FigureWidget` error,\n   and no figure was displayed\n   ([plotly/plotly.py#1155](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1155),\n    [plotly/plotly.py#1163](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1163))\n\n## [3.2.0] - 2018-09-05\nThis release introduces the long-anticipated ability to programmatically\nexport figures as high quality static images in both raster and vector\nformats.\n\n### JupyterLab Versions (Python 3.5+)\nFor use with JupyterLab, the following versions of the following packages\nmust be installed:\n\n - Python Packages\n   - plotly==3.2.0\n   - ipywidgets>=7.2\n   - notebook>=5.3\n   - jupyterlab==0.34\n\n - JupyterLab Extensions\n   - plotlywidget@0.3.0\n   - @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager@0.37\n   - @jupyterlab/plotly-extension@0.17\n\n### Added\n - plotly.js version 1.40.1, which introduces the following features:\n    - Allow `contour`, `contourcarpet` and `histogram2dcontour` to have corresponding legend items using `showlegend`\n      ([plotly/plotly.js#2891](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2891),\n      [plotly/plotly.js#2914](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2914))\n    - Add scatterpolar and scatterpolargl attributes `r0`, `dr`, `theta0` and `dtheta`\n      ([plotly/plotly.js#2895](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2895))\n    - Add layout attributes `piecolorway` and `extendpiecolors` for more control over pie colors\n      ([plotly/plotly.js#2870](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2870))\n    - Add `splom` attribute `dimensions[i].axis.type` to easily override axis type in splom-generated axes\n      ([plotly/plotly.js#2899](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2870))\n    - Add support for on-graph text in `scatterpolargl` traces\n      ([plotly/plotly.js#2895](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/pull/2895))\n    - See [the plotly.js CHANGELOG](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1400----2018-08-16)\n      for bug fixes and more information.\n - Support for offline static image export with the `to_image` and `write_image`\n   functions in the new `plotly.io` package ([#1120](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1120)).\n    - Note: Image export requires the plotly [orca](https://github.com/plotly/orca)\n      command line utility and the [`psutil`](https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil) Python package.\n - New documentation sections covering [Static Image Export](https://plot.ly/python/static-image-export/)\n   and [Orca Management](https://plot.ly/python/orca-management/)\n - Support for displaying `FigureWidget` instances in static contexts\n   (e.g. [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/)) just like the built-in ipywidgets\n ([#1117](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/1117))\n - Full integration of the Cividis colorscale ([#883](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/883))\n - conda packaging\n   - From here forward, new versions of plotly.py will be published to the [plotly anaconda channel](https://anaconda.org/plotly/)\n     on the same day they are published to PyPI.\n     ([72ad0e4](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/commit/72ad0e4bf54bb8a06445d2ca55488ffc11c836a7))\n   - The [`README`](packages/python/plotly-geo/README.md) now includes conda installation instructions alongside the pip instructions.\n   - In addition to the existing installation approaches, orca is now also available as a\n     [conda package](https://anaconda.org/plotly/plotly-orca) from the plotly anaconda channel.\n\n### Updated\n -

It has been removed from PyPI\n\n## [3.0.0] - 2018-07-05\n\nThis is a major version with many exciting updates. See the [Introducing plotly.py 3.0.0](https://medium.com/@plotlygraphs/introducing-plotly-py-3-0-0-7bb1333f69c6) post for more information.\n\n### JupyterLab plotlywidget version: 0.1.1\n\n### Plotly.js version: 1.38.3\n\n### Added\n- Full Jupyter ipywidgets integration with the new `graph_objs.FigureWidget` class\n- `FigureWidget` figures can be updated interactively using property assignment syntax\n- The full trace and layout API is generated from the plotly schema to provide a great experience for interactive use in the notebook\n- Support for setting array properties as numpy arrays. When numpy arrays are used, ipywidgets binary serialization protocol is used to avoid converting these to JSON strings.\n- Context manager API for animation. Run `help(go.Figure().batch_animate)` for the full doc string.\n- Perform automatic retries when communicating with plot.ly services. This introduces a new required dependency on the [retrying](https://pypi.org/project/retrying/) library.\n- Improved data validation covering the full API with clear, informative error messages. This means that incorrect properties and/or values now always raise a `ValueError` with a description of the error, the invalid property, and the available properties on the level that it was placed in the graph object. Eg. `go.Scatter(foo=123)` raises a validation error. See https://plot.ly/python/reference/ for a reference to all valid properties and values in the Python API.\n- Error message for `plotly.figure_factory.create_choropleth` is now helpful to Anaconda users who do not have the correct modules installed for the County Choropleth figure factory.\n\n### Changed / Deprecated\nPlease see the [migration guid](migration-guide.md) for a full list of the changes and deprecations in version 3.0.0\n\n\n\n## [2.7.0] - 2018-05-23\n### Updated\n- Updated `plotly.min.js` to version 1.38.0.\n  - New features include a `3D cone` trace to visualize vector fields.\n  - See [the plotly.js CHANGELOG](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1380----2018-05-23) for additional information regarding the updates.\n\n## [2.6.0] - 2018-05-09\n### Updated\n- Updated `plotly.min.js` to version 1.37.1.\n  - New features include a `splom` (scatter plot matrix) trace type.\n  - See [the plotly.js CHANGELOG](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1371----2018-05-02) for additional information regarding the updates.\n- Error message for `plotly.figure_factory.create_choropleth` is more helpful for Windows users on installing `geopandas` and dependencies including `shapely`.\n\n## [2.5.1] - 2018-03-26\n### Fixed\n- `plotly.figure_factory.create_choropleth` now works in Windows without raising an OSError. The module now uses cross-platform path tools from `os` to manipulate and manage the shapefiles contained in this package.\n\n## [2.5.0] - 2018-03-12\n### Fixed\n- `import plotly.figure_factory` does not fail if `pandas` is not installed.

Previously either a `PlotlyError`, `PlotlyRequestException`, or a\n`requests.exceptions.ReqestException` could be raised. In particular, scripts\nwhich depend on `try-except` blocks containing network requests should be\nrevisited.\n- `plotly.py:sign_in` now validates to the plotly server specified in your\n  config. If it cannot make a successful request, it raises a `PlotlyError`.\n- `plotly.figure_factory` will raise an `ImportError` if `numpy` is not\n  installed.\n- `plotly.figure_factory.create_violin()` now has a `rugplot` parameter which\n  determines whether or not a rugplot is draw beside each violin plot.\n\n### Deprecated\n- `plotly.tools.FigureFactory`. Use `plotly.figure_factory.*`.\n- (optional imports) `plotly.tools._*_imported` It was private anyhow, but now\nit's gone. (e.g., `_numpy_imported`)\n- (plotly v2 helper) `plotly.py._api_v2` It was private anyhow, but now it's\ngone.\n\n## [1.13.0] - 2016-12-17\n### Added\n- Python 3.5 has been added as a tested environment for this package.\n\n### Updated\n- `plotly.plotly.create_animations` and `plotly.plotly.icreate_animations` now return appropriate error messages if the response is not successful.\n- `frames` are now integrated into GRAPH_REFERENCE and figure validation.\n\n### Changed\n- The plot-schema from `https://api.plot.ly/plot-schema` is no longer updated on import.\n\n## [1.12.12] - 2016-12-06\n### Updated\n- Updated `plotly.min.js` to version 1.20.5 for `plotly.offline`.\n  - See [the plotly.js CHANGELOG](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for additional information regarding the updates.\n- `FF.create_scatterplotmatrix` now by default does not show the trace labels for the box plots, only if `diag=box` is selected for the diagonal subplot type.\n\n## [1.12.11] - 2016-12-01\n### Fixed\n- The `link text` in the bottom right corner of the offline plots now properly displays `Export to [Domain Name]` for the given domain name set in the users' `.config` file.\n\n## [1.12.10] - 2016-11-28\n### Updated\n- `FF.create_violin` and `FF.create_scatterplotmatrix` now by default do not print subplot grid information in output\n- Removed alert that occurred when downloading plot images offline. Please note: for higher resolution images and more export options, consider making requests to our image servers. See: `help(py.image)` for more details.\n\n### Added\n- Plot configuration options for offline plots. See the list of [configuration options](https://github.com/Rikorose/plotly.py/blob/master/plotly/offline/offline.py#L189) and [examples](https://plot.ly/javascript/configuration-options/) for more information.\n  - Please note that these configuration options are for offline plots ONLY. For configuration options when embedding online plots please see our [embed tutorial](http://help.plot.ly/embed-graphs-in-websites/#step-8-customize-the-iframe).\n- `colors.py` file which contains functions for manipulating and validating colors and arrays of colors\n- 'scale' param in `FF.create_trisurf` which now can set the interpolation on the colorscales\n- animations now work in offline mode. By running `plotly.offline.plot()` and `plotly.offline.iplot()` with a `fig` with `frames`, the resulting plot will cycle through the figures defined in `frames` either in the browser or in an ipython notebook respectively. Here's an example:\n```\nimport IPython.display\nfrom IPython.display import display, HTML\nfrom plotly.offline import download_plotlyjs, init_notebook_mode, plot, iplot\ninit_notebook_mode(connected=True)\n\nfigure_or_data = {'data': [{'x': [1, 2], 'y': [0, 1]}],\n                  'layout': {'xaxis': {'range': [0, 3], 'autorange': False},\n                             'yaxis': {'range': [0, 20], 'autorange': False},\n                  'title': 'First Title'},\n                  'frames': [{'data': [{'x': [1, 2], 'y': [5, 7]}]},\n                             {'data': [{'x': [-1, 3], 'y': [3, 9]}]},\n                             {'data': [{'x': [2, 2.6], 'y': [7, 5]}]},\n                             {'data': [{'x': [1.5, 3], 'y': [7.5, 4]}]},\n                             {'data': [{'x': [1, 2], 'y': [0, 1]}],\n                              'layout': {'title': 'End Title'}}]}\niplot(figure_or_data)\n```\nMore examples can be found at https://plot.ly/python/animations/.\n- animations now work in online mode: use `plotly.plotly.create_animations` and `plotly.plotly.icreate_animations` which animate a figure with the `frames` argument. Here is a simple example:\n```\nimport plotly.plotly as py\nfrom plotly.grid_objs import Grid, Column\n\ncolumn_1 = Column([0.5], 'x')\ncolumn_2 = Column([0.5], 'y')\ncolumn_3 = Column([1.5], 'x2')\ncolumn_4 = Column([1.5], 'y2')\n\ngrid = Grid([column_1, column_2, column_3, column_4])\npy.grid_ops.upload(grid, 'ping_pong_grid', auto_open=False)\n\n# create figure\nfigure = {\n    'data': [\n        {\n            'xsrc': grid.get_column_reference('x'),\n            'ysrc': grid.get_column_reference('y'),\n            'mode': 'markers',\n        }\n    ],\n    'layout': {'title': 'Ping Pong Animation',\n               'xaxis': {'range': [0, 2], 'autorange': False},\n               'yaxis': {'range': [0, 2], 'autorange': False},\n               'updatemenus': [{\n                   'buttons': [\n                       {'args': [None],\n                        'label': u'Play',\n                        'method': u'animate'}\n               ],\n               'pad': {'r': 10, 't': 87},\n               'showactive': False,\n               'type': 'buttons'\n                }]},\n    'frames': [\n        {\n            'data': [\n                {\n                    'xsrc': grid.get_column_reference('x2'),\n                    'ysrc': grid.get_column_reference('y2'),\n                    'mode': 'markers',\n                }\n            ]\n        },\n        {\n            'data': [\n                {\n                    'xsrc': grid.get_column_reference('x'),\n                    'ysrc': grid.get_column_reference('y'),\n                    'mode': 'markers',\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\npy.create_animations(figure, 'ping_pong')\n```\n\n### Fixed\n- Trisurf now uses correct `Plotly Colorscales` when called\n- Fixed a bug in the format of unique-identifiers in columns of grids that are uploaded to plotly via `plotly.plotly.upload`. See https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/pull/599 for details. In particular, creating plots that are based off of plotly grids is no longer broken. Here is an example:\n\n```\nimport plotly.plotly as py\nfrom plotly.grid_objs import Grid, Column\n\nc1 = Column([6, 6, 6, 5], 'column 1')\nc2 = Column(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], 'column 2')\ng = Grid([c1, c2])\n\n# Upload the grid\npy.grid_ops.upload(g, 'my-grid', auto_open=False)\n\n# Make a graph that with data that is referenced from that grid\ntrace = Scatter(xsrc=g[0], ysrc=g[1])\nurl = py.plot([trace], filename='my-plot')\n```\nThen, whenever you update the data in `'my-grid'`, the associated plot will update too. See https://plot.ly/python/data-api for more details on usage and examples.\n\n## [1.12.9] - 2016-08-22\n### Fixed\n- the colorbar in `.create_trisurf` now displays properly in `offline mode`.\n\n### Updated\n- the colorbar in `.create_trisurf` now displays the appropriate max and min values on the ends of the bar which corresponding to the coloring metric of the figure\n- `edges_color` is now a param in `.create_trisurf` which only takes `rgb` values at the moment\n\n## [1.12.8] - 2016-08-18\n### Fixed\n- Fixed color bug with trisurf plots where certain triangles were colored strangely. The coordinates of `rgb(...)` are now rounded to their nearest integer (using Python3 method of rounding), then placed in the color string to fix the issue.\n\n## [1.12.7] - 2016-08-17\n### Fixed\n- Edited `plotly.min.js` due to issue using `iplot` to plot offline in Jupyter Notebooks\n  - Please note that `plotly.min.js` may be cached in your Jupyter Notebook. Therefore, if you continue to experience this issue after upgrading the Plotly package please open a new notebook or clear the cache to ensure the correct `plotly.min.js` is referenced.\n\n## [1.12.6] - 2016-08-09\n### Updated\n- Updated `plotly.min.js` from 1.14.1 to 1.16.2\n  - Trace type scattermapbox is now part of the main bundle\n  - Add updatemenus (aka dropdowns) layout components\n  - See [the plotly.js CHANGELOG](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for additional information regarding the updates\n\n## [1.12.5] - 2016-08-03\n### Updated\n- `.create_trisurf` now supports a visible colorbar for the trisurf plots.

In `create_scatterplotmatrix`, users can now:\n  - Input a list of different color types (hex, tuple, rgb) to `colormap` to map colors divergently\n  - Use the same list to categorically group the items in the index column\n  - Pass a singlton color type to `colormap` to color all the data with one color\n  - Input a dictionary to `colormap` to map index values to a specific color\n  - 'cat' and 'seq' are valid options for `colormap_type`, which specify the type of colormap being used\n\n- In `create_trisurf`, the parameter `dist_func` has been replaced by `color_func`. Users can now:\n  - Input a list of different color types (hex, tuple, rgb) to `colormap` to map colors divergently\n  - Input a list|array of hex and rgb colors to `color_func` to assign each simplex to a color\n\n### Added\n- Added the option to load plotly.js from a CDN by setting the parameter `connected=True`\n in the `init_notebook_mode()` function call\n- The FigureFactory can now create trisurf plots with `.create_trisurf`. Check it out with:\n```\nimport plotly.tools as tls\nhelp(tls.FigureFactory.create_trisurf)\n```\n\n\n\n## [1.10.0] - 2016-05-19\n### Fixed\n- Version 1.9.13 fixed an issue in offline mode where if you ran `init_notebook_mode`\nmore than once the function would skip importing (because it saw that it had\nalready imported the library) but then accidentally clear plotly.js from the DOM.\nThis meant that if you ran `init_notebook_mode` more than once, your graphs would\nnot appear when you refreshed the page.\nVersion 1.9.13 solved this issue by injecting plotly.js with every iplot call.\nWhile this works, it also injects the library excessively, causing notebooks\nto have multiple versions of plotly.js inline in the DOM, potentially making\nnotebooks with many `iplot` calls very large.\nVersion 1.10.0 brings back the requirement to call `init_notebook_mode` before\nmaking an `iplot` call. It makes `init_notebook_mode` idempotent: you can call\nit multiple times without worrying about losing your plots on refresh.\n\n\n## [1.9.13] - 2016-05-19\n### Fixed\n- Fixed issue in offline mode related to the inability to reload plotly.js on page refresh and extra init_notebook_mode calls.\n\n## [1.9.12] - 2016-05-16\n### Added\n- SSL support for streaming.\n\n## [1.9.11] - 2016-05-02\n### Added\n- The FigureFactory can now create scatter plot matrices with `.create_scatterplotmatrix`. Check it out with:\n```\nimport plotly.tools as tls\nhelp(tls.FigureFactory.create_scatterplotmatrix)\n```\n\n## [1.9.10] - 2016-04-27\n### Updated\n- Updated plotly.min.js so the offline mode is using plotly.js v1.10.0\n  - Added beta versions of two new 2D WebGL trace types: heatmapgl, contourgl\n  - Added fills for scatterternary traces\n  - Added configurable shapes layer positioning with the shape attribute: `layer`\n\n## [1.9.9] - 2016-04-15\n### Fixed\n- Fixed `require is not defined` issue when plotting offline outside of Ipython Notebooks.\n\n## [1.9.8] - 2016-04-14\n### Fixed\n- Error no longer results from a \"Run All\" cells when working in a Jupyter Notebook.\n\n### Updated\n- Updated plotly.min.js so offline is using plotly.js v1.9.0\n  - Added Ternary plots with support for scatter traces (trace type `scatterternary`, currently only available in offline mode)\n  - For comprehensive update list see the [plotly.js CHANGELOG](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)\n\n## [1.9.7] - 2016-04-04\n### Fixed\n- Offline mode will no longer delete the Jupyter Notebook's require, requirejs, and define variables.\n\n### Updated\n- Updated plotly.min.js so offline is using plotly.js v1.8.0\n  - Added range selector functionality for cartesian plots\n  - Added range slider functionality for scatter traces\n  - Added custom surface color functionality\n  - Added ability to subplot multiple graph types (SVG cartesian, 3D, maps, pie charts)\n  - For comprehensive update list see the [plotly.js CHANGELOG](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)\n\n## [1.9.6] - 2016-02-18\n### Updated\n- Updated plotly.min.js so offline is using plotly.js v1.5.2\n\n## [1.9.5] - 2016-01-17\n### Added\n- Offline matplotlib to Plotly figure conversion. Use `offline.plot_mpl` to convert and plot a matplotlib figure as a Plotly figure independently of IPython/Jupyter notebooks or use `offline.iplot_mpl` to convert and plot inside of IPython/Jupyter notebooks. Additionally, use `offline.enable_mpl_offline` to convert and plot all matplotlib figures as plotly figures inside an IPython/Jupyter notebook. See examples below:\n\nAn example independent of IPython/Jupyter notebooks:\n```\nfrom plotly.offline import init_notebook_mode, plot_mpl\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ninit_notebook_mode()\n\nfig = plt.figure()\nx = [10, 15, 20]\ny = [100, 150, 200]\nplt.plot(x, y, \"o\")\n\nplot_mpl(fig)\n```\n\nAn example inside of an IPython/Jupyter notebook:\n```\nfrom plotly.offline import init_notebook_mode, iplot_mpl\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ninit_notebook_mode()\n\nfig = plt.figure()\nx = [10, 15, 20]\ny = [100, 150, 200]\nplt.plot(x, y, \"o\")\n\niplot_mpl(fig)\n```\n\nAn example of enabling all matplotlib figures to be converted to\nPlotly figures inside of an IPython/Jupyter notebook:\n```\nfrom plotly.offline import init_notebook_mode, enable_mpl_offline\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ninit_notebook_mode()\nenable_mpl_offline()\n\nfig = plt.figure()\nx = [10, 15, 20, 25, 30]\ny = [100, 250, 200, 150, 300]\nplt.plot(x, y, \"o\")\nfig\n```\n\n## [1.9.4] - 2016-01-11\n### Added\n- Offline plotting now works outside of the IPython/Jupyter notebook. Here's an example:\n```\nfrom plotly.offline import plot\nfrom plotly.graph_objs import Scatter\n\nplot([Scatter(x=[1, 2, 3], y=[3, 1, 6])])\n```\n\nThis command works entirely locally. It writes to a local HTML file with the necessary [plotly.js](https://plot.ly/javascript) code to render the graph. Your browser will open the file after you make the call.\n\nThe call signature is very similar to `plotly.offline.iplot` and `plotly.plotly.plot` and `plotly.plotly.iplot`, so you can basically use these commands interchangeably.\n\nIf you want to publish your graphs to the web, use `plotly.plotly.plot`, as in:\n\n```\nimport plotly.plotly as py\nfrom plotly.graph_objs import Scatter\n\npy.plot([Scatter(x=[1, 2, 3], y=[5, 1, 6])])\n```\n\nThis will upload the graph to your online plotly account.\n\n## [1.9.3] - 2015-12-08\n### Added\n- Check for `no_proxy` when determining if the streaming request should pass through a proxy in the chunked_requests submodule. Example: `no_proxy='my_stream_url'` and `http_proxy=my.proxy.ip:1234`, then `my_stream_url` will not get proxied. Previously it would.\n\n## [1.9.2] - 2015-11-30\n**Bug Fix**: Previously, the \"Export to plot.ly\" link on\noffline charts would export your figures to the\npublic plotly cloud, even if your `config_file`\n(set with `plotly.tools.set_config_file` to the file\n`~/.plotly/.config`) set `plotly_domain` to a plotly enterprise\nURL like `https://plotly.acme.com`.\n\nThis is now fixed. Your graphs will be exported to your\n`plotly_domain` if it is set.\n\n## [1.9.1] - 2015-11-26\n### Added\n- The FigureFactory can now create annotated heatmaps with `.create_annotated_heatmap`. Check it out with:\n```\nimport plotly.tools as tls\nhelp(tls.FigureFactory.create_annotated_heatmap)\n```\n- The FigureFactory can now create tables with `.create_table`.\n```\nimport plotly.tools as tls\nhelp(tls.FigureFactory.create_table)\n```\n\n## [1.9.0] - 2015-11-15\n- Previously, using plotly offline required a paid license.\nNo more: `plotly.js` is now shipped inside this package to allow\nunlimited free use of plotly inside the ipython notebook environment.\nThe `plotly.js` library that is included in this package is free,\nopen source, and maintained independently on GitHub at\n[https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js).\n- The `plotly.js` bundle that is required for offline use is no longer downloaded\nand installed independently from this package: `plotly.offline.download_plotlyjs`\nis **deprecated**.\n- New versions of `plotly.js` will be tested and incorporated\n  into this package as new versioned pip releases;\n  `plotly.js` is not automatically kept in sync with this package.\n\n## [1.8.12] - 2015-11-02\n- *Big data* warning mentions `plotly.graph_objs.Scattergl` as possible solution.\n\n## [1.8.9] - 2015-10-11\n- If you're behind a proxy, you can make requests by setting the environmental variable HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY (http://docs.python-requests.org/en/v1.0.4/user/advanced/#proxies). This didn't work for streaming, but now it does.\n\n## [1.8.8] - 2015-10-05\n- Sometimes creating a graph with a private share-key doesn't work -\nthe graph is private, but not accessible with the share key.\nNow we check to see if it didn't work, and re-try a few times until\nit does.\n\n## [1.8.7] - 2015-10-01\n### Added\n- The FigureFactory can now create dendrogram plots with `.create_dendrogram`.\n\n## [1.8.6] - 2015-09-28\n### Fixed\n- Saving \"world_readable\" to your config file via `plotly.tools.set_config` actually works.\n\n### Added\n- You can also save `auto_open` and `sharing` to the config file so that you can forget these\n  keyword argument in `py.iplot` and `py.plot`.\n\n## [1.8.5] - 2015-09-29\n### Fixed\n- Fixed validation errors (validate=False workaround no longer required)\n\n### Added\n- Auto-sync API request on import to get the latest schema from Plotly\n- `.`-access for nested attributes in plotly graph objects\n- General `.help()` method for plotly graph objects\n- Specific attribute `.help(<attribute>)` also included\n\n### Removed\n- No more *is streamable*, streaming validation.\n\n## [1.8.3] - 2015-08-14\n### Fixed\n- Fixed typos in `plot` and `iplot` documentations\n\n## [1.8.2] - 2015-08-11\n### Added\n- CHANGELOG\n- `sharing` keyword argument for `plotly.plotly.plot` and `plotly.plotly.iplot` with options `'public' | 'private' | 'secret'` to control the privacy of the charts. Depreciates `world_readable`\n\n### Changed\n- If the response from `plot` or `iplot` contains an error message, raise an exception\n\n### Removed\n- `height` and `width` are no longer accepted in `iplot`. Just stick them into your figure's layout instead, it'll be more consistent when you view it outside of the IPython notebook environment. So, instead of this:\n\n  ```\n  py.iplot([{'x': [1, 2, 3], 'y': [3, 1, 5]}], height=800)\n  ```\n\n  do this:\n\n  ```\n  py.iplot({\n    'data': [{'x': [1, 2, 3], 'y': [3, 1, 5]}],\n    'layout': {'height': 800}\n  })\n  ```\n\n### Fixed\n- The height of the graph in `iplot` respects the figure's height in layout\n"

          "content": "# Contributing\n\nThank you for your interest in contributing to plotly.py! We are actively looking for\ndiverse contributors, with diverse background and skills.\n\nThis guide starts with a general description of the different ways to contribute\nto plotly.py, then we explain some technical aspects of preparing your\ncontribution.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nPlease check out the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Don't skip it,\nbut the general idea is to be nice.\n\n## What are the different ways to contribute?\n\nThere are many ways to contribute to plotly.py. To contribute effectively, it is important to first gain an understanding of the structure of the code and of the repository.\n\n- [the `plotly.graph_objects` module](https://plotly.com/python/graph-objects/) (usually imported as `go`)\n  is [generated from the Plotly.js schema](https://plotly.com/python/figure-structure/),\n  so changes to be made in this package need to be\n  [contributed to Plotly.js](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js) or to the `codegen` system\n  in `packages/python/plotly/codegen`. Most of the codegen code concerns the generation of docstrings from\n  the schema JSON in Plotly.js. Traces and\n  Layout classes have a direct correspondence with their Javascript\n  counterpart. Higher-level methods that work on figures regardless of the current schema (e.g., `BaseFigure.for_each_trace`) are defined in `packages/python/plotly/plotly/basedatatypes.py`. Additional helper methods are defined there for the `Figure` object, such as\n  `update_layout`, `add_trace`, etc.\n\n- [the `plotly.express` module](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/) (usually imported as `px`) is a high-level\n  functional API that uses `graph_objects` under the hood. Its code is in `packages/python/plotly/plotly/express`.\n  Plotly Express functions\n  are designed to be highly consistent with each other, and to do *as little computation\n  in Python as possible*, generally concerning themselves with formatting data and creating\n  figures out of `plotly.graph_objects` instances. Most\n  functions of `plotly.express` call the same internal `_make_figure` function\n  in `_core.py`. More generally, the internals of `px` consist of general\n  functions taking care of building the figure (defining subplots, traces\n  or frames, for example), with special cases for different traces handled\n  within these functions. There is also subsequent code reuse for `px`\n  docstrings, in particular for documenting parameters.\n\n- [the `plotly.figure_factory` module](https://plotly.com/python/figure-factories/) (usually imported as `ff`)\n  provides Python \"recipes\" for building\n  advanced visualizations with involved computation done in Python, such as\n  Hexbin maps, ternary contour plots, etc.\n  Figure factories are one of the easiest entry points into contributing to plotly.py, since\n  they consist of Python-only code, with standalone, well-separated functions.\n  However, please note that some of the figure factories become less relevant\n  as we are introducing more features into `plotly.express`. Some issues in the\n  tracker are labeled \"figure_factory\" and can be good issues to work on. More\n  instructions on figure factories are found\n  [here](packages/python/plotly/plotly/figure_factory/README.md).\n\n- other pure-Python submodules are: `plotly.io` (low-level interface for\n  displaying, reading and writing figures), `plotly.subplots` (helper function\n  for layout of multi-plot figures)\n\n- tests are found in `packages/python/plotly/plotly/tests`. Different\n  directories correspond to different test jobs (with different dependency sets)\n  run in continuous integration. More is explained about tests\n  in the following \"Technical aspects\" section.\n\n- the **documentation** is part of this repository. Its structure and some\n  explanations are described [here](doc/README.md). The documentation, in\n  particular example-based tutorials, is a great place to start contributing.\n  The contribution process is also more lightweight, since you can modify\n  tutorial notebooks without setting up an environment, etc.\n  We maintain a wishlist of examples to add on\n  https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/1965. If you have writing skills,\n  the wording of existing examples can also be improved in places.\n\nContributing code or documentation is not the only way to contribute! You can\nalso contribute to the project by\n\n- reporting bugs (see below).\n\n- submitting feature requests (maybe we'll convince you to contribute it as a\n  pull request!).\n\n- helping other users on the [community forum](https://community.plot.ly/).\n  Join the list of [nice people](https://community.plot.ly/u) helping other\n  plotly users :-).\n\nWe also recommend reading the great\n[how to contribute to open source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)\nguide.\n\n## Have a Bug Report?\n\nOpen an issue! Go to https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues. It's possible that your issue was already addressed. If it wasn't, open it. We also accept pull requests; take a look at the steps below for instructions on how to do this.\n\n## Have Questions about Plotly?\n\nCheck out our Community Forum: https://community.plot.ly/.\n\n## Want to improve the plotly documentation?\n\nThank you! Instructions on how to contribute to the documentation are given [here](doc/README.md). Please also read the next section if you need to setup a development environment.\n\n## How to contribute - Technical Aspects\n\nBelow we explain the technical aspects of contributing. It is not strictly necessary to follow all points (for example, you will not write tests when writing documentation, most of the time), but we want to make sure that you know how to deal with most cases.\n\nNote that if you are modifying a single documentation page, you can do it\ndirectly on Github by clicking on the \"Edit this page on GitHub\" link, without\ncloning the repository.\n\n## Setup a Development Environment\n\n### Fork, Clone, Setup Your Version of the Plotly Python API\n\nFirst, you'll need to *get* our project. This is the appropriate *clone* command (if you're unfamiliar with this process, https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo):\n\n**DO THIS (in the directory where you want the repo to live)**\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/your_github_username/plotly.py.git\ncd plotly.py\n```\n\nNote: if you're just getting started with git, there exist great resources to\nlearn and become confident about git, like http://try.github.io/.\n\n### Create a virtual environment for plotly development\n\nYou can use either [conda][conda-env] or [virtualenv][virtualenv] to create a virtual environment for plotly development, e.g.:\n\n```bash\nconda create -n plotly-dev python=3.11\nconda activate plotly-dev\n```\n\nAs of May 2024 our dependencies have been tested against Python versions 3.8 to 3.11.\nWe will support Python 3.12 and higher versions soon.\n\n[conda-env]: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands\n[virtualenv]: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/\n\n### Install development requirements (Non-Windows)\n```bash\n(plotly_dev) $ pip install -r packages/python/plotly/requires-optional.txt\n ```\n### Install development requirements (Windows + Conda)\nBecause Windows requires Visual Studio libraries to compile some of the optional dependencies, follow these steps to\ncomplete installation and avoid gdal-config errors.\n\n```bash\n(plotly_dev) $ conda install fiona\n(plotly_dev) $ pip install -r packages/python/plotly/requires-optional.txt\n```\n\n### Editable install of plotly packages\n```bash\n(plotly_dev) $ pip install -e packages/python/plotly/\n(plotly_dev) $ pip install -e packages/python/chart-studio/\n(plotly_dev) $ pip install -e packages/python/plotly-geo/\n```\n\n**Note**: To test `go.FigureWidget` locally, you'll need to generate the javascript bundle as follows:\n```\ncd packages/python/plotly/js\nnpm install && npm run build\n```\n\nRunning `pip install -e` will ensure that the installed packages links to your local development\ndirectory, meaning that all changes you make reflect directly in your\nenvironment (don't forget to restart the Jupyter kernel though!). For more\ninformation see the\n[`setuptools`](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#development-mode)\nand\n[`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#install-editable)\ndocumentation on _development mode_.\n\n### Configure black code formatting\n\nThis repo uses the [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) code formatter,\nand the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) library to manage a git commit hook to\nrun Black prior to each commit.  Both pre-commit and black are included in the\n`packages/python/plotly/requires-optional.txt` file, so you should have them\ninstalled already if you've been following along.\n\nTo enable the Black formatting git hook, run the following from within your virtual\nenvironment.\n\n```bash\n(plotly_dev) $ pre-commit install\n```\n\nNow, whenever you perform a commit, the Black formatter will run.  If the formatter\nmakes no changes, then the commit will proceed.  But if the formatter does make changes,\nthen the commit will abort.  To proceed, stage the files that the formatter\nmodified and commit again.\n\nIf you don't want to use `pre-commit`, then you can run black manually prior to making\na PR as follows.\n\n```bash\n(plotly_dev) $ black .\n```\n\n### Making a Development Branch\n\nThird, *don't* work in the `master` branch. As soon as you get your master branch ready, run:\n\n**DO THIS (but change the branch name)**\n```bash\ngit checkout -b my-dev-branch\n```\n\n... where you should give your branch a more descriptive name than `my-dev-branch`\n\n### Pull Request When Ready\n\nOnce you've made your changes (and hopefully written some tests, see below for more about testing...),\nmake that pull request!\n\n\n## Update to a new version of Plotly.js\nFirst update the version of the `plotly.js` dependency in `packages/python/plotly/js/package.json`.\n\nThen run the `updateplotlyjs` command with:\n\n```bash\n$ cd packages/python/plotly\n$ python setup.py updateplotlyjs\n```\n\nThis will download new versions of `plot-schema.json` and `plotly.min.js` from\nthe `plotly/plotly.js` GitHub repository (and place them in\n`plotly/package_data`). It will then regenerate all of the `graph_objs`\nclasses based on the new schema.\n\nFor dev branches, it is also possible to use `updateplotlyjsdev` in two configurations:\n\n### CircleCI Release\n\nIf your devbranch is part of the official plotly.js repository, you can use\n```bash\npython setup.py updateplotlyjsdev --devrepo reponame --devbranch branchname\n```\nto update to development versions of `plotly.js`. This will fetch the `plotly.js` in the CircleCI artifact of the branch `branchname` of the repo `reponame`. If `--devrepo` or `--devbranch` are omitted, `updateplotlyjsdev` defaults using `plotly/plotly.js` and `master` respectively.\n\n### Local Repository\n\nIf you have a local repository of `plotly.js` you'd like to try, you can run:\n\n```bash\n# In your plotly.js/ directory, prepare the package:\n\n$ npm run build\n$ npm pack\n$ mv plotly.js-*.tgz plotly.js.tgz\n\n# In your plotly.py/packages/python/plotly/ directory:\n$ python setup.py updateplotlyjsdev --local /path/to/your/plotly.js/\n```\n\n## Testing\n\nWe take advantage of two tools to run tests:\n\n* [`tox`](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which is both a virtualenv management and test tool.\n* [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/), a powerful framework for unit testing.\n\n### Running Tests with `pytest`\n\nSince our tests cover *all* the functionality, to prevent tons of errors from showing up and having to parse through a messy output, you'll need to install `requires-optional.txt` as explained above.\n\nAfter you've done that, go ahead and run the test suite!\n\n```bash\npytest  packages/python/plotly/plotly/tests/\n```\n\nOr for more *verbose* output:\n\n```bash\npytest -v  packages/python/plotly/plotly/tests/\n```\n\nEither of those will run *every* test we've written for the Python API. You can get more granular by running something like:\n\n```bash\npytest  packages/python/plotly/plotly/tests/test_core/\n```\n\n... or even more granular by running something like:\n\n```bash\npytest plotly/tests/test_plotly/test_plot.py\n```\n\nor for a specific test function\n\n```bash\npytest plotly/tests/test_plotly/test_plot.py::test_function\n```\n\n### Running tests with `tox`\n\nRunning tests with tox is much more powerful, but requires a bit more setup.\n\nYou'll need to export an environment variable for *each* tox environment you wish to test with. For example, if you want to test with `Python 3.9` and\n`Python 3.6`, but only care to check the `core` specs, you would need to ensure that the following variables are exported:\n\n```\nexport PLOTLY_TOX_PYTHON_39=<python binary>\nexport PLOTLY_TOX_PYTHON_36=<python binary>\n```\n\nWhere the `<python binary` is going to be specific to your development setup. As a more complete example, you might have this loaded in a `.bash_profile` (or equivalent shell loader):\n\n```bash\n############\n# tox envs #\n############\n\nexport PLOTLY_TOX_PYTHON_39=python3.9\nexport PLOTLY_TOX_PYTHON_36=python3.6\nexport TOXENV=py39-core,py36-core\n```\n\nWhere `TOXENV` is the environment list you want to use when invoking `tox` from the command line. Note that the `PLOTLY_TOX_*` pattern is used to pass in variables for use in the `tox.ini` file. Though this is a little setup, intensive, you'll get the following benefits:\n\n* `tox` will automatically manage a virtual env for each environment you want to test in.\n* You only have to run `tox` and know that the module is working in all included Python versions.\n\nFinally, `tox` allows you to pass in additional command line arguments that are formatted in (by us) in the `tox.ini` file, see `{posargs}`. This is setup to help with our configuration of [pytest markers](http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/example/markers.html), which are set up in `packages/python/plotly/pytest.ini`. To run only tests that are *not* tagged with `nodev`, you could use the following command:\n\n```bash\ntox -- -a '!nodev'\n```\n\nNote that anything after `--` is substituted in for `{posargs}` in the tox.ini. For completeness, because it's reasonably confusing, if you want to force a match for *multiple* `pytest` marker tags, you comma-separate the tags like so:\n\n```bash\ntox -- -a '!nodev','!matplotlib'\n```\n\n### Writing Tests\n\nYou're *strongly* encouraged to write tests that check your added functionality.\n\nWhen you write a new test anywhere under the `tests` directory, if your PR gets accepted, that test will run in a virtual machine to ensure that future changes don't break your contributions!\n\nTest accounts include: `PythonTest`, `PlotlyImageTest`, and  `PlotlyStageTest`.\n"

          "content": "# Migration to Version 5\nSee https://community.plotly.com/t/introducing-plotly-py-5-0-0-a-new-federated-jupyter-extension-icicle-charts-and-bar-chart-patterns/54039\n\n# Migration to Version 4\nSee https://plotly.com/python/v4-migration/\n\n# Migration to Version 3\nThere are many new and great features in plotly.py 3.0 including deeper Jupyter integration, deeper figure validation, improved performance, and more. This guide contains a summary of the breaking changes that you need to be aware of when migrating code from version 2 to version 3.\n\nFor a high level overview, read our [announcement post](https://medium.com/@plotlygraphs/introducing-plotly-py-3-0-0-7bb1333f69c6).\n\n## Simple FigureWidget Example\nWe now have seamless integration with the Jupyter widget ecosystem. We've introduced a new graph object called `go.FigureWidget` that acts like a regular plotly `go.Figure` that can be directly displayed in the notebook.\n\nSimple Example: Make a Scatter Plot\n```python\nimport plotly\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\n\nf = go.FigureWidget()\nf  # printing the widget will display it\n```\n\nThis means that `plotly.offline.iplot` and `plotly.offline.init_notebook_mode()` are no longer required (although still supported).\n\n## Tab Completion\nEntering ``f.add_<tab>`` displays add methods for all of the supported trace types. Try it!\n```\nf.add_\n```\n\nEntering `f.add_scatter(<tab>)` displays the names of all of the top-level properties for the scatter trace type\n\nEntering `f.add_scatter(<shift+tab>)` displays the signature pop-up. Expanding this pop-up reveals the method doc string which contains the descriptions of all of the top level properties. Let's finish add a scatter trace to `f`:\n\n```python\nf.add_scatter(x=[1,2,3], y=[3,4,2])\nf\n```\n\n![Simple Scatter](example_images/simple_scatter.png)\n\n## New Plotly Object Representation\nPlotly figures and graph objects have an updated `__repr__` method that displays objects in a pretty printed form that can be copied, pasted, and evaluated to recreate the object.\n\nEg. `print(f)` returns\n\n```\nFigureWidget({\n    'data': [{'type': 'scatter', 'uid': '07968b11-7b0a-11e8-ba67-c869cda04ed6', 'x': [1, 2, 3], 'y': [4, 3, 2]}],\n    'layout': {}\n})\n```\n\n## New add trace methods that handle subplots\nThe legacy `append_trace` method for adding traces to subplots has been deprecated in favor of the new `add_trace`, `add_traces`, and `add_*` methods.  Each of these new methods accepts optional row/column information that may be used to add traces to subplots for figures initialized by the `plotly.tools.make_subplots` function.\n\nLet's create a subplot then turn it into a FigureWidget to display in the notebook.\n\n```python\nimport plotly\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.tools as tls\n\nimport pandas as pd\ndataset = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/diabetes.csv')\n\nsubplot = tls.make_subplots(2, 2, print_grid=False)\nf2 = go.FigureWidget(subplot)\n\n# Use add_trace method with optional row/col parameters\nf2.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=dataset['Age'], y=dataset['Pregnancies'], mode='markers'), row=1, col=1)\n\n# Use add_traces with optional rows/cols parameters\nf2.add_traces([\n    go.Scatter(x=dataset['Age'], y=dataset['BMI'], mode='markers'),\n    go.Scatter(x=dataset['Age'], y=dataset['SkinThickness'], mode='markers')],\n    rows=[1, 2], cols=[2, 1]\n)\n\n# Use add_scatter with optional row/col parameters\nf2.add_scatter(x=dataset['Age'], y=dataset['BloodPressure'], mode='markers', row=2, col=2)\n\nf2.layout.title = 'Age and Diabetes Factors'\nf2\n```\n\n![Simple Subplots](example_images/subplot_methods.png)\n\n## Breaking Changes\n\n## Graph Objects Superclass\nGraph objects are no longer `dict` subclasses, though they still provide many `dict`-like magic methods.\n\n## Graph Objects Hierarchy\nAll graph objects are now placed in a package hierarchy that matches their position in the object hierarchy. For example, `go.Marker` is now accessible as `go.scatter.Marker` or `go.bar.Marker` or whatever trace it is nested within. By providing unique objects under the parent-trace namespace, we can provide better validation (the properties for a marker object within a scatter trace may be different than the properties of a marker object within a bar trace). Although deprecated, the previous objects are still supported, they just won’t provide the same level of validation as our new objects.\n\nFor example, the following approach to creating a `Marker` object for a `Scatter` trace is now deprecated.\n```\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\ngo.Scatter(\n    x=[0],\n    y=[0],\n    marker=go.Marker(\n        color='rgb(255,45,15)'\n    )\n)\n```\n\nInstead, use the `Marker` object in the `go.scatter` package.\n\n```\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\ngo.Scatter(\n    x=[0],\n    y=[0],\n    marker=go.scatter.Marker(\n        color='rgb(255,45,15)'\n    )\n)\n```\n\nYou can still use `dict` as well. The previous figure is equivalent to:\n\n```\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\ndict(\n    type='scatter',\n    x=[0],\n    y=[0],\n    marker=go.scatter.Marker(\n        color='rgb(255,45,15)'\n    )\n)\n```\n\nwhich is also equivalent to\n```\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\ndict(\n    type='scatter',\n    x=[0],\n    y=[0],\n    marker=dict(\n        color='rgb(255,45,15)'\n    )\n)\n```\n\n### Property Immutability\nIn order to support the automatic synchronization a `FigureWidget` object and the front-end view in a notebook, it is necessary for the `FigureWidget` to be aware of all changes to its properties. This is accomplished by presenting the individual properties to the user as immutable objects.  For example, the `layout.xaxis.range` property may be assigned using a list, but it will be returned as a tuple. Similarly, object arrays (`Figure.data`, `Layout.images`, `Parcoords.dimensions`, etc.) are now represented as tuples of graph objects, not lists.\n\n### Object Array Classes Deprecated\nSince graph object arrays are now represented as tuple of graph objects, the following object array classes are deprecated: `go.Data`, `go.Annotations`, and `go.Frames`. Instead, just use lists.\n\nThat is, previously we used:\n```\nlayout = go.Layout(\n    annotations=go.Annotations([\n        go.layout.Annotations(text='annotation')\n    ])\n)\n```\n\nNow, we should write:\n```\nlayout = go.Layout(\n    annotations=[\n        go.layout.Annotations(text='annotation')\n    ]\n)\n```\n\n### New Figure.data Assignment\nThere are new restriction on the assignment of traces to the `data` property of a figure.  The assigned value must be a list or a tuple of a subset of the traces already present in the figure. Assignment to `data` may be used to reorder and remove existing traces, but it may not currently be used to add new traces.  New traces must be added using the `add_trace`, `add_traces`, or `add_*` methods.\n\nFor example, suppose a figure, `fig`, has 3 traces. The following command is valid and it will move the third trace to be the first, the first trace to be the second, and it will remove the second trace.\n\n```\nfig.data = [fig.data[2], fig.data[0]]\n```\n\nHowever this is not valid:\n```\nfig.data = [fig.data[0], go.Scatter(y=[2, 3, 1])]\n```\n\nIt's not valid because it's introducing a new trace during assignment. This trace would need to be added using `add_trace` instead.\n\n### Data array properties may not be specified as scalars\nFor example, the following is now invalid:\n```\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\ngo.Bar(x=1)\n```\n\nThis should be replaced by:\n```\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\ngo.Bar(x=[1])\n```\n\n### Removal of undocumented methods and properties\n - Several undocumented `Figure` methods have been removed. These include: `.to_string`, `.strip_style`, `.get_data`, `.validate` and `.to_dataframe`.\n\n - Graph objects no longer support the undocumented `_raise` parameter. They are always validated and always raise an exception on validation failures. It is still possible to pass a dict to `plot`/`iplot` with `validate=False` to bypass validation.\n"

In addition, there are various changelogs, github releases and forum announcements to do :)\n\n## Release process - `plotly` package and extensions\n\nThis is the release process for releasing `plotly.py` version `X.Y.Z`.\n\n### Finalize changelog\n\nReview the contents of `packages/python/plotly/CHANGELOG.md`. We try to follow\nthe [keepachangelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) guidelines.\nMake sure the changelog includes the version being published at the top, along\nwith the expected publication date.\n\nUse the `Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`, `Fixed`, and `Security`\nlabels for all changes to plotly.py.  If the version of plotly.js has\nbeen updated, include this as the first `Updated` entry. Call out any\nnotable changes as sub-bullets (new trace types in particular), and provide\na link to the plotly.js CHANGELOG.\n\n### Finalize versions\n\n**Create a branch `git checkout -b release-X.Y.Z` *from the tip of `origin/master`*.**\n\nManually update the versions to `X.Y.Z` in the files specified below.\n\n - `CHANGELOG.md`\n   + update the release date\n - `README.md`\n   + this must be done at this point because the README gets baked into PyPI\n - `packages/python/plotly/plotly/_widget_version.py`:\n   + Update `__frontend_version__` to `^X.Y.Z` (Note the `^` prefix)\n - `packages/python/plotly/js/package.json`\n   + Update `\"version\"` to `X.Y.Z`\n - `packages/python/plotly/js/package-lock.json`\n   + Update `\"version\"` to `X.Y.Z` in two places (to avoid dirty repo after rebuild)\n - Commit your changes on the branch:\n   + `git commit -a -m \"version changes for vX.Y.Z\"`\n\n ### Triggering (and Retriggering) the build\n\n - Commit and add this specific tag which `versioneer` will pick up, and push to Github so that CI will build the release artifacts. This is an atomic push so that CI will read the tag on the commit:\n   + `git tag vX.Y.Z`\n   + `git push --atomic origin release-X.Y.Z vX.Y.Z`\n - Create a Github pull request from `release-X.Y.Z` to `master` and wait for CI to be green\n - *If something goes wrong below*, you'll need to trigger the build process again after a fix. You'll need to commit your changes in the release branch, move the tag and atomically force push:\n   + `git commit ....`\n   + `git tag -f vX.Y.Z`\n   + `git push --force --atomic origin release-X.Y.Z vX.Y.Z`\n\n### Download and QA CI Artifacts\n\nThe `full_build` job in the `release_build` workflow in CircleCI produces a tarball of artifacts `output.tgz` which you should download and decompress, which will give you a directory called `output`. The filenames contained within will contain version numbers.\n\n**Note: if any of the version numbers are not simply `X.Y.Z` but include some kind of git hash, then this is a dirty build and you'll need to clean up whatever is dirtying the tree and follow the instructions above to trigger the build again.** (That said, you can do QA on dirty builds, you just can't publish them.)\n\nTo locally install the PyPI dist, make sure you have an environment with JupyterLab installed (maybe one created with `conda create -n condatest python=3.10 jupyter anywidget pandas`):\n\n- `tar xzf output.tgz`\n- `pip uninstall plotly`\n- `conda uninstall plotly` (just in case!)\n- `pip install path/to/output/dist/plotly-X.Y.X-py3-none-any.whl`\n\nTo locally install the Conda dist (generally do this in a different, clean environment from the one above!):\n\n- `conda uninstall plotly`\n- `pip uninstall plotly` (just in case!)\n- `conda install path/to/output/plotly-X.Y.Z.tar.bz2`\n\nYou'll want to check, in both Lab and Notebook, **in a brand new notebook in each** so that there is no caching of previous results, that `go.Figure()` and `go.FigureWidget()` work without error.\n\nIf something is broken, you'll need to fix it and trigger the build again (see above section).\n\n### Publishing\n\nOnce you're satisfied that things render in Lab and Notebook in Widget and regular mode,\nyou can publish the artifacts. **You will need special credentials from Plotly leadership to do this.**.\n\n\nPublishing to PyPI:\n```bash\n(plotly_dev) $ cd path/to/output/dist\n(plotly_dev) $ twine upload plotly-X.Y.Z*\n```\n\nPublishing to `plotly` conda channel (make sure you have run `conda install anaconda-client` to get the `anaconda` command):\n\n```\n(plotly_dev) $ cd path/to/output\n(plotly_dev) $ anaconda upload plotly-X.Y.Z.tar.bz2\n```\n\n\n### Merge the PR and make a Release\n\n1. Merge the pull request you created above into `master`\n2. Go to https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/releases and \"Draft a new release\"\n3. Enter the `vX.Y.Z` tag you created already above and make \"Release title\" the same string as the tag.\n4. Copy the changelog section for this version as the \"Describe this release\"\n\n### Update documentation site\n\n1. Search for the previous version string in the docs and replace it with the new version string, including but not necessarily limited to the following files:\n    - `doc/python/getting-started.md`\n    - `doc/apidoc/conf.py`\n    - `doc/requirements.txt`\n    - `binder/requirements.txt`\n2. `doc-prod` should already have been merged on a regular basis into `master`, but\nstart by doing it first if not. Then merge `master` into `doc-prod` to deploy the doc related\nto features in the release.\n3. in a clone of the [`graphing-library-docs` repo](https://github.com/plotly/graphing-library-docs):\n    1. bump the version of Plotly.py in  `_data/pyversion.json`\n    2. bump the version of Plotly.js with `cd _data && python get_plotschema.py <PLOTLY.JS VERSION>` fixing any errors that come up.\n      - If Plotly.js contains any new traces or trace or layout attributes, you'll get a warning `“missing key in attributes: <attribute-name>`. To resolve, add the attribute to the relevant section in `/_data/orderings.json` in the position you want it to appear in the reference docs.\n    3. rebuild the Algolia `schema` index with `ALGOLIA_API_KEY=<key> make update_ref_search`\n    4. Rebuild the Algolia `python` index with `ALGOLIA_API_KEY=<key> make update_python_search`\n    5. Commit and push the changes to `master` in that repo\n\n### Notify Stakeholders\n\n* Post an announcement to the Plotly Python forum, with links to the README installation instructions and to the CHANGELOG.\n* Update the previous announcement to point to this one\n* Update the Github Release entry and CHANGELOG entry to have the nice title and a link to the announcement\n* Follow up on issues resolved in this release or forum posts with better answers as of this release\n\n## Release *Candidate* process - `plotly` package and extensions\n\n(rough notes for a rough/ad hoc process!)\n\nIt's the same process as above except that the `X.Y.Z` version has a suffix and there are special instructions below for publishing an RC: note that the `npm` suffix is `-rc.1` and the PyPI suffix is `rc1`. We also don't update the docs with RC information and we inform a limited number of stakeholders.\n\nPyPI RC (no special flags, just the `rc1` suffix):\n\n```bash\n(plotly_dev) $ twine upload dist/plotly-X.Y.Zrc1*\n```\n\nThe `--tag next` part ensures that users won't install this version unless\nthey explicitly ask for the version or for the version with the `next` tag.\n\nConda RC:\n\n```\n$ anaconda upload --label test plotly-*.tar.bz2\n```\n\nThe `--label test` part ensures that users won't install this version unless\nthey explicitly ask for the version or for the version with the `next` tag.\n\n\n## Release process - `plotly-geo` package\n\nThe `plotly-geo` package contains the shape file resources used by plotly.py.\nThese files are relatively large and change infrequently so it is useful\nto release them in a separate package.\n\n### Update version\n\nUpdate the version of the `plotly-geo` package in\n`packages/python/plotly-geo/setup.py`.\n\nThis version is not intended to match the version of plotly.py.\n\n### Update CHANGELOG\n\nAdd a new entry to the CHANGELOG at `packages/python/plotly-geo/CHANGELOG.md`\nand commit the changes.\n\n### Tag Release\n\nCreate a new tag for the release\n\n```bash\n(plotly_dev) $ git checkout master\n(plotly_dev) $ git stash\n(plotly_dev) $ git pull origin master\n(plotly_dev) $ git tag plotly-geo-vX.Y.Z\n(plotly_dev) $ git push origin plotly-geo-vX.Y.Z\n```\n\n### Publishing to PYPI\n\nPublish the final version to PyPI\n\n```bash\n(plotly_dev) $ cd packages/python/plotly-geo\n(plotly_dev) $ python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel\n(plotly_dev) $ twine upload dist/plotly-geo-X.Y.Z.tar.gz\n(plotly_dev) $ twine upload dist/plotly_geo-X.Y.Z-py3-none-any.whl\n```\n\n### Publish to plotly anaconda channel\n\nFrom `packages/python/plotly-geo`, build the conda package\n```bash\n(plotly_dev) $ conda build recipe/\n```\n\nThen upload to the plotly anaconda channel as described above\n\n## Release process - `chart-studio` package\n\nThe `chart-studio` package contains the utilities for interacting with\nChart Studio (both Cloud or On-Prem).\n\n### Update version\n\nUpdate the version of the `chart-studio` package in\n`packages/python/chart-studio/setup.py`.\n\nThis version is not intended to match the version of plotly.py.\n\n### Update CHANGELOG\n\nAdd a new entry to the CHANGELOG at `packages/python/chart-studio/CHANGELOG.md`\nand commit the changes.\n\n### Tag Release\n\nCreate a new tag for the release\n\n```bash\n(plotly_dev) $ git checkout master\n(plotly_dev) $ git stash\n(plotly_dev) $ git pull origin master\n(plotly_dev) $ git tag chart-studio-vX.Y.Z\n(plotly_dev) $ git push origin chart-studio-vX.Y.Z\n```\n\n### Publishing to PYPI\n\nPublish the final version to PyPI\n\n```bash\n(plotly_dev) $ cd packages/python/chart-studio\n(plotly_dev) $ python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel\n(plotly_dev) $ twine upload dist/chart-studio-X.Y.Z.tar.gz\n(plotly_dev) $ twine upload dist/chart_studio-X.Y.Z-py3-none-any.whl\n```\n\n### Publish to plotly anaconda channel\n\nFrom `packages/python/plotly-geo`, build the conda package\n```bash\n(plotly_dev) $ conda build recipe/\n```\n\nThen upload to the plotly anaconda channel as described above.\n"
