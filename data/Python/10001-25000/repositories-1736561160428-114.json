          "content": "# General contributions\n\nThanks for your interest in helping improve Taipy! Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly\nappreciated! Every little help and credit will always be given.\n\nThere are multiple ways to contribute to Taipy: code, but also reporting bugs, creating feature\nrequests, helping other users in our forums, [stack**overflow**](https://stackoverflow.com/), etc.\n\nFor questions, please get in touch on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/SJyz2VJGxV) or on GitHub\nwith a discussion or an issue.\n\n## Project organisation\n\nTaipy is organised in two main repositories:\n\n- [taipy](https://github.com/Avaiga/taipy) is the main repository that contains the code of Taipy\n    packages.\n- [taipy-doc](https://github.com/Avaiga/taipy-doc) is the documentation repository.\n\n## Never contributed to an open source project before ?\n\nHave a look at this\n[GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects).\n\n## Report bugs\n\nReporting bugs is through [GitHub issues](https://github.com/Avaiga/taipy/issues).\n\nPlease report relevant information and preferably code that exhibits the problem. We provide\ntemplates to help you describe the issue.\n\nThe Taipy team will analyze and try to reproduce the bug to provide feedback. If confirmed,\nwe will add a priority to the issue and add it in our backlog. Feel free to propose a pull\nrequest to fix it.\n\n## Issue reporting, feedback, proposal, design or any other comment\n\nAny feedback or proposal is greatly appreciated! Do not hesitate to create an issue with the\nappropriate template on [GitHub](https://github.com/Avaiga/taipy/issues).\n\nThe Taipy team will analyse your issue and return to you as soon as possible.\n\n## Improve Documentation\n\nDo not hesitate to create an issue or pull request directly on the\n[taipy-doc repository](https://github.com/Avaiga/taipy-doc).\n\n# Code contributions\n\n## Code organization\n\nThe Taipy source code is located in the [taipy](https://github.com/Avaiga/taipy)\nrepository, in the `taipy` directory.\n\nPackages sources are organized in subdirectories from there:\n\n- `taipy-common`\n- `taipy-core`\n- `taipy-gui`\n- `taipy-rest`\n- `taipy-templates`\n\n## Process and workflow\n\n### Issue assignment\nThe Taipy team manages its backlog in private. Each issue that is or is going to be engaged by the\nTaipy team is attached to the \"🔒 Staff only\" label or has already been assigned to a Taipy team\nmember. Please, do not work on it, the Taipy team is on it.\n\nAll other issues are sorted by labels and are available for a contribution. If you are new to the\nproject, you can start with the \"good first issue\" or \"🆘 Help wanted\" label. You can also start\nwith issues with higher priority, like \"Critical\" or \"High\". The higher the priority, the more\nvalue it will bring to Taipy.\n\nIf you want to work on an issue, please add a comment and wait to be assigned to the issue to\ninform the community that you are working on it. Then, follow the steps below:\n\n### Contribution workflow\n\n1. Make your [own fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) of the repository\n   targeted by the issue. Clone it on your local machine, then go inside the directory.\n\n2. We are working with [Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) for our virtualenv.\n   Create a local env and install development package by running `$ pipenv install --dev`, then\n   run tests with `$ pipenv run pytest` to verify your setup.\n\n3. For convention help, we provide a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/hooks.html) file.\n   This tool will run before each commit and will automatically reformat code or raise warnings\n   and errors based on the code format or Python typing. You can install and set it up by doing:\n   ```bash\n   $ pipenv install pre-commit\n   $ pipenv run python -m pre-commit install\n   ```\n\n4. Create a [pull request from your fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).<br/>\n   Keep your pull request as __draft__ until your work is finished.\n   Do not hesitate to add a comment for help or questions.\n   Before you submit a pull request for review from your forked repo, check that it meets these\n   guidelines:\n     - The code and the branch name follow the\n         [Taipy coding style](#coding-style-and-best-practices).\n     - Include tests.\n     - Code is [rebased](http://stackoverflow.com/a/7244456/1110993).\n     - License is present.\n     - pre-commit works - without mypy errors.\n     - Taipy tests are passing.\n\n5. The Taipy team will have a look at your Pull Request and will give feedback. If every\n    requirement is valid, your work will be added in the next release, congratulations!\n\n### Issues or Pull requests inactivity\n\n- If your PR is not created or there is no other activity within 14 days of being assigned to\n    the issue, a warning message will appear on the issue, and the issue will be marked as\n    \"🥶Waiting for contributor\".\n- If your issue is marked as \"🥶Waiting for contributor\", you will be unassigned after 14\n    days of inactivity.\n- Similarly, if there is no activity within 14 days of your PR, the PR will be marked as\n    \"🥶Waiting for contributor\".\n- If your PR is marked as \"🥶Waiting for contributor\", it will be closed after 14 days of\n    inactivity.\n\nWe do this in order to keep our backlog moving quickly. Please don't take it personally if your\nissue or PR gets closed because of this 14-day inactivity time limit. You can always reopen the\nissue or PR if you're still interested in working on it.\n\n## Coding style and best practices\n\n### Python\n\nTaipy's repositories follow the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and\n[PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) coding convention. Gui variables need to be `snake_case` to be correctly converted into the `camelCase`, used for typescript variables.\n\n### TypeScript\n\nTaipy's repositories use the [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and\n[TypeScript ESLint](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint) plugin to ensure a common set of rules.\n\n### Git branches\n\nAll new development happens in the `develop` branch. All pull requests should target that\nbranch. We are following a strict branch naming convention based on the pattern:\n`<type>/#<issueId>[IssueSummary]`.\n\nWhere:\n\n- `<type>` would be one of:\n    - feature: new feature implementation, or improvement of a feature.\n    - bug: bug fix.\n    - review: change provoked by review comment not immediately taken care of.\n    - refactor: refactor of a piece of code.\n    - doc: doc changes (complement or typo fixes…).\n    - build: in relation with the build process.\n- `<issueId>` is the processed issue identifier. The advantage of explicitly indicating the issue\n    number is that inGitHub, a pull request page shows a direct link to the issue description.\n- `[IssueSummary]` is a short summary of the issue topic, not including spaces, using Camel case\n    or lower-case, dash-separated words. This summary, with its dash (‘-’) symbol prefix, is\n    optional.\n\n## Dependency management\n\nTaipy comes with multiple optional packages. You can find the list directly in the product or\nTaipy's packages. The back-end Pipfile does not install optional packages by default due to\n`pyodbc` requiring a driver's manual installation. This is not the behaviour for the front-end\nthat installs all optional packages through its Pipfile.\n\nIf you are a contributor on Taipy, be careful with dependencies, do not forget to install or\nuninstall depending on your issue.\n\nIf you need to add a new dependency to Taipy, do not forget to add it in the `Pipfile` and the\n`setup.py`. Keep in mind that dependency is a vector of attack. The Taipy team limits the usage\nof external dependencies at the minimum.\n\n## Installing the development kit\n\nIf you need the source code for Taipy on your system to see how things are done or maybe\ncontribute to the improvement of the packages, you can set your environment up by following\nthe steps below.\n\n### Prerequisites\nBefore installing the Taipy development kit, ensure you have\n[Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/) (**version 3.9 or later**),\n[pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installation/), and\n[git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) installed on your system.\n\n??? note \"On Mac OS M1 pro\"\n\n    If you are using a Mac OS M1 pro, you may need to install the `libmagic` library before.\n    Please run the commands below:\n    ```bash\n    brew install libmagic\n    pip install python-libmagic\n    ```\n\n### Cloning the repository\n\nFirst, clone the Taipy repository from GitHub using the following command:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/Avaiga/taipy.git\n```\n\nThis creates the 'taipy' directory holding all the package's source code.\n\n### Building the JavaScript bundles\n\nTaipy (and Taipy GUI) includes client-side code for web applications, written in\n[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and uses [React](https://reactjs.org/).\nThe code is packaged into JavaScript bundles that are sent to browsers when accessing\nTaipy applications with a graphical interface.\n\nThere are two main JavaScript bundles to build:\n- Taipy GUI: Contains the web application, the pages and all standard visual elements.\n- Taipy: Contains specific visual elements for Taipy back-end functionalities\n    (Scenario Management).\n\n**Prerequisites**: To build the JavaScript bundles, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)\nversion 18 or higher installed. Node.js includes the\n[`npm` package manager](https://www.npmjs.com/).\n\nThe build process is explained in the\n[Taipy GUI front-end](https://github.com/Avaiga/taipy/blob/develop/frontend/taipy-gui/README.md)\nand\n[Taipy front-end](https://github.com/Avaiga/taipy/blob/develop/frontend/taipy/README.md) README\nfiles. Build the Taipy GUI bundle first, as the Taipy front-end depends on it.\n\n**Build instructions:** Run the following commands from the root directory of the repository:\n\n```bash\n# Build the Taipy GUI bundle\ncd frontend/taipy-gui\ncd dom\nnpm i\ncd ..\nnpm i\nnpm run build\n#\n# Build the Taipy front-end bundle\ncd ../taipy # Current directory is [taipy-dir]/frontend/taipy\nnpm i\nnpm run build\n```\n\nThese commands will create the `taipy/gui/webapp` and `taipy/gui_core/lib` directories in the root\nfolder of the taipy repository.\n\n### Debugging the JavaScript bundles\n\nIf you plan to modify the front-end code and need to debug the TypeScript code, you must use the\nfollowing instead of the *standard* build option:\n```bash\nnpm run build:dev\n```\n\nThis will preserve the debugging symbols, and you will be able to navigate in the TypeScript code\nfrom your debugger.\n\n#### 📝A note on \"Web application location\"\nWhen you are developing front-end code for the Taipy GUI package, it may be cumbersome to have\nto install the package over and over when you know that all that has changed is the JavaScript\nbundle that makes the Taipy web app.\n\nBy default, the Taipy GUI application searches for the front-end code in the\n`[taipy-gui-package-dir]/taipy/gui/webapp` directory.\nYou can, however, set the environment variable `TAIPY_GUI_WEBAPP_PATH` to the location of your\nchoice, and Taipy GUI will look for the web app in that directory.\nIf you set this variable to the location where you build the web app repeatedly, you will no\nlonger have to reinstall Taipy GUI before you try your code again.\nIn python, you can handle this with:\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ[\"TAIPY_GUI_WEBAPP_PATH\"] = os.path.normpath( \"/path/to/your/taipy/taipy/gui/webapp\" )\n```\nor in bash with:\n```bash\nexport TAIPY_GUI_WEBAPP_PATH=\"/path/to/your/taipy/taipy/gui/webapp\"\n```\n\n### Running the tests\n\nThe Taipy package includes a test suite to ensure the package's functionality is correct.\nThe tests are written using the [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) framework.\nThey are located in the `tests` directory of the package.\n\nTo run the tests, you need to install the required development packages. We recommend using\n[Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) to create a virtual environment and install the\ndevelopment packages.\n\n```bash\npip install pipenv\npipenv install --dev\n```\n\nThen you can run the tests with the following command:\n\n```bash\npipenv run pytest\n```\n"

Our\n[Getting Started Guide](https://docs.taipy.io/en/develop/tutorials/getting_started/)\nis the perfect place to begin your journey and unlock the full potential of Taipy.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## 🔌 Scenario & Data Management\n\nLet's create a simple scenario in Taipy that allows you to filter movie data based on your chosen genre.<br />\nThis scenario is designed as a straightforward pipeline.<br />\nEvery time you change your genre selection, the scenario runs to process your request.<br />\nIt then displays the top seven most popular movies in that genre.\n\n<br />\n\n> ⚠️ Keep in mind that in this example, we're using a very basic pipeline that consists of just one task. However,<br />\n> Taipy is capable of handling much more complex pipelines 🚀\n\n<br />\n\nBelow is our filter function. This is a typical Python function, and it's the only task used in this scenario.\n\n```python\ndef filter_genre(initial_dataset: pd.DataFrame, selected_genre):\n    filtered_dataset = initial_dataset[initial_dataset['genres'].str.contains(selected_genre)]\n    filtered_data = filtered_dataset.nlargest(7, 'Popularity %')\n    return filtered_data\n```\n\nThis is the execution graph of the scenario we are implementing:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Avaiga/taipy/raw/develop/readme_img/readme_exec_graph.png\" width=\"600\" align=\"center\" />\n</p>\n\n### Taipy Studio\n\nYou can use the Taipy Studio extension in Visual Studio Code to configure your scenario with no code.<br />\nYour configuration is automatically saved as a TOML file.<br />\nCheck out the Taipy Studio [Documentation](https://docs.taipy.io/en/latest/userman/ecosystem/studio/).\n\nFor more advanced use cases or if you prefer coding your configurations instead of using Taipy Studio,<br />\ncheck out the movie genre demo scenario creation with this [Demo](https://docs.taipy.io/en/latest/gallery/articles/movie_genre_selector/).\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Avaiga/taipy/raw/develop/readme_img/readme_demo_studio.gif\" alt=\"Back-End Animation\"  width=\"80%\" align=\"center\" />\n</p>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## User Interface Generation and Scenario & Data Management\n\nThis simple Taipy application demonstrates how to create a basic film recommendation system using Taipy.<br />\nThe application filters a dataset of films based on the user's selected genre and displays the top seven films in that genre by popularity.\nHere is the full code for both the front end and back end of the application.\n\n<p align=\"center\" width=80% >\n\n```python\nimport taipy as tp\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom taipy import Config, Scope, Gui\n\n# Defining the helper functions\n\n# Callback definition - submits scenario with genre selection\ndef on_genre_selected(state):\n    scenario.selected_genre_node.write(state.selected_genre)\n    tp.submit(scenario)\n    state.df = scenario.filtered_data.read()\n\n## Set initial value to Action\ndef on_init(state):\n    on_genre_selected(state)\n\n# Filtering function - task\ndef filter_genre(initial_dataset: pd.DataFrame, selected_genre):\n    filtered_dataset = initial_dataset[initial_dataset[\"genres\"].str.contains(selected_genre)]\n    filtered_data = filtered_dataset.nlargest(7, \"Popularity %\")\n    return filtered_data\n\n# The main script\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Taipy Scenario & Data Management\n\n    # Load the configuration made with Taipy Studio\n    Config.load(\"config.toml\")\n    scenario_cfg = Config.scenarios[\"scenario\"]\n\n    # Start Taipy Orchestrator\n    tp.Orchestrator().run()\n\n    # Create a scenario\n    scenario = tp.create_scenario(scenario_cfg)\n\n    # Taipy User Interface\n    # Let's add a GUI to our Scenario Management for a full application\n\n    # Get the list of genres\n    genres = [\n        \"Action\", \"Adventure\", \"Animation\", \"Children\", \"Comedy\", \"Fantasy\", \"IMAX\",\n        \"Romance\", \"Sci-Fi\", \"Western\", \"Crime\", \"Mystery\", \"Drama\", \"Horror\", \"Thriller\", \"Film-Noir\", \"War\", \"Musical\", \"Documentary\"\n    ]\n\n    # Initialization of variables\n    df = pd.DataFrame(columns=[\"Title\", \"Popularity %\"])\n    selected_genre = \"Action\"\n\n    # User interface definition\n    my_page = \"\"\"\n# Film Recommendation\n\n## Choose Your Favorite Genre\n<|{selected_genre}|selector|lov={genres}|on_change=on_genre_selected|dropdown|>\n\n## Here are the Top Seven Picks by Popularity\n<|{df}|chart|x=Title|y=Popularity %|type=bar|title=Film Popularity|>\n    \"\"\"\n\n    Gui(page=my_page).run()\n```\n</p>\n\nAnd the final result:\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"readme_img/readme_app.gif\"  width=\"70%\" align=\"center\" />\n</p>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## ⚒️ Contributing\n\nWant to help build Taipy?
