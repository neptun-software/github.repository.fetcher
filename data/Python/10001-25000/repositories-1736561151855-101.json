To achieve efficient inference and cost-effective training, DeepSeek-V3 adopts Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and DeepSeekMoE architectures, which were thoroughly validated in DeepSeek-V2. Furthermore, DeepSeek-V3 pioneers an auxiliary-loss-free strategy for load balancing and sets a multi-token prediction training objective for stronger performance. We pre-train DeepSeek-V3 on 14.8 trillion diverse and high-quality tokens, followed by Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning stages to fully harness its capabilities. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that DeepSeek-V3 outperforms other open-source models and achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models. Despite its excellent performance, DeepSeek-V3 requires only 2.788M H800 GPU hours for its full training. In addition, its training process is remarkably stable. Throughout the entire training process, we did not experience any irrecoverable loss spikes or perform any rollbacks."

          "content": "DEEPSEEK LICENSE AGREEMENT\n\nVersion 1.0, 23 October 2023\n\nCopyright (c) 2023 DeepSeek\n\nSection I: PREAMBLE \n\nLarge generative models are being widely adopted and used, and have the potential to transform the way individuals conceive and benefit from AI or ML technologies. \n\nNotwithstanding the current and potential benefits that these artifacts can bring to society at large, there are also concerns about potential misuses of them, either due to their technical limitations or ethical considerations. \n\nIn short, this license strives for both the open and responsible downstream use of the accompanying model. When it comes to the open character, we took inspiration from open source permissive licenses regarding the grant of IP rights. Referring to the downstream responsible use, we added use-based restrictions not permitting the use of the model in very specific scenarios, in order for the licensor to be able to enforce the license in case potential misuses of the Model may occur. At the same time, we strive to promote open and responsible research on generative models for content generation. \n\nEven though downstream derivative versions of the model could be released under different licensing terms, the latter will always have to include - at minimum - the same use-based restrictions as the ones in the original license (this license). We believe in the intersection between open and responsible AI development; thus, this agreement aims to strike a balance between both in order to enable responsible open-science in the field of AI. \n\nThis License governs the use of the model (and its derivatives) and is informed by the model card associated with the model. \n\nNOW THEREFORE, You and DeepSeek agree as follows: \n\n1. Definitions \n\"License\" means the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and Distribution as defined in this document. \n\"Data\" means a collection of information and/or content extracted from the dataset used with the Model, including to train, pretrain, or otherwise evaluate the Model. The Data is not licensed under this License.\n\"Output\" means the results of operating a Model as embodied in informational content resulting therefrom. \n\"Model\" means any accompanying machine-learning based assemblies (including checkpoints), consisting of learnt weights, parameters (including optimizer states), corresponding to the model architecture as embodied in the Complementary Material, that have been trained or tuned, in whole or in part on the Data, using the Complementary Material. \n\"Derivatives of the Model\" means all modifications to the Model, works based on the Model, or any other model which is created or initialized by transfer of patterns of the weights, parameters, activations or output of the Model, to the other model, in order to cause the other model to perform similarly to the Model, including - but not limited to - distillation methods entailing the use of intermediate data representations or methods based on the generation of synthetic data by the Model for training the other model. \n\"Complementary Material\" means the accompanying source code and scripts used to define, run, load, benchmark or evaluate the Model, and used to prepare data for training or evaluation, if any. This includes any accompanying documentation, tutorials, examples, etc, if any. \n\"Distribution\" means any transmission, reproduction, publication or other sharing of the Model or Derivatives of the Model to a third party, including providing the Model as a hosted service made available by electronic or other remote means - e.g. API-based or web access. \n\"DeepSeek\" (or \"we\") means Beijing DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence Fundamental Technology Research Co., Ltd., Hangzhou DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence Fundamental Technology Research Co., Ltd. and/or any of their affiliates.\n\"You\" (or \"Your\") means an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions granted by this License and/or making use of the Model for whichever purpose and in any field of use, including usage of the Model in an end-use application - e.g. chatbot, translator, etc. \n\"Third Parties\" means individuals or legal entities that are not under common control with DeepSeek or You. \n\nSection II: INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS \n\nBoth copyright and patent grants apply to the Model, Derivatives of the Model and Complementary Material. The Model and Derivatives of the Model are subject to additional terms as described in Section III. \n\n2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, DeepSeek hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Complementary Material, the Model, and Derivatives of the Model. \n\n3.

Introduction\n\nWe present DeepSeek-V3, a strong Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model with 671B total parameters with 37B activated for each token. \nTo achieve efficient inference and cost-effective training, DeepSeek-V3 adopts Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and DeepSeekMoE architectures, which were thoroughly validated in DeepSeek-V2. \nFurthermore, DeepSeek-V3 pioneers an auxiliary-loss-free strategy for load balancing and sets a multi-token prediction training objective for stronger performance. \nWe pre-train DeepSeek-V3 on 14.8 trillion diverse and high-quality tokens, followed by Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning stages to fully harness its capabilities. \nComprehensive evaluations reveal that DeepSeek-V3 outperforms other open-source models and achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models.\nDespite its excellent performance, DeepSeek-V3 requires only 2.788M H800 GPU hours for its full training.\nIn addition, its training process is remarkably stable. \nThroughout the entire training process, we did not experience any irrecoverable loss spikes or perform any rollbacks. \n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img width=\"80%\" src=\"figures/benchmark.png\">\n</p>\n\n## 2. Model Summary\n\n---\n\n**Architecture: Innovative Load Balancing Strategy and Training Objective**\n\n- On top of the efficient architecture of DeepSeek-V2, we pioneer an auxiliary-loss-free strategy for load balancing, which minimizes the performance degradation that arises from encouraging load balancing.\n-  We investigate a Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) objective and prove it beneficial to model performance. \n    It can also be used for speculative decoding for inference acceleration. \n\n---\n\n**Pre-Training: Towards Ultimate Training Efficiency**\n\n- We design an FP8 mixed precision training framework and, for the first time, validate the feasibility and effectiveness of FP8 training on an extremely large-scale model.  \n- Through co-design of algorithms, frameworks, and hardware, we overcome the communication bottleneck in cross-node MoE training, nearly achieving full computation-communication overlap.  \n  This significantly enhances our training efficiency and reduces the training costs, enabling us to further scale up the model size without additional overhead.  \n- At an economical cost of only 2.664M H800 GPU hours, we complete the pre-training of DeepSeek-V3 on 14.8T tokens, producing the currently strongest open-source base model. The subsequent training stages after pre-training require only 0.1M GPU hours.\n\n---\n\n**Post-Training: Knowledge Distillation from DeepSeek-R1**\n\n-   We introduce an innovative methodology to distill reasoning capabilities from the long-Chain-of-Thought (CoT) model, specifically from one of the DeepSeek R1 series models, into standard LLMs, particularly DeepSeek-V3. Our pipeline elegantly incorporates the verification and reflection patterns of R1 into DeepSeek-V3 and notably improves its reasoning performance. Meanwhile, we also maintain a control over the output style and length of DeepSeek-V3.\n\n---\n\n\n## 3.

          "content": "# DeepSeek-V3 Weight File Documentation\n\n## New Fields in `config.json`\n\n- **model_type**: Specifies the model type, which is updated to `deepseek_v3` in this release.\n- **num_nextn_predict_layers**: Indicates the number of Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) Modules. The open-sourced V3 weights include **1 MTP Module** .\n- **quantization_config**: Describes the configuration for FP8 quantization.\n\n---\n\n## Weight Structure Overview\n\nThe DeepSeek-V3 weight file consists of two main components: **Main Model Weights** and **MTP Modules**.\n\n### 1. Main Model Weights\n\n- **Composition**:\n  - Input/output embedding layers and a complete set of 61 Transformer hidden layers.\n- **Parameter Count**:\n  - Total parameters: **671B**\n  - Activation parameters: **36.7B** (including 0.9B for Embedding and 0.9B for the output Head).\n\n#### Structural Details\n\n- **Embedding Layer**:\n  - `model.embed_tokens.weight`\n- **Transformer Hidden Layers**:\n  - `model.layers.0` to `model.layers.60`, totaling `num_hidden_layers` layers.\n- **Output Layer**:\n  - `model.norm.weight`\n  - `lm_head.weight`\n\n### 2. Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) Modules\n\n- **Composition**:\n  - Additional MTP Modules defined by the `num_nextn_predict_layers` field. In this model, the value is set to 1.\n- **Parameter Count**:\n  - Parameters: **11.5B unique parameters**, excluding the shared 0.9B Embedding and 0.9B output Head).\n  - Activation parameters: **2.4B** (including the shared 0.9B Embedding and 0.9B output Head).\n\n#### Structural Details\n\n- **embed_tokens**: **Shares parameters** with the Embedding layer of the Main Model weights.\n- **enorm & hnorm**: RMSNorm parameters required for speculative decoding.\n- **eh_proj**: Parameters for dimensionality reduction projection on the norm results.\n- **Additional Transformer Hidden Layer**:\n  - `model.layers.61.self_attn & mlp` (structure identical to the Main Model hidden layers).\n- **shared_head**: **Shares parameters** with the output Head of the Main Model weights.\n\n---\n\n### Loading Rules\n\n- **Main Model Weights**: Loaded via the `num_hidden_layers` parameter in `config.json`.\n- **MTP Modules**: Loaded via the `num_nextn_predict_layers` parameter, with layer IDs appended immediately after the Main Model hidden layers. For example:\n  - If `num_hidden_layers = 61` and `num_nextn_predict_layers = 1`, the MTP Module's layer ID is `61`.\n\n---\n\n## FP8 Weight Documentation\n\nDeepSeek-V3 natively supports FP8 weight format with 128x128 block scaling.\n\n### FP8 Configuration\n\nThe FP8 weight file introduces a `quantization_config` field to describe the quantization method. Below is an example configuration:\n\n```json\n\"quantization_config\": {\n  \"activation_scheme\": \"dynamic\",\n  \"fmt\": \"e4m3\",\n  \"quant_method\": \"fp8\",\n  \"weight_block_size\": [128, 128]\n}\n```\n\n- **Quantization Format**:\n  - Format type: `fp8` and `e4m3` (corresponding to `torch.float8_e4m3fn`).\n  - Weight block size: `128x128`.\n- **Activation Quantization Scheme**:\n  - Utilizes dynamic activation quantization (`dynamic`).\n\n### Dequantization Method\n\nThe FP8 weight file includes a `weight_scale_inv` field, which stores the dequantization scale for each weight block.\n\n- **Storage Format**: `float32 Tensor`, stored alongside the weight data.\n- **Dequantization Formula**:\n  - If the weight block is not aligned to 128, it is zero-padded to 128 before calculating the scale. After quantization, the padded portion is removed.\n  - The dequantization process is performed as: `(128x128 weight block) * weight_scale_inv`.\n\nThrough dequantization of the FP8 weights, runtime operations enable online quantization at a granularity of `per-token-per-128-channel`.\n\n---\n"
