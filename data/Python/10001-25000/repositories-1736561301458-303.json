          "content": "# Contributing to Flet\n\nThank you for your interest in contributing to Flet!\n\n## Clone repo\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/flet-dev/flet\n```\n\n## Python SDK\n\n### Install Poetry\n\n#### Windows\n\n```powershell\n(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | py -\n```\n\nBe sure to add `%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Python\\Scripts` to `PATH`.\n\n#### macOS\n\n```\ncurl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -\n```\n\n### Open worker directory\n\n```\ncd sdk/python\n```\n\n### Install dependencies\n\nTo install all Flet dependencies and enable the project as editable package run:\n\n```\npoetry install\n```\n\n### Check the installation\n\nCreate `hello.py` file with a minimal Flet program:\n\n```python\nimport flet\nfrom flet import Page, Text\n\ndef main(page: Page):\n    page.add(Text(\"Hello, world!\"))\n\nflet.app(target=main)\n```\n\nand then run it:\n\n```\npoetry run python hello.py\n```\n\nDuring the first run Flet Client (`flet`) executable will be downloaded from [Flet GitHub releases](https://github.com/flet-dev/flet/releases) to a user temp directory and then started from there. The version of release to download from is taken from `flet/version.py` file.\n\nYou should see a new native OS window opened with \"Hello, world!\" in it.\n\n### Running tests\n\nPytest should be run with `poetry run`:\n\n```\npoetry run pytest\n```\n\n### Code formatting\n\nThe project uses [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) formatting style. All `.py` files in a PR must be black-formatted.\n\nInstall `black` extension for Visualtudio Code: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.black-formatter\n\nIDE-specific Black integration guides:\n\n- [VSCode: Using Black to automatically format Python](https://dev.to/adamlombard/how-to-use-the-black-python-code-formatter-in-vscode-3lo0)\n- [Formatting Python in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/formatting)\n\n#### Type checking\n\nEnable \"pylance\" type checking in VS Code.\n\nOpen user settings, search by \"pylance\", scroll down to **Python > Analysis: Type checking mode** section. Enable _basic_ mode.\n\n#### Sort imports on Save\n\nInstall `isort` extension for imports formatting: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.isort\n\n### pre-commit\n\n[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) is a dev dependency of Flet and is automatically installed by `poetry install`.\nTo install the pre-commit hooks run: `poetry run pre-commit install`.\nOnce installed, every time you commit, pre-commit will run the configured hooks against changed files.\n\n## Possible installation error when working with a source package\n\nWhen you run python3 hello.py, you might encounter an error like this:\n`FileNotFoundError: [Error 2] No such file or directory: '/var/folders/xm/cyv42vbs27gff3s39vy97rx00000gn/T/fletd-0.1.50/fletd'`\n\nTo resolve the issue, just delete this folder `../T/fletd-0.1.50/fletd`. The folder is the one with the FileNotFound Error encountered earlier.\n\nIt should work now.\n\n## Flutter client\n\nAdd the `FLET_VIEW_PATH` and `FLET_WEB_PATH` variables to the environment variables or profile scripts for your respective OS, making sure to modify the path accordingly:\n\n- On macOS (in `~/.zprofile` or any other profile script):\n```\n# Flet\nexport FLET_VIEW_PATH=\"$HOME/{path-to-flet}/flet/client/build/macos/Build/Products/Release\"\nexport FLET_WEB_PATH=\"$HOME/{path-to-flet}/flet/client/build/web\"\n```\n\n- On Windows (open \"System Properties\" > \"Environment Variables\", then add a new environment variable):\n  - as \"Variable name\", enter `FLET_VIEW_PATH`, and as \"Value\", `{path-to-flet}\\flet\\client\\build\\windows\\x64\\runner\\Release`\n  - as \"Variable name\", enter `FLET_WEB_PATH`, and as \"Value\", `{path-to-flet}\\flet\\client\\build\\web`\n\n- On Linux (in `~/.bash_profile` or any other profile script):\n```\n# Flet\nexport FLET_VIEW_PATH=\"$HOME/{path-to-flet}/flet/client/build/linux/{arch}/release/bundle\"\nexport FLET_WEB_PATH=\"$HOME/{path-to-flet}/flet/client/build/web\"\n```\n\nIf you have Microsoft Edge installed and want to use it for debugging Flutter apps:\n\n```\n# Flutter\nexport CHROME_EXECUTABLE=\"/Applications/Microsoft Edge.app/Contents/MacOS/Microsoft Edge\"\n```\n\nIf you added these through the terminal, close that terminal session and create a new one.\n\n### Building the Flutter client\nOpen an instance of your IDE (preferably VS Code) at the `flet-dev/flet/client` directory.\n\nFirst, run `printenv | grep FLET` (or `gci env:* | findstr FLET` on Windows) in the built-in terminal to make sure everything is set. You should see the above environment variables you set (`FLET_VIEW_PATH`, `FLET_WEB_PATH`) printed out.\n\n-  To build the Flutter client for MacOS, run:\n    ```\n    flutter build macos\n    ```\n    When the build is complete, you should see the Flet bundle in the `FLET_VIEW_PATH`. (Running it will open a blank window.)\n-  To build the Flutter client for Web, run the below command:\n    ```\n    flutter build web\n    ```   \n    When the build is complete, a directory `client/build/web` will be created.\n\n### Running the Flutter client\nNow open another instance of VS Code at `flet-dev/flet/sdk/python` directory.\n\nCreate a new folder preferably named `playground` (it has been added to the gitignore) in which you will test your additions.\n\nTry running the below command, where `<your-main.py>` is the file to test your additions:\n\n```bash\npoetry run flet run -w -p 8550 playground/<your-main.py>\n```\nYou should see http://127.0.0.1:8550/ opened in the browser and also a desktop window with the output of your code.\nMaking changes to the `<your-main.py>` will automatically trigger a hot reload.\n\nNow, switch to your flutter vscode instance and run the below command to start/connect the flet client:\n```bash\nflutter run\n```\nthen choose your device from the shown options.\nYou will be able to see the debugging outputs of the flet client in this terminal.\n\n### Restarting/Rebuilding\n\n- When you make changes to the flet **dart** files, you will need to restart/rerun the Flutter client for the changes to take effect in your playground. There are two ways to do this:\n  - fastest: press the keyboard button `R` while in the client's terminal (press `h` to see all other possible options);\n  - slowest: use `flutter run` as seen previously.\n\n- When you make changes to the flet **python** files, you will need to restart/rerun the Python client for the changes to take effect in the opened flutter applications. This is done with the same command:\n    ```bash\n    poetry run flet run -w -p 8550 playground/<your-main.py>\n    ```\n\n## Releasing Flet\n\n* Create a new `prepare-{version}` branch in [flet-dev/flet](https://github.com/flet-dev/flet) repository.\n* For every package in `packages/flet*` directory:\n  * Update package version to `{version}` in `pubspec.yaml`.\n  * Add `# {version}` with new/changed/fixed items into `CHANGELOG.md`. Only `packages/flet/CHANGELOG.md` should contain real items; other packages could have just a stub.\n* Copy `# {version}` section from `packages/flet/CHANGELOG.md` to the root `CHANGELOG.md`.\n* Open terminal in `client` directory and run `flutter pub get` to update Flet dependency versions in `client/pubspec.lock`.\n* Create a new `{version}` branch in [flet-dev/flet-app-templates](https://github.com/flet-dev/flet-app-templates) repository from a previously released `{current-version}` branch.\n* Create a new `{version}` branch in [flet-dev/flet-build-template](https://github.com/flet-dev/flet-build-template) repository from a previously released `{current-version}` branch.\n* Create `Prepare Flet {version}` PR to merge into `main` branch.\n* In `Build Flet package for Flutter` job of [Flet CI build](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/flet-dev/flet) make sure analysis report of every `flet*` Flutter package has only 1 issue \"Publishable packages can't have 'path' dependencies.\".\n* Merge `Prepare Flet {version}` PR.\n* Create and push new `v{version}` tag (with `v` prefix).\n* Update release notes at `https://github.com/flet-dev/flet/releases/tag/v{version}`.\n\n## New macOS environment for Flet developer\n\n* **Homebrew**: https://brew.sh/\n\nAfter installing homebrew, install xz libraries with it:\n```\nbrew install xz\n```\n\n* **Pyenv**.

No frontend experience is required.\n\n### ⚡From idea to app in minutes\n\nAn internal tool or a dashboard for your team, weekend project, data entry form, kiosk app, or high-fidelity prototype - Flet is an ideal framework to quickly hack great-looking interactive apps to serve a group of users.\n\n### 📐 Simple architecture\n\nNo more complex architecture with JavaScript frontend, REST API backend, database, cache, etc. With Flet you just write a monolith stateful app in Python only and get multi-user, real-time Single-Page Application (SPA).\n\n### 🔋Batteries included\n\nTo start developing with Flet, you just need your favorite IDE or text editor. No SDKs, no thousands of dependencies, no complex tooling - Flet has a built-in web server with assets hosting and desktop clients.\n\n### &nbsp;<img src=\"media/flutter/icon_flutter.svg\" height=\"20px\" />&nbsp;&nbsp;Powered by Flutter\n\nFlet UI is built with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), so your app looks professional and could be delivered to any platform. Flet simplifies the Flutter model by combining smaller \"widgets\" to ready-to-use \"controls\" with an imperative programming model.\n\n### 🌐 Speaks your language\n\nFlet is language-agnostic, so anyone on your team could develop Flet apps in their favorite language. [Python](https://flet.dev/docs/guides/python/getting-started) is already supported, Go, C# and others are [coming next](https://flet.dev/roadmap).\n\n### 📱 Deliver to any device\n\nDeploy Flet app as a web app and view it in a browser. Package it as a standalone desktop app for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Install it on mobile as [PWA](https://web.dev/what-are-pwas/) or view via Flet app for iOS and Android.\n\n## Flet app example\n\nAt the moment you can write Flet apps in Python and other languages will be added soon.\n\nHere is a sample \"Counter\" app:\n\n```python title=\"counter.py\"\nimport flet\nfrom flet import IconButton, Page, Row, TextField, icons\n\ndef main(page: Page):\n    page.title = \"Flet counter example\"\n    page.vertical_alignment = \"center\"\n\n    txt_number = TextField(value=\"0\", text_align=\"right\", width=100)\n\n    def minus_click(e):\n        txt_number.value = str(int(txt_number.value) - 1)\n        page.update()\n\n    def plus_click(e):\n        txt_number.value = str(int(txt_number.value) + 1)\n        page.update()\n\n    page.add(\n        Row(\n            [\n                IconButton(icons.REMOVE, on_click=minus_click),\n                txt_number,\n                IconButton(icons.ADD, on_click=plus_click),\n            ],\n            alignment=\"center\",\n        )\n    )\n\nflet.app(target=main)\n```\n\nTo run the app install `flet` module:\n\n```bash\npip install flet\n```\n\nand run the program:\n\n```bash\npython counter.py\n```\n\nThe app will be started in a native OS window - what a nice alternative to Electron!\n\n<img src=\"https://flet.dev/img/docs/getting-started/flet-counter-macos.png\" width=\"45%\" />\n\n\nNow, if you want to run the app as a web app, just replace the last line with:\n\n```python\nflet.app(target=main, view=flet.AppView.WEB_BROWSER)\n```\n\nrun again and now you instantly get a web app:\n\n<img src=\"https://flet.dev/img/docs/getting-started/flet-counter-safari.png\" width=\"60%\" />\n\n## Getting started\n\n* [Creating Flet apps in Python](https://flet.dev/docs/guides/python/getting-started)\n* [Controls reference](https://flet.dev/docs/controls)\n\n## Sample apps in Python\n\n* [Greeter](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/blob/main/python/apps/greeter/greeter.py) ([Online Demo](https://gallery.flet.dev/greeter/))\n* [Counter](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/blob/main/python/apps/counter/counter.py) ([Online Demo](https://gallery.flet.dev/counter/))\n* [To-Do](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/blob/main/python/apps/todo/todo.py) ([Online Demo](https://gallery.flet.dev/todo/))\n* [Icons Browser](https://github.com/flet-dev/examples/blob/main/python/apps/icons-browser/main.py) ([Online Demo](https://gallery.flet.dev/icons-browser/))\n\nMore demo applications can be found in the [gallery](https://flet.dev/gallery/).\n\n## Community\n\n* [Discussions](https://github.com/flet-dev/flet/discussions)\n* [Discord](https://discord.gg/dzWXP8SHG8)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fletdev)\n* [Email](mailto:hello@flet.dev)\n\n## Contribute to this wonderful project\n\n* Read the <a href=\"https://github.com/flet-dev/flet/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\">CONTRIBUTING.md</a> file\n"
