          "content": "# How to contribute to TRL?\n\nEveryone is welcome to contribute, and we value everybody's contribution. Code\ncontributions are not the only way to help the community. Answering questions, helping\nothers, and improving the documentation are also immensely valuable.\n\nIt also helps us if you spread the word! Reference the library in blog posts\nabout the awesome projects it made possible, shout out on Twitter every time it has\nhelped you, or simply ⭐️ the repository to say thank you.\n\nHowever you choose to contribute, please be mindful and respect our\n[code of conduct](https://github.com/huggingface/trl/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n**This guide was heavily inspired by the awesome [scikit-learn guide to contributing](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).**\n\n## Ways to contribute\n\nThere are several ways you can contribute to TRL:\n\n* Fix outstanding issues with the existing code.\n* Submit issues related to bugs or desired new features.\n* Implement trainers for new post-training algorithms.\n* Contribute to the examples or the documentation.\n\nIf you don't know where to start, there is a special [Good First\nIssue](https://github.com/huggingface/trl/contribute) listing. It will give you a list of\nopen issues that are beginner-friendly and help you start contributing to open-source. The best way to do that is to open a Pull Request and link it to the issue that you'd like to work on. We try to give priority to opened PRs as we can easily track the progress of the fix, and if the contributor does not have time anymore, someone else can take the PR over.\n\nFor something slightly more challenging, you can also take a look at the [Good Second Issue](https://github.com/huggingface/trl/labels/Good%20Second%20Issue) list. In general though, if you feel like you know what you're doing, go for it and we'll help you get there! 🚀\n\n> All contributions are equally valuable to the community. 🥰\n\nBefore you start contributing make sure you have installed all the dev tools:\n\n```bash\npip install -e .[dev]\n```\n\n## Fixing outstanding issues\n\nIf you notice an issue with the existing code and have a fix in mind, feel free to [start contributing](#create-a-pull-request) and open a Pull Request!\n\n## Submitting a bug-related issue or feature request\n\nDo your best to follow these guidelines when submitting a bug-related issue or a feature request. It will make it easier for us to come back to you quickly and with good feedback.\n\n### Did you find a bug?\n\nThe TRL library is robust and reliable thanks to users who report the problems they encounter.\n\nBefore you report an issue, we would really appreciate it if you could **make sure the bug was not\nalready reported** (use the search bar on GitHub under Issues). Your issue should also be related to bugs in the library itself, and not your code.\n\nOnce you've confirmed the bug hasn't already been reported, please include the following information in your issue so we can quickly resolve it:\n\n* Your **OS type and version**, **Python**, **PyTorch**, **TRL** and **Transformers** versions.\n* A short, self-contained, code snippet that allows us to reproduce the bug in\n  less than 30s.\n* The *full* traceback if an exception is raised.\n* Attach any other additional information, like screenshots, you think may help.\n\nTo get the OS and software versions automatically, run the following command:\n\n```bash\ntrl env\n```\n\n### Do you want a new feature?\n\nIf there is a new feature you'd like to see in TRL, please open an issue and describe:\n\n1. What is the *motivation* behind this feature? Is it related to a problem or frustration with the library? Is it a feature related to something you need for a project? Is it something you worked on and think it could benefit the community?\n\n   Whatever it is, we'd love to hear about it!\n\n2. Describe your requested feature in as much detail as possible. The more you can tell us about it, the better we'll be able to help you.\n3. Provide a *code snippet* that demonstrates the feature's usage.\n4. If the feature is related to a paper, please include a link.\n\nIf your issue is well written we're already 80% of the way there by the time you create it.\n\n## Do you want to implement a new trainer?\n\nNew post-training methods are published frequently and those that satisfy the following criteria are good candidates to be integrated into TRL:\n\n* **Simplicity:** Does the new method achieve similar performance as prior methods, but with less complexity? A good example is Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) [[Rafailov et al, 2023]](https://huggingface.co/papers/2305.18290), which provided a simpler and compelling alternative to RLHF methods.\n* **Efficiency:** Does the new method provide a significant improvement in training efficiency? A good example is Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO) [[Hong et al, 2023]](https://huggingface.co/papers/2403.07691), which utilizes a similar objective as DPO but requires half the GPU VRAM.\n\nMethods that only provide incremental improvements at the expense of added complexity or compute costs are unlikely to be included in TRL.\n\nIf you want to implement a trainer for a new post-training method, first open an issue and provide the following information:\n\n* A short description of the method and a link to the paper.\n* Link to the implementation if it is open-sourced.\n* Link to model weights trained with the method if they are available.\n\nBased on the community and maintainer feedback, the next step will be to implement the trainer and config classes. See the following examples for inspiration:\n\n* Paired preference optimisation: [`dpo_trainer.py`](./trl/trainer/dpo_trainer.py) and [`dpo_config.py`](./trl/trainer/dpo_config.py)\n* RL-based optimisation: [`rloo_trainer.py](./trl/trainer/rloo_trainer.py) and [`rloo_config.py](./trl/trainer/rloo_config.py)\n* Online optimisation: [`online_dpo_trainer.py`](./trl/trainer/online_dpo_trainer.py) and [`online_dpo_config.py`](./trl/trainer/online_dpo_config.py)\n\n## Do you want to add documentation?\n\nWe're always looking for improvements to the documentation that make it more clear and accurate. Please let us know how the documentation can be improved, such as typos, dead links, and any missing, unclear, or inaccurate content... We'll be happy to make the changes or help you contribute if you're interested!\n\n## Submitting a pull request (PR)\n\nBefore writing code, we strongly advise you to search through the existing PRs or\nissues to make sure that nobody is already working on the same thing. If you are\nunsure, it is always a good idea to open an issue to get some feedback.\n\nYou will need basic `git` proficiency to be able to contribute to\nTRL. `git` is not the easiest tool to use but it has the greatest\nmanual. Type `git --help` in a shell and enjoy. If you prefer books, [Pro\nGit](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is a very good reference.\n\nFollow these steps to start contributing:\n\n1. Fork the [repository](https://github.com/huggingface/trl) by\n   clicking on the 'Fork' button on the repository's page. This creates a copy of the code\n   under your GitHub user account.\n\n2. Clone your fork to your local disk, and add the base repository as a remote. The following command\n   assumes you have your public SSH key uploaded to GitHub. See the following guide for more\n   [information](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git clone git@github.com:<your Github handle>/trl.git\n   $ cd trl\n   $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/huggingface/trl.git\n   ```\n\n3. Create a new branch to hold your development changes, and do this for every new PR you work on.\n\n   Start by synchronizing your `main` branch with the `upstream/main` branch (more details in the [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork)):\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git checkout main\n   $ git fetch upstream\n   $ git merge upstream/main\n   ```\n\n   Once your `main` branch is synchronized, create a new branch from it:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git checkout -b a-descriptive-name-for-my-changes\n   ```\n\n   **Do not** work on the `main` branch.\n\n4. Set up a development environment by running the following command in a conda or a virtual environment you've created for working on this library:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ pip install -e .[dev]\n   ```\n\n   (If TRL was already installed in the virtual environment, remove\n   it with `pip uninstall trl` before reinstalling it.)\n\n   Alternatively, if you are using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download), the fastest way to get set up is by using\n   the provided Dev Container. Documentation on how to get started with dev containers is available [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers).\n\n5. Develop the features on your branch.\n\n   As you work on the features, you should make sure that the test suite\n   passes. You should run the tests impacted by your changes like this (see \n   below an explanation regarding the environment variable):\n\n   ```bash\n   $ pytest tests/<TEST_TO_RUN>.py\n   ```\n   \n   > For the following commands leveraging the `make` utility, we recommend using the WSL system when running on\n   > Windows. More information [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about).\n\n   You can also run the full suite with the following command.\n\n   ```bash\n   $ make test\n   ```\n\n    TRL relies on `ruff` for maintaining consistent code formatting across its source files. Before submitting any PR, you should apply automatic style corrections and run code verification checks.\n\n    We provide a `precommit` target in the `Makefile` that simplifies this process by running all required checks and optimizations on only the files modified by your PR.\n\n    To apply these checks and corrections in one step, use:\n\n    ```bash\n    $ make precommit\n    ```\n\n    This command runs the following:\n    - Executes `pre-commit` hooks to automatically fix style issues with `ruff` and other tools.\n    - Runs additional scripts such as adding copyright information.\n\n    If you prefer to apply the style corrections separately or review them individually, the `pre-commit` hook will handle the formatting for the files in question.\n\n   Once you're happy with your changes, add changed files using `git add` and\n   make a commit with `git commit` to record your changes locally:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git add modified_file.py\n   $ git commit\n   ```\n\n   Please write [good commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).\n\n   It is a good idea to sync your copy of the code with the original\n   repository regularly. This way you can quickly account for changes:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git fetch upstream\n   $ git rebase upstream/main\n   ```\n\n   Push the changes to your account using:\n\n   ```bash\n   $ git push -u origin a-descriptive-name-for-my-changes\n   ```\n\n6. Once you are satisfied (**and the checklist below is happy too**), go to the\n   webpage of your fork on GitHub. Click on 'Pull request' to send your changes\n   to the project maintainers for review.\n\n7. It's ok if maintainers ask you for changes. It happens to core contributors too! To ensure everyone can review your changes in the pull request, work on your local branch and push the updates to your fork. They will automatically appear in the pull request.\n\n\n### Checklist\n\n1. The title of your pull request should be a summary of its contribution;\n2. If your pull request addresses an issue, please mention the issue number in\n   the pull request description to make sure they are linked (and people\n   consulting the issue know you are working on it);\n3. To indicate a work in progress please prefix the title with `[WIP]`, or mark\n   the PR as a draft PR. These are useful to avoid duplicated work, and to differentiate\n   it from PRs ready to be merged;\n4. Make sure existing tests pass;\n5. Add high-coverage tests. No quality testing = no merge.\n\n\n### Tests\n\nAn extensive test suite is included to test the library behavior and several examples. Library tests can be found in\nthe [tests folder](https://github.com/huggingface/trl/tree/main/tests).\n\nWe use `pytest` to run the tests. From the root of the\nrepository here's how to run tests with `pytest` for the library:\n\n```bash\n$ python -m pytest -sv ./tests\n```\n\nThat's how `make test` is implemented (without the `pip install` line)!\n\nYou can specify a smaller set of tests to test only the feature\nyou're working on.\n\n### Deprecation and Backward Compatibility\n\nOur approach to deprecation and backward compatibility is flexible and based on the feature’s usage and impact. Each deprecation is carefully evaluated, aiming to balance innovation with user needs.\n\nWhen a feature or component is marked for deprecation, its use will emit a warning message. This warning will include:\n\n- **Transition Guidance**: Instructions on how to migrate to the alternative solution or replacement.\n- **Removal Version**: The target version when the feature will be removed, providing users with a clear timeframe to transition.\n\nExample:\n   \n   ```python\n   warnings.warn(\n       \"The `Trainer.foo` method is deprecated and will be removed in version 0.14.0. \"\n       \"Please use the `Trainer.bar` class instead.\",\n       FutureWarning,\n   )\n   ```\n\nThe deprecation and removal schedule is based on each feature's usage and impact, with examples at two extremes:\n\n- **Experimental or Low-Use Features**: For a feature that is experimental or has limited usage, backward compatibility may not be maintained between releases. Users should therefore anticipate potential breaking changes from one version to the next.\n\n- **Widely-Used Components**: For a feature with high usage, we aim for a more gradual transition period of approximately **5 months**, generally scheduling deprecation around **5 minor releases** after the initial warning.\n\nThese examples represent the two ends of a continuum. The specific timeline for each feature will be determined individually, balancing innovation with user stability needs.\n\n### Working with warnings\n\nWarnings play a critical role in guiding users toward resolving potential issues, but they should be used thoughtfully to avoid unnecessary noise. Unlike logging, which provides informational context or operational details, warnings signal conditions that require attention and action. Overusing warnings can dilute their importance, leading users to ignore them entirely.\n\n#### Definitions\n\n- **Correct**: An operation is correct if it is valid, follows the intended approach, and aligns with the current best practices or guidelines within the codebase. This is the recommended or intended way to perform the operation.\n- **Supported**: An operation is supported if it is technically valid and works within the current codebase, but it may not be the most efficient, optimal, or recommended way to perform the task. This includes deprecated features or legacy approaches that still work but may be phased out in the future.\n\n#### Choosing the right message\n\n- **Correct → No warning**:  \n   If the operation is fully valid and expected, no message should be issued. The system is working as intended, so no warning is necessary.  \n\n- **Correct but deserves attention → No warning, possibly a log message**:\n   When an operation is correct but uncommon or requires special attention, providing an informational message can be helpful. This keeps users informed without implying any issue. If available, use the logger to output this message. Example:  \n\n   ```python\n   logger.info(\"This is an informational message about a rare but correct operation.\")\n   ```\n\n- **Correct but very likely a mistake → Warning with option to disable**:  \n   In rare cases, you may want to issue a warning for a correct operation that’s very likely a mistake. In such cases, you must provide an option to suppress the warning. This can be done with a flag in the function. Example:  \n\n   ```python\n   def my_function(foo, bar, _warn=True):\n       if foo == bar:\n           if _warn:\n               warnings.warn(\"foo and bar are the same, this is likely a mistake. Ignore this warning by setting `_warn=False`.\")\n           # Do something\n   ```\n\n- **Supported but not correct → Warning**:  \n   If the operation is technically supported but is deprecated, suboptimal, or could cause future issues (e.g., conflicting arguments), a warning should be raised. This message should be actionable, meaning it must explain how to resolve the issue. Example:  \n\n   ```python\n   def my_function(foo, bar):\n       if foo and bar:\n           warnings.warn(\"Both `foo` and `bar` were provided, but only one is allowed. Ignoring `foo`. Please pass only one of these arguments.\")\n           # Do something\n   ```\n\n- **Not supported → Exception**:  \n   If the operation is invalid or unsupported, raise an exception. This indicates that the operation cannot be performed and requires immediate attention. Example:  \n\n   ```python\n   def my_function(foo, bar):\n       if foo and bar:\n           raise ValueError(\"Both `foo` and `bar` were provided, but only one is allowed. Please pass only one of these arguments.\")\n   ```\n\nBy following this classification, you ensure that warnings, information, and exceptions are used appropriately, providing clear guidance to the user without cluttering the system with unnecessary messages.\n"

Built on top of the [🤗 Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) ecosystem, TRL supports a variety of model architectures and modalities, and can be scaled-up across various hardware setups.\n\n## Highlights\n\n- **Efficient and scalable**: \n    - Leverages [🤗 Accelerate](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate) to scale from single GPU to multi-node clusters using methods like DDP and DeepSpeed.\n    - Full integration with [`PEFT`](https://github.com/huggingface/peft) enables training on large models with modest hardware via quantization and LoRA/QLoRA.\n    - Integrates [Unsloth](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth) for accelerating training using optimized kernels.\n\n- **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: A simple interface lets you fine-tune and interact with models without needing to write code.\n\n- **Trainers**: Various fine-tuning methods are easily accessible via trainers like [`SFTTrainer`](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/sft_trainer), [`DPOTrainer`](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/dpo_trainer), [`RewardTrainer`](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/reward_trainer), [`ORPOTrainer`](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/orpo_trainer) and more.\n\n- **AutoModels**: Use pre-defined model classes like [`AutoModelForCausalLMWithValueHead`](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/models#trl.AutoModelForCausalLMWithValueHead) to simplify reinforcement learning (RL) with LLMs.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Python Package\n\nInstall the library using `pip`:\n\n```bash\npip install trl\n```\n\n### From source\n\nIf you want to use the latest features before an official release, you can install TRL from source:\n\n```bash\npip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/trl.git\n```\n\n### Repository\n\nIf you want to use the examples you can clone the repository with the following command:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/huggingface/trl.git\n```\n\n## Command Line Interface (CLI)\n\nYou can use the TRL Command Line Interface (CLI) to quickly get started with Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), or vibe check your model with the chat CLI: \n\n**SFT:**\n\n```bash\ntrl sft --model_name_or_path Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B \\\n    --dataset_name trl-lib/Capybara \\\n    --output_dir Qwen2.5-0.5B-SFT\n```\n\n**DPO:**\n\n```bash\ntrl dpo --model_name_or_path Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct \\\n    --dataset_name argilla/Capybara-Preferences \\\n    --output_dir Qwen2.5-0.5B-DPO \n```\n\n**Chat:**\n\n```bash\ntrl chat --model_name_or_path Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct\n```\n\nRead more about CLI in the [relevant documentation section](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/main/en/clis) or use `--help` for more details.\n\n## How to use\n\nFor more flexibility and control over training, TRL provides dedicated trainer classes to post-train language models or PEFT adapters on a custom dataset. Each trainer in TRL is a light wrapper around the 🤗 Transformers trainer and natively supports distributed training methods like DDP, DeepSpeed ZeRO, and FSDP.\n\n### `SFTTrainer`\n\nHere is a basic example of how to use the `SFTTrainer`:\n\n```python\nfrom trl import SFTConfig, SFTTrainer\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\n\ndataset = load_dataset(\"trl-lib/Capybara\", split=\"train\")\n\ntraining_args = SFTConfig(output_dir=\"Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-SFT\")\ntrainer = SFTTrainer(\n    args=training_args,\n    model=\"Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B\",\n    train_dataset=dataset,\n)\ntrainer.train()\n```\n\n### `RewardTrainer`\n\nHere is a basic example of how to use the `RewardTrainer`:\n\n```python\nfrom trl import RewardConfig, RewardTrainer\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, AutoTokenizer\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct\")\nmodel = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(\n    \"Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct\", num_labels=1\n)\nmodel.config.pad_token_id = tokenizer.pad_token_id\n\ndataset = load_dataset(\"trl-lib/ultrafeedback_binarized\", split=\"train\")\n\ntraining_args = RewardConfig(output_dir=\"Qwen2.5-0.5B-Reward\", per_device_train_batch_size=2)\ntrainer = RewardTrainer(\n    args=training_args,\n    model=model,\n    processing_class=tokenizer,\n    train_dataset=dataset,\n)\ntrainer.train()\n```\n\n### `RLOOTrainer`\n\n`RLOOTrainer` implements a [REINFORCE-style optimization](https://huggingface.co/papers/2402.14740) for RLHF that is more performant and memory-efficient than PPO. Here is a basic example of how to use the `RLOOTrainer`:\n\n```python\nfrom trl import RLOOConfig, RLOOTrainer, apply_chat_template\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\nfrom transformers import (\n    AutoModelForCausalLM,\n    AutoModelForSequenceClassification,\n    AutoTokenizer,\n)\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct\")\nreward_model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(\n    \"Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct\", num_labels=1\n)\nref_policy = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct\")\npolicy = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct\")\n\ndataset = load_dataset(\"trl-lib/ultrafeedback-prompt\")\ndataset = dataset.map(apply_chat_template, fn_kwargs={\"tokenizer\": tokenizer})\ndataset = dataset.map(lambda x: tokenizer(x[\"prompt\"]), remove_columns=\"prompt\")\n\ntraining_args = RLOOConfig(output_dir=\"Qwen2.5-0.5B-RL\")\ntrainer = RLOOTrainer(\n    config=training_args,\n    processing_class=tokenizer,\n    policy=policy,\n    ref_policy=ref_policy,\n    reward_model=reward_model,\n    train_dataset=dataset[\"train\"],\n    eval_dataset=dataset[\"test\"],\n)\ntrainer.train()\n```\n\n### `DPOTrainer`\n\n`DPOTrainer` implements the popular [Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) algorithm](https://huggingface.co/papers/2305.18290) that was used to post-train Llama 3 and many other models. Here is a basic example of how to use the `DPOTrainer`:\n\n```python\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\nfrom trl import DPOConfig, DPOTrainer\n\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct\")\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct\")\ndataset = load_dataset(\"trl-lib/ultrafeedback_binarized\", split=\"train\")\ntraining_args = DPOConfig(output_dir=\"Qwen2.5-0.5B-DPO\")\ntrainer = DPOTrainer(model=model, args=training_args, train_dataset=dataset, processing_class=tokenizer)\ntrainer.train()\n```\n\n## Development\n\nIf you want to contribute to `trl` or customize it to your needs make sure to read the [contribution guide](https://github.com/huggingface/trl/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and make sure you make a dev install:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/huggingface/trl.git\ncd trl/\npip install -e .[dev]\n```\n\n## Citation\n\n```bibtex\n@misc{vonwerra2022trl,\n  author = {Leandro von Werra and Younes Belkada and Lewis Tunstall and Edward Beeching and Tristan Thrush and Nathan Lambert and Shengyi Huang and Kashif Rasul and Quentin Gallouédec},\n  title = {TRL: Transformer Reinforcement Learning},\n  year = {2020},\n  publisher = {GitHub},\n  journal = {GitHub repository},\n  howpublished = {\\url{https://github.com/huggingface/trl}}\n}\n```\n\n## License\n\nThis repository's source code is available under the [Apache-2.0 License](LICENSE).\n"

Prerequisites:\n   - Dependencies:\n     - twine: \"pip install twine\"\n   - Create an account in (and join the 'trl' project):\n     - PyPI: https://pypi.org/\n     - Test PyPI: https://test.pypi.org/\n\n1. Change the version in:\n   - __init__.py\n   - setup.py\n\n2. Commit these changes: \"git commit -m 'Release: VERSION'\"\n\n3. Add a tag in git to mark the release: \"git tag VERSION -m 'Add tag VERSION for pypi'\"\n   Push the tag to remote: git push --tags origin main\n\n4. Build both the sources and the wheel. Do not change anything in setup.py between\n   creating the wheel and the source distribution (obviously).\n\n   First, delete any \"build\" directory that may exist from previous builds.\n\n   For the wheel, run: \"python setup.py bdist_wheel\" in the top level directory.\n   (this will build a wheel for the python version you use to build it).\n\n   For the sources, run: \"python setup.py sdist\"\n   You should now have a /dist directory with both .whl and .tar.gz source versions.\n\n5. Check that everything looks correct by uploading the package to the pypi test server:\n\n   twine upload dist/* -r pypitest --repository-url=https://test.pypi.org/legacy/\n\n   Check that you can install it in a virtualenv/notebook by running:\n   pip install huggingface_hub fsspec aiohttp\n   pip install -U tqdm\n   pip install -i https://testpypi.python.org/pypi evaluate\n\n6. Upload the final version to actual pypi:\n   twine upload dist/* -r pypi\n\n7. Fill release notes in the tag in github once everything is looking hunky-dory.\n\n8. Change the version in __init__.py and setup.py to X.X.X+1.dev0 (e.g. VERSION=1.18.3 -> 1.18.4.dev0).\n   Then push the change with a message 'set dev version'\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom setuptools import find_packages, setup\n\n\n__version__ = \"0.14.0.dev0\"  # expected format is one of x.y.z.dev0, or x.y.z.rc1 or x.y.z (no to dashes, yes to dots)\n\nREQUIRED_PKGS = [\n    \"accelerate>=0.34.0\",\n    \"datasets>=2.21.0\",\n    \"rich\",  # rich shouldn't be a required package for trl, we should remove it from here\n    \"transformers>=4.46.0\",\n]\nEXTRAS = {\n    # Windows support is partially supported with DeepSpeed https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed/tree/master#windows\n    \"deepspeed\": [\"deepspeed>=0.14.4; sys_platform != 'win32'\"],\n    \"diffusers\": [\"diffusers>=0.18.0\"],\n    \"judges\": [\"openai>=1.23.2\", \"llm-blender>=0.0.2\"],\n    # liger-kernel depends on triton, which is only available on Linux https://github.com/triton-lang/triton#compatibility\n    \"liger\": [\"liger-kernel>=0.4.0; sys_platform != 'win32'\"],\n    \"mergekit\": [\"mergekit>=0.0.5.1\"],\n    \"peft\": [\"peft>=0.8.0\"],\n    \"quantization\": [\"bitsandbytes\"],\n    \"scikit\": [\"scikit-learn\"],\n    \"test\": [\"parameterized\", \"pytest-cov\", \"pytest-rerunfailures\", \"pytest-xdist\", \"pytest\"],\n    \"vlm\": [\"Pillow\"],\n}\nEXTRAS[\"dev\"] = []\nfor reqs in EXTRAS.values():\n    EXTRAS[\"dev\"].extend(reqs)\n\n\nsetup(\n    name=\"trl\",\n    license=\"Apache 2.0\",\n    classifiers=[\n        \"Development Status :: 2 - Pre-Alpha\",\n        \"Intended Audience :: Developers\",\n        \"Intended Audience :: Science/Research\",\n        \"License :: OSI Approved :: Apache Software License\",\n        \"Natural Language :: English\",\n        \"Operating System :: OS Independent\",\n        \"Programming Language :: Python :: 3\",\n        \"Programming Language :: Python :: 3.9\",\n        \"Programming Language :: Python :: 3.10\",\n        \"Programming Language :: Python :: 3.11\",\n        \"Programming Language :: Python :: 3.12\",\n    ],\n    url=\"https://github.com/huggingface/trl\",\n    entry_points={\n        \"console_scripts\": [\"trl=trl.cli:main\"],\n    },\n    include_package_data=True,\n    package_data={\n        \"trl\": [\"templates/*.md\"],\n    },\n    packages=find_packages(exclude={\"tests\", \"tests.slow\"}),\n    install_requires=REQUIRED_PKGS,\n    extras_require=EXTRAS,\n    python_requires=\">=3.9\",\n    long_description=open(\"README.md\", encoding=\"utf-8\").read(),\n    long_description_content_type=\"text/markdown\",\n    zip_safe=False,\n    version=__version__,\n    description=\"Train transformer language models with reinforcement learning.\",\n    keywords=\"ppo, transformers, huggingface, gpt2, language modeling, rlhf\",\n    author=\"Leandro von Werra\",\n    author_email=\"leandro.vonwerra@gmail.com\",\n)\n"
