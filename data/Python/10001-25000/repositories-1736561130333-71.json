Correction\n\n**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed\nunprofessional or unwelcome in the community.\n\n**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing\nclarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the\nbehavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.\n\n### 2. Warning\n\n**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series\nof actions.\n\n**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No\ninteraction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with\nthose enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This\nincludes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels\nlike social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or\npermanent ban.\n\n### 3. Temporary Ban\n\n**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including\nsustained inappropriate behavior.\n\n**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public\ncommunication with the community for a specified period of time.

Make sure it is not already assigned to someone else. You have the assignee (if any) on the top of the right column of the Issue page.\n\n2. You can self-assign it by commenting on the Issue page with the keyword: `#self-assign`.\n\n3. Work on your self-assigned issue and eventually create a Pull Request.\n\n## How to create a Pull Request?\nIf you want to add a dataset see specific instructions in the section [*How to add a dataset*](#how-to-add-a-dataset).\n\n1. Fork the [repository](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets) by clicking on the 'Fork' button on the repository's page. This creates a copy of the code under your GitHub user account.\n\n2. Clone your fork to your local disk, and add the base repository as a remote:\n\n    ```bash\n    git clone git@github.com:<your Github handle>/datasets.git\n    cd datasets\n    git remote add upstream https://github.com/huggingface/datasets.git\n    ```\n\n3. Create a new branch to hold your development changes:\n\n    ```bash\n    git checkout -b a-descriptive-name-for-my-changes\n    ```\n\n    **do not** work on the `main` branch.\n\n4. Set up a development environment by running the following command in a virtual environment:\n\n    Simple setup with code formatting only (recommended)\n    ```bash\n    pip install -e \".[quality]\"\n    ```\n    \n    Advanced setup with all the optional dependencies\n    ```bash\n    pip install -e \".[dev]\"\n    ```\n\n   (If datasets was already installed in the virtual environment, remove\n   it with `pip uninstall datasets` before reinstalling it in editable\n   mode with the `-e` flag.)\n\n5. Develop the features on your branch.\n\n6. Format your code. Run `black` and `ruff` so that your newly added files look nice with the following command:\n\n    ```bash\n    make style\n    ```\n   \n7. _(Optional)_ You can also use [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) to format your code automatically each time run `git commit`, instead of running `make style` manually. \nTo do this, install `pre-commit` via `pip install pre-commit` and then run `pre-commit install` in the project's root directory to set up the hooks.\nNote that if any files were formatted by `pre-commit` hooks during committing, you have to run `git commit` again .\n\n\n8. Once you're happy with your contribution, add your changed files and make a commit to record your changes locally:\n\n    ```bash\n    git add -u\n    git commit\n    ```\n\n    It is a good idea to sync your copy of the code with the original\n    repository regularly. This way you can quickly account for changes:\n\n    ```bash\n    git fetch upstream\n    git rebase upstream/main\n    ```\n\n9. Once you are satisfied, push the changes to your fork repo using:\n\n   ```bash\n   git push -u origin a-descriptive-name-for-my-changes\n   ```\n\n   Go the webpage of your fork on GitHub. Click on \"Pull request\" to send your to the project maintainers for review.\n\n## Datasets on Hugging Face\n\n### How to add a dataset on Hugging Face\n\nYou can share your dataset on https://huggingface.co/datasets directly using your account (no need to open a PR on GitHub), see the documentation:\n\n* [Create a dataset and upload files on the website](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/upload_dataset)\n* [Advanced guide using the CLI](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/share)\n\n### How to contribute to the dataset cards\n\nImproving the documentation of datasets is an ever-increasing effort, and we invite users to contribute by sharing their insights with the community in the `README.md` dataset cards provided for each dataset.\n\nIf you see that a dataset card is missing information that you are in a position to provide (as an author of the dataset or as an experienced user), the best thing you can do is to open a Pull Request on the Hugging Face Hub. To do, go to the \"Files and versions\" tab of the dataset page and edit the `README.md` file. We provide:\n\n* a [template](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/blob/main/templates/README.md)\n* a [guide](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/blob/main/templates/README_guide.md) describing what information should go into each of the paragraphs\n* and if you need inspiration, we recommend looking through a [completed example](https://huggingface.co/datasets/eli5/blob/main/README.md)\n\nIf you are a **dataset author**... you know what to do, it is your dataset after all ;) ! We would especially appreciate if you could help us fill in information about the process of creating the dataset, and take a moment to reflect on its social impact and possible limitations if you haven't already done so in the dataset paper or in another data statement.\n\nIf you are a **user of a dataset**, the main source of information should be the dataset paper if it is available: we recommend pulling information from there into the relevant paragraphs of the template. We also eagerly welcome discussions on the [Considerations for Using the Data](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/blob/main/templates/README_guide.md#considerations-for-using-the-data) based on existing scholarship or personal experience that would benefit the whole community.\n\nFinally, if you want more information on the how and why of dataset cards, we strongly recommend reading the foundational works [Datasheets for Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09010) and [Data Statements for NLP](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/Q18-1041/).\n\nThank you for your contribution!\n\n## Code of conduct\n\nThis project adheres to the HuggingFace [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\nBy participating, you are expected to abide by this code.\n"

With a simple command like `squad_dataset = load_dataset(\"squad\")`, get any of these datasets ready to use in a dataloader for training/evaluating a ML model (Numpy/Pandas/PyTorch/TensorFlow/JAX),\n- **efficient data pre-processing**: simple, fast and reproducible data pre-processing for the public datasets as well as your own local datasets in CSV, JSON, text, PNG, JPEG, WAV, MP3, Parquet, etc. With simple commands like `processed_dataset = dataset.map(process_example)`, efficiently prepare the dataset for inspection and ML model evaluation and training.\n\n[🎓 **Documentation**](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/) [🔎 **Find a dataset in the Hub**](https://huggingface.co/datasets) [🌟 **Share a dataset on the Hub**](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/share)\n\n<h3 align=\"center\">\n    <a href=\"https://hf.co/course\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huggingface/datasets/main/docs/source/imgs/course_banner.png\"></a>\n</h3>\n\n🤗 Datasets is designed to let the community easily add and share new datasets.\n\n🤗 Datasets has many additional interesting features:\n\n- Thrive on large datasets: 🤗 Datasets naturally frees the user from RAM memory limitation, all datasets are memory-mapped using an efficient zero-serialization cost backend (Apache Arrow).\n- Smart caching: never wait for your data to process several times.\n- Lightweight and fast with a transparent and pythonic API (multi-processing/caching/memory-mapping).\n- Built-in interoperability with NumPy, pandas, PyTorch, TensorFlow 2 and JAX.\n- Native support for audio and image data.\n- Enable streaming mode to save disk space and start iterating over the dataset immediately.\n\n🤗 Datasets originated from a fork of the awesome [TensorFlow Datasets](https://github.com/tensorflow/datasets) and the HuggingFace team want to deeply thank the TensorFlow Datasets team for building this amazing library. More details on the differences between 🤗 Datasets and `tfds` can be found in the section [Main differences between 🤗 Datasets and `tfds`](#main-differences-between--datasets-and-tfds).\n\n# Installation\n\n## With pip\n\n🤗 Datasets can be installed from PyPi and has to be installed in a virtual environment (venv or conda for instance)\n\n```bash\npip install datasets\n```\n\n## With conda\n\n🤗 Datasets can be installed using conda as follows:\n\n```bash\nconda install -c huggingface -c conda-forge datasets\n```\n\nFollow the installation pages of TensorFlow and PyTorch to see how to install them with conda.\n\nFor more details on installation, check the installation page in the documentation: https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/installation\n\n## Installation to use with PyTorch/TensorFlow/pandas\n\nIf you plan to use 🤗 Datasets with PyTorch (1.0+), TensorFlow (2.2+) or pandas, you should also install PyTorch, TensorFlow or pandas.\n\nFor more details on using the library with NumPy, pandas, PyTorch or TensorFlow, check the quick start page in the documentation: https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/quickstart\n\n# Usage\n\n🤗 Datasets is made to be very simple to use - the API is centered around a single function, `datasets.load_dataset(dataset_name, **kwargs)`, that instantiates a dataset.\n\nThis library can be used for text/image/audio/etc. datasets. Here is an example to load a text dataset:\n\nHere is a quick example:\n\n```python\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\n\n# Print all the available datasets\nfrom huggingface_hub import list_datasets\nprint([dataset.id for dataset in list_datasets()])\n\n# Load a dataset and print the first example in the training set\nsquad_dataset = load_dataset('squad')\nprint(squad_dataset['train'][0])\n\n# Process the dataset - add a column with the length of the context texts\ndataset_with_length = squad_dataset.map(lambda x: {\"length\": len(x[\"context\"])})\n\n# Process the dataset - tokenize the context texts (using a tokenizer from the 🤗 Transformers library)\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-cased')\n\ntokenized_dataset = squad_dataset.map(lambda x: tokenizer(x['context']), batched=True)\n```\n\nIf your dataset is bigger than your disk or if you don't want to wait to download the data, you can use streaming:\n\n```python\n# If you want to use the dataset immediately and efficiently stream the data as you iterate over the dataset\nimage_dataset = load_dataset('cifar100', streaming=True)\nfor example in image_dataset[\"train\"]:\n    break\n```\n\nFor more details on using the library, check the quick start page in the documentation: https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/quickstart and the specific pages on:\n\n- Loading a dataset: https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/loading\n- What's in a Dataset: https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/access\n- Processing data with 🤗 Datasets: https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/process\n    - Processing audio data: https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/audio_process\n    - Processing image data: https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/image_process\n    - Processing text data: https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/nlp_process\n- Streaming a dataset: https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/stream\n- Writing your own dataset loading script: https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/dataset_script\n- etc.\n\n# Add a new dataset to the Hub\n\nWe have a very detailed step-by-step guide to add a new dataset to the ![number of datasets](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://huggingface.co/api/shields/datasets&color=brightgreen) datasets already provided on the [HuggingFace Datasets Hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets).\n\nYou can find:\n- [how to upload a dataset to the Hub using your web browser or Python](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/upload_dataset) and also\n- [how to upload it using Git](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/share).\n\n# Main differences between 🤗 Datasets and `tfds`\n\nIf you are familiar with the great TensorFlow Datasets, here are the main differences between 🤗 Datasets and `tfds`:\n\n- the scripts in 🤗 Datasets are not provided within the library but are queried, downloaded/cached and dynamically loaded upon request\n- the backend serialization of 🤗 Datasets is based on [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) instead of TF Records and leverage python dataclasses for info and features with some diverging features (we mostly don't do encoding and store the raw data as much as possible in the backend serialization cache).\n- the user-facing dataset object of 🤗 Datasets is not a `tf.data.Dataset` but a built-in framework-agnostic dataset class with methods inspired by what we like in `tf.data` (like a `map()` method). It basically wraps a memory-mapped Arrow table cache.\n\n# Disclaimers\n\n🤗 Datasets may run Python code defined by the dataset authors to parse certain data formats or structures. For security reasons, we ask users to:\n- check the dataset scripts they're going to run beforehand and\n- pin the `revision` of the repositories they use.\n\nIf you're a dataset owner and wish to update any part of it (description, citation, license, etc.), or do not want your dataset to be included in the Hugging Face Hub, please get in touch by opening a discussion or a pull request in the Community tab of the dataset page.

Prerequisites:\n   - Dependencies:\n     - twine: `pip install twine`\n   - Create an account in (and join the 'datasets' project):\n     - PyPI: https://pypi.org/\n     - Test PyPI: https://test.pypi.org/\n   - Don't break `transformers`: run the `transformers` CI using the `main` branch and make sure it's green.\n     - In `transformers`, use `datasets @ git+https://github.com/huggingface/datasets@main#egg=datasets`\n       Add a step to install `datasets@main` after `save_cache` in .circleci/create_circleci_config.py:\n       ```\n       steps.append({\"run\": {\"name\": \"Install `datasets@main`\", \"command\": 'pip uninstall datasets -y && pip install \"datasets @ git+https://github.com/huggingface/datasets@main#egg=datasets\"'}})\n       ```\n     - and then run the CI\n\n1. Create the release branch from main branch:\n     ```\n     git checkout main\n     git pull upstream main\n     git checkout -b release-VERSION\n     ```\n\n2. Change the version to the release VERSION in:\n   - __init__.py\n   - setup.py\n\n3. Commit these changes, push and create a Pull Request:\n     ```\n     git add -u\n     git commit -m \"Release: VERSION\"\n     git push upstream release-VERSION\n     ```\n   - Go to: https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/pull/new/release-VERSION\n   - Create pull request\n\n4. From your local release branch, build both the sources and the wheel. Do not change anything in setup.py between\n   creating the wheel and the source distribution (obviously).\n   - First, delete any building directories that may exist from previous builds:\n     - build\n     - dist\n   - From the top level directory, build the wheel and the sources:\n       ```\n       python setup.py bdist_wheel\n       python setup.py sdist\n       ```\n   - You should now have a /dist directory with both .whl and .tar.gz source versions.\n\n5. Check that everything looks correct by uploading the package to the test PyPI server:\n     ```\n     twine upload dist/* -r testpypi\n     ```\n   Check that you can install it in a virtualenv/notebook by running:\n     ```\n     pip install huggingface-hub fsspec aiohttp\n     pip install -U tqdm pyarrow\n     pip install -i https://testpypi.python.org/pypi datasets\n     ```\n\n6. Upload the final version to the actual PyPI:\n     ```\n     twine upload dist/* -r pypi\n     ```\n\n7. Make the release on GitHub once everything is looking hunky-dory:\n   - Merge the release Pull Request\n   - Create a new release: https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/releases/new\n   - Choose a tag: Introduce the new VERSION as tag, that will be created when you publish the release\n     - Create new tag VERSION on publish\n   - Release title: Introduce the new VERSION as well\n   - Describe the release\n     - Use \"Generate release notes\" button for automatic generation\n   - Publish release\n\n8. Set the dev version\n   - Create the dev-version branch from the main branch:\n       ```\n       git checkout main\n       git pull upstream main\n       git branch -D dev-version\n       git checkout -b dev-version\n       ```\n   - Change the version to X.X.X+1.dev0 (e.g. VERSION=1.18.3 -> 1.18.4.dev0) in:\n     - __init__.py\n     - setup.py\n   - Commit these changes, push and create a Pull Request:\n       ```\n       git add -u\n       git commit -m \"Set dev version\"\n       git push upstream dev-version\n       ```\n     - Go to: https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/pull/new/dev-version\n     - Create pull request\n   - Merge the dev version Pull Request\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom setuptools import find_packages, setup\n\n\nREQUIRED_PKGS = [\n    # For file locking\n    \"filelock\",\n    # We use numpy>=1.17 to have np.random.Generator (Dataset shuffling)\n    \"numpy>=1.17\",\n    # Backend and serialization.\n    # Minimum 15.0.0 to be able to cast dictionary types to their underlying types\n    \"pyarrow>=15.0.0\",\n    # For smart caching dataset processing\n    \"dill>=0.3.0,<0.3.9\",  # tmp pin until dill has official support for determinism see https://github.com/uqfoundation/dill/issues/19\n    # For performance gains with apache arrow\n    \"pandas\",\n    # for downloading datasets over HTTPS\n    \"requests>=2.32.2\",\n    # progress bars in download and scripts\n    \"tqdm>=4.66.3\",\n    # for fast hashing\n    \"xxhash\",\n    # for better multiprocessing\n    \"multiprocess<0.70.17\",  # to align with dill<0.3.9 (see above)\n    # to save datasets locally or on any filesystem\n    # minimum 2023.1.0 to support protocol=kwargs in fsspec's `open`, `get_fs_token_paths`, etc.: see https://github.com/fsspec/filesystem_spec/pull/1143\n    \"fsspec[http]>=2023.1.0,<=2024.12.0\",\n    # for data streaming via http\n    \"aiohttp\",\n    # To get datasets from the Datasets Hub on huggingface.co\n    \"huggingface-hub>=0.24.0\",\n    # Utilities from PyPA to e.g., compare versions\n    \"packaging\",\n    # To parse YAML metadata from dataset cards\n    \"pyyaml>=5.1\",\n]\n\nAUDIO_REQUIRE = [\n    \"soundfile>=0.12.1\",\n    \"librosa\",\n    \"soxr>=0.4.0;
