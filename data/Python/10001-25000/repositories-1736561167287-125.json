Distribution Obligations.\n\n3.1 Application of License.\n\nThe Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by\nthe terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source\nCode version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this\nLicense or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You\nmust include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You\ndistribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version\nthat alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the\nrecipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document\noffering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.\n\n3.2 Availability of Source Code.\n\nAny Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made\navailable in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same\nmedia as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution\nMechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if\nmade available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for\nat least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at\nleast six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification\nhas been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring\nthat the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic\nDistribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\n\n3.3 Description of Modifications.\n\nYou must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file\ndocumenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any\nchange. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived,\ndirectly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and\nincluding the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in\nany notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You\ndescribe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\n\n3.4 Intellectual Property Matters\n\n(a) Third Party Claims.\n\nIf Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual\nproperty rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor\nunder Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source\nCode distribution titled \"LEGAL\" which describes the claim and the party making\nthe claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If\nContributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as\ndescribed in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in\nall copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps\n(such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably\ncalculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has\nbeen obtained.\n\n(b) Contributor APIs.\n\nIf Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and\nContributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to\nimplement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL\nfile.\n\n(c) Representations.\n\nContributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a)\nabove, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's\noriginal creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the\nrights conveyed by this License.\n\n3.5 Required Notices.\n\nYou must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If\nit is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to\nits structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a\nrelevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If\nYou created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor\nto the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in\nany documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or\nownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to\ncharge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one\nor more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own\nbehalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must\nmake it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability\nobligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the\nInitial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the\nInitial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n3.6 Distribution of Executable Versions.\n\nYou may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of\nSection 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice\nstating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the\nterms of this License, including a description of how and where You have\nfulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously\nincluded in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or\ncollateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered\nCode. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership\nrights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from\nthis License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License\nand that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or\nalter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set\nforth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a\ndifferent license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ\nfrom this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer,\nOriginal Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial\nDeveloper, Original Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred\nby the Initial Developer, Original Developer or such Contributor as a result of\nany such terms You offer.\n\n3.7 Larger Works.\n\nYou may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not\ngoverned by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single\nproduct. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are\nfulfilled for the Covered Code.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\n\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with\nrespect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or\nregulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the\nmaximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they\naffect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section\n3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to\nthe extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\nsufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand\nit.\n\n5. Application of this License.\n\nThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the\nnotice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\n\n6. Versions of the License.\n\n6.1 New Versions.\n\nreddit Inc. (\"reddit\") may publish revised and/or new versions of the\nLicense from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version\nnumber.\n\n6.2 Effect of New Versions.\n\nOnce Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License,\nYou may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also\nchoose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the\nLicense published by reddit. No one other than reddit has the right to\nmodify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\n\n6.3 Derivative Works.\n\nIf You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do\nin order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this\nLicense), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases \"reddit\",\n\"CPAL\" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except\nto note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it\nclear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the\nCPAL. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Developer,\nOriginal Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of\nthemselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\n\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\nCOVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT\nWARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT\nLIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE,\nFIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE\nQUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE\nPROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ORIGINAL\nDEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART\nOF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER\nTHIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n8. TERMINATION.\n\n8.1 This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically\n  if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30\n  days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code\n  which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this\n  License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the\n  termination of this License shall survive.\n\n8.2 If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim\n  (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer, Original\n  Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer, Original Developer or\n  Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as \"Participant\")\n  alleging that:\n\n(a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any\npatent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under\nSections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from\nParticipant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of\nnotice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable\nreasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such\nParticipant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the\nContributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a\nreasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in\nwriting by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights\ngranted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically\nterminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.\n\n(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor\nVersion, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to\nYou by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective\nas of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made,\nModifications made by that Participant.\n\n8.3 If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that\n  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any\n  patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior\n  to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value\n  of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be\n  taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or\n  license.\n\n8.4 In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user\n  license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been\n  validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall\n  survive termination.\n\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING\nNEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ORIGINAL\nDEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY\nSUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT,\nSPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING,\nWITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER\nFAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN\nIF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS\nLIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL\nINJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW\nPROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR\nLIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND\nLIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\nThe Covered Code is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is defined in 48\nC.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial computer software\" and\n\"commercial computer software documentation,\" as such terms are used in 48\nC.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48\nC.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users\nacquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.\n\n11. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter\nhereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such\nprovision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it\nenforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except\nto the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its\nconflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party\nis a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the\nUnited States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be\nsubject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of\nCalifornia, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing\nparty responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and\nreasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations\nConvention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly\nexcluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract\nshall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\n\n12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n\nAs between Initial Developer, Original Developer and the Contributors, each\nparty is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out\nof its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with\nInitial Developer, Original Developer and Contributors to distribute such\nresponsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be\ndeemed to constitute any admission of liability.\n\n13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.\n\nInitial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as\nMultiple-Licensed. Multiple-Licensed means that the Initial Developer permits\nyou to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the CPAL or the\nalternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file\ndescribed in Exhibit A.\n\n14. ADDITIONAL TERM: ATTRIBUTION\n\n(a) As a modest attribution to the organizer of the development of the Original\nCode (\"Original Developer\"), in the hope that its promotional value may help\njustify the time, money and effort invested in writing the Original Code, the\nOriginal Developer may include in Exhibit B (\"Attribution Information\") a\nrequirement that each time an Executable and Source Code or a Larger Work is\nlaunched or initially run (which includes initiating a session), a prominent\ndisplay of the Original Developer's Attribution Information (as defined below)\nmust occur on the graphic user interface employed by the end user to access such\nCovered Code (which may include display on a splash screen), if any. The size of\nthe graphic image should be consistent with the size of the other elements of\nthe Attribution Information. If the access by the end user to the Executable and\nSource Code does not create a graphic user interface for access to the Covered\nCode, this obligation shall not apply. If the Original Code displays such\nAttribution Information in a particular form (such as in the form of a splash\nscreen, notice at login, an \"about\" display, or dedicated attribution area on\nuser interface screens), continued use of such form for that Attribution\nInformation is one way of meeting this requirement for notice.\n\n(b) Attribution information may only include a copyright notice, a brief phrase,\ngraphic image and a URL (\"Attribution Information\") and is subject to the\nAttribution Limits as defined below. For these purposes, prominent shall mean\ndisplay for sufficient duration to give reasonable notice to the user of the\nidentity of the Original Developer and that if You include Attribution\nInformation or similar information for other parties, You must ensure that the\nAttribution Information for the Original Developer shall be no less prominent\nthan such Attribution Information or similar information for the other\nparty. For greater certainty, the Original Developer may choose to specify in\nExhibit B below that the above attribution requirement only applies to an\nExecutable and Source Code resulting from the Original Code or any Modification,\nbut not a Larger Work. The intent is to provide for reasonably modest\nattribution, therefore the Original Developer cannot require that You display,\nat any time, more than the following information as Attribution Information: (a)\na copyright notice including the name of the Original Developer; (b) a word or\none phrase (not exceeding 10 words); (c) one graphic image provided by the\nOriginal Developer; and (d) a URL (collectively, the \"Attribution Limits\").\n\n(c) If Exhibit B does not include any Attribution Information, then there are no\nrequirements for You to display any Attribution Information of the Original\nDeveloper.\n\n(d) You acknowledge that all trademarks, service marks and/or trade names\ncontained within the Attribution Information distributed with the Covered Code\nare the exclusive property of their owners and may only be used with the\npermission of their owners, or under circumstances otherwise permitted by law or\nas expressly set out in this License.\n\n15. ADDITIONAL TERM: NETWORK USE.\n\nThe term \"External Deployment\" means the use, distribution, or communication of\nthe Original Code or Modifications in any way such that the Original Code or\nModifications may be used by anyone other than You, whether those works are\ndistributed or communicated to those persons or made available as an application\nintended for use over a network. As an express condition for the grants of\nlicense hereunder, You must treat any External Deployment by You of the Original\nCode or Modifications as a distribution under section 3.1 and make Source Code\navailable under Section 3.2.\n\nEXHIBIT A. Common Public Attribution License Version 1.0.\n\n\"The contents of this file are subject to the Common Public Attribution License\nVersion 1.0.
