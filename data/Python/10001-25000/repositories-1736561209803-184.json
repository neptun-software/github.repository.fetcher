Click on the \"Plugins\" button.  Next, click on the button, \"Load plugin from file\".  Navigate to the unzipped DeDRM_tools folder, find the file \"DeDRM_plugin.zip\".  Click to select the file and select \"Open\".  Click \"Yes\" in the \"Are you sure?\" dialog box. Click the \"OK\" button in the \"Success\" dialog box.\n\n\nCustomization\n-------------\nFor Kindle ebooks from an E-Ink based Kindle (e.g. Voyage), or books downloaded from the Amazon web site 'for transfer via USB' to an E-Ink base Kindle, you must enter the Kindle's serial number in the customisation dialog.\n\nWhen you have finished entering your configuration information, you must click the OK button to save it. If you click the Cancel button, all your changes in all the configuration dialogs will be lost.\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n---------------\nIf you find that the DeDRM plugin is not working for you (imported ebooks still have DRM - that is, they won't convert or open in the calibre ebook viewer), you should make a log of the import process by deleting the DRMed ebook from calibre and then adding the ebook to calibre when it's running in debug mode. This will generate a lot of helpful debugging info that can be copied into any online help requests. Here's how to do it:\n\n - Remove the DRMed book from calibre.\n - Click the Preferences drop-down menu and choose 'Restart in debug mode'.\n - Once calibre has re-started, import the problem ebook.\n - Now close calibre.\n\nA log will appear that you can copy and paste into a comment at Apprentice Alf's blog, http://apprenticealf.wordpress.com/ or an issue at Apprentice Harper's repository, https://github.com/apprenticeharper/DeDRM_tools/issues . You should also give details of your computer, and how you obtained the ebook file.\n"

          "content": "# Overview\n## What's this repository all about?\nProviding free open source tools to remove DRM from your ebooks.\n\n## What's DRM?\nDRM (\"Digital Rights Management\") is a way of using encryption to tie the books you've bought to a specific device or to a particular piece of software.\n\n## Why would I want to remove DRM from my ebooks?\nWhen your ebooks have DRM you are unable to convert the ebook from one format to another (e.g. Kindle KF8 to Kobo ePub), so you are restricted in the range of ebook stores you can use. DRM also allows publishers to restrict what you can do with the ebook you've bought, e.g. preventing the use of text-to-speech software. Longer term, you can never be sure that you'll be able to come back and re-read your ebooks if they have DRM, even if you save back-up copies.\n\n## So how can I remove DRM from my ebooks?\nJust download and use these tools, that's all! Uh, almost. There are a few, uh, provisos, a, a couple of quid pro quos. \n\n* The tools don't work on all ebooks. For example, they don't work on any ebooks from Apple's iBooks store.\n* You must own the ebook - the tools won't work on library ebooks or rented ebooks or books from a friend.\n* You must not use these tools to give your ebooks to a hundred of your closest friends. Or to a million strangers. Authors need to sell books to be able to write more books. Don't be mean to the authors.\n* Do NOT use Adobe Digital Editions 3.0 or later to download your ePubs. ADE 3.0 and later might use a new encryption scheme that the tools can't handle. While major ebook stores aren't using the new scheme yet, using ADE 2.0.1 will ensure that your ebooks are downloaded using the old scheme. Once a book has been downloaded with the new scheme, it's IMPOSSIBLE to re-download using the old scheme (without buying it again).\n\nBut otherwise, if your ebook is from Amazon, Kobo, Barnes & Noble or any of the ebook stores selling ebooks compatible with Adobe Digital Editions 2.0.1, you should be able to remove the DRM that's been applied to your ebooks.\n\n### Recent Changes to Kindle for PC/Kindle for Mac\nStarting with version 1.19, Kindle for PC/Mac uses Amazon's new KFX format which isn't quite as good a source for conversion to ePub as the older KF8 (& MOBI) formats. There are two options to get the older formats. Either stick with version 1.17 or earlier, or modify the executable by changing a file name (PC) or disabling a component of the application (Mac). \n\nVersion 1.17 of Kindle is no longer available directly from Amazon, so you will need to search for the proper file name and find it on a third party site. The name is `KindleForPC-installer-1.17.44170.exe` for PC and `KindleForMac-44182.dmg` for Mac.\nVerify the one of the following cryptographic hash values, using software of your choice, before installing the downloaded file in order to avoid viruses. If the hash does not match, delete the downloaded file and try again from another site.\n\n#### Kindle for PC `KindleForPC-installer-1.17.44170.exe`:\n* MD-5: 53F793B562F4823721AA47D7DE099869\n* SHA-1: 73C404D719F0DD8D4AE1C2C96612B095D6C86255\n* SHA-256: 14E0F0053F1276C0C7C446892DC170344F707FBFE99B6951762C120144163200\n\n#### Kindle for Mac `KindleForMac-44182.dmg`:\n* MD-5: E7E36D5369E1F3CF1D28E5D9115DF15F\n* SHA-1: 7AB9A86B954CB23D622BD79E3257F8E2182D791C\n* SHA-256: 28DC21246A9C7CDEDD2D6F0F4082E6BF7EF9DB9CE9D485548E8A9E1D19EAE2AC\n\nYou will need to go to the preferences and uncheck the auto update checkbox. Then download and install 1.17 over the top of the newer installation. You'll also need to delete the KFX folders from your My Kindle Content folder. You may also need to take further action to prevent an auto update. The simplest wayis to find the 'updates' folder and replace it with a file. See [this thread] (http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=283371) at MobileRead for a Script to do this on a PC. On a Mac you can find the folder at ~/Library/Application Support/Kindle/ just delete the folder 'updates' and save a blank text file called 'updates' in its place.\n\nAnother possible solution is to use 1.19 or later, but disable KFX by renaming or disabling a necessary component of the application. This may or may not work on versions after 1.25. In a command window, enter the following commands when Kindle for PC/Mac is not running:\n\n#### Windows\n`ren %localappdata%\\Amazon\\Kindle\\application\\renderer-test.exe renderer-test.xxx`\n\nPC Note: The renderer-test program may be in a different location in some Kindle for PC installations. If the rename command fails look in other folders, such as `C:\\Program Files\\Amazon\\Kindle`.\n\n#### Macintosh\n`chmod -x /Applications/Kindle.app/Contents/MacOS/renderer-test`\n\nMac Note: If the chmod command fails with a permission error try again using `sudo` before `chmod` - `sudo chmod` [...]\n\nAfter restarting the Kindle program any books previously downloaded in KFX format will no longer open. You will need to remove them from your device and re-download them. All future downloads will use the older Kindle formats instead of KFX although they will continue to be placed in one individual subdirectory per book. Note that books soudl be downoad by right-click and 'Download', not by just opening the book. Recent (1.25+) versions of Kindle for Mac/PC may convert KF8 files to a new format that is not supported by these tools when the book is opened for reading.\n\n#### Decrypting KFX\nThanks to work by several people, the tools can now decrypt KFX format ebooks from Kindle for Mac/PC. In addition to the DeDRM plugin, calibre users will also need to install jhowell's KFX Input plugin which is available through the standard plugin menu in calibre, or directly from [his plugin thread](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=291290) on Mobileread. \n\nIt's quite possible that Amazon will update their KFX DeDRM to prevent DRM removal from KFX books again. So Remove DRM as soon as possible!\n\n#### Thanks\nThanks to jhowell for his investigations into KFX format and the KFX Input plugin. Some of these instructions are from [his thread on the subject](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=283371) at MobileRead.\n\n## Where can I get the latest version of these free DRM removal tools?\nRight here at github. Just go to the [releases page](https://github.com/apprenticeharper/DeDRM_tools/releases) and download the latest zip archive of the tools, named `DeDRM\\_tools\\_X.X.X.zip`, where X.X.X is the version number. You do not need to download the source code archive.\n\n## I've downloaded the tools archive. Now what?\nFirst, unzip the archive. You should now have a DeDRM folder containing several other folders and a `ReadMe_Overview.txt` file. Please read the `ReadMe_Overview.txt` file! That will explain what the folders are, and you'll be able to work out which of the tools you need.\n\n## That's a big complicated ReadMe file! Isn't there a quick guide?\nInstall calibre. Install the DeDRM\\_plugin in calibre. Install the Obok\\_plugin in calibre. Restart calibre. In the DeDRM_plugin customisation dialog add in any E-Ink Kindle serial numbers. Remember that the plugin only tries to remove DRM when ebooks are imported.\n\n# Installing the Tools\n## The calibre plugin\n### I am trying to install the calibre plugin, but calibre says \"ERROR: Unhandled exception: InvalidPlugin: The plugin in u’[path]DeDRM\\_tools\\_6.5.3.zip’ is invalid. It does not contain a top-level \\_\\_init\\_\\_.py file\"\nYou are trying to add the tools archive (e.g. `DeDRM_tools_6.8.0.zip`) instead of the plugin. The tools archive is not the plugin. It is a collection of DRM removal tools which includes the plugin. You must unzip the archive, and install the calibre plugin `DeDRM_plugin.zip` from a folder called `DeDRM_calibre_plugin` in the unzipped archive.\n\n### I’ve unzipped the tools archive, but I can’t find the calibre plugin when I try to add them to calibre. I use Windows.\nYou should select the zip file that is in the `DeDRM_calibre_plugin` folder, not any files inside the plugin’s zip archive. Make sure you are selecting from the folder that you created when you unzipped the tools archive and not selecting a file inside the still-zipped tools archive.\n\n(The problem is that Windows will allow apps to browse inside zip archives without needing to unzip them first. If there are zip archives inside the main zip archives, Windows will show them as unzipped as well. So what happens is people will unzip the `DeDRM_tools_X.X.X.zip` to a folder, but when using calibre they will actually navigate to the still zipped file by mistake and cannot tell they have done so because they do not have file extensions showing. So to the unwary Windows user, it appears that the zip archive was unzipped and that everything inside it was unzipped as well so there is no way to install the plugins.\n\nWe strongly recommend renaming the `DeDRM_tools_X.X.X.zip` archive (after extracting its contents) to `DeDRM_tools_X.X.X_archive.zip`. If you do that, you are less likely to navigate to the wrong location from inside calibre.)\n\n# Using the Tools\n## I can’t get the tools to work on my rented or library ebooks.\nThe tools are not designed to remove DRM from rented or library ebooks.\n\n## I've unzipped the tools, but what are all the different files, and how do I use them?\nRead the `ReadMe_Overview.txt` file and then the ReadMe files for the tools you're interested in. That's what they're for.\n\n## I have installed the calibre plugin, but my books still have DRM. When I try to view or convert my books, calibre says they have DRM.\nDRM only gets removed when an ebook is imported into calibre. Also, if the book is already in calibre, by default calibre will discard the newly imported file. You can change this in calibre's Adding books preferences page (Automerge..../Overwrite....), so that newly imported files overwrite existing ebook formats. Then just re-import your books and the DRM-free versions will overwrite the DRMed versions while retaining your books' metadata.\n\n## I have installed the calibre plugin, but I don’t know where my ebooks are stored.\nYour ebooks are stored on your computer or on your ebook reader. You need to find them to be able to remove the DRM. If they are on your reader, you should be able to locate them easily. On your computer it’s not so obvious. Here are the default locations.\n\n### Macintosh\nNavigating from your home folder,\n\nKindle for Mac ebooks are in either `Library/Application Support/Kindle/My Kindle Content` or `Documents/My Kindle Content or Library/Containers/com.amazon.Kindle/Data/Library/Application Support/Kindle/My Kindle Content`, depending on your version of Kindle for Mac.\n\nAdobe Digital Editions ebooks are in `Documents/Digital Editions`\n\n### Windows\nNavigating from your `Documents` folder (`My Documents` folder, pre-Windows 7)\n\nKindle for PC ebooks are in `My Kindle Content`\n\nAdobe Digital Editions ebooks are in `My Digital Editions`\n\n\n## I have installed the calibre plugin, and the book is not already in calibre, but the DRM does not get removed.\nYou must use the exact file that is used by your ebook reading software or hardware. See the previous question on where to find your ebook files. Do not use an old copy you have that you can no longer read.\nIf you cannot read the ebook on your current device or installed software, the tools will certainly not be able to remove the DRM. Download a fresh copy that does work with your current device or installed software.\n\n## I have installed the calibre plugin, and the book is not already in calibre, but the DRM does not get removed. It is a Kindle book.\nIf you are on Windows 8 and using the Windows 8 AppStore Kindle app, you must download and install the Kindle for PC application directly from the Amazon website. The tools do not work with the Windows 8 AppStore Kindle app.\n\nIf this book is from an eInk Kindle (e.g. Paperwhite), you must enter the serial number into the configuration dialog. The serial number is sixteen characters long, and is case-sensitive.\n\nIf this book is from Kindle for Mac or Kindle for PC, you must have the Kindle Software installed on the same computer and user account as your copy of calibre.\n\nIf the book is from Kindle for PC or Kindle for Mac and you think you are doing everything right, and you are getting this message, it is possible that the files containing the encryption key aren’t quite in the format the tools expect. To try to fix this:\n\n1. Deregister Kindle for PC(Mac) from your Amazon account.\n1. Uninstall Kindle for PC(Mac)\n1. Delete the Kindle for PC(Mac) preferences\n    * PC: Delete the directory `[home folder]\\AppData\\Local\\Amazon` (it might be hidden) and `[home folder]\\My Documents\\My Kindle Content`\n    * Mac: Delete the directory `[home folder]/Library/Application Support/Kindle/` and/or `[home folder]/Library/Containers/com.amazon.Kindle/Data/Library/Application Support/Kindle/` (one or both may be present and should be deleted)\n1. Reinstall Kindle for PC(Mac) version 1.17 or earlier (see above for download links).\n1. Re-register Kindle for PC(Mac) with your Amazon account\n1. Download the ebook again. Do not use the files you have downloaded previously.\n\n## Some of my books had their DRM removed, but some still say that they have DRM and will not convert.\nThere are several possible reasons why only some books get their DRM removed.\n* You still don’t have the DRM removal tools working correctly, but some of your books didn’t have DRM in the first place.\n* Kindle only: It is a Topaz format book and contains some coding that the tools do not understand. You will need to get a log of the DeDRM attempt, and then create a [new issue at Apprentice Harper's github repository](https://github.com/apprenticeharper/DeDRM_tools/issues/), attaching the book and the log, so that the tools can be updated.\n\nIf you are still having problems with particular books, you will need to create a log of the DRM removal attempt for one of the problem books, and post that in a comment at Apprentice Alf's blog or in a new issue at Apprentice Harper's github repository.\n\n## My Kindle book has imported and the DRM has been removed, but all the pictures are gone.\nMost likely, this is a book downloaded from Amazon directly to an eInk Kindle (e.g. Paperwhite). Unfortunately, the pictures are probably in a `.azw6` file that the tools don't understand. You must download the book manually from Amazon's web site \"For transfer via USB\" to your Kindle. When you download the eBook in this manner, Amazon will package the pictures in the with text in a single file that the tools will be able to import successfully.\n\n## My Kindle book has imported, but it's showing up as an AZW4 format. Conversions take a long time and/or are very poor.\nYou have found a Print Replica Kindle ebook. This is a PDF in a Kindle wrapper. Now the DRM has been removed, you can extract the PDF from the wrapper using the KindleUnpack plugin. Conversion of PDFs rarely gives good results.\n\n## Do the tools work on books from Kobo?\nIf you use the Kobo desktop application for Mac or PC, install the Obok plugin. This will import and remove the DRM from your Kobo books, and is the easiest method for Kobo ebooks.\n\n## I registered Adobe Digital Editions 3.0 or later with an Adobe ID before downloading, but my epub or PDF still has DRM.\nAdobe introduced a new DRM scheme with ADE 3.0 and later. Install ADE 2.0.1 and register with the same Adobe ID. If you can't open your book in ADE 2.01, then you have a book with the new DRM scheme. These tools can't help. You can avoid the new DRM scheme by always downloading your ebooks with ADE 2.0.1. Some retailers will require ADE 3.0 or later, in which case you won't be able to download with ADE 2.0.1.\n\n## The DRM wasn't removed and the log says \"Failed to decrypt with error: Cannot decode library or rented ebooks.\" What now?\nYou're trying to remove the DRM from an ebook that's only on loan to you. No help will be given to remove DRM from such ebooks. If you think that you have received this message for a book you own, please create an issue at github, or comment at the blog.\n\n## I cannot solve my problem with the DeDRM plugin, and now I need to ‘post a log’. How do I do that?\nRemove the DRMed book from calibre. Click the Preferences drop-down menu and choose 'Restart in debug mode'. Once calibre has re-started, import the problem ebook. Now close calibre. A log will appear that you can copy and paste into a comment at Apprentice Alf's blog, or into a new issue at Apprentice Harper's github repository.\n\n## Is there a way to use the DeDRM plugin for Calibre from the command line?\nSee the [Calibre command line interface (CLI) instructions](CALIBRE_CLI_INSTRUCTIONS.md).\n\n# General Questions\n\n## Once the DRM has been removed, is there any trace of my personal identity left in the ebook?\nThe tools only remove the DRM. No attempt is made to remove any personally identifying information.\n\n## Why do some of my Kindle ebooks import as HTMLZ format in calibre?\nMost Amazon Kindle ebooks are Mobipocket format ebooks, or the new KF8 format. However, some are in a format known as Topaz. The Topaz format is only used by Amazon. A Topaz ebook is a collections of glyphs and their positions on each page tagged with some additional information from that page including OCRed text (Optical Character Recognition generated Text) to allow searching, and some additional layout information. Each page of a Topaz ebook is effectively a description of an image of that page. To convert a Topaz ebook to another format is not easy as there is not a one-to-one mapping between glyphs and characters/fonts. To account for this, two different formats are generated by the DRM removal software. The first is an html description built from the OCRtext and images stored in the Topaz file (HTMLZ). This format is easily reflowed but may suffer from typical OCRtext errors including typos, garbled text, missing italics, missing bolds, etc. The second format uses the glyph and position information to create an accurate scalable vector graphics (SVG) image of each page of the book that can be viewed in web browsers that support svg images (Safari, Firefox 4 or later, etc). Additional conversion software can be used to convert these SVG images to an image only PDF file. The DeDRM calibre plugin only imports the HTMLZ versions of the Topaz ebook. The html version can be manually cleaned up and spell checked and then converted using Sigil/calibre to epubs, mobi ebooks, and etc.\n\n## Are the tools open source? How can I be sure they are safe and not a trojan horse?\nAll the DRM removal tools hosted here are almost entirely scripts of one kind or another: Python, Applescript or Windows Batch files. So they are inherently open source, and open to inspection by everyone who downloads them.\n\nThere are some optional shared libraries (`*.dll`, `*.dylib`, and `*.so`) included for performance. The source for any compiled pieces are provided within `alfcrypto_src.zip`. If this is a concern either delete the binary files or manually rebuild them.\n\n## What ebooks do these tools work on?\nThe tools linked from this blog remove DRM from PDF, ePub, kePub (Kobo), eReader, Kindle (Mobipocket, KF8, Print Replica and Topaz) format ebooks using Adobe Adept, Barnes & Noble, Amazon, Kobo and eReader DRM schemes.\n\nNote these tools do NOT ‘crack’ the DRM. They simply allow the book’s owner to use the encryption key information already stored someplace on their computer or device to decrypt the ebook in the same manner the official ebook reading software uses.\n\n## Why don’t the tools work with Kindle Fire ebooks?\nBecause no-one's found out how to remove the DRM from ebooks from Kindle Fire devices yet. The workaround is to install Kindle for PC or Kindle for Mac and use books from there instead.\n\n## Why don't the tools work with Kindle for iOS ebooks?\nAmazon changed the way the key was generated for Kindle for iOS books, and the tools can no longer find the key. The workaround is to install Kindle for PC or Kindle for Mac and use books from there instead.\n\n## Why don't the tools work with Kindle for Android ebooks?\nAmazon turned off backup for Kindle for Android, so the tools can no longer find the key. The workaround is to install Kindle for PC or Kindle for Mac and use books from there instead.\n\n## Why don't the tools work on books from the Apple iBooks Store?\nApple regularly change the details of their DRM and so the tools in the main tools archive will not work with these ebooks. Apple’s Fairplay DRM scheme can be removed using Requiem if the appropriate version of iTunes can still be installed and used. See the post Apple and ebooks: iBookstore DRM and how to remove it at Apprentice Alf's blog for more details.\n\n## I’ve got the tools archive and I’ve read all the FAQs but I still can’t install the tools and/or the DRM removal doesn’t work\n* Read the `ReadMe_Overview.txt` file in the top level of the tools archive\n* Read the ReadMe file for the tool you want to use.\n* If you still can’t remove the DRM, ask in the comments section of Apprentice Alf's blog or create a new issue at Apprentice Harper's github repository, reporting the error as precisely as you can, what platform you use, what tool you have tried, what errors you get, and what versions you are using. If the problem happens when running one of the tools, post a log (see previous questions on how to do this).\n\n## Who wrote these scripts?\nThe authors tend to identify themselves only by pseudonyms:\n* The Adobe Adept and Barnes & Noble scripts were created by i♥cabbages\n* The Amazon Mobipocket and eReader scripts were created by The Dark Reverser\n* The Amazon K4PC DRM/format was further decoded by Bart Simpson aka Skindle\n* The Amazon K4 Mobi tool was created by by some_updates, mdlnx and others\n* The Amazon Topaz DRM removal script was created by CMBDTC\n* The Amazon Topaz format conversion was created by some_updates, clarknova, and Bart Simpson\n* The DeDRM all-in-one calibre plugin was created by Apprentice Alf\n* The support for .kinf2018 key files  and KFX 2&3 was by Apprentice Sakuya\n* The Scuolabooks tool was created by Hex\n* The Microsoft code was created by drs\n* The Apple DRM removal tool was created by Brahms\n\nSince the original versions of the scripts and programs were released, various people have helped to maintain and improve them.\n"

I shall be using noDRM's version of the tools from now on. \n\n[Guide] How to remove DRM\nRefer to [Wiki Page](https://github.com/apprenticeharper/DeDRM_tools/wiki/Exactly-how-to-remove-DRM)\n\n# DeDRM_tools\nDeDRM tools for ebooks\n\nThis is a repository that tracks all the scripts and other tools for removing DRM from ebooks that I could find, committed in date order as best as I could manage. (Except for the Requiem tools for Apple's iBooks, and Convert LIT for Microsoft's .lit ebooks.) This includes the tools from a time before Apprentice Alf had a blog, and continues through to when Apprentice Harper (with help) took over maintenance of the tools.\n\nThe individual scripts are now released as two plugins for calibre: DeDRM and Obok. \nThe DeDRM plugin handles books that use Amazon DRM, Adobe Digital Editions DRM (version 1), Barnes & Noble DRM, and some historical formats.\nThe Obok plugin handles Kobo DRM.\n\nUsers with calibre 5.x or later should use release 7.2.0 or later of the tools.\nUsers with calibe 4.x or earlier should use release 6.8.x of the tools.\n\nFor the latest Amazon KFX format, users of the calibre plugin should also install the KFX Input plugin from the standard calibre plugin menu. It's also available from the MobileRead thread here: https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=291290\n\nNote that Amazon changes the DRM for KFX files frequently. What works for KFX today might not work tomorrow.\n\nI welcome contributions from others to improve these tools, from expanding the range of books handled, improving key retrieval,  to just general bug fixes, speed improvements and UI enhancements.\n\nI urge people to read the FAQs. But to cover the most common: Use ADE 2.0.1 to be sure not to get the new DRM scheme that these tools can't handle. Do remember to unzip the downloaded archive to get the plugin (beta versions may be just the plugin  don't unzip that). You can't load the whole tools archive into calibre.\n\nMy special thanks to all those developers who have done the hard work of reverse engineering to provide the initial tools.\n\nApprentice Harper.\n"

This document is part of the DeDRM Tools archive from Apprentice Harper's github repository: https://github.com/apprenticeharper/DeDRM_tools/\n\nThis archive includes calibre plugins to remove DRM from:\n\n - Kindle ebooks (files from Kindle for Mac/PC and eInk Kindles).\n - Adobe Digital Editions (v2.0.1***) ePubs (including Kobo and Google ePubs downloaded to ADE)\n - Adobe Digital Editions (v2.0.1) PDFs\n - Kobo kePubs from the Kobo Desktop application and attached Kobo readers.\n\nThese tools do NOT work with Apple's iBooks FairPlay DRM. Use iBook Copy from TunesKit.\nThese tools no longer work well with books from Barnes & Noble.\n\nFor limitations and work-arounds, see the FAQ at https://github.com/apprenticeharper/DeDRM_tools/blob/master/FAQs.md\n\nAbout the tools\n---------------\nThese tools are updated and maintained by Apprentice Harper and many others. You can find the latest updates at Apprentice Harper's github repository https://github.com/apprenticeharper/DeDRM_tools/ and get support by creating an issue at the repository (github account required) or by posting a comment at Apprentice Alf's blog: http://www.apprenticealf.wordpress.com/\n\nIf you re-post these tools, a link to the repository and/or the blog would be appreciated.\n\nThe tools are provided in the form of plugins for calibre. Calibre is an open source freeware ebook library manager. It is the best tool around for keeping track of your ebooks.\n\n\nDeDRM plugin for calibre (Mac OS X, Windows)\n-------------------------------------------------------\ncalibe 5.x and later are now written in Python 3, and plugins must also use Python 3. If you have calibre 5, you must use version 7.x or later of the plugins. For calibre 4.x and earlier, use version 6.8.x of the plugins.\n\nThe DeDRM plugin for calibre removes DRM from your Kindle and Adobe DRM ebooks when they are imported to calibre. Just install the DeDRM plugin (DeDRM_plugin.zip), following the instructions and configuration directions provided in the ReadMe file and the help links in the plugin's configuration dialogs.\n\nOnce installed and configured, you can simply add a DRM book to calibre and a DRM-free version will be imported into the calibre database. Note that DRM removal only occurs on IMPORT not on CONVERSION or at any other time. If you have already imported DRMed books you'll need to remove the books from calibre and re-import them.\n\n\nObok plugin for calibre (Mac OS X and Windows)\n----------------------------------------------\nTo import ebooks from the Kobo Desktop app or from a Kobo ebook reader, install the Obok plugin. This works in a different way to the DeDRM plugin, in that it finds your ebooks downloaded using the Kobo Desktop app, or on an attached Kobo ebooks reader, and displays them in a list, so that you can choose the ones you want to import into calibre.\n\nFor instructions, see the obok_plugin_ReadMe.txt file.\n\n\nDeDRM application for Mac OS X users: (Mac OS X 10.6 and above)\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nDeDRM application for Windows users: (Windows XP through Windows 10)\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nAs of Version 6.7 of the tools, these are no longer provided or supported.\n\n\nLinux support\n-------------\nIt may be possible to use the plugins on a Linux system, but no support is given at this time.\n\n\nCredits\n-------\nThe original inept and ignoble scripts were by i♥cabbages\nThe original mobidedrm and erdr2pml scripts were by The Dark Reverser\nThe original topaz DRM removal script was by CMBDTC\nThe original topaz format conversion scripts were by some_updates, clarknova and Bart Simpson\nThe original KFX format decryption was by lulzkabulz, converted to python by Apprentice Naomi and integrated into the tools by tomthumb1997\nThe alfcrypto library is by some_updates\nThe DeDRM plugin was based on plugins by DiapDealer and is maintained by Apprentice Alf and Apprentice Harper\n\nThe original obok script was by Physisticated\nThe plugin conversion was done anonymously.\nThe Kobo reader support was added by norbusan\n\nFixes, updates and enhancements to the scripts and applicatons have been made by many other anonymous people.\n"

If both are available, ebooks will be read from the attached E-Ink Kobo reader. To import from the desktop application, unplug the Kobo reader.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\nOpen calibre's Preferences dialog.  Click on the \"Plugins\" button.  Next, click on the button, \"Load plugin from file\".  Navigate to the unzipped DeDRM_tools folder, find the file \"obok_plugin.zip\".  Click to select the file and select \"Open\".  Click \"Yes\" in the \"Are you sure?\" dialog box. Click the \"OK\" button in the \"Success\" dialog box.\n\n\nCustomization\n-------------\nNo customization is required, except choosing which menus will show the plugin. Although the ability to enter a device serial number is given, this should not need to be filled in, as the serial number should be picked up automatically from the attached Kobo reader.\n\n\nUsing the plugin\n----------------\n\nSelect the plugin's menu or icon from whichever part of the calibre interface you have chosen to have it. Follow the instructions in the dialog that appears.\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n---------------\nIf you find that the DeDRM plugin is not working for you (imported ebooks still have DRM - that is, they won't convert or open in the calibre ebook viewer), you should make a log of the import process by deleting the DRMed ebook from calibre and then adding the ebook to calibre when it's running in debug mode. This will generate a lot of helpful debugging info that can be copied into any online help requests. Here's how to do it:\n\n - Remove the DRMed book from calibre.\n - Click the Preferences drop-down menu and choose 'Restart in debug mode'.\n - Once calibre has re-started, import the problem ebook.\n - Now close calibre.\n\nA log will appear that you can copy and paste into a comment at Apprentice Alf's blog, http://apprenticealf.wordpress.com/ or an issue at Apprentice Harper's repository, https://github.com/apprenticeharper/DeDRM_tools/issues . You should also give details of your computer, and how you obtained the ebook file.\n\n"
