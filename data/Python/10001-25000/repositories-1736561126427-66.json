Some popular used models include:\n    - [runwayml/stable-diffusion-inpainting](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-inpainting)\n    - [diffusers/stable-diffusion-xl-1.0-inpainting-0.1](https://huggingface.co/diffusers/stable-diffusion-xl-1.0-inpainting-0.1)\n    - [andregn/Realistic_Vision_V3.0-inpainting](https://huggingface.co/andregn/Realistic_Vision_V3.0-inpainting)\n    - [Lykon/dreamshaper-8-inpainting](https://huggingface.co/Lykon/dreamshaper-8-inpainting)\n    - [Sanster/anything-4.0-inpainting](https://huggingface.co/Sanster/anything-4.0-inpainting)\n    - [BrushNet](https://www.iopaint.com/models/diffusion/brushnet)\n    - [PowerPaintV2](https://www.iopaint.com/models/diffusion/powerpaint_v2)\n    - [Sanster/AnyText](https://huggingface.co/Sanster/AnyText)\n    - [Fantasy-Studio/Paint-by-Example](https://huggingface.co/Fantasy-Studio/Paint-by-Example)\n\n- [Plugins](https://www.iopaint.com/plugins):\n  - [Segment Anything](https://iopaint.com/plugins/interactive_seg): Accurate and fast Interactive Object Segmentation\n  - [RemoveBG](https://iopaint.com/plugins/rembg): Remove image background or generate masks for foreground objects\n  - [Anime Segmentation](https://iopaint.com/plugins/anime_seg): Similar to RemoveBG, the model is specifically trained for anime images.\n  - [RealESRGAN](https://iopaint.com/plugins/RealESRGAN): Super Resolution\n  - [GFPGAN](https://iopaint.com/plugins/GFPGAN): Face Restoration\n  - [RestoreFormer](https://iopaint.com/plugins/RestoreFormer): Face Restoration\n- [FileManager](https://iopaint.com/file_manager): Browse your pictures conveniently and save them directly to the output directory.\n\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### Start webui\n\nIOPaint provides a convenient webui for using the latest AI models to edit your images.\nYou can install and start IOPaint easily by running following command:\n\n```bash\n# In order to use GPU, install cuda version of pytorch first.\n# pip3 install torch==2.1.2 torchvision==0.16.2 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118\n# AMD GPU users, please utilize the following command, only works on linux, as pytorch is not yet supported on Windows with ROCm.\n# pip3 install torch==2.1.2 torchvision==0.16.2 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm5.6\n\npip3 install iopaint\niopaint start --model=lama --device=cpu --port=8080\n```\n\nThat's it, you can start using IOPaint by visiting http://localhost:8080 in your web browser.\n\nAll models will be downloaded automatically at startup. If you want to change the download directory, you can add `--model-dir`. More documentation can be found [here](https://www.iopaint.com/install/download_model)\n\nYou can see other supported models at [here](https://www.iopaint.com/models) and how to use local sd ckpt/safetensors file at [here](https://www.iopaint.com/models#load-ckptsafetensors).\n\n### Plugins\n\nYou can specify which plugins to use when starting the service, and you can view the commands to enable plugins by using `iopaint start --help`. \n\nMore demonstrations of the Plugin can be seen [here](https://www.iopaint.com/plugins)\n\n```bash\niopaint start --enable-interactive-seg --interactive-seg-device=cuda\n```\n\n### Batch processing\n\nYou can also use IOPaint in the command line to batch process images:\n\n```bash\niopaint run --model=lama --device=cpu \\\n--image=/path/to/image_folder \\\n--mask=/path/to/mask_folder \\\n--output=output_dir\n```\n\n`--image` is the folder containing input images, `--mask` is the folder containing corresponding mask images.\nWhen `--mask` is a path to a mask file, all images will be processed using this mask.\n\nYou can see more information about the available models and plugins supported by IOPaint below.\n\n## Development\n\nInstall [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en), then install the frontend dependencies.\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/Sanster/IOPaint.git\ncd IOPaint/web_app\nnpm install\nnpm run build\ncp -r dist/ ../iopaint/web_app\n```\n\nCreate a `.env.local` file in `web_app` and fill in the backend IP and port.\n```\nVITE_BACKEND=http://127.0.0.1:8080\n```\n\nStart front-end development environment\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nInstall back-end requirements and start backend service\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\npython3 main.py start --model lama --port 8080\n```\n\nThen you can visit `http://localhost:5173/` for development.\nThe frontend code will automatically update after being modified,\nbut the backend needs to restart the service after modifying the python code.\n"
