          "content": "Please provide as much information as possible when reporting a bug or filing an issue on the Windows Subsystem for Linux.\n\n## Important: Reporting BSODs and Security issues\n**Do not open GitHub issues for Windows crashes (BSODs) or security issues.**. Instead, send Windows crashes or other security-related issues to secure@microsoft.com.\nSee the `10) Reporting a Windows crash (BSOD)` section below for detailed instructions.\n\n## Reporting issues in Windows Console or WSL text rendering/user experience\nNote that WSL distro's launch in the Windows Console (unless you have taken steps to launch a 3rd party console/terminal). Therefore, *please file UI/UX related issues in the [Windows Console issue tracker](https://github.com/microsoft/console)*.\n\n## Reporting issues in WSL\nA well written bug report will follow the following template:\n\n### 1) Issue Title\nA title succinctly describing the issue.\n\n#### Example:\n`Traceroute not working.`\n\n### 2) Windows version / build number\nYour Windows build number.  This can be gathered from the CMD prompt using the `cmd.exe --version` command.\n\n```cmd.exe\nC:\\ cmd.exe --version\nMicrosoft Windows [Version 10.0.21354.1]\n```\n\nNote: The Windows Insider builds contain many updates and fixes. If you are running on the Creators Update (10.0.15063) please check to see if your issue has been resolved in a later build.  If you are running on a Version below (10.0.14393), please try to update your Version.\n\n#### Example:\n\n`Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.21354.1]`\n\n### 3) Steps required to reproduce\n\nShould include all packages and environmental variables as well as other required configuration.\n\n#### Example: On linux \n\n`$ sudo apt-get install traceroute && traceroute www.microsoft.com`\n\n#### Example: On Windows\n\n``\n`$ cmd.exe` \n`CD C:\\Windows\\System32\\`\n`tracert.exe`\n``\n\n### 4) Copy of the terminal output\n\n#### Example:\n\n```\n$ traceroute www.microsoft.com\ntraceroute to www.microsoft.com (23.75.239.28), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets\nsetsockopt IP_MTU_DISCOVER: Invalid argument\n```\n\n### 5) Expected Behavior\n\nWhat was the expected result of the command?  Include examples / documentation if possible.\n\n### 6) Strace of the failing command\n\nRun the failing command under [strace](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/wily/man1/strace.1.html).  Normal command structure is:\n\n```\n$ strace -ff <command>\n```\n\n> Note: `strace` can produce lengthy output. If the generated trace is more than about 20 lines please paste this into a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) or another paste service and link in the bug.\n\n#### Example:\n\n```\n$ strace traceroute www.microsoft.com\nexecve(\"/usr/bin/traceroute\", [\"traceroute\", \"www.microsoft.com\"], [/* 22 vars */]) = 0\nbrk(0)                                  = 0x7fffdd3bc000\naccess(\"/etc/ld.so.nohwcap\", F_OK)      = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)\nmmap(NULL, 8192, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = 0x7f1f4e820000\naccess(\"/etc/ld.so.preload\", R_OK)      = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)\n...\n...\n...\n```\n\n### 7) Additional information\n\nSome bugs require additional information such as scripts to reproduce.  Please add to this section.\n\nIf there are files required, email the files to InsiderSupport@microsoft.com with:\n\n* **Subject**:  Forward to WSL Team - RE: github issue <issue #>\n* **Body**:  \"Please forward to WSL Team\" and include your attachment.\n\nCommon files are:\n\n* Memory dumps found under C:\\Windows\\MEMORY.DMP\n* Additional strace logs if the error occurs within a fork. The following\n  command generates an output file for every fork created:\n\n```\n$ strace -ff -o <outputfile> <command>\n```\n\n#### wsl --mount\n\nIf the issue is about wsl --mount, please include the output of running `wmic diskdrive get Availability,Capabilities,CapabilityDescriptions,DeviceID,InterfaceType,MediaLoaded,MediaType,Model,Name,Partitions` in an elevated command prompt.\n\nExample:\n\n```\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32>wmic diskdrive get Availability,Capabilities,CapabilityDescriptions,DeviceID,InterfaceType,MediaLoaded,MediaType,Model,Name,Partitions\nAvailability  Capabilities  CapabilityDescriptions                                       DeviceID            InterfaceType  MediaLoaded  MediaType              Model                       Name                Partitions\n              {3, 4}        {\"Random Access\", \"Supports Writing\"}                        \\\\.\\PHYSICALDRIVE0  SCSI           TRUE         Fixed hard disk media  SAMSUNG MZVLB512HAJQ-000H2  \\\\.\\PHYSICALDRIVE0  3\n              {3, 4}        {\"Random Access\", \"Supports Writing\"}                        \\\\.\\PHYSICALDRIVE1  SCSI           TRUE         Fixed hard disk media  SAMSUNG MZVLB1T0HALR-000H2  \\\\.\\PHYSICALDRIVE1  1\n              {3, 4, 10}    {\"Random Access\", \"Supports Writing\", \"SMART Notification\"}  \\\\.\\PHYSICALDRIVE2  SCSI           TRUE         Fixed hard disk media  ST2000DM001-1ER164          \\\\.\\PHYSICALDRIVE2  1\n```\n\n#### Collect WSL logs for networking issues\n\nInstall tcpdump in your WSL distribution using the following commands.\nNote: This will not work if WSL has Internet connectivity issues.\n\n```\n# sudo apt-get update\n# sudo apt-get -y install tcpdump\n```\n\nInstall [WPR](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/test/wpt/windows-performance-recorder)\n\nTo collect WSL networking logs, do the following steps in an administrative powershell prompt:\n\n```\nInvoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/WSL/master/diagnostics/collect-networking-logs.ps1\" -OutFile collect-networking-logs.ps1\nSet-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force\n.\\collect-networking-logs.ps1\n```\nThe script will output when log collection starts. Reproduce the problem, then press any key to stop the log collection.\nThe script will output the path of the log file once done.\n\n<!-- Preserving anchors -->\n<div id=\"8-detailed-logs\"></div>\n<div id=\"9-networking-logs\"></div>\n\n\n### 8) Collect WSL logs (recommended method)\n\nIf you choose to email these logs instead of attaching to the bug, please send them to wsl-gh-logs@microsoft.com with the number of the github issue in the subject, and in the message a link to your comment in the github issue.\n\nTo collect WSL logs, download and execute [collect-wsl-logs.ps1](https://github.com/Microsoft/WSL/blob/master/diagnostics/collect-wsl-logs.ps1) in an administrative powershell prompt:\n\n```\nInvoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/WSL/master/diagnostics/collect-wsl-logs.ps1\" -OutFile collect-wsl-logs.ps1\nSet-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force\n.\\collect-wsl-logs.ps1\n```\nThe script will output the path of the log file once done.\n\n### 9) Collect WSL logs with Feedback hub\nTo collect WSL logs follow these steps: \n\n#### Open Feedback Hub and enter the title and description of your issue\n\n- Open Feedback hub and create a new issue by pressing `Windows Key + F` on your keyboard. \n- Enter in the details of your issue:\n   - In `Summarize your feedback` copy and paste in the title of your Github Issue\n   - In `Explain in more detail` copy and paste a link to your Github Issue\n\n![GIF Of networking instructions](img/networkinglog1.gif)\n\n#### Choose the WSL category \n\n- Select that your issue is a `Problem`\n- Choose the `Developer Platform` category and the `Windows Subsystem for Linux` subcategory\n\n![GIF Of networking instructions](img/networkinglog2.gif)\n\n#### Recreate your problem in the 'Additional Details' section\n\n- Select 'Other' under 'Which of the following best describes your problem'\n- Click 'Recreate My Problem' under 'Attachments\n- Ensure that `Include Data About:` is checked to 'Windows Subsystem for Linux' \n- 'Click Start Recording' to start collecting logs\n- Recreate your problem\n- Click 'Stop Recording'\n\n![GIF Of networking instructions](img/networkinglog3.gif)\n\n#### Check your attachments and submit\n\n- Verify your recording is attached and whether you would like to send the screenshot that is automatically attached\n- Hit Submit\n- Get a link to your feedback item by clicking on 'Share my Feedback' and post that link to the Github thread so we can easily get to your feedback!\n\n![GIF Of networking instructions](img/networkinglog4.gif)\n\n\n### 10) Reporting a Windows crash (BSOD)\n\nTo collect a kernel crash dump, first run the following command in an elevated command prompt:\n\n```\nreg.exe add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\CrashControl /v AlwaysKeepMemoryDump  /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f\n```\n\nThen reproduce the issue, and let the machine crash and reboot.\n\nAfter reboot, the kernel dump will be in `%SystemRoot%\\MEMORY.DMP` (unless this path has been overriden in the advanced system settings).\n\nPlease send this dump to: secure@microsoft.com .\nMake sure that the email body contains:\n\n- The Github issue number, if any\n- That this dump is destinated to the WSL team\n\n### 11) Reporting a WSL process crash\n\nThe easiest way to report a WSL process crash is by [collecting a user-mode crash dump](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wer/collecting-user-mode-dumps).\n\nTo collect dumps of all running WSL processe, please open a PowerShell prompt with admin privileges, navigate to a folder where you'd like to put your log files and run these commands: \n\n```\nInvoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/WSL/master/diagnostics/collect-wsl-logs.ps1\" -OutFile collect-wsl-logs.ps1\nSet-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force\n.\\collect-wsl-logs.ps1 -Dump\n```\n\nThe script will output the path to the log file when it is done.\n\n#### Enable automatic crash dump collection\n\nIf your crash is sporadic or hard to reproduce, please enable automatic crash dumps to catch logs for this behavior: \n\n```\nmd C:\\crashes\nreg.exe add \"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Windows Error Reporting\\LocalDumps\" /f\nreg.exe add \"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Windows Error Reporting\\LocalDumps\" /v DumpFolder /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d C:\\crashes /f\nreg.exe add \"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Windows Error Reporting\\LocalDumps\" /v DumpType /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f\n```\n\nCrash dumps will then automatically be written to C:\\crashes.\n\nOnce you're done, crash dump collection can be disabled by running the following command in an elevated command prompt:\n\n```\nreg.exe delete \"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Windows Error Reporting\\LocalDumps\" /f\n```\n\n### 12) Collect wslservice time travel debugging traces\n\nTo collect time travel debugging traces:\n\n1) [Install Windbg preview](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windbg-preview/9PGJGD53TN86?hl=en-us&gl=us&rtc=1)\n\n2) Open windbg preview as administrator by running `windbgx` in an elevated command prompt\n\n3) Navigate to `file` -> `Attach to process`\n\n4) Check `Record with Time Travel Debugging` (at the bottom right)\n\n4) Check `Show processes from all users` (at the bottom)\n\n5) Select `wslservice.exe`. Note, if wslservice.exe is not running, you make it start it with: `wsl.exe -l`\n\n6) Click `Configure and Record` (write down the folder you chose for the traces)\n\n7) Reproduce the issue\n\n8) Go back to windbg and click `Stop and Debug`\n\n9) Once the trace is done collecting, click `Stop Debugging` and close Windbg\n\n10) Go to the folder where the trace was colleced, and locate the .run file. It should look like: `wslservice*.run`\n\n11) Share that file on the issue\n"

We will be monitoring and responding to issues as best we can. Please attempt to avoid filing duplicates of open or closed items when possible. Issues may be tagged with with the following labels:\n\n- **bug** – The issue considered to be a bug internally by the dev team. This tag is generally for gaps in implemented (read: intended to be working) WSL behavior. Things marked with **bug** have a corresponding bug in on Microsoft’s internal bug tracking system. Example: \"du -h reports wrong file size on DrvFs\" [(#1894)](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/1894)\n\n- **feature** – Denotes something understood as not working and is not yet implemented. Example: \"Cuda can not be installed\" [(#327)](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/327)\n\n- **fixinbound** / **fixedinNNNN** – The bug or feature request originally submitted has been addressed in whole or in part. Related or ongoing bug or feature gaps should be opened as a new issue submission if one does not already exist.\n\n- **duplicate** – The submission is substantially duplicative of an existing issue, and/or has the same underlying cause.\n\n- **need-repro** – The issue submission is missing fields from the issue [template](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE), cannot be reproduced with the information provided, or is not actionable.\n\n- **discussion** / **question** – Submissions which are not a bug report or feature request. Example: Windows Subsystem for Linux is not open source [(#178)](https://github.com/Microsoft/WSL/issues/178)\n\n- **bydesign** / **linux-behavior** – Denotes that an issue that is considered working as intended or would behave analogously on a native Linux kernel.\n\n- **console** – The submission should be directed to the [console issue tracker](https://github.com/microsoft/console/issues).\n\n- **documentation** – The submission should be directed to the [WSL documentation issue tracker](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/WSL).\n\n- **wsl2** - The issue relates specifically to WSL 2.\n\n- **fixed-in-wsl2** - The issue could be resolved by switching the distro to use the WSL 2 architecture.\n\nAdditional tags may be used to denote specific types of issues.\n\n- **9p-linux-file-access** - The issue is related to accessing Linux files from Windows.\n\n## Closing:\n\nIssues may be closed by the original poster at any time.
