Fork this repository:**\nFork this repository by clicking on the `Fork` button on the top right.\n\n**2. Clone Reflex and navigate into the repo:**\n\n``` bash\ngit clone https://github.com/<YOUR-USERNAME>/reflex.git\ncd reflex\n```\n\n**3. Install your local Reflex build:**\n\n``` bash\npoetry install\n```\n\n**4. Now create an examples folder so you can test the local Python build in this repository.**\n\n- We have the `examples` folder in the `.gitignore`, so your changes in `reflex/examples` won't be reflected in your commit.\n\n``` bash\nmkdir examples\ncd examples\n```\n\n**5. Init and Run**\n\n``` bash\npoetry run reflex init\npoetry run reflex run\n```\n\nAll the changes you make to the repository will be reflected in your running app.\n\n- We have the examples folder in the .gitignore, so your changes in reflex/examples won't be reflected in your commit.\n\n## 🧪 Testing and QA\n\nAny feature or significant change added should be accompanied with unit tests.\n\nWithin the 'test' directory of Reflex you can add to a test file already there or create a new test python file if it doesn't fit into the existing layout.\n\n#### What to unit test?\n\n- Any feature or significant change that has been added.\n- Any edge cases or potential problem areas.\n- Any interactions between different parts of the code.\n\n## ✅ Making a PR\n\nOnce you solve a current issue or improvement to Reflex, you can make a PR, and we will review the changes.\n\nBefore submitting, a pull request, ensure the following steps are taken and test passing.\n\nIn your `reflex` directory run make sure all the unit tests are still passing using the following command.\nThis will fail if code coverage is below 70%.\n\n``` bash\npoetry run pytest tests/units --cov --no-cov-on-fail --cov-report= \n```\n\nNext make sure all the following tests pass. This ensures that every new change has proper documentation and type checking.\n\n``` bash\npoetry run ruff check .\npoetry run pyright reflex tests\nfind reflex tests -name \"*.py\" -not -path reflex/reflex.py | xargs poetry run darglint\n```\n\nFinally, run `ruff` to format your code.\n\n``` bash\npoetry run ruff format .\n```\n\nConsider installing git pre-commit hooks so Ruff, Pyright, Darglint and `make_pyi` will run automatically before each commit.\nNote that pre-commit will only be installed when you use a Python version >= 3.9.\n\n``` bash\npre-commit install\n```\n\nThat's it you can now submit your PR. Thanks for contributing to Reflex!\n\n\n## Editing Templates \n\nTo edit the templates in Reflex you can do so in two way.\n\nChange to the basic `blank` template can be done in the `reflex/.templates/apps/blank` directory.\n\nOthers templates can be edited in their own repository. For example the `sidebar` template can be found in the [`reflex-sidebar`](https://github.com/reflex-dev/sidebar-template) repository.\n\n\n## Other Notes\n\nFor some pull requests when adding new components you will have to generate a pyi file for the new component. This is done by running the following command in the `reflex` directory.\n\n(Please check in with the team before adding a new component to Reflex we are cautious about adding new components to Reflex's core.)\n\n``` bash\npoetry run python scripts/make_pyi.py \n```"

(Replace `my_app_name` with your project name):\n\n```bash\nmkdir my_app_name\ncd my_app_name\nreflex init\n```\n\nThis command initializes a template app in your new directory. \n\nYou can run this app in development mode:\n\n```bash\nreflex run\n```\n\nYou should see your app running at http://localhost:3000.\n\nNow you can modify the source code in `my_app_name/my_app_name.py`. Reflex has fast refreshes so you can see your changes instantly when you save your code.\n\n\n## 🫧 Example App\n\nLet's go over an example: creating an image generation UI around [DALL·E](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/images/image-generation?context=node). For simplicity, we just call the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/authentication), but you could replace this with an ML model run locally.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reflex-dev/reflex/main/docs/images/dalle.gif\" alt=\"A frontend wrapper for DALL·E, shown in the process of generating an image.\" width=\"550\" />\n</div>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHere is the complete code to create this. This is all done in one Python file!\n\n\n  \n```python\nimport reflex as rx\nimport openai\n\nopenai_client = openai.OpenAI()\n\n\nclass State(rx.State):\n    \"\"\"The app state.\"\"\"\n\n    prompt = \"\"\n    image_url = \"\"\n    processing = False\n    complete = False\n\n    def get_image(self):\n        \"\"\"Get the image from the prompt.\"\"\"\n        if self.prompt == \"\":\n            return rx.window_alert(\"Prompt Empty\")\n\n        self.processing, self.complete = True, False\n        yield\n        response = openai_client.images.generate(\n            prompt=self.prompt, n=1, size=\"1024x1024\"\n        )\n        self.image_url = response.data[0].url\n        self.processing, self.complete = False, True\n\n\ndef index():\n    return rx.center(\n        rx.vstack(\n            rx.heading(\"DALL-E\", font_size=\"1.5em\"),\n            rx.input(\n                placeholder=\"Enter a prompt..\",\n                on_blur=State.set_prompt,\n                width=\"25em\",\n            ),\n            rx.button(\n                \"Generate Image\", \n                on_click=State.get_image,\n                width=\"25em\",\n                loading=State.processing\n            ),\n            rx.cond(\n                State.complete,\n                rx.image(src=State.image_url, width=\"20em\"),\n            ),\n            align=\"center\",\n        ),\n        width=\"100%\",\n        height=\"100vh\",\n    )\n\n# Add state and page to the app.\napp = rx.App()\napp.add_page(index, title=\"Reflex:DALL-E\")\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n## Let's break this down.\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"docs/images/dalle_colored_code_example.png\" alt=\"Explaining the differences between backend and frontend parts of the DALL-E app.\" width=\"900\" />\n</div>\n\n\n### **Reflex UI**\n\nLet's start with the UI.\n\n```python\ndef index():\n    return rx.center(\n        ...\n    )\n```\n\nThis `index` function defines the frontend of the app.\n\nWe use different components such as `center`, `vstack`, `input`, and `button` to build the frontend. Components can be nested within each other\nto create complex layouts. And you can use keyword args to style them with the full power of CSS.\n\nReflex comes with [60+ built-in components](https://reflex.dev/docs/library) to help you get started. We are actively adding more components, and it's easy to [create your own components](https://reflex.dev/docs/wrapping-react/overview/).\n\n### **State**\n\nReflex represents your UI as a function of your state.\n\n```python\nclass State(rx.State):\n    \"\"\"The app state.\"\"\"\n    prompt = \"\"\n    image_url = \"\"\n    processing = False\n    complete = False\n\n```\n\nThe state defines all the variables (called vars) in an app that can change and the functions that change them.\n\nHere the state is comprised of a `prompt` and `image_url`. There are also the booleans `processing` and `complete` to indicate when to disable the button (during image generation) and when to show the resulting image.\n\n### **Event Handlers**\n\n```python\ndef get_image(self):\n    \"\"\"Get the image from the prompt.\"\"\"\n    if self.prompt == \"\":\n        return rx.window_alert(\"Prompt Empty\")\n\n    self.processing, self.complete = True, False\n    yield\n    response = openai_client.images.generate(\n        prompt=self.prompt, n=1, size=\"1024x1024\"\n    )\n    self.image_url = response.data[0].url\n    self.processing, self.complete = False, True\n```\n\nWithin the state, we define functions called event handlers that change the state vars. Event handlers are the way that we can modify the state in Reflex. They can be called in response to user actions, such as clicking a button or typing in a text box. These actions are called events.\n\nOur DALL·E. app has an event handler, `get_image` to which get this image from the OpenAI API. Using `yield` in the middle of an event handler will cause the UI to update. Otherwise the UI will update at the end of the event handler.\n\n### **Routing**\n\nFinally, we define our app.\n\n```python\napp = rx.App()\n```\n\nWe add a page from the root of the app to the index component. We also add a title that will show up in the page preview/browser tab.\n\n```python\napp.add_page(index, title=\"DALL-E\")\n```\n\nYou can create a multi-page app by adding more pages.\n\n## 📑 Resources\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n\n📑 [Docs](https://reflex.dev/docs/getting-started/introduction) &nbsp; |  &nbsp; 🗞️ [Blog](https://reflex.dev/blog) &nbsp; |  &nbsp; 📱 [Component Library](https://reflex.dev/docs/library) &nbsp; |  &nbsp; 🖼️ [Templates](https://reflex.dev/templates/) &nbsp; |  &nbsp; 🛸 [Deployment](https://reflex.dev/docs/hosting/deploy-quick-start)  &nbsp;   \n\n</div>\n\n\n## ✅ Status\n\nReflex launched in December 2022 with the name Pynecone.\n\nAs of February 2024, our hosting service is in alpha!
