APFS ROM patching)\n* Graphics acceleration for both Metal and non-Metal GPUs\n\n----------\n\nNote: Only clean-installs and upgrades are supported. macOS Big Sur installs already patched with other patchers, such as [Patched Sur](https://github.com/BenSova/Patched-Sur) or [bigmac](https://github.com/StarPlayrX/bigmac), cannot be used due to broken file integrity with APFS snapshots and SIP.\n\n* You can, however, reinstall macOS with this patcher and retain your original data\n\nNote 2: Currently, OpenCore Legacy Patcher officially supports patching to run macOS Big Sur through Sonoma installs. For older OSes, OpenCore may function; however, support is currently not provided from Dortania.\n\n* For macOS Mojave and Catalina support, we recommend the use of [dosdude1's patchers](http://dosdude1.com)\n\n## Getting Started\n\nTo start using the project, please see our in-depth guide:\n\n* [OpenCore Legacy Patcher Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/)\n\n## Support\n\nThis project is offered on an AS-IS basis, we do not guarantee support for any issues that may arise. However, there is a community server with other passionate users and developers that can aid you:\n\n* [OpenCore Patcher Paradise Discord Server](https://discord.gg/rqdPgH8xSN)\n  * Keep in mind that the Discord server is maintained by the community, so we ask everyone to be respectful.\n  * Please review our docs on [how to debug with OpenCore](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/DEBUG.html) to gather important information to help others with troubleshooting.\n\n## Running from source\n\nTo run the project from source, see here: [Build and run from source](./SOURCE.md)\n\n## Credits\n\n* [Acidanthera](https://github.com/Acidanthera)\n  * OpenCorePkg, as well as many of the core kexts and tools\n* [DhinakG](https://github.com/DhinakG)\n  * Main co-author\n* [Khronokernel](https://github.com/Khronokernel)\n  * Main co-author\n* [Ausdauersportler](https://github.com/Ausdauersportler)\n  * iMacs Metal GPUs Upgrade Patch set and documentation\n  * Great amounts of help with debugging, and code suggestions\n* [vit9696](https://github.com/vit9696)\n  * Endless amount of help troubleshooting, determining fixes and writing patches\n* [EduCovas](https://github.com/covasedu)\n  * [non-Metal patch set](https://github.com/moraea/non-metal-frameworks) for nVidia Tesla/Fermi/Maxwell/Pascal, AMD TeraScale 1/2, and Intel Core 1st/2nd Generation GPUs\n  * [3802 Metal patch set](https://github.com/moraea/misc-patches/tree/main/3802-Metal-15) and [MetallibSupportPkg](https://github.com/dortania/MetallibSupportPkg) for nVidia Kepler and Intel Core 3rd/4th Generation GPUs\n  * Metal bundle patches and shims for [nVidia Kepler](https://github.com/moraea/misc-patches/tree/main/Kepler%2013%2B), [AMD GCN 1 -

          "content": "# Build and run from source\n\nOpenCore Legacy Patcher at its core is a Python-based GUI/CLI-based application. In turn, to run the project from source, you simply need to invoke the OpenCore-Patcher-GUI.command file via Python.\n\nFor developers wishing to validate mainline changes, you may use this link: [GUI (Graphical Based App)](https://nightly.link/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/workflows/build-app-wxpython/main/OpenCore-Patcher.pkg.zip)\n\n* **Warning**: Nightly builds (untagged builds built from the latest commit) are actively developed OpenCore Legacy Patcher builds. These builds have not been tested, are not guaranteed to work, and are not guaranteed to be safe. Do not use nightlies without a good reason to do so, and do not use them on your main machine. Additionally, these binaries should not be used without first consulting the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md).\n\n  **Do not share _any_ links to these binaries** in forums; please link to **this document only**.\n  * Additionally, do not reupload these binaries or download binaries from other sites. Using binaries from untrusted sources is a security issue, as they may have been tampered with.\n* Users running new builds of the project without understanding what has changed and the implications of installing software under active development are at a higher risk of bricking their installation as they do not read any warnings provided in the CHANGELOG. We wish to minimize these situations as much as possible.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nTo start, ensure you have Python 3.6 or newer installed. Additionally, ensure that it was downloaded from the official source, [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/).\n\n* Python installations either preinstalled or provided with Xcode or the Xcode Command Line Tools are unsupported due to reliability issues.\n\nOnce Python is installed, open Terminal and run the following:\n\n```sh\n# Move into a directory to store the project\ncd ~/Developer\n# Clone project\ngit clone https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher\n# Move into Project directory\ncd ./OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher\n# Install Python dependencies used by the project\npip3 install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\nIf you have any installation errors, see the following troubleshooting options:\n\n* Use Python 3.11\n  * Our build server currently uses Python 3.11 for generating binaries used in releases\n* Use .whl snapshots for installing additional dependencies\n\n## Running OpenCore Legacy Patcher\n\nTo run the project from source, simply invoke via python3:\n\n```sh\n# Launch GUI\npython3 OpenCore-Patcher-GUI.command\n```\n\nNote that the OpenCore-Patcher-GUI.command file can be run as both a GUI and a CLI utility for other programs to call. If no core arguments are passed, the GUI is initialized. Otherwise the CLI will start:\n\n```sh\n# Launch CLI\npython3 OpenCore-Patcher-GUI.command --build --model iMac12,2 --verbose\n```\n\nPass `-h` or `--help` for more information on supported CLI arguments.\n\n## Generating prebuilt binaries\n\nThe main goal of generating prebuilt binaries is to strip the requirement of a local Python installation for users. For developers, there's very little benefit besides enabling dark mode support in the GUI. For development, simply use the OpenCore-Patcher-GUI.command file with a Python 3 installation.\n\n```sh\n# Install PyInstaller\npip3 install pyinstaller\n# Move into project directory\ncd ~/Developer/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/\n# Create the pyinstaller based Application\npython3 Build-Project.command\n# Open build folder\nopen ./dist/\n```\n\nOnce done, you'll find the application generated at `./dist/OpenCore-Patcher.app`:\n\n![](./images/build-dist.png)\n"
