In order to comply with the relevant licenses, it is currently not possible to release the complete model weights. We appreciate your understanding. After Facebook fully opens up the model weights, this project will update its policies accordingly. **What is released here are the LoRA weights**, which can be seen as a \"patch\" for the original LLaMA model, and the complete weights can be obtained by merging the two.\n\n### Model Overview\n\nThe following figure depicts all open-sourced models for our projects (including the [second-gen project](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca-2)).\n\n![](./pics/models.png)\n\n### Which model should I use?\n\nThe following table provides a basic comparison of the Chinese LLaMA and Alpaca models, as well as recommended usage scenarios (including, but not limited to). \n\n💡 **Plus versions** are trained on more data, which is highly recommended for use.\n\n| Comparison Item                                        | Chinese LLaMA                                                | Chinese Alpaca                                               |\n| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Training Method                                        | Traditional CLM (trained on general corpus)                  | Instruction Fine-tuning (trained on instruction data)        |\n| Model Type                                             | Base model                                                   | Instruction-following model (like ChatGPT)                   |\n| Training Data                                          | unsupervised free text                                       | supervised instruction data                                  |\n| Vocab size<sup>[3]</sup>                               | 4995**3**                                                    | 4995**4**=49953+1 (pad token)                                |\n| Input Template                                         | Not required                                                 | Must meet template requirements<sup>[1]</sup>                |\n| Suitable Scenarios ✔️                                   | Text continuation: Given a context, let the model continue writing | 1.

Reply generation is random and is affected by factors such as decoding hyperparameters and random seeds. The following related evaluations are not absolutely rigorous, and the test results are for reference only. Welcome to experience it yourself. \n\n- For detailed evaluation results, please see [examples](./examples)\n- 📊 Alpaca ChatBot Arena: [http://llm-arena.ymcui.com](http://llm-arena.ymcui.com/)\n\n### NLU Performance Test\n\nThis project also conducted tests on relevant models using the \"NLU\" objective evaluation dataset. The results of this type of evaluation are objective and only require the output of given labels, so they can provide insights into the capabilities of large models from another perspective. In the recently launched [C-Eval dataset](https://cevalbenchmark.com/), this project tested the performance of the relevant models. The test set contains 12.3K multiple-choice questions covering 52 subjects. The following are the evaluation results (average) of some models on the validation and test sets. For complete results, please refer to our [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08177).\n\n| Models                  | Valid (zero-shot) | Valid (5-shot) | Test (zero-shot) | Test (5-shot) |\n| ----------------------- | :---------------: | :------------: | :--------------: | :-----------: |\n| Chinese-Alpaca-Plus-33B |       46.5        |      46.3      |       44.9       |     43.5      |\n| Chinese-Alpaca-33B      |       43.3        |      42.6      |       41.6       |     40.4      |\n| Chinese-Alpaca-Plus-13B |       43.3        |      42.4      |       41.5       |     39.9      |\n| Chinese-Alpaca-Plus-7B  |       36.7        |      32.9      |       36.4       |     32.3      |\n| Chinese-LLaMA-Plus-33B  |       37.4        |      40.0      |       35.7       |     38.3      |\n| Chinese-LLaMA-33B       |       34.9        |      38.4      |       34.6       |     39.5      |\n| Chinese-LLaMA-Plus-13B  |       27.3        |      34.0      |       27.8       |     33.3      |\n| Chinese-LLaMA-Plus-7B   |       27.3        |      28.3      |       26.9       |     28.4      |\n\nIt is important to note that the comprehensive assessment of the capabilities of large models is still an urgent and significant topic to address. It is beneficial to approach the various evaluation results of large models in a rational and balanced manner to promote the healthy development of large-scale model technology. It is recommended for users to conduct tests on their own tasks and choose models that are suitable for the relevant tasks.\n\nFor C-Eval inference code, please refer to >>> [📚GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca/wiki/C-Eval-performance-and-script).\n\n## Training Details\n\nThe entire training process includes three parts: vocabulary expansion, pre-training, and instruction fine-tuning. Please refer to [merge_tokenizers.py](scripts/merge_tokenizer/merge_tokenizers.py) for vocabulary expansion; refer to [run_clm.py](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/examples/pytorch/language-modeling/run_clm.py) in 🤗transformers and the relevant parts of dataset processing in the [Stanford Alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca) project for pre-training and self-instruct fine-tuning.\n\nWe have open-sourced the scripts for pre-training and instruction finetuning (SFT): \n\n- Pre-training: [scripts/training/run_clm_pt_with_peft.py](./scripts/training/run_clm_pt_with_peft.py), refer to [Pre-training Wiki](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca/wiki/Pretraining-Script)\n\n- Instruction Finetuning: [scripts/training/run_clm_sft_with_peft.py](./scripts/training/run_clm_sft_with_peft.py), refer to [SFT Wiki](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca/wiki/SFT-Script)\n\nPlease refer to our  >>> [📚GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca/wiki/Training-Details).\n\n\n## FAQ\n\nFAQ provides answers to frequent questions. Please see our FAQ before submitting an issue.\n\n```\nQ1: Why can't you release the complete model weights?\nQ2: Will there be versions of 33B, and 65B in the future?\nQ3: The model doesn't perform well on some tasks!\nQ4: Why expand the vocabulary? Can't you just pre-train the original LLaMA with Chinese data?\nQ5: The reply is very short\nQ6: Under Windows, the model cannot understand Chinese, the generation speed is very slow, etc.\nQ7: Chinese-LLaMA 13B model cannot be launched with llama.cpp, reporting inconsistent dimensions.\nQ8: Chinese-Alpaca-Plus does not show better performance than the others.\nQ9: The model does not perform well on NLU tasks, such as text classification.\nQ10: Why 33B not 30B?\nQ11: Inconsistent SHA256\n```\n\nPlease refer to our  >>> [📚GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca/wiki/FAQ).\n\n## Limitations\n\nAlthough the models in this project have significantly improved Chinese understanding and generation capabilities compared to the original LLaMA and Alpaca, there are also the following limitations:\n\n- It may produce unpredictable harmful content and content that does not conform to human preferences and values.\n- Due to computing power and data issues, the training of the related models is not sufficient, and the Chinese understanding ability needs to be further improved.\n- There is no online interactive demo available for now (Note: users can still deploy it locally themselves).\n\n## Citation\n\nIf you find the model, data, code in our project useful, please consider citing our work as follows: https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08177\n\n```\n@article{chinese-llama-alpaca,\n      title={Efficient and Effective Text Encoding for Chinese LLaMA and Alpaca}, \n      author={Cui, Yiming and Yang, Ziqing and Yao, Xin},\n      journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2304.08177},\n      url={https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08177},\n      year={2023}\n}\n```\n\n## Related Projects\n\n| Project Name                                                 | Description                             |    Type     |\n| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :---------: |\n| [**Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca-2**](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca-2) (Official) | Chinese LLaMA-2, Alpaca-2 LLMs          |    Text     |\n| [**Visual-Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca**](https://github.com/airaria/Visual-Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca) (Official) | Multi-modal Chinese LLaMA & Alpaca LLMs | Multi-modal |\n\nWant to join this list? >>> [Apply Here](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca/discussions/740)\n\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis project is based on the following open-source projects for secondary development, and we would like to express our gratitude to the related projects and research and development personnel.\n\n|                   Foundation Models, Codes                   |             Quantization, Inference, Deployment              |                             Data                             |\n| :----------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |\n| [LLaMA by Facebook](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama)<br/>[Alpaca by Stanford](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca)<br/>[alpaca-lora by @tloen](https://github.com/tloen/alpaca-lora) | [llama.cpp by @ggerganov](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp)<br/>[LlamaChat by @alexrozanski]( https://github.com/alexrozanski/LlamaChat)<br/>[text-generation-webui by @oobabooga](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui) | [pCLUE and translation data by @brightmart](https://github.com/brightmart/nlp_chinese_corpus)<br/>[oasst1 by OpenAssistant](https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenAssistant/oasst1) |\n\nEpisode: The current logo is automatically generated by GPT-4 with the DALL·E plugin (previously generated by midjourney).\n\n## Disclaimer\n\n**The resources related to this project are for academic research purposes only and are strictly prohibited for commercial use.** When using parts involving third-party code, please strictly follow the corresponding open-source agreements.
