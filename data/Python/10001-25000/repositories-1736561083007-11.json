          "content": "                    GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 3, 19 November 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure\ncooperation with the community in the case of network server software.\n\n  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\nour General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights\nwith two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer\nyou this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\nand/or modify the software.\n\n  A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that\nimprovements made in alternate versions of the program, if they\nreceive widespread use, become available for other developers to\nincorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and\nencouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of\nsoftware used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.\nThe GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and\nletting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its\nsource code to the public.\n\n  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to\nensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available\nto the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to\nprovide the source code of the modified version running there to the\nusers of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on\na publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source\ncode of the modified version.\n\n  An older license, called the Affero General Public License and\npublished by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is\na different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has\nreleased a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under\nthis license.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the\nProgram, your modified version must prominently offer all users\ninteracting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version\nsupports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding\nSource of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source\nfrom a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary\nmeans of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source\nshall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3\nof the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the\nfollowing paragraph.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version\n3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions\nwill be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published\n    by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU Affero General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer\nnetwork, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to\nget its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its\ninterface could display a \"Source\" link that leads users to an archive\nof the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different\nsolutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the\nspecific requirements.\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n"

          "content": "# MinerU Contributor License Agreement\nIn order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity, the open source project MinerU (\"MinerU\") must have a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) on file that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below. This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of MinerU and its users; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.\n\nYou accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and future Contributions submitted to MinerU. Except for the license granted herein to MinerU and recipients of software distributed by MinerU, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.\n\n1. Definitions. \"You\" (or \"Your\") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with MinerU. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, \"control\" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity. \"Contribution\" shall mean the code, documentation or any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to MinerU for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by MinerU (the \"Work\"). For the purposes of this definition, \"submitted\" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to MinerU or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, MinerU for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as \"Not a Contribution.\"\n2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to MinerU and to recipients of software distributed by MinerU a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.\n3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to MinerU and to recipients of software distributed by MinerU a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that Your Contribution, or the Work to which You have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n4. You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above license. If You are an entity, You represent further that each of Your employee designated by You is authorized to submit Contributions on behalf of You. If You are an individual and Your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that You create that includes Your Contributions, You represent further that You have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that Your employer has waived such rights for Your Contributions to MinerU, or that Your employer has executed a separate CLA with MinerU.\n5. If you do post content or submit material on MinerU and unless we indicate otherwise, you grant MinerU a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, and fully sublicensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, perform, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, and display such content throughout the world in any media. You grant MinerU and sublicensees the right to use your GitHub Public Profile, including but not limited to name, that you submit in connection with such content. You represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to the content that you post; that the content is accurate; that use of the content you supply does not violate this policy and will not cause injury to any person or entity; and that you will indemnify MinerU for all claims resulting from content you supply. MinerU has the right but not the obligation to monitor and edit or remove any activity or content. MinerU takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any content posted by you or any third party.\n6. You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation. Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may submit it to MinerU separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which You are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as \"Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here]\".\n7. You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n8. You agree to notify MinerU of any facts or circumstances of which You become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.\n9. MinerU reserves the right to update or change this Agreement at any time, by posting the most current version of the Agreement on MinerU, with a new Effective Date shown on Jul. 24th, 2024. All such changes in the Agreement are effective from the Effective Date. Your continued use of MinerU after we post any such changes signifies your agreement to those changes. If you do not agree to the then-current Agreement, you must immediately discontinue using MinerU.\n"

This is our first official release, where we have introduced a completely new API interface and enhanced compatibility through extensive refactoring, as well as a brand new automatic language identification feature:\n  - New API Interface\n    - For the data-side API, we have introduced the Dataset class, designed to provide a robust and flexible data processing framework. This framework currently supports a variety of document formats, including images (.jpg and .png), PDFs, Word documents (.doc and .docx), and PowerPoint presentations (.ppt and .pptx). It ensures effective support for data processing tasks ranging from simple to complex.\n    - For the user-side API, we have meticulously designed the MinerU processing workflow as a series of composable Stages. Each Stage represents a specific processing step, allowing users to define new Stages according to their needs and creatively combine these stages to customize their data processing workflows.\n  - Enhanced Compatibility\n    - By optimizing the dependency environment and configuration items, we ensure stable and efficient operation on ARM architecture Linux systems.\n    - We have deeply integrated with Huawei Ascend NPU acceleration, providing autonomous and controllable high-performance computing capabilities. This supports the localization and development of AI application platforms in China. [Ascend NPU Acceleration](docs/README_Ascend_NPU_Acceleration_zh_CN.md)\n  - Automatic Language Identification\n    - By introducing a new language recognition model, setting the `lang` configuration to `auto` during document parsing will automatically select the appropriate OCR language model, improving the accuracy of scanned document parsing.\n- 2024/11/22 0.10.0 released. Introducing hybrid OCR text extraction capabilities,\n  - Significantly improved parsing performance in complex text distribution scenarios such as dense formulas, irregular span regions, and text represented by images.\n  - Combines the dual advantages of accurate content extraction and faster speed in text mode, and more precise span/line region recognition in OCR mode.\n- 2024/11/15 0.9.3 released. Integrated [RapidTable](https://github.com/RapidAI/RapidTable) for table recognition, improving single-table parsing speed by more than 10 times, with higher accuracy and lower GPU memory usage.\n- 2024/11/06 0.9.2 released. Integrated the [StructTable-InternVL2-1B](https://huggingface.co/U4R/StructTable-InternVL2-1B) model for table recognition functionality.\n- 2024/10/31 0.9.0 released. This is a major new version with extensive code refactoring, addressing numerous issues, improving performance, reducing hardware requirements, and enhancing usability:\n  - Refactored the sorting module code to use [layoutreader](https://github.com/ppaanngggg/layoutreader) for reading order sorting, ensuring high accuracy in various layouts.\n  - Refactored the paragraph concatenation module to achieve good results in cross-column, cross-page, cross-figure, and cross-table scenarios.\n  - Refactored the list and table of contents recognition functions, significantly improving the accuracy of list blocks and table of contents blocks, as well as the parsing of corresponding text paragraphs.\n  - Refactored the matching logic for figures, tables, and descriptive text, greatly enhancing the accuracy of matching captions and footnotes to figures and tables, and reducing the loss rate of descriptive text to near zero.\n  - Added multi-language support for OCR, supporting detection and recognition of 84 languages.For the list of supported languages, see [OCR Language Support List](https://paddlepaddle.github.io/PaddleOCR/latest/en/ppocr/blog/multi_languages.html#5-support-languages-and-abbreviations).\n  - Added memory recycling logic and other memory optimization measures, significantly reducing memory usage. The memory requirement for enabling all acceleration features except table acceleration (layout/formula/OCR) has been reduced from 16GB to 8GB, and the memory requirement for enabling all acceleration features has been reduced from 24GB to 10GB.\n  - Optimized configuration file feature switches, adding an independent formula detection switch to significantly improve speed and parsing results when formula detection is not needed.\n  - Integrated [PDF-Extract-Kit 1.0](https://github.com/opendatalab/PDF-Extract-Kit):\n    - Added the self-developed `doclayout_yolo` model, which speeds up processing by more than 10 times compared to the original solution while maintaining similar parsing effects, and can be freely switched with `layoutlmv3` via the configuration file.\n    - Upgraded formula parsing to `unimernet 0.2.1`, improving formula parsing accuracy while significantly reducing memory usage.\n    - Due to the repository change for `PDF-Extract-Kit 1.0`, you need to re-download the model. Please refer to [How to Download Models](docs/how_to_download_models_en.md) for detailed steps.\n- 2024/09/27 Version 0.8.1 released, Fixed some bugs, and providing a [localized deployment version](projects/web_demo/README.md) of the [online demo](https://opendatalab.com/OpenSourceTools/Extractor/PDF/) and the [front-end interface](projects/web/README.md).\n- 2024/09/09: Version 0.8.0 released, supporting fast deployment with Dockerfile, and launching demos on Huggingface and Modelscope.\n- 2024/08/30: Version 0.7.1 released, add paddle tablemaster table recognition option\n- 2024/08/09: Version 0.7.0b1 released, simplified installation process, added table recognition functionality\n- 2024/08/01: Version 0.6.2b1 released, optimized dependency conflict issues and installation documentation\n- 2024/07/05: Initial open-source release\n\n<!-- TABLE OF CONTENT -->\n\n<details open=\"open\">\n  <summary><h2 style=\"display: inline-block\">Table of Contents</h2></summary>\n  <ol>\n    <li>\n      <a href=\"#mineru\">MinerU</a>\n      <ul>\n        <li><a href=\"#project-introduction\">Project Introduction</a></li>\n        <li><a href=\"#key-features\">Key Features</a></li>\n        <li><a href=\"#quick-start\">Quick Start</a>\n            <ul>\n            <li><a href=\"#online-demo\">Online Demo</a></li>\n            <li><a href=\"#quick-cpu-demo\">Quick CPU Demo</a></li>\n            <li><a href=\"#using-gpu\">Using GPU</a></li>\n            <li><a href=\"#using-npu\">Using NPU</a></li>\n            </ul>\n        </li>\n        <li><a href=\"#usage\">Usage</a>\n            <ul>\n            <li><a href=\"#command-line\">Command Line</a></li>\n            <li><a href=\"#api\">API</a></li>\n            <li><a href=\"#deploy-derived-projects\">Deploy Derived Projects</a></li>\n            <li><a href=\"#development-guide\">Development Guide</a></li>\n            </ul>\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n    </li>\n    <li><a href=\"#todo\">TODO</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#known-issues\">Known Issues</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#faq\">FAQ</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#all-thanks-to-our-contributors\">All Thanks To Our Contributors</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#license-information\">License Information</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#acknowledgments\">Acknowledgments</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#citation\">Citation</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#star-history\">Star History</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#magic-doc\">Magic-doc</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#magic-html\">Magic-html</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"#links\">Links</a></li>\n  </ol>\n</details>\n\n# MinerU\n\n## Project Introduction\n\nMinerU is a tool that converts PDFs into machine-readable formats (e.g., markdown, JSON), allowing for easy extraction into any format.\nMinerU was born during the pre-training process of [InternLM](https://github.com/InternLM/InternLM).

This ensures that users deploying and running the project on recommended system configurations will get the best performance with the fewest compatibility issues.\n>\n> By focusing resources on the mainline environment, our team can more efficiently resolve potential bugs and develop new features.\n>\n> In non-mainline environments, due to the diversity of hardware and software configurations, as well as third-party dependency compatibility issues, we cannot guarantee 100% project availability. Therefore, for users who wish to use this project in non-recommended environments, we suggest carefully reading the documentation and FAQ first. Most issues already have corresponding solutions in the FAQ. We also encourage community feedback to help us gradually expand support.\n\n<table>\n    <tr>\n        <td colspan=\"3\" rowspan=\"2\">Operating System</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Linux

Quick CPU Demo\n\n#### 1. Install magic-pdf\n\n```bash\nconda create -n MinerU python=3.10\nconda activate MinerU\npip install -U \"magic-pdf[full]\" --extra-index-url https://wheels.myhloli.com\n```\n\n#### 2. Download model weight files\n\nRefer to [How to Download Model Files](docs/how_to_download_models_en.md) for detailed instructions.\n\n#### 3. Modify the Configuration File for Additional Configuration\n\nAfter completing the [2. Download model weight files](#2-download-model-weight-files) step, the script will automatically generate a `magic-pdf.json` file in the user directory and configure the default model path.\nYou can find the `magic-pdf.json` file in your 【user directory】.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> The user directory for Windows is \"C:\\\\Users\\\\username\", for Linux it is \"/home/username\", and for macOS it is \"/Users/username\".\n\nYou can modify certain configurations in this file to enable or disable features, such as table recognition:\n\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> If the following items are not present in the JSON, please manually add the required items and remove the comment content (standard JSON does not support comments).\n\n```json\n{\n    // other config\n    \"layout-config\": {\n        \"model\": \"doclayout_yolo\" // Please change to \"layoutlmv3\" when using layoutlmv3.\n    },\n    \"formula-config\": {\n        \"mfd_model\": \"yolo_v8_mfd\",\n        \"mfr_model\": \"unimernet_small\",\n        \"enable\": true  // The formula recognition feature is enabled by default. If you need to disable it, please change the value here to \"false\".\n    },\n    \"table-config\": {\n        \"model\": \"rapid_table\",  // Default to using \"rapid_table\", can be switched to \"tablemaster\" or \"struct_eqtable\".\n        \"enable\": true, // The table recognition feature is enabled by default. If you need to disable it, please change the value here to \"false\".\n        \"max_time\": 400\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Using GPU\n\nIf your device supports CUDA and meets the GPU requirements of the mainline environment, you can use GPU acceleration. Please select the appropriate guide based on your system:\n\n- [Ubuntu 22.04 LTS + GPU](docs/README_Ubuntu_CUDA_Acceleration_en_US.md)\n- [Windows 10/11 + GPU](docs/README_Windows_CUDA_Acceleration_en_US.md)\n- Quick Deployment with Docker\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Docker requires a GPU with at least 8GB of VRAM, and all acceleration features are enabled by default.\n>\n> Before running this Docker, you can use the following command to check if your device supports CUDA acceleration on Docker.\n> \n> ```bash\n> docker run --rm --gpus=all nvidia/cuda:12.1.0-base-ubuntu22.04 nvidia-smi\n> ```\n  ```bash\n  wget https://github.com/opendatalab/MinerU/raw/master/docker/global/Dockerfile -O Dockerfile\n  docker build -t mineru:latest .\n  docker run --rm -it --gpus=all mineru:latest /bin/bash -c \"echo 'source /opt/mineru_venv/bin/activate' >> ~/.bashrc && exec bash\"\n  magic-pdf --help\n  ```\n\n### Using NPU\n\nIf your device has NPU acceleration hardware, you can follow the tutorial below to use NPU acceleration:\n\n[Ascend NPU Acceleration](docs/README_Ascend_NPU_Acceleration_zh_CN.md)\n\n### Using MPS\n\nIf your device uses Apple silicon chips, you can enable MPS acceleration for certain supported tasks (such as layout detection and formula detection).\n\nYou can enable MPS acceleration by setting the `device-mode` parameter to `mps` in the `magic-pdf.json` configuration file.\n\n```json\n{\n    // other config\n    \"device-mode\": \"mps\"\n}\n```\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Since the formula recognition task cannot utilize MPS acceleration, you can disable the formula recognition feature in tasks where it is not needed to achieve optimal performance.\n>\n> You can disable the formula recognition feature by setting the `enable` parameter in the `formula-config` section to `false`.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Command Line\n\n[Using MinerU via Command Line](https://mineru.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/usage/command_line.html)\n\n> [!TIP]\n> For more information about the output files, please refer to the [Output File Description](docs/output_file_en_us.md).\n\n### API\n\n[Using MinerU via Python API](https://mineru.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/usage/api.html)\n\n\n### Deploy Derived Projects\n\nDerived projects include secondary development projects based on MinerU by project developers and community developers,  \nsuch as application interfaces based on Gradio, RAG based on llama, web demos similar to the official website, lightweight multi-GPU load balancing client/server ends, etc.\nThese projects may offer more features and a better user experience.  \nFor specific deployment methods, please refer to the [Derived Project README](projects/README.md)\n\n\n### Development Guide\n\nTODO\n\n# TODO\n\n- [x] Reading order based on the model  \n- [x] Recognition of `index` and `list` in the main text  \n- [x] Table recognition\n- [ ] Code block recognition in the main text\n- [ ] [Chemical formula recognition](docs/chemical_knowledge_introduction/introduction.pdf)\n- [ ] Geometric shape recognition\n\n# Known Issues\n\n- Reading order is determined by the model based on the spatial distribution of readable content, and may be out of order in some areas under extremely complex layouts.\n- Vertical text is not supported.\n- Tables of contents and lists are recognized through rules, and some uncommon list formats may not be recognized.\n- Only one level of headings is supported; hierarchical headings are not currently supported.\n- Code blocks are not yet supported in the layout model.\n- Comic books, art albums, primary school textbooks, and exercises cannot be parsed well.\n- Table recognition may result in row/column recognition errors in complex tables.\n- OCR recognition may produce inaccurate characters in PDFs of lesser-known languages (e.g., diacritical marks in Latin script, easily confused characters in Arabic script).\n- Some formulas may not render correctly in Markdown.\n\n# FAQ\n\n[FAQ in Chinese](docs/FAQ_zh_cn.md)\n\n[FAQ in English](docs/FAQ_en_us.md)\n\n# All Thanks To Our Contributors\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/opendatalab/MinerU/graphs/contributors\">\n  <img src=\"https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=opendatalab/MinerU\" />\n</a>\n\n# License Information\n\n[LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md)\n\nThis project currently uses PyMuPDF to achieve advanced functionality.

1.0.1 发布，这是我们的第一个正式版本，在这个版本中，我们通过大量重构带来了全新的API接口和更广泛的兼容性，以及全新的自动语言识别功能：\n  - 全新API接口 \n    - 对于数据侧API，我们引入了Dataset类，旨在提供一个强大而灵活的数据处理框架。该框架当前支持包括图像（.jpg及.png）、PDF、Word（.doc及.docx）、以及PowerPoint（.ppt及.pptx）在内的多种文档格式，确保了从简单到复杂的数据处理任务都能得到有效的支持。\n    - 针对用户侧API，我们将MinerU的处理流程精心设计为一系列可组合的Stage阶段。每个Stage代表了一个特定的处理步骤，用户可以根据自身需求自由地定义新的Stage，并通过创造性地组合这些阶段来定制专属的数据处理流程。\n  - 更广泛的兼容性适配\n    - 通过优化依赖环境和配置项，确保在ARM架构的Linux系统上能够稳定高效运行。\n    - 深度适配华为昇腾NPU加速，积极响应信创要求，提供自主可控的高性能计算能力，助力人工智能应用平台的国产化应用与发展。[NPU加速教程](docs/README_Ascend_NPU_Acceleration_zh_CN.md)\n  - 自动语言识别\n    - 通过引入全新的语言识别模型，

使用CPU快速体验\n\n#### 1. 安装magic-pdf\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> 最新版本国内镜像源同步可能会有延迟，请耐心等待\n\n```bash\nconda create -n MinerU python=3.10\nconda activate MinerU\npip install -U \"magic-pdf[full]\" --extra-index-url https://wheels.myhloli.com -i https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple\n```\n\n#### 2. 下载模型权重文件\n\n详细参考 [如何下载模型文件](docs/how_to_download_models_zh_cn.md)\n\n#### 3. 修改配置文件以进行额外配置\n\n完成[2. 下载模型权重文件](#2-下载模型权重文件)步骤后，脚本会自动生成用户目录下的magic-pdf.json文件，并自动配置默认模型路径。\n您可在【用户目录】下找到magic-pdf.json文件。\n\n> [!TIP]\n> windows的用户目录为 \"C:\\\\Users\\\\用户名\", linux用户目录为 \"/home/用户名\", macOS用户目录为 \"/Users/用户名\"\n\n您可修改该文件中的部分配置实现功能的开关，如表格识别功能：\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>如json内没有如下项目，请手动添加需要的项目，并删除注释内容（标准json不支持注释）\n\n```json\n{\n    // other config\n    \"layout-config\": {\n        \"model\": \"doclayout_yolo\" // 使用layoutlmv3请修改为“layoutlmv3\"\n    },\n    \"formula-config\": {\n        \"mfd_model\": \"yolo_v8_mfd\",\n        \"mfr_model\": \"unimernet_small\",\n        \"enable\": true  // 公式识别功能默认是开启的，如果需要关闭请修改此处的值为\"false\"\n    },\n    \"table-config\": {\n        \"model\": \"rapid_table\",  // 默认使用\"rapid_table\",可以切换为\"tablemaster\"和\"struct_eqtable\"\n        \"enable\": true, // 表格识别功能默认是开启的，如果需要关闭请修改此处的值为\"false\"\n        \"max_time\": 400\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 使用GPU\n\n如果您的设备支持CUDA，且满足主线环境中的显卡要求，则可以使用GPU加速，请根据自己的系统选择适合的教程：\n\n- [Ubuntu22.04LTS + GPU](docs/README_Ubuntu_CUDA_Acceleration_zh_CN.md)\n- [Windows10/11 + GPU](docs/README_Windows_CUDA_Acceleration_zh_CN.md)\n- 使用Docker快速部署\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Docker 需设备gpu显存大于等于8GB，默认开启所有加速功能\n> \n> 运行本docker前可以通过以下命令检测自己的设备是否支持在docker上使用CUDA加速\n> \n> ```bash\n> docker run --rm --gpus=all nvidia/cuda:12.1.0-base-ubuntu22.04 nvidia-smi\n> ```\n  ```bash\n  wget https://gitee.com/myhloli/MinerU/raw/master/docker/china/Dockerfile -O Dockerfile\n  docker build -t mineru:latest .\n  docker run --rm -it --gpus=all mineru:latest /bin/bash -c \"echo 'source /opt/mineru_venv/bin/activate' >> ~/.bashrc && exec bash\"\n  magic-pdf --help\n  ```\n### 使用NPU\n\n如果您的设备存在NPU加速硬件，则可以通过以下教程使用NPU加速：\n\n[NPU加速教程](docs/README_Ascend_NPU_Acceleration_zh_CN.md)\n\n### 使用MPS\n如果您的设备使用Apple silicon 芯片，您可以在部分支持的任务（layout检测/公式检测）中开启mps加速：\n\n您可以通过在 `magic-pdf.json` 配置文件中将 `device-mode` 参数设置为 `mps` 来启用 MPS 加速。\n\n```json\n{\n    // other config\n    \"device-mode\": \"mps\"\n}\n```\n\n> [!TIP]\n> 由于公式识别任务无法开启mps加速，您可在不需要识别公式的任务关闭公式识别功能以获得最佳性能。\n>\n> 您可以通过将 `formula-config` 部分中的 `enable` 参数设置为 `false` 来禁用公式识别功能。\n\n\n## 使用\n\n### 命令行\n\n[通过命令行使用MinerU](https://mineru.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/usage/command_line.html)\n\n> [!TIP]\n> 更多有关输出文件的信息，请参考[输出文件说明](docs/output_file_zh_cn.md)\n\n### API\n\n[通过Python代码调用MinerU](https://mineru.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/usage/api.html)\n\n\n### 部署衍生项目\n\n衍生项目包含项目开发者和社群开发者们基于MinerU的二次开发项目，\n例如基于Gradio的应用界面、基于llama的RAG、官网同款web demo、轻量级的多卡负载均衡c/s端等，\n这些项目可能会提供更多的功能和更好的用户体验。\n具体部署方式请参考 [衍生项目readme](projects/README_zh-CN.md)\n\n\n### 二次开发\n\nTODO\n\n# TODO\n\n- [x] 基于模型的阅读顺序  \n- [x] 正文中目录、列表识别  \n- [x] 表格识别\n- [ ] 正文中代码块识别\n- [ ] [化学式识别](docs/chemical_knowledge_introduction/introduction.pdf)\n- [ ] 几何图形识别\n\n# Known Issues\n\n- 阅读顺序基于模型对可阅读内容在空间中的分布进行排序，在极端复杂的排版下可能会部分区域乱序\n- 不支持竖排文字\n- 目录和列表通过规则进行识别，少部分不常见的列表形式可能无法识别\n- 标题只有一级，目前不支持标题分级\n- 代码块在layout模型里还没有支持\n- 漫画书、艺术图册、小学教材、习题尚不能很好解析\n- 表格识别在复杂表格上可能会出现行/列识别错误\n- 在小语种PDF上，OCR识别可能会出现字符不准确的情况（如拉丁文的重音符号、阿拉伯文易混淆字符等）\n- 部分公式可能会无法在markdown中渲染\n\n#
