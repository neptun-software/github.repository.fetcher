Significance is further explained in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrdevFK_am4\">Yannic Kilcher's</a> video. There's really not much to code here, but may as well lay it out for everyone so we expedite the attention revolution.\n\nFor a Pytorch implementation with pretrained models, please see Ross Wightman's repository <a href=\"https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models\">here</a>.\n\nThe official Jax repository is <a href=\"https://github.com/google-research/vision_transformer\">here</a>.\n\nA tensorflow2 translation also exists <a href=\"https://github.com/taki0112/vit-tensorflow\">here</a>, created by research scientist <a href=\"https://github.com/taki0112\">Junho Kim</a>! üôè\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/conceptofmind/vit-flax\">Flax translation</a> by <a href=\"https://github.com/conceptofmind\">Enrico Shippole</a>!\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\n$ pip install vit-pytorch\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom vit_pytorch import ViT\n\nv = ViT(\n    image_size = 256,\n    patch_size = 32,\n    num_classes = 1000,\n    dim = 1024,\n    depth = 6,\n    heads = 16,\n    mlp_dim = 2048,\n    dropout = 0.1,\n    emb_dropout = 0.1\n)\n\nimg = torch.randn(1, 3, 256, 256)\n\npreds = v(img) # (1, 1000)\n```\n\n## Parameters\n\n- `image_size`: int.  \nImage size. If you have rectangular images, make sure your image size is the maximum of the width and height\n- `patch_size`: int.  \nSize of patches. `image_size` must be divisible by `patch_size`.  \nThe number of patches is: ` n = (image_size // patch_size) ** 2` and `n` **must be greater than 16**.\n- `num_classes`: int.  \nNumber of classes to classify.\n- `dim`: int.  \nLast dimension of output tensor after linear transformation `nn.Linear(..., dim)`.\n- `depth`: int.  \nNumber of Transformer blocks.\n- `heads`: int.  \nNumber of heads in Multi-head Attention layer. \n- `mlp_dim`: int.  \nDimension of the MLP (FeedForward) layer. \n- `channels`: int, default `3`.  \nNumber of image's channels. \n- `dropout`: float between `[0, 1]`, default `0.`.  \nDropout rate. \n- `emb_dropout`: float between `[0, 1]`, default `0`.  \nEmbedding dropout rate.\n- `pool`: string, either `cls` token pooling or `mean` pooling\n\n\n## Simple ViT\n\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01580\">An update</a> from some of the same authors of the original paper proposes simplifications to `ViT` that allows it to train faster and better.\n\nAmong these simplifications include 2d sinusoidal positional embedding, global average pooling (no CLS token), no dropout, batch sizes of 1024 rather than 4096, and use of RandAugment and MixUp augmentations. They also show that a simple linear at the end is not significantly worse than the original MLP head\n\nYou can use it by importing the `SimpleViT` as shown below\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom vit_pytorch import SimpleViT\n\nv = SimpleViT(\n    image_size = 256,\n    patch_size = 32,\n    num_classes = 1000,\n    dim = 1024,\n    depth = 6,\n    heads = 16,\n    mlp_dim = 2048\n)\n\nimg = torch.randn(1, 3, 256, 256)\n\npreds = v(img) # (1, 1000)\n```\n\n## NaViT\n\n<img src=\"./images/navit.png\" width=\"450px\"></img>\n\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06304\">This paper</a> proposes to leverage the flexibility of attention and masking for variable lengthed sequences to train images of multiple resolution, packed into a single batch. They demonstrate much faster training and improved accuracies, with the only cost being extra complexity in the architecture and dataloading. They use factorized 2d positional encodings, token dropping, as well as query-key normalization.\n\nYou can use it as follows\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom vit_pytorch.na_vit import NaViT\n\nv = NaViT(\n    image_size = 256,\n    patch_size = 32,\n    num_classes = 1000,\n    dim = 1024,\n    depth = 6,\n    heads = 16,\n    mlp_dim = 2048,\n    dropout = 0.1,\n    emb_dropout = 0.1,\n    token_dropout_prob = 0.1  # token dropout of 10% (keep 90% of tokens)\n)\n\n# 5 images of different resolutions - List[List[Tensor]]\n\n# for now, you'll have to correctly place images in same batch element as to not exceed maximum allowed sequence length for self-attention w/ masking\n\nimages = [\n    [torch.randn(3, 256, 256), torch.randn(3, 128, 128)],\n    [torch.randn(3, 128, 256), torch.randn(3, 256, 128)],\n    [torch.randn(3, 64, 256)]\n]\n\npreds = v(images) # (5, 1000) - 5, because 5 images of different resolution above\n\n```\n\nOr if you would rather that the framework auto group the images into variable lengthed sequences that do not exceed a certain max length\n\n```python\nimages = [\n    torch.randn(3, 256, 256),\n    torch.randn(3, 128, 128),\n    torch.randn(3, 128, 256),\n    torch.randn(3, 256, 128),\n    torch.randn(3, 64, 256)\n]\n\npreds = v(\n    images,\n    group_images = True,\n    group_max_seq_len = 64\n) # (5, 1000)\n```\n\nFinally, if you would like to make use of a flavor of NaViT using <a href=\"https://pytorch.org/tutorials/prototype/nestedtensor.html\">nested tensors</a> (which will omit a lot of the masking and padding altogether), make sure you are on version `2.5` and import as follows\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom vit_pytorch.na_vit_nested_tensor import NaViT\n\nv = NaViT(\n    image_size = 256,\n    patch_size = 32,\n    num_classes = 1000,\n    dim = 1024,\n    depth = 6,\n    heads = 16,\n    mlp_dim = 2048,\n    dropout = 0.,\n    emb_dropout = 0.,\n    token_dropout_prob = 0.1\n)\n\n# 5 images of different resolutions - List[Tensor]\n\nimages = [\n    torch.randn(3, 256, 256), torch.randn(3, 128, 128),\n    torch.randn(3, 128, 256), torch.randn(3, 256, 128),\n    torch.randn(3, 64, 256)\n]\n\npreds = v(images)\n\nassert preds.shape == (5, 1000)\n```\n\n## Distillation\n\n<img src=\"./images/distill.png\" width=\"300px\"></img>\n\nA recent <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12877\">paper</a> has shown that use of a distillation token for distilling knowledge from convolutional nets to vision transformer can yield small and efficient vision transformers. This repository offers the means to do distillation easily.\n\nex. distilling from Resnet50 (or any teacher) to a vision transformer\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom torchvision.models import resnet50\n\nfrom vit_pytorch.distill import DistillableViT, DistillWrapper\n\nteacher = resnet50(pretrained = True)\n\nv = DistillableViT(\n    image_size = 256,\n    patch_size = 32,\n    num_classes = 1000,\n    dim = 1024,\n    depth = 6,\n    heads = 8,\n    mlp_dim = 2048,\n    dropout = 0.1,\n    emb_dropout = 0.1\n)\n\ndistiller = DistillWrapper(\n    student = v,\n    teacher = teacher,\n    temperature = 3,           # temperature of distillation\n    alpha = 0.5,               # trade between main loss and distillation loss\n    hard = False               # whether to use soft or hard distillation\n)\n\nimg = torch.randn(2, 3, 256, 256)\nlabels = torch.randint(0, 1000, (2,))\n\nloss = distiller(img, labels)\nloss.backward()\n\n# after lots of training above ...\n\npred = v(img) # (2, 1000)\n```\n\nThe `DistillableViT` class is identical to `ViT` except for how the forward pass is handled, so you should be able to load the parameters back to `ViT` after you have completed distillation training.\n\nYou can also use the handy `.to_vit` method on the `DistillableViT` instance to get back a `ViT` instance.\n\n```python\nv = v.to_vit()\ntype(v) # <class 'vit_pytorch.vit_pytorch.ViT'>\n```\n\n\n## Deep ViT\n\nThis <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11886\">paper</a> notes that ViT struggles to attend at greater depths (past 12 layers), and suggests mixing the attention of each head post-softmax as a solution, dubbed Re-attention. The results line up with the <a href=\"https://github.com/lucidrains/x-transformers#talking-heads-attention\">Talking Heads</a> paper from NLP.\n\nYou can use it as follows\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom vit_pytorch.deepvit import DeepViT\n\nv = DeepViT(\n    image_size = 256,\n    patch_size = 32,\n    num_classes = 1000,\n    dim = 1024,\n    depth = 6,\n    heads = 16,\n    mlp_dim = 2048,\n    dropout = 0.1,\n    emb_dropout = 0.1\n)\n\nimg = torch.randn(1, 3, 256, 256)\n\npreds = v(img) # (1, 1000)\n```\n\n## CaiT\n\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.17239\">This paper</a> also notes difficulty in training vision transformers at greater depths and proposes two solutions. First it proposes to do per-channel multiplication of the output of the residual block. Second, it proposes to have the patches attend to one another, and only allow the CLS token to attend to the patches in the last few layers.\n\nThey also add <a href=\"https://github.com/lucidrains/x-transformers#talking-heads-attention\">Talking Heads</a>, noting improvements\n\nYou can use this scheme as follows\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom vit_pytorch.cait import CaiT\n\nv = CaiT(\n    image_size = 256,\n    patch_size = 32,\n    num_classes = 1000,\n    dim = 1024,\n    depth = 12,             # depth of transformer for patch to patch attention only\n    cls_depth = 2,          # depth of cross attention of CLS tokens to patch\n    heads = 16,\n    mlp_dim = 2048,\n    dropout = 0.1,\n    emb_dropout = 0.1,\n    layer_dropout = 0.05    # randomly dropout 5% of the layers\n)\n\nimg = torch.randn(1, 3, 256, 256)\n\npreds = v(img) # (1, 1000)\n```\n\n## Token-to-Token ViT\n\n<img src=\"./images/t2t.png\" width=\"400px\"></img>\n\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11986\">This paper</a> proposes that the first couple layers should downsample the image sequence by unfolding, leading to overlapping image data in each token as shown in the figure above. You can use this variant of the `ViT` as follows.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom vit_pytorch.t2t import T2TViT\n\nv = T2TViT(\n    dim = 512,\n    image_size = 224,\n    depth = 5,\n    heads = 8,\n    mlp_dim = 512,\n    num_classes = 1000,\n    t2t_layers = ((7, 4), (3, 2), (3, 2)) # tuples of the kernel size and stride of each consecutive layers of the initial token to token module\n)\n\nimg = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)\n\npreds = v(img) # (1, 1000)\n```\n\n## CCT\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SHI-Labs/Compact-Transformers/main/images/model_sym.png\" width=\"400px\"></img>\n\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05704\">CCT</a> proposes compact transformers\nby using convolutions instead of patching and performing sequence pooling. This\nallows for CCT to have high accuracy and a low number of parameters.\n\nYou can use this with two methods\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom vit_pytorch.cct import CCT\n\ncct = CCT(\n    img_size = (224, 448),\n    embedding_dim = 384,\n    n_conv_layers = 2,\n    kernel_size = 7,\n    stride = 2,\n    padding = 3,\n    pooling_kernel_size = 3,\n    pooling_stride = 2,\n    pooling_padding = 1,\n    num_layers = 14,\n    num_heads = 6,\n    mlp_ratio = 3.,\n    num_classes = 1000,\n    positional_embedding = 'learnable', # ['sine', 'learnable', 'none']\n)\n\nimg = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 448)\npred = cct(img) # (1, 1000)\n```\n\nAlternatively you can use one of several pre-defined models `[2,4,6,7,8,14,16]`\nwhich pre-define the number of layers, number of attention heads, the mlp ratio,\nand the embedding dimension.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom vit_pytorch.cct import cct_14\n\ncct = cct_14(\n    img_size = 224,\n    n_conv_layers = 1,\n    kernel_size = 7,\n    stride = 2,\n    padding = 3,\n    pooling_kernel_size = 3,\n    pooling_stride = 2,\n    pooling_padding = 1,\n    num_classes = 1000,\n    positional_embedding = 'learnable', # ['sine', 'learnable', 'none']\n)\n```\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/SHI-Labs/Compact-Transformers\">Official\nRepository</a> includes links to pretrained model checkpoints.\n\n## Cross ViT\n\n<img src=\"./images/cross_vit.png\" width=\"400px\"></img>\n\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14899\">This paper</a> proposes to have two vision transformers processing the image at different scales, cross attending to one every so often.

Fortunately, we have a lot of new techniques that may help. This repository offers a way for you to plugin your own sparse attention transformer.\n\nAn example with <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03902\">Nystromformer</a>\n\n```bash\n$ pip install nystrom-attention\n```\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom vit_pytorch.efficient import ViT\nfrom nystrom_attention import Nystromformer\n\nefficient_transformer = Nystromformer(\n    dim = 512,\n    depth = 12,\n    heads = 8,\n    num_landmarks = 256\n)\n\nv = ViT(\n    dim = 512,\n    image_size = 2048,\n    patch_size = 32,\n    num_classes = 1000,\n    transformer = efficient_transformer\n)\n\nimg = torch.randn(1, 3, 2048, 2048) # your high resolution picture\nv(img) # (1, 1000)\n```\n\nOther sparse attention frameworks I would highly recommend is <a href=\"https://github.com/lucidrains/routing-transformer\">Routing Transformer</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/lucidrains/sinkhorn-transformer\">Sinkhorn Transformer</a>\n\n### Combining with other Transformer improvements\n\nThis paper purposely used the most vanilla of attention networks to make a statement. If you would like to use some of the latest improvements for attention nets, please use the `Encoder` from <a href=\"https://github.com/lucidrains/x-transformers\">this repository</a>.\n\nex.\n\n```bash\n$ pip install x-transformers\n```\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom vit_pytorch.efficient import ViT\nfrom x_transformers import Encoder\n\nv = ViT(\n    dim = 512,\n    image_size = 224,\n    patch_size = 16,\n    num_classes = 1000,\n    transformer = Encoder(\n        dim = 512,                  # set to be the same as the wrapper\n        depth = 12,\n        heads = 8,\n        ff_glu = True,              # ex. feed forward GLU variant https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05202\n        residual_attn = True        # ex. residual attention https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11747\n    )\n)\n\nimg = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)\nv(img) # (1, 1000)\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n- How do I pass in non-square images?\n\nYou can already pass in non-square images - you just have to make sure your height and width is less than or equal to the `image_size`, and both divisible by the `patch_size`\n\nex.\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom vit_pytorch import ViT\n\nv = ViT(\n    image_size = 256,\n    patch_size = 32,\n    num_classes = 1000,\n    dim = 1024,\n    depth = 6,\n    heads = 16,\n    mlp_dim = 2048,\n    dropout = 0.1,\n    emb_dropout = 0.1\n)\n\nimg = torch.randn(1, 3, 256, 128) # <-- not a square\n\npreds = v(img) # (1, 1000)\n```\n\n- How do I pass in non-square patches?\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom vit_pytorch import ViT\n\nv = ViT(\n    num_classes = 1000,\n    image_size = (256, 128),  # image size is a tuple of (height, width)\n    patch_size = (32, 16),    # patch size is a tuple of (height, width)\n    dim = 1024,\n    depth = 6,\n    heads = 16,\n    mlp_dim = 2048,\n    dropout = 0.1,\n    emb_dropout = 0.1\n)\n\nimg = torch.randn(1, 3, 256, 128)\n\npreds = v(img)\n```\n\n## Resources\n\nComing from computer vision and new to transformers?
