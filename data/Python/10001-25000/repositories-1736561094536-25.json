          "content": "# Contributing\n\nThe Open-Sora project welcomes any constructive contribution from the community and the team is more than willing to work on problems you have encountered to make it a better project.\n\n## Development Environment Setup\n\nTo contribute to Open-Sora, we would like to first guide you to set up a proper development environment so that you can better implement your code. You can install this library from source with the `editable` flag (`-e`, for development mode) so that your change to the source code will be reflected in runtime without re-installation.\n\nYou can refer to the [Installation Section](./README.md#installation) and replace `pip install -v .` with `pip install -v -e .`.\n\n### Code Style\n\nWe have some static checks when you commit your code change, please make sure you can pass all the tests and make sure the coding style meets our requirements. We use pre-commit hook to make sure the code is aligned with the writing standard. To set up the code style checking, you need to follow the steps below.\n\n```shell\n# these commands are executed under the Open-Sora directory\npip install pre-commit\npre-commit install\n```\n\nCode format checking will be automatically executed when you commit your changes.\n\n## Contribution Guide\n\nYou need to follow these steps below to make contribution to the main repository via pull request. You can learn about the details of pull request [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).\n\n### 1. Fork the Official Repository\n\nFirstly, you need to visit the [Open-Sora repository](https://github.com/hpcaitech/Open-Sora) and fork into your own account. The `fork` button is at the right top corner of the web page alongside with buttons such as `watch` and `star`.\n\nNow, you can clone your own forked repository into your local environment.\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/<YOUR-USERNAME>/Open-Sora.git\n```\n\n### 2. Configure Git\n\nYou need to set the official repository as your upstream so that you can synchronize with the latest update in the official repository. You can learn about upstream [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-forks-and-upstreams).\n\nThen add the original repository as upstream\n\n```shell\ncd Open-Sora\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/hpcaitech/Open-Sora.git\n```\n\nyou can use the following command to verify that the remote is set. You should see both `origin` and `upstream` in the output.\n\n```shell\ngit remote -v\n```\n\n### 3. Synchronize with Official Repository\n\nBefore you make changes to the codebase, it is always good to fetch the latest updates in the official repository. In order to do so, you can use the commands below.\n\n```shell\ngit fetch upstream\ngit checkout main\ngit merge upstream/main\ngit push origin main\n```\n\n### 5. Create a New Branch\n\nYou should not make changes to the `main` branch of your forked repository as this might make upstream synchronization difficult. You can create a new branch with the appropriate name. General branch name format should start with `hotfix/` and `feature/`. `hotfix` is for bug fix and `feature` is for addition of a new feature.\n\n```shell\ngit checkout -b <NEW-BRANCH-NAME>\n```\n\n### 6. Implementation and Code Commit\n\nNow you can implement your code change in the source code. Remember that you installed the system in development, thus you do not need to uninstall and install to make the code take effect. The code change will be reflected in every new PyThon execution.\nYou can commit and push the changes to your local repository. The changes should be kept logical, modular and atomic.\n\n```shell\ngit add -A\ngit commit -m \"<COMMIT-MESSAGE>\"\ngit push -u origin <NEW-BRANCH-NAME>\n```\n\n### 7. Open a Pull Request\n\nYou can now create a pull request on the GitHub webpage of your repository. The source branch is `<NEW-BRANCH-NAME>` of your repository and the target branch should be `main` of `hpcaitech/Open-Sora`. After creating this pull request, you should be able to see it [here](https://github.com/hpcaitech/Open-Sora/pulls).\n\nThe Open-Sora team will review your code change and merge your code if applicable.\n\n## FQA\n\n1. `pylint` cannot recognize some members:\n\nAdd this into your `settings.json` in VSCode:\n\n```json\n\"pylint.args\": [\n \"--generated-members=numpy.* ,torch.*,cv2.*\",\n],\n```\n"

Creative Commons gives no\n   warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their\n   terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons\n   disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the\n   fullest extent possible.\n\n   Using Creative Commons Public Licenses\n\n   Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and\n   conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share\n   original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright\n   and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The\n   following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not\n   exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\n\n      Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are\n      intended for use by those authorized to give the public\n      permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by\n      copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are\n      irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms\n      and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.\n      Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before\n      applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the\n      material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any\n      material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-\n      licensed material, or material used under an exception or\n      limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:\n      wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors\n\n      Considerations for the public: By using one of our public\n      licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the\n      licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If\n      the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for\n      example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to\n      copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our\n      licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain\n      other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of\n      the licensed material may still be restricted for other\n      reasons, including because others have copyright or other\n      rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,\n      such as asking that all changes be marked or described.\n      Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to\n      respect those requests where reasonable.

To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a\n   contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your\n   acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You\n   such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from\n   making the Licensed Material available under these terms and\n   conditions.\n\n   Section 1 -- Definitions.\n\n   a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar\n      Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material\n      and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,\n      arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring\n      permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the\n      Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed\n      Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,\n      Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is\n      synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n\n   b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright\n      and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in\n      accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n   c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights\n      closely related to copyright including, without limitation,\n      performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database\n      Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or\n      categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights\n      specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar\n      Rights.\n   d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the\n      absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws\n      fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright\n      Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international\n      agreements.\n\n   e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or\n      any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights\n      that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\n   f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,\n      or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public\n      License.\n\n   g.

Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights\n      under this Public License.\n\n   i. NonCommercial means not primarily intended for or directed towards\n      commercial advantage or monetary compensation. For purposes of\n      this Public License, the exchange of the Licensed Material for\n      other material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights by digital\n      file-sharing or similar means is NonCommercial provided there is\n      no payment of monetary compensation in connection with the\n      exchange.\n\n   j. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or\n      process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such\n      as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,\n      dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material\n      available to the public including in ways that members of the\n      public may access the material from a place and at a time\n      individually chosen by them.\n\n   k. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright\n      resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of\n      the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,\n      as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially\n      equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\n\n   l. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights\n      under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\n\n   Section 2 -- Scope.\n\n   a. License grant.\n\n         1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\n            the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\n            non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\n            exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\n               a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\n                  in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and\n\n               b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for\n                  NonCommercial purposes only.\n\n         2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n            Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n            License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n            its terms and conditions.\n\n         3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n            6(a).\n\n         4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n            Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n            all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n            and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\n            Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n            authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n            necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n            technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n            Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n            simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n            (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n         5. Downstream recipients.\n\n               a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n                  recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n                  receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n                  Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n                  Public License.\n\n               b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n                  any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n                  apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n                  Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n                  Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n                  Material.\n\n         6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n            may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n            are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n            with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n            the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n            provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n   b. Other rights.\n\n         1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n            licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n            privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n            the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n            assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n            extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n            Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n         2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n            Public License.\n\n         3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n            collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n            Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n            under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n            licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n            reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when\n            the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial\n            purposes.\n\n   Section 3 -- License Conditions.\n\n   Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\n   following conditions.\n\n   a. Attribution.\n\n         1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n            form), You must:\n\n               a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n                  with the Licensed Material:\n\n                  i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                     Material and any others designated to receive\n                     attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                     the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                     designated);\n\n                  ii. a copyright notice;\n\n                  iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                  iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                     warranties;\n\n                  v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                     extent reasonably practicable;\n\n               b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n                  retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n               c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n                  Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n                  hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n         2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n            reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n            which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n            reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n            hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n            information.\n\n         3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n            information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n            reasonably practicable.\n\n         4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n            License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n            Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n   Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\n   Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\n   apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n   a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n      to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n      portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes\n      only;\n\n   b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n      contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n      Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n      Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\n   c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n      all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\n   For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\n   replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\n   Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n   Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n   a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n      EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n      AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n      ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n      IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n      WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n      PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n      ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n      KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n      ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n   b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n      TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n      NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n      INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n      COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n      USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n      ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n      DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n      IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n   c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n      above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n      possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n      waiver of all liability.\n\n   Section 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n   a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n      Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n      this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n      terminate automatically.\n\n   b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n      Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n         1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n            it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n            violation; or\n\n         2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n      For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n      right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n      of this Public License.\n\n   c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n      Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n      distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n      will not terminate this Public License.\n\n   d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n      License.\n\n   Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n   a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n      terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n   b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n      Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n      independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n   Section 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n   a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n      shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n      conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n      be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n   b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n      deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n      minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n      cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n      without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n      conditions.\n\n   c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n      failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n      Licensor.\n\n   d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n      as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n      that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n      processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n   =======================================================================\n\n   Creative Commons is not a party to its public\n   licenses.

Model weights are available [here](#model-weights). See our **[report 1.2](/docs/report_03.md)** for more details.\n- ✅ Support rectified flow scheduling.\n- ✅ Support more conditioning including fps, aesthetic score, motion strength and camera motion.\n- ✅ Trained our 3D-VAE for temporal dimension compression.\n- 📍 **Open-Sora 1.1** released. Model weights are available [here](#model-weights). It is trained on **0s~15s, 144p to 720p, various aspect ratios** videos. See our **[report 1.1](/docs/report_02.md)** for more discussions.\n- 🔧 **Data processing pipeline v1.1** is released. An automatic [processing pipeline](#data-processing) from raw videos to (text, video clip) pairs is provided, including scene cutting $\\rightarrow$ filtering(aesthetic, optical flow, OCR, etc.) $\\rightarrow$ captioning $\\rightarrow$ managing. With this tool, you can easily build your video dataset.\n\n<details>\n<summary>View more</summary>\n\n- ✅ Improved ST-DiT architecture includes rope positional encoding, qk norm, longer text length, etc.\n- ✅ Support training with any resolution, aspect ratio, and duration (including images).\n- ✅ Support image and video conditioning and video editing, and thus support animating images, connecting videos, etc.\n- 📍 **Open-Sora 1.0** released. Model weights are available [here](#model-weights). With only 400K video clips and 200 H800\n  days (compared with 152M samples in Stable Video Diffusion), we are able to generate 2s 512×512 videos. See our **[report 1.0](docs/report_01.md)** for more discussions.\n- ✅ Three-stage training from an image diffusion model to a video diffusion model. We provide the weights for each\n  stage.\n- ✅ Support training acceleration including accelerated transformer, faster T5 and VAE, and sequence parallelism.\n  Open-Sora improves **55%** training speed when training on 64x512x512 videos. Details locates\n  at [acceleration.md](docs/acceleration.md).\n- 🔧 **Data preprocessing pipeline v1.0**,\n  including [downloading](tools/datasets/README.md), [video cutting](tools/scene_cut/README.md),\n  and [captioning](tools/caption/README.md) tools. Our data collection plan can be found\n  at [datasets.md](docs/datasets.md).\n- ✅ We find VQ-VAE from [VideoGPT](https://wilson1yan.github.io/videogpt/index.html) has a low quality and thus adopt a\n  better VAE from [Stability-AI](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sd-vae-ft-mse-original). We also find patching in\n  the time dimension deteriorates the quality. See our **[report](docs/report_01.md)** for more discussions.\n- ✅ We investigate different architectures including DiT, Latte, and our proposed STDiT. Our **STDiT** achieves a better\n  trade-off between quality and speed. See our **[report](docs/report_01.md)** for more discussions.\n- ✅ Support clip and T5 text conditioning.\n- ✅ By viewing images as one-frame videos, our project supports training DiT on both images and videos (e.g., ImageNet &\n  UCF101). See [commands.md](docs/commands.md) for more instructions.\n- ✅ Support inference with official weights\n  from [DiT](https://github.com/facebookresearch/DiT), [Latte](https://github.com/Vchitect/Latte),\n  and [PixArt](https://pixart-alpha.github.io/).\n- ✅ Refactor the codebase. See [structure.md](docs/structure.md) to learn the project structure and how to use the\n  config files.\n\n</details>\n\n### TODO list sorted by priority\n\n<details>\n<summary>View more</summary>\n\n- [x] Training Video-VAE and adapt our model to new VAE.\n- [x] Scaling model parameters and dataset size.\n- [x] Incoporate a better scheduler (rectified flow).\n- [x] Evaluation pipeline.\n- [x] Complete the data processing pipeline (including dense optical flow, aesthetics scores, text-image similarity, etc.).

The number of\nparameters is 724M. More information about training can be found in our **[report](/docs/report_01.md)**. More about\nthe dataset can be found in [datasets.md](/docs/datasets.md). HQ means high quality.\n\n:warning: **LIMITATION**: Our model is trained on a limited budget. The quality and text alignment is relatively poor.\nThe model performs badly, especially on generating human beings and cannot follow detailed instructions. We are working\non improving the quality and text alignment.\n\n</details>\n\n## Gradio Demo\n\n🔥 You can experience Open-Sora on our [🤗 Gradio application](https://huggingface.co/spaces/hpcai-tech/open-sora) on Hugging Face online.\n\n### Local Deployment\n\nIf you want to deploy gradio locally, we have also provided a [Gradio application](./gradio) in this repository, you can use the following the command to start an interactive web application to experience video generation with Open-Sora.\n\n```bash\npip install gradio spaces\npython gradio/app.py\n```\n\nThis will launch a Gradio application on your localhost. If you want to know more about the Gradio applicaiton, you can refer to the [Gradio README](./gradio/README.md).\n\nTo enable prompt enhancement and other language input (e.g., 中文输入), you need to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the environment. Check [OpenAI's documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart) to get your API key.\n\n```bash\nexport OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY\n```\n\n### Getting Started\n\nIn the Gradio application, the basic options are as follows:\n\n![Gradio Demo](assets/readme/gradio_basic.png)\n\nThe easiest way to generate a video is to input a text prompt and click the \"**Generate video**\" button (scroll down if you cannot find). The generated video will be displayed in the right panel. Checking the \"**Enhance prompt with GPT4o**\" will use GPT-4o to refine the prompt, while \"**Random Prompt**\" button will generate a random prompt by GPT-4o for you. Due to the OpenAI's API limit, the prompt refinement result has some randomness.\n\nThen, you can choose the **resolution**, **duration**, and **aspect ratio** of the generated video. Different resolution and video length will affect the video generation speed. On a 80G H100 GPU, the generation speed (with `num_sampling_step=30`) and peak memory usage is:\n\n|      | Image   | 2s       | 4s        | 8s        | 16s       |\n|------|---------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| 360p | 3s, 24G | 18s, 27G | 31s, 27G  | 62s, 28G  | 121s, 33G |\n| 480p | 2s, 24G | 29s, 31G | 55s, 30G  | 108s, 32G | 219s, 36G |\n| 720p | 6s, 27G | 68s, 41G | 130s, 39G | 260s, 45G | 547s, 67G |\n\nNote that besides text to video, you can also use **image to video generation**. You can upload an image and then click the \"**Generate video**\" button to generate a video with the image as the first frame. Or you can fill in the text prompt and click the \"**Generate image**\" button to generate an image with the text prompt, and then click the \"**Generate video**\" button to generate a video with the image generated with the same model.\n\n![Gradio Demo](assets/readme/gradio_option.png)\n\nThen you can specify more options, including \"**Motion Strength**\", \"**Aesthetic**\" and \"**Camera Motion**\". If \"Enable\" not checked or the choice is \"none\", the information is not passed to the model. Otherwise, the model will generate videos with the specified motion strength, aesthetic score, and camera motion.\n\nFor the **aesthetic score**, we recommend using values higher than 6. For **motion strength**, a smaller value will lead to a smoother but less dynamic video, while a larger value will lead to a more dynamic but likely more blurry video. Thus, you can try without it and then adjust it according to the generated video. For the **camera motion**, sometimes the model cannot follow the instruction well, and we are working on improving it.\n\nYou can also adjust the \"**Sampling steps**\", this is directly related to the generation speed as it is the number of denoising. A number smaller than 30 usually leads to a poor generation results, while a number larger than 100 usually has no significant improvement. The \"**Seed**\" is used for reproducibility, you can set it to a fixed number to generate the same video. The \"**CFG Scale**\" controls how much the model follows the text prompt, a smaller value will lead to a more random video, while a larger value will lead to a more text-following video (7 is recommended).\n\nFor more advanced usage, you can refer to [Gradio README](./gradio/README.md#advanced-usage).\n\n## Inference\n\n### Open-Sora 1.2 Command Line Inference\n\nThe basic command line inference is as follows:\n\n```bash\n# text to video\npython scripts/inference.py configs/opensora-v1-2/inference/sample.py \\\n  --num-frames 4s --resolution 720p --aspect-ratio 9:16 \\\n  --prompt \"a beautiful waterfall\"\n```\n\nYou can add more options to the command line to customize the generation.\n\n```bash\npython scripts/inference.py configs/opensora-v1-2/inference/sample.py \\\n  --num-frames 4s --resolution 720p --aspect-ratio 9:16 \\\n  --num-sampling-steps 30 --flow 5 --aes 6.5 \\\n  --prompt \"a beautiful waterfall\"\n```\n\nFor image to video generation and other functionalities, the API is compatible with Open-Sora 1.1. See [here](docs/commands.md) for more instructions.\n\nIf your installation do not contain `apex` and `flash-attn`, you need to disable them in the config file, or via the folowing command.\n\n```bash\npython scripts/inference.py configs/opensora-v1-2/inference/sample.py \\\n  --num-frames 4s --resolution 720p \\\n  --layernorm-kernel False --flash-attn False \\\n  --prompt \"a beautiful waterfall\"\n```\n\n### Sequence Parallelism Inference\n\nTo enable sequence parallelism, you need to use `torchrun` to run the inference script. The following command will run the inference with 2 GPUs.\n\n```bash\n# text to video\nCUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 torchrun --nproc_per_node 2 scripts/inference.py configs/opensora-v1-2/inference/sample.py \\\n  --num-frames 4s --resolution 720p --aspect-ratio 9:16 \\\n  --prompt \"a beautiful waterfall\"\n```\n\n:warning: **LIMITATION**: The sequence parallelism is not supported for gradio deployment. For now, the sequence parallelism is only supported when the dimension can be divided by the number of GPUs. Thus, it may fail for some cases. We tested 4 GPUs for 720p and 2 GPUs for 480p.\n\n### GPT-4o Prompt Refinement\n\nWe find that GPT-4o can refine the prompt and improve the quality of the generated video. With this feature, you can also use other language (e.g., Chinese) as the prompt. To enable this feature, you need prepare your openai api key in the environment:\n\n```bash\nexport OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY\n```\n\nThen you can inference with `--llm-refine True` to enable the GPT-4o prompt refinement, or leave prompt empty to get a random prompt generated by GPT-4o.\n\n```bash\npython scripts/inference.py configs/opensora-v1-2/inference/sample.py \\\n  --num-frames 4s --resolution 720p --llm-refine True\n```\n\n### Open-Sora 1.1 Command Line Inference\n\n<details>\n<summary>View more</summary>\n\nSince Open-Sora 1.1 supports inference with dynamic input size, you can pass the input size as an argument.\n\n```bash\n# text to video\npython scripts/inference.py configs/opensora-v1-1/inference/sample.py --prompt \"A beautiful sunset over the city\" --num-frames 32 --image-size 480 854\n```\n\nIf your installation do not contain `apex` and `flash-attn`, you need to disable them in the config file, or via the folowing command.\n\n```bash\npython scripts/inference.py configs/opensora-v1-1/inference/sample.py --prompt \"A beautiful sunset over the city\" --num-frames 32 --image-size 480 854 --layernorm-kernel False --flash-attn False\n```\n\nSee [here](docs/commands.md#inference-with-open-sora-11) for more instructions including text-to-image, image-to-video, video-to-video, and infinite time generation.\n\n</details>\n\n### Open-Sora 1.0 Command Line Inference\n\n<details>\n<summary>View more</summary>\n\nWe have also provided an offline inference script. Run the following commands to generate samples, the required model weights will be automatically downloaded. To change sampling prompts, modify the txt file passed to `--prompt-path`. See [here](docs/structure.md#inference-config-demos) to customize the configuration.\n\n```bash\n# Sample 16x512x512 (20s/sample, 100 time steps, 24 GB memory)\ntorchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node 1 scripts/inference.py configs/opensora/inference/16x512x512.py --ckpt-path OpenSora-v1-HQ-16x512x512.pth --prompt-path ./assets/texts/t2v_samples.txt\n\n# Sample 16x256x256 (5s/sample, 100 time steps, 22 GB memory)\ntorchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node 1 scripts/inference.py configs/opensora/inference/16x256x256.py --ckpt-path OpenSora-v1-HQ-16x256x256.pth --prompt-path ./assets/texts/t2v_samples.txt\n\n# Sample 64x512x512 (40s/sample, 100 time steps)\ntorchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node 1 scripts/inference.py configs/opensora/inference/64x512x512.py --ckpt-path ./path/to/your/ckpt.pth --prompt-path ./assets/texts/t2v_samples.txt\n\n# Sample 64x512x512 with sequence parallelism (30s/sample, 100 time steps)\n# sequence parallelism is enabled automatically when nproc_per_node is larger than 1\ntorchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node 2 scripts/inference.py configs/opensora/inference/64x512x512.py --ckpt-path ./path/to/your/ckpt.pth --prompt-path ./assets/texts/t2v_samples.txt\n```\n\nThe speed is tested on H800 GPUs. For inference with other models, see [here](docs/commands.md) for more instructions.\nTo lower the memory usage, set a smaller `vae.micro_batch_size` in the config (slightly lower sampling speed).\n\n</details>\n\n## Data Processing\n\nHigh-quality data is crucial for training good generation models.\nTo this end, we establish a complete pipeline for data processing, which could seamlessly convert raw videos to high-quality video-text pairs.\nThe pipeline is shown below. For detailed information, please refer to [data processing](docs/data_processing.md).\nAlso check out the [datasets](docs/datasets.md) we use.\n\n![Data Processing Pipeline](assets/readme/report_data_pipeline.png)\n\n## Training\n\n### Open-Sora 1.2 Training\n\nThe training process is same as Open-Sora 1.1.\n\n```bash\n# If you use async checkpoint saving, and you want to validate the integrity of checkpoints, you can use the following command\n# Then there will be a `async_file_io.log` in checkpoint directory. If the number of lines of the log file is not equal to the number of checkpoints (.safetensors files), there may be some errors.\nexport TENSORNVME_DEBUG=1\n# one node\ntorchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node 8 scripts/train.py \\\n    configs/opensora-v1-2/train/stage1.py --data-path YOUR_CSV_PATH --ckpt-path YOUR_PRETRAINED_CKPT\n# multiple nodes\ncolossalai run --nproc_per_node 8 --hostfile hostfile scripts/train.py \\\n    configs/opensora-v1-2/train/stage1.py --data-path YOUR_CSV_PATH --ckpt-path YOUR_PRETRAINED_CKPT\n```\n\n### Open-Sora 1.1 Training\n\n<details>\n<summary>View more</summary>\n\nOnce you prepare the data in a `csv` file, run the following commands to launch training on a single node.\n\n```bash\n# one node\ntorchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node 8 scripts/train.py \\\n    configs/opensora-v1-1/train/stage1.py --data-path YOUR_CSV_PATH --ckpt-path YOUR_PRETRAINED_CKPT\n# multiple nodes\ncolossalai run --nproc_per_node 8 --hostfile hostfile scripts/train.py \\\n    configs/opensora-v1-1/train/stage1.py --data-path YOUR_CSV_PATH --ckpt-path YOUR_PRETRAINED_CKPT\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Open-Sora 1.0 Training\n\n<details>\n<summary>View more</summary>\n\nOnce you prepare the data in a `csv` file, run the following commands to launch training on a single node.\n\n```bash\n# 1 GPU, 16x256x256\ntorchrun --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=1 scripts/train.py configs/opensora/train/16x256x256.py --data-path YOUR_CSV_PATH\n# 8 GPUs, 64x512x512\ntorchrun --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=8 scripts/train.py configs/opensora/train/64x512x512.py --data-path YOUR_CSV_PATH --ckpt-path YOUR_PRETRAINED_CKPT\n```\n\nTo launch training on multiple nodes, prepare a hostfile according\nto [ColossalAI](https://colossalai.org/docs/basics/launch_colossalai/#launch-with-colossal-ai-cli), and run the\nfollowing commands.\n\n```bash\ncolossalai run --nproc_per_node 8 --hostfile hostfile scripts/train.py configs/opensora/train/64x512x512.py --data-path YOUR_CSV_PATH --ckpt-path YOUR_PRETRAINED_CKPT\n```\n\nFor training other models and advanced usage, see [here](docs/commands.md) for more instructions.\n\n</details>\n\n## Evaluation\n\nWe support evaluation based on:\n\n- Validation loss\n- [VBench](https://github.com/Vchitect/VBench/tree/master) score\n- VBench-i2v score\n- Batch generation for human evaluation\n\nAll the evaluation code is released in `eval` folder. Check the [README](/eval/README.md) for more details. Our [report](/docs/report_03.md#evaluation) also provides more information about the evaluation during training. The following table shows Open-Sora 1.2 greatly improves Open-Sora 1.0.\n\n| Model          | Total Score | Quality Score | Semantic Score |\n|----------------|-------------|---------------|----------------|\n| Open-Sora V1.0 | 75.91%      | 78.81%        | 64.28%         |\n| Open-Sora V1.2 | 79.23%      | 80.71%        | 73.30%         |\n\n## VAE Training & Evaluation\n\nWe train a VAE pipeline that consists of a spatial VAE followed by a temporal VAE.\nFor more details, refer to [VAE Documentation](docs/vae.md).\nBefore you run the following commands, follow our [Installation Documentation](docs/installation.md) to install the required dependencies for VAE and Evaluation.\n\nIf you want to train your own VAE, we need to prepare data in the csv following the [data processing](#data-processing) pipeline, then run the following commands.\nNote that you need to adjust the number of trained epochs (`epochs`) in the config file accordingly with respect to your own csv data size.\n\n```bash\n# stage 1 training, 380k steps, 8 GPUs\ntorchrun --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=8 scripts/train_vae.py configs/vae/train/stage1.py --data-path YOUR_CSV_PATH\n# stage 2 training, 260k steps, 8 GPUs\ntorchrun --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=8 scripts/train_vae.py configs/vae/train/stage2.py --data-path YOUR_CSV_PATH\n# stage 3 training, 540k steps, 24 GPUs\ntorchrun --nnodes=3 --nproc_per_node=8 scripts/train_vae.py configs/vae/train/stage3.py --data-path YOUR_CSV_PATH\n```\n\nTo evaluate the VAE performance, you need to run VAE inference first to generate the videos, then calculate scores on the generated videos:\n\n```bash\n# video generation\ntorchrun --standalone --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=1 scripts/inference_vae.py configs/vae/inference/video.py --ckpt-path YOUR_VAE_CKPT_PATH --data-path YOUR_CSV_PATH --save-dir YOUR_VIDEO_DIR\n# the original videos will be saved to `YOUR_VIDEO_DIR_ori`\n# the reconstructed videos through the pipeline will be saved to `YOUR_VIDEO_DIR_rec`\n# the reconstructed videos through the spatial VAE only will be saved to `YOUR_VIDEO_DIR_spatial`\n\n# score calculation\npython eval/vae/eval_common_metric.py --batch_size 2 --real_video_dir YOUR_VIDEO_DIR_ori --generated_video_dir YOUR_VIDEO_DIR_rec --device cuda --sample_fps 24 --crop_size 256 --resolution 256 --num_frames 17 --sample_rate 1 --metric ssim psnr lpips flolpips\n```\n\n## Contribution\n\nThanks goes to these wonderful contributors:\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/hpcaitech/Open-Sora/graphs/contributors\">\n  <img src=\"https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=hpcaitech/Open-Sora\" />\n</a>\n\nIf you wish to contribute to this project, please refer to the [Contribution Guideline](./CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nHere we only list a few of the projects.
