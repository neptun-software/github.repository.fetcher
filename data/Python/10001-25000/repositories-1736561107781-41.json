It is likely someone else has found the problem you're seeing, and someone may be working on or have already contributed a fix!\n\nIf no existing item describes your issue/feature, great - please file a new issue:\n\n### File a new Issue\n\n- Don't know whether you're reporting an issue or requesting a feature? File an issue\n- Have a question that you don't see answered in docs, videos, etc.? File an issue\n- Want to know if we're planning on building a particular feature? File an issue\n- Got a great idea for a new feature? File an issue/request/idea\n- Don't understand how to do something? File an issue\n- Found an existing issue that describes yours? Great - upvote and add additional commentary / info / repro-steps / etc.\n\nIf from the previous guide you find yourself in the need of file an Issue please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/microsoft/graphrag/issues).\nProvide as much detail as possible to help us understand and address the problem.\n\n### Add information\n\n**Complete the new Issue form, providing as much information as possible**. The more information you provide, the more likely your issue/ask will be understood and implemented. Helpful information includes:\n\n- What device you're running (inc. CPU type, memory, disk, etc.)\n- What OS your device is running\n- What tools and apps you're using (e.g. VS 2022, VSCode, etc.)\n- **We LOVE detailed repro steps!** What steps do we need to take to reproduce the issue? Assume we love to read repro steps. As much detail as you can stand is probably _barely_ enough detail for us!\n- Prefer error message text where possible or screenshots of errors if text cannot be captured\n- **If you intend to implement the fix/feature yourself then say so!** If you do not indicate otherwise we will assume that the issue is our to solve, or may label the issue as `Help-Wanted`.\n\n### DO NOT post \"+1\" comments\n\n> ⚠ DO NOT post \"+1\", \"me too\", or similar comments - they just add noise to an issue.\n\nIf you don't have any additional info/context to add but would like to indicate that you're affected by the issue, upvote the original issue by clicking its [+😊] button and hitting 👍 (+1) icon. This way we can actually measure how impactful an issue is.\n\n---\n\n## Thank you\n\nWe appreciate your contributions to GraphRAG!\n"

Our CI/CD pipeline checks that all PR's include a json file generated by semversioner. When submitting a PR, please run:\n```shell\npoetry run semversioner add-change -t patch -d \"<a small sentence describing changes made>.\"\n```\n\n# Azurite\n\nSome unit and smoke tests use Azurite to emulate Azure resources. This can be started by running:\n\n```sh\n./scripts/start-azurite.sh\n```\n\nor by simply running `azurite` in the terminal if already installed globally. See the [Azurite documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azurite) for more information about how to install and use Azurite.\n\n# Lifecycle Scripts\n\nOur Python package utilizes Poetry to manage dependencies and [poethepoet](https://pypi.org/project/poethepoet/) to manage custom build scripts.\n\nAvailable scripts are:\n- `poetry run poe index` - Run the Indexing CLI\n- `poetry run poe query` - Run the Query CLI\n- `poetry build` - This invokes `poetry build`, which will build a wheel file and other distributable artifacts.\n- `poetry run poe test` - This will execute all tests.\n- `poetry run poe test_unit` - This will execute unit tests.\n- `poetry run poe test_integration` - This will execute integration tests.\n- `poetry run poe test_smoke` - This will execute smoke tests.\n- `poetry run poe check` - This will perform a suite of static checks across the package, including:\n  - formatting\n  - documentation formatting\n  - linting\n  - security patterns\n  - type-checking\n- `poetry run poe fix` - This will apply any available auto-fixes to the package. Usually this is just formatting fixes.\n- `poetry run poe fix_unsafe` - This will apply any available auto-fixes to the package, including those that may be unsafe.\n- `poetry run poe format` - Explicitly run the formatter across the package.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### \"RuntimeError: llvm-config failed executing, please point LLVM_CONFIG to the path for llvm-config\" when running poetry install\n\nMake sure llvm-9 and llvm-9-dev are installed:\n\n`sudo apt-get install llvm-9 llvm-9-dev`\n\nand then in your bashrc, add\n\n`export LLVM_CONFIG=/usr/bin/llvm-config-9`\n\n### \"numba/\\_pymodule.h:6:10: fatal error: Python.h: No such file or directory\" when running poetry install\n\nMake sure you have python3.10-dev installed or more generally `python<version>-dev`\n\n`sudo apt-get install python3.10-dev`\n\n### LLM call constantly exceeds TPM, RPM or time limits\n\n`GRAPHRAG_LLM_THREAD_COUNT` and `GRAPHRAG_EMBEDDING_THREAD_COUNT` are both set to 50 by default. You can modify this values\nto reduce concurrency. Please refer to the [Configuration Documents](https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/config/overview/)\n"

          "content": "# GraphRAG: Responsible AI FAQ \n\n## What is GraphRAG? \n\nGraphRAG is an AI-based content interpretation and search capability. Using LLMs, it parses data to create a knowledge graph and answer user questions about a user-provided private dataset. \n\n## What can GraphRAG do?  \n\nGraphRAG is able to connect information across large volumes of information and use these connections to answer questions that are difficult or impossible to answer using keyword and vector-based search mechanisms. Building on the previous question, provide semi-technical, high-level information on how the system offers functionality for various uses.  This lets a system using GraphRAG to answer questions where the answers span many documents as well as thematic questions such as “what are the top themes in this dataset?.”\n\n## What are GraphRAG’s intended use(s)? \n\n* GraphRAG is intended to support critical information discovery and analysis use cases where the information required to arrive at a useful insight spans many documents, is noisy, is mixed with mis and/or dis-information, or when the questions users aim to answer are more abstract or thematic than the underlying data can directly answer. \n* GraphRAG is designed to be used in settings where users are already trained on responsible analytic approaches and critical reasoning is expected. GraphRAG is capable of providing high degrees of insight on complex information topics, however human analysis by a domain expert of the answers is needed in order to verify and augment GraphRAG’s generated responses. \n* GraphRAG is intended to be deployed and used with a domain specific corpus of text data. GraphRAG itself does not collect user data, but users are encouraged to verify data privacy policies of the chosen LLM used to configure GraphRAG. \n\n## How was GraphRAG evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance? \n\nGraphRAG has been evaluated in multiple ways.  The primary concerns are 1) accurate representation of the data set, 2) providing transparency and  groundedness of responses, 3) resilience to prompt and data corpus injection attacks, and 4) low hallucination rates.  Details on how each of these has been evaluated is outlined below by number. \n\n1) Accurate representation of the dataset has been tested by both manual inspection and automated testing against a “gold answer” that is created from randomly selected subsets of a test corpus. \n\n2) Transparency and groundedness of responses is tested via automated answer coverage evaluation and human inspection of the underlying context returned.  \n\n3) We test both user prompt injection attacks (“jailbreaks”) and cross prompt injection attacks (“data attacks”) using manual and semi-automated techniques. \n\n4) Hallucination rates are evaluated using claim coverage metrics, manual inspection of answer and source, and adversarial attacks to attempt a forced hallucination through adversarial and exceptionally challenging datasets. \n\n## What are the limitations of GraphRAG? How can users minimize the impact of GraphRAG’s limitations when using the system? \n\nGraphRAG depends on a well-constructed indexing examples.  For general applications (e.g. content oriented around people, places, organizations, things, etc.) we provide example indexing prompts. For unique datasets effective indexing can depend on proper identification of domain-specific concepts.   \n\nIndexing is a relatively expensive operation; a best practice to mitigate indexing is to create a small test dataset in the target domain to ensure indexer performance prior to large indexing operations. \n\n## What operational factors and settings allow for effective and responsible use of GraphRAG? \n\nGraphRAG is designed for use by users with domain sophistication and experience working through difficult information challenges.  While the approach is generally robust to injection attacks and identifying conflicting sources of information, the system is designed for trusted users. Proper human analysis of responses is important to generate reliable insights, and the provenance of information should be traced to ensure human agreement with the inferences made as part of the answer generation. \n\nGraphRAG yields the most effective results on natural language text data that is collectively focused on an overall topic or theme, and that is entity rich – entities being people, places, things, or objects that can be uniquely identified. \n\nWhile GraphRAG has been evaluated for its resilience to prompt and data corpus injection attacks, and has been probed for specific types of harms, the LLM that the user configures with GraphRAG may produce inappropriate or offensive content, which may make it inappropriate to deploy for sensitive contexts without additional mitigations that are specific to the use case and model. Developers should assess outputs for their context and use available safety classifiers, model specific safety filters and features (such as https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/ai-content-safety), or custom solutions appropriate for their use case.

          "content": "# GraphRAG Data Model and Config Breaking Changes\n\nAs we worked toward a cleaner codebase, data model, and configuration for the v1 release, we made a few changes that can break older indexes. During the development process we left shims in place to account for these changes, so that all old indexes will work up until v1.0. However, with the release of 1.0 we are removing these shims to allow the codebase to move forward without the legacy code elements. We are providing a migration notebook so this process should be fairly painless for most users:\n\n1. Rename or move your settings.yml file to back it up.\n2. Re-run `graphrag init` to generate a new default settings.yml.\n3. Open your old settings.yml and copy any critical settings that you changed. For most people this is likely only the LLM and embedding config.\n4. Run the notebook here: [./docs/examples_notebooks/index_migration.ipynb]()\n\nNote that one of the new requirements is that we write embeddings to a vector store during indexing. By default, this uses a local lancedb instance. When you re-generate the default config, a block will be added to reflect this. If you need to write to Azure AI Search instead, we recommend updating these settings before you index, so you don't need to do a separate vector ingest.\n\nAll of the breaking changes listed below are accounted for in the four steps above.\n\n## Updated data model\n\n- We have streamlined the data model of the index in a few small ways to align tables more consistently and remove redundant content. Notably:\n    - Consistent use of `id` and `human_readable_id` across all tables; this also insures all int IDs are actually saved as ints and never strings\n    - Alignment of fields from `create_final_entities` (such as name -> title) with `create_final_nodes`, and removal of redundant content across these tables\n    - Rename of `document.raw_content` to `document.text`\n    - Rename of `entity.name` to `entity.title`\n    - Rename `rank` to `combined_degree` in `create_final_relationships` and removal of `source_degree` and `target_degree`fields\n    - Fixed community tables to use a proper UUID for the `id` field, and retain `community` and `human_readable_id` for the short IDs\n    - Removal of all embeddings columns from parquet files in favor of direct vector store writes\n\n### Migration\n\n- Run a new index, leveraging existing cache.\n\n## New required Embeddings\n\n### Change\n\n- Added new required embeddings for `DRIFTSearch` and base RAG capabilities.\n\n### Migration\n\n- Run a new index, leveraging existing cache.\n\n## Vector Store required by default\n\n### Change\n\n- Vector store is now required by default for all search methods.\n\n### Migration\n\n- Run graphrag init command to generate a new settings.yaml file with the vector store configuration.\n- Run a new index, leveraging existing cache.\n\n## Deprecate timestamp paths\n\n### Change\n\n- Remove support for timestamp paths, those using `${timestamp}` directory nesting.\n- Use the same directory for storage output and reporting output.\n\n### Migration\n\n- Ensure output directories no longer use `${timestamp}` directory nesting.\n\n**Using Environment Variables**\n\n- Ensure `GRAPHRAG_STORAGE_BASE_DIR` is set to a static directory, e.g., `output` instead of `output/${timestamp}/artifacts`.\n- Ensure `GRAPHRAG_REPORTING_BASE_DIR` is set to a static directory, e.g., `output` instead of `output/${timestamp}/reports`\n\n[Full docs on using environment variables for configuration](https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/config/env_vars/).\n\n**Using Configuration File**\n\n```yaml\n# rest of settings.yaml file\n# ...\n\nstorage:\n  type: file\n  base_dir: \"output\" # changed from \"output/${timestamp}/artifacts\"\n\nreporting:\n  type: file\n  base_dir: \"output\" # changed from \"output/${timestamp}/reports\"\n```\n\n[Full docs on using YAML files for configuration](https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/config/yaml/).\n"
