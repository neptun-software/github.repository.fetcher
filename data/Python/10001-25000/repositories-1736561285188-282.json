Feel free to open an issue or a pull request!\n\n# pytube\n\n*pytube* is a genuine, lightweight, dependency-free Python library (and command-line utility) for downloading YouTube videos.\n\n## Documentation\n\nDetailed documentation about the usage of the library can be found at [pytube.io](https://pytube.io). This is recommended for most cases. If you want to hastily download a single video, the [quick start](#Quickstart) guide below might be what you're looking for.\n\n## Description\n\nYouTube is the most popular video-sharing platform in the world and as a hacker, you may encounter a situation where you want to script something to download videos. For this, I present to you: *pytube*.\n\n*pytube* is a lightweight library written in Python. It has no third-party\ndependencies and aims to be highly reliable.\n\n*pytube* also makes pipelining easy, allowing you to specify callback functions for different download events, such as  ``on progress`` or ``on complete``.\n\nFurthermore, *pytube* includes a command-line utility, allowing you to download videos right from the terminal.\n\n## Features\n\n- Support for both progressive & DASH streams\n- Support for downloading the complete playlist\n- Easily register ``on_download_progress`` & ``on_download_complete`` callbacks\n- Command-line interfaced included\n- Caption track support\n- Outputs caption tracks to .srt format (SubRip Subtitle)\n- Ability to capture thumbnail URL\n- Extensively documented source code\n- No third-party dependencies\n\n## Quickstart\n\nThis guide covers the most basic usage of the library. For more detailed information, please refer to [pytube.io](https://pytube.io).\n\n### Installation\n\nPytube requires an installation of Python 3.6 or greater, as well as pip. (Pip is typically bundled with Python [installations](https://python.org/downloads).)\n\nTo install from PyPI with pip:\n\n```bash\n$ python -m pip install pytube\n```\n\nSometimes, the PyPI release becomes slightly outdated. To install from the source with pip:\n\n```bash\n$ python -m pip install git+https://github.com/pytube/pytube\n```\n\n### Using pytube in a Python script\n\nTo download a video using the library in a script, you'll need to import the YouTube class from the library and pass an argument of the video URL. From there, you can access the streams and download them.\n\n```python\n >>> from pytube import YouTube\n >>> YouTube('https://youtu.be/2lAe1cqCOXo').streams.first().download()\n >>> yt = YouTube('http://youtube.com/watch?v=2lAe1cqCOXo')\n >>> yt.streams\n  ... .filter(progressive=True, file_extension='mp4')\n  ... .order_by('resolution')\n  ... .desc()\n  ... .first()\n  ... .download()\n```\n\n### Using the command-line interface\n\nUsing the CLI is remarkably straightforward as well. To download a video at the highest progressive quality, you can use the following command:\n```bash\n$ pytube https://youtube.com/watch?v=2lAe1cqCOXo\n```\n\nYou can also do the same for a playlist:\n```bash\n$ pytube https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS1QulWo1RIaJECMeUT4LFwJ-ghgoSH6n\n```\n"
