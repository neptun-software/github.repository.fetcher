It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nOnline documentation is available at [seaborn.pydata.org](https://seaborn.pydata.org).\n\nThe docs include a [tutorial](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html), [example gallery](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html), [API reference](https://seaborn.pydata.org/api.html), [FAQ](https://seaborn.pydata.org/faq), and other useful information.\n\nTo build the documentation locally, please refer to [`doc/README.md`](doc/README.md).\n\nDependencies\n------------\n\nSeaborn supports Python 3.8+.\n\nInstallation requires [numpy](https://numpy.org/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). Some advanced statistical functionality requires [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) and/or [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/).\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThe latest stable release (and required dependencies) can be installed from PyPI:\n\n    pip install seaborn\n\nIt is also possible to include optional statistical dependencies:\n\n    pip install seaborn[stats]\n\nSeaborn can also be installed with conda:\n\n    conda install seaborn\n\nNote that the main anaconda repository lags PyPI in adding new releases, but conda-forge (`-c conda-forge`) typically updates quickly.\n\nCiting\n------\n\nA paper describing seaborn has been published in the [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.03021). The paper provides an introduction to the key features of the library, and it can be used as a citation if seaborn proves integral to a scientific publication.\n\nTesting\n-------\n\nTesting seaborn requires installing additional dependencies; they can be installed with the `dev` extra (e.g., `pip install .[dev]`).\n\nTo test the code, run `make test` in the source directory. This will exercise the unit tests (using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/)) and generate a coverage report.\n\nCode style is enforced with `flake8` using the settings in the [`setup.cfg`](./setup.cfg) file. Run `make lint` to check. Alternately, you can use `pre-commit` to automatically run lint checks on any files you are committing: just run `pre-commit install` to set it up, and then commit as usual going forward.\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n\nSeaborn development takes place on Github: https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn\n\nPlease submit bugs that you encounter to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn/issues) with a reproducible example demonstrating the problem. Questions about usage are more at home on StackOverflow, where there is a [seaborn tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/seaborn).\n"
