There is a version for \r\nPython 3.8-3.10 [here](https://github.com/unexploredtest/neural-networks-and-deep-learning). \r\nI will not be updating the current repository for Python 3 compatibility.\r\n\r\nThe program `src/network3.py` uses version 0.6 or 0.7 of the Theano\r\nlibrary.  It needs modification for compatibility with later versions\r\nof the library.  I will not be making such modifications.\r\n\r\nAs the code is written to accompany the book, I don't intend to add\r\nnew features. However, bug reports are welcome, and you should feel\r\nfree to fork and modify the code.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nMIT License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012-2022 Michael Nielsen\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\r\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\r\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\r\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\r\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\r\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\r\nthe following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\r\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\r\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\r\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\r\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
