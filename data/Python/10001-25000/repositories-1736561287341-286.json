These prompt variants are no longer accepted during construction or in requests.\n- `pw.xpacks.llm.question_answering.BaseRAGQuestionAnswerer` allows setting user created prompts. Templates are verified to include 'context' and 'query' placeholders.\n- `pw.xpacks.llm.question_answering.BaseRAGQuestionAnswerer` can take a `BaseContextProcessor` that represents context documents to the LLM. Defaults to `pw.xpacks.llm.question_answering.SimpleContextProcessor` which filters metadata fields and joins the documents with new lines.\n\n### Fixed\n- The input of `pw.io.fs.read` and `pw.io.s3.read` is now correctly persisted in case deletions or modifications of already processed objects take place.\n\n## [0.16.1] - 2024-12-12\n\n### Changed\n- `pw.io.s3.read` now monitors object deletions and modifications in the S3 source, when ran in streaming mode. When an object is deleted in S3, it is also removed from the engine. Similarly, if an object is modified in S3, the engine updates its state to reflect those changes.\n- `pw.io.s3.read` now supports `with_metadata` flag, which makes it possible to attach the metadata of the source object to the table entries.\n\n### Fixed\n- `pw.xpacks.llm.document_store.DocumentStore` no longer requires `_metadata` column in the input table.\n\n## [0.16.0] - 2024-11-29\n\n### Added\n- `pw.xpacks.llm.document_store.SlidesDocumentStore`, which is a subclass of `pw.xpacks.llm.document_store.DocumentStore` customized for retrieving slides from presentations.\n- `pw.temporal.inactivity_detection` and `pw.temporal.utc_now` functions allowing for alerting and other time dependent usecases\n\n### Changed\n- `pw.Table.concat`, `pw.Table.with_id`, `pw.Table.with_id_from` no longer perform checks if ids are unique. It improves memory usage.\n- table operations that store values (like `pw.Table.join`, `pw.Table.update_cells`) no longer store columns that are not used downstream.\n- `append_only` column property is now propagated better (there are more places where we can infer it).\n- **BREAKING**: Parsers and parser utilities including `OpenParse`, `ParseUnstructured`, `ParseUtf8`, `parse_images` are now async. Parser interface in the `VectorStore` and `DocumentStore` remains unchanged.\n- **BREAKING**: Unused arguments from the constructor `pw.xpacks.llm.question_answering.DeckRetriever` are no longer accepted. \n\n### Fixed\n- `query_as_of_now` of `pw.stdlib.indexing.DataIndex` and `pw.stdlib.indexing.HybridIndex` now work in constant memory for infinite query stream (no query-related data is kept after query is answered).\n\n## [0.15.4] - 2024-11-18\n\n### Added\n- `pw.io.kafka.read` now supports reading entries starting from a specified timestamp.\n- `pw.io.nats.read` and `pw.io.nats.write` methods for reading from and writing Pathway tables to NATS.\n\n### Changed\n- `pw.Table.diff` now supports setting `instance` parameter that allows computing differences for multiple groups.\n- `pw.io.postgres.write_snapshot` now keeps the Postgres table fully in sync with the current state of the table in Pathway. This means that if an entry is deleted in Pathway, the same entry will also be deleted from the Postgres table managed by the output connector.\n\n### Fixed\n- `pw.PyObjectWrapper` is now picklable.\n- `query_as_of_now` of `pw.stdlib.indexing.DataIndex` and `pw.stdlib.indexing.HybridIndex` now work in constant memory for infinite query stream (no query-related data is kept after query is answered).\n\n## [0.15.3] - 2024-11-07\n\n### Added\n- `pw.io.mongodb.write` connector for writing Pathway tables in MongoDB.\n- `pw.io.s3.read` now supports downloading objects from an S3 bucket in parallel.\n\n### Changed\n- `pw.io.fs.read` performance has been improved for directories containing a large number of files.\n\n## [0.15.2] - 2024-10-24\n\n### Added\n- `pw.io.deltalake.read` now supports custom S3 Delta Lakes with HTTP endpoints.\n- `pw.io.deltalake.read` now supports specifying both a custom endpoint and a custom region for Delta Lakes via `pw.io.s3.AwsS3Settings`.\n\n### Changed\n- Indices in `pathway.stdlib.indexing.nearest_neighbors` can now work also on numpy arrays. Previously they only accepted `list[float]`. Working with numpy arrays improves memory efficiency.\n- `pw.io.s3.read` has been optimized to minimize new object requests whenever possible.\n- It is now possible to set the size limit of cache in `pw.udfs.DiskCache`.\n- State persistence now uses a single backend for both metadata and stream storage. The `pw.persistence.Config.simple_config` method is therefore deprecated. Now you can use the `pw.persistence.Config` constructor with the same parameters that were previously used in `simple_config`.\n\n### Fixed\n- `pw.io.bigquery.write` connector now correctly handles `pw.Json` columns.\n\n## [0.15.1] - 2024-10-04\n\n### Fixed\n- `pw.temporal.session` and `pw.temporal.asof_join` now correctly works with multiple entries with the same time.\n- Fixed an issue in `pw.stdlib.indexing` where filters would cause runtime errors while using `HybridIndexFactory`.\n\n\n## [0.15.0] - 2024-09-12\n\n### Added\n- **Experimental** A ``pw.xpacks.llm.document_store.DocumentStore`` to process and index documents.\n- ``pw.xpacks.llm.servers.DocumentStoreServer`` used to expose REST server for retrieving documents from ``pw.xpacks.llm.document_store.DocumentStore``.\n- `pw.xpacks.stdlib.indexing.HybridIndex` used for querying multiple indices and combining their results.\n- `pw.io.airbyte.read` now also supports streams that only operate in `full_refresh` mode.\n\n### Changed\n- Running servers for answering queries is extracted from `pw.xpacks.llm.question_answering.BaseRAGQuestionAnswerer` into `pw.xpacks.llm.servers.QARestServer` and `pw.xpacks.llm.servers.QASummaryRestServer`.\n- **BREAKING**: `query` and `query_as_of_now` of `pathway.stdlib.indexing.data_index.DataIndex` now produce an empty list instead of `None` if no match is found.\n\n## [0.14.3] - 2024-08-22\n\n### Fixed\n- `pw.io.deltalake.read` and `pw.io.deltalake.write` now correctly work with lakes hosted in S3 over min.io, Wasabi and Digital Ocean.\n\n### Added\n- The Pathway CLI command `spawn` can now execute code directly from a specified GitHub repository.\n- A new CLI command, `spawn-from-env`, has been added. This command runs the Pathway CLI `spawn` command using arguments provided in the `PATHWAY_SPAWN_ARGS` environment variable.\n\n## [0.14.2] - 2024-08-06\n\n### Fixed\n- Switched `pw.xpacks.llm.embedders.GeminiEmbedder` to be sync to resolve compatibility issues with the Google Colab runs.\n- Pinned `surya-ocr` module version for stability.\n\n## [0.14.1] - 2024-08-05\n\n### Added\n- `pw.xpacks.llm.embedders.GeminiEmbedder` which is a wrapper for Google Gemini Embedding services.\n\n## [0.14.0] - 2024-07-25\n\n### Fixed\n- `pw.debug.table_to_pandas` now exports `int | None` columns correctly.\n\n### Changed\n- `pw.io.airbyte.read` can now be used with Airbyte connectors implemented in Python without requiring Docker.\n- **BREAKING**: UDFs now verify the type of returned values at runtime. If it is possible to cast a returned value to a proper type, the values is cast. If the value does not match the expected type and can't be cast, an error is raised.\n- **BREAKING**: `pw.reducers.ndarray` reducer requires input column to either have type `float`, `int` or `Array`.\n- `pw.xpacks.llm.parsers.OpenParse` can now extract and parse images & diagrams from PDFs. This can be enabled by setting the `parse_images`. `processing_pipeline` can be also set to customize the post processing of doc elements.\n\n## [0.13.2] - 2024-07-08\n\n### Added\n- `pw.io.deltalake.read` now supports S3 data sources.\n- `pw.xpacks.llm.parsers.ImageParser` which allows parsing images with the vision LMs.\n- `pw.xpacks.llm.parsers.SlideParser` that enables parsing PDF and PPTX slides with the vision LMs.\n- `pw.xpacks.llm.parsers.question_answering.RAGClient`, Python client for Pathway hosted RAG apps.\n- `pw.xpacks.llm.parsers.question_answeringDeckRetriever`, a RAG app that enables searching through slide decks with visual-heavy elements.\n\n### Fixed\n- `pw.xpacks.llm.vector_store.VectorStoreServer` now uses new indexes.\n\n### Changed\n- `pw.xpacks.llm.parsers.OpenParse` now supports any vision Language model including local and proprietary models via LiteLLM.\n\n\n## [0.13.1] - 2024-06-27\n\n### Added\n- `pw.io.kafka.read` now accepts an autogenerate_key flag. This flag determines the primary key generation policy to apply when reading raw data from the source. You can either use the key from the Kafka message or have Pathway autogenerate one.\n- `pw.io.deltalake.read` input connector that fetches changes from DeltaLake into a Pathway table.\n- `pw.xpacks.llm.parsers.OpenParse` which allows parsing tables and images in PDFs.\n\n### Fixed\n- All S3 input connectors (including S3, Min.io, Digital Ocean, and Wasabi) now automatically retry network operations if a failure occurs.\n- The issue where the connection to the S3 source fails after partially ingesting an object has been resolved by downloading the object in full first.\n\n## [0.13.0] - 2024-06-13\n\n### Added\n- `pw.io.deltalake.write` now supports S3 destinations.\n\n### Changed\n- `pw.debug.compute_and_print` now allows passing more than one table.\n- **BREAKING**: `path` parameter in `pw.io.deltalake.write` renamed to `uri`.\n\n### Fixed\n- A bug in `pw.Table.deduplicate`. If `persistent_id` is not set, it is no longer generated in `pw.PersistenceMode.SELECTIVE_PERSISTING` mode.\n\n## [0.12.0] - 2024-06-08\n\n### Added\n- `pw.PyObjectWrapper` that enables passing python objects of any type to the engine.\n- `cache_strategy` option added for `pw.io.http.rest_connector`. It enables cache configuration, which is useful for duplicated requests.\n- `allow_misses` argument to `Table.ix` and `Table.ix_ref` methods which allows for filling rows with missing keys with None values.\n- `pw.io.deltalake.write` output connector that streams the changes of a given table into a DeltaLake storage.\n- `pw.io.airbyte.read` now supports data extraction with Google Cloud Runs.\n\n### Removed\n- **BREAKING**: Removed `Table.having` method.\n- **BREAKING**: Removed `pw.DATE_TIME_UTC`, `pw.DATE_TIME_NAIVE` and `pw.DURATION` as dtype markers. Instead, `pw.DateTimeUtc`, `pw.DateTimeNaive` and `pw.Duration` should be used, which are wrappers for corresponding pandas types.\n- **BREAKING**: Removed class transformers from public API: `pw.ClassArg`, `pw.attribute`, `pw.input_attribute`, `pw.input_method`, `pw.method`, `pw.output_attribute` and `pw.transformer`.\n- **BREAKING**: Removed several methods from `pw.indexing` module: `binsearch_oracle`, `filter_cmp_helper`, `filter_smallest_k` and `prefix_sum_oracle`.\n\n## [0.11.2] - 2024-05-27\n\n### Added\n- `pathway.assert_table_has_schema` and `pathway.table_transformer` now accept `allow_subtype` argument, which, if True, allows column types in the Table be subtypes of types in the Schema.\n- `next` method to `pw.io.python.ConnectorSubject` (python connector) that enables passing values of any type to the engine, not only values that are json-serializable. The `next` method should be the preferred way of passing values from the python connector.\n\n### Changed\n- The `format` argument of `pw.io.python.read` is deprecated. A data format is inferred from the method used (`next_json`, `next_str`, `next_bytes`) and the provided schema.\n\n### Removed\n- Removed `pw.numba_apply` and `numba` dependency.\n\n### Fixed\n- Fixed `pw.this` desugaring bug, where `__getitem__` in `.ix` context was not working properly.\n- `pw.io.sqlite.read` now checks if the data matches the passed schema.\n\n## [0.11.1] - 2024-05-16\n\n### Added\n- `query` and `query_as_of_now` of `pathway.stdlib.indexing.data_index.DataIndex` now accept in `metadata_column` parameter a column with data of type `str | None`.\n- `pathway.xpacks.connectors.sharepoint` module, available with Pathway Scale License.\n\n\n## [0.11.0] - 2024-05-10\n\n### Added\n- Embedders in the LLM xpack now have method `get_embedding_dimension` that returns number of dimension used by the chosen embedder.\n- `pathway.stdlib.indexing.nearest_neighbors`, with implementations of `pathway.stdlib.indexing.data_index.InnerIndex` based on k-NN via LSH (implemented in Pathway), and k-NN provided by USearch library.\n- `pathway.stdlib.indexing.vector_document_index`, with a few predefined instances of `pathway.stdlib.indexing.data_index.DataIndex`.\n- `pathway.stdlib.indexing.bm25`, with implementations of `pathway.stdlib.indexing.data_index.InnerIndex` based on BM25 index provided by Tantivy.\n- `pathway.stdlib.indexing.full_text_document_index`, with a predefined instance of `pathway.stdlib.indexing.data_index.DataIndex`.\n- Introduced the `reranker` module under `llm.xpacks`. Includes few re-ranking strategies and utility functions for RAG applications.\n\n### Changed\n- **BREAKING**: `windowby` generates IDs of produced rows differently than in the previous version.\n- **BREAKING**: `pw.io.csv.write` prints printable non-ascii characters as regular text, not `\\u{xxxx}`.\n- **BREAKING**: Connector methods `pw.io.elasticsearch.read`, `pw.io.debezium.read`, `pw.io.fs.read`, `pw.io.jsonlines.read`, `pw.io.kafka.read`, `pw.io.python.read`, `pw.io.redpanda.read`, `pw.io.s3.read` now check the type of the input data. Previously it was not checked if the provided format was `\"json\"`/`\"jsonlines\"`. If the data is inconsistent with the provided schema, the row is skipped and the error message is emitted.\n- **BREAKING**: `query` and `query_as_of_now` methods of `pathway.stdlib.indexing.data_index.DataIndex` now return `pathway.JoinResult`, to allow resolving column name conflicts (between columns in the table with queries and table with index data).\n- **BREAKING**: DataIndex methods `query` and `query_as_of_now` now return score in a column named `_pw_index_reply_score` (defined as `_SCORE` variable in `pathway.stdlib.indexing.colnames.py`).\n\n### Removed\n- **BREAKING**: `pathway.stdlib.indexing.data_index.VectorDocumentIndex` class, some predefined instances are now meant to be obtained via methods provided in `pathway.stdlib.indexing.vector_document_index`.\n- **BREAKING**: `with_distances` parameter of `query` and `query_as_of_now` methods in `pathway.stdlib.indexing.data_index.DataIndex`. Instead of 'distance', we now operate with a more general term 'score' (higher = better). For distance based indices score is usually defined as negative distance. Score is now always included in the answer, as long as underlying index returns something that indicates quality of a match.\n\n## [0.10.1] - 2024-04-30\n\n### Added\n- `query` method to VectorStoreServer to enable compatible API with `DataIndex`.\n- `AdaptiveRAGQuestionAnswerer` to xpacks.question_answering. End-to-end pipeline and accompanying code for `Private RAG` showcase.\n\n## [0.10.0] - 2024-04-24\n\n### Added\n- Pathway now warns when unintentionally creating Table with empty universe.\n- `pw.io.kafka.write` in `raw` and `plaintext` formats now supports output for tables with multiple columns. For such tables, it requires the specification of the column that must be used as a value of the produced Kafka messages and gives a possibility to provide column which must be used as a key.\n- `pw.io.kafka.write` can now output values from the table using Kafka message headers in 'raw' and 'plaintext' output format.\n\n### Changed\n- `instance` arguments to `groupby`, `join`, `with_id_from` now determine how entries are distributed between machines.\n- `flatten` results remain on the same machine as their source entries.\n- `join` sends each record between machines at most once.\n- **BREAKING**: `flatten`, `join`, `groupby` (if used with `instance`), `with_id_from` (if used with `instance`) generate IDs of the produced rows differently than in the previous versions.\n- `pathway spawn` with multiple workers prints only output from the first worker.\n\n## [0.9.0] - 2024-04-18\n\n### Added\n- `pw.reducers.latest` and `pw.reducers.earliest` that return the value with respectively maximal and minimal processing time assigned.\n- `pw.io.kafka.write` can now produce messages containing raw bytes in case the table consists of a single binary column and `raw` mode is specified. Similarly, this method will provide plaintext messages if `plaintext` mode is chosen and the table consists of a single string-typed column.\n- `pw.io.pubsub.write` connector for publishing Pathway tables into Google PubSub.\n- Argument `strict_prompt` to `answer_with_geometric_rag_strategy` and `answer_with_geometric_rag_strategy_from_index` that allows optimizing prompts for smaller open-source LLM models.\n- Temporarily switch LiteLLMChat's generation method to sync version due to a bug while using `json` mode with Ollama.\n\n### Changed\n- **BREAKING**: `pw.io.kafka.read` will not parse the messages from UTF-8 in case `raw` mode was specified. To preserve this behavior you can use the `plaintext` mode.\n- **BREAKING**: `Table.flatten` now flattens one column and spreads every other column of the table, instead of taking other columns from the argument list.\n\n## [0.8.6] - 2024-04-10\n\n### Added\n- `pw.io.bigquery.write` connector for writing Pathway tables into Google BigQuery.\n- parameter `filepath_globpattern` to `query` method in `VectorStoreClient` for specifying which files should be considered in the query.\n- Improved compatibility of `pw.Json` with standard methods such as `len()`, `int()`, `float()`, `bool()`, `iter()`, `reversed()` when feasible.\n\n### Changed\n- `pw.io.postgres.write` can now parallelize writes to several threads if several workers are configured.\n- Pathway now checks types of pointers rigorously. Indexing table with mismatched number/types of columns vs what was used to create index will now result in a TypeError.\n- `pw.Json.as_float()` method now supports integer JSON values.\n\n## [0.8.5] - 2024-03-27\n\n### Added\n- New function `answer_with_geometric_rag_strategy_from_index`, which allows to use `answer_with_geometric_rag_strategy` without the need to first retrieve documents from index.\n- Added support for custom state serialization to `udf_reducer`.\n- Introduced `instance` parameter in `AsyncTransformer`. All calls with a given `(instance, processing_time)` pair are returned at the same processing time. Ordering is preserved within a single instance.\n- Added `successful`, `failed`, `finished` properties to `AsyncTransformer`. They return tables with successful calls, failed calls and all finished calls, respectively.\n\n### Changed\n- Property `result` of `AsyncTransformer` is deprecated. Property `successful` should be used instead.\n- `pw.io.csv.read`, `pw.io.jsonlines.read`, `pw.io.fs.read`, `pw.io.plaintext.read` now handle `path` as a glob pattern and read all matched files and directories recursively.\n\n## [0.8.4] - 2024-03-18\n\n### Fixed\n- Pathway will only require `LiteLLM` package, if you use one of the wrappers for `LiteLLM`.\n- Retries are implemented in `pw.io.airbyte.read`.\n- State processing protocol is updated in `pw.io.airbyte.read`.\n\n## [0.8.3] - 2024-03-13\n\n### Added\n- New parameters of `pw.UDF` class and `pw.udf` decorator: `return_type`, `deterministic`, `propagate_none`, `executor`, `cache_strategy`.\n- The LLM Xpack now provides integrations with LlamaIndex and LangChain for running the Pathway VectorStore server.\n\n### Changed\n- Subclassing `UDFSync` and `UDFAsync` is deprecated. `UDF` should be subclassed to create a new UDF.\n- Passing keyword arguments to `pw.apply`, `pw.apply_with_type`, `pw.apply_async` is deprecated. In the future, they'll be used for configuration, not passing data to the function.\n\n### Fixed\n- Fixed a minor bug with `Table.groupby()` method which sometimes prevented of accessing certain columns in the following `reduce()`.\n- Fixed warnings from using OpenAI Async embedding model in the VectorStore in Colab.\n\n## [0.8.2] - 2024-02-28\n\n### Added\n- `%:z` timezone format code to `strptime`.\n- Support for Airbyte connectors `pw.io.airbyte`.\n\n## [0.8.1] - 2024-02-15\n\n### Added\n- Introduced the `send_alerts` function in the `pw.io.slack` namespace, enabling users to send messages from a specified column directly to a Slack channel.\n- Enhanced the `pw.io.http.rest_connector` by introducing an additional argument called `request_validator`. This feature empowers users to validate payloads and raise an `HTTP 400` error if necessary.\n\n### Fixed\n- Addressed an issue in `pw.io.xpacks.llm.VectorStoreServer` where the computation of the last modification timestamp for an indexed document was incorrect.\n\n### Changed\n- Improved the behavior of `pw.io.kafka.write`. It now includes retries when sending data to the output topic encounters failures.\n\n## [0.8.0] - 2024-02-01\n\n### Added\n- `pw.io.http.rest_connector` now supports multiple HTTP request types.\n- `pw.io.http.PathwayWebserver` now allows Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to be enabled on newly added endpoints\n- Wrappers for LiteLLM and HuggingFace chat services and SentenceTransformers embedding service are now added to Pathway xpack for LLMs.\n\n### Changed\n- `pw.run` now includes an additional parameter `runtime_typechecking` that enables strict type checking at runtime.\n- Embedders in pathway.xpacks.llm.embedders now correctly process empty strings as queries.\n- **BREAKING**: `pw.run` and `pw.run_all` now only accept keyword arguments.\n\n### Fixed\n- `pw.Duration` can now be returned from User-Defined Functions (UDFs) or used as a constant value without resulting in errors.\n- `pw.io.debezium.read` now correctly handles tables that do not have a primary key.\n\n## [0.7.10] - 2024-01-26\n\n### Added\n- `pw.io.http.rest_connector` can now generate Open API 3.0.3 schema that will be returned by the route ``/_schema``.\n- Wrappers for OpenAI Chat and Embedding services are now added to Pathway xpack for LLMs. \n- A vector indexing pipeline that allows querying for the most similar documents. It is available as class `VectorStore` as part of Pathway xpack for LLMs.\n\n### Fixed\n- `pw.debug.table_from_markdown` now uses schema parameter (when set) to properly assign _simple types_ (`int, bool, float, str, bytes`) and optional _simple types_ to columns. \n\n## [0.7.9] - 2024-01-18\n\n### Changed\n- `pw.io.http.rest_connector` now also accepts port as a string for backwards compatibility.\n- `pw.stdlib.ml.index.KNNIndex` now sorts by distance by default.\n\n## [0.7.8] - 2024-01-18\n\n### Added\n- Support for comparisons of tuples has been added.\n- Standalone versions of methods such as `pw.groupby`, `pw.join`, `pw.join_inner`, `pw.join_left`, `pw.join_right`, and `pw.join_outer` are now available.\n- The `abs` function from Python can now be used on Pathway expressions.\n- The `asof_join` method now has configurable temporal behavior. The `behavior` parameter can be used to pass the configuration.\n- The state of the `deduplicate` operator can now be persisted.\n\n### Changed\n- `interval_join` can now work with intervals of zero length.\n- The `pw.io.http.rest_connector` can now open multiple endpoints on the same port using a new `pw.io.http.PathwayWebserver` class.\n- The `pw.xpacks.connectors.sharepoint.read` and `pw.io.gdrive.read` methods now support the size limit for a single object. If set, it will exclude too large files and won't read them.\n\n## [0.7.7] - 2023-12-27\n\n### Added\n- pathway.xpacks.llm.splitter.TokenCountSplitter.\n\n## [0.7.6] - 2023-12-22\n\n## New Features\n\n### Conversion Methods in `pw.Json`\n- Introducing new methods for strict conversion of `pw.Json` to desired types within a UDF body:\n  - `as_int()`\n  - `as_float()`\n  - `as_str()`\n  - `as_bool()`\n  - `as_list()`\n  - `as_dict()`\n\n### DateTime Functionality\n- Added `table.col.dt.utc_from_timestamp` method: Creates `DateTimeUtc` from timestamps represented as `int`s or `float`s.\n- Enhanced the `table.col.dt.timestamp` method with a new `unit` argument to specify the unit of the returned timestamp.\n\n### Experimental Features\n- Introduced an experimental xpack with a Microsoft SharePoint input connector.\n\n## Enhancements\n\n### Improved JSON Handling\n- Index operator (`[]`) can now be directly applied to `pw.Json` within UDFs to access elements of JSON objects, arrays, and strings.\n\n### Expanded Timestamp Functionality\n- Enhanced the `table.col.dt.from_timestamp` method to create `DateTimeNaive` from timestamps represented as `int`s or `float`s.\n- Deprecated not specifying the `unit` argument of the `table.col.dt.timestamp` method.\n\n### KNNIndex Enhancements\n- `KNNIndex` now supports returning computed distances.\n- Added support for cosine similarity in `KNNIndex`.\n\n### Deprecated Features\n- The `offset` argument of `pw.stdlib.temporal.sliding` and `pw.stdlib.temporal.tumbling` is deprecated. Use `origin` instead, as it represents a point in time, not a duration.\n\n## Bug Fixes\n\n### DateTime Fixes\n- Sliding window now works correctly with UTC Datetimes.\n\n### `asof_join` Improvements\n- Temporal column in `asof_join` no longer has to be named `t`.\n- `asof_join` includes rows with equal times for all values of the `direction` parameter.\n\n### Fixed Issues\n\n- Fixed an issue with `pw.io.gdrive.read`: Shared folders support is now working seamlessly.\n\n## [0.7.5] - 2023-12-15\n\n### Added\n- Added Table.split() method for splitting table based on an expression into two tables.\n- Columns with datatype duration can now be multiplied and divided by floats.\n- Columns with datatype duration now support both true and floor division (`/` and `//`) by integers.\n\n### Changed\n- Pathway is better at typing if_else expressions when optional types are involved.\n- `table.flatten()` operator now supports Json array.\n- Buffers (used to delay outputs, configured via delay in `common_behavior`) now flush the data when the computation is finished. The effect of this change can be seen when run in bounded (batch / multi-revision) mode.\n- `pw.io.subscribe()` takes additional argument `on_time_end` - the callback function to be called on each closed time of computation.\n- `pw.io.subscribe()` is now a single-worker operator, guaranteeing that `on_end` is triggered at most once.\n- `KNNIndex` supports now metadata filtering. Each query can specify it's own filter in the JMESPath format.\n\n### Fixed\n- Resolved an optimization bug causing `pw.iterate` to malfunction when handling columns effectively pointing to the same data.\n\n## [0.7.4] - 2023-12-05\n\n### Changed\n- Pathway now keeps track of `array` columntype better - it is able to keep track of Array dtype and number of dimensions, wherever applicable.\n\n### Fixed\n- Fixed issues with standalone panel+Bokeh dashboards to ensure optimal functionality and performance.\n\n## [0.7.3] - 2023-11-30\n\n### Added\n- A method `weekday` has been added to the `dt` namespace, that can be called on column expressions containing datetime data. This method returns an integer that represents the day of the week.\n- **EXPERIMENTAL**: Methods `show` and `plot` on Tables, providing visualizations of data using HoloViz Panel.\n- Added support for `instance` parameter to `groupby`, `join`, `windowby` and temporal join methods.\n- `pw.PersistenceMode.UDF_CACHING` persistence mode enabling automatic caching of `AsyncTransformer` invocations.\n\n### Changed\n- Methods `round` and `floor` on columns with datetimes now accept duration argument to be a string.\n- `pw.debug.compute_and_print` and `pw.debug.compute_and_print_update_stream` have a new argument `n_rows` that limits the number of rows printed.\n- `pw.debug.table_to_pandas` has a new argument `include_id` (by default `True`). If set to `False`, creates a new index for the Pandas DataFrame, rather than using the keys of the Pathway Table.\n- `windowby` function `shard` argument is now deprecated and `instance` should be used.\n- Special column name `_pw_shard` is now deprecated, and `_pw_instance` should be used.\n- `pw.ReplayMode` now can be accessed as `pw.PersistenceMode`, while the `SPEEDRUN` and `REALTIME` variants are now accessible as `SPEEDRUN_REPLAY` and `REALTIME_REPLAY`.\n- **EXPERIMENTAL**: `pw.io.gdrive.read` has a new argument `with_metadata` (by default `False`). If set to `True`, adds a `_metadata` column containing file metadata to the resulting table.\n- Methods `get_nearest_items` and `get_nearest_items_asof_now` of `KNNIndex` allow to specify `k` (number of returned elements) separately in each query.\n\n## [0.7.2] - 2023-11-24\n\n### Added\n- Added ability of creating custom reducers using `pw.reducers.udf_reducer` decorator. Use `pw.BaseCustomAccumulator` as a base class\n  for creating accumulators. Decorating accumulator returns reducer following custom logic.\n- A function `pw.debug.compute_and_print_update_stream` that computes and prints the update stream of the table.\n- SQLite input connector (`pw.io.sqlite`).\n\n### Changed\n- `pw.debug.parse_to_table` is now deprecated, `pw.debug.table_from_markdown` should be used instead.\n- `pw.schema_from_csv` now has `quote` and `double_quote_escapes` arguments.\n\n### Fixed\n- Schema returned from `pw.schema_from_csv` will have quotes removed from column names, so it will now work properly with `pw.io.csv.read`.\n\n## [0.7.1] - 2023-11-17\n\n### Added\n\n- Experimental Google Drive input connector.\n- Stateful deduplication function (`pw.stateful.deduplicate`) allowing alerting on significant changes.\n- The ability to split data into batches in `pw.debug.table_from_markdown` and `pw.debug.table_from_pandas`.\n\n## [0.7.0] - 2023-11-16\n\n### Added\n- class `Behavior`, a superclass of all behavior classes.\n- class `ExactlyOnceBehavior` indicating we want to create a `CommonBehavior` that results in each window producing exactly one output (shifted in time by an optional `shift` parameter).\n- function `exactly_once_behavior` creating an instance of `ExactlyOnceBehavior`.\n\n### Changed\n- **BREAKING**: `WindowBehavior` is now called `CommonBehavior`, as it can be also used with interval joins.\n- **BREAKING**: `window_behavior` is now called `common_behavior`, as it can be also used with interval joins.\n- Deprecating parameter `keep_queries` in `pw.io.http.rest_connector`. Now `delete_completed_queries` with an opposite meaning should be used instead. The default is still `delete_completed_queries=True` (equivalent to `keep_queries=False`) but it will soon be required to be set explicitly.\n\n## [0.6.0] - 2023-11-10\n\n### Added\n- A flag `with_metadata` for the filesystem-based connectors to attach the source file metadata to the table entries.\n- Methods `pw.debug.table_from_list_of_batches` and `pw.debug.table_from_list_of_batches_by_workers` for creating tables with defined data being inserted over time.\n\n### Changed\n- **BREAKING**: `pw.debug.table_from_pandas` and `pw.debug.table_from_markdown` now will create tables in the streaming mode, instead of static, if given table definition contains `_time` column.\n- **BREAKING**: Renamed the parameter `keep_queries` in `pw.io.http.rest_connector` to `delete_queries` with the opposite meaning. It changes the default behavior - it was `keep_queries=False`, now it is `delete_queries=False`.\n\n## [0.5.3] - 2023-10-27\n\n### Added\n- A method `get_nearest_items_asof_now` in `KNNIndex` that allows to get nearest neighbors without updating old queries in the future.\n- A method `asof_now_join` in `Table` to join rows from left side of the join with right side of the join at their processing time. Past rows from left side are not used when new data appears on the right side.\n\n## [0.5.2] - 2023-10-19\n\n### Added\n- `interval_join` now supports forgetting old entries. The configuration can be passed using `behavior` parameter of `interval_join` method.\n- Decorator `@table_transformer` for marking that functions take Tables as arguments.\n- Namespace for all columns `Table.C.*`.\n- Output connectors now provide logs about the number of entries written and time taken.\n- Filesystem connectors now support reading whole files as rows.\n- Command line option for `pathway spawn` to record data and `pathway replay` command to replay data.\n\n## [0.5.1] - 2023-10-04\n\n### Fixed\n- `select` operates only on consistent states.\n\n## [0.5.0] - 2023-10-04\n\n### Added\n- `Schema` method `typehints` that returns dict of mypy-compatible typehints.\n- Support for JSON parsing from CSV sources.\n- `restrict` method in `Table` to restrict table universe to the universe of the other table.\n- Better support for postgresql types in the output connector.\n\n### Changed\n- **BREAKING**: renamed `Table` method `dtypes` to `typehints`. It now returns a `dict` of mypy-compatible typehints.\n- **BREAKING**: `Schema.__getitem__` returns a data class `ColumnSchema` containing all related information on particular column.\n- **BREAKING**: `tuple` reducer used after intervals_over window now sorts values by time.\n- **BREAKING**: expressions used in `select`, `filter`, `flatten`, `with_columns`, `with_id`, `with_id_from` have to have the same universe as the table. Earlier it was possible to use an expression from a superset of a table universe. To use expressions from wider universes, one can use `restrict` on the expression source table.\n- **BREAKING**: `pw.universes.promise_are_equal(t1, t2)` no longer allows to use references from `t1` and `t2` in a single expression. To change the universe of a table, use `with_universe_of`.\n- **BREAKING**: `ix` and `ix_ref` are temporarily broken inside joins (both temporal and ordinary).\n- `select`, `filter`, `concat` keep columns as a single stream. The work for other operators is ongoing.\n\n### Fixed\n- Optional types other than string correctly output to PostgreSQL.\n\n## [0.4.1] - 2023-09-25\n\n### Added\n- Support for messages compressed with zstd in the Kafka connector.\n\n## [0.4.0] - 2023-09-21\n\n### Added\n- Support for JSON data format, including `pw.Json` type.\n- Methods `as_int()`, `as_float()`, `as_str()`, `as_bool()` to convert values from `Json`.\n- New argument `skip_nones` for `tuple` and `sorted_tuple` reducers.\n- New argument `is_outer` for `intervals_over` window.\n- `pw.schema_from_dict` and `pw.schema_from_csv` for generating schema based, respectively, on provided definition as a dictionary and CSV file with sample data.\n- `generate_class` method in `Schema` class for generating schema class code.\n\n### Changed\n- Method `get()` and `[]` to support accessing elements in Jsons.\n- Function `pw.assert_table_has_schema` for writing asserts checking, whether given table has the same schema as the one that is given as an argument.\n- **BREAKING**: `ix` and `ix_ref` operations are now standalone transformations of `pw.Table` into `pw.Table`. Most of the usages remain the same, but sometimes user needs to provide a context (when e.g. using them inside `join` or `groupby` operations). `ix` and `ix_ref` are temporarily broken inside temporal joins.\n\n### Fixed\n- Fixed a bug where new-style optional types (e.g. `int | None`) were translated to `Any` dtype.\n\n## [0.3.4] - 2023-09-18\n\n### Fixed\n- Incompatible `beartype` version is now excluded from dependencies.\n\n## [0.3.3] - 2023-09-14\n\n### Added\n- Module `pathway.dt` to construct and manipulate DTypes.\n- New argument `keep_queries` in `pw.io.http.rest_connector`.\n\n### Changed\n- Internal representation of DTypes. Inputting types is compatible backwards.\n- Temporal functions now accept arguments of mixed types (ints and floats). For example, `pw.temporal.interval` can use ints while columns it interacts with are floats.\n- Single-element arrays are now treated as arrays, not as scalars.\n\n### Fixed\n- `to_string()` method on datetimes always prints 9 fractional digits.\n- `%f` format code in `strptime()` parses fractional part of a second correctly regardless of the number of digits.\n\n## [0.3.2] - 2023-09-07\n\n### Added\n\n- `Table.cast_to_types()` function that can perform `pathway.cast` on multiple columns.\n- `intervals_over` window, which allows to get temporally close data to given times.\n- `demo.replay_csv_with_time` function that can replay a CSV file following the timestamps of a given column.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Static data is now copied to ensure immutability.\n- Improved error tracing mechanism to work with any type of error.\n\n## [0.3.1] - 2023-08-29\n\n### Added\n\n- `tuple` reducer, that returns a tuple with values.\n- `ndarray` reducer, that returns an array with values.\n\n### Changed\n- `numpy` arrays of `int32`, `uint32` and `float32` are now converted to their 64-bit variants instead of tuples.\n- KNNIndex interface to take columns as inputs.\n- Reducers now check types of their arguments.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed delayed reporting of output connector errors.\n- Python objects are now freed more often, reducing peak memory usage.\n\n## [0.3.0] - 2023-08-07\n\n### Added\n\n- `@` (matrix multiplication) operator.\n\n### Changed\n\n- Python version 3.10 or later is now required.\n- Type checking is now more strict.\n\n## [0.2.1] - 2023-07-31\n\n### Changed\n\n- Immediately forget queries in REST connector.\n- Make type annotations mandatory in `Schema`.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed IDs coming from CSV source.\n- Fixed indices of dataframes from pandas transformer.\n\n## [0.2.0] - 2023-07-20\n\n### Added\n\n<img src=\"https://d14l3brkh44201.cloudfront.net/PathwayManul.svg\"  alt=\"manul\" width=\"50px\"></img>\n"

          "content": "# Pathway Code of Conduct\n\nIn the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as\ncontributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our\ncommunity a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body\nsize, disability, health condition, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of\nexperience, nationality, country of origin, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity\nand orientation, and any other criteria falling under discriminatory practices under the Law of France.\n\n## Our Standards\n\nExamples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:\n\n*   Using welcoming and inclusive language.\n*   Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.\n*   Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.\n*   Focusing on what is best for the community.\n*   Showing empathy towards other community members.\n\nExamples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:\n\n*   The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or\n    advances.\n*   Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.\n*   Public or private harassment.\n*   Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic\n    address, without explicit permission.\n*   Conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate for the forum in\n    which it occurs.\n\nAll Pathway forums and spaces are meant for professional interactions, and any behavior which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting is unacceptable.\n\n\n## Our Responsibilities\n\nProject maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.\n\nProject maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.\n\n\n## Scope\n\nThis Code of Conduct applies to all content on pathway.com, Pathway’s GitHub organization, or any other official Pathway web presence allowing for community interactions, as well as at all official Pathway events, whether offline or online.\n\nThe Code of Conduct also applies within project spaces and in public spaces whenever an individual is representing Pathwayor its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed or de facto representative at an online or offline event. \n\n\n## Conflict Resolution\n\nConflicts in an open source project can take many forms, from someone having a bad day and using harsh and hurtful language in the issue queue, to more serious instances such as sexist/racist statements or threats of violence, and everything in between.\n\nIf the behavior is threatening or harassing, or for other reasons requires immediate escalation, please see below.\n\nHowever, for the vast majority of issues, we aim to empower individuals to first resolve conflicts themselves, asking for help when needed, and only after that fails to escalate further. This approach gives people more control over the outcome of their dispute. \n\nIf you are experiencing or witnessing conflict, we ask you to use the following escalation strategy to address the conflict:\n\n1.  If you so wish and if you do not feel threatened or at risk of any form of personal abuse, address the perceived conflict directly with those involved, preferably in a real-time medium.\n2.  If this fails, get a third party (e.g. a mutual friend, and/or someone with\n    background on the issue, but not involved in the conflict) to intercede.\n3.  If you are still unable to resolve the conflict, and you believe it rises to\n    harassment or another code of conduct violation, report it.\n\nPlease note that if you are experiencing or witnessing a discriminatory practice that would be susceptible to be condemned by law, we ask you to directly escalate to 3. \n\n## Reporting Violations\n\nViolations of the Code of Conduct can be reported to Pathway via email to code_of_conduct@pathway.com. Project maintainers will determine whether the Code of Conduct was violated, and will issue an appropriate sanction, possibly including a written warning or expulsion from the project, project sponsored spaces, or project forums. We ask that you make a good-faith effort to resolve your conflict via the conflict resolution policy before submitting a report.\n\nViolations of the Code of Conduct can occur in any setting, even those unrelated to the project. We will only consider complaints about conduct that has occurred within one year of the report.\n\n\n## Enforcement\n\nIf the Project maintainers receive a report alleging a violation of the Code of Conduct, the Project maintainers will notify the accused of the report, and provide them an opportunity to discuss the report before a sanction is issued. The Project maintainers will do their utmost to keep the reporter anonymous. If the act is ongoing (such as someone engaging in harassment), or involves a threat to anyone's safety (e.g. threats of violence), the Project maintainers may issue sanctions without notice.\n\n\n## Attribution\n\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the Tensorflow Code of Conduct, and based on Contributor Covenant, version 1.4, available at https://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4, and includes some aspects of the Geek Feminism Code of Conduct and the Drupal Code of Conduct.\n"

Pick one and start your hands-on experience with Pathway today!\n\n### Event processing and real-time analytics pipelines\nWith its unified engine for batch and streaming and its full Python compatibility, Pathway makes data processing as easy as possible. It's the ideal solution for a wide range of data processing pipelines, including:\n\n- [Showcase: Real-time ETL.](https://pathway.com/developers/templates/kafka-etl)\n- [Showcase: Event-driven pipelines with alerting.](https://pathway.com/developers/templates/realtime-log-monitoring)\n- [Showcase: Realtime analytics.](https://pathway.com/developers/templates/linear_regression_with_kafka/)\n- [Docs: Switch from batch to streaming.](https://pathway.com/developers/user-guide/connecting-to-data/switch-from-batch-to-streaming)\n\n\n\n### AI Pipelines\n\nPathway provides dedicated LLM tooling to build live LLM and RAG pipelines. Wrappers for most common LLM services and utilities are included, making working with LLMs and RAGs pipelines incredibly easy. Check out our [LLM xpack documentation](https://pathway.com/developers/user-guide/llm-xpack/overview).\n\nDon't hesitate to try one of our runnable examples featuring LLM tooling.\nYou can find such examples [here](https://pathway.com/developers/user-guide/llm-xpack/llm-examples).\n\n  - [Template: Unstructured data to SQL on-the-fly.](https://pathway.com/developers/templates/unstructured-to-structured/)\n  - [Template: Private RAG with Ollama and Mistral AI](https://pathway.com/developers/templates/private-rag-ollama-mistral)\n  - [Template: Adaptive RAG](https://pathway.com/developers/templates/adaptive-rag)\n  - [Template: Multimodal RAG with gpt-4o](https://pathway.com/developers/templates/multimodal-rag)\n\n## Features\n\n- **A wide range of connectors**: Pathway comes with connectors that connect to external data sources such as Kafka, GDrive, PostgreSQL, or SharePoint. Its Airbyte connector allows you to connect to more than 300 different data sources. If the connector you want is not available, you can build your own custom connector using Pathway Python connector.\n- **Stateless and stateful transformations**: Pathway supports stateful transformations such as joins, windowing, and sorting. It provides many transformations directly implemented in Rust. In addition to the provided transformation, you can use any Python function. You can implement your own or you can use any Python library to process your data.\n- **Persistence**: Pathway provides persistence to save the state of the computation. This allows you to restart your pipeline after an update or a crash. Your pipelines are in good hands with Pathway!\n- **Consistency**: Pathway handles the time for you, making sure all your computations are consistent. In particular, Pathway manages late and out-of-order points by updating its results whenever new (or late, in this case) data points come into the system. The free version of Pathway gives the \"at least once\" consistency while the enterprise version provides the \"exactly once\" consistency.\n- **Scalable Rust engine**: with Pathway Rust engine, you are free from the usual limits imposed by Python. You can easily do multithreading, multiprocessing, and distributed computations.\n- **LLM helpers**: Pathway provides an LLM extension with all the utilities to integrate LLMs with your data pipelines (LLM wrappers, parsers, embedders, splitters), including an in-memory real-time Vector Index, and integrations with LLamaIndex and LangChain. You can quickly build and deploy RAG applications with your live documents.\n\n\n## Getting started<a id=\"getting-started\"></a>\n\n### Installation<a id=\"installation\"></a>\n\nPathway requires Python 3.10 or above.\n\nYou can install the current release of Pathway using `pip`:\n\n```\n$ pip install -U pathway\n```\n\n⚠️ Pathway is available on MacOS and Linux. Users of other systems should run Pathway on a Virtual Machine.\n\n\n### Example: computing the sum of positive values in real time.<a id=\"example\"></a>\n\n```python\nimport pathway as pw\n\n# Define the schema of your data (Optional)\nclass InputSchema(pw.Schema):\n  value: int\n\n# Connect to your data using connectors\ninput_table = pw.io.csv.read(\n  \"./input/\",\n  schema=InputSchema\n)\n\n#Define your operations on the data\nfiltered_table = input_table.filter(input_table.value>=0)\nresult_table = filtered_table.reduce(\n  sum_value = pw.reducers.sum(filtered_table.value)\n)\n\n# Load your results to external systems\npw.io.jsonlines.write(result_table, \"output.jsonl\")\n\n# Run the computation\npw.run()\n```\n\nRun Pathway [in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1aBIJ2HCng-YEUOMrr0qtj0NeZMEyRz55?usp=sharing).\n\nYou can find more examples [here](https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway/tree/main/examples).\n\n\n## Deployment<a id=\"deployment\"></a>\n\n### Locally<a id=\"running-pathway-locally\"></a>\n\nTo use Pathway, you only need to import it:\n\n```python\nimport pathway as pw\n```\n\nNow, you can easily create your processing pipeline, and let Pathway handle the updates. Once your pipeline is created, you can launch the computation on streaming data with a one-line command:\n\n```python\npw.run()\n```\n\nYou can then run your Pathway project (say, `main.py`) just like a normal Python script: `$ python main.py`.\nPathway comes with a monitoring dashboard that allows you to keep track of the number of messages sent by each connector and the latency of the system. The dashboard also includes log messages. \n\n<img src=\"https://d14l3brkh44201.cloudfront.net/pathway-dashboard.png\" width=\"1326\" alt=\"Pathway dashboard\"/>\n\nAlternatively, you can use the pathway'ish version:\n\n```\n$ pathway spawn python main.py\n```\n\nPathway natively supports multithreading.\nTo launch your application with 3 threads, you can do as follows:\n```\n$ pathway spawn --threads 3 python main.py\n```\n\nTo jumpstart a Pathway project, you can use our [cookiecutter template](https://github.com/pathwaycom/cookiecutter-pathway).\n\n\n### Docker<a id=\"docker\"></a>\n\nYou can easily run Pathway using docker.\n\n#### Pathway image\n\nYou can use the [Pathway docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/pathwaycom/pathway), using a Dockerfile:\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM pathwaycom/pathway:latest\n\nWORKDIR /app\n\nCOPY requirements.txt ./\nRUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt\n\nCOPY . .\n\nCMD [ \"python\", \"./your-script.py\" ]\n```\n\nYou can then build and run the Docker image:\n\n```console\ndocker build -t my-pathway-app .\ndocker run -it --rm --name my-pathway-app my-pathway-app\n```\n\n#### Run a single Python script\n\nWhen dealing with single-file projects, creating a full-fledged `Dockerfile`\nmight seem unnecessary. In such scenarios, you can execute a\nPython script directly using the Pathway Docker image. For example:\n\n```console\ndocker run -it --rm --name my-pathway-app -v \"$PWD\":/app pathwaycom/pathway:latest python my-pathway-app.py\n```\n\n#### Python docker image\n\nYou can also use a standard Python image and install Pathway using pip with a Dockerfile:\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM --platform=linux/x86_64 python:3.10\n\nRUN pip install -U pathway\nCOPY ./pathway-script.py pathway-script.py\n\nCMD [\"python\", \"-u\", \"pathway-script.py\"]\n```\n\n### Kubernetes and cloud<a id=\"k8s\"></a>\n\nDocker containers are ideally suited for deployment on the cloud with Kubernetes.\nIf you want to scale your Pathway application, you may be interested in our Pathway for Enterprise.\nPathway for Enterprise is specially tailored towards end-to-end data processing and real time intelligent analytics.\nIt scales using distributed computing on the cloud and supports distributed Kubernetes deployment, with external persistence setup.\n\nYou can easily deploy Pathway using services like Render: see [how to deploy Pathway in a few clicks](https://pathway.com/developers/user-guide/deployment/render-deploy/).\n\nIf you are interested, don't hesitate to [contact us](mailto:contact@pathway.com) to learn more.\n\n## Performance<a id=\"performance\"></a>\n\nPathway is made to outperform state-of-the-art technologies designed for streaming and batch data processing tasks, including: Flink, Spark, and Kafka Streaming. It also makes it possible to implement a lot of algorithms/UDF's in streaming mode which are not readily supported by other streaming frameworks (especially: temporal joins, iterative graph algorithms, machine learning routines).\n\nIf you are curious, here are [some benchmarks to play with](https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway-benchmarks).\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway-benchmarks/raw/main/images/bm-wordcount-lineplot.png\" width=\"1326\" alt=\"WordCount Graph\"/>\n\n## Documentation and Support<a id=\"resources\"></a>\n\nThe entire documentation of Pathway is available at [pathway.com/developers/](https://pathway.com/developers/), including the [API Docs](https://pathway.com/developers/api-docs/pathway).\n\nIf you have any question, don't hesitate to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway/issues), join us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/pathway), or send us an email at [contact@pathway.com](mailto:contact@pathway.com).\n\n## License<a id=\"license\"></a>\n\nPathway is distributed on a [BSL 1.1 License](https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway/blob/main/LICENSE.txt) which allows for unlimited non-commercial use, as well as use of the Pathway package [for most commercial purposes](https://pathway.com/license/), free of charge.
