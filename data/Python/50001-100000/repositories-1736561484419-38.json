          "content": "Release History\n===============\n\ndev\n---\n\n- \\[Short description of non-trivial change.\\]\n\n2.32.3 (2024-05-29)\n-------------------\n\n**Bugfixes**\n- Fixed bug breaking the ability to specify custom SSLContexts in sub-classes of\n  HTTPAdapter. (#6716)\n- Fixed issue where Requests started failing to run on Python versions compiled\n  without the `ssl` module. (#6724)\n\n2.32.2 (2024-05-21)\n-------------------\n\n**Deprecations**\n- To provide a more stable migration for custom HTTPAdapters impacted\n  by the CVE changes in 2.32.0, we've renamed `_get_connection` to\n  a new public API, `get_connection_with_tls_context`. Existing custom\n  HTTPAdapters will need to migrate their code to use this new API.\n  `get_connection` is considered deprecated in all versions of Requests>=2.32.0.\n\n  A minimal (2-line) example has been provided in the linked PR to ease\n  migration, but we strongly urge users to evaluate if their custom adapter\n  is subject to the same issue described in CVE-2024-35195. (#6710)\n\n2.32.1 (2024-05-20)\n-------------------\n\n**Bugfixes**\n- Add missing test certs to the sdist distributed on PyPI.\n\n\n2.32.0 (2024-05-20)\n-------------------\n\n**Security**\n- Fixed an issue where setting `verify=False` on the first request from a\n  Session will cause subsequent requests to the _same origin_ to also ignore\n  cert verification, regardless of the value of `verify`.\n  (https://github.com/psf/requests/security/advisories/GHSA-9wx4-h78v-vm56)\n\n**Improvements**\n- `verify=True` now reuses a global SSLContext which should improve\n  request time variance between first and subsequent requests. It should\n  also minimize certificate load time on Windows systems when using a Python\n  version built with OpenSSL 3.x. (#6667)\n- Requests now supports optional use of character detection\n  (`chardet` or `charset_normalizer`) when repackaged or vendored.\n  This enables `pip` and other projects to minimize their vendoring\n  surface area. The `Response.text()` and `apparent_encoding` APIs\n  will default to `utf-8` if neither library is present. (#6702)\n\n**Bugfixes**\n- Fixed bug in length detection where emoji length was incorrectly\n  calculated in the request content-length. (#6589)\n- Fixed deserialization bug in JSONDecodeError. (#6629)\n- Fixed bug where an extra leading `/` (path separator) could lead\n  urllib3 to unnecessarily reparse the request URI. (#6644)\n\n**Deprecations**\n\n- Requests has officially added support for CPython 3.12 (#6503)\n- Requests has officially added support for PyPy 3.9 and 3.10 (#6641)\n- Requests has officially dropped support for CPython 3.7 (#6642)\n- Requests has officially dropped support for PyPy 3.7 and 3.8 (#6641)\n\n**Documentation**\n- Various typo fixes and doc improvements.\n\n**Packaging**\n- Requests has started adopting some modern packaging practices.\n  The source files for the projects (formerly `requests`) is now located\n  in `src/requests` in the Requests sdist. (#6506)\n- Starting in Requests 2.33.0, Requests will migrate to a PEP 517 build system\n  using `hatchling`. This should not impact the average user, but extremely old\n  versions of packaging utilities may have issues with the new packaging format.\n\n\n2.31.0 (2023-05-22)\n-------------------\n\n**Security**\n- Versions of Requests between v2.3.0 and v2.30.0 are vulnerable to potential\n  forwarding of `Proxy-Authorization` headers to destination servers when\n  following HTTPS redirects.\n\n  When proxies are defined with user info (`https://user:pass@proxy:8080`), Requests\n  will construct a `Proxy-Authorization` header that is attached to the request to\n  authenticate with the proxy.\n\n  In cases where Requests receives a redirect response, it previously reattached\n  the `Proxy-Authorization` header incorrectly, resulting in the value being\n  sent through the tunneled connection to the destination server. Users who rely on\n  defining their proxy credentials in the URL are *strongly* encouraged to upgrade\n  to Requests 2.31.0+ to prevent unintentional leakage and rotate their proxy\n  credentials once the change has been fully deployed.\n\n  Users who do not use a proxy or do not supply their proxy credentials through\n  the user information portion of their proxy URL are not subject to this\n  vulnerability.\n\n  Full details can be read in our [Github Security Advisory](https://github.com/psf/requests/security/advisories/GHSA-j8r2-6x86-q33q)\n  and [CVE-2023-32681](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32681).\n\n\n2.30.0 (2023-05-03)\n-------------------\n\n**Dependencies**\n- ⚠️ Added support for urllib3 2.0. ⚠️\n\n  This may contain minor breaking changes so we advise careful testing and\n  reviewing https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/v2-migration-guide.html\n  prior to upgrading.\n\n  Users who wish to stay on urllib3 1.x can pin to `urllib3<2`.\n\n2.29.0 (2023-04-26)\n-------------------\n\n**Improvements**\n\n- Requests now defers chunked requests to the urllib3 implementation to improve\n  standardization. (#6226)\n- Requests relaxes header component requirements to support bytes/str subclasses. (#6356)\n\n2.28.2 (2023-01-12)\n-------------------\n\n**Dependencies**\n\n- Requests now supports charset\\_normalizer 3.x. (#6261)\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Updated MissingSchema exception to suggest https scheme rather than http. (#6188)\n\n2.28.1 (2022-06-29)\n-------------------\n\n**Improvements**\n\n- Speed optimization in `iter_content` with transition to `yield from`. (#6170)\n\n**Dependencies**\n\n- Added support for chardet 5.0.0 (#6179)\n- Added support for charset-normalizer 2.1.0 (#6169)\n\n2.28.0 (2022-06-09)\n-------------------\n\n**Deprecations**\n\n- ⚠️ Requests has officially dropped support for Python 2.7. ⚠️ (#6091)\n- Requests has officially dropped support for Python 3.6 (including pypy3.6). (#6091)\n\n**Improvements**\n\n- Wrap JSON parsing issues in Request's JSONDecodeError for payloads without\n  an encoding to make `json()` API consistent. (#6097)\n- Parse header components consistently, raising an InvalidHeader error in\n  all invalid cases. (#6154)\n- Added provisional 3.11 support with current beta build. (#6155)\n- Requests got a makeover and we decided to paint it black. (#6095)\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Fixed bug where setting `CURL_CA_BUNDLE` to an empty string would disable\n  cert verification. All Requests 2.x versions before 2.28.0 are affected. (#6074)\n- Fixed urllib3 exception leak, wrapping `urllib3.exceptions.SSLError` with\n  `requests.exceptions.SSLError` for `content` and `iter_content`. (#6057)\n- Fixed issue where invalid Windows registry entries caused proxy resolution\n  to raise an exception rather than ignoring the entry. (#6149)\n- Fixed issue where entire payload could be included in the error message for\n  JSONDecodeError. (#6036)\n\n2.27.1 (2022-01-05)\n-------------------\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Fixed parsing issue that resulted in the `auth` component being\n  dropped from proxy URLs. (#6028)\n\n2.27.0 (2022-01-03)\n-------------------\n\n**Improvements**\n\n- Officially added support for Python 3.10. (#5928)\n\n- Added a `requests.exceptions.JSONDecodeError` to unify JSON exceptions between\n  Python 2 and 3. This gets raised in the `response.json()` method, and is\n  backwards compatible as it inherits from previously thrown exceptions.\n  Can be caught from `requests.exceptions.RequestException` as well. (#5856)\n\n- Improved error text for misnamed `InvalidSchema` and `MissingSchema`\n  exceptions. This is a temporary fix until exceptions can be renamed\n  (Schema->Scheme). (#6017)\n\n- Improved proxy parsing for proxy URLs missing a scheme. This will address\n  recent changes to `urlparse` in Python 3.9+. (#5917)\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Fixed defect in `extract_zipped_paths` which could result in an infinite loop\n  for some paths. (#5851)\n\n- Fixed handling for `AttributeError` when calculating length of files obtained\n  by `Tarfile.extractfile()`. (#5239)\n\n- Fixed urllib3 exception leak, wrapping `urllib3.exceptions.InvalidHeader` with\n  `requests.exceptions.InvalidHeader`. (#5914)\n\n- Fixed bug where two Host headers were sent for chunked requests. (#5391)\n\n- Fixed regression in Requests 2.26.0 where `Proxy-Authorization` was\n  incorrectly stripped from all requests sent with `Session.send`. (#5924)\n\n- Fixed performance regression in 2.26.0 for hosts with a large number of\n  proxies available in the environment. (#5924)\n\n- Fixed idna exception leak, wrapping `UnicodeError` with\n  `requests.exceptions.InvalidURL` for URLs with a leading dot (.) in the\n  domain. (#5414)\n\n**Deprecations**\n\n- Requests support for Python 2.7 and 3.6 will be ending in 2022. While we\n  don't have exact dates, Requests 2.27.x is likely to be the last release\n  series providing support.\n\n2.26.0 (2021-07-13)\n-------------------\n\n**Improvements**\n\n- Requests now supports Brotli compression, if either the `brotli` or\n  `brotlicffi` package is installed. (#5783)\n\n- `Session.send` now correctly resolves proxy configurations from both\n  the Session and Request. Behavior now matches `Session.request`. (#5681)\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Fixed a race condition in zip extraction when using Requests in parallel\n  from zip archive. (#5707)\n\n**Dependencies**\n\n- Instead of `chardet`, use the MIT-licensed `charset_normalizer` for Python3\n  to remove license ambiguity for projects bundling requests. If `chardet`\n  is already installed on your machine it will be used instead of `charset_normalizer`\n  to keep backwards compatibility. (#5797)\n\n  You can also install `chardet` while installing requests by\n  specifying `[use_chardet_on_py3]` extra as follows:\n\n    ```shell\n    pip install \"requests[use_chardet_on_py3]\"\n    ```\n\n  Python2 still depends upon the `chardet` module.\n\n- Requests now supports `idna` 3.x on Python 3. `idna` 2.x will continue to\n  be used on Python 2 installations. (#5711)\n\n**Deprecations**\n\n- The `requests[security]` extra has been converted to a no-op install.\n  PyOpenSSL is no longer the recommended secure option for Requests. (#5867)\n\n- Requests has officially dropped support for Python 3.5. (#5867)\n\n2.25.1 (2020-12-16)\n-------------------\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Requests now treats `application/json` as `utf8` by default. Resolving\n  inconsistencies between `r.text` and `r.json` output. (#5673)\n\n**Dependencies**\n\n- Requests now supports chardet v4.x.\n\n2.25.0 (2020-11-11)\n-------------------\n\n**Improvements**\n\n- Added support for NETRC environment variable.

Previously pyOpenSSL was unconditionally used if available.\n  This applies even if pyOpenSSL is installed via the\n  `requests[security]` extra (#5443)\n\n- Redirect resolution should now only occur when\n  `allow_redirects` is True. (#5492)\n\n- No longer perform unnecessary Content-Length calculation for\n  requests that won't use it. (#5496)\n\n2.23.0 (2020-02-19)\n-------------------\n\n**Improvements**\n\n- Remove defunct reference to `prefetch` in Session `__attrs__` (#5110)\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Requests no longer outputs password in basic auth usage warning. (#5099)\n\n**Dependencies**\n\n- Pinning for `chardet` and `idna` now uses major version instead of minor.\n  This hopefully reduces the need for releases every time a dependency is updated.\n\n2.22.0 (2019-05-15)\n-------------------\n\n**Dependencies**\n\n- Requests now supports urllib3 v1.25.2.\n  (note: 1.25.0 and 1.25.1 are incompatible)\n\n**Deprecations**\n\n- Requests has officially stopped support for Python 3.4.\n\n2.21.0 (2018-12-10)\n-------------------\n\n**Dependencies**\n\n- Requests now supports idna v2.8.\n\n2.20.1 (2018-11-08)\n-------------------\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n- Fixed bug with unintended Authorization header stripping for\n  redirects using default ports (http/80, https/443).\n\n2.20.0 (2018-10-18)\n-------------------\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n-   Content-Type header parsing is now case-insensitive (e.g.\n    charset=utf8 v Charset=utf8).\n-   Fixed exception leak where certain redirect urls would raise\n    uncaught urllib3 exceptions.\n-   Requests removes Authorization header from requests redirected\n    from https to http on the same hostname. (CVE-2018-18074)\n-   `should_bypass_proxies` now handles URIs without hostnames (e.g.\n    files).\n\n**Dependencies**\n\n- Requests now supports urllib3 v1.24.\n\n**Deprecations**\n\n- Requests has officially stopped support for Python 2.6.\n\n2.19.1 (2018-06-14)\n-------------------\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n-   Fixed issue where status\\_codes.py's `init` function failed trying\n    to append to a `__doc__` value of `None`.\n\n2.19.0 (2018-06-12)\n-------------------\n\n**Improvements**\n\n-   Warn user about possible slowdown when using cryptography version\n    &lt; 1.3.4\n-   Check for invalid host in proxy URL, before forwarding request to\n    adapter.\n-   Fragments are now properly maintained across redirects. (RFC7231\n    7.1.2)\n-   Removed use of cgi module to expedite library load time.\n-   Added support for SHA-256 and SHA-512 digest auth algorithms.\n-   Minor performance improvement to `Request.content`.\n-   Migrate to using collections.abc for 3.7 compatibility.\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n-   Parsing empty `Link` headers with `parse_header_links()` no longer\n    return one bogus entry.\n-   Fixed issue where loading the default certificate bundle from a zip\n    archive would raise an `IOError`.\n-   Fixed issue with unexpected `ImportError` on windows system which do\n    not support `winreg` module.\n-   DNS resolution in proxy bypass no longer includes the username and\n    password in the request. This also fixes the issue of DNS queries\n    failing on macOS.\n-   Properly normalize adapter prefixes for url comparison.\n-   Passing `None` as a file pointer to the `files` param no longer\n    raises an exception.\n-   Calling `copy` on a `RequestsCookieJar` will now preserve the cookie\n    policy correctly.\n\n**Dependencies**\n\n-   We now support idna v2.7.\n-   We now support urllib3 v1.23.\n\n2.18.4 (2017-08-15)\n-------------------\n\n**Improvements**\n\n-   Error messages for invalid headers now include the header name for\n    easier debugging\n\n**Dependencies**\n\n-   We now support idna v2.6.\n\n2.18.3 (2017-08-02)\n-------------------\n\n**Improvements**\n\n-   Running `$ python -m requests.help` now includes the installed\n    version of idna.\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n-   Fixed issue where Requests would raise `ConnectionError` instead of\n    `SSLError` when encountering SSL problems when using urllib3 v1.22.\n\n2.18.2 (2017-07-25)\n-------------------\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n-   `requests.help` no longer fails on Python 2.6 due to the absence of\n    `ssl.OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER`.\n\n**Dependencies**\n\n-   We now support urllib3 v1.22.\n\n2.18.1 (2017-06-14)\n-------------------\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n-   Fix an error in the packaging whereby the `*.whl` contained\n    incorrect data that regressed the fix in v2.17.3.\n\n2.18.0 (2017-06-14)\n-------------------\n\n**Improvements**\n\n-   `Response` is now a context manager, so can be used directly in a\n    `with` statement without first having to be wrapped by\n    `contextlib.closing()`.\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n-   Resolve installation failure if multiprocessing is not available\n-   Resolve tests crash if multiprocessing is not able to determine the\n    number of CPU cores\n-   Resolve error swallowing in utils set\\_environ generator\n\n2.17.3 (2017-05-29)\n-------------------\n\n**Improvements**\n\n-   Improved `packages` namespace identity support, for monkeypatching\n    libraries.\n\n2.17.2 (2017-05-29)\n-------------------\n\n**Improvements**\n\n-   Improved `packages` namespace identity support, for monkeypatching\n    libraries.\n\n2.17.1 (2017-05-29)\n-------------------\n\n**Improvements**\n\n-   Improved `packages` namespace identity support, for monkeypatching\n    libraries.\n\n2.17.0 (2017-05-29)\n-------------------\n\n**Improvements**\n\n-   Removal of the 301 redirect cache. This improves thread-safety.\n\n2.16.5 (2017-05-28)\n-------------------\n\n-   Improvements to `$ python -m requests.help`.\n\n2.16.4 (2017-05-27)\n-------------------\n\n-   Introduction of the `$ python -m requests.help` command, for\n    debugging with maintainers!\n\n2.16.3 (2017-05-27)\n-------------------\n\n-   Further restored the `requests.packages` namespace for compatibility\n    reasons.\n\n2.16.2 (2017-05-27)\n-------------------\n\n-   Further restored the `requests.packages` namespace for compatibility\n    reasons.\n\nNo code modification (noted below) should be necessary any longer.\n\n2.16.1 (2017-05-27)\n-------------------\n\n-   Restored the `requests.packages` namespace for compatibility\n    reasons.\n-   Bugfix for `urllib3` version parsing.\n\n**Note**: code that was written to import against the\n`requests.packages` namespace previously will have to import code that\nrests at this module-level now.\n\nFor example:\n\n    from requests.packages.urllib3.poolmanager import PoolManager\n\nWill need to be re-written to be:\n\n    from requests.packages import urllib3\n    urllib3.poolmanager.PoolManager\n\nOr, even better:\n\n    from urllib3.poolmanager import PoolManager\n\n2.16.0 (2017-05-26)\n-------------------\n\n-   Unvendor ALL the things!\n\n2.15.1 (2017-05-26)\n-------------------\n\n-   Everyone makes mistakes.\n\n2.15.0 (2017-05-26)\n-------------------\n\n**Improvements**\n\n-   Introduction of the `Response.next` property, for getting the next\n    `PreparedResponse` from a redirect chain (when\n    `allow_redirects=False`).\n-   Internal refactoring of `__version__` module.\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n-   Restored once-optional parameter for\n    `requests.utils.get_environ_proxies()`.\n\n2.14.2 (2017-05-10)\n-------------------\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n-   Changed a less-than to an equal-to and an or in the dependency\n    markers to widen compatibility with older setuptools releases.\n\n2.14.1 (2017-05-09)\n-------------------\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n-   Changed the dependency markers to widen compatibility with older pip\n    releases.\n\n2.14.0 (2017-05-09)\n-------------------\n\n**Improvements**\n\n-   It is now possible to pass `no_proxy` as a key to the `proxies`\n    dictionary to provide handling similar to the `NO_PROXY` environment\n    variable.\n-   When users provide invalid paths to certificate bundle files or\n    directories Requests now raises `IOError`, rather than failing at\n    the time of the HTTPS request with a fairly inscrutable certificate\n    validation error.\n-   The behavior of `SessionRedirectMixin` was slightly altered.\n    `resolve_redirects` will now detect a redirect by calling\n    `get_redirect_target(response)` instead of directly querying\n    `Response.is_redirect` and `Response.headers['location']`. Advanced\n    users will be able to process malformed redirects more easily.\n-   Changed the internal calculation of elapsed request time to have\n    higher resolution on Windows.\n-   Added `win_inet_pton` as conditional dependency for the `[socks]`\n    extra on Windows with Python 2.7.\n-   Changed the proxy bypass implementation on Windows: the proxy bypass\n    check doesn't use forward and reverse DNS requests anymore\n-   URLs with schemes that begin with `http` but are not `http` or\n    `https` no longer have their host parts forced to lowercase.\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n-   Much improved handling of non-ASCII `Location` header values in\n    redirects. Fewer `UnicodeDecodeErrors` are encountered on Python 2,\n    and Python 3 now correctly understands that Latin-1 is unlikely to\n    be the correct encoding.\n-   If an attempt to `seek` file to find out its length fails, we now\n    appropriately handle that by aborting our content-length\n    calculations.\n-   Restricted `HTTPDigestAuth` to only respond to auth challenges made\n    on 4XX responses, rather than to all auth challenges.\n-   Fixed some code that was firing `DeprecationWarning` on Python 3.6.\n-   The dismayed person emoticon (`/o\\\\`) no longer has a big head. I'm\n    sure this is what you were all worrying about most.\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\n-   Updated bundled urllib3 to v1.21.1.\n-   Updated bundled chardet to v3.0.2.\n-   Updated bundled idna to v2.5.\n-   Updated bundled certifi to 2017.4.17.\n\n2.13.0 (2017-01-24)\n-------------------\n\n**Features**\n\n-   Only load the `idna` library when we've determined we need it. This\n    will save some memory for users.\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\n-   Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.20.\n-   Updated bundled idna to 2.2.\n\n2.12.5 (2017-01-18)\n-------------------\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n-   Fixed an issue with JSON encoding detection, specifically detecting\n    big-endian UTF-32 with BOM.\n\n2.12.4 (2016-12-14)\n-------------------\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n-   Fixed regression from 2.12.2 where non-string types were rejected in\n    the basic auth parameters. While support for this behaviour has been\n    re-added, the behaviour is deprecated and will be removed in the\n    future.\n\n2.12.3 (2016-12-01)\n-------------------\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n-   Fixed regression from v2.12.1 for URLs with schemes that begin with\n    \"http\". These URLs have historically been processed as though they\n    were HTTP-schemed URLs, and so have had parameters added. This was\n    removed in v2.12.2 in an overzealous attempt to resolve problems\n    with IDNA-encoding those URLs. This change was reverted: the other\n    fixes for IDNA-encoding have been judged to be sufficient to return\n    to the behaviour Requests had before v2.12.0.\n\n2.12.2 (2016-11-30)\n-------------------\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n-   Fixed several issues with IDNA-encoding URLs that are technically\n    invalid but which are widely accepted. Requests will now attempt to\n    IDNA-encode a URL if it can but, if it fails, and the host contains\n    only ASCII characters, it will be passed through optimistically.\n    This will allow users to opt-in to using IDNA2003 themselves if they\n    want to, and will also allow technically invalid but still common\n    hostnames.\n-   Fixed an issue where URLs with leading whitespace would raise\n    `InvalidSchema` errors.\n-   Fixed an issue where some URLs without the HTTP or HTTPS schemes\n    would still have HTTP URL preparation applied to them.\n-   Fixed an issue where Unicode strings could not be used in basic\n    auth.\n-   Fixed an issue encountered by some Requests plugins where\n    constructing a Response object would cause `Response.content` to\n    raise an `AttributeError`.\n\n2.12.1 (2016-11-16)\n-------------------\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n-   Updated setuptools 'security' extra for the new PyOpenSSL backend in\n    urllib3.\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\n-   Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.19.1.\n\n2.12.0 (2016-11-15)\n-------------------\n\n**Improvements**\n\n-   Updated support for internationalized domain names from IDNA2003 to\n    IDNA2008. This updated support is required for several forms of IDNs\n    and is mandatory for .de domains.\n-   Much improved heuristics for guessing content lengths: Requests will\n    no longer read an entire `StringIO` into memory.\n-   Much improved logic for recalculating `Content-Length` headers for\n    `PreparedRequest` objects.\n-   Improved tolerance for file-like objects that have no `tell` method\n    but do have a `seek` method.\n-   Anything that is a subclass of `Mapping` is now treated like a\n    dictionary by the `data=` keyword argument.\n-   Requests now tolerates empty passwords in proxy credentials, rather\n    than stripping the credentials.\n-   If a request is made with a file-like object as the body and that\n    request is redirected with a 307 or 308 status code, Requests will\n    now attempt to rewind the body object so it can be replayed.\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n-   When calling `response.close`, the call to `close` will be\n    propagated through to non-urllib3 backends.\n-   Fixed issue where the `ALL_PROXY` environment variable would be\n    preferred over scheme-specific variables like `HTTP_PROXY`.\n-   Fixed issue where non-UTF8 reason phrases got severely mangled by\n    falling back to decoding using ISO 8859-1 instead.\n-   Fixed a bug where Requests would not correctly correlate cookies set\n    when using custom Host headers if those Host headers did not use the\n    native string type for the platform.\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\n-   Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.19.\n-   Updated bundled certifi certs to 2016.09.26.\n\n2.11.1 (2016-08-17)\n-------------------\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n-   Fixed a bug when using `iter_content` with `decode_unicode=True` for\n    streamed bodies would raise `AttributeError`. This bug was\n    introduced in 2.11.\n-   Strip Content-Type and Transfer-Encoding headers from the header\n    block when following a redirect that transforms the verb from\n    POST/PUT to GET.\n\n2.11.0 (2016-08-08)\n-------------------\n\n**Improvements**\n\n-   Added support for the `ALL_PROXY` environment variable.\n-   Reject header values that contain leading whitespace or newline\n    characters to reduce risk of header smuggling.\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n-   Fixed occasional `TypeError` when attempting to decode a JSON\n    response that occurred in an error case. Now correctly returns a\n    `ValueError`.\n-   Requests would incorrectly ignore a non-CIDR IP address in the\n    `NO_PROXY` environment variables: Requests now treats it as a\n    specific IP.\n-   Fixed a bug when sending JSON data that could cause us to encounter\n    obscure OpenSSL errors in certain network conditions (yes, really).\n-   Added type checks to ensure that `iter_content` only accepts\n    integers and `None` for chunk sizes.\n-   Fixed issue where responses whose body had not been fully consumed\n    would have the underlying connection closed but not returned to the\n    connection pool, which could cause Requests to hang in situations\n    where the `HTTPAdapter` had been configured to use a blocking\n    connection pool.\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\n-   Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.16.\n-   Some previous releases accidentally accepted non-strings as\n    acceptable header values. This release does not.\n\n2.10.0 (2016-04-29)\n-------------------\n\n**New Features**\n\n-   SOCKS Proxy Support! (requires PySocks;\n    `$ pip install requests[socks]`)\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\n-   Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.15.1.\n\n2.9.2 (2016-04-29)\n------------------\n\n**Improvements**\n\n-   Change built-in CaseInsensitiveDict (used for headers) to use\n    OrderedDict as its underlying datastore.\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n-   Don't use redirect\\_cache if allow\\_redirects=False\n-   When passed objects that throw exceptions from `tell()`, send them\n    via chunked transfer encoding instead of failing.\n-   Raise a ProxyError for proxy related connection issues.\n\n2.9.1 (2015-12-21)\n------------------\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n-   Resolve regression introduced in 2.9.0 that made it impossible to\n    send binary strings as bodies in Python 3.\n-   Fixed errors when calculating cookie expiration dates in certain\n    locales.\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\n-   Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.13.1.\n\n2.9.0 (2015-12-15)\n------------------\n\n**Minor Improvements** (Backwards compatible)\n\n-   The `verify` keyword argument now supports being passed a path to a\n    directory of CA certificates, not just a single-file bundle.\n-   Warnings are now emitted when sending files opened in text mode.\n-   Added the 511 Network Authentication Required status code to the\n    status code registry.\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n-   For file-like objects that are not sought to the very beginning, we\n    now send the content length for the number of bytes we will actually\n    read, rather than the total size of the file, allowing partial file\n    uploads.\n-   When uploading file-like objects, if they are empty or have no\n    obvious content length we set `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` rather\n    than `Content-Length: 0`.\n-   We correctly receive the response in buffered mode when uploading\n    chunked bodies.\n-   We now handle being passed a query string as a bytestring on Python\n    3, by decoding it as UTF-8.\n-   Sessions are now closed in all cases (exceptional and not) when\n    using the functional API rather than leaking and waiting for the\n    garbage collector to clean them up.\n-   Correctly handle digest auth headers with a malformed `qop`\n    directive that contains no token, by treating it the same as if no\n    `qop` directive was provided at all.\n-   Minor performance improvements when removing specific cookies by\n    name.\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\n-   Updated urllib3 to 1.13.\n\n2.8.1 (2015-10-13)\n------------------\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n-   Update certificate bundle to match `certifi` 2015.9.6.2's weak\n    certificate bundle.\n-   Fix a bug in 2.8.0 where requests would raise `ConnectTimeout`\n    instead of `ConnectionError`\n-   When using the PreparedRequest flow, requests will now correctly\n    respect the `json` parameter. Broken in 2.8.0.\n-   When using the PreparedRequest flow, requests will now correctly\n    handle a Unicode-string method name on Python 2. Broken in 2.8.0.\n\n2.8.0 (2015-10-05)\n------------------\n\n**Minor Improvements** (Backwards Compatible)\n\n-   Requests now supports per-host proxies. This allows the `proxies`\n    dictionary to have entries of the form\n    `{'<scheme>://<hostname>': '<proxy>'}`. Host-specific proxies will\n    be used in preference to the previously-supported scheme-specific\n    ones, but the previous syntax will continue to work.\n-   `Response.raise_for_status` now prints the URL that failed as part\n    of the exception message.\n-   `requests.utils.get_netrc_auth` now takes an `raise_errors` kwarg,\n    defaulting to `False`. When `True`, errors parsing `.netrc` files\n    cause exceptions to be thrown.\n-   Change to bundled projects import logic to make it easier to\n    unbundle requests downstream.\n-   Changed the default User-Agent string to avoid leaking data on\n    Linux: now contains only the requests version.\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n-   The `json` parameter to `post()` and friends will now only be used\n    if neither `data` nor `files` are present, consistent with the\n    documentation.\n-   We now ignore empty fields in the `NO_PROXY` environment variable.\n-   Fixed problem where `httplib.BadStatusLine` would get raised if\n    combining `stream=True` with `contextlib.closing`.\n-   Prevented bugs where we would attempt to return the same connection\n    back to the connection pool twice when sending a Chunked body.\n-   Miscellaneous minor internal changes.\n-   Digest Auth support is now thread safe.\n\n**Updates**\n\n-   Updated urllib3 to 1.12.\n\n2.7.0 (2015-05-03)\n------------------\n\nThis is the first release that follows our new release process. For\nmore, see [our\ndocumentation](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/community/release-process/).\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n-   Updated urllib3 to 1.10.4, resolving several bugs involving chunked\n    transfer encoding and response framing.\n\n2.6.2 (2015-04-23)\n------------------\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n-   Fix regression where compressed data that was sent as chunked data\n    was not properly decompressed. (\\#2561)\n\n2.6.1 (2015-04-22)\n------------------\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n-   Remove VendorAlias import machinery introduced in v2.5.2.\n-   Simplify the PreparedRequest.prepare API: We no longer require the\n    user to pass an empty list to the hooks keyword argument. (c.f.\n    \\#2552)\n-   Resolve redirects now receives and forwards all of the original\n    arguments to the adapter. (\\#2503)\n-   Handle UnicodeDecodeErrors when trying to deal with a unicode URL\n    that cannot be encoded in ASCII. (\\#2540)\n-   Populate the parsed path of the URI field when performing Digest\n    Authentication. (\\#2426)\n-   Copy a PreparedRequest's CookieJar more reliably when it is not an\n    instance of RequestsCookieJar. (\\#2527)\n\n2.6.0 (2015-03-14)\n------------------\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n-   CVE-2015-2296: Fix handling of cookies on redirect. Previously a\n    cookie without a host value set would use the hostname for the\n    redirected URL exposing requests users to session fixation attacks\n    and potentially cookie stealing. This was disclosed privately by\n    Matthew Daley of [BugFuzz](https://bugfuzz.com). This affects all\n    versions of requests from v2.1.0 to v2.5.3 (inclusive on both ends).\n-   Fix error when requests is an `install_requires` dependency and\n    `python setup.py test` is run. (\\#2462)\n-   Fix error when urllib3 is unbundled and requests continues to use\n    the vendored import location.\n-   Include fixes to `urllib3`'s header handling.\n-   Requests' handling of unvendored dependencies is now more\n    restrictive.\n\n**Features and Improvements**\n\n-   Support bytearrays when passed as parameters in the `files`\n    argument. (\\#2468)\n-   Avoid data duplication when creating a request with `str`, `bytes`,\n    or `bytearray` input to the `files` argument.\n\n2.5.3 (2015-02-24)\n------------------\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n-   Revert changes to our vendored certificate bundle. For more context\n    see (\\#2455, \\#2456, and <https://bugs.python.org/issue23476>)\n\n2.5.2 (2015-02-23)\n------------------\n\n**Features and Improvements**\n\n-   Add sha256 fingerprint support.\n    ([shazow/urllib3\\#540](https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/pull/540))\n-   Improve the performance of headers.\n    ([shazow/urllib3\\#544](https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/pull/544))\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n-   Copy pip's import machinery. When downstream redistributors remove\n    requests.packages.urllib3 the import machinery will continue to let\n    those same symbols work. Example usage in requests' documentation\n    and 3rd-party libraries relying on the vendored copies of urllib3\n    will work without having to fallback to the system urllib3.\n-   Attempt to quote parts of the URL on redirect if unquoting and then\n    quoting fails.
