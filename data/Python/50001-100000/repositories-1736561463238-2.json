Unless you were prompted to or there is another pertinent reason (e.g. GitHub fails to accept the bug report), please do not send bug reports via personal email. For discussions, join us in our [discord server](https://discord.gg/H5MNcFW63r).\n\n**Please include the full output of yt-dlp when run with `-vU`**, i.e. **add** `-vU` flag to **your command line**, copy the **whole** output and post it in the issue body wrapped in \\`\\`\\` for better formatting. It should look similar to this:\n```\n$ yt-dlp -vU <your command line>\n[debug] Command-line config: ['-vU', 'https://www.example.com/']\n[debug] Encodings: locale cp65001, fs utf-8, pref cp65001, out utf-8, error utf-8, screen utf-8\n[debug] yt-dlp version nightly@... from yt-dlp/yt-dlp-nightly-builds [1a176d874] (win_exe)\n[debug] Python 3.10.11 (CPython AMD64 64bit) - Windows-10-10.0.20348-SP0 (OpenSSL 1.1.1t  7 Feb 2023)\n[debug] exe versions: ffmpeg 7.0.2 (setts), ffprobe 7.0.2\n[debug] Optional libraries: Cryptodome-3.21.0, brotli-1.1.0, certifi-2024.08.30, curl_cffi-0.5.10, mutagen-1.47.0, requests-2.32.3, sqlite3-3.40.1, urllib3-2.2.3, websockets-13.1\n[debug] Proxy map: {}\n[debug] Request Handlers: urllib, requests, websockets, curl_cffi\n[debug] Loaded 1838 extractors\n[debug] Fetching release info: https://api.github.com/repos/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest\nLatest version: nightly@... from yt-dlp/yt-dlp-nightly-builds\nyt-dlp is up to date (nightly@... from yt-dlp/yt-dlp-nightly-builds)\n...\n```\n**Do not post screenshots of verbose logs; only plain text is acceptable.**\n\nThe output (including the first lines) contains important debugging information. Issues without the full output are often not reproducible and therefore will be closed as `incomplete`.\n\nThe templates provided for the Issues, should be completed and **not removed**, this helps aide the resolution of the issue.\n\nPlease re-read your issue once again to avoid a couple of common mistakes (you can and should use this as a checklist):\n\n### Is the description of the issue itself sufficient?\n\nWe often get issue reports that we cannot really decipher. While in most cases we eventually get the required information after asking back multiple times, this poses an unnecessary drain on our resources.\n\nSo please elaborate on what feature you are requesting, or what bug you want to be fixed. Make sure that it's obvious\n\n- What the problem is\n- How it could be fixed\n- How your proposed solution would look like\n\nIf your report is shorter than two lines, it is almost certainly missing some of these, which makes it hard for us to respond to it. We're often too polite to close the issue outright, but the missing info makes misinterpretation likely. We often get frustrated by these issues, since the only possible way for us to move forward on them is to ask for clarification over and over.\n\nFor bug reports, this means that your report should contain the **complete** output of yt-dlp when called with the `-vU` flag. The error message you get for (most) bugs even says so, but you would not believe how many of our bug reports do not contain this information.\n\nIf the error is `ERROR: Unable to extract ...` and you cannot reproduce it from multiple countries, add `--write-pages` and upload the `.dump` files you get [somewhere](https://gist.github.com).\n\n**Site support requests must contain an example URL**. An example URL is a URL you might want to download, like `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaW_jenozKc`. There should be an obvious video present. Except under very special circumstances, the main page of a video service (e.g. `https://www.youtube.com/`) is *not* an example URL.\n\n###  Are you using the latest version?\n\nBefore reporting any issue, type `yt-dlp -U`. This should report that you're up-to-date. This goes for feature requests as well.\n\n###  Is the issue already documented?\n\nMake sure that someone has not already opened the issue you're trying to open. Search at the top of the window or browse the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/search?type=Issues) of this repository. If there is an issue, subscribe to it to be notified when there is any progress. Unless you have something useful to add to the conversation, please refrain from commenting.\n\nAdditionally, it is also helpful to see if the issue has already been documented in the [youtube-dl issue tracker](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/issues). If similar issues have already been reported in youtube-dl (but not in our issue tracker), links to them can be included in your issue report here.\n\n###  Why are existing options not enough?\n\nBefore requesting a new feature, please have a quick peek at [the list of supported options](README.md#usage-and-options). Many feature requests are for features that actually exist already! Please, absolutely do show off your work in the issue report and detail how the existing similar options do *not* solve your problem.\n\n###  Have you read and understood the changes, between youtube-dl and yt-dlp\n\nThere are many changes between youtube-dl and yt-dlp [(changes to default behavior)](README.md#differences-in-default-behavior), and some of the options available have a different behaviour in yt-dlp, or have been removed all together [(list of changes to options)](README.md#deprecated-options). Make sure you have read and understand the differences in the options and how this may impact your downloads before opening an issue.\n\n###  Is there enough context in your bug report?\n\nPeople want to solve problems, and often think they do us a favor by breaking down their larger problems (e.g. wanting to skip already downloaded files) to a specific request (e.g. requesting us to look whether the file exists before downloading the info page). However, what often happens is that they break down the problem into two steps: One simple, and one impossible (or extremely complicated one).\n\nWe are then presented with a very complicated request when the original problem could be solved far easier, e.g. by recording the downloaded video IDs in a separate file. To avoid this, you must include the greater context where it is non-obvious. In particular, every feature request that does not consist of adding support for a new site should contain a use case scenario that explains in what situation the missing feature would be useful.\n\n###  Does the issue involve one problem, and one problem only?\n\nSome of our users seem to think there is a limit of issues they can or should open. There is no limit of issues they can or should open. While it may seem appealing to be able to dump all your issues into one ticket, that means that someone who solves one of your issues cannot mark the issue as closed. Typically, reporting a bunch of issues leads to the ticket lingering since nobody wants to attack that behemoth, until someone mercifully splits the issue into multiple ones.\n\nIn particular, every site support request issue should only pertain to services at one site (generally under a common domain, but always using the same backend technology). Do not request support for vimeo user videos, White house podcasts, and Google Plus pages in the same issue. Also, make sure that you don't post bug reports alongside feature requests. As a rule of thumb, a feature request does not include outputs of yt-dlp that are not immediately related to the feature at hand. Do not post reports of a network error alongside the request for a new video service.\n\n###  Is anyone going to need the feature?\n\nOnly post features that you (or an incapacitated friend you can personally talk to) require. Do not post features because they seem like a good idea. If they are really useful, they will be requested by someone who requires them.\n\n###  Is your question about yt-dlp?\n\nSome bug reports are completely unrelated to yt-dlp and relate to a different, or even the reporter's own, application. Please make sure that you are actually using yt-dlp. If you are using a UI for yt-dlp, report the bug to the maintainer of the actual application providing the UI. In general, if you are unable to provide the verbose log, you should not be opening the issue here.\n\nIf the issue is with `youtube-dl` (the upstream fork of yt-dlp) and not with yt-dlp, the issue should be raised in the youtube-dl project.\n\n### Are you willing to share account details if needed?\n\nThe maintainers and potential contributors of the project often do not have an account for the website you are asking support for. So any developer interested in solving your issue may ask you for account details. It is your personal discretion whether you are willing to share the account in order for the developer to try and solve your issue. However, if you are unwilling or unable to provide details, they obviously cannot work on the issue and it cannot be solved unless some developer who both has an account and is willing/able to contribute decides to solve it.\n\nBy sharing an account with anyone, you agree to bear all risks associated with it. The maintainers and yt-dlp can't be held responsible for any misuse of the credentials.\n\nWhile these steps won't necessarily ensure that no misuse of the account takes place, these are still some good practices to follow.\n\n- Look for people with `Member` (maintainers of the project) or `Contributor` (people who have previously contributed code) tag on their messages.\n- Change the password before sharing the account to something random (use [this](https://passwordsgenerator.net/) if you don't have a random password generator).\n- Change the password after receiving the account back.\n\n### Is the website primarily used for piracy?\n\nWe follow [youtube-dl's policy](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl#can-you-add-support-for-this-anime-video-site-or-site-which-shows-current-movies-for-free) to not support services that is primarily used for infringing copyright. Additionally, it has been decided to not to support porn sites that specialize in fakes. We also cannot support any service that serves only [DRM protected content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management).\n\n\n\n\n# DEVELOPER INSTRUCTIONS\n\nMost users do not need to build yt-dlp and can [download the builds](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases), get them via [the other installation methods](README.md#installation) or directly run it using `python -m yt_dlp`.\n\n`yt-dlp` uses [`hatch`](<https://hatch.pypa.io>) as a project management tool.\nYou can easily install it using [`pipx`](<https://pipx.pypa.io>) via `pipx install hatch`, or else via `pip` or your package manager of choice. Make sure you are using at least version `1.10.0`, otherwise some functionality might not work as expected.\n\nIf you plan on contributing to `yt-dlp`, best practice is to start by running the following command:\n\n```shell\n$ hatch run setup\n```\n\nThe above command will install a `pre-commit` hook so that required checks/fixes (linting, formatting) will run automatically before each commit. If any code needs to be linted or formatted, then the commit will be blocked and the necessary changes will be made; you should review all edits and re-commit the fixed version.\n\nAfter this you can use `hatch shell` to enable a virtual environment that has `yt-dlp` and its development dependencies installed.\n\nIn addition, the following script commands can be used to run simple tasks such as linting or testing (without having to run `hatch shell` first):\n* `hatch fmt`: Automatically fix linter violations and apply required code formatting changes\n    * See `hatch fmt --help` for more info\n* `hatch test`: Run extractor or core tests\n    * See `hatch test --help` for more info\n\nSee item 6 of [new extractor tutorial](#adding-support-for-a-new-site) for how to run extractor specific test cases.\n\nWhile it is strongly recommended to use `hatch` for yt-dlp development, if you are unable to do so, alternatively you can manually create a virtual environment and use the following commands:\n\n```shell\n# To only install development dependencies:\n$ python -m devscripts.install_deps --include dev\n\n# Or, for an editable install plus dev dependencies:\n$ python -m pip install -e \".[default,dev]\"\n\n# To setup the pre-commit hook:\n$ pre-commit install\n\n# To be used in place of `hatch test`:\n$ python -m devscripts.run_tests\n\n# To be used in place of `hatch fmt`:\n$ ruff check --fix .\n$ autopep8 --in-place .\n\n# To only check code instead of applying fixes:\n$ ruff check .\n$ autopep8 --diff .\n```\n\nIf you want to create a build of yt-dlp yourself, you can follow the instructions [here](README.md#compile).\n\n\n## Adding new feature or making overarching changes\n\nBefore you start writing code for implementing a new feature, open an issue explaining your feature request and at least one use case. This allows the maintainers to decide whether such a feature is desired for the project in the first place, and will provide an avenue to discuss some implementation details. If you open a pull request for a new feature without discussing with us first, do not be surprised when we ask for large changes to the code, or even reject it outright.\n\nThe same applies for changes to the documentation, code style, or overarching changes to the architecture\n\n\n## Adding support for a new site\n\nIf you want to add support for a new site, first of all **make sure** this site is **not dedicated to [copyright infringement](#is-the-website-primarily-used-for-piracy)**. yt-dlp does **not support** such sites thus pull requests adding support for them **will be rejected**.\n\nAfter you have ensured this site is distributing its content legally, you can follow this quick list (assuming your service is called `yourextractor`):\n\n1. [Fork this repository](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/fork)\n1. Check out the source code with:\n\n    ```shell\n    $ git clone git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/yt-dlp.git\n    ```\n\n1. Start a new git branch with\n\n    ```shell\n    $ cd yt-dlp\n    $ git checkout -b yourextractor\n    ```\n\n1. Start with this simple template and save it to `yt_dlp/extractor/yourextractor.py`:\n\n    ```python\n    from .common import InfoExtractor\n\n\n    class YourExtractorIE(InfoExtractor):\n        _VALID_URL = r'https?://(?:www\\.)?yourextractor\\.com/watch/(?P<id>[0-9]+)'\n        _TESTS = [{\n            'url': 'https://yourextractor.com/watch/42',\n            'md5': 'TODO: md5 sum of the first 10241 bytes of the video file (use --test)',\n            'info_dict': {\n                # For videos, only the 'id' and 'ext' fields are required to RUN the test:\n                'id': '42',\n                'ext': 'mp4',\n                # Then if the test run fails, it will output the missing/incorrect fields.\n                # Properties can be added as:\n                # * A value, e.g.\n                #     'title': 'Video title goes here',\n                # * MD5 checksum; start the string with 'md5:', e.g.\n                #     'description': 'md5:098f6bcd4621d373cade4e832627b4f6',\n                # * A regular expression; start the string with 're:', e.g.\n                #     'thumbnail': r're:https?://.*\\.jpg$',\n                # * A count of elements in a list; start the string with 'count:', e.g.\n                #     'tags': 'count:10',\n                # * Any Python type, e.g.\n                #     'view_count': int,\n            }\n        }]\n\n        def _real_extract(self, url):\n            video_id = self._match_id(url)\n            webpage = self._download_webpage(url, video_id)\n\n            # TODO more code goes here, for example ...\n            title = self._html_search_regex(r'<h1>(.+?)</h1>', webpage, 'title')\n\n            return {\n                'id': video_id,\n                'title': title,\n                'description': self._og_search_description(webpage),\n                'uploader': self._search_regex(r'<div[^>]+id=\"uploader\"[^>]*>([^<]+)<', webpage, 'uploader', fatal=False),\n                # TODO more properties (see yt_dlp/extractor/common.py)\n            }\n    ```\n1. Add an import in [`yt_dlp/extractor/_extractors.py`](yt_dlp/extractor/_extractors.py). Note that the class name must end with `IE`. Also note that when adding a parenthesized import group, the last import in the group must have a trailing comma in order for this formatting to be respected by our code formatter.\n1. Run `hatch test YourExtractor`. This *may fail* at first, but you can continually re-run it until you're done. Upon failure, it will output the missing fields and/or correct values which you can copy. If you decide to add more than one test, the tests will then be named `YourExtractor`, `YourExtractor_1`, `YourExtractor_2`, etc. Note that tests with an `only_matching` key in the test's dict are not included in the count. You can also run all the tests in one go with `YourExtractor_all`\n1. Make sure you have at least one test for your extractor. Even if all videos covered by the extractor are expected to be inaccessible for automated testing, tests should still be added with a `skip` parameter indicating why the particular test is disabled from running.\n1. Have a look at [`yt_dlp/extractor/common.py`](yt_dlp/extractor/common.py) for possible helper methods and a [detailed description of what your extractor should and may return](yt_dlp/extractor/common.py#L119-L440). Add tests and code for as many as you want.\n1. Make sure your code follows [yt-dlp coding conventions](#yt-dlp-coding-conventions), passes [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/tutorial/#getting-started) code checks and is properly formatted:\n\n    ```shell\n    $ hatch fmt --check\n    ```\n\n    You can use `hatch fmt` to automatically fix problems. Rules that the linter/formatter enforces should not be disabled with `# noqa` unless a maintainer requests it. The only exception allowed is for old/printf-style string formatting in GraphQL query templates (use `# noqa: UP031`).\n\n1. Make sure your code works under all [Python](https://www.python.org/) versions supported by yt-dlp, namely CPython >=3.9 and PyPy >=3.10. Backward compatibility is not required for even older versions of Python.\n1. When the tests pass, [add](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add) the new files, [commit](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit) them and [push](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push) the result, like this:\n\n    ```shell\n    $ git add yt_dlp/extractor/_extractors.py\n    $ git add yt_dlp/extractor/yourextractor.py\n    $ git commit -m '[yourextractor] Add extractor'\n    $ git push origin yourextractor\n    ```\n\n1. Finally, [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request). We'll then review and merge it.\n\nIn any case, thank you very much for your contributions!\n\n**Tip:** To test extractors that require login information, create a file `test/local_parameters.json` and add `\"usenetrc\": true` or your `username`&`password` or `cookiefile`/`cookiesfrombrowser` in it:\n```json\n{\n    \"username\": \"your user name\",\n    \"password\": \"your password\"\n}\n```\n\n## yt-dlp coding conventions\n\nThis section introduces a guide lines for writing idiomatic, robust and future-proof extractor code.\n\nExtractors are very fragile by nature since they depend on the layout of the source data provided by 3rd party media hosters out of your control and this layout tends to change. As an extractor implementer your task is not only to write code that will extract media links and metadata correctly but also to minimize dependency on the source's layout and even to make the code foresee potential future changes and be ready for that. This is important because it will allow the extractor not to break on minor layout changes thus keeping old yt-dlp versions working. Even though this breakage issue may be easily fixed by a new version of yt-dlp, this could take some time, during which the extractor will remain broken.\n\n\n### Mandatory and optional metafields\n\nFor extraction to work yt-dlp relies on metadata your extractor extracts and provides to yt-dlp expressed by an [information dictionary](yt_dlp/extractor/common.py#L119-L440) or simply *info dict*. Only the following meta fields in the *info dict* are considered mandatory for a successful extraction process by yt-dlp:\n\n - `id` (media identifier)\n - `url` (media download URL) or `formats`\n\nThe aforementioned metadata fields are the critical data without which extraction does not make any sense. If any of them fail to be extracted, then the extractor is considered broken. All other metadata extraction should be completely non-fatal.\n\nFor pornographic sites, appropriate `age_limit` must also be returned.\n\nThe extractor is allowed to return the info dict without url or formats in some special cases if it allows the user to extract useful information with `--ignore-no-formats-error` - e.g. when the video is a live stream that has not started yet.\n\n[Any field](yt_dlp/extractor/common.py#219-L426) apart from the aforementioned ones are considered **optional**. That means that extraction should be **tolerant** to situations when sources for these fields can potentially be unavailable (even if they are always available at the moment) and **future-proof** in order not to break the extraction of general purpose mandatory fields.\n\n#### Example\n\nSay you have some source dictionary `meta` that you've fetched as JSON with HTTP request and it has a key `summary`:\n\n```python\nmeta = self._download_json(url, video_id)\n```\n\nAssume at this point `meta`'s layout is:\n\n```python\n{\n    \"summary\": \"some fancy summary text\",\n    \"user\": {\n        \"name\": \"uploader name\"\n    },\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nAssume you want to extract `summary` and put it into the resulting info dict as `description`. Since `description` is an optional meta field you should be ready that this key may be missing from the `meta` dict, so that you should extract it like:\n\n```python\ndescription = meta.get('summary')  # correct\n```\n\nand not like:\n\n```python\ndescription = meta['summary']  # incorrect\n```\n\nThe latter will break extraction process with `KeyError` if `summary` disappears from `meta` at some later time but with the former approach extraction will just go ahead with `description` set to `None` which is perfectly fine (remember `None` is equivalent to the absence of data).\n\n\nIf the data is nested, do not use `.get` chains, but instead make use of `traverse_obj`.\n\nConsidering the above `meta` again, assume you want to extract `[\"user\"][\"name\"]` and put it in the resulting info dict as `uploader`\n\n```python\nuploader = traverse_obj(meta, ('user', 'name'))  # correct\n```\n\nand not like:\n\n```python\nuploader = meta['user']['name']  # incorrect\n```\nor\n```python\nuploader = meta.get('user', {}).get('name')  # incorrect\n```\nor\n```python\nuploader = try_get(meta, lambda x: x['user']['name'])  # old utility\n```\n\n\nSimilarly, you should pass `fatal=False` when extracting optional data from a webpage with `_search_regex`, `_html_search_regex` or similar methods, for instance:\n\n```python\ndescription = self._search_regex(\n    r'<span[^>]+id=\"title\"[^>]*>([^<]+)<',\n    webpage, 'description', fatal=False)\n```\n\nWith `fatal` set to `False` if `_search_regex` fails to extract `description` it will emit a warning and continue extraction.\n\nYou can also pass `default=<some fallback value>`, for example:\n\n```python\ndescription = self._search_regex(\n    r'<span[^>]+id=\"title\"[^>]*>([^<]+)<',\n    webpage, 'description', default=None)\n```\n\nOn failure this code will silently continue the extraction with `description` set to `None`. That is useful for metafields that may or may not be present.\n\n\nAnother thing to remember is not to try to iterate over `None`\n\nSay you extracted a list of thumbnails into `thumbnail_data` and want to iterate over them\n\n```python\nthumbnail_data = data.get('thumbnails') or []\nthumbnails = [{\n    'url': item['url'],\n    'height': item.get('h'),\n} for item in thumbnail_data if item.get('url')]  # correct\n```\n\nand not like:\n\n```python\nthumbnail_data = data.get('thumbnails')\nthumbnails = [{\n    'url': item['url'],\n    'height': item.get('h'),\n} for item in thumbnail_data]  # incorrect\n```\n\nIn this case, `thumbnail_data` will be `None` if the field was not found and this will cause the loop `for item in thumbnail_data` to raise a fatal error. Using `or []` avoids this error and results in setting an empty list in `thumbnails` instead.\n\nAlternately, this can be further simplified by using `traverse_obj`\n\n```python\nthumbnails = [{\n    'url': item['url'],\n    'height': item.get('h'),\n} for item in traverse_obj(data, ('thumbnails', lambda _, v: v['url']))]\n```\n\nor, even better,\n\n```python\nthumbnails = traverse_obj(data, ('thumbnails', ..., {'url': 'url', 'height': 'h'}))\n```\n\n### Provide fallbacks\n\nWhen extracting metadata try to do so from multiple sources. For example if `title` is present in several places, try extracting from at least some of them. This makes it more future-proof in case some of the sources become unavailable.\n\n\n#### Example\n\nSay `meta` from the previous example has a `title` and you are about to extract it like:\n\n```python\ntitle = meta.get('title')\n```\n\nIf `title` disappears from `meta` in future due to some changes on the hoster's side the title extraction would fail.\n\nAssume that you have some another source you can extract `title` from, for example `og:title` HTML meta of a `webpage`. In this case you can provide a fallback like:\n\n```python\ntitle = meta.get('title') or self._og_search_title(webpage)\n```\n\nThis code will try to extract from `meta` first and if it fails it will try extracting `og:title` from a `webpage`, making the extractor more robust.\n\n\n### Regular expressions\n\n#### Don't capture groups you don't use\n\nCapturing group must be an indication that it's used somewhere in the code. Any group that is not used must be non capturing.\n\n##### Example\n\nDon't capture id attribute name here since you can't use it for anything anyway.\n\nCorrect:\n\n```python\nr'(?:id|ID)=(?P<id>\\d+)'\n```\n\nIncorrect:\n```python\nr'(id|ID)=(?P<id>\\d+)'\n```\n\n#### Make regular expressions relaxed and flexible\n\nWhen using regular expressions try to write them fuzzy, relaxed and flexible, skipping insignificant parts that are more likely to change, allowing both single and double quotes for quoted values and so on.\n\n##### Example\n\nSay you need to extract `title` from the following HTML code:\n\n```html\n<span style=\"position: absolute; left: 910px; width: 90px; float: right; z-index: 9999;\" class=\"title\">some fancy title</span>\n```\n\nThe code for that task should look similar to:\n\n```python\ntitle = self._search_regex(  # correct\n    r'<span[^>]+class=\"title\"[^>]*>([^<]+)', webpage, 'title')\n```\n\nwhich tolerates potential changes in the `style` attribute's value. Or even better:\n\n```python\ntitle = self._search_regex(  # correct\n    r'<span[^>]+class=([\"\\'])title\\1[^>]*>(?P<title>[^<]+)',\n    webpage, 'title', group='title')\n```\n\nwhich also handles both single quotes in addition to double quotes.\n\nThe code definitely should not look like:\n\n```python\ntitle = self._search_regex(  # incorrect\n    r'<span style=\"position: absolute; left: 910px; width: 90px; float: right; z-index: 9999;\" class=\"title\">(.*?)</span>',\n    webpage, 'title', group='title')\n```\n\nor even\n\n```python\ntitle = self._search_regex(  # incorrect\n    r'<span style=\".*?\" class=\"title\">(.*?)</span>',\n    webpage, 'title', group='title')\n```\n\nHere the presence or absence of other attributes including `style` is irrelevant for the data we need, and so the regex must not depend on it\n\n\n#### Keep the regular expressions as simple as possible, but no simpler\n\nSince many extractors deal with unstructured data provided by websites, we will often need to use very complex regular expressions. You should try to use the *simplest* regex that can accomplish what you want. In other words, each part of the regex must have a reason for existing. If you can take out a symbol and the functionality does not change, the symbol should not be there.\n\n##### Example\n\nCorrect:\n\n```python\n_VALID_URL = r'https?://(?:www\\.)?website\\.com/(?:[^/]+/){3,4}(?P<display_id>[^/]+)_(?P<id>\\d+)'\n```\n\nIncorrect:\n\n```python\n_VALID_URL = r'https?:\\/\\/(?:www\\.)?website\\.com\\/[^\\/]+/[^\\/]+/[^\\/]+(?:\\/[^\\/]+)?\\/(?P<display_id>[^\\/]+)_(?P<id>\\d+)'\n```\n\n#### Do not misuse `.` and use the correct quantifiers (`+*?`)\n\nAvoid creating regexes that over-match because of wrong use of quantifiers. Also try to avoid non-greedy matching (`?`) where possible since they could easily result in [catastrophic backtracking](https://www.regular-expressions.info/catastrophic.html)\n\nCorrect:\n\n```python\ntitle = self._search_regex(r'<span\\b[^>]+class=\"title\"[^>]*>([^<]+)', webpage, 'title')\n```\n\nIncorrect:\n\n```python\ntitle = self._search_regex(r'<span\\b.*class=\"title\".*>(.+?)<', webpage, 'title')\n```\n\n\n### Long lines policy\n\nThere is a soft limit to keep lines of code under 100 characters long. This means it should be respected if possible and if it does not make readability and code maintenance worse. Sometimes, it may be reasonable to go upto 120 characters and sometimes even 80 can be unreadable. Keep in mind that this is not a hard limit and is just one of many tools to make the code more readable.\n\nFor example, you should **never** split long string literals like URLs or some other often copied entities over multiple lines to fit this limit:\n\nConversely, don't unnecessarily split small lines further. As a rule of thumb, if removing the line split keeps the code under 80 characters, it should be a single line.\n\n##### Examples\n\nCorrect:\n\n```python\n'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqZTN594JQw&list=PLMYEtVRpaqY00V9W81Cwmzp6N6vZqfUKD4'\n```\n\nIncorrect:\n\n```python\n'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqZTN594JQw&list='\n'PLMYEtVRpaqY00V9W81Cwmzp6N6vZqfUKD4'\n```\n\nCorrect:\n\n```python\nuploader = traverse_obj(info, ('uploader', 'name'), ('author', 'fullname'))\n```\n\nIncorrect:\n\n```python\nuploader = traverse_obj(\n    info,\n    ('uploader', 'name'),\n    ('author', 'fullname'))\n```\n\nCorrect:\n\n```python\nformats = self._extract_m3u8_formats(\n    m3u8_url, video_id, 'mp4', 'm3u8_native', m3u8_id='hls',\n    note='Downloading HD m3u8 information', errnote='Unable to download HD m3u8 information')\n```\n\nIncorrect:\n\n```python\nformats = self._extract_m3u8_formats(m3u8_url,\n                                     video_id,\n                                     'mp4',\n                                     'm3u8_native',\n                                     m3u8_id='hls',\n                                     note='Downloading HD m3u8 information',\n                                     errnote='Unable to download HD m3u8 information')\n```\n\n\n### Quotes\n\nAlways use single quotes for strings (even if the string has `'`) and double quotes for docstrings. Use `'''` only for multi-line strings. An exception can be made if a string has multiple single quotes in it and escaping makes it *significantly* harder to read. For f-strings, use you can use double quotes on the inside. But avoid f-strings that have too many quotes inside.\n\n\n### Inline values\n\nExtracting variables is acceptable for reducing code duplication and improving readability of complex expressions. However, you should avoid extracting variables used only once and moving them to opposite parts of the extractor file, which makes reading the linear flow difficult.\n\n#### Examples\n\nCorrect:\n\n```python\nreturn {\n    'title': self._html_search_regex(r'<h1>([^<]+)</h1>', webpage, 'title'),\n    # ...some lines of code...\n}\n```\n\nIncorrect:\n\n```python\nTITLE_RE = r'<h1>([^<]+)</h1>'\n# ...some lines of code...\ntitle = self._html_search_regex(TITLE_RE, webpage, 'title')\n# ...some lines of code...\nreturn {\n    'title': title,\n    # ...some lines of code...\n}\n```\n\n\n### Collapse fallbacks\n\nMultiple fallback values can quickly become unwieldy. Collapse multiple fallback values into a single expression via a list of patterns.\n\n#### Example\n\nGood:\n\n```python\ndescription = self._html_search_meta(\n    ['og:description', 'description', 'twitter:description'],\n    webpage, 'description', default=None)\n```\n\nUnwieldy:\n\n```python\ndescription = (\n    self._og_search_description(webpage, default=None)\n    or self._html_search_meta('description', webpage, default=None)\n    or self._html_search_meta('twitter:description', webpage, default=None))\n```\n\nMethods supporting list of patterns are: `_search_regex`, `_html_search_regex`, `_og_search_property`, `_html_search_meta`.\n\n\n### Trailing parentheses\n\nAlways move trailing parentheses used for grouping/functions after the last argument. On the other hand, multi-line literal list/tuple/dict/set should closed be in a new line. Generators and list/dict comprehensions may use either style\n\n#### Examples\n\nCorrect:\n\n```python\nurl = traverse_obj(info, (\n    'context', 'dispatcher', 'stores', 'VideoTitlePageStore', 'data', 'video', 0, 'VideoUrlSet', 'VideoUrl'), list)\n```\nCorrect:\n\n```python\nurl = traverse_obj(\n    info,\n    ('context', 'dispatcher', 'stores', 'VideoTitlePageStore', 'data', 'video', 0, 'VideoUrlSet', 'VideoUrl'),\n    list)\n```\n\nIncorrect:\n\n```python\nurl = traverse_obj(\n    info,\n    ('context', 'dispatcher', 'stores', 'VideoTitlePageStore', 'data', 'video', 0, 'VideoUrlSet', 'VideoUrl'),\n    list\n)\n```\n\nCorrect:\n\n```python\nf = {\n    'url': url,\n    'format_id': format_id,\n}\n```\n\nIncorrect:\n\n```python\nf = {'url': url,\n     'format_id': format_id}\n```\n\nCorrect:\n\n```python\nformats = [process_formats(f) for f in format_data\n           if f.get('type') in ('hls', 'dash', 'direct') and f.get('downloadable')]\n```\n\nCorrect:\n\n```python\nformats = [\n    process_formats(f) for f in format_data\n    if f.get('type') in ('hls', 'dash', 'direct') and f.get('downloadable')\n]\n```\n\n\n### Use convenience conversion and parsing functions\n\nWrap all extracted numeric data into safe functions from [`yt_dlp/utils/`](yt_dlp/utils/): `int_or_none`, `float_or_none`. Use them for string to number conversions as well.\n\nUse `url_or_none` for safe URL processing.\n\nUse `traverse_obj` and `try_call` (superseeds `dict_get` and `try_get`) for safe metadata extraction from parsed JSON.\n\nUse `unified_strdate` for uniform `upload_date` or any `YYYYMMDD` meta field extraction, `unified_timestamp` for uniform `timestamp` extraction, `parse_filesize` for `filesize` extraction, `parse_count` for count meta fields extraction, `parse_resolution`, `parse_duration` for `duration` extraction, `parse_age_limit` for `age_limit` extraction.\n\nExplore [`yt_dlp/utils/`](yt_dlp/utils/) for more useful convenience functions.\n\n#### Examples\n\n```python\ndescription = traverse_obj(response, ('result', 'video', 'summary'), expected_type=str)\nthumbnails = traverse_obj(response, ('result', 'thumbnails', ..., 'url'), expected_type=url_or_none)\nvideo = traverse_obj(response, ('result', 'video', 0), default={}, expected_type=dict)\nduration = float_or_none(video.get('durationMs'), scale=1000)\nview_count = int_or_none(video.get('views'))\n```\n\n\n# My pull request is labeled pending-fixes\n\nThe `pending-fixes` label is added when there are changes requested to a PR.

program upgrades (or downgrades).\n    * `--update-to` can change the release channel (`stable`, `nightly`) and also upgrade or downgrade to specific tags.\n    * **Usage**: `--update-to CHANNEL`, `--update-to TAG`, `--update-to CHANNEL@TAG`\n- **YouTube throttling fixes!**\n\n#### Core changes\n- [Add option

This is the **recommended channel for regular users** of yt-dlp. The `nightly` releases are available from [yt-dlp/yt-dlp-nightly-builds](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp-nightly-builds/releases) or as development releases of the `yt-dlp` PyPI package (which can be installed with pip's `--pre` flag).\n* The `master` channel features releases that are built after each push to the master branch, and these will have the very latest fixes and additions, but may also be more prone to regressions. They are available from [yt-dlp/yt-dlp-master-builds](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp-master-builds/releases).\n\nWhen using `--update`/`-U`, a release binary will only update to its current channel.\n`--update-to CHANNEL` can be used to switch to a different channel when a newer version is available. `--update-to [CHANNEL@]TAG` can also be used to upgrade or downgrade to specific tags from a channel.\n\nYou may also use `--update-to <repository>` (`<owner>/<repository>`) to update to a channel on a completely different repository. Be careful with what repository you are updating to though, there is no verification done for binaries from different repositories.\n\nExample usage:\n\n* `yt-dlp --update-to master` switch to the `master` channel and update to its latest release\n* `yt-dlp --update-to stable@2023.07.06` upgrade/downgrade to release to `stable` channel tag `2023.07.06`\n* `yt-dlp --update-to 2023.10.07` upgrade/downgrade to tag `2023.10.07` if it exists on the current channel\n* `yt-dlp --update-to example/yt-dlp@2023.09.24` upgrade/downgrade to the release from the `example/yt-dlp` repository, tag `2023.09.24`\n\n**Important**: Any user experiencing an issue with the `stable` release should install or update to the `nightly` release before submitting a bug report:\n```\n# To update to nightly from stable executable/binary:\nyt-dlp --update-to nightly\n\n# To install nightly with pip:\npython3 -m pip install -U --pre \"yt-dlp[default]\"\n```\n\n## DEPENDENCIES\nPython versions 3.9+ (CPython) and 3.10+ (PyPy) are supported. Other versions and implementations may or may not work correctly.\n\n<!-- Python 3.5+ uses VC++14 and it is already embedded in the binary created\n<!x-- https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=26999 --x>\nOn Windows, [Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 SP1 Redistributable Package (x86)](https://download.microsoft.com/download/1/6/5/165255E7-1014-4D0A-B094-B6A430A6BFFC/vcredist_x86.exe) is also necessary to run yt-dlp. You probably already have this, but if the executable throws an error due to missing `MSVCR100.dll` you need to install it manually.\n-->\n\nWhile all the other dependencies are optional, `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` are highly recommended\n\n### Strongly recommended\n\n* [**ffmpeg** and **ffprobe**](https://www.ffmpeg.org) - Required for [merging separate video and audio files](#format-selection), as well as for various [post-processing](#post-processing-options) tasks. License [depends on the build](https://www.ffmpeg.org/legal.html)\n\n    There are bugs in ffmpeg that cause various issues when used alongside yt-dlp. Since ffmpeg is such an important dependency, we provide [custom builds](https://github.com/yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds#ffmpeg-static-auto-builds) with patches for some of these issues at [yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds](https://github.com/yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds). See [the readme](https://github.com/yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds#patches-applied) for details on the specific issues solved by these builds\n\n    **Important**: What you need is ffmpeg *binary*, **NOT** [the Python package of the same name](https://pypi.org/project/ffmpeg)\n\n### Networking\n* [**certifi**](https://github.com/certifi/python-certifi)\\* - Provides Mozilla's root certificate bundle.

All the currently available dependencies are visible at the top of the `--verbose` output\n\n\n## COMPILE\n\n### Standalone PyInstaller Builds\nTo build the standalone executable, you must have Python and `pyinstaller` (plus any of yt-dlp's [optional dependencies](#dependencies) if needed). The executable will be built for the same CPU architecture as the Python used.\n\nYou can run the following commands:\n\n```\npython3 devscripts/install_deps.py --include pyinstaller\npython3 devscripts/make_lazy_extractors.py\npython3 -m bundle.pyinstaller\n```\n\nOn some systems, you may need to use `py` or `python` instead of `python3`.\n\n`python -m bundle.pyinstaller` accepts any arguments that can be passed to `pyinstaller`, such as `--onefile/-F` or `--onedir/-D`, which is further [documented here](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/usage.html#what-to-generate).\n\n**Note**: Pyinstaller versions below 4.4 [do not support](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller#requirements-and-tested-platforms) Python installed from the Windows store without using a virtual environment.\n\n**Important**: Running `pyinstaller` directly **instead of** using `python -m bundle.pyinstaller` is **not** officially supported. This may or may not work correctly.\n\n### Platform-independent Binary (UNIX)\nYou will need the build tools `python` (3.9+), `zip`, `make` (GNU), `pandoc`\\* and `pytest`\\*.\n\nAfter installing these, simply run `make`.\n\nYou can also run `make yt-dlp` instead to compile only the binary without updating any of the additional files. (The build tools marked with **\\*** are not needed for this)\n\n### Related scripts\n\n* **`devscripts/install_deps.py`** - Install dependencies for yt-dlp.\n* **`devscripts/update-version.py`** - Update the version number based on the current date.\n* **`devscripts/set-variant.py`** - Set the build variant of the executable.\n* **`devscripts/make_changelog.py`** - Create a markdown changelog using short commit messages and update `CONTRIBUTORS` file.\n* **`devscripts/make_lazy_extractors.py`** - Create lazy extractors. Running this before building the binaries (any variant) will improve their startup performance. Set the environment variable `YTDLP_NO_LAZY_EXTRACTORS` to something nonempty to forcefully disable lazy extractor loading.\n\nNote: See their `--help` for more info.\n\n### Forking the project\nIf you fork the project on GitHub, you can run your fork's [build workflow](.github/workflows/build.yml) to automatically build the selected version(s) as artifacts. Alternatively, you can run the [release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml) or enable the [nightly workflow](.github/workflows/release-nightly.yml) to create full (pre-)releases.\n\n# USAGE AND OPTIONS\n\n<!-- MANPAGE: BEGIN EXCLUDED SECTION -->\n    yt-dlp [OPTIONS] [--] URL [URL...]\n\n`Ctrl+F` is your friend :D\n<!-- MANPAGE: END EXCLUDED SECTION -->\n\n<!-- Auto generated -->\n## General Options:\n    -h, --help                      Print this help text and exit\n    --version                       Print program version and exit\n    -U, --update                    Update this program to the latest version\n    --no-update                     Do not check for updates (default)\n    --update-to [CHANNEL]@[TAG]     Upgrade/downgrade to a specific version.\n                                    CHANNEL can be a repository as well.

The configuration is loaded from the following locations:\n\n1. **Main Configuration**:\n    * The file given to `--config-location`\n1. **Portable Configuration**: (Recommended for portable installations)\n    * If using a binary, `yt-dlp.conf` in the same directory as the binary\n    * If running from source-code, `yt-dlp.conf` in the parent directory of `yt_dlp`\n1. **Home Configuration**:\n    * `yt-dlp.conf` in the home path given to `-P`\n    * If `-P` is not given, the current directory is searched\n1. **User Configuration**:\n    * `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/yt-dlp.conf`\n    * `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/yt-dlp/config` (recommended on Linux/macOS)\n    * `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/yt-dlp/config.txt`\n    * `${APPDATA}/yt-dlp.conf`\n    * `${APPDATA}/yt-dlp/config` (recommended on Windows)\n    * `${APPDATA}/yt-dlp/config.txt`\n    * `~/yt-dlp.conf`\n    * `~/yt-dlp.conf.txt`\n    * `~/.yt-dlp/config`\n    * `~/.yt-dlp/config.txt`\n\n    See also: [Notes about environment variables](#notes-about-environment-variables)\n1. **System Configuration**:\n    * `/etc/yt-dlp.conf`\n    * `/etc/yt-dlp/config`\n    * `/etc/yt-dlp/config.txt`\n\nE.g. with the following configuration file, yt-dlp will always extract the audio, not copy the mtime, use a proxy and save all videos under `YouTube` directory in your home directory:\n```\n# Lines starting with # are comments\n\n# Always extract audio\n-x\n\n# Do not copy the mtime\n--no-mtime\n\n# Use this proxy\n--proxy 127.0.0.1:3128\n\n# Save all videos under YouTube directory in your home directory\n-o ~/YouTube/%(title)s.%(ext)s\n```\n\n**Note**: Options in a configuration file are just the same options aka switches used in regular command line calls; thus there **must be no whitespace** after `-` or `--`, e.g. `-o` or `--proxy` but not `- o` or `-- proxy`. They must also be quoted when necessary, as if it were a UNIX shell.\n\nYou can use `--ignore-config` if you want to disable all configuration files for a particular yt-dlp run. If `--ignore-config` is found inside any configuration file, no further configuration will be loaded. For example, having the option in the portable configuration file prevents loading of home, user, and system configurations. Additionally, (for backward compatibility) if `--ignore-config` is found inside the system configuration file, the user configuration is not loaded.\n\n### Configuration file encoding\n\nThe configuration files are decoded according to the UTF BOM if present, and in the encoding from system locale otherwise.\n\nIf you want your file to be decoded differently, add `# coding: ENCODING` to the beginning of the file (e.g. `# coding: shift-jis`). There must be no characters before that, even spaces or BOM.\n\n### Authentication with netrc\n\nYou may also want to configure automatic credentials storage for extractors that support authentication (by providing login and password with `--username` and `--password`) in order not to pass credentials as command line arguments on every yt-dlp execution and prevent tracking plain text passwords in the shell command history. You can achieve this using a [`.netrc` file](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/.netrc/info) on a per-extractor basis. For that, you will need to create a `.netrc` file in `--netrc-location` and restrict permissions to read/write by only you:\n```\ntouch ${HOME}/.netrc\nchmod a-rwx,u+rw ${HOME}/.netrc\n```\nAfter that, you can add credentials for an extractor in the following format, where *extractor* is the name of the extractor in lowercase:\n```\nmachine <extractor> login <username> password <password>\n```\nE.g.\n```\nmachine youtube login myaccount@gmail.com password my_youtube_password\nmachine twitch login my_twitch_account_name password my_twitch_password\n```\nTo activate authentication with the `.netrc` file you should pass `--netrc` to yt-dlp or place it in the [configuration file](#configuration).\n\nThe default location of the .netrc file is `~` (see below).\n\nAs an alternative to using the `.netrc` file, which has the disadvantage of keeping your passwords in a plain text file, you can configure a custom shell command to provide the credentials for an extractor. This is done by providing the `--netrc-cmd` parameter, it shall output the credentials in the netrc format and return `0` on success, other values will be treated as an error. `{}` in the command will be replaced by the name of the extractor to make it possible to select the credentials for the right extractor.\n\nE.g. To use an encrypted `.netrc` file stored as `.authinfo.gpg`\n```\nyt-dlp --netrc-cmd 'gpg --decrypt ~/.authinfo.gpg' 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaW_jenozKc'\n```\n\n\n### Notes about environment variables\n* Environment variables are normally specified as `${VARIABLE}`/`$VARIABLE` on UNIX and `%VARIABLE%` on Windows; but is always shown as `${VARIABLE}` in this documentation\n* yt-dlp also allows using UNIX-style variables on Windows for path-like options; e.g. `--output`, `--config-location`\n* If unset, `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}` defaults to `~/.config` and `${XDG_CACHE_HOME}` to `~/.cache`\n* On Windows, `~` points to `${HOME}` if present; or, `${USERPROFILE}` or `${HOMEDRIVE}${HOMEPATH}` otherwise\n* On Windows, `${USERPROFILE}` generally points to `C:\\Users\\<user name>` and `${APPDATA}` to `${USERPROFILE}\\AppData\\Roaming`\n\n# OUTPUT TEMPLATE\n\nThe `-o` option is used to indicate a template for the output file names while `-P` option is used to specify the path each type of file should be saved to.\n\n<!-- MANPAGE: BEGIN EXCLUDED SECTION -->\n**tl;dr:** [navigate me to examples](#output-template-examples).\n<!-- MANPAGE: END EXCLUDED SECTION -->\n\nThe simplest usage of `-o` is not to set any template arguments when downloading a single file, like in `yt-dlp -o funny_video.flv \"https://some/video\"` (hard-coding file extension like this is _not_ recommended and could break some post-processing).\n\nIt may however also contain special sequences that will be replaced when downloading each video. The special sequences may be formatted according to [Python string formatting operations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#printf-style-string-formatting), e.g. `%(NAME)s` or `%(NAME)05d`. To clarify, that is a percent symbol followed by a name in parentheses, followed by formatting operations.\n\nThe field names themselves (the part inside the parenthesis) can also have some special formatting:\n\n1. **Object traversal**: The dictionaries and lists available in metadata can be traversed by using a dot `.` separator; e.g. `%(tags.0)s`, `%(subtitles.en.-1.ext)s`. You can do Python slicing with colon `:`; E.g. `%(id.3:7)s`, `%(id.6:2:-1)s`, `%(formats.:.format_id)s`. Curly braces `{}` can be used to build dictionaries with only specific keys; e.g. `%(formats.:.{format_id,height})#j`. An empty field name `%()s` refers to the entire infodict; e.g. `%(.{id,title})s`. Note that all the fields that become available using this method are not listed below. Use `-j` to see such fields\n\n1. **Arithmetic**: Simple arithmetic can be done on numeric fields using `+`, `-` and `*`. E.g. `%(playlist_index+10)03d`, `%(n_entries+1-playlist_index)d`\n\n1. **Date/time Formatting**: Date/time fields can be formatted according to [strftime formatting](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-format-codes) by specifying it separated from the field name using a `>`. E.g. `%(duration>%H-%M-%S)s`, `%(upload_date>%Y-%m-%d)s`, `%(epoch-3600>%H-%M-%S)s`\n\n1. **Alternatives**: Alternate fields can be specified separated with a `,`. E.g. `%(release_date>%Y,upload_date>%Y|Unknown)s`\n\n1. **Replacement**: A replacement value can be specified using a `&` separator according to the [`str.format` mini-language](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-specification-mini-language). If the field is *not* empty, this replacement value will be used instead of the actual field content. This is done after alternate fields are considered; thus the replacement is used if *any* of the alternative fields is *not* empty. E.g. `%(chapters&has chapters|no chapters)s`, `%(title&TITLE={:>20}|NO TITLE)s`\n\n1. **Default**: A literal default value can be specified for when the field is empty using a `|` separator. This overrides `--output-na-placeholder`. E.g. `%(uploader|Unknown)s`\n\n1. **More Conversions**: In addition to the normal format types `diouxXeEfFgGcrs`, yt-dlp additionally supports converting to `B` = **B**ytes, `j` = **j**son (flag `#` for pretty-printing, `+` for Unicode), `h` = HTML escaping, `l` = a comma separated **l**ist (flag `#` for `\\n` newline-separated), `q` = a string **q**uoted for the terminal (flag `#` to split a list into different arguments), `D` = add **D**ecimal suffixes (e.g. 10M) (flag `#` to use 1024 as factor), and `S` = **S**anitize as filename (flag `#` for restricted)\n\n1. **Unicode normalization**: The format type `U` can be used for NFC [Unicode normalization](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unicodedata.html#unicodedata.normalize). The alternate form flag (`#`) changes the normalization to NFD and the conversion flag `+` can be used for NFKC/NFKD compatibility equivalence normalization. E.g. `%(title)+.100U` is NFKC\n\nTo summarize, the general syntax for a field is:\n```\n%(name[.keys][addition][>strf][,alternate][&replacement][|default])[flags][width][.precision][length]type\n```\n\nAdditionally, you can set different output templates for the various metadata files separately from the general output template by specifying the type of file followed by the template separated by a colon `:`. The different file types supported are `subtitle`, `thumbnail`, `description`, `annotation` (deprecated), `infojson`, `link`, `pl_thumbnail`, `pl_description`, `pl_infojson`, `chapter`, `pl_video`. E.g. `-o \"%(title)s.%(ext)s\" -o \"thumbnail:%(title)s\\%(title)s.%(ext)s\"` will put the thumbnails in a folder with the same name as the video. If any of the templates is empty, that type of file will not be written. E.g. `--write-thumbnail -o \"thumbnail:\"` will write thumbnails only for playlists and not for video.\n\n<a id=\"outtmpl-postprocess-note\"></a>\n\n**Note**: Due to post-processing (i.e. merging etc.), the actual output filename might differ.

E.g. for `-o %(title)s-%(id)s.%(ext)s` and an mp4 video with title `yt-dlp test video` and id `BaW_jenozKc`, this will result in a `yt-dlp test video-BaW_jenozKc.mp4` file created in the current directory.\n\n**Note**: Some of the sequences are not guaranteed to be present, since they depend on the metadata obtained by a particular extractor. Such sequences will be replaced with placeholder value provided with `--output-na-placeholder` (`NA` by default).\n\n**Tip**: Look at the `-j` output to identify which fields are available for the particular URL\n\nFor numeric sequences, you can use [numeric related formatting](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#printf-style-string-formatting); e.g. `%(view_count)05d` will result in a string with view count padded with zeros up to 5 characters, like in `00042`.\n\nOutput templates can also contain arbitrary hierarchical path, e.g. `-o \"%(playlist)s/%(playlist_index)s - %(title)s.%(ext)s\"` which will result in downloading each video in a directory corresponding to this path template. Any missing directory will be automatically created for you.\n\nTo use percent literals in an output template use `%%`. To output to stdout use `-o -`.\n\nThe current default template is `%(title)s [%(id)s].%(ext)s`.\n\nIn some cases, you don't want special characters such as 中, spaces, or &, such as when transferring the downloaded filename to a Windows system or the filename through an 8bit-unsafe channel. In these cases, add the `--restrict-filenames` flag to get a shorter title.\n\n#### Output template examples\n\n```bash\n$ yt-dlp --print filename -o \"test video.%(ext)s\" BaW_jenozKc\ntest video.webm    # Literal name with correct extension\n\n$ yt-dlp --print filename -o \"%(title)s.%(ext)s\" BaW_jenozKc\nyoutube-dl test video ''_ä↭𝕐.webm    # All kinds of weird characters\n\n$ yt-dlp --print filename -o \"%(title)s.%(ext)s\" BaW_jenozKc --restrict-filenames\nyoutube-dl_test_video_.webm    # Restricted file name\n\n# Download YouTube playlist videos in separate directory indexed by video order in a playlist\n$ yt-dlp -o \"%(playlist)s/%(playlist_index)s - %(title)s.%(ext)s\" \"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwiyx1dc3P2JR9N8gQaQN_BCvlSlap7re\"\n\n# Download YouTube playlist videos in separate directories according to their uploaded year\n$ yt-dlp -o \"%(upload_date>%Y)s/%(title)s.%(ext)s\" \"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwiyx1dc3P2JR9N8gQaQN_BCvlSlap7re\"\n\n# Prefix playlist index with \" - \" separator, but only if it is available\n$ yt-dlp -o \"%(playlist_index&{} - |)s%(title)s.%(ext)s\" BaW_jenozKc \"https://www.youtube.com/user/TheLinuxFoundation/playlists\"\n\n# Download all playlists of YouTube channel/user keeping each playlist in separate directory:\n$ yt-dlp -o \"%(uploader)s/%(playlist)s/%(playlist_index)s - %(title)s.%(ext)s\" \"https://www.youtube.com/user/TheLinuxFoundation/playlists\"\n\n# Download Udemy course keeping each chapter in separate directory under MyVideos directory in your home\n$ yt-dlp -u user -p password -P \"~/MyVideos\" -o \"%(playlist)s/%(chapter_number)s - %(chapter)s/%(title)s.%(ext)s\" \"https://www.udemy.com/java-tutorial\"\n\n# Download entire series season keeping each series and each season in separate directory under C:/MyVideos\n$ yt-dlp -P \"C:/MyVideos\" -o \"%(series)s/%(season_number)s - %(season)s/%(episode_number)s - %(episode)s.%(ext)s\" \"https://videomore.ru/kino_v_detalayah/5_sezon/367617\"\n\n# Download video as \"C:\\MyVideos\\uploader\\title.ext\", subtitles as \"C:\\MyVideos\\subs\\uploader\\title.ext\"\n# and put all temporary files in \"C:\\MyVideos\\tmp\"\n$ yt-dlp -P \"C:/MyVideos\" -P \"temp:tmp\" -P \"subtitle:subs\" -o \"%(uploader)s/%(title)s.%(ext)s\" BaW_jenozKc --write-subs\n\n# Download video as \"C:\\MyVideos\\uploader\\title.ext\" and subtitles as \"C:\\MyVideos\\uploader\\subs\\title.ext\"\n$ yt-dlp -P \"C:/MyVideos\" -o \"%(uploader)s/%(title)s.%(ext)s\" -o \"subtitle:%(uploader)s/subs/%(title)s.%(ext)s\" BaW_jenozKc --write-subs\n\n# Stream the video being downloaded to stdout\n$ yt-dlp -o - BaW_jenozKc\n```\n\n# FORMAT SELECTION\n\nBy default, yt-dlp tries to download the best available quality if you **don't** pass any options.\nThis is generally equivalent to using `-f bestvideo*+bestaudio/best`. However, if multiple audiostreams is enabled (`--audio-multistreams`), the default format changes to `-f bestvideo+bestaudio/best`. Similarly, if ffmpeg is unavailable, or if you use yt-dlp to stream to `stdout` (`-o -`), the default becomes `-f best/bestvideo+bestaudio`.\n\n**Deprecation warning**: Latest versions of yt-dlp can stream multiple formats to the stdout simultaneously using ffmpeg. So, in future versions, the default for this will be set to `-f bv*+ba/b` similar to normal downloads. If you want to preserve the `-f b/bv+ba` setting, it is recommended to explicitly specify it in the configuration options.\n\nThe general syntax for format selection is `-f FORMAT` (or `--format FORMAT`) where `FORMAT` is a *selector expression*, i.e. an expression that describes format or formats you would like to download.\n\n<!-- MANPAGE: BEGIN EXCLUDED SECTION -->\n**tl;dr:** [navigate me to examples](#format-selection-examples).\n<!-- MANPAGE: END EXCLUDED SECTION -->\n\nThe simplest case is requesting a specific format; e.g. with `-f 22` you can download the format with format code equal to 22. You can get the list of available format codes for particular video using `--list-formats` or `-F`. Note that these format codes are extractor specific.\n\nYou can also use a file extension (currently `3gp`, `aac`, `flv`, `m4a`, `mp3`, `mp4`, `ogg`, `wav`, `webm` are supported) to download the best quality format of a particular file extension served as a single file, e.g. `-f webm` will download the best quality format with the `webm` extension served as a single file.\n\nYou can use `-f -` to interactively provide the format selector *for each video*\n\nYou can also use special names to select particular edge case formats:\n\n - `all`: Select **all formats** separately\n - `mergeall`: Select and **merge all formats** (Must be used with `--audio-multistreams`, `--video-multistreams` or both)\n - `b*`, `best*`: Select the best quality format that **contains either** a video or an audio or both (i.e.; `vcodec!=none or acodec!=none`)\n - `b`, `best`: Select the best quality format that **contains both** video and audio. Equivalent to `best*[vcodec!=none][acodec!=none]`\n - `bv`, `bestvideo`: Select the best quality **video-only** format. Equivalent to `best*[acodec=none]`\n - `bv*`, `bestvideo*`: Select the best quality format that **contains video**. It may also contain audio. Equivalent to `best*[vcodec!=none]`\n - `ba`, `bestaudio`: Select the best quality **audio-only** format. Equivalent to `best*[vcodec=none]`\n - `ba*`, `bestaudio*`: Select the best quality format that **contains audio**. It may also contain video. Equivalent to `best*[acodec!=none]` ([Do not use!](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/979#issuecomment-919629354))\n - `w*`, `worst*`: Select the worst quality format that contains either a video or an audio\n - `w`, `worst`: Select the worst quality format that contains both video and audio. Equivalent to `worst*[vcodec!=none][acodec!=none]`\n - `wv`, `worstvideo`: Select the worst quality video-only format. Equivalent to `worst*[acodec=none]`\n - `wv*`, `worstvideo*`: Select the worst quality format that contains video. It may also contain audio. Equivalent to `worst*[vcodec!=none]`\n - `wa`, `worstaudio`: Select the worst quality audio-only format. Equivalent to `worst*[vcodec=none]`\n - `wa*`, `worstaudio*`: Select the worst quality format that contains audio. It may also contain video. Equivalent to `worst*[acodec!=none]`\n\nFor example, to download the worst quality video-only format you can use `-f worstvideo`. It is, however, recommended not to use `worst` and related options. When your format selector is `worst`, the format which is worst in all respects is selected. Most of the time, what you actually want is the video with the smallest filesize instead. So it is generally better to use `-S +size` or more rigorously, `-S +size,+br,+res,+fps` instead of `-f worst`. See [Sorting Formats](#sorting-formats) for more details.\n\nYou can select the n'th best format of a type by using `best<type>.<n>`. For example, `best.2` will select the 2nd best combined format. Similarly, `bv*.3` will select the 3rd best format that contains a video stream.\n\nIf you want to download multiple videos, and they don't have the same formats available, you can specify the order of preference using slashes. Note that formats on the left hand side are preferred; e.g. `-f 22/17/18` will download format 22 if it's available, otherwise it will download format 17 if it's available, otherwise it will download format 18 if it's available, otherwise it will complain that no suitable formats are available for download.\n\nIf you want to download several formats of the same video use a comma as a separator, e.g. `-f 22,17,18` will download all these three formats, of course if they are available. Or a more sophisticated example combined with the precedence feature: `-f 136/137/mp4/bestvideo,140/m4a/bestaudio`.\n\nYou can merge the video and audio of multiple formats into a single file using `-f <format1>+<format2>+...` (requires ffmpeg installed); e.g. `-f bestvideo+bestaudio` will download the best video-only format, the best audio-only format and mux them together with ffmpeg.\n\n**Deprecation warning**: Since the *below* described behavior is complex and counter-intuitive, this will be removed and multistreams will be enabled by default in the future. A new operator will be instead added to limit formats to single audio/video\n\nUnless `--video-multistreams` is used, all formats with a video stream except the first one are ignored. Similarly, unless `--audio-multistreams` is used, all formats with an audio stream except the first one are ignored. E.g. `-f bestvideo+best+bestaudio --video-multistreams --audio-multistreams` will download and merge all 3 given formats. The resulting file will have 2 video streams and 2 audio streams. But `-f bestvideo+best+bestaudio --no-video-multistreams` will download and merge only `bestvideo` and `bestaudio`. `best` is ignored since another format containing a video stream (`bestvideo`) has already been selected. The order of the formats is therefore important. `-f best+bestaudio --no-audio-multistreams` will download only `best` while `-f bestaudio+best --no-audio-multistreams` will ignore `best` and download only `bestaudio`.\n\n## Filtering Formats\n\nYou can also filter the video formats by putting a condition in brackets, as in `-f \"best[height=720]\"` (or `-f \"[filesize>10M]\"` since filters without a selector are interpreted as `best`).\n\nThe following numeric meta fields can be used with comparisons `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `=` (equals), `!=` (not equals):\n\n - `filesize`: The number of bytes, if known in advance\n - `filesize_approx`: An estimate for the number of bytes\n - `width`: Width of the video, if known\n - `height`: Height of the video, if known\n - `aspect_ratio`: Aspect ratio of the video, if known\n - `tbr`: Average bitrate of audio and video in [kbps](## \"1000 bits/sec\")\n - `abr`: Average audio bitrate in [kbps](## \"1000 bits/sec\")\n - `vbr`: Average video bitrate in [kbps](## \"1000 bits/sec\")\n - `asr`: Audio sampling rate in Hertz\n - `fps`: Frame rate\n - `audio_channels`: The number of audio channels\n - `stretched_ratio`: `width:height` of the video's pixels, if not square\n\nAlso filtering work for comparisons `=` (equals), `^=` (starts with), `$=` (ends with), `*=` (contains), `~=` (matches regex) and following string meta fields:\n\n - `url`: Video URL\n - `ext`: File extension\n - `acodec`: Name of the audio codec in use\n - `vcodec`: Name of the video codec in use\n - `container`: Name of the container format\n - `protocol`: The protocol that will be used for the actual download, lower-case (`http`, `https`, `rtsp`, `rtmp`, `rtmpe`, `mms`, `f4m`, `ism`, `http_dash_segments`, `m3u8`, or `m3u8_native`)\n - `language`: Language code\n - `dynamic_range`: The dynamic range of the video\n - `format_id`: A short description of the format\n - `format`: A human-readable description of the format\n - `format_note`: Additional info about the format\n - `resolution`: Textual description of width and height\n\nAny string comparison may be prefixed with negation `!` in order to produce an opposite comparison, e.g. `!*=` (does not contain). The comparand of a string comparison needs to be quoted with either double or single quotes if it contains spaces or special characters other than `._-`.\n\n**Note**: None of the aforementioned meta fields are guaranteed to be present since this solely depends on the metadata obtained by the particular extractor, i.e. the metadata offered by the website. Any other field made available by the extractor can also be used for filtering.\n\nFormats for which the value is not known are excluded unless you put a question mark (`?`) after the operator. You can combine format filters, so `-f \"bv[height<=?720][tbr>500]\"` selects up to 720p videos (or videos where the height is not known) with a bitrate of at least 500 kbps. You can also use the filters with `all` to download all formats that satisfy the filter, e.g. `-f \"all[vcodec=none]\"` selects all audio-only formats.\n\nFormat selectors can also be grouped using parentheses; e.g. `-f \"(mp4,webm)[height<480]\"` will download the best pre-merged mp4 and webm formats with a height lower than 480.\n\n## Sorting Formats\n\nYou can change the criteria for being considered the `best` by using `-S` (`--format-sort`). The general format for this is `--format-sort field1,field2...`.\n\nThe available fields are:\n\n - `hasvid`: Gives priority to formats that have a video stream\n - `hasaud`: Gives priority to formats that have an audio stream\n - `ie_pref`: The format preference\n - `lang`: The language preference\n - `quality`: The quality of the format\n - `source`: The preference of the source\n - `proto`: Protocol used for download (`https`/`ftps` > `http`/`ftp` > `m3u8_native`/`m3u8` > `http_dash_segments`> `websocket_frag` > `mms`/`rtsp` > `f4f`/`f4m`)\n - `vcodec`: Video Codec (`av01` > `vp9.2` > `vp9` > `h265` > `h264` > `vp8` > `h263` > `theora` > other)\n - `acodec`: Audio Codec (`flac`/`alac` > `wav`/`aiff` > `opus` > `vorbis` > `aac` > `mp4a` > `mp3` > `ac4` > `eac3` > `ac3` > `dts` > other)\n - `codec`: Equivalent to `vcodec,acodec`\n - `vext`: Video Extension (`mp4` > `mov` > `webm` > `flv` > other). If `--prefer-free-formats` is used, `webm` is preferred.\n - `aext`: Audio Extension (`m4a` > `aac` > `mp3` > `ogg` > `opus` > `webm` > other). If `--prefer-free-formats` is used, the order changes to `ogg` > `opus` > `webm` > `mp3` > `m4a` > `aac`\n - `ext`: Equivalent to `vext,aext`\n - `filesize`: Exact filesize, if known in advance\n - `fs_approx`: Approximate filesize\n - `size`: Exact filesize if available, otherwise approximate filesize\n - `height`: Height of video\n - `width`: Width of video\n - `res`: Video resolution, calculated as the smallest dimension.\n - `fps`: Framerate of video\n - `hdr`: The dynamic range of the video (`DV` > `HDR12` > `HDR10+` > `HDR10` > `HLG` > `SDR`)\n - `channels`: The number of audio channels\n - `tbr`: Total average bitrate in [kbps](## \"1000 bits/sec\")\n - `vbr`: Average video bitrate in [kbps](## \"1000 bits/sec\")\n - `abr`: Average audio bitrate in [kbps](## \"1000 bits/sec\")\n - `br`: Average bitrate in [kbps](## \"1000 bits/sec\"), `tbr`/`vbr`/`abr`\n - `asr`: Audio sample rate in Hz\n\n**Deprecation warning**: Many of these fields have (currently undocumented) aliases, that may be removed in a future version. It is recommended to use only the documented field names.\n\nAll fields, unless specified otherwise, are sorted in descending order. To reverse this, prefix the field with a `+`. E.g. `+res` prefers format with the smallest resolution. Additionally, you can suffix a preferred value for the fields, separated by a `:`. E.g. `res:720` prefers larger videos, but no larger than 720p and the smallest video if there are no videos less than 720p. For `codec` and `ext`, you can provide two preferred values, the first for video and the second for audio. E.g. `+codec:avc:m4a` (equivalent to `+vcodec:avc,+acodec:m4a`) sets the video codec preference to `h264` > `h265` > `vp9` > `vp9.2` > `av01` > `vp8` > `h263` > `theora` and audio codec preference to `mp4a` > `aac` > `vorbis` > `opus` > `mp3` > `ac3` > `dts`. You can also make the sorting prefer the nearest values to the provided by using `~` as the delimiter. E.g. `filesize~1G` prefers the format with filesize closest to 1 GiB.\n\nThe fields `hasvid` and `ie_pref` are always given highest priority in sorting, irrespective of the user-defined order. This behavior can be changed by using `--format-sort-force`. Apart from these, the default order used is: `lang,quality,res,fps,hdr:12,vcodec,channels,acodec,size,br,asr,proto,ext,hasaud,source,id`. The extractors may override this default order, but they cannot override the user-provided order.\n\nNote that the default for hdr is `hdr:12`; i.e. Dolby Vision is not preferred. This choice was made since DV formats are not yet fully compatible with most devices. This may be changed in the future.\n\nIf your format selector is `worst`, the last item is selected after sorting. This means it will select the format that is worst in all respects. Most of the time, what you actually want is the video with the smallest filesize instead. So it is generally better to use `-f best -S +size,+br,+res,+fps`.\n\n**Tip**: You can use the `-v -F` to see how the formats have been sorted (worst to best).\n\n## Format Selection examples\n\n```bash\n# Download and merge the best video-only format and the best audio-only format,\n# or download the best combined format if video-only format is not available\n$ yt-dlp -f \"bv+ba/b\"\n\n# Download best format that contains video,\n# and if it doesn't already have an audio stream, merge it with best audio-only format\n$ yt-dlp -f \"bv*+ba/b\"\n\n# Same as above\n$ yt-dlp\n\n# Download the best video-only format and the best audio-only format without merging them\n# For this case, an output template should be used since\n# by default, bestvideo and bestaudio will have the same file name.\n$ yt-dlp -f \"bv,ba\" -o \"%(title)s.f%(format_id)s.%(ext)s\"\n\n# Download and merge the best format that has a video stream,\n# and all audio-only formats into one file\n$ yt-dlp -f \"bv*+mergeall[vcodec=none]\" --audio-multistreams\n\n# Download and merge the best format that has a video stream,\n# and the best 2 audio-only formats into one file\n$ yt-dlp -f \"bv*+ba+ba.2\" --audio-multistreams\n\n\n# The following examples show the old method (without -S) of format selection\n# and how to use -S to achieve a similar but (generally) better result\n\n# Download the worst video available (old method)\n$ yt-dlp -f \"wv*+wa/w\"\n\n# Download the best video available but with the smallest resolution\n$ yt-dlp -S \"+res\"\n\n# Download the smallest video available\n$ yt-dlp -S \"+size,+br\"\n\n\n\n# Download the best mp4 video available, or the best video if no mp4 available\n$ yt-dlp -f \"bv*[ext=mp4]+ba[ext=m4a]/b[ext=mp4] / bv*+ba/b\"\n\n# Download the best video with the best extension\n# (For video, mp4 > mov > webm > flv.

[Backreferences](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html?highlight=backreferences#re.sub) can be used in the replace string for advanced use.\n\nThe general syntax of `--parse-metadata FROM:TO` is to give the name of a field or an [output template](#output-template) to extract data from, and the format to interpret it as, separated by a colon `:`. Either a [Python regular expression](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax) with named capture groups, a single field name, or a similar syntax to the [output template](#output-template) (only `%(field)s` formatting is supported) can be used for `TO`. The option can be used multiple times to parse and modify various fields.\n\nNote that these options preserve their relative order, allowing replacements to be made in parsed fields and vice versa. Also, any field thus created can be used in the [output template](#output-template) and will also affect the media file's metadata added when using `--embed-metadata`.\n\nThis option also has a few special uses:\n\n* You can download an additional URL based on the metadata of the currently downloaded video. To do this, set the field `additional_urls` to the URL that you want to download. E.g. `--parse-metadata \"description:(?P<additional_urls>https?://www\\.vimeo\\.com/\\d+)\"` will download the first vimeo video found in the description\n\n* You can use this to change the metadata that is embedded in the media file. To do this, set the value of the corresponding field with a `meta_` prefix. For example, any value you set to `meta_description` field will be added to the `description` field in the file - you can use this to set a different \"description\" and \"synopsis\". To modify the metadata of individual streams, use the `meta<n>_` prefix (e.g. `meta1_language`). Any value set to the `meta_` field will overwrite all default values.\n\n**Note**: Metadata modification happens before format selection, post-extraction and other post-processing operations. Some fields may be added or changed during these steps, overriding your changes.\n\nFor reference, these are the fields yt-dlp adds by default to the file metadata:\n\nMetadata fields            | From\n:--------------------------|:------------------------------------------------\n`title`                    | `track` or `title`\n`date`                     | `upload_date`\n`description`,  `synopsis` | `description`\n`purl`, `comment`          | `webpage_url`\n`track`                    | `track_number`\n`artist`                   | `artist`, `artists`, `creator`, `creators`, `uploader` or `uploader_id`\n`composer`                 | `composer` or `composers`\n`genre`                    | `genre` or `genres`\n`album`                    | `album`\n`album_artist`             | `album_artist` or `album_artists`\n`disc`                     | `disc_number`\n`show`                     | `series`\n`season_number`            | `season_number`\n`episode_id`               | `episode` or `episode_id`\n`episode_sort`             | `episode_number`\n`language` of each stream  | the format's `language`\n\n**Note**: The file format may not support some of these fields\n\n\n## Modifying metadata examples\n\n```bash\n# Interpret the title as \"Artist - Title\"\n$ yt-dlp --parse-metadata \"title:%(artist)s - %(title)s\"\n\n# Regex example\n$ yt-dlp --parse-metadata \"description:Artist - (?P<artist>.+)\"\n\n# Set title as \"Series name S01E05\"\n$ yt-dlp --parse-metadata \"%(series)s S%(season_number)02dE%(episode_number)02d:%(title)s\"\n\n# Prioritize uploader as the \"artist\" field in video metadata\n$ yt-dlp --parse-metadata \"%(uploader|)s:%(meta_artist)s\" --embed-metadata\n\n# Set \"comment\" field in video metadata using description instead of webpage_url,\n# handling multiple lines correctly\n$ yt-dlp --parse-metadata \"description:(?s)(?P<meta_comment>.+)\" --embed-metadata\n\n# Do not set any \"synopsis\" in the video metadata\n$ yt-dlp --parse-metadata \":(?P<meta_synopsis>)\"\n\n# Remove \"formats\" field from the infojson by setting it to an empty string\n$ yt-dlp --parse-metadata \"video::(?P<formats>)\" --write-info-json\n\n# Replace all spaces and \"_\" in title and uploader with a `-`\n$ yt-dlp --replace-in-metadata \"title,uploader\" \"[ _]\" \"-\"\n\n```\n\n# EXTRACTOR ARGUMENTS\n\nSome extractors accept additional arguments which can be passed using `--extractor-args KEY:ARGS`. `ARGS` is a `;` (semicolon) separated string of `ARG=VAL1,VAL2`. E.g. `--extractor-args \"youtube:player-client=tv,mweb;formats=incomplete\" --extractor-args \"funimation:version=uncut\"`\n\nNote: In CLI, `ARG` can use `-` instead of `_`; e.g. `youtube:player-client\"` becomes `youtube:player_client\"`\n\nThe following extractors use this feature:\n\n#### youtube\n* `lang`: Prefer translated metadata (`title`, `description` etc) of this language code (case-sensitive). By default, the video primary language metadata is preferred, with a fallback to `en` translated. See [youtube.py](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/c26f9b991a0681fd3ea548d535919cec1fbbd430/yt_dlp/extractor/youtube.py#L381-L390) for list of supported content language codes\n* `skip`: One or more of `hls`, `dash` or `translated_subs` to skip extraction of the m3u8 manifests, dash manifests and [auto-translated subtitles](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/4090#issuecomment-1158102032) respectively\n* `player_client`: Clients to extract video data from. The main clients are `web`, `ios` and `android`, with variants `_music` and `_creator` (e.g. `ios_creator`); and `mweb`, `android_vr`, `web_safari`, `web_embedded`, `tv` and `tv_embedded` with no variants. By default, `ios,mweb` is used, or `web_creator,mweb` is used when authenticating with cookies. The `_music` variants are added for `music.youtube.com` URLs. Some clients, such as `web` and `android`, require a `po_token` for their formats to be downloadable. Some clients, such as the `_creator` variants, will only work with authentication. Not all clients support authentication via cookies. You can use `all` to use all the clients, and `default` for the default clients. You can prefix a client with `-` to exclude it, e.g. `youtube:player_client=all,-web`\n* `player_skip`: Skip some network requests that are generally needed for robust extraction. One or more of `configs` (skip client configs), `webpage` (skip initial webpage), `js` (skip js player). While these options can help reduce the number of requests needed or avoid some rate-limiting, they could cause some issues. See [#860](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/pull/860) for more details\n* `player_params`: YouTube player parameters to use for player requests. Will overwrite any default ones set by yt-dlp.\n* `comment_sort`: `top` or `new` (default) - choose comment sorting mode (on YouTube's side)\n* `max_comments`: Limit the amount of comments to gather. Comma-separated list of integers representing `max-comments,max-parents,max-replies,max-replies-per-thread`. Default is `all,all,all,all`\n    * E.g. `all,all,1000,10` will get a maximum of 1000 replies total, with up to 10 replies per thread. `1000,all,100` will get a maximum of 1000 comments, with a maximum of 100 replies total\n* `formats`: Change the types of formats to return. `dashy` (convert HTTP to DASH), `duplicate` (identical content but different URLs or protocol; includes `dashy`), `incomplete` (cannot be downloaded completely - live dash and post-live m3u8), `missing_pot` (include formats that require a PO Token but are missing one)\n* `innertube_host`: Innertube API host to use for all API requests; e.g. `studio.youtube.com`, `youtubei.googleapis.com`. Note that cookies exported from one subdomain will not work on others\n* `innertube_key`: Innertube API key to use for all API requests. By default, no API key is used\n* `raise_incomplete_data`: `Incomplete Data Received` raises an error instead of reporting a warning\n* `data_sync_id`: Overrides the account Data Sync ID used in Innertube API requests. This may be needed if you are using an account with `youtube:player_skip=webpage,configs` or `youtubetab:skip=webpage`\n* `visitor_data`: Overrides the Visitor Data used in Innertube API requests. This should be used with `player_skip=webpage,configs` and without cookies. Note: this may have adverse effects if used improperly. If a session from a browser is wanted, you should pass cookies instead (which contain the Visitor ID)\n* `po_token`:  Proof of Origin (PO) Token(s) to use for requesting video playback. Comma seperated list of PO Tokens in the format `CLIENT+PO_TOKEN`, e.g. `youtube:po_token=web+XXX,android+YYY`\n\n#### youtubetab (YouTube playlists, channels, feeds, etc.)\n* `skip`: One or more of `webpage` (skip initial webpage download), `authcheck` (allow the download of playlists requiring authentication when no initial webpage is downloaded. This may cause unwanted behavior, see [#1122](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/pull/1122) for more details)\n* `approximate_date`: Extract approximate `upload_date` and `timestamp` in flat-playlist. This may cause date-based filters to be slightly off\n\n#### generic\n* `fragment_query`: Passthrough any query in mpd/m3u8 manifest URLs to their fragments if no value is provided, or else apply the query string given as `fragment_query=VALUE`. Note that if the stream has an HLS AES-128 key, then the query parameters will be passed to the key URI as well, unless the `key_query` extractor-arg is passed, or unless an external key URI is provided via the `hls_key` extractor-arg. Does not apply to ffmpeg\n* `variant_query`: Passthrough the master m3u8 URL query to its variant playlist URLs if no value is provided, or else apply the query string given as `variant_query=VALUE`\n* `key_query`: Passthrough the master m3u8 URL query to its HLS AES-128 decryption key URI if no value is provided, or else apply the query string given as `key_query=VALUE`. Note that this will have no effect if the key URI is provided via the `hls_key` extractor-arg. Does not apply to ffmpeg\n* `hls_key`: An HLS AES-128 key URI *or* key (as hex), and optionally the IV (as hex), in the form of `(URI|KEY)[,IV]`; e.g. `generic:hls_key=ABCDEF1234567980,0xFEDCBA0987654321`. Passing any of these values will force usage of the native HLS downloader and override the corresponding values found in the m3u8 playlist\n* `is_live`: Bypass live HLS detection and manually set `live_status` - a value of `false` will set `not_live`, any other value (or no value) will set `is_live`\n* `impersonate`: Target(s) to try and impersonate with the initial webpage request; e.g. `generic:impersonate=safari,chrome-110`. Use `generic:impersonate` to impersonate any available target, and use `generic:impersonate=false` to disable impersonation (default)\n\n#### funimation\n* `language`: Audio languages to extract, e.g. `funimation:language=english,japanese`\n* `version`: The video version to extract - `uncut` or `simulcast`\n\n#### crunchyrollbeta (Crunchyroll)\n* `hardsub`: One or more hardsub versions to extract (in order of preference), or `all` (default: `None` = no hardsubs will be extracted), e.g. `crunchyrollbeta:hardsub=en-US,de-DE`\n\n#### vikichannel\n* `video_types`: Types of videos to download - one or more of `episodes`, `movies`, `clips`, `trailers`\n\n#### niconico\n* `segment_duration`: Segment duration in milliseconds for HLS-DMC formats. Use it at your own risk since this feature **may result in your account termination.**\n\n#### youtubewebarchive\n* `check_all`: Try to check more at the cost of more requests. One or more of `thumbnails`, `captures`\n\n#### gamejolt\n* `comment_sort`: `hot` (default), `you` (cookies needed), `top`, `new` - choose comment sorting mode (on GameJolt's side)\n\n#### hotstar\n* `res`: resolution to ignore - one or more of `sd`, `hd`, `fhd`\n* `vcodec`: vcodec to ignore - one or more of `h264`, `h265`, `dvh265`\n* `dr`: dynamic range to ignore - one or more of `sdr`, `hdr10`, `dv`\n\n#### niconicochannelplus\n* `max_comments`: Maximum number of comments to extract - default is `120`\n\n#### tiktok\n* `api_hostname`: Hostname to use for mobile API calls, e.g. `api22-normal-c-alisg.tiktokv.com`\n* `app_name`: Default app name to use with mobile API calls, e.g. `trill`\n* `app_version`: Default app version to use with mobile API calls - should be set along with `manifest_app_version`, e.g. `34.1.2`\n* `manifest_app_version`: Default numeric app version to use with mobile API calls, e.g. `2023401020`\n* `aid`: Default app ID to use with mobile API calls, e.g. `1180`\n* `app_info`: Enable mobile API extraction with one or more app info strings in the format of `<iid>/[app_name]/[app_version]/[manifest_app_version]/[aid]`, where `iid` is the unique app install ID. `iid` is the only required value; all other values and their `/` separators can be omitted, e.g. `tiktok:app_info=1234567890123456789` or `tiktok:app_info=123,456/trill///1180,789//34.0.1/340001`\n* `device_id`: Enable mobile API extraction with a genuine device ID to be used with mobile API calls. Default is a random 19-digit string\n\n#### rokfinchannel\n* `tab`: Which tab to download - one of `new`, `top`, `videos`, `podcasts`, `streams`, `stacks`\n\n#### twitter\n* `api`: Select one of `graphql` (default), `legacy` or `syndication` as the API for tweet extraction. Has no effect if logged in\n\n#### stacommu, wrestleuniverse\n* `device_id`: UUID value assigned by the website and used to enforce device limits for paid livestream content. Can be found in browser local storage\n\n#### twitch\n* `client_id`: Client ID value to be sent with GraphQL requests, e.g. `twitch:client_id=kimne78kx3ncx6brgo4mv6wki5h1ko`\n\n#### nhkradirulive (NHK らじる★らじる LIVE)\n* `area`: Which regional variation to extract.

Modules can similarly be excluded by prefixing the module name with an underscore (e.g. `_myplugin.py`).\n\nTo replace an existing extractor with a subclass of one, set the `plugin_name` class keyword argument (e.g. `class MyPluginIE(ABuiltInIE, plugin_name='myplugin')` will replace `ABuiltInIE` with `MyPluginIE`). Since the extractor replaces the parent, you should exclude the subclass extractor from being imported separately by making it private using one of the methods described above.\n\nIf you are a plugin author, add [yt-dlp-plugins](https://github.com/topics/yt-dlp-plugins) as a topic to your repository for discoverability.\n\nSee the [Developer Instructions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#developer-instructions) on how to write and test an extractor.\n\n# EMBEDDING YT-DLP\n\nyt-dlp makes the best effort to be a good command-line program, and thus should be callable from any programming language.\n\nYour program should avoid parsing the normal stdout since they may change in future versions. Instead, they should use options such as `-J`, `--print`, `--progress-template`, `--exec` etc to create console output that you can reliably reproduce and parse.\n\nFrom a Python program, you can embed yt-dlp in a more powerful fashion, like this:\n\n```python\nfrom yt_dlp import YoutubeDL\n\nURLS = ['https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaW_jenozKc']\nwith YoutubeDL() as ydl:\n    ydl.download(URLS)\n```\n\nMost likely, you'll want to use various options. For a list of options available, have a look at [`yt_dlp/YoutubeDL.py`](yt_dlp/YoutubeDL.py#L183) or `help(yt_dlp.YoutubeDL)` in a Python shell. If you are already familiar with the CLI, you can use [`devscripts/cli_to_api.py`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/devscripts/cli_to_api.py) to translate any CLI switches to `YoutubeDL` params.\n\n**Tip**: If you are porting your code from youtube-dl to yt-dlp, one important point to look out for is that we do not guarantee the return value of `YoutubeDL.extract_info` to be json serializable, or even be a dictionary. It will be dictionary-like, but if you want to ensure it is a serializable dictionary, pass it through `YoutubeDL.sanitize_info` as shown in the [example below](#extracting-information)\n\n## Embedding examples\n\n#### Extracting information\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport yt_dlp\n\nURL = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaW_jenozKc'\n\n# ℹ️ See help(yt_dlp.YoutubeDL) for a list of available options and public functions\nydl_opts = {}\nwith yt_dlp.YoutubeDL(ydl_opts) as ydl:\n    info = ydl.extract_info(URL, download=False)\n\n    #

Furthermore, you can now specify the sort order using `-S`. This allows for much easier format selection than what is possible by simply using `--format` ([examples](#format-selection-examples))\n\n* **Merged with animelover1984/youtube-dl**: You get most of the features and improvements from [animelover1984/youtube-dl](https://github.com/animelover1984/youtube-dl) including `--write-comments`, `BiliBiliSearch`, `BilibiliChannel`, Embedding thumbnail in mp4/ogg/opus, playlist infojson etc. Note that NicoNico livestreams are not available. See [#31](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/pull/31) for details.\n\n* **YouTube improvements**:\n    * Supports Clips, Stories (`ytstories:<channel UCID>`), Search (including filters)**\\***, YouTube Music Search, Channel-specific search, Search prefixes (`ytsearch:`, `ytsearchdate:`)**\\***, Mixes, and Feeds (`:ytfav`, `:ytwatchlater`, `:ytsubs`, `:ythistory`, `:ytrec`, `:ytnotif`)\n    * Fix for [n-sig based throttling](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/issues/29326) **\\***\n    * Download livestreams from the start using `--live-from-start` (*experimental*)\n    * Channel URLs download all uploads of the channel, including shorts and live\n    * Support for [logging in with OAuth](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/Extractors#logging-in-with-oauth)\n\n* **Cookies from browser**: Cookies can be automatically extracted from all major web browsers using `--cookies-from-browser BROWSER[+KEYRING][:PROFILE][::CONTAINER]`\n\n* **Download time range**: Videos can be downloaded partially based on either timestamps or chapters using `--download-sections`\n\n* **Split video by chapters**: Videos can be split into multiple files based on chapters using `--split-chapters`\n\n* **Multi-threaded fragment downloads**: Download multiple fragments of m3u8/mpd videos in parallel. Use `--concurrent-fragments` (`-N`) option to set the number of threads used\n\n* **Aria2c with HLS/DASH**: You can use `aria2c` as the external downloader for DASH(mpd) and HLS(m3u8) formats\n\n* **New and fixed extractors**: Many new extractors have been added and a lot of existing ones have been fixed. See the [changelog](Changelog.md) or the [list of supported sites](supportedsites.md)\n\n* **New MSOs**: Philo, Spectrum, SlingTV, Cablevision, RCN etc.\n\n* **Subtitle extraction from manifests**: Subtitles can be extracted from streaming media manifests. See [commit/be6202f](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/commit/be6202f12b97858b9d716e608394b51065d0419f) for details\n\n* **Multiple paths and output templates**: You can give different [output templates](#output-template) and download paths for different types of files. You can also set a temporary path where intermediary files are downloaded to using `--paths` (`-P`)\n\n* **Portable Configuration**: Configuration files are automatically loaded from the home and root directories. See [CONFIGURATION](#configuration) for details\n\n* **Output template improvements**: Output templates can now have date-time formatting, numeric offsets, object traversal etc. See [output template](#output-template) for details. Even more advanced operations can also be done with the help of `--parse-metadata` and `--replace-in-metadata`\n\n* **Other new options**: Many new options have been added such as `--alias`, `--print`, `--concat-playlist`, `--wait-for-video`, `--retry-sleep`, `--sleep-requests`, `--convert-thumbnails`, `--force-download-archive`, `--force-overwrites`, `--break-match-filters` etc\n\n* **Improvements**: Regex and other operators in `--format`/`--match-filters`, multiple `--postprocessor-args` and `--downloader-args`, faster archive checking, more [format selection options](#format-selection), merge multi-video/audio, multiple `--config-locations`, `--exec` at different stages, etc\n\n* **Plugins**: Extractors and PostProcessors can be loaded from an external file. See [plugins](#plugins) for details\n\n* **Self updater**: The releases can be updated using `yt-dlp -U`, and downgraded using `--update-to` if required\n\n* **Automated builds**: [Nightly/master builds](#update-channels) can be used with `--update-to nightly` and `--update-to master`\n\nSee [changelog](Changelog.md) or [commits](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/commits) for the full list of changes\n\nFeatures marked with a **\\*** have been back-ported to youtube-dl\n\n### Differences in default behavior\n\nSome of yt-dlp's default options are different from that of youtube-dl and youtube-dlc:\n\n* yt-dlp supports only [Python 3.9+](## \"Windows 8\"), and will remove support for more versions as they [become EOL](https://devguide.python.org/versions/#python-release-cycle); while [youtube-dl still supports Python 2.6+ and 3.2+](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/issues/30568#issue-1118238743)\n* The options `--auto-number` (`-A`), `--title` (`-t`) and `--literal` (`-l`), no longer work. See [removed options](#Removed) for details\n* `avconv` is not supported as an alternative to `ffmpeg`\n* yt-dlp stores config files in slightly different locations to youtube-dl. See [CONFIGURATION](#configuration) for a list of correct locations\n* The default [output template](#output-template) is `%(title)s [%(id)s].%(ext)s`. There is no real reason for this change. This was changed before yt-dlp was ever made public and now there are no plans to change it back to `%(title)s-%(id)s.%(ext)s`. Instead, you may use `--compat-options filename`\n* The default [format sorting](#sorting-formats) is different from youtube-dl and prefers higher resolution and better codecs rather than higher bitrates. You can use the `--format-sort` option to change this to any order you prefer, or use `--compat-options format-sort` to use youtube-dl's sorting order. Older versions of yt-dlp preferred VP9 due to its broader compatibility; you can use `--compat-options prefer-vp9-sort` to revert to that format sorting preference. These two compat options cannot be used together\n* The default format selector is `bv*+ba/b`. This means that if a combined video + audio format that is better than the best video-only format is found, the former will be preferred. Use `-f bv+ba/b` or `--compat-options format-spec` to revert this\n* Unlike youtube-dlc, yt-dlp does not allow merging multiple audio/video streams into one file by default (since this conflicts with the use of `-f bv*+ba`). If needed, this feature must be enabled using `--audio-multistreams` and `--video-multistreams`. You can also use `--compat-options multistreams` to enable both\n* `--no-abort-on-error` is enabled by default. Use `--abort-on-error` or `--compat-options abort-on-error` to abort on errors instead\n* When writing metadata files such as thumbnails, description or infojson, the same information (if available) is also written for playlists. Use `--no-write-playlist-metafiles` or `--compat-options no-playlist-metafiles` to not write these files\n* `--add-metadata` attaches the `infojson` to `mkv` files in addition to writing the metadata when used with `--write-info-json`. Use `--no-embed-info-json` or `--compat-options no-attach-info-json` to revert this\n* Some metadata are embedded into different fields when using `--add-metadata` as compared to youtube-dl. Most notably, `comment` field contains the `webpage_url` and `synopsis` contains the `description`. You can [use `--parse-metadata`](#modifying-metadata) to modify this to your liking or use `--compat-options embed-metadata` to revert this\n* `playlist_index` behaves differently when used with options like `--playlist-reverse` and `--playlist-items`. See [#302](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/302) for details. You can use `--compat-options playlist-index` if you want to keep the earlier behavior\n* The output of `-F` is listed in a new format. Use `--compat-options list-formats` to revert this\n* Live chats (if available) are considered as subtitles. Use `--sub-langs all,-live_chat` to download all subtitles except live chat. You can also use `--compat-options no-live-chat` to prevent any live chat/danmaku from downloading\n* YouTube channel URLs download all uploads of the channel. To download only the videos in a specific tab, pass the tab's URL. If the channel does not show the requested tab, an error will be raised. Also, `/live` URLs raise an error if there are no live videos instead of silently downloading the entire channel. You may use `--compat-options no-youtube-channel-redirect` to revert all these redirections\n* Unavailable videos are also listed for YouTube playlists. Use `--compat-options no-youtube-unavailable-videos` to remove this\n* The upload dates extracted from YouTube are in UTC [when available](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/89e4d86171c7b7c997c77d4714542e0383bf0db0/yt_dlp/extractor/youtube.py#L3898-L3900). Use `--compat-options no-youtube-prefer-utc-upload-date` to prefer the non-UTC upload date.\n* If `ffmpeg` is used as the downloader, the downloading and merging of formats happen in a single step when possible. Use `--compat-options no-direct-merge` to revert this\n* Thumbnail embedding in `mp4` is done with mutagen if possible. Use `--compat-options embed-thumbnail-atomicparsley` to force the use of AtomicParsley instead\n* Some internal metadata such as filenames are removed by default from the infojson. Use `--no-clean-infojson` or `--compat-options no-clean-infojson` to revert this\n* When `--embed-subs` and `--write-subs` are used together, the subtitles are written to disk and also embedded in the media file. You can use just `--embed-subs` to embed the subs and automatically delete the separate file. See [#630 (comment)](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/630#issuecomment-893659460) for more info. `--compat-options no-keep-subs` can be used to revert this\n* `certifi` will be used for SSL root certificates, if installed. If you want to use system certificates (e.g. self-signed), use `--compat-options no-certifi`\n* yt-dlp's sanitization of invalid characters in filenames is different/smarter than in youtube-dl. You can use `--compat-options filename-sanitization` to revert to youtube-dl's behavior\n* ~~yt-dlp tries to parse the external downloader outputs into the standard progress output if possible (Currently implemented: [aria2c](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/5931)). You can use `--compat-options no-external-downloader-progress` to get the downloader output as-is~~\n* yt-dlp versions between 2021.09.01 and 2023.01.02 applies `--match-filters` to nested playlists. This was an unintentional side-effect of [8f18ac](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/commit/8f18aca8717bb0dd49054555af8d386e5eda3a88) and is fixed in [d7b460](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/commit/d7b460d0e5fc710950582baed2e3fc616ed98a80). Use `--compat-options playlist-match-filter` to revert this\n* yt-dlp versions between 2021.11.10 and 2023.06.21 estimated `filesize_approx` values for fragmented/manifest formats. This was added for convenience in [f2fe69](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/commit/f2fe69c7b0d208bdb1f6292b4ae92bc1e1a7444a), but was reverted in [0dff8e](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/commit/0dff8e4d1e6e9fb938f4256ea9af7d81f42fd54f) due to the potentially extreme inaccuracy of the estimated values. Use `--compat-options manifest-filesize-approx` to keep extracting the estimated values\n* yt-dlp uses modern http client backends such as `requests`. Use `--compat-options prefer-legacy-http-handler` to prefer the legacy http handler (`urllib`) to be used for standard http requests.\n* The sub-modules `swfinterp`, `casefold` are removed.\n* Passing `--simulate` (or calling `extract_info` with `download=False`) no longer alters the default format selection. See [#9843](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/9843) for details.\n\nFor ease of use, a few more compat options are available:\n\n* `--compat-options all`: Use all compat options (**Do NOT use this!**)\n* `--compat-options youtube-dl`: Same as `--compat-options all,-multistreams,-playlist-match-filter,-manifest-filesize-approx,-allow-unsafe-ext,-prefer-vp9-sort`\n* `--compat-options youtube-dlc`: Same as `--compat-options all,-no-live-chat,-no-youtube-channel-redirect,-playlist-match-filter,-manifest-filesize-approx,-allow-unsafe-ext,-prefer-vp9-sort`\n* `--compat-options 2021`: Same as `--compat-options 2022,no-certifi,filename-sanitization,no-youtube-prefer-utc-upload-date`\n* `--compat-options 2022`: Same as `--compat-options 2023,playlist-match-filter,no-external-downloader-progress,prefer-legacy-http-handler,manifest-filesize-approx`\n* `--compat-options 2023`: Same as `--compat-options prefer-vp9-sort`. Use this to enable all future compat options\n\nThe following compat options restore vulnerable behavior from before security patches:\n\n* `--compat-options allow-unsafe-ext`: Allow files with any extension (including unsafe ones) to be downloaded ([GHSA-79w7-vh3h-8g4j](<https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/security/advisories/GHSA-79w7-vh3h-8g4j>))\n\n    > :warning: Only use if a valid file download is rejected because its extension is detected as uncommon\n    >\n    > **This option can enable remote code execution! Consider [opening an issue](<https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/new/choose>) instead!**\n\n### Deprecated options\n\nThese are all the deprecated options and the current alternative to achieve the same effect\n\n#### Almost redundant options\nWhile these options are almost the same as their new counterparts, there are some differences that prevents them being redundant\n\n    -j, --dump-json                  --print \"%()j\"\n    -F, --list-formats               --print formats_table\n    --list-thumbnails                --print thumbnails_table --print playlist:thumbnails_table\n    --list-subs                      --print automatic_captions_table --print subtitles_table\n\n#### Redundant options\nWhile these options are redundant, they are still expected to be used due to their ease of use\n\n    --get-description                --print description\n    --get-duration                   --print duration_string\n    --get-filename                   --print filename\n    --get-format                     --print format\n    --get-id                         --print id\n    --get-thumbnail                  --print thumbnail\n    -e, --get-title                  --print title\n    -g, --get-url                    --print urls\n    --match-title REGEX              --match-filters \"title ~= (?i)REGEX\"\n    --reject-title REGEX             --match-filters \"title !~= (?i)REGEX\"\n    --min-views COUNT                --match-filters \"view_count >=?
