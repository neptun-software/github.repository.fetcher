(#1659)\n- Promises returned from `q.push` and `q.unshift` when a callback is not passed now resolve even if an error ocurred. (#1659)\n- Fixed a parsing bug in `autoInject` with complicated function bodies (#1663)\n- Added ES6+ configuration for Browserify bundlers (#1653)\n- Various doc fixes (#1664, #1658, #1665, #1652)\n\n# v3.0.1\n\n## Bug fixes\n- Fixed a regression where arrays passed to `queue` and `cargo` would be completely flattened. (#1645)\n- Clarified Async's browser support (#1643)\n\n\n# v3.0.0\n\nThe `async`/`await` release!\n\nThere are a lot of new features and subtle breaking changes in this major version, but the biggest feature is that most Async methods return a Promise if you omit the callback, meaning you can `await` them from within an `async` function.\n\n```js\nconst results = await async.mapLimit(urls, 5, async url => {\n    const resp = await fetch(url)\n    return resp.body\n})\n```\n\n## Breaking Changes\n- Most Async methods return a Promise when the final callback is omitted, making them `await`-able! (#1572)\n- We are now making heavy use of ES2015 features, this means we have dropped out-of-the-box support for Node 4 and earlier, and many old versions of browsers. (#1541, #1553)\n- In `queue`, `priorityQueue`, `cargo` and `cargoQueue`, the \"event\"-style methods, like `q.drain` and `q.saturated` are now methods that register a callback, rather than properties you assign a callback to.  They are now of the form `q.drain(callback)`.  If you do not pass a callback a Promise will be returned for the next occurrence of the event, making them `await`-able, e.g. `await q.drain()`.  (#1586, #1641)\n- Calling `callback(false)` will cancel an async method, preventing further iteration and callback calls.  This is useful for preventing memory leaks when you break out of an async flow by calling an outer callback. (#1064, #1542)\n- `during` and `doDuring` have been removed, and instead `whilst`, `doWhilst`, `until` and `doUntil` now have asynchronous `test` functions. (#850, #1557)\n- `limits` of less than 1 now cause an error to be thrown in queues and collection methods. (#1249, #1552)\n- `memoize` no longer memoizes errors (#1465, #1466)\n- `applyEach`/`applyEachSeries` have a simpler interface, to make them more easily type-able.  It always returns a function that takes in a single callback argument.  If that callback is omitted, a promise is returned, making it awaitable. (#1228, #1640)\n\n## New Features\n- Async generators are now supported in all the Collection methods. (#1560)\n- Added `cargoQueue`, a queue with both `concurrency` and `payload` size parameters. (#1567)\n- Queue objects returned from `queue` now have a `Symbol.iterator` method, meaning they can be iterated over to inspect the current list of items in the queue. (#1459, #1556)\n- A ESM-flavored `async.mjs` is included in the `async` package.  This is described in the `package.json` `\"module\"` field, meaning it should be automatically used by Webpack and other compatible bundlers.\n\n## Bug fixes\n- Better handle arbitrary error objects in `asyncify` (#1568, #1569)\n\n## Other\n- Removed Lodash as a dependency (#1283, #1528)\n- Miscellaneous docs fixes (#1393, #1501, #1540, #1543, #1558, #1563, #1564, #1579, #1581)\n- Miscellaneous test fixes (#1538)\n\n-------\n\n# v2.6.1\n- Updated lodash to prevent `npm audit` warnings. (#1532, #1533)\n- Made `async-es` more optimized for webpack users (#1517)\n- Fixed a stack overflow with large collections and a synchronous iterator (#1514)\n- Various small fixes/chores (#1505, #1511, #1527, #1530)\n\n# v2.6.0\n- Added missing aliases for many methods.  Previously, you could not (e.g.) `require('async/find')` or use `async.anyLimit`. (#1483)\n- Improved `queue` performance. (#1448, #1454)\n- Add missing sourcemap (#1452, #1453)\n- Various doc updates (#1448, #1471, #1483)\n\n# v2.5.0\n- Added `concatLimit`, the `Limit` equivalent of [`concat`](https://caolan.github.io/async/docs.html#concat) ([#1426](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1426), [#1430](https://github.com/caolan/async/pull/1430))\n- `concat` improvements: it now preserves order, handles falsy values and the `iteratee` callback takes a variable number of arguments ([#1437](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1437), [#1436](https://github.com/caolan/async/pull/1436))\n- Fixed an issue in `queue`  where there was a size discrepancy between `workersList().length` and `running()` ([#1428](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1428), [#1429](https://github.com/caolan/async/pull/1429))\n- Various doc fixes ([#1422](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1422), [#1424](https://github.com/caolan/async/pull/1424))\n\n# v2.4.1\n- Fixed a bug preventing functions wrapped  with `timeout()` from being re-used. ([#1418](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1418), [#1419](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1419))\n\n# v2.4.0\n- Added `tryEach`, for running async functions in parallel, where you only expect one to succeed. ([#1365](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1365), [#687](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/687))\n- Improved performance, most notably in `parallel` and `waterfall` ([#1395](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1395))\n- Added `queue.remove()`, for removing items in a `queue` ([#1397](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1397), [#1391](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1391))\n- Fixed using `eval`, preventing Async from running in pages with Content Security Policy ([#1404](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1404), [#1403](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1403))\n- Fixed errors thrown in an `asyncify`ed function's callback being caught by the underlying Promise ([#1408](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1408))\n- Fixed timing of `queue.empty()` ([#1367](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1367))\n- Various doc fixes ([#1314](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1314), [#1394](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1394), [#1412](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1412))\n\n# v2.3.0\n- Added support for ES2017 `async` functions.  Wherever you can pass a Node-style/CPS function that uses a callback, you can also pass an `async` function.  Previously, you had to wrap `async` functions with `asyncify`.  The caveat is that it will only work if `async` functions are supported natively in your environment, transpiled implementations can't be detected.  ([#1386](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1386), [#1390](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1390))\n- Small doc fix ([#1392](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1392))\n\n# v2.2.0\n- Added `groupBy`, and the `Series`/`Limit` equivalents, analogous to [`_.groupBy`](http://lodash.com/docs#groupBy) ([#1364](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1364))\n- Fixed `transform` bug when `callback` was not passed ([#1381](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1381))\n- Added note about `reflect` to `parallel` docs ([#1385](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1385))\n\n# v2.1.5\n- Fix `auto` bug when function names collided with Array.prototype ([#1358](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1358))\n- Improve some error messages ([#1349](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1349))\n- Avoid stack overflow case in queue\n- Fixed an issue in `some`, `every` and `find` where processing would continue after the result was determined.\n- Cleanup implementations of `some`, `every` and `find`\n\n# v2.1.3\n- Make bundle size smaller\n- Create optimized hotpath for `filter` in array case.\n\n# v2.1.2\n- Fixed a stackoverflow bug with `detect`, `some`, `every` on large inputs ([#1293](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1293)).\n\n# v2.1.0\n\n- `retry` and `retryable` now support an optional `errorFilter` function that determines if the `task` should retry on the error ([#1256](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1256), [#1261](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1261))\n- Optimized array iteration in `race`, `cargo`, `queue`, and `priorityQueue` ([#1253](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1253))\n- Added alias documentation to doc site ([#1251](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1251), [#1254](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1254))\n- Added [BootStrap scrollspy](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#scrollspy) to docs to highlight in the sidebar the current method being viewed  ([#1289](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1289), [#1300](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1300))\n- Various minor doc fixes ([#1263](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1263), [#1264](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1264), [#1271](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1271), [#1278](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1278), [#1280](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1280), [#1282](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1282), [#1302](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1302))\n\n# v2.0.1\n\n- Significantly optimized all iteration based collection methods such as `each`, `map`, `filter`, etc ([#1245](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1245), [#1246](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1246), [#1247](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1247)).\n\n# v2.0.0\n\nLots of changes here!\n\nFirst and foremost, we have a slick new [site for docs](https://caolan.github.io/async/). Special thanks to [**@hargasinski**](https://github.com/hargasinski) for his work converting our old docs to `jsdoc` format and implementing the new website. Also huge ups to [**@ivanseidel**](https://github.com/ivanseidel) for designing our new logo. It was a long process for both of these tasks, but I think these changes turned out extraordinary well.\n\nThe biggest feature is modularization. You can now `require(\"async/series\")` to only require the `series` function. Every Async library function is available this way. You still can `require(\"async\")` to require the entire library, like you could do before.\n\nWe also provide Async as a collection of ES2015 modules. You can now `import {each} from 'async-es'` or `import waterfall from 'async-es/waterfall'`. If you are using only a few Async functions, and are using a ES bundler such as Rollup, this can significantly lower your build size.\n\nMajor thanks to [**@Kikobeats**](github.com/Kikobeats), [**@aearly**](github.com/aearly) and [**@megawac**](github.com/megawac) for doing the majority of the modularization work, as well as [**@jdalton**](github.com/jdalton) and [**@Rich-Harris**](github.com/Rich-Harris) for advisory work on the general modularization strategy.\n\nAnother one of the general themes of the 2.0 release is standardization of what an \"async\" function is. We are now more strictly following the node-style continuation passing style. That is, an async function is a function that:\n\n1. Takes a variable number of arguments\n2. The last argument is always a callback\n3. The callback can accept any number of arguments\n4. The first argument passed to the callback will be treated as an error result, if the argument is truthy\n5. Any number of result arguments can be passed after the \"error\" argument\n6. The callback is called once and exactly once, either on the same tick or later tick of the JavaScript event loop.\n\nThere were several cases where Async accepted some functions that did not strictly have these properties, most notably `auto`, `every`, `some`, `filter`, `reject` and `detect`.\n\nAnother theme is performance. We have eliminated internal deferrals in all cases where they make sense. For example, in `waterfall` and `auto`, there was a `setImmediate` between each task -- these deferrals have been removed. A `setImmediate` call can add up to 1ms of delay. This might not seem like a lot, but it can add up if you are using many Async functions in the course of processing a HTTP request, for example. Nearly all asynchronous functions that do I/O already have some sort of deferral built in, so the extra deferral is unnecessary. The trade-off of this change is removing our built-in stack-overflow defense. Many synchronous callback calls in series can quickly overflow the JS call stack. If you do have a function that is sometimes synchronous (calling its callback on the same tick), and are running into stack overflows, wrap it with `async.ensureAsync()`.\n\nAnother big performance win has been re-implementing `queue`, `cargo`, and `priorityQueue` with [doubly linked lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list) instead of arrays. This has lead to queues being an order of [magnitude faster on large sets of tasks](https://github.com/caolan/async/pull/1205).\n\n## New Features\n\n- Async is now modularized. Individual functions can be `require()`d from the main package. (`require('async/auto')`) ([#984](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/984), [#996](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/996))\n- Async is also available as a collection of ES2015 modules in the new `async-es` package. (`import {forEachSeries} from 'async-es'`) ([#984](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/984), [#996](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/996))\n- Added `race`, analogous to `Promise.race()`. It will run an array of async tasks in parallel and will call its callback with the result of the first task to respond. ([#568](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/568), [#1038](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1038))\n- Collection methods now accept ES2015 iterators.  Maps, Sets, and anything that implements the iterator spec can now be passed directly to `each`, `map`, `parallel`, etc.. ([#579](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/579), [#839](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/839), [#1074](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1074))\n- Added `mapValues`, for mapping over the properties of an object and returning an object with the same keys. ([#1157](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1157), [#1177](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1177))\n- Added `timeout`, a wrapper for an async function that will make the task time-out after the specified time. ([#1007](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1007), [#1027](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1027))\n- Added `reflect` and `reflectAll`, analagous to [`Promise.reflect()`](http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/api/reflect.html), a wrapper for async tasks that always succeeds, by gathering results and errors into an object.  ([#942](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/942), [#1012](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1012), [#1095](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1095))\n- `constant` supports dynamic arguments -- it will now always use its last argument as the callback. ([#1016](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1016), [#1052](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1052))\n- `setImmediate` and `nextTick` now support arguments to partially apply to the deferred function, like the node-native versions do. ([#940](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/940), [#1053](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1053))\n- `auto` now supports resolving cyclic dependencies using [Kahn's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting#Kahn.27s_algorithm) ([#1140](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1140)).\n- Added `autoInject`, a relative of `auto` that automatically spreads a task's dependencies as arguments to the task function. ([#608](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/608), [#1055](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1055), [#1099](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1099), [#1100](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1100))\n- You can now limit the concurrency of `auto` tasks. ([#635](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/635), [#637](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/637))\n- Added `retryable`, a relative of `retry` that wraps an async function, making it retry when called. ([#1058](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1058))\n- `retry` now supports specifying a function that determines the next time interval, useful for exponential backoff, logging and other retry strategies. ([#1161](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1161))\n- `retry` will now pass all of the arguments the task function was resolved with to the callback ([#1231](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1231)).\n- Added `q.unsaturated` -- callback called when a `queue`'s number of running workers falls below a threshold. ([#868](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/868), [#1030](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1030), [#1033](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1033), [#1034](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1034))\n- Added `q.error` -- a callback called whenever a `queue` task calls its callback with an error. ([#1170](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1170))\n- `applyEach` and `applyEachSeries` now pass results to the final callback. ([#1088](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1088))\n\n## Breaking changes\n\n- Calling a callback more than once is considered an error, and an error will be thrown. This had an explicit breaking change in `waterfall`. If you were relying on this behavior, you should more accurately represent your control flow as an event emitter or stream. ([#814](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/814), [#815](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/815), [#1048](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1048), [#1050](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1050))\n- `auto` task functions now always take the callback as the last argument. If a task has dependencies, the `results` object will be passed as the first argument. To migrate old task functions, wrap them with [`_.flip`](https://lodash.com/docs#flip) ([#1036](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1036), [#1042](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1042))\n- Internal `setImmediate` calls have been refactored away. This may make existing flows vulnerable to stack overflows if you use many synchronous functions in series. Use `ensureAsync` to work around this. ([#696](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/696), [#704](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/704), [#1049](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1049), [#1050](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1050))\n- `map` used to return an object when iterating over an object.  `map` now always returns an array, like in other libraries.  The previous object behavior has been split out into `mapValues`. ([#1157](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1157), [#1177](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1177))\n- `filter`, `reject`, `some`, `every`, `detect` and their families like `{METHOD}Series` and `{METHOD}Limit` now expect an error as the first callback argument, rather than just a simple boolean. Pass `null` as the first argument, or use `fs.access` instead of `fs.exists`. ([#118](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/118), [#774](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/774), [#1028](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1028), [#1041](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1041))\n- `{METHOD}` and `{METHOD}Series` are now implemented in terms of `{METHOD}Limit`. This is a major internal simplification, and is not expected to cause many problems, but it does subtly affect how functions execute internally. ([#778](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/778), [#847](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/847))\n- `retry`'s callback is now optional. Previously, omitting the callback would partially apply the function, meaning it could be passed directly as a task to `series` or `auto`. The partially applied \"control-flow\" behavior has been separated out into `retryable`. ([#1054](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1054), [#1058](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1058))\n- The test function for `whilst`, `until`, and `during` used to be passed non-error args from the iteratee function's callback, but this led to weirdness where the first call of the test function would be passed no args. We have made it so the test function is never passed extra arguments, and only the `doWhilst`, `doUntil`, and `doDuring` functions pass iteratee callback arguments to the test function ([#1217](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1217), [#1224](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1224))\n- The `q.tasks` array has been renamed `q._tasks` and is now implemented as a doubly linked list (DLL). Any code that used to interact with this array will need to be updated to either use the provided helpers or support DLLs ([#1205](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1205)).\n- The timing of the `q.saturated()` callback in a `queue` has been modified to better reflect when tasks pushed to the queue will start queueing. ([#724](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/724), [#1078](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1078))\n- Removed `iterator` method in favour of [ES2015 iterator protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Iterators_and_Generators ) which natively supports arrays ([#1237](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1237))\n- Dropped support for Component, Jam, SPM, and Volo ([#1175](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1175), #[#176](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/176))\n\n## Bug Fixes\n\n- Improved handling of no dependency cases in `auto` & `autoInject` ([#1147](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1147)).\n- Fixed a bug where the callback generated by `asyncify` with  `Promises` could resolve twice ([#1197](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1197)).\n- Fixed several documented optional callbacks not actually being optional ([#1223](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1223)).\n\n## Other\n\n- Added `someSeries` and `everySeries` for symmetry, as well as a complete set of `any`/`anyLimit`/`anySeries` and `all`/`/allLmit`/`allSeries` aliases.\n- Added `find` as an alias for `detect. (as well as `findLimit` and `findSeries`).\n- Various doc fixes ([#1005](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1005), [#1008](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1008), [#1010](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1010), [#1015](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1015), [#1021](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1021), [#1037](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1037), [#1039](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1039), [#1051](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1051), [#1102](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1102), [#1107](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1107), [#1121](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1121), [#1123](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1123), [#1129](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1129), [#1135](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1135), [#1138](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1138), [#1141](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1141), [#1153](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1153), [#1216](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1216), [#1217](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1217), [#1232](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1232), [#1233](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1233), [#1236](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1236), [#1238](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1238))\n\nThank you [**@aearly**](github.com/aearly) and [**@megawac**](github.com/megawac) for taking the lead on version 2 of async.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\n# v1.5.2\n- Allow using `\"constructor\"` as an argument in `memoize` ([#998](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/998))\n- Give a better error messsage when `auto` dependency checking fails ([#994](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/994))\n- Various doc updates ([#936](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/936), [#956](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/956), [#979](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/979), [#1002](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/1002))\n\n# v1.5.1\n- Fix issue with `pause` in `queue` with concurrency enabled ([#946](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/946))\n- `while` and `until` now pass the final result to callback ([#963](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/963))\n- `auto` will properly handle concurrency when there is no callback ([#966](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/966))\n- `auto` will no. properly stop execution when an error occurs ([#988](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/988), [#993](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/993))\n- Various doc fixes ([#971](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/971), [#980](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/980))\n\n# v1.5.0\n\n- Added `transform`, analogous to [`_.transform`](http://lodash.com/docs#transform) ([#892](https://github.com/caolan/async/issues/892))\n- `map` now returns an object when an object is passed in, rather than array with non-numeric keys. `map` will begin always returning an array with numeric indexes in the next major release.

Although originally designed for\nuse with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and installable via `npm i async`,\nit can also be used directly in the browser.\n\nAsync is also installable via:\n\n- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/): `yarn add async`\n\nAsync provides around 70 functions that include the usual 'functional'\nsuspects (`map`, `reduce`, `filter`, `each`…) as well as some common patterns\nfor asynchronous control flow (`parallel`, `series`, `waterfall`…). All these\nfunctions assume you follow the Node.js convention of providing a single\ncallback as the last argument of your asynchronous function -- a callback which expects an Error as its first argument -- and calling the callback once.\n\nYou can also pass `async` functions to Async methods, instead of callback-accepting functions.  For more information, see [AsyncFunction](global.html#AsyncFunction)\n\n\n## Quick Examples\n\n```js\nasync.map(['file1','file2','file3'], fs.stat, function(err, results) {\n    // results is now an array of stats for each file\n});\n\nasync.filter(['file1','file2','file3'], function(filePath, callback) {\n  fs.access(filePath, function(err) {\n    callback(null, !err)\n  });\n}, function(err, results) {\n    // results now equals an array of the existing files\n});\n\nasync.parallel([\n    function(callback) { ... },\n    function(callback) { ... }\n], function(err, results) {\n    // optional callback\n});\n\nasync.series([\n    function(callback) { ... },\n    function(callback) { ... }\n]);\n```\n\nThere are many more functions available so take a look at the docs below for a\nfull list. This module aims to be comprehensive, so if you feel anything is\nmissing please create a GitHub issue for it.\n\n## Common Pitfalls [(StackOverflow)](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/async.js)\n\n### Synchronous iteration functions\n\nIf you get an error like `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded.` or other stack overflow issues when using async, you are likely using a synchronous iteratee.  By *synchronous* we mean a function that calls its callback on the same tick in the javascript event loop, without doing any I/O or using any timers.  Calling many callbacks iteratively will quickly overflow the stack. If you run into this issue, just defer your callback with `async.setImmediate` to start a new call stack on the next tick of the event loop.\n\nThis can also arise by accident if you callback early in certain cases:\n\n```js\nasync.eachSeries(hugeArray, function iteratee(item, callback) {\n    if (inCache(item)) {\n        callback(null, cache[item]); // if many items are cached, you'll overflow\n    } else {\n        doSomeIO(item, callback);\n    }\n}, function done() {\n    //...\n});\n```\n\nJust change it to:\n\n```js\nasync.eachSeries(hugeArray, function iteratee(item, callback) {\n    if (inCache(item)) {\n        async.setImmediate(function() {\n            callback(null, cache[item]);\n        });\n    } else {\n        doSomeIO(item, callback);\n        //...\n    }\n});\n```\n\nAsync does not guard against synchronous iteratees for performance reasons.  If you are still running into stack overflows, you can defer as suggested above, or wrap functions with [`async.ensureAsync`](#ensureAsync)  Functions that are asynchronous by their nature do not have this problem and don't need the extra callback deferral.\n\nIf JavaScript's event loop is still a bit nebulous, check out [this article](http://blog.carbonfive.com/2013/10/27/the-javascript-event-loop-explained/) or [this talk](http://2014.jsconf.eu/speakers/philip-roberts-what-the-heck-is-the-event-loop-anyway.html) for more detailed information about how it works.\n\n\n### Multiple callbacks\n\nMake sure to always `return` when calling a callback early, otherwise you will cause multiple callbacks and unpredictable behavior in many cases.\n\n```js\nasync.waterfall([\n    function(callback) {\n        getSomething(options, function (err, result) {\n            if (err) {\n                callback(new Error(\"failed getting something:\" + err.message));\n                // we should return here\n            }\n            // since we did not return, this callback still will be called and\n            // `processData` will be called twice\n            callback(null, result);\n        });\n    },\n    processData\n], done)\n```\n\nIt is always good practice to `return callback(err, result)`  whenever a callback call is not the last statement of a function.\n\n### Using ES2017 `async` functions\n\nAsync accepts `async` functions wherever we accept a Node-style callback function.  However, we do not pass them a callback, and instead use the return value and handle any promise rejections or errors thrown.\n\n```js\nasync.mapLimit(files, 10, async file => { // <- no callback!\n    const text = await util.promisify(fs.readFile)(dir + file, 'utf8')\n    const body = JSON.parse(text) // <- a parse error here will be caught automatically\n    if (!(await checkValidity(body))) {\n        throw new Error(`${file} has invalid contents`) // <- this error will also be caught\n    }\n    return body // <- return a value!\n}, (err, contents) => {\n    if (err) throw err\n    console.log(contents)\n})\n```\n\nWe can only detect native `async` functions, not transpiled versions (e.g. with Babel).  Otherwise, you can wrap `async` functions in `async.asyncify()`.\n\n### Binding a context to an iteratee\n\nThis section is really about `bind`, not about Async. If you are wondering how to\nmake Async execute your iteratees in a given context, or are confused as to why\na method of another library isn't working as an iteratee, study this example:\n\n```js\n// Here is a simple object with an (unnecessarily roundabout) squaring method\nvar AsyncSquaringLibrary = {\n    squareExponent: 2,\n    square: function(number, callback){\n        var result = Math.pow(number, this.squareExponent);\n        setTimeout(function(){\n            callback(null, result);\n        }, 200);\n    }\n};\n\nasync.map([1, 2, 3], AsyncSquaringLibrary.square, function(err, result) {\n    // result is [NaN, NaN, NaN]\n    // This fails because the `this.squareExponent` expression in the square\n    // function is not evaluated in the context of AsyncSquaringLibrary, and is\n    // therefore undefined.\n});\n\nasync.map([1, 2, 3], AsyncSquaringLibrary.square.bind(AsyncSquaringLibrary), function(err, result) {\n    // result is [1, 4, 9]\n    // With the help of bind we can attach a context to the iteratee before\n    // passing it to Async. Now the square function will be executed in its\n    // 'home' AsyncSquaringLibrary context and the value of `this.squareExponent`\n    // will be as expected.\n});\n```\n\n### Subtle Memory Leaks\n\nThere are cases where you might want to exit early from async flow, when calling an Async method inside another async function:\n\n```javascript\nfunction myFunction (args, outerCallback) {\n    async.waterfall([\n        //...\n        function (arg, next) {\n            if (someImportantCondition()) {\n                return outerCallback(null)\n            }\n        },\n        function (arg, next) {/*...*/}\n    ], function done (err) {\n        //...\n    })\n}\n```\n\nSomething happened in a waterfall where you want to skip the rest of the execution, so you call an outer callack.  However, Async will still wait for that inner `next` callback to be called, leaving some closure scope allocated.\n\nAs of version 3.0, you can call any Async callback with `false` as the `error` argument, and the rest of the execution of the Async method will be stopped or ignored.\n\n```javascript\n        function (arg, next) {\n            if (someImportantCondition()) {\n                outerCallback(null)\n                return next(false) // ← signal that you called an outer callback\n            }\n        },\n```\n\n### Mutating collections while processing them\n\nIf you pass an array to a collection method (such as `each`, `mapLimit`, or `filterSeries`), and then attempt to `push`, `pop`, or `splice` additional items on to the array, this could lead to unexpected or undefined behavior.  Async will iterate until the original `length` of the array is met, and the indexes of items `pop()`ed or `splice()`d could already have been processed. Therefore, it is not recommended to modify the array after Async has begun iterating over it.  If you do need to `push`, `pop`, or `splice`, use a `queue` instead.\n\n\n## Download\n\nThe source is available for download from\n[GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caolan/async/master/dist/async.min.js).\nAlternatively, you can install using npm:\n\n```bash\n$ npm i async\n```\n\nYou can then `require()` async as normal:\n\n```js\nvar async = require(\"async\");\n```\n\nOr require individual methods:\n\n```js\nvar waterfall = require(\"async/waterfall\");\nvar map = require(\"async/map\");\n```\n\n__Development:__ [async.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caolan/async/master/dist/async.js) - 29.6kb Uncompressed\n\n### In the Browser\n\nAsync should work in any ES2015 environment (Node 6+ and all modern browsers).\n\nIf you want to use Async in an older environment, (e.g. Node 4, IE11) you will have to transpile.\n\nUsage:\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"async.js\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\n    async.map(data, asyncProcess, function(err, results) {\n        alert(results);\n    });\n\n</script>\n```\n\nThe portable versions of Async, including `async.js` and `async.min.js`, are\nincluded in the `/dist` folder. Async can also be found on the [jsDelivr CDN](http://www.jsdelivr.com/projects/async).\n\n### ES Modules\n\nAsync includes a `.mjs` version that should automatically be used by compatible bundlers such as Webpack or Rollup, anything that uses the `module` field of the `package.json`.\n\nWe also provide Async as a collection of purely ES2015 modules, in an alternative `async-es` package on npm.\n\n```bash\n$ npm install async-es\n```\n\n```js\nimport waterfall from 'async-es/waterfall';\nimport async from 'async-es';\n```\n\n### Typescript\n\nThere are third-party type definitions for Async.\n\n```\nnpm i -D @types/async\n```\n\nIt is recommended to target ES2017 or higher in your `tsconfig.json`, so `async` functions are preserved:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"target\": \"es2017\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Other Libraries\n\n* [`limiter`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/limiter) a package for rate-limiting based on requests per sec/hour.\n* [`neo-async`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/neo-async) an altername implementation of Async, focusing on speed.\n* [`co-async`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/co-async) a library inspired by Async for use with [`co`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/co) and generator functions.\n*  [`promise-async`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/promise-async) a version of Async where all the methods are Promisified.\n* ['modern-async'](https://www.npmjs.com/package/modern-async) an alternative to Async using only async/await and promises.\n"
