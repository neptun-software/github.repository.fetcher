          "content": "# Contributing to Harness\n\nThank you for your interest in open source contributions to Harness. Harness uses GitHub to manage open source reviews of pull requests.\n\n* If you are a new contributor see: [Steps to Contribute](#steps-to-contribute)\n\n* If you have a minor fix or improvement, feel free to create a pull request. Please provide necessary details in the pull request description and use a meaningful title.\n\n* If you plan to do something more involved, first discuss your ideas by [raising an issue](https://github.com/harness/harness/issues). This will avoid unnecessary work and surely give you and us a good deal of inspiration. \n\n* Relevant coding style guidelines are \n\n    - For backend: the [Go Code Review Comments](https://code.google.com/p/go-wiki/wiki/CodeReviewComments) and the formatting and style section of Peter Bourgon's [Go: Best Practices for Production Environments](https://peter.bourgon.org/go-in-production/#formatting-and-style)\n    - For frontend: [Google TypeScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/tsguide.html) and [Best practices for Typescript coding](https://medium.com/@eshagarg1996/best-practices-for-typescript-coding-8b1ea98d02f8). \n\n* Be sure to sign off on the [CLA](https://cla-assistant.io/harness/gitness).\n\n## Steps to Contribute\n\nShould you wish to work on an issue, please claim it first by commenting on the GitHub issue that you want to work on. This is to prevent duplicated efforts from contributors on the same issue.\n\nPlease check the [`good-first-issue`](https://github.com/harness/harness/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) label to find issues that are good for getting started. If you have questions about one of the issues, with or without the tag, please comment on them and one of the maintainers will clarify it. For a quicker response, contact us over [slack](https://developer.harness.io/docs/open-source/support#slack).\n\n### Local Development\n\nPlease review [Harness development](https://github.com/harness/harness/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#harness-development) to build and test your code locally. \n\n### Pre-commit Hook\n\nWe have a pre-commit hook to ensure code quality before committing changes. This hook checks for required binaries (grep, sed, and xargs) and runs checks specifically for Go files (*.go). If any issues are found during the checks, the commit process will be halted until the issues are resolved.\n\n### Lint Check\n\nOur CI Linter pipeline conducts automated checks for code quality, with [separate lint checks for Go and TypeScript](https://github.com/harness/harness/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci-lint.yml). These checks help ensure adherence to coding standards and identify potential issues early in the development process. Thank you for contributing to our code quality efforts!\n\n## Pull Request Checklist\n\n* Branch from the main branch and, if needed, rebase to the current main branch before submitting your pull request. If it doesn't merge cleanly with main you may be asked to rebase your changes.\n\n* Commits should be as small as possible, while ensuring that each commit is correct independently (i.e., each commit should compile and pass tests).\n\n* If your patch is not getting reviewed or you need a specific person to review it, you can @-reply a reviewer asking for a review in the pull request or a comment.\n\n* Add tests relevant to the fixed bug or new feature.\n\n## Dependency management\n\nHarness uses [Go modules](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Modules__module_versions__and_more) to manage dependencies on external packages.\n\nTo add or update a new dependency, use the `go get` command:\n\n```bash\n# Pick the latest tagged release.\ngo get example.com/some/module/pkg@latest\n\n# Pick a specific version.\ngo get example.com/some/module/pkg@vX.Y.Z\n```\n\nTidy up the `go.mod` and `go.sum` files:\n\n```bash\n# The GO111MODULE variable can be omitted when the code isn't located in GOPATH.\nGO111MODULE=on go mod tidy\n```\n\nYou have to commit the changes to `go.mod` and `go.sum` before submitting the pull request.\n\n\n"

          "content": "# Harness\nHarness Open Source is an open source development platform packed with the power of code hosting, automated DevOps pipelines, hosted development environments (Gitspaces), and artifact registries.\n\n## Overview\nHarness Open source is an open source development platform packed with the power of code hosting, automated DevOps pipelines, Gitspaces, and artifact registries.\n\n\n## Running Harness locally\n> The latest publicly released docker image can be found on [harness/harness](https://hub.docker.com/r/harness/harness).\n\nTo install Harness yourself, simply run the command below. Once the container is up, you can visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser.\n\n```bash\ndocker run -d \\\n  -p 3000:3000 \\\n  -p 22:22 \\\n  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\\n  -v /tmp/harness:/data \\\n  --name harness \\\n  --restart always \\\n  harness/harness\n```\n> The Harness image uses a volume to store the database and repositories. It is highly recommended to use a bind mount or named volume as otherwise all data will be lost once the container is stopped.\n\nSee [developer.harness.io](https://developer.harness.io/docs/open-source) to learn how to get the most out of Harness.\n\n## Where is Drone?\n\nHarness Open Source represents a massive investment in the next generation of Drone. Where Drone focused solely on continuous integration, Harness adds source code hosting, developer environments (gitspaces), and artifact registries; providing teams with an end-to-end, open source DevOps platform.\n\nThe goal is for Harness to eventually be at full parity with Drone in terms of pipeline capabilities, allowing users to seamlessly migrate from Drone to Harness.\n\nBut, we expect this to take some time, which is why we took a snapshot of Drone as a feature branch [drone](https://github.com/harness/harness/tree/drone) ([README](https://github.com/harness/harness/blob/drone/.github/readme.md)) so it can continue development.\n\nAs for Harness, the development is taking place on the [main](https://github.com/harness/harness/tree/main) branch.\n\nFor more information on Harness, please visit [developer.harness.io](https://developer.harness.io/).\n\nFor more information on Drone, please visit [drone.io](https://www.drone.io/).\n\n## Harness Open Source Development\n### Pre-Requisites\n\nInstall the latest stable version of Node and Go version 1.20 or higher, and then install the below Go programs. Ensure the GOPATH [bin directory](https://go.dev/doc/gopath_code#GOPATH) is added to your PATH.\n\nInstall protobuf\n- Check if you've already installed protobuf ```protoc --version```\n- If your version is different than v3.21.11, run ```brew unlink protobuf```\n- Get v3.21.11 ```curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/9de8de7a533609ebfded833480c1f7c05a3448cb/Formula/protobuf.rb > /tmp/protobuf.rb```\n- Install it ```brew install /tmp/protobuf.rb```\n- Check out your version ```protoc --version```\n\nInstall protoc-gen-go and protoc-gen-go-rpc:\n\n- Install protoc-gen-go v1.28.1 ```go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@v1.28.1```\n(Note that this will install a binary in $GOBIN so make sure $GOBIN is in your $PATH)\n\n- Install protoc-gen-go-grpc v1.2.0 ```go install google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc@v1.2.0```\n\n```bash\n$ make dep\n$ make tools\n```\n\n### Build\n\nFirst step is to build the user interface artifacts:\n\n```bash\n$ pushd web\n$ yarn install\n$ yarn build\n$ popd\n```\n\nAfter that, you can build the Harness binary:\n\n```bash\n$ make build\n```\n\n### Run\n\nThis project supports all operating systems and architectures supported by Go.  This means you can build and run the system on your machine; docker containers are not required for local development and testing.\n\nTo start the server at `localhost:3000`, simply run the following command:\n\n```bash\n./gitness server .local.env\n```\n\n### Auto-Generate Harness API Client used by UI using Swagger\nPlease make sure to update the autogenerated client code used by the UI when adding new rest APIs.\n\nTo regenerate the code, please execute the following steps:\n- Regenerate swagger with latest Harness binary `./gitness swagger > web/src/services/code/swagger.yaml`\n- navigate to the `web` folder and run `yarn services`\n\nThe latest API changes should now be reflected in `web/src/services/code/index.tsx`\n\n# Run Registry Conformance Tests\n```\nmake conformance-test\n```\nFor running conformance tests with existing running service, use:\n```\nmake hot-conformance-test\n```\n\n## User Interface\n\nThis project includes a full user interface for interacting with the system. When you run the application, you can access the user interface by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.\n\n## REST API\n\nThis project includes a swagger specification. When you run the application, you can access the swagger specification by navigating to `http://localhost:3000/swagger` in your browser (for raw yaml see `http://localhost:3000/openapi.yaml`).\nFor registry endpoints, currently swagger is located on different endpoint `http://localhost:3000/registry/swagger/` (for raw json see `http://localhost:3000/registry/swagger.json`). These will be later moved to the main swagger endpoint. \n\n\nFor testing, it's simplest to just use the cli to create a token (this requires Harness server to run):\n```bash\n# LOGIN (user: admin, pw: changeit)\n$ ./gitness login\n\n# GENERATE PAT (1 YEAR VALIDITY)\n$ ./gitness user pat \"my-pat-uid\" 2592000\n```\n\nThe command outputs a valid PAT that has been granted full access as the user.\nThe token can then be send as part of the `Authorization` header with Postman or curl:\n\n```bash\n$ curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/user \\\n-H \"Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN\"\n```\n\n\n## CLI\nThis project includes VERY basic command line tools for development and running the service. Please remember that you must start the server before you can execute commands.\n\nFor a full list of supported operations, please see\n```bash\n$ ./gitness --help\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nRefer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/harness/harness/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n## License\n\nApache License 2.0, see [LICENSE](https://github.com/harness/harness/blob/main/LICENSE).\n"
