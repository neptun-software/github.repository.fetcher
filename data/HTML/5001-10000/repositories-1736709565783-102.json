Thanks to this comment https://github.com/creativetimofficial/tailwind-starter-kit/issues/10#issuecomment-730641008 from @ryanwinchester\n\n### Major style changes\n\n- The upgrade of Tailwind CSS from version 1 to version 2, will cause multiple style changes, check them out on the official Tailwind CSS websites:\n  - https://blog.tailwindcss.com/tailwindcss-v2\n  - https://tailwindcss.com/\n  - https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrading-to-v2\n- To make a lot of our changes, we've followed the instructions from here (minus the `colors` and `font-sizes`): https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrading-to-v2\n  - For the colors, the only change that we made, is the fact that we've added all Tailwind CSS colors to our `tailwind.config.js` files, and inside our product, all `{type}-gray-{number}` classes were renamed to `{type}-blueGray-{number}`\n  - After that, we've changed `{type}-blueGray-{number}` to `{type}-blueGray-{lower-number}`, i.e. (`100` became `50`, `200` became `100`, ..., `900` became `800`)\n    - You can achieve this, by search in your whole project for `blueGray-100` and replace it with `blueGray-50`\n    - Then, you search in your whole project for `blueGray-200` and replace it with `blueGray-100`\n    - Then, you search in your whole project for `blueGray-300` and replace it with `blueGray-200`\n    - Then, you search in your whole project for `blueGray-400` and replace it with `blueGray-300`\n    - Then, you search in your whole project for `blueGray-500` and replace it with `blueGray-400`\n    - Then, you search in your whole project for `blueGray-600` and replace it with `blueGray-500`\n    - Then, you search in your whole project for `blueGray-700` and replace it with `blueGray-600`\n    - Then, you search in your whole project for `blueGray-800` and replace it with `blueGray-700`\n    - Then, you search in your whole project for `blueGray-900` and replace it with `blueGray-800`\n  - For the colors, the only change that we made, is the fact that we've added all Tailwind CSS colors to our `tailwind.config.js` files, and inside our product, all `{type}-blue-{number}` classes were renamed to `{type}-lightBlue-{number}`\n  - For the colors, the only change that we made, is the fact that we've added all Tailwind CSS colors to our `tailwind.config.js` files, and inside our product, all `{type}-green-{number}` classes were renamed to `{type}-emerald-{number}`\n  - We've also added on most of our inputs the `border-0` class\n  - And on the inputs that were checkboxes, beside the `border-0` class, we've also had to add `rounded` class as well\n\n### Deleted components\n\n### Added components\n\n- We've also added our first NextJS page: `Landing Page/next-landing-page`\n  - Here is the PR for it: https://github.com/creativetimofficial/tailwind-starter-kit/pull/11\n  - Special thanks to @MeridjaNassim\n- If you want to add new pages, feel free to open a PR: https://github.com/creativetimofficial/tailwind-starter-kit/pulls\n\n### Deleted dependencies\n\n- `popper.js`\n\n### Added dependencies\n\n- `@popperjs/core@2.9.1` - So, we've changed the way we use Popper, check out our docs here:\n  - https://www.creative-tim.com/learning-lab/tailwind-starter-kit/documentation/vue/dropdown (you can check the Angular, JS and React as well from here)\n  - https://www.creative-tim.com/learning-lab/tailwind-starter-kit/documentation/vue/popovers/left (you can check the Angular, JS and React as well from here)\n  - https://www.creative-tim.com/learning-lab/tailwind-starter-kit/documentation/vue/tooltips/left (you can check the Angular, JS and React as well from here)\n- `typescript` (for the React versions to stop console warnings - NOTE: the projects are not based on TypeScript)\n- `@vue/compiler-sfc@3.0.7` (for the VueJS versions since we've upgraded to Vue@3)\n- `vue-router@4.0.5` (for the VueJS versions since we've upgraded to Vue@3)\n\n### Angular Updated dependencies\n\n```\n@angular/animations                   8.2.12   →     11.2.6\n@angular/common                       8.2.12   →     11.2.6\n@angular/compiler                     8.2.12   →     11.2.6\n@angular/core                         8.2.12   →     11.2.6\n@angular/forms                        8.2.12   →     11.2.6\n@angular/platform-browser             8.2.12   →     11.2.6\n@angular/platform-browser-dynamic     8.2.12   →     11.2.6\n@angular/router                       8.2.12   →     11.2.6\n@fortawesome/fontawesome-free         5.11.2   →     5.15.3\nchart.js                               2.9.3   →      2.9.4\nrxjs                                   6.4.0   →      6.6.6\ntslib                                ^1.10.0   →     ^2.1.0\nzone.js                                0.9.1   →     0.11.4\n@angular-devkit/build-angular       0.803.15   →   0.1102.5\n@angular/cli                          8.3.15   →     11.2.5\n@angular/compiler-cli                 8.2.12   →     11.2.6\n@angular/language-service             8.2.12   →     11.2.6\n@types/node                            8.9.4   →   14.14.35\n@types/jasmine                         3.3.8   →      3.6.7\n@types/jasminewd2                      2.0.3   →      2.0.8\ncodelyzer                             ^5.0.0   →     ^6.0.1\njasmine-core                           3.4.0   →      3.7.1\njasmine-spec-reporter                  4.2.1   →      6.0.0\nkarma                                  4.1.0   →      6.2.0\nkarma-chrome-launcher                  2.2.0   →      3.1.0\nkarma-coverage-istanbul-reporter       2.0.1   →      3.0.3\nkarma-jasmine                          2.0.1   →      4.0.1\nkarma-jasmine-html-reporter           ^1.4.0   →     ^1.5.4\nprotractor                             5.4.0   →      7.0.0\nts-node                                7.0.0   →      9.1.1\ntslint                                5.15.0   →      6.1.3\ntypescript                             3.5.3   →      4.0.7\n```\n\n### HTML Updated dependencies\n\n```\n@fortawesome/fontawesome-free    5.11.2   →     5.15.3\nchart.js                          2.9.3   →      2.9.4\n```\n\n### React Updated dependencies\n\n```\n@fortawesome/fontawesome-free    5.11.2   →   5.15.3\nchart.js                          2.9.3   →    2.9.4\nreact                           16.11.0   →   17.0.1\nreact-dom                       16.11.0   →   17.0.1\nreact-router                      5.1.2   →    5.2.0\nreact-router-dom                  5.1.2   →    5.2.0\nreact-scripts                     3.2.0   →    4.0.3\n```\n\n### VueJS Updated dependencies\n\n```\n@fortawesome/fontawesome-free   5.11.2   →   5.15.3\nchart.js                         2.9.3   →    2.9.4\ncore-js                          3.3.2   →    3.9.1\nvue                             2.6.10   →    3.0.7\n@vue/cli-plugin-babel            4.0.0   →   5.0.0-alpha.7\n@vue/cli-plugin-eslint           4.0.0   →   5.0.0-alpha.7\n@vue/cli-service                 4.0.0   →   5.0.0-alpha.7\nbabel-eslint                    10.0.3   →   10.1.0\neslint                          5.16.0   →   7.22.0\neslint-plugin-vue                5.0.0   →    7.8.0\nvue-template-compiler           2.6.10   →   2.6.12\n```\n\n### NextJS Updated dependencies\n\n```\n@fortawesome/fontawesome-free     ^5.15.0   →     ^5.15.3\nnext-images                        ^1.6.0   →      ^1.7.0\nreact                            ^16.12.0   →     ^17.0.2\n@types/react                     ^16.9.16   →     ^17.0.3\nreact-dom                        ^16.12.0   →     ^17.0.2\n@types/react-dom                  ^16.9.4   →     ^17.0.3\nsass                             ^1.26.11   →     ^1.32.8\n@fullhuman/postcss-purgecss        ^3.0.0   →      ^4.0.3\n@types/node                     ^12.12.21   →   ^14.14.35\ntailwindcss                       ^1.8.10   →      ^2.0.4\ntypescript                            4.0   →         4.2\n```\n\n### Warning\n\n_When doing a clean install, you might have some warnings, those come from `node_modules` and do not affect the project in any way._\n\n## [1.0.0] 2019-12-20\n\n### Original Release\n\n- Generated Tailwind CSS files using the following documentation: https://www.creative-tim.com/learning-lab/tailwind-starter-kit/documentation/build-tools\n- Created files and projects for each of the Example Pages from the above link, for\n  -

          "content": "> [!NOTE]\n> This repository was previously named **tailwind-starter-kit** and has been renamed to **david-ai** to better reflect its purpose and direction.\n\n# David UI - Free Tailwind CSS Components Library\n\n[David UI](https://www.creative-tim.com/david-ui) is a free and open-source collection of customizable, production-ready UI components built with **Tailwind CSS**. Designed to be developer-friendly and performance-focused, David UI streamlines the creation of modern, visually appealing interfaces, helping you deliver high-quality user experiences faster.\n\n[![David UI Thumb](https://github.com/creativetimofficial/public-assets/blob/master/ct-assets/david-ai.png?raw=true)](https://www.creative-tim.com/david-ui/html/overview)\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  \n[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/david-ai.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/david-ai)\n[![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/david-ai.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/david-ai)\n\n</div>\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [David UI - Free Tailwind CSS Components Library](#david-ui---free-tailwind-css-components-library)\n  - [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)\n  - [Getting Started](#getting-started)\n    - [Using with CDN](#using-with-cdn)\n    - [Basic Usage NPM](#basic-usage-npm)\n    - [Using with Global Access](#using-with-global-access)\n    - [Typescript](#typescript)\n  - [Documentation](#documentation)\n  - [Explore Components](#explore-components)\n  - [Community](#community)\n  - [License](#license)\n  - [Contribute \\& Feedback](#contribute--feedback)\n\n## Getting Started\n\nLearn how to use `david-ai` components to quickly and easily create elegant and flexible pages using Tailwind CSS.\n\n`david-ai` is working with Tailwind CSS classes and you need to have Tailwind CSS installed on your project - <a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation\" target=\"_blank\">Tailwind CSS Installation.</a>\n\n### Using with CDN\n\nYou can include david-ai via a CDN and initialize alerts globally in the browser. Add the following script to your HTML file:\n\n```html\n<script\n  src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/creativetimofficial/david-ai@1.0.6/packages/dist/david-ai.min.js\"\n  defer\n></script>\n```\n\n### Basic Usage NPM\n\n```bash\nnpm i david-ai\n```\n\nAfter installing, you can use the components in your project across different frameworks:\n\n```tsx\nimport { initAlert } from \"david-ai\";\n\n// Initialize alerts\ninitAlert();\n```\n\n### Using with Global Access\n\nIf you prefer, you can use the DavidAI global object instead of directly importing initAlert:\n\n```tsx\nimport * as DavidAI from \"david-ai\";\n\n// Initialize alerts\nDavidAI.initAlert();\n```\n\n## TypeScript\n\nDavid AI components can be used in two ways - through simple ESM imports or programmatically with TypeScript support. Here's how to use both approaches:\n\n### Simple ESM Import\n\nThe quickest way to use components is through direct ESM imports:\n\n```tsx\nimport { initAlert } from \"david-ai\";\n\n// Initialize alerts\ninitAlert();\n```\n\n### Programmatic Usage with TypeScript\n\nFor more control and type safety, you can use the programmatic approach with full TypeScript support:\n\nThis programmatic approach provides:\n\n- Full TypeScript support\n- Fine-grained control over component behavior\n- Access to component instance methods\n- Proper cleanup on unmount\n\n```tsx\nimport { Accordion } from \"david-ai\";\nimport type { AccordionConfig, IAccordion } from \"david-ai\";\n\ndocument.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", () => {\n  const container = document.getElementById(\"accordion-container\");\n\n  if (container) {\n    const config: AccordionConfig = {\n      exclusive: true,\n      allOpen: false,\n    };\n\n    const accordion: IAccordion = new Accordion(container, config);\n\n    // Handle external button controls\n    const showAllButton = document.getElementById(\"show-all\");\n    const hideAllButton = document.getElementById(\"hide-all\");\n    const toggleFirstButton = document.getElementById(\"toggle-first\");\n\n    showAllButton?.addEventListener(\"click\", () => {\n      accordion.showAll();\n    });\n\n    hideAllButton?.addEventListener(\"click\", () => {\n      accordion.hideAll();\n    });\n\n    toggleFirstButton?.addEventListener(\"click\", () => {\n      const firstButton = document.getElementById(\"button-1\") as HTMLElement;\n      if (firstButton) {\n        accordion.toggle(firstButton);\n      }\n    });\n\n    // Cleanup on unmount\n    window.addEventListener(\"unload\", () => {\n      accordion.cleanup();\n    });\n  }\n});\n```\n\nFor detailed usage of each component, check out their respective documentation:\n\n-
