          "content": "# Responsive transactional HTML email templates\n\nTransactional HTML emails often get neglected. **Styling HTML email is painful**. Tables, inline CSS, unsupported CSS, desktop clients, web clients, mobile clients, various devices, various providers.\n\nWe’ve tried to remove some of the pain for you and open-sourced a collection of common templates for transactional email.\n\n\n* [Action email](http://mailgun.github.io/transactional-email-templates/action.html)\n* [Email alert](http://mailgun.github.io/transactional-email-templates/alert.html)\n* [Billing email](http://mailgun.github.io/transactional-email-templates/billing.html)\n\nEach template is **responsive** and each has been **tested** in all the **popular email clients**.\n\n## How to use\n\n* Use these email templates for your transactional emails\n* Use them as is or think of them as boilerplates for more detailed emails\n* Ensure you [inline the CSS](#inline-the-css) before sending the email out\n\n## What are transactional emails?\n\nTypically any email that is triggered by or sent automatically from your application.\n\n* Welcome emails\n* Actionable emails\n* Password resets\n* Receipts\n* Monthly invoices\n* Support requests\n* App error alerts\n* Reminders\n* etc.\n\n## Inline the CSS\n\nBefore sending HTML emails **you should inline your CSS**.\n\nWe recommend using [Premailer](http://premailer.dialect.ca/) to accomplish this.\n\nOur repo contains both the original templates with a separate CSS stylesheet, as well as templates with CSS already inlined for you to preview. See the `/templates/inlined` folder.\n\n## Tested and verified\n\nWe’ve tested these email templates across all the major desktop, web and mobile clients, using [Email on Acid.](https://www.emailonacid.com/)\n\n<img src=\"/assets/EoA.png\">\n\n## Email design workflow with Grunt\n\nYou also might be interested in this [Grunt task](https://github.com/leemunroe/grunt-email-design)  for compiling and testing html emails. We used this to help design and test our transactional emails.\n"
