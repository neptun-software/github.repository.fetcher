On my Twitter account [@cyb_detective](https://linktr.ee/cyb_detective) I post different services, techniques, tricks and notes about OSINT and more. I collect all the links from my tweets in this collection (already 1000+ services for a wide variety of purposes).\n\n\nThank you for following me! [@cyb_detective](https://cybdetective.com)\n\n\n\nDon't forget that OSINT's main strength is in automation. Read the [Netlas Cookbook](https://github.com/netlas-io/netlas-cookbook) for details and examples.\n\n## Most important categories\n\n\n| Section                                   | Link                                                                                                   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Maps, Geolocation and Transport           | [Explore](#maps-geolocation-and-transport)                                 |\n| Social Media                              | [Explore](#social-media) |\n| Domain/IP/Links                           | [Explore](#domainiplinks)                  |\n| Image Search and Identification           | [Explore](#image-search-and-identification)                         |\n| Cryptocurrencies                          | [Explore](#cryptocurrencies)                       |\n| Messengers                                | [Explore](#messengers)                       |\n| Code                                      | [Explore](#code)                       |\n| Search engines                            | [Explore](#search-engines)                       |\n| IOT                                       | [Explore](#iot)                       |\n| Archives                                  | [Explore](#archives)                       |\n| Passwords                                  | [Explore](#passwords)                       |\n| Emails                                  | [Explore](#emails)                       |\n| Nicknames                                  | [Explore](#nicknames)                       |\n\n\n\n\n## [](#table-of-contents) Table of contents\n- [Maps, Geolocation and Transport](#maps-geolocation-and-transport)\n    -
