You will need [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Following [Using Jekyll with Bundler](https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/using-jekyll-with-bundler/) to fullfill the enviromental requirement.\n\n2. Installed dependencies in the `Gemfile`:\n\n```sh\n$ bundle install \n```\n\n3. Serve the website (`localhost:4000` by default):\n\n```sh\n$ bundle exec jekyll serve  # alternatively, npm start\n```\n\n### Development (Build From Source)\n\nTo modify the theme, you will need [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/). There are numbers of tasks you can find in the `Gruntfile.js`, includes minifing JavaScript, compiling `.less` to `.css`, adding banners to keep the Apache 2.0 license intact, watching for changes, etc. \n\nYes, they were inherited and are extremely old-fashioned. There is no modularization and transpilation, etc.\n\nCritical Jekyll-related code are located in `_include/` and `_layouts/`. Most of them are [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki) templates.\n\nThis theme uses the default code syntax highlighter of jekyll, [Rouge](http://rouge.jneen.net/), which is compatible with Pygments theme so just pick any pygments theme css (e.g. from [here](http://jwarby.github.io/jekyll-pygments-themes/languages/javascript.html) and replace the content of `highlight.less`.\n\n\n### Interesting to know more? Checkout the [full user manual](_doc/Manual.md)!\n\n\nOther Resources\n---------------\n\nPorts\n- [**Hexo**](https://github.com/Kaijun/hexo-theme-huxblog) by @kaijun\n- [**React-SSR**](https://github.com/LucasIcarus/huxpro.github.io/tree/ssr) by @LucasIcarus\n\n[Starter/Boilerplate](https://github.com/huxpro/huxblog-boilerplate)\n- Out of date.
