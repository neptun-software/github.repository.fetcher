To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\n\n### Section 1 – Definitions.\n\na. __Adapted Material__ means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n\nb. __Adapter's License__ means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\nc. __Copyright and Similar Rights__ means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\nd. __Effective Technological Measures__ means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.\n\ne. __Exceptions and Limitations__ means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\nf. __Licensed Material__ means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.\n\ng. __Licensed Rights__ means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\n\nh. __Licensor__ means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.\n\ni. __NonCommercial__ means not primarily intended for or directed towards commercial advantage or monetary compensation. For purposes of this Public License, the exchange of the Licensed Material for other material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights by digital file-sharing or similar means is NonCommercial provided there is no payment of monetary compensation in connection with the exchange.\n\nj. __Share__ means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.\n\nk. __Sui Generis Database Rights__ means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\n\nl. __You__ means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\n\n### Section 2 – Scope.\n\na. ___License grant.___\n\n   1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\n       A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and\n\n       B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for NonCommercial purposes only.\n\n   2. __Exceptions and Limitations.__ For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.\n\n   3. __Term.__ The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).\n\n   4. __Media and formats; technical modifications allowed.__ The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n   5. __Downstream recipients.__\n\n        A. __Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material.__ Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n        B. __No downstream restrictions.__ You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.\n\n   6. __No endorsement.__ Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\nb. ___Other rights.___\n\n   1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n   2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.\n\n   3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial purposes.\n\n### Section 3 – License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.\n\na. ___Attribution.___\n\n   1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:\n\n       A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:\n\n         i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);\n\n         ii. a copyright notice;\n\n         iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n         iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;\n\n         v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;\n\n       B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n       C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n   2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.\n\n   3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.\n\n   4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n### Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\na. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes only;\n\nb. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\nc. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n### Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\na. __Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.__\n\nb. __To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.__\n\nc. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\n\n### Section 6 – Term and Termination.\n\na. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\n\nb. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n   1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\n\n   2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n   For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\n\nc. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\n\nd. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\n\n### Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.\n\na. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\nb. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n### Section 8 – Interpretation.\n\na. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\n\nb. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\n\nc. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\n\nd. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n"

我们的 bot 会在 [列表](https://github.com/javascript-tutorial/zh.javascript.info/issues/324#issue-433691990) 中勾选上对应的文章，这样其他人就知道你正在翻译该文章了。\n    - 不要在该评论中添加其他说明。\n    - 如果你发现有些文章索然已经被勾选，但是勾选人在认领任务后 15 天内未提交译文，此时你仍可以发表以该文章标题为内容的评论（并 @leviding），如 `An Introduction to JavaScript @leviding`。\n- Fork 此仓库并开始翻译。完成翻译后，请提交一个 PR（请在认领翻译后的 15 天内提交）。\n    - PR 应以文章标题命名。Bot 会自动补充更多信息。\n\n请给维护者时间来审核和 merge 你的翻译，或者提出对应的修改意见。\n\n如果你想成为一个维护者，请在 [给我们提新 issue](https://github.com/javascript-tutorial/zh.javascript.info/issues/new)。\n\n<!--\n如果维护者没能回复，或者你想成为一个维护者，请在 [主仓库给我们提新 issue](https://github.com/javascript-tutorial/en.javascript.info/issues/new)。\n-->\n\n**如果你愿意的话，请让其他人知道你在翻译这个教程，并尝试邀请他们参与翻译。你可以通过微博或群聊来号召。**\n\n🎉 非常感谢！\n\n目前中文版已上线，我们会在“[关于本项目](https://zh.javascript.info/about)”页面写上你的名字和贡献。\n\n注：<https://javascript.info/translate> 列出了完整的语言列表。\n\n\n## 文件结构\n\n每一个章节或任务都有它自己的文件夹。\n\n文件夹以 `N-url` 命名，`N` 为用于排序的数字，`url` 是该内容在网站上的链接中带有内容标题的部分。\n\n文件的类型是依据文件夹中的文件定义的：\n\n- `index.md` 对应一个章节，\n- `article.md` 对应一篇文章，\n- `task.md` 对应一个任务（对应的答案必须在 `solution.md` 文件中提供）。\n\n每一个文件都以 `# 一级标题` 开始。 \n\n添加新内容非常容易。\n\n\n## 翻译提示\n\n请不要添加换行，段落或移除已有的行和段落。这样可以减少 merge 英文版中的新变化时出现的问题。\n\n如果你觉得英文版可以被改善 —— 欢迎，请给 [英文版教程发 PR](https://github.com/javascript-tutorial/en.javascript.info/compare)。\n\n\n### 专有词条\n\n- 一些具体的专有词不应被翻译。如 “Function Declaration”。\n- 对于其他专有词，如 `resolved promise`、`slash` 和 `regexp` 等等，请先找找本项目 WIKI 中的[「英文－中文」术语对照表](https://github.com/javascript-tutorial/zh.javascript.info/wiki/%5B%E8%8B%B1%E6%96%87%EF%BC%8D%E4%B8%AD%E6%96%87%5D-%E6%9C%AF%E8%AF%AD%E5%AF%B9%E7%85%A7%E8%A1%A8) 中是否已有对应的词条。\n  - 若没有对应或近似的近似，则可以寻找其他教程（如：[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)）的翻译。\n\n**补充：**\n\n- 专有词条翻译完，在其后方以括号加英文的方式补上原词条，例如：同源政策（Same Origin Policy）或转义（transpile），等等。\n    - 若一篇文章出現两次以上相同专有词条，则在第一次之后补上原词条即可。\n- 若都无法找到对应的词条翻译，请直接留下原文词条。\n\n\n### 词条含义\n\n在英文中很多词条有明确的含义在內，但对于一个不了解英文的人来说，会忽略该含义。\n\n请谨记有必要时可以多加解释或增加额外的翻译，例如：\n\n```md\n`ReadableStream` objects allows to read data chunk-by-chunk.\n```\n\n```md\n`ReadableStream` objects 允许一个个资料块（chunk）地读取资料。\n```\n\n\n### 标点符号\n\n- 本教程标点符号格式采用 [此份指南](https://github.com/sparanoid/chinese-copywriting-guidelines)。\n- 资料链接、**粗体**，都须 [留下空白](https://github.com/sparanoid/chinese-copywriting-guidelines#%E9%8F%88%E6%8E%A5%E4%B9%8B%E9%96%93%E5%A2%9E%E5%8A%A0%E7%A9%BA%E6%A0%BC)。\n- 中文无斜体形式，英文的斜体翻译至中文改为 **加粗**。\n\n- 斜线号 `/` 较为特殊，若用于分隔两同类型词条时，请维持半形斜线且两侧不加空白，**但在词汇们整体的前后要留一空白做分隔：**\n    - `Increment/decrement can only be applied to variables.`：`递增/递减 只能被套用在变量上。`\n    - `If the result of increment/decrement is not used, ...`：`如果 递增/递减 的結果没被使用，...`\n\n- 英文一句话只能有一个逗号，但中文无此限制，可依据语气通顺程度将一些英文句点转为逗号。\n\n- 列举项目后的文字需加句号。<- 像这样\n\n\n### 代码块中的文本\n\n- 翻译注释。\n- 翻译展示给用户的信息和用来举例的字符串。\n- 不要翻译变量（variables）、类（classes）和标识符（identifiers）。\n- 确保翻译后的代码可以正常运行。 :)\n\n例：\n\n```js\n// Example\nconst text = \"Hello, world\";\ndocument.querySelector('.hello').innerHTML = text;\n```\n\n✅ 请这样翻译（翻译注解）：\n\n```js\n// 范例\nconst text = 'Hello, world';\ndocument.querySelector('.hello').innerHTML = text;\n```\n\n❌ 別翻译成（不要翻译类）：\n\n```js\n// 范例\nconst text = 'Hello, world';\n// \".hello\" 是一个类\n// 不要翻译\ndocument.querySelector('.你好').innerHTML = text;\n```\n\n\n### 外部链接\n\n**本翻译教程以维持原本外部链接为原则。**\n\n但如果这个外部链接是指向 Wikipedia 的，如 `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript`，并且其有质量优良的目标语言的译文，请将链接指向该译文。\n\n例如：\n\n```md\n[JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) is a programming language.\n```\n\n✅ OK (en -> zh):\n\n```md\n[JavaScript](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) 是一种编程语言。\n```\n\n对于指向 MDN 的外部链接，可以使用部分翻译的版本。\n\n如果外部链接没有翻译的版本，请不要修改该链接。\n\n\n### 诠释资料\n\n一些文件，通常是练习题，顶部会有 YAML 的诠释资料（Metadata）并以 `---` 分隔：\n\n```md\nimportance: 5\n\n---\n...\n```\n\n请不要翻译 “importance”（和其他放置在顶端的诠释资料）。\n\n### Anchors\n\n某些标题以 `[#anchor]` 结尾，如：\n\n```md\n## 扩散运算符 [#spread-operator]\n```\n\n请不要翻译或者去掉 `[#...]` 部分，它是 URL 锚点元素的依赖。 \n\n\n## 与英文版同步更新\n\n详见 WIKI 中的「[如何进行此教程的后续更新](https://github.com/javascript-tutorial/zh.javascript.info/wiki#%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E8%BF%9B%E8%A1%8C%E6%AD%A4%E6%95%99%E7%A8%8B%E7%9A%84%E5%90%8E%E7%BB%AD%E6%9B%B4%E6%96%B0)」。\n\n\n## 管理员注意事项\n\n详见 WIKI 中的「[管理员注意事项](https://github.com/javascript-tutorial/zh.javascript.info/wiki#%E7%AE%A1%E7%90%86%E5%91%98%E6%B3%A8%E6%84%8F%E4%BA%8B%E9%A1%B9)」。\n\n\n## 更多\n\n更多说明请见 [WIKI](https://github.com/javascript-tutorial/zh.javascript.info/wiki)。\n\n\n## 在本地运行\n\n你可以在本地运行本教程的服务端来预览你的翻译。\n\n运行服务端的教程请见 <https://github.com/javascript-tutorial/server>。 \n\n---\n\n本中文版教程的核心维护者 🚀\n\n- LeviDing [@leviding](https://github.com/leviding)\n- Martin [@MartinsYong](https://github.com/MartinsYong)\n- Bemself [bemself](https://github.com/bemself)\n- LycheeEng [@lycheeEng](https://github.com/lycheeEng)\n\n我们希望与大家合作维护本教程。本教程的详细贡献者列表请见：<https://zh.javascript.info/about>。\n"
