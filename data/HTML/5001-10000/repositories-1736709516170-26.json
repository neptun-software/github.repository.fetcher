          "content": "# HTML Standard contributor guidelines\n\nThese are the guidelines for contributing to the HTML Standard. First see the [WHATWG contributor guidelines](https://github.com/whatwg/meta/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nThe HTML Standard is quite complex and people notice minor and larger issues with it all the time. We'd love your help fixing these. Pull requests for typographical and grammar errors are also most welcome.\n\nWe label [good first issues](https://github.com/whatwg/html/labels/good%20first%20issue) that you could help us fix, to get a taste for how to submit pull requests, how the build process works, and so on.\n\nWe'd be happy to mentor you through this process. If you're interested and need help getting started, leave a comment on the issue or bug, or [ask around](https://whatwg.org/chat). The [FAQ](FAQ.md) may also be helpful.\n\n## Pull requests\n\nIn short, change `source` and submit your patch, with a [good commit message](https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/Writing-good-commit-messages). Try to follow the source formatting rules below.\n\nNote that `source` is written in [Wattsi Syntax](https://github.com/whatwg/wattsi/blob/main/Syntax.md), a dialect of HTML, which is eventually compiled into the deployed standard by a tool called [Wattsi](https://github.com/whatwg/wattsi).\n\nPlease add your name to the Acknowledgments section (search for `<!-- ACKS`) in your first pull request, even for trivial fixes. The names are sorted lexicographically.\n\nTo preview your changes locally, follow the instructions in the [html-build repository](https://github.com/whatwg/html-build).\n\n## The developer's edition\n\nIn addition to generating the [singlepage](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/) and [multipage](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/) specifications, we also generate an [edition for developers](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/dev/). This is meant to exclude content that is of interest only to implementers. We can always use community help in properly enforcing this distinction, especially since for a long period the developer's edition was not working and so we made a lot of changes without properly considering their impact on it.\n\nTo mark an element as being omitted from the developer's edition, use a `w-nodev` attribute. To only include it in the developer's edition, use a `w-dev` attribute. This may require introducing container `<div>`s or `<span>`s; that's fine. Note that Web IDL blocks (`<pre class=\"idl\">`) are automatically omitted by the build process, and so don't need `w-nodev` attributes. (There also exist `w-nohtml`, `w-nosnap`, and `w-noreview` attributes which exclude information from the Living Standard, the Commit Snapshot, and the Review Draft respectively. Day-to-day changes will not require them.)\n\nAnother interesting feature is the `subdfn` attribute. This is useful for when something is defined inside text that is not present in the developer's edition (such as a Web IDL block). In that case, we can use the `subdfn` attribute on something which has a matching `data-x` attribute, to indicate the definition of the term for the purposes of the developer's edition.\n\nIn general we want to omit from the developer's edition:\n\n* Any Web IDL; instead, the `<dl class=\"domintro\">` descriptions suffice.\n* The definitions of IDL attributes and operations as algorithmic steps (ditto).\n* Other instructions for user agents on how to implement a feature.\n* Definitions of low-level concepts and terms that do not impact web development.\n\nOn the other hand, we want to especially keep:\n\n* High-level descriptions and introductions.\n* Authoring instructions.\n* Examples.\n* Helpful notes about common situations.\n\nIn between these clear-cut categories, there is some gray area. Please feel free to open an issue if you think something is being included that shouldn't be, or is being excluded but should be kept.\n\n## Style guide\n\nThe HTML Standard generally follows style conventions listed in the [Infra Standard](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org) and the [WHATWG style guide](https://whatwg.org/style-guide). Additionally, the HTML Standard follows some specific style conventions not captured by those documents, that we enumerate below.\n\nDue to the long legacy of the existing text, these guidelines are not always applied. We do require that you apply the guidelines when making changes, though we are happy to provide assistance if this proves to be a blocker to you.\n\n### Source formatting\n\n\n#### Line wrapping length\n\nUse a column width of 100 characters and add newlines where whitespace is used. (Emacs, set `fill-column` to `100`; in Vim, set `textwidth` to `100`; and in Sublime, set `wrap_width` to `100`. Alternatively, wrap the paragraph(s) with your changes with https://domenic.github.io/rewrapper/. Make sure that `column length to rewrap` is set to 100.)\n\n#### Wrapping opportunities\n\nUsing newlines between \"inline\" element tag names and their content is forbidden. (This actually alters the content, by adding spaces.) That is,\n```html\n   <dd><span>Parse error</span>. Create a new DOCTYPE token. Set its <i data-x=\"force-quirks\n   flag\">force-quirks flag</i> to …\n```\nis fine and\n```html\n   <dd><span>Parse error</span>. Create a new DOCTYPE token. Set its <i data-x=\"force-quirks flag\">\n   force-quirks flag</i> to …\n```\nis not.\n\nUsing newlines between attributes and inside attribute values that contain whitespace is allowed. Always wrap after putting the maximum number of characters on a single line within these guidelines.\n\n```html\n  <p>A <code>base</code> element that is the first <code>base</code> element with an <code\n  data-x=\"attr-base-href\">href</code> content attribute <span>in a document tree</span> has a\n```\n\n### Element hierarchy\n\nAn `<li>` element always has a `<p>` element inside it, unless it's a child of `<ul class=\"brief\">`.\n\nList items (`<li>`, `<dt>`, and `<dd>`) always start on their own line with a newline between them\nand the previous list item. No extra newline at the start or end of the list though:\n```html\n <ol>\n  <li><p>Let <var>x</var> be 1.</p></li>\n\n  <li><p>Increment <var>x</var> by 2.</p></li>\n </ol>\n```\n\nIf a \"block\" element contains a single \"block\" element, do not put it on a new line.\n\nDo not indent for anything except a new \"block\" element. For instance\n```html\n   <li><p>Let <var>corsAttributeState</var> be the current state of the element's <code\n   data-x=\"attr-link-crossorigin\">crossorigin</code> content attribute.</p></li>\n```\nis not indented, but\n```html\n      <li>\n       <p>For each <var>element</var> in <var>candidate elements</var>, run the following\n       substeps:</p>\n\n       <ol>\n```\nis.\n\nEnd tags must not be omitted (except where it is consistent to do so) and attribute values must be quoted (use double quotes).\n\n### Common mistakes around prose style\n\nMost of the style conventions in this section are covered by Infra or the WHATWG style guide, but the editors often have to correct them in contributions anyway.\n\n - Use the [algorithm declaration conventions](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#algorithm-declaration) in the Infra Standard.\n - **\"If foo, then bar\"** instead of \"If foo, bar\". [Example](https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/10269#discussion_r1568114777).\n - **\"Abort these steps\" vs \"return\"**: Use \"return\" to exit a whole algorithm or method. Use \"abort these steps\" to terminate a set of substeps or [in parallel](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/C#in-parallel) steps and continue at the next step in the \"outer\" procedure. See examples in [this section on parallelism](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/C#parallelism) and elsewhere throughout the spec, as well as https://github.com/whatwg/infra/issues/258.\n - **Usage of positional, optional, and named[^1] (i.e., linkable) parameters**. Follow the [algorithm parameter conventions](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#algorithm-params) in the Infra Standard. In particular, use named/linkable optional parameters in your algorithm declaration when callsites pass in values for them while omitting earlier-positioned optional parameters.\n - When **nesting 3+ conditions** in a list, the style should look like so:\n   ```html\n     <li><p>Foo.</p></li>\n\n     <li>\n      <p>If (all|any) of the following are true:</p>\n      \n      <ul class=\"brief\">\n       <li><p>condition 1;</p></li>\n\n       <li><p>condition 2;</p></li>\n\n       <li><p>condition 3; (and|or)</p></li>\n\n       <li><p>condition 4,</p></li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p>then…</p>\n     </li>\n     \n     <li><p>Baz.</p></li>\n   ```\n - **Conjugate algorithm invocations inline** so they read more naturally in English, instead of more procedurally. For [example](https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/9778#discussion_r1574075112), use `the result of <span data-x=\"get the popcorn\">getting the popcorn</span>` instead of `the result of running <span>get the popcorn</span>`.\n - Prefer American English to British English; see the [WHATWG style guide](https://whatwg.org/style-guide).\n\n[^1]: For example, see parameters like https://html.spec.whatwg.org/C#navigation-referrer-policy, which are named/linkable parameters in an algorithm's declaration.\n"

          "content": "# HTML Standard FAQ\n\n_See also the [WHATWG FAQ](https://whatwg.org/faq)._\n\n## HTML\n\n### What is HTML?\n\n[HTML](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/) is the core foundational standard being worked on by the WHATWG community. It is continuously maintained and supersedes HTML4, XHTML1, DOM Level 2 HTML, and all previous HTML specifications — addressing many of the shortcomings of those specifications while at the same time enhancing HTML to more adequately cover the needs of web applications. Along with defining the HTML markup language, it also defines many of the core requirements that form the basis of the web runtime.\n\n### What is HTML5?\n\nGoing forward, the WHATWG is just working on \"HTML\", without worrying about version numbers. When people talk about \"HTML5\" in the context of the WHATWG, they usually mean just \"the latest work on HTML\", not necessarily a specific version. For more details, see the section called \"[Is this HTML5?](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/introduction.html#is-this-html5?)\" in the standard.\n\n### How do I validate my pages?\n\nUse a [validator](https://whatwg.org/validator/).\n\n### What parts of the standard are stable?\n\nThe whole standard is more or less stable. There are some parts of it that describe new technologies that have not yet been implemented everywhere, but at this point those additions are only added after the design itself is pretty stable. Such additions must also have the support of two or more implementers, [per our working mode](https://whatwg.org/working-mode#additions).\n\n### Why are there no stable snapshots, or versions, of the standard?\n\nIn practice, implementations all follow the latest standard anyway, not so-called \"finished\" snapshots. The problem with following a snapshot is that you end up following something that is _known to be wrong_. That's obviously not the way to get interoperability!\n\nThis has in fact been a real problem at the W3C, where mistakes are found and fixed in the editors' drafts of specifications, but implementers who aren't fully engaged in the process go and implement obsolete snapshots instead, including those bugs. This has resulted in serious differences between browsers.\n\nFor more information on this, see the WHATWG FAQ entry [What does \"Living Standard\" mean?](https://whatwg.org/faq#living-standard).\n\n### Will future browsers have any idea what older HTML documents mean?\n\nBrowsers do not implement HTML+, HTML2, HTML3.2, HTML4, HTML4.01, etc, as separate versions. They all just have a single implementation that covers all these versions at once. That is what the HTML Standard defines: how to write a browser (or other implementation) that handles _all previous versions of HTML_, as well as all the latest features.\n\nOne of the main goals of the HTML Standard and the WHATWG effort as a whole is to make it possible for archeologists hundreds of years from now to write a browser and view HTML content, regardless of when it was written. Making sure that we handle all documents is one of our most important goals. Not having versions does not preclude this; indeed it makes it significantly easier.\n\n### How are developers to determine when certain parts of their pages will become invalid?\n\nIt shouldn't matter if and when old pages become invalid.\n\nValidity (more often referred to as document conformance in the WHATWG) is a quality assurance tool to help authors avoid mistakes. We don't make things non-conforming (invalid) for the sake of it, we use conformance as a guide for developers to help them avoid bad practices or mistakes (like typos). So there's not really any need to worry about whether old pages are conforming or not. It's only helpful when you're writing a new page, and it's always most helpful to have the latest advice. It wouldn't be useful to check for conformance against last week's rules, for instance. After all, we fixed mistakes in those rules this week! For more details, see [part of the introduction](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/introduction.html#conformance-requirements-for-authors) of the standard.\n\n### How can I keep track of changes to the standard?\n\nThere are a number of ways to track changes to the standard:\n\n* The Twitter feed: [@htmlstandard](https://twitter.com/htmlstandard)\n* The [GitHub commits log](https://github.com/whatwg/html/commits)\n* The standard is available in the [Git repository](https://github.com/whatwg/html/). You may use any Git client to check out the latest version and use your client's diff tools to compare revisions and see what has been changed.\n\n### What are the various versions of the HTML Standard?\n\nThe HTML Standard is available in three forms: [single-page](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/) (_very large_), [multi-page](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/), and the [developer's edition](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/dev/).\n\nThe W3C used to publish some [forked versions](https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Fork_tracking) of the HTML Standard. They are no longer maintained and now redirect to the HTML Standard. If you spot any others please open an issue on [w3c/whatwg-coord](https://github.com/w3c/whatwg-coord/issues/) so the W3C staff can work to get them redirected.\n\n### How do I know if a particular feature in the standard is ready to use?\n\nHere are some sites to help you work out what you can use:\n\n* https://caniuse.com/\n* https://developer.mozilla.org/\n\nThe following sites also have some useful information:\n\n* https://html5doctor.com/\n* https://diveintohtml5.info/\n\nIf you know of any more (or if you have some yourself) then send a pull request to add them to the list! (Or, if you think any of the above have lost usefulness over time, send a pull request removing them and outlining your reasoning.)\n\n### When will HTML5 be finished?\n\nThe WHATWG is now using a Living Standard development model, so this question is no longer really pertinent. See above, under \"[What is HTML5?](#what-is-html5)\". The real question is, when can you use new features? For an answer to that question, see \"[How do I know if a particular feature in the spec is ready to use?](#how-do-i-know-if-a-particular-feature-in-the-standard-is-ready-to-use)\".\n\n### What's this I hear about 2022?\n\nBack before the Living Standard development model, we were planning to put the contents of the HTML Standard through the W3C process. This was before we understood the fatal flaws of such a snapshot-based development mode.\n\nAt the time, the W3C Recommendation label had high standards, such as 100% test coverage of two complete and fully interoperable implementations. In 2008, the editor estimated it would take another 14 years to reach that point, based on comparing it to the amount of work done for HTML4 and other large specifications like CSS2/2.1.\n\nSince then, we've realized that much like the [waterfall model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model) is not a good fit for software development, it is also not a good way of developing standards. These days we keep the HTML Standard continually under development, adding tests as we go and verifying them against implementations, [per our working mode](https://whatwg.org/working-mode). So, the year 2022 is no longer relevant.\n\n### Is design rationale documented?\n\nSort of. Often some record of the rationale for a particular design choice can be found within discussions in the GitHub issue tracker, commit logs, or the mailing-list archive or [Chat archives](https://whatwg.org/chat#logs). Sometimes, there is an explanation in the specification, but doing that everywhere would make the specification huge.\n\nFor a few cases that someone did take the time document, the information can be found at the following locations:\n\n* [Rationale](https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Rationale) — a page that documents some reasons behind decisions in the spec, originally written and maintained by Variable. If anyone wants to help him out, try to find someone via [Chat](https://whatwg.org/chat); we're always looking for more contributors and this is a good place to start.\n* [Why no namespaces](https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Why_no_namespaces)\n* [Why no script implements](https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Why_no_script_implements)\n* [Why not reuse legend](https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Why_not_reuse_legend) or another _mini-header_ element.\n\nAlso see [HTML feature proposals](#html-feature-proposals).\n\n## HTML syntax issues\n\n### Does HTML finally put an end to the XHTML as `text/html` debate?\n\nYes. Unlike HTML4 and XHTML1, the choice of HTML or \"XHTML\" is solely dependent upon the choice of the media type, rather than the DOCTYPE. See [HTML vs. XHTML](https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/HTML_vs._XHTML)\n\n### What is the DOCTYPE for modern HTML documents?\n\nIn `text/html` documents:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n```\n\nIn documents delivered with an XML media type: no DOCTYPE is required and its use is generally unnecessary. However, you may use one if you want (see the following question). Note that the above is well-formed XML.\n\nFor compatibility with legacy producers designed for outputting HTML, but which are unable to easily output the above DOCTYPE, this alternative legacy-compat version may be used instead.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html SYSTEM \"about:legacy-compat\">\n```\n\nNote that this is _not_ intended for dealing with any compatibility issues with legacy browsers. It is meant for legacy authoring tools only.\n\nExcluding the string `\"about:legacy-compat\"`, the DOCTYPE is case insensitive in `text/html`. In documents delivered with an XML media type, it is case sensitive and must be either of the two variants given above. For this reason, the DOCTYPEs given above are recommended to be used over other case variants, such as `<!DOCTYPE HTML>` or `<!doctype html>`.\n\nThese alternatives were chosen because they meet the following criteria:\n\n* They trigger standards mode in all current and all relevant legacy browsers.\n* They are well-formed in XML.\n* It is possible to output at least one of the alternatives, if not both, with extant markup generators.\n* They intentionally contain no language version identifier so the DOCTYPE will remain usable for all future revisions of HTML.\n* The first is short and memorable to encourage its use.\n* The legacy-compat DOCTYPE is intentionally unattractive and self descriptive of purpose to discourage unnecessary use.\n\n### Under what conditions should a DOCTYPE be used in a document delivered with an XML media type?\n\nGenerally, the use of a DOCTYPE in a document delivered with an XML media type is unnecessary. However, there are cases where inclusion of a DOCTYPE is a reasonable thing to do:\n\n1. The document is intended to be a polyglot document such that the same text may be treated as either HTML or XML.\n2. You wish to declare entity references for use within the document. Note that most browsers only read the internal subset and do not retrieve external entities. (This is not compatible with HTML, and thus not suitable for polyglot documents.)\n3. You wish to use a custom DTD for DTD-based validation. But take note of [what's wrong with DTDs](https://about.validator.nu/#faq).\n\nFundamentally, this is an XML issue, and is not specific to HTML documents delivered with an XML media type.\n\n### How are documents from HTML4 and earlier versions parsed?\n\nAll documents with a `text/html` media type (that is, including those without or with an HTML 2.0, HTML 3.2, HTML4, or XHTML1 DOCTYPE) will be parsed using the same parser algorithm as defined by the HTML spec. This matches what web browsers have done for HTML documents so far and keeps code complexity down. That in turn is good for security, maintainability, and in general keeping the amount of bugs down. The HTML syntax as now defined therefore does not require a per-version parser, and documents with an HTML4 DOCTYPE for example will be parsed as described by the HTML specification.\n\nValidators are allowed to have different code paths for previous levels of HTML.\n\n### If there is no DTD, how can I validate my page?\n\nWith an [HTML validator](https://whatwg.org/validator/) that follows the latest specification.\n\n### What is an \"HTML serialization\"?\n\nThe HTML serialization refers to the syntax of an HTML document defined in the HTML specification. The syntax is inspired by the SGML syntax from earlier versions of HTML, bits of XML (e.g. allowing a trailing slash on void elements, `xmlns` attributes), and reality of deployed content on the web.\n\nAny document whose media type is determined to be `text/html` is considered to be an HTML serialization and must be parsed using an HTML parser.\n\n### What is an XML (or XHTML) serialization?\n\nThe XML serialization refers to the syntax defined by XML 1.0 and Namespaces in XML 1.0. A resource that has an XML media type, such as `application/xhtml+xml` or `application/xml`, is an XML document. XML documents whose root element is `<html>` in the HTML namespace are sometimes referred to as \"XHTML\" documents.\n\n### What media (MIME) type does HTML use?\n\nThe HTML serialization _must_ be served using the `text/html` media type.\n\nThe XML serialization _must_ be served using an XML media type, such as `application/xhtml+xml` or `application/xml`. Unlike the situation as of XHTML1, the HTML specification requires that \"XHTML\" documents not be served with the `text/html` media type.\n\nUsing the incorrect media type (`text/html`) for a document in the XML serialization will cause the document to be parsed according to parsing requirements for HTML. In other words, it will be treated as what's sometimes called \"tag soup\". Ensuring the use of an XML media type is the only way to ensure that browsers handle the document as XML.\n\n### Should I close empty elements with `/>` or `>`?\n\nVoid elements in HTML (e.g. the `<br>`, `<img>` and `<input>` elements) do not require a trailing slash. e.g. Instead of writing `<br />`, you only need to write `<br>`. This is the same as in HTML4. However, due to the widespread attempts to use XHTML1, there are a significant number of pages using the trailing slash. Because of this, the trailing slash syntax has been permitted on void elements in HTML in order to ease migration from XHTML1 back to HTML.\n\nThe current HTML specification also introduces the ability to embed MathML elements. On elements inside a `math` element, the trailing slash works just like it does in XML; that is, it closes the element. This is only inside that context however; it does not work for normal HTML elements.\n\n### If I'm careful with the syntax I use in my HTML document, can I process it with an XML parser?\n\nYou have to be _really_ careful for this to work, and it's almost certainly not worth it. You'd be better off just using an HTML-to-XML parser. That way you can just use HTML normally while still using XML pipeline tools.\n\n[HTML vs. XHTML](https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/HTML_vs._XHTML#Differences_Between_HTML_and_XHTML) has some related guidance.\n\n### What is the namespace declaration?\n\nIn the XML syntax, you are required to specify the namespace:\n\n```html\n<html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n```\n\nIn `text/html` documents, the `xmlns` attribute is currently allowed on any HTML element, but only if it has the value `http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml`. It doesn't do anything at all; it is merely allowed for the purpose of easing migration from XHTML1. It is not actually a namespace declaration in HTML, because HTML doesn't support namespaces. See the question \"[What about namespaces in HTML?](#what-about-namespaces-in-html)\".\n\n### What about namespaces in HTML?\n\nHTML is defined in terms of the DOM and during parsing of a `text/html` document, all HTML elements are automatically put in the HTML namespace, `http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml`. However, unlike the XML serialization, there is no real namespace syntax available in the HTML serialization (see previous question). In other words, you do not need to declare the namespace in your HTML markup, as you do in XHTML.\n\nIn addition, the HTML syntax provides for a way to embed elements from MathML and SVG. Elements placed inside the container element `math` or `svg` will automatically be put in the MathML namespace or the SVG namespace, respectively, by the parser. Namespace syntax is not required, but again an `xmlns` attribute is allowed if its value is the right namespace.\n\nIn conclusion, while HTML does not allow the XML namespace syntax, there is a way to embed MathML and SVG and the `xmlns` attribute can be used on any element under the given constraints, in a way that is reasonably compatible on the DOM level.\n\n### How do I specify the character encoding?\n\nRegardless of whether documents are delivered as `text/html` or with an XML media type, UTF-8 is the only conformant character encoding.\n\nFor HTML, it is strongly recommended that you specify the encoding using the HTTP `Content-Type` header. If you are unable to [configure your server](https://www.w3.org/International/articles/http-charset/) to send the correct headers, then you may use the `<meta>` element:\n\n```html\n<meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n```\n\nIn addition, the following restrictions apply:\n\n* The character encoding name given must be the name of the character encoding used to serialize the file.\n* The character encoding declaration must be serialized without the use of character references or character escapes of any kind.\n* The `<meta>` element used for this purpose must occur within the first 512 bytes of the file. It is considered good practice for this to be the first child of the `<head>` element so that it is as close to the beginning of the file as possible.\n\nNote that this `<meta>` element is different from HTML4, though it is compatible with many browsers because of the way encoding detection has been implemented.\n\nTo ease transition from HTML4 to the current HTML specification, although the former is the recommended syntax, you may also use the following. (This does not apply to documents in the XML syntax):\n\n```html\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\">\n```\n\nIn documents delivered with an XML media type, XML rules for determining the character encoding declaration apply. The `<meta>` element is never used for determining the encoding of such documents; for those, you should use either the HTTP `Content-Type` header or the XML declaration to specify the encoding.\n\n```html\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n```\n\nHowever, because documents which do not have an XML declaration that explicitly specifies an encoding are processed as UTF-8, it's not necessary for conforming documents to include an XML declaration to specify the encoding.\n\n### What are the differences between HTML and XHTML?\n\nSee the list of [differences between HTML and XHTML](https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/HTML_vs._XHTML#Differences_Between_HTML_and_XHTML) in the wiki.\n\n### What are best practices to be compatible with HTML DOM and XML DOM?\n\nThough the intent is that documents delivered with a `text/html` media type and that documents delivered with an XML media type can both produce identical DOMs, there still are some differences between working with an HTML DOM and an XML DOM.\n\nCase sensitivity:\n\n* Whenever possible, avoid testing `element.tagName` and `node.nodeName` (or do `toLowerCase()` before testing).\n\nNamespaces:\n\n* Use the namespace-aware version for creating elements: `document.createElementNS(ns, elementName)`.\n\n### Why does the HTML Standard legitimize tag soup?\n\nActually it doesn't. This is a misconception that comes from the confusion between conformance requirements for documents, and the requirements for user agents.\n\nDue to the fundamental design principle of supporting existing content, the spec must define how to handle all HTML, regardless of whether documents are conforming or not. Therefore, the spec defines precisely how to handle and recover from erroneous markup, much of which would be considered \"tag soup\".\n\nFor example, the spec defines algorithms for dealing with syntax errors such as incorrectly-nested tags, which will ensure that a well-structured DOM tree can be produced. Defining that is essential for achieving interoperability between browsers and reducing the dependence upon browsers needing to reverse engineer each other's parsing behavior.\n\nHowever, the conformance requirements for authors are defined separately from the processing requirements. Just because browsers are required to handle erroneous content, it does not make such markup conforming.\n\nFor example, user agents are required to support processing of the `<marquee>` element, but authors must not use the `<marquee>` element in conforming documents.\n\nIt is important to make the distinction between the rules that apply to user agents and the rules that apply to authors for producing conforming documents. They are completely orthogonal.\n\n## HTML feature proposals\n\n### HTML should support `href` on any element!\n\nThe spec allows `<a>` to contain blocks. It doesn't support putting `href=\"\"` on any element, though.\n\nSupporting `href` on any element has several problems associated with it that make it difficult to support in HTML. The main reason this isn't in HTML is that browser vendors have reported that implementing it would be extremely complex. Browser vendors get to decide what they implement, and there's no point to us telling them to do something they aren't going to do. In addition:\n\n* It isn't backwards compatible with existing browsers.\n* It adds no new functionality that can't already be achieved using the `a` element and a little script.\n* It doesn't make sense for all elements, such as interactive elements like `input` and `button`, where the use of href would interfere with their normal function.\n\nThe only advantage it seems to add is that it reduces typing for authors in some cases, but that is not a strong enough reason to support it in light of the other reasons.\n\nWrapping `<a>` elements around blocks solves most use cases. It doesn't handle making rows in tables into links, though; for those just do something like this instead:\n\n```html\n<tr onclick=\"location = this.getElementsByTagName('a')[0]\"> ... </tr>\n```\n\n### HTML should support list headers!\n\nYou can give a header to a list using the `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` elements:\n\n```html\n<figure>\n <figcaption>Apples</figcaption>\n <ul>\n  <li>Granny Smith</li>\n  <li>Evil Apple of Knowledge</li>\n  <li>Apple, Inc</li>\n </ul>\n</figure>\n```\n\nYou can also label a group of lists using a definition list:\n\n```html\n<dl>\n <dt>Dry:</dt>\n <dd>\n  <ul>\n   <li>1c flour</li>\n   <li>1/4c sugar</li>\n   <li>1tsp baking soda</li>\n  </ul>\n </dd>\n <dt>Wet:</dt>\n <dd>\n  <ul>\n   <li>1 egg </li>\n   <li>1/2c milk</li>\n   <li>1tsp vanilla extract</li>\n  </ul>\n </dd>\n</dl>\n```\n\nThese techniques are preferred over adding an `<lh>` element as proposed in the old HTML3 draft, mostly because of thorny issues with parsing near `<li>` elements.\n\n### HTML should support a way for anyone to invent new elements!\n\nIt does. You can use [custom elements](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html) to build your own fully-featured DOM elements.\n\nShort of that, there are actually quite a number of ways for people to invent their own extensions to HTML:\n\n* Authors can use the `class` attribute to extend elements, effectively creating their own elements, while using the most applicable existing \"real\" HTML element, so that browsers and other tools that don't know of the extension can still support it somewhat well. This is the tack used by Microformats, for example.\n* Authors can include data for scripts to process using the `data-*=\"\"` attributes. These are guaranteed to never be touched by browsers, and allow scripts to include data on HTML elements that scripts can then look for and process.\n* Authors can use the `<meta name=\"\" content=\"\">` mechanism to include page-wide metadata. Names should be registered on the wiki's [MetaExtensions](https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/MetaExtensions) page.\n* Authors can use the `rel=\"\"` mechanism to annotate links with specific meanings. This is also used by Microformats. Names should be registered on the wiki's [RelExtensions](https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/RelExtensions) page.\n* Authors can embed raw data using the `<script type=\"\">` mechanism with a custom type, for further handling by a script.\n* Authors can create plugins and invoke them using the `<embed>` element. This is how Flash works.\n* Authors can extend APIs using the JS prototyping mechanism. This is widely used by script libraries, for instance.\n* Authors can use the microdata feature (the `item=\"\"` and `itemprop=\"\"` attributes) to embed nested name-value pairs of data to be shared with other applications and sites.\n* Authors can propose new elements and attributes and, if the wider community and user-agent vendors agree that they are worth the effort, they can be added to the language.\n\n### HTML should group `<dt>`s and `<dd>`s together in `<di>`s!\n\nHTML allows `<div>` as a grouping element in `<dl>`. See [the `<dl>` specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/#the-dl-element) and [issue #1937](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/1937) wherein this was added.\n\n### HTML should add more named character references!\n\nAlthough this would be convenient, the overall conclusion of the editors and of browser engine implementers is that expanding the [named character references](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/named-characters.html#named-character-references) list is not worth the cost to the ecosystem:\n\n* The backward-compatibility characteristics of such additions are bad. They do not add new capabilities, since you can already use numeric character references or unescaped code points; they just introduce new ways of writing the same thing, which will fail to display correctly in older browsers.\n\n* The benefits of such features can also be accomplished by preprocessor languages directly. That is, preprocessed languages that compile to HTML, such as Markdown, wiki syntax, JSX, or server-side templating systems, can add these capabilities themselves. The only reason to add these to the browser is to help people writing raw HTML. We do want to support people writing raw HTML, but features for that audience are less impactful than general web platform features, which weighs into the overall decision as to whether to add them or not.\n\n* Most importantly, [the HTML parser is security sensitive](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/919#issuecomment-276329905). Any changes in it can cause mismatches between markup producers and markup consumers until everyone is updated to the latest version, which can lead to security bugs. This means that changes to the parser have to add an extreme amount of value to the ecosystem, to overcome this security hazard. Per the above points, our judgment is that adding or modifying named character references does not meet this bar.\n\n### Where's the harm in adding...?\n\nEvery feature we add to the web platform has a cost:\n\n* Implementation: someone has to write code for it in each browser\n* Testing: someone has to write the tests to check the features is working\n* QA: someone has to regularly run the tests to make sure the feature doesn't regress\n* Code maintenance: when browser vendors refactor code, they have to refactor more code if there's more features\n* Tutorials: people who write tutorials have to include the feature, or handle feedback asking for them to do so\n* Cognitive load: authors learning the platform have more documentation to wade through even if they don't care about the feature\n* [Extra features discourage exploration](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/stagnating-expertise/): Having more features means less overall feature usage.\n* Page maintenance: authors have to know how to maintain the feature if other people have used it in pages they now maintain\n* Spec writing: someone has to write the spec for the feature and ensure it's maintained\n* Bug fixing: when bugs are found in the spec or implementations, someone has to figure out a fix, implement it, test it, ship it, tests have to be fixed, documentation has to be updated, etc\n* Code size: each feature increases the size of browsers (both on-disk binaries and in-memory resident size)\n\n## Using HTML\n\n### Why are some presentational elements like `<b>`, `<i>` and `<small>` still included?\n\nThe inclusion of those elements is a largely pragmatic decision based upon their widespread usage, and their utility for cases which are not covered by more-specific elements.\n\nWhile there are a number of common use cases for italics which are covered by more-specific elements, such as emphasis (`<em>`), citations (`<cite>`), definitions (`<dfn>`) and variables (`<var>`), there are many other use cases which are not covered well by these elements. For example: a taxonomic designation, a technical term, an idiomatic phrase from another language, a thought, or a ship name.\n\nSimilarly, although a number of common use cases for bold text are also covered by more-specific elements, such as strong emphasis (`<strong>`), headings (`<h1>`-`<h6>`) or table headers (`<th>`), there are others which are not, such as keywords in a document abstract or product names in a review.\n\nSome people argue that in such cases, the `<span>` element should be used with an appropriate class name and associated stylesheet. However, the `<b>` and `<i>` elements provide for a reasonable fallback styling in environments that don't support stylesheets or which do not render visually, such as screen readers, and they also provide some indication that the text is somehow distinct from its surrounding content.\n\nIn essence, the `<i>` and `<b>` elements convey distinct, though non-specific, semantics, which are to be determined by the reader in the context of their use. In other words, although they don't convey specific semantics by themselves, but instead they indicate that the content is somehow semantically distinct from its surroundings — leaving the interpretation of the semantics up to the reader.\n\nThis is further explained in the article [The `<b>` and `<i>` Elements](https://lachy.id.au/log/2007/05/b-and-i).\n\nSimilarly, the `<small>` element is defined for content that is commonly typographically rendered in small print, and which is often referred to as \"fine print\"; that could include copyright statements, disclaimers and other legal text commonly found at the end of a document.\n\n#### But they are PRESENTATIONAL!\n\nThe problem with elements like `<font>` isn't that they are _presentational_ per se, it's that they are media-dependent (they apply to visual browsers but not to speech browsers). While `<b>`, `<i>` and `<small>` historically have been presentational, they are defined in a media-independent manner in HTML5. For example, `<small>` corresponds to the really quickly spoken part at the end of radio advertisements.\n\n### Why is the `<cite>` element only used to mark up titles, not names of people or other citations?\n\nFrom what some have seen, `<cite>` is almost always used to mean \"italics\". More careful authors have used the element to mark up names and titles, and some people have gone out of their way to only mark up citations.\n\nSo, we can't really decide what the element should be based on past practice, like we usually do.\n\nThis leaves the question of what is the most useful use we can put the element to, if we keep it. The conclusion so far has been that the most useful use for `<cite>` is as an element to allow typographic control over titles, since those are often made italics, and that semantic is roughly close to what it meant in previous versions, and happens to match at least one of the common uses for the element. Generally, however, names and titles aren't typeset the same way, so making the element apply to both would lead to confusing typography.\n\nThere are already many ways of marking up names already (e.g. the [hCard microformat](https://microformats.org/wiki/hcard), the microdata vCard vocabulary, `<span>` and class names, etc), if you really need it.\n\n### Do you have any hints on how to use `<section>` and `<article>` and so on?\n\nSome hopefully helpful hints:\n\n* One way to look at it is how would you draw the page outline/table-of-contents? Each entry in the table of contents should be a `<section>`/`<article>`/`<aside>`/`<nav>`, and if it's not in the table of contents and doesn't have a heading, it should probably not be a `<section>`/`<article>`/`<aside>`/`<nav>`.\n* You can still use `<div>`. It's the right element if you need a styling hook because CSS can't give you enough to do what you want.\n* Generally, `<section>`s should start with a heading element containing the section title. It's not a hard-and-fast rule, but if you find yourself in a situation where a heading would be inappropriate, you probably want `<div>` rather than `<section>`.\n* Sections can contain articles, and vice versa. e.g. you can have a section that is news, a section that is editorials, a section that is sports, each with many articles, and each of those can have subsections, and each section can have comments, which are marked up using `<article>`, and each comment could be big enough that it has separate `<section>`s, and so on.\n\n## WHATWG and the W3C HTML WG\n\n### Are there plans to merge the groups?\n\nNo. The two groups have different goals. The WHATWG develops the standard. The W3C HTML WG's goal is to endorse the WHATWG [HTML Review Drafts](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/review-drafts/) as W3C Recommendations. You can learn more about this in the [Memorandum of Understanding](https://www.w3.org/2019/04/WHATWG-W3C-MOU.html) that outlines the process.\n\nOn the WHATWG side, the editors accept feedback from all participants and organizations, including those from other standards bodies like the W3C or Ecma, via our GitHub issue tracker. (In particular, the editors do not look at the source of technical arguments when attempting to determine what path to take on an issue or other.)\n\n### Which group has authority in the event of a dispute?\n\nThe WHATWG editors determine what gets merged into the WHATWG Living Standard, according to the [WHATWG Working Mode](https://whatwg.org/working-mode). If participants from the community, including from the W3C HTML WG, dispute an editor decision, they can [raise an issue for discussion with the WHATWG Steering Group](https://whatwg.org/workstream-policy#appeals).\n\nIn the case of W3C HTML WG participants in particular, there is a [conflict procedure](https://www.w3.org/2019/04/WHATWG-W3C-MOU.html#conflict) they can follow to raise their concerns with others in the W3C. Ultimately, this might result in the group choosing not to endorse the most recent contents of the WHATWG HTML Standard as a W3C Recommendation.\n\n## What is the history of HTML?\n\nHere are some documents that detail the history of HTML:\n\n* [A feature history of the modern web platform](https://platform.html5.org/history/) (2003 onward) ([on GitHub](https://github.com/whatwg/platform.html5.org/blob/main/history/index.html))\n* [HTML's timeline on the W3C HTML WG wiki](https://www.w3.org/html/wg/wiki/History) (1997 to 2008)\n* [The history section in the HTML Standard itself](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/introduction.html#history-2)\n\n## Other specifications\n\n### What ever happened to...?\n\nThe Web Forms 2.0 specification was folded into what is now the HTML Standard.\n\nThe Web Controls 1.0 specification was overtaken by events and has been abandoned. Its problem space is mostly handled by ARIA and Web Components now.\n\nThe DOM Parsing specification was abandoned by the WHATWG because the W3C was doing a better job of maintaining that specification. We do not want to cause confusion in the marketplace, so when another organization writes a specification that covers the same technology as one of ours, we only continue to publish it if our version is technically superior.\n"

If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database;\n\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n- - - -\n\nBSD 3-Clause License\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n1.
