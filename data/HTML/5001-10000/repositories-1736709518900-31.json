(doesn't work with the process env for some reason).\n\nRun `yarn build` to build the static HTML files that will be uploaded to FlowBite. The static HTML files can be found in the `_gh_pages/` folder then moved to the `static/docs` folder from the main FlowBite Gatsby repo.\n\n## Building for NPM registry\n\nMake sure that purge is NOT enabled in `tailwind.config.js` (this needs to be fixed with env variables).\n\nRun `npm run build:npm` and then `npm publish` to release a new version. Make sure you also change the version."

If you don't feel ready to make a code contribution yet, no problem!\n\nIf you are interested in making a code contribution and would like to learn more about the technologies that we use, check out the list below.\n\n- [Learn JavaScript - Full Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkZNo7MFNFg)\n- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)\n\n## How do I make a contribution?\n\nNever made an open source contribution before? Wondering how contributions work in the in our project? Here's a quick rundown!\n\n1. [Find an issue](https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite/issues) that you are interested in addressing or a feature that you would like to add.\n2. Fork the repository associated with the issue to your local GitHub organization. This means that you will have a copy of the repository under `your-GitHub-username/repository-name`.\n3. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/github-username/repository-name.git`.\n4. Create a new branch for your fix using `git checkout -b branch-name-here`.\n5. Make the appropriate changes for the issue you are trying to address or the feature that you want to add.\n6. Use `git add insert-paths-of-changed-files-here` to add the file contents of the changed files to the \"snapshot\" git uses to manage the state of the project, also known as the index.\n7. Use `git commit` to store the contents of the index with a descriptive message. Use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to create a nice message.\n8. Push the changes to the remote repository using `git push origin branch-name-here`.\n9. Submit a pull request to the upstream repository.\n10. Title the pull request with a short description of the changes made and the issue or bug number associated with your change. For example, you can title an issue like so `\"Added more log outputting to resolve #4352\"`.\n11. In the description of the pull request, explain the changes that you made, any issues you think exist with the pull request you made, and any questions you have for the maintainer. It's OK if your pull request is not perfect (no pull request is), the reviewer will be able to help you fix any problems and improve it!\n12. Wait for the pull request to be reviewed by a maintainer.\n13. Make changes to the pull request if the reviewing maintainer recommends them.\n14. Celebrate your success after your pull request is merged! 🎉 🎉\n\n## Where can I go for help?\n\nIf you need help, you can ask questions please, [join us at our Discord Community](https://discord.gg/S6J9pUmj2t).\n\n## What does the Code of Conduct mean for me?\n\nOur Code of Conduct means that you are responsible for treating everyone on the project with respect and courtesy regardless of their identity.

Install Flowbite as a dependency using NPM by running the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm install flowbite\n```\n\n2. Require Flowbite as a plugin inside the `tailwind.config.js` file:\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = {\n\n    plugins: [\n        require('flowbite/plugin')\n    ]\n\n}\n```\n\n3. Make sure that you add the template path to the `tailwind.config.js` file:\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = {\n\n    content: [\n        \"./node_modules/flowbite/**/*.js\"\n    ]\n\n}\n```\n\n4. Include the main JavaScript file to make interactive elements work:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"../path/to/flowbite/dist/flowbite.js\"></script>\n```\n\n### Include via CDN\n\nThe quickest way to get started working with Flowbite is to simply include the CSS and JavaScript into your project via a CDN service such as UNPKG or CDNJS (content delivery networks).\n\nRequire the following minified stylesheet inside the `head` tag:\n\n```html\n<link href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/flowbite@2.5.2/dist/flowbite.min.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" />\n```\n\nAnd include the following javascript file before the end of the `body` tag:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/flowbite@2.5.2/dist/flowbite.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\n### Bundled JavaScript\n\nOne of the most popular way of using Flowbite is to include the bundled Javascript file which is UMD ready using a bundler such as Webpack or Parcel which makes sure that all of the data attributes and functionality will work out-of-the-box.\n\nYou can directly import the main JavaScript file inside your bundled `app-bundle.js` file like this:\n\n```javascript\nimport 'flowbite';\n```\n\nThis file has access to all of the components and it automatically applies event listeners to the data attributes.\n\n### Data attributes\n\nThe preferred way to use the interactive UI components from Flowbite is via the data attributes interface which allows us to add functionality via the HTML element attributes and most of the examples on our documentation applies this strategy.\n\nFor example, to set up a modal component all you need to do is use `data-modal-target` and `data-modal-{toggle|show|hide}` to toggle, show, or hide the component by clicking on any trigger element.\n\n```html\n<button data-modal-target=\"defaultModal\" data-modal-toggle=\"defaultModal\" class=\"block text-white bg-blue-700 hover:bg-blue-800 focus:ring-4 focus:outline-none focus:ring-blue-300 font-medium rounded-lg text-sm px-5 py-2.5 text-center dark:bg-blue-600 dark:hover:bg-blue-700 dark:focus:ring-blue-800\" type=\"button\">\n  Toggle modal\n</button>\n\n<!-- Main modal -->\n<div id=\"defaultModal\" tabindex=\"-1\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"fixed top-0 left-0 right-0 z-50 hidden w-full p-4 overflow-x-hidden overflow-y-auto md:inset-0 h-[calc(100%-1rem)] max-h-full\">\n    <div class=\"relative w-full max-w-2xl max-h-full\">\n        <!-- Modal content -->\n        <div class=\"relative bg-white rounded-lg shadow dark:bg-gray-700\">\n            <!-- Modal header -->\n            <div class=\"flex items-start justify-between p-4 border-b rounded-t dark:border-gray-600\">\n                <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white\">\n                    Terms of Service\n                </h3>\n                <button type=\"button\" class=\"text-gray-400 bg-transparent hover:bg-gray-200 hover:text-gray-900 rounded-lg text-sm p-1.5 ml-auto inline-flex items-center dark:hover:bg-gray-600 dark:hover:text-white\" data-modal-hide=\"defaultModal\">\n                    <svg aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"w-5 h-5\" fill=\"currentColor\" viewBox=\"0 0 20 20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4.293 4.293a1 1 0 011.414 0L10 8.586l4.293-4.293a1 1 0 111.414 1.414L11.414 10l4.293 4.293a1 1 0 01-1.414 1.414L10 11.414l-4.293 4.293a1 1 0 01-1.414-1.414L8.586 10 4.293 5.707a1 1 0 010-1.414z\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\"></path></svg>\n                    <span class=\"sr-only\">Close modal</span>\n                </button>\n            </div>\n            <!-- Modal body -->\n            <div class=\"p-6 space-y-6\">\n                <p class=\"text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400\">\n                    With less than a month to go before the European Union enacts new consumer privacy laws for its citizens, companies around the world are updating their terms of service agreements to comply.\n                </p>\n                <p class=\"text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400\">\n                    The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (G.D.P.R.) goes into effect on May 25 and is meant to ensure a common set of data rights in the European Union. It requires organizations to notify users as soon as possible of high-risk data breaches that could personally affect them.\n                </p>\n            </div>\n            <!-- Modal footer -->\n            <div class=\"flex items-center p-6 space-x-2 border-t border-gray-200 rounded-b dark:border-gray-600\">\n                <button data-modal-hide=\"defaultModal\" type=\"button\" class=\"text-white bg-blue-700 hover:bg-blue-800 focus:ring-4 focus:outline-none focus:ring-blue-300 font-medium rounded-lg text-sm px-5 py-2.5 text-center dark:bg-blue-600 dark:hover:bg-blue-700 dark:focus:ring-blue-800\">I accept</button>\n                <button data-modal-hide=\"defaultModal\" type=\"button\" class=\"text-gray-500 bg-white hover:bg-gray-100 focus:ring-4 focus:outline-none focus:ring-blue-300 rounded-lg border border-gray-200 text-sm font-medium px-5 py-2.5 hover:text-gray-900 focus:z-10 dark:bg-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 dark:border-gray-500 dark:hover:text-white dark:hover:bg-gray-600 dark:focus:ring-gray-600\">Decline</button>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n#### Init functions\n\nYou can also use the init functions to set up the event listeners yourself. Here's an example how you can do it with Vue or Nuxt:\n\n```\n<script setup>\nimport { onMounted } from 'vue'\nimport { initFlowbite } from 'flowbite'\n\n// initialize components based on data attribute selectors\nonMounted(() => {\n    initFlowbite();\n})\n</script>\n\n<template>\n    // Modal HTML markup with data attributes from Flowbite\n</template>\n```\n\nThe `initFlowbite` function sets up all of the init functions for dropdowns, modals, navbars, tooltips and so on to hook onto the data attributes. Alternatively, you can also initialise each component category class separately with `initDropdowns` or `initModals`.\n\nYou can view more examples by browsing the [components from Flowbite](#components).\n\n### ESM and CJS\n\nFlowbite also offers an API for using the components programmatically and it supports both CJS and ESM for JavaScript which can be helpful if you need to expand the default capabilities of the data attributes interface and get access to function callbacks.\n\nHere's an example how you can import and create a new Modal component inside JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Modal } from 'flowbite'\n\nconst $modalElement = document.querySelector('#modalEl');\n\nconst modalOptions = {\n    placement: 'bottom-right',\n    backdrop: 'dynamic',\n    backdropClasses: 'bg-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-900/80 fixed inset-0 z-40',\n    onHide: () => {\n        console.log('modal is hidden');\n    },\n    onShow: () => {\n        console.log('modal is shown');\n    },\n    onToggle: () => {\n        console.log('modal has been toggled');\n    }\n}\n\nconst modal = new Modal($modalElement, modalOptions);\n\nmodal.show();\n```\n\nCheck out the JavaScript behaviour section of each component's page to learn how you can use this.\n\n### TypeScript\n\nFlowbite supports type declarations for the interactive UI components including object interfaces and parameter types. Check out the following examples to learn how you can use types with Flowbite.\n\nAdditionally to our code above, we will now import some relevant types from the Flowbite package, namely the `ModalOptions` and `ModalInterface`:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Modal } from 'flowbite'\nimport type { ModalOptions, ModalInterface } from 'flowbite'\n\n// other code\n```\n\nGenerally speaking, all of the components have an interface definition that you can use whenever you create a new object to make sure that you're using the correct types of parameters and methods.\n\nWhen creating a new modal you can set the `ModalInterface` as the main type:\n\n```javascript\nconst modal: ModalInterface = new Modal($modalElement, modalOptions);\n```\n\nFlowbite also supports type definitions for the options object so if you want to set the placement of the modal based on types, here's how you would do that:\n\n```javascript\nconst modalOptions: ModalOptions = {\n    placement: 'top-right'\n}\n\nconst modal: ModalInterface = new Modal($modalElement, modalOptions);\n```\n\nLearn more about Flowbite and TypeScript in the [quickstart guide](https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/typescript/).\n\n### RTL support\n\nAll of the Flowbite UI components have native RTL support and you can easily set it up by using the `dir=\"rtl\"` attribute on the HTML element. Read more about Flowbite and [RTL support here](https://flowbite.com/docs/customize/rtl/).\n\n### JavaScript Frameworks\n\nThe awesome open-source community also built and currently maintains the following standalone libraries for React, Vue, Svelte, Angular and Qwik:\n\n- [🌀 Flowbite React Library](https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite-react)\n- [🍀 Flowbite Vue
