Its purpose is to provide an extensible framework for diagnosing and fixing typical programming errors, like style violations, interface misuse, or bugs that can be deduced via static analysis. clang-tidy is modular and provides a convenient interface for writing new checks.\n* [clang-analyzer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangStaticAnalyzer.html) - is a source code analysis tool that finds bugs in C, C++, and Objective-C programs. It implements path-sensitive, inter-procedural analysis based on symbolic execution technique.\n\n### [Fuzzing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing)\n\n* [American fuzzy lop](https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/) - American fuzzy lop is a security-oriented fuzzer.\n* [hongfuzz](https://honggfuzz.com/) - A security oriented, feedback-driven, evolutionary, easy-to-use fuzzer with interesting analysis options.\n* [libFuzzer](https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html) - A library for coverage-guided fuzz testing.\n\n### [Build system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_automation)\n\n* [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) - is a fast, scalable, multi-language and extensible build system.\n* [build2](https://build2.org/) - is a cross-platform build toolchain for developing and packaging C and C++ code.\n* [CMake](https://cmake.org/) üåü - Cross-platform family of tools designed to build, test and package software.\n* [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/) - is an open source build system meant to be both extremely fast, and, even more importantly, as user friendly as possible.\n* [XMake](https://xmake.io) - is a cross-platform build utility based on Lua.\n\n### [Package management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager)\n\n* [Buckaroo](https://github.com/LoopPerfect/buckaroo) - Fully Decentralized Polyglot Package Manager for C++ and Friends\n* [cget](https://github.com/pfultz2/cget) - CMake package retrieval.\n* [conan](https://www.conan.io/) - C/C++ package manager.\n* [CPM](https://github.com/TheLartians/CPM) - A CMake script for setup-free cross-plattform dependency management.\n* [Hunter](https://github.com/cpp-pm/hunter) - Cross-platform package manager for C++.\n* [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) - C++ Library Manager for Windows, Linux, and MacOS\n* [xrepo](https://xrepo.xmake.io) - A cross-platform C/C++ package manager based on Xmake.\n\n## About\n\nThis list was compiled by **Erik Rigtorp** with help from the C++\ncommunity:\n\n* [rigtorp.se](https://rigtorp.se)\n* [erik@rigtorp.se](mailto:erik@rigtorp.se)\n* [github.com/rigtorp](https://github.com/rigtorp)\n* [twitter.com/rigtorp](https://twitter.com/rigtorp)\n* [linkedin.com/in/rigtorp](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rigtorp)\n"
