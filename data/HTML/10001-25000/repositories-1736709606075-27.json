We continued promoting this project through blogs, Medium articles, socials. And we released new features, like the Location Based AR that was not initially present on AR.js.\n\nNow, that we are also ready to ship a new feature, Image Tracking, we feel ready to start a new path, and so we have created a new repository that is not owned by individuals, but by one organization.\n\nAnyone can be added to it, and more people will manage it, in order to make the project more collaborative and avoid \"bottlenecks\".\n\nWe feel this is a new chapter for this project, to not let it die alone. We feel the current Web Augmented Reality market really needed something like AR.js, but only if owned by no-one apart from the community itself. A technology free and Open Source, created by users for the users.\n\nWe'd like to thank all contributors and passionate people who help us in this journey.\n\nOn the new repository, you will find all the feature you already had here, plus:\n\n- Image Tracking feature\n- more examples to learn by doing\n- a new, contributive place to get started\n- a new Documentation.\n\nSee you on new [AR.js org](https://github.com/AR-js-org).\n\n*Nicolò Carpignoli*\n\n_____\n\nAR.js is a free and Open Source software, created by [@jeromeetienne](https://github.com/jeromeetienne) and maintained by [@nicolocarpignoli](https://github.com/nicolocarpignoli).
