You'll see something like this:\n\n```\ndesign-blocks/\n├── dist/\n│   ├── css/\n│   │   ├── froala_blocks.css\n│   │   └── froala_blocks.min.css\n│   └── imgs/\n│   │── call_to_action.html\n│   │── contacts.html\n│   │── contents.html\n│   │── features.html\n│   │── footers.html\n│   │── forms.html\n│   │── headers.html\n│   │── index.html\n│   │── pricings.html\n│   │── teams.html\n│   └── testimonials.html\n├── assets/\n├── screenshots/\n└── src/\n```\n\nWe provide compiled CSS (`froala_blocks.css`), as well as compiled and minified CSS (`froala_blocks.min.css`). Also, in the downloaded archive you will find useful images and PSD files that you can use to create new backgrounds. In the `screenshots` folder, there are the screenshots of all design blocks.\n\n\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- **Bootstrap**. Froala Design Blocks is built on Bootstrap 4 library and fully supports it. It uses the Javascript files only for the header design blocks, so if you don't need them, we recommend not to include the Bootstrap JS files in order to reduce your bundle size.\n\n- **Font Awesome**. We're using the amazing Font Awesome library for the social network icons.\n\n- **Google Fonts**. By default, the Design Blocks toolkit is built using the Roboto font, however that can easily be changed to other fonts.\n\n\n\n## Categories\n\n- Call to action - https://github.com/froala/design-blocks/blob/master/dist/call-to-action.html\n- Contacts - https://github.com/froala/design-blocks/blob/master/dist/contacts.html\n- Contents - https://github.com/froala/design-blocks/blob/master/dist/contents.html\n- Features - https://github.com/froala/design-blocks/blob/master/dist/features.html\n- Footers - https://github.com/froala/design-blocks/blob/master/dist/footers.html\n- Forms - https://github.com/froala/design-blocks/blob/master/dist/forms.html\n- Headers - https://github.com/froala/design-blocks/blob/master/dist/headers.html\n- Pricings - https://github.com/froala/design-blocks/blob/master/dist/pricings.html\n- Teams - https://github.com/froala/design-blocks/blob/master/dist/teams.html\n- Testimonials - https://github.com/froala/design-blocks/blob/master/dist/testimonials.html\n\n\n\n## Browser Support\n\nAt the moment, we aim to support all major web browsers.

Please first read the issue guidelines and search for existing and closed issues. If your problem or idea is not addressed yet, [please open a new issue](https://github.com/froala/design-blocks/issues/new).\n\n\n\n## Community\n\nGet updates on Froala Design Blocks' development and chat with the project maintainers and community members:\n\n- Follow [@froala on Twitter](https://twitter.com/froala)\n- Read and subscribe to [The Official Froala Blog](https://www.froala.com/blog)\n- Check the [Official Website](https://www.froala.com/design-blocks)\n- Join us [on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/froala/)\n- [Google+](https://plus.google.com/+Froala/)\n- [Pinterest](https://pinterest.com/froala/)\n\n\n\n## Contributing guidelines\n\nAll contributions are more than welcomed. Contributions may close an issue, fix a bug (reported or not reported), add new design blocks, improve the existing code, add new feature, and so on. In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. [Read the full Code of Conduct](https://github.com/froala/design-blocks/blob/dev/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\nThe `dev` branch is the default and base branch for the project. It is used for development and all Pull Requests should go there. Please make sure not to commit the `dist` folder in the `dev` branch.\n\n#### Development\n\nThe project needs to be compiled, therefore the files in the `src` folder are those we'll be developing on. Don't make changes in the `dist` or `demo` folders as they will be overwritten when `src` is compiled.\n\n1. Get code\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:froala/design-blocks.git\ncd design-blocks\n```\n\n2. Install dependencies and run project\n\n```bash\nnpm install\nnpm run start\n```\n\nWith the gulp server running, the project is available at the following address [localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001/). The `src` files are automatically compiled when changes have been made.\n\n#### Versioning\nThrough the development of new versions, we're going use the Semantic Versioning: https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/semantic-versioning. Example: 1.0.0.\n- Major release: increment the first digit and reset middle and last digits to zero. Introduces major changes that might break backward compatibility. E.g. 2.0.0\n- Minor release: increment the middle digit and reset last digit to zero. It would fix bugs and also add new features without breaking backward compatibility. E.g. 1.1.0\n- Patch release: increment the third digit. It would fix bugs and keep backward compatibility. E.g. 1.0.1\n\n\n\n## Contributors\n\nSpecial thanks to everyone who contributed to getting the Froala Design Blocks to the current state.  🙏\n\n- [Creative Tim](https://www.creative-tim.com/) ❤️ - design blocks PSDs, help with typography and SVGs for shapes\n- [Reaction](https://reaction.ca) - design blocks Sketches:\n- [m5o](https://github.com/m5o) - help with update to Bootstrap 4\n- [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) - photos\n- [Undraw](https://undraw.co/) - illustrations\n- [FeatherIcons](https://feathericons.com/) - icons\n\n## Copyright and License\n\nCode and documentation copyright 2018 [Froala Labs](https://www.froala.com/).
