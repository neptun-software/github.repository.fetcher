This is useful for reenabling the default behavior as you migrate individual components:\n\n  ```js\n  import {PolymerElement, html} from '@polymer/polymer/polymer-element.js';\n\n  class MigratedElement extends PolymerElement { /* ... */ }\n\n  // All MigratedElement instances will use the default behavior.\n  MigratedElement.prototype._overrideLegacyUndefined = true;\n\n  customElements.define('migrated-element', SomeElement);\n  ```\n\n  **Should I use it?** This setting should only be used for migrating legacy codebases that depend on this behavior and is otherwise **not recommended**.\n\n- `legacyWarnings` / `setLegacyWarnings`\n\n  **What does it do?** This setting causes Polymer to warn if a component's template contains bindings to properties that are not listed in that element's [`properties` block](https://polymer-library.polymer-project.org/3.0/docs/devguide/properties). For example:\n\n  ```js\n  import {PolymerElement, html} from '@polymer/polymer/polymer-element.js';\n\n  class SomeElement extends PolymerElement {\n    static get template() {\n      return html`<span>[[someProperty]] is used here</span>`;\n    }\n\n    static get properties() {\n      return { /* but `someProperty` is not declared here */ };\n    }\n  }\n\n  customElements.define('some-element', SomeElement);\n  ```\n\n  Only properties explicitly declared in the `properties` block are [associated with an attribute](https://polymer-library.polymer-project.org/3.0/docs/devguide/properties#property-name-mapping) and [update when that attribute changes](https://polymer-library.polymer-project.org/3.0/docs/devguide/properties#attribute-deserialization). Enabling this setting will show you where you might have forgotten to declare properties.\n\n  **Should I use it?** Consider using this feature during development but don't enable it in production.\n\n- `orderedComputed` / `setOrderedComputed`\n\n  **What does it do?** This setting causes Polymer to topologically sort each component's computed properties graph when the class is initialized and uses that order whenever computed properties are run.\n\n  For example:\n\n  ```js\n  import {PolymerElement, html} from '@polymer/polymer/polymer-element.js';\n\n  class SomeElement extends PolymerElement {\n    static get properties() {\n      return {\n        a: {type: Number, value: 0},\n        b: {type: Number, computed: 'computeB(a)'},\n        c: {type: Number, computed: 'computeC(a, b)'},\n      };\n    }\n\n    computeB(a) {\n      console.log('Computing b...');\n      return a + 1;\n    }\n\n    computeC(a, b) {\n      console.log('Computing c...');\n      return (a + b) * 2;\n    }\n  }\n\n  customElements.define('some-element', SomeElement);\n  ```\n\n  When `a` changes, Polymer's default behavior does not specify the order in which its dependents will run. Given that both `b` and `c` depend directly on `a`, one of two possible orders could occur: [`computeB`, `computeC`] or [`computeC`, `computeB`].\n\n  - In the first case - [`computeB`, `computeC`] - `computeB` is run with the new value of `a` and produces a new value for `b`. Then, `computeC` is run with both the new values of `a` and `b` to produce `c`.\n\n  - In the second case - [`computeC`, `computeB`] - `computeC` is run first with the new value of `a` and the _current_ value of `b` to produce `c`. Then, `computeB` is run with the new value of `a` to produce `b`. If `computeB` changed the value of `b` then `computeC` will be run again, with the new values of both `a` and `b` to produce the final value of `c`.\n\n  However, with `orderedComputed` enabled, the computed properties would have been previously sorted into [`computeB`, `computeC`], so updating `a` would cause them to run specifically in that order.\n\n  If your component's computed property graph contains cycles, the order in which they are run when using `orderedComputed` is still undefined.\n\n  **Should I use it?** The value of this setting depends on how your computed property functions are implemented. If they are pure and relatively inexpensive, you shouldn't need to enable this feature. If they have side effects that would make the order in which they are run important or are expensive enough that it would be a problem to run them multiple times for a property update, consider enabling it.\n\n- `fastDomIf` / `setFastDomIf`\n\n  **What does it do?** This setting enables a different implementation of `<dom-if>` that uses its host element's template stamping facilities (provided as part of `PolymerElement`) rather than including its own. This setting can help with performance but comes with a few caveats:\n\n  - First, `fastDomIf` requires that every `<dom-if>` is in the shadow root of a Polymer element: you can't use a `<dom-if>` directly in the main document or inside a shadow root of an element that doesn't extend `PolymerElement`.\n\n  - Second, because the `fastDomIf` implementation of `<dom-if>` doesn't include its own template stamping features, it doesn't create its own scope for property effects. This means that any properties you were previously setting on the `<dom-if>` will no longer be applied within its template, only properties of the host element are available.\n\n  **Should I use it?** This setting is recommended as long as your app doesn't use `<dom-if>` as described in the section above.\n\n- `removeNestedTemplates` / `setRemoveNestedTemplates`\n\n  **What does it do?** This setting causes Polymer to remove the child `<template>` elements used by `<dom-if>` and `<dom-repeat>` from the their containing templates. This can improve the performance of cloning your component's template when new instances are created.\n\n  **Should I use it?** This setting is generally recommended.\n\n- `suppressTemplateNotifications` / `setSuppressTemplateNotifications`\n\n  **What does it do?** This setting causes `<dom-if>` and `<dom-repeat>` not to dispatch `dom-change` events when their rendered content is updated. If you're using lots of `<dom-if>` and `<dom-repeat>` but not listening for these events, this setting lets you disable them and their associated dispatch work.\n\n  You can override the global setting for an individual `<dom-if>` or `<dom-repeat>` by setting its `notify-dom-change` boolean attribute:\n\n  ```js\n  import {PolymerElement, html} from '@polymer/polymer/polymer-element.js';\n\n  class SomeElement extends PolymerElement {\n    static get properties() {\n      return {\n        visible: {type: Boolean, value: false},\n      };\n    }\n\n    static get template() {\n      return html`\n        <button on-click=\"_toggle\">Toggle</button>\n        <!-- Set notify-dom-change to enable dom-change events for this particular <dom-if>. -->\n        <dom-if if=\"[[visible]]\" notify-dom-change on-dom-change=\"_onDomChange\">\n          <template>\n            Hello!\n          </template>\n        </dom-if>\n      `;\n    }\n\n    _toggle() {\n      this.visible = !this.visible;\n    }\n\n    _onDomChange(e) {\n      console.log(\"Received 'dom-change' event.\");\n    }\n  }\n\n  customElements.define('some-element', SomeElement);\n  ```\n\n  **Should I use it?** This setting is generally recommended.\n\n- `legacyNoObservedAttributes` / `setLegacyNoObservedAttributes`\n\n  **What does it do?** This setting causes `LegacyElementMixin` not to use the browser's built-in mechanism for informing elements of attribute changes (i.e. `observedAttributes` and `attributeChangedCallback`), which lets Polymer skip computing the list of attributes it tells the browser to observe. Instead, `LegacyElementMixin` simulates this behavior by overriding attribute APIs on the element and calling `attributeChangedCallback` itself.\n\n  This setting has similar API restrictions to those of the [custom elements polyfill](https://github.com/webcomponents/polyfills/tree/master/packages/custom-elements). You should only use the element's `setAttribute` and `removeAttribute` methods to modify attributes: using (e.g.) the element's `attributes` property to modify its attributes is not supported with `legacyNoObservedAttributes` and won't properly trigger `attributeChangedCallback` or any property effects.\n\n  Components can override the global setting by setting their `_legacyForceObservedAttributes` property to `true`. This property's effects occur at startup; it won't have any effect if modified at runtime and should be set in the class definition.\n\n  **Should I use it?** This setting should only be used if startup time is significantly affected by Polymer's class initialization work - for example, if you have a large number of components being loaded but are only instantiating a small subset of them. Otherwise, this setting is **not recommended**.\n\n- `useAdoptedStyleSheetsWithBuiltCSS` / `setUseAdoptedStyleSheetsWithBuiltCSS`\n\n  **What does it do?** If your application is uses [pre-built Shady CSS styles](https://github.com/polymer/polymer-css-build) and your browser supports [constructable stylesheet objects](https://wicg.github.io/construct-stylesheets/), this setting will cause Polymer to extract all `<style>` elements from your components' templates, join them into a single stylesheet, and share this stylesheet with all instances of the component using their shadow roots' [`adoptedStyleSheets`](https://wicg.github.io/construct-stylesheets/#dom-documentorshadowroot-adoptedstylesheets) array. This setting may improve your components' memory usage and performance depending on how many instances you create and how large their style sheets are.\n\n  **Should I use it?** Consider using this setting if your app already uses pre-built Shady CSS styles. Note that position-dependent CSS selectors (e.g. containing `:nth-child()`) may become unreliable for siblings of your components' styles as a result of runtime-detected browser support determining if styles are removed from your components' shadow roots.\n\n### Other new features\n\n#### `<dom-repeat>`\n\n- `reuseChunkedInstances`\n\n  **What does it do?** This boolean property causes `<dom-repeat>` to reuse template instances even when `items` is replaced with a new array, matching the Polymer 1 behavior.\n\n  By default, a `<dom-repeat>` with chunking enabled (i.e. `initialCount` >= 0) will drop all previously rendered template instances and create new ones whenever the `items` array is replaced. With `reuseChunkedInstances` set, any previously rendered template instances will instead be repopulated with data from the new array before new instances are created.\n\n  **Should I use it?** This flag is generally recommended and can improve rendering performance of chunked `<dom-repeat>` instances with live data.\n\n#### `LegacyElementMixin`\n\n- `disable-upgrade`\n\n  **What does it do?** `LegacyElementMixin` now has built-in support for the `disable-upgrade` attribute (usually provided by [`DisableUpgradeMixin`](https://polymer-library.polymer-project.org/3.0/api/mixins/disable-upgrade-mixin)) that becomes active when the global `legacyOptimizations` setting is enabled, matching the Polymer 1 behavior.\n\n  **Should I use it?** Consider using this setting if you are already using the `legacyOptimizations` setting and migrating older components that depend on `disable-upgrade` without explicit application of `DisableUpgradeMixin`.\n\n### Bug fixes\n\n#### `<dom-repeat>`\n\n- Chunking behavior\n\n  `<dom-repeat>` no longer resets the number of rendered instances to `initialCount` when modifying `items` with `PolymerElement`'s array modification methods ([`splice`](https://polymer-library.polymer-project.org/3.0/api/mixins/element-mixin#ElementMixin-method-splice), [`push`](https://polymer-library.polymer-project.org/3.0/api/mixins/element-mixin#ElementMixin-method-push), etc.). The number of rendered instances will only be reset to `initialCount` if the `items` array itself is replaced with a new array object.\n\n  See [#5631](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/5631) for more information.\n\n### All commits\n\n- [ci skip] bump to 3.4.0 ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/08585311))\n\n- `shareBuiltCSSWithAdoptedStyleSheets` -> `useAdoptedStyleSheetsWithBuiltCSS` ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/33e14986))\n\n- formatting ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/d0848d83))\n\n- Fix incorrect JSDoc param name.

Note that any falsey value for initialCount (including `0`) is interpreted as \"chunking disabled\". This is consistent with 1.x logic, and follows from the logic of \"starting chunking by rendering zero items\" doesn't really make sense. ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/60f6ccfb))\n\n- Updates from review. * Refactoring `__render` for readability * Removing `__pool`; this was never used in v2: since we reset the pool every update and items are only ever pushed at detach time and we only detach at the end of updates (as opposed to v1 which had more sophisticated splicing) ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/0797488b))\n\n- Store syncInfo on the dom-if, but null it in teardown. (same as invalidProps for non-fastDomIf) ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/fe86a8c8))\n\n- Fixes for several related dom-repeat chunking issues. Fixes #5631. * Only restart chunking (resetting the list to the initialCount) if the `items` array itself changed (and not splices to the array), to match Polymer 1 behavior. * Add `reuseChunkedInstances` option to allow reusing instances even when `items` changes; this is likely the more common optimal case when using immutable data, but making it optional for backward compatibility. * Only measure render time and throttle the chunk size if we rendered a full chunk of new items. Ensures that fast re-renders of existing items don't cause the chunk size to scale up dramatically, subsequently causing too many new items to be created in one chunk. * Increase the limit by the chunk size as part of any render if there are new items to render, rather than only as a result of rendering. * Continue chunking by comparing the filtered item count to the limit (not the unfiltered item count).

Maintains flush semantics with Templatizer stamping (relevant to fastDomIf, which is a switch between Templatizer-based stamping and runtime _stampTemplate-based stamping). Works around an issue with `noPatch` where nested undistributed dom-if's won't stamp.  The changes to the tests are to remove testing that the full host tree is correct since the host doing the runtime stamping will no longer be the DOM getRootNode().host at ready time (this is exactly the case with Templatizer, whose semantics we intend to match). ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/7e7febc3))\n\n- Fix template-finding issue with DisableUpgrade mixin. The existing rules are that `prototype._template` is first priority and dom-module via `is` is second priority _for a given class_. A subclass has a new shot at overriding the previous template either by defining a new `prototype._template` or a new `is` resulting in a dom-module lookup.  However, trivially subclassing a Polymer legacy element breaks these rules, since if there is no _own_ `prototype._template` on the current class, it will lookup a dom-module using `is` from up the entire prototype chain. This defeats the rule that a `prototype._template` on the superclass should have taken priority over its dom-module.  This change ensures that we only lookup dom-module if the class has an _own_ is property.

This ensures that (1) clients that are enabled before the host is enabled flush properly, and (2) clients that are stamped but not enabled properly enable when the host flushes.

An optional mixin is\n    available for elements to skip dirty checking of objects and arrays, which may be more easy to\n    integrate with some state management systems. For details, see\n    [Using the MutableData mixin](devguide/data-system#mutable-data) in Data system concepts.\n\n-   Support for dynamically-created `custom-style` elements has been added.\n\n-   Support for the external style sheet syntax, `<link rel=\"import\" type=\"css\">` has\n    been added. This was deprecated in 1.x, but will be retained until an alternate solution is\n    available for importing unprocessed CSS.\n\n-   New properties `rootPath` and `basePath` were added to `Polymer.Element` to allow authors\n    to configure how URLs are rewritten inside templates. For details, see the\n    [Update URLs in templates](./upgrade#urls-in-templates) in the Upgrade guide.\n\n\n## [v1.9.1-dev](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/tree/v1.9.1-dev) (2017-04-17)\n- Remove use of ES6 API.

([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/a0ad3bbe))\n\n- add tests ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/20de9287))\n\n- Adds a setting `preserveStyleIncludes` which, when used with a shadow dom targeted css build and native custom properties, will copy styles into the Shadow DOM template rather than collapsing them into a single style. This will (1) allow the browser to optimize parsing of shared styles because they remain intact, (2) reduce the size of the css build resources when shared styles are used since they are not pre-collapsed. This option does perform registration runtime work to add included styles to element templates. ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/2315547e))\n\n- Fix test failures by feature detecting instance `properties` accessors. Can't rely on `__proto__` on IE10, but that browser doesn't need to avoid `properties`.

([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/dcde6d4c))\n\n- Fix test lint issue. ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/26c669ce))\n\n- Add global flags to suppress unnecessary notification events. Fixes #4262. * `Polymer.Settings.suppressTemplateNotifications `- disables `dom-change` and `rendered-item-count` events from `dom-if`, `dom-repeat`, and `don-bind`. Users can opt back into `dom-change` events by setting the `notify-dom-change` attribute (`notifyDomChange: true` property) to `dom-if`/`don-repeat` instances. * `Polymer.Settings.suppressBindingNotifications` - disables notify effects when propagating data downward via bindings. Generally these are never useful unless users are explicitly doing something like `<my-el foo=\"{{foo}} on-foo-changed=\"{{handleFoo}}\">` or calling `addEventListener('foo-changed', ...)` on an element where `foo` is bound (we attempted to make this the default some time back but needed to revert it when we found via https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/3077 that users were indeed doing this).  Users that avoid these patterns can enjoy the potentially significant benefit of suppressing unnecessary events during downward data flow by opting into this flag.

Ensures that custom-style properties are applied async but before next render so that all properties are defined before any are consumed by custom-styles. Also refines dom-module's early upgrade code so that it does not affect other elements (corrects for example, custom-styles upgrading before expected).

([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/aca404f))\n\n- Explicitly making an element's `_template` falsy is now considered an allowable setting. This means the element stamps no content, doesn't collect any styles, and avoids looking up a dom-module. This helps address #2708 and the 5 elements Polymer registers that have no template have been set with `_template: null`. ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/b905a37))\n\n- Make test work under native Shadow DOM. ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/4f9c2bd))\n\n- In `_notifyListener`, only use `e.detail` if the event has a detail.

([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/f2d5f44))\n\n- For efficiency, use cached events in data system, for property and path changes. ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/da71dfe))\n\n- Fixes #2690 ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/d8b78d4))\n\n- change after render method to `Polymer.RenderStatus.afterNextRender` ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/8949c04))\n\n- When effect values are applied via bindings, use fromAbove gambit to avoid unnecessary wheel spinning. (This is now possible since we have fast lookup for readOnly where we want to avoid doing the set at all). ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/c520907))\n\n- do readOnly check for configured properties where they are handed down, rather than when they are consumed. ([commit](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/commit/24bcedb))\n\n- Minor cleanup.

          "name": "CONTRIBUTING.md",
          "type": "blob",
          "size": 9.98046875,
          "content": "# Contributing to Polymer\n\nThere are many ways to contribute to the Polymer project! We welcome and truly appreciate contribution in all forms - issues and pull requests to the [main library](https://github.com/polymer/polymer), issues and pull requests to the [elements the Polymer team maintains](https://github.com/polymerelements), issues and pull requests to one of our many [Polymer-related tools](https://github.com/polymer), and of course we love to hear about any Polymer elements that you build to share with the community!\n\n## Logistics\n\n### Communicating with the Polymer team\n\nBeyond GitHub, we try to have a variety of different lines of communication open:\n\n* [Blog](https://blog.polymer-project.org/)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/polymer)\n* [Mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/polymer-dev)\n* [Slack channel](https://bit.ly/polymerslack)\n\n### The Polymer Repositories\n\nBecause of the component-based nature of the Polymer project, we tend to have lots of different repositories. Our main repository for the Polymer library itself is at [github.com/Polymer/polymer](https://github.com/polymer/polymer). File any issues or pull requests that have to do with the core library on that repository, and we'll take a look ASAP.\n\nWe keep all of the element \"product lines\" that the Polymer team maintains and distributes in the [PolymerElements](https://github.com/polymerelements) organization. For any element-specific issues or pull requests, file directly on the element's repository, such as the `paper-button` repository at [github.com/polymerelements/paper-button](https://github.com/polymerelements/paper-button). Of course, the elements built by the Polymer team are just a tiny fraction of all the Polymer-based elements out there - catalogs of other web components include [https://www.webcomponents.org/](https://github.com/webcomponents/webcomponents.org) and [component.kitchen](https://component.kitchen).\n\nThe GoogleWebComponents element product line is maintained by teams all across Google, and so is kept in a separate organization: the [GoogleWebComponents](https://github.com/googlewebcomponents) org. Feel free to file issues and PR's on those elements directly in that organization.\n\nWe also track each element product line overall in \"meta-repos\", named as `$PRODUCTLINE-elements`. These include [paper-elements](https://github.com/polymerelements/paper-elements), [iron-elements](https://github.com/polymerelements/iron-elements), [gold-elements](https://github.com/polymerelements/gold-elements), and more. Feel free to file issues for element requests on those meta-repos, and the README in each repo tracks a roadmap for the product line.\n\n### Contributor License Agreement\n\nYou might notice our friendly CLA-bot commenting on a pull request you open if you haven't yet signed our CLA. We use the same CLA for all open-source Google projects, so you only have to sign it once. Once you complete the CLA, all your pull-requests will automatically get the `cla: yes` tag.\n\nIf you've already signed a CLA but are still getting bothered by the awfully insistent CLA bot, it's possible we don't have your GitHub username or you're using a different email address. Check the [information on your CLA](https://cla.developers.google.com/clas) or see this help article on [setting the email on your git commits](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git/).\n\n[Complete the CLA](https://cla.developers.google.com/clas)\n\n## Contributing\n\n### Filing bugs\n\nThe Polymer team heavily uses (and loves!) GitHub for all of our software management. We use GitHub issues to track all bugs and features.\n\nIf you find an issue, please do file it on the repository. The [Polymer/polymer issues](https://github.com/polymer/polymer/issues) should be used only for issues on the Polymer library itself - bugs somewhere in the core codebase.\n\nFor issues with elements the team maintains, please file directly on the element's repository. If you're not sure if a bug stems from the element or the library, err toward filing it on the element and we'll move the issue if necessary.\n\nPlease file issues using the issue template provided, filling out as many fields as possible. We love examples for addressing issues - issues with a jsBin, Plunkr, jsFiddle, or glitch.me repro will be much easier for us to work on quickly. You can start with [this jsbin](http://jsbin.com/luhaxab/edit) which sets up the basics to demonstrate a Polymer element.  If you need your repro to run in IE11, you can start from [this glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/polymer-repro?path=my-element.html:2:0), which serves the source via polyserve for automatic transpilation, although you must sign up for a glitch.me account to ensure your code persists for more than 5 days (note the glitch.me _editing environment_ is not compatible with IE11, however the \"live\" view link of the running code should work).\n\nOccasionally we'll close issues if they appear stale or are too vague - please don't take this personally! Please feel free to re-open issues we've closed if there's something we've missed and they still need to be addressed.\n\n### Contributing Pull Requests\n\nPR's are even better than issues. We gladly accept community pull requests. In general across the core library and all of the elements, there are a few necessary steps before we can accept a pull request:\n\n- Open an issue describing the problem that you are looking to solve in your PR (if one is not already open), and your approach to solving it. This makes it easier to have a conversation around the best general approach for solving your problem, outside of the code itself.\n- Sign the [CLA](https://cla.developers.google.com/clas), as described above.\n- Fork the repo you're making the fix on to your own GitHub account.\n- Code!\n- Ideally, squash your commits into a single commit with a clear message of what the PR does. If it absolutely makes sense to keep multiple commits, that's OK - or perhaps consider making two separate PR's.\n- **Include tests that test the range of behavior that changes with your PR.** If you PR fixes a bug, make sure your tests capture that bug. If your PR adds new behavior, make sure that behavior is fully tested. Every PR *must* include associated tests. (See [Unit tests](#unit-tests) for more.)\n- Submit your PR, making sure it references the issue you created.\n- If your PR fixes a bug, make sure the issue includes clear steps to reproduce the bug so we can test your fix.\n\nIf you've completed all of these steps the core team will do its best to respond to the PR as soon as possible.\n\n#### Contributing Code to Elements\n\nThough the aim of the Polymer library is to allow lots of flexibility and not get in your way, we work to standardize our elements to make them as toolable and easy to maintain as possible.\n\nAll elements should follow the [Polymer element style guide](https://www.polymer-project.org/3.0/docs/tools/documentation), which defines how to specify properties, documentation, and more. It's a great guide to follow when building your own elements as well, for maximum standardization and toolability. For instance, structuring elements following the style guide will ensure that they work with the [`iron-component-page`](https://github.com/polymerelements/iron-component-page) element, an incredibly easy way to turn any raw element directly into a documentation page.\n\n#### Contributing Code to the Polymer library\n\nWe follow the most common JavaScript and HTML style guidelines for how we structure our code - in general, look at the code and you'll know how to contribute! If you'd like a bit more structure, the [Google JavaScript Styleguide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javascriptguide.xml) is a good place to start.\n\nPolymer also participates in Google's [Patch Rewards Program](https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/patch-rewards/), where you can earn cold, hard cash for qualifying security patches to the Polymer library. Visit the [patch rewards page](https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/patch-rewards/) to find out more.\n\n## Unit tests\n\nAll Polymer projects use [`polymer-cli`](https://github.com/Polymer/tools/tree/master/packages/cli) for unit tests.\n\nFor maximum flexibility, install `polymer-cli` locally:\n\n    npm install -g polymer-cli\n\n### Running the Polymer library unit tests\n\nTo run the Polymer library unit tests:\n\n1.  Clone the [Polymer repo](https://github.com/polymer/polymer).\n\n2.  Install the dependencies:\n\n\t\tnpm install\n\n3.  Run the tests:\n\n\t\tnpm test\n\n    Or if you have `polymer-cli` installed locally:\n\n\t\tpolymer test --npm\n\nTo run individual test suites:\n\n<code>npm test <var>path/to/suite</var></code>\n\nOr:\n\n<code>polymer test --npm <var>path/to/suite</var></code>\n\nFor example:\n\n\tpolymer test --npm test/unit/polymer.element.html\n\nYou can also run tests in the browser:\n\n\tpolymer serve --npm\n\nNavigate to:\n\n[`http://localhost:8080/components/@polymer/polymer/test/runner.html`](http://localhost:8080/components/@polymer/polymer/test/runner.html)\n\n### Running Polymer element unit tests\n\nTo run the element unit tests, you need a global install of `polymer-cli` .\n\n1. Clone the element repo.\n\n1. Install the dependencies.\n\n       bower install\n\n1. Run the tests:\n\n       polymer test\n\n     Or run the tests in a browser:\n\n       polymer serve\n\n     Navigate to:\n\n     <code>http://localhost:8080/components/<var>element-name</var>/test/runner.html</code>\n\n### Configuring `web-component-tester`\n\nBy default, `polymer test` runs tests on all installed browsers. You can configure it\nto run tests on a subset of available browsers, or to run tests remotely using Sauce Labs.\n\nSee the [`web-component-tester` README](https://github.com/Polymer/tools/tree/master/packages/web-component-tester) for\ninformation on configuring the tool using by `polymer-cli` to run the tests.\n\n### Viewing the source documentation locally\n\nYou can view the updates you make to the source documentation locally with the following steps.\nMake sure to rerun step 1 after every change you make.\n\n1. Run `polymer analyze > analysis.json`\n\n1. Run `polymer serve`\n\n1. Open `http://127.0.0.1:PORT/components/polymer/` to view the documentation\n"

At Google I/O 2018 we announced a new Web Component base class, [`LitElement`](https://github.com/lit/lit), as a successor to the `PolymerElement` base class in this library.\n>\n> If you're starting a new project, we recommend that you consider using LitElement instead.\n>\n> If you have a project you've built with an earlier version of the Polymer library, we recommend that you [migrate](#about-polymer-30) to 3.0 for best compatibility with the JavaScript ecosystem. Thanks to the interoperability of Web Components, elements built with Polymer 3.0 and LitElement can be mixed and matched in the same app, so once you have updated your project to Polymer 3.0, you can migrate to LitElement incrementally, one element at a time.  See our blog post on the [Polymer Project roadmap](https://www.polymer-project.org/blog/2018-05-02-roadmap-update.html) for more information.\n\nPolymer lets you build encapsulated, reusable [Web Components](https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction) that work just like standard HTML elements, to use in building web applications.  Using a Web Component built with Polymer is as simple as importing its definition then using it like any other HTML element:\n\n```html\n<!-- Import a component -->\n<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/@polymer/paper-checkbox@next/paper-checkbox.js?module\" type=\"module\" ></script>\n\n<!-- Use it like any other HTML element -->\n<paper-checkbox>Web Components!</paper-checkbox>\n```\n\nWeb Components are now implemented natively on Safari and Chrome (~70% of installed browsers), and run well on Firefox, Edge, and IE11 using [polyfills](https://github.com/webcomponents/webcomponentsjs).  Read more [below](#overview).\n\n## Getting started\n\n * The easiest way to try out Polymer is to use one of these online tools:\n\n    * Runs in all [supported](#supported-browsers) browsers: [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/polymer-element-example?file=index.js), [Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/polymer-element-example?path=index.html)\n\n    * Runs in browsers with [JavaScript Modules](https://caniuse.com/#search=modules): [JSBin](https://jsbin.com/wuxejiz/edit?html,output),\n [CodePen](https://codepen.io/kevinpschaaf/pen/BxdErp?editors=1000).\n\n * You can also save [this HTML file](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/kevinpschaaf/8a5acbea7b25d2bb5e82eeea2b105669/raw/c3a86872f07603e2d0ddae736687e52a5c8c499f/index.html) to a local file and run it in any browser that supports [JavaScript Modules]((https://caniuse.com/#search=modules)).\n\n * When you're ready to use Polymer in a project, install it via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). To run the project in the browser,\n a module-compatible toolchain is required. We recommend installing the [Polymer CLI](https://github.com/Polymer/tools/tree/master/packages/cli) to and using its development server as follows.\n\n    1. Add Polymer to your project:\n\n        ```npm i @polymer/polymer```\n\n    1. Create an element by extending PolymerElement and calling `customElements.define` with your class (see the examples below).\n\n    1. Install the Polymer CLI:\n\n        ```npm i -g polymer-cli```\n\n    1. Run the development server and open a browser pointing to its URL:\n\n        ```polymer serve --npm```\n\n    > Polymer 3.0 is published on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@polymer/polymer) using JavaScript Modules.\n    This means it can take advantage of the standard native JavaScript module loader available in all current major browsers.\n    >\n    > However, since Polymer uses npm conventions to reference dependencies by name, a light transform to rewrite specifiers to URLs is required to run in the browser. The polymer-cli's development server `polymer serve`, as well as `polymer build` (for building an optimized app for deployment)  automatically handles this transform.\n\n    Tools like [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) can also be used to serve and/or bundle Polymer elements.\n\n\n## Minimal Example\n\n  1. Create a class that extends `PolymerElement`.\n  1. Implement a static `properties` getter that describes the element's public property/attribute API\n  (these automatically become observed attributes).\n  1. Then implement a `template` getter that returns an `HTMLTemplateElement` describing the element's rendering, including encapsulated styling and any property bindings.\n\n```html\n  <script src=\"node_modules/@webcomponents/webcomponents-loader.js\"></script>\n  <script type=\"module\">\n    import {PolymerElement, html} from '@polymer/polymer';\n\n    class MyElement extends PolymerElement {\n      static get properties() { return { mood: String }}\n      static get template() {\n        return html`\n          <style> .mood { color: green; } </style>\n          Web Components are <span class=\"mood\">[[mood]]</span>!\n        `;\n      }\n    }\n\n    customElements.define('my-element', MyElement);\n  </script>\n\n  <my-element mood=\"happy\"></my-element>\n```\n\n## Overview\n\nWeb components are an incredibly powerful new set of primitives baked into the web platform, and open up a whole new world of possibility when it comes to componentizing front-end code and easily creating powerful, immersive, app-like experiences on the web.\n\nPolymer is a lightweight library built on top of the web standards-based [Web Components](http://webcomponents.org/introduction) APIs, and makes it easier to build your very own custom HTML elements. Creating reusable custom elements - and using elements built by others - can make building complex web applications easier and more efficient.\n\nBy being based on the Web Components APIs built in the browser (or [polyfilled](https://github.com/webcomponents/webcomponentsjs) where needed), elements built with Polymer are:\n\n* Built from the platform up\n* Self-contained\n* Re-usable\n* Interoperable across frameworks\n\nAmong many ways to leverage custom elements, they can be particularly useful for building reusable UI components. Instead of continually re-building a specific navigation bar or button in different frameworks and for different projects, you can define this element once using Polymer, and then reuse it throughout your project or in any future project.\n\nPolymer provides a declarative syntax to easily create your own custom elements, using all standard web technologies - define the structure of the element with HTML, style it with CSS, and add interactions to the element with JavaScript.\n\nPolymer also provides optional two-way data-binding, meaning:\n\n1. When properties in the model for an element get updated, the element can update itself in response.\n2. When the element is updated internally, the changes can be propagated back to the model.\n\nPolymer is designed to be flexible, lightweight, and close to the web platform - the library doesn't invent complex new abstractions and magic, but uses the best features of the web platform in straightforward ways to simply sugar the creation of custom elements.\n\n## About Polymer 3.0\n\nPolymer 3.0 is now released to stable, and introduces a major change to how Polymer is distributed: from HTML Imports on Bower, to JS modules on npm.  Otherwise, the API is almost entirely backward compatible with Polymer 2.0 (the only changes are removing APIs related to HTML Imports like `importHref`, and converting Polymer's API to be module-based rather than globals-based).\n\nMigrating to Polymer 3.0 by hand is mostly mechanical:\n* Components should be defined in JS modules instead of in HTML\n* Templates should be encoded in JS modules using a `static get template()` getter on PolymerElement subclasses using the `html` tagged template literal function (which parses `HTMLTemplateElement`s out of strings in JS) rather than using `<template>` elements in a `<dom-module>`\n* All dependencies should be imported JS module imports rather than HTML Imports.\n\nHowever, the [`polymer-modulizer`](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-modulizer) tool automates the vast majority of this migration work.  Please see details on that repo for automated conversion of Polymer 2.0 apps and elements to Polymer 3.0.\n\n👀 **Looking for Polymer v2.x?** Please see [the v2 branch](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/tree/2.x).\n\n👀 **Looking for Polymer v1.x?** Please see [the v1 branch](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/tree/1.x).\n\n## Contributing\n\nThe Polymer team loves contributions from the community!
