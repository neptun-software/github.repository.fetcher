          "content": "# Customize\n\nHere we will give you some tips on how to customize the website. One important thing to note is that **ALL** the changes you make should be done on the **main** branch of your repository. The `gh-pages` branch is automatically overwritten every time you make a change to the main branch.\n\n## Project structure\n\nThe project is structured as follows, focusing on the main components that you will need to modify:\n\n```txt\n.\n├── 📂 assets/: contains the assets that are displayed in the website\n│   └── 📂 json/\n    │   └── 📄 resume.json: CV in JSON format (https://jsonresume.org/)\n├── 📂 _bibliography/\n│   └── 📄 papers.bib: bibliography in BibTeX format\n├── 📄 _config.yml: the configuration file of the template\n├── 📂 _data/: contains some of the data used in the template\n│   ├── 📄 cv.yml: CV in YAML format, used when assets/json/resume.json is not found\n│   ├── 📄 repositories.yml: users and repositories info in YAML format\n│   └── 📄 socials.yml: your social media and contact info in YAML format\n├── 📂 _includes/: contains code parts that are included in the main HTML file\n│   └── 📄 news.liquid: defines the news section layout in the about page\n├── 📂 _layouts/: contains the layouts to choose from in the frontmatter of the Markdown files\n├── 📂 _news/: the news that will appear in the news section in the about page\n├── 📂 _pages/: contains the pages of the website\n|   └── 📄 404.md: 404 page (page not found)\n├── 📂 _posts/: contains the blog posts\n├── 📂 _projects/: contains the projects\n└── 📂 _sass/: contains the SASS files that define the style of the website\n    ├── 📄 _base.scss: base style of the website\n    ├── 📄 _cv.scss: style of the CV page\n    ├── 📄 _distill.scss: style of the Distill articles\n    ├── 📄 _layout.scss: style of the overall layout\n    ├── 📄 _themes.scss: themes colors and a few icons\n    └── 📄 _variables.scss: variables used in the SASS files\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe configuration file [\\_config.yml](_config.yml) contains the main configuration of the website. Most of the settings is self-explanatory and we also tried to add as much comments as possible. If you have any questions, please check if it was not already answered in the [FAQ](FAQ.md).\n\n> Note that the `url` and `baseurl` settings are used to generate the links of the website, as explained in the [install instructions](INSTALL.md).\n\nAll changes made to this file are only visible after you rebuild the website. That means that you need to run `bundle exec jekyll serve` again if you are running the website locally or push your changes to GitHub if you are using GitHub Pages. All other changes are visible immediately, you only need to refresh the page.\n\n## Modifying the CV information\n\nThere are currently 2 different ways of generating the CV page content. The first one is by using a json file located in [assets/json/resume.json](assets/json/resume.json). It is a [known standard](https://jsonresume.org/) for creating a CV programmatically. The second one, currently used as a fallback when the json file is not found, is by using a yml file located in [\\_data/cv.yml](_data/cv.yml). This was the original way of creating the CV page content and since it is more human readable than a json file we decided to keep it as an option.\n\nWhat this means is, if there is no resume data defined in [\\_config.yml](_config.yml) and loaded via a json file, it will load the contents of [\\_data/cv.yml](_data/cv.yml). If you want to use the [\\_data/cv.yml](_data/cv.yml) file as the source of your CV, you must delete the [assets/json/resume.json](assets/json/resume.json) file.\n\n## Modifying the user and repository information\n\nThe user and repository information is defined in [\\_data/repositories.yml](_data/repositories.yml). You can add as many users and repositories as you want. Both informations are used in the `repositories` section.\n\n## Creating new pages\n\nYou can create new pages by adding new Markdown files in the [\\_pages](_pages/) directory. The easiest way to do this is to copy an existing page and modify it. You can choose the layout of the page by changing the [layout](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/layouts/) attribute in the [frontmatter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) of the Markdown file, and also the path to access it by changing the [permalink](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/permalinks/) attribute. You can also add new layouts in the [\\_layouts](_layouts/) directory if you feel the need for it.\n\n## Creating new blog posts\n\nTo create a new blog post, you can add a new Markdown file in the [\\_posts](_posts/) directory. The [name of the file must follow](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#creating-posts) the format `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`. The easiest way to do this is to copy an existing blog post and modify it. Note that some blog posts have optional fields in the [frontmatter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) that are used to enable specific behaviors or functions.\n\nIf you want to create blog posts that are not ready to be published, but you want to track it with git, you can create a [\\_drafts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#drafts) directory and store them there.\n\n## Creating new projects\n\nYou can create new projects by adding new Markdown files in the [\\_projects](_projects/) directory. The easiest way to do this is to copy an existing project and modify it.\n\n## Adding some news\n\nYou can add news in the about page by adding new Markdown files in the [\\_news](_news/) directory. There are currently two types of news: inline news and news with a link. News with a link take you to a new page while inline news are displayed directly in the about page. The easiest way to create yours is to copy an existing news and modify it.\n\n## Adding Collections\n\nThis Jekyll theme implements `collections` to let you break up your work into categories. The theme comes with two default collections: `news` and `projects`. Items from the `news` collection are automatically displayed on the home page. Items from the `projects` collection are displayed on a responsive grid on projects page.\n\nYou can easily create your own collections, apps, short stories, courses, or whatever your creative work is. To do this, edit the collections in the [\\_config.yml](_config.yml) file, create a corresponding folder, and create a landing page for your collection, similar to [\\_pages/projects.md](_pages/projects.md).\n\n## Adding a new publication\n\nTo add publications create a new entry in the [\\_bibliography/papers.bib](_bibliography/papers.bib) file. You can find the BibTeX entry of a publication in Google Scholar by clicking on the quotation marks below the publication title, then clicking on \"BibTeX\", or also in the conference page itself. By default, the publications will be sorted by year and the most recent will be displayed first. You can change this behavior and more in the `Jekyll Scholar` section in [\\_config.yml](_config.yml) file.\n\nYou can add extra information to a publication, like a PDF file in the `assets/pdfs/` directory and add the path to the PDF file in the BibTeX entry with the `pdf` field. Some of the supported fields are: `abstract`, `altmetric`, `annotation`, `arxiv`, `bibtex_show`, `blog`, `code`, `dimensions`, `doi`, `eprint`, `html`, `isbn`, `pdf`, `pmid`, `poster`, `slides`, `supp`, `video`, and `website`.\n\n### Author annotation\n\nIn publications, the author entry for yourself is identified by string array `scholar:last_name` and string array `scholar:first_name` in [\\_config.yml](_config.yml). For example, if you have the following entry in your [\\_config.yml](_config.yml):\n\n```yaml\nscholar:\n  last_name: [Einstein]\n  first_name: [Albert, A.]\n```\n\nIf the entry matches one form of the last names and the first names, it will be underlined. Keep meta-information about your co-authors in [\\_data/coauthors.yml](_data/coauthors.yml) and Jekyll will insert links to their webpages automatically. The co-author data format is as follows, with the last names lower cased and without accents as the key:\n\n```yaml\n\"adams\":\n  - firstname: [\"Edwin\", \"E.\", \"E. P.\", \"Edwin Plimpton\"]\n    url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Plimpton_Adams\n\n\"podolsky\":\n  - firstname: [\"Boris\", \"B.\", \"B. Y.\", \"Boris Yakovlevich\"]\n    url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Podolsky\n\n\"rosen\":\n  - firstname: [\"Nathan\", \"N.\"]\n    url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Rosen\n\n\"bach\":\n  - firstname: [\"Johann Sebastian\", \"J. S.\"]\n    url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach\n\n  - firstname: [\"Carl Philipp Emanuel\", \"C. P. E.\"]\n    url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Philipp_Emanuel_Bach\n```\n\nIf the entry matches one of the combinations of the last names and the first names, it will be highlighted and linked to the url provided. Note that the keys **MUST BE** lower cased and **MUST NOT** contain accents. This is because the keys are used to match the last names in the BibTeX entries, considering possible variations.\n\n### Buttons (through custom bibtex keywords)\n\nThere are several custom bibtex keywords that you can use to affect how the entries are displayed on the webpage:\n\n- `abbr`: Adds an abbreviation to the left of the entry. You can add links to these by creating a venue.yaml-file in the \\_data folder and adding entries that match.\n- `abstract`: Adds an \"Abs\" button that expands a hidden text field when clicked to show the abstract text\n- `altmetric`: Adds an [Altmetric](https://www.altmetric.com/) badge (Note: if DOI is provided just use `true`, otherwise only add the altmetric identifier here - the link is generated automatically)\n- `annotation`: Adds a popover info message to the end of the author list that can potentially be used to clarify superscripts. HTML is allowed.\n- `arxiv`: Adds a link to the Arxiv website (Note: only add the arxiv identifier here - the link is generated automatically)\n- `bibtex_show`: Adds a \"Bib\" button that expands a hidden text field with the full bibliography entry\n- `blog`: Adds a \"Blog\" button redirecting to the specified link\n- `code`: Adds a \"Code\" button redirecting to the specified link\n- `dimensions`: Adds a [Dimensions](https://www.dimensions.ai/) badge (Note: if DOI or PMID is provided just use `true`, otherwise only add the Dimensions' identifier here - the link is generated automatically)\n- `html`: Inserts an \"HTML\" button redirecting to the user-specified link\n- `pdf`: Adds a \"PDF\" button redirecting to a specified file (if a full link is not specified, the file will be assumed to be placed in the /assets/pdf/ directory)\n- `poster`: Adds a \"Poster\" button redirecting to a specified file (if a full link is not specified, the file will be assumed to be placed in the /assets/pdf/ directory)\n- `slides`: Adds a \"Slides\" button redirecting to a specified file (if a full link is not specified, the file will be assumed to be placed in the /assets/pdf/ directory)\n- `supp`: Adds a \"Supp\" button to a specified file (if a full link is not specified, the file will be assumed to be placed in the /assets/pdf/ directory)\n- `website`: Adds a \"Website\" button redirecting to the specified link\n\nYou can implement your own buttons by editing the [\\_layouts/bib.liquid](_layouts/bib.liquid) file.\n\n## Changing theme color\n\nA variety of beautiful theme colors have been selected for you to choose from. The default is purple, but you can quickly change it by editing the `--global-theme-color` variable in the [\\_sass/\\_themes.scss](_sass/_themes.scss) file. Other color variables are listed there as well. The stock theme color options available can be found at [\\_sass/\\_variables.scss](_sass/_variables.scss). You can also add your own colors to this file assigning each a name for ease of use across the template.\n\n## Adding social media information\n\nYou can add your social media links by adding the specified information at the `Social integration` section in the [\\_config.yml](_config.yml) file. This information will appear at the bottom of the `About` page.\n\n## Adding a newsletter\n\nYou can add a newsletter subscription form by adding the specified information at the `newsletter` section in the [\\_config.yml](_config.yml) file. To set up a newsletter, you can use a service like [Loops.so](https://loops.so/), which is the current supported solution. Once you have set up your newsletter, you can add the form [endpoint](https://loops.so/docs/forms/custom-form) to the `endpoint` field in the `newsletter` section of the [\\_config.yml](_config.yml) file.\n\nDepending on your specified footer behavior, the sign up form either will appear at the bottom of the `About` page and at the bottom of blogposts if `related_posts` are enabled, or in the footer at the bottom of each page.\n\n## Removing content\n\nSince this template have a lot of content, you may want to remove some of it. The easiest way to achieve this and avoid merge conflicts when updating your code (as [pointed by CheariX ](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/pull/2933#issuecomment-2571271117)) is to add the unwanted files to the `excludes` section in your `_config.yml` file instead of actually deleting them, for example:\n\n```yml\nexcludes:\n   ...\n  - _news/announcement_*.md\n  - _pages/blog.md\n  - _posts/\n  - _projects/?_project.md\n  - assets/jupyter/blog.ipynb\n```\n\nHere is a list of the main components that you may want to delete, and how to do it. Don't forget if you delete a page to update the `nav_order` of the remaining pages.\n\n### Removing the blog page\n\nTo remove the blog, you have to:\n\n- delete [\\_posts](_posts/) directory\n- delete blog page [\\_pages/blog.md](_pages/blog.md)\n- remove reference to blog page in our [\\_pages/dropdown.md](_pages/dropdown.md)\n- remove the `Blog` section in the [\\_config.yml](_config.yml) file and the related parts, like the `jekyll-archives` and `latest_posts`\n\nYou can also:\n\n- delete [\\_includes/latest_posts.liquid](_includes/latest_posts.liquid)\n- delete [\\_includes/related_posts.liquid](_includes/related_posts.liquid)\n- delete [\\_layouts/archive-category.liquid](_layouts/archive-category.liquid)\n- delete [\\_layouts/archive-tag.liquid](_layouts/archive-tag.liquid)\n- delete [\\_layouts/archive-year.liquid](_layouts/archive-year.liquid)\n- delete [\\_plugins/external-posts.rb](_plugins/external-posts.rb)\n- remove the `jekyll-archives` gem from the [Gemfile](Gemfile) and the `plugins` section in [\\_config.yml](_config.yml)\n- remove the `classifier-reborn` gem from the [Gemfile](Gemfile)\n\n### Removing the news section\n\nTo remove the news section, you can:\n\n- delete the [\\_news](_news/) directory\n- delete the file [\\_includes/news.liquid](_includes/news.liquid) and the references to it in the [\\_pages/about.md](_pages/about.md)\n- remove the `announcements` part in [\\_config.yml](_config.yml)\n- remove the news part in the `Collections` section in the [\\_config.yml](_config.yml) file\n\n### Removing the projects page\n\nTo remove the projects, you can:\n\n- delete the [\\_projects](_projects/) directory\n- delete the projects page [\\_pages/projects.md](_pages/projects.md)\n- remove reference to projects page in our [\\_pages/dropdown.md](_pages/dropdown.md)\n- remove projects part in the `Collections` section in the [\\_config.yml](_config.yml) file\n\nYou can also:\n\n- delete [\\_includes/projects_horizontal.liquid](_includes/projects_horizontal.liquid)\n- delete [\\_includes/projects.liquid](_includes/projects.liquid)\n\n### Removing the publications page\n\nTo remove the publications, you can:\n\n- delete the [\\_bibliography](_bibliography/) directory\n- delete the publications page [\\_pages/publications.md](_pages/publications.md)\n- remove reference to publications page in our [\\_pages/dropdown.md](_pages/dropdown.md)\n- remove `Jekyll Scholar` section in the [\\_config.yml](_config.yml) file\n\nYou can also:\n\n- delete the [\\_layouts/bib.liquid](_layouts/bib.liquid) file\n- delete [\\_includes/bib_search.liquid](_includes/bib_search.liquid)\n- delete [\\_includes/citation.liquid](_includes/citation.liquid)\n- delete [\\_includes/selected_papers.liquid](_includes/selected_papers.liquid)\n- delete [\\_plugins/google-scholar-citations.rb](_plugins/google-scholar-citations.rb)\n- delete [\\_plugins/hide-custom-bibtex.rb](_plugins/hide-custom-bibtex.rb)\n- delete [\\_plugins/inspirehep-citations.rb](_plugins/inspirehep-citations.rb)\n- remove the `jekyll-scholar` gem from the [Gemfile](Gemfile) and the `plugins` section in [\\_config.yml](_config.yml)\n\n### Removing the repositories page\n\nTo remove the repositories, you can:\n\n- delete the repositories page [\\_pages/repositories.md](_pages/repositories.md)\n- delete [\\_includes/repository/](_includes/repository/) directory\n\n## Adding Token for Lighthouse Badger\n\nTo add secrets for [lighthouse-badger](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/actions/workflows/lighthouse-badger.yml), create a [personal access token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token) and add it as a [secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) named `LIGHTHOUSE_BADGER_TOKEN` to your repository. The [lighthouse-badger documentation](https://github.com/MyActionWay/lighthouse-badger-workflows#lighthouse-badger-easyyml) specifies using an environment variable, but using it as a secret is more secure and appropriate for a PAT.\n\nAlso In case you face the error: \"Input required and not supplied: token\" in the Lighthouse Badger action, this solution resolves it.\n\n### Personal Access Token (fine-grained) Permissions for Lighthouse Badger:\n\n- **contents**: access: read and write\n- **metadata**: access: read-only\n\nDue to the necessary permissions (PAT and others mentioned above), it is recommended to use it as a secret rather than an environment variable.\n\n## Customizing fonts, spacing, and more\n\nYou can customize the fonts, spacing, and more by editing [\\_sass/\\_base.scss](_sass/_base.scss). The easiest way to try in advance the changes is by using [chrome dev tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/css) or [firefox dev tools](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/). In there you can click in the element and find all the attributes that are set for that element and where are they. For more information on how to use this, check [chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/css) and [firefox](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/page_inspector/how_to/examine_and_edit_css/index.html) how-tos, and [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0sgiwJyEu4).\n\n## Scheduled Posts\n\n`al-folio` contains a workflow which automatically publishes all posts scheduled at a specific day, at the end of the day (23:30). By default the action is disabled, and to enable it you need to go to `.github/workflows/` and find the file called `schedule-posts.txt`. This is the workflow file. For GitHub to recognize it as one (or to enable the action), you need to rename it to `schedule-posts.yml`.\n\nIn order to use this you need to save all of your \"Completed\" blog posts which are scheduled to be uploaded on a specific date, in a folder named `_scheduled/` in the root directory.\n\n> Incomplete posts should be saved in `_drafts/`\n\n### Name Format\n\nIn this folder you need to store your file in the same format as you would in `_posts/`\n\n> Example file name: `2024-08-26-This file will be uploaded on 26 August.md`\n\n### Important Notes\n\n- The scheduler uploads posts everyday at 🕛 23:30 UTC\n- It will only upload posts at 23:30 UTC of their respective scheduled days, It's not uploaded in 23:59 in case there are a lot of files as the scheduler must finish before 00:00\n- It will only upload files which follow the pattern `yyyy-mm-dd-title.md`\n  - This means that only markdown files will be posted\n  - It means that any markdown which do not follow this pattern will not be posted\n- The scheduler works by moving posts from the `_scheduled/` directory to `_posts/`, it will not post to folders like `_projects/` or `_news/`\n- The date in the name of the file is the day that file will be uploaded on\n  - `2024-08-27-file1.md` will not be posted before or after 27-August-2024 (Scheduler only works for posts scheduled on the present day)\n  - `2025-08-27-file2.md` will be posted exactly on 27-August-2025\n  - `File3.md` will not be posted at all\n  - `2026-02-31-file4.md` is supposed to be posted on 31-February-2026, but there is no 31st in February hence this file will never be posted either\n"

Isn't the website supposed to correctly deploy automatically?\n\nYes, if you are using release `v0.3.5` or later, the website will automatically and correctly re-deploy right after your first commit. Please make some changes (e.g., change your website info in `_config.yml`), commit, and push. Make sure to follow [deployment instructions](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio#deployment). (Relevant issue: [209](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/issues/209#issuecomment-798849211).)\n\n---\n\n### I am using a custom domain (e.g., `foo.com`). My custom domain becomes blank in the repository settings after each deployment. How do I fix that?\n\nYou need to add `CNAME` file to the `main` or `source` branch of your repository. The file should contain your custom domain name. (Relevant issue: [130](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/issues/130).)\n\n---\n\n### My webpage works locally. But after deploying, it fails to build and throws `Unknown tag 'toc'`. How do I fix that?\n\nMake sure you followed through the [deployment instructions](#deployment) in the previous section. You should have set the deployment branch to `gh-pages`. (Related issue: [1438](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/issues/1438).)\n\n---\n\n### My webpage works locally. But after deploying, it is not displayed correctly (CSS and JS are not loaded properly). How do I fix that?\n\nIf the website does not load the theme, the layout looks weird, and all links are broken, being the main page displayed this way:\n\n<img src=\"assets/img/template_error.png\" width=\"500\">\n\nmake sure to correctly specify the `url` and `baseurl` paths in `_config.yml`. Set `url` to `https://<your-github-username>.github.io` or to `https://<your.custom.domain>` if you are using a custom domain. If you are deploying a <ins>personal</ins> or <ins>organization</ins> website, leave `baseurl` **empty** (do **NOT** delete it). If you are deploying a project page, set `baseurl: /<your-project-name>/`. If all previous steps were done correctly, all is missing is for your browser to fetch again the site stylesheet. For this, you can:\n\n- press [Shift + F5 on Chromium-based](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/157179#zippy=%2Cwebpage-shortcuts) or [Ctrl + F5 on Firefox-based](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/keyboard-shortcuts-perform-firefox-tasks-quickly) browsers to reload the page ignoring cached content\n- clean your browser history\n- simply try it in a private session, here's how to do it in [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95464) and [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/private-browsing-use-firefox-without-history)\n\n---\n\n### Atom feed doesn't work. Why?\n\nMake sure to correctly specify the `url` and `baseurl` paths in `_config.yml`. RSS Feed plugin works with these correctly set up fields: `title`, `url`, `description` and `author`. Make sure to fill them in an appropriate way and try again.\n\n---\n\n### My site doesn't work when I enable `related_blog_posts`. Why?\n\nThis is probably due to the [classifier reborn](https://github.com/jekyll/classifier-reborn) plugin, which is used to calculate related posts. If the error states `Liquid Exception: Zero vectors can not be normalized...` or `sqrt': Numerical argument is out of domain - \"sqrt\"`, it means that it could not calculate related posts for a specific post. This is usually caused by [empty or minimal blog posts](https://github.com/jekyll/classifier-reborn/issues/64) without meaningful words (i.e. only [stop words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words)) or even [specific characters](https://github.com/jekyll/classifier-reborn/issues/194) you used in your posts. Also, the calculus for similar posts are made for every `post`, which means every page that uses `layout: post`, including the announcements. To change this behavior, simply add `related_posts: false` to the front matter of the page you don't want to display related posts on. Another solution is to disable the lsi (latent semantic indexing) entirely by setting the `lsi` flag to `false` in `_config.yml`. Related issue: [#1828](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/issues/1828).\n\n---\n\n### When trying to deploy, it's asking for github login credentials, which github disabled password authentication and it exits with an error. How to fix?\n\nOpen .git/config file using your preferred editor. Change the `https` portion of the `url` variable to `ssh`. Try deploying again.\n\n---\n\n### When I manually run the [Lighthouse Badger](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/actions/workflows/lighthouse-badger.yml) workflow, it fails with `Error: Input required and not supplied: token`. How do I fix that?\n\nYou need to [create a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token) and [add it as a secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) named `LIGHTHOUSE_BADGER_TOKEN` to your repository. For more information, check [lighthouse-badger documentation](https://github.com/MyActionWay/lighthouse-badger-workflows#lighthouse-badger-easyyml) on how to do this.\n\n---\n\n### My code runs fine locally, but when I create a commit and submit it, it fails with `prettier code formatter workflow run failed for main branch`. How do I fix that?\n\nWe implemented support for [Prettier code formatting](https://prettier.io/) in [#2048](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/pull/2048). It basically ensures that your code is [well formatted](https://prettier.io/docs/en/). If you want to ensure your code is compliant with `Prettier`, you have a few options:\n\n- if you are running locally with `Docker` and using [development containers](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/blob/main/INSTALL.md#local-setup-with-development-containers), `Prettier` is already included\n- if you don't use `Docker`, it is simple to integrate it with your preferred IDE using an [extension](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors)\n- if you want to run it manually, you can follow the first 2 steps in [this tutorial](https://george-gca.github.io/blog/2023/slidev_for_non_web_devs/) (`Installing node version manager (nvm)` and `Installing Node (latest version)`), then, install it using `npm install prettier` inside the project directory, or install it globally on your computer using `npm install -g prettier`. To run `Prettier` on your current directory use `npx prettier . --write`.\n\nYou can also disable it for your repo. For this, just delete the file [.github/workflows/prettier.yml](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/blob/main/.github/workflows/prettier.yml).\n\n---\n\n### After I update my site with some new content, even a small change, the GitHub action throws an error or displays a warning. What happened?\n\nProbably your GitHub workflow is throwing an error like this:\n\n```bash\n/opt/hostedtoolcache/Ruby/3.0.2/x64/lib/ruby/gems/3.0.0/gems/bundler-2.5.5/lib/bundler/runtime.rb:304:in `check_for_activated_spec!': You have already activated uri 0.10.1, but your Gemfile requires uri 0.13.0. Since uri is a default gem, you can either remove your dependency on it or try updating to a newer version of bundler that supports uri as a default gem. (Gem::LoadError)\n```\n\nor maybe displaying a warning like one of these:\n\n```\nNode.js 16 actions are deprecated. Please update the following actions to use Node.js 20: actions/checkout@v3. For more information see: https://github.blog/changelog/2023-09-22-github-actions-transitioning-from-node-16-to-node-20/.\nNode.js 16 actions are deprecated. Please update the following actions to use Node.js 20: actions/checkout@v2, actions/cache@v2. For more information see: https://github.blog/changelog/2023-09-22-github-actions-transitioning-from-node-16-to-node-20/.\nThe following actions uses node12 which is deprecated and will be forced to run on node16: actions/checkout@v2, actions/cache@v2. For more info: https://github.blog/changelog/2023-06-13-github-actions-all-actions-will-run-on-node16-instead-of-node12-by-default/\nThe `set-output` command is deprecated and will be disabled soon. Please upgrade to using Environment Files. For more information see: https://github.blog/changelog/2022-10-11-github-actions-deprecating-save-state-and-set-output-commands/\n```\n\nIf that's the case, you are using deprecated libraries/commands. This happens because you are using a very old version of al-folio. To fix this it is recommended [upgrading your code to the latest version](INSTALL.md#upgrading-from-a-previous-version) of the template. You will probably need to do some manual merging. If you find it easier, you could create a copy of your repository, do a fresh installation from the template and reapply all your changes. For this I would recommend a tool like [meld](https://meldmerge.org/) or [winmerge](https://winmerge.org/) to check the differences between directories/files.\n\nNote that libraries tend to be deprecated and support for them dropped as they are no longer maintained, and keep using them involves security breaches. Also, some of these deprecations are enforced, for example, by GitHub itself, so there's so much we can do. We have also added tons of new functionality, as well as tidying things up and improving the overall speed and structure, so you could also benefit from these improvements.\n\n---\n\n### I am trying to deploy my site, but it fails with `Could not find gem 'jekyll-diagrams' in locally installed gems`. How do I fix that?\n\n`jekyll-diagrams` support was dropped in [#1992](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/pull/1992) in favor of using `mermaid.js` directly. Simply [update your code](INSTALL.md#upgrading-from-a-previous-version) to get the latest changes.\n\n---\n\n### How can I update Academicons version on the template\n\nTo update the Academicons version, you need to download the latest release from the [Academicons website](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/). After downloading, extract the zip file and copy the files `academicons.ttf` and `academicons.woff` from the `fonts/` directory to `assets/fonts/` and the file `academicons.min.css` from the `css/` directory to `assets/css/`.\n\n---\n\n### How can I update Font Awesome version on the template\n\nTo update the Font Awesome version, you need to download the latest release \"for the web\" from the [Font Awesome website](https://fontawesome.com/download). After downloading, extract the zip file and copy the `scss/` directory content to `_sass/font-awesome/` and the `webfonts/` content to `assets/webfonts/`.\n\n---\n\n### How can I update Tabler Icons version on the template\n\nTo update the Tabler Icons version, you need to download the latest release from the [Tabler Icons website](https://tabler.io/icons). After downloading, extract the zip file and copy the files `tabler-icons-filled.scss`, `tabler-icons-outline.scss`, and `tabler-icons.scss` from the `webfont/` directory to `_sass/tabler-icons/`, and all the files from `webfont/fonts/` to `assets/fonts/`.\n\n---\n\n### What do all these GitHub actions/workflows mean?\n\nGitHub actions are a way to automate tasks in the repository. They are defined in `.github/workflows/` directory. Each file in this directory is a workflow. Workflows are made up of one or more jobs, and each job runs on a virtual machine hosted by GitHub. You can see the status of the workflows in the `Actions` tab of your repository. For more information, check the [GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).\n\nCurrently we have the following workflows:\n\n- `axe.yml`: does some accessibility testing in your site. It uses the [axe cli](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core-npm/tree/develop/packages/cli) tool with a chrome driver to render the webpage and allow the analysis. Must be run manually, since fixing some of the issues is not straightforward\n- `broken-links-site.yml`: checks for broken links in your built website with the [lychee-action](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee-action)\n- `broken-links.yml`: checks for broken links in your repository with the [lychee-action](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee-action)\n- `deploy-docker-tag.yml`: adds some metadata to the docker image and pushes it to Docker Hub\n- `deploy-image.yml`: deploys a new docker image with the latest changes to Docker Hub\n- `deploy.yml`: deploys the website to GitHub Pages\n- `docker-slim.yml`: deploys a smaller version of the docker image to Docker Hub with the [docker-slim-action](https://github.com/kitabisa/docker-slim-action)\n- `lighthouse-badger.yml`: runs a [lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse) test for your site with the [lighthouse-badger-action](https://github.com/MyActionWay/lighthouse-badger-action), saving the results in the repository for easy inspecting, as can be seen [here](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio?tab=readme-ov-file#lighthouse-pagespeed-insights). For more information on how to enable this workflow, check our [FAQ question about it](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/blob/main/FAQ.md#when-i-manually-run-the-lighthouse-badger-workflow-it-fails-with-error-input-required-and-not-supplied-token-how-do-i-fix-that)\n- `prettier-comment-on-pr.yml`: not working. For now, this action is disabled. It was supposed to run prettier on the PRs and comment on them with the changes needed. For more information, check [issue 2115](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/issues/2115)\n- `prettier.yml`: runs [prettier](https://prettier.io/) on the code to ensure it is well formatted. For more information, check our [FAQ question about it](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/blob/main/FAQ.md#my-code-runs-fine-locally-but-when-i-create-a-commit-and-submit-it-it-fails-with-prettier-code-formatter-workflow-run-failed-for-main-branch-how-do-i-fix-that)\n\n---\n\n### How can I use Google Search Console ID on the template?\n\nIn the configuration file `_config.yml` the tag `google-site-verification` should be updated to use this functionality. Here is how you can proceed,\n\n- Generate your HTML tag by following [https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9008080?hl=en#meta_tag_verification&zippy=%2Chtml-tag](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9008080?hl=en#meta_tag_verification&zippy=%2Chtml-tag) with URL prefix option.\n- In the verify ownership option choose HTML tag and copy the tag contents which should look like `<meta name=\"google-site-verification\" content=\"GoogleSearchConsoleID\" />`.\n- The string against `content` is the Google Search Console ID that can be used in the template. e.g. `google-site-verification: GoogleSearchConsoleID`. Now set the property `enable_google_verification: true`.\n\nIt looks like the Domain type property in the Google Search Console to verify the ownership of all URLs across all subdomains with GitHub Pages does not work.\n"

This way it is easier to pinpoint what causes a potential issue in case of a bug. The minimum steps required to create your own site are ([video tutorial here](assets/video/tutorial_al_folio.mp4)):\n\n1. Create a new repository using this template. For this, click on [Use this template -> Create a new repository](https://github.com/new?template_name=al-folio&template_owner=alshedivat) above the file list. If you plan to upload your site to `<your-github-username>.github.io`, note that the name of your repository :warning: **MUST BE** :warning: `<your-github-username>.github.io` or `<your-github-orgname>.github.io`, as stated in the [GitHub pages docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#types-of-github-pages-sites).\n2. In this new repository, go to `Settings -> Actions -> General -> Workflow permissions` and give `Read and write permissions` to GitHub Actions.\n3. Open file `_config.yml`, set `url` to `https://<your-github-username>.github.io` and leave `baseurl` **empty** (do NOT delete it), as `baseurl:`.\n4. Wait until the GitHub action with subtitle `Deploy site` finishes (check your repository **Actions** tab), which takes ~4 min. Now, in addition to the `main` branch, your repository has a newly built `gh-pages` branch.\n5. Finally, in the repository page go to `Settings -> Pages -> Build and deployment`, make sure that `Source` is set to `Deploy from a branch` and set the branch to `gh-pages` (NOT to main).\n6. Wait until the GitHub action `pages-build-deployment` finishes (check your repository **Actions** tab), which takes ~45s, then simply navigate to `https://<your-github-username>.github.io` in your browser. At this point you should see a copy of the theme's [demo website](https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/).\n   After everything is set up, you can download the repository to your machine and start customizing it. To do so, run the following commands:\n\n```bash\n$ git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git\n```\n\nStarting version [v0.3.5](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/releases/tag/v0.3.5), **al-folio** will automatically re-deploy your webpage each time you push new changes to your repository! :sparkles:\n\n## Local setup on Windows\n\nIf you are using Windows, it is **highly recommended** to use [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), which is a compatibility layer for running Linux on top of Windows. You can follow [these instructions](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-11-with-gui-support) to install WSL and Ubuntu on your machine. You only need to go up to the step 4 of the tutorial (you don't have to enable the optional `systemd` nor the graphical applications), and then you can follow the instructions below to install docker. You can install docker natively on Windows as well, but it has been having some issues as can be seen in [#1540](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/issues/1540), [#2007](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/issues/2007).\n\n## Local setup using Docker (Recommended)\n\nUsing Docker to install Jekyll and Ruby dependencies is the easiest way.\n\nYou need to take the following steps to get `al-folio` up and running on your local machine:\n\n- First, install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).\n- Finally, run the following command that will pull the latest pre-built image from DockerHub and will run your website.\n\n```bash\n$ docker compose pull\n$ docker compose up\n```\n\nNote that when you run it for the first time, it will download a docker image of size 400MB or so. To see the template running, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`. You should see a copy of the theme's demo website.\n\nNow, feel free to customize the theme however you like (don't forget to change the name!). Also, your changes should be automatically rendered in real-time (or maybe after a few seconds).\n\n> Beta: You can also use the slimmed docker image with a size below 100MBs and exact same functionality. Just use `docker compose -f docker-compose-slim.yml up`\n\n### Build your own docker image\n\n> Note: this approach is only necessary if you would like to build an older or very custom version of al-folio.\n\nBuild and run a new docker image using:\n\n```bash\n$ docker compose up --build\n```\n\n> If you want to update jekyll, install new ruby packages, etc., all you have to do is build the image again using `--force-recreate` argument at the end of the previous command! It will download Ruby and Jekyll and install all Ruby packages again from scratch.\n\nIf you want to use a specific docker version, you can do so by changing `latest` tag to `your_version` in `docker-compose.yaml`. For example, you might have created your website on `v0.10.0` and you want to stick with that.\n\n## Local Setup with Development Containers\n\n`al-folio` supports [Development Containers](https://containers.dev/supporting).\nFor example, when you open the repository with Visual Studio Code (VSCode), it prompts you to install the necessary extension and automatically install everything necessary.\n\n## Local Setup (Legacy, no longer supported)\n\nFor a hands-on walkthrough of running al-folio locally without using Docker, check out [this cool blog post](https://george-gca.github.io/blog/2022/running-local-al-folio/) by one of the community members!\n\nAssuming you have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) installed on your system (_hint: for ease of managing ruby gems, consider using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv)_), and also [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) (_hint: for ease of managing python packages, consider using a virtual environment, like [venv](https://docs.python.org/pt-br/3/library/venv.html) or [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)_).\n\n```bash\n$ bundle install\n# assuming pip is your Python package manager\n$ pip install jupyter\n$ bundle exec jekyll serve\n```\n\nTo see the template running, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:4000`. You should see a copy of the theme's [demo website](https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/). Now, feel free to customize the theme however you like. After you are done, remember to **commit** your final changes.\n\n## Deployment\n\nDeploying your website to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is the most popular option.\nStarting version [v0.3.5](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/releases/tag/v0.3.5), **al-folio** will automatically re-deploy your webpage each time you push new changes to your repository **main branch**! :sparkles:\n\n### For personal and organization webpages\n\n1. The name of your repository **MUST BE** `<your-github-username>.github.io` or `<your-github-orgname>.github.io`.\n2. In `_config.yml`, set `url` to `https://<your-github-username>.github.io` and leave `baseurl` empty.\n3. Set up automatic deployment of your webpage (see instructions below).\n4. Make changes to your main branch, commit, and push!\n5. After deployment, the webpage will become available at `<your-github-username>.github.io`.\n\n### For project pages\n\n1. In `_config.yml`, set `url` to `https://<your-github-username>.github.io` and `baseurl` to `/<your-repository-name>/`.\n2. Set up automatic deployment of your webpage (see instructions below).\n3. Make changes to your main branch, commit, and push!\n4. After deployment, the webpage will become available at `<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-repository-name>/`.\n\n### Enabling automatic deployment\n\n1. Click on **Actions** tab and **Enable GitHub Actions**; do not worry about creating any workflows as everything has already been set for you.\n2. Go to `Settings -> Actions -> General -> Workflow permissions`, and give `Read and write permissions` to GitHub Actions\n3. Make any other changes to your webpage, commit, and push to your main branch. This will automatically trigger the **Deploy** action.\n4. Wait for a few minutes and let the action complete. You can see the progress in the **Actions** tab. If completed successfully, in addition to the `main` branch, your repository should now have a newly built `gh-pages` branch. **Do NOT touch this branch!**\n5. Finally, in the **Settings** of your repository, in the Pages section, set the branch to `gh-pages` (**NOT** to `main`). For more details, see [Configuring a publishing source for your GitHub Pages site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#choosing-a-publishing-source).\n\nIf you keep your site on another branch, open `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` **on the branch you keep your website on** and change `on->push->branches` and `on->pull\\_request->branches` to the branch you keep your website on. This will trigger the action on pulls/pushes on that branch. The action will then deploy the website on the branch it was triggered from.\n\n### Manual deployment to GitHub Pages\n\nIf you need to manually re-deploy your website to GitHub pages, go to Actions, click \"Deploy\" in the left sidebar, then \"Run workflow.\"\n\n### Deploy on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)\n\n1. [Use this template -> Create a new repository](https://github.com/new?template_name=al-folio&template_owner=alshedivat).\n2. Netlify: **Add new site** -> **Import an existing project** -> **GitHub** and give Netlify access to the repository you just created.\n3. Netlify: In the deploy settings\n\n   - Set **Branch to deploy** to `main`\n   - **Base directory** is empty\n   - Set **Build command** to `sed -i \"s/^\\(baseurl: \\).*$/baseurl:/\" _config.yml && bundle exec jekyll build`\n   - Set **Publish directory** to `_site`\n\n4. Netlify: Add the following two **environment variables**\n\n   - | Key            | Value                                                                                  |\n     | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n     | `JEKYLL_ENV`   | `production`                                                                           |\n     | `RUBY_VERSION` | set to the Ruby version found in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (for example, `3.3.5`) |\n\n5. Netlify: Click **Deploy** and wait for the site to be published. If you want to use your own domain name, follow the steps in [this documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/custom-domains/).\n\n### Deployment to another hosting server (non GitHub Pages)\n\nIf you decide to not use GitHub Pages and host your page elsewhere, simply run:\n\n```bash\n$ bundle exec jekyll build\n```\n\nwhich will (re-)generate the static webpage in the `_site/` folder.\nThen simply copy the contents of the `_site/` directory to your hosting server.\n\nIf you also want to remove unused css classes from your file, run:\n\n```bash\n$ purgecss -c purgecss.config.js\n```\n\nwhich will replace the css files in the `_site/assets/css/` folder with the purged css files.\n\n**Note:** Make sure to correctly set the `url` and `baseurl` fields in `_config.yml` before building the webpage. If you are deploying your webpage to `your-domain.com/your-project/`, you must set `url: your-domain.com` and `baseurl: /your-project/`. If you are deploying directly to `your-domain.com`, leave `baseurl` blank, **do not delete it**.\n\n### Deployment to a separate repository (advanced users only)\n\n**Note:** Do not try using this method unless you know what you are doing (make sure you are familiar with [publishing sources](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#publishing-sources-for-github-pages-sites)). This approach allows to have the website's source code in one repository and the deployment version in a different repository.\n\nLet's assume that your website's publishing source is a `publishing-source` subdirectory of a git-versioned repository cloned under `$HOME/repo/`.\nFor a user site this could well be something like `$HOME/<user>.github.io`.\n\nFirstly, from the deployment repo dir, checkout the git branch hosting your publishing source.\n\nThen from the website sources dir (commonly your al-folio fork's clone):\n\n```bash\n$ bundle exec jekyll build --destination $HOME/repo/publishing-source\n```\n\nThis will instruct jekyll to deploy the website under `$HOME/repo/publishing-source`.\n\n**Note:** Jekyll will clean `$HOME/repo/publishing-source` before building!\n\nThe quote below is taken directly from the [jekyll configuration docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/options/):\n\n> Destination folders are cleaned on site builds\n>\n> The contents of `<destination>` are automatically cleaned, by default, when the site is built. Files or folders that are not created by your site will be removed. Some files could be retained by specifying them within the `<keep_files>` configuration directive.\n>\n> Do not use an important location for `<destination>`; instead, use it as a staging area and copy files from there to your web server.\n\nIf `$HOME/repo/publishing-source` contains files that you want jekyll to leave untouched, specify them under `keep_files` in `_config.yml`.\nIn its default configuration, al-folio will copy the top-level `README.md` to the publishing source. If you want to change this behavior, add `README.md` under `exclude` in `_config.yml`.\n\n**Note:** Do _not_ run `jekyll clean` on your publishing source repo as this will result in the entire directory getting deleted, irrespective of the content of `keep_files` in `_config.yml`.\n\n## Upgrading from a previous version\n\nIf you installed **al-folio** as described above, you can manually update your code by following the steps below:\n\n```bash\n# Assuming the current directory is <your-repo-name>\n$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio.git\n$ git fetch upstream\n$ git rebase v0.13.2\n```\n\nIf you have extensively customized a previous version, it might be trickier to upgrade.\nYou can still follow the steps above, but `git rebase` may result in merge conflicts that must be resolved.\nSee [git rebase manual](https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/about-git-rebase) and how to [resolve conflicts](https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/resolving-merge-conflicts-after-a-git-rebase) for more information.\nIf rebasing is too complicated, we recommend re-installing the new version of the theme from scratch and port over your content and changes from the previous version manually. You can use tools like [meld](https://meldmerge.org/)\nor [winmerge](https://winmerge.org/) to help in this process.\n"

started\n\nWant to learn more about Jekyll? Check out [this tutorial](https://www.taniarascia.com/make-a-static-website-with-jekyll/). Why Jekyll? Read [Andrej Karpathy's blog post](https://karpathy.github.io/2014/07/01/switching-to-jekyll/)! Why write a blog? Read [Rachel Thomas blog post](https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045).\n\n## Installing and Deploying\n\nFor installation and deployment details please refer to [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).\n\n## Customizing\n\nFor customization details please refer to [CUSTOMIZE.md](CUSTOMIZE.md).\n\n## Features\n\n### Light/Dark Mode\n\nThis template has a built-in light/dark mode. It detects the user preferred color scheme and automatically switches to it. You can also manually switch between light and dark mode by clicking on the sun/moon icon in the top right corner of the page.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"readme_preview/light.png\" width=400>\n<img src=\"readme_preview/dark.png\" width=400>\n</p>\n\n---\n\n### CV\n\nThere are currently 2 different ways of generating the CV page content. The first one is by using a json file located in [assets/json/resume.json](assets/json/resume.json). It is a [known standard](https://jsonresume.org/) for creating a CV programmatically. The second one, currently used as a fallback when the json file is not found, is by using a yml file located in [\\_data/cv.yml](_data/cv.yml). This was the original way of creating the CV page content and since it is more human readable than a json file we decided to keep it as an option.\n\nWhat this means is, if there is no resume data defined in [\\_config.yml](_config.yml) and loaded via a json file, it will load the contents of [\\_data/cv.yml](_data/cv.yml) as fallback.\n\n[![CV Preview](readme_preview/cv.png)](https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/cv/)\n\n---\n\n### People\n\nYou can create a people page if you want to feature more than one person. Each person can have its own short bio, profile picture, and you can also set if every person will appear at the same or opposite sides.\n\n[![People Preview](readme_preview/people.png)](https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/people/)\n\n---\n\n### Publications\n\nYour publications' page is generated automatically from your BibTex bibliography. Simply edit [\\_bibliography/papers.bib](_bibliography/papers.bib). You can also add new `*.bib` files and customize the look of your publications however you like by editing [\\_pages/publications.md](_pages/publications.md). By default, the publications will be sorted by year and the most recent will be displayed first. You can change this behavior and more in the `Jekyll Scholar` section in [\\_config.yml](_config.yml) file.\n\nYou can add extra information to a publication, like a PDF file in the [assets/pdf/](assets/pdf/) directory and add the path to the PDF file in the BibTeX entry with the `pdf` field. Some of the supported fields are: `abstract`, `altmetric`, `arxiv`, `bibtex_show`, `blog`, `code`, `dimensions`, `doi`, `eprint`, `html`, `isbn`, `pdf`, `pmid`, `poster`, `slides`, `supp`, `video`, and `website`.\n\n[![Publications Preview](readme_preview/publications.png)](https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/publications/)\n\n---\n\n### Collections\n\nThis Jekyll theme implements `collections` to let you break up your work into categories. The theme comes with two default collections: `news` and `projects`. Items from the `news` collection are automatically displayed on the home page. Items from the `projects` collection are displayed on a responsive grid on projects page.\n\n[![Projects Preview](readme_preview/projects.png)](https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/projects/)\n\nYou can easily create your own collections, apps, short stories, courses, or whatever your creative work is. To do this, edit the collections in the [\\_config.yml](_config.yml) file, create a corresponding folder, and create a landing page for your collection, similar to `_pages/projects.md`.\n\n---\n\n### Layouts\n\n**al-folio** comes with stylish layouts for pages and blog posts.\n\n#### The iconic style of Distill\n\nThe theme allows you to create blog posts in the [distill.pub](https://distill.pub/) style:\n\n[![Distill Preview](readme_preview/distill.png)](https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/blog/2021/distill/)\n\nFor more details on how to create distill-styled posts using `<d-*>` tags, please refer to [the example](https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/blog/2021/distill/).\n\n#### Full support for math & code\n\n**al-folio** supports fast math typesetting through [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) and code syntax highlighting using [GitHub style](https://github.com/jwarby/jekyll-pygments-themes). Also supports [chartjs charts](https://www.chartjs.org/), [mermaid diagrams](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/), and [TikZ figures](https://tikzjax.com/).\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/blog/2015/math/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"readme_preview/math.png\" width=400></a>\n<a href=\"https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/blog/2015/code/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"readme_preview/code.png\" width=400></a>\n</p>\n\n#### Photos, Audio, Video and more\n\nPhoto formatting is made simple using [Bootstrap's grid system](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/). Easily create beautiful grids within your blog posts and project pages, also with support for [video](https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/blog/2023/videos/) and [audio](https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/blog/2023/audios/) embeds:\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <a href=\"https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/projects/1_project/\">\n    <img src=\"readme_preview/photos-screenshot.png\" width=\"75%\">\n  </a>\n</p>\n\n---\n\n### Other features\n\n#### GitHub's repositories and user stats\n\n**al-folio** uses [github-readme-stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats) and [github-profile-trophy](https://github.com/ryo-ma/github-profile-trophy) to display GitHub repositories and user stats on the `/repositories/` page.\n\n[![Repositories Preview](readme_preview/repositories.png)](https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/repositories/)\n\nEdit the `_data/repositories.yml` and change the `github_users` and `github_repos` lists to include your own GitHub profile and repositories to the `/repositories/` page.\n\nYou may also use the following codes for displaying this in any other pages.\n\n```html\n<!-- code for GitHub users -->\n{% if site.data.repositories.github_users %}\n<div class=\"repositories d-flex flex-wrap flex-md-row flex-column justify-content-between align-items-center\">\n  {% for user in site.data.repositories.github_users %} {% include repository/repo_user.liquid username=user %} {% endfor %}\n</div>\n{% endif %}\n\n<!-- code for GitHub trophies -->\n{% if site.repo_trophies.enabled %} {% for user in site.data.repositories.github_users %} {% if site.data.repositories.github_users.size > 1 %}\n<h4>{{ user }}</h4>\n{% endif %}\n<div class=\"repositories d-flex flex-wrap flex-md-row flex-column justify-content-between align-items-center\">\n  {% include repository/repo_trophies.liquid username=user %}\n</div>\n{% endfor %} {% endif %}\n\n<!-- code for GitHub repositories -->\n{% if site.data.repositories.github_repos %}\n<div class=\"repositories d-flex flex-wrap flex-md-row flex-column justify-content-between align-items-center\">\n  {% for repo in site.data.repositories.github_repos %} {% include repository/repo.liquid repository=repo %} {% endfor %}\n</div>\n{% endif %}\n```\n\n---\n\n#### Theming\n\nA variety of beautiful theme colors have been selected for you to choose from. The default is purple, but you can quickly change it by editing the `--global-theme-color` variable in the `_sass/_themes.scss` file. Other color variables are listed there as well. The stock theme color options available can be found at [\\_sass/\\_variables.scss](_sass/_variables.scss). You can also add your own colors to this file assigning each a name for ease of use across the template.\n\n---\n\n#### Social media previews\n\n**al-folio** supports preview images on social media. To enable this functionality you will need to set `serve_og_meta` to `true` in your [\\_config.yml](_config.yml). Once you have done so, all your site's pages will include Open Graph data in the HTML head element.\n\nYou will then need to configure what image to display in your site's social media previews. This can be configured on a per-page basis, by setting the `og_image` page variable. If for an individual page this variable is not set, then the theme will fall back to a site-wide `og_image` variable, configurable in your [\\_config.yml](_config.yml). In both the page-specific and site-wide cases, the `og_image` variable needs to hold the URL for the image you wish to display in social media previews.\n\n---\n\n#### Atom (RSS-like) Feed\n\nIt generates an Atom (RSS-like) feed of your posts, useful for Atom and RSS readers. The feed is reachable simply by typing after your homepage `/feed.xml`. E.g. assuming your website mountpoint is the main folder, you can type `yourusername.github.io/feed.xml`\n\n---\n\n#### Related posts\n\nBy default, there will be a related posts section on the bottom of the blog posts. These are generated by selecting the `max_related` most recent posts that share at least `min_common_tags` tags with the current post. If you do not want to display related posts on a specific post, simply add `related_posts: false` to the front matter of the post. If you want to disable it for all posts, simply set `enabled` to false in the `related_blog_posts` section in [\\_config.yml](_config.yml).\n\n---\n\n#### Code quality checks\n\nCurrently, we run some checks to ensure that the code quality and generated site are good. The checks are done using GitHub Actions and the following tools:\n\n- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - check if the formatting of the code follows the style guide\n- [lychee](https://lychee.cli.rs/) - check for broken links\n- [Axe](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) (need to run manually) - do some accessibility testing\n\nWe decided to keep `Axe` runs manual because fixing the issues are not straightforward and might be hard for people without web development knowledge.\n\n## FAQ\n\nFor frequently asked questions, please refer to [FAQ.md](FAQ.md).\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions to al-folio are very welcome! Before you get started, please take a look at [the guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nIf you would like to improve documentation or fix a minor inconsistency or bug, please feel free to send a PR directly to `main`. For more complex issues/bugs or feature requests, please open an issue using the appropriate template.\n\n### Maintainers\n\nOur most active contributors are welcome to join the maintainers team.
