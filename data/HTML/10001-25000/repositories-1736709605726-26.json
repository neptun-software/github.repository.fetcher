This makes it possible to see the intermediate state after each post.\n\n**The code for the latest post is available [here][latest-post].**\n\n[latest-post]: https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os/tree/post-12\n\nYou can find the branch for each post by following the `(source code)` link in the [post list](#posts) below. The branches are named `post-XX` where `XX` is the post number, for example `post-03` for the _VGA Text Mode_ post or `post-07` for the _Hardware Interrupts_ post. For build instructions, see the Readme of the respective branch.\n\nYou can check out a branch in a subdirectory using [git worktree]:\n\n[git worktree]: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree\n\n```\ngit worktree add code post-10\n```\n\nThe above command creates a subdirectory named `code` that contains the code for the 10th post (\"Heap Allocation\").\n\n## Posts\n\nThe goal of this project is to provide step-by-step tutorials in individual blog posts.
