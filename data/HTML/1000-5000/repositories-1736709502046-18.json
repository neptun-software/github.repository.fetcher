For example, they never introduce you to how you can run the same algorithm on your own dataset. Or, how do you get the dataset if you want to solve a problem. Or, which algorithms do you use - Conventional ML, or Deep Learning? How do you evaluate your models performance? How do you write your own model, as opposed to choosing a ready made architecture? All these form fundamental steps in any Machine Learning pipeline, and it is these steps that take most of our time as ML practitioners. \\n\",\n    \"\\n\",\n    \"This tutorial breaks down the whole pipeline, and leads the reader through it step by step in an hope to empower you to actually use ML, and not just feel that it was not too hard.

Let's break it down step by step.\\n\",\n    \"\\n\",\n    \"### Q.1. what do we mean by Classification?\\n\",\n    \"\\n\",\n    \"In machine learning, the task of classification means to use the available data to learn a <i>function</i> which can assign a category to a data point. For example, assign a genre to a movie, like \\\"Romantic Comedy\\\", \\\"Action\\\", \\\"Thriller\\\". Another example could be automatically assigning a category to news articles, like \\\"Sports\\\" and \\\"Politics\\\". \\n\",\n    \"\\n\",\n    \"### More Formally \\n\",\n    \"\\n\",\n    \"#### Given:\\n\",\n    \"- A data point $x_i$ \\n\",\n    \"- A set of categories $y_1,y_2...y_n$ that $x_i$ can belong to. <br>\\n\",\n    \"\\n\",\n    \"#### Task : \\n\",\n    \"Predict the correct category $y_k$ for a new data point $x_k$ not present in the given dataset.\\n\",\n    \"\\n\",\n    \"#### Problem : \\n\",\n    \"We don't know how the $x$ and $y$ are related mathematically.\\n\",\n    \"\\n\",\n    \"#### Assumption : \\n\",\n    \"We assume there exists a function $f$ relating $x$ and $y$ i.e. $f(x_i)=y_i$\\n\",\n    \"\\n\",\n    \"#### Approach : \\n\",\n    \"Since $f$ is not known, we learn a function $g$, which approximates $f$. \\n\",\n    \"\\n\",\n    \"#### Important consideration : \\n\",\n    \"- If $f(x_i)=g(x_i)=y_i$ for all $x_i$, then the two functions $f$ and $g$ are exactly equal. Needless to say, this won't realistically ever happen, and we'll only be able to approximate the true function $f$ using $g$. This means, sometimes the prediction $g(x_i)$ will not be correct. And essentially, our whole goal is to find a $g$ which makes a really low number of such errors. That's basically all that we're trying to do. \\n\",\n    \"\\n\",\n    \"- For the sake of completeness, I should mention that this is a specific kind of learning problem which we call \\\"Supervised Learning\\\". Also, the idea that $g$ approximates $f$ well for data not present in our dataset is called \\\"Generalization\\\". It is absolutely paramount that our model generalizes, or else all our claims will only be true about data we already have and our predictions will not be correct. \\n\",\n    \"\\n\",\n    \"- We will look into generalization a little bit more a little ahead in the tutorial. \\n\",\n    \"\\n\",\n    \"- Finally, There are several other kinds, but supervised learning is the most popular and well studied kind.\"\n   ]\n  },\n  {\n   \"cell_type\": \"markdown\",\n   \"metadata\": {},\n   \"source\": [\n    \"### Q.2.

You can use any of the above 3 modalities to predict the genre - The video, the song itself, or the lyrics.

OR What do you mean by data being \\\"representative\\\"?\\n\",\n    \"Let's look at this from first principles. Mathematically, the premise of machine learning (to be precise, the strand of machine learning we'll be working with here) is that given input variable X, and an output variable y, **IF** there is a function such that g(X)=y, then if g is unknown, we can \\\"learn\\\" a function f which approximates g. At the very heart, its not at all different from what you may have earlier studied as \\\"curve fitting\\\". For example, if you're trying to predict someone's movie preferences then X can be information about the person's gender, age, nationality and so on, while y can be the genre they most like to listen to!\\n\",\n    \"\\n\",\n    \"Let's do a thought experiment. Consider the same example - I'm trying to predict people's movie preferences. I walk into a classroom today, and collect information about some students and their movie preferences. Now, I use that data to build a model. How well do you think I can predict my father's movie preferences? The answer is - probably not very well. Why? Intuitively, there was probably no one in the classroom who was my father's age. My model can tell me that as people go from age 18 to 30, they have a higher preference for documentaries over superhero movies. But does this trend continue at 55? Probably, they may start liking family dramas more. Probably they don't. In a nutshell, we cannot say with certainty, as our data tells us nothing about it. So, if the task was to make predictions about ANYONE's movie preferences, then the data collected from just undergraduates is NOT representative.\\n\",\n    \"\\n\",\n    \"Now, let's see why this makes sense Mathematically.

If all the data I collect is such that $x_1$ belongs to (80,100) and $x_2$ belongs to (80,100), the learned function will only be able to learn the \\\"yellow-green dipping bellow\\\" part of the function.  Our function will never be able to predict the behavior in the \\\"red\\\" regions of the true function.

Next layer learns to combine lines to form curves - Say, something like the outline of a face. These curves come together to form 3D objects. And so on.

Instead, it is common to pretrain a ConvNet on a very large dataset (e.g. ImageNet, which contains 1.2 million images with 1000 categories), and then use the ConvNet either as an initialization or a fixed feature extractor for the task of interest. ''\\n\",\n    \"\\n\",\n    \"There are three broad ways in which transfer learning or pre-training can be done. (The 2 concepts are different and to understand the difference clearly, I suggest you read the linked lecture thoroughly). The way we are going to about it is by using a pre-trained, released ConvNet as feature extractor. Take a ConvNet pretrained on ImageNet (a popular object detection dataset), remove the last fully-connected layer. After removing the last layer, what we have is just another neural network i.e. a stack of space tranformations. But, originally the output of this stack can be pumped into a single layer which can classify the image into categories like Car, Dog, Cat and so on.\\n\",\n    \"\\n\",\n    \"What this means, is that in the space this stack transforms the images to, all images which contain a \\\"dog\\\" are closer to each other, and all images containing a \\\"cat\\\" are closer.

This is a very meaningful feature engineering method! While this may not be ideal for genre prediction, it might be quite meaningful. For example, all posters with a gun or a car are probably action. While a smiling couple would point to romance or drama. The alternative would be to train the CNN from scratch which is fairly computationally intensive and involves a lot of tricks to get the CNN training to converge to the optimal space tranformation.\\n\",\n    \"\\n\",\n    \"This way, we can start off with something strong, and then build on top. We pump our images through the pre-trained network to extract the visual features from the posters. Then, using these features as descriptors for the image, and genres as the labels, we train a simpler neural network from scratch which learns to do simply classification on this dataset.

Or, which algorithms do you use - Conventional ML, or Deep Learning? How do you evaluate your models performance? How do you write your own model, as opposed to choosing a ready made architecture?

Let's break it down step by step.\\n\",\n    \"\\n\",\n    \"### Q.1. what do we mean by Classification?\\n\",\n    \"\\n\",\n    \"In machine learning, the task of classification means to use the available data to learn a <i>function</i> which can assign a category to a data point. For example, assign a genre to a movie, like \\\"Romantic Comedy\\\", \\\"Action\\\", \\\"Thriller\\\". Another example could be automatically assigning a category to news articles, like \\\"Sports\\\" and \\\"Politics\\\". \\n\",\n    \"\\n\",\n    \"### More Formally \\n\",\n    \"\\n\",\n    \"#### Given:\\n\",\n    \"- A data point $x_i$ \\n\",\n    \"- A set of categories $y_1,y_2...y_n$ that $x_i$ can belong to. <br>\\n\",\n    \"\\n\",\n    \"#### Task : \\n\",\n    \"Predict the correct category $y_k$ for a new data point $x_k$ not present in the given dataset.\\n\",\n    \"\\n\",\n    \"#### Problem : \\n\",\n    \"We don't know how the $x$ and $y$ are related mathematically.\\n\",\n    \"\\n\",\n    \"#### Assumption : \\n\",\n    \"We assume there exists a function $f$ relating $x$ and $y$ i.e. $f(x_i)=y_i$\\n\",\n    \"\\n\",\n    \"#### Approach : \\n\",\n    \"Since $f$ is not known, we learn a function $g$, which approximates $f$. \\n\",\n    \"\\n\",\n    \"#### Important consideration : \\n\",\n    \"- If $f(x_i)=g(x_i)=y_i$ for all $x_i$, then the two functions $f$ and $g$ are exactly equal. Needless to say, this won't realistically ever happen, and we'll only be able to approximate the true function $f$ using $g$. This means, sometimes the prediction $g(x_i)$ will not be correct. And essentially, our whole goal is to find a $g$ which makes a really low number of such errors. That's basically all that we're trying to do. \\n\",\n    \"\\n\",\n    \"- For the sake of completeness, I should mention that this is a specific kind of learning problem which we call \\\"Supervised Learning\\\". Also, the idea that $g$ approximates $f$ well for data not present in our dataset is called \\\"Generalization\\\". It is absolutely paramount that our model generalizes, or else all our claims will only be true about data we already have and our predictions will not be correct. \\n\",\n    \"\\n\",\n    \"- We will look into generalization a little bit more a little ahead in the tutorial. \\n\",\n    \"\\n\",\n    \"- Finally, There are several other kinds, but supervised learning is the most popular and well studied kind.\"\n   ]\n  },\n  {\n   \"cell_type\": \"markdown\",\n   \"metadata\": {},\n   \"source\": [\n    \"### Q.2. What's Multi-Modal Classification then?\\n\",\n    \"\\n\",\n    \"In the machine learning community, the term Multi-Modal is used to refer to multiple <i>kinds</i> of data. For example, consider a YouTube video. It can be thought to contain 3 different modalities -\\n\",\n    \"\\n\",\n    \"- The video frames (visual modality)\\n\",\n    \"- The audio clip of what's being spoken (audio modality)\\n\",\n    \"- Some videos also come with the transcription of the words spoken in the form of subtitles (textual modality)\\n\",\n    \"\\n\",\n    \"Consider, that I'm interested in classifying a song on YouTube as pop or rock. You can use any of the above 3 modalities to predict the genre - The video, the song itself, or the lyrics. But, needless to say, you can predict it much better if you could use all three simultaneously.

OR What do you mean by data being \\\"representative\\\"?\\n\",\n    \"Let's look at this from first principles. Mathematically, the premise of machine learning (to be precise, the strand of machine learning we'll be working with here) is that given input variable X, and an output variable y, **IF** there is a function such that g(X)=y, then if g is unknown, we can \\\"learn\\\" a function f which approximates g. At the very heart, its not at all different from what you may have earlier studied as \\\"curve fitting\\\". For example, if you're trying to predict someone's movie preferences then X can be information about the person's gender, age, nationality and so on, while y can be the genre they most like to listen to!\\n\",\n    \"\\n\",\n    \"Let's do a thought experiment. Consider the same example - I'm trying to predict people's movie preferences. I walk into a classroom today, and collect information about some students and their movie preferences. Now, I use that data to build a model. How well do you think I can predict my father's movie preferences? The answer is - probably not very well. Why? Intuitively, there was probably no one in the classroom who was my father's age. My model can tell me that as people go from age 18 to 30, they have a higher preference for documentaries over superhero movies. But does this trend continue at 55? Probably, they may start liking family dramas more. Probably they don't. In a nutshell, we cannot say with certainty, as our data tells us nothing about it. So, if the task was to make predictions about ANYONE's movie preferences, then the data collected from just undergraduates is NOT representative.\\n\",\n    \"\\n\",\n    \"Now, let's see why this makes sense Mathematically.

If all the data I collect is such that $x_1$ belongs to (80,100) and $x_2$ belongs to (80,100), the learned function will only be able to learn the \\\"yellow-green dipping bellow\\\" part of the function.  Our function will never be able to predict the behavior in the \\\"red\\\" regions of the true function.

It is not a 30 minute tutorial which teaches you how to \"Train your own neural network\" or \"Learn deep learning in under 30 minutes\". It's a full pipeline which you would need to do if you actually work with machine learning - introducing you to all the parts, and all the implementation decisions and details that need to be made. The dataset is not one of the standard sets like MNIST or CIFAR, you will make you very own dataset. Then you will go through a couple conventional machine learning algorithms, before finally getting to deep learning!\n\nIn the fall of 2016, I was a Teaching Fellow (Harvard's version of TA) for the graduate class on \"Advanced Topics in Data Science (CS209/109)\" at Harvard University. I was in-charge of designing the class project given to the students, and this tutorial has been built on top of the project I designed for the class.\n\n# UPDATE 24th October 2018\nThe tutorial has now been re-written in PyTorch thanks to Anshul Basia (https://github.com/AnshulBasia)\n\nYou can access the HTML here: https://spandan-madan.github.io/DeepLearningProject/PyTorch_version/Deep_Learning_Project-Pytorch.html\nand the IPython Notebook with the code in PyTorch here:https://github.com/Spandan-Madan/DeepLearningProject/blob/master/PyTorch_version/Deep_Learning_Project-Pytorch.ipynb\n\n\n\n# Citing if you use the work here\nIf you would like to use this work, please cite the work using the doi -\n[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.830003.svg)](http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.830003)\n\n# Reading/Viewing the Tutorial\nTo view the project as an HTML file, visit - https://spandan-madan.github.io/DeepLearningProject/\n\n# The Code\nIf you would like to access to Code, please go through the ipython notebook `Deep_Learning_Project.ipynb`\n\n# SETUP\n\nPython\n- We will be using Python 2.7. Primary reason is that Tensorflow is not compatible with python > 3.5, and some other libraries are not compatible with python 3.\n\nTo make setup easy, we are going to use conda.\n- Please install conda 3 from https://www.continuum.io/downloads\n- The repository has a conda config file which will make setting up super easy. It's the file `deeplearningproject_environment.yml`\n- Then create a new conda environment using the command with `conda env create -f deeplearningproject_environment.yml`\n- Now, you can activate the environment with: `source activate deeplearningproject`  \n- `jupyter notebook` \nIf all the isntallations go through, you are good to go! If not, here is a list of packages that need to be installed: `requests imDbPy wget tmdbsimple seaborn sklearn Pillow keras tensorflow h5py gensim nltk stop_words`\n\nPlease install imdbpy using 'pip install imdbpy==6.6' since earlier versions are broken\n### Setting up conda environment in jupyter notebook\nTo be able to run the environment you just created on a juputer notebook, first check that you have the python package `ipykernel` installed. If you don't simply install it using\n\n```bash\npip install ipykernel\n```\n\nNow, add this to your jupyter notebook using the command:\n\n```bash\npython -m ipykernel install --user --name deeplearningproject --display-name \"deeplearningproject\"\n```\n\nNeedless to say, remove all single quotes before running commands.\n\nGo to the directory and run jupyter notbeook by \"jupyter notebook\" and open the respective notebook on browser.\nTO install TMDB: pip install tmdbsimple\nUse \"import tmdbsimple as tmdb\"\n\n\n### Setting up a docker container with docker-compose\n\n#### Prerequisites\n* Docker https://docs.docker.com/install/\n* docker compose https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/\n\n#### Run docker-compose\nTo work with an isolate environment and be able to run it on many systems without troubles, you can run this docker-compose command:\n```bash\ndocker-compose up\n```\nIt will build `deeplearningproject` image according to Dockerfile. And then run dokcer container via docker-compose. See Docker and docker-compose docs for more informations :\n* https://docs.docker.com/\n* https://docs.docker.com/compose/\n\nThen access notebooks through your web browser at http://localhost:8888\n\nYou should notice that notebooks have been copied from root to notebooks folder to mount them into container via bind volume. Any changes you make, will be saved  on host (notebooks dir).\n\n#### Add packages\nYou can add conda or pip packages to image (and thus, container) by updating `deeplearningproject_environment.yml` file and then run\n```bash\ndocker-compose build\n```\nIt will build a new `deeplearningproject` image with new conda/pip packages installed. Stop your running container (`CTRL-C`) and then `docker-compose up` to rerun a fresh new container.\n\n\n# Known common bugs\nI will keep updating this as issues pop up on this repository.\n\n- One known bug is because Keras 2.0 is not compatible with some Keras 1.2 functionalities. You may run into errors with importing `VGG16`. If so, just update keras using the following command:\n```bash\nsudo pip install git+git://github.com/fchollet/keras.git --upgrade\n```\n\n-OS Error: Too Many Open Files\nRefer to: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16526783/python-subprocess-too-many-open-files\nor, shut down notebook and execute following the the same terminal\n``bash\nulimit -Sn 10000\n```\n\nAnd restart the jupyter notebook.\n\nHope this repo helps introduce you to a full machine learning pipeline! If you spot an error, please create an issue to help out others using this resource!\n\nTo prevent problems with installation and setting up, this repository comes with a conda environment profile. The only thing you will need is to install the newest version of conda, and use this profile to create a new environment and it will come set up with all the libraries you will need for the tutorial.\n\n"

I was in-charge of designing the class project given to the students, and this tutorial has been built on top of the project I designed for the class.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Why-write-yet-another-Tutorial-on-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning?\">Why write yet another Tutorial on Machine Learning and Deep Learning?<a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#Why-write-yet-another-Tutorial-on-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning?\">&#182;</a></h3><p>As a researcher on Computer Vision, I come across new blogs and tutorials on ML (Machine Learning) every day. However, most of them are just focussing on introducing the syntax and the terminology relavant to the field. For example - a 15 minute tutorial on Tensorflow using MNIST dataset, or a 10 minute intro to Deep Learning in Keras on Imagenet.</p>\n<p>While people are able to copy paste and run the code in these tutorials and feel that working in ML is really not that hard, it doesn't help them at all in using ML for their own purposes. For example, they never introduce you to how you can run the same algorithm on your own dataset. Or, how do you get the dataset if you want to solve a problem. Or, which algorithms do you use - Conventional ML, or Deep Learning? How do you evaluate your models performance? How do you write your own model, as opposed to choosing a ready made architecture? All these form fundamental steps in any Machine Learning pipeline, and it is these steps that take most of our time as ML practitioners.</p>\n<p>This tutorial breaks down the whole pipeline, and leads the reader through it step by step in an hope to empower you to actually use ML, and not just feel that it was not too hard. Needless to say, this will take much longer than 15-30 minutes. I believe a weekend would be a good enough estimate.</p>\n<h3 id=\"About-the-Author\">About the Author<a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#About-the-Author\">&#182;</a></h3><p>I am <a href=\"http://spandanmadan.com/\">Spandan Madan</a>, a graduate student at Harvard University working on Computer Vision.

For example, assign a genre to a movie, like \"Romantic Comedy\", \"Action\", \"Thriller\". Another example could be automatically assigning a category to news articles, like \"Sports\" and \"Politics\".</p>\n<h3 id=\"More-Formally\">More Formally<a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#More-Formally\">&#182;</a></h3><h4 id=\"Given:\">Given:<a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#Given:\">&#182;</a></h4><ul>\n<li>A data point $x_i$ </li>\n<li>A set of categories $y_1,y_2...y_n$ that $x_i$ can belong to. <br></li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"Task-:\">Task :<a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#Task-:\">&#182;</a></h4><p>Predict the correct category $y_k$ for a new data point $x_k$ not present in the given dataset.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Problem-:\">Problem :<a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#Problem-:\">&#182;</a></h4><p>We don't know how the $x$ and $y$ are related mathematically.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Assumption-:\">Assumption :<a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#Assumption-:\">&#182;</a></h4><p>We assume there exists a function $f$ relating $x$ and $y$ i.e. $f(x_i)=y_i$</p>\n<h4 id=\"Approach-:\">Approach :<a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#Approach-:\">&#182;</a></h4><p>Since $f$ is not known, we learn a function $g$, which approximates $f$.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Important-consideration-:\">Important consideration :<a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#Important-consideration-:\">&#182;</a></h4><ul>\n<li><p>If $f(x_i)=g(x_i)=y_i$ for all $x_i$, then the two functions $f$ and $g$ are exactly equal. Needless to say, this won't realistically ever happen, and we'll only be able to approximate the true function $f$ using $g$. This means, sometimes the prediction $g(x_i)$ will not be correct. And essentially, our whole goal is to find a $g$ which makes a really low number of such errors. That's basically all that we're trying to do.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>For the sake of completeness, I should mention that this is a specific kind of learning problem which we call \"Supervised Learning\". Also, the idea that $g$ approximates $f$ well for data not present in our dataset is called \"Generalization\". It is absolutely paramount that our model generalizes, or else all our claims will only be true about data we already have and our predictions will not be correct.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>We will look into generalization a little bit more a little ahead in the tutorial.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Finally, There are several other kinds, but supervised learning is the most popular and well studied kind.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered\">\n<div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"inner_cell\">\n<div class=\"text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html\">\n<h3 id=\"Q.2.-What's-Multi-Modal-Classification-then?\">Q.2. What's Multi-Modal Classification then?<a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#Q.2.-What's-Multi-Modal-Classification-then?\">&#182;</a></h3><p>In the machine learning community, the term Multi-Modal is used to refer to multiple <i>kinds</i> of data. For example, consider a YouTube video. It can be thought to contain 3 different modalities -</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The video frames (visual modality)</li>\n<li>The audio clip of what's being spoken (audio modality)</li>\n<li>Some videos also come with the transcription of the words spoken in the form of subtitles (textual modality)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Consider, that I'm interested in classifying a song on YouTube as pop or rock. You can use any of the above 3 modalities to predict the genre - The video, the song itself, or the lyrics. But, needless to say, you can predict it much better if you could use all three simultaneously.

Now, let's take a moment to discuss what the word representative mean.</p>\n<h3 id=\"What-data-is-good-data?-OR-What-do-you-mean-by-data-being-&quot;representative&quot;?\">What data is good data? OR What do you mean by data being \"representative\"?<a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#What-data-is-good-data?-OR-What-do-you-mean-by-data-being-&quot;representative&quot;?\">&#182;</a></h3><p>Let's look at this from first principles. Mathematically, the premise of machine learning (to be precise, the strand of machine learning we'll be working with here) is that given input variable X, and an output variable y, <strong>IF</strong> there is a function such that g(X)=y, then if g is unknown, we can \"learn\" a function f which approximates g. At the very heart, its not at all different from what you may have earlier studied as \"curve fitting\". For example, if you're trying to predict someone's movie preferences then X can be information about the person's gender, age, nationality and so on, while y can be the genre they most like to listen to!</p>\n<p>Let's do a thought experiment. Consider the same example - I'm trying to predict people's movie preferences. I walk into a classroom today, and collect information about some students and their movie preferences. Now, I use that data to build a model. How well do you think I can predict my father's movie preferences? The answer is - probably not very well. Why? Intuitively, there was probably no one in the classroom who was my father's age. My model can tell me that as people go from age 18 to 30, they have a higher preference for documentaries over superhero movies. But does this trend continue at 55? Probably, they may start liking family dramas more. Probably they don't. In a nutshell, we cannot say with certainty, as our data tells us nothing about it. So, if the task was to make predictions about ANYONE's movie preferences, then the data collected from just undergraduates is NOT representative.</p>\n<p>Now, let's see why this makes sense Mathematically. Look at the graph below.</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered\">\n<div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"inner_cell\">\n<div class=\"text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html\">\n<p><img src=\"contour.png\"></p>\n<center>Fig.1: Plot of a function we are trying to approximate(<a href=\"http://www.jzy3d.org/js/slider/images/ContourPlotsDemo.png\">source</a>)</center>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered\">\n<div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"inner_cell\">\n<div class=\"text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html\">\n<p>If we consider that the variable plotted on the vertical axis is $y$, and the values of the 2 variables on the horizontal axes make the input vector $X$, then, our hope is that we are able to find a function $f$ which can approximate the function plotted here. If all the data I collect is such that $x_1$ belongs to (80,100) and $x_2$ belongs to (80,100), the learned function will only be able to learn the \"yellow-green dipping bellow\" part of the function.  Our function will never be able to predict the behavior in the \"red\" regions of the true function. So, in order to be able to learn a good function, we need data sampled from a diverse set of values of $x_1$ and x2. That would be representative data to learn this contour.</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered\">\n<div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"inner_cell\">\n<div class=\"text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html\">\n<p>Therefore, we want to collect data which is representative of all possible movies that we want to make predictions about. Or else (which is often the case), we need to be aware of the limitations of the model we have trained, and the predictions we can make with confidence. The easiest way to do this is to only make predictions about the domain of data we collected the training data from. For example, in our case, let us start by assuming that our model will predict genres for only English movies. Now, the task is to collect data about a diverse collection of movies.</p>\n<p>So how do we get this data then? Neither google, nor any university has released such a dataset. We want to collect visual and textual data about these movies. The simple answer is to scrape it from the internet to build our own dataset. For the purpose of this project, we will use movie posters as our visual data, and movie plots as textual data. Using these, we will build a model that can predict movie genres!</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered\">\n<div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"inner_cell\">\n<div class=\"text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html\">\n<h1 id=\"We-will-be-scraping-data-from-2-different-movie-sources---IMDB-and-TMDB\">We will be scraping data from 2 different movie sources - IMDB and TMDB<a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#We-will-be-scraping-data-from-2-different-movie-sources---IMDB-and-TMDB\">&#182;</a></h1>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered\">\n<div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"inner_cell\">\n<div class=\"text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html\">\n<h3>IMDB:http://www.imdb.com/</h3><p>For those unaware, IMDB is the primary source of information about movies on the internet.

You do need an API key, but it can be obtained for free by just making a request after making a free account.</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered\">\n<div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"inner_cell\">\n<div class=\"text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html\">\n<h4 id=\"Note--\">Note -<a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#Note--\">&#182;</a></h4><p>IMDB gives some information for free through the API, but doesn't release other information about movies. Here, we will keep it legal and only use information given to us for free and legally. However, scraping does reside on the moral fence, so to say. People often scrape data which isn't exactly publicly available for use from websites.</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered\">\n<div class=\"input\">\n<div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">In&nbsp;[2]:</div>\n<div class=\"inner_cell\">\n    <div class=\"input_area\">\n<div class=\" highlight hl-ipython2\"><pre><span></span><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nn\">urllib2</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nn\">requests</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nn\">json</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nn\">imdb</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nn\">time</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nn\">itertools</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nn\">wget</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nn\">os</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nn\">tmdbsimple</span> <span class=\"kn\">as</span> <span class=\"nn\">tmdb</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nn\">numpy</span> <span class=\"kn\">as</span> <span class=\"nn\">np</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nn\">random</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nn\">matplotlib</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nn\">matplotlib.pyplot</span> <span class=\"kn\">as</span> <span class=\"nn\">plt</span>\n<span class=\"o\">%</span><span class=\"k\">matplotlib</span> inline\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nn\">seaborn</span> <span class=\"kn\">as</span> <span class=\"nn\">sns</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nn\">pickle</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered\">\n<div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"inner_cell\">\n<div class=\"text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html\">\n<h1 id=\"Here-is-a-broad-outline-of-technical-steps-to-be-done-for-data-collection\">Here is a broad outline of technical steps to be done for data collection<a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#Here-is-a-broad-outline-of-technical-steps-to-be-done-for-data-collection\">&#182;</a></h1><ul>\n<li>Sign up for TMDB (themoviedatabase.org), and set up API to scrape movie posters for above movies.</li>\n<li>Set up and work with TMDb to get movie information from their database</li>\n<li>Do the same for IMDb</li>\n<li>Compare the entries of IMDb and TMDb for a movie</li>\n<li>Get a listing and information of a few movies</li>\n<li>Think and ponder over the potential challenges that may come our way, and think about interesting questions we can answer given the API's we have in our hands.</li>\n<li>Get data from the TMDb</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let's go over each one of these one by one.</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered\">\n<div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"inner_cell\">\n<div class=\"text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html\">\n<h2 id=\"Signing-up-for-TMDB-and-getting-set-up-for-getting-movie-metadata.\">Signing up for TMDB and getting set up for getting movie metadata.<a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#Signing-up-for-TMDB-and-getting-set-up-for-getting-movie-metadata.\">&#182;</a></h2><ul>\n<li>Step 1.

Click on your account icon on the top right, then from drop down menu select \"Settings\".</li>\n<li>Step 3. On the settings page, you will see the option \"API\" on the left pane. Click on that.</li>\n<li>Step 4. Apply for a new developer key. Fill out the form as required. The fields \"Application Name\" and \"Application URL\" are not important. Fill anything there.</li>\n<li>Step 5. It should generate a new API key for you and you should also receive a mail.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now that you have the API key for TMDB, you can query using TMDB. Remember, it allows only 40 queries per 10 seconds.</p>\n<p>An easy way to respect this is to just have a call to <i>time.sleep(1)</i> after each iteration. This is also being very nice to the server.</p>\n<p>If you want to try and maximize your throughput you can embed every TMDB request in a nested try except block. If the first try fails, the second try first uses python's sleep function to give it a little rest, and then try again to make a request. Something like this -</p>\n\n<pre><code>try:\n    search.movie(query=movie) #An API request\nexcept:\n    try:\n        time.sleep(10) #sleep for a bit, to give API requests a rest.\n        search.movie(query=&lt;i&gt;movie_name&lt;/i&gt;) #Make second API request\n    except:\n        print \"Failed second attempt too, check if there's any error in request\"</code></pre>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered\">\n<div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"inner_cell\">\n<div class=\"text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html\">\n<h2 id=\"Using-TMDB-using-the-obtained-API-Key-to-get-movie-information\">Using TMDB using the obtained API Key to get movie information<a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#Using-TMDB-using-the-obtained-API-Key-to-get-movie-information\">&#182;</a></h2>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered\">\n<div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"inner_cell\">\n<div class=\"text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html\">\n<p>I have made these functions which make things easy.

It might be beneficial to see which genres co-occur, as it might shed some light on inherent biases in our dataset. For example, it would make sense if romance and comedy occur together more often than documentary and comedy. Such inherent biases tell us that the underlying population we are sampling from itself is skewed and not balanced. We may then take steps to account for such problems. Even if we don't take such steps, it is important to be aware that we are making the assumption that an unbalanced dataset is not hurting our performance and if need be, we can come back to address this assumption. Good old scientific method, eh?</p>\n<p>So for the top 1000 movies let's do some pairwise analysis for genre distributions. Our main purpose is to see which genres occur together in the same movie. So, we first define a function which takes a list and makes all possible pairs from it. Then, we pull the list of genres for a movie and run this function on the list of genres to get all pairs of genres which occur together</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell

In some ways, that would isolate the co-occurrence of some genres, and heighten the co-occurrence of others.</p>\n<p>While the data may not show that directly, we can play with the numbers to see if that's possible.

I will be picking my own version for the example, <strong>but it is imperative that you think this through, and come up with a version which excites you!</strong></p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered\">\n<div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"inner_cell\">\n<div class=\"text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html\">\n<p>As an example, here are some possible ways to frame Y, while still sticking to the problem of genre prediction -</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Assume every movie can have multiple genres, and then it becomes a multi-label classification problem. For example, a movie can be Action, Horror and Adventure simultaneously. Thus, every movie can be more than one genre.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Make clusters of genres as we did in Milestone 1 using biclustering, and then every movie can have only 1 genre. This way, the problem becomes a simpler, multi-class problem. For example, a movie could have the class - Uplifting (refer Milestone 1), or Horror or History. No movie get's more than one class.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the purposes of this implementation, I'm going with the first case explained above - i.e. a multi-label classification problem.</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered\">\n<div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"inner_cell\">\n<div class=\"text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html\">\n<p>Similarly, for designing our input features i.e. X, you may pick any features you think make sense, for example, the Director of a movie may be a good predictor for genre. OR, they may choose any features they design using algorithms like PCA. Given the richness of IMDB, TMDB and alternate sources like Wikipedia, there is a plethora of options available. <strong>Be creative here!</strong></p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered\">\n<div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"inner_cell\">\n<div class=\"text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html\">\n<p>Another important thing to note is that in doing so, we must also make many more small implementation decisions on the way.

This will be our Y.</li>\n<li>We will use 2 different kinds of X - text and images. </li>\n<li>For the text part - Input features being used to predict the genre is a form of the movie's plot available from TMDB using the property 'overview'.

For every sample, for every possible label, the representation is simply 1 if it has that label, and 0 if it doesn't have that label.

The basic idea of this representation in our context is that we can think of all the distinct words that are possible in the movies' reviews as a distinct object. And then every movie overview can be thought as a \"Bag\" containing a bunch of these possible objects.</p>\n<p>For example, in the case of Zootopia the movie above - The \"Bag\" contains the words (\"Determined\", \"to\", \"prove\", \"herself\"......\"the\", \"mystery\"). We make such lists for all movie overviews. Finally, we binarize again like we did above for Y. scikit-learn makes our job easy here by simply using a function CountVectorizer() because this representation is so often used in Machine Learning.</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered\">\n<div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"inner_cell\">\n<div class=\"text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html\">\n<p>What this means is that, for all the movies that we have the data on, we will first count all the unique words. Say, there's 30,000 unique words. Then we can represent every movie overview as a 30000x1 vector, where each position in the vector corresponds to the presence or absence of a particular word. If the word corresponding to that position is present in the overview, that position will have 1, otherwise it will be 0.</p>\n<p>Ex - if our vocabular was 4 words - \"I\",\"am\",\"a\",\"good\",\"boy\", then the representation for the sentence \"I am a boy\" would be [1 1 1 0 1], and for the sentence \"I am good\" would be [1 1 0 1 0].</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered\">\n<div class=\"input\">\n<div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">In&nbsp;[68]:</div>\n<div

is a stronger indicators of it being a Sci-Fi movie, than words like \"who\" or \"powerful\" or \"vast\". One way computer scientists working with natural language tackled this problem in the past (and it is still used very popularly) is what we call TF-IDF i.e. Term Frequence, Inverse Document Frequency. The basic idea here is that words that are strongly indicative of the content of a single document (every movie overview is a document in our case) are words that occur very frequently in that document, and very infrequently in all other documents. For example, \"Computer\" occurs twice here but probably will not in most other movie overviews. Hence, it is indicative. On the other hand, generic words like \"a\",\"and\",\"the\" will occur very often in all documents. Hence, they are not indicative.</p>\n<p>So, can we use this information to reduce our insanely high 30,000 dimensional vector representation to a smaller, more handle-able number? But first up, why should we even care? The answer is probably one of the most used phrases in ML - \"The Curse of Dimensionality\".</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered\">\n<div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"inner_cell\">\n<div class=\"text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html\">\n<h1 id=\"The-Curse-of-Dimensionality\">The Curse of Dimensionality<a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#The-Curse-of-Dimensionality\">&#182;</a></h1>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered\">\n<div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"inner_cell\">\n<div class=\"text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html\">\n<h4 id=\"This-section-is-strongly-borrowing-from-one-of-the-greatest-ML-papers-I've-ever-read.\">This section is strongly borrowing from one of the greatest <a href=\"https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~pedrod/papers/cacm12.pdf\">ML papers I've ever read.</a><a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#This-section-is-strongly-borrowing-from-one-of-the-greatest-ML-papers-I've-ever-read.\">&#182;</a></h4><p>This expression was coined by Bellman in 1961 to refer to the fact that many algorithms that work fine in low dimensions become intractable when the input is high-dimensional. The reason for them not working in high dimensions is very strongly linked to what we discussed earlier - having a representative dataset. Consider this, you have a function $f$ dependent only one dependent variable $x$, and $x$ can only integer values from 1 to 100. Since it's one dimensional, it can be plotted on a line. To get a representative sample, you'd need to sample something like - $f(1),f(20),f(40),f(60),f(80),f(100)$</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered\">\n<div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"inner_cell\">\n<div class=\"text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html\">\n<p>Now, let's increase the dimensionality i.e. number of dependent variables and see what happens. Say, we have 2 variables $x_1$ and $x_2$, same possible as before - integers between 1 and 100. Now, instead of a line, we'll have a plane with $x_1$ and $x_2$ on the two axes. The interesting bit is that instead of 100 possible values of dependent variables like before, we now have 100,000 possible values! Basically, we can make 100x100 table of possible values of $x_1$ and $x_2$. Wow, that increased exponentially. Not just figuratively, but mathematically exponentially. Needless to say, to cover 5% of the space like we did before, we'd need to sample $f$ at 5000 values.</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered\">\n<div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"inner_cell\">\n<div class=\"text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html\">\n<p>For 3 variables, it would be 100,000,000, and we'd need to sample at 500,000 points.

Even with a moderate dimension of 100 and a huge training set of a trillion examples, the latter covers only a fraction of about $10^{−18}$ of the input space. This is what makes machine learning\nboth necessary and hard.</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered\">\n<div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"inner_cell\">\n<div class=\"text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html\">\n<p>So, yes, if some words are unimportant, we want to get rid of them and reduce the dimensionality of our X matrix.

Firstly, what is it that you are trying to solve? For example, if you want to guess my music preferences and you try to train a super awesome model while giving it what my height is as input features, you're going to have no luck. On the other hand, giving it my Spotify playlist will solve the problem with any model. So, CONTEXT of the problem plays a role.</p>\n<p>Second, you can only represent based on the data at hand. Meaning, if you didn't have access to my Spotify playlist, but to my Facebook statuses - You know all my statuses about Harvard may not be useful. But if you represent me as my Facebook statuses which are YouTube links, that would also solve the problem. So, AVAILABILITY OF DATA at hand is the second factor.</p>\n<h4 id=\"A-nice-way-to-think-of-it-is-to-think-that-you-start-with-the-problem-at-hand,-but-design-features-constrained-by-the-data-you-have-available.-If-you-have-many-independent-features-that-each-correlate-well-with-the-class,-learning-is-easy.-On-the-other-hand,-if-the-class-is-a-very-complex-function-of-the-features,-you-may-not-be-able-to-learn-it.\">A nice way to think of it is to think that you start with the problem at hand, but design features constrained by the data you have available. If you have many independent features that each correlate well with the class, learning is easy. On the other hand, if the class is a very complex function of the features, you may not be able to learn it.<a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#A-nice-way-to-think-of-it-is-to-think-that-you-start-with-the-problem-at-hand,-but-design-features-constrained-by-the-data-you-have-available.-If-you-have-many-independent-features-that-each-correlate-well-with-the-class,-learning-is-easy.-On-the-other-hand,-if-the-class-is-a-very-complex-function-of-the-features,-you-may-not-be-able-to-learn-it.\">&#182;</a></h4><p>In the context of this problem, we would like to predict the genre of a movie. what we have access to - movie overviews, which are text descriptions of the movie plot. The hypothesis makes sense, overview is a short description of the story and the story is clearly important in assigning genres to movies.</p>\n<p>So, let's improve our features by playing with the words in the overviews in our data. One interesting way to go back to what we discussed earlier - TF-IDF. We originally used it to filter words, but we can also assign the tf-idf values as \"importance\" values to words, as opposed to treating them all equally. Tf-idf simply tries to identify the assign a weightage to each word in the bag of words.</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered\">\n<div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"inner_cell\">\n<div class=\"text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html\">\n<p>Once again, the way it works is - Most movie descriptions have the word \"The\" in it. Obviously, it doesn't tell you anything special about it. So weightage should be inversely proportional to how many movies have the word in their description. This is the IDF part.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, for the movie interstellar, if the description has the word Space 5 times, and wormhole 2 times, then it's probably more about Space than about wormhole. Thus, space should have a high weightage. This is the TF part.</p>\n<p>We simply use TF-IDf to assign weightage to every word in the bag of words.

For some values of $x_i$, the predictions will be wrong for sure, and we want to minimize it.</p>\n<p>For multi label systems, we often keep track of performance using \"Precision\" and \"Recall\".

This is for peope who don't have background in this - it's high level and gives just the intuition.</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered\">\n<div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"inner_cell\">\n<div class=\"text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html\">\n<p>As described above, the two most immportant concepts in doing good classification (or regression) are to 1) use the right representation which captures the right information about the data which is relavant to the problem at hand 2) Using the right model which has the capability of making sense of the representation fed to it.</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered\">\n<div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"inner_cell\">\n<div class=\"text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html\">\n<p>While for the second part we have complicated and powerful models that we have studied at length, we don't seem to have a principled, mathematical way of doing the first part - i.e. representation. What we did above was to see \"What makes sense\", and go from there. That is not a good approach for complex data/ complex problems. Is there some way to automate this?

Neural Networks, as we all know, are structures organized in layers. Layers of computations. Why do we need layers? Because these layers can be seen as sub-tasks that we do in the complicated task of identifying a chair. It can be thought as a heirarchical break down of a complicated job into smalled sub-tasks.</p>\n<p>Mathematically, each layer acts like a space transformation which takes the pixel values to a high dimensional space. When we start out, every pixel in the image is given equal importance in our matrix. With each layer, convolution operations give some parts more importance, and some lesser importance. In doing so, we transform our images to a space in which similar looking objects/object parts are closer (We are basically learning this space transformation in deep learning, nothing else)</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered\">\n<div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"inner_cell\">\n<div class=\"text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html\">\n<p>What exactly was learnt by these neural networks is hard to know, and an active area of research. But one very crude way to visualize what it does is to think like - It starts by learning very generic features in the first layer. Something as simple as vertical and horizontal lines. In the next layer, it learns that if you combine the vectors representing vertical and horizontal vectors in different ratios, you can make all possible slanted lines. Next layer learns to combine lines to form curves - Say, something like the outline of a face. These curves come together to form 3D objects. And so on. Building sub-modules, combining them in the right way which can give it semantics.</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered\">\n<div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"inner_cell\">\n<div class=\"text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html\">\n<p><strong>So, in a nutshell, the first few layers of a \"Deep\" network learn the right representation of the data, given the problem (which is mathematically described by your objective function trying to minimize difference between ground truth and predicted labels). The last layer simply looks how close or far apart things are in this high dimensional space.</strong></p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered\">\n<div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"inner_cell\">\n<div class=\"text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html\">\n<p>Hence, we can give any kind of data a high dimensional representation using neural networks. Below we will see high dimensional representations of both words in overviews (text) and posters (image). Let's get started with the posters i.e. extracting visual features from posters using deep learning.</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered\">\n<div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"inner_cell\">\n<div class=\"text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html\">\n<h1 id=\"Section-7---Deep-Learning-for-predicting-genre-from-poster\">Section 7 - Deep Learning for predicting genre from poster<a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#Section-7---Deep-Learning-for-predicting-genre-from-poster\">&#182;</a></h1><p>Once again, we must make an implementation decision. This time, it has more to do with how much time are we willing to spend in return for added accuracy. We are going to use here a technique that is commonly referred to as Pre-Training in Machine Learning Literature.</p>\n<p>Instead of me trying to re-invent the wheel here, I am going to borrow this short section on pre-training from Stanford University's lecture on <a href='http://cs231n.github.io/transfer-learning/'> CNN's</a>. To quote -</p>\n<p>''In practice, very few people train an entire Convolutional Network from scratch (with random initialization), because it is relatively rare to have a dataset of sufficient size. Instead, it is common to pretrain a ConvNet on a very large dataset (e.g. ImageNet, which contains 1.2 million images with 1000 categories), and then use the ConvNet either as an initialization or a fixed feature extractor for the task of interest. ''</p>\n<p>There are three broad ways in which transfer learning or pre-training can be done. (The 2 concepts are different and to understand the difference clearly, I suggest you read the linked lecture thoroughly). The way we are going to about it is by using a pre-trained, released ConvNet as feature extractor. Take a ConvNet pretrained on ImageNet (a popular object detection dataset), remove the last fully-connected layer. After removing the last layer, what we have is just another neural network i.e. a stack of space tranformations. But, originally the output of this stack can be pumped into a single layer which can classify the image into categories like Car, Dog, Cat and so on.</p>\n<p>What this means, is that in the space this stack transforms the images to, all images which contain a \"dog\" are closer to each other, and all images containing a \"cat\" are closer. Thus, it is a meaningful space where images with similar objects are closer.</p>\n<p>Think about it, now if we pump our posters through this stack, it will embed them in a space where posters which contain similar objects are closer. This is a very meaningful feature engineering method! While this may not be ideal for genre prediction, it might be quite meaningful. For example, all posters with a gun or a car are probably action. While a smiling couple would point to romance or drama. The alternative would be to train the CNN from scratch which is fairly computationally intensive and involves a lot of tricks to get the CNN training to converge to the optimal space tranformation.</p>\n<p>This way, we can start off with something strong, and then build on top. We pump our images through the pre-trained network to extract the visual features from the posters. Then, using these features as descriptors for the image, and genres as the labels, we train a simpler neural network from scratch which learns to do simply classification on this dataset. These 2 steps are exactly what we are going to do for predicting genres from movie posters.</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered\">\n<div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"inner_cell\">\n<div class=\"text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html\">\n<h2 id=\"Deep-Learning-to-extract-visual-features-from-posters\">Deep Learning to extract visual features from posters<a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#Deep-Learning-to-extract-visual-features-from-posters\">&#182;</a></h2>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered\">\n<div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"inner_cell\">\n<div class=\"text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html\">\n<p>The basic problem here we are answering is that can we use the posters to predict genre. First check - Does this hypothesis make sense? Yes. Because that's what graphic designers do for a living. They leave visual cues to semantics. They make sure that when we look at the poster of a horror movie, we know it's not a happy image. Things like that. Can our deep learning system infer such subtleties? Let's find out!</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered\">\n<div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"inner_cell\">\n<div class=\"text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html\">\n<p>For Visual features, either we can train a deep neural network ourselves from scratch, or we can use a pre-trained one made available to us from the Visual Geometry Group at Oxford University, one of the most popular methods. This is called the VGG-net. Or as they call it, we will extract the VGG features of an image. Mathematically, as mentioned, it's just a space transformation in the form of layers. So, we simply need to perform this chain of transformations on our image, right? Keras is a library that makes it very easy for us to do this. Some other common ones are Tensorflow and PyTorch. While the latter two are very powerful and customizable and used more often in practice, Keras makes it easy to prototype by keeping the syntax simple.</p>\n<p>We will be working with Keras to keep things simple in code, so that we can spend more time understanding and less time coding. Some common ways people refer to this step are - \"Getting the VGG features of an image\", or \"Forward Propogating the image through VGG and chopping off the last layer\". In keras, this is as easy as writing 4 lines.</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered\">\n<div class=\"input\">\n<div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">In&nbsp;[3]:</div>\n<div class=\"inner_cell\">\n    <div class=\"input_area\">\n<div class=\" highlight hl-ipython2\"><pre><span></span><span class=\"c1\"># Loading the list of movies we had downloaded posters for eariler - </span>\n<span class=\"n\">f</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"nb\">open</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;poster_movies.pckl&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;r&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"n\">poster_movies</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"n\">pickle</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">load</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">f</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"n\">f</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">close</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered\">\n<div class=\"input\">\n<div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">In&nbsp;[4]:</div>\n<div class=\"inner_cell\">\n    <div class=\"input_area\">\n<div class=\" highlight hl-ipython2\"><pre><span></span><span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"nn\">keras.applications.vgg16</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">VGG16</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"nn\">keras.preprocessing</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">image</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"nn\">keras.applications.vgg16</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">preprocess_input</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nn\">numpy</span> <span class=\"kn\">as</span> <span class=\"nn\">np</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nn\">pickle</span>\n<span class=\"n\">model</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">VGG16</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">weights</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;imagenet&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">include_top</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"bp\">False</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</pre></div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"output_wrapper\">\n<div class=\"output\">\n\n\n<div class=\"output_area\">\n<div class=\"prompt\"></div>\n\n<div class=\"output_subarea output_stream output_stderr output_text\">\n<pre>Using TensorFlow backend.\n</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing code_cell rendered\">\n<div class=\"input\">\n<div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">In&nbsp;[467]:</div>\n<div class=\"inner_cell\">\n    <div class=\"input_area\">\n<div class=\" highlight hl-ipython2\"><pre><span></span><span class=\"n\">allnames</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"n\">os</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">listdir</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">poster_folder</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"n\">imnames</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"n\">j</span> <span class=\"k\">for</span> <span class=\"n\">j</span> <span class=\"ow\">in</span> <span class=\"n\">allnames</span> <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"n\">j</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">endswith</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">&#39;.jpg&#39;</span><span class=\"p\">)]</span>\n<span class=\"n\">feature_list</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"p\">[]</span>\n<span class=\"n\">genre_list</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"p\">[]</span>\n<span class=\"n\">file_order</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"p\">[]</span>\n<span class=\"k\">print</span> <span class=\"s2\">&quot;Starting extracting VGG features for scraped images.

Introduction<a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#Section-1.-Introduction\">&#182;</a></h1><h3 id=\"Background\">Background<a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#Background\">&#182;</a></h3><p>In the fall of 2016, I was a Teaching Fellow (Harvard's version of TA) for the graduate class on \"Advanced Topics in Data Science (CS209/109)\" at Harvard University. I was in-charge of designing the class project given to the students, and this tutorial has been built on top of the project I designed for the class.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Why-write-yet-another-Tutorial-on-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning?\">Why write yet another Tutorial on Machine Learning and Deep Learning?<a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#Why-write-yet-another-Tutorial-on-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning?\">&#182;</a></h3><p>As a researcher on Computer Vision, I come across new blogs and tutorials on ML (Machine Learning) every day. However, most of them are just focussing on introducing the syntax and the terminology relevant to the field. For example - a 15 minute tutorial on Tensorflow using MNIST dataset, or a 10 minute intro to Deep Learning in Keras on Imagenet.</p>\n<p>While people are able to copy paste and run the code in these tutorials and feel that working in ML is really not that hard, it doesn't help them at all in using ML for their own purposes. For example, they never introduce you to how you can run the same algorithm on your own dataset. Or, how do you get the dataset if you want to solve a problem. Or, which algorithms do you use - Conventional ML, or Deep Learning? How do you evaluate your models performance? How do you write your own model, as opposed to choosing a ready made architecture? All these form fundamental steps in any Machine Learning pipeline, and it is these steps that take most of our time as ML practitioners.</p>\n<p>This tutorial breaks down the whole pipeline, and leads the reader through it step by step in an hope to empower you to actually use ML, and not just feel that it was not too hard. Needless to say, this will take much longer than 15-30 minutes. I believe a weekend would be a good enough estimate.</p>\n<h3 id=\"About-the-Author\">About the Author<a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#About-the-Author\">&#182;</a></h3><p>I am <a href=\"http://spandanmadan.com/\">Spandan Madan</a>, a graduate student at Harvard University working on Computer Vision. My research work is supervised collaboratively by Professor Hanspeter Pfister at Harvard, and Professor Aude Oliva at MIT. My current research focusses on using Computer Vision and Natural Language Techniques in tandem to build systems capable of reasoning using text and visual elements simultaneusly.</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered\"><div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">\n</div><div class=\"inner_cell\">\n<div class=\"text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html\">\n<h1 id=\"Section-2.-Project-Outline-:-Multi-Modal-Genre-Classification-for-Movies\">Section 2.

For example, assign a genre to a movie, like \"Romantic Comedy\", \"Action\", \"Thriller\". Another example could be automatically assigning a category to news articles, like \"Sports\" and \"Politics\".</p>\n<h3 id=\"More-Formally\">More Formally<a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#More-Formally\">&#182;</a></h3><h4 id=\"Given:\">Given:<a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#Given:\">&#182;</a></h4><ul>\n<li>A data point $x_i$ </li>\n<li>A set of categories $y_1,y_2...y_n$ that $x_i$ can belong to. <br></li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"Task-:\">Task :<a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#Task-:\">&#182;</a></h4><p>Predict the correct category $y_k$ for a new data point $x_k$ not present in the given dataset.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Problem-:\">Problem :<a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#Problem-:\">&#182;</a></h4><p>We don't know how the $x$ and $y$ are related mathematically.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Assumption-:\">Assumption :<a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#Assumption-:\">&#182;</a></h4><p>We assume there exists a function $f$ relating $x$ and $y$ i.e. $f(x_i)=y_i$</p>\n<h4 id=\"Approach-:\">Approach :<a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#Approach-:\">&#182;</a></h4><p>Since $f$ is not known, we learn a function $g$, which approximates $f$.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Important-consideration-:\">Important consideration :<a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#Important-consideration-:\">&#182;</a></h4><ul>\n<li><p>If $f(x_i)=g(x_i)=y_i$ for all $x_i$, then the two functions $f$ and $g$ are exactly equal. Needless to say, this won't realistically ever happen, and we'll only be able to approximate the true function $f$ using $g$. This means, sometimes the prediction $g(x_i)$ will not be correct. And essentially, our whole goal is to find a $g$ which makes a really low number of such errors. That's basically all that we're trying to do.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>For the sake of completeness, I should mention that this is a specific kind of learning problem which we call \"Supervised Learning\". Also, the idea that $g$ approximates $f$ well for data not present in our dataset is called \"Generalization\". It is absolutely paramount that our model generalizes, or else all our claims will only be true about data we already have and our predictions will not be correct.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>We will look into generalization a little bit more a little ahead in the tutorial.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Finally, There are several other kinds, but supervised learning is the most popular and well studied kind.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered\"><div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">\n</div><div class=\"inner_cell\">\n<div class=\"text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html\">\n<h3 id=\"Q.2.-What's-Multi-Modal-Classification-then?\">Q.2. What's Multi-Modal Classification then?<a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#Q.2.-What's-Multi-Modal-Classification-then?\">&#182;</a></h3><p>In the machine learning community, the term Multi-Modal is used to refer to multiple <i>kinds</i> of data. For example, consider a YouTube video. It can be thought to contain 3 different modalities -</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The video frames (visual modality)</li>\n<li>The audio clip of what's being spoken (audio modality)</li>\n<li>Some videos also come with the transcription of the words spoken in the form of subtitles (textual modality)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Consider, that I'm interested in classifying a song on YouTube as pop or rock. You can use any of the above 3 modalities to predict the genre - The video, the song itself, or the lyrics. But, needless to say, you can predict it much better if you could use all three simultaneously. This is what we mean by multi-modal classification.</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered\"><div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">\n</div><div class=\"inner_cell\">\n<div class=\"text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html\">\n<h1 id=\"For-this-project,-we-will-be-using-visual-and-textual-data-to-classify-movie-genres.\">For this project, we will be using visual and textual data to classify movie genres.<a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#For-this-project,-we-will-be-using-visual-and-textual-data-to-classify-movie-genres.\">&#182;</a></h1>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered\"><div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">\n</div><div class=\"inner_cell\">\n<div class=\"text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html\">\n<h1 id=\"Project-Outline\">Project Outline<a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#Project-Outline\">&#182;</a></h1><ul>\n<li><strong>Scraping a dataset</strong> : The first step is to build a rich data set.

Now, let's take a moment to discuss what the word representative mean.</p>\n<h3 id=\"What-data-is-good-data?-OR-What-do-you-mean-by-data-being-&quot;representative&quot;?\">What data is good data? OR What do you mean by data being \"representative\"?<a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#What-data-is-good-data?-OR-What-do-you-mean-by-data-being-&quot;representative&quot;?\">&#182;</a></h3><p>Let's look at this from first principles. Mathematically, the premise of machine learning (to be precise, the strand of machine learning we'll be working with here) is that given input variable X, and an output variable y, <strong>IF</strong> there is a function such that g(X)=y, then if g is unknown, we can \"learn\" a function f which approximates g. At the very heart, its not at all different from what you may have earlier studied as \"curve fitting\". For example, if you're trying to predict someone's movie preferences then X can be information about the person's gender, age, nationality and so on, while y can be the genre they most like to listen to!</p>\n<p>Let's do a thought experiment. Consider the same example - I'm trying to predict people's movie preferences. I walk into a classroom today, and collect information about some students and their movie preferences. Now, I use that data to build a model. How well do you think I can predict my father's movie preferences? The answer is - probably not very well. Why? Intuitively, there was probably no one in the classroom who was my father's age. My model can tell me that as people go from age 18 to 30, they have a higher preference for documentaries over superhero movies. But does this trend continue at 55? Probably, they may start liking family dramas more. Probably they don't. In a nutshell, we cannot say with certainty, as our data tells us nothing about it. So, if the task was to make predictions about ANYONE's movie preferences, then the data collected from just undergraduates is NOT representative.</p>\n<p>Now, let's see why this makes sense Mathematically. Look at the graph below.</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered\"><div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">\n</div><div class=\"inner_cell\">\n<div class=\"text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html\">\n<p><img src=\"contour.png\"></p>\n<center>Fig.1: Plot of a function we are trying to approximate(<a href=\"http://www.jzy3d.org/js/slider/images/ContourPlotsDemo.png\">source</a>)</center>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered\"><div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">\n</div><div class=\"inner_cell\">\n<div class=\"text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html\">\n<p>If we consider that the variable plotted on the vertical axis is $y$, and the values of the 2 variables on the horizontal axes make the input vector $X$, then, our hope is that we are able to find a function $f$ which can approximate the function plotted here. If all the data I collect is such that $x_1$ belongs to (80,100) and $x_2$ belongs to (80,100), the learned function will only be able to learn the \"yellow-green dipping bellow\" part of the function.  Our function will never be able to predict the behavior in the \"red\" regions of the true function. So, in order to be able to learn a good function, we need data sampled from a diverse set of values of $x_1$ and x2. That would be representative data to learn this contour.</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered\"><div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">\n</div><div class=\"inner_cell\">\n<div class=\"text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html\">\n<p>Therefore, we want to collect data which is representative of all possible movies that we want to make predictions about. Or else (which is often the case), we need to be aware of the limitations of the model we have trained, and the predictions we can make with confidence. The easiest way to do this is to only make predictions about the domain of data we collected the training data from. For example, in our case, let us start by assuming that our model will predict genres for only English movies. Now, the task is to collect data about a diverse collection of movies.</p>\n<p>So how do we get this data then? Neither google, nor any university has released such a dataset. We want to collect visual and textual data about these movies. The simple answer is to scrape it from the internet to build our own dataset. For the purpose of this project, we will use movie posters as our visual data, and movie plots as textual data. Using these, we will build a model that can predict movie genres!</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered\"><div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">\n</div><div class=\"inner_cell\">\n<div class=\"text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html\">\n<h1 id=\"We-will-be-scraping-data-from-2-different-movie-sources---IMDB-and-TMDB\">We will be scraping data from 2 different movie sources - IMDB and TMDB<a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#We-will-be-scraping-data-from-2-different-movie-sources---IMDB-and-TMDB\">&#182;</a></h1>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered\"><div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">\n</div><div class=\"inner_cell\">\n<div class=\"text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html\">\n<h3>IMDB:http://www.imdb.com/</h3><p>For those unaware, IMDB is the primary source of information about movies on the internet.

This is also being very nice to the server.</p>\n<p>If you want to try and maximize your throughput you can embed every TMDB request in a nested try except block. If the first try fails, the second try first uses python's sleep function to give it a little rest, and then try again to make a request.

It might be beneficial to see which genres co-occur, as it might shed some light on inherent biases in our dataset. For example, it would make sense if romance and comedy occur together more often than documentary and comedy. Such inherent biases tell us that the underlying population we are sampling from itself is skewed and not balanced. We may then take steps to account for such problems. Even if we don't take such steps, it is important to be aware that we are making the assumption that an unbalanced dataset is not hurting our performance and if need be, we can come back to address this assumption. Good old scientific method, eh?</p>\n<p>So for the top 1000 movies let's do some pairwise analysis for genre distributions. Our main purpose is to see which genres occur together in the same movie. So, we first define a function which takes a list and makes all possible pairs from it. Then, we pull the list of genres for a movie and run this function on the list of genres to get all pairs of genres which occur together</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell

In some ways, that would isolate the co-occurrence of some genres, and heighten the co-occurrence of others.</p>\n<p>While the data may not show that directly, we can play with the numbers to see if that's possible.

For example, a movie can be Action, Horror and Adventure simultaneously. Thus, every movie can be more than one genre.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Make clusters of genres as we did in Milestone 1 using biclustering, and then every movie can have only 1 genre. This way, the problem becomes a simpler, multi-class problem. For example, a movie could have the class - Uplifting (refer Milestone 1), or Horror or History. No movie get's more than one class.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the purposes of this implementation, I'm going with the first case explained above - i.e. a multi-label classification problem.</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered\"><div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">\n</div><div class=\"inner_cell\">\n<div class=\"text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html\">\n<p>Similarly, for designing our input features i.e. X, you may pick any features you think make sense, for example, the Director of a movie may be a good predictor for genre. OR, they may choose any features they design using algorithms like PCA. Given the richness of IMDB, TMDB and alternate sources like Wikipedia, there is a plethora of options available. <strong>Be creative here!</strong></p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered\"><div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">\n</div><div class=\"inner_cell\">\n<div class=\"text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html\">\n<p>Another important thing to note is that in doing so, we must also make many more small implementation decisions on the way.

We make such lists for all movie overviews.

\"computer\" is a stronger indicators of it being a Sci-Fi movie, than words like \"who\" or \"powerful\" or \"vast\". One way computer scientists working with natural language tackled this problem in the past (and it is still used very popularly) is what we call TF-IDF i.e. Term Frequence, Inverse Document Frequency. The basic idea here is that words that are strongly indicative of the content of a single document (every movie overview is a document in our case) are words that occur very frequently in that document, and very infrequently in all other documents. For example, \"Computer\" occurs twice here but probably will not in most other movie overviews. Hence, it is indicative. On the other hand, generic words like \"a\",\"and\",\"the\" will occur very often in all documents. Hence, they are not indicative.</p>\n<p>So, can we use this information to reduce our insanely high 30,000 dimensional vector representation to a smaller, more handle-able number?

The reason for them not working in high dimensions is very strongly linked to what we discussed earlier - having a representative dataset. Consider this, you have a function $f$ dependent only one dependent variable $x$, and $x$ can only integer values from 1 to 100. Since it's one dimensional, it can be plotted on a line. To get a representative sample, you'd need to sample something like - $f(1),f(20),f(40),f(60),f(80),f(100)$</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered\"><div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">\n</div><div class=\"inner_cell\">\n<div class=\"text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html\">\n<p>Now, let's increase the dimensionality i.e. number of dependent variables and see what happens. Say, we have 2 variables $x_1$ and $x_2$, same possible as before - integers between 1 and 100. Now, instead of a line, we'll have a plane with $x_1$ and $x_2$ on the two axes. The interesting bit is that instead of 100 possible values of dependent variables like before, we now have 100,000 possible values! Basically, we can make 100x100 table of possible values of $x_1$ and $x_2$. Wow, that increased exponentially. Not just figuratively, but mathematically exponentially. Needless to say, to cover 5% of the space like we did before, we'd need to sample $f$ at 5000 values.</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered\"><div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">\n</div><div class=\"inner_cell\">\n<div class=\"text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html\">\n<p>For 3 variables, it would be 100,000,000, and we'd need to sample at 500,000 points.

Even with a moderate dimension of 100 and a huge training set of a trillion examples, the latter covers only a fraction of about $10^{−18}$ of the input space.

Firstly, what is it that you are trying to solve? For example, if you want to guess my music preferences and you try to train a super awesome model while giving it what my height is as input features, you're going to have no luck. On the other hand, giving it my Spotify playlist will solve the problem with any model. So, CONTEXT of the problem plays a role.</p>\n<p>Second, you can only represent based on the data at hand. Meaning, if you didn't have access to my Spotify playlist, but to my Facebook statuses - You know all my statuses about Harvard may not be useful. But if you represent me as my Facebook statuses which are YouTube links, that would also solve the problem. So, AVAILABILITY OF DATA at hand is the second factor.</p>\n<h4 id=\"A-nice-way-to-think-of-it-is-to-think-that-you-start-with-the-problem-at-hand,-but-design-features-constrained-by-the-data-you-have-available.-If-you-have-many-independent-features-that-each-correlate-well-with-the-class,-learning-is-easy.-On-the-other-hand,-if-the-class-is-a-very-complex-function-of-the-features,-you-may-not-be-able-to-learn-it.\">A nice way to think of it is to think that you start with the problem at hand, but design features constrained by the data you have available. If you have many independent features that each correlate well with the class, learning is easy. On the other hand, if the class is a very complex function of the features, you may not be able to learn it.<a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#A-nice-way-to-think-of-it-is-to-think-that-you-start-with-the-problem-at-hand,-but-design-features-constrained-by-the-data-you-have-available.-If-you-have-many-independent-features-that-each-correlate-well-with-the-class,-learning-is-easy.-On-the-other-hand,-if-the-class-is-a-very-complex-function-of-the-features,-you-may-not-be-able-to-learn-it.\">&#182;</a></h4><p>In the context of this problem, we would like to predict the genre of a movie. what we have access to - movie overviews, which are text descriptions of the movie plot. The hypothesis makes sense, overview is a short description of the story and the story is clearly important in assigning genres to movies.</p>\n<p>So, let's improve our features by playing with the words in the overviews in our data. One interesting way to go back to what we discussed earlier - TF-IDF. We originally used it to filter words, but we can also assign the tf-idf values as \"importance\" values to words, as opposed to treating them all equally. Tf-idf simply tries to identify the assign a weightage to each word in the bag of words.</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered\"><div class=\"prompt input_prompt\">\n</div><div class=\"inner_cell\">\n<div class=\"text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html\">\n<p>Once again, the way it works is - Most movie descriptions have the word \"The\" in it. Obviously, it doesn't tell you anything special about it. So weightage should be inversely proportional to how many movies have the word in their description. This is the IDF part.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, for the movie interstellar, if the description has the word Space 5 times, and wormhole 2 times, then it's probably more about Space than about wormhole. Thus, space should have a high weightage. This is the TF part.</p>\n<p>We simply use TF-IDf to assign weightage to every word in the bag of words.
