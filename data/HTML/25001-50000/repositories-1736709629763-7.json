In an attempt to keep Terraform open source, we published the <a href=\"https://opentf.org/\">OpenTF manifesto</a>, and the community response was huge! Over 100 companies, 10 projects, and 400 individuals pledged their time and resources to keep Terraform open-source. The <a href=\"https://github.com/opentffoundation/manifesto\">GitHub repository</a> for the manifesto already has over 4k stars, and the number is growing quickly!\n          </p>\n          <p class=\"subtle-margin\">\n            The manifesto outlined the intent of the OpenTF initiative in two steps — the first was to appeal to HashiCorp to return Terraform to the community and revert the license change they were making for this project. The second, in case the license was not reverted, was to fork the Terraform project as OpenTF.\n          </p>\n          <h4 class=\"small-margin\">The time is now!</h4>\n          <p class=\"subtle-margin\">\n            Since no reversal has been done, and no intent to do one has been communicated, we’re proud to announce that <b>we have created a fork of Terraform called OpenTF</b>. Many engineers across a number of companies, sometimes even competing companies, have been working together over the last week to make this possible. It’s been an incredible experience, really!\n          </p>\n          <p class=\"subtle-margin\">\n            As outlined in our manifesto, we are keeping OpenTF:\n          </p>\n          <ul>\n            <li><b>Truly open source</b> - under a well-known and widely-accepted license that companies can trust, that won't suddenly change in the future\n            </li>\n            <li><b>Community-driven</b> - so that the community governs the project for the community, where pull requests are regularly reviewed and accepted on their merit, and changes are proposed through a public RFC process\n            </li>\n            <li><b>Impartial</b> - so that valuable features and fixes are accepted based on their value to the community, regardless of their impact on any particular vendor\n            </li>\n            <li><b>Layered and modular</b> -  with a programmer-friendly project structure to encourage building on top, enabling a new vibrant ecosystem of tools and integrations</li>\n            <li><b>Backwards-compatible</b> - so that the existing code can drive value for years to come</li>\n          </ul>\n          <h4 class=\"small-margin\">Becoming part of a foundation</h4>\n          <p class=\"subtle-margin\">\n            <b>We completed all documents required for OpenTF to become part of the Linux Foundation</b> with the end goal of having <b>OpenTF as part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation</b>. By making a foundation responsible for the project, we will ensure the tool stays truly open-source and vendor-neutral.\n          </p>\n          <p class=\"subtle-margin\">\n            If Terraform wasn’t open-source from the beginning, many of the tools that you are using right now for your Terraform workflows simply wouldn’t exist, thus, we believe the future for Terraform is OpenTF, developed fully in the open.\n          </p>\n          <h4 class=\"small-margin\">Roadmap</h4>\n          \n          <p class=\"subtle-margin\">\n            As previously outlined, we’ve been working on this fork for several days already, with over 10 engineers across multiple companies working on it.\n          </p>\n          <p class =\"subtle-margin\">\n            <b>In short, here’s the current status</b>:\n          </p>\n          <ul>\n            <li>Almost done with the repository-wide rename to OpenTF</li>\n            <li>Selected initial steering committee members</li>\n            <li>Performed initial adjustments and cleanup of community documents.</li>\n            <li>Got CI/CD pipelines and multiple testing harnesses of end-to-end and snapshot tests to work and be green, to make sure that we stay backwards-compatible.\n            </li>\n          </ul>\n          <p class=\"subtle-margin\">\n            <b>Expect the repository to be published very soon</b>, once we’re officially part of a foundation and have some basic community guardrails and processes in place.\n          </p>\n          <p class=\"subtle-margin\">\n            <b>You might wonder why we already started work on this project so early?</b> It’s quite simple, really. If HashiCorp were to reverse their decision, worst case we’d just lose a week of work. But if, and that is what indeed happened, HashiCorp wasn’t to reverse their decision, we didn’t want to lose any time, so that <b>we could have a working OpenTF 1.6.0 release ready for you as soon as possible</b>. And that’s why we started work on this over a week ago.\n          </p>\n          <p class=\"subtle-margin\">\n            In the spirit of being as open as possible, <b>we’ve created a</b> <a href=\"https://github.com/opentffoundation/roadmap/milestones\">public repository tracking our progress towards important milestones.</a> You can subscribe to the issues there to be notified as soon as the fork is public. If you have any questions, feel free to create additional issues on that repository - we’ll try to respond as quickly as possible.\n          </p>\n        </article>\n      </section>\n\n      <section>\n        <h2>FAQ</h2>\n        <p class=\"subtle-margin\">\n          <b>When will I be able to see the fork?</b>\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"subtle-margin\">\n          We’re planning to publish the fork in the next 1-2 weeks. That doesn’t mean there will be a release by then, but the repository will be open. Releases (alpha and stable) should follow shortly.\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"top-margin\">\n          <b>Will I be able to use OpenTF as a drop-in replacement for legacy Terraform?</b>\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"subtle-margin\">\n          Yes\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"top-margin\">\n          <b>Will OpenTF work with all the providers and modules Terraform works with?</b>\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"subtle-margin\">\n          Yes\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"top-margin\">\n          <b>What will be the first release of OpenTF?\n          </b>\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"subtle-margin\">\n          The first release will be 1.6.0-alpha, forked from the most recent commit that was still MPL-licensed.\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"top-margin\">\n          <b>Who is maintaining OpenTF? Is there enough firepower behind the project?</b>\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"subtle-margin\">\n          So far, four companies pledged the equivalent of 14 full-time engineers (FTEs) to the OpenTF initiative. We expect this number to at least double in the following few weeks. To give you some perspective, Terraform was effectively maintained by about 5 FTEs from HashiCorp in the last 2 years. If you don’t believe us, look at their repository.\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"top-margin\">\n          <b>How can I contribute to OpenTF?</b>\n        </p>\n        <p class=\"subtle-margin\">\n          If you’d like to pledge resources as a company, please get in touch via email or PR on the <a href=\"https://github.com/opentffoundation/manifesto\">manifesto repository</a>. Otherwise, the best way to contribute right now is to spread the word!

To\n            that end, going forward, we'll be developing OpenTF in the open. We had to do some work on the repo and the\n            OpenTF foundation in private to get everything ready for public consumption, but now that that's done,\n            and the OpenTF repo is publicly available, you'll be able to see everything we're working on—and start to \n            participate yourself!\n          </p>\n          <h3 class=\"small-margin\">What OpenTF currently does and doesn't support</h3>\n          <p>\n            Currently, OpenTF supports local testing and development: you can build the code, run the tests, \n            build <code>opentf</code> binaries, and so on. That means you can now start experimenting with OpenTF\n            and contributing back via Issues, PRs, and RFCs. \n          </p>\n          <p>\n            However, a few items are not done yet, and as a result, official OpenTF releases are <em>not</em> yet \n            available.

We published the OpenTF manifesto at <a href=\"https://opentf.org/\">opentf.org</a>.</li>  \n            <li><strong>Wait on HashiCorp's response</strong>. We reached out to HashiCorp publicly and privately and requested a response by August 25th.</li>  \n            <li><strong>Start working on the OpenTF fork</strong>. With no response from HashiCorp, we created the OpenTF fork, and started working on it in private.</li>  \n            <li><strong>Apply to join the Linux Foundation</strong>. We want OpenTF to be part of an impartial, community-driven foundation, so we submitted all the paperwork to join the Linux Foundation.</li>  \n            <li><strong>Open up community Slack discussions</strong>. We created the <a href=\"https://join.slack.com/t/slack-9uv6202/shared_invite/zt-22ifsm1t2-AF6cL0cOdzivP8E~4deDJA\">OpenTF Community Slack</a> to give the community a way to have discussions, provide feedback, ask questions, etc.</li>  \n            <li><strong>Prepare the OpenTF repo for collaboration</strong>. Rename everything to OpenTF; pick steering committee members; define <a href=\"https://github.com/opentffoundation/opentf/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\">contribution guidelines</a>; get CI / CD and testing working; etc.</li>  \n            <li><strong>Release the OpenTF repo</strong>.

To unblock the alpha release, we are launching an initial OpenTF Registry. We'll develop the official OpenTF Registry solution via an official RFC process later.</li>  \n            <li><strong>Release process</strong>. Put in place a process for creating OpenTF releases.</li>  \n            <li><strong>Alpha release</strong>. Once the above items are done, we will create the first OpenTF release.

In our\n        opinion, this change threatens the entire community and ecosystem that's built up around\n        Terraform over the last 9 years.\n      </p>\n\n      <p class=\"font-bold\">\n        Our concern: the BUSL license is a poison pill for Terraform.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Overnight, tens of thousands of businesses, ranging from one-person shops to the\n        Fortune 500 woke up to a new reality where the underpinnings of their infrastructure\n        suddenly became a potential legal risk. The BUSL and the additional use grant written by\n        the HashiCorp team are vague. Now, every company, vendor, and developer using Terraform\n        has to wonder whether what they are doing could be construed as competitive with HashiCorp's\n        offerings. <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/license-faq\" target=\"_blank\">The FAQ</a> provides some solace for end-customers and systems integrators today,\n        but even if you might be in the clear now, how can you build confidence that your usage\n        won't violate the license terms in the future? What if your products or HashiCorp's products\n        change? What if HashiCorp changes how they interpret “competitive”? What if they change the\n        license again? As a result, everything that uses Terraform is on shaky ground.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        It is clear that under the new license, the thriving ecosystem built around the\n        open-source Terraform will dwindle and wither. As developers consider what tools to learn\n        and what ecosystems to contribute to, and as companies consider what tools to use to manage\n        their infrastructure, more and more, they'll pick alternatives that are genuinely open-source.\n        Existing Terraform codebases will turn into outdated liabilities, independent tooling will\n        all but disappear, and the community will fracture and disappear.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        This sort of change also harms all similar open-source projects. Every company and every\n        developer now needs to think twice before adopting and investing in an open-source project\n        in case the creator suddenly decides to change the license. Imagine if the creators of Linux\n        or Kubernetes suddenly switched to a non-open-source license that only permitted\n        non-competitive usage.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        We believe that the essential building blocks of the modern Internet, such as Linux, Kubernetes,\n        and Terraform need to be truly open source: that is the only way to ensure\n        that we are building our industry on top of solid and predictable underpinnings.\n      </p>\n\n      <p class=\"font-bold\">\n        Our goal: ensure Terraform remains truly open source—always.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Our aim with this manifesto is to return Terraform to a fully open-source license. BUSL\n        is <em>not</em> open source, so this would mean moving Terraform back to the MPL license,\n        or some other well-known, widely accepted open-source license (e.g., Apache License 2.0).\n        Moreover, we want to be confident that Terraform will always remain open source, so you\n        don't have to worry about another sudden license change putting everything at risk.\n      </p>\n\n      <p class=\"font-bold\">\n        Our request to HashiCorp: switch Terraform back to an open-source license.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        We ask HashiCorp to do the right thing by the community: instead of going forward with the\n        BUSL license change, switch Terraform back to a truly open source license and commit to keeping\n        it that way forever going forward. That way, instead of fracturing the community, we end up with\n        a single, impartial, reliable home for Terraform where the whole community can unite to keep\n        building this amazing ecosystem.\n      </p>\n\n      <p class=\"font-bold\">\n        Our fallback plan: fork Terraform into a foundation.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        If HashiCorp is unwilling to switch Terraform back to an open-source license, we propose to fork\n        the legacy MPL-licensed Terraform and maintain the fork in the foundation. This is similar to how\n        Linux and Kubernetes are managed by foundations (the Linux Foundation and the Cloud Native\n        Computing Foundation, respectively), which are run by multiple companies, ensuring the tool stays\n        truly open source and neutral and not at the whim of any one company.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        In particular, we want to create a foundation for Terraform that is:\n      </p>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          <span class=\"font-bold\">Truly open source</span> - under a well-known and widely-accepted license that\n          companies can trust,\n          that won't suddenly change in the future and isn't subject to the whims of a single vendor\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <span class=\"font-bold\">Community-driven</span> - so that the community governs the project for the community,\n          where pull\n          requests are regularly reviewed and accepted on their merit\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <span class=\"font-bold\">Impartial</span> - so that valuable features and fixes are accepted based on their\n          value to the community,\n          regardless of their impact on any particular vendor\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <span class=\"font-bold\">Layered and modular</span> - with a programmer-friendly project structure\n          to encourage building on top, enabling a new vibrant ecosystem of\n          tools and integrations\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <span class=\"font-bold\">Backwards-compatible</span> - so that the existing code can drive value for years to\n          come\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h2>Contact us</h2>\n\n      <p>\n        If you are a member of the community, a member of the press, an employee of HashiCorp, or anyone

Who decides?\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The answer to all these questions is that, in order to really know if you're a competitor, you\n        have to reach out to HashiCorp. So whether your usage is valid is <em>not</em> controlled by the terms of the\n        license, but is instead entirely at the whim of HashiCorp. They get to decide on a case-by-case basis who is\n        and who isn't a competitor—and they can change their mind at any time.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        That is a very shaky footing on which to build anything.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        At every company you ever work at in the future, before starting to use Terraform, the CTO will have to think\n        about whether HashiCorp could possibly consider you a competitor, now or at any time in the future. The\n        legal team at that company will have to wonder if they want to take the risk of allowing a BUSL license or if\n        they should ban it due to all the uncertainty. Every developer at that company will have to wonder if they\n        want to contribute back to Terraform, given there's no certainty they'll be able to use their own work at a\n        future job.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        In short, the BUSL is a poison pill for the entire Terraform community.\n      </p>\n\n      <p class=\"font-bold\" id=\"why-fork\">\n        Doesn't forking hurt the whole community?

This created an understanding—an implicit contract—that\n        Terraform is open-source and you can use it for just about anything you want. Based on that understanding,\n        tens of thousands of developers adopted the tool and contributed back to it. HashiCorp even had all\n        contributors sign a CLA which explicitly said\n        (<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20230610041432/https://www.hashicorp.com/cla\">link to the CLA in the\n          Internet Archive</a> as HashiCorp has of course removed this wording):\n      </p>\n      <figure>\n        <blockquote>\n          HashiCorp is committed to having a true Free and Open Source Software (“FOSS”) license for our non-commercial\n          software. A CLA enables HashiCorp to safely commercialize our products while keeping a standard FOSS license\n          with all the rights that the license grants to users: the ability to use the project in their own projects or\n          businesses, to republish modified source, or to fork the project completely.\n        </blockquote>\n      </figure>\n      <p>\n        The move to BUSL—which is <em>not</em> a free and open source license—broke the implicit contract. <em>That</em>\n        was the brash action!\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Terraform would've never gotten the adoption it did, or all the contributions from the community had it not\n        been open-source. Most of us would've never agreed to the CLA to contribute to the project if it was BUSL\n        licensed. Taking all those contributions and all that community trust, and then changing to the BUSL license\n        is a bait and switch.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The OpenTF manifesto is about <em>undoing</em> those changes! It's about going back to the way Terraform was\n        for the first ~9 years: as a truly open-source tool that we can all trust, contribute to, and use as we wish.\n      </p>\n\n      <p class=\"font-bold\" id=\"contribute-back\">\n        Didn't HashiCorp adopt BUSL to deter vendors who were using Terraform but not contributing back? <a\n          href=\"#contribute-back\"><svg width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\"\n            xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n            <path\n              d=\"M13.5442 10.4558C11.8385 8.75022 9.07316 8.75022 7.36753 10.4558L4.27922 13.5442C2.57359 15.2498 2.57359 18.0152 4.27922 19.7208C5.98485 21.4264 8.75021 21.4264 10.4558 19.7208L12 18.1766\"\n              stroke=\"black\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" />\n            <path\n              d=\"M10.4558 13.5442C12.1614 15.2498 14.9268 15.2498 16.6324 13.5442L19.7207 10.4558C21.4264 8.75021 21.4264 5.98485 19.7207 4.27922C18.0151 2.57359 15.2497 2.57359 13.5441 4.27922L12 5.82338\"\n              stroke=\"black\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" />\n          </svg></a>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        In the <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashicorp-adopts-business-source-license\">blog post</a> where\n        HashiCorp announces the switch to BUSL, and they justify the license switch as a response to the following:\n      </p>\n      <figure>\n        <blockquote>\n          However, there are other vendors who take advantage of pure OSS models, and the community work on OSS\n          projects, for their own commercial goals, without providing material contributions back. We don’t believe\n          this is in the spirit of open source.\n        </blockquote>\n      </figure>\n      <p>\n        This is inaccurate and misleading. First of all, many of the vendors affected by the change to BUSL have made\n        considerable contributions to the Terraform community. Here are just a handful of examples:\n      </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          <b>Terraform binaries</b>: Terraform core has 1,700+ contributors. The Terraform AWS provider has 2,800+.\n          The Azure provider has 1,300+. The vast majority of these contributors do <em>not</em> work at HashiCorp.\n          And that's not even counting the <em>thousands</em> of other providers in the\n          <a href=\"https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers\">Terraform Registry</a> that built with no\n          HashiCorp involvement at all.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <b>Terraform modules</b>: There are 14K+ in the\n          <a href=\"https://registry.terraform.io/browse/modules\">Terraform Registry</a> alone. The vast majority of\n          these were <em>not</em> built by HashiCorp employees.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <b>Terraform tools</b>: There are hundreds of tools such as\n          <a href=\"https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/\">Terragrunt</a>,\n          <a href=\"https://terratest.gruntwork.io/\">Terratest</a>,\n          <a href=\"https://github.com/aquasecurity/tfsec\">tfsec</a>,\n          <a href=\"https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint\">tflint</a>,\n          <a href=\"https://www.infracost.io/\">Infracost</a>,\n          <a href=\"https://github.com/terraform-docs/terraform-docs\">terraform-docs</a>,\n          and countless others that were <em>not</em> built by HashiCorp employees.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <b>Learning resources</b>: There are thousands of books, blog posts, courses, and courses, such as\n          <em><a href=\"https://www.terraformupandrunning.com/\">Terraform: Up & Running</a></em>,\n          <a href=\"https://www.terraform-best-practices.com/\">Terraform Best Practices</a>,\n          <a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/topic/terraform/\">Udemy courses</a>,\n          <a href=\"https://www.pluralsight.com/browse/terraform-training\">Pluralsight courses</a>,\n          and many others that were <em>not</em> created by HashiCorp employees.\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>\n        And so much more. Tools like Terraform don't live in isolation: they are part of a large ecosystem. The same\n        is true of Kubernetes or Linux or Go or other major infrastructure tools. The ecosystem is a big part of why\n        you pick those tools in the first place: that way, you know you'll be able to hire people who know the tools,\n        find answers to your questions online, find libraries/extensions/etc to save you time, and so on.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Of course, no one is questioning HashiCorp's contribution here. They created Terraform and led the project to\n        where it is today. They deserve full credit for that. But to not acknowledge the tens of thousands of\n        developers, many of whom worked at a variety of \"vendors,\" who contributed to the ecosystem and played a\n        pivotal role in Terraform's success is misleading, at best.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Terraform didn't get to where it is today solely due to HashiCorp's involvement. The entire community,\n        vendors included, played a huge part in that. To not acknowledge that is bad. To then take all those\n        contributions from the community—which would've never happened had Terraform not been open source—and\n        put them under a commercial license so those contributors might not be able to use their own work in the\n        future is even worse.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        And finally, there have been many contributions that were attempted, but HashiCorp rejected them because\n        it made their paid offerings (TFC/TFE) less compelling. The classic one is the\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/516\">dozens</a>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/1421\">of issues</a>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/9556\">and PRs</a> submitted about encrypting state,\n        all of which TF has ignored, as storing state securely is a selling point of TFC/TFE.\n      </p>\n\n      <p class=\"font-bold\" id=\"return\">\n        HashiCorp deserves to earn a return on their investment.
