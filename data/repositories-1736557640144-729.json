          "content": "# Mr. Ranedeer v2.7 (Current Version)\n\n1. Re-arranged prompt to improve effectiveness\n2. Added \"Overall Rules to follow\" header\n3. Added a little personality to Mr. Ranedeer\n4. Gave Mr. Ranedeer more freedom on what to say\n5. Added `Prerequisite` and `Main Curriculum` examples as a strong guide\n6. Removed `teach` function\n7. Moved Mr. Ranedeer's thoughts onto the code environment\n8. Removed token check & magic number as it is now no longer needed\n9. Mr. Ranedeer will now wait for you response after it asks you a question\n10. Reworked algorithm for `Curriculum` and `Lesson`\n11. Added a standard for `Config Example`\n12. Moved function rules to the bottom of the prompt\n13. Recall personality and rules\n14. Recall curriculum\n15. Write instructions, emojis, and observations of the student\n16. Ability to change the configuration automatically if needed\n17. Ability to solve mathematical problems in python first in the /test command before showing them to the student.\n18. Improve question accuracy by only giving one question at a time #40 \n19. Create curriculum by uploading `.txt` files\n20. Added configuration wizard #33\n\n# Mr. Ranedeer v2.6.2\n1. Added `Thoughts` before every lesson to give GPT-4 to \"plan\" out the lesson before executing it. (Sorry I added this again, this increases effectiveness)\n2. Replaced `<markdown separator>` with `---` to reduce the false markdown lines.\n# Mr. Ranedeer v2.6.1\n\n1. Replaced `As a tutor, you must teach the student accordingly to the configurations.` phrase with `You are allowed to change your language to *any language* that is configured by the student.` as an attempt to fix the language change bug. It was previously in the `Commands` header\n2. Some prompt clarifications\n\n# Mr. Ranedeer v2.6\n\n1. Change the entire format of Mr. Ranedeer from JSON/YAML/Markdown to a more cleaner, less token consuming approach. There is no name yet. Perhaps it should be named NoName language.\n2. Moved Student Configuration to the top of the prompt\n3. Removed the following learning styles: Sensing, Sequential, Deductive\n4. Removed the following communication styles: Stochastic\n5. Removed the following tones: Debate (Can be replaced by a Ranedeer Tool)\n6. Removed the following commands: search, search, self-eval, visualize\n7. Removed Rules, specific rules are now in [INSTRUCTIONS] and [Function Rules] headers\n8. Removed the annoying configuration reminder output\n9. Added a note to GPT-4 that a visual learning style requires plugins (Wolfram Alpha, Show Me)\n10. Added Functions! These functions are used as a guide for GPT-4 to execute highly specific formats and sequences. Functions are a replacement to the old \"Rules\" and \"Formats\" previously in v2.5\n\nThese functions are:\n- say (Args: Text) this is for GPT-4 to strictly output the string given with a less likely chance to add in its own fillers.\n- teach (Args: topic) this function are instructions for GPT-4 to follow when teaching a topic.\n- sep (Args: None) this function is for GPT-4 to output a markdown formatted separator.\n- post-auto (Args: None) this function automatically executes the `Token Check` and `Suggestions` functions.\n- Curriculum (Args: None) this function is for GPT-4 to output the curriculum in a specific forma: Assumptions, Emoji Usage, Ranedeer Tools, prerequisite, main curriculum, token check\n- Lesson (Args: None) this function is for GPT-4 to output the lesson in the following format: Example, main lesson, then calls the [post-auto] function.\n- Test (Args: None) this function is to test the user by giving it an example problem first with solution then testing the user in 3 categories: Simple Familiar, Complex Familiar, and Complex Unfamiliar\n- Question (Args: None) this function automatically runs in the specified format if a student asks a question\n- Suggestions (Args: None) this function outputs suggests questions that the students may want to know about in a markdown table format.\n- Configuration (Args: None) this function outputs a specific format to show the user their configuration\n- Config Example (Args: None) this function shows the user what their lessons may look like based on their configuration, it also tells you examples of how it implemented the configuration into the example lesson and rates it overall.\n- Token Check (Args: None) this function checks whether the magic-number exists. If it doesn't it will warn the user that the number of tokens are overloaded. This magic number is automatically generated at the start and not at the initial prompt.\n- Init (Args: None) this function is the welcoming message for Mr. Ranedeer\n\n10. Added Ranedeer Tools! You can now inject different types of prompts (for e.g Medieval Setting Japan, Simulator, Gordon Ramsey Personality, Socratic Tutor) into Mr. Ranedeer to make your learning more fun, customized, and unique!\n\n# Mr. Ranedeer v2.5\n- **Changed depth levels from Surface Level-Cutting Edge research to Elementary-Ph.D to gain more relevant lesson plans.**\n- Removed descriptions for levels, learning styles, communication styles, tone styles, and reaasoning frameworks because it isn't needed.\n- Removed \"plugin\", \"internet\", \"python_enabled\" settings because it isn't needed.\n- Added rule 11: \"You are allowed to change your language to any language that is configured by the student.\"\n- Added rule 12: \"In lessons, you must provide solved problem examples for the student to analyze, this is so the student can learn from example.\"\n- Added rule 13: \"In lessons, if there are existing plugins, you can activate plugins to visualize or search for content. Else, continue.\"\n- Fixed https://github.com/JushBJJ/Mr.-Ranedeer-AI-Tutor/issues/27\n- Fixed https://github.com/JushBJJ/Mr.-Ranedeer-AI-Tutor/issues/37\n- Changed the format for `configuration` to display preferences, else it will say \"None\"\n- For emojis in the `configuration` format, it will display \"‚úÖ\" if True, else \"‚ùå\" if False.\n- For language in the `configuration` format, it will display the language name if it is not English, else it will display the default langauge (English)\n- Appended more specification to not mistakenly follow the `configuration` format, instead follow what it is supposed to be printing.\n- `Planning` and `Lesson` format is now instructed to strictly follow the `configuration_reminder` format\n- `Planning` now has \"Assumptions\" where GPT-4 will try to predict what the student already knows based on the depth level.\n- Before outputting the plan in the `Planning` format, it will say \"A `depth name` student lesson plan:\" before printing out the plan for you.\n- `Lesson` format is commanded to strictly execute rule 12 and 13\n- `configuration_reminder` format now has a new way of reminding itself (experimental). It should expectedly follow the student's preferences more.\n- `Planning` and `Lesson` will now have an `emoji usage` to \"plan\" its use for emojis in planning and lessons (this triggers an encouraged use of consistent emojis in general).\n- There is now a `test` format where an example problem is provided and solved as an example by Mr. Ranedeer, then it will provide problems for the student to solve.\n"

          "content": "# How Mr. Ranedeer Works - Analysis\n\nMr. Ranedeer prompts define a new `programming language` which use chatgpt4(or other LLM) as compiler/interpreter to execute the code. \nIt is somewhere between natural language and a High-level programming language,more like a pseudocode.\n\n# Manually Enabling Code Interpreter\nMr. Ranedeer's prompt uses `[OPEN code environment]` to open the code interpreter and `[CLOSE code environment]` to close the code interpreter.\n\n## Preventing result recall\nTo prevent Mr. Ranedeer from recalling its outputs, the output is converted into base64.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\n[OPEN code environment]\n    ...\n    <convert the output to base64>\n    <output base64>\n[CLOSE code environment]\n```\n\n# Headers\n\n# Functions/Class\n### Define Functions/Class\n\nMr. Ranedeer defines several functions using square brackets `[ ]`. Functions can take parameters as input using `Args`.Here is a function definition template:\n```\n[~Function Name,Args:any_args_name]\n    [INSTRUCTIONS]\n\n        `INSTRUCTIONS` works like `__init__` in python class. It defines some nature of the function(or class),and execute automatically.\n\n    [BEGIN]\n\n        Code block start with `[BEGIN]` and end with `[END]`, just like C++ use {}.\n        Code can be described by natural language or command/functions defined previously,or mix of them.\n\n    [END]\n```\n\n### Call Functions/Class\nMr. Ranedeer call functions/class use `execute <~Function Name>` or just `<~Function Name>`.\nIf function has any arg as input,you can call it like:\n\n```\n~function_name <args_name>\n```\n\nFor example,\n\n```\nteach <topic>\n```\n\nBasically it is flexible about how to call a function. Just \"telling\" llm to call a function also works.\n\n\n# Variables\n\n### Definition\nDefining variables in Mr. Ranedeer is pretty flexible. You can either define a variable using programming style like:\n```\nvar logo = \"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1114958734364524605/1114959626023207022/Ranedeer-logo.png\"\n```\n\nor using natural language style like:\n\n```\nVersion: 2.6.2\n```\n\nYou can also use variable to define a inline function,for example:\n\n```\nvar magic-number = <generate a random unique 7 digit magic number>\n```\n\n### Referencing Variables\nOnce that definition is completed,you can reference this variable like:\n\n```\nsay \"Hello!üëã My name is **Mr. Ranedeer**, your personalized AI Tutor. I am running <version> made by author\"\n```\n\n# Token Management\n"
