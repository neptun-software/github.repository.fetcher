We use it as ground truth and keep our answers in sync with their questions/answers as much as possible. If you are keen to add a question/answer, submit an issue/pull request to the [original questions repository](https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions). Once your question is merged, make a pull request with your answers to this repository.\n\n### Answering Questions\n\nYou are welcome to make improvements to existing answers and answer unanswered questions. Whenever possible, add a list of references and supplementary material. This would be helpful for readers who would like to go further in-depth into the answer.\n\nFollow the existing format of markdown and code. JavaScript code added should adopt [Standard style](https://standardjs.com/).\n\n### Translations\n\nFeel free to add translations for the questions and answers only. You can retrieve a translated copy of the questions from [the original repository](https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions) and start from there. Simply create an issue expressing interest in being a translator and you can fork the repository and start translating. Translators have the responsibility of keeping the translated content up to date with the master copy. Translated work has to go through the Pull Request and review process before it can be merged into the repository. This is more for organizational purposes as different translators tend to have individual collaboration approach (some prefer merging, some prefer rebasing). Going through a Pull Request process will make the commit history more organized and clean.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\nPlease note our Code of Conduct and follow it in all your interactions with the project.\n"

This repository covers all you need to know for front end interviews:\n\n- [Various formats of Front end interviews](https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com/introduction/) including formats by different companies\n- [Front end system design interviews](https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com/front-end-system-design/)\n- [Front end trivia questions](https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com/trivia/) - answers to the h5bp Front-end Developer Interview Questions\n- [Front end questions](https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com/coding/javascript-utility-function/) - JavaScript, DOM, algorithms, and more\n- [Front end interview questions by companies](https://www.frontendinterviewhandbook.com/company-interview-questions/)\n\n## Where to get hands on practice?\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.greatfrontend.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&gnrs=frontendinterviewhandbook\">\n    <img src=\"assets/mark-brand-light.png\" alt=\"GreatFrontEnd\" width=\"400\"/>\n  </a>\n</div>\n\nAfter getting a good understanding about front end interview preparation, try out [GreatFrontEnd](https://www.greatfrontend.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&gnrs=frontendinterviewhandbook), a platform built by me!
