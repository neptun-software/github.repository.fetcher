Before we can take them, we \nhave to jump a couple of legal hurdles.\n\n### Before you contribute\nBefore we can use your code, you must sign the\n[Google Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-individual)\n(CLA), which you can do online. The CLA is necessary mainly because you own the\ncopyright to your changes, even after your contribution becomes part of our\ncodebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your code. We also\nneed to be sure of various other things—for instance that you'll tell us if you\nknow that your code infringes on other people's patents. You don't have to sign\nthe CLA until after you've submitted your code for review and a member has\napproved it, but you must do it before we can put your code into our codebase.\nBefore you start working on a larger contribution, you should get in touch with\nus first through the issue tracker with your idea so that we can help out and\npossibly guide you. Coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid\nfrustration later on.\n\n### Code reviews\nAll submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We\nuse Github pull requests for this purpose.\n\n### The small print\nContributions made by corporations are covered by a different agreement than\nthe one above, the\n[Software Grant and Corporate Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-corporate).\n"

In its different branches you'll find the same app (a TODO app) implemented with small differences.\n\nIn this branch you'll find:\n*   User Interface built with **[Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)** \n*   A single-activity architecture, using **[Navigation Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/navigation)**.\n*   A presentation layer that contains a Compose screen (View) and a **ViewModel** per screen (or feature).\n*   Reactive UIs using **[Flow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow)** and **[coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html)** for asynchronous operations.\n*   A **data layer** with a repository and two data sources (local using Room and a fake remote).\n*   Two **product flavors**, `mock` and `prod`, [to ease development and testing](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2015/12/leveraging-product-flavors-in-android.html).\n*   A collection of unit, integration and e2e **tests**, including \"shared\" tests that can be run on emulator/device.\n*   Dependency injection using [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android).\n\n## Screenshots\n\n<img src=\"screenshots/screenshots.png\" alt=\"Screenshot\">\n\n## Why a to-do app?\n\nThe app in this project aims to be simple enough that you can understand it quickly, but complex enough to showcase difficult design decisions and testing scenarios. For more information, see the [app's specification](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture/wiki/To-do-app-specification).\n\n## What is it not?\n*   A template. Check out the [Architecture Templates](https://github.com/android/architecture-templates) instead.\n*   A UI/Material Design sample. The interface of the app is deliberately kept simple to focus on architecture. Check out the [Compose Samples](https://github.com/android/compose-samples) instead.\n*   A real production app with network access, user authentication, etc. Check out the [Now in Android app](https://github.com/android/nowinandroid) instead.\n\n## Who is it for?\n\n*   Intermediate developers and beginners looking for a way to structure their app in a testable and maintainable way.\n*   Advanced developers looking for quick reference.\n\n## Opening a sample in Android Studio\n\nTo open one of the samples in Android Studio, begin by checking out one of the sample branches, and then open the root directory in Android Studio. The following series of steps illustrate how to open the sample.\n\nClone the repository:\n\n```\ngit clone git@github.com:android/architecture-samples.git\n```\n\nFinally open the `architecture-samples/` directory in Android Studio.\n\n### License\n\n\n```\nCopyright 2024 Google, Inc.\n\nLicensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more contributor\nlicense agreements.
