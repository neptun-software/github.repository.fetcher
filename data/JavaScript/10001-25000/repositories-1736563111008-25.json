Functions provided as procedural parameters (i.e. `during` and iteratees) no longer expect a callback to be invoked, as long as you omit their 2nd callabck argument from the function signature.**\n- **The bootstrap function (`config/bootstrap.js`) and the `initialize` function of hooks no longer expect a callback to be invoked, as long as the callback argument is excluded from the function signature.**\n- **New chainable methods available on helper invocations: `.timeout()` and `.retry()`.**\n- Use vuejs VueRouter (and a virtual page example) by default, and make vuejs <router-view> more apparent\n- Update helper, action, and hook generators, plus a few other updates to boilerplate output from generators.\n- Update boilerplate bootstrap and hook initialize functions.\n- Disable 'async' dependency when generated the expanded starter app, to avoid confusion.  (Can always still be installed, it just won't be bundled by default anymore, and auto-globalization is also, of course, disabled.)\n- Include FontAwesome 4 files, and update instructions for removal if desired\n- Update check for production/staging in vuejs to assume we're in production if no SAILS_LOCALS are present\n- Provide documentation tip on how to configure Mongo as default datastore w/ link to tutorial\n- Take advantage of next-gen whelk.\n- Improve Windows compatibility (for 'sails generate page', sails generate action, etc)\n- Exclude 'async' dep by default in all new apps\n- Update boilerplate to take advantage of optional 'exits' argument in helpers, actions, and shell scripts.\n- Use updated bootstrap for web app template\n- Implement Google fonts/typekit/google tag manager/google analytics\n- Include (hard-code) Bowser inline now\n- Improve <ajax-form> to also include 'is' rule\n- Redirect away ALL unrecognized base subdomains (not just webhooks and click), but only do it in staging/production.\n- Fix \"sails g page\" with nested folders on Windows\n- Add FileList and FormData to reserved list to protect them from mangling.  (Should be fine anyway, but this protects against potential issues from changing uglify versions.)\n- Take advantage of patch in Parasails 0.7.7\n- Leverage .updateOne()\n- Add 5 second timeout for all four of those calls, to protect user experience from any 3rd party API call issues.  (For context, this is rare, but it happens.  I've noticed Stripe go all 500 on a customer app twice in the last 6 months: once for about 28 minutes earlier this summer, and once last month for a split second.  I've never seen it hang, but this is such a common thing with other 3rd party apis better to be safe than sorry.  An error message after a reasonable wait time is a far better user experience than having to wait 2 whole minutes for the TCP timeout.  And this way, any error handling logic to unroll stuff etc that gets added here will still be able to run.)\n- Integrate Cloud SDK into Parasails\n- Use top-level implementationSniffingTactic and pass through to whelk and MaA\n- Force homogeneous sniffing tactic for helpers+actions.\n- Force minimum SVRs (re implementationType: 'classical').\n- Finish up support for smarter .bootstrap and .initialize. (Continued from 21bc1f1ab88dfa1064f2e312a4b1135b92763d2a)\n- Add faux callbacks for easier debugging\n- Add `create` method to datastore fixture, and test \"no validation errors\" case. [(Scott Gress)](https://github.com/sgress454)\n- Fix test descriptions for `update` [(Scott Gress)](https://github.com/sgress454)\n- Add test cases for validations on primary key [(Scott Gress)](https://github.com/sgress454)\n- Hoist flag for determining whether to apply validation rules, and use it for both PKs and generic attributes. [(Scott Gress)](https://github.com/sgress454)\n- Add implementation-sniffing to .stream()\n- Setup updateOne() method\n- Set up destroyOne() and archiveOne(), and use an omen in the 'found too many' error in findOne() to improve the stack trace.\n- Implement implementation sniffing in .transaction() and .leaseConnection().\n- Enable ORM to accept attributes named 'length'. Replace `_.each()` with `_.forIn()` to enable ORM to accept attributes named 'length'. [(Daniel Harvey)](https://github.com/danielsharvey)\n- Add an isError check when handling errors thrown from validation rules to prevent potential issues in extreme edge cases (where something weird gets thrown)\n- Clean up tests for greater clarity and usefulness\n- Finish restructuring things to match latest conventions in parley, etc.  Leave standalone/ alias for backwards-compatibility\n- Update docs about other adapter methods\n- Improve error messaging to assist in debugging\n- Add E_TOO_MANY_FILES error code.\n- Add Cloud.on() and Cloud.off(), improve error msgs, and remove idempotency guarantee\n- Add typeof check to ensure reasonable behavior even with strange input.\n- Enhance built-in catchall error msg for Cloud.on()\n- Refactor UMD approach to make it easier to see what's going on at a glance.\n- Add experimental support for FileList instances (multi-file upload via Cloud SDK).\n- Improve performance of +500K ops/sec by collapsing IIFE\n- Setup for being able to use AsyncFunctions with .intercept() and .tolerate().\n- Add new method: getInvocationinfo() -- a public API for accessing private info such as _timeout. Add .interruptions to getInvocationInfo().\n- Introduce working impl of .retry()\n- Clone (shallow) metadata on the way in during .retry(), just to avoid any potential edge cases with a fn attaching additional properties and that actually mattering for subsequent invocations with the same arguments.\n- Take advantage of new getInvocationInfo() method in parley related to .retry()\n- Implement partial support for blended tolerate/intercept with retry (Note: works only for completely parallel error conditions).\n- Optimize AsyncFunction function constructor check.\n- Allow implementationSniffingTactic to be customized.\n- Add failsafe to ensure app lifts inside of Mocha tests. Related to https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/issues/4395 and https://github.com/balderdashy/captains-log/pull/22\n- Also in new Sails apps: Force min 3.10.3 of lodash in new projects\n- Also in new Sails apps: Update eslintrc templates to tolerate unused args and vars that begin with 'unused' (or are just named 'unused')\n- Also in new Sails apps: Add 'custom' validation rule.\n- Also in new Sails apps: Replace autofocus with focus-first, and ensure this feature is opt-in for <ajax-form> and <modal>.

Each module is located in its own repository, and in most cases is tested individually.\n\nBelow, you'll find an overview of the modules maintained by the core team and community members.\n\n\n## Sails core\n\nThe modules comprising the Sails framework, as well as the other plugins maintained by our core team, are spread across a number of different code repositories.  Some modules can be used outside of the context of Sails, while others are not intended for external use.\n\n#### Framework and ORM\n\n> For more information on the available releases of the Sails framework as a whole, check out the [contribution guide](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n| Package          |  Latest Stable Release   |  Build Status (edge)                  |\n|------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| <a href=\"http://github.com/balderdashy/sails\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Github repo for Sails core\"><img src=\"http://sailsjs.com/images/logos/sails-logo_ltBg_dkBlue.png\" width=60 alt=\"Sails.js logo (small)\"/></a>     | [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/sails.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/sails) | [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/balderdashy/sails.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/balderdashy/sails)\n| <a href=\"http://github.com/balderdashy/waterline\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Github repo for Waterline ORM\"><img src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/fda800f7fab38baffcf951761d8c1e97f3af6533/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f33587168364d7a2e706e67\" width=100 alt=\"Waterline logo (small)\"/></a> | [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/waterline.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/waterline) | [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/balderdashy/waterline.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/balderdashy/waterline)\n\n\n\n#### Core hooks\n\nAs of Sails v1, some hooks are no longer included in Sails core.  Instead, they're published as standalone packages:\n\n| Hook           | Package                                                             |  Latest Stable Release                                                                                             | Build Status (edge)                                                                                                                              | Purpose                                                  |\n|:---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|\n| `orm`          | [sails-hook-orm](https://npmjs.com/package/sails-hook-orm)          | [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/sails-hook-orm.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/sails-hook-orm)         | [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/balderdashy/sails-hook-orm.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/balderdashy/sails-hook-orm)          | Implements support for Waterline ORM in Sails.  |\n| `sockets`      | [sails-hook-sockets](https://npmjs.com/package/sails-hook-sockets)  | [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/sails-hook-sockets.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/sails-hook-sockets) | [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/balderdashy/sails-hook-sockets.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/balderdashy/sails-hook-sockets)  | Implements Socket.io support in Sails.  |\n\n> These are not _all_ the core hooks in Sails.  There are other core hooks built in to the `sails` package itself (see [`lib/hooks/`](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/tree/master/lib/hooks)).  These other, _built-in hooks_ can still be disabled or overridden using the same configuration.\n\n\n#### Bundled hooks\n\nCertain additional hooks are bundled as dependencies of a new Sails app, especially when using the \"Web app\" template:\n\n\n| Hook           | Package                                                             |  Latest Stable Release

Want automatically-generated spritesheets?  Source maps?  Sails.js uses Grunt for its asset pipeline, which means it supports any Grunt plugin. out of the box.  There are thousands of Grunt plugins [available on NPM](http://gruntjs.com/plugins).\n\n> [Learn how to customize your app's asset pipeline](http://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/assets).\n\n\n\n#### Generators\n\nDon't like Grunt?  Want to use WebPack or Gulp instead?  Prefer your generated backend files to be written in CoffeeScript?  There are at least 100 community generators for Sails.js [available on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=sails%20generate).\n\n> [Learn how to use community generators, and how to build your own](http://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/extending-sails/generators).\n\n<!-- Looking for the list that used to be here?

Need to get extra performance out of your database queries?  Dynamic database connections?\n\n> [Learn about Waterline drivers](https://github.com/node-machine/driver-interface).\n\n\n#### View engines\n\nIs EJS bumming you out?  Prefer to use a different templating language like pug (/jade), handlebars, or dust?  Sails.js supports almost any Consolidate/Express-compatible view engine-- meaning you can use just about any imaginable markup language for your Sails.js views.  Check out the community view engines for Sails.js and Express [available on NPM](http://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/views/view-engines).\n\n> [Learn how to set up a custom view engine for your app](http://sailsjs.com/documentation/reference/configuration/sails-config-views).\n\n\n#### Session stores\n\nThe recommended production session store for Sails.js is Redis... but we realize that, for some apps, that isn't an option.  Fortunately, Sails.js supports almost any Connect/Express-compatible session store-- meaning you can store your sessions almost anywhere, whether that's Mongo, on the local filesystem, or even in a relational database.  Check out the community session stores for Sails.js, Express, and Connect [available on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=connect%20session-).\n\n> [Learn how to install and configure a custom session store in your Sails app](http://sailsjs.com/documentation/reference/configuration/sails-config-session#?production-config).\n\n\n\n#### Community socket client SDKs & examples\n\nNeed to connect to Sails from a native iPhone or Android app?\n\n| Platform     | Repo       |  Build Status (edge)             |\n|--------------|------------|----------------------------------|\n| iOS          | [sails.ios](https://github.com/ChrisChares/sails.ios)  | [![CI Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/ChrisChares/sails.ios.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/ChrisChares/sails.ios) |\n| Objective C  | [sails.io.objective-c](https://github.com/fishrod-interactive/sails-io.objective-c) | _N/A_ |\n| Android      | [Sails Messenger](https://github.com/TheFinestArtist/Sails-Messenger)  | _N/A_  |\n| React Native | [React Native example](https://github.com/mikermcneil/chatkin/tree/master/mobileapp)  | _N/A_  |\n| Cordova      | [Phonegap tips](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33378104/how-to-implement-sailsjs-phonegap-cordova-application)  | _N/A_  |\n\n\n#### Misc. projects\n\n| Package                                                                             | Latest Stable Release           | Purpose\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|:------------|\n| [sails-migrations](https://github.com/BlueHotDog/sails-migrations)                  | [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/sails-migrations.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/sails-migrations) | Manual migration tool for Sails, built on Knex.\n| [sails-mysql-transactions](https://github.com/postmanlabs/sails-mysql-transactions) | [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/sails-mysql-transactions.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/sails-mysql-transactions) | Augmented database adapter for mySQL with transaction and replication support.\n| [sails-inverse-model](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sails-inverse-model) | Generate Sails/Waterline model definitions from a pre-existing database.\n\n\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### What happened to the core generators?\n\nFor easier maintainence, they were pulled into [`sails-generate`](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-generate).\n\n#### What release of XYZ should I install?\n\nYou can read about naming conventions for plugins and core modules [here](https://gist.github.com/mikermcneil/baa3eed1030e67f1b0670fb05a2b1f53).

It is designed to resemble the MVC architecture from frameworks like Ruby on Rails, but with support for the more modern, data-oriented style of web app & API development. It's especially good for building realtime features like chat.\n\nSince version 1.0, Sails supports `await` out of the box.  This replaces nested callbacks (and the commensurate error handling) with simple, familiar usage:\n\n```javascript\nvar orgs = await Organization.find();\n```\n\n\n## Installation &nbsp;\n**With [node](http://nodejs.org) [installed](http://nodejs.org/en/download):**\n```sh\n# Get the latest stable release of Sails\n$ npm install sails -g\n```\n\n> ##### Upgrading from an earlier version of Sails?\n> Upgrade guides for all major releases since 2013 are available on the Sails website under [**Upgrading**](http://sailsjs.com/upgrading).\n\n\n## Your First Sails Project\n\n**Create a new app:**\n```sh\n# Create the app\nsails new my-app\n```\n\n**Lift sails:**\n```sh\n# cd into the new folder\ncd my-app\n\n# fire up the server\nsails lift\n```\n\n[![Screenshot from the original Sails video](http://i.imgur.com/Ii88jlhl.png)](https://sailsjs.com/get-started)\n\nFor the most up-to-date introduction to Sails, [get started here](https://sailsjs.com/get-started).\n\n## Compatibility\n\nSails is built on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), and [Socket.io](http://socket.io/).\n\nSails [actions](http://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/actions-and-controllers) are compatible with Connect middleware, so in most cases, you can paste code into Sails from an existing Express project and everything will work-- plus you'll be able to use WebSockets to talk to your API, and vice versa.\n\nThe ORM, [Waterline](https://github.com/balderdashy/waterline), has a well-defined adapter system for supporting all kinds of datastores.  Officially supported databases include [MySQL](https://npmjs.com/package/sails-mysql), [PostgreSQL](https://npmjs.com/package/sails-postgresql), [MongoDB](https://npmjs.com/package/sails-mongo), [Redis](https://npmjs.com/package/sails-redis), and [local disk / memory](https://npmjs.com/package/sails-disk).\nCommunity adapters exist for [CouchDB](https://github.com/search?q=sails+couch&nwo=codeswarm%2Fsails-couchdb-orm&search_target=global&ref=cmdform), [neDB](https://github.com/adityamukho/sails-nedb), [SQLite](https://github.com/AndrewJo/sails-sqlite3/tree/0.10), [Oracle](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=%22sails+oracle%22+OR+%22waterline+oracle%22&type=Repositories&ref=searchresults), [MSSQL](https://github.com/misterGF/sails-mssqlserver), [DB2](https://github.com/search?q=sails+db2&type=Repositories&ref=searchresults), [ElasticSearch](https://github.com/search?q=%28elasticsearch+AND+sails%29+OR+%28elasticsearch+AND+waterline%29+&type=Repositories&ref=searchresults), [Riak](https://github.com/search?q=sails+riak&type=Repositories&ref=searchresults),\n[neo4j](https://www.npmjs.org/package/sails-neo4j), [OrientDB](https://github.com/appscot/sails-orientdb),\n[Amazon RDS](https://github.com/TakenPilot/sails-rds), [DynamoDB](https://github.com/TakenPilot/sails-dynamodb), [Azure Tables](https://github.com/azuqua/sails-azuretables), [RethinkDB](https://github.com/gutenye/sails-rethinkdb) and [Solr](https://github.com/sajov/sails-solr); for various 3rd-party REST APIs like Quickbooks, Yelp, and Twitter, including a configurable generic [REST API adapter](https://github.com/zohararad/sails-rest); plus some [eclectic projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmcQZD_LIAE).\n\n<!-- Core adapter logos -->\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mysql.com\">\n  <img width=\"75\" src=\"http://www.mysql.com/common/logos/powered-by-mysql-125x64.png\" alt=\"Powered by MySQL\" title=\"sails-mysql: MySQL adapter for Sails\"/>\n</a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/\"><img width=\"50\" title=\"PostgreSQL\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/OSlDDKv.png\"/></a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mongodb.org/\"><img width=\"100\" title=\"MongoDB\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/bC2j13z.png\"/></a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://redis.io/\"><img width=\"75\" title=\"Redis\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/dozv0ub.jpg\"/></a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n<!-- /core adapter logos -->\n\n> For the latest core adapters and notable community adapters, see [Available Adapters](http://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/extending-sails/adapters/available-adapters).\n\n## Tutorial Course\n- [Sailscasts](https://sailscasts.com/), taught by [Kelvin Omereshone](https://twitter.com/Dominus_Kelvin) _(English)_\n- [Full-Stack JavaScript with Sails.js and Vue.js](https://platzi.com/cursos/javascript-pro/), taught by [Mike McNeil](https://twitter.com/mikermcneil) _(in English, with optional Spanish subtitles)_\n\n\n## Books\n- [Sails.js in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/sails-js-in-action) by Mike McNeil and Irl Nathan (Manning Publications).\n- [Sails.js Essentials](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/sailsjs-essentials) by Shaikh Shahid (Packt)\n- [Pro Express.js: Part 3](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4842-0037-7_18) by Azat Mardan (Apress).\n\n## Support\nNeed help or have a question?\n- [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)](http://sailsjs.com/faq)\n- [Tutorials](http://sailsjs.com/faq#?what-are-some-good-community-tutorials)\n- [Community support](http://sailsjs.com/support)\n- [Professional/Enterprise options](http://sailsjs.com/faq#?are-there-professional-support-options)\n\n\n## Issue submission\nPlease read the [submission guidelines](http://sailsjs.com/documentation/contributing/issue-contributions) and [code of conduct](http://sailsjs.com/documentation/contributing/code-of-conduct) before opening a new issue.

Over time, after trying lots of different methodologies, we decided to crystallize all of our best practices into this framework.  Six years later, Sails is now one of the most widely-used web application frameworks in the world.

          "content": "# Sails Roadmap\n\nAs of November 2017, the Sails project roadmap is now managed [on Trello](https://trello.com/b/s9zEnyG7) to allow for simpler feedback and collaboration.\n\nThe \"Bugs/Priority\" and \"Frontlog\" columns on Trello consist of relatively hashed-out proposals for useful features or patches which would be excellent places to contribute code to the Sails framework. We would exuberantly accept a pull request implementing any of the Trello cards in these columns, so long as that pull request was accompanied with reasonable tests that prove it, all code changes adhere to the style guide laid out in the `.eslintrc` file, and it doesn't cause breaking changes to any other core functionality.\n\n> Community proposals can still be made as pull requests against this file-- but instead of managing status updates here, once approved, they are now managed on the [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/s9zEnyG7).  See \"Pending Proposals\" below for more on that.\n\n\n> ##### What's up with Sails v1.0?\n>\n> For the latest news on Sails v1.0 and beyond, and to check out specific changes and new features, see https://trello.com/b/s9zEnyG7.  (Please feel free to contribute by leaving comments on cards!  It helps the core team to verify that the new release is working as expected.)\n>\n> You can find more information about installing v1.0 here: http://sailsjs.com/documentation/upgrading/to-v-1-0\n\n\n\n## Pending Proposals\n\nThe table below consists of pending proposals for useful features which are not currently in the official roadmap on Trello.  To submit a proposal, send a pull request adding a row to this column.  Please see the Sails [contribution guide](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.\n\n> - If you would like to see a new feature or an enhancement to an existing feature in Sails, please review the [Sails contribution guide](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). When you are ready, submit a pull request adding a new row to the bottom of this table.\n> - Check [the official Sails roadmap on Trello](https://trello.com/b/s9zEnyG7) to make sure there isn't already something similar feature already planned, in discussion, or under active development.\n> - In your pull request, please include a detailed proposal with a short summary of your use case, the reason why you cannot implement the feature as a hook, adapter, or generator, and a well-reasoned explanation of how you think that feature could be implemented.  Your proposal should include changes or additions to usage, expected return values, and any errors or exit conditions.\n> - Once your pull request has been created, add an additional commit which links to it from your new row in the table below.\n> - If there is sufficient interest in the proposal from other contributors, a core team member will close your PR and add a new card for the proposal to the appropriate column [on Trello](https://trello.com/b/s9zEnyG7).\n\n\nFeature                                          | Proposal                                                                              | Summary\n :---------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Allow select/omit clauses when populating a singular association | https://trello.com/c/yM9WPxzr/107-waterline-fs2q-tolerate-a-subcriteria-being-provided-to-populate-for-a-singular-associations-but-only-if-it-exclusively-contains | Don't throw an error if these clauses are included in a `populate` for a singular association (but still error if actual \"where\" criteria are used)\n Generate `test/` folder in new Sails apps       | [#2499](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/pull/2499#issuecomment-171556544)        | Generate a generic setup for mocha tests in all new Sails apps.

Also allows for easier sharing of responsibility w/ the community, controls issue flow.  Started with github.com/balderdashy/sails-hook-sockets\n~~Allow disabling session mw for static assets~~    | ~~Allow session handling to be turned off for static assets. In certain situations, a request for a static asset concurrent to a request to a controller action can have undesirable consequences; specifically, a race condition can occur wherein the static asset response ends up overwriting changes that were made to the session in the controller action.  Luckily, this is a very rare issue, and only occurs when there are race conditions from two different simultaneous requests sent from the same browser with the same cookies.  If you encounter this issue today, first think about whether you actually need/want to do things this way.  If you absolutely need this functionality, a workaround is to change the order of middleware or override the `session` middleware implementation in `config/http.js`.  However, for the long-term, we need a better solution.  It would be good to improve the default behavior of our dependency, `express-session` so that it uses a smarter heuristics.  For more information, see the implementation of session persistence in [express-session](https://github.com/expressjs/session/blob/master/index.js#L207).  However, the single cleanest solution to the general case of this issue would be the ability to turn off session handling features for all static assets (or on a per-route basis).  This is easier said than done.  If you'd like to have this feature, and have the cycles/chops to implement it, please tweet @sgress454 or @mikermcneil and we can dive in and work out a plan.  Summary of what we could merge:  We could remove the default session middleware from our http middleware configuration, and instead add it as a manual step in the virtual router that runs before the route action is triggered.  Good news it that we're actually already doing this in order to support sessions [in the virtual router](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/blob/master/lib/router/index.js#L101) (e.g. for use w/ socket.io).  So the actual implementation isn't a lot of work-- just needs some new automated tests written, as well as a lot of manual testing (including w/ redis sessions).  We also need to update our HTTP docs to explain that requests for static assets no longer create a session by default, and that default HTTP session support is no longer configured via Express's middleware chain (handled by the virtual router instead.)  Finally we'd also need to document how to enable sessions for assets (i.e. attaching the express-session middleware in `config/http.js`, but doing so directly _before_ the static middleware runs so that other routes don't try to retrieve/save the session twice).  [@sgress454](https://github.com/sgress454)~~\nManual migrations in Sails CLI                  | For production environments it would be nice to have a save/secure command that creates the db automatically for you; e.g. a `sails migrate` or `sails create-db` command.  See [sails-migrations](https://github.com/BlueHotDog/sails-migrations) and [sails-db-migrate](https://github.com/building5/sails-db-migrate) for inspiration.  We should begin by contributing and using one or both of these modules in production in order to refine them further into a full fledged proposal (the Sails core team is using sails-migrations currently).  Originally suggested by [@globegitter](https://github.com/Globegitter).\nWildcard action policies                        | Instead of only having one global action policy `'*'` it would be nice if we could define policies for a specific action in all controllers: `'*/destroy': ['isOwner']` or something similar.
