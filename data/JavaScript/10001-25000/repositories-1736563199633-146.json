          "content": "Code of Conduct\n---------------\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nThis code of conduct *governs how we behave* in any forum and whenever we will be judged by our actions. We expect it to be honoured by everyone who participates in the PouchDB community formally or informally, or claims any affiliation with the project.\n\nThis code of conduct also *applies to all spaces* managed by the PouchDB project, including IRC, all public and private mailing lists, the issue tracker, the wiki, the blogs, Twitter, and any other forum which the community uses for communication.\n\nThis code is not *exhaustive or complete*. It serves to distill our common understanding of a collaborative, shared environment and goals. We expect it to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter, so that it can enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.\n\nSpecific Guidelines\n-------------------\n\nWe strive to:\n\n  1. **Be open**. We invite anyone to participate in our community, we preferably use public methods of communication for project-related messages, unless discussing something sensitive. This applies to messages for help or PouchDB-related support, too; not only is a public support request much more likely to result in an answer to a question, it also makes sure that any inadvertent mistakes made by people answering will be more easily detected and corrected.\n\n  2. **Be empathetic**, welcoming, friendly, and patient: We work together to resolve conflict, assume good intentions, and do our best to act in an empathetic fashion. We may all experience some frustration from time to time, but we do not allow frustration to turn into a personal attack. A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. We should be respectful when dealing with other community members as well as with people outside our community.\n\n  3. **Be collaborative**. Our work will be used by other people, and in turn we will depend on the work of others. When we make something for the benefit of the project, we are willing to explain to others how it works, so that they can build on the work to make it even better. Any decision we make will affect users and colleagues, and we take those consequences seriously when making decisions.\n\n  4. **Be inquisitive**. Nobody knows everything! Asking questions early avoids many problems later, so questions are encouraged, though they may be directed to the appropriate forum. Those who are asked should be responsive and helpful, within the context of our shared goal of improving PouchDB.\n\n  5. **Be careful in the words that we choose**. Whether we are participating as professionals or volunteers, we value professionalism in all interactions, and take responsibility for our own speech. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behaviour are not acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:\n    Violent threats or language directed against another person.\n    Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.\n    Posting sexually explicit or violent material.\n    Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information (\"doxing\").\n    Sharing private content, such as emails sent privately or non-publicly, or unlogged forums such as IRC channel history.\n    Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.\n    Unwelcome sexual attention.\n    Excessive or unnecessary profanity.\n    Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.\n    Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.\n\n  6. **Be concise**. Keep in mind that what you write once will be read by hundreds of persons. Writing a short email means people can understand the conversation as efficiently as possible. Short emails should always strive to be empathetic, welcoming, friendly and patient. When a long explanation is necessary, consider adding a summary.\n\n    Try to bring new ideas to a conversation so that each mail adds something unique to the thread, keeping in mind that the rest of the thread still contains the other messages with arguments that have already been made.\n\n    Try to stay on topic, especially in discussions that are already fairly large.\n\n  7. **Step down considerately**: Members of every project come and go. When somebody leaves or disengages from the project they should tell people they are leaving and take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where they left off. In doing so, they should remain respectful of those who continue to participate in the project and should not misrepresent the project's goals or achievements. Likewise, community members should respect any individual's choice to leave the project.\n\nDiversity Statement\n-------------------\n\nPouchDB welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. We are committed to being a community that everyone feels good about joining. Although we may not be able to satisfy everyone, we will always work to treat everyone well.\n\nNo matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you. Though no list can hope to be comprehensive, we explicitly honour diversity in: age, culture, ethnicity, genotype, gender identity or expression, language, national origin, neurotype, phenotype, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, subculture and technical ability.\n\nThough we welcome people fluent in all languages, PouchDB development is conducted in English.\n\nStandards for behaviour in the PouchDB community are detailed in the Code of Conduct above. We expect participants in our community to meet these standards in all their interactions and to help others to do so as well.\n\n\nReporting Guidelines\n--------------------\n\nPouchDB maintainers have the primary responsibility to ensure this code of conduct is adhered to however all in the community are invited to participate in cultivating a respectful atmosphere. If you believe someone is violating this code of conduct, you may reply to them and point out this code of conduct. Such messages may be in public or in private, whatever is most appropriate. However, regardless of whether the message is public or not, it should still adhere to the relevant parts of this code of conduct; in particular, it should not be abusive or disrespectful. Should there be difficulties in dealing with the situation, you may report your compliance issues in confidence dale@arandomurl.com.\n\nAnyone violating the code of conduct will be notified and asked to stop, if anyone repeatedly violates the code of conduct then the actions may include but not be limited to closing problematic bugs, temporary or permanent exclusion from GitHub, mailing lists or other PouchDB controlled communities.\n\nEndnotes\n--------\n\nThis Code defines empathy as \"a vicarious participation in the emotions, ideas, or opinions of others; the ability to imagine oneself in the condition or predicament of another.\" Empathetic is the adjectival form of empathy.\n\nThis document was derived primarily from the [Apache CouchDB Code of Conduct](http://couchdb.apache.org/conduct.html) with thanks.

          "content": "[PouchDB](http://pouchdb.com/) - The JavaScript Database that Syncs\n==================================================\n\nWelcome, so you are thinking about contributing to PouchDB? Awesome, this is a great place to start.\n\nGet in Touch\n------------\n\nThe following documentation should answer most of the common questions about how to get starting contributing, if you have any questions, please feel free to get in touch @ [the Google Groups mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pouchdb), and [on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pouchdb). Or you can [tweet @pouchdb](http://twitter.com/pouchdb).\n\nMost project discussions should happen on the Mailing list / Bug Tracker, however if you are a first time contributor and want some help getting started feel free to send a private email to any of the following maintainers:\n\n * Dale Harvey (dale@arandomurl.com)\n\nHelp Wanted\n----------------\n\nIf you are looking for something to work on, we try to maintain a list of issues that should be suitable for first time contributions, they can be found tagged [help-wanted](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues?labels=help-wanted&state=open).\n\nTriage\n----------------\n\nBugs that get filed have no labels [and are triaged](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+no%3Alabel). A bug should be given one of the following labels: bug, enhancement, needs-reproducing, question during triage. Issues with the `bug` label will not be marked stale.\n\n\nGuide to Contributions\n--------------------------------------\n\n  * Almost all Pull Requests for features or bug fixes will need tests\n  * We follow [Felix's Node.js Style Guide](https://github.com/felixge/node-style-guide)\n  * Almost all Pull Requests for features or bug fixes will need tests (seriously, it's really important)\n  * Commit messages should follow the following style:\n\n```\n(#99) - A brief one line description < 50 chars\n\nFollowed by further explanation if needed, this should be wrapped at\naround 72 characters. Most commits should reference an existing\nissue\n```\n\nDependencies\n--------------------------------------\n\nPouchDB needs the following to be able to build and test your build, if you haven't installed them then best to do so now, we will wait.\n\n  * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)\n\n**On Windows?** PouchDB's build and tests work on Windows, but you will have to follow [Microsoft's guidelines for Windows](https://github.com/Microsoft/nodejs-guidelines/blob/master/windows-environment.md#environment-setup-and-configuration) to ensure you can install and compile native add-ons. Also, we recommend [Git Bash for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) because our build relies on many Bash- and Unix-isms. Another option is [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux).\n\nBuilding PouchDB\n--------------------------------------\n\nAll dependencies installed? Great, now building PouchDB itself is a breeze:\n\n    $ cd pouchdb\n    $ npm install\n    $ npm run build\n\nYou will now have various distributions of PouchDB in your `dist` folder, congratulations.\n\nNote that the source code is in `src/`, which is built by [Rollup](http://rollupjs.org/) as a\nNode module to `lib/`, which is then built by [Browserify](http://browserify.com/) as a browser-ready\nUMD module to `dist/`. All of this logic is in `bin/build.sh`.\n\nTesting PouchDB\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe main PouchDB test suite can be run with:\n\n    $ npm test\n\nIf you would like to test against your a CouchDB instance you are currently running you can specify that with `COUCH_HOST`:\n\n    $ COUCH_HOST=\"http://127.0.0.1:5984\" npm test\n\nThere is more information about the various test suites and testing options in [TESTING](./TESTING.md).\n\nGit Essentials\n--------------------------------------\n\nWorkflows can vary, but here is a very simple workflow for contributing a bug fix:\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb.git\n    $ git checkout -b 121-issue-keyword master\n    # Write tests + code\n    $ git add src/afile.js\n    $ git commit -m \"(#121) - A brief description of what I changed\"\n\nOnce you have some code to push, fork the [PouchDB repository](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb) then push your changes to your fork:\n\n    $ git remote add myfork https://github.com/myfork/pouchdb.git\n    $ git push origin 121-issue-keyword\n\nNow when you visit https://github.com/myfork/pouchdb there should be a button that will let you create a pull request.\n\nBuilding PouchDB Documentation\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe source for the website http://pouchdb.com is stored inside the `docs` directory of the PouchDB repository, you can make changes and submit pull requests as with any other patch. To build and view the website locally you will need to have the Ruby development package installed.\nOn Ubuntu this is done with:\n\n    $ sudo apt install -y ruby-dev\n\nYou then neet to install [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and a few other gems. Jekyll is installed using [bundler](http://bundler.io/) so you need to install that first.\nOn Ubuntu you will need root permissions to do this so prefix the ```gem``` command with ```sudo```\n\n    $ [sudo] gem install bundler\n    $ npm run install-jekyll\n\nIf you haven't already done so, you'll also need to run `npm install` to pull in packages for the dev server:\n\n    $ npm install\n\nNow you can build the site and start the dev server with:\n\n    $ npm run build-site\n\nYou should now find the documentation at http://127.0.0.1:4000\n\nWriting a PouchDB Blog Post\n--------------------------------------\n\nWriting a blog post for PouchDB is exactly the same process as other contributions; all the blog posts are kept at https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/tree/master/docs/_posts. We always welcome blog posts from new contributors!\n\n### Steps\n\n1. Open up an issue proposing the blog post if you need help getting ideas or structuring it.\n2. Add yourself as an author to https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/blob/master/docs/_data/authors.yml. (Make sure you have a [Gravatar](http://en.gravatar.com/) too.)\n3. Add a new blog post with the date that you expect it will be published (we can always change it later).\n4. Write something!\n5. Run `npm run build-site` and you will always have a fresh version of the site at localhost:4000. You may need to Cmd-Shift-R or Ctrl-Shift-R (hard refresh) to see the latest version, since we use AppCache.\n\nCommitters!\n--------------\n\nWith great power comes great responsibility yada yada yada:\n\n * Code is peer reviewed, you should not merge un-reviewed code.\n * Pushing to `master` is blocked by GitHub.\n * Cherry Pick / Rebase commits, **don't use merge commits**, see below for instructions on how to\n merge a pull request.\n * Ensure reviewed code follows the above contribution guidelines, if it doesn't feel free to amend and make note.\n * Please try to watch when Pull Requests are made and review and / or commit them in a timely manner.\n * After you merge in a patch use tin to update the version accordingly. Run `tin -v x.x.x-prerelease` with x.x.x being the previous version upgraded appropriately via semver. When we are ready to publish to npm we can remove the `-prerelease`.\n * Thanks, you are all awesome human beings.\n\n**How to merge a pull request**\n  * Use the github Pull Request UI.\n  * Generally, use _Squash and merge_.\n  * In special circumstances, _Rebase and merge_ may be used.  It may be appropriate where intermediate commits in a pull request:\n    * meet standard requirements for commit messages; and\n    * are important for future understanding of a sequence of related changes; and\n    * cannot be broken down into separate pull requests.\n  * Make sure the issue associated with the pull request is closed, if the issue was resolved by that pull request.\n\nRelease Procedure\n-----------------\n\n * Copy the last release post from ./docs/_posts/date-pouchdb-version.md, amend date and version and fill in release notes\n * Push release post\n * `npm run set-version -- $VERSION`\n * `npm run release`. Note that with 2FA in npm, it will request you an OTP for every package.\n * Copy the `dist/pouchdb*` files from the $VERSION tag on github, paste the release notes and add the distribution files to Github Releases, rename `pouchdb.min.js` to `pouchdb-$VERSION.min.js` (same with `pouchdb.js`) after you upload it.\n * Update docs/_config.yml to the current version\n * Push updated versions to master\n * `npm run publish-site`\n\nTo do a dry run release, you can run:\n\n    DRY_RUN=1 npm run release\n\nTo do a beta release to npm (using the dist-tag `beta`), do:\n\n    BETA=1 npm run release\n"

Or you can [mastodon @pouchdb](https://fosstodon.org/@pouchdb)!\n\nIf you think you've found a bug in PouchDB, please write a reproducible test case and file [a Github issue](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues).\n\nPrerelease builds\n----\n\nIf you like to live on the bleeding edge, you can build PouchDB from source using these steps:\n\n    git clone https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb.git\n    cd pouchdb\n    npm install\n\nAfter running these steps, the browser build can be found in `packages/node_modules/pouchdb/dist/pouchdb.js`.\n\nChangelog\n----\n\nPouchDB follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/). To see a changelog with all PouchDB releases, check out the [Github releases page](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/releases).\n\nFor a concise list of breaking changes, there's the [wiki list of breaking changes](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/wiki/Breaking-changes).\n\nKeep in mind that PouchDB is auto-migrating, so a database created in 1.0.0 will still work if you open it in 4.0.0+. Any release containing a migration is clearly marked in the release notes.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nWe're always looking for new contributors! If you'd like to try your hand at writing code, writing documentation, designing the website, writing a blog post, or answering [questions on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/search?tab=newest&q=pouchdb), then we'd love to have your input.\n\nIf you have a pull request that you'd like to submit, please read the [contributing guide](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for info on style, commit message format, and other (slightly!) nitpicky things like that. PouchDB is heavily tested, so you'll also want to check out the [testing guide](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/blob/master/TESTING.md).\n"

          "content": "# Running PouchDB Tests\n\nThis document covers all the types of tests the PouchDB project has and how to\nrun them. PouchDB has been primarily developed on Linux and macOS, if you are\nusing Windows then these instructions will have problems, we would love your\nhelp fixing them though.\n\n\n## Installation\n\nThe PouchDB test suite expects an instance of CouchDB (version 1.6.1 and above)\nrunning in [Admin Party](http://guide.couchdb.org/draft/security.html#party) on\n`http://127.0.0.1:5984` with [CORS\nenabled](https://github.com/pouchdb/add-cors-to-couchdb). See the [official\nCouchDB documentation](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/install/index.html) for\na guide on how to install CouchDB.\n\nIf you have CouchDB available at a different URL, you can assign this URL to the\n`COUCH_HOST` environment variable to make the PouchDB tests use it.\n\nYou can run CouchDB v3.0 or later, which no longer supports Admin Party, but you\nwill need to put user credentials in the `COUCH_HOST` URL to allow new databases\nto be created, for example:\n\n    COUCH_HOST='http://admin:password@localhost:5984'\n\nIf you use docker, you can start the CouchDB instance with:\n\n    $ docker run -e COUCHDB_USER=admin -e COUCHDB_PASSWORD=password -it --name my-couchdb -p 5984:5984 couchdb:latest\n\n    # to have a couchdb with enabled cors, you can use trivago/couchdb-cors\n    $ docker run -e COUCHDB_USER=admin -e COUCHDB_PASSWORD=password -it --name my-couchdb -p 5984:5984 trivago/couchdb-cors:latest\n\n\n## Running the integration tests\n\nThe main test suite can be run using the following command:\n\n    $ npm test\n\nPouchDB runs in the browser and on Node.js, and has multiple different storage\nbackends known as _adapters_. In the browser these are `idb`, `indexeddb` and\n`memory` and on Node.js they're `leveldb` and `memory`.\n\nIt also includes an adapter named `http`, which works by delegating operations\nto CouchDB (or anything that's API-compatible with it) over the network. Since\nPouchDB replicates the functionality of CouchDB and speaks its replication\nprotocol, it's important we maintain compatibility with CouchDB and that all\ntests pass against it. The variable `COUCH_HOST` sets the URL that PouchDB will\nuse to connect to a remote server.\n\nBy default, `npm test` will run the integration tests on Node.js, using the\ndefault adapter for the target environment. Some of the tests perform\nreplication to a remote server, and by default we start an instance of\n`pouchdb-express-router` for this purpose.\n\n### Test options\n\nThe integration tests support the following options, configured via environment\nvariables.\n\n#### `ADAPTERS` (default: depends on `CLIENT`)\n\nComma-separated list of preferred adapter backends that PouchDB will use for local\ndatabases. These are selected automatically based on the execution environment,\nbut this variable overrides the default choice and causes additional adapters to\nbe loaded if they're not part of the default distribution.\n\nOn Node.js the available local adapters are `leveldb` and `memory`. In the\nbrowser they're `idb`, `indexeddb` and `memory`.\n\nYou can also set `ADAPTERS=http` to force all PouchDB databases to be created on\na remote server, identified by `COUCH_HOST`. This is not necessary for\nintegration tests since they use a mixture of local and remote databases to\ncheck compatibility, but it's useful for the `find` and `mapreduce` suites.\n\n#### `AUTO_COMPACTION` (default: `0`)\n\nSet this to `1` to enable automatic compaction of PouchDB databases by default.\n\n#### `BAIL` (default: `1`)\n\nNormally the test runner will halt as soon as it discovers a failing test. Set\nthis to `0` to prevent this behaviour.\n\n#### `CLIENT` (default: `node`)\n\nSets the target platform the tests will execute on. Set this to\n`firefox`, `chromium` or `webkit` to execute the tests in the browser.\n\n#### `COUCH_HOST`\n\nSome tests perform replication between local and remote databases. When we\ncreate a remote database, we get the URL of the remote server from `COUCH_HOST`.\nThis variable must be set to the URL of a CouchDB-compatible HTTP server, with\nCORS enabled.\n\nIf not set explicitly, this variable is set automatically based on the other\nconfiguration values.\n\n#### `FETCH` (default: `0`)\n\nSet this to `1` to stop PouchDB falling back to `XMLHttpRequest` if `fetch()` is\nnot available.\n\n#### `GREP`\n\nUse this to request that a specific test is run; if you set `GREP='name of\ntest'` then only those tests whose names include the string `name of test` will\nrun.  Regular expressions are also supported.\n\n#### `PLUGINS` (default: empty)\n\nComma-separated list of additional plugins that should be loaded into the test\nenvironment. For example:\n\n    $ PLUGINS=pouchdb-find npm test\n\n#### `POUCHDB_SRC`\n\nThis overrides the path used to load PouchDB in the browser. We use this in CI\nto select different builds of the PouchDB library, for example to test the\nWebpack version, etc.\n\nThis is an alternative to `SRC_ROOT` and `USE_MINIFIED`.\n\n#### `SRC_ROOT`\n\nThis overrides the path used to load all PouchDB files in the browser. We use\nthis in performance tests to allow easily comparing two different versions of\nPouchDB, including plugin and adapter implementations.\n\n#### `USE_MINIFIED`\n\nThis changes the file extension used for loading PouchDB files in the browser.\nThis can be used in CI and performance testing to select the minified version of\nPouchDB and its adapters, plugins, etc.\n\n#### `SERVER` (default: `pouchdb-express-router`)\n\nTo support remote replication tests, we start a server in the background that\nspeaks the CouchDB replication protocol. This variable controls how that is\ndone, and what `COUCH_HOST` is set to as a result. It can have one of the\nfollowing values:\n\n- `pouchdb-express-router` (default): a minimal implementation of the CouchDB\n  API that supports the replication protocol but not the `query()` or `find()`\n  methods.\n- `pouchdb-server`: this is a full reimplementation of the CouchDB API on top of\n  PouchDB, including Mango and map-reduce queries.\n- `couchdb-master`: use this value if you already have CouchDB running; it\n  causes `COUCH_HOST` to be set to the correct value.\n\n#### `SKIP_MIGRATION` (default: `0`)\n\nSet this to `1` to skip the migration tests.\n\n#### `VIEW_ADAPTERS` (default: `memory`)\n\nComma-separated list of preferred view adapter backends that PouchDB will use. \nThis variable overrides the default choice and causes additional adapters to\nbe loaded if they're not part of the default distribution.\n\nOn Node.js the available adapters are `leveldb` and `memory`. In the\nbrowser they're `idb`, `indexeddb` and `memory`.\n\n\n## Other sets of tests\n\n### `find` and `mapreduce`\n\nThe integration tests cover all the core functionality of CouchDB. Some\nadditional behaviour is covered by separate test suites, either because they\ncontain features not supported in every adapter, or because they take a long\ntime to run.\n\nThe main additional suites are the `find` and `mapreduce` suites, which can be\nrun using these commands:\n\n    $ TYPE=find PLUGINS=pouchdb-find npm test\n    $ TYPE=mapreduce npm test\n\nThese suites run all their tests against a single adapter per run; they will use\nthe default adapter for the target environment, which is Node.js by default.\nThese suites support most of the same options as the integration tests.\n\nYou'll want to test specific adapters by specifying them on the command-line,\nfor example:\n\n    # run the \"find\" tests with the memory client on node.js\n    $ TYPE=find PLUGINS=pouchdb-find CLIENT=node ADAPTERS=memory npm test\n\n    # run the \"mapreduce\" tests with indexeddb in firefox\n    $ TYPE=mapreduce CLIENT=firefox ADAPTERS=indexeddb npm test\n\nIt's also important to check these tests against server-side adapters,\nspecifically we need to ensure compatibility with CouchDB itself. We do this by\nsetting `ADAPTERS=http` and pointing `COUCH_HOST` at our server:\n\n    $ TYPE=mapreduce ADAPTERS=http COUCH_HOST='<your CouchDB URL>' npm test\n\nAnd we test [pouchdb-server](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb-server) using\nthe current PouchDB source tree. This is an implementation of the CouchDB API\nand supports the `find()` and `query()` methods. Run the test suites against it\nlike so:\n\n    $ TYPE=mapreduce ADAPTERS=http SERVER=pouchdb-server npm test\n\nNote that the default choice for the `SERVER` value (`pouchdb-express-router`)\ndoes not support `find` or `mapreduce` and does not need to pass these tests.\n\n### \"Fuzzy\" tests\n\nThis test suite checks some more unusual replication scenarios, it can be run\nusing the command:\n\n    $ npm run test-fuzzy\n\n### Performance tests\n\nThe performance test suite is run using the `PERF` variable:\n\n    $ PERF=1 npm test\n\nThis supports most of the same options as the integration suite, particularly\nthe `CLIENT`, `ADAPTERS` and `GREP` options. It has some additional options of\nits own:\n\n#### `ITERATIONS`\n\nSets the number of iterations each test uses by default.\n\n### Running tests in the browser\n\nTo run tests in the browser, you first have to install playwright:\n\n```shell\nnpx playwright install\n```\n\nThis will download the `firefox`, `chromium` and `webkit` `CLIENT`s onto\nyour system.\n\nPouchDB is tested with `CLIENT=firefox`, `CLIENT=chromium` and `CLIENT=webkit`\nto run a set of tests in the browser automatically. This runs these browsers\nin a “headless” mode and prints the test results back into the terminal.\n\n    $ CLIENT=firefox npm test\n\nYou can also run browser tests in a more \"manual\" fashion by running the dev\nserver and opening a browser window yourself. To run the server:\n\n    $ npm run dev\n\nThen you can open the page for any of the test suites via the following URLs:\n\n- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/tests/integration/`\n- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/tests/find/`\n- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/tests/mapreduce/`\n- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/tests/performance/`\n\nThe test options are controlled by editing the query string; some of the common\ncommand-line options and their query string equivalents are:\n\n| Environment variable | Query-string param |\n| -------------------- | ------------------ |\n| `ADAPTERS`           | `adapters`         |\n| `AUTO_COMPACTION`    | `autoCompaction`   |\n| `COUCH_HOST`         | `couchHost`        |\n| `GREP`               | `grep`             |\n| `ITERATIONS`         | `iterations`       |\n| `PLUGINS`            | `plugins`          |\n| `SRC_ROOT`           | `srcRoot`          |\n| `POUCHDB_SRC`        | `src`              |\n| `USE_MINIFIED`       | `useMinified`      |\n| `VIEW_ADAPTERS`      | `viewAdapters`     |\n\n\n## Other test tasks\n\nThere are a few other tasks we run during CI and which you will find useful to\nrun during development.\n\n### `npm run eslint`\n\nChecks that all code in the project follows our formatting and style guide. This\nruns before any other tasks are run during our CI build.\n\n### `npm run test-unit`\n\nRuns the unit tests; running these can give more precise feedback about key\nbuilding blocks that are not working.\n\n### `npm run test-component`\n\nTests some additional components besides the core database functionality, for\nexample authentication and read-only replication.\n\n### `npm run test-coverage`\n\nRuns the test suite with coverage analysis turned on.\n\n### `npm run test-webpack`\n\nChecks that the Webpack build of PouchDB works correctly.\n\n### `npm run verify-build`\n\nChecks that the build is correct.\n"
