          "content": "# Contributing to Shields\n\nShields is a community project. We invite your participation through\nfinancial contributions, issues, and pull requests!\n\n## Ways you can help\n\n### Financial contributions\n\nWe welcome financial contributions in full transparency on our\n[open collective](https://opencollective.com/shields).\n\n### Contributing code\n\nThis project has quite a backlog of suggestions! If you're new to the project,\nmaybe you'd like to open a pull request to address one of them:\n\n[![GitHub issues by-label](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/badges/shields/good%20first%20issue.svg)](https://github.com/badges/shields/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)\n\n### Contributing documentation\n\nYou can help by improving the project's usage and developer instructions.\n\nTutorials are in [/doc](https://github.com/badges/shields/tree/master/doc):\n\n- When you read the documentation, you can fix mistakes and add your own thoughts.\n- When your pull request follows the documentation but the practice changed,\n  consider pointing this out and change the documentation for the next person.\n\nAPI documentation is at [contributing.shields.io](https://contributing.shields.io/):\n\n- This documentation is generated by annotating the code with\n  [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/about-getting-started.html) comments.\n  [Example](https://github.com/badges/shields/blob/b3be4d94d5ef570b8daccfd088c343a958988843/core/base-service/base-json.js#L26-L41)\n- Adding a JSDoc comment to some existing code is a great first contribution\n  and a good way to familiarize yourself with the codebase\n\n### Helping others\n\nYou can help with code review, which reduces bugs, and over time has a\nwonderful side effect of making the code more readable and therefore more\napproachable. It's also a great way to teach and learn. Feel free to jump in!\nBe welcoming, appreciative, and helpful. You can perform first reviews of\nsimple changes, like badge additions. These are usually tagged with\n[service badge][service badge pr tag].\n\nPlease review [these impeccable guidelines][code review guidelines].\n\nYou can monitor [issues][], [discussions][] and the [chat room][], and help\nother people who have questions about contributing to Shields, or using it\nfor their projects.\n\nFeel free to reach out to one of the [maintainers][]\nif you need help getting started.\n\n[service badge pr tag]: https://github.com/badges/shields/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3Aservice-badge\n[code review guidelines]: https://kickstarter.engineering/a-guide-to-mindful-communication-in-code-reviews-48aab5282e5e\n[issues]: https://github.com/badges/shields/issues\n[discussions]: https://github.com/badges/shields/discussions\n[chat room]: https://discordapp.com/invite/HjJCwm5\n[maintainers]: https://github.com/badges/shields#project-leaders\n\n### Suggesting improvements\n\nThere are _a lot_ of suggestions on file. You can help by weighing in on these\nsuggestions, which helps convey community need to other contributors who might\npick them up.\n\nThere is no need to post a new comment. Just add a :thumbsup: or :heart: to\nthe top post.\n\nIf you have a suggestion of your own, [search the open issues][issues]. If you\ndon't see it, feel free to [open a new issue][open an issue].\n\n[open an issue]: https://github.com/badges/shields/issues/new/choose\n\n### Requesting new logos\n\nWe consume logos via [the SimpleIcons project][simple-icons github], and\nencourage you to contribute logos there. Please review their\n[guidance][simple-icons contributing] before doing so.\n\n[simple-icons github]: https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons\n[simple-icons contributing]: https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md\n\n### Spreading the word\n\nFeel free to star the repository. This will help increase the visibility of the project, therefore attracting more users and contributors to Shields!\n\nWe're also asking for [donations](https://opencollective.com/shields) from developers who use and love Shields, please spread the word!\n\n## Getting help\n\nThere are three places to get help:\n\n1. If you're new to the project, a good place to start is the [tutorial][].\n2. If you need help getting started or implementing a change, [start a discussion][discussions]\n   with your question. We promise it's okay to do that. If there is already an\n   issue open for the feature you're working on, you can post there directly.\n3. You can also join the [chat room][] and ask your question there.\n\n[tutorial]: doc/TUTORIAL.md\n\n## Badge guidelines\n\n- Shields.io hosts integrations for services which are primarily\n  used by developers or which are widely used by developers.\n- The left-hand side of a badge should not advertise. It should be a lowercase _noun_\n  succinctly describing the meaning of the right-hand side.\n- Except for badges using the `social` style, logos and links should be _turned off by\n  default_.\n- Badges should not obtain data from undocumented or reverse-engineered API endpoints.\n- Badges should not obtain data by scraping web pages - these are likely to break frequently.\n  Whereas API publishers are incentivised to maintain a stable platform for their users,\n  authors of web pages have no such incentive.\n- Badges may require users to specify a token in the badge URL as long it is scoped only to\n  fetching information and doesn't expose any sensitive information. Generating a token with the\n  correct scope must be clearly documented.\n\n## Badge URLs\n\n- The format of new badges should be of the form `/SERVICE/NOUN/PARAMETERS`.\n- There is further documentation on this in [badge-urls](https://github.com/badges/shields/blob/master/doc/badge-urls.md)\n\n## Coding guidelines\n\n### Prettier\n\nThis project formats its source code using Prettier. The most enjoyable way to\nuse Prettier is to let it format code for you when you save. You can [integrate\nit into your editor][integrate prettier].\n\nWhether you integrate it into your editor or not, a pre-commit hook will run\nPrettier before a commit by default.\n\n[integrate prettier]: https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html\n\n### Tests\n\nWhen adding or changing a service [please write tests][service-tests], and ensure the [title of your Pull Requests follows the required conventions](#running-service-tests-in-pull-requests) to ensure your tests are executed.\nWhen changing other code, please add unit tests.\n\nThe integration tests are not run by default. For most contributions it is OK to skip these unless you're working directly on the code for storing the GitHub token pool in postgres.\n\nTo run the integration tests:\n\n- You must have PostgreSQL installed. Use `brew install postgresql`, `apt-get install postgresql`, etc.\n- Set a connection string either with an env var `POSTGRES_URL=postgresql://user:pass@127.0.0.1:5432/db_name` or by using\n  ```yaml\n  private:\n    postgres_url: 'postgresql://user:pass@127.0.0.1:5432/db_name'\n  ```\n  in a yaml config file.\n- Run `npm run migrate up` to apply DB migrations\n- Run `npm run test:integration` to run the tests\n\n[service-tests]: https://github.com/badges/shields/blob/master/doc/service-tests.md\n\n### Code organization\n\nThere is a [High-level code walkthrough](doc/code-walkthrough.md) describing the layout of the project.\n\n## Pull Requests\n\nAll code changes are incorporated via pull requests, and pull requests are always squashed into a single commit on merging. Therefore there's no requirement to squash commits within your PR, but feel free to squash or restructure the commits on your PR branch if you think it will be helpful. PRs with well structured commits are always easier to review!\n\nBecause all changes are pulled into the main branch via squash merges from PRs, we do **not** support overwriting any aspects of the git history once it hits our main branch. Notably this means we do not support amending commit messages, nor adjusting commit author information once merged.\n\nAccordingly, it is the responsibility of contributors to review this type of information and adjust as needed before marking PRs as ready for review and merging.\n\nYou can review and modify your local [git configuration][git-config] via `git config`, and also find more information about amending your commit messages [here][amending-commits].\n\n[git-config]: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration\n[amending-commits]: https://docs.github.com/en/github/committing-changes-to-your-project/changing-a-commit-message#rewriting-the-most-recent-commit-message\n\n### Running service tests in pull requests\n\nThe affected service names must be included in square brackets in the pull request title so that the CI engine will run those service tests. When a pull request affects multiple services, they should be separated with spaces. The test runner is case-insensitive, so they should be capitalized for readability.\n\nFor example:\n\n- **[Travis] Fix timeout issues**\n- **[Travis Sonar] Support user token authentication**\n- **Add tests for [CRAN] and [CPAN]**\n\nNote that many services are part of a \"family\" of related services. Depending on the changes in your PR you may need to run the tests for just a single service, or for _all_ the services within a family.\n\nFor example, a PR title of **[GitHubForks] Foo** will only run the service tests specifically for the GitHub Forks badge, whereas a title of **[GitHub] Foo** will run the service tests for all of the GitHub badges.\n\nIn the rare case when it's necessary to see the output of a full service-test\nrun in a PR (all 2,000+ tests), include `[*****]` in the title. Unless all the tests pass, the build\nwill fail, so likely it will be necessary to remove it and re-run the tests\nbefore merging.\n"

Click on the badge to fill in required data elements for that badge type (like your username or repo) and optionally customize (label, colors etc.). And it's ready for use!\n\nUse the button at the bottom to copy your badge url or snippet, which can then be added to places like your GitHub readme files or other web pages.\n\n## Contributing\n\nShields is a community project. We invite your participation through issues\nand pull requests! You can peruse the [contributing guidelines][contributing].\n\nWhen adding or changing a service [please add tests][service-tests].\n\nThis project has quite a backlog of suggestions! If you're new to the project,\nmaybe you'd like to open a pull request to address one of them.\n\nYou can read a [tutorial on how to add a badge][tutorial].\n\n[![GitHub issues by-label](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/badges/shields/good%20first%20issue)](https://github.com/badges/shields/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)\n\nIf you intend on reporting or contributing a fix related to security vulnerabilities, please first refer to our [security policy][security].\n\n[service-tests]: https://github.com/badges/shields/blob/master/doc/service-tests.md\n[tutorial]: https://github.com/badges/shields/blob/master/doc/TUTORIAL.md\n[contributing]: https://github.com/badges/shields/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n[security]: https://github.com/badges/shields/blob/master/SECURITY.md\n\n## Development\n\n1. Install Node 20 or later. You can use the [package manager][] of your choice.\n   Tests need to pass in Node 20 and 22.\n2. Clone this repository.\n3. Run `npm ci` to install the dependencies.\n4. Run `npm start` to start the badge server and the frontend dev server.\n5. Open `http://localhost:3000/` to view the frontend.\n\nWhen server source files change, the badge server should automatically restart\nitself (using [nodemon][]). When the frontend files change, the frontend dev\nserver (`docusaurus start`) should also automatically reload. However the badge\ndefinitions are built only before the server first starts. To regenerate those,\neither run `npm run prestart` or manually restart the server.\n\nTo debug a badge from the command line, run `npm run badge -- /npm/v/nock`.\nIt also works with full URLs like\n`npm run badge -- https://img.shields.io/npm/v/nock`.\n\nUse `npm run debug:server` to start server in debug mode.\n[This recipe][nodemon debug] shows how to debug Node.js application in [VS Code][].\n\nShields has experimental support for [Gitpod][gitpod], a pre-configured development\nenvironment that runs in your browser. To use Gitpod, click the button below and\nsign in with GitHub. Gitpod also offers a browser add-on, though it is not required.\nPlease report any Gitpod bugs, questions, or suggestions in issue\n[#2772](https://github.com/badges/shields/issues/2772).\n\n[![Edit with Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/badges/shields)\n\n[Snapshot tests][] ensure we don't inadvertently make changes that affect the\nSVG or JSON output. When deliberately changing the output, run\n`SNAPSHOT_DRY=1 npm run test:package` to preview changes to the saved\nsnapshots, and `SNAPSHOT_UPDATE=1 npm run test:package` to update them.\n\nThe server can be configured to use [Sentry][] ([configuration][sentry configuration]) and [Prometheus][] ([configuration][prometheus configuration]).\n\nOur [full test suite][full test suite] as well as [code coverage][code coverage] are run on a daily basis.\n\n[package manager]: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/\n[gitpod]: https://www.gitpod.io/\n[snapshot tests]: https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/snapshot-testing/\n[prometheus]: https://prometheus.io/\n[prometheus configuration]: https://github.com/badges/shields/blob/master/doc/self-hosting.md#prometheus\n[sentry]: https://sentry.io/\n[sentry configuration]: https://github.com/badges/shields/blob/master/doc/self-hosting.md#sentry\n[nodemon]: https://nodemon.io/\n[nodemon debug]: https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-recipes/tree/master/nodemon\n[vs code]: https://code.visualstudio.com/\n[full test suite]: https://github.com/badges/shields/actions/workflows/daily-tests.yml\n[code coverage]: https://coveralls.io/github/badges/shields\n\n## Hosting your own server\n\nThere is documentation about [hosting your own server][self-hosting].\n\n[self-hosting]: https://github.com/badges/shields/blob/master/doc/self-hosting.md\n\n## Related projects\n\n[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)\n\nStatus badges are used widely across open-source and private software projects.\nAcademics have studied the \"signal\" badges provide about software project\nquality. There are many existing libraries for rendering these badges, and\nalternatives to the hosted Shields badge service. [awesome-badges][] is a\ncurated collection of such resources.\n[Contributions][contributing to awesome-badges] may be considered there.\n(The presence of a project in that collection should not be interpreted as an endorsement nor promotion from the Shields project)\n\n[awesome-badges]: https://github.com/badges/awesome-badges\n[contributing to awesome-badges]: https://github.com/badges/awesome-badges/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\n\n## History\n\nb.adge.me was the original website for this service. Heroku back then had a\nthing which made it hard to use a toplevel domain with it, hence the odd\ndomain. It used code developed in 2013 from a library called\n[gh-badges][old-gh-badges], both developed by [Thaddée Tyl][espadrine].\nThe project merged with shields.io by making it use the b.adge.me code\nand closed b.adge.me.\n\nThe original badge specification was developed in 2013 by\n[Olivier Lacan][olivierlacan]. It was inspired by the Travis CI and similar\nbadges (there were a lot fewer, back then). In 2014 Thaddée Tyl redesigned\nit with help from a Travis CI employee and convinced everyone to switch to\nit. The old design is what today is called the plastic style; the new one\nis the flat style.\n\nYou can read more about [the project's inception][thread],\n[the motivation of the SVG badge specification][motivation], and\n[the specification itself][spec].\n\n[olivierlacan]: https://github.com/olivierlacan\n[espadrine]: https://github.com/espadrine\n[old-gh-badges]: https://github.com/badges/gh-badges\n[motivation]: https://github.com/badges/shields/blob/master/spec/motivation.md\n[spec]: https://github.com/badges/shields/blob/master/spec/SPECIFICATION.md\n[thread]: https://github.com/h5bp/lazyweb-requests/issues/150\n\n## Project leaders\n\nMaintainers:\n\n- [calebcartwright](https://github.com/calebcartwright)\n- [chris48s](https://github.com/chris48s)\n- [jNullj](https://github.com/jnullj)\n- [paulmelnikow](https://github.com/paulmelnikow)\n- [PyvesB](https://github.com/PyvesB)\n\nAlumni:\n\n- [Daniel15](https://github.com/Daniel15)\n- [espadrine](https://github.com/espadrine)\n- [olivierlacan](https://github.com/olivierlacan)\n- [platan](https://github.com/platan)\n- [RedSparr0w](https://github.com/RedSparr0w)\n\n## License\n\nAll assets and code are under the [CC0 LICENSE](LICENSE) and in the public\ndomain unless specified otherwise.\n\n## Community\n\nThanks to the people and companies who donate money, services or time to keep the project running.
