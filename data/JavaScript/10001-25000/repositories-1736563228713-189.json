You can use the `TemplateBot.js` file as a starting point.\n2. **Implement the `_sendPrompt()` method**: In your new bot file, implement the `_sendPrompt()` method to handle sending prompts to the AI bot.\n3. **Add a reference to your bot**: In the `src/bots/index.js` file, add a reference to your new bot.\n4. **Add translations**: Update all locale files in `src/i18n/`:\n\n   ```json\n   // filepath: src/i18n/locales/en.json\n   {\n     \"yourBot\": {\n       \"name\": \"Your Bot Name\"\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n### Basic Bot Implementation Example\n\nThis is an example of using LangChainBot. Since LangChainBot uses LangChainJS, it is easy to integrate AI bots that are already supported by LangChainJS. For detailed steps, refer to the \"Step-by-Step Guide to Adding a New AI Bot\" section below. If you prefer not to use LangChain, you can directly extend the Bot class.\n\n```javascript\n// filepath: src/bots/KnowNothingBot.js\nimport LangChainBot from '@/bots/LangChainBot';\n\nclass KnowNothingBot extends LangChainBot {\n  static _className = \"KnowNothingBot\";\n  static _name = \"Know Nothing Bot\";\n  static _description = \"A bot that knows nothing\";\n  static _version = \"1.0\";\n\n  constructor() {\n    super();\n  }\n\n  async _sendPrompt(prompt) {\n    try {\n      // Implement your bot's logic here\n      return response;\n    } catch (error) {\n      throw error;\n    }\n  }\n\n  // Required methods when extending LangChainBot\n  _setupModel() {\n    // Setup your LangChain model here\n  }\n\n  getPastRounds() {\n    // Return the number of past conversation rounds to keep\n    return 1;\n  }\n}\n\nexport default KnowNothingBot;\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide to Adding a New AI Bot\n\n1. **Create a New Bot File**: Navigate to the `src/bots/` directory and create a new file for your bot. For example, if your bot is named \"KnowNothing\", create `KnowNothingBot.js`.\n\n   Basic Bot Implementation\n\n   ```javascript\n   import Bot from '@/bots/Bot';\n\n   class KnowNothingBot extends Bot {\n       static _className = \"KnowNothingBot\";\n       static _name = \"Know Nothing Bot\";\n       static _description = \"A bot that knows nothing\";\n   }\n   ```\n\n   Or for LangChain-based Bot\n\n   ```javascript\n   import LangChainBot from '@/bots/LangChainBot';\n\n   class KnowNothingBot extends LangChainBot {\n       static _className = \"KnowNothingBot\";\n       static _name = \"Know Nothing Bot\";\n       static _description = \"A bot that knows nothing\";\n\n       _setupModel() {\n           // Setup your LangChain model here\n       }\n\n       getPastRounds() {\n           return 1;\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Implement the `_sendPrompt()` Method**: Implement the `_sendPrompt()` method to handle sending prompts to the AI bot.\n\n   ```javascript\n   async _sendPrompt(prompt) {\n       try {\n           // Your code to send the prompt to the AI bot\n           return response;\n       } catch (error) {\n           throw error;\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Add a Reference to Your Bot**: Add your bot to the `src/bots/index.js` file to ensure it is included in the application:\n\n   ```javascript\n   // First import your bot\n   import KnowNothingBot from '@/bots/KnowNothingBot';\n\n   // Add to the main bot list\n   const all = [\n     ChatGPT35Bot.getInstance(),\n     ChatGPT4Bot.getInstance(),\n     KnowNothingBot.getInstance(),  // Add your bot here\n     ...existing_bots...\n   ];\n\n   // Add to appropriate category arrays\n   export const botTags = {\n     free: [\n       bots.getBotByClassName(\"BardBot\"),\n       bots.getBotByClassName(\"KnowNothingBot\"),  // If it's free\n       ...existing_free_bots...\n     ],\n     openSource: [\n       bots.getBotByClassName(\"AlpacaBot\"),\n       bots.getBotByClassName(\"KnowNothingBot\"),  // If it's open source\n       ...existing_opensource_bots...\n     ],\n     api: [\n       bots.getBotByClassName(\"KnowNothingBot\"),  // If it uses API\n       bots.getBotByClassName(\"OpenAIAPI35Bot\"),\n       ...existing_api_bots...\n     ],\n     madeInChina: [\n       bots.getBotByClassName(\"Qihoo360AIBrainBot\"),\n       bots.getBotByClassName(\"KnowNothingBot\"),  // If it's made in China\n       ...existing_china_bots...\n     ],\n   };\n\n   // If needed, set custom user agent\n   KnowNothingBot._userAgent = \"THE_RIGHT_USER_AGENT\";\n   ```\n\n4. **Customize User-Agent (if needed)**: Some websites may restrict access to specific browsers. Set the user-agent in `KnowNothingBot.js` if required.\n\n   ```javascript\n   static _userAgent = \"THE_RIGHT_USER_AGENT\";\n   ```\n\n5. **Test Your Bot**: Run the application and test your new bot to ensure it works correctly.\n\n   ```bash\n   npm run electron:serve\n   ```\n\n6. **Submit a Pull Request**: Once you have tested your bot and ensured it works correctly, submit a pull request following the steps mentioned in the \"How to Submit Pull Requests\" section.\n\nThank you for your contributions! We appreciate your efforts and look forward to your involvement in our community.\n"

coming. Upvote your favorite bots in [these issues](https://github.com/ai-shifu/ChatALL/labels/more%20LLMs).\n\n### Note on Web-connected Bot Reliability\n\nWeb-connected AI bots (those marked with \"Web Access\") are inherently less reliable and frequently face stability issues, as service providers regularly update their web interfaces and security measures. These web-based connections rely on reverse engineering and are difficult to maintain, often breaking unexpectedly. For a dependable experience, we strongly recommend using bots that offer API access whenever possible.\n\n### Other features\n\n- Quick-prompt mode: send the next prompt without waiting for the previous request to complete\n- Save chat history locally, protect your privacy\n- Highlight the response you like, delete the bad\n- Enable/disable any bots at any time\n- Switch between one, two, or three-column view\n- Auto update to the latest version\n- Dark mode (contributed by @tanchekwei)\n- Short keys. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd> to know all of them (contributed by @tanchekwei)\n- Multiple chats (contributed by @tanchekwei)\n- Proxy setting (contributed by @msaong)\n- Prompt management (contributed by @tanchekwei)\n- Supports multiple languages (Chinese, English, German, French, Russian, Vietnamese, Korean, Japanese, Spanish, Italian)\n- Supports Windows, macOS and Linux\n\nPlanned features:\n\nYou are welcome to contribute to these features.\n\n- [ ] Deploy front-end to GitHub Pages\n\n## Privacy\n\nAll chat history, settings and login data are saved locally on your computer.\n\nChatALL collects anonymous usage data to help us improve the product. Including:\n\n- Which AI bots are prompted and how long the prompt is. Not including the prompt content.\n- How long the response is, and which response is deleted/highlighted. Not including the response content.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nChatALL is a client, not a proxy. Therefore, you must:\n\n1. Have working accounts and/or API tokens for the bots.\n2. Have reliable network connections to the bots.\n\n## Download / Install\n\nDownload from https://github.com/ai-shifu/ChatALL/releases\n\n### On Windows\n\nJust download the \\*-win.exe file and proceed with the setup.\n\n### On macOS\n\nFor Apple Silicon Mac (M1, M2 CPU), download the \\*-mac-arm64.dmg file.\n\nFor other Macs, download \\*-mac-x64.dmg file.\n\nIf you are using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), you can also install it with:\n\n```bash\nbrew install --cask chatall\n```\n\n### On Linux\n\nDebian-based Distributions: Download the .deb file, double click it and install the software.\nArch-based Distributions: You can clone ChatALL from the AUR [here](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/chatall-bin). You can install it manually or using an AUR helper like yay or paru.\nOther Distributions: Download the .AppImage file, make it executable, and enjoy the click-to-run experience. You can also use [AppimageLauncher](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher).\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you encounter any problems while using ChatALL, you can try the following methods to resolve them:\n\n1. **Refresh** - press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> or <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>.\n2. **Restart** - exit ChatALL and run it again.\n3. **Re-login** - click the settings button in the upper right corner, then click the corresponding login/logout link to relogin the website.\n4. **Create a new chat** - click the `New Chat` button and send prompt again.\n\nIf none of the above methods work, you can try **resetting ChatALL**. Note that this will delete all your settings and message history.\n\nYou can reset ChatALL by deleting the following directories:\n\n- Windows: `C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Roaming\\chatall\\`\n- Linux: `/home/<user>/.config/chatall/`\n- macOS: `/Users/<user>/Library/Application Support/chatall/`\n\nIf the problem persists, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/ai-shifu/ChatALL/issues).\n\n## For developers\n\n### Contribute a Bot\n\n[The guide](https://github.com/ai-shifu/ChatALL/wiki/%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E6%B7%BB%E5%8A%A0%E4%B8%80%E4%B8%AA%E6%96%B0%E7%9A%84-AI-%E5%AF%B9%E8%AF%9D%E6%9C%BA%E5%99%A8%E4%BA%BA) may help you.\n\n### Run\n\n```bash\nnpm install\nnpm run electron:serve\n```\n\n### Build\n\nBuild for your current platform:\n\n```bash\nnpm run electron:build\n```\n\nBuild for all platforms:\n\n```bash\nnpm run electron:build -- -wml --x64 --arm64\n```\n\n## Credits\n\n### Contributors\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/ai-shifu/ChatALL/graphs/contributors\">\n  <img src=\"https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=ai-shifu/ChatALL\" />\n</a>\n\n### Others\n\n- GPT-4 contributed much of the code\n- ChatGPT, Copilot and Google provide many solutions (ranked in order)\n- Inspired by [ChatHub](https://github.com/chathub-dev/chathub).

Ihr Verhalten kann jedoch willkürlich sein, und verschiedene Bots sind für unterschiedliche Aufgaben hervorragend geeignet. Wenn Sie die beste Erfahrung machen wollen, sollten Sie sie nicht einzeln ausprobieren. ChatALL (chinesischer Name: 齐叨) kann Anfragen an mehrere KI-Bots gleichzeitig senden und Ihnen so helfen, die besten Ergebnisse zu erzielen. Alles, was Sie tun müssen, ist [herunterladen, installieren](https://github.com/ai-shifu/ChatALL/releases) und fragen.\n\n### Sind Sie das?\n\nTypische Benutzer von ChatALL sind:\n\n- 🤠**LLM-Gurus**, die die besten Antworten oder Kreationen von LLMs finden möchten.\n- 🤓**LLM-Forscher**, die die Stärken und Schwächen verschiedener LLMs in unterschiedlichen Bereichen intuitiv vergleichen möchten.\n-

Stimmen Sie für Ihre Lieblings-Bots in [diesen Issues](https://github.com/ai-shifu/ChatALL/labels/more%20LLMs) ab.\n\n### Hinweis zur Zuverlässigkeit webbasierter KI-Bots\n\nWebbasierte KI-Bots (die mit \"Web Zugang\" gekennzeichnet sind) sind von Natur aus weniger zuverlässig und haben häufig mit Stabilitätsproblemen zu kämpfen, da Dienstanbieter ihre Webschnittstellen und Sicherheitsmaßnahmen regelmäßig aktualisieren. Diese webbasierten Verbindungen beruhen auf Reverse Engineering und sind schwer zu warten, was oft zu unerwarteten Ausfällen führt. Für eine zuverlässige Nutzung empfehlen wir dringend, wann immer möglich, Bots mit API-Zugang zu verwenden.\n\n### Weitere Funktionen\n\n- Schneller Prompt-Modus: Senden Sie den nächsten Prompt, ohne auf das Ende der vorherigen Anfrage zu warten\n- Lokale Speicherung des Chatverlaufs zum Schutz Ihrer Privatsphäre\n- Markieren Sie die Antwort, die Ihnen gefällt, und löschen Sie die schlechte Antwort\n- Aktivieren/Deaktivieren von Bots zu jeder Zeit\n- Umschalten zwischen ein-, zwei- oder dreispaltiger Ansicht\n- Automatische Aktualisierung auf die neueste Version\n- Dunkelmodus (beigetragen von @tanchekwei)\n- Tastenkombinationen. Drücken Sie <kbd>Strg</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd>, um alle zu sehen (beigetragen von @tanchekwei)\n- Mehrere Chats (beigetragen von @tanchekwei)\n- Proxy-Einstellungen (beigetragen von @msaong)\n- Prompt-Management (beigetragen von @tanchekwei)\n- Unterstützt mehrere Sprachen (Chinesisch, Englisch, Deutsch, Französisch, Russisch, Vietnamesisch, Koreanisch, Japanisch, Spanisch, Italienisch)\n- Unterstützt Windows, macOS und Linux\n\n### Geplante Funktionen\n\nSie sind herzlich eingeladen, zu diesen Funktionen beizutragen.\n\n- [ ] Frontend auf GitHub Pages bereitstellen\n\n## Datenschutz\n\nAlle Chat-Verläufe, Einstellungen und Anmeldedaten werden lokal auf Ihrem Computer gespeichert.\n\nChatALL sammelt anonyme Nutzungsdaten, um uns bei der Verbesserung des Produkts zu helfen. Dazu gehören:\n\n- Welche KI-Bots aufgefordert werden und wie lang die Eingabeaufforderung ist. Der Inhalt der Eingabeaufforderung wird nicht erfasst.\n- Wie lang die Antwort ist und welche Antwort gelöscht/markiert wird. Der Inhalt der Antwort wird nicht erfasst.\n\n## Anforderungen\n\nChatALL ist ein Client, kein Proxy. Daher müssen Sie:\n\n1. funktionierende Konten und/oder API-Tokens für die Bots haben.\n2. zuverlässige Netzwerkverbindungen zu den Bots haben.\n\n## Download / Installation\n\nDownloaden von https://github.com/ai-shifu/ChatALL/releases\n\n### Auf Windows\n\nLaden Sie einfach die Datei \\*-win.exe herunter und fahren Sie mit der Installation fort.\n\n### Auf macOS\n\nFür Apple Silicon Mac (M1, M2 CPU), laden Sie die Datei \\*-mac-arm64.dmg herunter.\n\nFür andere Macs, laden Sie die Datei \\*-mac-x64.dmg herunter.\n\nWenn Sie [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) verwenden, können Sie es auch damit installieren:\n\n```bash\nbrew install --cask chatall\n```\n\n### Auf Linux\n\nDebian-basierte Distributionen: Laden Sie die .deb-Datei herunter, doppelklicken Sie darauf und installieren Sie die Software.\nArch-basierte Distributionen: Sie können ChatALL aus dem AUR [hier](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/chatall-bin) klonen.

Sin embargo, su comportamiento puede ser aleatorio y diferentes bots sobresalen en diferentes tareas. Si quieres la mejor experiencia, no los pruebes uno por uno. ChatALL (nombre chino: 齐叨) puede enviar mensajes a varios bots de IA al mismo tiempo, ayudarlo a descubrir los mejores resultados. Todo lo que necesita hacer es [descargar, instalar](https://github.com/ai-shifu/ChatALL/releases) y preguntar.\n\n### ¿Eres tú?\n\nLos usuarios típicos de ChatALL son:\n\n- 🤠**Gurús de LLMs**, que quieren encontrar las mejores respuestas o creaciones de LLMs.\n- 🤓**Investigadores de LLM**, que desean comparar intuitivamente las fortalezas y debilidades de varios LLM en diferentes campos.\n- 😎**Desarrolladores de aplicaciones LLM**, que desean depurar rápidamente los mensajes y encontrar los modelos de base de mejor rendimiento.\n\n### Bots compatibles\n\n| IA Bots

Vota a tus bots favoritos en [estos temas](https://github.com/ai-shifu/ChatALL/labels/more%20LLMs).\n\n### Nota sobre la fiabilidad de los bots de IA basados en Web\n\nLos bots de IA basados en Web (marcados como \"Acceso Web\") son inherentemente menos fiables y frecuentemente enfrentan problemas de estabilidad. Esto se debe a que los proveedores de servicios actualizan regularmente sus interfaces web y medidas de seguridad, lo que requiere un mantenimiento constante mediante ingeniería inversa. Este tipo de conexión es difícil de mantener y puede dejar de funcionar inesperadamente. Para una experiencia más confiable, recomendamos encarecidamente utilizar bots que ofrezcan acceso API cuando sea posible.\n\n### Otras características\n\n- Modo de solicitud rápida: envíe la siguiente solicitud sin esperar a que se complete la solicitud anterior\n- Guarde el historial de chat localmente, proteja su privacidad\n- Resalta la respuesta que te gusta, elimina la mala\n- Habilite/deshabilite cualquier bot en cualquier momento\n- Cambiar entre una vista de una, dos o tres columnas\n- Actualización automática a la última versión\n- Modo oscuro (contribución de @tanchekwei)\n- Teclas cortas.

Cependant, leur comportement peut être aléatoire et différents robots excellent dans différentes tâches. Si vous voulez la meilleure expérience, ne les essayez pas un par un. ChatALL (nom chinois : 齐叨) peut envoyer des invites à plusieurs robots IA simultanément afin de vous permettre de sélectionner la réponse qui vous semblera la plus pertinente. Tout ce que vous avez à faire est de [télécharger, installer](https://github.com/ai-shifu/ChatALL/releases) et poser votre question.\n\n### Est-ce vous ?\n\nLes utilisateurs typiques de ChatALL sont :\n\n- 🤠**Experts en LLMs**, qui veulent trouver les meilleures réponses ou créations des LLMs.\n- 🤓**Chercheurs en LLMs**, qui veulent comparer intuitivement les forces et les faiblesses des différents LLMs dans divers domaines.\n- 😎**Développeurs d'applications LLM**, qui veulent déboguer rapidement les invites et trouver les modèles de base les plus performants.\n\n### Bots pris en

le Web (marqués \"Accès web\") sont intrinsèquement moins fiables et rencontrent fréquemment des problèmes de stabilité, car les fournisseurs de services mettent régulièrement à jour leurs interfaces Web et leurs mesures de sécurité. Ces connexions basées sur le Web reposent sur la rétro-ingénierie et sont difficiles à maintenir, se brisant souvent de manière inattendue. Pour une expérience fiable, nous recommandons vivement d'utiliser des robots offrant un accès API lorsque c'est possible.\n\n### Autres fonctionalités\n\n- Mode d'invite rapide : envoyez l'invite suivante sans attendre la fin de la demande précédente.\n- Stockage local de l'historique du chat, pour protéger votre vie privée\n- Mettez en évidence les réponses que vous aimez, supprimez les mauvaises\n- Activer/désactiver les bots à tout moment\n- Choix de l'affichage en une, deux ou trois colonnes\n- Mise à jour automatique vers la dernière version\n- Mode sombre (contribué par @tanchekwei)\n- Raccourcis clavier. Appuyez sur <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd> pour les connaître tous (contribué par @tanchekwei)\n- Plusieurs chats (contribué par @tanchekwei)\n- Paramètres de proxy (contribué par @msaong)\n- Gestion des invites (contribué par @tanchekwei)\n- Supporte plusieurs langues (chinois, anglais, allemand, français, russe, vietnamien, coréen, japonais, espagnol, italien)\n- Supporte Windows, macOS et Linux\n\nFonctionnalités prévues :\n\nVous êtes invités à contribuer à ces fonctionnalités.\n\n- [ ] Déployer le front-end sur GitHub Pages\n\n## Confidentialité\n\nTout l'historique des discussions, les paramètres et les données de connexion sont enregistrés localement sur votre ordinateur.\n\nChatALL collecte des données d'utilisation anonymes pour nous aider à améliorer le produit. Cela inclut :\n\n- Quels bots IA sont sollicités et la longueur de l'invite. Le contenu de l'invite n'est pas inclus.\n- La longueur de la réponse, et quelles réponses sont supprimées/mises en évidence. Le contenu de la réponse n'est pas inclus.\n\n## Prérequis\n\nChatALL est un client, pas un proxy. Par conséquent, vous devez :\n\n1. Avoir des comptes et/ou des jetons API fonctionnels pour les bots.\n2. Avoir des connexions réseau fiables avec les bots.\n\n## Télécharger / Installer\n\nTélécharger depuis https://github.com/ai-shifu/ChatALL/releases\n\n### Sur Windows\n\nJust download the \\*-win.exe file and proceed with the setup.\n\n### Sur macOS\n\nPour les Macs de type Apple Silicon (M1, M2 CPU), téléchargez le fichier \\*-mac-arm64.dmg.\n\nPour les autres Macs (Intel), téléchargez le fichier \\*-mac-x64.dmg.\n\nSi vous utilisez [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), vous pouvez également l'installer avec :\n\n```bash\nbrew install --cask chatall\n```\n\n### Sur Linux\n\nDistributions basées sur Debian : Téléchargez le fichier .deb, double-cliquez dessus et installez le logiciel.\nDistributions basées sur Arch : Vous pouvez cloner ChatALL depuis l'AUR [ici](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/chatall-bin). Vous pouvez l'installer manuellement ou en utilisant un assistant AUR comme yay ou paru.\nAutres distributions : Téléchargez le fichier .AppImage, rendez-le exécutable et profitez de l'expérience \"click-to-run\". Vous pouvez également utiliser [AppimageLauncher](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher).\n\n## Dépannage\n\nSi vous rencontrez des problèmes lors de l'utilisation de ChatALL, vous pouvez essayer les méthodes suivantes pour les résoudre :\n\n1. **Rafraîchir** - appuyez sur <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> ou <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>.\n2. **Redémarrer** - quittez ChatALL et relancez-le.\n3. **Reconnectez-vous** - cliquez sur le bouton des paramètres en haut à droite, puis cliquez sur le lien de connexion/déconnexion correspondant pour vous reconnecter au site.\n4. **Créer une nouvelle discussion** - cliquez sur le bouton `New Chat` et envoyez l'invite à nouveau.\n\nSi aucune des méthodes ci-dessus ne fonctionne, vous pouvez essayer de **réinitialiser ChatALL**. Notez que cela supprimera tous vos paramètres et l'historique des messages.\n\nVous pouvez réinitialiser ChatALL en supprimant les répertoires suivants :\n\n- Windows : `C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Roaming\\chatall\\`\n- Linux : `/home/<user>/.config/chatall/`\n- macOS : `/Users/<user>/Library/Application Support/chatall/`\n\nSi le problème persiste, veuillez [soumettre un problème](https://github.com/ai-shifu/ChatALL/issues).\n\n## Pour les développeurs\n\n### Contribuer à un bot\n\n[Le guide](https://github.com/ai-shifu/ChatALL/wiki/%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E6%B7%BB%E5%8A%A0%E4%B8%80%E4%B8%AA%E6%96%B0%E7%9A%84-AI-%E5%AF%B9%E8%AF%9D%E6%9C%BA%E5%99%A8%E4%BA%BA) may help you.\n\n### Lancement\n\n```bash\nnpm install\nnpm run electron:serve\n```\n\n### Build\n\nBuild pour votre plateforme actuelle:\n\n```bash\nnpm run electron:build\n```\n\nBuild pour toutes les plateformes:\n\n```bash\nnpm run electron:build -- -wml --x64 --arm64\n```\n\n## Credits\n\n### Contributeurs\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/ai-shifu/ChatALL/graphs/contributors\">\n  <img src=\"https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=ai-shifu/ChatALL\" />\n</a>\n\n### Autres\n\n- GPT-4 a contribué à une grande partie du code\n- ChatGPT, Copilot et Google fournissent de nombreuses solutions (classées par ordre).\n- Inspiré par [ChatHub] (https://github.com/chathub-dev/chathub).

Tuttavia, il loro comportamento può essere casuale e diversi bot eccellono in diverse attività. Se desideri la migliore esperienza, non provarli uno per uno. ChatALL (nome cinese: 齐叨) può inviare prompt a diversi IA Bot contemporaneamente, aiutandoti a scoprire i migliori risultati. Tutto ciò che devi fare è [scaricare, installare](https://github.com/ai-shifu/ChatALL/releases) e chiedere .\n\n### Sei uno di questi?\n\nGli utenti tipici di ChatALL sono:\n\n- 🤠**Guru dei LLM**, che vogliono trovare le migliori risposte o creazioni dai LLM.\n- 🤓**Ricercatori dei LLM**, che vogliono confrontare intuitivamente i punti di forza e di debolezza di vari LLM in diversi campi.\n- 😎**Sviluppatori di applicazioni dei LLM**, che vogliono debuggare rapidamente i prompt e trovare i modelli di base più performanti.\n\n### Bot supportati\n\n| IA Bots

Vota i tuoi bot preferiti in [questi problemi](https://github.com/ai-shifu/ChatALL/labels/more%20LLMs).\n\n### Nota sull'affidabilità dei bot AI basati sul Web\n\nI bot AI basati sul Web (contrassegnati con \"Web Access\") sono intrinsecamente meno affidabili e spesso incontrano problemi di stabilità, poiché i fornitori di servizi aggiornano regolarmente le loro interfacce web e misure di sicurezza. Queste connessioni basate sul web si basano sul reverse engineering e sono difficili da mantenere, spesso smettendo di funzionare inaspettatamente. Per un'esperienza più affidabile, raccomandiamo vivamente di utilizzare bot che offrono accesso API quando possibile.\n\n### Altre funzionalità\n\n- Modalità prompt rapido: invia il prompt successivo senza attendere il completamento della richiesta precedente.\n- Salva la cronologia delle chat localmente, proteggendo la tua privacy.\n- Evidenzia la risposta che ti piace, elimina quelle indesiderate.\n- Abilita/disabilita i bot in qualsiasi momento.\n- Passa tra la vista a una, due o tre colonne.\n- Aggiornamento automatico all'ultima versione.\n- Modalità scura (contribuita da @tanchekwei).\n- Scorciatoie da tastiera. Premi <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd> per conoscerle tutte (contribuite da @tanchekwei).\n- Chat multiple (contribuite da @tanchekwei).\n- Impostazione proxy (contribuito da @msaong).\n- Gestione dei prompt (contribuito da @tanchekwei).\n- Supporto per diverse lingue (cinese, inglese, tedesco, francese, russo, vietnamita, coreano, giapponese, spagnolo, italiano).\n- Supporto per Windows, macOS e Linux.\n\nFunzionalità pianificate:\n\nSiete benvenuti a contribuire a queste funzionalità.\n\n- [ ] Deploy del front-end su Pagine GitHub\n\n## Privacy\n\nTutta la cronologia delle chat, le impostazioni e i dati di accesso vengono salvati localmente sul tuo computer.\n\nChatALL raccoglie dati anonimi sull'utilizzo per aiutarci a migliorare il prodotto. Inclusi:\n\n- Quali bot AI vengono sollecitati e quanto è lungo il prompt. Non include il contenuto del prompt.\n- Quanto è lunga la risposta e quale risposta viene eliminata/evidenziata. Non include il contenuto della risposta.\n\n## Prerequisiti\n\nChatALL è un client, non un proxy. Pertanto, devi:\n\n1. Avere account funzionanti e/o token API per i bot.\n2. Avere connessioni di rete affidabili ai bot.\n\n## Download / Installazione\n\nScarica da https://github.com/ai-shifu/ChatALL/releases\n\n### Su Windows\n\nBasta scaricare il file \\*-win.exe e procedere con l'installazione.\n\n### Su macOS\n\nPer Mac con processori Apple Silicon (M1, M2), scarica il file \\*-mac-arm64.dmg.\n\nPer gli altri Mac, scarica il file \\*-mac-x64.dmg.\n\nSe stai usando [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), puoi installarlo anche con:\n\n```bash\nbrew install --cask chatall\n```\n\n### Su Linux\n\nDistribuzioni basate su Debian: Scarica il file .deb, fai doppio clic su di esso e installa il software.\nDistribuzioni basate su Arch: Puoi clonare ChatALL da AUR [qui](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/chatall-bin). Puoi installarlo manualmente o utilizzando un helper AUR come yay o paru.\nAltre distribuzioni: Scarica il file .AppImage, rendilo eseguibile e goditi l'esperienza del clic. Puoi anche utilizzare [AppimageLauncher](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher).\n\n## Risoluzione dei problemi\n\nSe incontri problemi durante l'utilizzo di ChatALL, puoi provare i seguenti metodi per risolverli:\n\n1. **Ricarica** - premi <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> o <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>.\n2. **Riavvia** - esci da ChatALL e avvialo nuovamente.\n3. **Rilogin** - clicca sul pulsante delle impostazioni nell'angolo in alto a destra, quindi clicca sul link di accesso/uscita corrispondente per accedere nuovamente al sito web.\n4. **Crea una nuova chat** - clicca sul pulsante `Nuova Chat` e invia nuovamente il prompt.\n\nSe nessuno dei metodi sopra elencati funziona, puoi provare a **reimpostare ChatALL**.

AIは素晴らしいです。しかし、その回答はAIによってバラバラで、AIによって得意とする処理が異なります。最高の体験をしたいのであれば、AIを別々に毎回試すのはやめましょう！ChatALL（中国語名：齐叨）は、同時に複数のAIにメッセージを送信することができ、各AIの回答を見て比較するのに役立ちます。ChatALLを使うのに必要なのは[ダウンロード・インストール](https://github.com/ai-shifu/ChatALL/releases)・質問それだけです。\n\n### あなたの目的は？\n\nChatALLのユーザーはこんな感じ：\n\n- 🤠**LLMのプロたち**, LLMから最高の答えや創造物を見つけたい人たち。\n- 🤓**LLMの研究者**, 様々な分野のLLMの長所と短所を直感的に比較したい人。\n- 😎**LLMアプリケーションの開発者**, プロンプトを素早くデバッグし、最もパフォーマンスの高い基礎モデルを見つけたい人。\n\n###

Access」対応と表示されているもの）は、本質的に信頼性に欠け、安定性の問題が頻繁に発生します。これは、サービス提供者がWebインターフェースやセキュリティ対策を頻繁に更新し、その度にリバースエンジニアリングによる保守が必要となるためです。このような接続方式は維持が困難で、予期せず機能が停止することがあります。より信頼性の高いサービスを利用するため、可能な限りAPI接続を提供するボットの使用を強く推奨します。\n\n### その他特徴\n\n- クイックプロンプトモード：前の回答を待たずに次の質問を送信する機能\n- チャット履歴をローカルに保存し、プライバシーを保護\n- 気に入ったメッセージをピン止めし、悪いメッセージを削除\n- 使いたいAIをいつでも変更することができます。\n- 回答を1列～3列の表示切替\n- 最新バージョンへの自動通知と自動アップデート\n- ダークモード対応（提供者 @tanchekwei）\n- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd> または `Cmd + /` で全てのショートカットキーが表示 (提供者 @tanchekwei)\n- マルチチャット対応 (提供者 @tanchekwei)\n- プロキシ設定をサポート (提供者 @msaong)\n- プロンプト管理 (提供者 @tanchekwei)\n- 対応言語：日本語、英語、中国語、スペイン語、ドイツ語、フランス語、ロシア語、ベトナム語、韓国語、イタリア語\n- Windows、macOS、Linux対応\n\n今後リリース予定の機能:\n\nこれらの機能への貢献は大歓迎です。\n\n- [ ] フロントエンドをGitHub Pagesにデプロイする。\n\n##

Проголосуйте за своих любимых ботов в [этих issues](https://github.com/ai-shifu/ChatALL/labels/more%20LLMs).\n\n### Примечание о надёжности веб-ботов ИИ\n\nВеб-боты ИИ (отмеченные как \"Web Access\") по своей природе менее надёжны и часто сталкиваются с проблемами стабильности. Это связано с тем, что поставщики услуг регулярно обновляют свои веб-интерфейсы и меры безопасности, что требует постоянного обслуживания с помощью реверс-инжиниринга. Такой тип подключения сложно поддерживать, и он может неожиданно перестать работать. Для более надёжной работы мы настоятельно рекомендуем использовать ботов с API-доступом, когда это возможно.\n\n### Другие функции\n\n- Режим быстрого запроса: отправьте следующее приглашение, не дожидаясь завершения предыдущего запроса\n- Сохраняйте историю чата локально, защищайте вашу частную жизнь\n- Выделите понравившийся вам ответ, удалите плохой\n- Включать / отключать любых ботов в любое время\n- Переключение между просмотром в одну, две или три колонки\n- Автоматическое обновление до последней версии\n- Темный режим (автор @tanchekwei)\n- Короткие клавиши.

của bạn trong [những vấn đề này](https://github.com/ai-shifu/ChatALL/labels/more%20LLMs).\n\n### Lưu ý về độ tin cậy của các bot AI dựa trên Web\n\nCác bot AI dựa trên Web (được đánh dấu là \"Web Access\") vốn kém tin cậy hơn và thường xuyên gặp vấn đề về tính ổn định. Điều này là do các nhà cung cấp dịch vụ thường xuyên cập nhật giao diện web và các biện pháp bảo mật của họ, đòi hỏi phải liên tục bảo trì thông qua kỹ thuật dịch ngược. Kiểu kết nối này khó duy trì và có thể ngừng hoạt động đột ngột. Để có trải nghiệm đáng tin cậy hơn, chúng tôi đặc biệt khuyến nghị sử dụng các bot có hỗ trợ API khi có thể.\n\n### Tính năng khác\n\n- Chế độ Quick-prompt: gửi prompt tiếp theo đó mà không cần chờ yêu cầu trước đó hoàn thành\n- Lưu trữ lịch sử trò chuyện trên máy tính cục bộ, bảo vệ quyền riêng tư của bạn\n- Highlight câu trả lời bạn yêu thích và xóa câu trả lời có giá trị thấp\n- Bật / Tắt bất kỳ bots nào vào bất kỳ thời điểm nào\n- Chuyển đổi giữa chế độ xem một, hai hoặc ba cột\n- Tự động cập nhật phiên bản mới nhất\n- Chế độ tối (đóng góp bởi @tanchekwei)\n- Phím tắt. Nhấn <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd> để biết tất cả (đóng góp bởi @tanchekwei)\n- Nhiều cuộc trò chuyện (đóng góp bởi @tanchekwei)\n- Cài đặt proxy (đóng góp bởi @msaong)\n- Quản lý prompt (đóng góp bởi @tanchekwei)\n- Hỗ trợ đa ngôn ngữ (Tiếng Anh, Tiếng Trung, Tiếng Đức, Tiếng Pháp, Tiếng Nga, Tiếng Việt, Tiếng Hàn, Tiếng Nhật, Tiếng Tây Ban Nha, Tiếng Ý)\n- Hỗ trợ Windows, macOS và Linux\n\nTính năng đang phát triển:\n\nChúng tôi rất hoan nghênh sự đóng góp của bạn cho các tính năng này.\n\n- [ ] Triển khai front-end lên GitHub Pages\n\n## Quyền riêng tư\n\nTất cả lịch sử trò chuyện, cài đặt và dữ liệu đăng nhập được lưu cục bộ trên máy tính của bạn.\n\nChatALL thu thập dữ liệu sử dụng ẩn danh để giúp chúng tôi cải thiện sản phẩm. Bao gồm:\n\n- AI bots nào được sử dụng và độ dài của prompt. Không bao gồm nội dung prompt.\n- Độ dài của câu trả lời, và câu trả lời nào bị xóa/được highlight. Không bao gồm nội dung câu trả lời.\n\n## Điều kiện tiên quyết\n\nChatALL là một client, không phải là proxy. Vì vậy, bạn cần:\n\n1. Có tài khoản đang hoạt động hoặc có khóa API tokens cho các bots.\n2. Có kết nối mạng đáng tin cậy tới các bots.\n\n## Tải xuống / Cài đặt\n\nTải xuống từ https://github.com/ai-shifu/ChatALL/releases\n\n### Windows\n\nChỉ cần tải xuống tệp \\*-win.exe và tiến hành cài đặt.\n\n### macOS\n\nĐối với những dòng máy Mac sử dụng chip M1, M2, tải xuống tệp \\*-mac-arm64.dmg.\n\nĐối với những dòng máy Mac còn lại, tải xuống tệp \\*-mac-x64.dmg.\n\nNếu bạn đang sử dụng [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), bạn cũng có thể cài đặt bằng lệnh:\n\n```bash\nbrew install --cask chatall\n```\n\n### Linux\n\nCác bản phân phối dựa trên Debian: Tải xuống tệp .deb, nhấp đúp vào nó và cài đặt phần mềm.\nCác bản phân phối dựa trên Arch: Bạn có thể clone ChatALL từ AUR [tại đây](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/chatall-bin). Bạn có thể cài đặt thủ công hoặc sử dụng trình trợ giúp AUR như yay hoặc paru.\nCác bản phân phối khác: Tải xuống tệp .AppImage, đặt nó thành có thể thực thi và tận hưởng trải nghiệm click-to-run. Bạn cũng có thể sử dụng [AppimageLauncher](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher).\n\n## Xử lý sự cố\n\nNếu bạn gặp bất kỳ vấn đề nào khi sử dụng ChatALL, bạn có thể thử các phương pháp sau để giải quyết:\n\n1. **Làm mới** - nhấn <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> hoặc <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>.\n2. **Khởi động lại** - thoát ChatALL và chạy lại.\n3. **Đăng nhập lại** - nhấp vào nút cài đặt ở góc trên bên phải, sau đó nhấp vào liên kết đăng nhập/đăng xuất tương ứng để đăng nhập lại trang web.\n4. **Tạo cuộc trò chuyện mới** - nhấp vào nút `Cuộc trò chuyện mới` và gửi prompt lại.\n\nNếu không có phương pháp nào ở trên hoạt động, bạn có thể thử **đặt lại ChatALL**.

关于网页版AI机器人的可靠性说明\n\n通过网页接入的AI机器人（标注为\"支持\"网页访问的机器人）本质上缺乏可靠性，且经常面临稳定性问题。这是因为服务提供商频繁更新其网页界面和安全措施，而网页连接需要依赖逆向工程来维护，导致维护难度大且可能随时中断。为了获得稳定可靠的使用体验，我们强烈建议在可能的情况下使用提供API访问的机器人。\n\n### 其他功能\n\n- 快问模式：不需要等待前面的请求完成，就可以发下一条指令\n- 对话历史保存在本地，保护你的隐私\n- 高亮喜欢的答案，删除不需要的答案\n- 随时启用/禁用任何机器人\n- 在一列、两列或三列视图之间切换\n- 自动更新到最新版\n- 夜间模式（由 @tanchekwei 贡献）\n- 快捷键。按 <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd> 可以看到所有快捷键（由 @tanchekwei 贡献）\n- 多对话窗口（由 @tanchekwei 贡献）\n- 支持设置代理（由 @msaong 贡献）\n- 提示词管理（由 @tanchekwei 贡献）\n- 支持多语言（中文、英语、德语、法语、俄语、越南语、韩语、日语、西班牙语、意大利语）\n- 支持 Windows，macOS 和 Linux\n\n计划中：\n\n欢迎参与这些功能的开发。\n\n- [ ] 把前端部署到 GitHub Pages\n\n## 隐私\n\n所有的聊天记录、设置和登录数据都保存在您的计算机本地。\n\nChatALL 收集匿名的使用数据，以帮助我们改进产品。包括：\n\n- 向哪些 AI 机器人发送了提示词，以及提示词的长度。不包括提示词内容\n- AI 回复的长度，以及哪些回复被删除/高亮显示。不包括回复内容\n\n## 预先需要\n\nChatALL 是一个客户端，而不是代理。因此，您必须：\n\n1. 拥有可以访问这些 AI 的帐号，或 API token。\n2. 与 AI 网站有可靠的网络连接。\n\n## 下载 / 安装\n\n从 https://github.com/ai-shifu/ChatALL/releases 下载\n\n### Windows 系统\n\n直接下载 \\*-win.exe 安装文件并运行之。\n\n### macOS 系统\n\n对于苹果硅芯片 Mac（M1，M2 CPU），请下载 \\*-mac-arm64.dmg 文件。\n\n对于其他 Mac，下载 \\*-mac-x64.dmg 文件。\n\n如果你在使用 [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)，可以使用以下命令安装：\n\n```bash\nbrew install --cask chatall\n```\n\n### Linux 系统\n\n基于 Debian 的发行版：下载 .deb 文件，双击即可安装。\n基于 Arch 的发行版：你可以从 AUR [这里](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/chatall-bin)克隆 ChatALL。你可以手动安装或使用 yay、paru 等 AUR 助手安装。\n其他发行版：下载 .AppImage 文件，将其设置为可执行，然后双击就可运行。你也可以使用 [AppimageLauncher](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher)。\n\n## 问题解决\n\n使用中如果遇到问题，可以尝试如下方法解决：\n\n1. **刷新** - 按下 <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> 或 <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>。\n2. **重启** - 退出 ChatALL，再重新运行。\n3. **重新登录** - 点击右上角的设置按钮，在弹出的窗口中点击对应的登入/登出链接，重新登录网站。\n4. **创建新对话** - 创建一个新对话，再发送提示词。\n\n如果以上方法都不行，那么可以尝试**重置 ChatALL**。注意，这将丢失你所有的设置和消息历史。\n\n删除下面的目录可以重置 ChatALL：\n\n- Windows: `C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Roaming\\chatall\\`\n- Linux: `/home/<user>/.config/chatall/`\n- macOS: `/Users/<user>/Library/Application Support/chatall/`\n\n如果问题依旧，请[提交一个 issue](https://github.com/ai-shifu/ChatALL/issues)。\n\n## 给开发者\n\n### 贡献新的 AI
