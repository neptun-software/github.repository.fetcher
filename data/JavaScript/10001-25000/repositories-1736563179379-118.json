You are able to get separated layers from our system. These layers can be directly used in your painting workflow. Different from all previous AI driven colorization tools, our results are not single 'JPG/PNG' images, and in fact, our results are 'PSD' layers.\n\nUser Instruction: [https://style2paints.github.io/](https://style2paints.github.io/)\n\nAnd we also have an official [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lvminzhang) account.\n\n# Help human in their standard coloring workflow!\n\nMost human artists are familiar with this workflow:\n\n    sketching -> color filling/flattening -> gradients/details adding -> shading\n\nAnd the corresponding layers are:\n\n    lineart layers + flat color layers + gradient layers + shading layers\n\nStyle2paints V4 is designed for this standard coloring workflow! In style2paints V4, you can automatically get separated results from each step!\n\n# Examples\n\n![logo](https://github.com/lllyasviel/style2paints/raw/master/temps/show/pip.jpg)\n\nHere we present some results in this ABCD format. Users only need to upload their sketch, select a style, and put a light source. \n\nWhen the result is achieved immediately without any human color correction, we regard this result as **fully automatic result**. When the result needs some color correction, human can easily put some color hints on the canvas to guide the AI coloring process. In this case, we regard these results as **semi-automatic results**. If a result is semi-automatic, but the quantity of human color hint points is smaller than 10, we regard these results as **almost automatic result**. In this section, about half of the presented results are **fully automatic result**, and the others are all **almost automatic result**. Do notice that all the below results can be achieved with less than 15 clicks!\n\n![logo](https://github.com/lllyasviel/style2paints/raw/master/temps/show/5.jpg)\n\n![logo](https://github.com/lllyasviel/style2paints/raw/master/temps/show/1.jpg)\n\n# Real-life
