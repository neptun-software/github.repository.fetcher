          "content": "# The Odin Project Curriculum Contributing Guide\n\nThank you for expressing interest in contributing to The Odin Project (TOP) curriculum! Before continuing through this guide, be sure you've read our [general contributing guide](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md), as it contains information that is important for all of our repos.\n\nThis contributing guide assumes you have followed the instructions in our general contributing guide to fork and clone our curriculum repo.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [How to Contribute](#how-to-contribute)\n- [Curriculum Linting](#curriculum-linting)\n\n## How to Contribute\n\nThere are 2 main ways you can contribute to our curriculum:\n\n1. If you're new to contributing to open-source, only need to edit 1 file, or if you just want to make a really quick pull request (PR), you can click the \"Improve this lesson on GitHub\" link found at the end of each lesson. This will open the lesson file in its \"edit\" mode, allowing you to make any edits and submit a PR all through GitHub.\n1. If you're more experienced with contributing or need to edit more than 1 file, you can follow our instructions on [setting up a local clone](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) from our general contributing guide. You should also read the sections that follow on how to open a PR.\n\nRegardless of the way you choose to open a PR, while working on an existing or a new lesson you **must** follow our [Layout Style Guide](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum/blob/main/LAYOUT_STYLE_GUIDE.md) to ensure the layout and formatting is consistent across our curriculum.\n\nBefore submitting a PR for any lesson, you must also use our [Lesson Preview Tool](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/preview) to ensure the lesson Markdown is correctly formatted and rendering properly.\n\n## Curriculum Linting\n\nTo help enforce the layout specified in our layout style guide, we use [markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint). Whenever a PR is opened or has updates made to it, a workflow will run to check any files changed in the PR against common rules as well as custom rules specific to TOP. To make the workflow easier, we also strongly suggest that users who have a local clone run this linter locally before committing any changes. There are 2 ways you can do so:\n\n1. Install the [Markdownlint VSCode Plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint). This plugin will automatically pick up our main configuration and flag issues with a squiggly underline. Note that the plugin will not currently flag issues with the structure of lessons or projects.\n1. Install the `markdownlint-cli2` dependency. This will require you to have installed Node, which we cover in our Foundations path. Simply run `npm install` within the directory of your curriculum clone and you can run one of our 4 scripts to easily lint or fix files. Note that running these scripts without a supplied file path will result in help documentation being output to the terminal.\n    - Lint lessons: `npm run lint:lesson -- \"./path/to/lesson\"`\n    - Autofix lessons: `npm run fix:lesson -- \"./path/to/lesson\"`\n    - Lint projects: `npm run lint:project -- \"./path/to/project\"`\n    - Autofix projects: `npm run fix:project -- \"./path/to/project\"`\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> You *must* run these npm scripts in the root of the curriculum repo (the same location as this file and `package.json`). If you navigate to a different directory and run a script on files there, it will not pick up the right configuration files and rules.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> In some cases, you may need to run a fix script more than once to catch and fix all fixable errors. This typically occurs when a line has multiple errors affecting the same parts and fix actions collide, so Markdownlint only applies some of the fixes.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>With either of these two methods, keep in mind that not all issues that get flagged will have an autofix available. Some rules require fixes that are more dependent on context and cannot - and should not - be automatically fixed, such as our custom rule `TOP001` for descriptive link text.\n"

          "content": "# Layout style guide\n\nInspired by [Google's styleguide](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/docguide/style.md).\n\nTOP uses Markdown for the layout and formatting of lesson and project files to get properly formatted HTML for the TOP website.\n\n**The goals of this style guide are to help create Markdown that is:**\n\n- Readable for as many users as possible.\n- Editable by any contributor.\n- Consistent across the TOP website.\n\n**A note on language**: TOP follows American English and American style punctuation. When adding content to the curriculum, be sure to follow this practice for consistency across lessons.\n\n**Using formatters**: Many projects have a standard in how their code is formatted which should always be followed when contributing. If you're using a formatter (such as Prettier), you should always be sure you aren't accidentally committing code that goes against that standard. This can be achieved by simply disabling the formatter, saving your files without formatting, or configuring your formatter to adhere to the project's standard.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n1. [Lesson layout](#lesson-layout)\n1. [Project layout](#project-layout)\n1. [Headings](#headings)\n1. [Newlines](#newlines)\n1. [Lists](#lists)\n1. [Code](#code)\n1. [Note boxes](#note-boxes)\n1. [Links](#links)\n1. [Images](#images)\n1. [Keyboard shortcuts](#keyboard-shortcuts)\n1. [Codepen embeds](#codepen-embeds)\n1. [Mermaid diagrams](#mermaid-diagrams)\n1. [Markdown styling](#markdown-styling)\n\n## Layouts\n\nIn general, the following layouts should be used for all lessons and projects. Text that should be replaced with the author's own content will be in all CAPS, with any additional information regarding a section listed at the end of the layout code block.\n\nWhen adding new lessons or projects, make a copy of either the [lesson template](./templates/lesson-template.md) or the [project template](./templates/project-template.md) in the appropriate folder where the new lesson/project should be placed. Then begin editing the template copy.\n\nThe [lesson example](./templates/lesson-example.md) and [project example](./templates/project-example.md) files both show how this style guide can be put to use in an actual lesson/project. They don't cover every situation (the lesson example doesn't show a lesson with an assignment and one without, for example), but they should give you a better representation of how lessons/projects should look after this style guide is applied.\n\n### Lesson layout\n\n```markdown\n### Introduction\n\nA BRIEF INTRODUCTION.\n\n### Lesson overview\n\nThis section contains a general overview of topics that you will learn in this lesson.\n\n- A LESSON OVERVIEW ITEM.\n\n### CUSTOM SECTION HEADING\n\nCUSTOM SECTION CONTENT.\n\n### Assignment\n\n<div class=\"lesson-content__panel\" markdown=\"1\">\n\n#### OPTIONAL CUSTOM ASSIGNMENT HEADING\n\n1. A RESOURCE OR EXERCISE ITEM\n   - AN INSTRUCTION ITEM\n\n</div>\n\n### Knowledge check\n\nThe following questions are an opportunity to reflect on key topics in this lesson. If you can't answer a question, click on it to review the material, but keep in mind you are not expected to memorize or master this knowledge.\n\n- [A KNOWLEDGE CHECK QUESTION](A-KNOWLEDGE-CHECK-URL)\n\n### Additional resources\n\nThis section contains helpful links to related content. It isn't required, so consider it supplemental.\n\n- It looks like this lesson doesn't have any additional resources yet. Help us expand this section by contributing to our curriculum.\n```\n\n1. `### Introduction`: A brief summary on what the lesson is about and/or why the topics or concepts it covers are important. Replace the `A BRIEF INTRODUCTION.` text with your own lesson introduction.\n\n1. `### Lesson overview`: A bulleted list of items that provide a general overview of what the user will learn about in the lesson. Lesson overviews should include general, higher level statements that cover the core concepts of the lesson. They should serve and be phrased as a list of key items that a user should be expected to *learn about* throughout the lesson, rather than a list of things they should be able to *do* by the end of it.\n\n   Replace the `A LESSON OVERVIEW ITEM.` text with your own lesson overview item, then add any additional bulleted lesson overview items. The lesson should ideally have no more than 7 lesson overview items, but this number might vary by lesson. **If the lesson does not have a lesson overview, remove this entire section from the lesson.**\n\n1. `### CUSTOM SECTION HEADING`: A custom section that contains some of the main content of the lesson. Replace the `CUSTOM SECTION HEADING` text with a proper section heading and the `CUSTOM SECTION CONTENT.` text with your own content, then add any additional custom sections. **If the lesson does not have any custom sections, remove this entire section from the lesson.**\n\n1. `### Assignment`: A numbered list of external resources the user must read or watch, or practical exercises the user must complete (such as our exercise repos), in order to fully complete the lesson. If an assignment is intended to have multiple lists, each list should include a level 4 heading by replacing the `#### OPTIONAL CUSTOM ASSIGNMENT HEADING` with a proper level 4 heading, otherwise this custom heading can be omitted.\n\n   Each assignment item should include some brief text that further informs the user on why it is included in the assignment or what purpose it serves. When necessary, an assignment item should also explicitly state any instructions that should be followed. Examples of instructions can include (but aren't limited to) a specific section the user should read, whether the user should complete any specific exercises, and whether the user should redirect themselves to additional links within the resource.\n\n   Replace the `A RESOURCE OR EXERCISE ITEM.` text with your own text and a link to the resource or exercise (or any applicable instructions if an exercise isn't external), then add any additional numbered assignment items. The lesson should ideally have no more than 3-5 assignment items (reading several sections on a web page or completing a folder of 5 exercises would be considered a single assignment item). **If the lesson does not have an assignment, remove this entire section from the lesson.**\n\n   If an assignment item includes any instructions, replace the `AN INSTRUCTION ITEM` text with a single instruction, then add any additional bulleted instruction items.\n\n   If a user should only read specific sections within a resource (e.g. \"Skip Chapter 7\") or complete only specific exercises (e.g. \"Complete the first two exercises in the repo\"), each instruction item should be its own bullet.\n\n   **If an assignment item does not have any instructions, remove the bulleted `AN INSTRUCTION ITEM` text from it.**\n\n1. `### Knowledge check`: A bulleted list of specific questions that should aid users in reflecting on the lesson's key topics. A knowledge check should only link either to a section within the lesson (either with a Heading 3 `###` or Heading 4 `####`, or by wrapping text in a `<span>` element with an `id` attribute), or a resource previously linked to in the lesson. This link should help users review the applicable material without requiring them to re-read the entire lesson.\n\n   Replace the `A KNOWLEDGE CHECK URL` text with the actual link to the section/resource and the `A KNOWLEDGE CHECK QUESTION.` text with your own question/problem that the user should be able to answer/solve. Then add any additional bulleted knowledge check items. The lesson should ideally have no more than 7 knowledge checks, but this number might vary by lesson. **If the lesson does not have a knowledge check, remove this entire section from the lesson.**\n\n   In order to link to a Heading 3 `###` or Heading 4 `####` within the lesson, replace the value within the parenthesis for the knowledge check link with a hashtag `#` followed immediately by the section title in lowercase and any spaces replaced with a hyphen `-`. For example, a Heading 3 section titled `### Creating a method` would be linked to with `(#creating-a-method)`.\n\n   In order to link to a `<span>` element within the lesson, replace the value within the parenthesis with the exact `id` attribute of the `<span>` element (this will be case sensitive). For example, a `<span id=\"Knowledge-Check-3\">` element would be linked to with `(#Knowledge-Check-3)`.\n\n1. `### Additional resources`: A bulleted list of optional resources for the user to read. Additional resources should be related to the content of the lesson in some way, without being necessary to gain an understanding of the lesson content. An additional resource should include brief text that further informs the user on why it is included or what purpose it serves, and generally should stand out in some way from the lesson content and other additional resources. A good rule of thumb is to try and answer, \"what purpose does this resource serve?\"\n\n   **If the lesson doesn't include any additional resources, leave this section as-is**. Otherwise, replace the default bulleted resource item with your own resource, then add any additional bulleted resource items. The lesson should ideally have no more than 3-5 additional resources.\n\n### Project layout\n\n```markdown\n### Introduction\n\nA BRIEF INTRODUCTION.\n\n### OPTIONAL PRE-ASSIGNMENT SECTION HEADING\n\nOPTIONAL PRE-ASSIGNMENT SECTION CONTENT.\n\n### Assignment\n\n<div class=\"lesson-content__panel\" markdown=\"1\">\n\n#### OPTIONAL CUSTOM ASSIGNMENT HEADING\n\n1. A REQUIREMENT/USER STORY.\n\n#### Extra credit\n\n- AN OPTIONAL ADD-ON/USER STORY.\n\n</div>\n\n### OPTIONAL POST-ASSIGNMENT SECTION HEADING\n\nOPTIONAL POST-ASSIGNMENT SECTION CONTENT.\n```\n\n1. `### Introduction`: A brief summary on what the project is and an overview of what the user will be building. Replace the `A BRIEF INTRODUCTION.` text with your own project introduction.\n\n1. `### OPTIONAL PRE-ASSIGNMENT SECTION HEADING`: A section that contains content that should come before the actual project assignment. This section will most likely not be needed for most projects, but when it is needed simply replace the `OPTIONAL PRE-ASSIGNMENT SECTION HEADING` text with a proper section heading and the `OPTIONAL PRE-ASSIGNMENT SECTION CONTENT.` text with your own content. Then add any additional pre-assignment sections. **If the project does not have a pre-assignment section, remove this entire section from the project.**\n\n1. `### Assignment`: A numbered list of items that describe detailed requirements or user stories that must be followed in order to complete the project. Replace the `A REQUIREMENT/USER STORY.` with your own requirement, then add any additional numbered requirement items. If an assignment is intended to have multiple lists, each list should include a level 4 heading by replacing the `#### OPTIONAL CUSTOM ASSIGNMENT HEADING` with a proper level 4 heading, otherwise this custom heading can be omitted.\n\n1. `#### Extra credit`: A bulleted list of items that describe any optional add-ons or user stories that might make a user's project stand out. Replace the `AN OPTIONAL ADD-ON/USER STORY.` text with your own add-on, then add any additional bulleted add-on items. **If the project does not have any extra credit items, remove the extra credit section from the assignment.**\n\n1. `### OPTIONAL POST-ASSIGNMENT SECTION HEADING`: A section that contains content that should come after the actual project assignment. This section will most likely not be needed for most projects, but when it is needed simply replace the `OPTIONAL POST-ASSIGNMENT SECTION HEADING` text with a proper section heading and the `OPTIONAL POST-ASSIGNMENT SECTION CONTENT.` text with your own content. Then add any additional post-assignment sections. **If the project does not have a post-assignment section, remove this entire section from the project.**\n\n## Headings\n\n### Case\n\nHeadings should always use sentence case:\n\n```markdown\n<!-- Incorrect -->\n### This Is Not Sentence case\n\n<!-- Correct -->\n### This is sentence case\n\n<!-- Correct -->\n### This is also sentence case with HTML\n```\n\n### No code snippets\n\nHeadings should never contain any code snippets.\n\n```markdown\n<!-- Incorrect -->\n### The `id` property\n\n<!-- Correct -->\n### The id property\n```\n\n### ATX-style headings\n\nUse Heading 3 `###` for main section titles (\"Lesson overview\", \"Assignment\", custom sections, etc):\n\n```markdown\n### Section heading\n```\n\n### Sub-heading\n\nUse either Heading 4 `####` for sub-headings that are on their own line or Markdown's bold syntax, e.g. `**Sub-heading**`, for inline sub-headings:\n\n```markdown\n...text before.\n\n#### Sub-heading\n\nText after...\n\n**Inline sub-heading:** Some text defining this sub-heading...\n```\n\n## Newlines\n\nEach Markdown file should have an empty newline at the very end, after all of the file's contents.\n\nAlways add a newline before and after a heading, a list, an Assignment panel, or any other content that is not strictly text:\n\n```markdown\nContent before...\n\n### Section heading\n\n1. A list item\n\n...content after.\n```\n\n## Lists\n\nThe Odin Project follows [Google's documentation style guide on lists](https://developers.google.com/style/lists#numbered-lettered-bulleted-lists).\n\n### Capitalization and end punctuation\n\nCapitalization and end punctuation depend on the type of list and the contents of the list.\n\nGenerally, start each list item with a capital letter and end each list item with a period or other appropriate sentence-ending punctuation.\n\n```markdown\n- Use Git to make open-source contributions.\n- Understand how the web works.\n- Explain what OOP principles are.\n```\n\nDo not use end punctuation in the following cases:\n\n- If the item consists of a single word, don't use end punctuation.\n- If the item doesn't include a verb, don't use end punctuation.\n\nFor more detailed examples of the exceptions, refer to [Google's style guide on lists](https://developers.google.com/style/lists#capitalization-and-end-punctuation)\n\n### Lazy numbering\n\nMarkdown is smart enough to let the resulting HTML render your numbered lists correctly. For longer lists that may change, especially long nested lists, use \"lazy\" numbering. The following Markdown:\n\n```markdown\n1. Foo\n1. Bar\n1. Foofoo\n1. Barbar\n1. Baz\n```\n\nWill result in the following output:\n\n1. Foo\n1. Bar\n1. Foofoo\n1. Barbar\n1. Baz\n\n### Nested lists\n\nWhen nesting lists, use a 2 space indent when nesting inside a bulleted list and a 3 space indent when nesting inside a numbered list. The following Markdown:\n\n```markdown\n1. The first item\n1. A second item\n   - A sub-item for the second item with 3 spaces before the hyphen\n\n- A bulleted list item\n  - A sub-bullet with a 2 space indent\n- A new list item\n```\n\nWill result in the following output:\n\n1. The first item\n1. A second item\n   - A sub-item for the second item with 3 spaces before the hyphen\n\n- A bulleted list item\n  - A sub-bullet with a 2 space indent\n- A new list item\n\n### Multi-line list items\n\nWhen list items should wrap onto multiple lines – such as to create a line break between a lengthy list item – insert an empty line before and after each wrapped line and use a 2 to 3 space indent on the wrapped line. You should use a 2 space indent for bulleted lists and a 3 space indent for numbered lists. The following Markdown:\n\n```markdown\n1. This is a lengthy list item.\n\n   This is related information to the first item, but visually separated out.\n\n1. A new list item\n\n- This is a lengthy bulleted list item.\n\n  This is related information to the first item, but visually separated out.\n\n- A new bulleted list item\n```\n\nWill result in the following output:\n\n1. This is a lengthy list item.\n\n   This is related information to the first item, but visually separated out.\n\n1. A new list item\n\n- This is a lengthy bulleted list item.\n\n  This is related information to the first item, but visually separated out.\n\n- A new bulleted list item\n\n### Unordered lists\n\nThe preferred way to create unordered lists for The Odin Project is by using hyphens `-`. Both hyphens and asterisks give the same results, but sticking to one way keeps the source markdown consistent.\n\n```markdown\n- This is a list item made using a hyphen.\n- This is a list item made using a hyphen.\n- This is a list item made using a hyphen.\n```\n\n## Code\n\n### Inline\n\n&#96;Backticks&#96; designate `inline code`, and will render all wrapped content\nliterally. Use them for short code quotations, math formulas/calculations, field names, or file names:\n\n```markdown\nWrite these in the `script` tag of a skeleton HTML file.\n\n...which is why we can call `taco.printString()` but not `taco.capitalizeString()`.\n\nCreate a new file named `styles.css` first.\n```\n\n### Codeblocks\n\nFor code quotations longer than a single line, use a codeblock with 3 opening and closing backticks:\n\n````markdown\n```javascript\nconst obj = {\n  name: \"object\",\n  marker: \"X\"\n}\n```\n````\n\n#### Declare the language\n\nIt is best practice to explicitly declare the language immediately after the opening backticks, so that neither the\nsyntax highlighter nor the next editor must guess.\n\nIf a language has both a long and short form that markdown will accept, for example `javascript` will also be accepted as `js`, and `text` will also be accepted as `txt`, the long form must be used.\n\n#### No extraneous characters\n\nCodeblocks should only contain actual code snippets, terminal commands, or commented out text. Never include leading terminal content, such as the dollar sign `$` you might see preceding any commands you type in.\n\n```bash\n# Incorrect\n$ cd Documents\n\n# Correct\ncd Documents\n```\n\n#### Nest codeblocks within lists\n\nIf you need a codeblock within a list, you should follow the same indenting rules for [multi-line list items](#multi-line-list-items), with the codeblock being indented with 2 spaces for a bulleted list item and 3 spaces for a numbered list item. The following Markdown:\n\n````markdown\n- Bullet.\n\n  ```javascript\n  // We start indenting with 2 space for the codeblock\n  function tester() {\n    const yay = 'From here we can indent like we normally would'\n  }\n  ```\n\n- Next bullet.\n````\n\nWill result in the following output:\n\n- Bullet.\n\n  ```javascript\n  // We start indenting with 2 space for the codeblock\n  function tester() {\n    const yay = 'From here we can indent like we normally would'\n  }\n  ```\n\n- Next bullet.\n\n## Note boxes\n\nNote boxes can be added by wrapping the content in a `div` with the class `lesson-note`. This will add styling to make the note stand out visually to users.\n\nFor nested markdown inside note boxes to be displayed properly additional `markdown=\"1\" attribute` is needed.\n\nA heading can be added to a note by using a `####` heading. When adding a heading, be sure to provide text that helps describe the note rather than \"A note\" or \"Warning\".\n\nThe opening and closing tags must each be wrapped with a single blank line on either side, or a codeblock delimiter (triple backticks). This applies to any line that contains only a single HTML tag. The only exceptions to this rule are HTML tags inside `html`, `jsx`, `erb`, `ejs`, `javascript` or `ruby` codeblocks.\n\n### Variations\n\nDifferent types of note boxes can be set by adding an extra class together with `lesson-note`:\n\n- `lesson-note--tip` for tips or general information\n- `lesson-note--warning` for warnings about potential issues/pitfalls, and are more severe than a tip\n- `lesson-note--critical` for the most important warnings, such as critical information about handling sensitive data\n\n#### Example\n\n```markdown\n<div class=\"lesson-note\" markdown=\"1\">\n\n#### An optional title\n\nA sample note box.\n\n</div>\n```\n\n```markdown\n<div class=\"lesson-note lesson-note--tip\" markdown=\"1\">\n\n#### An optional title\n\nA sample note box, variation: tip.\n\n</div>\n```\n\n## Links\n\nLong links make source Markdown difficult to read and break the 80 character wrapping. **Wherever possible, shorten your links**.\n\n### Use Markdown links\n\nInstead of using HTML anchor tags for links, use Markdown links instead.\n\n```markdown\n<!-- Don't use HTML links -->\nSee the <a href=\"./templates/lesson-template.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">lesson template</a> for a more easily copyable lesson file.\n\n<!-- Use Markdown links -->\nSee the [lesson template](./templates/lesson-template.md) for a more easily copyable lesson file.\n```\n\n### Use informative titles\n\nMarkdown link syntax allows you to set a link title, just as HTML does. Use it wisely.\n\nTitling your links as \"link\" or \"here\" tells the reader precisely nothing when quickly scanning your doc and is a waste of space. Instead, write the sentence naturally, then go back and wrap the most appropriate phrase with the link:\n\n```markdown\nSee the [lesson template](./templates/lesson-template.md) for a more easily copyable lesson file.\nOr, check out the [project template](./templates/project-template.md) for a more easily copyable project file.\n```\n\nTypically you want to ensure the link text describes the purpose of the link or where the link will redirect a user, and can often be the title of a blog article or video. You should also do your best to avoid including \"this\" and \"here\" in the link text to avoid our linter from flagging it as an error, even if the link text is descriptive. Often times \"this\" or \"here\" aren't necessary as part of the link text, and may cause some confusion despite a descriptive text (\"Where's here??\").\n\n```markdown\n<!-- Sufficient, but could be tweaked further -->\nCheck out [this video on flex-grow from CoolYoutuber](...url)\nGo look at our [installations guide here](...url)\n\n<!-- After a slight change -->\nCheck out this [video on flex-grow from CoolYoutuber](...url)\nGo look at our [installations guide](...url)\n```\n\nAdditionally, if there are multiple links in a lesson that redirect to the same `href`, the link text for each link must be the same. For example:\n\n```markdown\n<!-- Not great :( -->\nGo to [Google](www.google.com)\nTry [searching on Google](www.google.com)\nFirst go to the [Google homepage](www.google.com)\n\n<!-- Better! :) -->\nGo to [Google](www.google.com)\nTry searching on [Google](www.google.com)\nFirst go to the [Google](www.google.com) homepage\n```\n\n### Don't scatter links throughout lessons\n\nLinks to required reading should not be scattered throughout a lesson, and should instead be placed in either the `### Assignment` or `### Additional resources` section. Links that refer a user to a previous lesson as a refresher, or a link to a Wikipedia page that offers a definition/explanation of a term are fine to place outside of these two sections.\n\n## Images\n\nImages in Markdown follow the same syntax as links, except they begin with an exclamation point `!`:\n\n```markdown\n![flex shorthand](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/495704c6eb6bf33bc927534f231533a82b27b2ac/html_css/v2/foundations/flexbox/imgs/10.png)\n```\n\nThe text in square brackets will be included as the image's alt text. Similar to link titles, the alt text should be informative, but shouldn't be overly verbose.\n\nIn order to properly add images to a lesson, follow the instructions in our [Adding Images to the Curriculum](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/curriculum/wiki/Adding-Images-to-the-Curriculum) Wiki page to get a statically URL as seen in the codeblock above.\n\n## Keyboard shortcuts\n\nFor keyboard shortcuts we use the HTML keyboard input element `<kbd>`.\n\nExample code which will be rendered as: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>?</kbd>\n\n```html\n<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>?</kbd>\n```\n\n### Style standardization\n\n- Use separate `<kbd>` elements for individual keys:\n\n  ```markdown\n  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd>\n  ```\n\n- Use capitalized common abbreviations for the keys and avoid using symbols like `⌘`:\n\n  ```markdown\n  <kbd>Cmd</kbd>\n  <kbd>Alt</kbd>\n  <kbd>B</kbd>\n  <kbd>Opt</kbd>\n  ```\n\n- Use symbols for character keys instead of spelling out the symbol like `period`:\n\n  ```markdown\n  <kbd>.</kbd>\n  <kbd>,</kbd>\n  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>?</kbd>\n  ```\n\n## Codepen embeds\n\nIn order to embed a Codepen example into a lesson, you must be in the editor view for the Codepen you wish to embed and then click the `Embed` button at the bottom right of the page.\n\nThe following options should be selected when creating a Codepen embed:\n\n- **Default Tabs**: The \"Result\" tab must be selected in addition to one of the other three options (HTML, CSS, or JavaScript), depending on the main purpose of the Codepen. If the purpose is to show an HTML concept then the \"HTML\" option must also be selected, for example.\n- **Theme**: \"Dark\"\n- **Use Click-to-Load**: \"Off\"\n- **Make Code Editable**: \"On\"\n\nFinally, the **HTML (Recommended)** code option must be the one that is copy + pasted into the lesson.\n\n### Maintainer instructions\n\nWhen a user adds a Codepen embed to a lesson, a maintainer should fork the embed to the official [TOP Codepen](https://codepen.io/TheOdinProjectExamples/) account. When necessary, the name of new pens should be updated to better reflect their purpose, e.g. `Simple SVG Example` for a pen showing a simple SVG or `max-width | CSS Responsiveness` for a pen about the `max-width` property.\n\nAfter forking a pen to the TOP account and ensuring the embeds options from above are selected, the lesson the original embed is from should be updated to include the forked, TOP version instead.\n\n## Mermaid diagrams\n\nTo add a Mermaid diagram to a lesson, visit the [Mermaid docs](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/flowchart.html) to learn the diagram syntax for the specific type of diagram you want to add. After you've figured out the content you want in the diagram, you can add it to a lesson's markdown by surrounding the content with `<pre>` tags with a `class=\"mermaid\"` ie:\n\n```markdown\n<pre class=\"mermaid\">\n\nmermaid diagram content here\n\n</pre>\n```\n\nThis has full support in the [Lesson Preview tool](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/preview), so be sure to check that the diagram renders correctly with the lesson content before contributing.\n\n## Markdown styling\n\nWhile Markdown supports the use of both asterisks `*` and underscores `_` to make text bold or italic, asterisks should always be used.\n\n```markdown\n**This** is how *we* do things.\n\n__This__ is _not_ how we do things.\n```\n"
