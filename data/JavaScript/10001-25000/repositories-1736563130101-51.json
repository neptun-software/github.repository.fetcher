Miscellaneous\n----------------\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\nmatter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\nnecessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides\nthat the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter\nshall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n\n10.

Zen is a privacy-focused browser that blocks trackers, ads, and other unwanted content while offering the best browsing experience!\n\n<div flex=\"true\">\n  <a href=\"https://zen-browser.app/download\">\n    Download\n  </a>\n  •\n  <a href=\"https://zen-browser.app\">\n    Website\n  </a>\n  •\n  <a href=\"https://docs.zen-browser.app\">\n    Documentation\n  </a>\n  •\n  <a href=\"https://zen-browser.app/release-notes/latest\">\n    Release Notes\n  </a>\n</div>\n\n## 🖥️ Compatibility\n\nZen is currently built using firefox version `134.0`! 🚀\n\n- Check out the latest [release notes](https://zen-browser.app/release-notes)!\n- Part of our mission is to keep Zen up-to-date with the latest version of Firefox, so you can enjoy the latest features and security updates!\n\n## 🤝 Contribution\n\nZen is an open-source project, and we welcome contributions from the community! Please take a look at the [contribution guidelines](./docs/contribute.md) before getting started!\n\n### Issue metrics\n\nWe keep track of how many issues are closed at the end of the month in [docs/issue-metrics](./docs/issue-metrics). This is to keep track of how many issues are being closed, because who doesn't like to see progress? 📈\n\n### Versioning\n\nZen uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for versioning. Meaning, versions are displayed as `a.b-c.d` where:\n\n- `a` is the major version\n- `b` is the minor version\n- `c` is the branch prefix\n- `d` is the patch version\n\n### Branches\n\nZen is divided into 2 main branches. We use `dev` for development and `stable` for stable releases. The `dev` branch is where all the new features are added and where `twilight` builds are generated. The `stable` branch is where the stable releases are generated.\n\nWe divide into 2 branches in case there's any really important security update (for example) that needs to be released before the next stable release. This allows us to do patches without releasing unstable versions to the public.\n\n## ⚡ Performance\n\nZen is built with performance in mind, and we have optimized the browser to be as fast as possible! Checkout the latest [performance benchmarks](https://docs.zen-browser.app/benchmarks)!\n\n## 📥 Installation\n\n### Supported Operating Systems\n\nZen is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows. You can download the latest version from the official website at [zen-browser.app](https://zen-browser.app/download), or from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/zen-browser/desktop/releases) page.\n\nIf you dont see your OS listed below, that's because we already have it in our [downloads page](https://zen-browser.app/download)! Make sure to check it out!\n\n#### Windows\n\n##### Winget\n\n```ps\nwinget install --id Zen-Team.Zen-Browser\n```\n\n#### macOS\n\n- Requires macOS 10.15 or later\n- Available for ARM and Intel architectures\n\nYou can also install Zen using Homebrew:\n\n```\nbrew install --cask zen-browser\n```\n\n#### Linux\n\n##### Arch-based distributions\n\n```sh\nyay -S zen-browser-bin\n```\n\n##### Other Linux distributions (AppImage with automated system integration)\n\n- `native` tarball install:\n  `bash <(curl -s https://updates.zen-browser.app/install.sh)`\n\n- `zsync` is required for the Update feature of the script below\n\n```sh\nbash <(curl https://updates.zen-browser.app/appimage.sh)\n```\n\n- Again, if you don't see your OS listed above, that's because we already have it in our [downloads page](https://zen-browser.app/download)! 🔄\n\nTo upgrade the browser to a newer version, use the embedded update functionality in `About Zen`.\n\n## 👨‍💻 Development and Contributing\n\nSome components used by @zen-browser as an attempt to make firefox forks a better place, and for other to enjoy the beauty of OSS. You can find them [here](https://github.com/zen-browser/desktop/tree/dev/src/browser/base/zen-components).\n\n#### `Run Locally`\n\nIn order to download and run zen locally, please follow [these instructions](https://docs.zen-browser.app/contribute/desktop).\n\n#### `Special Thanks`\n\nSpecial thanks to...
