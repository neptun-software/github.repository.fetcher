Check the [Change Log](/CHANGELOG.md)!**\n\nThis is a straight-to-the-point guide to assembling a JavaScript stack. It requires some general programming knowledge, and JavaScript basics. **It focuses on wiring tools together** and giving you the **simplest possible example** for each tool. You can see this tutorial as *a way to write your own boilerplate from scratch*. Since the goal of this tutorial is to assemble various tools, I do not go into details about how these tools work individually. Refer to their documentation or find other tutorials if you want to acquire deeper knowledge in them.\n\nYou don't need to use this entire stack if you build a simple web page with a few JS interactions of course (a combination of Browserify/Webpack + Babel + jQuery is enough to be able to write ES6 code in different files), but if you want to build a web app that scales, and need help setting things up, this tutorial will work great for you.\n\nA big chunk of the stack described in this tutorial uses React. If you are beginning and just want to learn React, [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) will get you up and running with a React environment very quickly with a pre-made configuration. I would for instance recommend this approach to someone who arrives in a team that's using React and needs to catch up with a learning playground. In this tutorial you won't use a pre-made configuration, because I want you to understand everything that's happening under the hood.\n\nCode examples are available for each chapter, and you can run them all with `yarn && yarn start`. I recommend writing everything from scratch yourself by following the **step-by-step instructions** though.\n\nFinal code available in the [JS-Stack-Boilerplate repository](https://github.com/verekia/js-stack-boilerplate), and in the [releases](https://github.com/verekia/js-stack-from-scratch/releases). There is a [live demo](https://js-stack.herokuapp.com/) too.\n\nWorks on Linux, macOS, and Windows.\n\n> **Note**: Since the tutorial was last edited in May 2017, a few libraries have slightly changed their APIs. 95% of the tutorial is still perfectly valid, but if you run into something weird, make sure to check out the [open issues](https://github.com/verekia/js-stack-from-scratch/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug).\n\n## Table of contents\n\n[01 - Node, Yarn, `package.json`](/tutorial/01-node-yarn-package-json.md#readme)\n\n[02 - Babel, ES6, ESLint, Flow, Jest, Husky](/tutorial/02-babel-es6-eslint-flow-jest-husky.md#readme)\n\n[03 - Express, Nodemon, PM2](/tutorial/03-express-nodemon-pm2.md#readme)\n\n[04 - Webpack, React, HMR](/tutorial/04-webpack-react-hmr.md#readme)\n\n[05 - Redux, Immutable, Fetch](/tutorial/05-redux-immutable-fetch.md#readme)\n\n[06 - React Router, Server-Side Rendering, Helmet](/tutorial/06-react-router-ssr-helmet.md#readme)\n\n[07 - Socket.IO](/tutorial/07-socket-io.md#readme)\n\n[08 - Bootstrap, JSS](/tutorial/08-bootstrap-jss.md#readme)\n\n[09 - Travis, Coveralls, Heroku](/tutorial/09-travis-coveralls-heroku.md#readme)\n\n## Coming up next\n\nSetting up your editor (Atom first), MongoDB, Progressive Web App, E2E testing.\n\n## Translations\n\nIf you want to add your translation, please read the [translation recommendations](/how-to-translate.md) to get started!\n\n### V2\n\n- [Bulgarian](https://github.com/mihailgaberov/js-stack-from-scratch) by [mihailgaberov](http://github.com/mihailgaberov)\n- [Chinese (simplified)](https://github.com/yepbug/js-stack-from-scratch/) by [@yepbug](https://github.com/yepbug)\n- [French](https://github.com/naomihauret/js-stack-from-scratch/) by [Naomi Hauret](https://twitter.com/naomihauret)\n- [Italian](https://github.com/fbertone/guida-javascript-moderno) by [Fabrizio Bertone](https://github.com/fbertone) - [fbertone.it](http://fbertone.it)\n- [Polish](https://github.com/mbiesiad/js-stack-from-scratch) by [@mbiesiad](https://github.com/mbiesiad)\n\nCheck out the [ongoing translations](https://github.com/verekia/js-stack-from-scratch/issues/147).\n\n### V1\n\n- [Chinese (simplified)](https://github.com/pd4d10/js-stack-from-scratch) by [@pd4d10](http://github.com/pd4d10)\n- [Italian](https://github.com/fbertone/js-stack-from-scratch) by [Fabrizio Bertone](https://github.com/fbertone)\n- [Japanese](https://github.com/takahashim/js-stack-from-scratch) by [@takahashim](https://github.com/takahashim)\n- [Russian](https://github.com/UsulPro/js-stack-from-scratch) by [React Theming](https://github.com/sm-react/react-theming)\n- [Thai](https://github.com/MicroBenz/js-stack-from-scratch) by [MicroBenz](https://github.com/MicroBenz)\n\n## Credits\n\nCreated by [@verekia](https://twitter.com/verekia) â€“ [verekia.com](http://verekia.com/).\n\nLicense: MIT\n"

          "content": "# How to translate this tutorial\n\nThank you for your interest in translating my tutorial! Here are a few recommendations to get started.\n\nThis tutorial is in constant evolution to provide the best learning experience to readers. Both the code and `README.md` files will change over time. It is great if you do a one-shot translation that won't evolve, but it would be even better if you could try to keep up with the original English version as it changes!\n\nHere is what I think is a good workflow:\n\n- Check if there is already an [ongoing translation](https://github.com/verekia/js-stack-from-scratch/issues/147) for your language. If that's the case, get in touch with the folks who opened it and consider collaborating. All maintainers will be mentioned on the English repo, so team work is encouraged! You can open issues on their translation fork project to offer your help on certain chapters for instance.\n\n- Join the [Translations Gitter room](https://gitter.im/js-stack-from-scratch/Translations) if you're feeling chatty.\n\n- Fork the main [English repository](https://github.com/verekia/js-stack-from-scratch).\n\n- Post in [this issue](https://github.com/verekia/js-stack-from-scratch/issues/147) the language and URL of your forked repo.\n\n- Translate the `README.md` files.\n\n- Add a note somewhere explaining on the main `README.md` that this is a translation, with a link to the English repository. If you don't plan to make the translation evolve over time, you can maybe add a little note saying to refer to the English one for an up-to-date version of the tutorial. I'll leave that up to your preference.\n\n- Submit a Pull Request to the English repo to add a link to your forked repository under the Translations section of the main `README.md`. It could look like this:\n\n```md\n## Translations\n\n- [Language](http://github.com/yourprofile/your-fork) by [You](http://yourwebsite.com)\nor\n- [Language](http://github.com/yourprofile/your-fork) by [@You](http://twitter.com/yourprofile)\nor\n- [Language](http://github.com/yourprofile/your-fork) by [@You](http://github.com/yourprofile)\n```\n\nSince I want to reward you for your good work as much as possible, you can put any link you like on your name (to your personal website, Twitter profile, or Github profile for instance).\n\n- After your original one-shot translation, if you want to update your repo with the latest change from the main English repo, [sync your fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) with my repo. To make it easy to see what changed since your initial translation, you can use Github's feature to [compare commits](https://help.github.com/articles/comparing-commits-across-time/#comparing-commits). Set the **base** to the last commit from the English repo you used to translate, and compare it to **master**, like so:\n\n<!-- markdownlint-disable MD034 -->\nhttps://github.com/verekia/js-stack-from-scratch/compare/c65dfa65d02c21063d94f0955de90947ba5273ad...master\n<!-- markdownlint-enable MD034 -->\n\nThat should give you a easy-to-read diff to see exactly what changed in `README.md` files since your translation!\n"
