Feel free to fork and open a pull request.\n\nPlease follow the house rules to have a bigger chance of your contribution being merged.\n\n## House rules\n\n### How to make changes\n - To make changes, create a new branch based on `master` (do not create one from `gh-pages` unless strictly necessary) and make them there, then create a Pull Request to master.  \n `gh-pages` is different from master in that it contains sharing features, analytics and other things that have no direct bearing with the game. `master` is the \"pure\" version of the game.\n - If you want to modify the CSS, please edit the SCSS files present in `style/`: `main.scss` and others. Don't edit the `main.css`, because it's supposed to be generated.  \n In order to compile your SCSS modifications, you need to use the `sass` gem (install it by running `gem install sass` once Ruby is installed).  \n To run SASS, simply use the following command:  \n `sass --unix-newlines --watch style/main.scss`  \n SASS will automatically recompile your css when changed.\n - `Rakefile`Â contains some tasks that help during development. Feel free to add useful tasks if needed.\n - Please use 2-space indentation when editing the JavaScript. A `.jshintrc` file is present, which will help your code to follow the guidelines if you install and run `jshint`.\n - Please test your modification thoroughly before submitting your Pull Request.\n\n### Changes that might not be accepted\nWe have to be conservative with the core game. This means that some modifications won't be merged, or will have to be evaluated carefully before being merged:\n\n - Undo/redo features\n - Save/reload features\n - Changes to how the tiles look or their contents\n - Changes to the layout\n - Changes to the grid size\n\n### Changes that are welcome\n - Bug fixes\n - Compatibility improvements\n - \"Under the hood\" enhancements\n - Small changes that don't have an impact on the core gameplay\n"

[Play it here!](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/)\n\nThe official app can also be found on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gabrielecirulli.app2048) and [App Store!](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/2048-by-gabriele-cirulli/id868076805)\n\n### Contributions\n\n[Anna Harren](https://github.com/iirelu/) and [sigod](https://github.com/sigod) are maintainers for this repository.\n\nOther notable contributors:\n\n - [TimPetricola](https://github.com/TimPetricola) added best score storage\n - [chrisprice](https://github.com/chrisprice) added custom code for swipe handling on mobile\n - [marcingajda](https://github.com/marcingajda) made swipes work on Windows Phone\n - [mgarciaisaia](https://github.com/mgarciaisaia) added support for Android 2.3\n\nMany thanks to [rayhaanj](https://github.com/rayhaanj), [Mechazawa](https://github.com/Mechazawa), [grant](https://github.com/grant), [remram44](https://github.com/remram44) and [ghoullier](https://github.com/ghoullier) for the many other good contributions.\n\n### Screenshot\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1175750/8614312/280e5dc2-26f1-11e5-9f1f-5891c3ca8b26.png\" alt=\"Screenshot\"/>\n</p>\n\nThat screenshot is fake, by the way. I never reached 2048 :smile:\n\n## Contributing\nChanges and improvements are more than welcome! Feel free to fork and open a pull request. Please make your changes in a specific branch and request to pull into `master`! If you can, please make sure the game fully works before sending the PR, as that will help speed up the process.\n\nYou can find the same information in the [contributing guide.](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n## License\n2048 is licensed under the [MIT license.](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)\n\n## Donations\nI made this in my spare time, and it's hosted on GitHub (which means I don't have any hosting costs), but if you enjoyed the game and feel like buying me coffee, you can donate at my BTC address: `1Ec6onfsQmoP9kkL3zkpB6c5sA4PVcXU2i`. Thank you very much!\n"
