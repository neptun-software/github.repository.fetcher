          "content": "# Yjs Internals\n\nThis document roughly explains how Yjs works internally. There is a complete\nwalkthrough of the Yjs codebase available as a recording:\nhttps://youtu.be/0l5XgnQ6rB4\n\nThe Yjs CRDT algorithm is described in the [YATA\npaper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/310212186_Near_Real-Time_Peer-to-Peer_Shared_Editing_on_Extensible_Data_Types)\nfrom 2016. For an algorithmic view of how it works, the paper is a reasonable\nplace to start. There are a handful of small improvements implemented in Yjs\nwhich aren't described in the paper. The most notable is that items have an\n`originRight` as well as an `origin` property, which improves performance when\nmany concurrent inserts happen after the same character.\n\nAt its heart, Yjs is a list CRDT. Everything is squeezed into a list in order to\nreuse the CRDT resolution algorithm:\n\n- Arrays are easy - they're lists of arbitrary items.\n- Text is a list of characters, optionally punctuated by formatting markers and\n  embeds for rich text support. Several characters can be wrapped in a single\nlinked list `Item` (this is also known as the compound representation of\nCRDTs). More information about this in [this blog\narticle](https://blog.kevinjahns.de/are-crdts-suitable-for-shared-editing/).\n- Maps are lists of entries. The last inserted entry for each key is used, and\n  all other duplicates for each key are flagged as deleted.\n\nEach client is assigned a unique *clientID* property on first insert. This is a\nrandom 53-bit integer (53 bits because that fits in the javascript safe integer\nrange \\[JavaScript uses IEEE 754 floats\\]).\n\n## List items\n\nEach item in a Yjs list is made up of two objects:\n\n- An `Item` (*src/structs/Item.js*). This is used to relate the item to other\n  adjacent items.\n- An object in the `AbstractType` hierarchy (subclasses of\n  *src/types/AbstractType.js* - eg `YText`). This stores the actual content in\nthe Yjs document.\n\nThe item and type object pair have a 1-1 mapping. The item's `content` field\nreferences the AbstractType object and the AbstractType object's `_item` field\nreferences the item.\n\nEverything inserted in a Yjs document is given a unique ID, formed from a\n*ID(clientID, clock)* pair (also known as a [Lamport\nTimestamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_timestamp)). The clock counts\nup from 0 with the first inserted character or item a client makes. This is\nsimilar to automerge's operation IDs, but note that the clock is only\nincremented by inserts. Deletes are handled in a very different way (see\nbelow).\n\nIf a run of characters is inserted into a document (eg `\"abc\"`), the clock will\nbe incremented for each character (eg 3 times here). But Yjs will only add a\nsingle `Item` into the list. This has no effect on the core CRDT algorithm, but\nthe optimization dramatically decreases the number of javascript objects\ncreated during normal text editing. This optimization only applies if the\ncharacters share the same clientID, they're inserted in order, and all\ncharacters have either been deleted or all characters are not deleted. The item\nwill be split if the run is interrupted for any reason (eg a character in the\nmiddle of the run is deleted).\n\nWhen an item is created, it stores a reference to the IDs of the preceding and\nsucceeding item. These are stored in the item's `origin` and `originRight`\nfields, respectively. These are used when peers concurrently insert at the same\nlocation in a document. Though quite rare in practice, Yjs needs to make sure\nthe list items always resolve to the same order on all peers. The actual logic\nis relatively simple - its only a couple dozen lines of code and it lives in\nthe `Item#integrate()` method. The YATA paper has much more detail on this\nalgorithm.\n\n### Item Storage\n\nThe items themselves are stored in two data structures and a cache:\n\n- The items are stored in a tree of doubly-linked lists in *document order*.\n  Each item has `left` and `right` properties linking to its siblings in the\ndocument. Items also have a `parent` property to reference their parent in the\ndocument tree (null at the root). (And you can access an item's children, if\nany, through `item.content`).\n- All items are referenced in *insertion order* inside the struct store\n  (*src/utils/StructStore.js*). This references the list of items inserted by\nfor each client, in chronological order. This is used to find an item in the\ntree with a given ID (using a binary search). It is also used to efficiently\ngather the operations a peer is missing during sync (more on this below).\n\nWhen a local insert happens, Yjs needs to map the insert position in the\ndocument (eg position 1000) to an ID. With just the linked list, this would\nrequire a slow O(n) linear scan of the list. But when editing a document, most\ninserts are either at the same position as the last insert, or nearby. To\nimprove performance, Yjs stores a cache of the 80 most recently looked up\ninsert positions in the document. This is consulted and updated when a position\nis looked up to improve performance in the average case. The cache is updated\nusing a heuristic that is still changing (currently, it is updated when a new\nposition significantly diverges from existing markers in the cache). Internally\nthis is referred to as the skip list / fast search marker.\n\n### Deletions\n\nDeletions in Yjs are treated very differently from insertions. Insertions are\nimplemented as a sequential operation based CRDT, but deletions are treated as\na simpler state based CRDT.\n\nWhen an item has been deleted by any peer, at any point in history, it is\nflagged as deleted on the item. (Internally Yjs uses the `info` bitfield.) Yjs\ndoes not record metadata about a deletion:\n\n- No data is kept on *when* an item was deleted, or which user deleted it.\n- The struct store does not contain deletion records\n- The clientID's clock is not incremented\n\nIf garbage collection is enabled in Yjs, when an object is deleted its content\nis discarded. If a deleted object contains children (eg a field is deleted in\nan object), the content is replaced with a `GC` object (*src/structs/GC.js*).\nThis is a very lightweight structure - it only stores the length of the removed\ncontent.\n\nYjs has some special logic to share which content in a document has been\ndeleted:\n\n- When a delete happens, as well as marking the item, the deleted IDs are\n  listed locally within the transaction. (See below for more information about\ntransactions.) When a transaction has been committed locally, the set of\ndeleted items is appended to a transaction's update message.\n- A snapshot (a marked point in time in the Yjs history) is specified using\n  both the set of (clientID, clock) pairs *and* the set of all deleted item\nIDs. The deleted set is O(n), but because deletions usually happen in runs,\nthis data set is usually tiny in practice. (The real world editing trace from\nthe B4 benchmark document contains 182k inserts and 77k deleted characters. The\ndeleted set size in a snapshot is only 4.5Kb).\n\n## Transactions\n\nAll updates in Yjs happen within a *transaction*. (Defined in\n*src/utils/Transaction.js*.)\n\nThe transaction collects a set of updates to the Yjs document to be applied on\nremote peers atomically. Once a transaction has been committed locally, it\ngenerates a compressed *update message* which is broadcast to synchronized\nremote peers to notify them of the local change. The update message contains:\n\n- The set of newly inserted items\n- The set of items deleted within the transaction.\n\n## Network protocol\n\nThe network protocol is not really a part of Yjs. There are a few relevant\nconcepts that can be used to create a custom network protocol:\n\n* `update`: The Yjs document can be encoded to an *update* object that can be\n  parsed to reconstruct the document. Also every change on the document fires\nan incremental document update that allows clients to sync with each other.\nThe update object is a Uint8Array that efficiently encodes `Item` objects and\nthe delete set.\n* `state vector`: A state vector defines the known state of each user (a set of\n  tuples `(client, clock)`). This object is also efficiently encoded as a\nUint8Array.\n\nThe client can ask a remote client for missing document updates by sending\ntheir state vector (often referred to as *sync step 1*). The remote peer can\ncompute the missing `Item` objects using the `clocks` of the respective clients\nand compute a minimal update message that reflects all missing updates (sync\nstep 2).\n\nAn implementation of the syncing process is in\n[y-protocols](https://github.com/yjs/y-protocols).\n\n## Snapshots\n\nA snapshot can be used to restore an old document state. It is a `state vector`\n\\+ `delete set`. A client can restore an old document state by iterating through\nthe sequence CRDT and ignoring all Items that have an `id.clock >\nstateVector[id.client].clock`. Instead of using `item.deleted` the client will\nuse the delete set to find out if an item was deleted or not.\n\nIt is not recommended to restore an old document state using snapshots,\nalthough that would certainly be possible. Instead, the old state should be\ncomputed by iterating through the newest state and using the additional\ninformation from the state vector.\n"

The only limitation is\nthat a shared type must exist only once in the shared document.\n\n```js\nconst ymap = doc.getMap('map')\nconst foodArray = new Y.Array()\nfoodArray.insert(0, ['apple', 'banana'])\nymap.set('food', foodArray)\nymap.get('food') === foodArray // => true\nymap.set('fruit', foodArray) // => Error! foodArray is already defined\n```\n\nNow you understand how types are defined on a shared document. Next you can jump\nto the [demo repository](https://github.com/yjs/yjs-demos) or continue reading\nthe API docs.\n\n### Example: Using and combining providers\n\nAny of the Yjs providers can be combined with each other. So you can sync data\nover different network technologies.\n\nIn most cases you want to use a network provider (like y-websocket or y-webrtc)\nin combination with a persistence provider (y-indexeddb in the browser).\nPersistence allows you to load the document faster and to persist data that is\ncreated while offline.\n\nFor the sake of this demo we combine two different network providers with a\npersistence provider.\n\n```js\nimport * as Y from 'yjs'\nimport { WebrtcProvider } from 'y-webrtc'\nimport { WebsocketProvider } from 'y-websocket'\nimport { IndexeddbPersistence } from 'y-indexeddb'\n\nconst ydoc = new Y.Doc()\n\n// this allows you to instantly get the (cached) documents data\nconst indexeddbProvider = new IndexeddbPersistence('count-demo', ydoc)\nindexeddbProvider.whenSynced.then(() => {\n  console.log('loaded data from indexed db')\n})\n\n// Sync clients with the y-webrtc provider.\nconst webrtcProvider = new WebrtcProvider('count-demo', ydoc)\n\n// Sync clients with the y-websocket provider\nconst websocketProvider = new WebsocketProvider(\n  'wss://demos.yjs.dev', 'count-demo', ydoc\n)\n\n// array of numbers which produce a sum\nconst yarray = ydoc.getArray('count')\n\n// observe changes of the sum\nyarray.observe(event => {\n  // print updates when the data changes\n  console.log('new sum: ' + yarray.toArray().reduce((a,b) => a + b))\n})\n\n// add 1 to the sum\nyarray.push([1]) // => \"new sum: 1\"\n```\n\n## API\n\n```js\nimport * as Y from 'yjs'\n```\n\n### Shared Types\n\n<details>\n  <summary><b>Y.Array</b></summary>\n  <br>\n  <p>\nA shareable Array-like type that supports efficient insert/delete of elements\nat any position.

Document updates must be transmitted to all other\npeers. You can apply document updates in any order and multiple times.

Document\nupdates are *commutative* and *idempotent*. This means that they can be applied\nin any order and multiple times.\n\n#### Example: Listen to update events and apply them on remote client\n\n```js\nconst doc1 = new Y.Doc()\nconst doc2 = new Y.Doc()\n\ndoc1.on('update', update => {\n  Y.applyUpdate(doc2, update)\n})\n\ndoc2.on('update', update => {\n  Y.applyUpdate(doc1, update)\n})\n\n// All changes are also applied to the other document\ndoc1.getArray('myarray').insert(0, ['Hello doc2, you got this?'])\ndoc2.getArray('myarray').get(0) // => 'Hello doc2, you got this?'\n```\n\nYjs internally maintains a [state vector](#state-vector) that denotes the next\nexpected clock from each client. In a different interpretation it holds the\nnumber of structs created by each client. When two clients sync, you can either\nexchange the complete document structure or only the differences by sending the\nstate vector to compute the differences.\n\n#### Example: Sync two clients by exchanging the complete document structure\n\n```js\nconst state1 = Y.encodeStateAsUpdate(ydoc1)\nconst state2 = Y.encodeStateAsUpdate(ydoc2)\nY.applyUpdate(ydoc1, state2)\nY.applyUpdate(ydoc2, state1)\n```\n\n#### Example: Sync two clients by computing the differences\n\nThis example shows how to sync two clients with the minimal amount of exchanged\ndata by computing only the differences using the state vector of the remote\nclient. Syncing clients using the state vector requires another roundtrip, but\ncan save a lot of bandwidth.\n\n```js\nconst stateVector1 = Y.encodeStateVector(ydoc1)\nconst stateVector2 = Y.encodeStateVector(ydoc2)\nconst diff1 = Y.encodeStateAsUpdate(ydoc1, stateVector2)\nconst diff2 = Y.encodeStateAsUpdate(ydoc2, stateVector1)\nY.applyUpdate(ydoc1, diff2)\nY.applyUpdate(ydoc2, diff1)\n```\n\n#### Example: Syncing clients without loading the Y.Doc\n\nIt is possible to sync clients and compute delta updates without loading the Yjs\ndocument to memory. Yjs exposes an API to compute the differences directly on the\nbinary document updates.\n\n```js\n// encode the current state as a binary buffer\nlet currentState1 = Y.encodeStateAsUpdate(ydoc1)\nlet currentState2 = Y.encodeStateAsUpdate(ydoc2)\n// now we can continue syncing clients using state vectors without using the Y.Doc\nydoc1.destroy()\nydoc2.destroy()\n\nconst stateVector1 = Y.encodeStateVectorFromUpdate(currentState1)\nconst stateVector2 = Y.encodeStateVectorFromUpdate(currentState2)\nconst diff1 = Y.diffUpdate(currentState1, stateVector2)\nconst diff2 = Y.diffUpdate(currentState2, stateVector1)\n\n// sync clients\ncurrentState1 = Y.mergeUpdates([currentState1, diff2])\ncurrentState2 = Y.mergeUpdates([currentState2, diff1])\n```\n\n#### Obfuscating Updates\n\nIf one of your users runs into a weird bug (e.g. the rich-text editor throws\nerror messages), then you don't have to request the full document from your\nuser. Instead, they can obfuscate the document (i.e. replace the content with\nmeaningless generated content) before sending it to you. Note that someone might\nstill deduce the type of content by looking at the general structure of the\ndocument. But this is much better than requesting the original document.\n\nObfuscated updates contain all the CRDT-related data that is required for\nmerging. So it is safe to merge obfuscated updates.\n\n```javascript\nconst ydoc = new Y.Doc()\n// perform some changes..\nydoc.getText().insert(0, 'hello world')\nconst update = Y.encodeStateAsUpdate(ydoc)\n// the below update contains scrambled data\nconst obfuscatedUpdate = Y.obfuscateUpdate(update)\nconst ydoc2 = new Y.Doc()\nY.applyUpdate(ydoc2, obfuscatedUpdate)\nydoc2.getText().toString() // => \"00000000000\"\n```\n\n#### Using V2 update format\n\nYjs implements two update formats. By default you are using the V1 update format.\nYou can opt-in into the V2 update format which provides much better compression.\nIt is not yet used by all providers. However, you can already use it if\nyou are building your own provider. All below functions are available with the\nsuffix \"V2\". E.g. `Y.applyUpdate` ⇒ `Y.applyUpdateV2`. Also when listening to updates\nyou need to specifically need listen for V2 events e.g. `yDoc.on('updateV2', …)`.\nWe also support conversion functions between both formats:\n`Y.convertUpdateFormatV1ToV2` & `Y.convertUpdateFormatV2ToV1`.\n\n#### Update API\n\n<dl>\n  <b><code>Y.applyUpdate(Y.Doc, update:Uint8Array, [transactionOrigin:any])</code></b>\n  <dd>\nApply a document update on the shared document. Optionally you can specify\n<code>transactionOrigin</code> that will be stored on\n<code>transaction.origin</code>\nand <code>ydoc.on('update', (update, origin) => ..)</code>.\n  </dd>\n  <b><code>Y.encodeStateAsUpdate(Y.Doc, [encodedTargetStateVector:Uint8Array]):Uint8Array</code></b>\n  <dd>\nEncode the document state as a single update message that can be applied on the\nremote document. Optionally specify the target state vector to only write the\ndifferences to the update message.\n  </dd>\n  <b><code>Y.encodeStateVector(Y.Doc):Uint8Array</code></b>\n  <dd>Computes the state vector and encodes it into an Uint8Array.</dd>\n  <b><code>Y.mergeUpdates(Array&lt;Uint8Array&gt;)</code></b>\n  <dd>\nMerge several document updates into a single document update while removing\nduplicate information. The merged document update is always smaller than\nthe separate updates because of the compressed encoding.\n  </dd>\n  <b><code>Y.encodeStateVectorFromUpdate(Uint8Array): Uint8Array</code></b>\n  <dd>\nComputes the state vector from a document update and encodes it into an Uint8Array.\n  </dd>\n  <b><code>Y.diffUpdate(update: Uint8Array, stateVector: Uint8Array): Uint8Array</code></b>\n  <dd>\nEncode the missing differences to another update message. This function works\nsimilarly to <code>Y.encodeStateAsUpdate(ydoc, stateVector)</code> but works\non updates instead.\n  </dd>\n  <b><code>convertUpdateFormatV1ToV2</code></b>\n  <dd>\nConvert V1 update format to the V2 update format.\n  </dd>\n  <b><code>convertUpdateFormatV2ToV1</code></b>\n  <dd>\nConvert V2 update format to the V1 update format.\n  </dd>\n</dl>\n\n### Relative Positions\n\nWhen working with collaborative documents, we often need to work with positions.\nPositions may represent cursor locations, selection ranges, or even assign a\ncomment to a range of text. Normal index-positions (expressed as integers) are\nnot convenient to use because the index-range is invalidated as soon as a remote\nchange manipulates the document. Relative positions give you a powerful API to\nexpress positions.\n\nA relative position is fixated to an element in the shared document and is not\naffected by remote changes. I.e. given the document `\"a|c\"`, the relative\nposition is attached to `c`. When a remote user modifies the document by\ninserting a character before the cursor, the cursor will stay attached to the\ncharacter `c`. `insert(1, 'x')(\"a|c\") = \"ax|c\"`. When the relative position is\nset to the end of the document, it will stay attached to the end of the\ndocument.\n\n#### Example: Transform to RelativePosition and back\n\n```js\nconst relPos = Y.createRelativePositionFromTypeIndex(ytext, 2)\nconst pos = Y.createAbsolutePositionFromRelativePosition(relPos, doc)\npos.type === ytext // => true\npos.index === 2 // => true\n```\n\n#### Example: Send relative position to remote client (json)\n\n```js\nconst relPos = Y.createRelativePositionFromTypeIndex(ytext, 2)\nconst encodedRelPos = JSON.stringify(relPos)\n// send encodedRelPos to remote client..\nconst parsedRelPos = JSON.parse(encodedRelPos)\nconst pos = Y.createAbsolutePositionFromRelativePosition(parsedRelPos, remoteDoc)\npos.type === remoteytext // => true\npos.index === 2 // => true\n```\n\n#### Example: Send relative position to remote client (Uint8Array)\n\n```js\nconst relPos = Y.createRelativePositionFromTypeIndex(ytext, 2)\nconst encodedRelPos = Y.encodeRelativePosition(relPos)\n// send encodedRelPos to remote client..\nconst parsedRelPos = Y.decodeRelativePosition(encodedRelPos)\nconst pos = Y.createAbsolutePositionFromRelativePosition(parsedRelPos, remoteDoc)\npos.type === remoteytext // => true\npos.index === 2 // => true\n```\n\n<dl>\n  <b><code>\nY.createRelativePositionFromTypeIndex(type:Uint8Array|Y.Type, index: number\n[, assoc=0])\n  </code></b>\n  <dd>\nCreate a relative position fixated to the i-th element in any sequence-like\nshared type (if <code>assoc >= 0</code>). By default, the position associates\nwith the character that comes after the specified index position. If\n<code>assoc < 0</code>, then the relative position associates with the character\nbefore the specified index position.\n  </dd>\n  <b><code>\nY.createAbsolutePositionFromRelativePosition(RelativePosition, Y.Doc):\n{ type: Y.AbstractType, index: number, assoc: number } | null\n  </code></b>\n  <dd>\nCreate an absolute position from a relative position. If the relative position\ncannot be referenced, or the type is deleted, then the result is null.\n  </dd>\n  <b><code>\nY.encodeRelativePosition(RelativePosition):Uint8Array\n  </code></b>\n  <dd>\nEncode a relative position to an Uint8Array. Binary data is the preferred\nencoding format for document updates. If you prefer JSON encoding, you can\nsimply JSON.stringify / JSON.parse the relative position instead.\n  </dd>\n  <b><code>Y.decodeRelativePosition(Uint8Array):RelativePosition</code></b>\n  <dd>Decode a binary-encoded relative position to a RelativePosition object.</dd>\n</dl>\n\n### Y.UndoManager\n\nYjs ships with an Undo/Redo manager for selective undo/redo of changes on a\nYjs type. The changes can be optionally scoped to transaction origins.\n\n```js\nconst ytext = doc.getText('text')\nconst undoManager = new Y.UndoManager(ytext)\n\nytext.insert(0, 'abc')\nundoManager.undo()\nytext.toString() // => ''\nundoManager.redo()\nytext.toString() // => 'abc'\n```\n\n<dl>\n  <b><code>constructor(scope:Y.AbstractType|Array&lt;Y.AbstractType&gt;\n  [, {captureTimeout:number,trackedOrigins:Set&lt;any&gt;,deleteFilter:function(item):boolean}])</code></b>\n  <dd>Accepts either single type as scope or an array of types.</dd>\n  <b><code>undo()</code></b>\n  <dd></dd>\n  <b><code>redo()</code></b>\n  <dd></dd>\n  <b><code>stopCapturing()</code></b>\n  <dd></dd>\n  <b>\n    <code>\non('stack-item-added', { stackItem: { meta: Map&lt;any,any&gt; }, type: 'undo'\n| 'redo' })\n    </code>\n  </b>\n  <dd>\nRegister an event that is called when a <code>StackItem</code> is added to the\nundo- or the redo-stack.\n  </dd>\n  <b>\n    <code>\non('stack-item-updated', { stackItem: { meta: Map&lt;any,any&gt; }, type: 'undo'\n| 'redo' })\n    </code>\n  </b>\n  <dd>\nRegister an event that is called when an existing <code>StackItem</code> is updated.\nThis happens when two changes happen within a \"captureInterval\".\n  </dd>\n  <b>\n    <code>\non('stack-item-popped', { stackItem: { meta: Map&lt;any,any&gt; }, type: 'undo'\n| 'redo' })\n    </code>\n  </b>\n  <dd>\nRegister an event that is called when a <code>StackItem</code> is popped from\nthe undo- or the redo-stack.\n  </dd>\n  <b>\n    <code>\non('stack-cleared', { undoStackCleared: boolean, redoStackCleared: boolean })\n    </code>\n  </b>\n  <dd>\nRegister an event that is called when the undo- and/or the redo-stack is cleared.\n  </dd>\n</dl>\n\n#### Example: Stop Capturing\n\nUndoManager merges Undo-StackItems if they are created within time-gap\nsmaller than `options.captureTimeout`. Call `um.stopCapturing()` so that the next\nStackItem won't be merged.\n\n```js\n// without stopCapturing\nytext.insert(0, 'a')\nytext.insert(1, 'b')\nundoManager.undo()\nytext.toString() // => '' (note that 'ab' was removed)\n// with stopCapturing\nytext.insert(0, 'a')\nundoManager.stopCapturing()\nytext.insert(0, 'b')\nundoManager.undo()\nytext.toString() // => 'a' (note that only 'b' was removed)\n```\n\n#### Example: Specify tracked origins\n\nEvery change on the shared document has an origin. If no origin was specified,\nit defaults to `null`. By specifying `trackedOrigins` you can\nselectively specify which changes should be tracked by `UndoManager`. The\nUndoManager instance is always added to `trackedOrigins`.\n\n```js\nclass CustomBinding {}\n\nconst ytext = doc.getText('text')\nconst undoManager = new Y.UndoManager(ytext, {\n  trackedOrigins: new Set([42, CustomBinding])\n})\n\nytext.insert(0, 'abc')\nundoManager.undo()\nytext.toString() // => 'abc' (does not track because origin `null` and not part\n                 //           of `trackedTransactionOrigins`)\nytext.delete(0, 3) // revert change\n\ndoc.transact(() => {\n  ytext.insert(0, 'abc')\n}, 42)\nundoManager.undo()\nytext.toString() // => '' (tracked because origin is an instance of `trackedTransactionorigins`)\n\ndoc.transact(() => {\n  ytext.insert(0, 'abc')\n}, 41)\nundoManager.undo()\nytext.toString() // => 'abc' (not tracked because 41 is not an instance of\n                 //        `trackedTransactionorigins`)\nytext.delete(0, 3) // revert change\n\ndoc.transact(() => {\n  ytext.insert(0, 'abc')\n}, new CustomBinding())\nundoManager.undo()\nytext.toString() // => '' (tracked because origin is a `CustomBinding` and\n                 //        `CustomBinding` is in `trackedTransactionorigins`)\n```\n\n#### Example: Add additional information to the StackItems\n\nWhen undoing or redoing a previous action, it is often expected to restore\nadditional meta information like the cursor location or the view on the\ndocument. You can assign meta-information to Undo-/Redo-StackItems.\n\n```js\nconst ytext = doc.getText('text')\nconst undoManager = new Y.UndoManager(ytext, {\n  trackedOrigins: new Set([42, CustomBinding])\n})\n\nundoManager.on('stack-item-added', event => {\n  // save the current cursor location on the stack-item\n  event.stackItem.meta.set('cursor-location', getRelativeCursorLocation())\n})\n\nundoManager.on('stack-item-popped', event => {\n  // restore the current cursor location on the stack-item\n  restoreCursorLocation(event.stackItem.meta.get('cursor-location'))\n})\n```\n\n## Yjs CRDT Algorithm\n\n*Conflict-free replicated data types* (CRDT) for collaborative editing are an\nalternative approach to *operational transformation* (OT). A very simple\ndifferentiation between the two approaches is that OT attempts to transform\nindex positions to ensure convergence (all clients end up with the same\ncontent), while CRDTs use mathematical models that usually do not involve index\ntransformations, like linked lists. OT is currently the de-facto standard for\nshared editing on text. OT approaches that support shared editing without a\ncentral source of truth (a central server) require too much bookkeeping to be\nviable in practice. CRDTs are better suited for distributed systems, provide\nadditional guarantees that the document can be synced with remote clients, and\ndo not require a central source of truth.\n\nYjs implements a modified version of the algorithm described in [this\npaper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/310212186_Near_Real-Time_Peer-to-Peer_Shared_Editing_on_Extensible_Data_Types).\nThis [article](https://blog.kevinjahns.de/are-crdts-suitable-for-shared-editing/)\nexplains a simple optimization on the CRDT model and\ngives more insight about the performance characteristics in Yjs.\nMore information about the specific implementation is available in\n[INTERNALS.md](./INTERNALS.md) and in\n[this walkthrough of the Yjs codebase](https://youtu.be/0l5XgnQ6rB4).\n\nCRDTs that are suitable for shared text editing suffer from the fact that they\nonly grow in size. There are CRDTs that do not grow in size, but they do not\nhave the characteristics that are beneficial for shared text editing (like\nintention preservation). Yjs implements many improvements to the original\nalgorithm that diminish the trade-off that the document only grows in size. We\ncan't garbage collect deleted structs (tombstones) while ensuring a unique\norder of the structs. But we can 1. merge preceding structs into a single\nstruct to reduce the amount of meta information, 2. we can delete content from\nthe struct if it is deleted, and 3. we can garbage collect tombstones if we\ndon't care about the order of the structs anymore (e.g. if the parent was\ndeleted).\n\n**Examples:**\n\n1. If a user inserts elements in sequence, the struct will be merged into a\n   single struct. E.g. `text.insert(0, 'a'), text.insert(1, 'b');` is\n   first represented as two structs (`[{id: {client, clock: 0}, content: 'a'},\n   {id: {client, clock: 1}, content: 'b'}`) and then merged into a single\n   struct: `[{id: {client, clock: 0}, content: 'ab'}]`.\n2. When a struct that contains content (e.g. `ItemString`) is deleted, the\n   struct will be replaced with an `ItemDeleted` that does not contain content\n   anymore.\n3. When a type is deleted, all child elements are transformed to `GC` structs. A\n   `GC` struct only denotes the existence of a struct and that it is deleted.\n   `GC` structs can always be merged with other `GC` structs if the id's are\n   adjacent.\n\nEspecially when working on structured content (e.g. shared editing on\nProseMirror), these improvements yield very good results when\n[benchmarking](https://github.com/dmonad/crdt-benchmarks) random document edits.\nIn practice they show even better results, because users usually edit text in\nsequence, resulting in structs that can easily be merged. The benchmarks show\nthat even in the worst case scenario that a user edits text from right to left,\nYjs achieves good performance even for huge documents.\n\n### State Vector\n\nYjs has the ability to exchange only the differences when syncing two clients.\nWe use lamport timestamps to identify structs and to track in which order a\nclient created them. Each struct has an `struct.id = { client: number, clock:\nnumber}` that uniquely identifies a struct. We define the next expected `clock`\nby each client as the *state vector*. This data structure is similar to the\n[version vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_vector) data structure.\nBut we use state vectors only to describe the state of the local document, so we\ncan compute the missing struct of the remote client. We do not use it to track\ncausality.\n\n## License and Author\n\nYjs and all related projects are [**MIT licensed**](./LICENSE).\n\nYjs is based on my research as a student at the [RWTH\ni5](http://dbis.rwth-aachen.de/).
