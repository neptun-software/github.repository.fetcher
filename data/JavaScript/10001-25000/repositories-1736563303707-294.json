These models support common tasks in different modalities, such as:\n  - 📝 **Natural Language Processing**: text classification, named entity recognition, question answering, language modeling, summarization, translation, multiple choice, and text generation.\n  - 🖼️ **Computer Vision**: image classification, object detection, segmentation, and depth estimation.\n  - 🗣️ **Audio**: automatic speech recognition, audio classification, and text-to-speech.\n  - 🐙 **Multimodal**: embeddings, zero-shot audio classification, zero-shot image classification, and zero-shot object detection.\n\nTransformers.js uses [ONNX Runtime](https://onnxruntime.ai/) to run models in the browser. The best part about it, is that you can easily [convert](#convert-your-models-to-onnx) your pretrained PyTorch, TensorFlow, or JAX models to ONNX using [🤗 Optimum](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum#onnx--onnx-runtime). \n\nFor more information, check out the full [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js).\n\n\n## Installation\n\n\nTo install via [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@huggingface/transformers), run:\n```bash\nnpm i @huggingface/transformers\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use it in vanilla JS, without any bundler, by using a CDN or static hosting. For example, using [ES Modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules), you can import the library with:\n```html\n<script type=\"module\">\n    import { pipeline } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@huggingface/transformers@3.2.4';\n</script>\n```\n\n\n## Quick tour\n\n\nIt's super simple to translate from existing code! Just like the python library, we support the `pipeline` API. Pipelines group together a pretrained model with preprocessing of inputs and postprocessing of outputs, making it the easiest way to run models with the library.\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th width=\"440px\" align=\"center\"><b>Python (original)</b></th>\n<th width=\"440px\" align=\"center\"><b>Javascript (ours)</b></th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import pipeline\n\n# Allocate a pipeline for sentiment-analysis\npipe = pipeline('sentiment-analysis')\n\nout = pipe('I love transformers!')\n# [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.999806941}]\n```\n\n</td>\n<td>\n\n```javascript\nimport { pipeline } from '@huggingface/transformers';\n\n// Allocate a pipeline for sentiment-analysis\nconst pipe = await pipeline('sentiment-analysis');\n\nconst out = await pipe('I love transformers!');\n// [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.999817686}]\n```\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\nYou can also use a different model by specifying the model id or path as the second argument to the `pipeline` function. For example:\n```javascript\n// Use a different model for sentiment-analysis\nconst pipe = await pipeline('sentiment-analysis', 'Xenova/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment');\n```\n\nBy default, when running in the browser, the model will be run on your CPU (via WASM). If you would like\nto run the model on your GPU (via WebGPU), you can do this by setting `device: 'webgpu'`, for example:\n```javascript\n// Run the model on WebGPU\nconst pipe = await pipeline('sentiment-analysis', 'Xenova/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english', {\n  device: 'webgpu',\n});\n```\n\nFor more information, check out the [WebGPU guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/guides/webgpu).\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> The WebGPU API is still experimental in many browsers, so if you run into any issues,\n> please file a [bug report](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.js/issues/new?title=%5BWebGPU%5D%20Error%20running%20MODEL_ID_GOES_HERE&assignees=&labels=bug,webgpu&projects=&template=1_bug-report.yml).\n\nIn resource-constrained environments, such as web browsers, it is advisable to use a quantized version of\nthe model to lower bandwidth and optimize performance. This can be achieved by adjusting the `dtype` option,\nwhich allows you to select the appropriate data type for your model. While the available options may vary\ndepending on the specific model, typical choices include `\"fp32\"` (default for WebGPU), `\"fp16\"`, `\"q8\"`\n(default for WASM), and `\"q4\"`. For more information, check out the [quantization guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/guides/dtypes).\n```javascript\n// Run the model at 4-bit quantization\nconst pipe = await pipeline('sentiment-analysis', 'Xenova/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english', {\n  dtype: 'q4',\n});\n```\n\n\n## Examples\n\nWant to jump straight in?

You can customize this as follows:\n\n### Settings\n\n```javascript\nimport { env } from '@huggingface/transformers';\n\n// Specify a custom location for models (defaults to '/models/').\nenv.localModelPath = '/path/to/models/';\n\n// Disable the loading of remote models from the Hugging Face Hub:\nenv.allowRemoteModels = false;\n\n// Set location of .wasm files. Defaults to use a CDN.\nenv.backends.onnx.wasm.wasmPaths = '/path/to/files/';\n```\n\nFor a full list of available settings, check out the [API Reference](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/api/env).\n\n### Convert your models to ONNX\n\nWe recommend using our [conversion script](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.js/blob/main/scripts/convert.py) to convert your PyTorch, TensorFlow, or JAX models to ONNX in a single command. Behind the scenes, it uses [🤗 Optimum](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum) to perform conversion and quantization of your model.\n\n```bash\npython -m scripts.convert --quantize --model_id <model_name_or_path>\n```\n\nFor example, convert and quantize [bert-base-uncased](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased) using:\n```bash\npython -m scripts.convert --quantize --model_id bert-base-uncased\n```\n\nThis will save the following files to `./models/`:\n\n```\nbert-base-uncased/\n├── config.json\n├── tokenizer.json\n├── tokenizer_config.json\n└── onnx/\n    ├── model.onnx\n    └── model_quantized.onnx\n```\n\nFor the full list of supported architectures, see the [Optimum documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/main/en/exporters/onnx/overview).\n\n\n## Supported tasks/models\n\nHere is the list of all tasks and architectures currently supported by Transformers.js.\nIf you don't see your task/model listed here or it is not yet supported, feel free\nto open up a feature request [here](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.js/issues/new/choose).\n\nTo find compatible models on the Hub, select the \"transformers.js\" library tag in the filter menu (or visit [this link](https://huggingface.co/models?library=transformers.js)).\nYou can refine your search by selecting the task you're interested in (e.g., [text-classification](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text-classification&library=transformers.js)).\n\n\n### Tasks\n\n#### Natural Language Processing\n\n| Task                     | ID | Description | Supported?
