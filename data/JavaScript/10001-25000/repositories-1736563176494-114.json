You can make a huge impact without writing a single line of code\n\n### Help triage issues\nOne of the easiest ways to help is to [look through our issues tab](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues)\n* Does the issue still happen? Sometimes we fix the problem and don't always close the issue\n* Are there clear steps to reproduce the issue? If not, let's find and document some\n* Is the issue a duplicate? If so, share the issue that is being duplicated in the conversation\n* See our [Triage Guidelines page](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/Triage-Guidelines) for more info about this process\n* Making sure issues that are fixed have the appropriate milestone set. There may be pull requests fixing the bug on the different product channels and sometimes the issues are forgotten about (and aren't updated)\n\n### Updating documentation\nDocumentation is extremely important. There are lots of areas we can improve:\n* Having more clear or up-to-date instructions in the README for both [`brave-browser`](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/blob/master/README.md) and [`brave-core`](https://github.com/brave/brave-core/blob/master/README.md).\n* Capturing/updating helpful information [in our wiki](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki). You'll need to reach out to a Brave team member to request permission - you can do this by creating a new issue or tagging a Brave team member in an existing issue.\n* Helping to propose a way to bring documentation to other languages. Right now, everything is in English\n* Improving this document :smile:\n\n### Help with translations\nAll text being added to Brave is done initially in English (en-US) and then is translated by real people into other languages.\nWe're missing translations for many languages and some translations might be incomplete or poor quality.\n\nFor everything you'd need to get started, check out https://explore.transifex.com/brave/brave_en/ :smile:\n\n### Work on the code\n* The [repo's wiki](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki) has instructions for cloning the repo and getting setup on your platform of choice\n* Check out the [troubleshooting page](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/Troubleshooting) if you get stuck\n* Once you're up and running, find an interesting issue to fix. Check out issues labelled with [good first issue](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/labels/good%20first%20issue)\n  - some issues only require knowledge of JavaScript (for example, pages using React and our [Brave UI library](https://github.com/brave/brave-ui))\n  - other issues may require C++ changes in either the Brave code or in Chromium\n\n## Getting started\n* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join).\n* Submit a [ticket](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues) for your issue if one does not already exist. Please include the Brave version, operating system, and steps to reproduce the issue.\n* Fork the repository on GitHub (this might be [`brave-browser`](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser), [`brave-core`](https://github.com/brave/brave-core), or both).\n* For changes to JavaScript files, we recommend installing a [Standard](http://standardjs.com/) plugin for your preferred text editor in order to ensure code style consistency.\n* For C++ changes, you can consider setting up [clang-format](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/sublime_ide.md#Format-Selection-with-Clang_Format-Chromium-only) for your editor.\n* For changes which involve patches, please check out our [Patching Chromium](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/Patching-Chromium) guide.\n\n### Making changes\nOnce you've cloned the repo to your computer, you're ready to start making edits!\n\nPlease note that there are two repositories here:\n* the root project (this repo, [`brave-browser`](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser)), which pulls down all of the Chromium code into `src/`\n* [`brave-core`](https://github.com/brave/brave-core) is basically a sub-module (repo in a repo) which is located on disk under the root at `src/brave`\n\nDepending on which you're editing, you'll need to add your fork to the remotes list. By default, `origin` is set to upstream.\nFor example, here's how GitHub user `bsclifton` would add BOTH remotes `brave-browser` and `brave-core`:\n```sh\n# root where project is cloned\ncd ~/brave-browser/\ngit remote add bsclifton git@github.com:bsclifton/brave-browser.git\ngit fetch bsclifton\n# root for the `brave-core` repo\ncd src/brave\ngit remote add bsclifton git@github.com:bsclifton/brave-core.git\ngit fetch bsclifton\n```\n\nOnce you're set up, there are a few tips we can suggest:\n\n* Make a new branch for your work. It helps to have a descriptive name, like `fix-fullscreen-issue`.\n* Make commits in logical units. If needed, run `git rebase -i` to squash commits before opening a pull request.\n* New features and most other pull requests require a new [test](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/Tests) to be written before the pull request will be accepted.  Some exceptions would be a tweak to an area of code that doesn't have tests yet, text changes, build config changes, things that can't be tested due to test suite limitations, etc.\n* Use GitHub [auto-closing keywords](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/) in the commit message, and make the commit message body as descriptive as necessary. Ex:\n\n````\n    Add contributing guide\n\n    This is a first pass at a contributor's guide so now people will know how to\n    get pull requests accepted faster.\n\n    Fix https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/108\n````\n\n* Run the tests by running `npm run test brave_unit_tests` and `npm run test brave_browser_tests`\n* JavaScript unit tests can be run from the `src/brave` directory using `npm run test-unit`\n\n\n### Keeping your fork up to sync\n- Both `brave-browser` and `brave-core` clone themselves with the remote `origin` being upstream, so you can update either using `git pull`.\n- Once `origin` is fetched, you can rebase your `master` branch against `origin/master`\n    ```sh\n    git fetch origin\n    git fetch bsclifton\n    git checkout -b fork_master bsclifton/master\n    git rebase origin/master\n    git push bsclifton fork_master:master\n    ```\n\nAn easier strategy might be to keep `origin` in sync and then create branches based on that (and push those to your fork).\n\n\n### Pull requests\nAfter the changes are made in your branch, you're ready to submit a patch. Patches on GitHub are submitted in the format of a pull request.\n\n#### Considerations before submitting a pull request\nSome helpful things to consider before submitting your work\n* Did you manually test your new change?\n* Does your pull request fix multiple issues? If so, you may consider breaking into separate pull requests.\n* Did you include tests? (we currently have unit tests, browser tests, and JavaScript unit tests)\n* If you made a design or layout change, was there a mock-up provided? Do your changes match it?\n* If your change affects session or preferences, did you include steps to test? You may also consider manually testing an upgrade.\n\n#### Each pull request should include\n* a descriptive title; this gets used in the release notes ([desktop](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/blob/master/CHANGELOG_DESKTOP.md) or [android](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/blob/master/CHANGELOG_ANDROID.md))\n* a short summary of the changes\n* a reference to the issue that it fixes\n* steps to test the fix (if applicable)\n* for design-related changes, it is helpful to include screenshots\n\nOnce you submit a pull request, you should tag reviewers and add labels if needed. If you do not have the necessary GitHub permissions to do so, a Brave member will take care of this for you.\n\n#### Employees should\n* Ensure the owner is tagged using the `Assignees` field\n* Ensure at least one other employee or contributor is tagged using the `Reviewers` field\n* Go through the checklist that's provided in the pull request template and check the appropriate boxes\n\n### Closing issues\n\n* Issues should be assigned the milestone when the PR is merged (and the fix is landed in Nightly aka master).\n* Some issues may need to be uplifted to other channels (Dev / Beta / Release). Please see our notes on [uplifting a pull request](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/Uplifting-a-pull-request).\n* If an issue is closed without a fix, because it was a duplicate, or perhaps it was invalid, then any milestone markers should be removed.\n* If a bug is not fully fixed after its issue is closed, open a new issue instead of re-opening the existing one (unless the code has been reverted).\n\n### Triage help\n\n* Invalid bugs should be closed, tagged with invalid, or a comment should be added indicating that they should if you do not have permission.\n* Asking for more detail in an issue when it is needed is helpful.\n* Adding applicable labels to an issue is helpful.\n* Adding and finding duplicates, and linking them together is helpful.\n* Creating tracking issues for an area of work with multiple related issues is helpful.\n* Calling out things which seem important for extra attention is helpful.\n* Improving steps to reproduce is helpful.\n* Testing and adding a comment with \"Could not reproduce\" if an issue seems obscure is helpful.\n* Testing open pull requests.\n* You can be granted write permission if you've helped a lot with triage by pinging @bbondy, @bsclifton, @kjozwiak, or another Brave team member.\n* Helping make sure issues have a clear and understandable name (ex: not something like \"Brave is broken\").\n* The first comment in an issue ideally would have a clear description of the issue and describe the impact to users. Asking folks for screenshots, steps to reproduce, and more information is highly recommended so that the issue is as clear as possible.\n* If the issue is a duplicate, please let the issue creator know in a polite way how they can follow and track progress of the parent issue (including an ETA if it's marked with a milestone).\n"

You must inform recipients that the Source\nCode Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\nLicense, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\nattempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\nForm.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\nprovided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\nthe Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\nSoftware with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\nCovered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\nLicense permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\nunder the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\nthe Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\nSoftware under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\nLicense(s).\n\n3.4.

In particular, it fetches and syncs code from the projects defined in `package.json` and `src/brave/DEPS`:\n\n  - [Chromium](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git)\n    - Fetches code via `depot_tools`.\n    - Sets the branch for Chromium (ex: 65.0.3325.181).\n  - [brave-core](https://github.com/brave/brave-core)\n    - Mounted at `src/brave`.\n    - Maintains patches for 3rd party Chromium code.\n  - [adblock-rust](https://github.com/brave/adblock-rust)\n    - Implements Brave's ad-block engine.\n    - Linked through [brave/adblock-rust-ffi](https://github.com/brave/brave-core/tree/master/components/adblock_rust_ffi).\n\n## Downloads\n\nYou can [visit our website](https://brave.com/download) to get the latest stable release.\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease see the [contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nOur [Wiki](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki) also has some useful technical information.\n\n## Community\n\n[Join the Q&A community](https://community.brave.com/) if you'd like to get more involved with Brave. You can [ask for help](https://community.brave.com/c/support-and-troubleshooting),\n[discuss features you'd like to see](https://community.brave.com/c/brave-feature-requests), and a lot more. We'd love to have your help so that we can continue improving Brave.\n\nHelp us translate Brave to your language by submitting translations at https://explore.transifex.com/brave/brave_en/.\n\nFollow [@brave](https://twitter.com/brave) on Twitter for important news and announcements.\n\n## Install prerequisites\n\nFollow the instructions for your platform:\n\n- [macOS](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/macOS-Development-Environment)\n- [iOS](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/iOS-Development-Environment)\n- [Windows](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/Windows-Development-Environment)\n- [Linux/Android](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/Linux-Development-Environment)\n\n## Clone and initialize the repo\n\nOnce you have the prerequisites installed, you can get the code and initialize the build environment.\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:brave/brave-core.git path-to-your-project-folder/src/brave\ncd path-to-your-project-folder/src/brave\nnpm install\n\n# the Chromium source is downloaded, which has a large history (gigabytes of data)\n# this might take really long to finish depending on internet speed\n\nnpm run init\n```\nbrave-core based android builds should use `npm run init -- --target_os=android --target_arch=arm` (or whichever CPU type you want to build for)\nbrave-core based iOS builds should use `npm run init -- --target_os=ios`\n\nYou can also set the target_os and target_arch for init and build using:\n\n```\nnpm config set target_os android\nnpm config set target_arch arm\n```\n\nAdditional parameters needed to build are documented at https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/Build-configuration\n\nInternal developers can find more information at https://github.com/brave/devops/wiki/%60.env%60-config-for-Brave-Developers\n\n## Build Brave\nThe default build type is component.\n\n```\n# start the component build compile\nnpm run build\n```\n\nTo do a release build:\n\n```\n# start the release compile\nnpm run build Release\n```\n\nbrave-core based android builds should use `npm run build -- --target_os=android --target_arch=arm` or set the npm config variables as specified above for `init`\n\nbrave-core based iOS builds should use the Xcode project found in `ios/brave-ios/App`. You can open this project directly or run `npm run ios_bootstrap -- --open_xcodeproj` to have it opened in Xcode. See the [iOS Developer Environment](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/iOS-Development-Environment#Building) for more information on iOS builds.\n\n### Build Configurations\n\nRunning a release build with `npm run build Release` can be very slow and use a lot of RAM, especially on Linux with the Gold LLVM plugin.\n\nTo run a statically linked build (takes longer to build, but starts faster):\n\n```bash\nnpm run build -- Static\n```\n\nTo run a debug build (Component build with is_debug=true):\n\n```bash\nnpm run build -- Debug\n```\nNOTE: the build will take a while to complete. Depending on your processor and memory, it could potentially take a few hours.\n\n## Run Brave\nTo start the build:\n\n`npm start [Release|Component|Static|Debug]`\n\n# Update Brave\n\n`npm run sync -- [--force] [--init] [--create] [brave_core_ref]`\n\n**This will attempt to stash your local changes in brave-core, but it's safer to commit local changes before running this**\n\n`npm run sync` will (depending on the below flags):\n\n1. 📥 Update sub-projects (chromium, brave-core) to latest commit of a git ref (e.g. tag or branch)\n2. 🤕 Apply patches\n3. 🔄 Update gclient DEPS dependencies\n4. ⏩ Run hooks (e.g. to perform `npm install` on child projects)\n\n| flag | Description |\n|---|---|\n|`[no flags]`|updates chromium if needed and re-applies patches. If the chromium version did not change, it will only re-apply patches that have changed. Will update child dependencies **only if any project needed updating during this script run**. <br> **Use this if you want the script to manage keeping you up to date instead of pulling or switching branches manually. **|\n|`--force`|updates both _Chromium_ and _brave-core_ to the latest remote commit for the current brave-core branch and the _Chromium_ ref specified in brave-browser/package.json (e.g. `master` or `74.0.0.103`). Will re-apply all patches. Will force update all child dependencies. <br> **Use this if you're having trouble and want to force the branches back to a known state. **|\n|`--init`|force update both _Chromium_ and _brave-core_ to the versions specified in brave-browser/package.json and force updates all dependent repos - same as `npm run init`|\n|`--sync_chromium (true/false)`|Will force or skip the chromium version update when applicable. Useful if you want to avoid a minor update when not ready for the larger build time a chromium update may result in. A warning will be output about the current code state expecting a different chromium version. Your build may fail as a result.|\n|`-D, --delete_unused_deps`|Will delete from the working copy any dependencies that have been removed since the last sync. Mimics `gclient sync -D`.|\n\nRun `npm run sync brave_core_ref` to checkout the specified _brave-core_ ref and update all dependent repos including chromium if needed.\n\n## Scenarios\n\n#### Create a new branch:\n```bash\nbrave-browser> cd src/brave\nbrave-browser/src/brave> git checkout -b branch_name\n```\n\n#### Checkout an existing branch or tag:\n```bash\nbrave-browser/src/brave> git fetch origin\nbrave-browser/src/brave> git checkout [-b] branch_name\nbrave-browser/src/brave> npm run sync\n...Updating 2 patches...\n...Updating child dependencies...\n...Running hooks...\n```\n\n#### Update the current branch to the latest remote:\n```bash\nbrave-browser/src/brave> git pull\nbrave-browser/src/brave> npm run sync\n...Updating 2 patches...\n...Updating child dependencies...\n...Running hooks...\n```\n\n#### Reset to latest brave-browser master and brave-core master (via `init`, will always result in a longer build and will remove any pending changes in your brave-core working directory):\n```bash\nbrave-browser> git checkout master\nbrave-browser> git pull\nbrave-browser> npm run sync -- --init\n```\n\n#### When you know that DEPS didn't change, but .patch files did (quickest attempt to perform a mini-sync before a build):\n```bash\nbrave-browser/src/brave> git checkout featureB\nbrave-browser/src/brave> git pull\nbrave-browser/src/brave> cd ../..\nbrave-browser> npm run apply_patches\n...Applying 2 patches...\n```\n\n# Enabling third-party APIs:\n\n1. **Google Safe Browsing**: Get an API key with SafeBrowsing API enabled from https://console.developers.google.com/.
