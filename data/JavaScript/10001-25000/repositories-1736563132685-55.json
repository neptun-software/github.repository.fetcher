Please read and follow our [Code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n## How can I contribute?\n\n### Improve documentation\n\nAs a **semantic-release** user, you are the perfect candidate to help us improve our documentation: typo corrections, clarifications, more examples, new [recipes](docs/recipes), etc. Take a look at the [documentation issues that need help](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+user%3Asemantic-release+archived%3Afalse+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+label%3Adocs+).\n\nPlease follow the [Documentation guidelines](#documentation).\n\n### Give feedback on issues\n\nSome issues are created without information requested in the [Bug report guideline](#bug-report).\nHelp make them easier to resolve by adding any relevant information.\n\nIssues with the [design label](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+user%3Asemantic-release+archived%3Afalse+label%3Adesign) are meant to discuss the implementation of new features.\nParticipating in the discussion is a good opportunity to get involved and influence the future direction of **semantic-release**.\n\n### Fix bugs and implement features\n\nConfirmed bugs and ready-to-implement features are marked with the [help wanted label](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+user%3Asemantic-release+archived%3Afalse+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).\nPost a comment on an issue to indicate you would like to work on it and to request help from the [@semantic-release/maintainers](https://github.com/orgs/semantic-release/teams/contributors) and the community.\n\n## Using the issue tracker\n\nThe issue tracker is the channel for [bug reports](#bug-report), [features requests](#feature-request) and [submitting pull requests](#submitting-a-pull-request) only.\nPlease use the [Support](docs/support/README.md) and [Get help](README.md#get-help) sections for support, troubleshooting and questions.\n\nBefore opening an issue or a Pull Request, please use the [GitHub issue search](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=user%3Asemantic-release) to make sure the bug or feature request hasn't been already reported or fixed.\n\n### Bug report\n\nA good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you for more information.\nPlease try to be as detailed as possible in your report and fill the information requested in the [bug report template](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/issues/new?template=01_bug_report.md).\n\n### Feature request\n\nFeature requests are welcome, but take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project.\nIt's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature.\nPlease provide as much detail and context as possible and fill the information requested in the [feature request template](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/issues/new?template=02_feature_request.md).\n\n### New plugin request\n\n[Plugins](docs/usage/plugins.md) are a great way to extend **semantic-release** capabilities, integrate with other systems and support new project type.\nPlease provide as much detail and context as possible and fill the information requested in the [plugin suggestion template](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/issues/new?template=03_plugin_suggestion.md).\n\n## Submitting a Pull Request\n\nGood pull requests, whether patches, improvements, or new features, are a fantastic help.\nThey should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.\n\n**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull requests (e.g. implementing features, refactoring code), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the project's maintainers might not want to merge into the project.\n\nIf you have never created a pull request before, welcome 🎉 😄.\n[Here is a great tutorial](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#opening-a-pull-request) on how to send one :)\n\nHere is a summary of the steps to follow:\n\n1. [Set up the workspace](#set-up-the-workspace)\n2. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream and update dependencies:\n\n```bash\n$ git checkout master\n$ git pull upstream master\n$ rm -rf node_modules\n$ npm install\n```\n\n3. Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to contain your feature, change, or fix:\n\n```bash\n$ git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>\n```\n\n4. Make your code changes, following the [Coding rules](#coding-rules)\n5. Push your topic branch up to your fork:\n\n```bash\n$ git push origin <topic-branch-name>\n```\n\n6. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/#creating-the-pull-request) with a clear title and description.\n\n**Tips**:\n\n- For ambitious tasks, open a Pull Request as soon as possible with the `[WIP]` prefix in the title, in order to get feedback and help from the community.\n- [Allow semantic-release maintainers to make changes to your Pull Request branch](https://help.github.com/articles/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork).\n  This way, we can rebase it and make some minor changes if necessary.\n  All changes we make will be done in new commit, and we'll ask for your approval before merging them.\n\n## Coding rules\n\n### Source code\n\nTo ensure consistency and quality throughout the source code, all code modifications must have:\n\n- No [linting](#lint) errors\n- A [test](#tests) for every possible case introduced by your code change\n- **100%** test coverage\n- [Valid commit message(s)](#commit-message-guidelines)\n- Documentation for new features\n- Updated documentation for modified features\n\n### Documentation\n\nTo ensure consistency and quality, all documentation modifications must:\n\n- Refer to brand in [bold](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#styling-text) with proper capitalization, i.e. **GitHub**, **semantic-release**, **npm**\n- Prefer [tables](https://help.github.com/articles/organizing-information-with-tables) over [lists](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#lists) when listing key values, i.e. List of options with their description\n- Use [links](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#links) when you are referring to:\n  - a **semantic-release** concept described somewhere else in the documentation, i.e. How to [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n  - a third-party product/brand/service, i.e. Integrate with [GitHub](https://github.com)\n  - an external concept or feature, i.e. Create a [GitHub release](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases)\n  - a package or module, i.e. The [`@semantic-release/github`](https://github.com/semantic-release/github) module\n- Use the [single backtick `code` quoting](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#quoting-code) for:\n  - commands inside sentences, i.e. the `semantic-release` command\n  - programming language keywords, i.e. `function`, `async`, `String`\n  - packages or modules, i.e. The [`@semantic-release/github`](https://github.com/semantic-release/github) module\n- Use the [triple backtick `code` formatting](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks) for:\n  - code examples\n  - configuration examples\n  - sequence of command lines\n\n### Commit message guidelines\n\n#### Atomic commits\n\nIf possible, make [atomic commits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_commit), which means:\n\n- a commit should contain exactly one self-contained functional change\n- a functional change should be contained in exactly one commit\n- a commit should not create an inconsistent state (such as test errors, linting errors, partial fix, feature without documentation, etc...)\n\nA complex feature can be broken down into multiple commits as long as each one maintains a consistent state and consists of a self-contained change.\n\n#### Commit message format\n\nEach commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**.\nThe header has a special format that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:\n\n```commit\n<type>(<scope>): <subject>\n<BLANK LINE>\n<body>\n<BLANK LINE>\n<footer>\n```\n\nThe **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.\n\nThe **footer** can contain a [closing reference to an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages).\n\n#### Revert\n\nIf the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert: `, followed by the header of the reverted commit.\nIn the body it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.\n\n#### Type\n\nThe type must be one of the following:\n\n| Type         | Description                                                                                                 |\n| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **build**    | Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)         |\n| **ci**       | Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs) |\n| **docs**     | Documentation only changes                                                                                  |\n| **feat**     | A new feature                                                                                               |\n| **fix**      | A bug fix                                                                                                   |\n| **perf**     | A code change that improves performance                                                                     |\n| **refactor** | A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature                                                   |\n| **style**    | Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)      |\n| **test**     | Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests                                                           |\n\n#### Subject\n\nThe subject contains succinct description of the change:\n\n- use the imperative, present tense: \"change\" not \"changed\" nor \"changes\"\n- don't capitalize first letter\n- no dot (.) at the end\n\n#### Body\n\nJust as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: \"change\" not \"changed\" nor \"changes\".\nThe body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.\n\n#### Footer\n\nThe footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to reference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**.\n\n**Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines.\nThe rest of the commit message is then used for this.\n\n#### Examples\n\n```commit\nfix(pencil): stop graphite breaking when too much pressure applied\n```\n\n```commit\nfeat(pencil): add 'graphiteWidth' option\n\nFix #42\n```\n\n```commit\nperf(pencil): remove graphiteWidth option\n\nBREAKING CHANGE: The graphiteWidth option has been removed.\n\nThe default graphite width of 10mm is always used for performance reasons.\n```\n\n## Working with the code\n\n### Set up the workspace\n\n[Fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#fork) the project, [clone](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#clone) your fork, configure the remotes and install the dependencies:\n\n```bash\n# Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory\n$ git clone https://github.com/semantic-release/<repo-name>\n# Navigate to the newly cloned directory\n$ cd <repo-name>\n# Assign the original repo to a remote called \"upstream\"\n$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/semantic-release/<repo-name>\n# Switch your node version to the version defined by the project as the development version\n# This step assumes you have already installed and configured https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm\n# You may need to run `nvm install` if you have not already installed the development node version\n$ nvm use\n# Install the dependencies\n$ npm install\n```\n\n### Verification\n\nThe `test` script is structured to execute as much of the verification for the project as possible.\nEnsuring that the `test` script fully passes in the node version defined as the development version in the `.nvmrc`\nminimizes the chances of the test workflow failing after pushing your changes.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Before pushing your code changes, be sure to run the verification for the project with `npm test`.\n\n[npm-run-all2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-run-all2) is used to enable running multiple independent lint and test\nscripts together from the `test` script.\nThis enables the test script to not only run all scripts, but also parallelize some of the scripts to optimize the overall\ntime required for verification.\n\nWhen a failure occurs with the `test`, the output can be a bit confusing because there may be output from multiple parallel\nscripts mixed together.\nTo investigate the failure with cleaner output, re-run the problematic script directly using the script name from the label\nincluded on the left side of the output\n\n```shell\n$ npm run <script-name>\n```\n\n#### Lint\n\n##### Prettier\n\nAll the [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release) repositories use [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for formatting.\nPrettier formatting will be automatically verified by the `lint:prettier` script, included in the `test` script.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Most linting errors can be automatically fixed with `npm run lint:prettier:fix`.\n\n##### Other Lint Tools\n\nOther tools are used for specific compatibility concerns, but are less likely to result in failures in common contributions.\nPlease follow the guidance of these tools if failures are encountered.\n\n#### Tests\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Before pushing your code changes make sure all **tests pass** and the unit test **coverage is 100%**:\n\nAll the [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release) repositories use [AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava) for writing and running tests.\n\nDuring development, you can:\n\n- run only a subset of test files with `ava <glob>`, for example `ava test/mytestfile.test.js`\n- run in watch mode with `ava -w` to automatically run a test file when you modify it\n- run only the test you are working on by adding [`.only` to the test definition](https://github.com/avajs/ava#running-specific-tests)\n\n##### Unit Tests\n\n```bash\n$ npm run test:unit\n```\n\n##### Integration Tests\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Running the integration test requires you to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation) on your machine.\n\n```bash\n$ npm run test:integration\n```\n\n### Commits\n\nAll the [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release) repositories use [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) to help you create [valid commit messages](#commit-message-guidelines).\n\nAssuming you have [installed Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli#installing-the-command-line-tool), run `git cz` to start the interactive commit message CLI rather than `git commit` when committing.\n"

Versioning](http://semver.org) specification and communicating the **impact** of changes to consumers.\n\n> Trust us, this will change your workflow for the better. – [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-how-to-write-a-javascript-library-automating-releases-with-semantic-release)\n\n## Highlights\n\n- Fully automated release\n- Enforce [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) specification\n- New features and fixes are immediately available to users\n- Notify maintainers and users of new releases\n- Use formalized commit message convention to document changes in the codebase\n- Publish on different distribution channels (such as [npm dist-tags](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/dist-tag)) based on git merges\n- Integrate with your [continuous integration workflow](docs/recipes/release-workflow/README.md#ci-configurations)\n- Avoid potential errors associated with manual releases\n- Support any [package managers and languages](docs/recipes/release-workflow/README.md#package-managers-and-languages) via [plugins](docs/usage/plugins.md)\n- Simple and reusable configuration via [shareable configurations](docs/usage/shareable-configurations.md)\n- Support for [npm package provenance](https://github.com/semantic-release/npm#npm-provenance) that promotes increased supply-chain security via signed attestations on GitHub Actions\n\n## How does it work?\n\n### Commit message format\n\n**semantic-release** uses the commit messages to determine the consumer impact of changes in the codebase.\nFollowing formalized conventions for commit messages, **semantic-release** automatically determines the next [semantic version](https://semver.org) number, generates a changelog and publishes the release.\n\nBy default, **semantic-release** uses [Angular Commit Message Conventions](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-format).\nThe commit message format can be changed with the [`preset` or `config` options](docs/usage/configuration.md#options) of the [@semantic-release/commit-analyzer](https://github.com/semantic-release/commit-analyzer#options) and [@semantic-release/release-notes-generator](https://github.com/semantic-release/release-notes-generator#options) plugins.\n\nTools such as [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) or [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) can be used to help contributors and enforce valid commit messages.\n\nThe table below shows which commit message gets you which release type when `semantic-release` runs (using the default configuration):\n\n| Commit message                                                                                                                                                                                   | Release type                                                                                                    |\n|

                                                                                                             | ~~Patch~~ Fix Release

CHANGE: The graphiteWidth option has been removed.`<br>`The default graphite width of 10mm is always used for performance reasons.` | ~~Major~~ Breaking Release <br /> (Note that the `BREAKING CHANGE: ` token must be in the footer of the commit) |\n\n### Automation with CI\n\n**semantic-release** is meant to be executed on the CI environment after every successful build on the release branch.\nThis way no human is directly involved in the release process and the releases are guaranteed to be [unromantic and unsentimental](https://github.com/dominictarr/sentimental-versioning#readme).\n\n### Triggering a release\n\nFor each new commit added to one of the release branches (for example: `master`, `main`, `next`, `beta`), with `git push` or by merging a pull request or merging from another branch, a CI build is triggered and runs the `semantic-release` command to make a release if there are codebase changes since the last release that affect the package functionalities.\n\n**semantic-release** offers various ways to control the timing, the content and the audience of published releases.\nSee example workflows in the following recipes:\n\n- [Using distribution channels](docs/recipes/release-workflow/distribution-channels.md#publishing-on-distribution-channels)\n- [Maintenance releases](docs/recipes/release-workflow/maintenance-releases.md#publishing-maintenance-releases)\n- [Pre-releases](docs/recipes/release-workflow/pre-releases.md#publishing-pre-releases)\n\n### Release steps\n\nAfter running the tests, the command `semantic-release` will execute the following steps:\n\n| Step              | Description                                                                                                                     |\n| ----------------- |

                              |\n| Publish           | Publish the release.                                                                                                            |\n| Notify
