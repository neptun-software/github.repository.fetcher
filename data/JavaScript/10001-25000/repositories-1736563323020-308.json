Update your scripts to use --preload instead of --require. Ref: https://github.com/js-cli/js-liftoff/commit/e7a969d6706e730d90abb4e24d3cb4d3bce06ddb.\nv1.3.0\n  date: 2020-08-18\n  changes:\n    - Switch to use `safeLoad` for loading YML files via `file.readYAML`.\n    - Upgrade legacy-log to ~3.0.0.\n    - Upgrade legacy-util to ~2.0.0.\nv1.2.1\n  date: 2020-07-07\n  changes:\n    - Remove path-is-absolute dependency.\n      (PR: https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/pull/1715)\nv1.2.0\n  date: 2020-07-03\n  changes:\n    - Allow usage of grunt plugins that are located in any location that\n      is visible to Node.js and NPM, instead of node_modules directly\n      inside package that have a dev dependency to these plugins.\n      (PR: https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/pull/1677)\n    - Removed coffeescript from dependencies. To ease transition, if\n      coffeescript is still around, Grunt will attempt to load it.\n      If it is not, and the user loads a CoffeeScript file,\n      Grunt will print a useful error indicating that the\n      coffeescript package should be installed as a dev dependency.\n      This is considerably more user-friendly than dropping the require entirely,\n      but doing so is feasible with the latest grunt-cli as users\n      may simply use grunt --require coffeescript/register.\n      (PR: https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/pull/1675)\n    - Exposes Grunt Option keys for ease of use.\n      (PR: https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/pull/1570)\n    - Avoiding infinite loop on very long command names.\n      (PR: https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/pull/1697)\nv1.1.0\n  date: 2020-03-16\n  changes:\n    - Update to mkdirp ~1.0.3\n    - Only support versions of Node >= 8\nv1.0.4\n  date: 2019-04-22\n  changes:\n    - Update js-yaml to address https://npmjs.com/advisories/788\n    - Use SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH to render dates in template.\nv1.0.3\n  date: 2018-06-03\n  changes:\n    - Drop support for Node 0.10 and 0.12.\n    - Dependency updates: rimraf, grunt-legacy-log, grunt-legacy-util.\n    - Fix race condition with file.mkdir.\nv1.0.2\n  date: 2018-02-07\n  changes:\n    - Fix for readYAML error messages.\n    - Remove deprecation warning for coffeescript. Pull #1621.\nv1.0.1\n  date: 2016-04-05\n  changes:\n    - minor fix for npm issues when installing grunt and grunt-cli at the same time. Pull #1500.\nv1.0.0\n  date: 2016-04-04\n  changes:\n    - full list of changes is on http://gruntjs.com, please also see changes from 1.0.0-rc1.\n    - if you have a Grunt plugin that includes `grunt` in the `peerDependencies`,\n      we recommend tagging with `\"grunt\": \"\">= 0.4.0\"` and publishing a new version on npm.\n    - Prevent async callback from being called multiple times. Pull #1464.\n    - Update copyright to jQuery Foundation and remove redundant headers. Fixes #1478.\n    - Update glob to 7.0.x. Fixes #1467.\n    - Removing duplicate BOM strip code. Pull #1482.\n    - Update legacy log and util to 1.0.0.\n    - Update to latest cli ~1.2.0.\n    - Use grunt-known-options for shared options between Grunt and grunt-cli.\nv1.0.0-rc1\n  date: 2016-02-11\n  changes:\n    - full list of changes is on http://gruntjs.com\n    - if you have a Grunt plugin that includes `grunt` in the `peerDependencies`,\n      we recommend tagging with `\"grunt\": \"\">= 0.4.0\"`\n    - `coffee-script` is upgraded to `~1.10.0` which could incur breaking changes\n      when using the language with plugins and Gruntfiles.\n    - `nopt` is upgraded to `~3.0.6` which has fixed many issues, including passing\n      multiple arguments and dealing with numbers as options. Be aware previously\n      `--foo bar` used to pass the value `'bar'` to the option `foo`. It will now\n      set the option `foo` to `true` and run the task `bar`.\n    -`glob` is upgraded to `~6.0.4` and `minimatch` is upgraded to `~3.0.0`. Results\n      are now sorted by default with `grunt.file.expandMapping()`. Pass the\n      `nosort: true` option if you don't want the results to be sorted.\n    - `lodash` was upgraded to `~4.3.0`. Many changes have occurred. Some of which\n      that directly effect Grunt are `grunt.util._.template()` returns a compile\n      function and `grunt.util._.flatten` no longer flattens deeply.\n      `grunt.util._` is deprecated and we highly encourage you to\n      `npm install lodash` and `var _ = require('lodash')` to use `lodash`.\n      Please see the lodash changelog for a full list of changes: https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/Changelog\n    - `iconv-lite` is upgraded to `~0.4.13` and strips the BOM by default.\n    - `js-yaml` is upgraded to `~3.5.2` and may affect `grunt.file.readYAML`.\n      We encourage you to please `npm install js-yaml` and use\n      `var YAML = require('js-yaml')` directly in case of future deprecations.\n    - A file `mode` option can be passed into\n      [grunt.file.write()](http://gruntjs.com/api/grunt.file#grunt.file.write).\n    - `Done, without errors.` was changed to `Done.` to avoid failing by mistake\n      on the word `errors`.\nv0.4.5:\n  date: 2014-05-12\n  changes:\n    - Updated rimraf to 2.2.8. Closes gh-1134.\n    - Moved grunt.log into separate grunt-legacy-log module.\n    - Updated grunt-legacy-util to 0.2.0.

Closes gh-1034.\n    - Better error in renameTask if task doesn't exist. Closes gh-1058.\n    - Update rimraf to latest version. Closes gh-1043.\n    - Empty string \"ext\" should strip extension.

See \"grunt-contrib\" 0.8.0 for details.'\n    - Fix stdout / stderr issues on Windows. Closes gh-940, gh-921, gh-744, gh-792, gh-644, gh-708.\n    - Fix pipe-redirecting on Windows. Closes gh-510.\n    - Fixed this.options() in renamed basic tasks. Closes gh-855.\n    - Update underscore.string dependency to follow semver. Closes gh-886.\n    - Output task options in verbose mode. Closes gh-749.\n    - Add file.preserveBOM property. Closes gh-806, gh-937.\n    - Test that file methods warn.

The full text is included [below](#contributor-covenant-code-of-conduct) in English, and translations are available from the Contributor Covenant organisation:\n\n- [contributor-covenant.org/translations](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/translations)\n- [github.com/ContributorCovenant](https://github.com/ContributorCovenant/contributor_covenant/tree/release/content/version/2/0)\n\nRefer to the sections on reporting and escalation in this document for the specific emails that can be used to report and escalate issues.\n\n## Reporting\n\n### Project Spaces\n\nFor reporting issues in spaces related to a member project please use the email provided by the project for reporting. Projects handle CoC issues related to the spaces that they maintain. Projects maintainers commit to:\n\n- maintain the confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident\n- to participate in the path for escalation as outlined in\n  the section on Escalation when required.\n\n### Foundation Spaces\n\nFor reporting issues in spaces managed by the OpenJS Foundation, for example, repositories within the OpenJS organization, use the email `report@lists.openjsf.org`. The Cross Project Council (CPC) is responsible for managing these reports and commits to:\n\n- maintain the confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident\n- to participate in the path for escalation as outlined in\n  the section on Escalation when required.\n\n## Escalation\n\nThe OpenJS Foundation maintains a Code of Conduct Panel (CoCP). This is a foundation-wide team established to manage escalation when a reporter believes that a report to a member project or the CPC has not been properly handled. In order to escalate to the CoCP send an email to `coc-escalation@lists.openjsf.org`.\n\nFor more information, refer to the full\n[Code of Conduct governance document](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/bootstrap/blob/master/proposals/stage-2/CODE_OF_CONDUCT/FOUNDATION_CODE_OF_CONDUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md).\n\n---\n\n## Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct v2.0\n\n### Our Pledge\n\nWe as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.\n\nWe pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.\n\n### Our Standards\n\nExamples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:\n\n* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people\n* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences\n* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback\n* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience\n* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community\n\nExamples of unacceptable behavior include:\n\n* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind\n* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks\n* Public or private harassment\n* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission\n* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting\n\n### Enforcement Responsibilities\n\nCommunity leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.\n\nCommunity leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.\n\n### Scope\n\nThis Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.\n\n### Enforcement\n\nInstances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at the email addresses listed above in the [Reporting](#reporting) and [Escalation](#escalation) sections. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.\n\nAll community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.\n\n### Enforcement Guidelines\n\nCommunity leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:\n\n#### 1. Correction\n\n**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.\n\n**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.\n\n#### 2. Warning\n\n**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.\n\n**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.\n\n#### 3. Temporary Ban\n\n**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.\n\n**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.\n\n#### 4. Permanent Ban\n\n**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior,  harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.\n\n**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the project community.\n\n### Attribution\n\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.0, available at [contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct).\n\nCommunity Impact Guidelines were inspired by [Mozilla's code of conduct enforcement ladder](https://github.com/mozilla/diversity).\n\nFor answers to common questions about this code of conduct, see the FAQ at\n[contributor-covenant.org/faq](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/faq).
