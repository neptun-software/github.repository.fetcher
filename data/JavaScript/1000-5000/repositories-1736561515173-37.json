Tests are the\nbest way to ensure that future contributors do not break your code\naccidentally.\n\nTo change the Closure Library source, you must submit a pull request\nin GitHub. See the GitHub documentation here:\n\nhttps://help.github.com/categories/63/articles\n\nClosure Library developers monitor outstanding pull requests. They may\nrequest changes on the pull request before accepting. They will also\nverify that the CLA has been signed.\n\nOftentimes, the pull request will not be directly merged, but patched to\nthe internal Google codebase to verify that unit and integration tests\nwill pass before submitting (and optionally make changes to the patch to\nmatch style, fix text, or to make the code or comments clearer). In this\ncase, the issue associated with the pull request will be closed when the\npatch is pushed to the repository via the MOE (Make Open Easy) system.\n\nhttps://github.com/google/MOE/\n"

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n"
