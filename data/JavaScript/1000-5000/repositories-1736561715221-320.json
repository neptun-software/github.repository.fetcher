(e.g. `feature--autoplay` or `bugfix--ios-crash`)\n\t* Usually this is based on the master branch.\n\t* Create a branch based on master; `git branch\n\tfix/master/my_contribution master` then checkout the new branch with `git\n\tcheckout fix/master/my_contribution`.  Please avoid working directly on the `master` branch.\n* Make sure you stick to the coding style that is used already.\n* Make commits of logical units and describe them properly.\n* Syntax:\n    * Four spaces, no tabs.\n    * No trailing whitespace.

It can run on any unix-like machine (Linux, Mac OS X). It is an open source component of [codebox.io](https://www.codebox.io) (Cloud IDE as a Service).\n\nThe IDE can run on your desktop (Linux or Mac), on your server or the cloud. You can use the [codebox.io](https://www.codebox.io) service to host and manage IDE instances.\n\nCodebox is built with web technologies: `node.js`, `javascript`, `html` and `less`. The IDE possesses a very modular and extensible architecture, that allows you to build your own features with through add-ons. Codebox is the first open and modular IDE capable of running both on the Desktop and in the cloud (with offline support).\n\nThe project is open source under the [Apache 2.0](https://github.com/FriendCode/codebox/blob/master/LICENSE) license.\nA screencast of the IDE is available on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvPEngyXA2A).\n\n![Image](https://raw.github.com/FriendCode/codebox/master/screenshot.png)\n\n## How to install and run Codebox\n\n#### Desktop Applications\n\nInstallers for the latest stable build for **Mac** and **Linux** can be downloaded on the [release page](https://github.com/FriendCode/codebox/releases).\n\nInstructions on how to install it can be found for each release.\n\n#### Install from NPM\n\nCodebox can be installed as a Node package and use programatically or from the command line.\n\nInstall Codebox globally using NPM:\n```\n$ npm install -g codebox\n```\n\nAnd start the IDE from the command line:\n```\n$ codebox run ./myworkspace --open\n```\n\nUse this command to run and open Codebox IDE. By default, Codebox uses GIT to identify you, you can use the option ```--email=john.doe@gmail.com``` to define the email you want to use during GIT operations.\n\nOthers comand line options are available and can be list with: ```codebox --help```. For deeper configuration, take a look at the documentation about [environment variables](http://help.codebox.io/ide/env.html).\n\n#### Command line options\n\n```\n-h, --help              output usage information\n-V, --version           output the version number\n-r, --root [path]       Root folder for the workspace, default is current directory\n-t, --templates [list]  Configuration templates, separated by commas\n-p, --port [port]       HTTP port\n```\n\n#### Need help?\n\nThe IDE's documentation can be found at [help.codebox.io](http://help.codebox.io). Feel free to ask any questions or signal problems by adding issues.\n\n## Helping Codebox\n\n**I want to help with the code:** Codebox accepts pull-requests, please see the [Contributing to Codebox](https://github.com/FriendCode/codebox/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide for information on contributing to this project. And don't forget to add your contact informations on the AUTHORS list.\n\n**I found a bug:** File it as an [issue](https://github.com/FriendCode/codebox/issues) and please describe as much as possible the bug and the context.\n\n**I have a new suggestion:** For feature requests please first check [the issues list](https://github.com/FriendCode/codebox/issues) to see if it's already there. If not, feel free to file it as an issue and to define the label **enhancement**.\n\n## Contact info\n\n* **Website:** [www.codebox.io](https://www.codebox.io)\n* **Twitter:** [@CodeboxIO](https://twitter.com/CodeboxIO)\n* **Blog:** [blog.codebox.io](http://blog.codebox.io)\n* **Youtube:** [Codebox Channel](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWocQwS2VmDS3Ej0LQYWVIw)\n\n\n"
