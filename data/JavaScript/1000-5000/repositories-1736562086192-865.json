Where do I get help?\n\n**A:** Have you actually tried to fix the problem on your own? Have you compared your code to the final code? If you failed fixing your problem, please **post a detailed description of the problem to the Q&A area of that video over at Udemy**, along with a [codepen](https://codepen.io/pen/) containing your code. You will get help there. Please don't send me a personal message or email to fix coding problems.\n\n### Q3: What VSCode theme are you using?\n\n**A:** I use Oceanic Next (dimmed bg) for all my coding and course production. [Here is my complete VSCode setup](vscode-setup.md).\n\n### Q4: Can I see a final version of the course projects?\n\n**A:** Absolutely! The main project is [Natours](https://www.natours.dev/) (it even got its own domain ðŸ˜Ž). You can log in with `laura@example.com` and password `test1234`. There is also an API at `/api`, with [documentation available here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/4237486/S1LwxnaE?version=latest) (incomplete). The small Node.js introduction project is [Node Farm](https://node-farm.jonas.io/).\n\n### Q5: Videos don't load, can you fix it?\n\n**A:** Unfortunately, there is nothing I can do about it. The course is hosted on Udemy, and sometimes they have technical issues like this. Please just come back a bit later or [contact their support team](https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us).\n\n### Q6: Videos are blurred / have low quality, can you fix it?\n\n**A:** Please open video settings and change the quality from 'Auto' to another value, for example 720p. If that doesn't help, please [contact the Udemy support team](https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us).\n\n### Q7: Are the videos downloadable?\n\n**A:** Yes! I made all videos downloadable from Udemy so you can learn even without an internet connection. To download a video, use the settings icon in the right bottom corner of the video player. Videos have to be downloaded individually.\n\n### Q8: I want to put the project in my portfolio. Is that allowed?\n\n**A:** Absolutely! Just make sure you actually built it yourself by following the course, and that you understand what you did. What is **not allowed** is that you create your own course/videos/articles based on this course's content!\n\n### Q9: I love your courses and want to get updates on new courses. How?\n\n**A:** First, you can subscribe to my email list [at my website](http://codingheroes.io/resources). Plus, I make important announcements on twitter [@jonasschmedtman](https://twitter.com/jonasschmedtman), so you should definitely follow me there ðŸ”¥\n\n### Q10: How do I get my certificate of completion?\n\n**A:** A certificate of completion is provided by Udemy after you complete 100% of the course. After completing the course, just click on the \"Your progress\" indicator in the top right-hand corner of the course page. If you want to change your name on the certificate, please [contact the Udemy support team](https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us).\n\n### Q11: Do you accept pull requests?\n\n**A:** No, for the simple reason that I want this repository to contain the _exact_ same code that is shown in the videos. However, please feel free to add an issue if you found one.\n"

[Link &rarr;](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=naumovs.theme-oceanicnext)\n\n### Extensions used in course videos\n\nFor each of the extensions, read the overview page in order to learn how to use it.\n\n`Prettier` to automatically format code (there is a video in the course on how to set it up). [Link &rarr;](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)\n\n`ESLint` to automatically find errors in code (there is a video in the course on how to set it up). [Link &rarr;](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)\n\n`DotENV` to enable syntax highlighting for .env files. [Link &rarr;](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mikestead.dotenv)\n\n`Pug beautify` to automatically format Pug code. [Link &rarr;](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mrmlnc.vscode-pugbeautify)\n\n`TODO Highlight` to highlight annotations in code. [Link &rarr;](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wayou.vscode-todo-highlight)\n\n`Image previews` for previews on image hover and in the gutter. [Link &rarr;](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kisstkondoros.vscode-gutter-preview)\n\n`TabNine` to autocomplete everything, code and text. [Link &rarr;](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TabNine.tabnine-vscode)\n\n`Path Intellisense` to autocomplete filenames.

[Link &rarr;](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.project-manager)\n\n### Terminal\n\nTo make your terminal as pretty as mine, you need to use a tool called `oh-my-zsh`. I followed [this tutorial &rarr;](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/jazz-up-your-zsh-terminal-in-seven-steps-a-visual-guide-e81a8fd59a38/) to set it up.\n\n### Settings\n\nIf you want your editor to work and look exactly the same way as mine does in the course videos, you can copy these settings to your own settings file (`settings.json`).\n\n```\n{\n  \"workbench.colorTheme\": \"Oceanic Next (dimmed bg)\",\n  \"files.autoSave\": \"onFocusChange\",\n  \"editor.formatOnSave\": true,\n  \"editor.minimap.enabled\": true,\n  \"workbench.statusBar.visible\": true,\n  \"workbench.activityBar.visible\": true,\n  \"editor.formatOnSave\": false,\n  \"editor.wordWrap\": \"on\",\n  \"editor.trimAutoWhitespace\": false,\n  \"eslint.run\": \"onSave\",\n\n  \"workbench.colorCustomizations\": {\n    \"statusBar.background\": \"#333333\",\n    \"statusBar.noFolderBackground\": \"#333333\",\n    \"statusBar.debuggingBackground\": \"#263238\"\n  }\n}\n```\n"
