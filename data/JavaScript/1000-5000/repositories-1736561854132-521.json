They all must follow the following directory structure and naming\nformat:\n\n```\n└ definitions/\n  ├ npm/\n    ├ yargs_v4.x.x/           # <-- The name of the library, followed by _v<VERSION>\n    | |\n    | ├ flow_v0.83.x/         # <-- A folder containing libdefs tested against the\n    | | |                     #     specified version(s) of Flow (v0.83.x in this\n    | | |                     #     case).\n    | | |\n    | | ├ yargs_v4.x.x.js     # <-- The libdef file meant for the Flow version\n    | | |                     #     specified by the containing directory's name.\n    | | |                     #     Must be named `<LIB>_v<VERSION>.js`.\n    | | |\n    | | └ config.json        # <-- An optional file to hold configurations of the\n    | |                       #     definition such as dependent definitions\n    | |\n    | ├ flow_v0.85.x-v0.91.x/ # <-- A folder containing libdefs tested against a\n    | | |                     #     different range of Flow versions:\n    | | |                     #     Anything from v0.85.x to v0.91.x (inclusive)\n    | | |\n    | | ├ yargs_v4.x.x.js     # <-- The libdef file for versions of Flow from\n    | | |                     #     v0.85.x to v0.91.x (inclusive)\n    | | |\n    | | └ test_yargs.js       # <-- Tests in this directory only apply to the\n    | |                       #     adjacent libdef (and thus, are specific to\n    | |                       #     the libdefs for this specific Flow version)\n    | |\n    | └ test_yargs.js         # <-- Tests in this directory apply to libdefs for\n    |                         #     all versions of Flow.\n    ├ color_v0.7.x/\n    ├ ...\n  |\n  ├ environments/\n    ├ jsx/                    # <-- The name of the env environment\n    | |\n    | ├ flow_v0.83.x-/        # <-- A folder containing definition tested against the\n    | | |                     #     specified version(s) of Flow (v0.83.x and onwards\n    | | |                     #     in this case).\n    | | |\n    | | └ jsx.js              # <-- The environment definition file meant for the Flow version\n    | ├ ...\n    ├ ...\n  ├ ...\n```\n\nFlow versions are semantically versioned (semver) with some restrictions:\n\n* All of MAJOR, MINOR, and PATCH versions must be specified. It's acceptable to\n  specify `x` in place of a number for MINOR and PATCH, but MAJOR cannot be `x`.\n* Library versions cannot specify a semver range, but Flow versions can of the\n  following forms:\n  * **`flow_v0.83.x-`**: Flow v0.83.x and above\n  * **`flow_v0.85.x-v0.91.x`**: Flow versions v0.85.x up to v0.91.x (inclusive)\n  * **`flow_-v0.106.x`**: Every version under (and including) Flow v0.106.x\n\n**We structure files this way to enable automated testing and tooling.**\nTests ensure that library definitions continue to work as expected and the\n`flow-typed` tooling ensures that it's as easy as possible to find and install\nlibrary definitions.\n\n## Making a contribution\n\nNow that we understand where definitions go, let's say you've created a definition for an npm package in your own project called `left-pad` at\nversion `4.1.0`. **[You've followed all of the\nbest practices for writing high quality definitions,](https://github.com/flow-typed/flow-typed/issues/13#issuecomment-214892914)**\nand now you'd like to contribute it.\n\n> Flow-typed comes with a handy script to simplify the file creation process (`./create_def.sh`) which takes two args, the library name and the version you'd like to type. In the :point_down: example that would be `./create_def.sh left-pad 4.x.x`.\n>\n> This will cover steps 1 - 4, of course without real definitions or tests written for you.\n\n> Before you start, if you think you have a fairly complicated library definition or one that you have not yet written and tested with your personal project you may consider leveraging our **test harness** which allows you to write code immediately in a simplified clean environment. Learn more [here](https://flow-typed.github.io/flow-typed/#/harness) or just create the harness (`./test_harness.sh`) to get started.\n\n#### 1) Create a new directory called `definitions/npm/left-pad_v4.x.x/`.\n\n***We call this the \"package version directory\".***\n\nThe naming scheme of this directory must be formatted as\n`${packageName}_v${packageVersion}`. This convention is enforced by the\nlibrary-definition test runner.\n\nYou'll notice we specified the minor and patch as `x`, this will ensure that this libdef can cater to as many other consumers as possible, though you may opt to refine the version more if the library you're typing changes dramatically on minor/patch updates.\n\n#### 2) In this new directory, create another new directory called `flow_v0.83.x-/`.\n\n***We call this the \"flow version directory\".***\n\nIf you aren't sure which versions of flow your definition is compatible with,\njust start with `flow_v0.83.x-`, and the test runner\n(which we'll run in a later step) will tell us if there are problems in some\nversions of Flow. `flow_v0.83.x-` is the version where the inexact object syntax\nwas added.\n\nYou may create multiple flow version directories to target different versions of\nFlow if necessary.\n\n#### 3) Place your libdef inside the flow version directory and name it `left-pad_v4.x.x.js`.\n\nThe name of the definition file must match the name of the package version\ndirectory two levels up. This, too, will be enforced by the library-definition\ntest runner.\n\n#### 4) Write a test file whose name starts with `test_` in the flow version directory.\n\n> Such as `test_left-pad_v4.x.x.js`\n\nTests are simply `test_*.js` files that sit next to the library definition\nfile. They are normal @flow-ified .js files that import from and use the types\ndeclared in the libdef in a way they are expected to be used.\n\nThe purpose of a test file is to exercise the library definition to some\nreasonable degree. At minimum your tests should:\n\n1. Import at least one thing from each of the modules `declare`'d in the\n   definition.\n1. Use the library definition in a couple of common ways that *should not*\n   produce a type error.\n1. Use the library definition in a couple of ways that are *expected* to produce\n   a type error. Though type errors should fail your tests, you can add [error suppressions](https://flow.org/en/docs/errors/) to the line above just like you would in your own codebase.\n\n[Here](https://github.com/flow-typed/flow-typed/blob/main/definitions/npm/highlight.js_v8.x.x/test_highlight.js-v8.js)\nis an example of a nice and thorough test file. You don't necessarily have to be\nthis thorough, but the more thorough you are the better!\n\nSometimes you may want to break down your test suite instead of having one gigantic file. In that case you can actually write as many test files as you like as long as their names start with `test_`. [Redux](https://github.com/flow-typed/flow-typed/tree/main/definitions/npm/redux_v4.x.x/flow_v0.134.x-) followed this pattern.\n\nAlternatively you can add test files in the **package version directory** which will be run by\nthe test-runner for *all* versions of flow the package version supports. Though general best practice as outlined above is using the **flow version directory**.\n\n#### 5) Run your tests\n\n```sh\n# You only need to run this once which will\n# build your local CLI allowing the test suite to run\n# and run definition validations/tests\n#\n# If you ever make changes to the CLI files,\n# make sure you rerun `./build.sh` to update the\n# local build of the CLI with your changes.\n./build.sh\n\n# Subsequent testing after initial build can just use the following.\n# This will run all changed files based on a git diff\n# note: If you find that your changed files aren't being picked up\n#       you can try `git add -A` then run the following script\n./quick_run_def_tests.sh\n# If you run this command at a high rate you may reach github's\n# unauthenticated rate limit.\n# Try adding a github auth token in those cases\nGITHUB_TOKEN=your_token ./quick_run_def_tests.sh\n\n# If you want to run something very specific,\n# taking the left-pad example you can point to the\n# local cli script and run tests against it\nnode cli/dist/cli.js run-tests left-pad\n\n# Running the local cli without any args will run `all`\n# tests which may take a while\nnode cli/dist/cli.js run-tests\n```\n\n> Windows instructions TBD if someone wants to help :construction_worker:\n\n#### 6) Send a pull request\n\nYou know how to do it.\n\n---\n\n#### Environment definitions\n\nThe above are instructions on how to submit a library definition against npm packages though the process is similar if contributing environment definitions. Except instead of a package directory you just have an environment package that is the name of the environment without the need of versions.\n\n## Libdef best practices\n\n### Read flow docs\n\nThere's a solid writeup in the [Flow docs](https://flow.org/en/docs/libdefs/creation/) about creating new library definitions. Give it a read!\n\n### Importing types from other libdefs\n\nOften times you may find yourself typing a package that relies on the types from another package. You can do this by first finding the definition at the flow version you'd like to import to and add a `config.json` file.\n\nHere you can declare a `deps` property that holds an object of dependent versions and their supported versions\n\n```json\n{\n  \"deps\": {\n    \"redux\": [\"v3.x.x\", \"v4.x.x\"],\n    \"koa\": [\"2.0.x\", \"2.x.x\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen in your definition module\n\n```js\ndeclare module 'other-module' {\n  import type { Action } from 'redux';\n\n  declare export function takesMyType(val: Action): number;\n}\n```\n\nOne important note here is that all definition flow version ranges **must** be aligned if you want them to depend on each other. This is a limitation of our test suite architecture.\n\nSay you have `react-redux` depending on `redux`; if the flow version with the dependency in `react-redux` is `v0.104.x-0.141.x` then that exact version range must exist in `redux` for testing compatibility. Any other flow version ranges in either definitions can have any range they please if they don't depend on one another.\n\n> Yes, this could lead to overly fragmented flow definition ranges if a definition has many dependencies.\n\n---\n\n**What about `react` types??**\n\nYou can use the raw, private React types (e.g. `React$Node`, `React$ComponentType`) directly without importing them. You can also import the types without declaring it as `\"deps\"` as they're part of the core flow libs like other node internal packages:\n\n```js\ndeclare module 'example' {\n  import type { Node } from 'react';\n}\n```\n\n### Avoid `any` when possible\n\nUsing the `any` type for a variable or interface results in the loss of type information as types pass through it. That means if a type passes through `any` before propagating on to other code, the `any` will potentially cause flow to miss type errors!\n\nIn many places it is better (but also stricter) to use the `mixed` type rather than the `any` type. The `mixed` type is safer in that it allows anything to flow in to it, but can never be used downstream without [dynamic type tests](https://flow.org/en/docs/lang/refinements/#_) that verify the type at runtime.\n\nConsider this code:\n\n```js\nconst cache = new Map();\nfunction setCache(key: string, value: any) {\n  cache.set(key, value);\n}\nfunction getCache(key: string) {\n  return cache.get(key);\n}\n\nsetCache('foo', 42);\nvar someString = getCache('foo'); // oops, 'foo' isn't a string!\nsomeString.length; // but because we used `any`, we don't know toerror here!\n```\n\nBecause we've typed the values of the map as `any`, we open ourselves up to type errors:\n\nIf, however, we had used `mixed` instead of `any`, flow would ask us to verify that the type we got back from `getCache()` is in fact a `string` before using it as one:\n\n```js\nconst cache = new Map();\nfunction setCache(key: string, value: mixed) {\n  cache.set(key, value);\n}\nfunction getCache(key: string) {\n  return cache.get(key);\n}\n\nsetCache('foo', 42);\nvar someString = getCache('foo');\nif (typeof someString === 'string') {\n  someString.length;\n} else {\n  throw new Error('`foo` is unexpectedly something other than a string!');\n}\n```\n\nBecause we used a dynamic type test in the second example, we've proved to flow that the `mixed` result must be a string. If we hadn't done this, flow would have given us an error reminding us that the value could be anything and it isn't safe to assume without checking first.\n\nThere is sometimes a trade-off with using `mixed`, though. Using `mixed` means that if your variable ever does flow downstream, you'll always have to prove what kind of type it is (with a type test) before you can use it. Sometimes this is just too annoying and the risk involved with `any` is just worth the trade-off.\n\nIn the case of library definitions, it is almost always better to use `mixed` for function and method parameters because the trade-off is hidden from users:\n\n```js\ndeclare function setCache(key: string, value: mixed): void;\n\nsetCache('number', 42); // Ok\nsetCache('string', 'asdf'); // Ok\n```\n\nIt is also almost always ok to use `mixed` as the return type of a callback:\n\n```js\ndeclare function getUser(cb: (user: User) => mixed): void;\ngetUser((user) => console.log('Got the user!'));\n```\n\nUsing `mixed` in place of `any` for the return type of a function or the type of a variable is a judgement call, though. Return types and declared variables flow into users' programs, which means that users will have to prove the type of `mixed` before they can use them.\n\n### Exporting modules\n\nWhen you export a module, you have a choice to use CommonJS or ES6 syntax. We generally recommend to use ES6 syntax. As [discussed here](https://github.com/flow-typed/flow-typed/issues/1859#issuecomment-374575368), if you need both named exports and a default export, then you need to use the ES6 syntax.\n\nLearn to export [es6](https://flow.org/en/docs/libdefs/creation/#toc-declaring-an-es-module) or [commonjs](https://flow.org/en/docs/libdefs/creation/#toc-declaring-a-commonjs-module) modules.\n\n### Declaring types\n\nTypes in contrast to variables when declared inside a module do not need to be explicitly exported as they will be exported automatically.\n\nThese two will work the same\n```js\ndeclare type Func = () => void;\ndeclare export type Func = () => void;\n```\n\nIt can then be used like the following, though be aware that even if you're using commonjs in your consuming module your imports will still use es6 import syntax.\n```js\n// In a commonjs module\nimport type { Func } from 'my-module';\n\nconst Foo = require('my-module');\n\n// ---\n// In an es module\nimport Foo, { type Func } from 'my-module';\n```\n\n---\n\nBecause of this feature you may opt to break down types into separate declarations as opposed to inlining them on a variable or property to make it easier for library consumers to cast or annotate a variable.\n\n```js\ndeclare type Options = { ... };\n\nclass Foo {\n  constructor(options?: Options): this;\n}\n\n// or\ntype Bar = { ... };\n\ndeclare module.exports: Bar;\n```\n\n### Avoid global types\n\nSometimes you see global definitions like `$npm$ModuleName$`. This is due to the fact that in the past flow didn't support private types. **Global types should not be used anymore**. Since then Flow has added support for `declare export` which means that every type which doesn't have it are defined as private and can't be imported, see https://flow.org/en/docs/libdefs/creation/#toc-declaring-an-es-module for details.\n\n### Prefer immutability\n\nIf the function does not mutate input values, always prefer immutable types.\nThis is imporant since immutable types accepts mutable types in, but mutable types does not accept immutable types in, see [good example](https://flow.org/try/#0PTAEAEDMBsHsHcBQiAmBTAxtAhgJzaJAK4B2GALgJawmjloDO5AFJSQA5HkBcoAJACU02FAHkS0AJ4BBXLmySAPCSIBbAEZpcAPgCUvAG6xKKANzIMNJoVoBeUMzy5es+UpUate0Le2gA3oigoACQTgB0nAwAFswAjABMAMy6iCH0TI5yuuYAvohAA) and [bad example](https://flow.org/try/#0PTAEAEDMBsHsHcBQiAmBTAxtAhgJzaJAK4B2GALgJawmjloDO5AFJSQA5HkBcoAgrlzYAngB4SRALYAjNLgB8ASl4A3WJRQBuZBhpNCtALyhmeXLwAkAJTTYUAeRLRhAoWIky5S0IfmgA3ogAkPRMpoKK2gC+iEA)\n- Instead of `Array<string>` use `$ReadOnlyArray<string>`\n- Instead of `{ value: string }` prefer `{ +value: string }` [$ReadOnly<{ value: string }>](https://flow.org/en/docs/types/utilities/#toc-readonly)\n\n### Prefer exactness\n\nIf the object has known set of properties, always define them as exact:\n- Instead of `{ +value: string }` prefer `{| +value: string |}`\n\n### Partial/definitions definitions\n\nWe welcome contributions of partial, incomplete or work-in-progress definitions!\nWhen submitting a partial definition, please stub out the missing parts with `any`.\nIf the definition was generated from `create-stub`, those parts should already be stubbed.\n\n### A note on flowgen\n\n[flowgen](https://github.com/joarwilk/flowgen) is a CLI tool that generates flowtype definitions from TypeScript types.\nWhile it supports most of the TypeScript syntax, in some cases manual changes may be needed before use.\nYou can check out supported syntax constructs in thier section on the [state of the converter](https://github.com/joarwilk/flowgen#the-state-of-the-converter).\n\n## Writing tests\n\n### Use `describe` and `it` blocks to limit scope\n\nYou can use `describe` and `it` verbs, much like you do in Mocha/Jest/whatever, to write descriptive tests and limit scope. These are available under 'flow-typed-test'. (Note that they don't actually run tests, they're just sugar to limit scope and emulate the TDD language with which we're all familiar).\n\n```js\nimport { describe, it } from 'flow-typed-test';\n\ndescribe('#someFunction', () => {\n  it('should do something', () => {\n    const a: number = 1;\n  });\n\n  // you can also do type checks outside an it statement\n  //$FlowExpectedError\n  const a: number = 'foo';\n})\n```\n\n`describe` or `it` have the potential of causing collisions. In the event of a name collision, import them under new names.\n\n```js\nimport { describe as foo, it as bar } from 'flow-typed-test';\n\nfoo('#someFunction', () => {\n  bar('should do something', () => {\n    const a: number = 1;\n  });\n\n  // you can also do type checks outside an it statement\n  //$FlowExpectedError\n  const a: number = 'foo';\n});\n```\n\n## Owning definitions\n\nSo you've contributed to a definition and would like to be involved in future maintenance if it gets updated. `flow-typed` allows you to add a `CODEOWNERS` file in either a definition scope (`@scope/`) or definition version (`package_vx.x.x/`) level.\n\nEqually if you want to get notified of updates to `environment` definitions you can add or update the `CODEOWNERS` file in the `environment/env` directory.\n\nJust add your github handle to the file as a newline and you'll be notified next time a pull request is raised if it touched files nested in the `CODEOWNERS` directory.\n\n![bot-pr-comment](docs/_media/bot-pr-comment.png)\n"

As you might have noticed, our activity has slowed down in recent months. However, we are committed to maintaining the functionality of flow-typed and will continue to fix any issues that arise with new releases of Flow.\n>\n> While we're not planning any major new features at the moment, we remain open to feature contributions from the community. Our focus remains on ensuring that the existing features work well and that type definitions are kept up to date. We appreciate the value that these contributions bring and encourage anyone interested in enhancing flow-typed to get involved.\n\nCheck out the [quick start](https://flow-typed.github.io/flow-typed/#/quickstart) page\nin the docs to get started. It will walk you through installing typedefs, using them,\nas well as writing and including your own.\n\n## Huh?\n\nWhen you start a project with Flow, **you likely want to use some third-party\nlibraries that were *not* written with Flow**. By default, Flow will just ignore\nthese libraries **leaving them untyped**. As a result, Flow can't give errors if\nyou accidentally mis-use the library (nor will it be able to auto-complete the\nlibrary).\n\nTo address this, **Flow supports\n[library definitions](https://flow.org/en/docs/libdefs)** which allow\nyou to describe the interface of a module or library separate from the\nimplementation of that module/library.\n\n**The `flow-typed` repo is a collection of high-quality library definitions**,\ntests to ensure that definitions remain high quality, and tooling to make it\nas easy as possible to import them into your project.\n\nAll you have to do when you add one or more new dependencies to your project\nis run `flow-typed install`. This will search the libdef repo and download all\nthe libdefs that are relevant for your project and install them for you. After\nthat, **simply check them in** and be on your way!\n\n## The CLI\n\nThe `flow-typed` npm package provides a CLI that includes several commands for\nworking with this repository. The full list of commands is available\n[in the docs](https://flow-typed.github.io/flow-typed/#/install) .\n\n## FAQs\n\nBefore opening an issue, take a look at the [FAQs](https://flow-typed.github.io/flow-typed/#/faq).\nChances are your question has already been answered! If not, don't hesitate to\n[open an issue](https://github.com/flow-typed/flow-typed/issues/new).\n\n## How Do I Contribute Library Definitions?\n\nJust send a pull request! The documentation highlighted in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/flow-typed/flow-typed/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) should give a detailed overview of how to raise a pull request following our best practices.\n\n### Contributing to the CLI\n\nBugfixes and improvements to the core CLI are welcome. If you'd like to contribute\na new feature, consider opening an issue first to discuss it.\n\n## Active Maintenance Team\n\n[![Andrew Smith](https://github.com/andrewsouthpaw.png?size=100)](https://github.com/andrewsouthpaw) | [![Brian Chen](https://github.com/Brianzchen.png?size=100)](https://github.com/Brianzchen)  | [![Georges-Antoine Assi](https://github.com/gantoine.png?size=100)](https://github.com/gantoine) | [![Pascal Duez](https://github.com/pascalduez.png?size=100)](https://github.com/pascalduez) | [![Ville Saukkonen](https://github.com/villesau.png?size=100)](https://github.com/villesau)\n:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:\n[@AndrewSouthpaw](https://github.com/andrewsouthpaw) | [@Brianzchen](https://github.com/Brianzchen) | [@GAntoine](https://github.com/gantoine) | [@pascalduez](https://github.com/pascalduez) | [@villesau](https://github.com/villesau)\n"
