These American Express Community Guidelines outline our expectations for Github participating members within the American Express community, as well as steps for reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect our community Guidelines to be honored.\n\n**IMPORTANT REMINDER:**\n\nWhen you visit American Express on any third party sites such as GitHub your activity there is subject to that site’s then current terms of use., along with their privacy and data security practices and policies. The Github platform is not affiliated with us and may have practices and policies that are different than are our own.\nPlease note, American Express is not responsible for, and does not control, the GitHub site’s terms of use, privacy and data security practices and policies. You should, therefore, always exercise caution when posting, sharing or otherwise taking any action on that site and, of course, on the Internet in general.\nOur open source community strives to:\n- **Be friendly and patient**.\n- **Be welcoming**: We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all\nbackgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.\n- **Be considerate**: Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else's primary language.\n- **Be respectful**: Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.\n- **Be careful in the words that we choose**: We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable.\n- **Try to understand why we disagree**: Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re all different people. The strength of our community comes from its diversity, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.\n\n### Definitions\nHarassment includes, but is not limited to:\n- Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, age, regional discrimination, political or religious affiliation\n- Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment\n- Deliberate misgendering. This includes deadnaming or persistently using a pronoun that does not correctly reflect a person's gender identity. You must address people by the name they give you when not addressing them by their username or handle\n- Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “hug” or “backrub”) without consent or after a request to stop\n- Threats of violence, both physical and psychological\n- Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide\nor to engage in self-harm\n- Deliberate intimidation\n- Stalking or following\n- Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes\n- Sustained disruption of discussion\n- Unwelcome sexual attention, including gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour\n- Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of\nintimacy with others\n- Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease\n- Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary\nto protect others from intentional abuse\n- Publication of non-harassing private communication\n\nOur open source community prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. We will not act on complaints regarding:\n- ‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’\n- Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not\ndiscussing this with you”\n- Refusal to explain or debate social justice concepts\n- Communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial\n- Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions\n\n### Diversity Statement\nWe encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community for all. Although we will fail at times, we seek to treat everyone both as fairly and equally as possible. Whenever a participant has made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or offended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and do our best to right the wrong.\n\nAlthough this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honor diversity in age, gender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity, language, national origin, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and technical ability. We will not tolerate discrimination based on any of the protected characteristics above, including participants with disabilities.\n\n### Reporting Issues\nIf you experience or witness unacceptable behavior—or have any other concerns—please report it by contacting us at opensource@aexp.com. All reports will be handled with discretion. In your report please include:\n- Your contact information.\n- Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there are additional\nwitnesses, please include them as well. Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public IRC logger), please include a link.\n- Any additional information that may be helpful.\n\nAfter filing a report, a representative of our community will contact you personally, review the incident, follow up with any additional questions, and make a decision as to how to respond. If the person who is harassing you is part of the response team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. If the complaint originates from a member of the response team, it will be handled by a different member of the response team. We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse.\n\n### Removal of Posts\nWe will not review every comment or post, but we reserve the right to remove any that violates these Guidelines or that, in our sole discretion, we otherwise consider objectionable and we may ban offenders from our community.\n\n### Suspension/Termination/Reporting to Authority\nIn certain instances, we may suspend, terminate or ban certain repeat offenders and/or those committing significant violations of these Guidelines. When appropriate, we may also, on our own or as required by the GitHub terms of use, be required to refer and/or work with GitHub and/or the appropriate authorities to review and/or pursue certain violations.\n\n### Attribution & Acknowledgements\nThese Guidelines have been adapted from the [Code of Conduct of the TODO group](http://todogroup.org/opencodeofconduct/). They are subject to revision by American Express and may be revised from time to time.\n\nThank you for your participation!\n"

Very useful for visual regression testing.\n\n## 👩‍💻 Hiring 👨‍💻\n\nWant to get paid for your contributions to `jest-image-snapshot`?\n> Send your resume to oneamex.careers@aexp.com\n\n## 📖 Table of Contents\n\n* [Features](#-features)\n* [Usage](#-usage)\n* [API](#-api)\n* [Contributing](#-contributing)\n\n## ✨ Features\n\n* Take image snapshots of your application\n* Ability to compare snapshots from a baseline\n* Update snapshots when you're good with changes\n* Customize a difference threshold\n* Add a Gaussian blur for noise\n* Adjust the diff layout horizontal vs vertical\n\n### How it works\n\nGiven an image (Buffer instance with PNG image data) the `toMatchImageSnapshot()` matcher will create a `__image_snapshots__` directory in the directory the test is in and will store the baseline snapshot image there on the first run. Note that if `customSnapshotsDir` option is given then it will store baseline snapshot there instead.\n\nOn subsequent test runs the matcher will compare the image being passed against the stored snapshot.\n\nTo update the stored image snapshot run Jest with `--updateSnapshot` or `-u` argument. All this works the same way as [Jest snapshots](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/snapshot-testing.html).\n\n### See it in action\n\nTypically this matcher is used for visual tests that run on a browser. For example let's say I finish working on a feature and want to write a test to prevent visual regressions:\n\n```javascript\n...\nit('renders correctly', async () => {\n  const page = await browser.newPage();\n  await page.goto('https://localhost:3000');\n  const image = await page.screenshot();\n\n  expect(image).toMatchImageSnapshot();\n});\n...\n```\n\n<img title=\"Adding an image snapshot\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/americanexpress/jest-image-snapshot/main/images/create-snapshot.gif\" width=\"50%\">\n\nThen after a few days as I finish adding another feature to my component I notice one of my tests failing!\n\n<img title=\"A failing image snapshot test\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/americanexpress/jest-image-snapshot/main/images/fail-snapshot.gif\" width=\"50%\">\n\nOh no! I must have introduced a regression! Let's see what the diff looks like to identify what I need to fix:\n\n<img title=\"Image diff\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/americanexpress/jest-image-snapshot/main/images/image-diff.png\" width=\"50%\">\n\nAnd now that I know that I broke the card art I can fix it!\n\nThanks `jest-image-snapshot`, that broken header would not have looked good in production!\n\n## 🤹‍ Usage\n\n### Installation\n\n```bash\nnpm i --save-dev jest-image-snapshot\n```\n\nPlease note that `Jest` `>=20 <=29` is a peerDependency. `jest-image-snapshot` will **not** work with anything below Jest 20.x.x\n\n### Invocation\n\n1. Extend Jest's `expect`\n```javascript\n  const { toMatchImageSnapshot } = require('jest-image-snapshot');\n\n  expect.extend({ toMatchImageSnapshot });\n```\n\n2. Use `toMatchImageSnapshot()` in your tests!\n```javascript\n  it('should demonstrate this matcher`s usage', () => {\n    ...\n    expect(image).toMatchImageSnapshot();\n  });\n```\n\nSee [the examples](./examples/README.md) for more detailed usage or read about an example use case in the [American Express Technology Blog](https://americanexpress.io/smile-for-the-camera/)\n\n## 🎛️ API\n\n`toMatchImageSnapshot()` takes an optional options object with the following properties:\n\n* `customDiffConfig`: Custom config passed to [pixelmatch](https://github.com/mapbox/pixelmatch#pixelmatchimg1-img2-output-width-height-options) (See options section) or [ssim.js](https://github.com/obartra/ssim/wiki/Usage#options)\n  * Pixelmatch specific options\n    * By default we have set the `threshold` to 0.01, you can increase that value by passing a customDiffConfig as demonstrated below.\n    * Please note the `threshold` set in the `customDiffConfig` is the per pixel sensitivity threshold. For example with a source pixel colour of `#ffffff` (white) and a comparison pixel colour of `#fcfcfc` (really light grey) if you set the threshold to 0 then it would trigger a failure *on that pixel*. However if you were to use say 0.5 then it wouldn't, the colour difference would need to be much more extreme to trigger a failure on that pixel, say `#000000` (black)\n  * SSIM specific options\n    * By default we set `ssim` to 'bezkrovny'.  It is the fastest option and best option most of the time.  In cases where, higher precision is needed,  this can be set to 'fast'.  See [SSIM Performance Consideration](#ssim-performance-considerations) for a better understanding of how to use this feature.\n* `comparisonMethod`: (default: `pixelmatch`) (options `pixelmatch` or `ssim`) The method by which images are compared.  `pixelmatch` does a pixel by pixel comparison, whereas `ssim` does a structural similarity comparison.  `ssim` is a new experimental feature for jest-image-snapshot, but may become the default comparison method in the future.  For a better understanding of how to use SSIM, see [Recommendations when using SSIM Comparison](#recommendations-when-using-ssim-comparison).\n* `customSnapshotsDir`: A custom absolute path of a directory to keep this snapshot in\n* `customDiffDir`: A custom absolute path of a directory to keep this diff in\n* `storeReceivedOnFailure`: (default: `false`) Store the received images seperately from the composed diff images on failure. This can be useful when updating baseline images from CI.\n* `customReceivedDir`: A custom absolute path of a directory to keep this received image in\n* `customReceivedPostfix`: A custom postfix which is added to the snapshot name of the received image, defaults to `-received`\n* `customSnapshotIdentifier`: A custom name to give this snapshot. If not provided one is computed automatically. When a function is provided it is called with an object containing `testPath`, `currentTestName`, `counter` and `defaultIdentifier` as its first argument. The function must return an identifier to use for the snapshot. If a path is given, the path will be created inside the snapshot/diff directories.\n* `diffDirection`: (default: `horizontal`) (options `horizontal` or `vertical`) Changes diff image layout direction\n* `onlyDiff`: (default: `false`) Either only include the difference between the baseline and the received image in the diff image, or include the 3 images (following the direction set by `diffDirection`).\n* `noColors`: Removes coloring from console output, useful if storing the results in a file\n* `failureThreshold`: (default `0`) Sets the threshold that would trigger a test failure based on the `failureThresholdType` selected. This is different to the `customDiffConfig.threshold` above, that is the per pixel failure threshold, this is the failure threshold for the entire comparison.\n* `failureThresholdType`: (default `pixel`) (options `percent` or `pixel`) Sets the type of threshold that would trigger a failure.\n* `updatePassedSnapshot`: (default `false`) Updates a snapshot even if it passed the threshold against the existing one.\n* `blur`: (default `0`) Applies Gaussian Blur on compared images, accepts radius in pixels as value. Useful when you have noise after scaling images per different resolutions on your target website, usually setting its value to 1-2 should be enough to solve that problem.\n* `runInProcess`: (default `false`) Runs the diff in process without spawning a child process.\n* `dumpDiffToConsole`: (default `false`) Will output base64 string of a diff image to console in case of failed tests (in addition to creating a diff image). This string can be copy-pasted to a browser address string to preview the diff for a failed test.\n* `dumpInlineDiffToConsole`: (default `false`) Will output the image to the terminal using iTerm's [Inline Images Protocol](https://iterm2.com/documentation-images.html). If the term is not compatible, it does the same thing as `dumpDiffToConsole`.\n* `allowSizeMismatch`: (default `false`) If set to true, the build will not fail when the screenshots to compare have different sizes.\n* `maxChildProcessBufferSizeInBytes`: (default `10 * 1024 * 1024`) Sets the max number of bytes for stdout/stderr when running `diff-snapshot` in a child process.\n* `runtimeHooksPath`: (default `undefined`) This needs to be set to a existing file, like `require.resolve('./runtimeHooksPath.cjs')`. This file can expose a few hooks:\n  * `onBeforeWriteToDisc`: before saving any image to the disc, this function will be called (can be used to write EXIF data to images for instance)\n    `onBeforeWriteToDisc: (arguments: { buffer: Buffer; destination: string; testPath: string; currentTestName: string }) => Buffer`\n\n```javascript\nit('should demonstrate this matcher`s usage with a custom pixelmatch config', () => {\n  ...\n  const customConfig = { threshold: 0.5 };\n  expect(image).toMatchImageSnapshot({\n    customDiffConfig: customConfig,\n    customSnapshotIdentifier: 'customSnapshotName',\n    noColors: true\n  });\n});\n```\n\nThe failure threshold can be set in percent, in this case if the difference is over 1%.\n\n```javascript\nit('should fail if there is more than a 1% difference', () => {\n  ...\n  expect(image).toMatchImageSnapshot({\n    failureThreshold: 0.01,\n    failureThresholdType: 'percent'\n  });\n});\n```\n\nCustom defaults can be set with a configurable extension. This will allow for customization of this module's defaults. For example, a 0% default threshold can be shared across all tests with the configuration below:\n\n```javascript\nconst { configureToMatchImageSnapshot } = require('jest-image-snapshot');\n\nconst customConfig = { threshold: 0 };\nconst toMatchImageSnapshot = configureToMatchImageSnapshot({\n  customDiffConfig: customConfig,\n  noColors: true,\n});\nexpect.extend({ toMatchImageSnapshot });\n```\n\n### jest.retryTimes()\nJest supports [automatic retries on test failures](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/jest-object#jestretrytimes). This can be useful for browser screenshot tests which tend to have more frequent false positives. Note that when using jest.retryTimes you'll have to use a unique customSnapshotIdentifier as that's the only way to reliably identify snapshots.\n\n### Removing Outdated Snapshots\n\nUnlike jest-managed snapshots, the images created by `jest-image-snapshot` will not be automatically removed by the `-u` flag if they are no longer needed. You can force `jest-image-snapshot` to remove the files by including the `outdated-snapshot-reporter` in your config and running with the environment variable `JEST_IMAGE_SNAPSHOT_TRACK_OBSOLETE`.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jest\": {\n    \"reporters\": [\n      \"default\",\n      \"jest-image-snapshot/src/outdated-snapshot-reporter.js\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**WARNING: Do not run a *partial* test suite with this flag as it may consider snapshots of tests that weren't run to be obsolete.**\n\n```bash\nexport JEST_IMAGE_SNAPSHOT_TRACK_OBSOLETE=1\njest\n```\n\n### Recommendations when using SSIM comparison\nSince SSIM calculates differences in structural similarity by building a moving 'window' over an images pixels, it does not particularly benefit from pixel count comparisons, especially when you factor in that it has a lot of floating point arithmetic in javascript.  However, SSIM gains two key benefits over pixel by pixel comparison:\n- Reduced false positives (failing tests when the images look the same)\n- Higher sensitivity to actual changes in the image itself.\n\nDocumentation supporting these claims can be found in the many analyses comparing SSIM to Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR).  See [Wang, Z.; Simoncelli, E. P. (September 2008). \"Maximum differentiation (MAD) competition: a methodology for comparing computational models of perceptual quantities\"](https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~z70wang/publications/MAD.pdf) and  Zhang, L.; Zhang, L.; Mou, X.; Zhang, D. (September 2012). A comprehensive evaluation of full reference image quality assessment algorithms. 2012 19th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing. pp. 1477–1480.  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_similarity) also provides many great reference sources describing the topic.\n\nAs such, most users can benefit from setting a 1% or 0.01 threshold for any SSIM comparison. The below code shows a one line modification of the 1% threshold example.\n\n```javascript\nit('should fail if there is more than a 1% difference (ssim)', () => {\n  ...\n  expect(image).toMatchImageSnapshot({\n    comparisonMethod: 'ssim',\n    failureThreshold: 0.01,\n    failureThresholdType: 'percent'\n  });\n});\n```\n### SSIM Performance Considerations\nThe default SSIM comparison method used in the jest-image-snapshot implementation is 'bezkrovny' (as a `customDiffConfig` `{ssim: 'bezkrovny'}`).\nBezkrovny is a special implementation of SSIM that is optimized for speed at a small, almost inconsequential change in accuracy.  It gains this benefit by downsampling (or shrinking the original image) before performing the comparisons.\nThis will provide the best combination of results and performance most of the time.  When the need arises where higher accuracy is desired at the expense of time or a higher quality diff image is needed for debugging,\nthis option can be changed to `{ssim: 'fast'}`. This uses the original SSIM algorithm described in Wang, et al. 2004 on \"Image Quality Assessment: From Error Visibility to Structural Similarity\" (https://github.com/obartra/ssim/blob/master/assets/ssim.pdf) optimized for javascript.\n\nThe following is an example configuration for using `{ssim: 'fast'}` with toMatchImageSnapshot().\n```javascript.\n{\n  comparisonMethod: 'ssim',\n  customDiffConfig: {\n    ssim: 'fast',\n  },\n  failureThreshold: 0.01,\n  failureThresholdType: 'percent'\n}\n```\n\n\n### Recipes\n\n#### Upload diff images from failed tests\n\n[Example Image Upload Test Reporter](examples/image-reporter.js)\n\nIf you are using jest-image-snapshot in an ephemeral environment (like a Continuous Integration server) where the file system does not persist, you might want a way to retrieve those images for diagnostics or historical reference. This example shows how to use a custom [Jest Reporter](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/configuration.html#reporters-array-modulename-modulename-options) that will run after every test, and if there were any images created because they failed the diff test, upload those images to an [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) bucket.\n\nTo enable this image reporter, add it to your `jest.config.js` \"reporters\" definition:\n\n```javascript\n\"reporters\": [ \"default\", \"<rootDir>/image-reporter.js\" ]\n```\n\n#### Usage in TypeScript\n\nIn TypeScript, you can use the [DefinitelyTyped](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/jest-image-snapshot) definition or declare `toMatchImageSnapshot` like the example below:\n\n_Note: This package is not maintained by the `jest-image-snapshot` maintainers so it may be out of date or inaccurate. Because of this, we do not officially support it._\n\n\n```typescript\ndeclare global {\n  namespace jest {\n    interface Matchers<R> {\n      toMatchImageSnapshot(): R\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Ignoring parts of the image snapshot if using [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer)\n\nIf you want to ignore parts of the snapshot (for example some banners or other dynamic blocks) you can find DOM elements with Puppeteer and remove/modify them (setting visibility: hidden on block, if removing it breaks your layout, should help):\n\n```javascript\nasync function removeBanners(page){\n  await page.evaluate(() => {\n    (document.querySelectorAll('.banner') || []).forEach(el => el.remove());\n  });\n}\n\n...\nit('renders correctly', async () => {\n  const page = await browser.newPage();\n  await page.goto('https://localhost:3000');\n\n  await removeBanners(page);\n\n  const image = await page.screenshot();\n\n  expect(image).toMatchImageSnapshot();\n});\n...\n```\n\n## 🏆 Contributing\n\nWe welcome Your interest in the American Express Open Source Community on Github.\nAny Contributor to any Open Source Project managed by the American Express Open\nSource Community must accept and sign an Agreement indicating agreement to the\nterms below.
