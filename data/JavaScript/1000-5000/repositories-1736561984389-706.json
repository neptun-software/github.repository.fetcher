Built with <a href=\"https://github.com/probot/probot\">Probot</a>.</p>\n\n---\n\n## Usage\n\nYou can use the [Release Drafter GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter) in a [GitHub Actions Workflow](https://help.github.com/en/actions/about-github-actions) by configuring a YAML-based workflow file, e.g. `.github/workflows/release-drafter.yml`, with the following:\n\n```yaml\nname: Release Drafter\n\non:\n  push:\n    # branches to consider in the event; optional, defaults to all\n    branches:\n      - master\n  # pull_request event is required only for autolabeler\n  pull_request:\n    # Only following types are handled by the action, but one can default to all as well\n    types: [opened, reopened, synchronize]\n  # pull_request_target event is required for autolabeler to support PRs from forks\n  # pull_request_target:\n  #   types: [opened, reopened, synchronize]\n\npermissions:\n  contents: read\n\njobs:\n  update_release_draft:\n    permissions:\n      # write permission is required to create a github release\n      contents: write\n      # write permission is required for autolabeler\n      # otherwise, read permission is required at least\n      pull-requests: write\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      # (Optional) GitHub Enterprise requires GHE_HOST variable set\n      #- name: Set GHE_HOST\n      #  run: |\n      #    echo \"GHE_HOST=${GITHUB_SERVER_URL##https:\\/\\/}\" >> $GITHUB_ENV\n\n      # Drafts your next Release notes as Pull Requests are merged into \"master\"\n      - uses: release-drafter/release-drafter@v6\n        # (Optional) specify config name to use, relative to .github/. Default: release-drafter.yml\n        # with:\n        #   config-name: my-config.yml\n        #   disable-autolabeler: true\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\nIf you're unable to use GitHub Actions, you can use the Release Drafter GitHub App. Please refer to the [Release Drafter GitHub App documentation](docs/github-app.md) for more information.\n\n## Configuration\n\nOnce you’ve added Release Drafter to your repository, it must be enabled by adding a `.github/release-drafter.yml` configuration file to each repository. The configuration file **must** reside in your default branch, no other configurations will be accepted.\n\n### Example\n\nFor example, take the following `.github/release-drafter.yml` file in a repository:\n\n```yml\ntemplate: |\n  ## What’s Changed\n\n  $CHANGES\n```\n\nAs pull requests are merged, a draft release is kept up-to-date listing the changes, ready to publish when you’re ready:\n\n<img src=\"design/screenshot.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of generated draft release\" width=\"586\" />\n\nThe following is a more complicated configuration, which categorises the changes into headings, and automatically suggests the next version number:\n\n```yml\nname-template: 'v$RESOLVED_VERSION 🌈'\ntag-template: 'v$RESOLVED_VERSION'\ncategories:\n  - title: '🚀 Features'\n    labels:\n      - 'feature'\n      - 'enhancement'\n  - title: '🐛 Bug Fixes'\n    labels:\n      - 'fix'\n      - 'bugfix'\n      - 'bug'\n  - title: '🧰 Maintenance'\n    label: 'chore'\nchange-template: '- $TITLE @$AUTHOR (#$NUMBER)'\nchange-title-escapes: '\\<*_&' # You can add # and @ to disable mentions, and add ` to disable code blocks.\nversion-resolver:\n  major:\n    labels:\n      - 'major'\n  minor:\n    labels:\n      - 'minor'\n  patch:\n    labels:\n      - 'patch'\n  default: patch\ntemplate: |\n  ## Changes\n\n  $CHANGES\n```\n\n## Configuration Options\n\nYou can configure Release Drafter using the following key in your `.github/release-drafter.yml` file:\n\n| Key                        | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| -------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `template`                 | Required | The template for the body of the draft release.

Default: `false`.                                                                            |\n| `include-paths`            | Optional | Restrict pull requests included in the release notes to only the pull requests that modified any of the paths in this array. Supports files and directories. Default: `[]`         |\n\nRelease Drafter also supports [Probot Config](https://github.com/probot/probot-config), if you want to store your configuration files in a central repository. This allows you to share configurations between projects, and create a organization-wide configuration file by creating a repository named `.github` with the file `.github/release-drafter.yml`.\n\n## Template Variables\n\nYou can use any of the following variables in your `template`, `header` and `footer`:\n\n| Variable        | Description                                                                                                           |\n| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `$CHANGES`      | The markdown list of pull requests that have been merged.                                                             |\n| `$CONTRIBUTORS` | A comma separated list of contributors to this release (pull request authors, commit authors, and commit committers). |\n| `$PREVIOUS_TAG` | The previous releases’s tag.                                                                                          |\n| `$REPOSITORY`   | Current Repository                                                                                                    |\n| `$OWNER`        | Current Repository Owner                                                                                              |\n\n## Category Template Variables\n\nYou can use any of the following variables in `category-template`:\n\n| Variable | Description                          |\n| -------- | ------------------------------------ |\n| `$TITLE` | The category title, e.g. `Features`. |\n\n## Next Version Variables\n\nYou can use any of the following variables in your `template`, `header`, `footer`, `name-template` and `tag-template`:\n\n| Variable              | Description                                                                                                                                             |\n| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `$NEXT_PATCH_VERSION` | The next patch version number. For example, if the last tag or release was `v1.2.3`, the value would be `v1.2.4`. This is the most commonly used value. |\n| `$NEXT_MINOR_VERSION` | The next minor version number. For example, if the last tag or release was `v1.2.3`, the value would be `v1.3.0`.                                       |\n| `$NEXT_MAJOR_VERSION` | The next major version number. For example, if the last tag or release was `v1.2.3`, the value would be `v2.0.0`.                                       |\n| `$RESOLVED_VERSION`   | The next resolved version number, based on GitHub labels. Refer to [Version Resolver](#version-resolver) to learn more about this.                      |\n\n## Version Template Variables\n\nYou can use any of the following variables in `version-template` to format the `$NEXT_{PATCH,MINOR,MAJOR}_VERSION` variables:\n\n| Variable    | Description                                                  |\n| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `$PATCH`    | The patch version number.                                    |\n| `$MINOR`    | The minor version number.                                    |\n| `$MAJOR`    | The major version number.                                    |\n| `$COMPLETE` | The complete version string (including any prerelease info). |\n\n## Version Resolver\n\nWith the `version-resolver` option version number incrementing can be resolved automatically based on labels of individual pull requests. Append the following to your `.github/release-drafter.yml` file:\n\n```yml\nversion-resolver:\n  major:\n    labels:\n      - 'major'\n  minor:\n    labels:\n      - 'minor'\n  patch:\n    labels:\n      - 'patch'\n  default: patch\n```\n\nThe above config controls the output of the `$RESOLVED_VERSION` variable.\n\nIf a pull requests is found with the label `major`/`minor`/`patch`, the corresponding version key will be incremented from a semantic version. The maximum out of major, minor and patch found in any of the pull requests will be used to increment the version number. If no pull requests are found with the assigned labels, the `default` will be assigned.\n\n## Change Template Variables\n\nYou can use any of the following variables in `change-template`:\n\n| Variable         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `$NUMBER`        | The number of the pull request, e.g. `42`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| `$TITLE`         | The title of the pull request, e.g. `Add alien technology`. Any characters excluding @ and # matching `change-title-escapes` will be prepended with a backslash so that they will appear verbatim instead of being interpreted as markdown format characters. @s and #s if present in `change-title-escapes` will be appended with an HTML comment so that they don't become mentions. |\n| `$AUTHOR`        | The pull request author’s username, e.g. `gracehopper`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| `$BODY`          | The body of the pull request e.g. `Fixed spelling mistake`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| `$URL`           | The URL of the pull request e.g. `https://github.com/octocat/repo/pull/42`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| `$BASE_REF_NAME` | The base name of of the base Ref associated with the pull request e.g. `master`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| `$HEAD_REF_NAME` | The head name of the head Ref associated with the pull request e.g. `my-bug-fix`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n\n## References\n\n**Note**: This is only revelant for GitHub app users as `references` is ignored when running as GitHub action due to GitHub workflows more powerful [`on` conditions](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#on)\n\nReferences takes an list and accepts strings and regex.\nIf none are specified, we default to the repository’s default branch usually master.\n\n```yaml\nreferences:\n  - master\n  - v.+\n```\n\nCurrently matching against any `ref/heads/` and `ref/tags/` references behind the scene\n\n## Categorize Pull Requests\n\nWith the `categories` option you can categorize pull requests in release notes using labels. For example, append the following to your `.github/release-drafter.yml` file:\n\n```yml\ncategories:\n  - title: '🚀 Features'\n    label: 'feature'\n  - title: '🐛 Bug Fixes'\n    labels:\n      - 'fix'\n      - 'bugfix'\n      - 'bug'\n```\n\nPull requests with the label \"feature\" or \"fix\" will now be grouped together:\n\n<img src=\"design/screenshot-2.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of generated draft release with categories\" width=\"586\" />\n\nAdding such labels to your PRs can be automated by using the embedded Autolabeler functionality (see below),\n[PR Labeler](https://github.com/TimonVS/pr-labeler-action) or [Probot Auto Labeler](https://github.com/probot/autolabeler).\n\nOptionally you can add a `collapse-after` entry to your category item, if the category has more than the defined `collapse-after` pull requests then it will show all pull requests collapsed for that category. Append the `collapse-after` integer to your category as following:\n\n```yml\ncategories:\n  - title: '⬆️ Dependencies'\n    collapse-after: 3\n    labels:\n      - 'dependencies'\n```\n\n## Exclude Pull Requests\n\nWith the `exclude-labels` option you can exclude pull requests from the release notes using labels. For example, append the following to your `.github/release-drafter.yml` file:\n\n```yml\nexclude-labels:\n  - 'skip-changelog'\n```\n\nPull requests with the label \"skip-changelog\" will now be excluded from the release draft.\n\n## Include Pull Requests\n\nWith the `include-labels` option you can specify pull requests from the release notes using labels. Only pull requests that have the configured labels will be included in the pull request. For example, append the following to your `.github/release-drafter.yml` file:\n\n```yml\ninclude-labels:\n  - 'app-foo'\n```\n\nPull requests with the label \"app-foo\" will be the only pull requests included in the release draft.\n\n## Exclude Contributors\n\nBy default, the `$CONTRIBUTORS` variable will contain the names or usernames of all the contributors of a release. The `exclude-contributors` option allows you to remove certain usernames from that list. This can be useful if don't wish to include yourself, to better highlight only the third-party contributions.\n\n```yml\nexclude-contributors:\n  - 'myusername'\n```\n\n## Replacers\n\nYou can search and replace content in the generated changelog body, using regular expressions, with the `replacers` option. Each replacer is applied in order.\n\n```yml\nreplacers:\n  - search: '/CVE-(\\d{4})-(\\d+)/g'\n    replace: 'https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-$1-$2'\n  - search: 'myname'\n    replace: 'My Name'\n```\n\n## Autolabeler\n\nYou can add automatically a label into a pull request, with the `autolabeler` option. Available matchers are `files` (glob), `branch` (regex), `title` (regex) and `body` (regex).\nMatchers are evaluated independently; the label will be set if at least one of the matchers meets the criteria.\n\n```yml\nautolabeler:\n  - label: 'chore'\n    files:\n      - '*.md'\n    branch:\n      - '/docs{0,1}\\/.+/'\n  - label: 'bug'\n    branch:\n      - '/fix\\/.+/'\n    title:\n      - '/fix/i'\n  - label: 'enhancement'\n    branch:\n      - '/feature\\/.+/'\n    body:\n      - '/JIRA-[0-9]{1,4}/'\n```\n\n## Prerelease increment\n\nWhen creating prerelease (`prerelease: true`), you can add a prerelease identifier to increment the prerelease version number, with the `prerelease-identifier` option. It accept any string, but it's recommended to use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) prerelease identifiers (alpha, beta, rc, etc).\n\nUsing `prerelease-identifier` automatically enable `include-prereleases`.\n\n```yml\nprerelease-identifier: 'alpha' # will create a prerelease with version number x.x.x-alpha.x\n```\n\n## Projects that don't use Semantic Versioning\n\nIf your project doesn't follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) you can still use Release Drafter, but you may want to set the `version-template` option to customize how the `$NEXT_{PATCH,MINOR,MAJOR}_VERSION` environment variables are generated.\n\nFor example, if your project doesn't use patch version numbers, you can set `version-template` to `$MAJOR.$MINOR`. If the current release is version 1.0, then `$NEXT_MINOR_VERSION` will be `1.1`.\n\n## Action Inputs\n\nThe Release Drafter GitHub Action accepts a number of optional inputs directly in your workflow configuration. These will typically override default behavior specified in your `release-drafter.yml` config.\n\n| Input                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| `config-name`           | If your workflow requires multiple release-drafter configs it be helpful to override the config-name. The config should still be located inside `.github` as that's where we are looking for config files.                                                                                                                                                         |\n| `name`                  | The name that will be used in the GitHub release that's created or updated. This will override any `name-template` specified in your `release-drafter.yml` if defined.                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| `tag`                   | The tag name to be associated with the GitHub release that's created or updated. This will override any `tag-template` specified in your `release-drafter.yml` if defined.                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| `version`               | The version to be associated with the GitHub release that's created or updated. This will override any version calculated by the release-drafter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| `publish`               | A boolean indicating whether the release being created or updated should be immediately published. This may be useful if the output of a previous workflow step determines that a new version of your project has been (or will be) released, as with [`salsify/action-detect-and-tag-new-version`](https://github.com/salsify/action-detect-and-tag-new-version). |\n| `prerelease`            | A boolean indicating whether the release being created or

Action`](https://www.github.com/actions/upload-release-asset). |\n\n## Developing\n\nIf you have Node v10+ installed locally, you can run the tests, and a local app, using the following commands:\n\n```sh\n# Install dependencies\nyarn install\n\n# Run the tests\nyarn test\n\n# Run the app locally\nyarn test:watch\n```\n\nOnce you've started the app, visit `localhost:3000` and you'll get [step-by-step instructions](https://probot.github.io/docs/development/#configuring-a-github-app) for installing it in your GitHub account so you can start pushing commits and testing it locally.\n\nIf you don’t have Node installed, you can use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/):\n\n```sh\n# Run the tests\ndocker compose run --rm app\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nThird-party contributions are welcome! 🙏🏼 See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for step-by-step instructions.\n\nIf you need help or have a question, let me know via a GitHub issue.\n\n## Deployment\n\nIf you want to deploy your own copy of Release Drafter, follow the [Probot Deployment Guide](https://probot.github.io/docs/deployment/).\n\n## Releasing\n\nRun the following command:\n\n```bash\ngit checkout master && git pull && npm version [major | minor | patch]\n```\n\nThe command does the following:\n\n- Ensures you’re on master and don’t have local, un-commited changes\n- Bumps the version number in [package.json](package.json) based on major, minor or patch\n- Runs the `postversion` npm script in [package.json](package.json), which:\n  - Runs test\n  - Pushes the tag to GitHub, which triggers GitHub Action that does the following:\n    - Releases NPM\n    - Publish the Release Draft!\n"
