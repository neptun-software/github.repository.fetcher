          "content": "# Code of Conduct\n\n## 1. Purpose\n\nA primary goal of Phenomic is to be inclusive to the largest number of\ncontributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we\nare committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all,\nregardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic\nstatus, and religion (or lack thereof).\n\nThis code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in\nour community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.\n\nWe invite all those who participate in Phenomic to help us create safe and\npositive experiences for everyone.\n\n## 2. Open Source Citizenship\n\nA supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open source\ncitizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the\nrelationships between our actions and their effects on our community.\n\nCommunities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is\nessential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that\nexist in society.\n\nIf you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is\nwelcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the\nfullest extent, we want to know.\n\n## 3. Expected Behavior\n\nThe following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:\n\n- Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the\n  health and longevity of this community.\n- Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.\n- Attempt collaboration before conflict.\n- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.\n- Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert\n  community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or\n  violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.\n- Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public;\n  please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.\n\n## 4. Unacceptable Behavior\n\nThe following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within\nour community:\n\n- Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another\n  person.\n- Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory\n  jokes and language.\n- Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.\n- Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying\n  information (\"doxing\").\n- Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation,\n  race, religion, or disability.\n- Inappropriate photography or recording.\n- Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone’s consent before\n  touching them.\n- Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes;\n  inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.\n- Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).\n- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.\n- Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.\n\n## 5. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior\n\nUnacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those\nwith decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.\n\nAnyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.\n\nIf a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers\nmay take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban\nor permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in\nthe case of a paid event).\n\n## 6. Reporting Guidelines\n\nIf you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other\nconcerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible.\ncontact@phenomic.io.\n\nAdditionally, community organizers are available to help community members\nengage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing\nunacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers\nwill also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.\n\n## 7. Addressing Grievances\n\nIf you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of\nConduct, you should notify Phenomic with a concise description of your\ngrievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing\ngoverning policies.\n\n## 8. Scope\n\nWe expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors;\nand other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community\nvenues–online and in-person–as well as in all one-on-one communications\npertaining to community business.\n\nThis code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable\nbehavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior\nhas the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community\nmembers.\n\n## 9.

Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`. A guide on how to fork a\n   repository: https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/\n\n   Open your terminal (e.g. Terminal, Git Bash or Git Shell) and type:\n\n   ```sh\n   git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/phenomic\n   cd phenomic\n   git checkout -b my_branch\n   ```\n\n   Note: Replace `<your_username>` with your GitHub username\n\n2. Phenomic uses [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for running development scripts.\n   If you haven't already done so, please\n   [install yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).\n\n   To check your version of Yarn and ensure it's installed you can type:\n\n   ```sh\n   yarn --version\n   ```\n\n   ⚠️ **We currently require yarn >= v1.0.0**\n\n3. Run `yarn`. This will install all dependencies and prepare the repository to\n   be ready for serious shit.\n\n   ```sh\n   yarn\n   ```\n\n4. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.\n\n5. If you've added/changed APIs, update the documentation accordingly.\n\n6. Ensure the entire test suite passes via `yarn test`.\n\n#### Additional Workflow for any changes made to website or docs\n\nIf you are making changes to the website or documentation, test the `website`\nfolder and run the server to check if your changes are being displayed\naccurately.\n\nYou can run a development server to check if the changes you made are being\ndisplayed accurately by running `yarn website:start`.\n\nYou can modify `website/*` code and get real times update in your browser.\n\n**Keep in mind that whenever you modify Phenomic core/plugins you might need to\nrestart the dev server.** If you are doing change to Phenomic using the website\nas a playground, you may need to transpile sources. See below for more\ninformations.\n\n## How to try a development build of Phenomic in another project\n\n### Transpiling sources\n\nPhenomic is written with ES2015+ and is using [babel](http://babeljs.io) for\ntranspilation. In order to have up to date code for real world usage, you need\nto start a watcher from the root of the project\n\n```console\nyarn watch\n```\n\nThis will update transpilated files as soon as you modify one.\n\n### Use a local Phenomic version your own project\n\nFrom Phenomic git repo\n\n```console\nyarn links\n```\n\nThis should create local links for each packages.\n\nThen, in your project:\n\n```console\nyarn link @phenomic/core @phenomic/preset-react-app ...\n```\n\n**You should probably add all others direct `@phenomic/*` deps from your\n`package.json` if necessary.**\n\nThen run your project via `yarn start`, and don't forget to restart dev server\nif necessary (if you change the code of Phenomic itself).\n\n---\n\n## Bugs\n\n### Where to Find Known Issues\n\nWe are using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/phenomic/phenomic/issues) for\nour public bugs. We will keep a close eye on this and try to make it clear when\nwe have a work in progress. **Before filing a new issue, try to make sure your\nproblem doesn't already exist.**\n\n### Reporting New Issues\n\nThe best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a reduced test case. Please\nprovide a public repository with a runnable example. Then feel free to\n[open an issue](https://github.com/phenomic/phenomic/issues/new).\n\n#### Security Bugs\n\nIf you find a security issue, please first contact us directly before opening a\npublic issue.\n\n---\n\n## Releasing\n\nUpdate necessary `bsconfig.json` (eg: `packages/reason/bsconfig.json`) version\nnumber and stage the file in git (so release script gets it).\n\n```\nyarn release\n```\n\nThe command will guide you.\n\nOnce it's done, go to https://github.com/phenomic/phenomic/releases. Click on\nthe new created tag and `Edit tag` to create release notes.\n\nThe way to create notes is easy. Just go to\nhttps://github.com/phenomic/phenomic/commits/master and sort interesting commits\n(since last release) in the template below that you will use as notes:\n\n```\n# 🎉 No breaking changes 🎉\nor\n# 💥 Includes _Breaking changes_\n\nBlah blah\n\n## 💥 Breaking changes\n\n* [`@phenomic/PLUGIN_NAMEEEE`: AWESOME_MESSAGE](https://github.com/phenomic/phenomic/commit/HASSSSHHHHHHHHHHH),\n  by @DOERRRRR, reported|requested by @REPORTERRRRR (in [#XXXXXXX](https://github.com/phenomic/phenomic/issues/XXXXXXX))\n\n\n## 🐛 Bugfixes\n\n...\n\n##  👍 Improvements\n\n...\n\n## 🔥 New plugins\n\n...\n\n## ✨ New features\n\n...\n\n## 🌟 New Examples\n\n...\n```\n\n---\n\n## How to Get in Touch\n\n- Chat - [#phenomic](https://gitter.im/phenomic/phenomic) on Gitter.\n- Email - contact (at) phenomic (dot) io\n\n## Code Conventions\n\n- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) is used to avoid bikeshedding on quotes or\n  semicolons.\n- [Eslint](http://eslint.org) is used to help to keep the codebase clean, with a\n  [strong config](https://github.com/MoOx/eslint-config-i-am-meticulous).\n- Prefer ES6 syntax when possible.\n- Use [Flow types](http://flowtype.org/).\n\n## License\n\nBy contributing to Phenomic, you agree that your contributions will be licensed\nunder its MIT license.\n"
