          "content": "# Course Material and FAQ for the Ultimate React Course\n\nThis branch of the repo contains starter files and final code for all sections and projects of the course, **exactly as shown in the videos**.\n\nUse starter code to start each section, and **final code to compare it with your own code whenever something doesn't work**!\n\nðŸš¨ **_Please read the following Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) carefully before starting the course_** ðŸš¨\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Q1: How do I download the files?\n\n**A:** If you just want to download the entire code, click the green button saying \"Code\", and then choose the \"Download ZIP\" option. If you can't see the button (on mobile), use [this link](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/ultimate-react-course/archive/main.zip) instead.\n\n### Q2: I'm stuck! Where do I get help?\n\n**A:** Have you tried to fix the problem on your own? **Have you compared your code with the final code?** Are you using the library versions as indicated in the course videos? If you failed fixing your problem, please **post a detailed description of the problem to the Q&A area of that video over at Udemy**, along with a link to a [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) containing your code.\n\n### Q3: Can I see a final version of the course projects?\n\n**A:** Sure! Here you go:\n\n- [Pizza Menu](https://fast-react-pizza-menu.netlify.app/) (Components, props, JSX)\n- [Travel List](https://travel-list-jonas.netlify.app/) (useState and state management)\n- [Eat-n-split](https://eat-n-split.netlify.app/) (Practice project)\n- [usePopcorn](https://usepopcorn.netlify.app) (useEffect, data fetching, custom hooks)\n- [Classy weather](https://classy-weather.netlify.app/) (Class components)\n- [Quiz App](https://the-react-quiz.netlify.app/) (useReducer)\n- [WorldWise](https://worldwise-jonas.netlify.app/) (React Router, context API, memo, useMemo, useCallback)\n- [Fast React Pizza](https://fast-react-pizza.netlify.app/) (React Router data loading, Redux, Redux Toolkit, thunks, Tailwind CSS)\n- [The Wild Oasis](https://the-wild-oasis.vercel.app) (React Query, Styled Components, React Hook Form, Supabase, advanced compound component pattern, authentication, charts, dark mode, professional application planning and development)\n- [The Wild Oasis Website](https://the-wild-oasis-website.vercel.app/) (Next.js \"app\" router, React Server Components, server actions, authentication with NextAuth)\n\n### Q4: What VSCode theme are you using?\n\n**A:** I use [One Monokai](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=azemoh.one-monokai) in this course. For the icons, I'm using [Material Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme).\n\n### Q5: Videos don't load, can you fix it?\n\n**A:** Unfortunately, there is nothing I can do about it. The course is hosted on Udemy, and sometimes they have technical issues. Please just come back a bit later or [contact their support team](https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us).\n\n### Q6: Videos are blurred / have low quality, can you fix it?\n\n**A:** Please open video settings and change the quality from 'Auto' to another value, for example 720p. If that doesn't help, please [contact the Udemy support team](https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us).\n\n### Q7: Are videos downloadable?\n\n**A:** Videos used to be downloadable, but unfortunately, Udemy has disabled video downloads on all my courses in order to fight piracy. There is nothing I can do about this.\n\n### Q8: I want to put these projects in my portfolio. Is that allowed?\n\n**A:** Absolutely! Just make sure you actually built them yourself by following the course, and that you understand what you did. What is **not allowed** is that you create your own course/videos/articles based on this course's content!\n\n### Q9: I love your courses and want to get updates on new ones. How?\n\n**A:** First, you can subscribe to my email list [at my website](http://codingheroes.io/resources). Plus, I make important announcements on twitter [@jonasschmedtman](https://twitter.com/jonasschmedtman), so you should definitely follow me there ðŸ”¥\n\n### Q10: How do I get my certificate of completion?\n\n**A:** A certificate of completion is provided by Udemy after you complete 100% of the course. After completing the course, just click on the \"Your progress\" indicator in the top right-hand corner of the course page. If you want to change your name on the certificate, please [contact the Udemy support team](https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us).\n\n### Q11: Can you add subtitles in my language?\n\n**A:** No. I provide professional English captions, but Udemy is responsible for subtitles in all other languages (automatic translations). So please [contact the Udemy support team](https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us) to request your own language.\n\n### Q12: Do you accept pull requests?\n\n**A:** No, because this repository should contain the _exact_ same code that is shown in the videos. _However, feel free to add an issue if you found one._\n"
