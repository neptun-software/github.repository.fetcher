          "content": "## Contributing\n\nWelcome to the Shout community, it's great to have you here! We thank you in\nadvance for your contributions.\n\n### I have a question\n\nFind us on the #shout-irc channel. You might not get an answer right away, but\nthis channel is filled with nice people who will be happy to help you.\n\n### I want to report a bug\n\nFirst of all, look at the\n[open issues](https://github.com/erming/shout/issues) and [closed\nissues](https://github.com/erming/shout/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)\nto see if this was not alredy discussed before.\n\n### I want to contribute to the code\n\nA good starting point if you want to help us but do not have a clear idea of\nwhat you can do specifically is to\nlook at the open issues labeled as [*quick and\neasy*](https://github.com/erming/shout/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug+label%3A%22quick+and+easy%22)\nor [*help\nwanted*](https://github.com/erming/shout/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).\n\nWhen you submit some code, make sure it respects the overall coding style that\nis currently in place. If you do not, our reviewers will surely let you know you\nshould :smile: (that is, until an automated checker takes over the yelling).\n\nAlso, make sure that your PRs do not contain unnecessary commits. If you think\nsome of your commits should be merged into a single one, feel free to [squash\nthem](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History).\n\nPlease [rebase](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing) outdated\nPRs on master to help with the reviews (rebasing is preferred over merging to\nkeep a clean history in a branch/PR).\n\nAdditionally, give extra care to your commit messages, as they will help us\nreview your PRs as well as help other contributors in the future, when exploring\nthe history. The general rules are to [use the imperative present\ntense](https://git-scm.com/book/ch5-2.html#Commit-Guidelines), to start with a\nsingle concise line, followed by a blank line and a more detailed explanation\nwhen necessary. Tim Pope wrote an [excellent\narticle](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)\non how one should format their commit messages.\n\nWhen you send a PR, expect two different reviews from the [project\nmaintainers](https://github.com/erming/shout/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#project-maintainers).\nIf necessary, they will make comments and ask for changes. When everything looks\ngood to them, they will both express their consent by commenting your PR with a\n:+1:. Typically, the first reviewer will give a thorough report and exchange\nwith you, give his :+1:, then ask the second reviewer to confirm the changes.\nWhen this happens (when you get your second required :+1:), then your PR can be\nmerged.\n\nPlease document any relevant changes in the shout documentation that can be\nfound [in its own repository](https://github.com/erming/shout-website).\n\n### Labels\n\nWhen you open an [issue](https://github.com/erming/shout/issues) or send us a\n[PR](https://github.com/erming/shout/pulls), it will most likely be given one or\nseveral labels. Here is what they mean:\n\n- **bug**: Issues that report and PRs that solve any defects that cause\n  unexpected behaviors.\n- **documentation**: Tickets that mention a lack of documentation, suggest their\n  improvement, or PRs that address these.\n- **duplicate**: Tickets already solved in the past or already open. Such\n  tickets should always link to the previous one on the subject.\n- **enhancement**: Tickets that describe a desired feature or PRs that add them\n  to the project.\n- **help wanted**: Tickets that we would like the community to help us with, by\n  either answering questions or send us PRs.\n- **priority**: Tickets that the core team deemed critical and PRs that the core\n  team should look at before others.\n- **question**: Tickets that are actually support cases.\n- **quick and easy**: Tickets that should be fairly simple to implement, even\n  for developers not yet involved in the project.\n- **second review needed**: A first reviewer gave his :+1: but now expects a\n  second reviewer to step in before this PR can be merged.\n- **security**: Tickets that describe a security concern or PRs that must be\n  reviewed with extra care regarding security.\n- **wontfix**: Tickets that, after discussion and explanation, will not be fixed\n  or implemented.\n\n### Project maintainers\n\n- [Mattias Erming](https://github.com/erming) (`erming` on IRC)\n- [Jocelyn Delalande](https://github.com/JocelynDelalande) (`JocelynD` on IRC)\n- [Jérémie Astori](https://github.com/astorije) (`astorije` on IRC)\n- [Paul Friederichsen](https://github.com/floogulinc) (`floogulinc` on IRC)\n"
