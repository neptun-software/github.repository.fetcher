          "content": "# LittleJS FAQ\n\nWelcome to the LittleJS FAQ!\nThis document addresses common questions and issues to help developers get started and troubleshoot their projects.\nIf you don’t find an answer here, feel free to ask the community or check the documentation.\n\n---\n\n## Getting Started\n### What is LittleJS, and how is it different from other JavaScript game engines?\n\nLittleJS is a lightweight, high-performance JavaScript game engine designed for simplicity and speed.\nIt offers a hybrid rendering system that combines the advantages of WebGL and 2D Canvas.\nUnlike larger, feature-heavy engines, LittleJS focuses on 2D games and providing a comprehensive set of simple, easy to use features.\nLittleJS is perfect for developers who want a minimal yet powerful engine to bring their 2D game ideas to life without the complexity of larger frameworks.\n\n### How do I set up a basic LittleJS project?\n\nDownload the LittleJS repository via GitHub or npm.\nInclude one of the LittleJS builds from the dist folder.\nSeveral examples are included for you to build on.\nThe most basic example is just an empty project.\n\n[Empty Example HTML file:](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS/blob/main/examples/empty/index.html)\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html><head>\n<title>LittleJS Hello World Demo</title>\n<meta charset=utf-8>\n</head><body>\n\n<script src=../../dist/littlejs.js></script>\n<script src=game.js></script>\n```\n\n[Empty Example JavaScript file:](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS/blob/main/examples/empty/game.js)\n```javascript\n/*\n    Little JS Hello World Demo\n    - Just prints \"Hello World!\"\n    - A good starting point for new projects\n*/\n\n'use strict';\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\nfunction gameInit()\n{\n    // called once after the engine starts up\n    // setup the game\n}\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\nfunction gameUpdate()\n{\n    // called every frame at 60 frames per second\n    // handle input and update the game state\n}\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\nfunction gameUpdatePost()\n{\n    // called after physics and objects are updated\n    // setup camera and prepare for render\n}\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\nfunction gameRender()\n{\n    // called before objects are rendered\n    // draw any background effects that appear behind objects\n}\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\nfunction gameRenderPost()\n{\n    // called after objects are rendered\n    // draw effects or hud that appear above all objects\n    drawTextScreen('Hello World!', mainCanvasSize.scale(.5), 80);\n}\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n// Startup LittleJS Engine\nengineInit(gameInit, gameUpdate, gameUpdatePost, gameRender, gameRenderPost, ['tiles.png']);\n```\n\n### Why do I see a blank screen when I run my game?\n\nIf you are seeing a blank screen, first try opening the dev tools console (F12 in most browsers).\nThis will show you any errors that occur and allows stepping through code to help debug.\nA common issue is the image data failing to load with a message like \"The image element contains cross-origin data, and may not be loaded.\"\nThis is probably because the game was loaded directly without using a web server!\n\n### Do I need a local server to run LittleJS games, and how do I set one up?\n\nYes, this is a necessary step because web browsers just have protection from loading local files which includes images.\nSo any JavaScript projects that load images like games must be opened from a local web server.\nDon't panic though, it's very easy to fix! \n\nIf you are using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) there is a [Live Preview Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server) that will handle this for you automatically.\n\nAnother option is to setup a simple local web server like [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) via npm.\n\n---\n\n## Graphics and Sound\n\n### How do I load and add images to my game?\n\nFirst you need to load an image file. For LittleJS this is typically done on startup via a parameter to engineInt that is a list of images to load. The engine will ensure that the images are all loaded before starting. Each source image can be up to 4096x4096 in size so most games only need one texture, though it's possible to load as many as you need.\n\n```javascript\nengineInit(gameInit, gameUpdate, gameUpdatePost, gameRender, gameRenderPost, ['tiles.png']);\n```\n\nLittleJS works best when your tile sheet is broken up into grids of tiles because the rendering system can be batched up. To draw a tile from a source image you can call drawTile and pass in TileInfo object. Another common approach is to create an EngineObject and set it's tileInfo, it will automatically be rendered.\n\n```javascript\ndrawTile(vec2(21,5), vec2(4.5), tile(3,128));\n```\n\n### What is the tile function and how do tile indexes work?\n\nThe tile function is a very useful function that takes a tile index and size and returns a TileInfo object which can be passed to functions like drawTile. It works by accepting using the tileIndex multiplied by the tileSize to get the coordinates for the TileInfo. It's also possible to pass in padding for sheets that are set up for it.\n\n### Can I add and switch between multiple sprites for a game object?\n\nYou can set the object's tileInfo to a new sprite, or just call drawTile directly with any sprite.\n\n```javascript \nthis.tileInfo = tile(3, 32);\n```\n\n### There are thin lines around my sprites sometimes, how can I fix that?\n\nThat is called tile bleeding, it happens when pixels from one tile blend into another neighboring tile. There are two approaches supported by LittleJs to fix the problem:\n- Use tileFixBleedScale which shrinks tiles by a number of pixels. A very small value of around .1 or less can often fix the problem without noticeable issues.\n- Create the sprite sheet with extra space around each tile. This can be done by adding a 1 pixel layer of padding around each sprite.\n\n### How do I handle animations in LittleJS?\n\nYou can use the TileInfo.frame function passing in the number of animation frames to offset the sprite.\nIt sounds kind of weird at first but imagine your sprites are all aligned on a grid with frames of animations being next to eachother.\nThis allows easily indexing into those animations from the base sprite location.\nFor example to animate the player sprite you might do something like this...\n\n```javascript \nthis.tileInfo = spriteAtlas.player.frame(animationFrame);\n```\n\n### How can I fix thin rows of pixels bleeding in the sides of some sprites from neighboring tiles?\n\nPixel bleeding can occur when rendering tiles from a spritesheet due to sub-pixel inaccuracies or texture sampling issues. There are two effective ways to resolve this:\n\n1. Use tileFixBleedScale, which works by shrinking all tiles slightly. Start by setting tileFixBleedScale to .5, this should eliminate the issue.\n\n2. Add padding to the spritesheet by modifying it so each tile has 1 pixel of padding around it. Use the padding setting in the tile function to account for the padding when creating your tiles.\n\n### How do I control the camera in LittleJS?\n\nLittleJS uses a world space rendering system, so objects can move independently of the camera.\nThe camera is easy to control using cameraPosition and cameraScale, which indicate the world space position and how many pixels is equivalent to one world unit.\nThe default cameraScale is 32 while the default cameraPosition is just the origin.\nIt is also possible to draw using screen space pixel coordinates by passing in true as the screenSpace parameter to most drawing functions.\n\n```javascript\nsetCameraPos(vec2(22,5)); // move camera to world position (20,5)\nsetCameraScale(20);  // zoom camera to 20 pixels per world unit\n```\n\n### How do I play sounds in LittleJS?\n\nSounds can either be generated on startup using ZzFX or loaded from a wave or mp3 file.\n[ZzFX sounds can be created using the sound designer app.](https://killedbyapixel.github.io/ZzFX/)\nOnce loaded sounds can be played by calling Sound.play with some parameters to control how it is played.\n\n```javascript\nconst sound_click = new Sound([1,.5]); // create a ZzFX sound\nconst sound_jump = new SoundWave('jump.mp3'); // load an mp3 sound\nsound_click.play(pos, volume, pitch); // play a sound\n```\n\n### If I load several images, how do I control which is used?\n\nThere is just an optional parameter you can pass to the tile function or to TileInfo called textureIndex. It defaults to 0 so if you only have one texture, you may not have noticed it. If you set to another number will select another texture in list. Something to keep in mind for large games is that changing the target texture will require WebGL to flush the render batch which can cause slowdown if it is done many times per frame.\n\n```javascript\nfunction tile(pos=vec2(), size=tileSizeDefault, textureIndex=0, padding=0)\n```\n\n### How can I check if an object is on screen?\n\nYou can use the isOverlapping function to check the object against the camera. For culling you maybe want to enlarge the object size slightly to account for attached objects or rotation, I usually do this.size.scale(2).\n\n```javascript\nif (!isOverlapping(this.pos, this.size, cameraPos, renderWindowSize))\n    return;\n```\n\n---\n\n## Gameplay and Programming\n\n### How do I add keyboard or mouse input to my game?\n\nLittleJS provides input handling functions for keyboard, mouse, and gamepads. Touch input is also routed to the mouse. There are functions for isDown, wasPressed, and wasReleased. Input can only be checked during the update and should not be called from render functions.\n\n```javascript\nif (keyIsDown(37)) // Left arrow key\n   obj.x -= 5;\nif (mouseWasReleased(0)) // Left mouse button\n   console.log('Mouse clicked at:', mousePos);\nif (gamepadWasPressed(0)) // Gamepad button 0\n   console.log('Gamepad pressed, stick is:', gamepadStick(0));\n```\n\n### How do I create and update game objects?\n\nLittleJS can be used as an object oriented system by extending the base class [EngineObject](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS/blob/main/src/engineObject.js) with your own. This lightweight class provides many useful features including physics, collision, parent/child system, and sorted rendering. These objects are added to the global list of objects where they will automatically be updated and rendered until destroyed.\n\nHere is a template you can use to make objects that behave however you want. See the examples for a complete demonstration.\n\n```javascript\nclass MyObject extends EngineObject \n{\n    constructor(pos, size, tileInfo)\n    {\n        super(pos, size, tileInfo);\n        // setup object\n    }\n\n    update()\n    {\n        // update object physics and position\n        super.update(); \n    }\n\n    render()\n    {\n        // draw object as a sprite\n        super.render();\n    }\n}\n\n// spawn one of those objects\nconst object = new MyObject(pos, size, tileInfo);\n```\n\n### How can I load a 2D level map?\n\nThere are two parts that work together to make 2D level maps in LittleJS.\nThe tileCollision system is an array of values that correspond to each tile in the map.\nThe built in physics system can resolve collisions against this tile map very quickly.\nFor the visual side of things, there is a class called TileLayer which can be used in conjunction with tileCollision.\nThe TileLayer system works by pre-rendering the entire level to a texture so it can be drawn extremely fast each frame.\nIt is also possible to have multiple TileLayers for foreground and background layers.\n[The platformer example shows a basic example of how to load data that was exported from an external editor.](https://killedbyapixel.github.io/LittleJS/examples/platformer/)\n\n### Can I use physics with LittleJS?\n\nYes! LittleJS comes with a robust game physics system included and [also a plugin using Box2D.](https://killedbyapixel.github.io/LittleJS/examples/box2d/)\nThe platformer example includes a character object class that can be used as a starting point for advanced platforming physics.\n\n### How do I add particle effects to my game?\n\n[There is a particle system designer that is useful for experimenting with particle designs.](https://killedbyapixel.github.io/LittleJS/examples/particles/)\n\nYou can create a particle system in code using the ParticleEmitter object.\n\n```javascript\n// fire particle system\nnew ParticleEmitter(\n    pos, 0,                         // pos, angle\n    1, .1, 100, PI,                 // emitSize, emitTime, emitRate, emiteCone\n    0,                              // tileInfo\n    rgb(1,.5,.1), rgb(1,.1,.1),     // colorStartA, colorStartB\n    rgb(1,.5,.1,0), rgb(1,.1,.1,0), // colorEndA, colorEndB\n    .7, .8, .2, .2, .05,  // time, sizeStart, sizeEnd, speed, angleSpeed\n    .9, 1, -.2, PI, .05,  // damp, angleDamp, gravity, particleCone, fade\n    .5, 0, 1, 0, 1e9      // randomness, collide, additive, colorLinear, renderOrder\n);\n```\n\n---\n\n## Debugging and Development\n\n### How do I debug my game in LittleJS?\n\nPress the Esc key to show the debug menu. From here there are several options that can be accessed via the number keys.\n\nYou can also press + or - to adjust game speed to help with debugging, or just for fun!\n\n---\n\n## Contribute to the FAQ\nIf you have additional questions or think something should be added to this FAQ, please open an issue or pull request on the [LittleJS GitHub repository](https://github.com/FrankForce/LittleJS).\n\n---\n\nHappy coding with LittleJS! 🎮🚂💨\n"

object list\n- Will be updated and rendered each frame\n- Renders as a sprite from a tile sheet by default\n- Can have color and addtive color applied\n- 2D Physics and collision system\n- Sorted by renderOrder before drawing\n- Objects can have children in local space\n- Parents are updated before children\n- Call destroy() to get rid of objects\n\n```javascript\n// Engine

rendering\n- Unlimited numbers of layers, allocates canvases as needed\n- Interfaces with EngineObject for collision\n- Collision layer is separate from visible layers\n- It is recommended to have a visible layer that matches the collision\n- Tile layers can be drawn to using their context with Canvas2d\n- Drawn directly to the main canvas without using WebGL\n\n```javascript\n// Tile Collision System\ntileCollisionSize                              // Size of the tile collision layer\ninitTileCollision(size)                        // Clear and initialize tile collision\nsetTileCollisionData(pos, data=0)              // Set tile collision data at pos\ngetTileCollisionData(pos)                      // Get tile collision data at pos\ntileCollisionTest(pos, size=(0,0), object)     // Check if collision should occur\ntileCollisionRaycast(posStart, posEnd, object) // Return the center of tile if hit\n\n// Tile Layer Object\nTileLayer(position, size, tileInfo, scale)     // Create a tile layer object\nTileLayer.setData(layerPos, data, redraw)      // Set data at position\nTileLayer.getData(layerPos)                    // Get data at position\nTileLayer.redraw()                             // Draw to an offscreen canvas\nTileLayer.drawTileData(layerPos, clear=true)   // Draw the tile\nTileLayer.drawRect(pos, size, color, angle)    // Draw a rectangle to 2D canvas\nTileLayer.drawTile(pos, size=(1,1), tileInfo, color, angle, mirror) // Draw tile\nTileLayer.drawCanvas2D(pos, size, angle, mirror, drawFunction)      // Draw to 2D canvas\n\n// Tile Layer Data Object\nTileLayerData(tile, direction=0, mirror=false, color=(1,1,1,1)) // Create tile data object\nTileLayerData.clear()      // Clear this tile data\n\n// Tile sheet settings\ntileSizeDefault = (16,16)  // Default size of tiles in pixels\ntileFixBleedScale = .3     // How much smaller to draw tiles to prevent bleeding\n```\n\n## LittleJS Particle System\n- Simple kinematic particle system with many parameters\n- [Particle Effect Designer](https://killedbyapixel.github.io/LittleJS/examples/particles) - Editor for creating LittleJS Particle Systems\n\n```javascript\n// Particle Emitter Object\nParticleEmitter(position, angle, ...settings) // Create a particle system\nParticleEmitter.emitParticle()                // Spawn one particle\n\n// Particle Settings\nparticleEmitRateScale = 1 // Scales particles emit rate\n```\n\n## LittleJS Debugging System\n- Press Escape key to toggle debug overlay\n- Number keys toggle debug functions\n- +/- keys apply time scale to update\n- Debug primitive rendering system\n- Debug functions are only active in debug builds\n\n```javascript\nASSERT(assert, output) // Asserts if the expression is false\ndebugRect(pos, size, color='#fff', time=0, angle=0, fill)   // Draw debug rectangle\ndebugCircle(pos, radius, color='#fff', time=0, fill)        // Draw debug circle\ndebugPoint(pos, color, time, angle)                         // Draw debug point\ndebugLine(posA, posB, color, thickness=.1, time)            // Draw debug line\ndebugText(text, pos, size=1, color='#fff', time=0, angle=0) // Draw debug text\ndebugAABB(pA, sA, pB, sB, color)     // Draw a debug axis aligned box\ndebugClear()                         // Clear all debug primitives\ndebugSaveCanvas(canvas, filename)    // Save canvas to a file\ndebugSaveText(text, filename)        // Save text to a file \ndebugSaveDataURL(dataURL, filename)  // Save url to a file\n\n// Debug settings\ndebug                // Is debug enabled?\ndebugPointSize = .5  // Size to render debug points by default\ndebugKey = 'Escape'  // Key code used to toggle debug mode\ndebugOverlay         // True if the debug overlay is active\nenableAsserts        // True if asserts are enabled\nshowWatermark        // True if watermark with FPS should be show\n```\n\n[LittleJS Engine](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS) Copyright 2021 Frank Force\n\n![LittleJS Logo](examples/favicon.png)\n"
