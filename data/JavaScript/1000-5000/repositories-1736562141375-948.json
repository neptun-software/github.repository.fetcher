The latter is based on [usability rules](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/rules) that score a page based on factors like the presence of a sensible mobile [viewport](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/ConfigureViewport).\n\n## API\n\n### psi(url, [options])\n\nReturns a promise for the response data from Google PageSpeed Insights.\n\n#### url\n\nType: `string`\n\nURL of the page for which the PageSpeed Insights API should generate results.\n\n#### options\n\nType: `Object`\n\n##### key\n\nType: `string`<br>\nDefault: Free tier\n\nWhen using this module for a production-level build process, registering for an API key from the [Google Developer Console](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v1/getting_started#auth) is recommended.\n\n##### strategy\n\nType: `string`<br>\nDefault: `mobile`<br>\nValues: `mobile` `desktop`\n\nStrategy to use when analyzing the page.\n\n##### locale\n\nType: `string`<br>\nDefault: `en_US`\n\nLocale results should be generated in.\n\n##### threshold\n\nType: `number`<br>\nDefault: `70`\n\nThreshold score to pass the PageSpeed test. Useful for setting a performance budget.\n\n##### links\n\nType: `boolean`<br>\nDefault: `false`\n\nIf passed adds links with more info about opportunities. Useful for checking documentation about opportunities.\n\n### psi.output(url, [options])\n\nOutput the formatted report to the terminal.\n\nReturns a promise for the response data from Google PageSpeed Insights.\n\n`url` and `options` are the same as `psi()`.\n\n\n## CLI\n\n```\n$ npm install --global psi\n```\n\n```\n$ psi --help\n\n  Usage\n    $ psi <url>\n\n  Options\n    --key        Google API Key.

If you want to get **filmstrips** (or any audit details) you can require `psi` and get them from the `audits` object:\n\n```javascript\nconst psi = require('psi');\n\n(async () => {\n  // Get the PageSpeed Insights report\n  const {data} = await psi('https://theverge.com');\n  console.log(data.lighthouseResult.audits['screenshot-thumbnails'].details.items);\n})();\n```\n\n</details>\n\n## License\n\nApache-2.0 - Copyright 2015 Google Inc\n"
