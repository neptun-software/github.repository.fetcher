By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.

I laugh at my own jokes, like to use emojis, and think about thinking.\n\nSmart Connections is a [mission-driven](https://youtu.be/RtlpPTrEQ7c) software that's funded by users. Smart Connections is designed by an individual to enhance individual abilities so you can reach your goals and realize your visions for the future with software that's aligned with you. Follow [@wfhbrian](https://x.com/wfhbrian) for feature sneak peeks and other updates about the process of developing Smart Connections.\n\n![Easy to install and use](./assets/smart-connections-install.gif)\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Documentation site coming soon at [docs.smartconnections.app](https://docs.smartconnections.app). Contribute to the docs [here](https://github.com/brianpetro/Smart-Connections-Docs).\n\n## A brief history\nThe journey of Smart Connections is one I directly share with you. Smart Connections isn't just about some new features in Obsidian; it's a reflection of our shared experiences, your invaluable feedback, and a testament to what we can achieve together in the Obsidian community. A journey that's been both exhilarating and profoundly educational.\n\nObsidian wasn't my first attempt at trying to manage and make sense of my notes. And in late 2022, like what has happened with all of my past attempts, the system I had built in Obsidian was beginning to fall apart. There were too many notes and I didn't having enough time to organize, link, tag, and otherwise manage them properly.\n\nSmart Connections started as way for me to keep track of my thousands of notes, prevent rework, and make new connections by showing relevant notes/excerpts alongside whatever note I was currently working on via the Smart View.\n\nSoon after its initial release, the community recognized the opportunity for Smart Chat, so you can now chat with your notes, using the same technology behind the Smart View.\n\nFrom there, the Smart Connections community has continued playing a major part in its progress, from testing early-release versions, coming up with ideas for new features, solving issues, and enabling me with the resources necessary to spend more time building software that enables individuals with AI!\n\n## Mission\nSmart Connections is about more than technology; it's about community, collaboration, and the shared journey of enhancing our note-taking experiences. Here's a brief look at the motivation behind Smart Connections, followed by heartfelt testimonials from our users.\n\nThe Smart Connections mission is making AI technology for individuals, emphasizing accessibility, and fostering a community-driven development. Unlike many tools that prioritize corporate interests, Smart Connections is a testament to the power of open-source, user-supported software in making advanced technology accessible to everyone.\n\nOpen-source has been around for a long time. Still, over the past decade, the primary beneficiary of open source has shifted away from individuals and toward corporate interests. This shift can be seen by looking at the many VC-funded \"open-source\" projects.\n\nIn contrast, Smart Connections is designed for individuals, emphasizing accessibility for the less technical, and is funded directly by users.\n\n> \"I believe that open-source software that serves individuals directly, like Smart Connections, is one of the best ways we can ensure equitable access to AI-provided opportunities.\"\n> 🌴 Brian\n\n## Discover Smart Connections\nSmart Connections goes beyond just being a plugin; it's a bridge that connects your thoughts, notes, and insights in Obsidian, making your information management seamless and intuitive. Let's explore what makes Smart Connections stand out:\n\n### Smart View: AI-Powered Note Discovery\nThe Smart View feature dynamically offers real-time suggestions of related notes, based on your current activity. It uses AI embeddings to surface relevant notes based on your current context. This not only enhances your creativity but also significantly improves your productivity by illuminating connections you might not have seen.\n\n![Smart View demo showing that the most relevant notes are shown at the top based on the current note.](./assets/SCv2-Smart-View-light.gif)\n\n### Smart Chat: AI Conversations Based on Your Notes\nTransform your note-taking with Smart Chat. This feature allows you to have dynamic conversations with your notes, powered by the latest AI technology. Whether you're brainstorming, seeking information, or exploring your notes in new ways, Smart Chat makes it possible.\n\n![Demo showing how Smart Chat can answer the question \"Who am I?\" based on the notes in Obsidian](./assets/smart-connections-chat-who-am-i.gif)\n\n*AI chat models available in the Smart Chat are listed below.*\n\n## User Testimonials\nHearing from those who use Smart Connections brings to life the impact it has on individuals' workflows and creativity. \n\nHere's what some of them have to say:\n\n- \"Smart Connections is revolutionary for my process of attempting to wrangle decades of sprawling unorganized notes, journals etc. Amazing work! Look forward to seeing it evolve.\" - Ronny\n- [\"I've switched over from Mem to Obsidian when I found this plugin\"](https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/694233507500916796/1091164112425320538)\n- [\"I actually decided to start using Obsidian BECAUSE of Smart Connections.\"](https://github.com/brianpetro/obsidian-smart-connections/issues/441#:~:text=I%20actually%20decided%20to%20start%20using%20Obsidian%20BECAUSE%20of%20Smart%20Connections.)\n- [Let me take the opportunity to say what a brilliant plug in you have created it has completely transformed the way I am able to use notes.](https://github.com/brianpetro/obsidian-smart-connections/issues/592#issuecomment-2104332746:~:text=Let%20me%20take%20the%20opportunity%20to%20say%20what%20a%20brilliant%20plug%20in%20you%20have%20created%20it%20has%20completely%20transformed%20the%20way%20I%20am%20able%20to%20use%20notes)\n- [I can already see this will be a game-changer for my research and personal note-taking.](https://github.com/brianpetro/obsidian-smart-connections/issues/589#issuecomment-2104948387:~:text=I%20can%20already%20see%20this%20will%20be%20a%20game%2Dchanger%20for%20my%20research%20and%20personal%20note%2Dtaking.)\n- [Hi Brian, you've created one of the most powerful Obsidian's plugin, in the name of all the Obsidian users, i really want to thank you !

Here's an overview of how the plugin operates:\n\n### Creating embeddings\n- When you first install Smart Connections, it processes all your notes to create \"embeddings\" - numerical representations of your notes' content.\n- These embeddings are stored in a hidden `.smart-env` folder in your vault. This folder can be changed in the settings.\n- The plugin uses file modification times to determine if a note needs to be re-processed, ensuring efficiency.\n\n### Limitations\n- Currently, Smart Connections is desktop-only. Mobile support is currently in beta-testing in the early-release version (v2.2).\n\nFor more detailed information on the plugin's operation, please refer to the features section below.\n\n## Easy Installation\nGetting started with Smart Connections is easy. Simply install Smart Connections from the Obsidian Community plugins to begin enhancing your Obsidian experience with AI-powered functionalities.\n\n### Installing from Obsidian community plugins\n![](./assets/obsidian-community-smart-connections-install.png)\n\n## Settings\n### Default settings\n##### Local embedding models\nLocal embedding models enable leveraging the power of Smart Connections without sending data to any third-party for processing. `BGE-micro` is a small and reliable local embedding model used by default. This allows Smart Connections Smart View to work out-of-box; no API key, additional software or setup required!\n\n### Additional setup\n#### File/folder exclusions\nYou can exclude specific files or folders from being processed by Smart Connections. This is useful for ignoring irrelevant or sensitive information.\n\n#### Changing AI models\nSmart Connections supports various AI models for both embeddings and chat. You can change these in the plugin settings to suit your needs and preferences.\n\n##### OpenAI API Key\n- Requires pre-paying for API credits if you choose to use OpenAI's models\n\n## Features\n\n### Smart View\nThe Smart View provides real-time note suggestions based on your current note.\n\n![Demo showing Smart View results changing based on the current note](./assets/SCv2-Smart-View-dark.gif)\n\n##### Accessing notes in the Smart View\n- Click to open a result in the Smart View \n- Preview connections using the expand/collapse (fold/unfold) button to the left of each result\n- Expand/collapse all feature (displayed below)\n\n![Demo showing the fold/unfold feature which displays or hides the content of the notes in the Smart View](./assets/SCv2-fold-unfold.gif)\n\n##### Smart View Search\nClick the search icon to input a search query.\n- note: it's important to remember that embedding search (semantic) does not function like a traditional keyword search (lexical).\n\n### Smart Chat\nNotes are retrieved to and used as context in the conversation when you input a self-referential pronoun like \"my\" in \"Based on my notes...\" \n\n##### ChatMD (new in `v2.1`)\nChat history is saved as a new note for each conversation.\n###### `sc-context` codeblock\n- prevents duplication of notes used as context in the chat history\n- renders a Smart View containing the notes or excerpts used as context\n##### chat models\n![Access model settings in the Smart Chat](./assets/smart-chat-settings.png)\n###### v2.1 (current)\n- OpenAI\n\t- `GPT-4o` (128K)\n\t- `GPT-4-turbo` (128K)\n\t- `GPT-4` (8K)\n\t- `GPT-3.5-turbo` (16K)\n- Google\n\t- `gemini-1.0-pro` (30K)\n\t- `gemini-1.5-pro-latest` (1MM)\n- Anthropic\n\t- `claude-3-opus` (200K)\n\t- `claude-3-sonnet` (200K)\n\t- `claude-3-haiku` (200K)\n- Open Router\n\t- `llama-3-70b`\n\t- *Too many models to list here*\n- Cohere\n\t- `command-r` (128K)\n\t- `command-r-plus` (128K)\n- Custom Local\n\t- Ollama\n\t- LM Studio\n- Custom API\n### Smart Random Note\nJump to a not-too-random a note.\n- Limits possible random notes to the Smart Connections for the current note.\n- Opens to specific headings within a note.\n### Smart Command (Find Notes)\n- Section 'Block' Matching\n\t- Description of block matching feature\n- Highlight to Find Smart Connections\n\t- Usage of highlighted text for finding connections\n- Smart Chat\n\t- Conversations with notes\n\t- Information retrieval and exploration\n- Interactive conversations with notes using AI  \n- How it works  \n- Features (GPT-4 support, context-aware responses, etc.)  \n- Benefits and limitations  \n### Dynamic Code Blocks\n- Dedicated section for displaying relevant connections  \n- How to use the dynamic code block \n\t- Section 'block' matching  \n\t- Highlight to find Smart Connections\n### Note vs Block Level Smart Connections\n[Note-Level vs. Block-Level Embeddings in Smart Connections: What's the Difference?](https://youtu.be/9YG8gwihz3Q)\n### Notifications and Progress Indicators\n- muting notifications\n\n## Companion Plugins\n\n### Smart Connections Visualizer\n\n[![Visualizer](./assets/SCViz.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbFRyJBkxS0)\nThis [open-source plugin](https://github.com/Mossy1022/Smart-Connections-Visualizer) integrates seamlessly with Smart Connections, offering an advanced, interactive way to visualize connections between your notes.

In fact, one of the biggest needs of Smart Connections is non-technical. Creating content that shows how you're using Smart Connections not only helps development, but also helps existing and potential users better understand how they can benefit from utilizing AI, creating an impact that extends beyond this project! \n##### Screencasts\nYour contributions through video testimonials on how you use Smart Connections are invaluable. These insights not only help improve the plugin but also assist in showcasing real-world applications to the community.\n\nScreen recording tools like Loom make it easy to record and share screencasts. If you create on of these screencasts, please share it with the community. I try to re-share this type of content on all of my available channels as much as possible. \n\n## Content & Resources\n- Videos added to README\n- SC Backlinks (third-party content)\n\n## Smart Connections Architecture\nDelve into the architecture behind Smart Connections, designed with efficiency and user benefit in mind. Key design principles include:\n- minimizing external dependencies for easy to audit code\n- working out-of-box to maximize ease-of-use\n- modular open-source components for re-use in other project\n### Local Models\n- Local models are an important development because they enable utilizing AI without sending potentially sensitive data to third-party providers like OpenAI.\n- Smart Connections `v2.0` introduced built-in local embedding models. Built-in models are easy-to-use and do not require installing or configuring third-party software. The default embedding model for new users is a local model.\n- Smart Connections `v2.1` introduced advanced chat model configurations so that the Smart Chat to can utilize local chat models running locally.\n### Dependencies\n*Minimizing dependencies has been a key principle in the development of Smart Connections.* \n##### First-party Dependencies\nThese are modules that I developed with the same principle of minimizing dependencies.\n- [`smart-chat-model`](https://github.com/brianpetro/jsbrains/tree/main/smart-chat-model)\n- [`smart-embed-model`](https://github.com/brianpetro/jsbrains/tree/main/smart-embed-model)\n- [`smart-chats`](https://github.com/brianpetro/jsbrains/tree/main/smart-chats)\n- [`smart-chunks`](https://github.com/brianpetro/jsbrains/tree/main/smart-chunks)\n- [`smart-chunks`](https://github.com/brianpetro/jsbrains/tree/main/smart-chunks)\n- [`smart-entities`](https://github.com/brianpetro/jsbrains/tree/main/smart-entities)\n##### Third-party Dependencies\n- `ejs`: a template engine used for rendering UI components\n\t- Uses `ejs.min`, benefiting from being a minimized, standalone file that removes unnecessary dependencies like `fs`.\n- `transformer.js`: a library for running AI models by Hugging Face\n\t- This is *not* bundled by default and is only used if you are using local models.\n\t- This dependency is loaded within an iframe which \"sandboxes\" the code.  \n### Themes & Styles\nStyles are designed to inherit from the user's theme whenever possible.\n\n## Troubleshooting Common Issues\n\n### Embedding process keeps restarting or is slow\n- This is not normal behavior. First, try switching to the reliable BGE-micro embedding model in the settings. \n- If issues persist, check the developer console for any error messages and share screenshots of the errors to get further assistance.\n\n### OpenAI API errors\n- Make sure you have pre-paid API credits in your OpenAI account. OpenAI recently changed their billing system to require pre-paid credits.\n- Double check that the API key you entered in the Smart Connections settings matches the account you added credit to. There are separate API key settings for embeddings and chat.\n- Share screenshots of the specific API errors from the developer console to get more targeted troubleshooting help.\n\nFor quickest support, always include screenshots, especially of any errors in the developer console (View -> Toggle Developer Tools). Searching existing issues on GitHub is also recommended for Obsidian plugin problems.\n- [Report an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/brianpetro/obsidian-smart-connections/issues)\n\n## Developers  \n- Benefits of using Smart Connections embeddings in your plug-in\n\t- lowers cost for users\n\t\t- prevents being double charged for API embeddings\n\t\t- reduces processing times for local embeddings\n\t- reduce development time\n- Smart Connections search can be accessed via the window\n\t- `window['SmartSearch'].search(text, filter={})`\n\t- more details will be provided in the future\n\t\t- until then, I encourage you to create an issue with your desired use case and I will to help with guidance through the development process.\n## Supporter License Clarification\n- [ ] TODO\n\n<details><summary>Testimonials from Smart Connections Supporters 😊</summary>\n\n- [I became a Smart Connections supporter because] \"I like to support projects that I see have people behind who are authentically giving their creativity and vision.

Engaging with our community of Obsidian enthusiasts and AI aficionados is an excellent opportunity to learn from others, explore creative ways to use Smart Connections, and contribute to the continuous improvement of this powerful plugin. Let's work together to shape the future of AI-enhanced note-taking in Obsidian!\n\n## Features\n### Smart Chat: Transform Your Notes into Interactive Conversations\nEnhance your note-taking experience with [Smart Chat](https://wfhbrian.com/introducing-smart-chat-transform-your-obsidian-notes-into-interactive-ai-powered-conversations/), a plugin that turns your notes into an AI-powered interactive chat. Retrieve information, clarify concepts, and explore ideas by engaging in a conversation with your notes.\n\n![](./assets/smart-connections-chat-who-am-i.gif)\n\n#### How Smart Chat Works\n- To access Smart Chat, open the command palette and select \"Smart Connections: Open Smart Chat.\" If you already have the Smart View pane open, you can also access the Smart Chat by clicking the message icon in the top right.\n- In the Smart Chat pane, type your question or message and hit Send or use the shortcut `Shift+Enter`.\n- The AI will analyze your notes and provide a relevant response based on the content in your vault.\n\t- **Note**: Currently, to trigger a search of your notes, you must use a self-referential pronoun (ex. I, me, my, mine, we, us, our, ours).\n- You can continue the conversation by replying to the response or asking follow-up questions.\n\n#### How does Smart Chat retrieve information on my notes?\n\nThe Smart Connections plug-in uses a retrieval strategy known as HyDE. Put simply, Smart Connections takes your prompt and uses embeddings to decide the top 20-30 notes in your vault that would provide an accurate response to the question. It then feeds these chosen notes to the OpenAI GPT model as a large, amalgamated prompt and returns an answer based on that information.\n\nIf you ask questions on a topic which can be found across more than those 20 or 30 notes, the response may be less comprehensive. It is better to be as specific as possible with your questions, so that the HyDE process can feed only the most relevant notes to the GPT AI.\n\n#### Chat Features\n- **Context-aware responses**: Smart Chat understands the context of your notes, providing responses that are accurate and relevant to your specific content.\n- **Natural language processing**: The AI-powered feature interprets and responds to your questions in a conversational manner, simulating a chat with a real person.\n- **Multilingual support**: Smart Chat can understand and respond to queries in multiple languages, allowing you to interact with your notes in your preferred language.\n \n![](./assets/smart-connections-chat-backstory.gif)\n\n##### Coming soon!\n- **Note linking**: If a response references a specific note in your vault, Smart Chat will provide a link to that note for quick access.\n- **Current-note chat**: Have a conversation based on a specific note instead of the entire vault.\n\n#### Benefits of Smart Chat\n- **Efficient Information Retrieval**: Quickly access specific information in your notes without having to search and browse through numerous files.\n- **Improved Knowledge Retention**: Engaging with your notes through a conversational interface helps reinforce your understanding and recall of the material.\n- **Creative Exploration**: Discover new connections and insights as you interact with your notes, fostering an environment for brainstorming and idea generation.\n\n#### Limitations\n- The quality of the responses depends on the content and organization of your notes. Ensure your notes are well-structured and comprehensive for the best experience.\n- Smart Chat may occasionally provide incorrect or irrelevant responses due to the limitations of AI understanding. In such cases, rephrase your question or provide more context for better results.\n\n### Smart View\n\n![Smart View demo showing that the most relevant notes are shown at the top based on the current note.](./assets/SCv2-Smart-View-light.gif)\n\n- Notes with multiple matching blocks can be expanded to show the matching blocks.\n- Search feature that uses embeddings to search for notes in your vault.\n- You can click on a note to open it in the current pane or hold down the `ctrl` or `cmd` to open it in a new pane.\n- To preview the notes in the Smart Connections Pane, you can hold down the `ctrl` or `cmd` key to preview the note while hovering over it.\n- You can drag and drop a link from the to become a link in your note or open it as a new tab.\n\n### Smart View: Dynamic Code Block\nThe dynamic code block feature allows you to create a dedicated section within your notes for Smart Connections. By labeling this code block as `smart-connections`, the content within the block will be specifically used to find relevant connections in your vault.\n\n#### How to Use the Dynamic Code Block\nTo create a dynamic code block for Smart Connections, follow these steps:\n1.  In your Obsidian note, start a new code block by typing three backticks followed by `smart-connections`.\n2.  Press Enter to create a new line, and type the content you want to use for finding Smart Connections. This can include keywords, phrases, or even full sentences that are relevant to the note and its context.\n    - If left blank, the plugin will use the entire content of the note. This returns the same results as the default Smart Connections pane (Smart View).\n3.  Close the code block by typing three backticks on a new line after your content.\n![](./assets/sc-dynamic-codeblock-code.png)\n![](./assets/sc-dynamic-codeblock-rendered.png)\n### Section 'block' matching\n- Smart Connections plugin will use 'blocks' of text in your notes to find the most relevant connections.\n- Currently, a 'block' is a section of text that is separated by a heading.\n    - For example, if you have a note that contains the following text: `# Header 1\\nThis is a block of text.\\n# Header 2\\nThis is another block of text`, then the plugin will search for similar blocks of text in addition to making smart connections with similar files.\n\n### Highlight to find Smart Connections\n- Highlighted text will be used to find Smart Connections when you run the \"Find Smart Connections\" command\n\n![](./assets/search-feature.png)\n\n## How it works\n- The Smart Connections Pane is opened when you activate the plugin. You can also open it from the command palette with the \"Open: View Smart Connections\" command.\n- Each time you open a note, the plugin will search for similar notes in your vault and display them in the Smart Connections Pane (sidebar). The Smart Connections Pane will display the most similar notes first using the cosine similarity of the note's embeddings.\n- The plugin will only search for similar notes in the current vault. It will not search for similar notes in other vaults.\n\n### Initial processing\n- The plugin will process all your notes and store the embeddings in a hidden folder in your vault called `.smart-connections` in a file called `embeddings.json`. This file is used to cache the embeddings of your notes so that they do not need to be recalculated each time you open a note. `file.mtime` is used to determine if a note has been modified since the last time Smart Connections calculated the embeddings. The `embeddings.json` file can get to be quite large, so it is recommended that you exclude the folder from your sync settings.\n- The initial processing may take a while, depending on the number of notes in your vault.\n- The plugin will only process notes that are in the current vault. It will not process notes in other vaults.\n- The cost of the initial processing is proportional to the number of notes in your vault. Without any exclusions configured in the settings, the amount of tokens used in the initial processing is approximately 2X the total number of \"tokens\" in your entire vault. A rough calculation for this is `the total number of characters in the vault` divided by `2`. For example, if your vault contains 100,000 characters, then the initial processing will cost approximately 50,000 tokens. The current token cost is $0.0004 per 1,000 tokens (as of [2021-08-01](https://openai.com/api/pricing/)) which is estimated to be ~$1 USD for 3,000 pages (assuming 800 tokens per page).\n\n## Settings\n- `File Exclusions` - Enter a comma-separated list of file or folder names to exclude from the search completely. For example, if you want to exclude all files that contain the word \"drawings\" in the file name, you can enter \"drawings\" in the field. If you want to exclude all files that contain the word \"drawings\" or \"prompts\" in the file name, you can enter \"drawings,prompts\" in the field.\n- `Folder Exclusions` - similar to `File Exclusions` but only matches folders instead of anything in the file path.\n- `Heading Exclusions` - Enter a comma-separated list of headings to exclude. Smart Connections will exclude 'Blocks' with headings that match the Heading Exclusions from the search. \n\t- For example, use this if you have a commonly occurring \"Archive\" section in many files and do not want the contents to be included when making smart connections.  \n\t- This only applies to 'blocks' and does not change the content used for matching entire files.\n- `Show Full Path` - Show the full path of the file in the Smart Connections Pane. If turned off, only the file name will be shown.\n\n### Settings (Advanced)\n- `Force Refresh` - this will force the plugin to recalculate the embeddings for all files in your vault. This plugin is designed so that you SHOULD NOT need to use this feature.\n## Error handling\n- If you encounter an error, please open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/brianpetro/obsidian-smart-connections/issues).\n## Developing Add-ons\n- **Coming soon**: Use Smart Connections in your plugin! Prevent the headaches of managing vector storage and save your users money by reusing their existing embeddings.\n\t- **Note**: This feature is currently in beta. Create a GitHub issue if you want to learn how to use the beta version of this feature.\n- This plugin is designed to manage the vector interpretation (\"embeddings\") of the notes in your vaults. The requirements for managing this can be extensive.\n- While there are many ways to interpret the vector relationships and make them useful this plugin is focused on delivering the core capabilities required to utilize such a system.\n\n"
