This collection of problems from [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/), [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) was an essential part of the process.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nKeep in mind that this is a small part of the entire journey. It does not contain:\n\n- Study materials. You and the interviewer should have a common language for communication. This means that you'd have to have a good understanding of the fundamental computer science terminology.\n- Thought process. During the interview, you should explain your thought process and approach the problems in a certain way. To understand this part, I'd recommend you looking at \"[Cracking the coding interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X)\".\n- Some of the solutions in the repo might not be the most optimal ones. Feel free to open a PR with an alternative version.\n- **These are not problems I got on my interviews**. These are sample problems from [leetcode](https://leetcode.com), [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/), which have similar complexity to what you'd get on your interviews.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"
