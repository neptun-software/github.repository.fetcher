          "content": "# Contributing to Twind\n\nThanks for checking out Twind! Please read on to learn how you can help make this project even better.\n\n## Reporting Issues\n\nFound a problem? Want a new feature?\n\n- See if your issue or idea has [already been reported].\n- Provide a [reduced test case] or a [live example].\n\nRemember, a bug is a _demonstrable problem_ caused by _our_ code.\n\n## Ways to help\n\nRegardless of your experience level, there are ways that you can help:\n\n- Share the project on Twitter\n- Star the project on Github\n- Tell your friends/co-workers about Twind\n- Write an article about Twind on Medium, Dev, or your platform of choice\n- Create written or video tutorials about Twind\n- Report bugs or provide feedback by [creating issues](https://github.com/tw-in-js/twind)\n- Contribute to the source code by fixing bugs/issues or helping us build new features\n\n## Financial contributions\n\nWe also welcome financial contributions in full transparency on our [open collective](https://opencollective.com/twind).\nAnyone can file an expense. If the expense makes sense for the development of the community, it will be \"merged\" in the ledger of our open collective by the core contributors and the person who filed the expense will be reimbursed.\n\n## How to create a good bug report\n\nTo be able to fix issues we need to see them on our machine. This is only possible when we can reproduce the error. The easiest way to do that is narrow down the problem to specific components or combination of them. This can be done by removing as much unrelated code as possible.\n\nThe perfect way to do that is to make a [codesandbox]. That way you can easily share the problematic code and ensure that others can see the same issue you are seeing.\n\nFor us a [codesandbox] says more than a 1000 words :tada:\n\n## Documentation changes\n\nAll documentation for SvelteKit is in the `documentation` directory, and any improvements should be made as a Pull Request to this repository. The documentation is served via [an API](https://github.com/sveltejs/api.svelte.dev); the site itself is located in the [`sites` repository](https://github.com/sveltejs/sites).\n\nIf you wish to preview documentation changes locally, please follow the instructions here: [Previewing local docs changes](https://github.com/sveltejs/sites/blob/master/sites/kit.svelte.dev/README.md#previewing-local-docs-changes).\n\n## Submitting Pull Requests\n\nPull requests are the greatest contributions, so be sure they are focused in scope and avoid unrelated commits.\n\n- If adding a new feature:\n\n  - Add accompanying test case.\n  - Provide a convincing reason to add this feature. Ideally, you should open a suggestion issue first and have it approved before working on it.\n\n- If fixing bug:\n\n  - If you are resolving a special issue, add `(fix #xxxx[,#xxxx])` (#xxxx is the issue id) in your PR title for a better release log, e.g. `fix: update entities encoding/decoding (fix #3899)`.\n  - Provide a detailed description of the bug in the PR. Live demo preferred.\n  - Add appropriate test coverage if applicable.\n\n- It's OK to have multiple small commits as you work on the PR - we will automatically squash them before merging. Please do not force push commits — this makes the conversation difficult to follow.\n\n- Make sure tests pass!\n\n1. To begin: [fork this project], clone your fork, and add our upstream.\n\n   ```sh\n   # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory\n   git clone git@github.com:$(npx github-username-cli $(git config user.email))/twind.git\n\n   # Navigate to the newly cloned directory\n   cd twind\n\n   # Assign the original repo to a remote called \"upstream\"\n   git remote add upstream git@github.com:tw-in-js/twind.git\n   ```\n\n2. Local development\n\n   The Twind repo is a monorepo using pnpm workspaces. The package manager used to install and link dependencies must be [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/).\n\n   To develop and test a `twind` package:\n\n   1. Run `pnpm install` in `twind`'s root folder\n\n   2. Run `pnpm test` to run all tests\n\n3. Create a branch for your feature or fix:\n\n   ```sh\n   # Move into a new branch for your feature\n   git checkout -b feature/thing\n   ```\n\n   ```sh\n   # Move into a new branch for your fix\n   git checkout -b fix/something\n   ```\n\n4. Generating changelogs\n\n   For changes to be reflected in package changelogs, run `pnpx changeset` and follow the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until Twind 1.0\n\n   ```sh\n   pnpx changeset\n   ```\n\n5. If your code passes all the tests, then push your feature branch:\n\n   ```sh\n   # Test current code\n   pnpm test # or npm test\n\n   # Build current code\n   pnpm build # or npm run build\n   ```\n\n   > Note: ensure your version of Node is 14 or higher to run scripts\n\n   ```sh\n   # Push the branch for your new feature\n   git push origin feature/thing\n   ```\n\n   ```sh\n   # Or, push the branch for your update\n   git push origin update/something\n   ```\n\nThat’s it! Now [open a pull request] with a clear title and description.\n\n### Testing Twind against external packages\n\nYou may wish to test your locally-modified copy of Twind against another package that is using it. For pnpm, after building Twind, you can use [`pnpm.overrides`](https://pnpm.io/package_json#pnpmoverrides). Please note that `pnpm.overrides` must be specified in the root `package.json` and you must first list the package as a dependency in the root `package.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@twind/core\": \"*\"\n  },\n  \"pnpm\": {\n    \"overrides\": {\n      \"@twind/core\": \"link:../path/to/twind/packages/core\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd re-run `pnpm install` to link the package.\n\n## Releases\n\nThe [Changesets GitHub action](https://github.com/changesets/action#with-publishing) will create and update a PR that applies changesets and publishes new versions of changed packages to npm.\n\n> It uses `pnpm publish` rather than `pnpx changeset publish` so that we can use the `--filter` and (while in beta) `--tag` flags — though perhaps they work with `pnpx changeset publish`?\n\n[already been reported]: https://github.com/tw-in-js/twind/issues\n[fork this project]: https://github.com/tw-in-js/twind/fork\n[live example]: https://codesandbox.io/s/twind-bug-report-template-yfxpx\n[codesandbox]: https://codesandbox.io/s/twind-bug-report-template-yfxpx\n[open a pull request]: https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/\n[reduced test case]: https://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/\n"

Other than the founders' initial attempts at implementing such a module ([oceanwind](https://github.com/lukejacksonn/oceanwind) and [beamwind](https://github.com/kenoxa/beamwind)) we are truly standing on the shoulders of giants.\n\n- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): created a wonderfully thought out API on which the compiler's grammar was defined.\n- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/): implemented and popularized the advantages of doing CSS-in-JS.\n- [htm](https://github.com/developit/htm): a JSX compiler that proved there is merit in doing runtime compilation of DSLs like JSX.\n- [goober](https://github.com/cristianbote/goober): an impossibly small yet efficient CSS-in-JS implementation that defines critical module features.\n- [otion](https://github.com/kripod/otion): the first CSS-in-JS solution specifically oriented around handling CSS in an atomic fashion.\n- [clsx](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx): a tiny utility for constructing class name strings conditionally.\n- [style-vendorizer](https://github.com/kripod/style-vendorizer): essential CSS prefixing helpers in less than 1KB of JavaScript.\n- [UnoCSS](https://github.com/antfu/unocss): for the configuration syntax.\n- [CSSType](https://github.com/frenic/csstype): providing autocompletion and type checking for CSS properties and values.\n\n### 🤝 Contributors\n\nThank you to all the people who have <a href=\"https://github.com/tw-in-js/twind/graphs/contributors\">already contributed</a> to twind!\n\n### 🙏🏾 Sponsors\n\nThis project is kindly sponsored by <a href=\"https://www.kenoxa.com\" target=\"_blank\">Kenoxa GmbH</a> who support [@sastan](https://github.com/sastan) to maintain this project as part of their open-source engagement.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.copilottravel.com\" target=\"_blank\">COPILOT TRAVEL</a> is partnering with [@sastan](https://github.com/sastan) to keep twind aligned with the latest Tailwind CSS releases.\n\nThank you to all our sponsors!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <a href=\"https://twind.style/sponsors.svg\">\n    <img src=\"https://twind.style/sponsors.svg\" alt=\"Sponsors\"/>\n  </a>\n</p>\n\nPlease ask your company to also support this open source project by becoming a sponsor on [opencollective](https://opencollective.com/twind#sponsor) or [GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/tw-in-js).\n\n## ⚖️ License\n\nThe [MIT license](https://github.com/tw-in-js/twind/blob/main/LICENSE) governs your use of Twind.\n"
