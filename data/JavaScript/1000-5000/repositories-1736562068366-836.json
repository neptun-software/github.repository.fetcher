          "content": "# Welcome!\n\nThank you for your interest in Smashing! This project is a fork of Dashing, the exceptionally handsome dashboard framework. We're still in the process of transitioning, so please excuse the mess.\n\nFor general questions on new features, widgets, or ideas, please consider using the\n[Gitter Chat Room](https://gitter.im/Smashing/Lobby). This way\ndevelopers can maintain code-related issues in GitHub, and help users with users with simple\nusage or widgets questions in a more appropriate channel.\n\n<a name=\"issues\"></a>\n## Have an Issue\n\nIf you run into problems with Smashing (or Dashing), please take these steps before\nsubmitting an issue:\n\n1. Check the [Troubleshooting Guide](https://github.com/Dashing-io/dashing/wiki#how-tos) in the wiki.\n2. Ask in the [Gitter Chat Room](https://gitter.im/Smashing/Lobby) - please do not submit issues for support requests.\n3. Use the [GitHub Issue Search](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/) to check if the issue has already been reported.\n4. Submit your issue to our Issue Tracker. Please provide as much helpful information as possible, preferably making use of a [reduced test case](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/QA/Reducing_testcases).\n\n<a name=\"features\"></a>\n## Feature Requests\n\nFeature requests are welcome, but take a moment to consider whether your idea\nfits with the scope and aim of the project. A good rule of thumb is to apply\nthe 80/20 rule: every feature should be useful to at least 80% of users. Adding\nin every possible edge case will only make it more difficult to understand, maintain,\nand hack on.\n\nIf you feel that you have a really amazing, super neato idea that doesn't\nquite fit with the core use of Smashing, it may be a good candidate for an\nexternal Gem which supercharges a project. An excellent example of this is\n[dashing-contrib](https://github.com/QubitProducts/dashing-contrib). If you\ndo create a third-party extension for Smashing, please add it [here](https://github.com/Dashing-io/dashing/wiki/Additional-Widgets#other-third-party-tools).\n\nFor general questions on new features, widgets, or ideas, please use the\n[project mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/smashing-dashboard).\n\n<a name=\"pull-requests\"></a>\n## Pull Requests\n\nPatches, improvements and new features are a fantastic\nhelp -- thank you!\n\n**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g.\nimplementing features, refactoring code, porting to a different language),\notherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that may\nnot be merged into the project.\n\nPlease adhere to the coding conventions used throughout a project (indentation,\naccurate comments, etc.) and any other requirements (such as test coverage).\nAll code submitted via Pull Request will be discussed and critiqued in a\nrespectful manner.\n\nGitHub has [excellent documentation on how to use Pull Requests.](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)\n\n<a name=\"commit-msgs\"></a>\n## Git Commit Message Suggestions\n\n* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:\n    * :art: `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code\n    * :moyai: `:moyai:` when adding a new feature\n    * :wrench: `:wrench:` when dealing with the toolchain (Git, Travis, etc)\n    * :notebook: `:notebook` when dealing with docs\n    * :racehorse: `:racehorse:` when improving performance\n    * :penguin: `:penguin:` when fixing something on Linux\n    * :apple: `:apple:` when fixing something on Mac OS\n    * :bug: `:bug:` when fixing a bug\n    * :bomb: `:bomb:` when removing code or files\n    * :white_check_mark: `:white_check_mark:` when adding tests\n    * :lock: `:lock:` when dealing with security\n    * :arrow_up: `:arrow_up:` when upgrading dependencies\n    * :arrow_down: `:arrow_down:` when downgrading dependencies\n"

You can provide your name when reporting the issue so that we can use it in the\nCVE issue for the “reporter” field.\n\nOnce the issue has been fixed in a branch, the developer will share the solution with you to\nconfirm you agree the issue has been fixed. Finally, a new release will be prepared, and\nannounced with the CVE to the community.\n\nIf the issue is declined, then we may either document the risk, or leave an issue open.\n\nThank you for your contributions and cooperation.\n"
