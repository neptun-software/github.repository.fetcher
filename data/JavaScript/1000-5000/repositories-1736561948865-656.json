Named users or concurrent users are available. Named user licenses are purchasable via [our website](https://dosyago.com).\n\n### Purchasing a commercial license\n\nOnce purchased, you’ll receive a commercial license PDF including your agreement and valid Order receipt and you will be all set to use BrowserBox in your commercial applications. With the purchase of a commercial license:\n\n- You may use BrowserBox in as many commercial applications you like.\n- You may use BrowserBox in your own commercial applications and products. For example: premium VPN services, RBI systems, system integration portals, web automation and scraping products, educational platforms, and other products and apps.\n- Customers and users of your products do not need to purchase their own license — so long as they are not developing their own commercial products with BrowserBox.\n\n*Please note that we cannot transact with sanctioned countries, entities or individuals.* \n\nCommercial Licenses are priced per seat. A seat is someone who uses the BrowserBox system, either in an internal application (like secure email attachment viewing), or an external customer-facing application (such as a customer of your remote browser isolation product). Commercial Licenses come in two flavors:\n\n- **Perpetual License** This is a license to use the version of BrowserBox you purchase forever. The version can be updated to the latest via purchase of yearly licenses.\n- **Yearly License** This is a license to use the latest version available within the 12-months from your purchase. It can be manually renewed every year, or you can subscribe so it renews automatically.\n\nCommercial Licenses are available in two sizes:\n\n- **License Pack** Available in multiple sizes, from the small to the truly epic, with commensurately epic discounts at scale. These are purchasable at [our main website](https://dosyago.com).\n\nBy obtaining a commercial license, you gain the freedom to tailor BrowserBox to your specific requirements and integrate it seamlessly into your workflow. This empowers organizations to leverage the advanced features and capabilities of BrowserBox while maintaining full control over its customization and usage. \n\nSupport tiers and customization may be separately negotiated and purchased. To discuss your needs, please [reach out to our helpful support team here](mailto:support@dosyago.com?subject=BrowserBox).\n\n### Hardware Appliance (OEM) Licensing\n\nAre you an OEM and want to deploy BrowserBox on a hardware device that you sell to your customers? [Contact us for special access to Appliance License pricing with Volume Discounts](mailto:sales@dosyago.com?subject=OEM%20License). This pricing sheet and terms are tailored to suit OEM's delivering security products for business and industry. Please note that if you are supplying government or other non-commercial users you cannot \"pass through\" DOSYAGO's non-commercial license to your customers without licensing a Commercial license from us. \n\n### Sanctions Compliance\n\nUnfotunately if you or your company are an OFAC sanctioned entity or other entity sanctioned by the US Government (e.g. designated on OFAC's SDN List, BIS's DPL or Entity List, DDTC's DPL, or on the FBI's various lists, among others) we are unable to offer you a license of any form. Please note that in some cases we may conduct necessary checks to ensure sanctions compliance. \n\n### Licensing Summary \n\nBrowserBox offers flexible licensing options to cater to different usage scenarios. As previously mentioned, BrowserBox software is available for free for non-commercial use under the PolyForm NonCommercial license. This allows individuals and non-profit organizations to enjoy the benefits of BrowserBox without any licensing fees when using the software without any participation in or anticipation of commercial application. The PolyForm NonCommercial license ensures that the software is used strictly for non-commercial purposes, unless purchasing an exemption for commercial use. Commercial use licenses are available for purchase for 1 or more seats at https://dosyago.com or by contacting sales@dosyago.com\n\nWhether it's for non-commercial or commercial purposes, BrowserBox provides a range of licensing options to accommodate different user needs and ensure a secure and powerful browsing experience.\n"

The web **browser** becomes a web **app**. Abstract your web content. Secure your network. Program across sites. Access the web from anywhere, anywhere!*\n\nBrowserBox is a tiny, web-based browser that's embeddable anywhere. It's also multiplayer, allowing\nmany clients to screen share the same browsing session at the same time. It's lightweight and fast, \nconsuming the minimum system resources while adapting its streaming quality to take advantage of as\nmuch bandwidth as is available to provide a low-lag, responsive experience. \n\nIt's the only remote browser that works seamlessly on mobile devices, because, instead of just using a \nvirtual desktop or VNC layer, we virtualize the browser itself and fully control every part of it, ensuring\nwhen you view BrowserBox on a mobile device, you get a mobile browser on the server.\n\n[![Screenshot of BrowserBox running on the CloudTabs SaaS][IMG1]][PLAY1]\n\n**[TRY NOW!][PLAY1]**\n\n[![Screenshot of BrowserBox embedded, in this case on Puter.com Internet OS Web Desktop][IMG2]][PLAY2]\n\n**[TRY NOW on Puter.com!][PLAY2]**\n\n[PLAY1]: https://browse.cloudtabs.net/signupless_session\n[PLAY2]: https://puter.com/app/cloudtabs-browserbox\n[IMG1]: https://github.com/BrowserBox/BrowserBox/assets/22254235/599945e3-f2f9-416f-9a0e-fd0720fa8e87\n[IMG2]: https://github.com/BrowserBox/BrowserBox/assets/22254235/bfdbe7b2-a713-4add-83f7-9e10a9fd3e2f\n\n<a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/cloudtabs-1?utm_source=badge-featured&utm_medium=badge&utm_souce=badge-cloudtabs&#0045;1\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://api.producthunt.com/widgets/embed-image/v1/featured.svg?post_id=449256&theme=neutral\" alt=\"CloudTabs - A&#0032;browser&#0032;in&#0032;a&#0032;computer&#0032;in&#0032;your&#0032;browser | Product Hunt\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 54px;\" width=\"250\" height=\"54\" /></a>\n\n-------------\n\n## Install and Run Options\n\nWe provide a variety of install and run options, with instructions listed in this README. They include:\n\n- [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/dosyago/browserbox) - pull, then use `./deploy-scripts/run_docker.sh` after tagging the pulled image to `ghcr.io/browserbox/browserbox:latest`\n- [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/orgs/BrowserBox/packages) - just use `./deploy-scripts/run_docker.sh` directly or via bash redirect with curl (the *no clone* option :rocket:).\n- [Manual `git clone` and `./deploy-scripts/global_install.sh`](https://github.com/BrowserBox/BrowserBox?tab=readme-ov-file#manual-install---most-flexible-and-most-reliable-) - simple, flexible, direct. Perfect for development. See the [screencast &mdash; Deploying BrowserBox from 0 to 1: *\"Recorded in High Definition ASCII-nema Vision\"*](https://asciinema.org/a/654866)\n[![Screenshot of BrowserBox running on the CloudTabs SaaS][GIFSHOT]][ASCII]\n- [1-Click Cloud Deploy to Vultr, AWS, Azure or Linode](https://github.com/BrowserBox/BrowserBox?tab=readme-ov-file#1-click-deploy---deploy-browserbox-to-the-cloud-instantly--tada-cyclone) - great for using it right away.\n- Pull from a mirror (SourceForge, but it lags behind the official repo [on GitHub](https://github.com/BrowserBox/BrowserBox)), or a fork (https://github.com/BrowserBox/BrowserBox/forks) &ndash; then use one the manual install option. But we recommend always using the latest code from our [Official BrowserBox GitHub Repository](https://github.com/BrowserBox/BrowserBox).\n- [Windows Edition](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/BrowserBox-Installer/1.5.8.20) - via the PowerShell Gallery installer package. In beta, so currently may be a little brittle or fragile, but the only option if you need to run natively on Windows. As a bonus we figured out how to get audio to stream from a Windows server without an active RDP connection, and without installing a virtual audio driver. We rock! 🚀 ❤️\n\n[GIFSHOT]: https://github.com/BrowserBox/BrowserBox/assets/22254235/5376f2c3-91b5-4865-94bf-ee3a616b3b98\n[ASCII]: https://asciinema.org/a/654866\n  \n------\n\n# Getting Started Guide\n\nYou may run BrowserBox via a variety of easy to access means. The simplest and most stable is the full manual install. Simple spin up a VPS, VM baremetal server, or even your local device of choice and follow the instructions below and you'll be up and running in two jiffies! :joy_cat:\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> In case you're wondering, right now we don't track any telemetry at all. Not even that email address you'll enter. We plan to, in future one day, begin collecting at least your email, for the following purpose only: to very cautiously and tripatiously invite you to join a mailing list to receive updates on BrowserBox. *But not today.*\n\n## Install and Run Via Docker - Easiest and Fastest, but can be less Reliable ✅\n\nTo run BrowserBox docker easily you need to use the included **run script**: `./deploy-scripts/run_docker.sh PORT HOST EMAIL` and follow the instructions. \n\nEquivalently, use npm to install the global `bbox` command which just executes the docker run script:\n\n```console\n$ npm i -g @dosyago/browserbox@latest\n$ bbox\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> We use a run script to avoid you needing to manually bridge a range of ports, run the correct command, and ensure HTTPS certificates are set up across a range of deployment scenarios. Worry not, our intrepid `run_docker.sh` script will guide you through everything you need.\n\nYou can get started right away, just follow the prompts when you run the below to install and run the latest BrowserBox on Docker:\n\n```console\nbash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrowserBox/BrowserBox/boss/deploy-scripts/run_docker.sh) 9999 my-browser.example.com me@example.com\n```\n\n> [!TIP]\n> That's all you need! Just ensure you replace the examples values above with the correct `PORT`, `HOST`, and `EMAIL` you wish to use for your deployment. Finally, a head's up: the run script may prompt you to perform some setup steps, especially on macOS. Follow those and you'll be on your way to BrowserBox Land in no time! :joy_cat:\n\n### A note on the arguments\n\n- `PORT` is the main port where BrowserBox will run.\n- `HOST` is the hostname of the server where BrowserBox will run. It can either be localhost or a fully-qualified domain name, backed by a DNA a record.\n- `EMAIL` is your email address, to agree to our terms[^1] and [LetsEncrypt's terms](https://letsencrypt.org/documents/LE-SA-v1.2-November-15-2017.pdf)[^2]\n  \n> [!WARNING]\n> Apple macOS users may find the Docker version to be the least stable. A common problem encountered when running BrowserBox Docker on macOS is tabs inexplicably freeze on occasion. A workaround is to close the problem tab, and resume in a new tab. This issues does not occur in BrowserBox Docker on other systems.\n\n#### Custom Docker Options\n\nIf you want, you can run a specific version manually, even pull it from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/dosyago/browserbox). Just make sure you tag it as `ghcr.io/dosyago/browserbox:latest`, so you can run it via the (very much necessary) run_script:\n\n```console\ndocker pull dosyago/browserbox:v7.1.2\ndocker tag dosyago/browserbox:v7.1.2 ghcr.io/browserbox/browserbox:latest\nPORT=9999\nHOST=browserbox.example.com\nEMAIL=j.citizen@example.com\nbash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrowserBox/BrowserBox/boss/deploy-scripts/run_docker.sh) $PORT $HOST $EMAIL\n```\n\n## Alternate \n\nAlternately you can clone the repository first and run the script direclty, like so:\n\n```console\ngit clone https://github.com/BrowserBox/BrowserBox\ncd BrowserBox\n./deploy-scripts/run_docker.sh $PORT $HOST $EMAIL\n```\n\n## 1-Click Deploy - Deploy BrowserBox to the cloud instantly! ✅ :tada: :cyclone:\n\nBy far the easiest and most fun method, 1-Click-Deploy BrowserBox is ready to deploy today on a number of popular cloud providers. See below for details. Just click the links to start your deployment and you'll be up and running in no time!\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> There's no licensing fees for personal use so all you pay are your own cloud costs.

Open that link (which looks like: **https://localhost:8080/login?token=csdkjhvsdfkjhv3498ysdf**) in your regular browser.\n\nTo stop your instance just issue the `stop_bbpro` command.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> The above simple method uses `my.awesome.host.com` as the hostname for your BrowserBox instance. You'll need to ensure you've set a DNS A record from `my.awesome.host.com` or your actual full domain name, to the IP address of the machine you're running BrowserBox on.\n\n-------\n\n***Now, let's show you the full manual install.***\n\n1. **Download and Clone the Git Repository, and jump into the directory**:\n\n```console\ngit clone https://github.com/BrowserBox/BrowserBox.git\ncd BrowserBox\n```\n\n2. **Point your DNS to your machine's IP with an *A record* mapping your chosen domain name to the IPv4 address of your VPS, VM, baremetal or whatever you're setting up on.**\n\nCheck that your hostname (you were creative so you picked: **my.awesome.host.com**) resolves by running:\n\n```console\n./deploy-scripts/wait_for_hostname.sh my.awesome.host.com\n```\n\n3. **Once DNS is set up Begin the Install:**\n\nRun the install script using your instance's full domain name and your email address. Email is for agreeing to our terms and the HTTPS certificate provider's (aka LetsEncrypt's) terms. We don't spam you! We may send you a product announce in future tho, or invite you to join a list, but such a vile transgression of the sanctity of your holy email space would be an exceedingly rare, and cautiously approached, occurrence!\n\n```console\n./deploy-scripts/global_install.sh my.awesome.host.name.com my-rockin@email.address.com\n```\n\nthis will take you through the attended install where you'll need to follow prompts. To just get the defaults (good idea), you can alter that command slightly to be a yes person for you :joy_cat::\n\n```console\nyes | ./deploy-scripts/global_install.sh my.so-awesome.host.name.com my-rockin@email.address.com\n```\n\nThe above will run an unattended install, where it does everything for you, and you can go away and fix yourself a delicious beverage, or what not.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> The user you install with *will* need `sudo` capabilities. But you do *not* need `sudo` caps to **run** BrowserBox once it is already installed. \n\n4. **Once Install Completes, Set Up, and Run!** :tada:\n\nAs soon as installation completes you'll be ready to run BrowserBox using the following two key commands:\n\n```console\nsetup_bbpro --port 9999\nbbpro\n```\n\n`setup_bbpro` will setup BrowserBox to bind to port 9999 (plus two either side for all its services. So ports 9997 through 10001 in this case).And will also return your very valuable, secret and crucial **login link**. This is your only way to access your BrowserBox. We save it to `$HOME/.config/dosyago/bbpro/login.link` if you lost it. Treat it like an screen sharing invite link, anyone you share that link with will be able to share, watch and drive your BrowserBox session, just like you. It's a free for all! Some may call it a melee. :joy:\n\n`bbpro` will start BrowserBox. Give it a couple seconds to start up.\n\n------\n\n# Latest News\n\n## v7.1.2 Maintenance Release\n\nOur new maintenance release has just landed and includes a range of minor improvements to stability across the diverse OS platforms supported by BrowserBox, including 1-Click deploy. Of note are the support of unprivileged users, and a drastic speedup of install times for the full (including doc viewer) install. [Read more here.](https://github.com/BrowserBox/BrowserBox/releases/tag/v7.1.2)\n\nWe've also translated a brief README introduction to BrowserBox into a few languages. See the links at the top of the README for a version that might be in your preferred language.\n\n## Contributing\n\nA few tips for development:\n\n- Ensure you use `./deploy-scripts/build_docker.sh` to build the Docker image. We build on macOS using Docker Desktop. Building on other platforms is not officially supported, tho we are open to reviewing a PR that adds a Podman build script.\n- `npm test` in the root directory runs the copy of BrowserBox in the current directory. `bbpro` runs the globally installed copy. `setup_bbpro` (equivalently: `./deploy-scripts/_setup_bbpro.sh`) configures BrowserBox and applies to any copy you run, regardless of whether you run with `npm test`, or `bbpro`.\n- Setting the `./src/common.js` `DEBUG.mode` key to `dev` uses the unbundled, unminified client code in `./src/public/voodoo`. Ensure you do this if you want to modify client-side code.\n\nContributors and developers take a look at these source diagrams of BrowserBox. \n\nThey contain 3 main parts: Back-end (**Zombie Lord**), Front-end (**Voodoo**), User-interface \n\n-------\n\n### BrowserBox *\"Zombie-Lord\"* Server\n\n<a href=\"https://dep-tree-explorer.vercel.app/api?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbrowserbox%2Fbrowserbox.git&entrypoint=src%2Fserver.js\">\n\n  <img width=\"1072\" alt=\"Here is a snapshot in 3D of the back-end.

It contains all client-side logic, interprets human-side user events, and presents notices from the browser-side. \n\n*[Click for an Interactive version of the above 3D front-end graph](https://dep-tree-explorer.vercel.app/api?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbrowserbox%2Fbrowserbox.git&entrypoint=src%2Fpublic%2Fimage-start-app.js).* \n\n-------\n\n### The UI Framework\n\nAnd neither of these above creations includes the [Good.HTML](https://github.com/o0101/good.html) view framework, which begins at [src/public/voodoo/src/components](https://github.com/BrowserBox/BrowserBox/tree/boss/src/public/voodoo/src/components) and contains all the UI logic and components to present the UI.\n\nTaken together these 3 parts comprise BrowserBox Remote Browser.  \n\n------\n\n\n## Vultr Marketplace\n\nWe just launched on the [Vultr Marketplace!](https://www.vultr.com/marketplace/apps/dosyago-browserbox)\n\n[Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/) is a cloud services provider offering a wide range of scalable, high-performance computing resources and solutions for businesses and developers, with affordable prices in over 30 regions around the globe.

If that doesn't happen, look for a warning about \"popup blocked\", in which case you'll need to \"allow popups\" on your browser in order to see it. If this happens, click the download link again to give the doc viewer window another chance to reopen.\n\nDue to customer requests, BrowserBox's Secure Document Viewer is now enabled by default! Please note that this will cause installation to take longer as many font packages are installed to ensure the correct display of a variety of document formats including: PDF, DOCX and more!\n\n## Windows Support :joy_cat: :tada:\n\nBrowserBox has just landed support for Windows and we're on [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/BrowserBox-Installer/1.5.8.20). Including Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022. Other platforms will be rolled out as they are tested. See the table below:\n\n\n|   Windows Edition   | Compatibility   |\n|---------------------|:---------------:|\n| Windows Server 2022 |           ✅ |\n| Windows Server 2019 |           ✅ |\n| Windows 11          |           ✅ |\n| Windows 10          |           ✅ |\n\nTo install and run on Windows, first do the following in PowerShell as **Administrator**:\n\n```posh\n# you may need the following 2 lines to install from PSGallery \n# if your package managers need updating\nSet-ExecutionPolicy Bypass\nInstall-PackageProvider Nuget -Force \nInstall-Module -Name PowerShellGet -Force\n```\n\nThen **close and reopen** your PowerShell session, and run as regular user:\n\n```posh\n# the main part to install BrowserBox installer\nInstall-Module -Name BrowserBox-Installer\n```\n\nThen\n\n```posh\nImport-Module BrowserBox-Installer\nInstall-BrowserBox\n```\n\nWhen prompted enter the `Domain name` that will point to your Windows instance, and your `Email address` for agreeing to our terms, and LetsEncrypt terms. Then, configure your BrowserBox instance (`-Port` and optionally `-Token` for the login link):\n\n```posh\nInitialize-BrowserBox -Port 8080\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> While BrowserBox opens ports on the operating system, if your cloud uses external firewalls, ensure ports `Port-2` through `Port+2` (8078-8082 in the example above) are opened in your control panel.\n\nAfter running `Initialize-Browserbox` you'll have your login link and you'll be ready to start BrowserBox and connect.\n\nFinally, to start 'er up, type:\n\n```posh\nStart-BrowserBox\n```\n\nAnd open your login-link in any modern browser anywhere. Note that if you're connected over RDP this step will disconnect your RDP session\nas we perform some voodoo-foo in order to utilize the pre-existing and good RDP Audio Driver in a way that lets us retain \nan audio stream even when you're not connected to your server.\n\n\n> [!TIP]\n> If you have trouble with the initial install module step (message aboutNuGet versions), this is probably a PS issue, so try (elevated):\n\n```posh\nInstall-PackageProvider Nuget -Force\nInstall-Module -Name PowerShellGet -Force\n```\n\nThen restart (close and reopen) your PowerShell session and try again.\n\n-----\n\nAny other issues with the installation on Windows then please [open an issue](issues) or reach out to us at anytime at [email](mailto:support@dosyago.com) or [Signal](https://signal.me/#p/+15039173547)\n\n## 1-Click Deploy!\n\nWe're currently increasing our support for marketplaces and one-click-deploy, we've just been included in [Azure Quickstart Samples](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/samples/azure/azure-quickstart-templates/browserbox/). \n\nSoon, we're also launching on the [Vultr Marketplace](https://www.vultr.com/marketplace/).

Deploy a new Linode instance pre-configured with BrowserBox. [Deploy your BrowserBox on Linode](https://cloud.linode.com/linodes/create?type=StackScripts&subtype=Community&stackScriptID=1279678).\n\n**Remember:** You'll need to create your DNS hostname record to point to your EC2 or Linode instance's IP, after you set it up. Supply the hostname you will use to these templates. The nascent instance will wait up to 1 hour for the hostname to resolve to its IP. \n\n*Please note: we mostly work with Debian 12, CentOS 9, Amazon Linux, Ubuntu and MacOS, so while BrowserBox should work on other compatible distributions, if it doesn't please let us know. If you encounter any issues at all, then open an issue or email support@dosyago.com and we'll do our best to help you out!*\n\n## 🧅 New Feature - Tor Support\n\n***tor-iframe:***\n```html\n<iframe src=\"https://mybrowserbox.server.com:9999/login?token=cviuygf3498tysifud&ui=false&url=[&quot;https://check.torproject.org&quot;]\"\n        style=\"border:none; width:100%; height:100%;\"\n        allowfullscreen\n        scrolling=\"no\">\n</iframe>\n```\n\nOn server:\n```bash\n$ IFRAME_LINK=$(setup_bbpro -p 9999 --ontor)\n```\n\nYou can now [browse the web through Tor when using BrowserBox](#rotating_light-browserbox-on-tor). BrowserBox also supports running itself as a [Tor hidden service](#rotating_light-latest-news-browserbox-hidden-services), so you can access your BrowserBox instances over the Tor network.\n\n<img width=\"1192\" alt=\"BrowserBox with --ontor on macOS successfully on the Tor network as checked at https://check.torproject.org\" src=\"https://github.com/BrowserBox/BrowserBox/assets/22254235/5b92a312-4d4e-49e4-bffe-7088f3abe7b1\">\n\n*[Donate to Tor](https://donate.torproject.org)*\n\n## 🌟 What Else is New in BrowserBox \n\nWe're thrilled to announce the following major updates to BrowserBox that will enhance your user experience and streamline your workflow!\n\n### Table of Contents\n\n- [What's New in BrowserBox](#-whats-new-in-browserbox)\n- [BrowserBox on Tor](#rotating_light-browserbox-on-tor)\n- [Installable PWAs on Desktop](#-installable-pwas-on-desktop)\n- [Protocol Links Support](#-protocol-links-support)\n- [Latest News: BrowserBox Hidden Services!](#rotating_light-latest-news-browserbox-hidden-services)\n- [AWS EC2 Installation](#browserbox---aws-ec2-installation)\n- [Docker Quick Start](#docker-quick-start-gem-version-6)\n- [Special Event: Ephemeral Web Proxy](#special-event--create-a-private-ephemeral-web-proxy-hosted-on-your-github-actions-minutes-by-opening-an-issue-on-this-repo)\n- [General README](#browserbox---general-readme)\n\n-----\n\n### :rotating_light: BrowserBox on Tor!\n\n#### 🌍 Enhanced Privacy with Tor Support\n\nWe are excited to announce that BrowserBox now supports Tor, providing you with a more private and secure browsing experience. This feature is still in alpha, but we're committed to continuously improving it to match the security level of the Tor Browser over time.\n\n**Key Features:**\n- **Onion Sites Accessibility**: Browse [`.onion`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.onion) websites seamlessly.\n- **Privacy-First Browsing**: Enhanced encryption for anonymity and security. Tor conceals the IP address of your RBI server.\n- **Socks5 Proxy Integration**: Traffic securely routed over a Socks5 proxy.\n- **Simple Tor Activation**: Easy activation using the `--ontor` flag.\n- **Platform Compatibility**: Tested on macOS and Debian.\n\n#### :gear: Using BrowserBox with Tor\n\nActivate Tor in BrowserBox with this command:\n\n```shell\n$ setup_bbpro <your-normal-args> --ontor\n$ bbpro\n```\n\n*If you want to switch it off again, shut down as normal (`pm2 delete all`), and re-run `setup_bbpro` without the `--ontor` flag.*\n\nStart exploring the web with Tor's added security.\n\n#### :warning: Important Caveats and Commitment to Security\n\nAs this Tor integration is in *alpha*, there are several important considerations:\n\n- **Proxy and Tor Escapes**: There's a potential for some requests to bypass the Socks5 Tor proxy or Tor itself, which could impact privacy. We are actively working to identify and mitigate these risks.\n- **Adherence to Tor Guidelines**: We aspire to aligning our Tor integration as closely as possible with the best practices recommended by the Tor Project. This includes careful configuration to prevent leaks and maintaining the anonymity that Tor provides.\n- **Ongoing Security Enhancements**: Our goal is to eventually provide a level of security comparable to the Tor Browser. We'll be regularly updating and improving the Tor functionality in BrowserBox.\n- **Exploring Alternatives**: We are considering the integration of alternative browsers like Brave as the underlying engine for RBI, which may offer a more secure base than Chrome for Tor browsing.\n\n#### :speech_balloon: Your Input is Valuable\n\nYour feedback is crucial for our continuous improvement. Please report any issues or suggestions to enhance the Tor functionality on our GitHub issues page. Contributions, especially those that help achieve parity with Tor Browser's security, are highly appreciated.\n\nStay tuned for more updates and enhancements in BrowserBox, and as always, enjoy a secure browsing experience!\n\n-----\n\n### 🚀 Installable PWAs on Desktop\n\nYou can now install BrowserBox as a Progressive Web App (PWA) on your desktop! This means smoother performance, offline capabilities, and a more integrated experience with your operating system. \n\n**Key Benefits:**\n- **Seamless Integration:** Feel the power of a native app with the flexibility of a web application.\n- **Offline Access:** Access essential features even without an internet connection.\n- **Reduced Resource Usage:** Enjoy a more efficient use of system resources compared to traditional web browsing.\n\n### 🔗 Protocol Links Support\n\nIntroducing protocol links support with `web+bb://`.

For supported versions of these operating systems see [this table](https://github.com/BrowserBox/BrowserBox#supported-server-os-table).\n\nFirst, update your distribution:\n\n`apt update && apt -y upgrade`\n\nAnd install a few basic tools:\n\n`apt install curl git wget`\n\nNow, prepare the machine by following these steps:\n\n1. Create a new user to operate BrowserBox:\n   ```\n   adduser pro\n   ```\n\n2. Disable the password for the newly created user:\n   ```\n   usermod -L pro\n   ```\n\n3. Create a new group for sudo privileges:\n   ```\n   addgroup sudoers\n   ```\n\n4. Add the following line to the sudoers file to avoid entering a password for sudo operations:\n   ```\n   %sudoers ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL\n   ```\n   Use the `visudo` command to edit the sudoers file.\n\n5. Grant sudo privileges to the user:\n   ```\n   usermod -aG sudoers pro\n   ```\n\nSwitch to the `pro` user by executing the following command:\n```\nsu - pro\n```\n\n### Installation Process\n\nFollow these steps to install BrowserBoxPro:\n\n1. Clone the BrowserBox repository:\n   ```\n   git clone https://github.com/BrowserBox/BrowserBox\n   ```\n\n2. Navigate to the cloned repository:\n   ```\n   cd BrowserBox\n   ```\n\n3. Run the global installation script, replacing `<domain_name>` with your domain name that points to the machine you're setting up (if you want to use it without a domain name, just use `localhost` here for the domain name, but you'll still need to copy the correct mkcert localsthost certificates to $HOME/sslcerts later). Use your `<email>` to agree to our terms and the LetsEncrypt terms:\n   ```\n   ./deploy-scripts/global_install.sh <domain_name> <email>\n   ```\n\n4. Start the main service on port 8080 and generate the login link:\n   ```\n   setup_bbpro --port 8080\n   ```\n\n5. Launch BrowserBox:\n   ```\n   bbpro\n   ```\n\nDuring the installation process, BrowserBox will automatically install the required dependencies and configure the necessary settings.\n\n## Applications in a Zero Trust Framework\n\nBrowserBoxPro isn't just a tool; it's a comprehensive solution designed to fit seamlessly into a Zero Trust architecture. Here's how:\n\n### Product Space Applications:\n\n- **Remote Browser Isolation**: Fundamental to Zero Trust, ensuring no direct content interaction with user devices.\n- **Co-Browsing**: Collaborate without compromising on security.\n- **VPN Alternatives**: A more secure solution than traditional VPNs.\n- **Threat Mitigation**: Web & Document Content Sanitization (Content Disarm & Reconstruction - CDR) ensures safe email attachments, web browsing and more!\n- **Secure Web Interaction**: A user-friendly UI for secure third-party processes.\n\n### Creative Ways that Clients are Using BrowserBox \n\n- A user-friendly UI that allows clients to perform 3rd-party processes without leaving your website.\n- A fully customizable online hosted web browser that provides an alternative to downloadable browsers.\n- The ability to record web app interactions to document bugs by capturing the event stream and viewport.\n- A mechanism to create visual \"How-To\" guides illustrating key user stories.\n\n### Internal Tooling Applications:\n\n- A tool for human-in-the-loop intervention to resolve stuck browser automation jobs and identify \"selector drift\" and script-page mismatch issues.\n- A robust web proxy to seamlessly integrate 3rd-party processes lacking APIs.\n- An interactive console to inspect, observe, and interact with browser automation tasks.\n- A browser that can be automated, offering effective evasion of bot detection mechanisms that target pure headless Chrome.\n- A scriptable console and interactive simulator for automation tasks, creating an intuitive feedback loop.\n\n### Tech and Framework Applications:\n\n- An open web `<WebView>` tag.\n- An `<iframe>` without cross-origin restrictions.\n- A 'head' for headless browsers.\n\nFor a comprehensive list of features and their availability in BrowserBoxPro, refer to the feature table below.\n\n## Features of BrowserBox in a Zero Trust Environment\n\nBrowserBox offers an array of advanced features that set it apart from other versions of remote browser isolation.
