We want to make contributing to this project as easy and\ntransparent as possible, whether it's:\n\n- Reporting a bug\n- Asking questions\n- Discussing the current state of the code\n- Submitting a fix\n- Proposing new features\n- Becoming a maintainer\n\n\n## OmniDB Database Support\n\nCurrently OmniDB supports `PostgreSQL`, `Oracle`, `MySQL` and `MariaDB`. We plan\nto support `Firebird`, `MSSQL Server`, `SQLite` and `IBM DB2` in the foreseeable\nfuture. Suggestions and even pull requests for other databases are welcome.\n\n\n## OmniDB Operating System Support\n\nWe currently build OmniDB for Debian, CentOS, Windows and OSX. Deployment for\ndifferent Linux distributions such as openSUSE, Arch Linux, Gentoo and RaspBian\nis in our roadmap, but it requires time. You can suggest other operating systems\nor architectures and even perform pull requests, we will appreciate that.\n\n\n## OmniDB Repositories\n\n- [https://github.com/OmniDB/OmniDB](https://github.com/OmniDB/OmniDB): Main\napplication and server, deployment scripts and tests.\n- [https://github.com/OmniDB/doc](https://github.com/OmniDB/doc): OmniDB\ndocumentation.\n- [https://github.com/OmniDB/monitors](https://github.com/OmniDB/monitors)\nMonitors (charts, grids) for the Monitoring Dashboard.\n- [https://github.com/OmniDB/plugins](https://github.com/OmniDB/plugins): OmniDB\nofficial plugins.\n\n\n## We Develop with Github\n\nWe use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as\naccept pull requests.\n\n1. Fork the repo.\n2. Checkout `dev` branch.\n3. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.\n4. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.\n5. Ensure the test suite passes.\n5. Issue that pull request to the `dev` branch.\n\nNote that the `dev` branch is only used in the main repo. For other repos, issue\nyour pull request to the `master` branch.\n\n\n## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License\n\nIn short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be\nunder the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that\ncovers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.\n\n\n## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/OmniDB/OmniDB/issues)\n\nWe use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by\n[opening a new issue](https://github.com/OmniDB/OmniDB/issues/new); it's that\neasy!\n\n\n## Write bug reports with detail\n\n**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:\n\n- A quick summary and/or background\n- OmniDB flavor you are using (app or server) and version\n- Operating system and version\n- Steps to reproduce\n  - Be specific!\n  - Give sample code if you can.\n- What you expected would happen\n- What actually happens\n- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)\n"
