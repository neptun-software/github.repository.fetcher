This gets rid of this [issue](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt-devtool/issues/20). [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/d72eb9d)\n\n## 0.17.7\n\n### Changed\n\n* isPojo renamed to isMutableObject. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/69c773e)\n\n- This now checks if an object is frozen or not before attempting to delete keys from it.\n\n## 0.17.6\n\n### Added\n\n* Can dispatch FSA actions directly through alt.dispatch. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/243828c)\n\n## 0.17.5\n\n### Added\n\n* Makes alt FSA compliant. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/f4818db)\n\n### Changed\n\n* Removes the warning if nothing is dispatched. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/9dd8e09)\n* Fix regression for not setting state if reduce returns undefined. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/cebd8e8)\n\n## 0.17.4\n\n### Added\n\n* Allow dispatching action creators. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/cd54ed1)\n* Warn if nothing is dispatched. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/3430d56)\n* Pass store state to bootstrap lifecycle.

[commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/189e009)\n\n* Expose a reduce function for every store by default. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/ab19ceb)\n\n  If you're using reducers then this allows you to not ever use waitFor since you can just call store.reduce(store.getState(), payload) in order to derive data.\n\n* Allow values for store state. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/5e18e9c)\n\n  this.state can now be any valid JS value rather than always being an object.\n\n* Add some reducer utils. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/f672938)\n\n  These reducer utils can be used for easily working with reducer only stores\n\n\n### Changed\n\n* Return value from sources local method. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/3e8bb8a)\n\n* Delete stores on hot reload.

[commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/2b5adb3)\n\n* Throw if listen does not get a function. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/193206f)\n\n* Change the connectToStores displayName. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/b2c0b31)\n\n* Allow listening to same action with multiple methods. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/a57d062)\n\n\n## 0.17.1\n\n### Changed\n\n* Returning a promise from action no longer makes the action dispatch by default. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/bcda4fb)\n\n## 0.17.0\n\n### Breaking Changes\n\n* Removed Symbol\n\n  **Upgrade Guide**\n\n  - Remove all references to Symbol, Symbol.keyFor, etc.\n  - Get access to the action's unique id via `myAction.id`\n\n* Removed `getEventEmitter()`\n\n  **Upgrade Guide**\n\n  - You can no longer access the internal event emitter to dispatch your own custom events. This is usually an anti-pattern.\n  - If you still need this behavior you can create your own event emitter in your store.\n\n```js\nclass TodoStore {\n  constructor() {\n    this.eventEmitter = new EventEmitter()\n\n    this.exportPublicMethods({\n      getEventEmitter: () => this.eventEmitter\n    });\n  }\n}\n```\n\n* Removed `_storeName`.\n\n  **Upgrade Guide**\n\n  - `_storeName` was an internal property to the store where the store's name was kept.\n  - You can now use `displayName` instead which is a public API.\n\n* Removed `stateKey`. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/40830ea)\n\n  **Upgrade Guide**\n\n  - A `stateKey` property was configurable on stores as well as app level.\n  - This has now been removed.\n  - This key was mostly used so you can use the react-like API of `this.state`, now this is being supported first-class.\n\n```js\n// old behavior\nclass MyStore {\n  static config = { stateKey = 'state' }\n\n  constructor() {\n    this.state = {}\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow you can just use `this.state` directly. If it exists it'll be picked up.\n\n```js\n// old behavior\nclass MyStore {\n  constructor() {\n    this.state = {}\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe old behavior of assigning state directly as instance properties will continue to be supported. However, this new behavior will be favored in the docs.\n\n* Render.toString/toStaticMarkup now return an object rather than a string of html.\n\n  **Note: Render API is still in flux**\n\n  **Upgrade Guide**\n\n```js\n// old\nRender.toString(App, props).then(markup => console.log(markup))\n\n// new\nRender.toString(App, props).then(obj => console.log(obj.html))\n```\n\n* Render.toDOM no longer locks by default.\n\n  **Upgrade Guide**\n\n  - Render.toDOM used to \"lock\" meaning it wouldn't perform the fetches on the client when it rendered.\n  - Now this is configurable and off by default in case you want to use Render to render client side only.\n\n```js\n// old\nRender.toDOM(App, props, document.getElementById('react-root'))\n\n// new\n// the `true` is to not fetch client side.\nRender.toDOM(App, props, document.getElementById('react-root'), true)\n```\n\n### Added\n\n* A sweet new DispatcherDebugger react component which lets you debug your flux application on the browser. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/ad9c2bb)\n* You may now return from actions directly in order to dispatch, no need to call `this.dispatch`.\n* connectToStores can now be used where you specify the methods at the callsite. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/a117e30)\n* statics addon lets you add your static methods to components that have been connected. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/537ec26)\n* TypeScript definitions!. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/d4ce63a)\n\n### Changed\n\n* Made the promise resolution to then(success, failure) so errors will be properly rejected. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/6f6bb05)\n\n## 0.16.10\n\n### Added\n\n* componentDidConnect for connectToStores. Allows you to specify data fetching in there. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/464bb26)\n\n* Hot reload of stores using webpack. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/66c875c)\n\n### Changed\n\n* Reversed the then/catch in the promise resolution for data sources so the catch only handles data source failures. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/8e1418b)\n\n* Throw when passing `undefined` to store.unlisten. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/4998c6a)\n\n## 0.16.9\n\n### Added\n\n* `preventDefault` to stop a store from emitting a change. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/1635589)\n\n* `observe()` a way for POJOs to observe for changes. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/1635589)\n\n* `otherwise()` listen to all dispatches that have not been bound in your stores. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/1635589)\n\n* `reduce()` listen to all dispatches in a store and return the new state. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/1635589)\n\n* `output()` transform the output that is emitted from the stores. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/1635589)\n\n* Proper server rendering resolving all data at the component level before rendering. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/4cf98e3)\n\n* Batched dispatches to avoid having componentWillMount cause a cannot dispatch while dispatching error when it loses context. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/907c94c)\n\n* Alt.debug for registering your alt instance with chrome dev tools. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/5b6d78c)\n\n* Function utils for transforming store state. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/e3564d6)\n\n## 0.16.7\n\n### Added\n\n* interceptResponse method to data sources [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/6f074)\n\n### Fixes\n\n* Revert breaking change back to merge state. 0.17.0 will include bootstrap, recycle, and flush replace state instead of merge state. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/9bc87)\n\n### Changed\n\n* local method in data source must return null or undefined to trigger remote [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/4152c)\n\n## 0.16.6\n\n### Fixes\n\n* Fixes bug with recycle for keys that weren't set at the beginning. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/1f8da1)\n* Fixes isLoading for multiple async calls. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/6e4ed23)\n\n## 0.16.5\n\n### Added\n\n* @decorate(alt) to decorate your store and activate all @bind and @expose methods. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/3865214)\n* getStores in conenctToStores decorator/wrapper function now receives props from a store. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/7003703)\n* Solving the async debate. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/4962ac5)\n\n## 0.16.4\n\n### Added\n\n* @bind and @expose decorators for binding actions and exporting public methods. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/9bf17f0)\n* Made the lifecycles eventemitters so you can bind multiple. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/cf226f5)\n\n### Fixes\n\n* Bug with react-native. Stop using the Object.assign polyfill since react-native overrides it with a non-spec compliant one. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/5ccab76)\n\n## 0.16.3\n\n### Dependencies\n\n* Updates es-symbol.\n\n## 0.16.2\n\n### Added\n\n* Now passing more information through the dispatch about the action invoked. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/05398a6)\n\n## 0.16.1\n\nThis release is a pretty big one and it also marks Alt's first breaking changes.\n\n### Breaking Changes\n\n> Upgrade guide is included with each bullet point.\n\n* New method signatures for createStore, createActions, etc. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/06838e7)\n\n  **Upgrade Guide**\n\n  - Previously all constructors for stores and actions received the alt instance as its first argument.\n  - You now have to pass this in yourself.\n\n```js\n// old behavior\n\nclass MyStore {\n  constructor(alt) { }\n}\n```\n\n```js\n// allows you to pass in your own arguments to the constructors\n\nclass MyStore {\n  constructor(alt, one, two, three) { }\n}\n\nalt.createStore(MyStore, null, alt, 1, 2, 3)\n```\n\n* beforeEach/afterEach methods have been moved to lifecycle. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/81a4e24)\n\n  **Upgrade Guide**\n\n  - Previously the beforeEach and afterEach methods existed as a prototype method on the store.\n  - Now they are lifecycle methods.\n\n```js\n// the new way\n\nclass Store {\n  constructor() {\n    this.on('beforeEach', () => {\n    });\n  }\n}\n```\n\n* withAltContext is now in decorator form. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/3d2df4f)\n\n  **Upgrade Guide**\n\n  - Previously withAltContext took two arguments. The flux and the component.\n  - Now it takes a single argument, flux. It returns a function which takes another argument, the component.\n\n  As a decorator:\n\n  ```js\n  @withAltContext(alt)\n  export default class App extends React.Component {\n    render() {\n      return <div>{this.context.flux}</div>\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  As a function:\n\n  ```js\n  export default withAltContext(alt)(App);\n  ```\n\n* Lifecycle method serialize and deserialize have been renamed and moved. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/fb30bbc)\n\n  **Upgrade Guide**\n\n  - Rename serialize to onSerialize.\n  - Rename deserialize to onDeserialize.\n  - Move those methods to your Store's configuration.\n\n  ```js\n  // new hotness\n  class TodoStore {\n    static config = {\n      onSerialize() {\n      },\n\n      onDeserialize() {\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n* atomicTransactions util has been renamed to just atomic. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/ff6c285)\n\n  **Upgrade Guide**\n\n  - Change all your import/require from `alt/util/atomicTransactions` to `alt/util/atomic`\n\n* Removed `mixins` from browser-with-addons. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/ca2e40e)\n\nMixins are dead, all hail our new higher-order component overlords.\nPlease use AltContainer instead: http://alt.js.org/docs/components/altContainer/\n\n* Method signature for beforeEach, afterEach, error lifecycle events have changed. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/0b4f3c6)\n\n  **Upgrade Guide**\n\n  - Previously the method signature looked like `fn(actionName, data, state)`.\n  - Now it has been simplified to `fn(payload, state)` where `payload` is an object.\n  - The payload object contains keys `action` and `data` which contain the information from before.\n\n```js\nclass Store {\n  constructor() {\n    this.on('beforeEach', (payload, state) => {\n      console.log(payload.data);\n    });\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Added\n\n* Time Traveling! [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/013447d)\n\n```js\n@timetravel\nclass TodoStore { }\n\nTodoStore.undo(3);\nTodoStore.redo(1);\n```\n\n* connectToStores function which also works with decorators. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/aedabf4)\n\n```js\n@connectToStores\nclass TodoApp extends React.Component {\n  static getStores() {\n    return [TodoStoreStore]\n  }\n  static getPropsFromStores(props) {\n    return TodoStore.getState()\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        {this.props.todos.map(todo => <Todo todo={todo} />}\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n```\n\n* ImmutableJS support, in an addon as a decorator. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/78ef8bf)\n\n```js\n@immutable\nclass TodoStore {\n  constructor() {\n    this.state = Immutable.Map({})\n  }\n}\n```\n\n* Use store references to take snapshots. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/a25f2c8)\n\n```js\nalt.takeSnapshot(TodoStore); // returns only TodoStore's snapshot\n```\n\n* Use store references to recycle. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/0563352)\n\n```js\nalt.recycle(TodoStore); // recycles only TodoStore\n```\n\n* Simple decorators for creating stores and actions. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/c06147e)\n\n```js\nimport { createStore } from 'alt/utils/decorators'\n\n@createStore(alt)\nexport default class TodoStore {\n  constructor() {\n  }\n}\n```\n\n* Apply transforms at the app level to modify each store before it is created. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/1a6f528)\n\n```js\nalt.stateTransforms.push(Store => {\n  // make every store atomic\n  return atomic(alt)(Store)\n})\n```\n\n* Add specific configuration to your stores, like how getState and setState behave. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/1de5e95)\n\n```js\nclass TodoStore {\n  static config = {\n    getState(state) {\n      // adds a new todo every time you getState\n      return states.todos.push({ 'Another todo!' });\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n* Create your actions inside the constructor by using instance properties. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/752995d)\n\n```js\nclass FooActions {\n  constructor() {\n    this.myAction = function (x) {\n      this.dispatch(x);\n    };\n  }\n}\n```\n\n* All actions created are now available in `alt.actions`. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/1d32ad9)\n\n* `inject` prop to AltContainer. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/14b56aa)\n\n```js\n// inject lets you inject arbitrary props to your children\n\n<AltContainer inject={{ foo: 7, bar: 'hello' }}>\n  <div />\n</AltContainer>\n\n// div gets prop foo=7 and bar='hello'\n```\n\n* `component` prop to AltContainer. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/653cb29)\n\n* alt has a `prepare` method which prepares a payload for bootstrapping. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/c56d0bf)\n\n```js\n// rather than rendering its children you can now pass in a component\n\n<AltContainer component={MyComponent} />\n\n// equivalent to\n\n<AltContainer>\n  <MyComponent />\n</AltContainer>\n```\n\n* Allow customizing where you assign your state as a key.

Instead if generates a new name for you and warns you in the console. If a store name is not specified due to using anonymous functions then a warning is also logged. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/48c589f5dfd5e623a3c6ab5b490a44ef319fc9ad)\n\n### Dependencies\n\n* es-symbol has been updated to 1.1.0 for better IE8 compatibility. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/fcc1c91c9c511d527f6d2464b0ea141cdf6e4995)\n\n## 0.13.11\n\n### Added\n\n* Added access to the internal EventEmitter used by the store. This can be access on the store instance by using `getEventEmitter()` and can be used for custom events. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/0bdb3a9a9eda43f99ebfcf5e127bf6570e045d50)\n* Added a setState method for syntactic sugar which sets the state in the instance variables inside your store and then emits a change event. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/6e45ae49d23e83b3e1f67e5ef41295a09d4d097a)\n* Added emitChange method. No more `this.getInstance().emitChange`, now you can just `this.emitChange()` from inside a store.

[commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/f42b43af9afabfb56494015c0be33d9625d30284)\n* ActionListener is a util that allows you to listen in on specific actions. Now it's even more lightweight if you want to listen in on a specific action but don't want the weight of a store. This comes as a util meaning it doesn't increase the size of core alt. Use it if you need it. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/ce5ddcac0e40747c6df27b3960961f8cbb854daf)\n\n### Fixed\n\n* addStore now has the `saveStore` parameter as well.

[commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/834ccf1718ccd6067dadbb286ca0fbbfd5510ecb)\n* FinalStore is a util Store that emits a change once all other stores have emitted. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/c104fb73eedd61f4c1dbd4ac074ce8a2f4b818bf)\n* Added a `saveStore` parameter to `alt.createStore`. This parameter controls whether we should save the store internally (for snapshots, bootstraps) or not. Default is true. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/c104fb73eedd61f4c1dbd4ac074ce8a2f4b818bf)\n\n### Fixed\n\n* All the mixins in the mixins folder don't make React complain about binding. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/1e5ca13d93f66f6839277dadf9eb3c62989f5569)\n\n## 0.13.8\n\n### Added\n\n* Create context on `add` in `Subscribe` mixin.

[commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/a3a83b963c970e44db10f13afd0c20f74d01084b)\n\n## 0.13.7\n\n### Added\n\n* Add `bindListeners` method to Store. This is the inverse of `bindActions`. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/3997f7960ac0b6c1f4fac00b33dc520b9816d70d)\n* Create shorthand form of `createActions`, `generateActions`. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/84e6bc40f1d7d03dc51f4f68d76bcca5b2fae748)\n* Add/update several helpful mixins: `FluxyMixin`, `ReactStateMagicMixin`, and `Subscribe`. [commit](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/c6acbf5deeee4aa60bd1e6bfcf590d4673926016)\n\n## 0.13.4\n\n### Added\n\n* Add tests.\n\n## 0.13.5\n\n### Added\n\n* Add `bower.json` to enable Alt with Bower.

For fun and profit.\n* Being able to debug from a broken state. Have your team send you the exact state the app was in when it crashed.\n* Isomorphism. You save a snapshot that you send from the server to the client and then bootstrap back on the client.\n* Rolling back to previous stable states.\n\nThere are also many [utils](https://github.com/altjs/utils) available which interface well with alt:\n\n* [ActionListener](https://github.com/altjs/utils/blob/master/src/ActionListeners.js) lets you listen to individual actions without having to create a store.\n* [AltContainer](https://github.com/altjs/container) a higher-order container component that is your swiss army knife for React.\n* [AltIso](https://github.com/altjs/utils/blob/master/src/AltIso.js) addon that uses [iso](https://github.com/goatslacker/iso) to render your application on both server and client.\n* [atomic](https://github.com/altjs/utils/blob/master/src/atomic.js) enables your stores for atomic transactions.\n* [connectToStores](https://github.com/altjs/connect-to-stores) a higher-order function that wraps your React components for store listening.\n* [decorators](https://github.com/altjs/utils/blob/master/src/decorators.js) a collection of useful ES7 decorators for working with alt.\n* [DispatchRecorder](https://github.com/altjs/utils/blob/master/src/DispatcherRecorder.js) lets you record all your dispatches and replay them back at a later time.\n* [FinalStore](https://github.com/altjs/utils/blob/master/src/makeFinalStore.js) is a Store that you can listen to that only emits when all your other stores have received all their data.\n* [ImmutableUtil](https://github.com/altjs/utils/blob/master/src/ImmutableUtil.js) makes working with immutable-js easy.\n* [TimeTravel](https://github.com/altjs/utils/blob/master/src/TimeTravel.js) enhances your stores so they are able to travel through different states in time.\n\n## Topical Guide\n\nFirst we install alt through npm. Although alt is also available through bower.\n\n```sh\nnpm install alt\n```\n\nThe following topical guide covers on using alt as a singleton in a traditional flux way.\n\nWe'll be referring back to this code a lot by using the `alt` reference declared.\n\n```js\nconst Alt = require('alt');\nconst alt = new Alt();\n```\n\n### ES6\n\nAlt is written in, and encourages ES6. It is completely optional but it is pleasant to write.\n\nYou can use the es6 transpiler that comes with react courtesy of\n[jstransform](https://github.com/facebookarchive/jstransform) or you can use one of the other popular ES6 transpilers:\n[babel](https://babeljs.io/) or [traceur](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler).\n\nYou won't need an [es6-shim](https://github.com/paulmillr/es6-shim) but you can use one for further goodies in your javascripts.\n\nAlt does depend on ES5 features, the good news is so does React. You can use [es5-shim](https://github.com/es-shims/es5-shim)\nto support those pesky old browsers.\n\n##Typescript Definitions and Support\nThe typescript definitions for alt are located in the typings directory. This should be included in your project under typings/alt or whatever folder you use to manage your definitions files. You can import the dependencies react and es6-promises, easily with [TSD](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/tsd). From here you can reference your typings as per usual with a reference tag ```<reference path=\"<path>.d.ts\" />```. Check the [alt-typescript-tutorial](https://github.com/Shearerbeard/alt-typescript-tutorial) for more information and project examples.\n\nUsing Typescript 1.5 you can import with the legacy syntax:\n```\nimport Alt = require(\"alt\");\nimport chromeDebug = require(\"alt/utils/chromeDebug\");\nimport AltContainer = require(\"alt/AltContainer\");\n```\n\n### Creating Actions\n\nActions are the way you update state. They're kind of a big deal.\n\n`alt.createActions :: Class -> Actions`\n\n```js\nclass LocationActions {\n  updateLocation(city) {\n    return city;\n  }\n}\n\nconst locationActions = alt.createActions(LocationActions);\n```\n\nYou return the data from your action that you wish to dispatch. If you want to run async in your actions then you simply return a function where the first argument is the dispatch:\n\n```js\nclass LocationActions {\n  updateLocationThatDoesItAsync(city) {\n    return (dispatch) => {\n      setTimeout(() => dispatch(city));\n    };\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`alt.createActions` then returns an `Object` containing all the methods defined. You can then call your actions directly.\n\n```js\nlocationActions.updateLocation('Paris');\n```\n\nWriting out actions that pass data through directly can get quite tedious so there's a shorthand for writing these what are essentially `identity` functions\n\n```js\nclass LocationActions {\n  constructor() {\n    // for single action\n    this.generateActions('updateLocation');\n\n    // as well as for many actions\n    this.generateActions('updateCity', 'updateCountry');\n  }\n}\n\nconst locationActions = alt.createActions(LocationActions);\n```\n\n```js\nlocationActions.updateLocation('Las Vegas')\n\nlocationActions.updateCity('Las Vegas')\nlocationActions.updateCountry('US')\n```\n\nRemember, `dispatch` only takes one argument. Therefore, if you need to pass multiple arguments into a store you can use an Object.\n\n```js\nclass LocationActions {\n  updateLocation(x, y) {\n    return { x, y };\n  }\n}\n\nconst locationActions = alt.createActions(LocationActions);\n\nlocationActions.updateLocation('Miami', 'Florida');\n```\n\nA shorthand function created in the constructor will pass through the multiple parameters as an Array\n\n```js\nclass LocationActions {\n  constructor() {\n    this.generateActions('updateLocation'); // ['South Lake Tahoe, 'California']\n  }\n}\n\nconst locationActions = alt.createActions(LocationActions);\n\nlocationActions.updateLocation('South Lake Tahoe', 'California');\n```\n\nThere's even a shorthand for the shorthand if all you're doing is generating a list of actions\n\n```js\nconst locationActions = alt.generateActions('updateLocation', 'updateCity', 'updateCountry');\n```\n\n### Stores\n\nStores are where you keep a part of your application's state.\n\nYou can either define your stores as a class/constructor-prototype or as an Object.\n\n`alt.createStore :: Class, string -> Store`\n\n```js\nclass LocationStore {\n  constructor() {\n    this.bindAction(locationActions.updateLocation, this.onUpdateLocation);\n\n    this.state = {\n      city: 'Denver',\n      country: 'US'\n    };\n  }\n\n  onUpdateLocation(obj) {\n    const { city, country } = obj\n    this.setState({ city, country });\n  }\n}\n\nconst locationStore = alt.createStore(LocationStore);\n```\n\nYou can also use a regular old JavaScript Object to create your stores. This is more about aesthetic preference.\n\n```js\nconst locationStore = alt.createStore({\n  displayName: 'LocationStore',\n\n  bindListeners: {\n    onUpdateLocation: locationActions.updateLocation\n  },\n\n  state: {\n    city: 'Denver',\n    country: 'US'\n  },\n\n  onUpdateLocation(obj) {\n    const { city, country } = obj\n    this.setState({ city, country });\n  }\n});\n```\n\nIf you're creating a store using a class/constructor then you also have the option of assigning your state values to your instance directly and then you're able to update them in place.\n\n```js\nfunction LocationStore() {\n  this.city = 'San Francisco';\n  this.country = 'US';\n}\n\nLocationStore.prototype.onUpdateLocation = function (obj) {\n  this.city = obj.city;\n  this.country = obj.country;\n};\n```\n\nStore instances returned by `alt.createStore` can be listened to for updates by calling `listen`.\n\n`listen` is meant to be used by your View components in order to await changes made to each store. It returns a function you can use to un-listen to your store.\n\n```js\nlocationStore.listen((data) => {\n  console.log(data)\n});\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `unlisten` method. It takes in the same function you used for `listen` and unregisters it.\n\nAnother important method is `getState`, which returns a copy of the current store's state.\n\n```js\nlocationStore.getState().city === 'Denver'\n```\n\n#### Important Note\n\nAll defined methods in your Store class **will not** be available on the store instance. They are accessible within the class but not on the returned\nObject via `alt.createStore`. This ensures that stores have no direct setters and the state remains mutable only through actions keeping the flow unidirectional.\nIf you want to attach public/static functions to your store the recommended method is to call the `exportPublicMethods` method from the constructor:\n\n```js\nclass LocationStore {\n  constructor() {\n    this.exportPublicMethods({\n      myPublicMethod: this.myPublicMethod\n    });\n  }\n\n  myPublicMethod() {\n    const internalInstanceState = this.getState();\n    return internalInstanceState;\n  }\n}\n\nconst locationStore = alt.createStore(LocationStore);\n\nlocationStore.myPublicMethod();\n```\n\nAn alternative is to declare the method as `static`, which will cause alt to expose the method on the store:\n\n```js\n// does the same thing as above except in a more magical way\nclass LocationStore {\n  static myPublicMethod() {\n    const internalInstanceState = this.getState();\n    return internalInstanceState;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Canceling An Event\n\nIf you don't want the store to inform the view of an action you can call\n`this.preventDefault()` (or you can return false) from inside an action handler method.\n\n```js\nclass LocationStore {\n  constructor() {\n    this.bindAction(locationActions.updateCity, this.onUpdateCity);\n\n    this.state = {\n      city: 'Portland',\n      country: 'US'\n    };\n  }\n\n  onUpdateCity(city) {\n    this.setState({ city });\n\n    // ensure the view never finds out\n    this.preventDefault();\n  }\n}\n\nconst locationStore = alt.createStore(LocationStore);\n```\n\n#### Constants\n\nI thought you said there were no constants? Well, yeah, sort of. The thing is, they're automagically created for you.\nFeel free to use them to bind your actions or use the method itself, whatever reads better in your opinion.\n\n```js\nclass LocationStore {\n  constructor() {\n    this.bindAction(locationActions.UPDATE_CITY, this.onUpdateCity);\n\n    this.state = {\n      city: '',\n      country: ''\n    };\n  }\n}\n\nconst locationStore = alt.createStore(LocationStore);\n```\n\n#### Listening To Multiple Actions\n\n```js\nclass LocationActions {\n  constructor() {\n    this.generateActions('updateCity', 'updateCountry');\n  }\n}\n\nconst locationActions = alt.createActions(LocationActions);\n```\n\nUsing the function `bindListeners` you're able to specify which action handlers belong to which actions this way you have ultimate control over what gets called and handled.\n\nThe function `bindListeners` is the inverse of `bindAction`. `bindListeners` takes an object of action handlers as keys and actions as a value.\n\n```js\nclass LocationStore {\n  constructor() {\n    this.bindListeners({\n      handleCity: locationActions.updateCity,\n      handleCountry: [locationActions.updateCountry, locationActions.updateLatLng]\n    });\n  }\n\n  handleCity(data) {\n    // will only be called by locationActions.updateCity()\n  }\n\n  handleCountry(data) {\n    // will be called by locationActions.updateCountry() and locationActions.updateLatLng()\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can bind all the actions inside `locationActions` using the shortcut `bindActions`\n\n```js\nclass LocationStore {\n  constructor() {\n    this.bindActions(locationActions);\n\n    this.state = {\n      city: 'Austin',\n      country: 'US'\n    };\n  }\n\n  onUpdateCity(city) {\n    this.setState({ city });\n  }\n\n  onUpdateCountry(country) {\n    this.setState({ country });\n  }\n}\n\nconst locationStore = alt.createStore(LocationStore);\n```\n\nActions who have a `onCamelCasedAction` method or an `actionName` method available in the store will be bound. In this example `locationActions.updateCity` will be handled by `onUpdateCity`. There is no difference between calling the action handler `updateCity` or `onUpdateCity` it's just a matter of aesthetic preference.\n\n#### Managing Store Data Dependencies\n\n`waitFor` is mostly an alias to Flux's Dispatcher waitFor. Here's an excerpt from the flux docs on what waitFor is designed for:\n\n> As an application grows, dependencies across different stores are a near certainty. Store A will inevitably need Store B to update itself first, so that Store A can know how to update itself. We need the dispatcher to be able to invoke the callback for Store B, and finish that callback, before moving forward with Store A. To declaratively assert this dependency, a store needs to be able to say to the dispatcher, \"I need to wait for Store B to finish processing this action.\" The dispatcher provides this functionality through its waitFor() method.\n\nYou can use waitFor like so:\n\n```js\nconst dependingStore = alt.createStore(class DependingStore {\n  constructor() {\n    this.bindActions(someActions);\n\n    this.state = { answer: 42 };\n  }\n\n  onRandom(answer) {\n    this.setState({ answer });\n  }\n})\n\nconst locationStore = alt.createStore(class LocationStore {\n  constructor() {\n    this.bindActions(someOtherActions)\n\n    this.state = {\n      meaningOfLife: null\n    };\n  }\n\n  onThings() {\n    this.waitFor(dependingStore.dispatchToken);\n\n    this.setState({ meaningOfLife: dependingStore.getState().answer });\n  }\n})\n```\n\nYou can also `waitFor` multiple stores by passing in an Array: `this.waitFor([store1.dispatchToken, store2.dispatchToken])`\n\n### Views\n\nYour choice of view isn't important to alt. What's important is to know how the view consumes the store's data, and that is via event listeners.\n\nIn this example I'll be using React, but you're free to use your library of choice.\n\n```js\n\nclass LocationView extends React.Component {\n  // these are methods that work with `connectToStores` which connects\n  // one or many stores to your component passing the state in as props.\n  // you're free to choose how the state from the store is passed into the\n  // component as props.\n\n  // this automatically does the listening/unlistening for you as well as\n  // handles the state changes\n  static getStores() {\n    return [locationStore];\n  }\n\n  static getPropsFromStores() {\n    return locationStore.getState();\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <p>\n          City {this.props.city}\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Country {this.props.country}\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\n// just make sure to wrap your component with connectToStores()\nexport default connectToStores(LocationView);\n```\n\n### Full Circle\n\nRestart the loop by making your views kick off new actions.\n\n## Alt Features\n\n### Snapshots\n\n`takeSnapshot :: ?...string -> string`\n\nSnapshots are a core component of alt. The idea is that at any given point in time you can `takeSnapshot` and have your entire application's state\nserialized for persistence, transferring, logging, or debugging.\n\nTaking a snapshot is as easy as calling `alt.takeSnapshot()`. It can also take an optional number of arguments as strings which correspond to the store names you would like to include in the snapshot. This allows you to take a snapshot of a subset of your app's data.\n\n### Bootstrapping\n\n`bootstrap :: string -> undefined`\n\nBootstrapping can be done as many times as you wish, but it is common to use when initializing your application. The `alt.bootstrap()` function takes in a snapshot (JSON string)\nyou've saved and reloads all the state with that snapshot, no events will be emitted to your components during this process, so again, it's best to do this\non init before the view has even rendered. If you need to emit a change event, you can use `this.emitChange` inside of your `bootstrap` life cycle method.\n\nBootstrap is great if you're running an isomorphic app, or if you're persisting state to localstorage and then retrieving it on init later on. You can save a snapshot on the server side, send it down, and then bootstrap it back on the client.\n\nIf you're bootstrapping then it is recommended you pass in a unique Identifier, name of the class is good enough, to createStore so that it can be referenced later for bootstrapping.\n\n```js\nalt.createStore(LocationStore, 'LocationStore')\n```\n\n### Rollback\n\n`rollback :: undefined`\n\nIf you've screwed up the state, or you just feel like rolling back you can call `alt.rollback()`. Rollback is pretty dumb in the sense\nthat it's not automatic in case of errors, and it only rolls back to the last saved snapshot, meaning you have to save a snapshot first in order to roll back.\n\n### Flushing\n\n`flush :: string`\n\nFlush takes a snapshot of the current state and then resets all the stores back to their original initial state. This is useful if you're using alt stores as singletons and doing server side rendering because of concurrency. In this particular scenario you would load the data in via `bootstrap` and then use `flush` to take a snapshot, render the data, and reset your stores so they are ready for the next request.\n\n### Recycling\n\n`recycle :: ?...string -> undefined`\n\nIf you wish to reset a particular, or all, store's state back to their original initial state you would call `recycle`. Recycle takes an optional number of arguments as strings which correspond to the store's names you would like reset. If no argument is provided then all stores are reset.\n\n### Lifecycle Methods\n\nWhen bootstrapping, snapshotting, or recycling there are special methods you can assign to your store to ensure any bookeeping that needs to be done. You would place these in your store's constructor.\n\n`bootstrap` is called after the store has been bootstrapped. Here you can add some logic to take your bootstrapped data and manipulate it.\n\n```js\nclass Store {\n  constructor() {\n    this.on('bootstrap', () => {\n      // do something here\n    })\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`init` is called when the store is initialized as well as whenever a store is recycled.\n\n```js\nclass Store {\n  constructor() {\n    this.on('init', () => {\n      // do something here\n    })\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`rollback` is called whenever all the stores are rolled back.\n\n```js\nclass Store {\n  constructor() {\n    this.on('rollback', () => {\n      // do something here\n    })\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`error` is called whenever an error occurs in your store during a dispatch. You can use this listener to catch errors and perform any cleanup tasks.\n\n```js\nclass Store {\n  constructor() {\n    this.on('error', (err, actionName, payloadData, currentState) => {\n      if (actionName === MyActions.fire) {\n        logError(err, payloadData);\n      }\n    });\n\n    this.bindListeners({\n      handleFire: MyActions.fire\n    });\n  }\n\n  handleFire() {\n    throw new Error('Something is broken');\n  }\n}\n```\n\n[See all the lifecycle methods](http://alt.js.org/docs/lifecycleListeners/)\n\n### Single Dispatcher\n\nA single dispatcher instance is made available for listening to all events passing through. You can access this via the `dispatcher` property: `alt.dispatcher`\nand listening to all events is as easy as\n\n```js\nalt.dispatcher.register(console.log.bind(console))\n```\n\nEach store has a reference to the dispatcher as well\n\n```js\nalt.createStore(class MyStore {\n  constructor() {\n    this.dispatcher.register(console.log.bind(console))\n  }\n})\n```\n\n### Flexibility\n\nYou can choose to use alt in many ways just like you'd use flux. This means your asynchronous data fetching can live in the actions, or they can live in the stores.\nStores may also be traditional singletons as in flux, or you can create an instance and have multiple store copies. This leads us into server side rendering.\n\n### Server Side Rendering\n\nAlt was built with isomorphism in mind. This means that you can run full flux server-side and pick back up on the client-side.\n\nThere are two options for using flux on the server:\n\n* Keep stores as singletons, keep data loading synchronous, bootstrap, and flush.\n* Create multiple instances of flux and inject the context into your app.\n\n#### Stores as Singletons\n\nWith this approach your stores are singletons.\nAny actions that load data must be synchronous, meaning you can fetch your data outside of actions and stores, and once done you fire off a synchronous action which loads\nthe store. Alternatively, you can gather all of your data, and once complete, you call `bootstrap()` which seeds all the stores with some initial data.\n\nOnce you've completed loading the stores with data you call `flush()` which takes a snapshot to send to the client and then resets all the stores' state back to their initial state. This allows the stores to be ready for the next server request.\n\n#### Flux Instances\n\nCreating separate instances of flux rather than relying on singletons can help when building isomorphic applications.\n\nThe problem with singletons is that you need to manage them by clearing out all their state and reloading them with new state on every request because requests happen concurrently. This isn't a problem if you already have your data and just need to load it into flux, or if you don't want to share your data fetching logic with the client -- in which case you can just load all your data at once on the server and render once that is all complete.\n\nSingletons only become a problem if you wish to share data fetching with client and server, don't want to use something like [Render](/src/utils/Render) to define your data fetching at the component level, or if you have a really complex data fetching scheme where some fetches depend on the result of other ones. In these cases creating separate instances (or copies) keeps flux sandboxed to each request so other async requests won't mutate the state in the stores.\n\nTaking this approach means you're making the trade-off of injecting the flux instance into your application in order to retrieve the stores and use the actions. This approach is similar to how [fluxible](https://github.com/yahoo/fluxible) solves isomorphic applications.\n\nCreating a new alt instances is fairly simple.\n\n```js\nclass Flux extends Alt {\n  constructor() {\n    super();\n\n    this.addActions('myActions', ActionCreators);\n    this.addStore('storeName', Store);\n  }\n}\n\nconst flux = new Flux();\n```\n\n```js\n// client.js\n\nReact.render(\n  <App flux={flux} />,\n  document.body\n);\n```\n\n```js\n// server.js\nReact.renderToString(<App flux={flux} />);\n```\n\n```js\n// retrieving stores\nflux.getStore('storeName').getState();\n\n// actions\nflux.getActions('myActions');\n```\n\n#### Picking back up on the client\n\nTo help facilitate with isomorphism alt recommends you use [iso](https://github.com/goatslacker/iso), a helper function which serializes the data on the server into markup and then parses that data back into usable JavaScript on the client. Iso is a great complement to alt for a full-stack flux approach.\n\n## Converting a flux application to alt\n\n1. [Importing the chat project](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/1a54de1064fe5bd252979380e47b0409d1306773).\n2. [Adding alt and removing boilerplate](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/75ffdb53420dc32bdc2d99b5cf534cd0949331d8).\n3. [Converting some actions](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/6f8cf22ba6b36c6ae91a794fad75473c9436b683) and [the last action](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/58ea1418ecd2af25b578cd0f4b77c3d4d8631518).\n4. Converting the stores [MessageStore](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/f4c7bb4bb9027b53c380f98ed99a2e1b6ba5fa0b), [ThreadStore](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/bce2aadbb52981f934b4281b3a6244d4f2c4a7a9), and [UnreadThreadStore](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/0129baa5bd505ef26228e30cfa15a6ac4503a22d).\n5. [Finishing touches](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/commit/e05a4e02f3f13831361136a21cd757416b69b4d8).\n\n## Differences Example\n\nFlux has constants, the dispatcher is also pretty dumb as in it just takes what you passed in the action\nand pipes it through to the store. This is completely fine but not something you should be expected to write.\nThe nice thing about constants is that you can easily grep for them in your application and see where\nall the actions are being called, with alt you get the same benefit without having to manage them.\n\n#### Before: Flux\n\n```js\nvar keyMirror = require('keymirror');\n\nvar actionConstants = keyMirror({\n  HANDLE_ACTION: null\n});\n\nvar action = {\n  foo() {\n    AppDispatcher.handleAction({ type: actionConstants.HANDLE_ACTION, data: 'foo' })\n  }\n};\n\nvar AppDispatcher = Object.assign(new Dispatcher(), {\n  handleAction(payload) {\n    this.dispatch(payload);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### After: Alt\n\n```js\nclass Action {\n  handleAction() {\n    return 'foo';\n  }\n}\n\nconst action = alt.createActions(Action);\n```\n\n## TL;DR\n\n* Isomorphic\n* Pure Flux\n* No constants\n* No static string checking\n* No giant switch statement\n* Save state snapshots\n* Rollbacks\n* Bootstrap components on app load\n* Light-weight and terse\n* ES6 Syntax, code your actions and stores with classes\n* Flexible\n* No direct setters on stores\n* Single dispatcher\n* Global listening for debugging\n* Small library\n\n## License\n\n[![MIT](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/alt.svg?style=flat)](http://josh.mit-license.org)\n"
