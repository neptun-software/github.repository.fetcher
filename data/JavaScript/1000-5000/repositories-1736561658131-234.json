          "content": "# Changelog\n\nAll notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.\n\nThe format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).\n\n## [3.4.2] - 2022-12-17\n\n## Changed\n\n- Adjust Docker to run as non-root user (thanks @rjhancock, #309, #337)\n\n## Fixed\n\n- Rendering issue in Safari\n\n## [3.4.1] - 2022-05-21\n\n## Fixed\n\n- Build failing on Netlify (thanks @adityatelange, #333)\n- Vercel not attaching CORS headers because of unsupported `multiValueHeaders` (thanks @birjj, #330)\n- `ACKEE_AUTO_ORIGIN` not attaching CORS headers (thanks @birjj, #330)\n\n## [3.4.0] - 2022-05-15\n\n### Added\n\n- Support for Node.js 17 (#302)\n- Cache preflight requests (via `Access-Control-Max-Age`) (#261)\n- Automatically add CORS headers for domains that have fully qualified domain names as titles ([`ACKEE_AUTO_ORIGIN`](docs/Options.md)) (#271)\n\n### Changed\n\n- MongoDB 4.4 or newer is now required, but older versions still may work\n\n## [3.3.1] - 2022-01-16\n\nYou will see a lower unique visitor count after updating. This release contains a fix for the unique visitor count and anonymisation that was broken since 3.2.0. The recorded visits were still anonymous, but Ackee tracked the visit path of each visitor. Data that Ackee normally removes. Data tracked since 3.2.0 are all counted as unique, even if they were not.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Unique visitor count and anonymisation (#304)\n\n## [3.3.0] - 2021-12-04\n\n### Added\n\n- Docker support for linux/arm64 and linux/arm/v7 (#298)\n\n## [3.2.0] - 2021-09-18\n\n### Changed\n\n- Switch to official Node.js Docker image\n- Updated dependencies, including mongoose (thanks @suda, #291)\n\n## [3.1.1] - 2021-06-27\n\n### Fixed\n\n- \"Float cannot represent non numeric value: NaN\" when visiting a new installation of Ackee\n\n## [3.1.0] - 2021-06-27\n\n> ⚠️ Contains breaking changes in the GraphQL API\n\nThis release contains a refactored front-end that takes advantage of the GraphQL API that has been a part of Ackee since version 2. Better caching and instant domain, event and permanent token updates. And: An active visitor counter that updated periodically without reloading the UI.\n\n### Added\n\n- Views and duration details: Click on a chart bar on the overview and insights page to see more details\n- Percentage changes of average views and duration in the facts panel\n- Active visitors counter updates periodically without reloading the UI\n- Tooltips for text in lists (#266)\n\n### Changed\n\n- `DomainStatistics` and `EventStatistics` (GraphQL API) now contain a unique id field\n- `View`, `Duration` and `EventChartEntry` (GraphQL API) now contain their date in a `value` field in the format: YYYY, YYYY-MM or YYYY-MM-DD. The format depends on the chosen interval.\n- `DomainStatistics` and `EventStatistics` (GraphQL API) now contain a unique id in the `id` field. The previous data has been renamed to `value`, because it was never unique and therefore shouldn't be named `id`.\n- `averageViews` and `averageDuration` (GraphQL API) are now types and don't contain the values directly\n\n## [3.0.6] - 2021-04-02\n\n### Changed\n\n- Updated dependencies, including `ackee-tracker` in v5.1.0 which ignores updateRecord request when the website is in the background (#202)\n\n## [3.0.5] - 2021-02-21\n\n### Changed\n\n- Ackee now requires Node.js 14 in the `package.json` even when Node.js 14 was already required\n- Tests are testing with Node.js 14 and 15\n\n## [3.0.4] - 2021-02-21\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Unable to set Access-Control-Allow-Credentials Header on Platforms-As-A-Service Deployments (#223)\n\n## [3.0.3] - 2021-01-24\n\n### Added\n\n- Missing breaking change notice in the changelog of version 3.0.0 for those using a wildcard `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Unknown sizes id when a size is zero (#217)\n- Prevent unknown id errors like in #217 for other record properties\n- Updated ackee-tracker which re-added `ignoreOwnVisits` for those using a wildcard `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header\n\n## [3.0.2] - 2021-01-21\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Temporary workaround for missing browser sizes (#217)\n\n## [3.0.1] - 2021-01-21\n\n### Fixed\n\n- UI showing the wrong version\n- Server serving an outdated version of ackee-tracker\n\n## [3.0.0] - 2021-01-21\n\nEvents, browser navigation and better referrers 🎉\n\n### Highlights\n\n#### Events\n\nAckee can now [track events](docs/Events.md) like newsletter subscriptions, buttons clicks, checkout sums and more. It's the most requested feature and I'm happy that it's finally a part of Ackee.\n\n#### Browser navigation\n\nYou can now use the back and forward buttons to navigate between pages.\n\n#### Referrers 2.0\n\nYou can now [specify a `source` parameter in URLs](docs/Enhancing%20referrers.md) (e.g. `https://example.com?source=Newsletter`). Ackee will use the parameter instead of the referrer when available. This allows you the track links from newsletters and other platforms more precisely.\n\n#### Faster startup, smaller size\n\nAckee previously had to compile all source files before the server was ready. v3 now ships with all files Ackee needs and only builds those containing environment variables. This means running `yarn start` is way faster and the Docker container even smaller.\n\nOh, and we also reduced the JS file size of the UI by ~60%.\n\n### Breaking changes\n\n#### `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: \"*\"` not recommended\n\n> This change is relevant for you when using a wildcard as the Access-Control-Allow-Origin.\n\nUsing a wildcard (`*`) for the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header was never recommended as it's neither a secure solution nor does it allow Ackee to ignore your own visits. Please disable the `ignoreOwnVisits` option in ackee-tracker if you're currently using a wildcard. The [SSL and HTTPS](docs/SSL%20and%20HTTPS.md) guide contains better alternatives.\n\n`ignoreOwnVisits` is now enabled by default and won't work when using a wildcard.\n\n#### New `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header\n\n> This change is relevant for everyone.\n\nAckee requires [a new `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header](docs/CORS%20headers.md#credentials) which was previously optional. Make sure to add this header in your server or reverse proxy configuration.\n\n#### ackee-tracker with new `.create` and `.record` syntax\n\n> This change is only relevant for you when using ackee-tracker in the [Manually](https://github.com/electerious/ackee-tracker/blob/master/README.md#manually) or [Programmatic](https://github.com/electerious/ackee-tracker/blob/master/README.md#programmatic) way.\n\nThe [changelog of ackee-tracker](https://github.com/electerious/ackee-tracker/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) contains everything you need to know when updating to the newest version.\n\n#### Referrers require `ReferrerType` in GraphQL API\n\n> This change is relevant for you when using the GraphQL API.\n\nA new parameter is required when requesting referrers via the GraphQL API. The parameter is called `ReferrerType` and can be `WITH_SOURCE`, `NO_SOURCE` or `ONLY_SOURCE`.\n\n#### Referrers can return non URL ids via GraphQL API\n\n> This change is relevant for you when using the GraphQL API.\n\nThe `id` of requested referrers was always a URL, but has been changed to a string. That's because [referrers can now include parameters](docs/Enhancing%20referrers.md) (e.g. `source` when using `ackee-tracker`).\n\n### Added\n\n- Browser navigation. It's now possible to navigate using the back and forward button in the browser.\n- \"Copied to clipboard\" message when clicking on an input or textarea that copies to the clipboard (#166)\n- Modals can be closed with the ESC key\n- Tests for permanent tokens, events and actions\n- `source` field for records to track (thanks @BetaHuhn, #185)\n- Referrers will now show the `source` parameter when available (thanks @BetaHuhn, #185)\n- Use the `s` key to open the settings and `o` to switch to the overview ([Keyboard shortcuts](docs/Keyboard%20shortcuts.md))\n- Explanation why data is missing (#192)\n\n### Changed\n\n- Compiled source files are now part of the repo\n- Docker container size has been reduced (again)\n- Updated build tools allow us to use ~60% less JS in the UI\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Close, delete and submit in modals could be triggered multiple times\n\n## [2.4.1] - 2020-12-20\n\n### Changed\n\n- Updated Dockerfile reduces the size of the Docker build by ~58% (#195, thanks @omBratteng)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Errors from permanent tokens not showing up in the UI\n- Remove console logs from `apollo-server-plugin-http-headers`\n- Log GraphQL error instead of `undefined`\n\n## [2.4.0] - 2020-11-15\n\nAckee now ignores your own visits once you have logged into the dashboard. Make sure to enable the [`ignoreOwnVisits` option in ackee-tracker](https://github.com/electerious/ackee-tracker#-options) to use this feature. It's currently opt-in, because it requires [a new `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header](docs/CORS%20headers.md#credentials), which wasn't previously required. It will be turned on by default in the next major release of Ackee.\n\n> ℹ️ Some browsers strictly block third-party cookies when Ackee runs on a different domain than the site you're visiting. Therefore, it may happen that your own visits still find their way into your statistics, even when the option `ignoreOwnVisits` is turned on.\n\n### Added\n\n- Ignore own visits (#100, thanks @yehudab)\n- Tons of new tests (#171, thanks @yehudab)\n\n## [2.3.0] - 2020-11-04\n\nThis release adds [support for Vercel](docs/Get%20started.md) and updates the included `ackee-tracker` which now ignores bots.\n\n### Added\n\n- Support for Vercel (#180, thanks @elliottsj)\n- Contributing guide and issue templates (#184, thanks @BetaHuhn)\n\n### Changed\n\n- ackee-tracker updated to version 4.1.0\n\n## [2.2.0] - 2020-11-01\n\nNew tools like [ackee-report](https://github.com/BetaHuhn/ackee-report), [ackee-bitbar](https://github.com/electerious/ackee-bitbar) and the [Ackee iOS widget](https://twitter.com/getackee/status/1320996848623099909) are build upon the powerful API of Ackee. This release makes it even easier to them by introducing permanent tokens. Permanent tokens never expire and are perfect for tools that run in the background. You can create them in the settings of Ackee and use them for authentication in Ackee-powered apps.\n\n### Added\n\n- Permanent tokens (#176, thanks @BetaHuhn)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Serverless function CORS headers (#175)\n\n## [2.1.1] - 2020-10-28\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Error while deploying to Netlify (#175)\n\n## [2.1.0] - 2020-10-24\n\nThis release introduces support for serverless functions. You can now deploy Ackee to Netlify 🚀 It also reduces the memory usage and allows you to build all static files into `/dist` by running `yarn build`. Run `yarn server` to start the server without building those files, again. This reduces the initial startup time. `yarn start` combines both commands for convenience and is still the recommended way to run Ackee.\n\n### Added\n\n- Support for serverless functions and Netlify (#155)\n- Added \"Deploy to Netlify\" to the [Get Started](docs/Get%20started.md) guide\n- Build all static files into `/dist` by running `yarn build`\n- Start the server without rebuilding static files using `yarn server`\n\n### Changed\n\n- Improved scrollbars on Windows (#153, thanks @Go-Merk)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Reduce high memory usage by building files in a different step (#170)\n- Show only active records in visitor counter (#161)\n- Labels in modals sometimes not clickable because of invalid ids\n\n## [2.0.3] - 2020-09-20\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Invalid value error (#165)\n\n## [2.0.2] - 2020-09-20\n\n### Added\n\n- [vuepress-plugin-ackee](https://github.com/spekulatius/vuepress-plugin-ackee)\n- [gridsome-plugin-ackee](https://github.com/DenzoNL/gridsome-plugin-ackee)\n\n### Changed\n\n- More relevant data on the dashboard: Ackee now shows the top data of the last 24 hours instead of last 7 days\n- Heroku installation docs (#154, thanks @Go-Merk and @aleccool213)\n\n## [2.0.1] - 2020-08-16\n\nThis updates improves the look of the README and adds some missing pieces of documentation.\n\n### Added\n\n- [Privacy Policy example](docs/Privacy%20Policy.md) (#122)\n\n## [2.0.0] - 2020-08-15\n\nThe first major back-end and front-end rewrite of Ackee with new API, dashboard, active visitors counter and more. Updating is as easy as ever. Simple grab the newest version, ensure that you're using Node.js v14 or higher and start Ackee. That's it!\n\n### Added\n\n- GraphQL API\n- Overview with facts and data from all domains\n- Facts card with live visitor counter, average visits and durations and the total number of visits today, this month and year\n- New navigation that allows you to view stats by domain\n- Keyboard shortcuts\n- Switch between daily, monthly and yearly durations\n- Click on a card headline to view more of this domain or insight\n- Support `+srv` connection string modifier for MongoDB urls (#132, thanks @ericsandine)\n\n### Changed\n\n- Improved performance for all aggregations\n- Show stale data while loading new data\n- Removed detailed durations\n- Delete records of a domain when deleting a domain\n- Updated the required Node.js version and Docker Node.js version to v14\n- Removed \"All time\" and replaced it with \"Last 6 months\" for performance reasons\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Sorting of yearly views\n\n## [1.7.1] - 2020-05-15\n\n### Added\n\n- Instructions for using Helm (#109, thanks @suda)\n- Instructions for using systemd (#112, thanks @LickABrick)\n- Instructions on how to update when hosting on Heroku (#107, thanks @ckipp01)\n\n## [1.7.0] - 2020-04-19\n\n### Added\n\n- Filter bar to quickly change what you're viewing\n- [Documention website](https://docs.ackee.electerious.com/#/)\n- Browsers, devices and operating systems are now visible in the UI (thanks [@RomainCscn](https://github.com/RomainCscn))\n- Browser and screen resolutions allow you to view width and height combined (thanks [@RomainCscn](https://github.com/RomainCscn))\n- View the last 24 hours, 7 days, last 30 days or the top entries of all time (thanks [@RomainCscn](https://github.com/RomainCscn))\n\n### Changed\n\n- API returns more entries (25 -> 30)\n- Loading design in header\n\n## [1.6.1] - 2020-03-25\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Origin header check for multiple hosts (#84, thanks @jaryl)\n\n## [1.6.0] - 2020-03-06\n\n### Added\n\n- Switch between daily, monthly and yearly views\n- `ACKEE_ALLOW_ORIGIN` now supports multiple domains (#79 #82, thanks @jaryl)\n\n### Improved\n\n- JS error handling with React error boundary\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Loading indicator when the sizes-view is loading\n- Catch errors when the sizes-view throws an error\n\n## [1.5.0] - 2020-02-16\n\n### Added\n\n- Ackee can track detailed data ([optional](https://github.com/electerious/ackee-tracker#-options)) and now shows more of them in the \"Detailed\"-menu\n\n## [1.4.3] - 2020-01-12\n\n### Added\n\n- Simply [deploy to Heroku](docs/Get%20started.md#with-heroku) by clicking one button (#72, thanks @aleccool213)\n- `ACKEE_ALLOW_ORIGIN` option for [Platforms-As-A-Service](docs/CORS%20headers.md) (#73, thanks @aleccool213)\n\n## [1.4.2] - 2019-12-19\n\n### Changed\n\n- Allow the use of `PORT` instead of `ACKEE_PORT` (#70)\n- Improved parts of the documentation\n\n## [1.4.1] - 2019-11-16\n\n### Added\n\n- Related modules in README\n\n### Changed\n\n- Click a Twitter link to see who tweeted the link\n\n## [1.4.0] - 2019-11-05\n\n### Added\n\n- \"New referrers\"\n- Custom tracker URL (#53)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Incorrect content type for JS files (#54)\n\n## [1.3.0] - 2019-10-19\n\n### Added\n\n- Average and detailed durations\n\n### Changed\n\n- Links now open in a new tab with `rel=\"noopener\"`\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Remove username and password before logging MongoDB connection URI (#50)\n- Horizontal scroll on pages with vertical scroll (#52)\n- Large numbers in chart view overlapping bars\n- \"Last 7 days\" now shows last 7 days instead of 8\n- Title for \"Unique site views\"\n- CORS headers in documentation\n- Data fetched twice when navigating in UI\n- Abort old fetch calls when they're triggered again\n\n## [1.2.0] - 2019-09-21\n\n### Added\n\n- Top and recent languages\n- Comparison bars for \"Views per page\"\n\n### Changed\n\n- Top and recent pages in a dedicated view\n- Hover recent referrers to see the date\n- Improved URL normalization for cleaner URLs in \"Views per page\" and \"Referrers\"\n- Improved logging of errors in the server log\n- Improved menu on small screens\n- Reset state after pressing \"Reload Ackee\" in the error overlay to recover from bugs caused by a faulty state\n\n## [1.1.0] - 2019-09-11\n\n> ⚠️ All options / environment variables have been renamed.

Ackee runs on your own server, analyzes the traffic of your websites and provides useful statistics in a minimal interface.\n\n[🌍 Website](https://ackee.electerious.com) | [🔮 Live Demo](https://demo.ackee.electerious.com) | [🧸 GraphQL Playground](https://demo.ackee.electerious.com/api)\n\n<br/>\n\n![Ackee in a browser](https://s.electerious.com/images/ackee/readme.png)\n\n</div>\n\n## 👋 Introduction\n\nAckee is a self-hosted analytics tool that cares about privacy. We believe that you don't need to track every aspect of your visitors. Ackee keeps tracked data anonymized to avoid that users are identifiable, while still providing helpful insights. It's the right tool for everyone who doesn't need a full-featured marketing analytics platform like Google Analytics or Matomo.\n\n- **Self-hosted**: Ackee runs on your own server and is 100% open-source\n- **Modern technologies**: Lightweight Node.js and MongoDB architecture\n- **Beautiful**: Minimal and focused interface\n- **No cookies**: No unique user tracking and therefore no required cookie message\n- **Events**: Track button clicks, newsletter subscriptions and more\n- **GraphQL API**: Fully documented GraphQL API that allows you to build new tools upon Ackee\n\n## 🚀 Get started\n\nGet Ackee up and running…\n\n- […with Docker Compose](docs/Get%20started.md#with-docker-compose)\n- […with Docker](docs/Get%20started.md#with-docker)\n- […with Helm](docs/Get%20started.md#with-helm)\n- […without Docker](docs/Get%20started.md#without-docker)\n- […with Netlify](docs/Get%20started.md#with-netlify)\n- […with Vercel](docs/Get%20started.md#with-vercel)\n- […with Heroku](docs/Get%20started.md#with-heroku)\n- […with Qovery](docs/Get%20started.md#with-qovery)\n- […with Render](docs/Get%20started.md#with-render)\n- […with Railway](docs/Get%20started.md#with-railway)\n- […with Koyeb](docs/Get%20started.md#with-koyeb)\n\nAnd configure Ackee and your server correctly…\n\n- […with environment variables](docs/Options.md)\n- […with SSL and HTTPS enabled](docs/SSL%20and%20HTTPS.md)\n- […with CORS headers](docs/CORS%20headers.md)\n\nTake a look at the [FAQ](docs/FAQ.md) if you have any questions left.\n\n## 📚 Documentation\n\nDocumentation and guides are located in [the /docs folder](docs/). Also take a look at the [FAQ](docs/FAQ.md) if you have any questions left.\n\n### API\n\nAckee features a [GraphQL API](docs/API.md) that allows you to build custom tools upon Ackee. Everything you see in the UI is made from data delivered by the API.\n\n### Options\n\nAckee uses environment variables and supports [`.env` files](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) in the root of the project if you want to store all variables in one file. [Options &#187;](docs/Options.md)\n\n## Miscellaneous\n\n### Donate\n\nI am working hard on continuously developing and maintaining Ackee.
